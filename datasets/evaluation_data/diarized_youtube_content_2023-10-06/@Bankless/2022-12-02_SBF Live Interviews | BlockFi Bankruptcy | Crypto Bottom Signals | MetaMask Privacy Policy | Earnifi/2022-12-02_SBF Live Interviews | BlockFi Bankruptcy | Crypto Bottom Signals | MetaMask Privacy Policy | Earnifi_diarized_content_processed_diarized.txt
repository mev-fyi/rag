00:00:00.250 - 00:00:21.502, Speaker A: Given Sam's history of masking his appearance and being very cold and calculating about his publicity, I could definitely take the argument maybe I would lean to the argument that this is also part of his plan, that this is also very much calculated, and he's using this kind of childless I was too young, got caught up in things.
00:00:21.556 - 00:00:26.614, Speaker B: I'm learning my lesson. I'm sorry, but that can't work, right? No, absolutely no.
00:00:26.652 - 00:00:27.794, Speaker A: Because 16 billion.
00:00:27.842 - 00:00:29.880, Speaker B: He stole $16 billion.
00:00:32.650 - 00:00:41.366, Speaker A: Bankless nation. Happy first Friday of December. David. Hard to believe. We're in the twelveTH month of the year, and I just want this to be your best is it? It is the best month.
00:00:41.468 - 00:00:43.162, Speaker B: December is the best month of the year.
00:00:43.296 - 00:00:45.210, Speaker A: Oh, your birthday. I knew this.
00:00:45.280 - 00:00:51.702, Speaker B: Oh, no, I'm not going to be that narcissistic about it. I mean, it's a contributing factor, but.
00:00:51.776 - 00:01:02.522, Speaker A: Perhaps yeah, I didn't mean to imply yes, of course. I'm sure you think Christmas and the holidays and spending time with loved ones nothing to do with your birthday.
00:01:02.586 - 00:01:06.370, Speaker B: Right? Well, I mean, it's just one of many nice things about December. Yeah.
00:01:06.520 - 00:01:12.450, Speaker A: Well, I'm glad for this year to be over in crypto. I want to put this behind us.
00:01:12.520 - 00:01:18.434, Speaker B: Also, I'm claiming that it's going to be a bullish month. Prices will be up in 30 days.
00:01:18.632 - 00:01:25.430, Speaker A: Do you remember, I think the depth of the bear market was like December 2018. Or was it 2019 last time?
00:01:25.500 - 00:01:27.398, Speaker B: Yeah, right at the end of the year.
00:01:27.484 - 00:01:29.810, Speaker A: But you already think we've bottomed.
00:01:29.970 - 00:01:31.542, Speaker B: I think so, yeah.
00:01:31.676 - 00:01:38.234, Speaker A: All right, we're going to talk about that. A few things to talk about this week. Number one SBF. He's given interviews now. What the hell?
00:01:38.352 - 00:01:39.782, Speaker B: Against legal advice.
00:01:39.926 - 00:01:42.266, Speaker A: I can't imagine those lawyers are very happy about this.
00:01:42.368 - 00:01:44.774, Speaker B: He's going on a tour, dude.
00:01:44.902 - 00:01:46.034, Speaker A: Why SBF?
00:01:46.102 - 00:02:07.790, Speaker B: Redemption tour. The redemption arc has already started. But before we get to all of that mess, we got to talk about all the bottom signals and why I think it's going to be a bullish month. Because bottom signals, Ryan, are abound. And there's also some bullish signals. The ethereum ecosystem is winning some key infrastructure from other chains. Also, layer two, ecosystem metrics are at all time highs.
00:02:07.790 - 00:02:11.534, Speaker B: But there's one big announcement, Ryan, that I know you're super excited for.
00:02:11.592 - 00:02:12.322, Speaker A: I'm super excited.
00:02:12.386 - 00:02:13.254, Speaker B: Do you want to tease it or.
00:02:13.292 - 00:02:19.494, Speaker A: Do you well, this could be the biggest bottom signal at all. Maybe I'll just say it hopefully and we'll tease it. Okay. We acquired a company.
00:02:19.612 - 00:02:20.290, Speaker B: What?
00:02:20.460 - 00:02:37.418, Speaker A: We can this time. This is not a Wells Fargo prank. This is know us putting our bankless name on the Philadelphia Flyers Bankless did Stadium. This is real. We really did this. The podcast podcast did this. Seriously, guys, this is a new tool for the Bankless Nation.
00:02:37.418 - 00:02:54.878, Speaker A: We want to tell you all about it so we'll get to all of these topics. David, before you get into this episode, though, we got to shout out our friends, longtime friends, really, and sponsors at Opolis. Opolis is a seriously fantastic product for benefits, healthcare benefits and payroll. What does Opolis do, David?
00:02:54.974 - 00:03:50.870, Speaker B: They help you go bankless. The Web Three World is not very friendly to independent entrepreneurs or anyone who really wants to work in the chaos that is Web Three, yet still have the fantastic order of the benefits that you would get at a normal nine to five job, such as healthcare and payroll and tax services. Like all of the requirements that you need to work and live inside of a nation state while also working in the freedom of Web Three. Opelus can help you get that done. And so if you are just a Web Three entrepreneur, you're an NFT artist, you're working in a Dow, all of these loose employment structures, but you need all of the structure to, I don't know, have health care for your kids, too. Don't forget about that. Opelis can help you with all of that stuff to make sure that you can do exactly what you do best, which is work in Web Three.
00:03:50.870 - 00:04:09.706, Speaker B: Work on the frontier. So there is a link in the show notes to book a meeting with a membership success steward. And if you do that by December 31 of this year, which is coming up, you got one month, you will get 1000 work tokens and 1000 bank tokens. So start 2023 off right with health care and other things.
00:04:09.808 - 00:04:16.814, Speaker A: That's right. And believe me, David, when you have kids, you never forget about your kids. Health care number one, super important.
00:04:17.012 - 00:04:24.400, Speaker B: When I told my mom that I lost health care between jobs, she laid an impression upon me. And I haven't done that since.
00:04:25.010 - 00:04:28.234, Speaker A: Well, okay. How long were you off of healthcare?
00:04:28.282 - 00:04:29.390, Speaker B: Like two or three weeks.
00:04:29.540 - 00:04:32.526, Speaker A: Just two or three? That's not bad. I mean, some people do for, like.
00:04:32.548 - 00:04:36.998, Speaker B: Months even, that she was like, David, you can't do that to me.
00:04:37.084 - 00:04:43.734, Speaker A: I think we just got healthcare set up. And you were like, for bankless for you and I. And you were, like, on a scooter one day, right?
00:04:43.772 - 00:04:44.166, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:04:44.188 - 00:04:59.370, Speaker A: Am I remembering this? And you were looking down at your phone. This is early days of the podcast, and you flipped off your phone and you showed up to a bankless conversation we were having with, like, a missing tooth and, like, a black eye. And I'm like, oh, God, I am glad we got health care before this incident.
00:04:59.710 - 00:05:04.330, Speaker B: Do you remember this? I think that was well into bankless. I don't think that was at the beginning.
00:05:04.750 - 00:05:05.446, Speaker A: It all blurs.
00:05:05.478 - 00:05:10.938, Speaker B: That was a year and a half into Bankless. We definitely had health care. But yes, I did land on my face after falling off a scooter.
00:05:11.034 - 00:05:17.794, Speaker A: So you never know. Comes in handy. All right, guys, let's talk about Bitcoin. Is it falling on its face? Did it just fall off a scooter? Or is it doing okay?
00:05:17.912 - 00:05:20.270, Speaker B: Up or down? Can we forget about this scooter?
00:05:20.430 - 00:05:21.806, Speaker A: No, I'm not going to forget.
00:05:21.918 - 00:05:25.838, Speaker B: Bitcoin is up two and a half percent this week, so it stayed on the scooter.
00:05:25.934 - 00:05:26.658, Speaker A: Happy music.
00:05:26.744 - 00:05:33.926, Speaker B: Yeah, it started the week at $16,500, ending the week at $17,000, up two and a half percent. Nice job.
00:05:33.948 - 00:05:39.202, Speaker A: Bitcoin and ETH this week. What's? It got a motorized scooter. It's like a moped scooter.
00:05:39.266 - 00:05:48.554, Speaker B: God damn it. Ether is up 6% on the week. Started the week at one $200, ending the week at one $275 6%.
00:05:48.752 - 00:05:59.166, Speaker A: You know what? David's so tempted to call the bottom. He's so tempted right now to be like, ryan, we're never going to triple digits, and the last seven days proves it. Aren't you? I'm not just reading your mind.
00:05:59.268 - 00:06:14.354, Speaker B: God, I would love to be able to call the fact that we're not going back to triple digits. I don't have complete confidence. Well, it's going to be a long 2023 and it's going to be crabbish. Yeah, I don't know.
00:06:14.472 - 00:06:14.754, Speaker A: Okay.
00:06:14.792 - 00:06:16.180, Speaker B: Damn, it feels good, man.
00:06:17.190 - 00:06:43.274, Speaker A: We actually didn't include this in the agenda because it was just a thing, but Powell had a meeting this week and he was super dovish meeting on interest rates. Just like giving very warm signals that we'd reached the top as far as interest rates. And stocks really popped after that. And I think crypto is up as a result of that, too, so that could be playing in anyway, we'll talk about that in future weeks on the Fed watch. But tell us about the ratio up or down ETH to bitcoin.
00:06:43.322 - 00:06:48.480, Speaker B: Bitcoin ratio up 3.7%. We are currently at zero 73.
00:06:48.930 - 00:06:50.702, Speaker A: Nice. This ratio is holding strong.
00:06:50.756 - 00:06:53.790, Speaker B: In fact, it's like it's doing great. Achieving it's doing great.
00:06:53.860 - 00:06:57.506, Speaker A: Is that why so many angry bitcoin maximalists are in my mentions these days?
00:06:57.608 - 00:06:58.580, Speaker B: Is that new?
00:06:59.350 - 00:07:08.950, Speaker A: It gets worse when the ratio is up. Believe me. I think there's a correlation. Let's talk about total crypto market cap. Where are we? Under a trillion. Still?
00:07:09.020 - 00:07:15.926, Speaker B: Yeah, still under a trillion. We're at $890,000,000,000. We gained $20 billion in market cap on the week.
00:07:16.028 - 00:07:18.722, Speaker A: Okay. Not a bad gain. Bottom signals.
00:07:18.866 - 00:07:20.542, Speaker B: Yeah, we got some bottom signals.
00:07:20.626 - 00:07:22.102, Speaker A: Okay, what are the bottom signals?
00:07:22.246 - 00:07:41.194, Speaker B: So one of the big bottom signals is going on is just the absolute wreckage that is happening in the bitcoin miner world, which sounds bad, which sounds bearish, but that's why it's a bottom signal. This has always marked close to or the bottom in previous cycles where bitcoin miners are not profitable.
00:07:41.242 - 00:07:43.806, Speaker A: They are they go to business, right? Yeah. They go bankrupt, don't they?
00:07:43.828 - 00:08:06.786, Speaker B: Many of them do, yeah. So an ant minor 19, which is one of the most recent miners bitcoin ASIC units, one of the more recent ones is now a negative unit at the average United States industrial electricity price. So if you have one of the more modern bitcoin miners and you have average American US industrial electricity. You are not making money as a bitcoin miner.
00:08:06.818 - 00:08:08.150, Speaker A: What do you do? You turn them off. Right.
00:08:08.220 - 00:08:09.190, Speaker B: You turn them off.
00:08:09.260 - 00:08:09.638, Speaker A: Yes.
00:08:09.724 - 00:08:33.086, Speaker B: Right. You also sell bitcoins, by the way, which is what this graph is showing from Will Clemente. Bitcoin miners have been selling relatively aggressively, combined with a hash rate decline, and thus today's, Hash Ribbons Bearish Cross, which is what the graph is indicating. This indicates that we are indeed in a minor of period of minor capitulation. So miners have bills they got to pay. They're selling bitcoin at the bottom to pay those bills. They're turning their miners off.
00:08:33.086 - 00:08:39.106, Speaker B: And these are all things that happen at the bottom. Ryan look at all this red. That's what a lot of red a.
00:08:39.128 - 00:08:44.766, Speaker A: Hash Ribbon Bearish Cross looks like. It looks like a lot of red. What about this one from Zach Bowel?
00:08:44.878 - 00:09:03.962, Speaker B: This is from Zach Vol, who pays attention to the bitcoin mining mining world, and he just documents everything that happens in mining. In a month. Bit Farms pays down $27 million of debt. Cathedral announces payroll cuts. Iris Energy is unable to service loans and unplugs machines. Manitoba. I don't know any of these mining companies.
00:09:03.962 - 00:09:09.014, Speaker B: Manitoba enacts 18 month moratorium on new mining projects.
00:09:09.142 - 00:09:11.286, Speaker A: That's a Canadian province, not a mining company.
00:09:11.328 - 00:09:35.374, Speaker B: But oh, I had no idea. I had no idea. New York governor signed his two year moratorium on new mining projects. We covered that last week. Hydro Quebec, which I'm assuming is a Canadian utilities service, asked Canada Energy to suspend allocations to miners. Oof. Applied Digital launches 100 million dollar fund for distressed crypto assets, including mining stronghold.
00:09:35.374 - 00:09:47.286, Speaker B: Reports a net loss of $50 million in Q. Three compute nor sells mining assets to generate capital, its former lender and a bunch of other mining related topics. But, yeah, just like a bleak month in the world.
00:09:47.308 - 00:09:50.710, Speaker A: A lot of blood in the streets. Mining is it time to buy blood in the streets?
00:09:50.870 - 00:09:54.438, Speaker B: Yeah. If you are a capitalized miner, you are buying blood.
00:09:54.534 - 00:09:59.914, Speaker A: Yeah. But you have to not be out of blood in order to buy. Yes.
00:09:59.952 - 00:10:00.966, Speaker B: You have to have your own blood.
00:10:00.998 - 00:10:03.414, Speaker A: Yes. You need some blood bags.
00:10:03.462 - 00:10:04.070, Speaker B: This is weird.
00:10:04.150 - 00:10:25.634, Speaker A: Ryan selkit's tweet. You say this is another bottom signal DCG's death. So we did a few episodes on DCG. We called this the last domino to Fall, and this is, of course, Genesis that we're talking about. This is Ryan Selkus tweeting. The reports of DCG's death are greatly exaggerated. DCG is fine.
00:10:25.634 - 00:10:38.982, Speaker A: Masari will report tomorrow. I guess they reported today. But what's the TLDR of this is DCG. Actually, maybe that last domino to fall hasn't fully fallen. Maybe it's just wobbly. Or maybe the fall won't be as hard. Is that what we're looking at here?
00:10:39.036 - 00:10:57.614, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm trusting Ryan Selkis's analysis and interpretation of events here, but he's just saying that yeah, DCG got hit, Genesis got hit, but they're going to make they're going to make it. They're definitely going to have a scar, but they're going to make it, which means that the contagion stops there. If that is true.
00:10:57.732 - 00:10:59.518, Speaker A: You think the contagion stops there?
00:10:59.604 - 00:11:00.894, Speaker B: If that is true.
00:11:01.092 - 00:11:32.782, Speaker A: Okay, if that's true, if that's true, the contagion to stop there. I think some other veterans are calling for the bottom, and this is not yet backed by evidence. All right, we're seeing things like bitcoin minor capitulation, which we see at the end of all bottom markets. We're seeing maybe the last of the contagion and sort of a restore of health. I still personally think, David, we've got the doldrums ahead of us where apathy comes into the market we've talked about, but some OGS, some veterans are also saying that this feels bottom signally. This is signally. Bottom signally.
00:11:32.782 - 00:11:35.580, Speaker A: This is Phil Benella, who's been in the space for a while.
00:11:36.030 - 00:11:36.778, Speaker B: Everyone.
00:11:36.944 - 00:11:56.030, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's right. Hey, Phil. Everyone that could be broken has been everyone that could be broken has been there's nobody left to sell and no margin left to liquidate. The risk reward has not been this attractive in four years. It's not easy, but right now it pays to be an optimist among pessimists, by the way. That's what the bottom feels like.
00:11:56.030 - 00:12:11.094, Speaker A: Yeah, it starts to really pay to be an optimist when everyone else is pessimistic. The opposite is also true, by the way. You want to be pessimistic when everyone's overly exuberant and optimistic. What's your take on this?
00:12:11.212 - 00:12:50.338, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is a sentiment that is shared by many people. Chris Berniski recently formally flipped, as in he's saying that he called the bottom. Eric wall, who has had barrick wall as his twitter handle for over a year now, has now become bolic wall. I know it's a meme, but these are veterans that have seen these cycles before, and many people are saying, yeah, just like this feels right. And we can do a bunch of real technical analysis on charts. You can look at minor capitulation, you can try and look at numbers, but at some point, gut feel by veterans is just as valid as a sentiment indicator as many, many others.
00:12:50.424 - 00:12:55.986, Speaker A: Veteran holders, veteran holders who've been through multiple cycles, those are the ones I pay attention to, right? Yeah.
00:12:56.008 - 00:13:34.554, Speaker B: And so, Ryan, you're like, oh, I totally could see just like the the what did you call it last week? Like the apathy bottom where we spend a year of going flat and then people just check out because crypto prices hasn't gone up, and then you get the last capitulation to wash people out. We kind of had that throughout the last bear market. So we had, like there was a 20 the the 18. The 2018 bottom at $82 was like the capitulation bottom, which to me feels like the 875 ether bottom that happened last May. We had a recent bottom at like, $1,100. Ish maybe a little bit lower. So fast forward out of the 2018 bottom at $82 into 2019.
00:13:34.554 - 00:14:03.094, Speaker B: There was like another bottom at like $120 when it got down that low. And then there was the March 2020 COVID crash back down to $80. Briefly, I think without that COVID crash, we would have had higher lows throughout the entire crab market. So $80 in 2018, $120 in 2019. I don't know, $150 to $200 in 2020. But then we had the COVID crash and it took us down to 80 again. So that's why I'm like, David, don't call the bottom.
00:14:03.094 - 00:14:06.054, Speaker B: Don't call the bottom. Don't say rent's wrong. But also, I really, really want to.
00:14:06.092 - 00:14:23.578, Speaker A: Because, look, you could be right. It's just to me, we're in the bottom range. We're in the bottom zone. What I would call for in kind of apathy layers from ETH, something like 40% off where we are now. That could happen. But I'm not one of those people were calling a few months ago for like, $100. ETH.
00:14:23.754 - 00:14:24.654, Speaker B: No way.
00:14:24.772 - 00:14:38.626, Speaker A: We ain't going there. All right? We're too bottomy to hang out there. And so I could see things like this happen. Plus, by the way, David, is, like you mentioned, the COVID crash. Yeah, it's kind of those Black swan events that could pop up at any point in time and take us back down.
00:14:38.728 - 00:14:41.074, Speaker B: But I'm in the bottom zone on the horizon.
00:14:41.122 - 00:15:02.514, Speaker A: Sure, yeah. I don't want to call an exact bottom because I'll always be wrong, and I'd rather let you be wrong on this podcast with strict bottom calls, David, but I'm willing to certainly call we're in the bottom zone. It does feel like this. I think the vets are right. All right, let's juxtapose the bottom signals because we have all time high in layer two. Land, what are we looking at here, David?
00:15:02.582 - 00:15:38.886, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is a pretty awesome chart of the amount of weekly gas that layer one ethereum block space that is being consumed by layer twos. And that chart is so awesome. So if you go all the way back to January 2020, it's basically at zero and it is just a hockey stick up and to the right to where we are in November. And November was a killer month for layer two. Gas consumption seemingly almost doubled previous months of time. So what does that mean? That just means activity on the ethereum layer two ecosystem is at all time highs in a very big way.
00:15:39.068 - 00:15:53.722, Speaker A: This is a long standing bankless thesis that is playing out. Yes. And it's taken a little longer, maybe, than some thoughts play out, but it's totally playing out. Directionally. It's been correct and it seems to be more correct. This is a stat for Arbitrum. What are we looking at here, David?
00:15:53.786 - 00:16:15.150, Speaker B: Yeah, I want to highlight two specific layer two ecosystems. One is Arbitrum, which is at all time highs of unique contracts deployed. So contract addresses, smart contracts, that are deployed to Arbitrum had an all time high apps. Yes, exactly. And then also daily transactions, which is the next tweet. Daily transactions on Arbitrum are also at all time high. Here's Hop protocol.
00:16:15.150 - 00:16:27.330, Speaker B: So, Hop Bridged, $158,000,000 in the month of November, which is up from $98 million the month before. Wow, 100,000 unique wallets. Ryan bridge using hop.
00:16:27.410 - 00:16:45.402, Speaker A: Look, layer twos can be the new centralized exchanges at some level. What I mean by this is like, people we saw these stats last week. People are moving their funds from centralized exchanges and they're going bankless. And you can keep that on Mainet. Or you could go to layer twos. I'm glad to see people exploring the layer two universe.
00:16:45.546 - 00:16:56.718, Speaker B: Here's an app on layer two. This is I believe on Arbitrum. Yeah. GMX, of course, heavy D Five power users will be familiar with. GMX had more daily fees than uniswap.
00:16:56.814 - 00:16:57.218, Speaker A: What?
00:16:57.304 - 00:17:04.830, Speaker B: A layer two application generated more daily fees than uniswap on the layer one. That's insane, dude.
00:17:04.910 - 00:17:11.210, Speaker A: Bears looking into. Yeah. I think we should do a good analyst piece on this on Bankless.
00:17:11.310 - 00:17:19.062, Speaker B: We've had an analyst piece, Ben, from the Bankless analyst. If you pay attention to the Bankless newsletter, you've known about GMX months ago when we covered it.
00:17:19.116 - 00:17:21.162, Speaker A: Are you talking about me? I remember this.
00:17:21.216 - 00:17:22.810, Speaker B: No, I'm talking about you, the listener.
00:17:24.350 - 00:17:27.318, Speaker A: I thought you were calling me out for not reading our newsletter.
00:17:27.494 - 00:17:29.020, Speaker B: I would never do that.
00:17:31.010 - 00:17:36.350, Speaker A: All right. Wait till you see my Spotify rap scores. Anglis is not number one podcast.
00:17:39.090 - 00:17:40.080, Speaker B: Yeah, right.
00:17:40.930 - 00:17:44.174, Speaker A: What are we looking at here? Oh, I think you've got some tea.
00:17:44.212 - 00:17:46.158, Speaker B: I got some tea. I got some alpha. Yeah, okay.
00:17:46.244 - 00:17:50.206, Speaker A: Alpha in a bad way, though. It's like coming from the rumor mill or sources.
00:17:50.318 - 00:17:57.126, Speaker B: Yeah. So you know those tweets that people on Twitter make fun of when they say, here's a big claim. Sources. And then, like, the sources this is.
00:17:57.148 - 00:17:59.190, Speaker A: That you're doing that?
00:17:59.260 - 00:18:21.770, Speaker B: I'm doing that, yeah. A source has so this is a tweet that says, is there a leaderboard for best performing VCs? Multicoin won 2021. Right. Like, they were the best performer in 2021. What about 2022? And I was just looking I just wanted some data because I was curious. So a little bird came into my data multicoin on best performing VC funds in 2021 and 2022.
00:18:21.840 - 00:18:22.294, Speaker A: Got it.
00:18:22.352 - 00:18:45.374, Speaker B: So a bird came into my ear and whispered to me the state of Multicoin. Multicoins fund One, fund Two, and hedge fund spill it. So after FTX, they lost money in FTX after their salana. All the other alt layer ones that they've invested to didn't have great price action through 2022. Fund one is at a One X multicoins.
00:18:45.422 - 00:18:47.250, Speaker A: Fund one is just a One X.
00:18:47.320 - 00:18:55.474, Speaker B: Is just a one x. Yes. Fund number two is at 0.4 X. Wow. So what does that mean? They're down 60%. Allegedly.
00:18:55.474 - 00:19:14.346, Speaker B: The hedge fund is also below watermark. And when everyone was like, oh my God, Multicoin has made so much money. Apparently Multicoin, when they report the value of the fund, they mark to market their tokens, which is a big no no. Apparently in the VC space, you just.
00:19:14.368 - 00:19:18.974, Speaker A: Take the coin Gecko price, you multiply that by the amount of tokens. But there's not the liquidity to actually.
00:19:19.012 - 00:19:43.830, Speaker B: There'S not the liquidity to back it up. Yes. Also there's vesting schedules. So, like, various funds mark to market their tokens with a discount, sometimes heavy discounts, like over 50%. Apparently Multicoin was just like mark to marketing the full value of their tokens without taking in any illiquidity and where you could assume used that to flex it's, like, look how much money we made, even though there's not enough liquidity there to support it.
00:19:43.900 - 00:19:47.938, Speaker A: Yikes. First, I will say, of course, this is sources.
00:19:48.034 - 00:19:49.694, Speaker B: This is sources. Sources.
00:19:49.842 - 00:20:24.590, Speaker A: All right, so this has not been confirmed. Remember David and myself, we are not LPs in multicoin. We're also not journalists, so we haven't done the due diligence. But I could see this being true. What's interesting is 2021 was just an absolutely breakout year for Multicoin. I remember even Ryan Selkis last year, I think multicoin Kyle Simani was on his top people Who've turned things around list. Multicoin in 2018 was sort of on the shit list, really, for the EOS and kind of getting fully behind that and for that kind of tanking never recovering.
00:20:24.590 - 00:20:47.050, Speaker A: And then they kind of had a redemption story. In 2021, looks like 2022 has fully reversed all of that, regardless of what the numbers are. I think that is true. Some of these alternative layer one liquidity investments have not paid off. And this is not just Multicoin, by the way. I think there's a class of hedge funds that have been playing in this space as well.
00:20:47.120 - 00:21:21.558, Speaker B: I'm willing to bet Multicoin got the brunt of it because they were the fund that exemplified the alt layer one trade. Also, I would say when I was talking to the person that gave me this information, my response to them was like, it's crazy how strong the rule of fast up equals fast down. Played out in crypto FTX rouse out of nowhere and became massive and then disappeared in the blink of an eye. Same thing with like, if you made money too quickly, it went away. Ultimately when the bear market turned easy up, easy down. Yeah, exactly.
00:21:21.644 - 00:21:34.710, Speaker A: Do you want to see kind of a jerk tweet? It's a little bit of a jerk tweet, but I think exemplifies it. So fun fact, last year, December 31, 2021, I tweeted this out and this is like alt.
00:21:34.870 - 00:21:37.242, Speaker B: This was of alt layer ones.
00:21:37.296 - 00:21:53.114, Speaker A: Yeah. So I tweet out. I think alt layer ones are largely overvalued. And I was largely thinking of David Luna. I was thinking of avalanche. AVAX. I was thinking of Salana, just that they're overvalued based on their fundamentals.
00:21:53.114 - 00:22:11.430, Speaker A: And then I said, what's your best argument for why I'm wrong? A lot of people gave fantastic responses. Kyle comes in hot from multicoin, and he's like, let's bet on the sole ETH price, end of year 2021 versus end of year 2022. So that would be now. Want to check on that price for me?
00:22:11.500 - 00:22:12.390, Speaker B: Oh, no.
00:22:12.540 - 00:22:13.142, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:13.276 - 00:22:19.266, Speaker B: What is it? It started at that moment. Is this time frame that you're showing on screen, is that the time frame.
00:22:19.298 - 00:22:20.422, Speaker A: Of we are down?
00:22:20.556 - 00:22:46.162, Speaker B: Okay, so we started at percent. So one Sol used to be worth 00:46 Ether. This is like the bitcoin Ether ratio that we talk about at the beginning of the markets, but now we're doing it for Sol, and now it's at zero one two. So that is a down of 00:46 divided by zero, almost four. So ETH is up four X versus Salana in that time.
00:22:46.216 - 00:22:49.394, Speaker A: Yeah. Fun fact, we also didn't actually make a bet.
00:22:49.592 - 00:22:52.050, Speaker B: Yeah, I know you wouldn't make a bet.
00:22:52.120 - 00:23:05.830, Speaker A: You know I wouldn't make a bet. But yeah, that's how confident people were. Look, I'm not picking on Kyle multicoin, but I think the alternative layer ones had a crazy explosive year in 2021 and has basically reround all of that and gone backwards.
00:23:06.410 - 00:23:08.710, Speaker B: Congrats to those who sold that trade.
00:23:09.930 - 00:23:12.266, Speaker A: I think Kyle did. I think he's doing just fine.
00:23:12.368 - 00:23:15.590, Speaker B: Yeah, personal funds. Not the fund, apparently.
00:23:15.670 - 00:23:17.642, Speaker A: What are we talking about next? What's coming up next?
00:23:17.696 - 00:23:58.274, Speaker B: Sorry, Kyle. Coming up next, we judge SBF's ability to spin a narrative at the New York Times Steel Books Summit. We'll judge it out of ten. How well did SBF spin a narrative? We'll also share some reactions from Twitter, and we'll also talk about the Infuria debacle. Is Infura selling your data, or is the Internet selling your data and the Infuria system is just a part of it? We'll unpack all of that and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless.

00:25:26.776 - 00:25:59.182, Speaker A: David I think people listening are like, when are these guys going to stop talking about FTX? And I really want to I want to stop talking about SBF. I want to stop thinking about him, but he keeps coming back and hunt. I was trying to do something else last night, and then he pops on for a 1 hour interview with The New York Times that was broadcast by CNBC. It was absolutely insane. I couldn't look away. We're trying to figure out the psychology of this guy. So give us the context here.
00:25:59.182 - 00:26:05.694, Speaker A: What's this? Tweet from DC. And how should we start dissecting the interviews SBF has been doing over the last two days?
00:26:05.732 - 00:26:33.606, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is a tweet from DC, which is just giving his take on the summit itself. The DealBook summit and the interview. And DC goes. I'm only 30 minutes in, but I want to thank Andrew Sorkin for not making this a puff interview. As we have seen from The New York Times in recent days, I was extremely skeptical up front, but he asked hard hitting questions collected from the community FBS harmed. Good job. So this is one take about the Andrew Sorkin SPF interview.
00:26:33.606 - 00:26:43.002, Speaker B: This sentiment was not shared by everyone. Ryan, you said that it was insane. What part of the summit do you think was insane? Like, the whole thing, the questions. What did you think?
00:26:43.056 - 00:27:24.140, Speaker A: So I just caught, I think, probably the last maybe 45 minutes. I think it was a fully an hour and giving people context. It's called the DealBook summit, right? Yeah, it's called DealBook broadcast on CNBC, I believe New York Times kind of I believe put this together. Professional interviewer Andrew Sorkin and was not a puff. Like, so Andrew was asking SBF questions like, what do your parents think of this? They're lawyers, law professors. How did they react when you told them? He was asking questions about tell me about the drugs, Sam. He was saying, like, where did all the money sleepover? Yes.
00:27:24.140 - 00:27:36.490, Speaker A: At one point he said, looked like a whole bunch of Ritalin. Kids just in a drug filled sleepover playing with people's money. And it was a great interview, honestly, from the interview.
00:27:36.570 - 00:27:38.602, Speaker B: So you're giving a thumbs up to the interviewer?
00:27:38.746 - 00:27:39.102, Speaker A: Yes.
00:27:39.156 - 00:27:39.518, Speaker B: Okay.
00:27:39.604 - 00:27:53.746, Speaker A: Where the weirdness comes in for me is Sam Bankman fried. I don't know how many times he said, I'm sorry, I was irresponsible. He looked like a kid brought into the principal's office. Actually, let me pull up that was.
00:27:53.768 - 00:28:03.190, Speaker B: The pose that he took, too. Just imagine a kid, like, swinging his legs in a chair with his shoulders hunched up, like, looking down at his feet.
00:28:03.610 - 00:28:22.090, Speaker A: Exactly. That was the posture. That was everything. Actually, let me pull up some of my tweets. I said, this conversation is insane. And then he was just sharing everything. I remember that was it's like, TMI, man, you don't have to do this, right? Aren't your legal experts telling you to stop? And then it just started feeling like a full confession.
00:28:22.090 - 00:28:46.850, Speaker A: He was saying everything. It was all out there. He talked about so he answered Andrew's question about what drugs he was using. And then there was this one question Andrew asked him, so what did we learn from this, Sam? What's your future, Sam? And then SBF's reply was, I don't know what's going to happen. A lot is not in my hands. I want to be helpful. I don't know where this all will lead.
00:28:46.850 - 00:29:07.242, Speaker A: It felt to me, David, like this was like a child speaking. It was very childish. I mean, this guy stole $16 billion. What does he mean, he doesn't know what's going to happen? Like, he's going to jail, right. And that's what should be happening. The whole thing struck me as very almost like infantile Andrew speaking to a child coming to the principal's office.
00:29:07.296 - 00:29:15.120, Speaker B: Well, that's what he said. He called it a sleepover. You and your FDs leadership were having a good sleepover for months, and there was, like.
00:29:16.850 - 00:29:24.702, Speaker A: These kind of, like, Golly G type responses, like, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for this to happen. I don't know what's going to happen next. Dude, you stole $16 billion.
00:29:24.836 - 00:30:04.022, Speaker B: Okay, so you said that this was like a confession by SBF. That's not what I saw. I saw what you see. Okay, so if I'm going to rate the Andrew interviewer, I'm going to give him seven to eight out of ten where he approached the right subjects. And he did press. He was not informed enough or chose to ignore things that he should have doubled down on. And if I was going to as somebody who organizes interviews and does a lot of interviews, it felt like Andrew was like, okay, here's, like, six or seven topics.
00:30:04.022 - 00:30:30.678, Speaker B: I have an hour. I need to ask two or three questions about each topic to hit all the topics, and then we're done with the interview. That's great. Forgetting that two or three questions might actually lead to more. And you need to press Sam when you are at the end of their questions if he has not answered the question. So Sam answered the question to the ability that Sam wanted to. And then Andrew was like, okay, he let him get away with he did not press him in the way that I would have pressed him.
00:30:30.678 - 00:30:39.978, Speaker B: So, very importantly, no one coming out of that interview would be like, oh, Sam stole. Like, that was not an impression that you might have been left with.
00:30:40.064 - 00:30:41.862, Speaker A: David, do you see the audience reaction?
00:30:42.006 - 00:30:44.810, Speaker B: People were clapping for him. Like, Sam bankman freed.
00:30:46.350 - 00:30:52.426, Speaker A: So at one point in time, Sam was like, I'm not going to lie, it's been a bad month.
00:30:52.528 - 00:30:53.998, Speaker B: And people laugh, and there's, like, this.
00:30:54.084 - 00:31:20.902, Speaker A: Pause, and there's, like, laughter throughout the audience. I don't know. Some of this is just human empathy type of reaction. Like, yeah, so I get that. But it's also very hard in these interviews because I think you're trying to understand the person. And so there has to be some level of empathy in order to get into the person's mind, and yet you have to hold them accountable. I don't know.
00:31:20.902 - 00:31:37.734, Speaker A: I guess my expectations for Andrew in a mainstream media interview going in were so low that I would even rank Andrew higher than seven or but, like, we're probably largely in agreeance on that. What about the Sam piece? How would you rate that? You said it didn't feel like a confession to you. What did it feel like to you?
00:31:37.772 - 00:32:04.594, Speaker B: I think I want to get to the answer, but ryan but I want to go through through some of the tweets of this specific interview, and then we'll eventually lead into that answer. And so this is the very start of the summit where Andrew Sorkin is applauding Sam for even showing up and giving the interview. And then the crowd starts clapping, and then Andrew's like, Sam Bakeman freed everyone, and everyone's, like, clapping for his bravery of even showing up in this particular.
00:32:04.712 - 00:32:05.890, Speaker A: These are some hardy.
00:32:07.350 - 00:32:11.654, Speaker B: Yeah. And so that's how this whole thing started moving on. This one dude, though.
00:32:11.692 - 00:32:13.830, Speaker A: Do you see this one dude? It's like, crossing his arms.
00:32:16.010 - 00:33:00.226, Speaker B: So Andrew leads this interview with an email that was sent to Sorkin from a customer who had apparently his life savings inside of FTX. And this customer said, can you please ask SBF why he decided to seal my life savings? And SBF replies to this man, and he goes, yeah, I'm deeply sorry about what like, because what else can you say? I'm deeply sorry about what happened. Yeah. Okay. So next part that I wanted to bring up, I did not knowingly commingle funds. So this was, like, one of the first moments that SBF was pressured, and this was when he was asked about, like, okay, did you know that FTX was sending funds over to Alameda? And Sam was like, I did not knowingly commingle funds.
00:33:00.258 - 00:33:01.878, Speaker A: This is a straight lie, though.
00:33:02.044 - 00:33:04.354, Speaker B: This is a straight, straight out lie.
00:33:04.402 - 00:33:04.662, Speaker A: Yes.
00:33:04.716 - 00:34:26.334, Speaker B: And so when asked about where'd all the money go, sam starts with US FTX, which he says, to his knowledge, is fully solvent. And then he turns to the international platform and when he talks about the solvency of the international platform and where all that money went, he starts to talk about leverage and how margin systems work. And Ryan, this is in my opinion, the point to focus on complete dodge. Where is all of the money? And Sam goes to explain to you margin trading and leverage and what that is implied, and we'll get to this again throughout this conversation, is that instead of Sam taking FTX customer deposits and giving them to Alameda, he's saying that Alameda took out such a large margin position on FTX that it wiped out the entire exchange. So instead of an explicit transfer of value from customer deposits to Alameda, there is an implied and implicit transfer of value through Alameda's margin position. Which he claimed that he had no oversight over Alameda and he apologized for not having any oversight of Alameda. But he was unaware of the massive size of Alameda's leverage position on FTX, and because of the way that margin systems work, and this is why he's explaining how margin systems work and leverage, that it was an implicit transfer of funds from customer deposits to Alameda.
00:34:26.334 - 00:34:44.790, Speaker B: But then the interviewer asked like, okay, but you're not allowed to do that with customer deposits because of the terms of service of FTX. And then Sam goes, well that's one part of the terms of service, but another part of the terms of service says, we'll give you yield if you do let us do it. And then he just dodges it. And this is the moment that Andrew Sorkin did not press him on that.
00:34:44.940 - 00:34:54.220, Speaker A: Yeah, I get, yeah, I get it. So Sam's like, I didn't actually steal the money, right? What he actually did was like, I gave it to a friend.
00:34:55.470 - 00:35:12.606, Speaker B: No, I let the mechanism of margin trading allow an implicit transfer of value from anyone who is trading against Alameda to Alameda, which is a lie, because he also straight up sent FTX customer deposit to Alameda, which is the important thing to remember.
00:35:12.788 - 00:35:33.494, Speaker A: There are other parts in this conversation, by the way, I don't know if they're here, David, but where andrew's asking him about the $300 million of property that he purchased in the Bahamas and including luxury apartments for his parents and this sort of thing. He didn't have much to say on that either, but what are we looking at here?
00:35:33.532 - 00:35:48.538, Speaker B: Yeah, so another question from Andrew says, what are your lawyers telling you right now? Do they even want you to be here? And audience laughs and Sam bankmanfree is like, no, they totally don't want me to come here, but I have a duty to talk, is an interesting what.
00:35:48.544 - 00:35:55.870, Speaker A: Is the game here. What is the game? Does this guy think he has, like, bulletproof armor? Has he already purchased his get out of free jail card?
00:35:55.940 - 00:36:04.002, Speaker B: Okay, so do you think that this is an accidental slip up by SBF, or do you think that this is a calculated move by him?
00:36:04.136 - 00:36:48.382, Speaker A: I mean, I would have thought that the Golly shucks thing, it felt very, like, accidental. And the child getting called into the principal's office. Right. It feels very much like that. It gives off that vibe. But I think given Sam's history of masking his appearance and being very cold and calculating about his publicity, I could definitely take the argument maybe I would lean to the argument that this is also part of his plan, that this is also very much calculated, and so this is also part of an apology tour. And he's using this kind of childless, I was too young, got caught up in things.
00:36:48.436 - 00:36:50.640, Speaker B: I'm learning my lesson. I'm sorry.
00:36:51.090 - 00:36:54.194, Speaker A: Yeah, but that can't work, right?
00:36:54.312 - 00:36:58.340, Speaker B: Absolutely. No, because he stole $16 billion.
00:36:58.870 - 00:36:59.426, Speaker A: Okay.
00:36:59.528 - 00:37:17.030, Speaker B: I don't care how old you are. Okay. Just a few more parts of this interview. He was asked about where he got the money from, all the political donations. And Sam Bengman Fried said, profits, his own personal profits from trades. Okay, interesting. We'll go on to the next one.
00:37:17.030 - 00:37:45.810, Speaker B: And when he asked about why he made so many donations to Media, he says, I wanted to support good journalism. Thank you for supporting good journalism, Sam. And basically the summary of what Sam bankman, Fried, said and what he is trying to get across this whole tour of interviews. And this is just the first interview, by the way, he is trying to say that he is sorry because he failed to manage risk. He did not steal $16 billion.
00:37:45.880 - 00:37:52.526, Speaker A: He failed to manage risk, not theft. It was a mistake. We just had poor risk management.
00:37:52.638 - 00:37:55.380, Speaker B: Poor risk management. Yeah. Okay.
00:37:55.750 - 00:38:08.418, Speaker A: That was the first of two, right. The second interview, which I actually haven't listened to yet, David, was on Good Morning America this morning. I mean, he's doing the full apology tour in mainstream media. What's?
00:38:08.434 - 00:38:19.194, Speaker B: This not going on in crypto media, that's for sure. So this is a clip out of the Good Morning America interview, which we're going to play, which I think sums up a little bit of everything. You ready to play it?
00:38:19.312 - 00:38:19.846, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:19.968 - 00:38:32.766, Speaker C: One of the reasons FTX went bankrupt is because FTX deposits were used to pay Alameda's creditors. Carolyn Ellison said you knew about that. Is that true?
00:38:32.948 - 00:39:03.138, Speaker D: Best I can tell, Alameda did have a big position open on FTX. That position, I think, was very over collateralized a year ago. There is a total market collapse, and specifically a large correlated collapse in its assets over the last month and to some extent over the last year that threatened that position quite a bit. And I think that's as best I can stand a lot of what happened there.
00:39:03.244 - 00:39:14.350, Speaker C: I am no cryptocurrency expert, I'm no finance expert, but I don't think you answered my question. I always ask, did you know that FTX deposits were used to pay off Alameda creditors?
00:39:20.610 - 00:39:30.802, Speaker D: I don't know of FTX deposits being used to pay off Alameda creditors. Which creditors are you referring to?
00:39:30.856 - 00:39:41.990, Speaker C: Carolyn Ellison said that you all knew that these funds were used, were put into Alameda. They were the funds owned by your depositors.
00:39:42.410 - 00:39:52.322, Speaker D: So I can't speak for who knew what. A lot of the customers on FTX did have borrowers, either in dollars or bitcoin or euros.
00:39:52.386 - 00:40:04.558, Speaker C: But as you know, the FTX terms of service tell the people who signed up none of the digital assets in your account are the property of, or shall be or may be loaned to FTX trading. But you're saying that happened.
00:40:04.644 - 00:40:20.750, Speaker D: My understanding is a few things happen. The first is there is a margin trading facility on FTX by which users can lend out funds, by which other users borrow funds. And so there are explicit cases where there is margin extended, where there is borrow lending.
00:40:20.830 - 00:40:29.830, Speaker C: If Alameda is borrowing the money that belongs to FTX depositors, that's a bright red line, isn't it?
00:40:29.900 - 00:40:35.638, Speaker D: There are a lot of cases where that's actually explicitly part of the programs and that are not here.
00:40:35.724 - 00:40:41.260, Speaker C: It says that the digital assets may not be loaned to FTX trading. They can't be loaned out.
00:40:47.790 - 00:40:57.406, Speaker D: There existed a borrowed lending facility on FTX, and I think that's probably covered, I don't remember exactly where, but somewhere else in the terms of service.
00:40:57.508 - 00:41:01.502, Speaker C: But they'd have to approve of that. They're saying they didn't approve of it here. They're saying you approved of it.
00:41:01.556 - 00:41:21.682, Speaker D: If you rewind to the beginning of FTX, where some customers were, I think, in line with sort of existing relationships that they've had, at least in some cases, wiring money straight to Alameda research in order to trade on FTX.
00:41:21.826 - 00:41:28.002, Speaker C: So you do know, and you did know that FTX deposits were being funneled to Alameda.
00:41:28.146 - 00:41:35.354, Speaker D: So I was vaguely aware that that was how some wires were being sent in the first place.
00:41:35.552 - 00:41:37.850, Speaker C: Didn't that set off alarm bells in your head?
00:41:38.000 - 00:42:11.798, Speaker D: So there are a lot of people who are involved in that process. And look, I really deeply wish that I had taken a lot more responsibility for understanding what the details were of what was going on there. I knew that legal was involved, I knew that other groups at the company were involved, that there were agreements drafted up. But you're ultimately responsible and ultimately absolutely like, look, I should have been on top of this, and I feel really, really bad and regretful that I wasn't. And a lot of people got hurt. And that's on me.
00:42:11.964 - 00:42:13.990, Speaker C: Here's what Mark Cuban has to say about that.
00:42:14.060 - 00:42:14.530, Speaker D: Yep.
00:42:14.610 - 00:42:18.280, Speaker C: He said, if I were him, I'd be afraid of going to jail for a long time.
00:42:22.170 - 00:42:28.970, Speaker D: At the end of the know. It's not my call what happens, and the world will judge me as it will.
00:42:29.040 - 00:42:30.670, Speaker C: Are you worried about going to jail?
00:42:33.570 - 00:42:52.130, Speaker D: There are a lot of things that are worrying me right now, and as best as possible, I'm trying to focus on what I can do going forward to be helpful and let whatever regulatory and legal processes are happening play out as they will.
00:42:52.200 - 00:43:04.342, Speaker C: I do want to move on, but just finally on this, this is really a yes or no question. Carolyn Ellison says you knew that FTX funds were being funneled to Alameda. Did you know that?
00:43:04.476 - 00:43:07.910, Speaker D: I knew that there is an open margin position there, and that that involves.
00:43:09.290 - 00:43:19.660, Speaker C: If she's in court and you're in court and she's under oath and you're under oath and you're asked, did you know that these funds were being funneled to Alameda? What is your answer?
00:43:25.010 - 00:43:30.410, Speaker D: I did not know that there is any improper use of customer funds.
00:43:30.570 - 00:43:35.770, Speaker A: My God, David. That pause at the end, just this long pause.
00:43:35.850 - 00:43:42.658, Speaker B: Remember when we had our interview with him and Eric Voorhees? And Eric Voorhees asked him the Ave question and he had to repeat the question?
00:43:42.824 - 00:43:43.250, Speaker A: Yes.
00:43:43.320 - 00:43:44.754, Speaker B: He has to think about what the.
00:43:44.792 - 00:44:36.614, Speaker A: Hell to okay, but so first of all, good job from these clips. I haven't watched the full interview, but George Stephanopoulos does a good job asking him the same question multiple times. Yes, and I think this is what a good journalist does. But what is Sam thinking going, this has a different flavor than kind of the childish kid in the principal's office. This has the flavor of somebody who's, I guess, on the stand and there's a prosecutor ask them questions, and this person has no idea what they're going to like, has not prepared at all, has not rehearsed. This is why it's also hard for me to believe that this is all it just feels so amateur hour, David. It is hard for me to believe that this is all kind of contrived from this mastermind of PR who knows how to get out of this.
00:44:36.614 - 00:44:55.034, Speaker A: I can't believe anybody sitting watching this would come away from this thinking, yeah, Sam's innocent. He didn't mean to. It's just poor risk management gone wrong. This has to be just him failing on the apology tour. This is just like an embarrassing moment, isn't it?
00:44:55.072 - 00:45:28.674, Speaker B: You would hope so. Other people have tweeted out that they totally believe him, which we will get there. So we'll go to some of the reactions on Twitter to get people's reactions to this interview lefteris tweets out a man stole $10 billion FTX just got interviewed and portrayed almost as a victim and got applause at the end, still free and fine. Aaron Schwartz, who downloaded academic journals to share with the world, got $1 million in fines and 35 years in prison. This will lead him to take his own life okay, so Left Harris not taking any shit, saying that this interview was a bunch of BS. Bill Ackman. Bill Ackman.
00:45:28.674 - 00:45:53.440, Speaker B: Who is Bill Ackman? Bill Ackman is an American Billionaire investor and a hedge fund manager, founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management. He tweets out call me crazy, but I think SBF is telling the truth. And SBF replies on Twitter. I deeply appreciate that I messed up. I'm going to do everything I can to make it right, even though I know, I knew it might never be enough. To which I replied WTF is going.
00:45:55.250 - 00:45:57.566, Speaker A: Can'T I'm sorry your way out of this? Can you?
00:45:57.668 - 00:46:03.470, Speaker B: Mike Dudas, who tweets out call me crazy, but I think SBF is a pathological liar.
00:46:04.690 - 00:46:06.110, Speaker A: Two contrasting points.
00:46:06.260 - 00:46:06.990, Speaker B: Those are different.
00:46:07.060 - 00:46:13.282, Speaker A: Yeah, he's telling the truth. Mike Dudas says he's a pathological liar. What else we got?
00:46:13.336 - 00:46:28.150, Speaker B: Mike Novograt says it was delusional. Let's be really clear. Sam was delusional about what happened and his culpability in it. He needs to be prosecuted. He will spend time in jail. And it wasn't just Sam. You don't pull this off with one person.
00:46:28.150 - 00:46:52.970, Speaker B: Really good point. I think we haven't emphasized that point enough. Other people also need to go to jail, not just Sam. And then here is the point that I think really drives this home. This is from Nick Carter. Sam isn't behaving like a renegade who is ignoring the advice of his lawyers. He is behaving like he has a world class cris management firm and legal team constructing a very specific and deliberate public narrative.
00:46:52.970 - 00:46:55.860, Speaker B: I think that is my take as well.
00:46:56.710 - 00:47:04.942, Speaker A: How so? Nick thinks that he is really playing 40 chess here. Yes, but it looks like he is just playing checkers, just doing a portrait.
00:47:05.006 - 00:47:06.494, Speaker B: And that is another roles.
00:47:06.542 - 00:47:06.802, Speaker A: Right?
00:47:06.856 - 00:47:13.334, Speaker B: That is the take is like he is actually playing 40 chess. But when you look at him and like, oh, this guy, he's like he.
00:47:13.372 - 00:47:18.994, Speaker A: Saw to garner the sympathy, I think so. How does that work in a court of law where you have prosecutors and.
00:47:19.052 - 00:47:22.090, Speaker B: I think they are working the court of public opinion.
00:47:22.590 - 00:47:27.660, Speaker A: Why does that matter? Well, that's not running for a political office.
00:47:28.910 - 00:47:30.170, Speaker B: I think it matters.
00:47:30.590 - 00:47:35.398, Speaker A: I think it matters. We'll see how this pays off for him. What's this? Take from Bellagi.
00:47:35.414 - 00:48:10.102, Speaker B: This is Bellagi saying jurisdiction isn't why SBF is getting kidch gloves. Remember, the US got a satellite state to throw Alexey Perzev in jail without charges for protecting privacy, which happened in two days. So they'd lean on the Bahamas if they wanted to, they just don't want to. Here is, I think, Ryan, what could be the most egregious headline I have ever seen about this whole debacle out of Bloomberg. Sam Bakeman Fried fooled a lot of people, but not Se Chairman Gary Gensler, whose warnings about risk and lack of regulation were well founded.
00:48:10.246 - 00:48:18.822, Speaker A: Absolutely f off coming out of Bloomberg. All right. Was this written by Gensler? Like Gensler's pseudonym. Max Chafkin.
00:48:18.886 - 00:48:19.900, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
00:48:20.350 - 00:48:20.934, Speaker A: Incredible.
00:48:20.982 - 00:48:31.914, Speaker B: Gary Gensler called FTX is the worst headline, but he was sitting in a room. He had meetings with FTX executives. It's infuriating, dude.
00:48:32.042 - 00:49:04.806, Speaker A: That is the worst opinion. I don't know whether this is SBF's, incompetence, or if he really is playing 40 chess, but I know that Gary Gensler did not, was not the one that was to be listened to in this fiasco. All right, so this is turning into a movie series already a miniseries on Amazon. Directors are bringing the FTX story. I don't know if that'll bring any truth uncover anymore. Also, I think we have to get to kind of our second story. Well, SBF is hitting the news circuit going on Good Morning America, giving these interviews.
00:49:04.806 - 00:49:32.782, Speaker A: More of the contagion is being felt. Of course, we know Blockfly was in a bad state when it paused withdrawals after the collapse of FTX. They have now announced and filed papers for Chapter Eleven bankruptcy. What this means, David, is if you have funds in Blockfly, unfortunately, you're not likely to get them out anytime soon. You'll have to go through the legal process. It'll be sort of a celsius style of thing. And this is a shame.
00:49:32.782 - 00:50:03.934, Speaker A: I mean, we were just talking to Saga and Jetty from Breaking Points podcast, by the way. That episode's coming out on Monday, he had funds in BlockFi. This is sort of someone who's crypto adjacent, but supportive of the industry. And he had some funds in BlockFi and was affected by this. A lot of people affected by this. You know, what's crazy here, too, David, is if you recall, of course, BlockFi had gotten in dire straits during three years capital, and the terror collapsed. Then FTX came, bailed them out.
00:50:03.934 - 00:50:06.254, Speaker A: This was their lifeline, David. Good guy.
00:50:06.292 - 00:50:07.374, Speaker B: Sam. Comes again.
00:50:07.492 - 00:50:11.802, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you know what that bailout was based on? The FTX bailout.
00:50:11.866 - 00:50:13.054, Speaker B: What do you mean based on?
00:50:13.172 - 00:50:16.814, Speaker A: Okay. It was like collateralized by Robinhood shares. Right.
00:50:16.852 - 00:50:22.034, Speaker B: So this Blockfly bailout was collateralized by Robinhood shares. Walk me through what that means.
00:50:22.232 - 00:50:39.740, Speaker A: I think this Tweet walks you through it. BlockFi is a creditor to FTX that lent to Alameda that led to Emergent, which is a shell company owned by SBF that bought Robinhood shares that were pledged as collateral to a guarantee to BlockFi to loan to FTX that was used to bail out BlockFi itself.
00:50:40.670 - 00:50:41.820, Speaker B: I don't understand.
00:50:42.430 - 00:50:42.938, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:50:43.024 - 00:50:47.302, Speaker B: I don't understand what just happened. BlockFi is a creditor to FTX?
00:50:47.446 - 00:50:48.234, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:48.432 - 00:50:57.402, Speaker B: Okay, so BlockFi is a creditor to FTX. FTX borrowed from BlockFi, and then FTX lent that money to Alameda. Alameda lent that money to BlockFi.
00:50:57.466 - 00:51:07.534, Speaker A: So BlockFi borrowed from FTX, who lent to Alameda that lent to this shell company called Emergent that was actually owned by SBF.
00:51:07.582 - 00:51:13.358, Speaker B: Okay, so Emergent is a shell company by SBF, which is the shell company that bought Robinhood shares.
00:51:13.534 - 00:51:27.782, Speaker A: This Emergent company bought Robinhood shares that were pledged as collateral to guarantee BlockFi the loan to FDX that was used to bail out BlockFi itself. Wait.
00:51:27.836 - 00:51:28.054, Speaker B: Okay.
00:51:28.092 - 00:51:40.182, Speaker A: Pledged Robinhood collateral? Yes. Pledge as collateral to BlockFi to guarantee to BlockFi the loan to FTX. Wait, who got bailed out by BlockFi?
00:51:40.246 - 00:51:48.922, Speaker B: BlockFi gave the loan to FTX, and FTX used that loan money to bail out BlockFi. And that loan was collateralized by Robinhood Chairs.
00:51:49.066 - 00:51:49.854, Speaker A: Yes, that works.
00:51:49.892 - 00:51:56.414, Speaker B: Which owns by a shell company, which got that money from Alvameter Research, which.
00:51:56.452 - 00:51:57.638, Speaker A: Got that money from FTX.
00:51:57.674 - 00:51:59.060, Speaker B: What the shit is.
00:52:03.350 - 00:52:14.742, Speaker A: What. If you don't laugh, you cry. And that's what BlockFi's bailout was based on. That's what Depositors, the hope of depositors was based on since May, June of this year.
00:52:14.796 - 00:52:24.826, Speaker B: Do you think if you can just create a fucking mesh network of interconnected money to the point where all the money disappears because it's out of a smoke of confusion, you can just mint more money that way?
00:52:24.928 - 00:52:25.814, Speaker A: I don't know, David.
00:52:25.862 - 00:52:26.700, Speaker B: What do you.
00:52:28.670 - 00:52:42.346, Speaker A: Mean? Absolutely. And look, this is heartbreaking for a lot of people who are in BlockFi BlockFi depositors. I mean, we're really learning some tough lessons in this chapter of crypto, for sure, but this Tweet is insane.
00:52:42.458 - 00:53:23.370, Speaker B: I want to read this Tweet again. BlockFi is a creditor to FTX that lent to Alameda, that Lent to Emergent, which is a shell company owned by SBF that bought Robinhood shares, which were pledged as collateral to guarantee the BlockFi loan to FTX that was used to bail out BlockFi itself. Okay, so this is the pattern that we saw throughout Sam bankman's, Freed, and throughout FTX empire. We also saw the same pattern with Three Earth Capital maxing out lines of credit using anything as collateral as possible. Borrow everything that you can, create as much interdependent connections as possible, and then you create a super fragile system, and then the thing falls apart. Yeah.
00:53:23.440 - 00:53:24.454, Speaker A: Put it in the pawn.
00:53:24.502 - 00:53:24.579, Speaker B: Everything.
00:53:24.579 - 00:53:31.342, Speaker A: Everything's. Pawned any collateral. We have Robinhood shares at the collateral that backs to buy BlockFi. Can you believe this?
00:53:31.396 - 00:53:38.260, Speaker B: And remember, what I said was the whole summary of what SBF was saying. We forgot to manage.
00:53:41.510 - 00:53:41.906, Speaker A: A lot.
00:53:41.928 - 00:53:43.954, Speaker B: That was the only credit card.
00:53:43.992 - 00:53:59.542, Speaker A: You maxed out your risk, bro. You set your house on fire. You stole from everyone in your neighborhood. I don't know, man. You did a lot more than just not manage risk. All right, that's FDX all right, this week. Maybe things get quieter from here.
00:53:59.542 - 00:54:02.790, Speaker A: I don't know what Sam's next move is going to be. I'm kind of curious.
00:54:02.870 - 00:54:05.398, Speaker B: Jail. It's jail. It's got to be jail.
00:54:05.494 - 00:54:16.062, Speaker A: We did an episode on this earlier in the week, if you guys want to catch that on. The question we posed was, why is Sam Bang Riffree not in jail? I don't think we got a satisfying answer at the end of that.
00:54:16.116 - 00:54:33.522, Speaker B: We did get an answer. We just weren't happy about it. The answer is that he paid the Democrats and the Republicans and The New York Times and all these journalists and all these nonprofits, and now no one wants him to go to jail because if he goes to jail, they'll have to give back all of that money as clawbacks. That's the answer as to why.
00:54:33.656 - 00:54:39.458, Speaker A: My hope is that it's just too soon. That the justice.
00:54:39.554 - 00:54:43.494, Speaker B: Okay, Ryan, that's what I was thinking until why is he doing this?
00:54:43.532 - 00:54:44.662, Speaker A: With the interview tour? Yes.
00:54:44.716 - 00:54:56.940, Speaker B: I was thinking, okay, it's just too soon. People get confused by crypto. They're waiting for the dust to settle. We'll charge him, he'll go to jail. Now with this speaking tour, I have Capitulated like, oh, he might get away with this.
00:54:57.710 - 00:55:02.958, Speaker A: He's talking as if he's got some sort of bulletproof armor, some sort of shield over him, like he's got the.
00:55:02.964 - 00:55:05.840, Speaker B: Master, and some people are letting him do that.
00:55:07.650 - 00:55:14.990, Speaker A: Okay, we'll see how this emerges. I, for one, would be happy not to have to think about him for at least a day.
00:55:15.060 - 00:55:16.510, Speaker B: Don't hold your breath.
00:55:16.930 - 00:55:22.994, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about MetaMask privacy stuff. What is going on in this world? That was an issue last week as well. Tell us. Yeah.
00:55:23.032 - 00:56:15.730, Speaker B: Okay, so I'm going to speed run through this. So Infura and MetaMask got into a bunch of public heat on Twitter because it was reported that MetaMask was reporting users'ip addresses and mapping them to their Ethereum wallets, which and the reason why it was MetaMask was because actually, it's infira because when you make a transaction through MetaMask, it routes it through an infira node. Doesn't have to, but that's the default. And then people okay, well, Infira is the one that's mapping IP addresses to MetaMask users. What the hell? Why are you guys doing this? And then both Joseph Lubin put out a Tweet thread providing a bunch of clarity on this, but I actually felt that it was Dan Finley's Tweet threads that were the most helpful. So if you want to get a long form answer, which we don't have time for, there is Joe Lubin's Tweet thread 21 Tweets. That explains it.
00:56:15.730 - 00:56:54.622, Speaker B: And basically the TLDR of this is that no infura is actually doing the same thing that everyone else is doing, which is the minimum amount of user data retention possible. The only reason why Infuria and MetaMask are taking Flak for this is they are also the most transparent about what's going on. To say this more simply, it's not Infuria that's capturing user data. The Internet is just this place that captures user data. There's just like we leak data all over the place. This is what David Trom was talking about, which is why he made this whole thing called traffic analysis. Traffic analysis can map your IP address to your Ethereum wallet.
00:56:54.622 - 00:57:13.110, Speaker B: It's not a result of infura. It's just the fact that Infuria is a part of the Internet. And then currently, I am regurgitating and restating what. Dan Finley. Says who? Dan Finley is one of my personal heroes in this space, so I trust him. So this is me bestowing trust upon Dan Finley. I think he's a great guy.
00:57:13.110 - 00:57:48.798, Speaker B: I've done multiple podcasts with him, and this is what he says, and I totally believe him. So maybe you just have to fact check me. But I think that this is kind of a nothing burger. And I actually think again, to double down on the point, the reason why people are upset at MetaMask and infira is because they are actually the ones that are the most transparent about what is going on. And so that transparency allowed for this rage to be surfaced. So this was kind of spicy. So this was my crypto wallet tweeting out, which is a MetaMask competitor, saying, angry that MetaMask is going to start collecting even more of your information now, your IP addresses.
00:57:48.798 - 00:58:12.810, Speaker B: We have never and will never collect identifiable information for our users. So use our wallet. And then Taylor Monahan. Now MetaMask responds. Except you do. You have and you will always because there's no way not to don't respect your users like that. You send every user's various on chain addresses, IP addresses, info to mew API, which is themselves blockchain info, moonbeam network, on and on.
00:58:12.810 - 00:58:41.010, Speaker B: The only difference is that you blatantly lie about it. OOH, spicy. And then Dan Finley, who retweets this tweet if you want to hit the back button. Ryan says other wallets are opportunistically acting like their centralized web infrastructure magically, isn't. It is if they have any anti denial of service layer. And who can survive in crypto without one, they're storing data too. So I think the TLDR is like, this is the Meta inferior, is not doing anything that isn't also done by anyone else, and it's also not their choice.
00:58:41.750 - 00:58:59.046, Speaker A: My takeaway is just float around the Internet using a VPN. Sure. And this is less of a problem for you. You have to protect these things at the base layer because assume your data is leaking everywhere. If you want to get super hardcore, use Tor. It's what we got to do right now. David, what do we got coming up next?
00:58:59.148 - 00:59:22.266, Speaker B: Coming up next, we got some really good stuff. Some really, really good stuff, which I'm excited to talk about because that was some bad stuff. The Ethereum Ecosystem scores some huge wins, which we're going to talk about. There's some solid NFT activity as well, going around and bankless. That's us. Ryan acquires a company that helped put $150,000,000 into people's wallets.
00:59:22.458 - 00:59:23.246, Speaker A: Wow.
00:59:23.428 - 00:59:56.374, Speaker B: Good for them. Good for them. We're going to talk about that and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors to make you more bankless. The Brave Wallet is your secure MultiChain on ramp into Web three and is built directly into the Brave privacy browser. Gone are the days of managing multiple wallet extensions that put you at risk of phishing, spoofs and tracking. With the Brave Wallet, you can securely manage your crypto assets across more than 100 different chains, including Ethereum, layer Two, Salana, and more, all without downloading risky extensions. The Brave Wallet is easy to set up and removes the headache of jumping between wallets and extensions.
00:59:56.374 - 01:00:26.722, Speaker B: It's lightweight, but packed with great features like built in token swaps, buying and holding NFTs with a gallery view and support for hardware wallets. But also much more than that, because Brave is shipping new features every single month with a mission to make Web Three easier to navigate for its over 55 million users. Wallet extensions are a thing of the past. So get started with Brave's Web Three ready browser today and experience a decentralized Web seamlessly without all the clutter. You can download the browser@brave.com bankless and click the wallet icon to get started. The layer two era is upon us.
01:00:26.722 - 01:00:53.014, Speaker B: Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day, and we need layer two bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life. Across is the fastest, cheapest, and most secure crosschain bridge. With across, you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across's bridges are powered by uma's, optimistic Oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer two, S and Ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure. And across. V Two has just launched.
01:00:53.014 - 01:01:15.230, Speaker B: Their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency, layer two to layer two transfers and a brand new chain with Polygon all while prioritizing high security and low fees. You can be a part of across its story by joining their discord and using across for all of your layer two transferring needs. So go to across to quickly and securely bridge your assets between ethereum optimism, polygon, Arbitrum or boba networks.
01:01:15.310 - 01:01:26.406, Speaker A: Guys, we have some exciting news. David alluded to it before the break, but Bankless has just acquired a $150,000,000 tool for you for the Bankless community.
01:01:26.508 - 01:01:27.126, Speaker B: We did.
01:01:27.228 - 01:02:03.202, Speaker A: That doesn't mean we paid 150,000,000 for this. All right, David, let's just be clear on that. This tool has created $150,000,000 worth of value for Bankless users, people that are on the Bankless journey in DFI, primarily through Airdrops and other claimable activities. The tool is called earnify. You may have heard us talk about Earnify on the podcast before, I think in the form of sponsorship. This is a tool we've used for a while, and we liked it so much, we wanted to bring it into the Bankless family and give it more exposure, give it more support and scale it up. So a few reasons we did this I can get into those, but give me your reactions first.
01:02:03.202 - 01:02:07.410, Speaker A: David, why don't you tell me why we did this? Why did we do this?
01:02:07.480 - 01:02:24.630, Speaker B: Well, once upon a time, people might be able to infer. I'm a little bit of a disorganized individual, so I had, like, 1012 15 active Ethereum wallets during AirDrop season. And without Earnify, I actually would have missed like, three or four uniswap Airdrops.
01:02:25.070 - 01:02:26.346, Speaker A: I remember this. Yeah.
01:02:26.368 - 01:02:45.642, Speaker B: So this is how this story started. So I was using Earnify to plug in all of my addresses that I didn't want to have to load up through MetaMask restore old private keys. I just had, like, an Excel sheet of my Ethereum addresses. And one by one, I plopped them into Earnify. And I found like, tens of thousands of dollars that I had not previously claimed that I thought that I had totally claimed.
01:02:45.706 - 01:02:46.446, Speaker A: The couch cushion.
01:02:46.478 - 01:02:47.406, Speaker B: Yeah, under the couch cushion.
01:02:47.438 - 01:02:49.294, Speaker A: The uni drop, specifically.
01:02:49.342 - 01:03:07.490, Speaker B: Yeah, but some other ones as well. I also discovered that I had missed airdrops that had expired sad face, which it also let me know and then it also let me know that I had pudgy penguin little penguins available to mint. So the amount of money I got from this thing was a lot. It was insane.
01:03:07.650 - 01:03:17.510, Speaker A: Yeah, it was funny. I remember watching you do this and discovering a tool. This was, like, in April, and it was just like, this is your tweet lmao just found another wallet with the uniswap AirDrop that is keep paying discord.
01:03:17.590 - 01:03:19.978, Speaker B: Two years after the uniswap AirDrop, you.
01:03:19.984 - 01:03:57.282, Speaker A: Were just hitting me with these, like, oh, found another 400 uni. And this is, like, worth thousands of dollars each time, right? Yeah. And so I really, at the time, talked to you and I was like, who built this tool? It's fantastic. I started using it too, and I was like, wow, all of these addresses that I've used, I have Airdrops, unearned airdrops, unclaimed tokens that I can. So I reached out to the Earnify account and said, hey, thanks for helping David find all of his tokens. You guys up for a conversation about how we can collaborate? I was just thinking, hey, we want to give them some more exposure on Bankless. And that's when we met the founder of Earnify.
01:03:57.282 - 01:04:29.554, Speaker A: His name is Dawson. He is a bankless listener from way back, apparently. And he's a hacker, he's a developer, something that some skills that David and I do not have. Turns out he has been hacking at Hackathons last couple of years, and he's won a whole bunch of them that he's participated in. These are like, cryptocentric, ETH centric hackathons. He even has a podcast, David, specifically for DeFi Builders. So we started talking to Dawson and we talked some more.
01:04:29.554 - 01:04:32.110, Speaker A: He's got the original Bankless T shirt.
01:04:32.190 - 01:04:33.458, Speaker B: Before we were even talking to him.
01:04:33.464 - 01:05:06.318, Speaker A: He was wearing know. I know. Anyway, talks went so well, we decided to bring Dawson on as a co founder of this new entity we're calling Bankless Labs. And the purpose of Bankless Labs is to build tools, build equipment. All right? So if you think of Bankless Media, the thing that we're doing right now, the theme for us has been educated. The theme has been education, and our goal has been to bring crypto to a billion users. And we've done that through podcasts, through newsletter, through all sorts of media that we're embarking, and we're still going to do that.
01:05:06.318 - 01:05:31.106, Speaker A: But the Bankless Journey doesn't end with education. It also stretches into equipment, tools. We want to educate and we want to equip. And in order to equip, we need to start building some of these tools for the Bankless Journey. And Earnify, to me, David, is like a top recommended tool. If you're starting your crypto journey, the thing you need to do is get on Bankless, get on some other great podcasts education material. That's the education part, right? Then you need some tools.
01:05:31.106 - 01:05:55.674, Speaker A: You need MetaMask, you need a ledger, wallet. You also need to plug in your addresses in Earnify so you don't miss AirDrop opportunities or other notification events that will happen on Chain, because these things will keep happening. And if you don't have this plugged in, you got to do all the work manually, and that's no fun. So we brought Dawson in, we brought Earnify in. We're giving it some more exposure. We're scaling it up. We're building up the roadmap.
01:05:55.674 - 01:06:02.366, Speaker A: And I could not be more excited to bring tools into the Bankless Journey as is.
01:06:02.388 - 01:06:24.454, Speaker B: A there's there's a lot of potential here, which I mean, we'll refrain from turning this into a massive ad for Earnify, although you should put your Ethereum address into Earnify because it's an email notification service. You put your address in if a new AirDrop, new event happens that you can claim, it will email you. So the whole thing is that it saves you time. Go click my meme, because I think my meme's really good.
01:06:24.572 - 01:06:26.194, Speaker A: Oh, which one yours?
01:06:26.242 - 01:06:35.914, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah, that one. So this is Rick and Morty. What is my purpose? Meme? What is my purpose? You find me money. That's the pitch. You find users money.
01:06:36.112 - 01:06:46.014, Speaker A: You always have this weird relationship with robots, David, and I'm not always comfortable with okay, they're not just built to serve you, all right? They could be your friends, too. This is my meme, by the way, that got forced to the bottom of the post.
01:06:46.052 - 01:06:49.022, Speaker B: This little friend, bro. I don't know what that meme is.
01:06:49.156 - 01:07:06.510, Speaker A: It's great. Anyway, guys, if you want to join the journey with us, go try out Earth, put some ETH addresses in. It's free if you want to scale that up, cover more addresses and get some of the premium Airdrops. So check that out. And we're releasing a whole bunch more in the coming weeks. Super excited to do that. David.
01:07:06.510 - 01:07:15.414, Speaker A: Some other stuff is getting released during this bear market. What is this? From Casa. I would classify this as an Ethereum win. Maybe give us context here.
01:07:15.452 - 01:07:41.550, Speaker B: There's three big wins that we're about to go through, which are infrastructure that has previously been specific to other ecosystems, which are now opening the doors to Ethereum. So this is Casa, which is a key management system. It's like a multi SIG system on training wheels. So think like Gnosis but with humans on the other end to kind of white glove your support. There's different tiers that you can access. There's, of course, free. There's an iPhone app.
01:07:41.550 - 01:08:11.858, Speaker B: There's like a cheap $120 a year one. There's like more expensive ones, but is it various? Just like, help to self custody your assets in a highly secure way. So it's like white glove Fort Knox services. Anyways, Casa has always been very highly regarded in the Bitcoin ecosystem as just really, really good product. And now Ethereum support is coming soon. So that's very exciting for the Ethereum world. This is a company that's been around for a very long time, very reputable.
01:08:11.858 - 01:08:16.250, Speaker B: People love it. And now we get all of their products and services for Ethereum, which is amazing.
01:08:16.320 - 01:08:24.542, Speaker A: That's a big step for them. I know Jameson Lopp has been a big Bitcoin advocate and pretty critical of Ethereum. And he, I believe, is a co founder behind this as well.
01:08:24.596 - 01:08:46.050, Speaker B: Yeah. And that is just the first. So we're off to the second. Phantom wallet out of Solana is now coming to Ethereum. And like a lot of people, when they say, what do you like so much about Solana? They say the transaction times and Phantom Wallet. Phantom Wallet is great. Well, Phantom Wallet is now also coming to Ethereum and Polygon at the same time.
01:08:46.050 - 01:09:09.862, Speaker B: So that is now a new wallet inside the Ethereum ecosystem to add to the competition sphere, which is very much needed. And also Trader Joe out of avalanche. Avalanche's biggest decks. Yeah, this is like the uniswap of Avalanche is now deploying on Arbitrum. So, you know, the whole idea, Ryan, that we had during the alt layer one summer, that all alt layer ones will just become roll ups on Ethereum.
01:09:10.006 - 01:09:10.874, Speaker A: Yes, I remember that.
01:09:10.912 - 01:09:44.066, Speaker B: That might not play out, but all alt layer one applications might instead deploy on layer twos on Ethereum because that is what we are seeing here. So I'm sure Trader Joe on Avalanche is not going anywhere, but they are also definitely coming to Arbitrum. So congratulations to the Trader Joe team for making the break into the Ethereum ecosystem. Yeah. Okay, so on to new subjects. We were talking about Ethereum censorship in the last week, earlier or earlier this week, what's it called? Flashbots Open sourced their block building services, their block building software. So many more people can build blocks.
01:09:44.066 - 01:10:33.350, Speaker B: And that has recently turned over the peak of OFAC compliant blocks that have been built. Even though 79% of Ethereum blocks have previously been OFAC compliant, that doesn't mean that Tornado cash is censored. You can always still get a Tornado cash transaction into Ethereum, but if you're a United States student citizen, you go to jail. Anyways, Flashbots Open source their block building, and we have seen a downtrend in the percentage of OFAC compliant blocks. Cool. Hazu responds to this tweet. This tweet, which is just a retweet of what we're just showing, plus more neutral relayers coming online, which is an announcement out of Gnosis Dao and ultrasound money, plus the adoption of minimum bid, plus existing relays accepting submissions from external builders should make this chart look quite different over time.
01:10:33.350 - 01:10:45.990, Speaker B: And this Ryan summarizes why I've never really been concerned about this whole, like, ethereum's totally censored the amount of solutions that we had that were in the pipeline and in the near term as well, just, like, were massive.
01:10:46.070 - 01:10:47.354, Speaker A: I get so much FUD about this.
01:10:47.392 - 01:10:47.706, Speaker B: So much.
01:10:47.728 - 01:11:08.146, Speaker A: People actually think that ethereum is censoring completely. You can't get a tornado cash transaction through on the ethereum network, which is completely untrue. And I'm just, like I just have stopped responding these tweets because just let time play out and knowledge will diffuse. What's happening with Ave, though? Are they pausing some markets in the DFI side? Yeah.
01:11:08.168 - 01:11:22.210, Speaker B: So remember last week when we talked about the guy that did a short position on curve left Ave with, like, $1.8 million of bad debt, and then Gauntlet released that post recommending that Ave turn off trading on or turn off liquidity?
01:11:22.290 - 01:11:23.382, Speaker A: Just pause them.
01:11:23.516 - 01:11:45.246, Speaker B: Yeah, pause. Turn them off. Temporary freezing the following market so a bunch of tokens are no longer acceptable collateral on aave YFI CRV ZRX mana, one inch bat, ample rye LUSD staked sushi DPI maker MKR actually some pretty.
01:11:45.268 - 01:11:46.714, Speaker A: Big why are all these things frozen?
01:11:46.762 - 01:11:54.570, Speaker B: They're just not liquid enough. When you were at the bottom of a bear market, you are also at all time lows in liquidity.
01:11:54.650 - 01:11:59.218, Speaker A: It's just a risk parameter that governance tweaks up and down. So they're freezing it now, and I'm.
01:11:59.224 - 01:12:03.006, Speaker B: Sure they'll turn them back on as they become more adopted, more liquid, et cetera, et cetera.
01:12:03.118 - 01:12:15.250, Speaker A: Remind people that's designed in the protocol is supposed to function that way. And I'm glad governance is being proactive about that. David, let's talk about NFT stuff. Some collectibles first. Got to talk about the bankless collectibles.
01:12:15.330 - 01:12:17.750, Speaker B: We are just shipping some cool stuff, man.
01:12:17.820 - 01:12:30.220, Speaker A: Our second collectible is coming out tomorrow. The first was the SBF versus Voorhees debate. David, do you want to tease what the newest bankless collectible is? Which podcast is.
01:12:32.510 - 01:12:43.290, Speaker B: Let me let me see. Well, I know you know the answer, so I'll just tease this for the listener. There are two foundational technologies that kick started the Renaissance. Oh, fuck the title.
01:12:43.370 - 01:12:44.542, Speaker A: You broke it.
01:12:44.676 - 01:12:46.590, Speaker B: It's a Crypto Renaissance episode.
01:12:47.490 - 01:12:50.254, Speaker A: David's trying to say the printing press and double entry bookkeeping.
01:12:50.302 - 01:12:51.586, Speaker B: I should have just said that. Wow.
01:12:51.688 - 01:13:09.146, Speaker A: That could have been the riddle. Anyway, you know what it is? Josh Rosenthal. The episode. We are having a Twitter spaces with Josh Rosenthal. We're talking about the episode as we're releasing this collectible. NFT having that tomorrow. So there's also a secondary market where you can buy and sell bankless collectibles that we've spun up, too.
01:13:09.146 - 01:13:15.578, Speaker A: That's kind of cool, doing this NFT podcast NFT experiment. It's going pretty well.
01:13:15.664 - 01:13:18.506, Speaker B: First ever podcast NFTs, and this will.
01:13:18.528 - 01:13:19.322, Speaker A: Be the second ever.
01:13:19.376 - 01:13:19.754, Speaker B: Pretty cool.
01:13:19.792 - 01:13:23.530, Speaker A: We got two now, David. Speaking of NFTs cockpunch.
01:13:23.610 - 01:13:25.866, Speaker B: Cockpunch. My favorite NFT.
01:13:26.058 - 01:13:34.154, Speaker A: Well, there's a date for this, December 7. Now, we had the podcast Tim Ferriss earlier this week, and this is what Brewster looks like. A cock.
01:13:34.202 - 01:13:35.506, Speaker B: Is that what you thought that they'd look like? Right?
01:13:35.528 - 01:13:44.500, Speaker A: Cockpunch looks like ish it's more 3D than I thought? But yeah, that's about it. Yeah. So that's cool.
01:13:45.030 - 01:13:47.826, Speaker B: So that mint is happening in seven days.
01:13:48.008 - 01:14:00.002, Speaker A: Seven days now. All right. Openc says NFT creators earned 1 billion in royalties. That's pretty big, man. That's a pretty big economy for the creators. And that was over the last year. 1 billion in royalties.
01:14:00.002 - 01:14:01.026, Speaker A: That's just royalties.
01:14:01.138 - 01:14:07.862, Speaker B: God, NFT people got it so easy. Remember how long it took us to get $1 billion locked in DeFi? It took us like, two years, dude.
01:14:07.926 - 01:14:11.514, Speaker A: But NFT people are feeling pretty down bad. Even worse than DeFi, I think. Maybe not.
01:14:11.552 - 01:14:13.938, Speaker B: I don't know. We're both pretty wrecked.
01:14:14.134 - 01:14:17.534, Speaker A: All right, moving on. Pudgy Penguins, what are they doing this week?
01:14:17.572 - 01:14:42.498, Speaker B: Yeah, so Pudgy Penguins had a sale in sotheby's, which sell sold out. So ten Pudgy Penguins got sold in a Sotheby's auction for something like $129,000, including the Pudgy Penguin. That is cole's. Cole, the founder. Creator of Pudgy Penguin. His NFT, his Pudgy Penguin, his famous one, sold along with a bunch of other rares I don't think don't test my NFD knowledge.
01:14:42.674 - 01:14:53.094, Speaker A: I'm not with the penguins. I'm not up on it. But telegram. I do remember this. Telegram had a whole network smart contract network that they were launching called the Telegram Network.
01:14:53.142 - 01:14:56.634, Speaker B: I believe it's ton was Telegram open Network or something like that.
01:14:56.672 - 01:15:06.234, Speaker A: They raised like a billion dollars for this. This is back from my circa 2017, 2018 days. I remember this being it wasn't quite an ICO, but it was like it's definitely an ICO.
01:15:06.282 - 01:15:07.118, Speaker B: It was definitely okay.
01:15:07.124 - 01:15:16.586, Speaker A: It was an ICO. Okay. It was an ICO. It's part of the token mania. Anyway, Telegram back doing some crypto stuff. Their founder, CEO. Durov.
01:15:16.586 - 01:15:17.694, Speaker A: Is that how you say his name?
01:15:17.732 - 01:15:19.074, Speaker B: I have no no idea. Idea.
01:15:19.192 - 01:15:39.800, Speaker A: Okay. He is saying that they are building crypto wallets and it's centralized exchange to prevent things like FTX from happening again. What is this, David? Is this just another pump kind of thing? Nothing really came of the Telegram open network back in 2018. Is this more the same?
01:15:40.170 - 01:16:15.726, Speaker B: When I read this article and the details are more than just the headline, when I read this article, I was like, Damn, what year is it? Turns out that Telegram sold $50 million in usernames using its own chain based auction platform fragment. So apparently the Tawn blockchain is up and running. They're planning on putting a dex on it. And they're planning on allowing Telegram to be a wallet as well. And it's also Ryan, butapida not available to citizens in the don't. I don't ask too many questions. I don't know, dude.
01:16:15.838 - 01:16:33.130, Speaker A: Okay. All right. Well, I mean, think of this as an app chain, I guess that is somewhat censored if you live in the US. Cool. All right, let's talk about Fidelity. This is actually huge news that went under the radar, but Fidelity Crypto is a go. So remember, Fidelity is a $4.5
01:16:33.130 - 01:16:47.406, Speaker A: trillion firm. Asset management. They just launched trillion with crypto trading. Yeah, trillion with a T. Retail crypto trading. This is Fidelity and they're doing it now when the rest of the world hates crypto. Why is this a big deal?
01:16:47.428 - 01:17:12.002, Speaker B: David well, just because of that $4.5 trillion amount. But it's one of the big signs of just, like, the correct amount of adoption, the best kind of adoption that you could hope for. Fidelity, they've been pro crypto for a very long time, mostly pro Bitcoin recently pro ethereum, but now they're also pro retail, which we love. So nice job, Crypto. Nice job, Fidelity Crypto.
01:17:12.146 - 01:17:33.114, Speaker A: I've really liked their strategy. It's kind of like the tortoise type strategy, but they're slow and steady and they do things very methodically, very carefully and very but they're there. I mean, they're an old institution that's been at the forefront at some level and certainly leading their peers. Really cool to see. Also, Binance getting into the proof of reserve game a little bit more. What's this?
01:17:33.152 - 01:18:22.026, Speaker B: David yeah, Binance released their proof of reserves. I asked Nicarter hey, Nicarter, who's like the king of proof of reserves, can you give me a comment as to how good this system is? He told me that he is writing an article about it. But Finance is not the only proof of reserve system that got announced. Oh, by the way, the Finance Proof of reserve system claims that they have 582,000 Bitcoin in reserve with only a liability set of 575,000, giving Finance a margin of over 6000 Bitcoins. Cool. BitMEX produced a proof of liability system, meaning that if you are a user of BitMEX and you've deposited Bitcoin, you can get a cryptographic assurance that your deposit is accounted for in the overall liability of the system. Which means that all you have to do is cross reference how much liabilities they have, which how much Bitcoins they have.
01:18:22.208 - 01:18:52.342, Speaker A: So cool. I like this market pressure. Centralized exchanges are like, oh, crap, we better put our proof of reserves solution in place right now. And proof of liabilities. Meanwhile, centralized exchanges are also the ones still with money anyway are buying things. This is Binance launching a $1 billion raise for a crypto recovery fund to buy troubled assets. Going to be a lot of troubled assets we get through this bear market and this crypto winter, and Binance wants to snap up a whole bunch of them a billion dollars to duel out, it looks like.
01:18:52.396 - 01:19:03.690, Speaker B: Well, yeah. So a bunch of startups, a bunch of funds, a bunch of it's just everything. Lots of money in FTX, right? And so Binance says, hey, we've got a billion dollars. If you're in trouble, we'll strike a deal with you. That's what that is.
01:19:03.760 - 01:19:10.794, Speaker A: It's not just finance, it's jump cryptos in here. Polygon Ventures, Aptos labs. Interesting group of collaborators, everyone.
01:19:10.832 - 01:19:37.478, Speaker B: It's like a freeding frenzy of like fire cell stuff. Some sad news over at Kraken, they are laying off about 30% of their staff, about 1100 people. Wow, that is a big staff because of market conditions. So that's sad and unfortunate. But there's also some fantastic severance. So they're also paying 16 weeks of base pay performance bonuses as determined by managers and also four months of health care benefits. So doing it responsibly, that's the way.
01:19:37.484 - 01:19:47.698, Speaker A: It should be done. Imagine FTX employees right now, they don't have any healthcare. Yeah, on the releases side, Uniswap just released a big NFT aggregator.
01:19:47.794 - 01:19:56.282, Speaker B: No. So actually this got released a while ago. Now it's finally live. So we actually did a State of the Nation with Hayden forever ago about this. I guess it took longer to actually.
01:19:56.336 - 01:19:57.478, Speaker A: Are you talking about Genie?
01:19:57.574 - 01:19:58.458, Speaker B: Genie, yeah.
01:19:58.544 - 01:19:59.770, Speaker A: They purchased genie, right?
01:19:59.840 - 01:20:18.180, Speaker B: Purchased Genie. And now NFTs are live on Uniswap, the exchange. So you can trade NFTs across marketplaces. Also if you are a historical Genie user, you are airdropped $5 million. I bet you. You should probably put in your Ethereum address into Earnify to check that if you are or not.
01:20:19.750 - 01:20:21.620, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Very cool.
01:20:22.310 - 01:20:24.894, Speaker B: I think that was a great meme, dude.
01:20:24.942 - 01:20:26.290, Speaker A: Okay, what's this meme?
01:20:27.190 - 01:20:39.958, Speaker B: This is the Bane versus I don't know with the guy in the pink. What that is. It's just like a face off between two entities who are doing the same pose and Bane's bear market. And this guy in like this pink spandex suit is like yeah, but NFTs.
01:20:39.974 - 01:21:10.954, Speaker A: On Uniswap not going to reverse the bear market. Sorry guys, it's still pretty cool. Building through the bear stripe also enabled Fiat to crypto onramp and Stripe is absolutely massive. Just like an API that powers so many things. Actually powers the bankless membership on substack as well. And so this is a big deal. Allows customers to buy crypto, convert directly from crypto to Fiat and make payments through have had.
01:21:11.012 - 01:21:16.334, Speaker B: We had conversations with the founder of Stripe to come on Bankless to talk about this, but then FTX happened so we had to reschedule them. Sad.
01:21:16.382 - 01:21:31.750, Speaker A: Yeah, they'll be on soon ledger doing debit cards. Reminder Ledger is a sponsor of the Bankless podcast. But we are talking about this because they have rolled out a Crypto life debit card across the UK and Europe. What is this thing going to be?
01:21:31.900 - 01:21:40.060, Speaker B: Pretty much explains itself. You got a debit card, it's got crypto in the back. As you swipe your debit card you spend your crypto that is loaded up in your ledger crypto life.
01:21:40.830 - 01:21:47.598, Speaker A: You have to move your ledger wallet to this temporary place in order to kind of load front load your debit card.
01:21:47.684 - 01:21:49.518, Speaker B: You do have to do yeah, at.
01:21:49.524 - 01:21:56.270, Speaker A: Least you don't have to trust a bank, though. It's very important till the end stage. Well, speaking of uniswap earlier, they're still hiring, David.
01:21:56.350 - 01:21:59.010, Speaker B: Yeah, because they need to hire NFT people now. That's right.
01:21:59.080 - 01:22:14.386, Speaker A: It's jobs time. All right. Bankless jobs, board, bankless palette.com. We've got a Uniswap Labs developer relations lead. We've got a uniswap labs, senior frontend engineer. We've got somebody from Rabbit Hole business operations and strategy. Dottie Land, senior blockchain engineer.
01:22:14.386 - 01:22:18.742, Speaker A: Diagram Ventures MakerDAO needs some people. Oh, look, Earnify needs some people too. Yes.
01:22:18.796 - 01:22:19.218, Speaker B: Weird.
01:22:19.314 - 01:22:29.814, Speaker A: Bankless Labs is hiring full stack engineers and senior backend engineers. Check out all of those jobs at the Bankless Jobs site. Bankless palette.com slash jobs. All right, David, what's coming up next?
01:22:29.852 - 01:22:51.534, Speaker B: Man coming up next, we got questions from the nation. Just one this week. Also, some hot takes on crypto, Twitter, and also, of course, what Ryan and I are bullish on. And I think one of the better memes of the week that we've had in a very long time. So all of this and more coming up right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you. Go, bankless, how many total Airdrops have you gotten? This last bull market had a ton of them. Did you get them all? Maybe you missed one.
01:22:51.534 - 01:23:14.810, Speaker B: So here's what you should do. Go to Earnify and plug in your Ethereum wallet. And Earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed Airdrops that you can get. And it also does poaps and mintable NFTs any kind of money that your wallet can claim. Earnify will tell you about it. And you should probably do it now because some Airdrops expire. And if you sign up for Earnify, they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new AirDrop for it to make sure that you never lose an AirDrop ever again.
01:23:14.810 - 01:23:54.422, Speaker B: You can also upgrade to Earnify premium to unlock access to Airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets. And for just under $21 a month, it probably pays for itself with just one AirDrop. So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get. That's Earni fi and make sure you never lose another AirDrop. If you've been listening to Bankless, you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis. The idea that Blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus, allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves. And Fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry by supporting parallel transaction execution, fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web3 world.
01:23:54.422 - 01:24:24.954, Speaker B: Fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the EVM with its own Fuel VM, which is more efficient. And optimized, opening up the design space for developers. And lastly, Fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain specific language Sway, and a supportive tool chain called Fork. With Fuel, you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like Validity, while adopting the improvements made by the Rust tooling ecosystem, letting the Fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the EVM. If you want to learn more, there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a Fuel network.
01:24:25.082 - 01:24:50.200, Speaker A: It's questions from the nation time. We've got one question this week. There are a whole bunch, but we had to pick one because we want to talk about something else. But the question was from time three dash at time three dash on Twitter, why did you change your name? This is a very funny name, referring to Sam Bankman Fried. And what the question is referring to is the Bankless Twitter account. Now, rather than saying Bankless for our Twitter account handle, it says Bankmanless, right?
01:24:50.650 - 01:24:51.698, Speaker B: It was a funny joke.
01:24:51.794 - 01:24:56.186, Speaker A: Sam Bankman Freight. We did that, I think, like the day, all of this stuff weeks ago.
01:24:56.288 - 01:24:58.138, Speaker B: Weeks ago? It's been like this for weeks.
01:24:58.304 - 01:25:00.026, Speaker A: So why did we change our name?
01:25:00.128 - 01:25:10.078, Speaker B: Well, it's a funny joke. Yeah. So, like, Sam Bankman Freed stole $10 billion of user deposits, so we changed our Twitter name from Bankless to Bankman List. I thought that was a funny name. Funny thing.
01:25:10.164 - 01:25:16.960, Speaker A: But how long will it be funny? Because it's still Bankmanless on Twitter and the joke's getting a little bit old. But I think we have a problem.
01:25:17.330 - 01:25:20.420, Speaker B: On our head so we can't change it back.
01:25:20.870 - 01:25:28.542, Speaker A: Why? I don't understand this. So Elon took over and we switched our name with the Blue checkmark, which.
01:25:28.616 - 01:25:43.034, Speaker B: Previously were able to change your name as much as you want. But since Bankless is a verified account, you can only change your name like, once a year or something. I don't know. But we changed our name and now we can't change it back. So now it's stuck as Bankman list.
01:25:43.072 - 01:25:50.506, Speaker A: We have emailed support, we have petition people we may need to reach out personally if, you know, Elon Musk tells we would like this change from actually.
01:25:50.528 - 01:25:51.870, Speaker B: We'D like him on the podcast first.
01:25:51.940 - 01:25:54.030, Speaker A: Let's do that first. But also while he's.
01:25:57.090 - 01:26:00.254, Speaker B: We are now Bankman list for the foreseeable future.
01:26:00.452 - 01:26:01.262, Speaker A: All right.
01:26:01.396 - 01:26:03.214, Speaker B: It's not that far off. It's fine.
01:26:03.332 - 01:26:09.010, Speaker A: It's not that bad. But also it's going to be old like next year. This is going to be real old next year.
01:26:09.080 - 01:26:09.890, Speaker B: God damn it.
01:26:09.960 - 01:26:17.042, Speaker A: All right, I think it's time to shout out some of our heaviest listeners this year. David, I know you're a big Spotify user. So am I.
01:26:17.096 - 01:26:17.406, Speaker B: Big time.
01:26:17.448 - 01:26:40.970, Speaker A: Got your spotify wrapped, which summarizes all of your year's listing habits, including podcasts. And we've had some fans that have been fully tapped in during the last year and have some incredible stats to share first, we got our Bankless stats back from Spotify. Apparently, you and I recorded 16,092 minutes of new content last year.
01:26:41.040 - 01:26:44.174, Speaker B: Is insane. We are insane, people.
01:26:44.372 - 01:26:49.278, Speaker A: That's more than 99% of other creators in the business category. I wonder if it's like, we have.
01:26:49.284 - 01:26:52.142, Speaker B: To be in the top ten of minutes.
01:26:52.196 - 01:26:53.390, Speaker A: That's a lot of content.
01:26:53.540 - 01:26:56.250, Speaker B: Do you know how many overdoing this? No. Yes.
01:26:56.340 - 01:26:57.202, Speaker A: I don't know.
01:26:57.336 - 01:26:59.822, Speaker B: Do you know how many days of content that is, Ryan?
01:26:59.966 - 01:27:00.782, Speaker A: No, I haven't.
01:27:00.846 - 01:27:11.590, Speaker B: That is eleven days of content. That means you and I 24 hours days. 24 hours days. That means you and I have been in the recording studio with the studio recording for eleven days.
01:27:11.660 - 01:27:14.530, Speaker A: Dude, this doesn't even count debriefs on the premium podcast.
01:27:14.610 - 01:27:16.162, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, this doesn't count debriefs.
01:27:16.226 - 01:27:19.046, Speaker A: This doesn't count, like, bonus episodes even more than that.
01:27:19.068 - 01:27:20.242, Speaker B: Or YouTube. Only episodes.
01:27:20.306 - 01:27:20.922, Speaker A: Eleven days?
01:27:20.976 - 01:27:22.570, Speaker B: Are you insane?
01:27:23.150 - 01:27:27.046, Speaker A: Wow. All right, I don't know what that says about you and I, but let's.
01:27:27.078 - 01:27:46.786, Speaker B: Talk about what it says about let's not talk about it. Okay, so we put out a tweet that asked for if you got Bankless in your Spotify, raps tweet at us so we could see how many of you listened to Bankless for how long. So here we go. The fake Shippy coming in at number one at 21,000 minutes is Bankless. I don't get the hell that happens.
01:27:46.888 - 01:28:02.006, Speaker A: Okay, we had 16,000 minutes of recording last year, and Shippy listened to 21,000 minutes. How are we listening right now? How did you shout out, man? That means you are listening to episodes multiple times at least.
01:28:02.188 - 01:28:05.720, Speaker B: Yeah. They got to be listening to it as they go to bed.
01:28:06.250 - 01:28:07.698, Speaker A: You have listened to more bank lists.
01:28:07.714 - 01:28:09.000, Speaker B: Than both than we made.
01:28:11.450 - 01:28:14.650, Speaker A: Get this guy a T shirt. We got to do something for Shippy. That's huge.
01:28:14.720 - 01:28:28.618, Speaker B: That's number one job shippy. Well done. All right, let's go through the rest of was that was it okay? We're not going through all of them? Okay, cool. There were so many. Thank you all to everyone who tweeted at us. So many of you listened to thousands and thousands of minutes. I hope you guys like our voices.
01:28:28.714 - 01:28:44.882, Speaker A: Maybe there's an invitation. If you can beat Shippy, tweeted us 21,093 minutes. If you've topped that, let us know and do something special for you guys. That's a lot of Bankless in your ears, David. All right, takes the week. What do we got for the first one?
01:28:45.016 - 01:28:48.598, Speaker B: We got a tweet out of Zenica 33. I know you like this tweet, Ryan. Why don't you read it?
01:28:48.684 - 01:28:51.126, Speaker A: All right. Because you didn't like it. Is that why?
01:28:51.308 - 01:28:52.040, Speaker B: No.
01:28:52.890 - 01:29:04.810, Speaker A: Bear market opportunities from Zenica. Number one, farm all the airdrops. Number two, get familiar with the AI tools. Number three, create content written audio, video. Yes. Yes. Number four, learn to code.
01:29:04.810 - 01:29:14.730, Speaker A: Number five. Join Dao. Number six, figure out how to manage Discord server. Number seven, read about DeFi and layer twos. I actually liked it because of this last sentence. You ready for it, David?
01:29:14.810 - 01:29:15.102, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:29:15.156 - 01:29:18.190, Speaker A: Wealth is sown in the bear reaped in the bull.
01:29:19.650 - 01:29:21.066, Speaker B: That is very metaphorical.
01:29:21.098 - 01:29:25.822, Speaker A: Some things that you can do right now during the bear market to be active.
01:29:25.966 - 01:29:35.102, Speaker B: All of the airdrops that I claimed with Earnify in 2021, I became relevant to those airdrops. I became what is the word? Those airdrops.
01:29:35.246 - 01:29:36.418, Speaker A: You actually earned them?
01:29:36.504 - 01:29:37.202, Speaker B: I earned them.
01:29:37.256 - 01:29:40.614, Speaker A: I got sowed them during, like, 29, 20, right?
01:29:40.652 - 01:29:40.854, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:29:40.892 - 01:29:42.486, Speaker A: And then you reap harvest them in.
01:29:42.508 - 01:29:43.906, Speaker B: 2021 thanks to Earnify.
01:29:44.018 - 01:29:46.370, Speaker A: There you go. Sponsored by Earnify.
01:29:46.450 - 01:29:47.458, Speaker B: Sponsored by Earnify.
01:29:47.554 - 01:30:12.090, Speaker A: This is a vitalik tweet. I want to actually read this out and get your take on this. Okay. So this is vitalik. The notion of governance rights as a narrative for why a token should be valuable is pathological. You're literally saying, I'm buying X because later on somebody might buy it from me, a bunch of other people, to twist the protocol toward their special interests. This is Vitalik saying governance rights tokens are not very valuable.
01:30:12.090 - 01:30:17.506, Speaker A: It's more pathological. It's more kind of a meme. What do you think about this?
01:30:17.688 - 01:30:34.102, Speaker B: I'd like to get Joel Monagro's opinion on this because he was the one that said, yes, the governance of a token is actually the valuable thing. And that's the whole point. As in, if you can govern over something, you can dictate its influence. You can just vote in cash flow what you want.
01:30:34.156 - 01:30:34.422, Speaker A: Right.
01:30:34.476 - 01:30:47.082, Speaker B: So governance is power. Governance, capital, power, these are all the same things. So the notion of governance rights is narrative. I think maybe Vitalik's just kind of being critical of the hand waviness at this. I don't know.
01:30:47.216 - 01:31:17.266, Speaker A: Yeah, I think he's saying governance rights on its own aren't as valuable as some people think that they are. But I don't think that's been the value proposition that DeFi governance tokens have purported it's more the idea, or like the thesis that token holders will vote in cash flows, capital flows to themselves, get a portion of revenue on the uniswap fee. Now, that hasn't quite materialized yet. No, uniswap doesn't have a fee switch on to Uni token holders yet, does it? Yeah.
01:31:17.288 - 01:31:52.606, Speaker B: So continues and says, as a regular individual, pay $500 to get a .1% chance to influence the outcome of some votes is just not a good trade. The only people for whom it is a good trade are multimillionaires and hedge funds. Yeah, but isn't that kind of always the bet that you don't have much say as a smallly capitalized individual and so governance power or the value of governance? As a retail investor, I can't sway Apple governance, but hedge funds can. But that's why the price exists on the secondary market. Anyways, I'm confused by this vitalik take. Yeah.
01:31:52.628 - 01:32:03.762, Speaker A: I do think that governance tokens have a lot of problems. I mean, we had an episode with Hasu where we've recently talked about this, but yeah, I'm not as pessimistic as vitalik on these things.
01:32:03.816 - 01:32:04.420, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:32:04.870 - 01:32:06.578, Speaker A: What's Van Spencer saying here?
01:32:06.664 - 01:32:21.398, Speaker B: Van Spencer? 2022 not the year everyone wanted, that's for sure, but probably the year we deserved. For context, Q Four 2019, Genesis had about $60 million of loans outstanding. In Q Four of 2021, they had about 50 billion.
01:32:21.494 - 01:32:22.246, Speaker A: This is Genesis.
01:32:22.278 - 01:32:23.482, Speaker B: The Company Genesis. Yeah.
01:32:23.536 - 01:32:26.842, Speaker A: 60 million to 50 billion in two years. Yes.
01:32:26.896 - 01:32:47.806, Speaker B: Right. Crazy. And then he continues, we are back to effectively zero CFI credit available in the industry outside of Maple Finance, which is emergent ashes to ashes, basically saying, the mania is gone, the credit is gone, we are at the bottom. This is a bottom signal to me. He's not calling the bottom, but I'm in calling the bottom on his behalf.
01:32:47.838 - 01:33:00.854, Speaker A: These numbers are pretty astounding. We grew from 60 million in CFI loans to 50 billion. And that's just Genesis Market. Now we're back at zero. A lot of things have been washed away, certainly in this market, but what are you bullish on in spite of all this?
01:33:00.892 - 01:33:47.522, Speaker B: David So, DC investor, put out a tweet and said, do you think the people that bought Ether at $120 are inconsolably upset that they did not buy at $80? No. Source me, as in, like, DC one of the guys that was buying the dip with us throughout 2018 to 2020. And so I follow up on that tweet and I say all of my sub $300 buys ether buys, which Ether bounced between 100 and $300, like, four times between 2018 and 2020. So I say all of my sub $300 buys between 2018 and 2020 just blur into that one big dip I bought. And what I am bullish on, Ryan, is that same thing happening all over again. Between one and $2,000. I think Ether will bounce between one and $2,000 perhaps a couple of times over the next 1218, god forbid, 24 months.
01:33:47.522 - 01:33:58.150, Speaker B: But then that period of time will just blur into that one big dip that we all bought as we all stuck through the bear market together before ETH goes to finally $10,000. And beyond.
01:34:00.730 - 01:34:15.434, Speaker A: This maybe this obsession. I don't think we have an obsession. It's just an interesting number. But, like, triple digit ETH, right? Whether it does hit triple digits and you buy at 900 or they buy it at 1200, you're not even going to notice if the price of ETH is ten k. Yeah.
01:34:15.472 - 01:34:16.702, Speaker B: Brian so just buy it then.
01:34:16.756 - 01:34:29.680, Speaker A: Dude. Again, people are going to say, you guys are like, permeables. This sounds crazy. Haven't been saying ten k for a long time. Yes, we have, and we're not wrong. I'm sorry. ETH is going to ten k.
01:34:29.680 - 01:34:59.354, Speaker A: I don't know when, I don't know how long that will take in the future, but I have not wavered 1 minute from that belief. And I remember when ETH was hanging out at 120, people thought it would never hit all time highs again. All time highs being like 1400 or something like this. And here we are, we're already at 1400. We did it over ten X since then. And this is the lower point during the bear market. All right, so anyway, I don't know what else to say, but I think he's totally right in that you don't notice a difference in the buys at this.
01:34:59.354 - 01:35:01.434, Speaker A: So don't time the bottom, I think is another way.
01:35:01.552 - 01:35:02.742, Speaker B: Don't time the peak of bottom.
01:35:02.816 - 01:35:03.502, Speaker A: Obsessed with that.
01:35:03.556 - 01:35:10.346, Speaker B: Just buy, just goodbye. Right? Ryan what are you bullish on Bankless Labs?
01:35:10.378 - 01:35:27.842, Speaker A: David we're doing going beyond education tools for the journey. I think it's really cool to have some more dev talent on the team. I'm really excited about the roadmap that we're putting together for Earnify, integrating that into the rest of the Bankless product. That's cool. It's cool. Building software. David who would have thought?
01:35:27.896 - 01:35:34.214, Speaker B: Two podcasters look at Mean immediate company buying a software. Wow, a software tool. That's great.
01:35:34.332 - 01:36:08.450, Speaker A: I think it's going to be great for people on the Bankless journey and give us some time, guys, to integrate all of these things together. Right now there's a separate membership that you have for Bankless and for Earnify. I mean, we're going to work as we hire people up over the coming months to get this all integrated and feeling really nice and packaged. But already, dude, this tool. You know what's really fulfilling to me, David, is how the one time I've gone to a conference, all of the people who've come up to us and been like, hey, thank you for building Bankless. You helped me on my crypto journey. I got a job in crypto.
01:36:08.450 - 01:36:36.918, Speaker A: I got financially independent as a result of this. I was bullish. And you developed conviction in some assets that did really well and continue to perform. And then I'm a long term holder on all of these things. It's like, I feel like it's value that Bankless has provided the community. And Earnify is another example of this. It's like a way to quantify that $150,000,000 in confirmed airdrops that people have received in the Bankless journey.
01:36:36.918 - 01:37:02.338, Speaker A: You know that thing where we've said crypto pays you to learn about crypto, said that forever. Now we have a tool, we can go harvest these things you learn about on a Bankless. Now you can go pick it up. And to me, that's very fulfilling. Like, I want to grow those numbers. The number of people that have done well in crypto who've gotten on the journey through Bankless education, number of people who have generated wealth from the crypto economy. Those are the numbers that mean the most to me.
01:37:02.338 - 01:37:11.298, Speaker A: And those are numbers I think we can grow when we have these sorts of tools. So I am very bullish on what we are building next with Earnify and everything that's coming with Bankless Labs.
01:37:11.394 - 01:37:29.066, Speaker B: 100%. Yeah, we've been teasing like Bankless 2.0 for a while, and we've started to have some of these things emerge. Bankless collectibles came out a couple of weeks ago. We're now announcing this Earnify thing. We've teased a brand new website. We told people to subscribe to bankless when that 25% off discount happened last week.
01:37:29.066 - 01:37:44.746, Speaker B: But if you didn't, you should have. But there's still more to come. And the cool thing is, all of these things do seamlessly integrate with each other once all these pieces are out. So I'm excited for 2023 as we shoot more and more of this ammo that we have of Bankless 2.0 out the door.
01:37:44.858 - 01:37:46.382, Speaker A: David, do you know what time it is now?
01:37:46.436 - 01:37:47.454, Speaker B: Yeah, it's meme of the week time.
01:37:47.492 - 01:37:53.822, Speaker A: Let's look at the meme of the week. And you are particularly bullish on this one. This is getting ridiculous. What are we looking at, man?
01:37:53.876 - 01:38:07.602, Speaker B: This is an article out of the Wall Street Journal titled, sam Bakeman fried is super jacked and handsome. The FTX founder is super hot. He's amazing and we love him so much. And there's a picture of Sam Bakeman freed is absolutely ripped.
01:38:07.666 - 01:38:08.790, Speaker A: Muscle bound.
01:38:10.650 - 01:38:11.014, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:38:11.052 - 01:38:11.622, Speaker A: Looking good.
01:38:11.676 - 01:38:16.634, Speaker B: Reminder, this is a meme. This is not real. Although, like, to this day, do you even know? I don't know.
01:38:16.672 - 01:38:21.462, Speaker A: That's what's funny about it. I mean, you could actually see this in the Wall Street journal.
01:38:21.606 - 01:38:23.542, Speaker B: All right, guys, this one's kind of egregious.
01:38:23.606 - 01:38:39.614, Speaker A: But stick around, though, for the moment of Zen. Actually, the moment of Zen. Today we are a quick conversation you had with Dawson, who's now co founder of Bankless Labs. So stick around if you want to hear about that. Of course, as always, got to tell you about the risks and disclaimers. Got to say, none of this has been financial advice. It never is.
01:38:39.614 - 01:38:49.910, Speaker A: Crypto is risky. So is ETH. So is bitcoin, no matter what price you buy these things at. But we're headed west. The is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the Bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
01:38:49.910 - 01:38:50.754, Speaker A: Hey, Dawson.
01:38:50.802 - 01:38:51.586, Speaker B: What's Earnify?
01:38:51.698 - 01:38:59.682, Speaker E: Earnify is the AirDrop checker. Earnify is a web3 notification tool that will let you know of all the things you have to go claim for your wallet.
01:38:59.746 - 01:39:01.094, Speaker B: Claim for your wallet? What does that mean?
01:39:01.132 - 01:39:09.670, Speaker E: So claiming for your wallet is things like airdrops whitelists NFT Mints. Earnify will check you for all these and let you know instantly what you have to go claim.
01:39:09.750 - 01:39:10.474, Speaker B: Why do I need it?
01:39:10.512 - 01:39:20.314, Speaker E: You need it because without Earnify, you don't know when you have unclaimed assets. This is tens of thousands of dollars sometimes that are just out there waiting for you for your wallet.
01:39:20.362 - 01:39:22.138, Speaker B: Specifically, how many people use Earnify?
01:39:22.234 - 01:39:26.410, Speaker E: There are over 250,000 people who trust Earnify for notifications.
01:39:26.490 - 01:39:32.178, Speaker B: Okay, so with Earnify, I plug in my ethereum address and it tells me what airdrops I can collect, right?
01:39:32.264 - 01:39:36.990, Speaker E: Exactly. It allows you to do that for not just one address either. You can do it. Up to ten addresses.
01:39:37.070 - 01:39:39.990, Speaker B: Up to ten addresses. And so how much money have you made, people?
01:39:40.060 - 01:39:46.358, Speaker E: There are over $150,000,000 worth of Airdrops that have been found through Earnify since launching two years ago.
01:39:46.444 - 01:39:57.738, Speaker B: $150,000,000. So people have put in their ethereum addresses, multiple of them, into Earnify, and Earnify has helped them claim $1.5 million.
01:39:57.824 - 01:40:01.098, Speaker E: Not just 1.5 million, $150,000,000.
01:40:01.184 - 01:40:07.822, Speaker B: Oh, excuse me. $150,000,000. That's amazing. Why did you make earnify? What inspired you to make it?
01:40:07.876 - 01:40:20.270, Speaker E: You know, I'm a crypto Dgen, just like all of you. I found that I had unclaimed Airdrops that I didn't know about. And so I made this tool originally for myself to check my wallets. And then it turned out that a lot of other people wanted the exact same set of features.
01:40:20.350 - 01:40:21.694, Speaker B: So is it just airdrops?
01:40:21.742 - 01:40:38.642, Speaker E: It is much more than just Airdrops. So Earnify began originally from a hackathon two years ago as the AirDrop checker. And now Earnify has expanded to pull up Tokens NFT, Mints, Whitelists and many other things. Like pull up Raffles for just all the free things that you don't know about yet for your wallets.
01:40:38.706 - 01:40:40.482, Speaker B: So what do I get if I sign up for Earnify?
01:40:40.546 - 01:40:55.534, Speaker E: If you sign up for Earnify, you're going to be able to check your addresses right now, but you will also be signed up for email notifications when you match a new claimable asset in the future. So so this means that when an AirDrop goes live, you can be the first to know that your wallets are in that AirDrop, but you can also.
01:40:55.572 - 01:40:58.330, Speaker B: Pay for Earnify, right? What do you get if you pay for Earnify?
01:40:58.410 - 01:41:13.630, Speaker E: If you're a serious DFI user, you should pay for Earnify, because you'll be able to watch more than just two addresses. You'll be able to watch up to ten. And that means that you will get these email notifications for up to ten of your addresses. So you'll know more about all of the addresses that you have and all the assets that you can go claim.
01:41:13.710 - 01:41:17.058, Speaker B: How is Earnify different from any other AirDrop notification service?
01:41:17.144 - 01:41:43.450, Speaker E: AirDrop is much more than just an AirDrop notification service. AirDrop is the highest quality. There is zero spam allowed. Everything is manually reviewed, tested, and checked to make sure that it's worth your time. Not just your time, but also your money. Because I believe, just like everyone else who is on the bankless journey, that we should stay safe and avoid some of these spam issues, some of these bankruptcy issues that we've been seeing over in the CFI world.
01:41:43.520 - 01:41:45.834, Speaker B: What are Earnify's plans for the future? Is there a roadmap?
01:41:45.882 - 01:42:15.926, Speaker E: Earnify has huge plans for the future beyond just Airdrops. Earnify is going to be checking you for all the things that your wallet can have. So when New NFTs drop, you can be notified of that. When your ENS names are about to expire, you can be notified of that. When anything happens on Chain, you need to be enabled to respond to that with something like Earnify to notify you right away to go take action. Maybe your DeFi loans are about to get liquidated. Maybe the ENS name you've always wanted is about to go up for auction and you can bid on it.
01:42:15.926 - 01:42:18.100, Speaker E: Earnify will notify you of all these things in the future.
