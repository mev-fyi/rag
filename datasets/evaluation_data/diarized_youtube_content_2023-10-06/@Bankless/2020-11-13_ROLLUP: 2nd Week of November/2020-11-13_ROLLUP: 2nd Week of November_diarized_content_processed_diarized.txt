00:00:07.700 - 00:01:13.344, Speaker A: If you are looking for a mobile wallet to hold and access your crypto, you need to go to Argent XYZ and download their smart contract wallet app right onto your Android or iOS device. Argent is the most secure way to hold money on your device while still being able to access defi services that we all know and love. On Ethereum through Argent, you have one tap access to the beloved Defi apps like Compound Uniswap Ave, and you can even invest directly into some yield generating assets right from your argent wallet. Crucial to maintaining security over your assets is Argent's guardian service, which allows you to use a friend to make sure that you can always restore access to your funds in case you were to ever lose your phone or for your device to break. You can also use a local hardware wallet to ensure that you can always restore access to your funds yourself. One of Argent's newest features is their ability to route trades through ten decentralized exchanges, including Uniswap and Kyber, to make sure that you are always getting the best trade on your assets. Similarly, pushing the fold on what we can do in Ethereum and DFI.
00:01:13.344 - 00:02:08.424, Speaker A: Argent has replicated some of the legacy financial services that you would expect from your bank, but put it directly into the hands of the user, such as send limits and whitelisted accounts, ensuring that if anyone were to be able to access your funds in your argent wallet, they could only send up to a certain amount and only be able to send them to approved addresses, which is creating one of the most safe environments to hold your assets in. Which is why people have put millions and millions of dollars into the Argent wallet that they use on their device. In order to see the argent wallet in action, go to Argent link slash bankless and download the argent wallet on iOS or Android today. We're also brought to you by monolith. Monolith is your cool new Defi account, your defi savings account, your defi checking account. Except the cool thing about the Monolith DeFi account is that it gets software updates, right? You actually get to increase the usefulness of this over time. So here are some of the features.
00:02:08.424 - 00:02:49.892, Speaker A: Monolith is a smart contract wallet with a lot of the features that you would expect. If you've come to know Defi and what it is, you can add money to it. You can put that money to work in compound and accessing yield, and you can also swap through uniswap. What was cool with monolith is that they will send you a very sexy monolith visa card that connects to your monolith smart contract wallet on Ethereum. So it's a really awesome tool to live a bankless life with a savings account that gets software updates. So this is something that you're never going to find out in the real world, but you can still do real world things with real money, like buy your groceries. So that's just fantastic.
00:02:49.892 - 00:03:12.000, Speaker A: Coming soon to monolith. Actually, already here to monolith is now you can buy Dai and get it sent to your wallet directly. Right? So it's also being an on ramp, so you don't have to go through your centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini or wherever. You can just go straight from your bank account right into your monolith checking account smart contract wallet. So check them out at Monolith XYZ.
00:03:12.420 - 00:03:20.740, Speaker B: Good morning, bankless nation. We are rolling it up this week. This is the second week of November. David, you ready to roll up the week, my friend?
00:03:20.890 - 00:03:34.616, Speaker C: Rolling them up. Rolling them up. Every single week we take all the information that's happened in the world of crypto. We package it into a bite sized chunk and inject it right into your brain as roll ups do. We're rolling up the news.
00:03:34.718 - 00:03:58.892, Speaker B: All right, so here's what we do. Every week the format is the same. We dedicate five minutes to five topics so that you get the entire week into your brain in about 25 minutes. We try to honor that. We try to keep it to that. So we go to market releases, news takes, and then we conclude with what we are excited about right now. So this happens every Friday morning on both YouTube and the bankless podcast.
00:03:58.892 - 00:04:07.072, Speaker B: Catch it in both places. David, let's get started with the market, my friend. What is the market saying to you? Do you want to start with bitcoin?
00:04:07.216 - 00:04:30.536, Speaker C: Yeah. Today, bitcoin is pushing above $16,000 a coin. There is not much price history above this level. So that is pretty exciting. This is what I'm about to comment is just for today, it seems like ether is taking a little bit of a dip. Wifey is another token that I'm paying attention to that's taking a little bit of a dip. Things seem to be rotating into bitcoin.
00:04:30.536 - 00:04:39.928, Speaker C: We've seen this happen before. Things rotate into bitcoin. Bitcoin pumps. Things rotate into ether. Ether pumps. Ether rotates into Dfi tokens. DFI tokens, pumps.
00:04:39.928 - 00:04:41.692, Speaker C: Today it's bitcoin's turn.
00:04:41.826 - 00:05:04.500, Speaker B: All right, so all of these markets are connected, but sixteen k is pretty like that's a milestone, right? We are within striking distance of all time highs for bitcoin. At what point is mainstream media going to start doing this? You remember 2017 where it was like every day CNBC would be talking about the price of crypto, something. We haven't seen that yet, but we got to be getting close.
00:05:04.650 - 00:05:09.130, Speaker C: Yeah. Nick Carter gave out this line recently. Quietest bull market ever.
00:05:10.940 - 00:05:12.392, Speaker B: That's a good take, right?
00:05:12.446 - 00:05:27.768, Speaker C: I think we're going to blow past previous all time highs and there continue to be general silence. Like maybe some people will start to tap into it. I don't think we're going to see the retail hype fomo until something like 30, 40, $50,000 and it just won't be on people's radar.
00:05:27.864 - 00:05:44.048, Speaker B: That'silly, because people are missing out on, like three to five x gains right there. I'm glad you are tuned in. You're not going to miss out on those gains in crypto. Guys, we are in the bull market. And this is a website I found while we're on bitcoin. David. This is bitcoin treasuries.
00:05:44.048 - 00:06:02.084, Speaker B: So this actually maps out the amount of bitcoin on publicly traded balance sheets of companies. And it's quite a lot. So we've talked about microstrategy before and square before. I mean, it's starting, right? Like, some of these publicly traded companies are starting to put crypto on their balance Sheets.
00:06:02.132 - 00:06:31.980, Speaker C: That's huge, right? Yeah. This is a website that bitcoiners really, really like, bitcointreasuries.org. At the bottom, you see a total tally of 814,000 BTC, just under 4% of the total supply of BTC, although that number does kind of get weighted by Grayscale quite a bit. Grayscale represents way over half of all this, but it's definitely a website to watch. Like Ethereum, we like our ETh locks in DFI. Bitcoiners like their BTC in balance sheets.
00:06:32.140 - 00:06:49.256, Speaker B: Absolutely. And I think ETH will make its way over there at some point, too. All right, let's talk Eth price. You mentioned it. We're at 460 right now. When you're listening to this, it might be either higher or lower, but it's tracking bitcoin just not quite as aggressively yet.
00:06:49.438 - 00:07:15.824, Speaker C: Yeah, well, so it's doing really well. Like, at the height of DFI summer, like DFI yield farming, the peak of ether price was 490. And we're at 460 now, which is a really strong resurgence up from the bottom of the quote unquote DFI crash, which was like, at 310. So ether price action. Super healthy just today, in the last 24 hours, hours, bitcoin kind of has taken the wheel, but Ether is doing just a bang up job. Like, nice job, ether. Keep going.
00:07:15.942 - 00:07:23.116, Speaker B: I've got my tweet scheduled for 475. ETH price is hilarious at 475. It's still pretty funny that ETh.
00:07:23.148 - 00:07:24.204, Speaker C: You got it scheduled.
00:07:24.332 - 00:07:38.472, Speaker B: Well, I mean, what is it scheduled for? I get a notification, 475. I know it's time to tweet. That's what happens. Because it's still pretty funny. Under 500, I think it's funny. Under 800, I think it's funny. We'll see how it goes.
00:07:38.472 - 00:07:59.244, Speaker B: All right, but Grayscale, our friends at Grayscale, whom we are having on the podcast on Monday, when you're listening to this ethereum hit in their ether trust hit 1 billion in assets under management. So they're onboarding an awful lot of institutional investors into ETH. The asset right now, that's got to be bullish, right?
00:07:59.362 - 00:08:19.152, Speaker C: Absolutely bullish. And this is the metaphor that we gave out on the podcast with Michael sun and shrine coming out on Monday, that grayscale is the bridge, right? We are building the arc in DeFi. We are building the arc in Ethereum, but grayscale is offering a fantastic bridge to onboarding onto that arc, and they are being rewarded handsomely for that effort.
00:08:19.296 - 00:08:27.988, Speaker B: Okay, well, let's talk about what's locked in DFI right now. Are we up or are we down on the week, David, in the amount of value locked in DFI?
00:08:28.084 - 00:08:43.740, Speaker C: Yeah, last week I think it was roughly around 12.1 billion in DFI. Now we're at 13.45 billion in DFI. So while there has been, like, that dip in ETH price since the end of DfI summer, you do not see it in the total value locked in DFI.
00:08:44.080 - 00:08:47.240, Speaker B: Up a billion, David, sorry, we just went up a billion.
00:08:47.320 - 00:08:49.112, Speaker C: Over a billion. Like 1.2 billion.
00:08:49.176 - 00:08:54.716, Speaker B: That's huge. Do you remember when it hit a billion? When was that? It's like a blur to me. That was like February.
00:08:54.828 - 00:09:14.916, Speaker C: Yeah. And now we're chalking down, like $1 billion marks in DFI. Ryan and I were super ETH bulls, but we can take away, we can actually extract maybe our bias about ether and just looked at the billion dollars in DFI and tell you that DFI is worth at least $13 billion because that's what people have put in here.
00:09:15.018 - 00:09:31.580, Speaker B: Absolutely. ETH locked in DFI looked about flat. So some of that value is coming from other places. I bet I know where partially it's probably coming from DeFi tokens. I tweeted this out, this was like Friday, I think I tweeted out. Remember yesterday when DefI tokens were dead?
00:09:32.000 - 00:09:33.224, Speaker C: Bitcoin was dead.
00:09:33.352 - 00:10:00.244, Speaker B: One day things totally flipped. I mean, everyone was suddenly after Defi summer super bearish on DeFi tokens. And then last week up till now, we saw a massive resurgence. This is the Defi pulse index, which is an indices of a bunch of the top DeFi tokens. And that shot up almost like it almost doubled from last week to this week. What's your take?
00:10:00.362 - 00:10:46.500, Speaker C: Yeah, we were watching and this story was told by the wifey chart so well, where wifey kept on plummeting and it capitulated down to like 7000 something. Somebody opened up a short at the bottom and then a bunch of wifey community members all banded together to just squeeze that short. And then a bunch of DFI tokens just mooned at this event. Right? Maybe it was related to other factors as well, but YC bounced off the floor at like seven and a half, zoomed up to $18,000 in this space of like 1 hour. And it's been around that mark ever. Yeah, people love to hammer on Defi tokens when they're bleeding, but that doesn't mean they're dead and they're going to come back to bite you. Don't bet against Defi tokens, they'll get you guys.
00:10:46.570 - 00:11:20.328, Speaker B: If you liked Defi season one, you're going to love Defi season two. It is coming out soon, I guarantee you. All right, let's move on from market and talk about some hot releases. We got to start here, David, PayPal. All right, we talked about it a couple of weeks ago in the roundup, but now they are like fully onboarding anybody. They've removed their whitelist so that users, and they have about 330,000,000, if I'm recalling correctly, PayPal users have the ability to purchase crypto within PayPal. There's no whitelist anymore.
00:11:20.328 - 00:11:41.670, Speaker B: They've taken that off and they are certainly following Square's lead on that. Except they've included more assets than Square has. And square, you can just buy bitcoin, but this you can buy ether, you can buy bitcoin, including a bunch of things that you probably shouldn't buy, but you can buy them here. Pretty amazing, right? David, did you ever think that you'd see the day?
00:11:42.760 - 00:12:01.884, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess I did. I'm happy it's finally here. And you're totally right. They are following in Square's footsteps, where square, I think, made 80% of their revenue last quarter, or profits or something from bitcoin and bitcoin alone. And that's run by Jack Dorsey, quote unquote bitcoin maximalist. I think that's a fair take on.
00:12:01.922 - 00:12:04.200, Speaker B: Who Jack, you should come on the show if you're listening. Jack.
00:12:04.280 - 00:12:27.328, Speaker C: Jack, come on the show because you're leaving gains on the table by just focusing on bitcoin. PayPal is going to eat your lunch because you left them there. And so PayPal is integrating everything, being a little bit more agnostic, a little bit less political, and they're going to make their revenue too. And it's probably just the first of many payment processors to enable crypto because they want money. Because they're money maximalists.
00:12:27.424 - 00:12:55.516, Speaker B: Super exciting. I think one of the biggest things to happen this year, for sure. All right, let's talk about liquid stake, too. So a few problems with ether staking at this stage, it's hard to put less than 32 ETH in. You got to run your own validator. You don't have liquidity once you bridge ETH to the beacon chain and ETH two. Some folks, including Andrew Keys, formerly of consensus, now at Dharma Capital, huge ETH bull, are creating a solution to that.
00:12:55.516 - 00:13:04.336, Speaker B: We actually had them on Meet the nation this week on our YouTube channel. Right. David, can you describe what this is? Because they just announced this on Wednesday, I believe.
00:13:04.438 - 00:13:20.820, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So staking can be hard. Like, not everyone is equipped to run a node or be that technical or even manage the uptime of their node. Then you also have to self custody your assets. New private key. It can get kind of complicated. In addition to that, you are locking up your ether for an unknown amount of time.
00:13:20.820 - 00:13:56.720, Speaker C: It could be more than two years, could be more than three years. In the worst case scenario, that's a long time to lock up a bunch of capital. And so in order to kind of remediate some of these problems, the Dahmer capital boys are rolling out liquid stake. So you can deposit less than 32 ETH, you can deposit more than 32 ETH, but not multiples of 32 ETH, and then you can also get a USDC loan based off your deposit. So while you are locking up your capital in the deposit contract, in the genesis of Ethereum, as you should be, because we are all stewards of Ethereum, you can still access the value in your deposited ether. So solving a lot of problems here.
00:13:56.870 - 00:14:14.996, Speaker B: Yeah, stewards of Ethereum, because you should be your patriotic duty. More on that next week, guys, bankless nation is going to war next week. And we're putting some posts out with some propaganda that I think you're going to love. Anyway, let's move on to the next one. Dharma. So dharma, a different dharma. This is not Dharma capital, the fund that we're talking about.
00:14:14.996 - 00:14:46.464, Speaker B: This is unrelated. Dharma is also a smart contract wallet. That's pretty fantastic from a user interface perspective. And they released some functionality to give dharma users the ability to buy tokens in uniswap directly from a bank account. So you connect your bank account, you can do up to buy any token on Uniswap with that super easy, like, click of a button on a mobile app kind of easy. DFI is getting easier and easier. David, do you have anything to add here?
00:14:46.582 - 00:15:17.672, Speaker C: Yeah. So Dharma is connecting your bank account to Uniswap. Obviously, there's a bunch of steps in the way, but that's what a good company does, is they take a bunch of hard work and then they eliminate that for you as a service. And so you can connect your bank account to your preferred illiquid token on Uniswap and just buy it right then and there, right from your dharma app. So tip of the hat to dharma for also being able to pivot and really move quickly. Because when they started, they were not this. They were kind of a peer to peer borrowing and lending service.
00:15:17.672 - 00:15:23.070, Speaker C: And it didn't really work out except this. Then they pivoted into this, and it's been working out great for them.
00:15:24.720 - 00:15:51.264, Speaker B: Defi pivots are some of my favorite projects. Now Ave was sort of a pivot and synthetics. The next one want to talk about really quick is it was kind of a pivot too. Originally, they were creating just a stablecoin to compete with maker, and they pivoted it into an entire synthetics platform. And now they've just come up with a synthetic oil, basically, that you can buy. Right. So this is a oil price exposure as a token that you can purchase.
00:15:51.264 - 00:15:52.404, Speaker B: Can you talk about this?
00:15:52.522 - 00:16:17.656, Speaker C: Yeah. One of the bull cases for Ethereum, or the bull case for Ethereum, is that it's the settlement layer for all assets. Except one of the bear cases for Ethereum, is that it's really hard to get off chain assets onto Ethereum. That's a very large, unsolved problem. And so synthetics as a synthetic asset generation platform is kind of a solution to that. It's like we don't actually need the asset itself. We can just make an agreement to produce a synthetic version of that asset.
00:16:17.656 - 00:16:41.904, Speaker C: This is one of the first off chain assets that synthetic is putting into their ecosystem. Using oracles from Chainlink, you can now buy. Not you aren't buying oil, you aren't buying a barrel of oil, but you are buying the value of a barrel of oil, which to like 95% of people who care about oil, that's what they care about. Right. And so this is now an option you can now purchase, quote unquote oil on ethereum.
00:16:42.032 - 00:16:42.324, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:42.362 - 00:16:58.648, Speaker B: And it's backed at the end by store of values. Right. Basically this is a bullcase for ether as well as some of these synthetics will be based on the value of ether at the very bottom layer. So super cool stuff, David, let's get to some news.
00:16:58.814 - 00:17:46.952, Speaker C: If you want to live a bankless life, you need to get a hardware wallet. There is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self sovereign fashion. That's why I have four ledgers that I use to manage my different crypto assets using the Ledger live account as well. Ledger live is like your home base for managing your Ethereum, defi and crypto accounts. It does a really good job of aggregating all of your different Ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one. But you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is, and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page. One thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and Ryan talk about with the bankless skillcube enabled in the ledger Live app.
00:17:46.952 - 00:18:41.992, Speaker C: So right now in the ledger Live app, you can buy, sell, lend, swap, and stake your crypto assets, which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skillcube. Something that's new to ledger Live is ledger swap, where you can swap assets one for another, directly inside the ledger live application, ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity, on Ethereum and on bitcoin. If you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger, go to the blog post the power of Ledger Live on the Ledger website, where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about. There's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet. I personally like the Ledger Nano X, but I also have both. They're both great options when you own a ledger. You own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone.
00:18:41.992 - 00:18:46.590, Speaker C: So go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible.
00:18:47.120 - 00:19:44.992, Speaker A: The bankless state and the nations are brought to you by Wyrn. Wyrn is DeFi's first self building, community run project, which I just get really, really excited about. Wiren is a system that seeks out yield in DeFi, and it does that in a number of different ways. A very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different DeFi experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token, right? And so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in DeFi. For those who want to just earn yield on their stablecoins, the earn system is for you, where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin. And Wyrn will go and figure out which money market on DeFi in DeFi is producing the best interest rate, whether it's Dydx, it's compound, or Aave. It looks around DeFi to see where the yield is coming from, and it directs stablecoins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn finance to get started.
00:19:44.992 - 00:19:47.904, Speaker A: And also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well.
00:19:47.942 - 00:20:05.184, Speaker B: David, let's get to some news. I think the big news event probably of the week was that infuria went down. Can you tell folks what infura is if they're not familiar, and why that outage caused such a stir?
00:20:05.312 - 00:20:43.152, Speaker C: Yeah, like I mentioned earlier, sometimes running a node is hard, right? Like sometimes your computer goes down. Ethereum as a node requires a little bit more intensive of a node operation than normal blockchains like bitcoin. And so people use infuria, so inferior will run your node for you, and then you can just use inferior as your quote, unquote endpoint some bitcoiner maxis won't like this because they are always about running your own node. And then there's something that happened with optimism. They accidentally triggered, I think it was actually on purpose. There's another backstory to that, we won't go into it. They triggered some contract on Ethereum that caused certain versions of guess.
00:20:43.152 - 00:21:06.484, Speaker C: And guess is one of the clients for Ethereum 1.0, certain versions of guess to come out of sync with other versions of Geth. And so people that were on that older version of geth actually started working on a different fork of Ethereum. This has since been resolved. Ethereum, people are joking about how Ethereum went down. That's not true. We just had two forks for a brief moment in time, and now we're back onto the one fork.
00:21:06.484 - 00:21:17.100, Speaker C: And then people are learning how to deal with this. Right. And so there's been a decent number of ecosystem responses to figuring out how to solve and make sure this problem doesn't happen again in the future.
00:21:17.250 - 00:21:17.564, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:17.602 - 00:21:53.252, Speaker B: So the cool thing I think about this is this just increases the antifragility of Ethereum. So similar to how we had pretty large gas fees over the summer. And that actually led to a good outcome, which is more development on Ethereum's layer two. Right. So we had projects actually take layer two seriously and speed the development of it. I think a lot of DFI projects and Ethereum users as a whole will start to diversify their reliance on infurior to other service providers. So either running nodes themselves, of course, that's an option, but there are a slew.
00:21:53.252 - 00:22:18.812, Speaker B: This is a website with almost a dozen different infura like service providers that you can acquire data from and use instead of infuria. So we do have some redundancy here, and I do think it increases the antifragility of Ethereum. When we have events like this, it kind of exposes the soft underbelly, I guess, of some centralization in the network.
00:22:18.956 - 00:22:44.664, Speaker C: Yeah, that's absolutely right. And this just goes back to the very common line, what doesn't kill it makes it stronger. And so if you're on Twitter, you saw a bunch of just fighting about it, and bitcoiners were having their heyday. It's like, oh, Ethereum centralized. But to me, I wasn't impacted by it, didn't stop me from getting what I wanted to get done. And now it's once again not stopping anyone else from getting what they want to get done. Bitcoiners will see this website, ethereumnodes.com,
00:22:44.664 - 00:23:15.840, Speaker C: and they'll look at it in skepticism and say, here's 14 nodes that you can delegate your trust to that's not running your own node. But I'm a fan of Vitalik's view on this, where it's a herd immunity type thing, where only a percentage of the Ethereum world needs to run their own node. In order for ethereum to be adequately decentralized, not every single person needs to run a node. And that's actually quite ridiculous to think that every single person in the world is going to run a node so long as we have like a curated list of people that are running nodes in good ways, then I'm fine with it.
00:23:15.910 - 00:23:16.144, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:16.182 - 00:23:38.440, Speaker B: And by the way, some of these node providers purport to be much more decentralized than infuria. So I haven't looked at pocket, but I've heard very good things about its approach to decentralization of these things too. All right, let's move on. So Zapper, our friends at Zapper, we did an AMA with them earlier this week. They just snagged some funding. Talk about that.
00:23:38.510 - 00:24:09.764, Speaker C: Yeah, Delphi digital, I really like all the Delphi digital's placements of their funding. Every time they make a funding round, I'm like, that was a good move. And also got funded by Coinbase as well. So Zapper is just this way to interact with defi in a way that's really efficient. Sometimes in defi you need to go to uniswap and then you need to go to compound and then you need to go and do something else. Zapper just bundles it all together and makes it really easy to do stuff. And so I feel like that's a pretty strong case that zapper is the front end of Ethereum in a way.
00:24:09.764 - 00:24:12.470, Speaker C: If you just want to get something done, you go to.
00:24:12.920 - 00:24:42.428, Speaker B: You know, I really like Delphi's approach too, because they almost take like an activist investor type role where they'll go in and not only invest, but they'll also assist with token economics and financial models and that sort of thing and sort of improve on the design of the token. So that's a really good take, really good strategy there. All right, finance, what's up with this? Our friend CZ, he's pledging one hundred k to get coin grants. Are there strings of attached? What is this? It's a gesture of goodwill.
00:24:42.524 - 00:24:55.248, Speaker C: There's never any strings attached with donations to gitcoin. So that's just, I mean, I don't know why CZ is doing this other than being an altruist and so good for him. Like tip of the hat. Thanks for funding, Gitcoin.
00:24:55.424 - 00:25:00.708, Speaker B: Maybe it's good pr, but regardless, credit where it's due. I mean, good job, Cz. More of that, please.
00:25:00.794 - 00:25:03.184, Speaker C: We'll upgrade CZ to chaotic neutral.
00:25:03.312 - 00:25:48.676, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. All right, Ciphertrace, they put out a report this week and they said basically half of the 2020 crypto hacks were from DFI protocols and exchanges. But I read through the summary of this report, there's a lot of like DFI fud here where it talks about people criminals using DFI without AML KYC, how it's unregulated, how it's a huge vector for money laundering. That sort of stuff, I think just puts fear in the heart of regulators. Of course, if you're a company like ciphertrace, maybe that's what you want, because if regulators will buy your products that way. But I got to be honest, I don't love it. It kind of sends a shiver up my spine when you've got companies in the industry talking in this way.
00:25:48.676 - 00:25:50.148, Speaker B: What's your take on this?
00:25:50.234 - 00:26:08.792, Speaker C: Yeah, so there's two things to note here. Cypher trace is not going to solve defi hacks, right? They're just going to be able to help find the culprits, which I guess is, okay, maybe that's a defense mechanism, but the right way to solve DFI hacks is stopping it at the source, not by threat of punishment, but by improving your code.
00:26:08.846 - 00:26:09.064, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:09.102 - 00:26:43.568, Speaker C: Like, if you got hacked, your code was weak, so it needs to be better. That's how you stop a DFI hack. The other take I have on this is that the title of this is half of 2020 crypto hacks are from d five protocols and exchanges. What about value? Because if we talk about how much value was hacked, centralized exchange hacks dwarf defi hacks by orders of magnitude. Like DeFi hacks are trump change, small money in comparison to the amount of value that's hacked from centralized exchanges. And so maybe the number of hacks is more, but the total amount of value that's stolen from centralized exchanges is way larger.
00:26:43.664 - 00:26:52.324, Speaker B: Definitely the cucoin hack alone, that was like 220,000,000, something like that, if you recall. All right, Ray Dalio, do you know Ray?
00:26:52.372 - 00:26:56.808, Speaker C: Do you like Ray? His book, principles. Fantastic book. Everyone should read it.
00:26:56.894 - 00:27:22.412, Speaker B: I love Ray's stuff, especially his stuff on monetary policy. But he had kind of a bearish take on bitcoin. He said there are three problems with it and crypto in general. He called it digital currency in general. One, you can't take bitcoin and buy things with it, right? So it's not a medium of exchange. Two, it's too volatile. And three, if it did become a threat to governments, government would shut it down, make it illegal.
00:27:22.412 - 00:28:08.896, Speaker B: So we had our conversation with Raul Paul that we put out on Monday, and he sort of diffused number three, where he basically said, sure, a government could try to ban it, but then another government in some other country will not ban it. This is kind of what happened with the gold ban. FDR's gold ban, the US banned it. Other countries didn't. The US ultimately had to take away its ban, and the countries that didn't ban benefited. So the game theory there, I think, says that maybe that won't play out the way Dalio thinks it will. But you know what I was struck by, David, is just like, dalio kind of gets the whole modern monetary policy, how it's going to inflation, how fiat currencies aren't going well.
00:28:08.896 - 00:28:28.410, Speaker B: But he's just at the starting line when it comes to understanding crypto. And this is exactly where everyone starts. They always say crypto is not a good medium, exchange is too volatile, and governments will ban. Like, that's where I started when I first learned about crypto. I was like, oh, it'll never work because of those three reasons. So I actually think this is bullish. I do think Dahlia will come around at some.
00:28:28.940 - 00:29:02.460, Speaker C: Yeah, so he's also, interestingly made really positive statements about, like, he has historically said bitcoin is kind of like a pet rock, and ethereum is much more interesting. And in the same vein as the CFTC chairman a while ago, I don't get what he is all about with crypto. I can't get if he's bullish or if he's bearish or if he's skeptical or if he's not skeptical. He seems to be a little bit all over the place. I'm curious to see how he does develop his mental models, because a lot of people listen to Ray Dalio. And so what he does say does carry a lot of weight.
00:29:02.540 - 00:29:26.152, Speaker B: You know what's funny? He actually, I watched that interview. He actually ended the Yahoo. Finance interview, and he said, yeah, so that's why bitcoin will never win or digital currencies will never win. And you know what will win? Gold. I just thought to myself, guys, buddy, I know no millennial is buying gold, right? Demographics. I mean, we're not buying gold. So maybe that's true now.
00:29:26.152 - 00:29:43.516, Speaker B: Maybe that's true even for boomers. It's not necessarily going to be true in the decades to come. Exactly right. All right. We could talk a lot more about what the government is doing. The final boss, as we call it. I'll go through these really quick, but Shapeshift had to delist zcash, which is anonymous.
00:29:43.516 - 00:30:06.820, Speaker B: Cryptocurrency. Don't love hearing about that. IRS is coming after Coinbase for tax information. So, guys, FYI, if you're doing crypto trades on Coinbase, the IRS knows, like, get right with the tax person, or else they will definitely find you. Bitcoin mining pools, some of them. One of them is at least implementing KYC. I don't love that either.
00:30:06.820 - 00:30:07.328, Speaker B: Right?
00:30:07.434 - 00:30:08.090, Speaker C: Either.
00:30:08.940 - 00:30:34.892, Speaker B: In the same token, we've got some good news coming from the final boss, as we call it, the nation state, which is central bank digital currencies are coming. They've got to embrace crypto. They've got to embrace at least networks like Ethereum in some way. The Fed is researching central bank digital currencies. An article came out about that, highlighting the issues on the block. We'll include it in the show notes. Also, Lebanon is the next country to step up and say, we're doing a central bank digital currency.
00:30:34.892 - 00:30:37.020, Speaker B: Every week. We're talking about this, David.
00:30:37.180 - 00:31:11.996, Speaker C: Yeah, it seems to be there's just like this good cop bad cop going on with centralized governments, right, where the bitcoin and Defi get the bad cop and the central banks digital currencies get the good cop, because this technology is valuable and so people are going to figure out how to use it. Every single week on the weekly roll ups, we talk about x country rolled out, central bank digital currencies and x token got the purview of the nation state down on it. This week it's zcash, and this week it's Lebanon. I wonder what it's going to be next week. We will see.
00:31:12.098 - 00:31:19.800, Speaker B: Yep. Absolutely. All right, we've done markets, news releases. Let's go to takes. What's on your mind right now, David?
00:31:19.880 - 00:31:31.424, Speaker C: So for those people that follow me on Twitter, they know I went to war with the green frogs, the green frogs of Twitter, the green frog army. So I want to clarify a few of the points, because this is what's been going on in my.
00:31:31.462 - 00:31:36.020, Speaker B: Wait, who are the green frogs for? People who aren't in the whole scene here.
00:31:36.090 - 00:32:13.728, Speaker C: Yeah. So the green frogs are the pepe frogs. Right. And they've actually been a thing before crypto, right. We saw the green pepe frogs being kind of more loosely associated with the right movement than the movement that elected Donald Trump. This kind of army of individuals, generally anonymous, that are on their computer and are meming themselves into existence. And it's a very good strategy to go viral, right? It's leveraging meme culture, it's leveraging Internet virality to help bootstrap a movement, right? And allegedly, Russia used this as a tactic to get Donald Trump elected into office in 2016.
00:32:13.728 - 00:32:59.836, Speaker C: And I think that we are seeing that same engineering play out using green frogs on crypto Twitter and other mediums as well. I'm not convinced that chain link at all did this intentionally. I think actually green frogs associated with Chainlink was much more of a bottom up system, like a bottom up community engagement. Because these things need community. But in the same way that you can only do the immaculate conception of bitcoin once, you can only do the immaculate ico of ethereum once, you can only do the immaculate, like yfi liquidity mining once, you only get the immaculate green frog community once. And now there's a bunch of other projects with tokens that are trying to leverage green frogs to bootstrap their community. And I'm just having none of it.
00:32:59.836 - 00:33:13.004, Speaker C: It's just BS. You only get to do that once and I'll give chainlink the pass. But any other project that tries to bootstrap their community by green frogs, like, no, they're trying to dump their token on you. Who's doing this coin?
00:33:13.132 - 00:33:16.028, Speaker B: Say names other projects are doing avalanche.
00:33:16.044 - 00:33:17.140, Speaker C: Is what I'm talking about.
00:33:17.210 - 00:33:38.984, Speaker B: Okay. And when you're saying the green frogs, what are they doing? Are they like hiring some kind of a group or it's a small set of actors that are creating these pseudo anonymous accounts and basically mass spamming. They're not real people. It's just a handful. It's like a single entity kind of thing. Or is this more decentralized? Because that's what they would say. It's like, no, we're individuals, David.
00:33:38.984 - 00:33:41.804, Speaker B: We're all decentralized. How do you know the difference?
00:33:41.922 - 00:34:07.152, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a non homogeneous thing. And there are green frogs that are completely stock puppets that are engineered to boost a token. And then there are people that just like hard. And this is why when I go to war with the green frogs, it's hard to actually defend my position because there are totally examples where I'm wrong. And some guy just has a green frog Twitter account that he enjoys being part of the green frog.
00:34:07.216 - 00:34:08.160, Speaker B: Always the exception.
00:34:08.240 - 00:34:43.052, Speaker C: Right? But there's also like one individual that makes ten green frog accounts and they put on the avalanche cap and then the avalanche blockchain has their telegram where they're giving away avalanche tokens to these accounts who like and retweet and engage with just to spur fake engagement. Right? And that's the part that I'm pointing out. And so I'm kind of ready to throw the baby out of the bathwater. Out with the bathwater. In order to make sure that everyone needs to know that you don't have to engage with these green frogs. They're not the most valuable type of engagement in your l one. It's not really the community that you're looking for.
00:34:43.186 - 00:34:54.112, Speaker B: And are you doing this just to kind of tell people about this raise awareness sort of thing? Because it does feel a little bit like whack a mole. Right. Like every time you hit one, five more are going to pop up.
00:34:54.166 - 00:35:23.768, Speaker C: I think the reason why I'm doing this is I just want to signal to people that the green frogs aren't as legitimate as they need to be. One green frog account does not equal one human. And this is not a war on Twitter accounts or anon Reddit accounts or whatever, you get to be anonymous. But if you are anonymous under the green frog banner or are trying to just bootstrap, fake engagement, that's not the. Like, there are plenty of anon accounts that I think are really valuable, but they generally aren't green frogs.
00:35:23.864 - 00:35:27.500, Speaker B: Yeah. They're real people under that. Yeah, makes sense.
00:35:27.650 - 00:35:29.230, Speaker C: All right, Ryan, what's on your mind?
00:35:29.600 - 00:36:10.252, Speaker B: Well, maybe I'll talk. The main thing. So the main thing on my mind is when we had that conversation AmA with Zapper, the question came up, hey, are you guys supporting Defi on other chains? That made me think like Defi and other chains? What chains actually can contain something like Defi, which gets to sort of the definition of what is DeFi? I put out this Twitter poll, and of course, it's biased towards whoever follows me, which is biased towards the things I talk about. But I asked a question about each major network that maybe claims DFI in some way. So is bitcoin. DFI was my first question, and it was interesting. The results from that was about 50 50.
00:36:10.252 - 00:36:53.512, Speaker B: So 50% of people said no. 50% of people said yes. I asked the question, is Ethereum DfI? 80% said yes, 20% said no. Is finance chain DfI? That is, of course, a chain from finance that has some sort of distributed consensus, delegated proof of stake. The results were 20% yes and 80% no. So skewed the opposite way is polka dot DFi that came out the same as bitcoin. About 50 50 is cosmos DFI, 37% yes and 63% no.
00:36:53.512 - 00:37:00.536, Speaker B: I want to get your take. What does all that tell you? Does it tell you nothing or is this some reflection of sentiment?
00:37:00.648 - 00:37:37.684, Speaker C: Yeah, I think you didn't do a very good job parameterizing yes. I'm going to cut this out. I think you could have done a little bit better job parameterizing your statements, because what does it mean to be DfI? Right. Is an l one DfI, or is an l one a host of DfI? Right. I believe that bitcoin itself is a representation of DFI, even though it doesn't host DFI. And so I think, at least with bitcoin, you got people that were answering that question from two different angles, and then maybe you kind of got your results muddied a little bit. That's my take.
00:37:37.722 - 00:37:38.164, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:38.282 - 00:38:18.448, Speaker B: Well, so the reason I asked that simple question is because we often use the term defi in such a simple way where we just say, this is defi or that's not defi. And it's almost like this is pure and that is not pure sort of thing. But I do genuinely believe that there has to be some sort of cut off on your layer one where, look, if it's controlled by CZ and just a handpicked set of people, how can we call anything built on top of that decentralized? Sure. To me, that probably skews over the line. And it was interesting that 80% of voters sort of agreed.
00:38:18.544 - 00:38:28.136, Speaker C: Yeah. I think that 20% of people that think that finance chain is DFI. There's your margin of error right there. 20%.
00:38:28.318 - 00:38:50.552, Speaker B: Well, it's interesting. The word is just very tricky. And I think that DFI is going to continue to be used in marketing and not sort of a real way, but anyway, that's been something on my mind. Do you want to switch to let's close this out? What are you excited about, David? So, second week of what's. What's exciting.
00:38:50.696 - 00:39:17.816, Speaker C: Yeah. And we've been putting a ton of content out on the bankless newsletter and podcast, and it's going to continue to be that way because I'm just super excited about ETH staking. Right. It's such an important part about what ether is and what it will be into the future, people. And we said this line on a previous bankless YouTube video, it's so bullish that bitcoin is being understood. It's bullish to be understood. Right.
00:39:17.816 - 00:39:33.580, Speaker C: When you're in the crypto industry, sometimes you feel like this crazy conspiracy theorist revolutionary about how, like, oh, all the world is going to come to crypto. If more people understood that, we wouldn't feel so crazy, and if more people understood that, then the price of these things would go up.
00:39:33.650 - 00:39:33.884, Speaker B: Right.
00:39:33.922 - 00:40:10.664, Speaker C: And so I think people are coming to learn that bitcoin is like gold, except in this new evolution of gold, except now it's bitcoin. And I think people are going to come to learn that ether and the eth stake rate is an evolution on the bond market, right? This is something we've been hammering over and over again on the bank list show. The bond market is massive. It's the biggest industry or market cap in the world, right? And so there's never ever been before a hard money bond market before. Proof of stake ethereum. And so that's what I'm really excited about seeing manifest into the world and people coming to understand this.
00:40:10.862 - 00:40:29.148, Speaker B: I said that before, but looked it up after our last show where we talked about this. So gold is about 8 trillion. The sovereign bond market is about 57 trillion. Right? And that feels to me like the total addressable market that ether staked ether is competing in. So pretty massive. Pretty cool.
00:40:29.234 - 00:40:34.220, Speaker C: Yeah. I know you're excited about this, too. And so we're going to beating this drum for a long time on the bankless.
00:40:34.660 - 00:40:35.456, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:40:35.638 - 00:40:37.264, Speaker C: What are you excited about?
00:40:37.462 - 00:40:59.700, Speaker B: I'll just say one thing. Look, it's been a long winter. It's been a long crypto bear run. And where we've been sort of plateauing for a while. I'm excited about the bull run, David. I feel like we're in it, like at the early stages, but I feel much more secure in saying that we have entered the bull market. So for some folks watching, this could be their first.
00:40:59.700 - 00:41:16.524, Speaker B: Remember, welcome. It was my first back in 2017 to see a full on bull market. And they're fun. It's going to get a lot crazier if this is your first bull run that you've seen. Expect things to get crazy, expect things to get out of hand.
00:41:16.642 - 00:41:18.156, Speaker C: Emotions will run hot.
00:41:18.258 - 00:41:27.504, Speaker B: Emotions will run hot. Scams will persist. It will probably get crazier than you think. But buckle up, because we're in the bull run and it feels good.
00:41:27.622 - 00:41:54.884, Speaker C: All right, guys, you guys know that we are permables on the Bankless podcast, but that's for a reason. In the bear market, you're always kind of like, oh, my gosh, what if the bull market never comes? And so now the fact that it's actually here, we kind of get really excited about, you know, we're permables, but we like to bring the. So. All right, guys, thanks for listening to the weekly roll ups again. We do this every Friday morning. Drink your coffee because we are bringing the energy. It's on the podcast.
00:41:54.884 - 00:42:21.376, Speaker C: It's on the YouTube. If you're watching the YouTube, there's a bunch of awesome graphics that you can follow along with just in case you want a little bit more of that information injected into your brain. So subscribe to the YouTube, subscribe to the podcast, and subscribe to the newsletter where we are about to put out so much content about ETh staking. Like Ryan alluded to, we are going to war. Next week there are going to be a ton of hot memes coming out of the bankless show, so stay tuned for all of that.
00:42:21.558 - 00:42:22.270, Speaker B: Take care guys.
