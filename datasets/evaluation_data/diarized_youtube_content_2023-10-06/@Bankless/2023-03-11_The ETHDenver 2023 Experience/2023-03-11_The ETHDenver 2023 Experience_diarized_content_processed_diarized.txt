00:00:12.650 - 00:00:32.054, Speaker A: Bagels Nation. We are at Shelling Point, which is a part of East Denver, and I got this other microphone. So we're going to go around and talk to all the people who are at this amazing conference. You know the deal. I've been talking about East Denver ever since Bankless started. It's a really important conference. It is the biggest of the ETH City conferences that are out there.
00:00:32.054 - 00:01:21.330, Speaker A: Last year in February of, what was it, 2022, ETH Denver attracted something like 13,000, 15,000 people. And we were totally oversubscribed for the sports castle. So we are in a brand new venue and even though we're in a bear market and all of our token prices are down bad, the energy and excitement at Ethnber is up only. ETH Denver has always been up only. I think I haven't gotten any official quote, but we are somewhere between 15 and 20,000 people here in Denver, Colorado for what is what has become much more than just East Denver. Ethnber has always been a two to three day conference, but this has been an entire week and Ethnber has got so big that so many one day off events have happened. So really the week started on Monday and today is Thursday, and it is the start of the canonical ETH Denver conference.
00:01:21.330 - 00:01:45.450, Speaker A: But really it's been going on all week. We were at the Axelar Interoperability conference on Tuesday. We were at Walletcon yesterday. But now ETH Denver has officially started here in the Denver Convention Center. So like I said, I got the second microphone. Let's go see who we can talk to. What's up, Hudson? Hello.
00:01:45.450 - 00:02:05.106, Speaker A: How's it going? Good. We are at you. I am David Hoffman. Who are you? I am Hudson Jameson. What are you up to today, Hudson? Well, I'm speaking later at Shelling Point and I'm also just kind of meeting people, giving a lot of hugs. And so this is your how many Shelling Points have you gone to these days? Oh, all of them. All of them.
00:02:05.106 - 00:02:24.534, Speaker A: And this is the first one that's at this new East Denver. New East Denver. How's this new East Denver for you? It's been really good. This one is so big it's almost overwhelming because I've been to all the other ones except last year, so it's much smaller the previous years. But no, it's still really good feelings around here. Yeah. What you're talking to me about? My talk is about burnout.
00:02:24.534 - 00:02:50.210, Speaker A: It's been with a few other people who have burned out and what we did about it. I took a year off. I'm coming back. I think everyone who's been in crypto long enough kind of knows the gist. For people who are sadly going to miss your talk, do you want to give them a quick TLDR? Sure. So our talk is about burnout. Basically how to tell the signs, how to kind of find support, convince yourself to take breaks, have a healthy lifestyle, and maybe even talk about what workplaces should do to support that.
00:02:50.210 - 00:03:07.174, Speaker A: I think it's pretty ironic that we just started recording and the first person to talk to is talking about burnout. Maybe we'll save this one for the end. How do you feel about that one? Maybe that's a good idea. Yeah. So what are you looking forward to? Any other talks that you're going to attend or anyway, speakers Shapiro, I think, has a talk. It might be now. I have to go check.
00:03:07.174 - 00:03:31.280, Speaker A: But yeah, he's a wild card. I want to see that. And then there's also some other stuff on DeFi from some people I really respect from like euler and other things. And so you've been to, I think, every single ETH Denver. I counted the number of conferences I've been to, so I've been to every Denver except for last year and I've been to over 32 ethereum conferences. That's quite a large number. I've been to a large number of ethereum conferences and I am nowhere near 32.
00:03:31.280 - 00:03:49.502, Speaker A: Maybe it makes sense that your talk is about burnout. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. No, it was rough. The coolest thing though was DevCon Six was in Bogota. I was walking around five floors, 4000 people there and suddenly I was like, oh, this isn't DevCon one with 300 people, I don't have to go 100 mph anymore. And it really helped.
00:03:49.502 - 00:04:11.350, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. One thing I've noticed at all of these one day off events, which is really new for E Denver, is all of these solo days. Yeah. So many people I don't recognize. Yeah, absolutely. There's a lot of young devs that are just getting into this and I'm trying to find more access to them to get with the OGS and make sure that they're getting the right values about being here. Yeah, certainly.
00:04:11.350 - 00:04:39.990, Speaker A: For people that weren't able to make it to ETH Denver, what's the vibe? Can you give them a largest collection of different companies that are blockchain focused but also adjacent, and anything from gaming to DeFi DSI? Just everything you can think of. The gaming one surprised me a lot because it looks really professional. So I'm going, I've been walking around and I just found you and handed you the microphone and started talking. Who should be my next target?
00:04:40.810 - 00:04:42.438, Speaker B: I thought I saw Victor Buenan over there.
00:04:42.444 - 00:04:50.646, Speaker A: I did see Victor Buenan. If I saw Victor Buenan right now, I'd be absolutely going after him. I think I see him right over there, actually. So I'm going to go take this microphone and run. Thank you so much. Cheers. Bam.
00:04:50.646 - 00:05:06.958, Speaker A: We're going to go get Victor Buenan. We found Victor. We're going to go get him. Hi, Victor. Can I borrow you? Yeah, absolutely. This is my good friend Victor. How's it going, Victor? Hi, good.
00:05:06.958 - 00:05:29.278, Speaker A: How are you? Good. This is your what number of East Denver have you been to? 2019? 202-12-2235. How is this one different? Let me name all the ways well, one, I'm not organizing, so that's very nice. I get to walk around and enjoy, I think, everything's. The venue is new, obviously, so it fits a ton more people. The bathrooms all work. So far, very nice.
00:05:29.278 - 00:05:45.782, Speaker A: So far. Big blow up. Yeah. I think one of the things that I love is that you have room to breathe and walk around and talk to people. The thing that I don't love is that I'm not used to the layout of it yet. I don't know where the stages are, so I'm just kind of, like, meandering. But I feel like Saturday and Sunday will get a lot better.
00:05:45.782 - 00:05:57.866, Speaker A: Yeah. Are you giving a talk or what's going on with you? No, I am here. I'm on paternity leave. I'm on daddy duty. Your baby's super cute. I'm just hanging out. It's kind of like I haven't committed to any events.
00:05:57.866 - 00:06:19.186, Speaker A: I haven't committed to any panels. Is there any subject matter that you think is really standing out here at East Denver? Here at East Denver? I haven't gone to any of the talks. I should have. Naughty man. I should have. I haven't. But I think that's anything that I would love for people to talk about it's like one, I'd love for people to talk about liquid staking and kind of like how it's supposed to be a big conversation.
00:06:19.186 - 00:06:48.386, Speaker A: And I think that's part of that is just talking about the regulatory climate. But also, how do you make intelligent choices as a project in order to set yourself up for success when it comes to dealing with regulators? And so it's like, what do you name things? Right? And so recently, people stopped using LSD, and now everybody's using LST. Right. That's an intentional choice and sets projects up for success. Why is that so important? Why is that UST versus USD choice so important? So LSD. The D stands for LSD. Yeah, the D stands for derivative.
00:06:48.386 - 00:07:16.854, Speaker A: And derivative has a very specific connotation in the security space around exactly what it is, and so it's actually not descriptive of what's happening. And so you're taking two risks. One, you're not describing the thing as it actually is, and two, you're like, calling it a derivative when it's clearly not. And derivatives fall under regulatory framework that clearly do not apply here. And so switching over to LST is more descriptive. Like, we're saying token is more descriptive to what you actually have and what's happening, and it makes it clear that this is not a derivative, and that shouldn't fall into that regulatory framework. Right, okay.
00:07:16.854 - 00:07:32.246, Speaker A: So people should start instead of using the words LSD, which, sadly, is, like, really fun. It's a fun one. It's very fun. We have slogans like use LSD, not LSD. You know what mean? Yes. Okay. But we're saying Use LST because it doesn't trigger the ire of regulators.
00:07:32.246 - 00:07:59.158, Speaker A: And we can perhaps push them at bay, keep them at bay a little bit. Yeah. And I think that people have a little bit of a naive view sometimes where they don't realize that words matter. Right? But if you actually look at the reason a lot of projects get into trouble, it's like, how do you market things? How do you talk to the community? How do you position stuff? And it's just like a lot of it is just your strategy on comms. Yeah. So the Shanghai upgrade coming pretty soon. And I know you're working with Coinbase Cloud, Coinbase Staking, so this is very relevant to you.
00:07:59.158 - 00:08:28.746, Speaker A: How is Coinbase thinking about Shanghai? What does it need to do? What are you guys planning for what's the conversation? I mean, you know, a big part of it is just making sure that we're ready from the technical. So, you know, withdrawals going live. We have an ETH staking API, which is how our partners integrate with our staking product on ethereum. And so just make sure that we have the records upgrades there, that all the withdrawal keys are set correctly. Everything's good to go. Other than that, I think it's going to be kind of a non event, to be perfectly honest. I think there's a lot of midwip takes on Twitter of like, there's all this pressure.
00:08:28.746 - 00:08:50.006, Speaker A: I'm like, you guys are dummies and I'm not going to respond to anything because I don't have time for it. But I'm excited. I think it's just the latest step in ETH roadmap. And to me, this feels like the culmination of the efforts from so many different teams and core devs and contributors. And this is kind of like the merge was done, this is the last step. And then you're like, okay, it's done, everything's done. And now it's like, let's look to the future.
00:08:50.006 - 00:09:35.294, Speaker A: I know this wasn't your project, but Base is capturing the mindshare by storm. And I know CBE, the liquid staking token from Coinbase is another decentralized crypto project offered by Coinbase. How are these things going to get married? What's the overlap between these two things? Well, I think the first thing is that there are parts of the Coinbase ecosystems that are centralized. And you're part of the Coinbase stack, right? If you're using USDC, if you're using CBE, if you're using Base, these are like centralized things that are run by Coinbase. And Coinbase is responsible for making sure that they're integrating to DeFi and have all that stuff. And so you can have that first party ecosystem. But on the other hand, you can also have the more decentralized aspects.
00:09:35.294 - 00:10:06.922, Speaker A: And so for CBE, there's also LSE, which is part of alluvial. And the liquid collective is going to be launching soon, TM. And then on the base side as well, it's on the road towards progressive decentralization. And so you have a choice about do I want to use it now when it is its centralized self, or do I want to wait until it becomes more decentralized? Victor who should be my next victim that I should put a microphone in front of. I see Kevin Owaki walking very fast away from me, which makes Be very sad. Yeah, I mean, you can chase them down. Do you want to do Lisa? She gets flustered easy, so maybe she's a perfect target.
00:10:06.922 - 00:10:17.930, Speaker A: Yes. Okay, well, where is she? No direction. She's right there. I'm just going to give her the mic and be like, Lisa, you're on camera. Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it. Hey, Lisa, you're on camera now with Lisa.
00:10:17.930 - 00:10:18.402, Speaker A: How's it going?
00:10:18.456 - 00:10:19.170, Speaker B: Good to see you.
00:10:19.240 - 00:10:20.658, Speaker A: Tell me a little bit about who you are.
00:10:20.744 - 00:10:33.938, Speaker B: Hi, I'm Lisa, Victor's better half. I'm the mom to Alexander Boonin no. I'm also the CEO at Aztec, which actually this is our booth right here and my theme. And Aztec is building an encrypted ethereum.
00:10:34.034 - 00:10:49.622, Speaker A: Yeah, right. Okay. So that is a very hot topic these days with all of this regulatory pressure about other things that aren't adjacent to privacy. But I'm sure you guys have to have been thinking about this. How is that climate impacting what you guys are doing at Aztec?
00:10:49.686 - 00:11:23.190, Speaker B: So we're actually really excited about the interest in ZK that developers have right now. There's a lot of people that are building ZK applications. And Aztec built a product called Noir, which is a universal ZK language that people can use to build all kinds of applications where they can do things like compliance checks, for example, which can feed into things like, okay, how are we responding to regulatory requests or enforcement across all different jurisdictions? So I think the point is that it's going to be very flexible and up to the developer to kind of adhere to the jurisdictions that they're operating in.
00:11:23.260 - 00:11:30.862, Speaker A: Okay, so give us a description of a world where Noor is, like, maximally adopted. All the developers know how to build on it. What does that look like for ethereum?
00:11:30.946 - 00:11:44.826, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. So today Noir can actually be used across different proving systems and around different ecosystems. So Aztec is going to be one of them. But Noir can also be used across, like, Starkware and across Polygon and all the other kind of ethereum ecosystems.
00:11:44.858 - 00:11:46.426, Speaker A: It's like a development kit.
00:11:46.618 - 00:11:47.402, Speaker B: It's a language.
00:11:47.466 - 00:11:47.962, Speaker A: A language.
00:11:48.026 - 00:12:08.770, Speaker B: So it's basically, like, providing the syntax for people to build, like, ZK proofs really easily. And the goal is to get web two developers building with these ZK proofs and ultimately deploying across all these different ethereum ecosystems, whether it's Darkware or Aztec or Polygon or any of the other ZK ecosystems that actually have the integrations with Noir.
00:12:09.210 - 00:12:15.430, Speaker A: Do we need it to be a ZK roll up for that to work? Or what are the limitations on who can build using Noir?
00:12:15.770 - 00:12:37.178, Speaker B: I think in terms of the like, there's technical limitations today, so we're building things like recursion to make it faster. But I think the limitation is really, like, is that integration built with Noir and that proving system. And so we actually have a grants program with Aztec right now where people are building out those integrations. So people that are in the Starkware community that want to use Noir are like building the integration so it could be compatible with Starkware.
00:12:37.274 - 00:12:48.574, Speaker A: Okay, so if there's a bar, is it zero to 100 and zero is there's zero privacy on Ethereum? 100 is everything on Ethereum is private. Where are we and where will we find equilibrium?
00:12:48.702 - 00:13:23.206, Speaker B: So today we're probably at like, I don't know, less than ten. We have a product live. It's called Aztec Connect, and it allows people to interact with layer one DFI using Aztec. So users deposit their funds into Aztec and then they can interact with protocols like Lido, Compound, Ave, Element, et cetera. And what they benefit from is gas savings because they're participating in our roll up, but also privacy, because all users see on mainnet is that you're interacting with Aztec is interacting with the protocol, but you don't see the individuals that are interacting with it. So that's kind of where we are today. The future state is being able to build any private smart contract.
00:13:23.206 - 00:13:32.682, Speaker B: So you can have private variables, private functions, private state. And so that's like the hundred. And the idea would be basically enabling this new use case or lots of new use cases that require privacy.
00:13:32.746 - 00:13:37.220, Speaker A: And do you think we'll ever get to 100 or we'll find an equilibrium before that point?
00:13:38.150 - 00:14:03.910, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think there's probably always going to be examples of things that should be completely public, but we're just seeing so much interest in people that are doing things in a public way right now that want to have privacy. So an example of that is Nounsdao has a request out there right now with ZK projects to build private voting for their Dao so that they can allow their participants to vote privately without being concerned about their identity being revealed or being persuaded because of their identity.
00:14:04.070 - 00:14:11.114, Speaker A: Which is like the way democracy works, right? You go into a voting booth and no one is like, oh, what's your voting on over there? That's like, how it should work.
00:14:11.152 - 00:14:17.614, Speaker B: Right? Exactly. So I think there's a lot of things that people are doing publicly today that ideally they would do privately. And that's a good example of one.
00:14:17.652 - 00:14:26.330, Speaker A: Sure. What's going to be first is an example of things that governance is going to go private first, or what other utilities do you think are going to go private?
00:14:26.490 - 00:15:05.238, Speaker B: Identity. Like people being able to share aspects of their identity or information with AZK proof rather than sharing the underlying information. Like, super excited about that. We have a team building with Noir right now. In order to do that for pseudonymous contributors, we also are seeing people that are you have to kind of rethink a little bit how DeFi applications are built with privacy because obviously, the way that Uniswap is built today probably doesn't work as well with privacy. And so I think future DeFi protocols that have privacy are going to have private order books, books and stuff like that. So I think there's going to be new mental models and new kind of ways that developers will be building with privacy.
00:15:05.334 - 00:15:11.002, Speaker A: So if we just piqued the interest of Bankless listeners and they want to go down this rabbit hole, how should they find the top of the rabbit hole?
00:15:11.066 - 00:15:15.002, Speaker B: Aztec Network. Or go to Twitter and follow us at Aztec Network.
00:15:15.066 - 00:15:21.106, Speaker A: Cool. Awesome. Lisa, who should be my next victim? Because Victor told you. And then here you are. Who should be next?
00:15:21.208 - 00:15:23.266, Speaker B: Let's see who's around, whether you can.
00:15:23.288 - 00:15:36.146, Speaker A: Or cannot see them. Oh, Victor's got an idea. Oh, we're going to go follow Victor. We're going to go follow Victor. Bye, Lisa. Thank you. Hey, I'm kind of hungry for a Green Pill.
00:15:36.146 - 00:15:47.820, Speaker A: Let's go see if we can find one. Hey, do you have a Green Pill? Oh, yes, I have. I have a Green Pill. Tic TAC. I'll take one. Yeah. Here we go.
00:15:47.820 - 00:16:00.062, Speaker A: Oh, I'm going to get Green Pill. There's Simona. Hi, Simona. I'm chewing on a Green Pill, which means I need you to talk. You're the one organizing the shelling point. How's that going?
00:16:00.196 - 00:16:04.970, Speaker B: I mean, you know, chaotic, as usual, but it's a public good, so that's good.
00:16:05.140 - 00:16:10.660, Speaker A: How crazy is it that this is a conference about public goods and people actually are here and care about that?
00:16:11.270 - 00:16:40.506, Speaker B: It's honestly the reason why we do it. And it's been growing steadily. With every single shelling point, I feel it's gotten more and more interesting. Buzzier and buzzier. And people are genuinely excited to be part of the conversations, have the conversations, and also have the space that enables them to chat, come up with new ideas, make things happen.
00:16:40.608 - 00:16:56.130, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of people out there in the world that understand, at the very least, conceptually, what a public good is. And they all say, yeah, I like public goods, but they've never really had perhaps a shelling point to meet up and discuss that. And that's what Shelling Point is really here to provide. Right?
00:16:56.200 - 00:17:21.162, Speaker B: 100%. And I think it's such an important space to hold for people and to enable that freedom of expression, that ability to collaborate, cooperate, communicate and come together in this really authentic really again, I said buzzy before, but you can feel the energy when you walk in here. And I think every single charlene queen that we've done and you've been to kind of all of them now?
00:17:21.216 - 00:17:23.674, Speaker A: I have. How many have we done?
00:17:23.792 - 00:17:25.420, Speaker B: We are at four.
00:17:26.190 - 00:17:28.810, Speaker A: All right. How have they developed?
00:17:31.090 - 00:18:10.698, Speaker B: I feel they have organically grown, very biomimicry style, like a seedling that has grown into something really quite special. And I think the interest that we saw this time around, I think we sold out within a month. The desire to speak, the desire to create engagements, the desire to be in our conference area and our DSI space and the DSI workshops has been incredible. So I am so, so grateful that I get to not only work to provide the space for people, but actually check out some very cool ideas happening right now.
00:18:10.784 - 00:18:15.180, Speaker A: What is separating this particular Shelling Point from all the other shelling points that we've had?
00:18:15.790 - 00:18:55.522, Speaker B: I think, again, it's just grown into its own thing and it's been so organic and so with so much excitement from people that the type of talks that we're seeing now and the type of different areas that we're doing now and the interest that we get from the community about those conversations has just blown up. So it's been beautiful to see because at the end of the day, we've been banging on about this public good stuff for a good while and some of us are a little bit tired speaking from experience. Wait, what? No, never. But, yes, it's really good to see and it makes it all worthwhile.
00:18:55.666 - 00:19:08.474, Speaker A: So if Bankless listeners are out there watching this at home, at YouTube, they sadly weren't able to make it out to Shelling Point. Describe some adjectives or some emotions that you are feeling that they might need to feel in order to be present here.
00:19:08.672 - 00:19:55.020, Speaker B: You're asking me about feelings? That's why I just told you about being tired, optimistic, definitely the regenerative, and at this point, really looking towards the future and being able to recognize how many of us there are thinking about these things, working towards these things. And I think being able to recognize and again, be together whilst talking about this stuff, whilst working on the same stuff together, is really pulling us together. It's really motivating us all to keep public goods good.
00:19:55.630 - 00:20:06.442, Speaker A: I think the thing I like about you the most, Simona, not the most. There's plenty of things to like about Simona. First off, your eyes are as green as the actual green of the green pill.
00:20:06.586 - 00:20:07.962, Speaker B: I did that on purpose.
00:20:08.026 - 00:20:11.546, Speaker A: And your initials, SP, are Shelling Point, which is just so fantastic.
00:20:11.578 - 00:20:15.680, Speaker B: I mean, come on. I should just mic drop right now absolutely. And go.
00:20:16.770 - 00:20:23.026, Speaker A: I've just been hounding people at Selling Point, giving them the microphone. Who should my next victim be? And why should it be Kevin Owali over there?
00:20:23.128 - 00:20:24.722, Speaker B: I mean, because he's right there.
00:20:24.776 - 00:20:25.650, Speaker A: Because he's right there.
00:20:25.720 - 00:20:38.534, Speaker B: Proximity always be efficient about then, you know, there's so many new people coming up into the space and so many interesting ideas that we should definitely give them a pass to the microphone as well.
00:20:38.572 - 00:20:45.674, Speaker A: I think that's absolutely right. And we'll get to them right after I get to Kevin. Awaqui. Thank you again, Simona, for doing everything you are doing, making public goods good.
00:20:45.712 - 00:20:46.262, Speaker B: My pleasure.
00:20:46.326 - 00:20:46.586, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:20:46.608 - 00:20:47.050, Speaker B: See you later.
00:20:47.120 - 00:21:07.998, Speaker A: Cheers. We'd love to chat. Hello with me. Yeah, I would love to chat with you, David. Kevin, how's it going? I'm good. I heard you're a VC now. Are you a podcast host or a VC now? I'm a little bit of both because I'm here to do one thing, which is to promote going bankless, and that includes financing the explorers of the frontier who are exploring that frontier.
00:21:07.998 - 00:21:46.154, Speaker A: Yeah. Wait, am I being interviewed? I don't know. We're both podcast hosts, so maybe we both assert our hostness. I feel like we're two AIS just like bouncing back questions at each other. Yeah, well, I think you're projecting a little bit of you and Ryan on me and you, but okay. Kevin, did you ever think that something like today Shelling Point number four would happen when you started Gitcoin in the first Shelling Point and the Green Pill movement? Just reflect on how far things have come? Yeah, well, in 2017 I started Gitcoin in my basement with no funding and just a little bit of money that I had made off of the bull market in 2017. And it was so lonely to get something off the ground.
00:21:46.154 - 00:22:33.258, Speaker A: And the fact that there's hundreds or even thousands of people here at Shelling Point and also people who have been impacted by Gitcoin and the work that it's done is really incredible. So it feels like we're in a regen movement and it's so much less lonely now. Did you ever think it was possible to get so many people to care about public goods? Well, I think that people care about public goods. They care about clean air and open source software, but they sort of take them for granted. Once those are withdrawn from you and you don't have clean air and you don't have herd immunity and you don't have those public goods, then that's when you truly notice. And the regen movement is all about building a movement where we don't take them for granted, where we fund them. And by the way, with Web Three, we can fund public goods way more efficiently than the state can.
00:22:33.258 - 00:23:27.822, Speaker A: So when you want to talk about going bankless, one of the primary functions of the state is to fund public goods. And if we can do it efficiently, more better on Web Three, not only does that legitimize Web Three, but it helps more people fund public goods in a bankless way. So it's an incredible movement and I'm really just thankful to Vitalik for really making public goods of value in his community because it's really trickled down to the rest of us here at Shelling Point and in the Gitcoin community. I think something that you and I definitely share is that we're never going to get crypto fully adopted until we get it legitimized. And the only real way to get it fully legitimized is by providing public goods better than any other system that's come before it. Can you reflect on that as a path towards adoption? Yeah, so, I mean, I think that web3 is the Internet of money. The Internet of information changed everything in our society because now you could send information across the computer network that revolutionized education, entertainment, media.
00:23:27.822 - 00:24:40.466, Speaker A: We didn't have social media before Web One, so now we can send value across the computer network. So anything the parallel there is that anything with value transfer is going to be revolutionized in society by Web Three. And I know that we're all hot on DFI and financial infrastructure funding art with NFTs, but up and coming uses of Web Three I think is going to be the Internet of jobs, revolutionizing how we work for each other and also funding public goods. So I'm just placing my bets for that cycle, for that market cycle, and eventually the market will catch up to that thesis, I think. So this is definitely the biggest Shelling Point that we've had thus far, and that's largely because new people are coming into this space, the regenerative finance space, the public goods space. What are some of the newer projects that I should try and talk to while I'm here? Yeah, well, I think that I'm really excited about projects that are creating impact, so Impact Owls proof of Humanity is creating UBI, and there's thousands of people in the Global South who are being funded by UBI, people who in some cases are living off of UBI. And crypto, we think that 10% inflation in the United States is high, but when you have 80% inflation in Argentina holy shit.
00:24:40.466 - 00:25:19.326, Speaker A: Crypto is a game changer to be paid in a stable currency. Collectivo, I think is really good. Using carbon backed currencies in order to regenerate local communities I think is an incredible use of this technology. But if you wander around Shelling Point, I'm sure you'll find plenty of projects that are using Web Three for good. Which are any of those that I should go after first? Who should be my next victim? I think that I should introduce you to Collectivo and Proof of Humanity, and there's a project called Gitcoin you should talk to. Yeah, where might I find them? Do you see them around? Well, I'm disaffiliated from Gitcoin because Gitcoin is now a dao, but they're everywhere. They're wearing these purple hoodies.
00:25:19.326 - 00:25:41.046, Speaker A: The hoodies say Quadratic lands on them. Quadratic Lands is a world in which we've rewritten the laws of economics in order to fund public goods and to share the creation of the commons. And so if you see someone in a purple quadratic Lands hoodie, it's a good chance there with Bitcoin. All right, well, I'm going to tell them that you specifically threw them under the bus when I get them the microphone. Thank you so much, Kevin. I think they'll enjoy the attention. Thanks for everything you do with Bankless Man.
00:25:41.046 - 00:25:52.234, Speaker A: I think you're creating a real movement, and I'm happy to be creating a little regenerative fractal on top of that movement. So. Keep up the great work. Hey, we're all going to the same future, which is the Quadratic Lands Frontier. There you go. Cheers. Come on down, brother.
00:25:52.234 - 00:26:02.174, Speaker A: Oh, we're already recording. How's it going, Anthony? Hey. Hey, man. How are you going? How are you doing? This isn't your first shelling point. No, Amsterdam was my first one. Amsterdam? Yeah. And also not your first e.
00:26:02.174 - 00:26:12.674, Speaker A: Denver. It's really great to see you here, man. How long did it take you to get here? To get here from Australia? Yeah. Like 18 hours of flying. Yeah. And this is probably why you've only gone to three Denver's. Yeah.
00:26:12.674 - 00:26:31.462, Speaker A: I mean, the last one was 2020. Right. And this one's like, 15 times as big, which is crazy. I mean, it's actually so big now. This venue is ten times bigger than the sports castle, at least, right? Yeah, absolutely. So as someone who you skipped, I think, one or two Ethnbers, we had COVID in the middle of the last time we saw each other. Yeah.
00:26:31.462 - 00:26:53.614, Speaker A: I haven't seen this guy since COVID except I talk to him on the Internet all the time. Reflect on how different this is. Keep on going down that thread. It's not even the same kind of realm. I've been here for a few hours now and just checking out how it's just evolved from 2020. Like, three years ago, we was a tight knit, kind of small community where you kind of knew everyone. Right.
00:26:53.614 - 00:27:14.838, Speaker A: And now I don't know most of the people, and some of them come to me and kind of say, hey. But it's just incredible how big the community has gotten and how it's so diverse now as well. So much more diverse. It feels like everyone from different backgrounds. Everyone's from different backgrounds, different places around the world. I can't even describe it, man. It's just crazy.
00:27:14.838 - 00:27:33.210, Speaker A: So back. The last eber we had was at this sports castle. It was one single place, and this is completely different. There was walletcon, which I saw you at yesterday. The day before that, there was ZK Day. There was the Interoperability Summit, which was a two day conference, and those are the only ones that I went to. There was, like, ten other things that I've gone to.
00:27:33.210 - 00:27:55.346, Speaker A: You were at ZK Day for a very long time. Talk about your experience there. There's a lot of hype around ZK right now. A lot of hype. And it was packed. It was a decent sized venue, but there were so many people there that you had to kind of, like, push your way through to get through. I think that everyone's excited about ZK because it's a buzword right now, but there's a lot of genuine building happening in the space.
00:27:55.346 - 00:28:12.710, Speaker A: Not just a buzword. For good reason. For good reason, exactly. And it's not just about scalability and privacy. There's so many more applications that people are working on. So I do kind of, like, have a little bit of concern that it's going to turn into another one of those. Everyone in crypto thinks that ZK is the coolest thing ever and they're going to speculate on it.
00:28:12.710 - 00:28:41.970, Speaker A: But that's what we do in crypto. We speculate, we see what's good, what's not, and we filter it out as the years go on. But it's just the amount of brain hour in that room was insane. Yeah, I think I remember in ETH number 2020, the last one, last time we were hanging out, there was like two or three talks about ZK and I was like, oh yeah, that ZK thing, that's kind of like cool tech, but I can't comprehend it. Exactly. Now there is a whole entire conference which I think you said was as big as ETH. Denver 2020 was in and of itself.
00:28:41.970 - 00:29:05.434, Speaker A: How nuts is that? Yeah, it was as big. The venue was pretty similar in size and the people attending, I mean, I'm pretty sure it was more than was at E denver 2020. But you're right, like, the term ZK used to be just some okay, that's kind of cool. Maybe that'll be something it'll be relevant later. Exactly. Now it's like at the forefront of what we're actually building here. And as I said, there's going to be a lot of noise, but there's a lot of signal still as well.
00:29:05.434 - 00:29:35.218, Speaker A: So as the other big media person in the Ethereum space, what's it like to walk around all these events? And I go to way more conferences than you because you're so far away. So what's it like? People people are Sazzle, starved. So what's it like to actually be here? Yeah, it's amazing to meet all the people that kind of consume my content and see me on Bankless when I fill in for Ryan on the roll up and things like that. Right. It's just amazing to see people getting and telling me how much value they get out of my work and my show and my content. And it's an experience to reinvigorate the energy. Right.
00:29:35.218 - 00:29:54.762, Speaker A: You get amongst the people that you see and talk to on Discord, on Twitter, and you have a different energy when you kind of leave the conference or you decompress and you think about it. So just meeting everyone has been phenomenal. Everyone's so friendly. No one has anything bad to say. It's always just like, hey, we think Ethereum's cool. You think ethereum's cool? Let's chat. Right? So it's just great.
00:29:54.762 - 00:30:18.770, Speaker A: Yeah. And there's a pretty cool I call like daily Gwyne bankless like a binary star system because what's it like to be an independent creator? Because Bankless very much for profit team. We got employees to pay for that's. Luca that we had to pay this man to hold the camera. But you make all of this content like no sponsors, no funding. Talk about that philosophy because we're at Green Pill, which is all about public goods. So product market fit here talk about that a little bit.
00:30:18.770 - 00:31:19.654, Speaker A: I mean, it's definitely inherited from the Ethereum philosophy, from the Gitcoin philosophy, from obviously, Shelling Point, Green Pill, all that sort of stuff. It's just my way of kind of giving back to a community that has given me so much and understanding that if we all give a little bit to public goods, we can create such an amazing ecosystem of public goods funding. Not just funding with money, but funding with kind of like ideas and putting the social energy into it and keep ethereum's mission of, I guess its value and missions of decentralization, openness permissionlessness, all of that, keep that going for decades to come. Because for years now, and I think for years to come, I'll still worry that Ethereum will maybe at some point forget about those values and people like me and people like you and other people. I think we need to remind people and keep the mission going and that's what keeps me going. Yeah, certainly. Is there any particular subject matter or talk that you are interested in watching today or tomorrow or what are other things about the future of East Ember that you're excited about? Yeah, I guess nothing in particular.
00:31:19.654 - 00:31:52.414, Speaker A: I'm generally a generalist, so I love being amongst all of it and I like seeing what's happening at all the booths. I went through all the booths downstairs before and I've just come up to Charlene Point now, so I just love seeing what everyone's doing, what they're focusing on, and maybe things that I'm missing and not paying enough attention to. I've already had a few of those kind of pop up. So, yeah, that's kind of my vibe. But yeah, I think if people want to focus on specific things and not just be a generalist, that's super important as well. Sazil who should be my next victim that I put a microphone in front of? Oh, man, I don't know who you've interviewed so far. There's quite a lot of people.
00:31:52.414 - 00:32:20.518, Speaker A: I got Kevin, Owaki and Simona just now, victor and Lisa from yeah, but still, we're at the very beginning of this, so we got a lot of East Denver left to explore. Yeah, there's too many people. I can't even pick one. Man, you're going to find so many cool people to interview here. It's going to be great. I know you definitely enjoy coming out to conferences, but you have a hard time doing it. And I'm sure there's a lot of people out there who are in that camp talk to people about the choice to come out to a conference, when to do it, when not to do it, how you know to skip one, and how you know to make it to one.
00:32:20.518 - 00:32:41.374, Speaker A: Yeah, so for me it's really just the travel. I think because I live in Australia, it took me 18 hours to fly here. 18 hours time difference. But a lot of people, it's also financial as well. Right. But there are a lot of actual kind of groups and opportunities within these kind of events where you can get sponsored to come here and they'll pay for your trip and everything. And attending most of these things is actually free.
00:32:41.374 - 00:33:08.594, Speaker A: It's paid for by sponsors, basically. So if you're kind of on the fence about coming, maybe for travel time or maybe you can't afford it, look into the sponsored kind of things, but also the travel time is so worth it. I don't regret it at all. Yeah, okay. I had to put up with some crappy jet lag, but just being here amongst the community, it's a very different vibe to online. Just putting faces to names that you may interact with and talking to people in real life and getting that energy, like just absorbing all the energy, there's nothing like it. It's indescribable.
00:33:08.594 - 00:33:23.466, Speaker A: You have to be here to know and to experience it yourself, to know what I'm talking about, I think. Yeah. Well, Anthony, thank you so much for your time and thank you for everything that you do at the Daily GWe because it is really the only podcast that I listen to after my own. Yeah. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. Cheers, Anthony.
00:33:23.466 - 00:34:13.402, Speaker A: Cheers. What's up? Who or what is FireEye? FireEye is a small group of crypto natives helping project teams launch tokens and governance systems. What's the logo for FireEye right here? Maybe fire underscore fire. Explaining to people how to find you? No, we don't want people to find us. So what do you guys do again? Sorry, one more time. So we help project teams launch governance systems and tokens. And how many times have you done that? Yeah, so we've helped work with Gitcoin super rare ENS optimism, most recently Colabland and a few others.
00:34:13.402 - 00:34:48.166, Speaker A: I think that's quite the resume. What do you do for optimism? For optimism? So the way the Fire Eyes works goes from very, very high touch to very, very low touch. And optimism was actually pretty chill in the last three months before the launch. We sort of helped on some of the AirDrop mechanisms and some of the sort of communication stuff. And then what are you guys looking to talk to now? What's the new frontier in FireEye? We can't tell you that, David. I think a lot of the east two restaking stuff, eigen Layer is obviously very hot, maybe even like too hot for a FireEye's right now. But Wallet Connect has also got some interesting shit going on.
00:34:48.166 - 00:35:29.318, Speaker A: So maybe them, but like cruising, it's not about us having five clients constantly. We can have one, that's fine. Why do people need firearms? I think I can explain that a little bit more, but teams are usually focused on the product, right, and not thinking about tokens and they've never really gone through that tokenization event. And there's a lot of nuances and things that people want to learn about that and know about that and need that hand holding experience. So we've done multiple token launches, launched billions of dollars worth of tokens at this point for leading projects. So having that advice and that insight while you're going through that process is super helpful. Lucas, what's a podcast NFT? Podcast NFTs are collectible podcasts, and you can collect the Bankless one right now at Collectibles Bankless.com.
00:35:29.318 - 00:36:29.800, Speaker A: Lucas, what's the future of podcast NFTs? I think it's a new way for content creators to monetize their content that's not sponsors. So if you are an avid listener of the Bankless podcast, you probably skip through all those sponsors that David says and Luke is the editor helping. But that's no fun for viewers and it's really not the best thing for content creators. We've had some issues with sponsors in the past, and content NFTs enable this new monetization strategy for content creators to monetize their work directly and for their audiences to own that work as well. So the ownership model, the ownership economy that we've talked about with Legion, which is also a collectible podcast, you've just teached the ears of many Bankless listeners out there who actually might already know all about podcast NFTs, but perhaps for all the ones that don't, well, where's the top of the funnel? Where should they go to learn more? Yeah, I think right now, Collectibles Bankless.com is probably where you can learn the most about podcast NFTs. But there's more in the works coming in the next few weeks and months here.
00:36:29.800 - 00:36:51.134, Speaker A: Can we speak more about that or is that going to stay under the radar? Yeah, so there's currently a stealth project that I'm working on that will help content creators tokenize all of their work, starting with podcasts. It's a stealth product that has to do with podcast NFTs. That's made by the guy who helped Bankless do podcast NFTs. I think I know where this goes. Yeah, beautiful. We're going to go on the run. All right.
00:36:51.134 - 00:37:08.086, Speaker A: Thank you, guys. Ladies and gentlemen, I found my next target. Here we go. Excuse me, sir, do you mind? What's up? What's your name? Frog monkey. That's what they call it is frog monkey. Frog monkey. Why did you leave Bankless? Why did I oh, man.
00:37:08.086 - 00:37:25.094, Speaker A: You're going fucking straight hard hits. Well, I went to go work at one of the leading companies in DeFi. Okay, acceptable. What company? What company is that? Uniswap Labs. Oh, nice. Oh, it's right here. Giant.
00:37:25.094 - 00:37:59.062, Speaker A: What do you do at Uniswap? I am a writer, so I do a bit of content strategy, which I used to do for Bankless as well. And a bit of the writing too. What's the last thing you wrote about? The last thing that I wrote about was our pay with any token launch NFT feature launch, which I thought was pretty like, you can buy NFTs with any token. Whatever you have in your wallet doesn't have to be right because Uniswap recently acquired that NFT aggregator, right? Yep. Genie. Genie, yeah. Is it still called Genie or is the name Genie gone? No, it's just the Uniswap NFT aggregator at this point.
00:37:59.062 - 00:38:24.474, Speaker A: Love it, love it. What else is going on at Uniswap? Oh, man, there is a lot going on at Uniswap. It's interesting because we've run a lot as a company in the past year or so and we've been able to focus on different products. Right. Because when you think Uniswap, you think the AMM, which for good reason. But now we've moved into this web interface that we use that we're expanding on. We've moved into NFT stuff.
00:38:24.474 - 00:38:46.978, Speaker A: We have some exciting product launches coming up as well. So it's like a fully fleshed out. The way I like to think about is like Uniswap is sort of like decentralized way to getting into don't. You shouldn't have to go through DeFi to access all the cool shit that's happening in DeFi. And so Uniswap is one of the places to get started there. Right. That's kind of how I think about it.
00:38:46.978 - 00:39:17.902, Speaker A: I woke up this morning and I saw a promo tweet from Uniswap of a very awesome GIF animated gift and nothing happened at the end of it, which is just like an announcement of an announcement. Frog, what is that announcement? I don't know. Wasn't there also a recent announcement by this cool company building out base? It's a very similar approach. We have something big coming. We're teasing it. We're at E Denver in present. So maybe this is a coincidence, maybe not.
00:39:17.902 - 00:39:39.526, Speaker A: But uniswap as a layer two. Well, the best way to find out is to go to our talk tomorrow at 09:00 A.m. On the main stage cal, given that I don't know why. Well, Frog, that's just great because this interview is not going to come out until the day after. So you can go ahead and tell me right now. I see. Well, no, I'm going to get in trouble for doing that.
00:39:39.526 - 00:40:28.326, Speaker A: I want to, man. I want to. Yo, so I'm a huge Dark Souls fan and this looks a lot like Dark Souls. Yo, did you build this? Yeah, I've been building this for the past three years. What's it called? It's called the fabled. It looks like Dark Souls. Yeah, that's the point, pretty much.
00:40:28.326 - 00:40:45.290, Speaker A: I love Dark Souls. Yeah. Awesome. It's beautiful. But you're here at East Denver. Why is it crypto? Why is it game at East Denver? Yeah. So all of the characters, weapons and items that you have in our game are NFTs that you can earn and have the ability to mint.
00:40:45.290 - 00:41:28.326, Speaker A: And then you go through these levels, you defeat really challenging bosses, dark Souls or Elden Ring and earn rewards. God, this game is absolutely beautiful. Okay, you said mint because you can earn them. So what's the vibe of this game? Talk a little bit more about the crypto aspects. The game itself is free to play completely free to get into. And then you have a choice if you want to mint your characters, weapons and items to get access to the marketplace, to get access to the onchain Token that's used for all marketplace transactions. And we also have a multiplayer functionality coming in down the line where people can stake their NFTs and their Tokens in high stakes tournaments to face each other.
00:41:28.326 - 00:42:24.630, Speaker A: Okay, so this seems like really sophisticated because there's all these web Three games and they're all seemingly kind of cute, easy, flash animation style games. This looks like AA game. Honestly, I was done recording and then I saw this game and I was like, luke hit record. When did you know that you wanted to put assets into your game? How did you make that decision? Yeah, so I saw what was happening in the web3 kind of landscape and I had already built out quite a lot of the games foundation at that point as well. And so I figured there was a market opportunity and I was also ahead of things in terms of development, so it kind of made sense. And then I also had known some people in the past who had helped develop other blockchain functionality within their own game and so it just kind of made sense to connect with them, integrate these blockchain features that I was thinking about into my own game. And now we're here at East Denver showcasing it.
00:42:24.630 - 00:43:08.802, Speaker A: Have you been a crypto person before you were a game person or like how did that happen? No, I was a game person first s and then I got into crypto after I became fascinated with the technology behind it and I saw the potential. There was in a whole bunch of different domains, gaming in particular. How do the assets in the game, do they help the company make money? Yeah, so we make money through all of the transactions that players make. They mint their NFTs from us at first, same with the weapons and items and things like that. As well as the Token itself. Part of all on chain transactions. Anything that anybody buys, a portion of that goes back into the Token.
00:43:08.802 - 00:43:34.974, Speaker A: Very cool. Okay, so there's an ERC 20 Token, correct. Bunch of NFTs that you get while you earn. Is it like a loop based system? Yes. Okay, so kind of like Diablo and Borderlands? Yes, exactly like Rarity and an item, you kill a boss, an item lands on the ground RNG and then maybe that item is a legendary and that item is an NFT. Exactly. Is that a taxable event? Good question.
00:43:34.974 - 00:44:02.186, Speaker A: You're not a tax lawyer and you don't have to answer that. That was mainly for the humor. That one's for you, Gary. Okay, once again, what's this game called and how do people sign up to play it? Yeah, so the game is called The Fabled and you can go on our website thefabled XYZ. And you can also find us on Steam at thefabled or at Twitter at thefabled I'm going to go home and play this game as soon as I get home from Ethanberg. What was your name? Luke. Luke, thank you so much.
00:44:02.186 - 00:44:27.586, Speaker A: I've always wanted something like this. I hope it plays as good as it looks, because it looks pretty damn good. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, my health is going all the way to zero. Oh. Why am I regaining? How's it going, Antonio? Pretty good.
00:44:27.586 - 00:44:45.094, Speaker A: How's it going? So we are in a really sick ZK Sync era. Brand new naming for Zksync. How's the era come about? Well, it's a new era for Ethereum. So that's basically it. And then we have our symbol, our logo. You can see it over there. We just live for the community to learn what it is about.
00:44:45.094 - 00:45:15.006, Speaker A: Okay, so ZK Sync has got brand new era, brand new branding. It's also coming very soon to Mainnet. Mainnet is up and running with whitelisted onboarding. Is that the current state of things? Yeah, that it is. It's approved projects. So basically any project that deployed on the testnet and submitted a form with just a few information about the project and the smart contract addresses on testnet will be allowed to bridge funds on Mainnet and deploy the projects. So that's where we are right now.
00:45:15.006 - 00:45:49.562, Speaker A: Amazing. So, I mean, you guys already have a ton of people, it looks like, asking a bunch of questions. What are people curious about? What about Zksync has piqued the curiosity of who? Developers, community members? What's the vibe? Well, they want to know what ZK is about. What is zero knowledge proofs? A lot of people are asking us about privacy in general. A lot of people asking us about which projects are in CK Sync already, which comments will be available and how much? Which projects will be available. Well, you can go to Ecosystem cksync IO. I can name a few.
00:45:49.562 - 00:46:07.118, Speaker A: Like ave uniswap curve compound. We have remark for mean, anything you can think of. We have wallets like argent. They will probably kill me because I'm missing a lot of important ones. But yeah. Ecosystem. Cksing IO.
00:46:07.118 - 00:46:31.382, Speaker A: You will find them. Sure. And there's a big ecosystem fund, right, for the new era of Zksync? Yes, it is. So part of the funding that we had, we will go to the two projects. Yeah, we're still in progress. And so if developers are interested in building in Zksync or they just want to learn more, where's the top of the funnel? So, first of all, come to our docs. It's in our website.
00:46:31.382 - 00:46:53.630, Speaker A: Zksync IO. And yeah, our docs is the top panel. We have a lot of examples, migration guides. If you have a project already running on Ethereum or other EBM, we have guides to migrate your project with everything you need to know. Sticky Sync is compatible with solidity biprod MetaMask. All the existing toolings works. So it's super easy for developers to migrate.
00:46:53.630 - 00:47:15.160, Speaker A: Beautiful. I know that there's a big race to be first. The memes going around, we were the first Zke. EVM was ZK sync the first Zkevm? Well, we are on the answer yes. Yes, we are on Mainet. There are people deploying it and there are people using it as we speak. So I would say that, yeah, we are first.
00:47:15.160 - 00:47:27.114, Speaker A: Oh, man. That's it. Simple as that. Thanks so much, Antonio. Yeah, thank you. We're going to go talk to MetaMask. Yo, what's up? Yo, what's going on, man? Cisco, how's it? Good? Oh, good.
00:47:27.114 - 00:47:41.934, Speaker A: Glad to be here, man. Where are we? Oh, we're at the MetaMask booth. Yeah. MetaMask infuria booth, man. Yeah. There's a lot of cool things that MetaMask is doing. What are mean? I can talk about lot of things, man, but snaps are cool people if they know what MetaMask Naps are.
00:47:41.934 - 00:47:57.218, Speaker A: Extension on top of your wallet. Any developer out there can build snaps. Today we have a bunch of bounty man ethereum. If Denver vibe is always same, it's really cool. We have a bunch of bounty on snaps on SDK. Mobile SDK. Really like recommend everybody to check this out.
00:47:57.218 - 00:48:13.834, Speaker A: What's a snap, man? This is an extension. Yeah, that's a snappy. As nappy snap. Literally, you can extend the functionality on your wallet today. Think about Node EVM compatible snap. BTC Snap, notification, communications, nap layer, two snaps. So anybody in the community can build cool snaps today.
00:48:13.834 - 00:48:40.734, Speaker A: Is it making MetaMask Turing complete? Is that the deal? Yeah, I wish to answer that, but man, anybody can. Whatever feature they want to build, they can think about as Naps today. I think this is what really power back to the community, and I'm excited about that. We launched this at V Denver, and today we have a bunch of snaps already pre built. What's your favorite Snap and what does it do, man noddm compatible Snap. I love the sarknesnap. I love the BTC snap.
00:48:40.734 - 00:49:11.542, Speaker A: So people can interact actually with other IPFS Nap. You can literally store stuff on top of your MetaMask using IPFS. Okay, so StarkNet isn't an EVM chain, which means that MetaMask isn't functional out of the box. So there is a StarkNet snap that makes MetaMask work on StarkNet. Is that the deal? Exactly. Who built that snap? Who snapped that? Who snapped that? So this is our team before actually like two weeks ago when we saw each other in the software session. But bunch of hackathon winners build new snaps.
00:49:11.542 - 00:49:36.126, Speaker A: I'm super excited also about these NPC snaps. So account recovery snaps. So people can actually use direct different accounts to recover in your account. I think this is amazing and built by the community, for the community. And I'm excited about when we will ship to stable. So I saw this morning that we talked about this on the weekly roll up this morning. ERC 4337 is now a smart contract on Ethereum.
00:49:36.126 - 00:50:02.762, Speaker A: How does that change MetaMask? What does that mean for MetaMask? Man, I'm excited about any account abstraction. I've been, like, during the Denver hearing, like, I don't know, ten panels on that. Yovi is amazing. We had him on a cool panel. And I'm excited on those use case like MPC recovery. Think about also, like, notification, batch transaction snaps. I think this is something that will be fun to see.
00:50:02.762 - 00:50:31.378, Speaker A: And there are tons of application also on the Ae section. And I'm excited about this. Yeah, the other big news that I believe was announced specifically here at East Denver was Metamaska has an SDK for Unity, the game engine. Exactly. Why is that such a big deal? Yeah, I mean, think about any game developer out there. Web two or web3 can actually integrate natively MetaMask. So we launched this SDK that are available also on the Unity marketplace.
00:50:31.378 - 00:50:59.562, Speaker A: And this is super exciting. Also in a couple of weeks, we're at GDC, where we're actually showing and deal with game developers out there. And by the way, SDK is a big part of our bounties. And I'm excited because today, if you want to execute batch transaction or doing specific game use case, you need to go through MetaMask externally. And today you can actually drive that directly from a MetaMask mobile SDK. Right, okay. So you're talking about the word, this bounty.
00:50:59.562 - 00:51:11.010, Speaker A: This bounty word a lot. We all know what bounties are. You get money. How much money is there to get? Man, bounties are just the start. Right. We have like, a 40K bounties of Snaps. Snaps is a big chunk.
00:51:11.010 - 00:51:50.074, Speaker A: Infuria are a big chunk. We have also SDK. But I'm excited also about what's coming after the hackathon. People can just be part of those developer commit, call Twitter spaces, be part of our MetaMask grants dao that you probably know Earth about and send proposals, get into an ecosystem, have more community members. Be excited. I think this is what's all about passion, building and sharing within and for the community. If people just got peaked and they want some of that bounty, or they want to learn more about the SDK, or they want to build a Snap or they want to do something else in MetaMask, where should they go? Where's the top of the rabbit hole? Top resources, I think we are here at the booth.
00:51:50.074 - 00:52:09.590, Speaker A: All those ten days we're back in those past five days in the hackathon discord. We are a little bit everywhere. Like, shoot us a message, DM us really make sure you're speaking with us. And we want to be involved also in building the Snap with you. Right. And anything like community is important. Amazing.
00:52:09.590 - 00:52:17.298, Speaker A: Thank you so much for thanks. David. What's up, Bash?
00:52:17.394 - 00:52:19.014, Speaker B: Hey, how's it going? It's good.
00:52:19.052 - 00:52:21.050, Speaker A: How are you? What booth are we at?
00:52:21.120 - 00:52:22.554, Speaker B: We are at RISC Zero.
00:52:22.672 - 00:52:23.626, Speaker A: What's RISC zero?
00:52:23.728 - 00:52:27.542, Speaker B: Risk zero is a ZK. Scaling solution for blockchains.
00:52:27.686 - 00:52:29.946, Speaker A: I love the word ZK. What does that mean?
00:52:29.968 - 00:52:46.322, Speaker B: I think it's everybody's favorite word this week. It's on the tip of everybody's tongue. Yeah. So it's zero knowledge. It's basically a special kind of moon mass that makes it really easy and cheap to scale blockchains, like, in a way that we haven't really had accessible to us before.
00:52:46.456 - 00:52:49.774, Speaker A: What does risk zero mean? Is there zero risk?
00:52:49.902 - 00:52:56.206, Speaker B: Well, we're built on the Risk Five instruction set. So it's like really nerdy computer parlance.
00:52:56.398 - 00:52:57.634, Speaker A: It's not R-I-S-K.
00:52:57.672 - 00:53:00.454, Speaker B: It's R-I-S-C. What does that mean?
00:53:00.492 - 00:53:01.766, Speaker A: Can you explain that? Like I'm five?
00:53:01.868 - 00:53:33.594, Speaker B: Yeah. So the RISC V instruction set basically well, maybe not like you're five computers need instructions to figure out how to do things. Intel usually makes these computer chips and they have really complicated sets of instructions. RISC Five is a set of really simple instructions that are modular so you can sort of build computers that are a little more customized and they can run much faster. So basically what RISC Zero has built is a ZK virtual machine. So much in the way that you have, like, the Ethereum virtual machine, it's just a computer that can run in ZK.
00:53:33.722 - 00:53:41.780, Speaker A: Okay, so ZK at the EVM level is like ZK at the very big basement all the way down at the bottom. What do you get when you do that?
00:53:42.550 - 00:54:08.550, Speaker B: Well, basically you get the ability to have verifiably correct compute, which means that you can make a lot more security assumptions about the things that you're trying to compute. It also means when you have the virtual machine happening off chain, like off of the EVM, it means that you're actually able to do really big computations much, much faster and cheaper than you would be able to do them on chain.
00:54:08.710 - 00:54:11.094, Speaker A: So, like, what is this, a faster blockchain?
00:54:11.222 - 00:54:44.758, Speaker B: Yeah, it's basically but it's not just like one faster blockchain. So what we're trying to do is actually bring ZK functionality and the ability to do much larger computations than you can do on chain to every and any chain. So we're talking about it like horizontal ZK availability to sort of the whole blockchain space. Whereas most, like ZK projects right now are trying to get you to move platforms so they want you to move to a new layer. OOH, we don't like that. We don't want anyone to move off of Ethereum, obviously, ETH Denver. So we're trying to go to developers wherever they are.
00:54:44.844 - 00:54:48.870, Speaker A: Okay, so is this a technology that blockchains can implement?
00:54:49.370 - 00:55:16.250, Speaker B: Yes, so any blockchain can implement. Another way to think about what we're doing is we're sort of like separating compute and data availability. So what it allows you to do is just supercharge your ability to compute things on your blockchain and do it way, way faster and way, way cheaper. You do it off the chain and then it all basically mercuryizes to your chain, you can have verifiably correct compute and then any of your applications can access that compute and know that it was done correctly.
00:55:16.410 - 00:55:25.698, Speaker A: Okay, so how would a user, perhaps a power user, but non technical, when will they run into risk zero first? What's the first time they're going to be interfacing with it?
00:55:25.784 - 00:55:51.866, Speaker B: They won't. And that's kind of the beauty of it. It's really a developer tool set. They will experience the joy of it because their applications will be much faster and much, much cheaper and things will actually work in a way that sometimes on Ethereum they currently don't. We want to make the gas prices of everything you do, from trading on Uniswap to buying a crypto dickbutt on OpenSea, much, much cheaper.
00:55:51.978 - 00:55:56.846, Speaker A: So which developers is this relevant for? This is for blockchain layer one or.
00:55:56.868 - 00:56:25.346, Speaker B: Layer two protocol decks for layer ones. It's for layer twos. It's for application developers that are interested in making their applications much faster or in using any of the native privacy tools that kind of come with zero knowledge tooling. So basically it's DApps. It's also chains. It's layer twos, especially anything optimistic. So with optimistic, you have this seven day dispute like fraud proof window.
00:56:25.346 - 00:56:34.678, Speaker B: With risk zero, you're able to take that dispute time because of the verifiably correct computing that's happening off the chain. And in the background you're able to take that actually down to like 10 seconds.
00:56:34.774 - 00:56:37.270, Speaker A: Okay, so it's taking the optimistic out of optimistic.
00:56:37.350 - 00:56:41.850, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. You don't need optimistic if you can verifiably correctly prove something right.
00:56:42.000 - 00:56:57.698, Speaker A: And just to really explain that, because not everyone knows why an optimistic roll up is called an optimistic roll up. It's because you settle down to the Ethereum layer one optimistically and you need fraud proofs to really have security about that. But with risk zero, it sounds like you can really just accelerate that whole fraud proof process.
00:56:57.784 - 00:57:01.794, Speaker B: Exactly. Very quickly happens in the moment of the computation is needed.
00:57:01.912 - 00:57:11.602, Speaker A: Okay, but what's the upside for Risero? Is this a token? Is this a chain? Is this an open source software tool set? How does this team have upside?
00:57:11.746 - 00:57:37.120, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we're kind of still figuring out whether or not we're going to do a token or what that's going to look like, but ultimately it will be a chain. So it's going to be permissionless, which means that anyone can start providing proving services. So you can provide compute into the network. There will be some type of token. As far as, like I don't know, personally, I'm kind of into not doing a pre mine, but we'll stop to see what our investors say about that.
00:57:38.290 - 00:57:51.346, Speaker A: I like the token word at the very least, so that gets me up and going. Ash if people are piqued by probably, I think, the more brainy subject that we've ever recorded today, where's the top of this rabbit hole? How do people learn more?
00:57:51.448 - 00:58:05.334, Speaker B: Yeah, you can go to our site, it's just risk zero. It's risczero. And then we also have a Discord Channel. So if you want to kind of get into the weeds, ask more questions, you can find our team on the Discord Channel, which is also linked on our website.
00:58:05.452 - 00:58:13.446, Speaker A: Ash, are you the person who is on the frontier of the combination of being the most technically minded and the most Swaggy in all of crypto?
00:58:13.558 - 00:58:19.658, Speaker B: I would say there are definitely some competitors in the running for most swaggy, but I have to be up there.
00:58:19.744 - 00:58:22.574, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely think so. Ash, thank you so much.
00:58:22.612 - 00:58:23.102, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:58:23.156 - 00:58:50.294, Speaker A: Cheers. I found this pool. It's all orange. We're going to go figure it out. Hey, what's up, Darren? Hello. How's it going, my man? I'm very well. Yeah.
00:58:50.294 - 00:59:22.830, Speaker A: Where are we? We are at the rocket pool stand at East Denver. And what you guys do? What's going on here? So over here we have a bicycle that is powering an ethereum node. He's staking ethereum right now. He is staking ethereum right now. If he stops spicling, is he going to get slashed? No, there's a battery attached, so it keeps powering it up. So the node that he's powering runs on about five watts. And that's ample for a bike.
00:59:22.830 - 00:59:36.706, Speaker A: So he's powering ethereum right now. He is. He's processing transactions. That's right. We have come so far, haven't we? This is what I came here for. This is a technology I've always been excited about. That's amazing.
00:59:36.706 - 01:00:01.814, Speaker A: I mean, this is an example of decentralization. Right? This is a fun gimmick, but it's only possible because this is a decentralized technology idea. That's right. So the cost of one of those little boxes is something like $600. So it's really, really minimal. Well, also, I mean, if that guy was doing a bicycle to process Shaw 256 asics he wouldn't be making any bitcoins. We'd have to have the whole room riding bicycles.
01:00:01.862 - 01:00:02.026, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:00:02.048 - 01:00:30.310, Speaker A: And we would still be at like, one quarter of the power. That's pretty cool. Okay, what's coming up and exciting in the world of rocket pool? So we have our Atlas release coming out soon, kind of around April. That will support withdrawals. So the whole Shanghai hard fork thing. But it will also lower the collateral requirement for node operators from 16 e to eight e. And what does that do for stakers? That means there's going to be a lot more space for re.
01:00:30.310 - 01:01:12.126, Speaker A: So Re is there's a lot of demand for re at the moment, and our decentralized network is kind of keeping up with the supply, but we need to be able to scale a lot faster. And so by reducing this collateral limit, it means that we can scale a much, much faster. There's been a frequent question in the Bankless Nation Discord about why Re has a premium and why Stake ETH has a discount. The answer I've been giving, and hopefully it's correct, the answer that I've been giving is that Re has a premium because Rocket Pool is capital constrained, which is a function of decentralization. Is that the correct answer? That's a perfect answer, yeah. Okay. And then the Re mini pools, which are going to go down to an eight ETH collateral requirement, double the capacity of our ETH.
01:01:12.126 - 01:01:38.362, Speaker A: Right. Actually, on day one, it three X's because it's 24 E. The bank list manager knows I'm bad at math. Actually, on day one, it's three X's. But because we've lowered the collateral limit, it means that we are then able to access a whole. So essentially there's a lot more people with eight east than there is with 16. And so we're actually kind of seeing about maybe a five X is close to where we want to be.
01:01:38.362 - 01:01:58.418, Speaker A: And you also get more yield. Right? This is correct. So you get about 16% more yield from going from a 16 to an eight. And also about 40% more than being a solo staker. 40% more. So you make 40% more yield staking with Rocket Pool than you do as a solo staker. Yeah, that's right.
01:01:58.418 - 01:02:21.340, Speaker A: But that's only if you run a node. Not by simply owning Re. No, that's right. If you run a node. And in fact, Atlas, which is our next release, will include a migration for solo stakers. So solo stakers who are using the BLS Credential can migrate to rocketball. How much of the trading channel is here? A lot of energy.
01:02:21.340 - 01:02:39.866, Speaker A: Are they all around us right now? We've done hardly any of this. All of this that you see here is basically the rockaball community is the bike in our trading. I did nothing. No, they just showed up with that. Yeah. So you guys bought the booth and they were like, all right, I got them bringing my bike. They brought the Tic TACs.
01:02:39.866 - 01:03:00.040, Speaker A: I think we've got about 2000 packed Tic TACs. They put stickers on the Tic TACs. So it's been absolutely amazing. They're a great community. Yeah. What's it like? So you've been making rocket pool 2017. I don't know if that's when the discord was made, but the trading chat, which is like the center of the Rocket Pool community, that's why we're calling it.
01:03:00.040 - 01:03:22.814, Speaker A: Yeah. When did that really start to arise? I think it must have been around well, actually, Dave started in 2016. We moved to Discord quite early on, but probably around 2018. When I started with Rocket Pool, the trading channel was already established. It was already kind of flowing and everything, but now it's off the charts. I can't keep up with the chat. Right.
01:03:22.814 - 01:03:57.286, Speaker A: How has the culture of hashtag trading and they're focused on their RPL price, but it's really just like the town square of Rocket Pool. How has that culture developed? It's developed a lot. I mean, there's a lot of OG kind of rocket Pool people in there. So there's a brains trust, actually, within the kind of Trading Channel. They've also got, like it's got a whole culture in itself in sense that Poaps. There are probably about ten PO apps a week that get issued on all sorts of Poaps. They will make a POAP over absolutely everything.
01:03:57.286 - 01:04:08.006, Speaker A: Pretty much, yeah. If you turn up one day, they'll they might make a POAP for this. Speaking of Poaps, we got Isabella behind us. What's up? Actually, if you don't mind, I'm going to go talk to Isabella.
01:04:08.198 - 01:04:08.746, Speaker B: Hello.
01:04:08.848 - 01:04:09.530, Speaker A: How's it going?
01:04:09.600 - 01:04:10.474, Speaker B: Going well. How are you?
01:04:10.512 - 01:04:12.418, Speaker A: Good. How's your ETH? Denver.
01:04:12.534 - 01:04:14.974, Speaker B: E denver's going marvelously. How are you doing?
01:04:15.092 - 01:04:23.326, Speaker A: So this is Isabella from POAP, who I'm now realizing is perfectly suited, as is the nature of patricio. Was this your vibe or like how.
01:04:23.348 - 01:04:26.542, Speaker B: Did believe it or not, I actually had this suit before I joined Poop.
01:04:26.606 - 01:04:26.978, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:04:27.064 - 01:04:29.426, Speaker B: So it was kind of meant to be nice.
01:04:29.608 - 01:04:30.994, Speaker A: The branding is perfect.
01:04:31.112 - 01:04:32.130, Speaker B: It's worked out well.
01:04:32.200 - 01:04:33.854, Speaker A: How many Poops have you issued?
01:04:33.982 - 01:04:38.914, Speaker B: How many poops have I issued? I think just within the last couple of days, probably over 200.
01:04:39.032 - 01:04:39.906, Speaker A: Is that draining?
01:04:39.938 - 01:04:53.114, Speaker B: You know what? No. Actually, I kind of enjoy socializing with people in the Poop community. It's a good excuse to meet people, a good excuse to tell people what we do. So I don't know. I think at first I used to find it draining, but after a little while, you build some muscle around it.
01:04:53.232 - 01:04:54.838, Speaker A: Do you have a favorite POAP?
01:04:54.934 - 01:04:56.700, Speaker B: Do I have a favorite PO? Actually, yes.
01:04:57.310 - 01:04:58.938, Speaker A: Can I have it? No.
01:04:59.104 - 01:05:09.758, Speaker B: So I'll show you my favorite Poop, though. Okay. So there was a favorite Poop that I made when we did something for the Ethereum merge. So let me see if I find it.
01:05:09.844 - 01:05:18.478, Speaker A: That's a lot of poops. She's scrolling quite a lot. It's this one wash for you. The merge at 07:00 a.m.. Basically, it's.
01:05:18.494 - 01:05:36.242, Speaker B: A Poop that we issued for a party that we had to celebrate the merge in Berlin with our entire team in a hotel room watching the painting party. And there's a bunch of pictures attached to it of all of us in the hotel room at 07:00 A.m.. We were working hard the night before, so it has a lot of good memories attached.
01:05:36.306 - 01:05:38.962, Speaker A: Do you have an Isabella POAP that I can collect right now?
01:05:39.036 - 01:05:39.434, Speaker B: I do.
01:05:39.472 - 01:05:40.346, Speaker A: Can we do this right now?
01:05:40.368 - 01:05:41.402, Speaker B: We absolutely can.
01:05:41.536 - 01:05:43.340, Speaker A: I'm going to get Isabella's PO app.
01:05:44.590 - 01:05:45.660, Speaker B: Let's see.
01:05:47.070 - 01:05:50.460, Speaker A: There you go. Works like a charm every single time.
01:05:50.910 - 01:05:52.470, Speaker B: The process have become a lot smoother.
01:05:52.550 - 01:06:02.302, Speaker A: Sorry. So I would like to say I got my card, I loaded up my PO app. I'm so excited to bring it here so everyone could say, I met David at East Denver. And you know where that card is?
01:06:02.356 - 01:06:02.766, Speaker B: Where?
01:06:02.868 - 01:06:04.030, Speaker A: At my desk at home.
01:06:04.100 - 01:06:04.430, Speaker B: Amazing.
01:06:04.500 - 01:06:06.738, Speaker A: So you don't have a Poop? I don't have a Poop here.
01:06:06.824 - 01:06:09.490, Speaker B: There absolutely needs to be a Poop for meeting people from Bankless.
01:06:10.230 - 01:06:13.022, Speaker A: So we actually had our first ever bankless meetup yesterday.
01:06:13.086 - 01:06:14.126, Speaker B: And was there a poop?
01:06:14.238 - 01:06:16.238, Speaker A: And Christina brought a poop.
01:06:16.414 - 01:06:17.998, Speaker B: Christina, you're a hero.
01:06:18.174 - 01:06:20.530, Speaker A: Thanks, Christina. Christina, come say hi.
01:06:20.680 - 01:06:22.662, Speaker B: David. How is your East Denver going?
01:06:22.716 - 01:06:40.298, Speaker A: Oh, my God, I love being on the other side of the microphone. It's going so great. I had a talk up at Shelling Point this morning all about how permissionless protocols make us responsible humans. And then after that, me and Luke have just been running around with his camera microphones, kind of like attacking people with them, as I've just done to you.
01:06:40.384 - 01:06:41.690, Speaker B: You know what? I'm happy for it.
01:06:41.760 - 01:06:46.094, Speaker A: Yeah, I've been having a fun time. I've gone to every single East Denver and I wouldn't dare miss them.
01:06:46.212 - 01:06:51.130, Speaker B: That makes a lot of sense. What is the event that you're looking forward to the most? After ETH Denver.
01:06:51.210 - 01:07:03.726, Speaker A: After ETH Denver. So there is DevCon just got announced in 2024. That is a very long time away. The next event that I know about is ECC. But ETH Buenos Aires also just got announced.
01:07:03.758 - 01:07:08.782, Speaker B: Or ETH Argentina in September, I think is coming. I know. There's east Tokyo in April.
01:07:08.846 - 01:07:10.662, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know if I can make that one.
01:07:10.716 - 01:07:11.494, Speaker B: It's very far away.
01:07:11.532 - 01:07:12.614, Speaker A: Yes, it's very, very far away.
01:07:12.652 - 01:07:27.886, Speaker B: Maybe, I hope, but probably not. I think it's between that and permissionless. And realistically speaking, going from Tokyo to Austin is going to be probably too much. I went from Paris here and it was a lot. From Tokyo to Austin is going to.
01:07:27.888 - 01:07:35.390, Speaker A: Be more certainly yeah, you did say permissionless. I probably should say permissionless. The conference that I'm helping organize is definitely the one I'm very, very excited about.
01:07:35.460 - 01:07:38.750, Speaker B: I was trying to open up the table for you to talk about permissionless.
01:07:39.810 - 01:07:41.626, Speaker A: I did not take the bait in the slide.
01:07:41.658 - 01:07:41.998, Speaker B: No, you know what?
01:07:42.004 - 01:07:47.274, Speaker A: You didn't. So, Isabella, what's going on at POAP? What are you guys working on? Like, what's the new frontier of development?
01:07:47.322 - 01:07:53.746, Speaker B: We're working on a lot of incredibly exciting things. And, David, I wish I could drop alpha for you here, but I'm afraid I'm not going to do that.
01:07:53.928 - 01:07:59.938, Speaker A: Usually people reserve the alpha for me, but I'll have to let you go without it this time around. Isabella thank you so much. David.
01:07:59.954 - 01:08:00.454, Speaker B: Thanks so much.
01:08:00.492 - 01:08:18.970, Speaker A: Cheers. How many of these do you have, Patricia? That's secret information. So for those that don't know, this is Patricia Warthaller, aka the King of Poaps. Do you have an official nickname? I call myself the Inventor of Poaps. Inventor of poaps. Because King comes with lots of responsibility and I don't want more of that in my life. I have a lot.
01:08:18.970 - 01:08:41.394, Speaker A: Yeah. Protocols. Not people, not protocols, not people, not kings. This is what we say, don't we? Patricia? How many poaps do you have? Not only we say so. I mean, it because in this ecosystem, there are a lot that say a lot about decentralization, and only a handful mean it. How many pubs I have slightly over a thousand. But because I only mean POVs, that I care a lot.
01:08:41.394 - 01:09:03.980, Speaker A: So if you give me a POAP and I don't feel compelled for it, it's like I don't want this crapping. Between my precious collectibles patricio, what's going on in the world of POAP? What are you guys building that's behind the scenes? Tell me. Give me the alpha. Things are going so well. We are building so much that it hurts. That's what Isabella said. I mean, maybe it is true.
01:09:03.980 - 01:09:34.002, Speaker A: No, seriously, this bear market is being a blessing. We don't love it. We wish our bugs were pumping. We have many bugs that are really depressed. But at the same time, it feels nice to finally be appreciated for what we do. Not so much for our ability to pump some other collection or something. And it is happening, and fundamentally speaking, on the things we care about, which is how happy people are getting the digital collectibles, how valuable the connections they make are.
01:09:34.002 - 01:10:00.810, Speaker A: Things never been better by far. This is the greatest time in the four years of POAP I can imagine, because I think every time I've gone to a different booth, everyone's got a POAP issue. And this is the beginning. We have really exciting plans that augment these dynamics to unseen level. Patricia, thank you for everything you've done. People love poaps, I think, more than anything in this space. You know what people love more? Bankless.
01:10:00.810 - 01:10:18.674, Speaker A: I'm not actually too sure about that one. Well, I love it a lot. Well, thank you for choosing. I also love poaps. Cheers. All right, we need to go find Jesse from Bass. And I've been told that Jesse from Bass is in the Bass Mint, is what I've been told.
01:10:18.674 - 01:10:56.400, Speaker A: So we're going to go find him. It's really dark down here. So, Jesse, I was told that I would find you in the basement. Yes, we are here in the basement at home base. I was just I tweeted I said, Me and Stannie had a little fireside down here. I said, Me and Stannie are getting Bass, talking about Bass in the basement at home base at East Denver. Did you know what you were doing when you guys named the name Bass? We knew what we were doing.
01:10:56.400 - 01:11:28.870, Speaker A: How quickly after you named it Bass was the first Bass joke made? Immediately. Immediately. It was a moment. I mean, literally, we were going through naming and this was actually before we were building an L two. We were iterating through a bunch of different products, and we landed on the name Base on one of the earlier products. And it was me and Max Brandsburg, who runs the consumer, like, all the consumer products at Coinbase. And we were just kind of going through names and he was like, what if we said Base? And both of us were just like, oh, my God.
01:11:28.870 - 01:11:47.066, Speaker A: Okay, we should unpack how many layers? This goes deep. So we have coinbase. Coinbase. It's already in base. Yes, but Coin is the equity and now Base is the chain. So that's one layer. Home base as in like, it's Coinbase's home base, so that's another layer.
01:11:47.066 - 01:12:36.426, Speaker A: How many more layers does this go after this? I mean, Base like it's a foundational layer of the crypto economy. That's another mean based in that we have Base, which is just an incredible domain. It's a one syllable word that has such meaning. There's so many reasons. Base is a good name, but to the point of like you come up with a name and you're like, well, now we need to make a I mean, really, the journey to the Chain was a journey of knowing. That we needed to figure out how to bring coinbase on chain and not knowing how to do it, but knowing it in our hearts that that was the process we were trying to do. And I think we landed on the name Base pretty early and it felt aligned to that mission.
01:12:36.426 - 01:13:16.090, Speaker A: And then it took us a few tries to be like, oh, what's the right way to do that? And out the other side came the L2 and we named it Base and it all fit because we'd been thinking with that mission for almost two years certainly. And so I think people, if you ask them the question, hey, what's Coinbase? They would say, oh, it's Coinbase.com, it's an exchange, it does some other things. But what is Coinbase is really answered as in that centralized Coinbase.com thing. Now there's Base and you've talked a lot about on chains and Next online. What is the future of Base? Is the future of Coinbase as a thing to say? Like, oh, what is coinbase? Will that eventually be oh, Coinbase is Base, it is this Base chain.
01:13:16.090 - 01:13:44.478, Speaker A: How integral? Is this a side project or is this the full thing? Where are we on that spectrum? I definitely don't think it's a side project but I think it's also not that Coinbase's based. I think Coinbase's mission has been very clear for the last seven years since Brian wrote this Coinbase secret master plan where it is we're building the crypto economy and we think that's going to come in four phases. First the protocols, then the exchange, that's Coinbase exchange, then the consumer interfaces. That's coinbase. Wallet. That's coinbase. DAP wallet.
01:13:44.478 - 01:14:18.334, Speaker A: That's coinbase. And then we're going to have millions of applications that enable billions of users to use crypto and we think about bases. Phase 3.5, it's like the platform that enables those millions of applications to bring in the billions of people. And we think that that's incredibly complementary to all of the Coinbase products because it's going to mean more really useful things for users to actually do. And internally at Coinbase and this kind of gets lost in the broader world, but internally we've been thinking about our consumer products as the gateway to Web Three for the last two and a half years. Three years, that's like been the drumbeat that we've all been running to.
01:14:18.334 - 01:14:45.014, Speaker A: It's like, we are building the gateway to Web Three. And I think we're starting to see that come through. Like, if you look at Coinbase wallet, a year and a half ago, it was almost unusable. And today it's like far and away the most usable crypto wallet in the world. And that is reflective of us saying, this is the gateway to Web Three. We're not just an exchange, we want people to use crypto. What was pretty exciting for me to see after the base announcement was all of the applications that seemed ready to go.
01:14:45.014 - 01:15:19.330, Speaker A: So some announced like, hey, we're building on base. Not like hours after the base announcement, some the next day, some a couple of days later and we're still seeing them now. What's that pipeline been like? Were some applications made privy to base ahead of time? Some applications have already made their announcements post talk about that process. Yeah. So when we got to the point where we had line of sight on a testnet launch, we went out and talked with a number of different folks in the broader ecosystem. And one of our values for base has been base for everyone. That's been this drumbeat that we've hit on internally for our team.
01:15:19.330 - 01:16:06.382, Speaker A: And what that's meant is in every sector, DeFi social gaming and then even in the subsectors, like trading, lending, borrowing, whatever, we didn't want to go to just one person and say, this is an exclusive. And so we did is we went and talked to a few people and across each of those sectors we had, I think, three people at a minimum who were announcing on day one that they were building on base. And so that was this incredible group of, I think, like 70 different teams building on base announced on day one. Since we actually went public and we told the world about this, we've had so much demand. Like, you guys just walked through the basement, it's packed. We're putting people's photos up on the wall whenever they commit to building on base. And that's all indicative of this value, which is bases for everyone.
01:16:06.382 - 01:16:41.874, Speaker A: It's not just an exclusive cadre of people who have special access to Coinbase or special access to some part of the team. It's like, we're going to invest in making it so everyone everywhere in the world can build on base because that's what's going to be required to bring a million builders on chain and then a billion users on chain. And then I actually have the bankless family is going to love this. I'm already excited. The phrase is a million builders, so we can have a billion bankless. Can we put that into official base terminology? Say it again for the people in the back. A million builders so we can have 1 billion bankless.
01:16:41.874 - 01:17:22.306, Speaker A: So something that we've noticed across the various ecosystems, the layer two ecosystems is like polygon has an insane BD team. They're always known for that building on Starkware and StarkNet, their BD teams are very strong. Is there a similar effort for a base chain? Is there like, Coinbase putting BD behind this? Or how does this world work? Yeah, I mean, we got to walk out there and introduce you to our BD team. I've been so blown away at the work that Polygon and others have done in bringing people into the crypto economy. And I think our thesis is like, there's so much growth ahead of us. We are literally at day zero. There are like a few million people in crypto.
01:17:22.306 - 01:17:41.006, Speaker A: We need to get to billions of people in crypto. There are a few hundred businesses in crypto. We need to get to millions of businesses in crypto. And so I'm so grateful for all of the people who have been running incredible BD efforts to bring people into crypto. I think I'm excited that Coinbase is about to join the fray. We have an incredible BD team. We have an incredible sales team.
01:17:41.006 - 01:18:14.906, Speaker A: We have this entire ecosystem of users, of institutions, of developers who know and trust and have relationships with Coinbase already. And we're going to activate those people that come on chain. Because our thesis, if we can bring the 110,000,000 users, the $80 billion of assets, Coinbase, that's the starting point. But then because of our brand, because of the trust that we have, because of the track record we have of making crypto easy and secure, we're going to be able to bring in billions of people. And that's every day I wake up. 1 million builders, 1 billion bankless. You say that in the mirror every single morning.
01:18:14.906 - 01:18:28.350, Speaker A: Every single morning. Oh my God. My team, they're like, Jesse, I'm like, 1 million builders in 2023. 1 million bankless in 2024. They're like too crazy, Jesse. And I'm not crazy enough. Not crazy enough.
01:18:28.350 - 01:18:51.334, Speaker A: I mean, this is something that we've been saying at Bankless from the get go. We want 1 billion people to go Bankless. And the way that we do that is with technology that scales. Yes. And we haven't been ready for it for the last while, but really just in the last few days, I mean, not few days, few years, we've crossed over. The infrastructure is there. Layer twos are getting cheap enough.
01:18:51.334 - 01:19:05.126, Speaker A: Wallets are getting good enough. We are at the inflection point where on chain is going to become the next online. We are going to have a million builders and then we will have a billion bank lists in quick succession. Okay, here's the line that I've got for you. Yes. Okay. Base makes coinbase bankless.
01:19:05.126 - 01:19:12.986, Speaker A: Base makes coinbase. Bankless. Base makes coinbase better. Base makes coinbase. On chain native company. I mean, this is why we're here. We're so.
01:19:12.986 - 01:19:48.882, Speaker A: Fired up. I want to tie the bow on the BD conversation because I think what I really want listeners to be impressed with is that it's one thing when something like arbitram or polygon or optimism does their BD effort for some non crypto thing. Who are these people? A lot of outside of people, they don't know who these teams are, but Coinbase does have that brand. And so coinbase BD effort hits different. And so this is really about growing the pie to do BD for the whole entire industry, leveraging the legitimacy of Coinbase. Yeah. I don't think people are ready for the work we're going to do to bring people on chain.
01:19:48.882 - 01:20:14.698, Speaker A: This is our mission. We're going to bring a billion people on chain so that they can transact and live in the crypto economy and so they can have increased economic freedom that just makes their lives better and makes the world a better place. It's pretty crazy and immaculate to see Jesse, that I found. Somebody said like, oh, yeah, there's the base booth. I'm like, Where's the base booth? And well, then that's when I learned, oh, it's in the basement. I'm like, so, okay, first off, that's great. But then I come down here and it's an entire floor.
01:20:14.698 - 01:20:45.580, Speaker A: And so base is only just like a few weeks old. An announcement not even like a week and a half or so, and already there's talks about building on base. There are people what looks like an Apple studio, like, learning about how to build on base, and it's already full, so the excitement out of the gate I've never seen before in crypto. So congratulations for the work that you've done. We're so lucky to have such a great team building on base, building base. And then we're so great to have so many incredible people building on base. It's been one week exactly today's the one.
01:20:45.580 - 01:21:02.640, Speaker A: And I am just so grateful to get to be a part of this and get to be a part of making crypto happen. It's really just humbling to see all the great work that you guys have been doing. And so thank you for helping scale the world and helping the world. Go bankless. Awesome. Thank you, Jesse. Appreciate it.
01:21:02.640 - 01:21:27.970, Speaker A: A million builders so we can have a billion bankless. It come on down, brother.
