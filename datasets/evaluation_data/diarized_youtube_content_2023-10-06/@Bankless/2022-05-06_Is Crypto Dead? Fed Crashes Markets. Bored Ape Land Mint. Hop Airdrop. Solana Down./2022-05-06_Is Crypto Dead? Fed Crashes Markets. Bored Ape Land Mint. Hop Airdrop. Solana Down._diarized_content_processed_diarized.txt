00:00:00.170 - 00:00:06.510, Speaker A: Red alert. This is an attack on Defi. I know I'm laughing, but it's also not funny. They're coming for Defi.
00:00:08.850 - 00:00:12.714, Speaker B: Bankless Nation is the first week of May, and it's Friday morning. So what time is it, David?
00:00:12.762 - 00:00:22.478, Speaker A: It's the Friday bankless weekly roll up time, Ryan, where we cover it the entire week of news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless. Ryan, what happened this week?
00:00:22.564 - 00:00:35.958, Speaker B: Look, man, so much happened this week. Oh, first of all, David, by the way, I'm excited to see you at permissionless in person. That's coming up really soon. So we're going to meet in person for the first time. We'll talk about that later. Yes, allegedly, I am a real person. Okay.
00:00:35.958 - 00:00:50.854, Speaker B: I don't know where these rumors came from, but what are we going to talk about this week? First, we got to start with the Fed watch. All right. Jerome Powell packed his biggest punch yet, a largest interest rate hike since the year 2000 that had an impact on markets. We'll cover that in the markets section. What else we got, David?
00:00:50.902 - 00:01:08.960, Speaker A: Yeah, speaking of impact on markets, the gas wars this week were absolutely insane. The board ape virtual land sale created $166,000,000 of transaction fees, burned an absolute ton of ETH. There's a bunch of fiasco and bunch of drama with that leading to a brand new ape chain question mark.
00:01:09.330 - 00:01:19.606, Speaker B: I don't know if that's a good idea. We'll have to talk about that. Also, Solana went down again. I don't know if this is the fourth, the fifth time, the 6th time. Should they convert to banker hours at this point?
00:01:19.628 - 00:01:22.534, Speaker A: David down for working hours only?
00:01:22.652 - 00:01:26.502, Speaker B: Yeah, just no Saturday Sunday hours. We'll talk about that, too. What else we got?
00:01:26.556 - 00:01:51.834, Speaker A: A troll is suing pool together for a quarter billion dollars, which is ridiculous. They put $10 into pool together and then immediately filed a class action lawsuit against pool together. This person doing this has very strong connections to, you guessed it, Elizabeth Warren. So this is a red alert. This is an attack on Defi. I know I'm laughing, but it's also not funny. They're coming for Defi.
00:01:51.834 - 00:01:56.638, Speaker A: So we all need to get up to speed with what the hell is going on with the attack on pool together.
00:01:56.724 - 00:02:10.382, Speaker B: Yeah, man, I've lost some money in Defi. Maybe there's some lawsuits I could talk about, but we also have a new airdrop that's coming. I hope you're ready for this. We're not going to reveal what it is, but be sure to listen to this episode to find out more. What else should they do, David?
00:02:10.446 - 00:02:34.218, Speaker A: Oh, they got to just like subscribe, rate and review. Ryan, if you're watching on YouTube, you gotta click that button so you can go and subscribe. This comes out every Friday, and it's the most high energy way to recap the news in crypto. Also the most entertaining. But also, if you are listening to this on the podcast, please rate and review the bankless podcast, the number one podcast in crypto. You know it. We want to make sure that we get to the mainstream, and we need those reviews to get that done.
00:02:34.304 - 00:02:43.102, Speaker B: Look at David hyping us up, man. But you know, this is a lot of fun. I enjoy doing this every Friday. This happens every Friday, guys. So come back for the next Friday and subscribe so you don't miss it.
00:02:43.156 - 00:02:44.398, Speaker A: Fridays happen every week.
00:02:44.484 - 00:02:58.618, Speaker B: Fridays do happen every week. That means we're recording a lot. David. You know what else we're doing? We're doing a lot of experiments. In web3. We have this theme on bankless where you can join crypto and become a self sovereign employee. You can work for a bunch of dows.
00:02:58.618 - 00:03:24.638, Speaker B: There's massive opportunities to be sort of a self sovereign worker and independent contractor in this new economy. But the thing you're going to need if you move from your cushy corporate job is health insurance. You need some benefits. You need someone to manage payroll. Opolis does all of that for you in a box. This is a way to pay yourself in crypto. They handle health insurance, they handle dental, they handle medical, they handle all of it.
00:03:24.638 - 00:03:44.002, Speaker B: And they'll even pay your payroll in crypto so you can start receiving your salary in crypto from a Dow. So if you are a Dow employee or want to work for dows in the future, you got to investigate this. This can onboard you into crypto, David. There's some benefits here when people sign up, right? Some deadlines and benefits. What are those?
00:03:44.056 - 00:04:13.462, Speaker A: Oh, the web3 always has benefits. Ryan. If you sign up with Opelis before May 25, 2022, that is this month, as the end of this month, you get 1000 work tokens, the native token of Opolis, and 1000 bank tokens when you sign up and you get your first paycheck paid by Opolis, basically it's a collective. It's a big collective. A dow for getting good health care rates, basically derisking the process of becoming a self sovereign worker in web3. That's why we love Opolis. It's a dow that services other dows.
00:04:13.606 - 00:04:24.302, Speaker B: Guys you can go check that out. The link in the show notes, it's bankless. CC Opolis. Make sure you get that capital o in there. All right, David, let's get to the markets, man. What are the markets telling us about bitcoin this week?
00:04:24.436 - 00:04:47.910, Speaker A: They were almost happy, Ryan, but now they're sad. We started the week at $39,700, trying to keep our head above that $40,000 level, which we definitely love, and we just never got there. We are currently down to 36,300. Oh, wow. It's dumping as we speak. So it was down 6.5% when I wrote this, but it looks like we're down to something like seven or 8%.
00:04:47.910 - 00:04:49.574, Speaker A: Down 8% on the week so far.
00:04:49.612 - 00:05:08.094, Speaker B: It's funny, people thought we were out of the woods. Look, after the Powell speech, you could see that on the charts, right? So the kind of Powell speech around here on Wednesday, and markets were up after Powell talked. We'll talk about what he said in our fed watch. But then a day later, bam, we got wrecked. There's a big red candle down.
00:05:08.212 - 00:05:10.606, Speaker A: We tried to be bullish, but we just couldn't do it.
00:05:10.708 - 00:05:13.422, Speaker B: Same thing happened with ETH. What's the story on ether this week?
00:05:13.476 - 00:05:30.662, Speaker A: Yeah, ether started the week at $2,940. Again, $40,000 is to bitcoin as $3,000 is to ETH. We tried to climb above $3,000. We couldn't do it. When I wrote these numbers down, it was 2700. 760. We are now down to 2720.
00:05:30.662 - 00:05:40.310, Speaker A: So that's about like down 8% on the week. Big sad face. We are setting all time lows on the week as we record right now. So, sad face.
00:05:40.460 - 00:05:59.902, Speaker B: Yeah, it's funny. It's like we thought we were out of the woods. Happy times after Fed market goes up. And what this looks like to me, I don't know what it looks like to you, David, is just whale games. The games whales play during crab season when the market doesn't know which direction to go in. And suddenly we have a massive dumpage right here.
00:06:00.036 - 00:06:17.794, Speaker A: You know what's happening, Ryan? We don't have any links in here, but people are getting liquidated this morning because on margin, even though we were at these prices on May 1. And so people aped into a leverage position like yesterday and then got liquidated today.
00:06:17.992 - 00:06:33.446, Speaker B: Of course. Yeah, they got bullish after the Fed news, and the market responded very favorably to that. And now they're paying for that the very next day and getting liquidated. That's what's going on? I can't believe people have streets, all the positions like that. But what do we know? We don't trade ETH. Bitcoin. The ratio.
00:06:33.446 - 00:06:35.014, Speaker B: What's that looking at, odly?
00:06:35.062 - 00:06:41.782, Speaker A: Looking good. It was up 1% this week, and so pretty cool. It's actually trending in an upwards direction.
00:06:41.846 - 00:06:44.194, Speaker B: Do you ever look at this in trading? View the technicals?
00:06:44.262 - 00:06:55.882, Speaker A: Yeah, that whole meter thing. Yeah, it's basically a weather vein, dude. It just follows like, did it go up recently? Then it's a buy. Did it go down recently? Then it's a sell. It's a sentiment indication, not like a technical indication.
00:06:55.946 - 00:07:01.874, Speaker B: It's not what technicals are, though, just sentiment indication. Is it more than that? Are the triangles more than that? Do they mean triangles are more than that?
00:07:01.912 - 00:07:17.160, Speaker A: The triangles are more than that. But in the same. We recorded a podcast with Jim O'Shaughnessy, and one of the big TLDRs is that narrative follows price. And so, yeah, people are happy about their assets when they go up in price like crazy thought.
00:07:17.610 - 00:07:33.306, Speaker B: That's a great episode, by the way, that's coming out Monday and has a whole bunch of tips that Jim relays to us that are super useful in crypto and how not to fall prey to the FuD and the FOMO and all the psychological trap traps we can fall into crypto. How about the total market cap of crypto? We up, we down?
00:07:33.408 - 00:07:44.986, Speaker A: We're down. If you go to that 24 hours tab, we started the week at $1.9 trillion. We are currently down to $1.77 trillion. So lost $130,000,000,000 in crypto.
00:07:45.018 - 00:08:08.898, Speaker B: Market cap this last week, we lost half in Elon. I think that's the measure. But let's talk about the Fed stuff, because that is dictating some of the outcomes in the market. At least, I think right now, the Fed just raised rates by half a percentage point. So that's 0.5%. That's the biggest interest rate hike in two decades. The goal, of course, is to fight inflation.
00:08:08.898 - 00:08:31.790, Speaker B: It's the largest since 2000. As I mentioned, it's the first time since 2006 that the Fed has increased rates in back to back meetings. Okay, so they did that. They also announced some guidance to the future. So it's not just happening in May, 50.5% increase in May. They're also planning another .5%
00:08:31.790 - 00:08:48.610, Speaker B: increase in June and also in July. That's what Powell's guidance is saying. And then he provides a bit more guidance as well. But basically, they're doing some quantitative tightening. So that means, you know, that balance sheet that they racked up over COVID and like the last couple of decades.
00:08:48.690 - 00:08:50.726, Speaker A: Of debt that they've accumulated since 2000.
00:08:50.748 - 00:09:11.274, Speaker B: It'S about $9 trillion at this point. All right. They're reducing it by 50 billion a month, and they're planning to do that in June and July and August. So that's a quarter of an Elon or so. They're going to reduce their budget by and then September, and going forward they're going to get even more aggressive. And it's probably 100 billion a month.
00:09:11.312 - 00:09:20.174, Speaker A: But you say $9 trillion debt trillion. And they're trying to pay it back at $50 billion a month.
00:09:20.212 - 00:09:21.802, Speaker B: Yeah, you got to do those down payments.
00:09:21.946 - 00:09:31.506, Speaker A: What does $50 billion do to the face of $9 trillion? You know how many months that'll take, Ryan? I just did the math because I'm a math whiz. 180 months.
00:09:31.688 - 00:09:32.130, Speaker B: Okay.
00:09:32.200 - 00:09:35.950, Speaker A: 15 years, doable. 15 years to pay back the debt.
00:09:36.110 - 00:09:38.414, Speaker B: Don't say it's not doable, David. It's doable.
00:09:38.542 - 00:09:41.650, Speaker A: 15 years. I guess it's shorter than the most home mortgages.
00:09:41.730 - 00:10:05.266, Speaker B: Well, Powell says we don't want to do things too quickly. And that's part of the thing because a soft landing is the goal. So what he means by soft landing is basically like, we're not planning to do this until we wreck the economy. We just want a soft landing. So we're just not trying to cause a recession here, guys. All right. He said the strong economy can handle these rising rates right now and some of this quantitative tightening.
00:10:05.266 - 00:10:19.330, Speaker B: And I guess we see if he's right. But what that also means to me, maybe the market responded with this, is like, if there's indications of the r word recession and some blood in the streets, then some of these plans could reverse. Maybe the market's anticipating that.
00:10:19.400 - 00:10:58.846, Speaker A: The story here is there is a needle to thread with. Can we fight inflation and also not cause a recession at the same time? And so that is the Fed's drop to thread that needle. Let's raise interest rates to fight inflation, but also let's raise interest rates, not too much so that we cause the r word, the recession word. There's a bunch of debate as to whether that hole in that needle even exists, Ryan. So, like, we actually might just have to be chosen. Choose one. What do we want, the recession or the inflation? Which nut do you want to be punched in? But basically what's going on is the Fed is saying, hey, we're going to raise interest rates this many times throughout the future.
00:10:58.846 - 00:11:05.200, Speaker A: And to put this into a visual terms, it's just like, imagine it's like, hey, we're going to punch the market in the stomach seven times.
00:11:05.570 - 00:11:08.466, Speaker B: I'm glad you went with the stomach, because I was getting the visual there.
00:11:08.648 - 00:11:28.118, Speaker A: And then the market braces for seven punches. And it does that by selling off. That's what we saw through January, through now. But then the Fed is like, oh, we've changed. We're actually going to punch you guys eight times. Or perhaps they say, oh, we're going to only punch you guys six times. And so the market can brace or unbrace based off of how many times the Fed is going to punch it.
00:11:28.204 - 00:11:44.046, Speaker B: And to be fair, we're calling these punches. But it's just like, I mean, they got us drunk first, right? Like, the market's totally, like, drunk. And here's a tweet you wanted to talk about this. It says party hardy, and then dot, dot, dot hangover. And what we're looking at. Well, why don't you explain what we're looking at here? Yeah.
00:11:44.068 - 00:11:54.250, Speaker A: This is the disposable personal income amount over the last, what, like 50, 60 years? And during the middle of COVID you see this real personal disposable income.
00:11:54.330 - 00:11:57.266, Speaker B: It's like savings in the bank, right? Yeah, just like personal saving.
00:11:57.368 - 00:12:35.950, Speaker A: How much cash? You got your slush fund, your personal slush fund, and it jumped up, like, four times higher than it has ever been in the last 50 years as a result of COVID because of the steamy checks, the unemployment income. And so that was like, what everyone was talking about. Oh, they're roaring 20s, like, everyone's partying. We got all this money, and then in 2022, when they start to fight that inflation, it goes in the complete opposite direction. So now people have less disposable personal income than they've ever had in the last 50 years as well. So it's just like whiplash. First we got a bunch of money, now everyone's poor.
00:12:36.290 - 00:12:37.978, Speaker B: It is scary, people. Scary.
00:12:38.074 - 00:12:50.420, Speaker A: Yeah. Tech stocks have erased all of their gains. Like, all of these Wall street best traders and Djen, Robin Hood traders, they don't have any money anymore. And so all the money's gone. All the money's gone.
00:12:50.950 - 00:13:08.050, Speaker B: Yeah. And the money is evaporating before our eyes with inflation as well. This is the kind of volatility, something that you've said recently and we've said for a while at bankless is like, hey, you know that volatility that you're trying to avoid in the crypto market. Well, it's coming for the real world. Here it is. Look at this. Whiplash.
00:13:08.050 - 00:13:17.254, Speaker B: Positive 30%. Now we're negative 20% in the space of just a couple of quarters. Let's stop talking about fiat, though, David.
00:13:17.302 - 00:13:19.354, Speaker A: I want to talk about the new economy. Let's talk about.
00:13:19.392 - 00:13:29.280, Speaker B: Yeah, the new economy. The economy. That is actually enjoyable to look at. We put out bankless, put out Ethereum's Q one results. And what does this look like?
00:13:29.970 - 00:13:33.902, Speaker A: Bullish. Is that the answer that you wanted for me? I want more detail.
00:13:33.956 - 00:13:34.318, Speaker B: Now.
00:13:34.404 - 00:13:59.474, Speaker A: We'll go into this. Yeah, hang on. All right, so Ethereum is a protocol, so it's not going to release its quarterly report. So somebody has to do it on Ethereum's behalf. So we have volunteered, we put our lead analyst minds on the case, and they've produced a report, ethereum Q one results. You can review this on the newsletter, but here are four quick facts to cover what the state of the Ethereum economy is in the last quarter, 2.4 billion in transaction fees.
00:13:59.474 - 00:14:10.742, Speaker A: That's up 86% year over year. Plus, 2.1 of that billion was burned in ETH. So $3 billion paid in tips to miners. $2.1 billion of ether burned.
00:14:10.806 - 00:14:14.334, Speaker B: Can I just pause? I want to pause there after you're done. Sorry, Dave, I interrupted you.
00:14:14.372 - 00:14:25.342, Speaker A: Which created a 54% decrease in ether issuance as a result of EIP 1559. So while the US dollar is inflating, the inflation rate of ether got cut in half.
00:14:25.476 - 00:14:44.582, Speaker B: That is so cool. This is so cool. So what we're saying is like, if you look at the US government, which is operating in a deficit, the ethereum economy. The Ethereum government brought in $2.4 billion in transaction fees, and then this ETH burned. That's essentially a dividend back to all the ETH holders. It's a freedom dividend to use.
00:14:44.582 - 00:15:03.650, Speaker B: Andrew Ye. It's a stimulus. And ETH owners, like people who own ETH, got $2.1 billion in value back. So we're going the complete opposite direction of fiat economy. There's no $9 trillion deficit here. We're actually like giving the surplus back to ETH holders.
00:15:03.750 - 00:15:08.766, Speaker A: It's exactly right. Take us through the next one. Because DFI did some cool things. Talk about DFI. Yeah.
00:15:08.788 - 00:15:30.802, Speaker B: So there was also incredible growth in DFI, as you'd imagine. So 2700% increase in perpetuals volume, which is huge. 657% growth in spot volumes, and also another doubling of stablecoin supplies. That's pretty impressive on its own. Can you tell us about the NFT ecosystem?
00:15:30.866 - 00:15:57.742, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. We can't not talk about NFT ecosystem because at some point the NFT ecosystem just broke all metrics. What does it mean when trading volumes rise 19,000%? I don't even know how to quantify that. But that's what happened to the NFT market. 19,000% increase year over year. That's $116,000,000,000 worth of NFTs traded in Q. $116,000,000,000 in Q one.
00:15:57.742 - 00:16:00.330, Speaker A: Ryan. Q one. That's just one quarter.
00:16:00.410 - 00:16:09.346, Speaker B: A crazy quarter. It's a bullish quarter. I certainly like looking at these numbers rather than fed numbers. There's also a really cool chart here, David, that you uncovered. Talk about this. Yeah.
00:16:09.368 - 00:16:36.794, Speaker A: This is a brand new Dune analytics dashboard, probably covering the most global set of metrics about ether and Ethereum at large. So it starts with the basics like the price and the market cap, but then it gets into more granular stuff, like how many wallets there are, 205,000,000. How many total transactions there are, 1.56 billion. How many blocks have there been? 14.7 million? 50 million smart contracts created. And then you get to see some gas metrics, the price over time.
00:16:36.794 - 00:17:00.898, Speaker A: So it's like the most global universal satellite level view of just the state of the ethereum economy. And the cool thing about this is that it's real time, like bankless. The Q one, Q two quarterly reports. Those are really useful to compare quarter over quarter. But also this dashboard just compares granularly, block by block by block, for the complete state of the Ethereum economy. Never before have seen metrics going into economies coming out of crypto right now.
00:17:00.984 - 00:17:10.358, Speaker B: That's awesome. I guess they did our job. We could just screenshot this. And this should be in real time optimism doing some things, too. What's up?
00:17:10.444 - 00:17:15.634, Speaker A: Oh, we saw this comment from a long way off. You remember the whole L2 two summer, Ryan, that's.
00:17:15.682 - 00:17:16.518, Speaker B: Oh, I remember.
00:17:16.604 - 00:17:49.534, Speaker A: Yeah, right. Yeah. It was always predicated on tokens because tokens create incentives and we need liquidity mining incentives, adoption incentives. And today, or this week, I mean, optimism has announced their stimpac, their stimpac program, along with one of their very famous, slightly indie hippie niche memes that I don't really get, but they always do these od neat memes. It's cute. But also, I kind of don't get it, but I do get it at the same time. Anyways, for the listeners, it's a cat looking at a fish.
00:17:49.534 - 00:17:51.426, Speaker A: And this fish is the stim pack.
00:17:51.528 - 00:17:53.906, Speaker B: Anyway, peekaboo, though, it's a surprise for the cat.
00:17:54.008 - 00:17:57.458, Speaker A: Here you go. Okay.
00:17:57.544 - 00:18:02.294, Speaker B: Give to the community. The cat is the community in this picture, the fish is the liquidity mining you're going to get.
00:18:02.332 - 00:18:28.202, Speaker A: Right, well, okay, so the op token is not yet unlocked. People got their airdrop, but they have not been able to claim their airdrop. That happens in just a few weeks. There are 230,000,000 op tokens coming to liquidity mining incentives, just project growth incentives for context, the optimism total supply is like 4.2 billion. So 230,000,000 of that 4.2 billion supply going to incentivize project growth on optimism.
00:18:28.202 - 00:18:29.760, Speaker A: Ryan, can you smell that?
00:18:30.690 - 00:18:32.974, Speaker B: The fish or the money or L2?
00:18:33.012 - 00:18:33.694, Speaker A: Two.
00:18:33.892 - 00:18:55.398, Speaker B: I smell L2. Two, in fact. Look, man, we've released two episodes on this this week called the trillion dollar opportunity in L2s. I think that's what it's called. And it's a two parter, and it's a must. Listen, if you're interested in all of our thoughts on the opportunities ahead in layer 222, summer. Summer of 20.
00:18:55.398 - 00:18:58.886, Speaker B: Summer of L2. Yeah, all of it.
00:18:59.068 - 00:19:28.142, Speaker A: Most of the opportunities, I think, are pretty expected. Like just looking at the native tokens of the L2s, the optimism token, the probably coming arbitrum token, then the tokens on L2s, like the Libra token, all these apps, and then also the liquidity mining. All this stuff is known. But then part two of this whole series is something that I'm pretty sure 99% of listeners, 99.9% of listeners have not yet heard of. And the magnitude of this opportunity is equal to all the other opportunities on L2. So don't fade that podcast.
00:19:28.286 - 00:19:48.206, Speaker B: Yeah, listen to them both back to back. Okay, nfts. All right, so DeFi seems a little dead these days, David, but what's propping up the ethereum economy these days? It's nFts again. People thought nFTs were dead. When will the JPegs go down in price? It's like never is the answer. What's happening here? What are some metrics that are relevant?
00:19:48.338 - 00:20:21.262, Speaker A: Well, okay, so there's been 116,000,000 transactions on NFTs, which are absolutely crazy. OpeNc registered more than $476,000,000 worth of MFT trades on one day. That was one day. That's half a billion dollars of volume on May 1 as a result of the other side project launch. Which we will get into in just a little bit. The single previous day record for Openc was $323,000,000 set on August 29, 2021. So NFTs continue to break records.
00:20:21.262 - 00:20:47.574, Speaker A: However, I will say that there is a lot of churn in NFTs. Volume does seem to be just kind of permanently leaving many projects and going into newer projects. So there's always this churn, this rolling forward of the NFT ecosystem where volume seems to be going all time highs every single quarter. It's going into new projects every single. So like, it's not like Defi tokens where the same tokens are around quarter after quarter after quarter. There's always something new in the NFT.
00:20:47.622 - 00:20:50.922, Speaker B: World because everyone's always looking for the next new shiny. Right?
00:20:50.976 - 00:20:51.530, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:51.680 - 00:21:06.510, Speaker B: That's how it goes, guys. And we've got some more stuff to cover for you, including the ape gas fiasco. David just alluded to it. We're going to talk more about that. Ens markets are on fire as well. We're going to discuss why and what's the last one. This is big, David.
00:21:08.850 - 00:21:32.802, Speaker A: I hope it comes out by the time I say this, because if it doesn't, I'll be in trouble. But the hop drop. The hop drop is coming. It's a drop and we're gonna hop about it and it's gonna be fun. Alright, guys, so all of those details are coming up in the second half of the show. We'll talk about the hop drop and other related things right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that help you go bankless. If you're trying to grow and preserve your crypto wealth, optimizing your taxes is just as lucrative as trying to find the next hidden gem.
00:21:32.802 - 00:22:03.918, Speaker A: Also, IRA can help you invest in crypto in tax advantage, ways to help you preserve your hardearned money. Also, crypto IRA lets you invest in more than 150 coins and tokens with all the same tax advantages of an IRA. They make it easy to fund your alternative IRA or crypto IRA via your 401K or by contributing directly from your bank account. There is no setup or account fees, and it's all you need to do to invest in crypto tax free. Let me repeat that again. You can invest in crypto tax free. Diversify like the pros and trade without tax headaches.
00:22:03.918 - 00:22:37.034, Speaker A: Open an Alto cryptoira to invest in crypto tax free. Just go to altoira.com bankless. That's altoira.com bankless and start investing in crypto today. The brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 Internet with over 50 million monthly active users, control your digital footprint with built in privacy and ad blocking inside the brave browser, you'll find the brave wallet, the first secure crypto wallet built natively inside of a web3 crypto browser. Web three is freedom from big tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy.
00:22:37.034 - 00:23:08.966, Speaker A: But there's a weak point in web3, your crypto wallet. The brave wallet is different. Bravewall is built natively inside the brave browser, no extension required, which gives the brave wallet an extra level of security versus other wallets. With the brave wallet, you can buy, store, send and swap your crypto assets, and it can even manage your NFTs and connect to other wallets and defi apps, all from the security of the best privacy browser on the market. Whether you're new to crypto or a seasoned pro, it's time to switch to the brave wallet. Download Brave@brave.com bankless and click the wallet icon to get started.
00:23:08.966 - 00:24:00.810, Speaker A: Ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol and now Ave v three is here. Ave v Three has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of DFI, including isolation mode, which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types, and also efficiency mode, which allows for higher loan to value ratios and of course, portals, allowing users to port their AAVE position across all of the networks that AAvE operates on like polygon, Phantom, Avalanche, arbitrum, optimism and harmony. The beautiful thing about AAVE is that it's completely open source, decentralized and governed by its community, enabling a truly bankless future for us all. To get your first cryptocolateralized loan, get started@ave.com. That's aave.com. And also check out the Ave protocol governance forums to see what more than 100,000 Dow members are all robbing about at governance ave.com. All right guys, we are back.
00:24:00.810 - 00:24:53.162, Speaker A: Newly released on the scene, Lido is doing an interesting scorecard for themselves. They are giving themselves a self assessment on all the things that make Lido Lido. So I just really like this because it's just transparency and making the weaknesses of Daos explicit. You can check this out at scorecard Lido fi and they just go through and give themselves a rating, a self assessment on every single variable of every single metric that they need to work on. And so they have things like node distribution geographically around the world. They have things like governance that needs to be improvement, such as is there a robust set of lido governance delegates? Is Lido governance have sufficient safeguards? Governance seems to be the weak one. But I just like the explicitness and the intentionality that Lido is putting into giving themselves a rating on vectors that they need to improve on.
00:24:53.216 - 00:25:30.790, Speaker B: Yeah, we really need Lido to become more decentralized or other staking pools to kind of pick up the slack. Rocket pool is there. Of course, they're more decentralized in a lot of ways than Lido, but they have not been able to accrue the massive amount of stake that Lido has. And so you see most of the issues on the scorecard, the decentralization scorecard are all governance related, involved with who can be a Lido validator and who cannot be, and how upgrades happen. This sort of, yeah, you know, what gets measured, gets managed. And look, they're naming it, so hopefully they get better. And this is super important because there's some debate in the Ethereum community about the massive amount of stake that Lido has accrued over time.
00:25:30.790 - 00:25:52.570, Speaker B: And it's more decentralized than, say, a coinbase doing this. But still, there's a lot of centralization vectors, and that is not a good thing for Ethereum long term. Also, David, it's early in the game, though. We haven't even done the merge. You can't even withdraw your stake. So I expect a lot of things to play out, but hopefully Lido goes in the path of making their protocol more decentralized over time.
00:25:52.640 - 00:26:10.510, Speaker A: Yeah, and overall, it's just giving a roadmap to other alternatives, other staking as a service, people saying, hey, if you're trying to do a staking as a service thing, here are the variables that you also need to work on. So I think I consider it just like a public good for the ecosystem, just touting out knowledge about the difficulties and what needs to be targeted.
00:26:10.590 - 00:26:13.394, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm pretty happy. Let's see progress. What's next?
00:26:13.432 - 00:26:44.542, Speaker A: David, Ens constitution. There is a constitution, a literal book for the ENS Dao, a set of binding rules that determine what governance actions are legitimate for the Dow to take. But this is instantiated in a book. So there's a physical book. A physical book, yeah. Well, you can download the digital edition for free, but you can buy a physical edition for about $115. But in addition to the physical book, there's also the special limited edition where you can bid using the ENF token on 25 numbered copies out of a total of 50.
00:26:44.542 - 00:27:11.842, Speaker A: I would imagine the other 25 goes to like, horror Dow members, but there's a physical copy, a physical constitution with special edition being bidded on sometime soon. Actually, it already started. It ends in five days. So, like, real world relics about our dows, which are kind of cool. If you are that into Ens, which you might be, if you are in the ten K club, which we'll talk about in a second, you might be interested in buying one of these special editions of the ENS constitution.
00:27:11.986 - 00:27:16.674, Speaker B: That's cool. Very cool. What's this, David? We got a transaction. Heat map feature from Etherscan.
00:27:16.722 - 00:27:38.026, Speaker A: Yeah, this is just good data visualization. So right now, a new feature out of ether scan is you can go into a specific contract or a specific address, and you can just look at the heat map for activity, as in, just how active has that contract been over the last year? The cool thing is you can do this for every single contract, so you can just get a nice little visualization of the activity around addresses.
00:27:38.058 - 00:27:42.362, Speaker B: What am I looking at? Is this less. More what? Transactions for this particular contract.
00:27:42.426 - 00:27:43.854, Speaker A: Just like, raw transaction number.
00:27:43.972 - 00:28:05.606, Speaker B: Ah, cool. That's cool. Yeah, ether scan just continues to pump it out, pump out the features. Raise time, man, every week, I feel like there's a new crypto fund that's raised some money. This is a crypto fund that is investing primarily in public tokens. The title of this article is crypto. Wonderkids secure $85 million to start their own hedge fund.
00:28:05.606 - 00:28:18.406, Speaker B: Ryan Watkins is in on this. We've had him on the podcast before. He's a former analyst at Masari. Definitely knows what he's doing. And there's a lot of big investors backing this particular fund. Who are they, David?
00:28:18.518 - 00:28:32.746, Speaker A: Oh, my God, there's so many. Brad Burnham from Union Square Ventures. We got Apollo Global Management. Co founders Josh Harris, also doe Kwan. I think y'all know who he is. Alameda research from out of SBF's camp. And also got multi coin Capital's Kyle Somani.
00:28:32.746 - 00:28:35.054, Speaker A: So, some big chads going into this fund.
00:28:35.172 - 00:28:55.234, Speaker B: What's cool about this is I do think that there's something to the thesis that the real opportunity is not private markets in crypto. It's actually undervalued public markets. And so I expect this fund and others to follow to see if that thesis plays out. Here's another one. Syndicate, they just got another $6 million in funding. What is syndicate, David?
00:28:55.282 - 00:29:37.950, Speaker A: Yeah, syndicate is a new fund. It's $6 million isn't all that much, but it's the structure of syndicate that is more unique. It's kind of like a Y combinator for DFI, but for dows. And it's trying to figure out how do we include as many people as possible, compliantly and legally, which is the challenge into the fund. And so they have raised as a result of this, a total of $28 million in just this year. Again, a very robust name of contenders on this list, a 16 Z carta ledger, Circle Ventures, Openc, Uniswap Labs, Coin list, polygon, ygg pool suites, affirmion, outliers, VC, Dow, creators of friends with benefits, Rugradio, Loot, Project, Deadfellas, Nansin, like all of these people are part of syndicate.
00:29:38.030 - 00:30:10.926, Speaker B: The cool thing about this is it's not actually a fund. It's a tool set that allows people to create decentralized investment clubs. They have like over a thousand different investment clubs that they've created on this fund. And so this is another $6 million to fund that infrastructure and that tool set. So more investment clubs coming to crypto, more democratization of finance, which is definitely what we need. We need fewer. You have to own a million dollars or over in order to invest in this fund, and more capital structures for the people.
00:30:10.926 - 00:30:18.466, Speaker B: And hopefully DeFi brings that about. David, it's jobs time, but we also have a community question going into this. What's the question?
00:30:18.568 - 00:30:42.470, Speaker A: Yeah, so we are doing a new segment called community questions. They're going to go at the end, but because this particular question is relevant to jobs, we are raising that question up to the job section. And so degenerate, I love the name, says, are there jobs in web3 for people who don't have experience in web two or code? And degenerate, I think we got plenty of answers for you on the bankless jobs board. The answer is yes, they definitely are.
00:30:42.620 - 00:31:05.794, Speaker B: I'm going to go to that jobs board and show the positions. Maybe as we go through, we highlight them, because it's time for us to tell you that you should be getting a job in crypto. Now's the time. Crypto companies, crypto projects, they are hiring hard right now, and you should investigate. You should be on their list. You can enroll in the collaborative, submit your resume. Also, I'm going to read out a few samples of jobs that crypto companies are hiring for.
00:31:05.794 - 00:31:11.902, Speaker B: As David dances, and listen for the ones that are non technical. The first is a marketing manager.
00:31:11.966 - 00:31:12.926, Speaker A: Non technical.
00:31:13.118 - 00:31:15.214, Speaker B: Non technical. VP of engineering.
00:31:15.262 - 00:31:16.318, Speaker A: That one's technical.
00:31:16.494 - 00:31:16.978, Speaker B: Yes.
00:31:17.064 - 00:31:19.794, Speaker A: Head of growth. That one's on lead.
00:31:19.832 - 00:31:20.526, Speaker B: Community manager.
00:31:20.558 - 00:31:21.642, Speaker A: That's on technicals.
00:31:21.726 - 00:31:26.854, Speaker B: Senior product designer, parcel kind of technical. Not really, though. Ethereum, core developer mind.
00:31:26.892 - 00:31:27.742, Speaker A: Extremely technical.
00:31:27.826 - 00:31:35.546, Speaker B: Yeah. Don't sorry, that one's technical. Golang engineer, starknet client, Nethermind as well, bankless newsletter editor. What's that?
00:31:35.568 - 00:31:37.238, Speaker A: Non technical? That's non technical.
00:31:37.414 - 00:31:42.730, Speaker B: Content manager at Tally, that's non technical. Director of developer relations at Vallast.
00:31:42.890 - 00:31:44.990, Speaker A: That might be a little technical, a little bit.
00:31:45.060 - 00:31:47.114, Speaker B: Not really though. Solidity architect, aloo.
00:31:47.162 - 00:31:48.250, Speaker A: Yeah, that's definitely technical.
00:31:48.330 - 00:31:56.534, Speaker B: Marketing manager, mesh, non technical. Ux designer, Prometheus research labs, kind of mixed results and community manager at Degen Dogs club.
00:31:56.602 - 00:31:58.974, Speaker A: Definitely non technical. You just need to be sociable.
00:31:59.102 - 00:32:16.562, Speaker B: So as you can see, degenerati, there are a lot of opportunities for people who want non technical career trajectories in crypto. In fact, I feel like that's a lot of the demand these days. That's where some of the like, people need managers, people need people's growth skills, marketing skills, community writing skills, writing. Writing skills, universal.
00:32:16.626 - 00:32:18.002, Speaker A: Writing skills are universal.
00:32:18.146 - 00:32:31.402, Speaker B: Get a job in crypto, guys, even if you're non technical. Especially if you're non technical. The bankless job board has those jobs for you. So go submit your resume, submit your profile, or take a look at one of those jobs. David, you ready to get to news man?
00:32:31.536 - 00:32:33.338, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it. Are we ready for it?
00:32:33.424 - 00:32:35.758, Speaker B: Yeah, this one's big. Why don't you lead with it?
00:32:35.844 - 00:32:59.858, Speaker A: This is what I'm dubbing the hops drop hop protocol, one of my favorite bridging protocols. It allows you to be a bridge or across all the L2s and back to the layer one. And they a while ago teased this loading bar, which is like really close to finish. And also I hit up the hop team. There is no official hop team. There's actually a really cool story behind hop. They've never taken any venture capital, Ryan.
00:32:59.954 - 00:33:00.358, Speaker B: Really?
00:33:00.444 - 00:33:24.026, Speaker A: Yeah, they've never taken any money. They just started building out hop protocol. They put a team together and it's a little bit like Ens Dow where they have not taken any outside investors. And so how they are releasing this token, they call it the fair launch, where like uniswap was the fair launch. Right. Retroactive token, because no one saw it coming. No one even knew what the term retroactive token airdrop was.
00:33:24.026 - 00:33:39.566, Speaker A: But now that's been gamed and so hot protocol, they've been doing this fair, fair launch strategy where they kind of just figure it out, they just give it, hey, you've done some work. Here's some tokens. You've done a lot of work. Here's a lot of tokens. And it looks like they are teasing. Perhaps again, what I'm dubbing the hop.
00:33:39.598 - 00:33:49.382, Speaker B: Drop well, and perhaps they might be coming, perhaps on the bankless podcast and YouTube channel. Perhaps tomorrow or tomorrow for us today.
00:33:49.436 - 00:34:01.266, Speaker A: For the listener, Friday. So 01:00 p.m. Pacific time. 04:00 p.m. Eastern time. At the very least, hop will be launching the Dow. And so we're going to talk about that with Chris Winfrey from Hop protocol.
00:34:01.458 - 00:34:01.862, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:01.916 - 00:34:11.014, Speaker A: So as we're expecting some announcements, probably by the time this podcast comes out, I hope it comes out. But anyway, stay tuned for the live stream with Chris Winfrey of hot protocol.
00:34:11.062 - 00:34:37.378, Speaker B: Yeah, we should say at the time of recording, it's unknown whether there is going to be an airdrop associated with this or not. But when people say Dow, they also generally mean token because how is a Dow governed by tokens? You guys put one in one together and join us at 01:00 p.m. Pacific time today to hear what they have to say and what some of the criteria for the Dow responsibility might be. David, what else we got to talk about?
00:34:37.384 - 00:34:37.986, Speaker A: Fiasco time.
00:34:38.008 - 00:34:56.518, Speaker B: I think it's, yeah, fiasco time. So this happened this weekend. I was kind of monitoring it a little bit, Twitter, and this one was hard to pull away from. Once you realized what happened, could you go through the board, ape yacht club, mint fiasco, the crazy gas fees that people experienced this weekend and all of the fallout that resulted.
00:34:56.614 - 00:35:18.702, Speaker A: Yeah. So listeners might remember Yugo Labs released that deck a while ago talking about their metaverse. They're going to build out a metaverse complete with virtual real estate, virtual land. So we have come to that part of the deck. There was the other side, which actually, I think is a cool name for metaverse land. Other side. Metaverse land Nft mint was happening on Ethereum.
00:35:18.702 - 00:35:44.090, Speaker A: And so this happened on Saturday. Saturday night, this mint went live. It was the largest Nft mint ever. And the demand for the other side, land NFTs, was so strong that it even crashed ether scan. Very rarely will ether scan ever go down, but they managed to get this done. The average gas price, Ryan, was absolutely insane. Never before seen gas prices.
00:35:44.090 - 00:36:27.698, Speaker A: I saw numbers up above like 3000 for a very brief moment, but, yeah, 3000 gwe for the very, very peak. But even on the coin metrics chart, you can see here just absolutely needle of a candle all the way up from the typical gas fee that's been in the last few weeks of like 40 to 50, all the way up to 800, dwarfing all of DFI summer. So that is pretty cool. 60,234 ETH were spent in gas fees. Ryan, that is absolutely insane. And in just a few, like in an hour or so, this new contract, brand new contract, becomes number six in the all time high leaderboard for burned ether. That's ahead of metamask.
00:36:27.698 - 00:36:37.830, Speaker A: That's ahead of metamask. And so just jumping up to the top, inside of 24 hours, 55,900 ether was burned.
00:36:37.910 - 00:36:38.746, Speaker B: This is it right here.
00:36:38.768 - 00:36:39.562, Speaker A: This is it right here.
00:36:39.616 - 00:36:40.262, Speaker B: Other deed.
00:36:40.326 - 00:36:40.966, Speaker A: Other deed.
00:36:40.998 - 00:36:44.014, Speaker B: Yeah, that is it on the burn leaderboard. Number one.
00:36:44.132 - 00:36:44.510, Speaker A: Crazy.
00:36:44.580 - 00:36:47.950, Speaker B: It's number one on the week. Oh, it's number one in the last 30 days.
00:36:48.020 - 00:36:51.902, Speaker A: Yeah. And then it's number six, all time.
00:36:51.956 - 00:37:01.778, Speaker B: Six taxpayer, thank you, board apes, for your contribution to Ethereum public goods funding, security. That's a pretty big contribution. Yeah.
00:37:01.864 - 00:37:02.274, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:37:02.312 - 00:37:03.522, Speaker B: It's not necessarily a good thing.
00:37:03.576 - 00:37:26.860, Speaker A: It's not a good thing because a lot of people weren't able to get their transactions through. This is what happens when Ethereum becomes super congested, is transactions fail. And so what doesn't happen is Ethereum doesn't go down. We'll talk about that in a second. But yeah, a lot of people weren't able to get their transactions through. They spent thousands on gas. But they are reportedly being refunded by Yuga labs because Yuga Labs has basically infinite money.
00:37:27.470 - 00:37:33.082, Speaker B: And then people are going like, why? If only we could have known. How could this possibly happen?
00:37:33.216 - 00:37:36.750, Speaker A: Where did this come from? Blindsided by Ethereum's congestion issue.
00:37:36.820 - 00:38:08.646, Speaker B: Completely blindsided. There's no way we would have known that an NFT auction like this would have resulted in what we saw and then didn't. Yuga Labs, I saw this tweet thread. They went through a long tweet, sort of apologizing their community, what went right, what went wrong? And one of the tweets that Yuga Labs sent out was basically like, oh, Ethereum is not sustainable. It's not scalable for the apes. And so we encourage the board, ape Yacht club Dao to start planning to migrate to its own chain. That's what they said.
00:38:08.646 - 00:38:21.098, Speaker B: So they want to move off of Ethereum. This was floated out there anyway. And create an ape chain of some sort to handle this excess transaction. Some sort of a side chain, let's call it.
00:38:21.264 - 00:38:24.506, Speaker A: Are you sure that's what side chain? Other people were interpreting a brand new.
00:38:24.528 - 00:38:42.494, Speaker B: Layer, one brand new layer. What's the difference? Right, is the question. It's a side chain until you can get other people to come on the thing with you and then maybe it's a layer one, but you have to kind of earn the right to be a layer one, in my opinion. Andrew Steinwald had a take on this. What was his take on Yuka Lab's potential threat to migrate?
00:38:42.542 - 00:39:03.946, Speaker A: Yeah, he puts this into context. Dapper Labs, the creator of cryptokitties, created their own chain flow because they broke ether. Ethereum back in 2017 with the Cryptokitties congestion. 2018 Axio Infinity tried to work on ETH, but transaction fees were too high, so they tried on loom. That also didn't work. Loom network is a deep cut of an old plasma chain that is no longer relevant. So that didn't work.
00:39:03.946 - 00:39:36.862, Speaker A: So they launched Ronan, the side chain. Yuga Labs now also saying Ethereum is broken, so they need a new chain. For the record, Ethereum is like five to ten times more scalable than it was back in 2017. That's a little fun fact. We actually have way more scalability than we did back in the cryptokitties days. You can talk to the immutable X team who minted a ton of on chain NFTs, but then there is some pushback on this whole thing where Fubar, he's a famous crypto twitter commentator, also a technical guy. He goes to yuka Labs saying to Yuka Labs, you guys wrote a terribly unoptimized contract.
00:39:36.862 - 00:39:51.194, Speaker A: Unoptimized NFT contract, created a gas war, lied about dutch auction mechanics to pump your own narrative, and then hid how many wallets were eligible to participate in the mint? Maybe get a solidity dev before you go trying to create binance. Smart chain 2.0.
00:39:51.312 - 00:39:51.786, Speaker B: Wow.
00:39:51.888 - 00:39:53.274, Speaker A: Hot take. Hot take.
00:39:53.392 - 00:40:07.146, Speaker B: That is a hot take, right? So basically they shot themselves in the foot. They knew that this would happen, and they're not optimizing. And instead of kind of like saying, oh, we could have done things differently, they're kind of taking their ball and going to another chain.
00:40:07.178 - 00:40:12.218, Speaker A: Yeah, they're saying, ethereum's unoptimized, and then FuBaR is basically saying, no, your contracts were unoptimized.
00:40:12.314 - 00:40:28.760, Speaker B: I think there's some skepticism. Some people are like, well, was this all planned to begin with? Because now you get to benefit potentially from the. We've got a layer one token pump. That is so popular in the narrative right now. If apecoins become a layer one coin as well.
00:40:29.610 - 00:40:56.474, Speaker A: But there is a path forward that I think it makes a ton of sense to me. This is somebody called Waycori ETH. This is what I would do if I'm Uga labs, right? Now I fork optimism, launch my own roll up. I make apes one house and the ape coin the other house. This is alluding to optimism's two house governance structure. Later, I get atomic composability with the entire optimism ecosystem. This satisfies the need for the ape chain to have its own self sovereign blockchain.
00:40:56.474 - 00:41:19.530, Speaker A: Just fork optimism. They already have. This is a beautiful thing, Ryan. The optimism team is like pioneering this whole two house governance model. One is NfT based and one is ERC 20 token based. The NFT is like this soul bound NFT for identifiable people, and the other one is the optimism token. The apes, already they have demand for a brand new chain that's their self sovereign like control, where they get to create their metaverse.
00:41:19.530 - 00:41:25.218, Speaker A: They already have the NFTs, Ryan. They're the apes and they already have the ape coin. It's the ape coin.
00:41:25.314 - 00:41:26.502, Speaker B: It's 100% the right.
00:41:26.556 - 00:41:46.078, Speaker A: All of these pieces are so perfect. This is advice, this is actual advice to any of the Yuga labs people that might be listening to this. This is the best path forward for you. And also not to fade the atomic composability with the entire optimism and other EVM equivalent chain ecosystem, not to mention the Ethereum layer one itself.
00:41:46.164 - 00:42:08.820, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's the game theoretic optimum, because otherwise you have to spend apecoins and inflation or something to pay for security. In this model, you get security of Ethereum for free, so you're not really sacrificing anything from the migration. You stay completely composable and you maintain the security. Now they might not benefit from the short term. We're an alt layer one pump, though, David. I don't know.
00:42:10.170 - 00:42:15.158, Speaker A: We're a brand new sovereign blockchain L2 on Ethereum. That's possible.
00:42:15.324 - 00:42:33.242, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a pretty obvious choice, but we'll have to see what they do from here. David, there's another big story that's happening, and that is ens names. We talked about Ens a little bit earlier and we mentioned it on the roll up, people snapping up ens names. What's happening here with the ten K ens club?
00:42:33.306 - 00:43:04.454, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, this story has just continued, Ryan. There have been 1 million ens names total created, and people are just bidding on all of these four digit ens names. So they're calling it the ten K club. Like, are you in the ten K club? You know how there are usually nft profile picture projects are like 10,000 of them? Well, the bottom 10,000 numbers of ens like one through nine. Nine, like zero ETH, one ETH, two E. All of. I don't actually think single digits or two digits are a viable ens name.
00:43:04.454 - 00:43:16.534, Speaker A: So I think it starts at 100. It might start at up for interpretation. But anyways, there's the 10,000 club, as in the people that have three digit ans names up to four digit ens names.
00:43:16.582 - 00:43:16.842, Speaker B: Wow.
00:43:16.896 - 00:43:31.390, Speaker A: So if you have, like, 1234 ETH, or remember last week, five. Five. Five ETH got sold for 55.5 E. Of course. And so, yeah, if you have the four digit ens names, you're in the ten K club, and we're doing a live stream.
00:43:31.730 - 00:43:58.466, Speaker B: Wait, so the ten K club itself, this is not a dow that's going out and purchasing all of these ens. It's basically a self organized entity that just came together and is like, hey, we have a club now, and we're going to let everyone in it who has from zero to 999 ETH, basically. And you come on in, we'll build a treasury. We'll do some cool dow stuff. But it's not an organization that started in advance. It's kind of more emergent dow.
00:43:58.498 - 00:44:09.290, Speaker A: It's a bottom up dow rather than a top down. Hey, guys. Like, wait, do you guys also own four digit ens names? I own a four digit na. Let's get it into a discord together.
00:44:09.440 - 00:44:11.260, Speaker B: Great. It's really fun, man.
00:44:12.910 - 00:44:19.354, Speaker A: Well, there's the ten K club, but there's also the one K club because there's for the people that only have four or three letter DNS.
00:44:19.402 - 00:44:20.362, Speaker B: Name one K club.
00:44:20.426 - 00:44:22.026, Speaker A: Yeah, one K. One fact for you, David.
00:44:22.058 - 00:44:25.790, Speaker B: You know, turtles. There's only 500 turtles, tiny turtles in existence.
00:44:26.550 - 00:44:28.450, Speaker A: Do not try and equate.
00:44:29.590 - 00:44:34.622, Speaker B: Look, I'm just saying that could be a club, too. Okay. Don't discard the turtles.
00:44:34.686 - 00:44:47.762, Speaker A: Absolutely. Get out of here. In addition to all of the. Think the floor price for a 4K same is something like 1.5 E. Cool. The five digit club.
00:44:47.762 - 00:45:01.318, Speaker A: The 10,000. No, the 100,000 club has 98.5% minted. As in there are only 1.5% of the numbers up to 100,000 that are minted.
00:45:01.494 - 00:45:03.078, Speaker B: So there's still some numbers. They're declined.
00:45:03.094 - 00:45:04.410, Speaker A: There's 1.5% left.
00:45:04.480 - 00:45:04.906, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:05.008 - 00:45:17.614, Speaker A: And as soon as they get minted, you know what happens is the floor price starts to rise because people want to get into, at least if they weren't able to get into the one K club and they weren't able to get into the ten K club. Well, then they can get into the 100,000 club.
00:45:17.742 - 00:45:21.182, Speaker B: Still. There's the million club. There is also no rush.
00:45:21.326 - 00:45:22.740, Speaker A: It keeps on going.
00:45:23.830 - 00:45:29.494, Speaker B: Hilarious. It probably dilutes with each club that you become part of in the ring there.
00:45:29.532 - 00:45:41.842, Speaker A: But speaking before we move on, we are doing a live stream with two members of the ten K club community tonight, as in yesterday for you Friday listeners. And so that is available on the YouTube as well.
00:45:41.916 - 00:45:46.186, Speaker B: And everyone is a Friday listener besides our editors. So that applies to all of you. Yeah.
00:45:46.208 - 00:45:49.500, Speaker A: So for the editors, we're live streaming. But you guys already know that.
00:45:50.270 - 00:46:01.646, Speaker B: Let's talk about this. Starbucks. They're getting the NFT game, man. Corporate NFTs. They're a thing. My favorite Budweiser doing this and such. What's Starbucks doing though? Do they have a unique take or is it kind of same me?
00:46:01.668 - 00:46:22.534, Speaker A: Let me read it to you, Ryan, and you can tell me if this is unique or if this is the same Starbucks expert. We plan to start our first NFT collection, membership and community later this year based on coffee art and storytelling. It will come with a host of unique experiences and benefits worthy of a genesis NFT collection from Starbucks. Okay. Unique or the same thing.
00:46:22.732 - 00:46:33.434, Speaker B: You know what? Starbucks has never done this. I've never seen it done with coffee. We could have a utility NFT for coffee. Who knows? I guess. You know what? It's cool. Look, I don't want to disparage it. It's cool.
00:46:33.434 - 00:46:44.574, Speaker B: Look, Starbucks is getting in the game. I think it starts to feel when you see too many of these experiments that are kind of cookie cutter and they're coming from corporate, it starts to feel a little me too.
00:46:44.692 - 00:46:45.738, Speaker A: Innovation theater.
00:46:45.834 - 00:46:54.798, Speaker B: We're using NFTs too. Watch our stock price go up a little bit like that. So we'll see what they actually do. We should probably suspend judgment until we actually see what Starbucks is trying to pull.
00:46:54.884 - 00:46:56.138, Speaker A: Too late. I already judged.
00:46:56.234 - 00:47:00.498, Speaker B: Well, you did judge, but let's give them another chance is what I'm saying. Remember Budweiser? They're doing it.
00:47:00.504 - 00:47:05.874, Speaker A: Well, Budweiser started from the beginning. Very strong. Yeah, they have never tripped up.
00:47:06.072 - 00:47:14.566, Speaker B: You can hear the NFT hipsters in us that are just like, you better do this right, Starbucks, or we're going to judge you hard. Speaking of not doing things, they already.
00:47:14.588 - 00:47:17.762, Speaker A: Have shitty coffee, so why would we expect any difference in their NFTs?
00:47:17.826 - 00:47:29.706, Speaker B: He's also a coffee hipster. Listen to this guy. Speaking of doing things right. Or maybe not doing it right. Solana, they went down bad like Solana. Okay, down bad. And this is not the first time.
00:47:29.706 - 00:47:30.922, Speaker B: We've talked about it a few other times.
00:47:30.976 - 00:47:32.266, Speaker A: I think the third time, it's like.
00:47:32.288 - 00:47:41.454, Speaker B: The fifth time, I think, so I've lost track. But I think this bears some analysis or some conversation. Why don't you start by telling us what actually happened? Yeah.
00:47:41.492 - 00:48:02.274, Speaker A: There's a Solana status Twitter account which that existence of that Twitter account, I feel like, tells you everything you need to know. Anyways, block production on Salana main net has halted. There's been a quick side quest. There's some debate as whether the halted word is appropriate. Other people have said, just say, call it what it is. It crashed. Validator operators should prepare for a restart in MB.
00:48:02.274 - 00:48:33.262, Speaker A: Validators channel on Discord. So, yeah, that's what happened. When was that? That was on April 30 in the evening time. Salana ended up going down for 7 hours because of bots that were swarming an NFT project called candy machine. So Solana foundation calls it, in effect, a denial of service attack. But again, debate, because people were, these were normal NFT minting bots using the Solana blockchain, more or less as designed. Like, you have those bots on Ethereum, too, but there were too many of them.
00:48:33.262 - 00:48:43.554, Speaker A: And because Solana doesn't restrict its block size and it lets every transaction go through, they just got swarmed with capacity. And so it broke. It crashed. It went down.
00:48:43.752 - 00:48:56.390, Speaker B: That's the first part of the story. So Salana goes down due to NFT bot spam transactions. Right. And so, number one, we should say, l one, blockchains are not supposed to go down. Let's just repeat that.
00:48:56.460 - 00:48:58.262, Speaker A: Number one job, they do not go down.
00:48:58.316 - 00:49:05.046, Speaker B: I understand people talk about, well, it's in beta, but it's like, I don't know how much. Billions of dollars, a $20 billion beta. Beta.
00:49:05.078 - 00:49:11.098, Speaker A: No. As soon as you're $30 or larger, you are not in beta. That's what I have user savings on there.
00:49:11.184 - 00:49:41.842, Speaker B: So you have a layer one. But the other thing is, imagine if this was like a layer one that had all sorts of L2s attached to it and settled on it, right. Then all of those L2s would no longer be functional either. So you can't build on something that is not up all of the time. That's not the only part of the story. And I think even the more alarming part of the story is not only did Solana go down, there's talk of censorship at the validator level, which in my mind is even worse, David, but what are we looking at now with this tweet?
00:49:41.906 - 00:50:16.322, Speaker A: Yeah, in the effort to get the Solana chain back online, they were talking about blocking the contracts that the NFT bots were engaging with. So if they block the contracts, as in the validator say, hey, we don't answer to this contract. Any transaction that is pinging this contract, we will not process, we will not honor. And so they hate. Somebody says in the MB, validators discord in Salana, they say blocking candy machine v one and V two and the magic eating clone should be a last resort. Any other options? Somebody follows up saying, in my opinion, blocking them is perfectly fine for now. I'd rather have a network that is up without NFTs versus a network that is down.
00:50:16.322 - 00:50:40.466, Speaker A: And then ten green check marks in support of that. And then people spelling all in letters, yes, f the bots. But like, Ryan, it's not like I'd rather have a network that is up without NFTs versus a network that is down. It's, I'd rather have a network that is up with censorship versus a network that is down. That is the through line here. And that's the things that I personally do not agree with.
00:50:40.508 - 00:51:01.550, Speaker B: It's also a whole bunch of validators in a discord channel shouldn't have the ability to decide like, this shouldn't even exist. This conversation shouldn't even be possible on a layer one that is censorship resistant. That's what we're saying. This is a tweet from the magic Eden founder. I think maybe coming into discord. What does this say, David?
00:51:02.050 - 00:51:23.110, Speaker A: Well, this is not the magic Eden founder. This is a guy saying that the magic Eden founder is begging Solana validators to not block their contracts. And he goes, please do not block this contract. Please do not block this contract. Right? Because this is this guy's business. He's got a business to run, and it's on Solana. And the Solana validators are like, no, we're going to have to shut down your business because it's clogging the network.
00:51:23.450 - 00:51:54.414, Speaker B: I'm a little bit worried we're a broken record on this, all right? Because I don't want people to get the impression that we're just like, bankless is here and we're just, like, arbitrarily bashing other chains. Okay? The reason we're talking about this is because decentralization is essential. Without decentralization, without censorship, resistance properties. We don't even deserve to be. The whole industry doesn't even deserve to be worth over a billion dollars. It's accomplished nothing. We're databases.
00:51:54.414 - 00:52:32.378, Speaker B: We're open databases. We are not a new social fabric that we can create a money system on, or create a new property rights system on. Effectively everything that the crypto people have been talking about is a bunch of bullshit. Okay? That's why this is important to us. And it's not about Solana in particular. It's about, let's make sure at the base layer of our protocols, we are building decentralization such that corruption can't seep in, such that validators can't censor and block transactions. Because if we're doing that already at this early stage in the game, then we're no better than the system we just left.
00:52:32.378 - 00:52:34.438, Speaker B: You had a take on this too, David? Yeah.
00:52:34.464 - 00:53:06.914, Speaker A: I called this the dual problem of Salana. It goes down because its fees are too low to prevent spam attacks. And the other problem is that the Salana tokenomics are terrible because it's issuing $8.5 million a day in security spend while only generating $53,000 in fees per day. So cross those two things. It can't keep itself online because it doesn't prevent transaction fees because their fees are so low, or it doesn't prevent spam attacks because the fees are too low. But the tokenomics are bad because it's inflating so much and it's not capturing any revenue.
00:53:06.914 - 00:53:35.738, Speaker A: So to me, the simple answer is you raise the fees to prevent the spam, and then as a result of that fee capture, you stop issuing so many soul tokens. This, of course, is like the Ethereum game plan. So the critique here is like, oh, you just want Solana to be like Ethereum. Granted, Solana is being designed to do something that Ethereum is not. It's supposed to be this instant messaging platform across the world. But in my mind, it's just like, that's not how blockchains work. It's just not what's going to be long term sustainable.
00:53:35.738 - 00:53:42.066, Speaker A: So this is my path for Solana to become a network that has good tokenomics, that also doesn't go down.
00:53:42.168 - 00:54:09.370, Speaker B: Look, and I recognize, I think the Solana community knows that they still need to fix things. And so there is the hope out there that they take a path that leads towards more decentralization while they're scaling this. And maybe you kind of agree that the Solana network is in beta and they need to take steps towards this. So I just very hopeful that the Solana community gets things together and they figure this out and they move it forward. But they're not going to be able to do that unless they have some better mechanism design. Here.
00:54:09.520 - 00:54:22.846, Speaker A: The last take I'll say on this is, remember, we are here to have anti nation state level resistance. And so if your network trips over because NFT minting bots killed it, nation state can definitely kill it. It can definitely go down.
00:54:22.948 - 00:54:27.602, Speaker B: Yeah, the fed just has to go in that Discord channel and be like, yeah, stop right now, please.
00:54:27.656 - 00:54:30.110, Speaker A: Yeah, you guys quit your shenanigans.
00:54:30.190 - 00:54:41.074, Speaker B: Yeah, stop chain right now and then deactivates or AML KYC or anything else you'd like. Anyway, moving on. Warren Buffett still doesn't like bitcoin.
00:54:41.122 - 00:54:43.640, Speaker A: David, my shocked face.
00:54:44.650 - 00:54:57.530, Speaker B: Well, let's read some of the quotes he said. So he and Charlie Munger, just this week, Buffett said he wouldn't pay $25 for all the bitcoin in the world. Yes, you would. Buffett don't lie. Why would you not do that?
00:54:57.600 - 00:55:46.314, Speaker A: Right? Yeah, he's virtue signaling, right? He's basically virtue signaling and say, hey, all the other boomer investors of the world, I wouldn't take bitcoin for $25. He goes, in my life, Charlie Munger says, in my life, I try to avoid things that are evil, stupid, and make me look bad in comparison to somewhere else. And he says bitcoin does all three question mark there. But then he follows up in saying the billionaire investor explained that holding bitcoin is stupid because he expects it to be worth $0 in time. Okay, evil because it undermines the integrity and stability of the US financial system. Yeah, status, okay? And also makes the United States look foolish because China's ruling party was smart enough to ban it. See these, in my mind, I call these all personal problems, as in, yeah, those are your problems, bro.
00:55:46.314 - 00:55:50.426, Speaker A: Like, bitcoin is going to add another block every ten minutes regardless of your opinion on it.
00:55:50.528 - 00:56:16.630, Speaker B: It really cracks me up when people like this talk about bitcoin. Say it's stupid and it's going to zero, yet it's also evil and it undermines the US financial system. Like, you got to pick one of those things. If it's stupid and it's going to zero, it's not going to undermine the US financial system, is it? It's just going to go to zero so you don't have to worry about it. So how come you're saying it's stupid and it's also undermining the US financial system? You got to pick one, Charlie. Sorry, you can't be both.
00:56:16.700 - 00:56:17.606, Speaker A: Really good point.
00:56:17.708 - 00:56:33.018, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, moving on, maybe Buffett, Munger. Come on, bankless. Have a good discussion. They're fantastic investors in other areas. So I just don't understand this refusal to dig deep in this space. But let's talk about this.
00:56:33.018 - 00:56:43.662, Speaker B: This is big, David, so pull together. Involved in something. We alluded to this in the intro today. Tell us what's going on with this troll that seems to be suing pool together.
00:56:43.796 - 00:57:24.178, Speaker A: Yeah. Somebody who is connected, intimately connected with Elizabeth Warren's campaign. I think a previous campaign helper person came to pool together. They bought $10 worth of pool together tickets for pull together's no loss lottery, which they call a prize linked savings account, as in, it's a savings account that you get a prize every now and then. And then as soon as they did that, they filed a class action lawsuit against pull together, saying that it operates in a regulatory, legal gray area and that it's actually a lottery, and that is not a legal thing to do. And so this class action lawsuit is suing, pulled together on behalf of every single pool together user that has ever deposited money into pool together.
00:57:24.204 - 00:57:24.938, Speaker B: I'm one of those.
00:57:25.024 - 00:57:52.130, Speaker A: You're one of those? So he is suing pulled together on your behalf, Ryan. And so of the. I believe the $122,000,000 that has collectively been put into pool together, they are suing, doing a class action lawsuit for two x that amount. So they are suing pool together, $244,000,000 to make their users whole. The thing is, pool together is a no loss lottery. No one loses any money. That's the point.
00:57:52.130 - 00:57:59.978, Speaker A: So no one lost anything yet they are suing in a class action lawsuit pulled together for a quarter billion dollars. It's insipid.
00:58:00.014 - 00:58:13.562, Speaker B: Embarrassing, David. They're picking the nicest protocol to do this to. Right? Rather than go look at all of the other. All these DGEn protocols and people who've got shitty paths and maybe have run away with the money. This is freaking pulled together.
00:58:13.616 - 00:58:14.474, Speaker A: It's pulled together.
00:58:14.592 - 00:58:15.354, Speaker B: Never lost anyone.
00:58:15.392 - 00:58:27.134, Speaker A: Inboarding tens of thousands of people from countries all across the globe. If there's any Defi app that has onboarded third world countries and non western countries the most, it's pulled together.
00:58:27.252 - 00:58:57.142, Speaker B: It's a savings account, man. It's a savings account that boosts your savings. Why doesn't this person put $10 in their Wells Fargo account and sued the US government for losing 9% per year on their money? Right. Pulled together is only upside. I don't know why they're picking on the nicest kid in the class to go do this to. Maybe it's because of sort of the lottery type of example. Maybe they feel like they have a stronger legal case.
00:58:57.142 - 00:59:21.790, Speaker B: But, yes, it's very clear to me that they are trying to make a statement to the entire defi industry, and they are trying to use the court systems to troll the court systems into, like, I don't know, some sort of action that would further regulate, further constrain, further destroy the innovation of the defi ecosystem in the US. That's what the intent seems to be.
00:59:21.860 - 00:59:57.894, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think they don't really care about pool together specifically. I think they are seeing pool together as, like, a chink in the armor because of its association to being a lottery, and they're going after pool together. And I think the strategy here is, if they win something in court, they get to go in discovery mode. And so pool together has to turn over all the communications, all the discord messages, and then all those people, it's a dao, so they work for other Daos. And so the communications about, like, uniswap comes out and compound comes out. And so then they get information about those things, and it's like a backdoor attack into the defi ecosystem using a legal exploit.
00:59:57.894 - 01:00:01.854, Speaker A: In the legal world, it's insipid in both accounts, so, absolutely.
01:00:01.972 - 01:00:17.860, Speaker B: F these people, it's not even a lottery, right. In the traditional usage of the word lottery, people put money at risk, and they actually lose money. No one's lost money here. They've only gained money here or not or nothing.
01:00:18.550 - 01:00:20.658, Speaker A: Worst case scenario, you get your money back.
01:00:20.824 - 01:00:58.282, Speaker B: I hope, in some way that the Defi and crypto industry rallies around, pulled together. I don't know if there's a way to do that, but if this is a hill to die on, you pick the wrong protocol, guys. There's examples of shadowy protocols out there with some stuff that some shenanigans going on. Pool together is not one of those. Okay, so I don't know if there's a way to rally the Defi community around this and push back, but we have to win at every level of government, or else people who. I don't know. What is the vendetta against this? Is it coming from the banking industry?
01:00:58.346 - 01:01:21.800, Speaker A: I don't know. Well, I mean, a former technology lead for Elizabeth Warren's 2020 presidential campaign, Mr. Clinical is described in his lawsuit as someone who is gravely concerned at the prospect that cryptocurrency, which consumes voluminous amounts of electricity, could contribute to climate change besides enabling bad actors who circumvent financial sanctions. So pool together.
01:01:22.170 - 01:01:34.122, Speaker B: What? It's just. What? Look at this. Voluminous amounts of electricity contributing to climate change. I put $10 in pool together and now you owe me like $150,000,000.
01:01:34.256 - 01:01:35.050, Speaker A: Insane.
01:01:35.950 - 01:01:41.126, Speaker B: Anyway, enough said there. Hopefully. It's just nothing comes with that. But I know Pool together has spent.
01:01:41.158 - 01:01:51.502, Speaker A: A lot of money fighting these legal fees. So this has been ongoing. This news broke. We actually covered this news months ago. Ryan, like, person put $10 into pool together, now suing them over.
01:01:51.556 - 01:01:52.970, Speaker B: Yeah, we saw the original complaint.
01:01:53.050 - 01:02:02.340, Speaker A: That was like a quarter ago. This has been going on for pool together ever since then. So it's not like this is some brand new thing. They have been fighting this and they're finally just like going public about it.
01:02:02.710 - 01:02:08.210, Speaker B: All right, moving on. Hopefully things get better. We got a lot of work to do in the US. The fate protocol.
01:02:08.630 - 01:02:10.022, Speaker A: Speaking of things not getting better.
01:02:10.076 - 01:02:14.710, Speaker B: Yeah, this is not getting better. Okay, so there was an exploit, rari capital exploit. David, what happened here?
01:02:14.780 - 01:02:47.694, Speaker A: Yeah, there was an $80 million exploit in what's been described as a textbook reentrancy bug. Somebody was able to bug the rari side of the Faye Rari Dow for $80 million. As a result, there is a $10 million bounty on that $80 million on that capital exploit. I don't really know how to read the code, but there was a cool tweet that I saw that illustrated the exploit. But again, these pictures, the person putting out this team says is a textbook reentrancy exploit, whatever that means.
01:02:47.812 - 01:02:54.078, Speaker B: That is the type of exploit that I believe. Is that the one that got the Dow, David? Yeah, it was a parity wallet.
01:02:54.174 - 01:02:59.718, Speaker A: I don't know if re entrancy attacks are like universally the same. It was probably just like the same pattern over and over and over again.
01:02:59.804 - 01:03:17.962, Speaker B: It's a smart contract code. There's a flaw in the actual smart contract code, which is different than an economic attack. Anyway, guys, we got more to cover coming up next. We're going to do this new segment. Dave, it's going to be a lot of fun questions from the nation. These are questions from roll up listeners like you to David and I. We're going to answer those questions.
01:03:17.962 - 01:03:23.034, Speaker B: Of course, we got to get to the takes of the week. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:03:23.152 - 01:04:08.602, Speaker A: Arbitrum is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs. Over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrum, and the DFI and NFT ecosystems are growing rapidly. Some of the coolest and newest NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home. All the while, DFI protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity. Using arbitrum has never been easier, especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitram through all the exchanges, including Binance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com. Once inside, you'll notice arbitram increases Ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee. If you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users, visit Arbitrum IO slash developer to start building your DaP on arbitrum if you're a dgen, many of your favorite dapps on Ethereum are already on arbitrum, with many moving over every day.
01:04:08.602 - 01:04:40.770, Speaker A: Go to bridge arbitrum IO now to start bridging over your ETH and other tokens in order to experience dfi Nfts in the way it was always meant to be. Fast, cheap, secure and friction free. The L2 era is upon us. Ethereum's L2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a L2 life. Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge with across. You don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously.
01:04:40.770 - 01:05:24.990, Speaker A: Across bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from L2 back to Ethereum, a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum, where community members will decide on the token distribution. You can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a co founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of across. If you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely, go to across to bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, arbitram or Boba networks. Makerdao is the OG Defi protocol. The Makerdao produces Dai, the industry's most battle tested and resilient stablecoin using Maker. You don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity. Instead, you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mint dai directly.
01:05:24.990 - 01:05:53.290, Speaker A: With Maker, the power to mint new money is in your hands. The maker protocol is extremely hardened and operated by one of the most experienced dows in existence. They've been here since the beginning they've seen it all. And so you can mint Dai with the assurance that your collateral is safe. Soon, maker will be present on all chains and l two s. So minting Dai can take place on Oasis app, Xerion, Zapper, or any other d five protocol that you use. Follow maker on Twitter at makerdao and learn from the oldest and most resilient dow in existence.
01:05:54.510 - 01:06:19.150, Speaker B: All right, guys, we are back. We're starting with the questions of the week. This is maybe a recurring segment we're going to do and the call to action. Guys, if you have a burning question in your mind after listening to the roll up for Dave and I to answer, go follow at bankless HQ. Once a week, it will ask you what question you have. You can drop your question in the thread and we will pick maybe one of the most liked our favorites to answer. And we got a few questions teed up.
01:06:19.150 - 01:06:20.082, Speaker B: What's the first one, David?
01:06:20.146 - 01:06:22.114, Speaker A: Yeah, first one comes from Michael Wong.
01:06:22.162 - 01:06:22.546, Speaker B: Good. Budy.
01:06:22.578 - 01:06:26.434, Speaker A: Michael Wong actually works at bankless. His question is for you, Brian.
01:06:26.562 - 01:06:41.146, Speaker B: How tall are you? I feel like this is a troll tweet. Okay, because there's some rumors going on. How about you'll find out, David, when we meet in person? I think no one knows this, but I'll give you guys a hint. It's somewhere between four foot six and six foot four.
01:06:41.248 - 01:06:43.520, Speaker A: I think it would be between those numbers.
01:06:45.970 - 01:06:47.038, Speaker B: What else we got?
01:06:47.124 - 01:06:51.018, Speaker A: Well, I think that confirms that you are not a bot, because you at least have legs.
01:06:51.114 - 01:06:53.386, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely have legs. Definitely legs.
01:06:53.418 - 01:07:12.566, Speaker A: All right, next question. I'm a huge fan of the podcast, and both of you, thank you to trucking east for that. I have learned a ton about a crypto in general from bankless. My question is, why do you guys seem to only talk about optimism, arbitram and polygon when discussing L2s? Loop ring seems to be trying to accomplish exactly what you guys are. They don't finish that sentence, but we get the gist. You want to start?
01:07:12.668 - 01:07:33.190, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll start. Loop ring is fantastic. Loop ring is great. We actually talked a lot about loop ring during the early days. I think we're fans. We love all of our children, all of our children being all of the l two solutions that are truly decentralized out there. Big fans of Arbtrum, big fans of Polygon, big fans of optimism, Zksync, Starkware, all of these things, loop ring included.
01:07:33.190 - 01:07:59.066, Speaker B: It's just a matter of time and attention of what we can focus on in a given week. We tend to focus on the ones that are gaining momentum and gaining more traction. So one proxy for this that we like to look at is on L2, beat. You can see total locked value and growth of these L2s over time. And we pick the most legitimate ones and the most high growth ones are the ones that we generally prioritize, but all of them are fantastic. What would you say, David?
01:07:59.118 - 01:08:17.226, Speaker A: All right, I'll play Devil's advocate, Ryan. I think the reason why Loop ring hasn't had the adoption that other L2s have had is just because it's not generalizable. Zk roll up. It does two main features. It's really good at payments and it's really good at swapping tokens. So it's a good currency exchange. Payments roll up.
01:08:17.226 - 01:08:47.326, Speaker A: You can also do NFTs on it, but it doesn't have the generalizability that something like an optimistic roll up has. And so that constrictedness and use cases, I think, is why loop ring has kind of lagged behind the rest of the L2 ecosystem over the last year since we started covering it. But as soon as we see any meaningful adoption, we'll start talking about it. But just like got to go to where the attention is. Got to go to where the news are and news is. And I just don't see that much use cases coming to loopering that frequently.
01:08:47.438 - 01:08:53.960, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Here's the next question. I don't know if this is a troll or what.
01:08:54.410 - 01:08:56.294, Speaker A: Maybe a little both. It's good. You want me to read it?
01:08:56.412 - 01:08:57.398, Speaker B: Yeah, you read it.
01:08:57.484 - 01:09:01.826, Speaker A: Which one will come first? Sharding on ethereum or Ethereum, the movie?
01:09:01.938 - 01:09:15.854, Speaker B: Well, that's a legitimate question. Never mind. I take it back. This is not a troll question. So what do you think will come first? ETH sharding or ETH the movie? And we said ETH the movie was coming. What Cammie told us 2024. Two years from now, we're going to get sharding sometime before 2024.
01:09:15.972 - 01:09:30.820, Speaker A: Yeah, it depends on when in 2024 the movie comes. But both of these things could be delayed in tandem with each other. So this is actually a really tough question. The timing on these things is actually kind of lining up. I do think charting does happen in 2024.
01:09:32.390 - 01:10:03.486, Speaker B: You know what? This is a good question for the dank charting panel that we are doing. Look, that was totally unintentional. There's a panel we are having Vitalik, we're having Tim Baco, we're having some of the other Ethereum researchers. Dank rad, the dank in dank sharding is coming. This is like an earlier attempt to bring sharding to Ethereum, basically in the form of data sharding. And I think we're going to want to talk about timelines, if we can. In that panel, are we talking dank sharding 2023 or 2024? We'll ask that question.
01:10:03.588 - 01:10:10.160, Speaker A: Of course, Tim Baco and the rest of the Ethereum researchers hate having dates pressed upon them, so we'll ask this question instead.
01:10:12.690 - 01:10:22.130, Speaker B: That's a way. Thank you, listener, for giving us this question. It's a much more low key way to ask and not put them on the spot, but still put them on the spot. Yeah, sorry, Tim, I know you're listening.
01:10:25.350 - 01:10:27.590, Speaker A: This is coming from you. You want me to read it to you?
01:10:27.660 - 01:10:28.774, Speaker B: Yeah, read it to me, please.
01:10:28.812 - 01:10:45.290, Speaker A: Ryan. Sean Adams says that L2s are parasitic. He's being facetious here. Layer twos are parasitic to the ethereum economy the same way that New York, California, Texas and Florida are parasitic to the US economy. And then, of course, he follows up with law. No, they're not.
01:10:45.440 - 01:11:23.554, Speaker B: They're really not, David. And this is something we talked about in our episodes earlier in the week, the trillion dollar opportunity in L2, which is this is a map of US states, and they're all renamed in this map to countries with similar GDPs. And so, like, California is renamed UK because California, UK are the same size in terms of economy. Canada, Texas is the size of Canada. Right? All of these states are massively contributing to what? To the United States GDP. All right? They're all secured by the United States federal government. They subscribe to the same security regime.
01:11:23.554 - 01:11:51.662, Speaker B: They subscribe to the same protocol. That is a great analog for L2s. All of the L2s that we've been talking about, loop ring, included optimism, arbitrum, loop ring, starkware, all of these things, if they are settling on the Ethereum network, then they are net accretive to the Ethereum economy. They are part of the Ethereum network, if you will. Some people talking about, like even last weekend they were talking about Ethereum transaction fees are so high. Oh my God. And they are on main net.
01:11:51.662 - 01:12:21.782, Speaker B: But broaden your view of what an Ethereum transaction is. If you're doing an Ethereum transaction, if you're doing a transaction on arbitram or optimism in the future, that is an Ethereum transaction, and that is 95% less in cost, right? The transaction that would have cost you $10 on Ethereum main net, only cost you one dollars, $0.50 on Arbitrum. Right. And so that is all net accretive. I don't understand this idea that L2s are going to be parasitic to ether as an asset. They are absolutely not.
01:12:21.782 - 01:12:27.658, Speaker B: And I think we have the full version of that case. As to why in our episode, in our part one episode we dropped earlier this week.
01:12:27.744 - 01:12:59.750, Speaker A: Yeah. For bankless listeners that are not on Twitter, this was part of the Twitter discourse in the last week, was that I think it was largely coming from the avalanche camp saying that L2 tokens, which is now in the conversation because optimism launched their token. They were saying, well, L2s are just going to suck away all the transaction demand from the layer one. And we're like, yes, that's the point. But the contrast is Avac subnets versus Ethereum L2s. These are competing visions. And the claim out of some of the avalanche camp is like, the L2s will just be parasitic to ethereum.
01:13:00.570 - 01:13:10.220, Speaker B: I definitely don't see it. You guys listen those episodes and do your own due diligence, and you get your take here. David, this was something that tweaked you a little bit.
01:13:11.150 - 01:13:58.874, Speaker A: This one triggered me here. This is a conversation from some non crypto people about how blockchains are completely just like, non useful for computing technologies. So the parent tweet says, every computer scientist should be able to see that cryptocurrencies are totally dysfunctional payment systems and that blockchain technology, including smart contracts, misspelled, is a technological fraud. Will they please go say that out loud? And then somebody follows up saying, Harvard computer science degree here, many decades of practical experience. There is no computing problem for which blockchain is anywhere near the best solution. And before we go to my tweet, I want to go to Santi Siri's tweet, who retweets this and says, tease my tweet. Santi Siri, who I had on layer zero, he goes, college dropout here.
01:13:58.874 - 01:14:07.354, Speaker A: Many decades living under high inflation. Blockchains don't solve computing problems. They solve social, political, and economic problems.
01:14:07.472 - 01:14:09.260, Speaker B: Yes, that's right.
01:14:10.190 - 01:14:23.838, Speaker A: It's not a computation platform. It's a social platform. It's an economic platform. So, like, you know, Mr. Harvard, with your computer science degree, you're not coming in here being an expert, bro. And so this is a tweet I follow.
01:14:24.004 - 01:14:34.114, Speaker B: But maybe he was right, though, David, before you get to your tweet, maybe he's right. There is no computing problem for which the block. That's what he said. Computing problem. It's in the domain of computing problem. Maybe technically right.
01:14:34.232 - 01:14:37.810, Speaker A: He's technically right. But, yeah, he misses the forest for the trees.
01:14:38.630 - 01:14:40.854, Speaker B: What is the forest through the trees? Right.
01:14:40.892 - 01:14:56.454, Speaker A: And so I did the whole capital letters, uncapital letters. I was making a fun of it. I go, Harvard computer science degree here. Decades of XP. I go, no amount of credentialism can help you understand blockchains. You learn about crypto by doing crypto things, not by sitting in an armchair. You know what happened next, Ryan?
01:14:56.582 - 01:14:57.210, Speaker B: What happened?
01:14:57.280 - 01:14:58.138, Speaker A: He blocked me.
01:14:58.224 - 01:15:11.200, Speaker B: Yeah, well, look, man, your tweet was a little. Understand? I think. Look, I think that this is just the ivory tower talking about coming down and saying, I'm an expert. I have these credentials. I understand.
01:15:11.570 - 01:15:12.622, Speaker A: Listen to me.
01:15:12.756 - 01:15:30.600, Speaker B: Yes. And the system that you guys are creating over here is completely invalid and haven't even spent the time to do the deep dive, due diligence to actually come up with a well informed critique. We see this all of the time. So I understand why you tweaked. Do you have something against Harvard, though?
01:15:31.210 - 01:15:58.142, Speaker A: No, it's just like, oh, I've got a Harvard. I've got a Harvard degree. The crypto industry is inherently anti credentialist just because credentialists are, like, incumbent protections, and so regulation, credentialism, it's all just like trying to gatekeep away. And so, especially about blockchains where there is no textbook, there is nothing. And so you can only learn about crypto by doing crypto things. You can't learn about crypto by reading about it.
01:15:58.196 - 01:16:21.554, Speaker B: I just always turn back and I'm like, okay, explain why this industry is worth $2 trillion. Explain why it survived. Every single time that you said it was a Ponzi scheme and it was going to zero, just like Charlie munger. Explain what's happening here. Put them on the defensive. And you don't usually get good answers. You usually get answers like it's rat poison squared or it's a complete scam or it's tulips.
01:16:21.554 - 01:16:31.670, Speaker B: It's a bubble. Love to hear from the great critiquers of crypto. They are few and far between. David, gotta ask you the question. What are you excited about this week, man?
01:16:31.740 - 01:16:49.886, Speaker A: Dude, I'm excited about the layer zero that I did with Carl flourish. I've said it a bunch of times this week, but I'll say it for my last time. Carl Flourish, he was the guy that got me into the Ethereum space to begin with. During just the mania of 2017 when I didn't know anything, I was a crypto novice. All these different blockchains existed. They were spinning up new ones. New tokens were a thing.
01:16:49.886 - 01:17:23.206, Speaker A: I had no idea what was up, what was down, and how to interpret these things. And then I stumbled upon Carl Flourish's cryptoeconomics study website, where he was walking through complex but also basic issues about blockchains and how blockchains work, like, things like nonces and hashes. And he just taught me so much in this. So as a result of that, it's like, oh, whatever that guy is saying, he's saying the right things. Like, this guy gets it. He understands what's going on. So Carl Flores has been a personal hero of mine ever since, and I finally got him on layer zero, Ryan.
01:17:23.206 - 01:18:09.650, Speaker A: And so we talked about, we use the metaphor of, like, if humanity is a decentralized school of fish, how do we steer the School of fish? So that's like the through line of the metaphor throughout the whole entire podcast. And this goes into the question of retroactive public goods funding and the MeV auctions on the optimism, L2. And it makes me super bullish on humanity, Brian, because the public goods funding, we talked about this in the part two of our L2 podcast, which, again, for the 50th time of this podcast, listeners got to go listen to the path towards a Star Trek future. Ryan is actually known. Like, we actually have the steps to getting there. Like, first, we sell blocks on optimism. We send that money towards public goods funding using the retroactive public goods funding mechanism.
01:18:09.650 - 01:18:32.094, Speaker A: We build out public goods on optimism. We scale that out to Ethereum. We scale that out to the whole crypto industry. We scale that out to the whole world. A few question marks, and then all of a sudden, we have a Star Trek future. This path is concrete, and it makes me really optimistic about the future. So if you have not listened to that podcast with Carl flourish, I beg you to go listen to it so you can see the path forward for an optimistic future as well.
01:18:32.212 - 01:18:47.662, Speaker B: Look, it's not just substance that Carl brings. It's also tone. If you can find me a more optimistic human being, a more genuine human being, I've never seen one, Carl. It just exudes this enthusiasm, this optimism, this hope for the future. That's pretty infectious.
01:18:47.806 - 01:18:49.894, Speaker A: All right, Ryan, you're up. What are you excited about?
01:18:50.012 - 01:18:57.654, Speaker B: Look, it just kind of hit me. We booked Mark Andreessen for the podcast. All right? He's coming on the podcast with Chris Dix Andreessen. And he does.
01:18:57.692 - 01:18:59.654, Speaker A: That's the Andreessen in a 16 Z.
01:18:59.692 - 01:19:03.180, Speaker B: For the listeners out there, it's the guy who did the Netscape thing.
01:19:03.550 - 01:19:04.662, Speaker A: It's the Andreessen.
01:19:04.726 - 01:19:39.202, Speaker B: He created the browser, the thing that we're all using to do everything in our life, whether it's mobile or on the Internet. It's like the portal into the Internet. He was there for that. He was there for all of Web one's development, all of web two's development. Now, a 16 z is doing big things in crypto and web3. And I just can't believe that guy's coming to the podcast, dude. He's been on my list of people I've wanted to talk to since forever, way before crypto, but we'd have no chance to bump into each other, rub elbows until now.
01:19:39.202 - 01:19:46.150, Speaker B: And so it just kind of hit me this week, like, holy shit, Mark Andreessen's coming on the podcast. So that's happening. That's what I'm excited about.
01:19:46.220 - 01:20:02.710, Speaker A: Yeah, man, we were just getting, like, the wisdom of our technological elders getting on the podcast lately. He's also coming on with Chris Dixon, who was our most downloaded episode ever. So, you know it's going to be fire anyways. Plus, you get the perspective of Mark Andreessen. Andreessen, yeah. That's pretty cool. That's going to be a hot episode.
01:20:02.790 - 01:20:06.174, Speaker B: Yeah, it's coming soon. End of May. David, meme of the week.
01:20:06.212 - 01:20:06.862, Speaker A: Meme of the week.
01:20:06.916 - 01:20:07.582, Speaker B: Let's show it.
01:20:07.636 - 01:20:09.866, Speaker A: Before we do, how many days until permissionless Ryan?
01:20:09.978 - 01:20:14.718, Speaker B: I don't know. I've lost track of time. About twelve days.
01:20:14.804 - 01:20:15.470, Speaker A: Twelve days?
01:20:15.540 - 01:20:17.458, Speaker B: That's it till the first day of the conference, I think.
01:20:17.464 - 01:20:18.260, Speaker A: That's right.
01:20:19.670 - 01:20:21.166, Speaker B: That is soon. I'm excited.
01:20:21.278 - 01:20:33.990, Speaker A: So here's the meme of the week. We brought on a new memer person in bankless. And so this is one of his memes. There's that cute gif of the two toddlers running from super far away to hug each other, and it's me and Ryan.
01:20:34.410 - 01:20:44.842, Speaker B: That's awesome, man. I can't. Look, it's going to be fun. We're going to meet in person. I don't know where that's going to happen. We haven't arranged it or anything, but it's going to be awesome, dude, to actually meet you in person in my physical human body.
01:20:44.896 - 01:20:47.610, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, that's what they all said.
01:20:47.680 - 01:20:51.802, Speaker B: So here's the weird thing. It's like the artist drew my head backwards and I don't understand why.
01:20:51.936 - 01:20:55.270, Speaker A: Well, yeah, that's because no one knows what the back of your head looked like, dude.
01:20:55.350 - 01:21:00.686, Speaker B: That's what you said on Twitter. But then I showed you what the back of my head looks like. This is exactly what it looks like.
01:21:00.708 - 01:21:06.174, Speaker A: If that's not what it looks like, I'm going to be so disappointed. I've never seen you wear a gold chain before.
01:21:06.372 - 01:21:08.130, Speaker B: No, I put that on for the picture.
01:21:09.190 - 01:21:11.266, Speaker A: It does hit the mullet. Yeah.
01:21:11.288 - 01:21:16.500, Speaker B: This is my office there. If you see that meme of the week. Do we have a second meme of the week?
01:21:17.430 - 01:21:19.394, Speaker A: Just that one, guys.
01:21:19.512 - 01:21:27.874, Speaker B: That's it. This is roll up time. Thanks so much for hanging with us, as always. None of this has been financial advice. It's not haircut advice either. ETH is risky. Bitcoin is risky.
