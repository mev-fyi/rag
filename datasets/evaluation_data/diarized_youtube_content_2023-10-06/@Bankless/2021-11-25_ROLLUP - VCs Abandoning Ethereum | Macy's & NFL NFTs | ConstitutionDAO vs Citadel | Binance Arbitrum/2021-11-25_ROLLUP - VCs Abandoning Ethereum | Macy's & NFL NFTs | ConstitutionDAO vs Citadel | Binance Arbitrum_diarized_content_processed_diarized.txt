00:00:07.050 - 00:00:14.718, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation, this is the fourth week of November. It's Thanksgiving week. If you are in the US listening, David, happy Thanksgiving, man. How you doing?
00:00:14.804 - 00:00:34.166, Speaker B: Oh, happy Thanksgiving to you. I'm doing absolutely fantastic. By the time listeners are listening to this, I will be home in Seattle with my family and my super cute nephew. And if you guys haven't noticed, this weekly roll up coming to you a day early because of Thanksgiving. So happy Thursday. But still get your coffee because we have a bunch to do in this Thursday. Bankless weekly roll up.
00:00:34.268 - 00:00:41.466, Speaker A: That's right. If you're eating some turkey with your family and stuffing, just put on the bankless podcast, get them up to speed on crypto, they'll thank you later. Okay.
00:00:41.568 - 00:00:46.266, Speaker B: Guarantee earbuds in family out. Weekly roll up on. Let's do this.
00:00:46.368 - 00:00:52.282, Speaker A: Well, you know on Thanksgiving you're going to have some Thanksgiving crypto conversations, right? Are you going to have a few? Do you have any extended family?
00:00:52.416 - 00:01:16.402, Speaker B: It's inevitable. It's inevitable, yeah. What do they ask you? I always tell the same story, and a lot of people resonate with this story. My sister hates it that every time she runs into me, some sort of gathering, like, I'm talking about crypto. But here's how this works, right? Family gathering, 20 people, 30 people, maybe there's a party in the backyard, I don't know. And they're like, all right, david, what do you do? And I go, oh, I work in. Well, first off, here's how this goes.
00:01:16.402 - 00:01:35.686, Speaker B: I ask them what they do, and then they give me some normal job, and I'm like, okay, I get it. Marketing. I know what that is. And then they ask me what I do, and I'm like, oh, I work in crypto. And then of course, they have a bajillion questions. And then my sister comes over, hears her little brother talking about crypto. It's like, oh, David's always talking about crypto.
00:01:35.686 - 00:01:40.394, Speaker B: I'm like, they asked me, they asked me. It's not me, but let me ask.
00:01:40.432 - 00:01:48.350, Speaker A: You, I'm going to play your sister's devil's advocate here. Do you ask them what they do in order for them to ask you what you do so that you can tell them about crypto, sir?
00:01:48.420 - 00:01:52.250, Speaker B: Maybe subconsciously, but not intentionally.
00:01:52.410 - 00:02:01.202, Speaker A: When they ask you, are you excited that they've just asked you the question and how do you lead into it? Like, where do you even start? That's where I have such a hard time.
00:02:01.256 - 00:02:01.618, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:01.704 - 00:02:06.974, Speaker A: Let me tell you about the history of money. Do you know the gold standard let's start there.
00:02:07.112 - 00:02:12.600, Speaker B: So what's crypto? It's like, all right, well, in 1973, Nixon went off the gold standard.
00:02:14.250 - 00:02:30.826, Speaker A: Oh, man, too much fun. All right, guys, we've got a jampacked schedule for you. Of course we're going to talk about vcs abandoning Ethereum, at least the fund managers. There was some crypto twitter drama over the weekend. David, I know you saw it. You were part of it. We're going to talk about that too.
00:02:30.826 - 00:02:48.386, Speaker A: Also the constitution. Last week we talked about purchasing the constitution. We were rugged by a fund manager, though. Like the same guy who rugged us on GME. We're going to talk about that too. It didn't happen, unfortunately. Macy's NFT day parade, they're going to put some NFTs as floats, I believe.
00:02:48.386 - 00:03:09.702, Speaker A: Also the NFL going to Polygon. That's an interesting story, too. So lots to uncover even in this short Thanksgiving week. David, before we get into it, man, we got to talk a little bit about Opolis. I love what Opolis is doing because it is empowering the new worker, the self sovereign worker. What is Opolis up to, David? And why are we sharing this?
00:03:09.756 - 00:03:51.702, Speaker B: Yeah, Opelus is a dao for daos. So if you want to work for a Dao, be a self sovereign worker that, you know, manages your own work Life balance and work for a Dao. That's fantastic. A problem with that is what about healthcare? What about things like payroll? What about stability? And Opolis is a DAO to help bring stability for the Dao worker, the self sovereign worker. So Opolis is itself a Dao. It's kind of a co op. And when you join Opolis, you join in a healthcare group, a group of people that all are given health insurance by the same organization and you split the risk, split the Payments, and it's a way to get health care for everyone in the co op.
00:03:51.702 - 00:04:20.266, Speaker B: And just like every other dow being using the Opolis product gives you ownership in the Opelis Dow. So if you sign up today or not today, but also today, but also before the 1 January 2022. So the end of the year, you will get a 1000 work token. That's the Opolis token bonus along with 1000 bank token. That's the bankless dow token. If you join Opolis by January 1, so click on the link in the show notes to get started getting your health insurance through Opolis.
00:04:20.378 - 00:04:43.014, Speaker A: I think that's bankless Cc Opolis. So many people, David, they're like, I'd quit a job today if I had health benefits. Well, now you can get those. And it's not just health. They also can pay in crypto, they provide payroll, they'll help you with taxes. It's a whole gamut. I know this is for our us listeners because we have particular trouble when it comes to healthcare, but maybe they'll be expanding beyond that as well.
00:04:43.014 - 00:04:51.062, Speaker A: Anyway. All right, David, let's talk about the market. What is happening in the market this week? I'm going to flip to our bitcoin chart to tell us more.
00:04:51.196 - 00:05:07.870, Speaker B: A little quiet in the market this week. Bitcoin took a little bit of a tumble. Started the week at around $60,000, is currently clocking in at $56,600 overall, down about 5% on the week. But in terms of grand scheme of things, not really too much action there.
00:05:07.940 - 00:05:14.750, Speaker A: No big deal. Okay, how about EtH price going into Thanksgiving holidays? Are we going to be bragging to our family and friends? I don't know.
00:05:14.820 - 00:05:28.550, Speaker B: Yeah, a little bit flat on the week we started the week at. Where did we start the week at 40,000 ish dollars. Hit a high of $44,000. 4000, I'll take you down 4400.
00:05:28.700 - 00:05:34.390, Speaker A: Yeah, that'd be nice. A year from now, that will be the roll up report.
00:05:34.460 - 00:05:59.198, Speaker B: Yeah. Sometimes I forget to stop looking into the future. $4,232 is where the ether price is. So a little bit up on the week. Ether doing a really good job keeping its head above 4000. It dipped below 4000 for a moment two days ago, but has really fought hard against staying below 4000. There's also a story of the DXY, the dollar index gaining a lot of strength, getting strong.
00:05:59.198 - 00:06:13.186, Speaker B: Yeah. And so the traders are talking about bitcoin, weakness in the face of dollar strength. I have my own takes there, which we will unpack later in the show. But ether had a very strong performance against what is overall a slightly down market this week.
00:06:13.288 - 00:06:17.842, Speaker A: All right, family questions, thanksgiving questions. David, what crypto should I buy? How do you answer that one?
00:06:17.896 - 00:06:19.090, Speaker B: Ether. Yeah.
00:06:19.160 - 00:06:21.750, Speaker A: And is it too late to buy? Sir, look at this.
00:06:21.900 - 00:06:22.454, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:06:22.572 - 00:06:36.554, Speaker A: Okay. A year ago at this time you're having that conversation with your family. It would have been a better time to buy. $737 is the price ether was trading. Well, that was January 1. I wonder if I can. Oh, that's year to date.
00:06:36.554 - 00:06:52.122, Speaker A: Let me do the one year. My God, it's even 500. Yeah, 600, $600, $500. Somewhere in that range. Better time to buy. Still not a bad time to buy if you're holding for the long run, I suppose. Of course, none of this is financial advice, right, David?
00:06:52.186 - 00:06:52.686, Speaker B: Absolutely not.
00:06:52.708 - 00:06:53.770, Speaker A: I'm sure you qualify.
00:06:53.930 - 00:06:55.298, Speaker B: Why would you think that?
00:06:55.464 - 00:06:57.810, Speaker A: Ether bitcoin ratio. What's happening there?
00:06:57.880 - 00:07:34.078, Speaker B: Yeah, up on the week, we ended last week around 0.7, we are at zero 74, hit a peak of almost zero 76, which if you zoom out for like, maybe the six months time horizon. Ryan, we are approaching the end of where Ether BTC ratio has been at its local high in the last year. So it hit the high earlier this year at zero eight ish. And we've been bouncing between zero eight and six for the last six months. And there's not much room left before we establish new highs on local time frames. Yeah, look at that.
00:07:34.078 - 00:07:35.120, Speaker B: Look at that.
00:07:36.690 - 00:07:53.858, Speaker A: We are not having that fourth quarter weakness that ether generally has. Bitcoin. I mean, traditionally in bullish markets, bitcoin has a killer fourth quarter. And then ether kind of languishes, but that's not happening. They're both kind of doing okay. And ether is definitely keeping up. More than keeping up.
00:07:53.858 - 00:07:54.498, Speaker A: How about.
00:07:54.584 - 00:08:07.960, Speaker B: Very little precedent for Ether having any sort of price discovery above this level. So we keep on going higher. We don't really know what happens next. A lot of people are speculating, where is this going to go?
00:08:08.570 - 00:08:27.854, Speaker A: I feel like this number was the exact same last week when we talked. This is total locked value in DFI. This is the DFI pulse. We're above $100 billion, $106,000,000,000. So just kind of hanging there. Seems similar to last week. How about our DFI tokens? DFI index tracks that.
00:08:27.854 - 00:08:29.310, Speaker A: What are we looking at this week?
00:08:29.380 - 00:08:35.700, Speaker B: A little bit down on the week. DPI started the week at $355. Ending the week at $348.
00:08:36.150 - 00:08:49.762, Speaker A: Okay, let's talk a bit more about indexes. This is the bed index. So this is a third bitcoin, a third ether, and a third DPI. All of them put together. What are we looking at on the week?
00:08:49.896 - 00:08:55.350, Speaker B: Also slightly down on the week. Start of the week at 172. Currently clocking in at 165.
00:08:55.500 - 00:09:05.142, Speaker A: That's a good recommendation. Right. So if you're talking to your family and friends, right, a third, a third, a third. Just buy the bed index. Sleep comfy at night. That's what we say here on bankless.
00:09:05.206 - 00:09:13.370, Speaker B: Yeah, they're always looking for something on Coinbase, though. So Coinbase, if you could go ahead and list bed, that'd be fantastic. Otherwise, I'll just start recommending ether.
00:09:13.710 - 00:09:25.502, Speaker A: You know what, though? They're actually what they really want. What I found a lot of people I talked to is like, they don't actually want to know about ether, they want to know about the next ether. It's kind of their question.
00:09:25.636 - 00:09:36.674, Speaker B: It's always the questions. Every time I meet someone and I tell them I'm into crypto, half the time it's like, all right, what's the next token I should buy? I'm like, well, wait a second, have you bought bitcoin or ether? And they're like, no.
00:09:36.712 - 00:09:36.914, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:36.952 - 00:09:41.734, Speaker B: I'm like, why are you asking me about the next token? You haven't even found the starting line.
00:09:41.772 - 00:10:00.138, Speaker A: Yeah, you're not even into your crypto monies yet, right? Like, learn your abcs first before you start spelling me. Wow, man, you and I should have Thanksgiving together sometime. Good conversations. All right, layer two beat. This is good, man. Really very good.
00:10:00.304 - 00:10:01.774, Speaker B: It keeps going up, keeps going.
00:10:01.812 - 00:10:02.014, Speaker A: Okay.
00:10:02.052 - 00:10:03.146, Speaker B: Up only layer two beat.
00:10:03.178 - 00:10:23.410, Speaker A: For people, we sometimes cover this in the market section. This is the amount of value locked inside of Ethereum roll ups and Ethereum layer twos. I should broaden that. Not just roll up, but Ethereum layer twos. We are at 6.5 billion, and it keeps going up. And David, after our conversation with Starquare.
00:10:23.410 - 00:10:44.150, Speaker A: Look, man, we keep saying this. This is the chart to watch in 2022, okay? This is the new d five pulse type of chart that's just going to keep going up and up and up and rocketing up as roll ups and layer two become saturated. And it's already pretty healthy at 6.5 billion.
00:10:44.230 - 00:10:51.498, Speaker B: Yeah. Up 20% on the week. Clocking in at 6.5 billion. Yeah. Some big winners this week. Boba network don't actually know what that is.
00:10:51.498 - 00:11:10.898, Speaker B: Clocking is number two, up 180% in total TVL on the week. So brand new l two. Apparently it's an optimistic roll up. Didn't know about that one. Another big winner this week is loop ring. Up 25% in TVL. Immutable x, up almost 50% in Tvl to $237,000,000.
00:11:10.898 - 00:11:15.554, Speaker B: Diversify, up 23% at $59 million. Some big winners, some big movers this week.
00:11:15.672 - 00:11:18.274, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. We'll continue monitoring this. It's still super early.
00:11:18.312 - 00:11:23.654, Speaker B: Before you move on, check out the ETH number. So we're looking at the dollar number. Let's check out the ETH supply in.
00:11:23.852 - 00:11:24.614, Speaker A: You can do that?
00:11:24.652 - 00:11:30.562, Speaker B: Yeah. All time high. All time high. That's what really matters, too. So if you measure it in ETH, you get the noise.
00:11:30.626 - 00:11:33.302, Speaker A: Is this denominated in ETH or is this just ETH?
00:11:33.366 - 00:11:33.594, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:33.632 - 00:11:38.554, Speaker A: Okay, so this could be stable coins. It could be other value, but it's just denominated in ETH. Is that correct?
00:11:38.592 - 00:11:42.602, Speaker B: Or is this like pure ETh? Yes, you're right. Yes, you're right. Oh, yes, got it. Okay.
00:11:42.656 - 00:11:51.662, Speaker A: We're just changing the denomination here, but this is still cool. A lot of ETH over there, too. Let's talk EIP 15, five nine. I mean, how many months has it been now? Let's see.
00:11:51.716 - 00:11:54.080, Speaker B: August been specifically 105 days.
00:11:54.930 - 00:11:56.774, Speaker A: Thank you, sir. That was very precise.
00:11:56.842 - 00:12:01.586, Speaker B: Actually, that was on the 18th, so it's actually been roughly 112 or 111 days.
00:12:01.688 - 00:12:29.974, Speaker A: Okay, well, how we know that is Christine Kim, who is an analyst at Galaxy. She is looking at Ethereum's fee market upgrade. I love, by the way, that analysts now kind of like Wall street esque. I know that Galaxy is a crypto fund, but they're also like Wall street plugged in. Okay, now, real analysts are looking at EIP 15, five nine, looking at ether as a bond. And what does she have to say to us? David, you want to talk about some of these tweets?
00:12:30.022 - 00:13:04.438, Speaker B: Yeah, she's got some great charts. The first one she says, since activation, EIP 1559 has saved users a total of $844,000,000 through base fee refunds. And so what this means is that if you overpay for your transaction because you just wanted to go in, but EIP 1559 actually returns you the amount that you've overpaid above and beyond base fee. So this is people learning to wrap their heads around from the previous form of transaction types to the new form of transaction types. Actually baking in how much a transaction costs into the protocol saves people money because they don't have to overestimate it.
00:13:04.524 - 00:13:07.590, Speaker A: Stacking these wins win number one for users is saving money.
00:13:07.660 - 00:13:42.354, Speaker B: Yeah. Second one, the average cost of sending a transaction on Ethereum has continued to crime, tripling in dollar terms and doubling in native units since the activation of EIP 1559. This is going in parallel with the increased demand for Ethereum block space. EIP 1559 does not increase gas fees, but it just so happens that it doesn't alleviate them. Yeah, it doesn't alleviate them, but it just so happens that once EIP 1559 was implemented, the NFT markets really took off as well as DFI markets as well. So demand for gas since EIP 1559 has only gone up.
00:13:42.472 - 00:13:45.170, Speaker A: Okay, not a win there, but it's kind of neutral.
00:13:45.590 - 00:13:59.590, Speaker B: It's a win for ether as hard money. Yeah, true. Third one, despite lower earnings from transaction fees, total minor revenue in dollar terms has increased 33%. So miners have actually been making all time highs.
00:14:00.810 - 00:14:03.050, Speaker A: I thought they were going to leave the market, David.
00:14:03.550 - 00:14:11.578, Speaker B: That was the narrative, right? That's what they said. That's what they said. They're going to kill our business. But no. Yeah. All time high, minor revenue, even after EIP 1559.
00:14:11.744 - 00:14:17.770, Speaker A: Okay, God bless the miners. Hope you guys are investing in ether so that you can become stakers. What's this next one, David?
00:14:17.850 - 00:14:35.186, Speaker B: 56 of all new coins issued on Ethereum have been offset, aka burnt, by the amount of ETH burnt through. 56%, right, 56%, yeah. So as a result of EIP 1559, ether issuance has been reduced by 56%. Almost more than half. Crazy.
00:14:35.368 - 00:14:37.346, Speaker A: Is that a happening? Did we just get a happening?
00:14:37.448 - 00:14:38.674, Speaker B: That's a mental happening. Yeah.
00:14:38.712 - 00:14:49.754, Speaker A: Oh, cool. Accidental. That's awesome. And she writes more. There's an entire research paper here that you can go look at. But once again, super cool to see analysts diving into that, seeing this on the charts. Yeah, great data.
00:14:49.754 - 00:15:06.714, Speaker A: Also, David, we just passed a major milestone. All right? Over 1 million ETH has now been burnt since EIP 15. Five nine. This happened Tuesday? I believe so, earlier this week. Huge milestone. A million eth. That's like 1% ish.
00:15:06.714 - 00:15:11.360, Speaker A: Just less than 1% of all ETH supply has now been burnt. What?
00:15:11.810 - 00:15:16.770, Speaker B: 1%, man, crazy percent. But, yeah, pretty close.
00:15:16.840 - 00:15:23.874, Speaker A: We're getting close. Well, we could celebrate again when it actually hits 1%. This is Eric Connor. What's he say?
00:15:23.992 - 00:15:49.926, Speaker B: Ethereum network hash rate all time high. There has never been more hashes produced per second on Ethereum than right now. It's been up and up and up basically since forever. And even with EIP 1559, the Ethereum network security is at all time highs. This definitely has to do with the increasing ETH price, right? As ETH price goes up, there's more minor incentive. And, yeah. So Ethereum also has never been more secure.
00:15:50.038 - 00:16:09.694, Speaker A: Well, I think the lesson there is. Don't believe the FUD. This might be a recurring lesson in this conversation. There are some concerns, of course. I'm not saying everything is always rosy, right? There are some reasons to be bearish. There's some technologies that will take longer. But oftentimes, David, people get trapped by FUD type narratives.
00:16:09.694 - 00:16:34.246, Speaker A: You remember when everyone was saying pre EIP 15, five nine, first it would never come. Then when it was obvious that it would come, that it was too risky, would destroy the network, miners would leave, gas fees, would shoot up. Yeah, user experience would be terrible. None of these things happened. It's just narrative battles. We'll get into a major narrative battle in a second. But here's a pro tip on gas fees.
00:16:34.246 - 00:16:52.334, Speaker A: You want to save on some gas fees this holiday season, then you should plan your transactions not during business hours. All right, don't do this. Monday, Tuesday. Yeah, don't do us. East coast ish pacific time business hours. Do it on Saturdays. Saturdays at like 03:00 a.m.
00:16:52.334 - 00:17:13.926, Speaker A: It looks like. Or Sundays, even better, at like 03:00 a.m. Eastern time. This is a chart that shows average base fees by time of day in the east coast time zone. And when things are more expensive, that's the yellow color. And when things are cheaper, that's purple. And it's kind of showing us when the cheapest time period to get transactions through.
00:17:14.028 - 00:17:36.106, Speaker B: Yeah. Looking like Saturday and Sunday, much quieter. Wednesday is a bad day to make transactions, but also specifically noon at eastern time. Do not send your transactions then midweek, right between midnight and 09:00 a.m. On Mondays. Eastern time is a great time to do it. Same times throughout on Saturday and Sunday.
00:17:36.106 - 00:17:42.958, Speaker B: Anytime after noon till, like, 05:00 p.m. Eastern time on a weekday. Probably should just wait.
00:17:43.124 - 00:17:49.940, Speaker A: This is looking like banker hours. David, are we in trouble here? I thought this was bankless. People doing all their defi banking during.
00:17:50.310 - 00:17:52.386, Speaker B: At work, like being distracted and just.
00:17:52.408 - 00:17:53.726, Speaker A: Like, oh, I could just buy nfts.
00:17:53.758 - 00:17:56.306, Speaker B: Yeah, right. Buy nfts instead of doing my work. That's what's going on.
00:17:56.328 - 00:17:57.666, Speaker A: Well, who knows? That's helpful, though.
00:17:57.688 - 00:17:58.514, Speaker B: It's super cool.
00:17:58.552 - 00:18:26.254, Speaker A: You can see all that, too. Let's talk about Ronin. This is axie infinity. I think it's a bullcase for axie infinity to be of. It's been an incredible year for Axie in general. People are like, what's the next catalyst for them? Well, it's really cool that they're turning their side chain, their ronin side chain, which maybe in the Future becomes a roll up. They're turning that basically into, like, a mini axi banking system.
00:18:26.254 - 00:18:45.730, Speaker A: Now, they just rolled out an economy, right? They just rolled out a decentralized exchange. $1.8 billion moved to the Ronan decentralized exchange over the past two weeks. This thing is still brand new. What else we got? 1.3 billion in total locked value over the last 30 days. 7.5
00:18:45.730 - 00:19:07.754, Speaker A: billion in volume. Just crushing it, man. People trading axes, trading assets, and it's become sort of a banking layer. I bet this is how millions of people will find their ways into defi. This might be for a lot of people, their first banking experience might be ronin sidechain defi using metamask or something. Super cool to see that 100%.
00:19:07.792 - 00:19:12.686, Speaker B: Yeah. No axi proving out to be a sustainable economy. Not a flash in the pan.
00:19:12.868 - 00:19:15.870, Speaker A: Yeah. My God, I think I fell in love with this website.
00:19:15.940 - 00:19:17.850, Speaker B: This is more data. Phenomenal.
00:19:17.930 - 00:19:18.830, Speaker A: What is this?
00:19:18.980 - 00:19:48.818, Speaker B: This is ETHPs info. Ethps info. And it's a great way to visualize the transactions per second of the overall Ethereum ecosystem in real time. In real time? Yeah, in real time. So currently clocking in at 122 transactions per second. And then if you also hit that button, exclude side chains. You can go back and forth between, including true roll ups that have the same assurances of Ethereum versus also having side chains.
00:19:48.818 - 00:20:05.294, Speaker B: So if you want to count just the roll ups, Ethereum is clocking in at 5.28 transactions per second. If you include side chains, it's up to like 122. But this is not the theoretical maximum. This is actually ethereum as being used as a system. Right. The actual transactions that are going through.
00:20:05.294 - 00:20:30.582, Speaker B: So this actually changes. The roll up throughput just jumped up to 16.15 transactions per second. So this must be updating every single block. Really cool visualization. And so as we are watching like l two beat go up in TVL, we're also going to be watching the squares on the right side grow and grow in size for the audio listeners. We're seeing a big, big blob that is Ethereum with some smaller squares on the side.
00:20:30.582 - 00:20:46.470, Speaker B: That's arbitram. Optimism. Zk sync ZK swap immutable x loop ring, all the layer twos. As those things build out, we're going to see those get larger and Ethereum shrink and the transactions per second go up. Right? And yeah, it's really cool visualization.
00:20:46.630 - 00:21:17.902, Speaker A: Here's the big lesson too, David, is that if you want to measure the transactions per second of Ethereum, you can't just take main chain like the ten to 15 transactions per second. Increasingly, you're going to have to take the entire ecosystem that is secured by Ethereum. So that will be mainet plus all of the roll ups, and that will give you the real transactions per second time. That is Ethereum's scalability strategy. So as you said, I expect in the future this purple to be like just a small sliver.
00:21:17.966 - 00:21:18.290, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:21:18.360 - 00:21:20.078, Speaker A: And I'm very, so much more activity.
00:21:20.174 - 00:21:22.134, Speaker B: Just the settlement layer, right?
00:21:22.172 - 00:21:26.518, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really cool website. I bet we'll include this in the future. In the roll up as well.
00:21:26.524 - 00:21:49.354, Speaker B: Before you go on, Ryan, we should talk about the theoretical as arbitram and optimism actually get used more and more and more, and they also open up and unconstrain their layer twos. The theoretical max of these things are insane. Right? Like, right now, people are using arbitrum a little bit, right? Clocking in at 49 transactions per second with a theoretical max of 40,000 /second optimism.
00:21:49.402 - 00:21:51.022, Speaker A: That's the max recorded, right?
00:21:51.076 - 00:22:08.594, Speaker B: The max recorded on arbitrary. Oh, yeah, that's the max recorded. Yeah, it's 49, right, 49, right. Optimism has only clocked in at 2.4 max transactions per second recorded. But again, this is because people are just beginning to use these things immutable, doing 28.3 transactions per second.
00:22:08.594 - 00:22:27.654, Speaker B: We actually need people to actually go on and start to use these things to really rev up how many tps they can actually do. But theoretical max of arbitrum, 40k. Theoretical max of optimism, 20k. Zk swap, ten k. Immutable, x nine k. The theoretical max on these things is like, the ceiling is. There's so much capacity.
00:22:27.654 - 00:22:28.694, Speaker B: There's so much capacity.
00:22:28.742 - 00:22:30.714, Speaker A: We just need more. Hundreds of thousands, right?
00:22:30.752 - 00:22:43.838, Speaker B: And we just need more and more people to actually just be moving their apps, moving their money, moving their value onto these layer twos, which is why we should be probably following this alongside with layer two b on a. Probably a reoccurring basis. I think we should be doing that.
00:22:43.924 - 00:22:47.234, Speaker A: Do you want to make that executive decision now, David? Okay, we're doing that.
00:22:47.272 - 00:22:47.634, Speaker B: It's done.
00:22:47.672 - 00:22:48.114, Speaker A: It's done.
00:22:48.152 - 00:22:49.390, Speaker B: Governance. Governance.
00:22:49.470 - 00:22:51.502, Speaker A: Governance. Vote. Do I have to sign on chain anywhere?
00:22:51.566 - 00:22:52.354, Speaker B: Not at all.
00:22:52.472 - 00:23:12.614, Speaker A: Are we a dao, David? Vote. All right, let's talk about the metaverse, too. And in particular, I want to talk about sand. They just had a crazy token surge. Adidas is teasing a partnership with sand. This is built partially on polygon, I believe partially on Ethereum. I think we should get them on the show at some point.
00:23:12.614 - 00:23:14.710, Speaker A: But what is going on with their token? Dude?
00:23:14.790 - 00:23:16.922, Speaker B: Oh, my God. It's way higher than it was yesterday. My God.
00:23:16.976 - 00:23:17.434, Speaker A: What?
00:23:17.552 - 00:23:51.858, Speaker B: Yeah, so I remember looking at this token doing some due diligence on a bankless show forever ago, and I saw it was like clocking in, buying it, and not buying it. Yeah, I thought it was a dollar. I was like, oh, as is tradition, right? So, like, three weeks ago, I saw it at a dollar, currently clocking in at over $7. Hit an all time high of $7.81. Definitely should have bought that. But the obvious trade after Facebook rebranded to meta, was to buy all the meta verse tokens, sand being one of them. So definitely they're also the organization that Snoop Dogg is helping promo.
00:23:51.858 - 00:23:55.510, Speaker B: So they got him on board, and now apparently also adidas.
00:23:55.930 - 00:24:02.502, Speaker A: These valuations getting frothy, though, sir. I mean, look, we just jumped to $7 billion for this thing, for sand.
00:24:02.566 - 00:24:05.610, Speaker B: I mean, I don't know, Ryan, how valuable is the metaverse?
00:24:08.270 - 00:24:16.800, Speaker A: I did, but this sounds so much like a.com thing to me that I just got to be like, how valuable is the Internet, sir? And that's why you should buy pets.com, right?
00:24:17.170 - 00:24:19.854, Speaker B: Are you going to be. But the.com bubble, while we go through.
00:24:19.892 - 00:24:41.430, Speaker A: The saying, I'm not saying I'm bearish or anything. I'm just saying one difference is, to me, axie infinity, these guys are crushing it on the revenue. I see some of those fundamentals. I don't know much about sand, so maybe I need to do my due diligence. Maybe I should have done that 30 days ago. All right, let's talk about this, too.
00:24:41.500 - 00:24:42.642, Speaker B: Opposite direction.
00:24:42.786 - 00:24:54.922, Speaker A: Yeah. This is a sad chart. So when I see a chart like this, I just think, like, bitconnect, I think scam. I think someone rugged us. But this is not a cryptocurrency. What chart are we looking at here?
00:24:54.976 - 00:25:18.946, Speaker B: We are looking at the turkish lira currency, the currency of Turkey versus the US dollar. So back in February, you could get 13 and a half, almost $0.14 for one turkish lira. And today you can get 7.8 cents for a turkish lira, which, I mean, okay, that's like losing about half of its value in crypto. That's nothing in global fiat currencies. That's a big deal.
00:25:18.946 - 00:25:38.358, Speaker B: Like going from February to where we are at the end of November, losing half of your value. That's a really big deal. So, yeah, we are watching, I'm not going to say hyperinflation, but I'm going to put it into people's brains. We are watching the rapid inflation of the lira currency as it relates to the dollar.
00:25:38.454 - 00:25:45.366, Speaker A: And it's sad because unlike the bitconnects that go to zero, this affects economies.
00:25:45.398 - 00:25:47.274, Speaker B: Tens of thousands of businesses, people's lives.
00:25:47.392 - 00:25:49.178, Speaker A: Millions of people's lives. Right.
00:25:49.344 - 00:25:51.662, Speaker B: Currencies fail, economies shut down.
00:25:51.796 - 00:26:12.958, Speaker A: Yeah. And it causes real economic hardship for people. It causes political instability. It's sad. It's a sad thing to happen. And, yeah, I guess imagine being. Having your funds in the lira and having a savings account of, like, $1,000 right? A year ago and now you didn't.
00:26:12.974 - 00:26:14.370, Speaker B: Do anything like nine months ago.
00:26:14.440 - 00:26:16.466, Speaker A: Yeah, nine months ago. Now you save 500.
00:26:16.488 - 00:26:45.002, Speaker B: Imagine how hard it is for people to save up $1,000 not living in America. And then that $1,000 gets cut like kneecaptive. Now it's $500. Think of all the time that just got deleted. If it takes you a year to save up $1,000 and then now it's $500, you just lost half of a year's worth of labor. Money is a battery of your time and energy. When you go to work, you spend 8 hours a day toiling and then you take your paycheck that is tokenized.
00:26:45.002 - 00:26:57.202, Speaker B: Time and energy when misallocated or just bad monetary policy loses the value of the dollar. These central bank operators are playing with your time and energy that you've saved up.
00:26:57.336 - 00:27:21.434, Speaker A: Stealing from you, stealing from you. Look, it's just sad, right? I feel very blessed on bankless. We get to talk about all the shenanigans going on in crypto. We get to talk about the numbers, we get to talk about nfTs, we get to talk about the fun stuff. But it's important to zoom out and realize why we're here. Right? This is a better financial system for the world. It's not fair.
00:27:21.434 - 00:27:41.040, Speaker A: And it shouldn't be the case that your money, just because of the area you grew up in, your geographic national jurisdiction, that you should have this kind of money system in place and it's the default. Right. That's sad. This is the reason we're in crypto is to create a better money system for the world.
00:27:41.570 - 00:27:46.586, Speaker B: Anyway, I think this is going to be the first of many fiat currencies to pop in this decade.
00:27:46.698 - 00:27:56.770, Speaker A: Yeah, very sad. Guys, we got a lot to be thankful for. We got a lot of news. We got some releases coming up next. Before we get to those, we want to thank the sponsors that made this show possible.
00:27:56.920 - 00:28:38.098, Speaker B: Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and nfTs. And now it's live and has over 100 projects deployed. Gas fees on Ethereum l one suck too many people want to use Ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us. And that's why teams like Arbitrum have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on Ethereum cheap and instant. Arbitrum increases Ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying. When interacting with arbitrum, you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into Ethereum's level of security and decentralization. This is why people are calling this Ethereum's broadband moment, where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security.
00:28:38.098 - 00:29:25.470, Speaker B: If you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better user experience, go to developers offchainlabs.com to get started building on Arbitrum. And if you're a user, keep an eye out for your favorite DFI apps being built on arbitrum many DFI applications on the ethereum l one are migrating over to layer twos like Arbitrum, and some are even skipping over the layer ones entirely and deploying directly on layer two. There's so many apps coming online to Arbitrum, so go to bridge Arbitrum IO now and start bridging over your eth or any of the tokens listed and start having the DfI or NFC experience that you've always wanted. Alchemyx is one of the coolest new DFI apps on the scene. It introduces selfpaying loans, allowing you to spend and save at the same time. Deposit the Dai stablecoin into the Alchemyx vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates.
00:29:25.470 - 00:30:08.574, Speaker B: Borrow up to 50% of the total amount of your deposited die in the form of Al USD stablecoin. Here's the craziest part. The loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated. Unlock your assets potential in the ultimate DFI savings account and brand new to Alchemyx is the Eth vault, where you can deposit Eth into the application. Borrow al eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time. V two is rapidly approaching, which will allow for even more collateral types, plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from. Harness the power of Alchemyx at Alchemyx Fi that's A-L-C-H-E-M-I-X-F-I.
00:30:08.574 - 00:30:16.450, Speaker B: Follow alchemyx on twitter at alchemyx f I and join the discord to keep up to date with Alchemyx V two and to get involved in governance.
00:30:16.790 - 00:30:46.662, Speaker A: Hey guys, we are back with the hot releases of the week. Got to start here. Finance is starting its integration with arbitram one. They have opened layer two Eth deposits to arbitram. I think you can also it's a bridge basically to arbitrum where you can bridge eth back or and forth from binance. So this kind of provides a fiat on ramp. So you put fiat in Binance, convert it to ETH, and then get EtH on the other side into arbitram.
00:30:46.662 - 00:30:54.410, Speaker A: It's the first, I think, big crypto exchange to do something like this, and I expect many others to follow in its place. What are your thoughts?
00:30:54.490 - 00:31:03.434, Speaker B: Yeah, this is huge. This is putting users where they're meant to be users. Right. Users need to use layer twos. Like, use goes on layer twos.
00:31:03.482 - 00:31:05.086, Speaker A: That's what rhymes, that's what they're for.
00:31:05.108 - 00:31:26.966, Speaker B: Slow there, dude. And arbitrum is a great layer, too. Binance now allowing people to take their money and put it directly on arbitrum, where the apps are that the users can use and not having to pay the l one gas fees. This is the future of Ethereum finance leading the charge. A little bit surprising. Coinbase, where are you at? Coinbase? Yeah, Coinbase is done.
00:31:27.148 - 00:31:32.054, Speaker A: Let's do it. Let's get on that. All right, let's talk about defrag. Defrag?
00:31:32.182 - 00:31:32.522, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:32.576 - 00:31:34.858, Speaker A: Instant liquidity for your nfts. What does this mean?
00:31:34.944 - 00:31:50.874, Speaker B: Yeah, collateralized nfts. We know that this product, I mean, I'm guessing, is going to be absolutely used by all the nfters out there being able to collateralize the value of your nfts and get a loan against them. Definitely some degen behavior, but probably a pretty important primitive for Defi.
00:31:51.002 - 00:31:54.414, Speaker A: Would you ever collateralize your crypto punk and buy a car or something?
00:31:54.532 - 00:32:00.274, Speaker B: I'm very worried that a lot of people are going to collateralize their punks and they're going to lose their punks that way.
00:32:00.392 - 00:32:01.934, Speaker A: Get liquidated on a punk.
00:32:01.982 - 00:32:04.114, Speaker B: Get liquidated on a punk. I'd be very worried about that.
00:32:04.152 - 00:32:35.850, Speaker A: Remember the stories of 2018 where people were getting, like, liquidated on their ETH positions and maker that they took out in 2017? Imagine losing a punk that way. Oh, hey, is that you, David? Sorry. Okay, well, it's only a couple of times. You're back, though. You're back stronger than ever. Defrag, interestingly enough, is built by one of the co founders of Zapper as well, noter. So, yeah, interesting projects, not quite available yet, but there's some ways you can get involved.
00:32:35.850 - 00:32:45.642, Speaker A: There's something called a meta mathematician and. Yeah, anyway, this is like a minting story. Go check this out if you're interested in more about that. What is this? Reputation Dao?
00:32:45.706 - 00:33:23.194, Speaker B: Yeah, reputation Dao is a oracle. Reputation product is what they say. So Ryan has said this a number of times. The cool thing about Defi is you can right click view source, which is kind of a metaphor. You can't really right click view source, but you can go to websites like defi pulse or dune analytics and actually look under the hood at what are the assets? What is the balance sheet of all of these defi apps, like compound, makerdao, et cetera. That's the beauty of a transparent open list, permissionless financial system. Reputation Dao is taking the same concept, the ability to vet and audit instantaneously and permissionlessly, not just to defi apps, but to also for oracles.
00:33:23.194 - 00:33:52.882, Speaker B: Oracles are an increasingly important component of the DeFi world. We need to understand the prices of things. And reputation Dao is a way to audit the performance security of oracles. And they have partnered with Tracer Dao, which tracer Dao is a financials products Dao that needs to consume oracles to produce financial products. So the combination of tracer Dao and reputation Dao have produced probably, perhaps a new level of oracle security, making our oracles, and therefore DeFi, more and more secure.
00:33:52.946 - 00:34:31.854, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is really important because not all oracles are created equal. Right. Some have worse security assurances than others. And so you really need the transparency there. You need the abilities, not just what's the price of this asset, but where did the price come from and how is that secured? I expect we'll see many oracle attacks in the future, and we need this kind of transparency if we're going to continue to derisk defi, which is what we're all after. Speaking of derisking things, you want to derisk your cold storage? Actually, it's not cold storage, I guess it's warm storage. But lattice is now integrated with metamask.
00:34:31.854 - 00:35:03.818, Speaker A: Lattice is a hardware Wallet that we've talked about on bankless. Wrote some articles about this earlier in the year on the lattice one hardware wallet. It's a little bit different than a ledger. So it's actually like a device that kind of sits on your desk, has these cards that you can plug into it, and it's incredibly tamper resistant. All right, so if you're ever worried about somebody like, I guess, grabbing your usb stick ledger sort of thing and taking that and getting in lattice, that's.
00:35:03.834 - 00:35:05.054, Speaker B: A possible thing, by the way.
00:35:05.092 - 00:35:08.750, Speaker A: It is a possible thing, man. That's another podcast.
00:35:09.090 - 00:35:10.654, Speaker B: Hardware wallet, that's a possible thing to do.
00:35:10.692 - 00:35:17.394, Speaker A: It's really not possible with the lattice one. This is like the Fort Knox of wallet security anyway.
00:35:17.432 - 00:35:18.930, Speaker B: I call it the greenguts vault.
00:35:19.350 - 00:35:32.086, Speaker A: Greenett's vault. Okay, that's better for your Harry Potter gold. They've integrated with metamask, which is a long time coming, and so now you can use your lattice wallet with metamask quite seamlessly. It's fantastic that this is happening.
00:35:32.188 - 00:35:52.742, Speaker B: Yep, just increasing the potential security of your crypto assets. The cool thing about a latice is that you actually have to be physically around the thing in order to prove a transaction. Kind of like, very much like a ledger. But the idea is like your lattice. It's big enough where you're not taking it with you on an airplane. That thing sits in your home. It goes next to your Amazon Alexa.
00:35:52.742 - 00:36:04.622, Speaker B: Right. And so you can go to your metamask, do something in defi, press the approve button on your metamask, then you got to go over to your lattice, and then press the approve button there. There's a number of other very cool things that can happen.
00:36:04.676 - 00:36:06.350, Speaker A: Human readable transactions.
00:36:07.890 - 00:36:15.886, Speaker B: I think both Ryan and I definitely believe that this is kind of the future of hardware wallets. They just need more and more of these integrations to just become more and more usable. And so this is that story here.
00:36:16.008 - 00:36:36.634, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. They'll all get better over time. Speaking of getting better, Ave, long time coming. Ave arc was like their institutional product. Now here it is. I believe fireblocks has started up by providing services to all of Fireblock's institutional clients in Ave Arc. That's pretty cool to see.
00:36:36.634 - 00:36:38.374, Speaker A: Anything you want to add here, David?
00:36:38.422 - 00:37:15.394, Speaker B: Yeah, I want to add a take. I was on the index co op podcast, and people were asking me about, is this just like taking the old traditional banking system? And now DeFi is just becoming permissioned because you have to do KYC to get into Ave Arc, and now the institutions have their own gated silo where the retailers can't play. Yeah, it's whitelisting. And so my answer to that is like, well, is DeFi just becoming the same system that it already was? And the answer is no. It's actually flipped on its head. The world of DeFi is the more powerful version of what's going on here. Arc by Aave is a constrained version of DeFi.
00:37:15.394 - 00:37:51.794, Speaker B: Everyone in there is a known entity. All the institutions can know who the other institutions are so that they can be compliant. But it's like the DeFi on training wheels. It's like the defi, but protection, the real defi, the wild defi, is the defi with all of the power where you don't need kyc, you don't need. And so all of the cool aspects of DeFi are the things that are able to be used by individuals. It's the constrained part of DeFi that is being given to the institutions because they need to be compliant, which is the inverse of the relationship that we have in traditional finance, where traditional finance is just like, all right, here's your Robin Hood and your bank account kids. There you go.
00:37:51.794 - 00:38:00.626, Speaker B: But all of the cool financial products are behind the scenes that you have to have a bunch of money to get into, like Goldman Sachs. And so this relationship is inverted in Defi.
00:38:00.818 - 00:38:15.014, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a good take. And in general, you can build permission systems on top of permissionless systems. Right. But the inverse isn't true. You can't build permissionless systems on top of permission systems.
00:38:15.062 - 00:38:15.466, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:15.568 - 00:38:27.902, Speaker A: And so this is just a permission system being built on top of the substrate of a permissionless financial system. And that's the correct order of operations because we don't lose the permissionless aspect of it.
00:38:27.956 - 00:38:37.300, Speaker B: Yeah. In the old world, the bankers laugh at the individuals because we can't have access to the cool fund defi products, but in Defi, we laugh at the institutions because we built the damn thing.
00:38:37.750 - 00:38:47.298, Speaker A: That's right. All right, what's this, David? This is. My God. Is this a screenshot of the future? Zapper defi mobile app.
00:38:47.384 - 00:38:53.990, Speaker B: Zapper Zapper. Coming to mobile, getting teased. Yeah, so not an actual release there. Just a little bit of a release of a release.
00:38:54.570 - 00:39:07.174, Speaker A: Very good tease that is coming, guys. The tools are getting better. The user experiences are getting better. It's all happening, David. Let's switch from releases. Talk to some raises. Our friends at Gemini, the Winklebloss twins, they just raised $400 million.
00:39:07.174 - 00:39:29.554, Speaker A: What are they doing? They're building a metaverse out outside of Facebook's Walt garden. I like that because Winkle vosses versus Facebook. Who doesn't love that story? Winkle boss versus Zuck. Doing this in the metaverse. Quite a big raise. There was a rumor that Gemini was going to IPO at some point in time. I don't think this means that that's off the table now.
00:39:29.554 - 00:39:42.918, Speaker A: Their valuation is $7.1 billion, though, according to this next raise. So, yeah, pretty interesting stuff. I know Gemini is just doing all sorts of things beyond its exchange. Any other thoughts here?
00:39:43.004 - 00:39:50.954, Speaker B: Yeah, I just actually learned by reading this article that Gemini, the actual official company name, is called Gemini Space Station. That's pretty cool. What? Yeah, zoom up a little bit.
00:39:50.992 - 00:39:52.380, Speaker A: Has it always been called that?
00:39:53.070 - 00:40:00.960, Speaker B: New York parent company, Gemini Space Station, LLC, valued at $7.1 billion. Yeah. Winklevi, take it back to the Zuck. Let's do this.
00:40:01.410 - 00:40:26.406, Speaker A: Let's do this. Round two. What about this, David? Taking it to the music industry. So this is royal. Now, we had Blau on, Justin Blau, who is dj fantastic artist in and of himself, also an entrepreneur. And he's starting this royal company to bring tokenized music and actually providing royalties. Attaching royalties to that.
00:40:26.406 - 00:40:44.122, Speaker A: This is kind of, I guess, a regulatory difficulty more than a technical difficulty. They just raised $55 million in a series a led by a 16 z to bring the music industry to crypto artists. To crypto. Really cool.
00:40:44.176 - 00:40:59.578, Speaker B: Crypto to the artists. The same. Also the lineup of music investors is also pretty impressive. The chain smokers, kigo, Nas, logic disclosure. Oh, and also coinbase. Yeah. So not only a 16 z, but a fantastic lineup of really good artists.
00:40:59.674 - 00:41:36.410, Speaker A: But just picture how cool markets will get when rather than just having, like, a Spotify style user interface, you can look at the up and coming artists whom you love. You just love their music, and you're like, dude, no brainer. I'm making a bet on this artist specifically and their ability to generate future cash flows. I'm going to hit the buy button, right? We talked about this before, but it turns the music industry into a market, into like, a stock market where you can bet on different artists, and it puts the artists in charge, in control. Right. Because they are the ones actually producing the music. It's not the studios and the go betweens and the middlemen.
00:41:36.410 - 00:41:39.222, Speaker A: Cool model. If this can take off and be successful.
00:41:39.286 - 00:42:15.174, Speaker B: Yeah. And this is just the theme of ethereum at large, right? Producing a financial market around everything to unlock the power of finance for the individual? Maybe there's some people out there. It's like, if you put money behind everything, everything loses its meaning. I think it's the inverse. You actually can create meaning by putting financial markets behind everything, teaching people how to actually be a financial participant, because that education is very much needed in the world. And if you just put, like, stock markets, not for everyone. But what about the music market? If you're a music person, do you want to start to speculate on the music market? Maybe that's for you.
00:42:15.174 - 00:42:24.794, Speaker B: Or we're already doing the art market with nfts, and this is a great educational tool to teach people about personal finances inside of the context that they are interested in.
00:42:24.912 - 00:42:30.170, Speaker A: Do you ever find it somewhat ironic that the way out of the crony capitalist system that we're in is actually.
00:42:30.240 - 00:42:33.914, Speaker B: More capitalist, more capitalism, like hyper capitalism.
00:42:33.962 - 00:43:08.934, Speaker A: But I'm not talking about. So some people hear capitalism and they get just this terrible exploiting workers. And I understand that. Right? But this is individual, self sovereign capitalism. Think of this as the form of capitalism as go into your farmers market, right? We have all of these local businesses, these individuals, coming together, products with their crafts, with their products, pricing this. That's what we're talking about here. We're not talking about big corporate machine suppressing the worker and the everyman and exploiting them.
00:43:08.934 - 00:43:14.522, Speaker A: Okay? That's a system we want to break out of. But the way to break out of it is probably this way.
00:43:14.576 - 00:43:26.894, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. People confuse capitalism with monopolies, right? The lack of existence of financial markets around music is because the music industry has captured it and not allowed it to happen. Right?
00:43:26.932 - 00:43:27.226, Speaker A: Totally.
00:43:27.258 - 00:43:39.790, Speaker B: So this is the birth of a whole entire new field that is fairer capitalism. Right. The best way to fight it's literally fighting fire with fire. Like removing bad capitalism and replacing it with good capitalism.
00:43:39.950 - 00:43:58.614, Speaker A: Yeah. I do think it's really important, the way forward. Crypto payment service, moonpay. They just raised 555,000,000 from Tiger and another firm. So this is another fiat on ramp. David, I don't know if you have anything else to say about this other.
00:43:58.652 - 00:44:09.562, Speaker B: Than $3.4 billion valuation. Yeah. The company was previously bootstrapped and profitable, generating $100 million in revenue so far this year, which is pretty good numbers.
00:44:09.696 - 00:44:17.098, Speaker A: Lovely guys. With these valuations out there, with all these races going on, it's about time you considered a job in crypto.
00:44:17.194 - 00:44:17.840, Speaker B: Nice.
00:44:18.690 - 00:44:19.834, Speaker A: Like that segue.
00:44:19.962 - 00:44:20.350, Speaker B: Perfect.
00:44:20.420 - 00:44:22.830, Speaker A: Seriously, though, get a job in crypto.
00:44:23.170 - 00:44:29.700, Speaker B: Every time you hear about a raise, that could be your money, because that goes to hiring people that could.
00:44:30.070 - 00:44:50.790, Speaker A: They're not keeping it in a bank account. They're not investing in crypto. They're investing it in the growth of their companies, growth of their protocols. What do we got? This week we have a community ecosystem lead at DYDX, the foundation, a foundation based in Switzerland, by the way. Really cool stuff. Bitwise. Asset managers, one of our favorites in the space from an asset management perspective.
00:44:50.790 - 00:45:09.694, Speaker A: They want an NFT specialist. They need a smart contract research analyst, web three analysts, they need a governance specialist. Imagine putting those job positions on your resume. Dex Guru needs ahead of growth. Technical lead at draftly. An accountant at Smartdefi. Product manager at Smartdefi as well.
00:45:09.694 - 00:45:34.518, Speaker A: Get that head of Ethereum research position down with immutable. Head of tokens at Immutable as well. Dexible needs a community manager, a lead engineer at Hats finance community manager at Eagronum. Can you manage a community? You probably do it at Egrronham, CTO at Eagronum as well. Senior backend engineer smart Defi blockchain technical CTO as well at merit. I'm out of breath, dude. There's a ton more.
00:45:34.518 - 00:45:48.938, Speaker A: Just go check out the bankless job boards. Bankless palette, xyzjobs, hit subscribe and you can get these in your inbox as well. And you'll hear about these again next week.
00:45:49.104 - 00:45:49.754, Speaker B: But you will.
00:45:49.792 - 00:46:03.786, Speaker A: Yeah, unless you get a job. And then you can ignore this part. You can just fast forward, David. Let's get to the news though. Got some big news items. Let's start here. This is the tweet that was heard around the world, around crypto Trader.
00:46:03.818 - 00:46:04.110, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:04.180 - 00:46:10.434, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. Maybe I'm overstating things. The abandoning Ethereum tweet. Do you want to read this out?
00:46:10.472 - 00:46:32.406, Speaker B: Yeah. This is from Sue Zhu of three Arrows capital. We've had him on the podcast before. Sue says, yes, I've abandoned Ethereum despite supporting it in the past. Yes, Ethereum has abandoned its users despite supporting them in the past. The idea of sitting around jerking off, watching the burn and concocting purity tests while zero newcomers can afford the chain is gross as you can. This was a very inflammatory tweet.
00:46:32.406 - 00:46:46.686, Speaker B: This was not the start of the drama. This was probably the middle of it. The story actually started earlier than this tweet. This tweet was a reaction to the earlier spats that happened. And we're going to recap all of it later on in this show.
00:46:46.788 - 00:46:52.974, Speaker A: I'm feeling attacked. David, the idea of sitting around jerking off watching the burn, is that what we were doing earlier in the market section of the show?
00:46:53.092 - 00:46:56.238, Speaker B: Yeah, he's talking about us. Talking about us.
00:46:56.324 - 00:47:19.846, Speaker A: That's not all we're doing. Okay? Like, we're talking about Ethereum scalability. We spent a whole bunch of time during this show talking about layer two and increasing transactions per second. A lot more to say about that. One of the things I think the Ethereum community is doing is possibly a reaction. Maybe not. Maybe this wasn't due to the shit like the twitter storms last weekend.
00:47:19.846 - 00:48:15.114, Speaker A: Maybe this was unrelated. Maybe this is related more to gas fees. But there is an EIP proposal to reduce something called the call data function, the gas price for the call data function on Ethereum. And this would require a fork of some kind in the future. But the net of this would be it would make roll ups five times more efficient so five times less expensive in terms of gas fees, roll ups use their bottleneck, their constraint from a gas perspective is this called data function. So the idea here that's being proposed is that in the relatively near future, we're talking the next three to six months, an ethereum network upgrade is pushed out. This could happen prior to the merge and would not necessarily delay the merge, but it might delay it by a week or two, a month.
00:48:15.114 - 00:49:11.722, Speaker A: It's a relatively small upgrade, but it could have a big effect on roll ups. And what's interesting here is the whole idea is that Ethereum is almost like gas fees are taxes, right? And so just like nation state economies, when you want to encourage some sort of behavior and discourage another, use taxes for that, right? You want people to have more kids, you reduce the taxes on kids. If you want people to have fewer kids, maybe you decrease the tax reductions, right? You can control all of these things. And this is Ethereum as a network through their tax policy, maybe saying we want to incent transaction activity on roll ups by what? By reducing taxes, by making roll up activity actually cheaper and increasing scalability that way. That's why I think this is such an interesting proposal. But there are more dynamics to this and there's definitely some controversy back and forth. What are your thoughts on this?
00:49:11.776 - 00:49:42.854, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not an open and shut case. Apparently this also adds a bunch of state bloat to the Ethereum l one, which produces its own problems. There's always trade offs everywhere. It's not like we have this magical thing in the back of our pocket that we can just reduce gas fees on the layer two and have it just be, oh, I forgot about this thing that we had like, no, there's balances here. So this is currently going through discussion, but it is aligned with the whole roll up centric roadmap of Ethereum where we prioritize transactions on l two and deprioritize transaction and transactions on layer one.
00:49:43.052 - 00:50:18.514, Speaker A: This is kind of interesting. And here's what I feel like could be next. I know we're going to talk about this more, but what could be next is what we've seen is the ETH community, the Ethereum community, really push back against this. Ethereum is abandoning its users sentiment coming from sue, and I think this is causing people to actually look deeper into Ethereum. Scalability versus the unsustainability of some of the alternative layer ones and the approaches they're pursuing. I think it's also causing the Ethereum community to take a look at these gas tweaks. Right.
00:50:18.514 - 00:50:51.702, Speaker A: So, like, increasing, reducing roll up fees by five x in the future, what I think this could cause, David, is, like, other layer ones to start bleeding against ETH as well. And what's interesting, I think about 3 hours capital is they're just traders. So if that starts to happen, if there's a momentum shift. Right. If suddenly the avas of the world and the souls of the world start bleeding into ETH, they'll get ahead of that. They'll rotate right back into ETH. And I think what's funny is they'll start claiming credit for all of the above.
00:50:51.702 - 00:50:54.254, Speaker A: Right. We've seen that playing out.
00:50:54.292 - 00:51:15.140, Speaker B: Yeah. Pierre Richard, who was doing the whole Eth supply gate thing, as soon as, like, oh, you can't actually measure the EtH supply. And then a bunch of ETH devs took time out of their day to write a script for measuring the ETH supply, and then Pierre Richard took credit for, like, look, I made Ethereum better by complaining about it on Twitter. Yeah. So this has happened.
00:51:15.510 - 00:51:15.970, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:16.040 - 00:51:16.370, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:16.440 - 00:51:30.602, Speaker A: This is the, know, if you, if you want the technical community to do something, you just start complaining about it or you blast it and you get really loud and they get so angry that they're going to react and try to immediately fix it.
00:51:30.656 - 00:51:36.140, Speaker B: Anyways, we got to package that up for the. So stay tuned for that.
00:51:36.750 - 00:51:40.810, Speaker A: What happened with the constitution Dow, David? This met an interesting end.
00:51:40.880 - 00:52:04.670, Speaker B: Yeah. We have a brand new Internet villain. He was already an Internet villain beforehand because Citadel, the Citadel, CEO of Citadel, is the hedge fund firm that called up Robin Hood and told them to stop trading. This guy, Ken Griffith, I think Kenneth Griffin says he didn't say this. He bought the constitution. So the constitution. Dow raised like $40 million to buy the constitution.
00:52:04.670 - 00:52:19.266, Speaker B: Kenneth Griffith raised $42 million from himself to buy the constitution, and then he bought it. Yeah. So this one hedge fund VC guy bought the constitution instead of 17,000 members inside of a Dow.
00:52:19.378 - 00:52:20.562, Speaker A: Oh, the irony.
00:52:20.626 - 00:52:21.240, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:21.610 - 00:52:25.642, Speaker A: How could this story end this way? Were you watching the Sotheby's auction at all?
00:52:25.696 - 00:52:26.074, Speaker B: I was.
00:52:26.112 - 00:52:26.314, Speaker A: Okay.
00:52:26.352 - 00:52:26.650, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:26.720 - 00:52:50.100, Speaker A: I was watching it in real time, and it was kind of interesting. Like, it was thrilling to say. I've never watched an auction all the way through and then got to 40 million, and it was somebody on one phone, somebody on another. Apparently, it was Ken Griffin's people versus the Dow's people, and they were just bidding up like a million at a time. And suddenly the Dow kind of ran out of its cash reserve. And it's interesting because all of that was transparent. Right.
00:52:50.870 - 00:52:54.862, Speaker B: It feels like Ken was paying attention. He knew exactly how much the Dow.
00:52:54.926 - 00:53:10.860, Speaker A: Had the max bid, right? Yeah. And so you said it. But the end of the day is the people's document. The constitution went from one rich individual to another, rather than the 17, 18,000 people in the Dow, which is quite interesting.
00:53:11.310 - 00:53:15.750, Speaker B: Granted, a Dow has never proven that it's able to take care of historical document.
00:53:15.830 - 00:53:16.074, Speaker A: Right.
00:53:16.112 - 00:53:21.302, Speaker B: So that is also an experiment. This is like a custody of a very important document.
00:53:21.366 - 00:53:23.274, Speaker A: Yeah, they wouldn't want to screw that up.
00:53:23.472 - 00:53:26.622, Speaker B: That's kind of an interesting experiment. I'm not sure if we want to run that right now.
00:53:26.756 - 00:53:54.790, Speaker A: Well, yeah, it was interesting anyway. But I think one of the most interesting byproducts was at Sotheby's. You saw ETH listed with us dollars, pounds, euros, yen, all of the major currencies of the world as a denomination for bidding. And this is Antipro saying eth is money. And this is a picture of Sotheby's auction. All the currencies bidding on this fantastic art piece for $2.5 million.
00:53:54.790 - 00:53:56.550, Speaker A: And you could buy it in Eth.
00:53:57.050 - 00:54:10.358, Speaker B: You know what stands out to me on this one is, like, the denominations of everything. Like us dollar, 2.5 million british pound, 1.8 million Japanese. What's a japanese currency? I don't know. Is it the end?
00:54:10.384 - 00:54:10.526, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:10.548 - 00:54:22.698, Speaker B: Japanese yen, $285,000,000 million yen. Million yen. Excuse me, EtH 619. This is the difference between scarcity and not scarcity.
00:54:22.874 - 00:54:28.306, Speaker A: And it will be like 50 e potentially in a few years.
00:54:28.408 - 00:54:41.960, Speaker B: It's absolutely crazy. You can literally see the money printer here. All these fiat currencies with really, really high numbers have a money printer behind them. Ether, the really, really low number money burner behind it.
00:54:43.370 - 00:54:48.146, Speaker A: Wow, that's hilarious. I've never thought about that. Makes me wonder why you'd ever spend Eth, though.
00:54:48.188 - 00:54:48.490, Speaker B: Right?
00:54:48.560 - 00:54:51.722, Speaker A: Another question about money. David, what's this?
00:54:51.856 - 00:55:22.402, Speaker B: Mihilo of the Polygon team goes on Twitter says, dear uniswap community, we have submitted a proposal to deploy Uniswap V three to Polygon. We firmly believe that this is the right moment for this deployment to happen, for the reason explained in this proposal. Looking forward to your questions and feedback. This has now since gone up to snapshot vote. Ryan, let's take a peek at the snapshot vote and see where that vote stands. Do the uniswap. Uni token holders want uniswap v three on polygon on the yes side, totally against it.
00:55:22.402 - 00:55:42.330, Speaker B: We have 256,000 uni tokens voting yes. On the no side, we have 101. That's it. 99.96% saying yes. We want uniswap V three on Polygon. Unless some massive whale comes in with a really strong opinion about why it should be no.
00:55:42.330 - 00:55:45.850, Speaker B: Looks like Uniswap V three will be deployed to Polygon.
00:55:46.190 - 00:56:03.950, Speaker A: That's funny. It's interesting the community's voted, but why not, right? Isn't this good for uni token holders? Yeah, not surprising the vote went that way. But that's interesting to see. What is Cami up to these days? The infinite machine. It's a book on my bookshelf back there. It's a fantastic book about the birth of Ethereum. It's becoming a movie.
00:56:04.450 - 00:56:19.714, Speaker B: Yeah, look at that. Yeah. Cammy Russo says on Twitter, the infinite machine is becoming a movie. The Ethereum movie will, of course, be produced together with the Ethereum community. NFTs will fund production, enable its audience to become participants. Cammy Russo, congratulations. Turning a book into a movie.
00:56:19.714 - 00:56:20.774, Speaker B: Love it. Love it.
00:56:20.812 - 00:56:30.202, Speaker A: Book into a movie. What's token Mac doing? Okay, this is Zero X Mackie, who's been on the podcast before. He's formerly one of the chefs behind.
00:56:30.336 - 00:56:36.186, Speaker B: Sushi, took up the reins as the first guy. Who's the guy?
00:56:36.208 - 00:56:37.526, Speaker A: That rugged chef nomi.
00:56:37.638 - 00:57:11.474, Speaker B: Chef Nomi, yeah, he rugged the original sushi product. In defi summer, Zero X Mackie took up the reins, became a very beloved community member, very important developer behind the sushi product. About a month ago, stepped away from a lead dev role at Sushiswap, and now got picked up as Tokamax new chief strategy advisor. Tokamaki. Apparently his new name will be our emissary to the greater Defi, facilitating Dao governance proposals, integrations and expansions. Congratulations, tokamak. Very awesome acquisition of talent.
00:57:11.474 - 00:57:20.434, Speaker B: Congratulations, Mackie, for moving on to new horizons. If you want to learn what Tokamac is, we have a fantastic meet the nation with them on the bankless YouTube.
00:57:20.562 - 00:57:36.858, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Mackie becomes tokamaki. I love that transition. Let's talk NFT stuff, David. This is the first one. The NFL is experimenting with NFTs in a partnership with Ticketmaster, and they're deploying this on crazy.
00:57:37.024 - 00:57:37.546, Speaker B: Crazy.
00:57:37.648 - 00:57:38.458, Speaker A: Really crazy.
00:57:38.624 - 00:57:40.014, Speaker B: What a world. What a world.
00:57:40.132 - 00:58:07.410, Speaker A: It's just an experiment at this point in time, but that's how these things start. It's just experiments, right? And Polygon is a great place to test it. If you're going to test something, you want to test it on a side chain of some sort. Right. Where transaction fees are low, where there's no high gas barriers to entry. Fantastic place to test things. You know, this is not going to be the end of things because the NBA has a fantastic strategy for NFTs partnership with Coinbase.
00:58:07.410 - 00:58:28.446, Speaker A: They've also done some things, obviously with flow, NBA top shots. Right. And the NFL's got to be like, we have all of these fans. Again, it's the same question. It's like they're already buying Disney boardroom. We have all of these fans, they're already buying stuff. Why don't we get them to buy digital stuff? That's as simple as the conversation is.
00:58:28.446 - 00:58:33.518, Speaker A: And so that's what they're doing. They're starting with Polygon on that. It's pretty big news, I think the.
00:58:33.524 - 00:58:42.450, Speaker B: Sub caption is the league is exploring NFT ticketing to the launch of its virtual commemorative ticket collection on the Polygon blockchain. TBD on what that actually means.
00:58:42.600 - 00:58:49.494, Speaker A: Yeah. First of many, though. First of many experiments, including Time man, they are all in on crypto, it seems. What's this?
00:58:49.612 - 00:59:16.986, Speaker B: Time studios? Time magazine, the Emmy award winning tv studio, is partnering with Pablo Stanley, I'm not sure who that is. To create an original series based on robots. So there is a robot profile picture NFT project that's being spun up by time to develop animated children's series based on the Robotos animation. So these are nfts of a children's tv show that's about robots. And there's going to be over 10,000 nfts. Yeah. Spun up by Time magazine.
00:59:17.018 - 00:59:18.270, Speaker A: Sell some nfts to the kids.
00:59:18.340 - 00:59:18.574, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:59:18.612 - 00:59:24.974, Speaker A: Hey, you know what? It's so funny how Times Square has basically become the place to play.
00:59:25.172 - 00:59:31.530, Speaker B: Yeah. Advertisement. Get the coke advertisements out of there and the NFT advertisements in there.
00:59:31.540 - 00:59:34.798, Speaker A: Why do people do this? Is it just like legitimacy? It's just like fun legitimacy.
00:59:34.814 - 00:59:36.210, Speaker B: Yeah. It's a big flex.
00:59:36.790 - 00:59:38.434, Speaker A: I want to go to Times Square and see this.
00:59:38.472 - 00:59:40.550, Speaker B: Yeah. You want to put your turtle on Times Square, Ryan?
00:59:41.130 - 00:59:42.182, Speaker A: How much would that cost me?
00:59:42.236 - 00:59:45.814, Speaker B: A lot more than your turtle. Yeah. But let me tell you, it's net.
00:59:45.852 - 00:59:52.390, Speaker A: Accretive to the turtle community, so maybe I'm willing to fund that public good. More people need to know about turtles.
00:59:52.550 - 00:59:54.346, Speaker B: If you put the turtle on Times Square.
00:59:54.448 - 01:00:00.380, Speaker A: No, that's not me. Maybe we'll put a big logo of bankless on Times Square one day.
01:00:00.910 - 01:00:02.974, Speaker B: Yes, let's do that. Yeah.
01:00:03.092 - 01:00:17.362, Speaker A: Macy's launches a parade inspired NFT collection for charity. So Macy's day floats coming out tomorrow, I'll watch the Macy's day parade sometimes in the mornings. They're doing nfts now as floats. What's going on?
01:00:17.416 - 01:00:47.594, Speaker B: Macy's will launch nfts in two phases. First, it's holding an auction for a set of ten unique collectibles based on parade balloons throughout the decades. The auction for these begin at midnight eastern time, November 19, will run through the 30th, and then around 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on November 25. That is tomorrow. Today for you, the listener, during the Macy's day thanksgiving parade, people will be able to claim one of 9500 free nfts and also enter a sweepstakes to win $10,000 nfts being mainstreamed. This is the story.
01:00:47.594 - 01:00:48.634, Speaker B: That's the story here.
01:00:48.752 - 01:01:13.022, Speaker A: It's so funny. The reason we included this story is because it's mainstream in a way that DFI could never be mainstream. It's back to our example last week of Jimmy Fallon board apes, right? Getting people on Jimmy Fallon is far more interesting than, God bless them, Kane Warwick, for instance, or like Stannie from Aave, okay? Because this is like pop culture stuff. It's just invading. It's the trojan horse into mainstream.
01:01:13.086 - 01:01:41.366, Speaker B: Macy says the nfTs, which are ERC 721 tokens, are carbon neutral, is working with the NFT platform suite, which is built on the polygon blockchain. So two things here, built on polygon. Love it. Also, again, mainstream media focusing on the carbon neutrality of these things, which runs you like, they kind of need to pay attention to that because that's a big narrative for all the obvious reasons. So let it be known, the greater world cares about carbon neutrality.
01:01:41.558 - 01:02:18.130, Speaker A: Don't tell them that polygon is also economically settled by ethereum burns gas, which is right now proof of work backed. Don't tell him that. Well, one day, one day we'll be changing that soon. But bitcoin has no plans to change from proof of work, that's for sure. Let's talk about some bitcoin news. El Salvador is planning its first bitcoin city backed by bitcoin bonds. Apparently, the bitcoin city is going to be located close to a volcano so that the geothermal activity can create energy to fund bitcoin mining facilities.
01:02:18.130 - 01:02:22.186, Speaker A: What is happening in El Salvador? They're going all in, aren't they?
01:02:22.288 - 01:02:41.040, Speaker B: Yeah, they kind of feel like the Michael Saylor, but like a country. So, yeah, they are issuing bonds. Bonds. I actually don't know the dollar cost average. They're issuing like $6 billion worth of bonds in order to foster this city. That's around the bitcoin mining volcano. So, yeah, really just doubling down on the whole bitcoin branding thing.
01:02:42.130 - 01:02:43.978, Speaker A: It's kind of strange, isn't it? It's a lake.
01:02:43.994 - 01:02:44.198, Speaker B: Strange.
01:02:44.234 - 01:02:47.170, Speaker A: Bitcoin volcano city bonds.
01:02:47.590 - 01:02:50.690, Speaker B: El Salvador, a dictator leader.
01:02:51.670 - 01:03:10.886, Speaker A: It's a bit strange, but bitcoiner is very excited about this. Maybe this is. The IMF is not excited about it. The IMF is warning El Salvador of bitcoin related risks in this new statement. The IMF is, of course, International Monetary Fund. This is a collection of bankers. These are the global banker elites.
01:03:10.886 - 01:03:42.980, Speaker A: And what do they say? Given bitcoin's high price volatility, its use as a legal tender entails significant risk to consumer protection, financial integrity and financial stability. You can just picture a banker kind of waving their finger at El Salvador. Its use also gives rise to financial contingent liabilities. That sounds like a threat. Because of these risks, bitcoin should not be used as legal tender. Stamp your feet. You know what? The IMF doesn't realize that the IMF doesn't get to decide what money is.
01:03:42.980 - 01:03:48.262, Speaker A: They still think that they do. And that, to me, is interesting, right?
01:03:48.316 - 01:03:54.034, Speaker B: Using the whole volatility FUD to just undermine the legitimacy of bitcoin.
01:03:54.162 - 01:04:12.134, Speaker A: Trying to strong arm el Salvador into not using bitcoin, which is interesting. Using volatility FUD. And this is just the start, right? If you see more countries start to adopt, put cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets, man, what's the IMF going to do?
01:04:12.192 - 01:04:21.470, Speaker B: Right? I can just see the archetype of El Salvador just responding to the IMF. You know what I'm going to do now? I'm going to use bitcoin even harder.
01:04:23.250 - 01:04:36.702, Speaker A: It's a little bit like that. I just get a crack out of these legacy institutions thinking they get to decide what money is. The people do. This is what Chris John Carlos said. Money is a social contract. It's a bottom up phenomenon. It's not a top down phenomenon.
01:04:36.702 - 01:04:42.806, Speaker A: If you think it is, I guess you're going to go inflate your currency way. It's like it's not going to work out well for you.
01:04:42.908 - 01:04:50.602, Speaker B: The IMF used my favorite euphemism, consumer protection. They kind of really mean incumbent protection. That's what the IMF does.
01:04:50.736 - 01:04:56.922, Speaker A: I mean, they should be worried about fiat. They should be worried about turkish lira blowing up.
01:04:56.976 - 01:04:57.194, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:57.232 - 01:05:26.174, Speaker A: Whoops. Yeah. This is interesting. This is ten epic bitcoin mining photos from Anthony Papliano's newsletter. And we just included this because it's such an interesting, I think, contrast, right? I feel like lately David bitcoin is almost bifurcated from the rest of crypto. Right? It's like the rest of crypto having these battles between Ethereum and alternative layer ones over scalability and talking about DFI, talking about nfts. It's like a different world.
01:05:26.174 - 01:05:35.890, Speaker A: And over here is like bitcoin, and they're talking about volcano cities and El Salvador. And here's a picture of like ten epic bitcoin mining photos.
01:05:35.970 - 01:05:40.406, Speaker B: They are epic. They are very epic, I guess, I.
01:05:40.428 - 01:05:42.134, Speaker A: Don'T know, factories, epic.
01:05:42.182 - 01:05:43.642, Speaker B: These things, they're big.
01:05:43.776 - 01:06:00.042, Speaker A: They're gigantic. But when I see these pictures personally, my reaction is like, are these necessary when we have proof of stake? This looks like waste to it's.
01:06:00.106 - 01:06:27.538, Speaker B: Yeah, I think bitcoiners, they see these facilities all over the world. Like, big facility in China, big facility in Norway, big facility in Montana, and they see decentralization. Right? They see hardcore investment into bitcoin, into energy production all over the world, and they see decentralization. Can I show you my equivalent to a bitcoin mining farm, but for proof of sake?
01:06:27.634 - 01:06:28.594, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you have a picture?
01:06:28.642 - 01:06:29.046, Speaker B: Here it is.
01:06:29.068 - 01:06:30.140, Speaker A: What are you going to show me?
01:06:31.310 - 01:06:37.862, Speaker B: This is my equivalent for the juxtaposition, go down to one of the big mining operations.
01:06:38.006 - 01:06:40.010, Speaker A: This is my favorite one because this looks like.
01:06:40.080 - 01:06:45.870, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, here's my equivalent for proof of stake. It's right here in my hands. I'm holding it up.
01:06:45.940 - 01:06:46.762, Speaker A: That's your capital.
01:06:46.826 - 01:06:48.400, Speaker B: It's got a battery. Yeah.
01:06:49.570 - 01:06:51.998, Speaker A: That's your validator. That's your mining equipment, basically for the.
01:06:52.004 - 01:06:54.050, Speaker B: Listener holding up my loaded book air.
01:06:54.200 - 01:07:07.010, Speaker A: Yeah, well, okay, so we're staking right now on rocket pool from a raspberry PI that's running eth nodes in a validator like bankless is doing that, right?
01:07:07.080 - 01:07:25.180, Speaker B: Yeah. So the two versions of the future are ahead of us. One is these big, and maybe they can coexist over the long term. I don't really think so. But one is these big, big mining farms all over the world connected to some sort of energy source. Bitcoiners will say the mining incentivizes the energy production. And that's cool.
01:07:25.180 - 01:07:58.066, Speaker B: These big, big facilities versus the proof of stake, which is everyone's got their home laptop staking on Ethereum. It's using the idle resources of your computer in the background, and it's everywhere, all over the world. The tokens don't actually exist anywhere, unlike the bitcoin mining units, the asiCs. And so if this computer, if I drop this computer and it breaks, I can just move the tokens to a different computer. It doesn't actually exist physically in the world. What version seems more futuristic to you? They both seem very futuristic, but they also look like very different futures.
01:07:58.178 - 01:08:21.222, Speaker A: They do. Right. These ASICs that we're looking at, data centers full of these AsiCs, these specialized mining computers, basically, ether is just a virtual ASIC. It's just a virtualized version of an ASIC when you stake it. Yeah. And I'm just struck lately, David, by the bifurcation kind of narratives. Crypto is kind of split into two pieces.
01:08:21.222 - 01:08:39.460, Speaker A: Two cultures, two cultures. Tale of two cultures here. This is interesting, too. I feel like every week another athlete is deciding to take their salary in bitcoin. So this is Odell Beckham, Jr. From the Rams taking his salary in bitcoin. Yeah, I guess we'll see more of that, too.
01:08:39.460 - 01:09:07.530, Speaker A: That's what was going on in bitcoin felt a little different than what's going on the rest of the crypto space, particularly this week. But what's going on the regulatory front is Citigroup is appointing a new head of digital assets. It's eyeing 100 new hires as well on digital assets. So the banks coming to the table, as we knew they would, a little bit late, but realizing they have to get on this crypto thing before it eats their lunch. Any thoughts here?
01:09:07.600 - 01:09:11.702, Speaker B: Yeah. Where are they going to find 100 really good crypto hires?
01:09:11.766 - 01:09:17.040, Speaker A: Oh, they don't have to be really good, sir. They could just be not very good.
01:09:17.410 - 01:09:42.034, Speaker B: Well, that's kind of what I'm saying. Right. If you want to have good crypto products, you need to hire crypto native people. Otherwise, how can you advise on where the product should be built? Where are they going to find 100 qualified crypto people? Look at our jobs board. Those are the coolest crypto jobs of all time. People are going to go there first before they go to Citigroup, like, oh, I'm super passionate about crypto. I want to help build out the world of crypto.
01:09:42.034 - 01:09:42.966, Speaker B: Where should I go?
01:09:43.068 - 01:09:53.514, Speaker A: Citigroup. I don't think these positions are going to attract the crypto natives. Right. I think these positions are going to track the corporate people who are interested in kind of the next big thing.
01:09:53.552 - 01:10:02.622, Speaker B: Right. But the products that are going to be determined by the people that they hire. Right. So if they don't hire crypto natives, then the products that come out as a result of these things are going to be different.
01:10:02.756 - 01:10:14.030, Speaker A: I am so skeptical that crypto banks are going to be able to actually develop any interesting crypto products. One exception so far, this exception to the rule has been fidelity in my mind.
01:10:14.100 - 01:10:14.762, Speaker B: Correct? Yeah.
01:10:14.836 - 01:10:33.670, Speaker A: Which is like they're crushing it. But they started as crypto native believers like six years ago, right? Yeah, we'll see what happens, but they're definitely coming to the table. I expect we'll see a lot of acquisitions personally. So I think these banks will acquire crypto companies as their way forward. Tether Fud.
01:10:34.250 - 01:11:04.634, Speaker B: Tether FUD. Yeah, things are heating up for Tether. The US Senate sent a letter requesting immediate information about their backings, redemption process and activities. Due to several market integrity concerns, Tether has been given ten days to respond. Tether has been probed like this before and has come out on the other side of these things, like completely clean. But I feel like this is just going to keep on happening until the end of time. That said it, this is coming from that committee on banking, Housing and urban affairs, the same committee that did that whole like, cryptocurrencies.
01:11:04.634 - 01:11:06.240, Speaker B: What are they even good for?
01:11:06.610 - 01:11:23.506, Speaker A: This is probably one of their action items, right? Yeah, it's like we got to investigate that thing another, another week, more tether fud. It's held up. The thing about Tether, though, is you don't know what's behind it. Right. Because you can't view source, you can't like open source code. It's not Defi. So I understand the concerns.
01:11:23.506 - 01:11:41.018, Speaker A: I just like, not a big deal in my mind. What's Biden doing? Okay. Oh, this is, I guess maybe a quick drive by is. Powell is named as the Fed chair again, so reappointed as the Fed chair. So I think the existing policy is going to continue into the future.
01:11:41.184 - 01:11:52.218, Speaker B: I think the general gist that I've gotten about this news is that people are just going, the Fed is going to likely continue to be warm towards money printing. I think that's the gist I've gotten.
01:11:52.314 - 01:11:55.902, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. It doesn't look like a restrictive policy. What's this, David?
01:11:56.046 - 01:12:33.642, Speaker B: Somebody is suing pool together because the pool together branded as a no loss lottery. Well, the guy lost money because of gas fees. So this guy is suing pool together because he didn't get his money back because of gas fees. And so he sent in $25 of USDC, received 25 tickets of USDC and pulled together, and then had a gas payment of $161. Therefore, the person is effectively paying $186 for $25 in pull together lottery tickets and is now suing pull together for being a no loss lottery but having to pay the gas fees. It's completely nonsensical.
01:12:33.706 - 01:12:45.470, Speaker A: But isn't this only worth whatever he paid? Even the best case he wins, he gets $200 back. This is like small claims court stuff. This is weird. We need like Judge Judy for crypto.
01:12:45.550 - 01:12:48.020, Speaker B: Who would, by the way, conspiracies about this.
01:12:48.630 - 01:12:49.742, Speaker A: What's your conspiracy?
01:12:49.806 - 01:12:56.162, Speaker B: Oh, it's a great news story to advertise how high gas fees on Ethereum are.
01:12:56.296 - 01:13:15.482, Speaker A: Here's another one. I don't know if you saw this. It's kind of buried in the thread here. This is from the actual notice here. He is gravely concerned that the cryptocurrency ecosystem, which requires the use of enormous amounts of electricity, is accelerating climate change and allowing people to evade financial regulations and scam customers.
01:13:15.616 - 01:13:17.610, Speaker B: God, what a fucking asshole.
01:13:19.230 - 01:13:41.454, Speaker A: But another conspiracy theory would be this entire thing was just built to actually say that last sentence there, which is like, cryptocurrency is bad, destroying the climate, allowing people to evade financial regulations and scam consumers. That might be the reason for this case, not the $200 or $25 Eric Connor he lost.
01:13:41.502 - 01:13:47.346, Speaker B: Eric Connor follows up this thread saying he should sue the CEO of Ethereum. He should do that. He should do that.
01:13:47.448 - 01:14:01.050, Speaker A: Last thing for news, David finance smart chain validators are threatening to dump the chain and move on. I don't know if you've read this thread on GitHub, but it is an absolute shit show, dude. Yeah, it's pretty bad. They are upset. What's happening?
01:14:01.120 - 01:14:30.494, Speaker B: Yeah, somebody who is apparently a BSE validators goes in the GitHub for binance smart chain says, guys, seriously, WTF? This is a blockchain with supposedly billions of value, yet it is governed and developed like the project of a stoned teenager. I've rarely seen some things handled so unprofessionally. There is no code review. Patches are simply committed. In most cases, even without a proper description of what they do or what problem they're trying to solve, there doesn't appear to be any reasonable testing in place. Every update seems to make things worse. There's zero responding to bug reports.
01:14:30.494 - 01:14:48.934, Speaker B: Hundreds of people report non syncing nodes, or nodes falling out of sync response from the developer. Zero. There's a list of other complaints. Apparently binance smart chain is not treating their smart chain as the billion dollar network that it is, and apparently the validators are very upset about it.
01:14:49.052 - 01:14:57.290, Speaker A: Well, fork of death. And then they're just like increasing block limits until the thing falls over, right? I've heard this story before falling over. Yeah, absolutely.
01:14:57.360 - 01:14:58.938, Speaker B: We got more a few times.
01:14:59.024 - 01:15:15.234, Speaker A: We got more to say and we're going to come back with the takes. And I think we're going to start with this Twitter drama again, this abandoning ethereum thread. We've got to pick back up on that, give our thoughts, give some takes around the Twitter sphere as well. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:15:15.352 - 01:15:58.862, Speaker B: Matcha, everyone's favorite Dex aggregator, has just launched an open beta for gasless trading. So if you're trading more than $5,000 in common eth and wrapped bitcoin pairs, then your gas fees on Matcha are free. And that's why you should be using matcha. Matcha routes your orders across all the various defi exchanges on Ethereum polygon, Binance, smart chain and gives you the best possible price without any trading fees or unnecessary slippage. Matcha has smart order routing that splits your orders across multiple liquidity sources. If matcha sees that it gets you better pricing. Trading on Matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me into a single and easy to use platform and has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and getting a bad price.
01:15:58.862 - 01:16:36.618, Speaker B: Matcha also allows you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defi trades and they will go through automatically while you're away. So when you're making a trade, head over to Matcha XYZ slash bankless, connect your wallet and start getting some of the best prices and most liquidity. When you trade your crypto assets, living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys. Not your keys, not your crypto. That's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet, which makes proper private key management a breeze. But the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet. Ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the Ledger Live app.
01:16:36.618 - 01:17:14.534, Speaker B: And if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite defi apps all in one spot, ledger live is where you want to be. Not only does ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app, but it also hooks into all of the defi apps and services that you're used to using Ledger live. You can stake your Ethan Lido, swap on dexes like Paraswap, or display your nfts with rainbow. You can also use wallet Connect inside of Ledger Live to connect to all the other defi apps that keep coming online. Defi never stops growing, and the Ledger live app grows alongside with it. So click the link in the show notes to see all of the defi apps that Ledger Live has. And stay tuned as more apps come online.
01:17:14.534 - 01:17:24.940, Speaker B: And if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet, what are you even waiting for? Go to ledger.com, grab a ledger, download ledger live, and get all of your defi apps all in one space.
01:17:25.470 - 01:17:42.702, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back with the takes of the week. Let's start here where we left off in the news. There was this tweet abandoning ethereum. Ethereum abandoning its users. This is Suzu from a 16 z. David. Do you want to just set the stage? What's the context for this before we give some of our takes and then the takes from around the community?
01:17:42.836 - 01:18:15.638, Speaker B: Yeah. So Suzu is kind of like the starting really started this whole thing off. But Suzu is a member of 3 hours capital. We've had 3 hours capital on the show before, right during the peak of the May run, where ether was like breaking all time highs into the $4,000 range and there was like the whole flipping narrative had them on the show, 3 hours capital. They are traders. They trade on narratives. They make big moves over like maybe couple of months to half a year to year, long time horizon moves and they just trade, trade.
01:18:15.638 - 01:18:16.326, Speaker B: Bitcoin dominant.
01:18:16.358 - 01:18:16.986, Speaker A: Really good at it.
01:18:17.008 - 01:18:17.834, Speaker B: They're really good at it.
01:18:17.872 - 01:18:19.370, Speaker A: They've been doing it for a long time.
01:18:19.440 - 01:18:52.070, Speaker B: Yes. They move markets. They literally have billions and billions of dollars. And so people pay attention to what these guys say, because whoever's got a billion dollars captures a bunch of attention, especially when they have the track record that they do lately, since the last maybe six months or so, they have heavily been promoing avalanche on twitter. And this is what they do. This is the classic. This is what a lot of people do in this industry, and not even inside this industry, especially in this industry, but also even in the legacy industry, people funds do this, hedge funds do this, Goldman Sachs does this.
01:18:52.070 - 01:19:03.606, Speaker B: They fill and then they shill. What that means is that they fill their bags and then they talk about their. Goldman Sachs will take a position, something, and then they'll publish some price target. It's really them just like pumping their bags.
01:19:03.638 - 01:19:09.462, Speaker A: Right. You remember when Cuban came on, Mark Cuban, he was like, get long, then get loud.
01:19:09.526 - 01:19:09.802, Speaker B: Yes.
01:19:09.856 - 01:19:11.898, Speaker A: That's his mantra for investing. Same thing.
01:19:11.984 - 01:19:34.082, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is a common activity. It's annoying to some people in the industry because some people have different time horizons than, like, trades over three months to a year. Some people are looking at this industry ten year long time horizons. And so trading in the short term is just meaningless. And that actually is, I think, really the through line behind all of the drama that happened. Here's Ryan Selkis summed it up.
01:19:34.082 - 01:20:05.130, Speaker B: People thinking five months out, arguing with people thinking five years out, the story of most debates on crypto Twitter. So really that kind of frames this whole conversation. Meanwhile, Suzu Kyle Davies really, like pumping the hell out of avalanche. The kind of the idea, a conspiracy about why they're doing this is that they missed the Solana run, yet they saw avalanche as like, the next obvious target for a similar run on the heels of Solana. And so it started pumping avalanche really, really hard.
01:20:05.200 - 01:20:11.454, Speaker A: If they get loud, they can kind of make it a self fulfilling prophecy. They can kind of make it happen if they get enough people to believe it.
01:20:11.492 - 01:20:45.786, Speaker B: Yeah, like Suzu has like half a million followers on Twitter. Kyle Davies has a couple hundred thousand as well. People pay attention to these things, and they have consistently been pumping avalanche. And the Ethereum community tolerates this sort of behavior. They know a lot of people, they don't like it, but this is part of the game. They understand that traders gonna trade. It's different when especially a lot of these eth killers start actively fudding Ethereum with just straight up false information and misinformation, and then also start to attacking some of the actual purpose and meaning of the builders and what they're building.
01:20:45.786 - 01:21:11.634, Speaker B: And that is what happened here. Kane from Kane Warwick kind of started this thing off, saying, a lot of people I respected earlier in this cycle have sold out in pursuit of profit maximalism, chasing opportunistic gains at the expense of their reputation. Remember this when they all come flooding back to the ethereum ecosystem once l two, scaling becomes inevitable. So Kane isn't just talking just about theoreticals capital, he's talking about just the cohort of people that do this.
01:21:11.672 - 01:21:13.506, Speaker A: Right. And to be fair, didn't name the.
01:21:13.528 - 01:22:23.046, Speaker B: Ears capital, didn't name anyone by name. Saying this in general, just saying it in general. This is relevant to the arrows capital, but is relevant to a lot of people in this space who trade on narratives and not on fundamentals. And that's another dividing line between the debates, like people who trade on narratives or people who trade on fundamentals. And so in the article, I say what happens next is that Suzu responds to this tweet claiming hypocrisy due to Kane Warwick selling a position of his SNX tokens to purchase $50 million of real estate in Australia across two different properties, I believe. And so we have this billionaire trader who's, like, doing the whole filled in, chill thing being critiqued by Kane Warwick, who is not a billionaire but might be kind of close, definitely upwards of 500 million, and these two very wealthy people going after it, one claiming that the other one is, like, dishonest and illegitimate. Right, Suzu? If you want to scroll up a little bit, Ron Suzu says you literally chose the worst scaling solution possible for your users to defend your own eth bags, therefore making your own community actually poor.
01:22:23.046 - 01:22:30.006, Speaker B: Now you have the audacity to insult anyone not as eth tarded as you. Good for you, is what Suzu said to Kane.
01:22:30.038 - 01:22:34.058, Speaker A: So very spicy for you, is that go f yourself?
01:22:34.224 - 01:22:40.734, Speaker B: Oh, that's go f yourself. That's go f. I kind of made that up on the spot. I didn't really know what it was. All right, cool. Go f yourself. Yeah.
01:22:40.772 - 01:22:41.070, Speaker A: Okay.
01:22:41.140 - 01:23:04.930, Speaker B: And then Kane responds to sue. The fact that you can't see the distinction between hedging your exposure to crypto in an alternative asset and turning into the shill of a competing l one is bizarre. I know you're smarter than this, so I'm assuming this is just an emotional response. And so that was day one of fighting. There was many, many threads, a lot of other conversations that happened as a result of this many people in the comments.
01:23:05.090 - 01:23:06.454, Speaker A: Everyone has to weigh in on this.
01:23:06.492 - 01:23:31.002, Speaker B: Everyone's got to weigh in. Yeah, that was just day one. Day two. A little bit over 24 hours later. This is last Saturday, Suzu tweets out, yes, I have abandoned Ethereum, despite supporting it in the past. Yes, Ethereum has abandoned its users despite supporting them in the past. The idea of sitting around jerking off while watching the burn and concocting purity tests while zero newcomers can afford the chain is gross.
01:23:31.002 - 01:24:02.540, Speaker B: And these are some strong words. Where Ethereum has abandoned its users, that goes to the heart of so many eth devs, both on the l one and on all the l two research that has been going on. The whole concept of roll ups is something that was funded by the Ethereum foundation to independent researchers to figure out the scaling problem. And Suzu is coming in and saying Ethereum has abandoned its users because it refuses to juice up the l one in order to compromise on decentralization in order to actually create scale enough to fit everyone.
01:24:02.990 - 01:24:11.642, Speaker A: It begs the question, what does abandoning users actually mean? Right, by centralizing. The thing is that the worst abandonment of users.
01:24:11.706 - 01:24:22.430, Speaker B: Yes. In my mind, abandoning decentralization is the abandonment of the individual because decentralization and individuals go hand in hand. That's a topic for a different day.
01:24:22.500 - 01:24:23.582, Speaker A: But you also said something.
01:24:23.636 - 01:24:26.002, Speaker B: I actually kind of did say that. So maybe that's a topic for right now.
01:24:26.056 - 01:24:26.702, Speaker A: It's relevant.
01:24:26.766 - 01:25:05.626, Speaker B: So I follow up with this Suzu tweet saying, suzu, abandoning decentralization is the biggest sin that you can commit in this space. It's easier to fix fees than it is to fix decentralization. A lot of people didn't really like that sin word. However, I did choose it extremely precisely. But that is kind of a larger elaboration point, which I won't go into here. I definitely got my fair share of flak for this tweet because people were throwing poo left and right on these Twitter threads. But the majority of the critiques was that I was making the assumption that anything that's not ethereum is, quote, not decentralized, and that I'm co opting the word decentralization to only mean ethereum.
01:25:05.626 - 01:25:43.914, Speaker B: Well, the thing is, avalanche is a blockchain that is absolutely, it's a fork of death, and it's just pushing the limits. It's just like juicing up how much throughput that you can actually have on the chain to the point where if they add any more, the chain falls apart. And they know this because they have had to cap the number of validators that can validate the chain. Because if there's too many nodes, not enough nodes can sync up to the chain, and it causes the chain to just fork off and not be able to have consensus. Literally, the network topples over. We saw the same exact phenomenon happen with salana when it went down for 17 hours. Like, it got too juiced and the network just froze because they just pushed it to the limits too much.
01:25:43.952 - 01:25:58.590, Speaker A: Well, we were just talking earlier about binance smart chain. All the issues that validators are having with binance smart chain is because big blocks, and it becomes more centralized and possible to run until the entire thing not only centralizes, but then falls over.
01:25:58.660 - 01:26:09.854, Speaker B: Right? So all these same eTh killer chains, what they are really doing is they are just pushing the limits on network throughput up to the point of instability and then not going actually any further.
01:26:09.902 - 01:26:10.114, Speaker A: Right?
01:26:10.152 - 01:26:12.226, Speaker B: Just like stable, but not quite.
01:26:12.328 - 01:26:31.754, Speaker A: Yes. Not all of them get to that point of instability, but all of them get to the point where your MacBook pro can no longer run an actual non validating node. Right? It has to be in a data center. It has to be a big, strong, beefy machine. And they say that's okay. They say that's fine. And ethereum says no, that's not fine.
01:26:31.754 - 01:26:39.066, Speaker A: That is centralization. That is the exact thing that we're fighting. That is the old system. We want a more decentralized system here.
01:26:39.168 - 01:27:42.314, Speaker B: Yeah, it really goes, and I'm going to make a video or something about this later, but it really goes like is the network separating its participants into two classes of citizens, the people that can validate the system and the people that are just users of that system? Because there's a lot to unpack there. But let's go back through the story and I kind of add some context in this post that I put out on Monday. The Ethereum community is known for its inclusivity and its openness. This culture of inclusivity came out as a reaction to the closed mindedness and maximalism fostering of bitcoin culture that eventually pushed Vitalik out of bitcoin and many, many other future ethereums out of bitcoin circles. And ultimately those people ended up gravitating towards Ethereum because Ethereum was a reaction to the lack of inclusivity of bitcoin. This openness and acceptance of Ethereum is a very important part of Ethereum culture, but it's also a double edged sword. Bitcoiners have learned to make very firm, hardline stances where ethereums have been more willing and accepting and trusting of new ideas, new people and new efforts.
01:27:42.314 - 01:28:20.678, Speaker B: This has allowed Ethereum as a community to grow, but it also lets wolves come in wearing sheep clothing in 2018 to 2020. Ethereum did not have a spine during this time. Bitcoiners actually set the narrative of what Ethereum was, and Ethereum as a community was just a complete pushover. It's actually Ryan here that made this big flag in the ground, I think, around 2019 saying ETH is money. Yo, fun fact, Ryan, Sean Adams made the ETH is money meme because it was a reaction, because all the bitcoiners like ETH isn't money, bitcoin is money. And we started like, no, EtH is money. And we actually started to grow a spine as a reaction to all the bitcoiner fud that happened with Ethereum.
01:28:20.774 - 01:28:22.138, Speaker A: And now it says Sotheby's, by the.
01:28:22.144 - 01:28:59.866, Speaker B: Way, now it's on ETH is money. And so this culture that we've had, Ethereum actually standing up for himself, is completely different now. And this is what happened in reaction to Suzu's tweet we have Hayden Adams saying no issue with l ones that prioritize immediate scaling over decentralization. Many users want this, but this is a really bad take, incredibly insulting to everyone working on east two and layer two s, especially from someone who has gained extraordinary wealth off the backs of Ethereum builders. Ethereum's capital is a massive investor in starkware who we just had on the show, and they are working on scaling Ethereum. So this whole narrative shenanigans on Twitter is just like such short, not just.
01:28:59.888 - 01:29:16.526, Speaker A: 3 hours capital too. Multicoin Arthur yeah, the multicoin defiance capital. Defiance Capital was a big investor in synthetics in the early days and made a lot of money on their defi bets with synthetics. Carry on.
01:29:16.548 - 01:29:46.134, Speaker B: Defiance Capital is a capital firm that was bankrolled by 3 hours capital. Sazzle Anthony Cesano says ethereums were born in the FuD molded by it. We survived a brutal bear market and came out stronger than other. We're not going to sit back and let bullshit be spread around Ethereum. We're going to fight back with everything you got. DC investor says project teams I strongly recommend you stop giving allocations on your cap table to funds who don't give a flying f about the ecosystem you are building in or the goals you are trying to achieve. Money is plentiful in this space.
01:29:46.134 - 01:30:19.874, Speaker B: You always have the option. Then the last tweet here, Eric Connor I loved how fired up crypto Twitter gets when the Ethereum community actually decides to defend itself every day. Ethereum killers just shit misinformation on ethereum. Sometimes you have to defend sell us your eth at $4,400, then go f off. And the interesting thing that I think is really cool about this story is what I'm calling the critique chain. This is the pattern that we see going on right now. The Ethereum community is critiquing the Ethereum killers in the same way that bitcoiners critiqued Ethereum back in the day.
01:30:19.874 - 01:30:58.414, Speaker B: A centralized blockchain that only a few people could run nodes on. Early Insiders got an outsized allocation of funds, building an ecosystem on anti promises. These are the same critiques, but now it's just different communities pointing these critiques at other different communities. So it makes sense when avalanche and Solana community looks towards the Ethereum community and sees the same things that Ethereum see in bitcoin. The incumbent chain wants to spin the narrative that every other chain is as centralized as a vc chain. The disruptor chain wants to spin the narrative of the lazy, lost, applaud elitists who no longer care about the values they originally purported. These critiques just get passed down the line, right? So what is actually true? What is actually true?
01:30:58.532 - 01:31:22.774, Speaker A: Okay, so all of this, here's the critique, David, all of what you just said, it sounds like you're an eth maxie. That's what they would say. They would say you are like doing the same thing that bitcoin maximalists did previously and saying the only money is bitcoin. The only chain is bitcoin. Everything else is just like a shitcoin. Everything else is garbage. Right? Now you're saying that Ethereum's way is the only way.
01:31:22.774 - 01:31:37.846, Speaker A: Is this what you're saying? And Ethereum equals decentralization. Both are the same, but these other chains are redefining what decentralization actually means and your view is too narrow. You are an ethereum maxim. So what do you say to that critique?
01:31:38.038 - 01:32:28.294, Speaker B: Yeah, what I say to that critique is there are twofold, there's two things that are really, really important about a network. Who's got all of the tokens and who can run the chain. Those are the two variables that are really important when it comes to decentralization. And so what is actually true about this? Someone is right in these criticisms about like, you've gone too far down the centralization spectrum. And so I think that bitcoin maxis are wrong about Ethereum. They say like, ethereum's got this pre mine, it had all these insiders. The Ethereum presale was an open, permissionless, censorship resistant, non Kyc Presale that sold 60 million of the 72 total million ether to over 9000 participants on day one and raised $14 million for funding.
01:32:28.294 - 01:33:05.000, Speaker B: Of that 12 million that was left, over half went to the Ethereum foundation to fund developments. And that has part of that EF, it just pays client teams, pays for research. It gave Starkware a $4 million grant to run ZK roll up technology, which now powers immutable, so rare DyDX and which 3 hours capital is an investor in. And so a lot of these half of the 12 million that wasn't sold to the public went to funding operations like this. The other half went to the Ethereum co founders and early contributors like Vitalik, Joe Lubin, Mahali, a bunch of other people.
01:33:06.170 - 01:33:53.010, Speaker A: This sounds like distant past, though. Somebody could argue know so what it's distant past, I guess distribution. Distribution is more concentrated with a salana or avalanche or layer one, but it'll get more distributed over time. Right? Eventually some of these people who made a lot of money are going to actually sell. It'll just get more decentralized. Everything you just talked about, for a lot of people, they weren't there in those early days, so they didn't benefit from the crowd sale or any of the upside. Right? So what about that? You're just saying that the centralization line stops at Ethereum, right? The decentralization line stops at Ethereum.
01:33:53.010 - 01:34:01.546, Speaker A: These people are saying, no, actually, we could go a little further. We go to avalanche, we could go to Solana, and that's fine, right?
01:34:01.568 - 01:34:50.342, Speaker B: So on the spectrum of things like Solana and avalanche are way more decentralized than your typical commercial bank. They are on the decentralization spectrum. But the difference between the Ethereum pre sale and the VC backed avalanche and Solana chains is that the Genesis event for the Solana tokens and avalanche tokens was only given to insider vcs. Right? And so where the Ethereum pre sale was open and permissionless, actually having upside to the very beginnings of this network was reserved for already heavily financially capitalized investors. You saw the people on the all in podcast, the four billionaires who are on this big flex fest talking about their massive Solana bags and how they made a billion dollars. It wasn't open to the public. And the first impressions for these chains are really, really important because they create the culture downstream.
01:34:50.342 - 01:35:37.138, Speaker B: And so this is also where the actual system design of the blockchains also impacts this, where the centralization of the difficulty of running a node also restricts who can actually verify the chain. And so these things tilt towards centralization over time. Only a few people were able to have early access to the tokens. Only a few people can run the chain. And so the centralization is double, is twofold, right? There's too many people with early bag holders owning the bags, and then there's too few people that can actually validate the chain. One of the beautiful things about Ethereum's version of proof of stake and also having a proof of work phase prior to that is that there's been this massive distribution event because everyone can run the chain. I started off with mining Ethereum.
01:35:37.138 - 01:36:01.978, Speaker B: My first ether that I ever got, I got from mining. It's myself as an individual, because I have the power to do that because of the design of the network of Ethereum. That is not true for avalanche. That's not true for Solana. You need to have very significant beefy hardware. You need to have knowledge with how to run a system like this because it's complicated. And then you also need to have a significant supply of the tokens in order to stake on these delegated proof of stake systems.
01:36:01.978 - 01:36:42.286, Speaker B: And so it's really about what culture are you instilling in your chain from day one? Are you instilling a culture of decentralization? Or are you instilling a culture of pumping the bags of the insiders and restricting the ability for the average individual to run a node or to have access to the upside? This is the difference. And I don't ever want to tell someone that they can't go use these systems. This is not a conversation about the users. If you are a user of avalanche and if you are a user of Solana and you are happy, that is great. We are not talking about you. We are talking about the people that are building these systems and are not thinking about the long term consequences of decentralization in five to ten to 50 years.
01:36:42.388 - 01:37:16.774, Speaker A: Yeah. So here's the thing, David. For me, it's not even that these other chains exist on another point of the decentralization spectrum. That is totally fine. I think we should have a rich spectrum of centralized things, side chains and crypto banks, exchanges, more fintech type of chains. And then we should have things like decentralized bitcoin and ethereum kind of on the other end of the spectrum. What kills me is like the decentralization theater, right? It's the pretending to be a thing that you're not.
01:37:16.774 - 01:37:37.294, Speaker A: It's a world where you're pretending there are no trade offs. It's a world within Suzu's original tweet where it's like avalanche cares about users because it has low gas fees right now and Ethereum doesn't because it has high gas fees right now. Right. Without acknowledging or recognizing the trade offs. It's the deception that kills me.
01:37:37.332 - 01:37:37.534, Speaker B: Yes.
01:37:37.572 - 01:37:39.226, Speaker A: Okay. It's like the deception.
01:37:39.418 - 01:37:41.466, Speaker B: That's why crypto, Twitter blew narrative.
01:37:41.578 - 01:38:15.466, Speaker A: That's what. Yeah. The deception and deception in pursuit of bag pumping, in pursuit of wealth from people who are already exceptionally wealthy, the wealthiest people in crypto, exceptionally well. And it's just this gets back to why we're here and the responsibility that we have, right. As early settlers in these strange new lands, we are here first. And I feel very strongly that we have a responsibility to future generations to get this whole thing right because we have one shot at it. Okay? It could be five years, ten years come to pass.
01:38:15.466 - 01:38:45.540, Speaker A: I think crypto is inevitable. Blockchain, this whole thing is inevitable. What's not inevitable is that on the other side of this, we have a decentralized, open, permissionless money system. That part is not inevitable. What could very much happen is on the other side of this crypto transformation. We make a whole bunch of new bankers, super wealthy, and they're just new bankers that, again, control the masses, clamp things down, and extract, become rent extractors. Right.
01:38:45.540 - 01:39:06.774, Speaker A: I think the people in this space who are here now actually should be held to a higher standard, and they should acknowledge and accept the responsibility I get. If you're a trader, you're just here. You're trying to make money. You're a profit maximalist. That's okay, too. We need profit maximalists in this space too. You're a mercenary.
01:39:06.774 - 01:39:08.486, Speaker A: Okay, there are settlers. There are mercenaries.
01:39:08.518 - 01:39:12.298, Speaker B: You're a mercenary, that's fine, but that's a valuable contribution.
01:39:12.394 - 01:39:33.618, Speaker A: That's valuable. But acknowledge you're a mercenary. Don't try to pretend you're a settler and actually be a mercenary. That's what pisses me off. And I think that's why this tweet caught fire. Right. It's not really about the users, is it? And, yeah, that's why I think this tweaked a lot of people.
01:39:33.618 - 01:39:33.954, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:39:33.992 - 01:40:04.402, Speaker B: So sue is trying to brand himself as like, oh, I care about the users. And ethereum people don't because I'm promoting avalanche, which actually has a blockchain that has cheap fees. Also, in the last week or so, avalanche usage has actually gone up to where a uniswap trade cost $20. I saw a uniswap trade cost $20. A lot of these things have cheap fees because they're not being used. Right. And so not only is there deception about the intentions, but it's also just straight up deception as the actual innovations that are happening on these chains.
01:40:04.402 - 01:40:49.958, Speaker B: You don't get to just call the fact that you spun up a chain and it has had empty blocks for the last two years innovation because there's cheap fees. And Hazu had a really good take about this, where he said, truth be told, other than choosing different points on the decentralization cost spectrum, what ten x useful improvements have other layer ones made in the last four years? And so a lot of frustration out of the Ethereum community is that avalanche again, which is just a fork of geth. We already have geth. Avalanche forked it, juiced up the block sizes, and then called it innovation. Right. Sure, there is demand for that, especially when Ethereum fees are like, $200 to do anything on the layer one of course there's going to be demand for that. But what you don't get to say is that you haven't compromised on decentralization and you care about users.
01:40:49.958 - 01:41:19.570, Speaker B: And caring about users point is really important, point, because if you are not able to run your node, you are the product. It's the same thing with Facebook and the whole web two paradigm. You are the product, the users are the product. And so if you can't run a node, you are some banker's product. And that is the difference between a fully decentralized system where users are self sovereign and everyone is equal, versus a compromised system where only a few people can run a node and it's not you.
01:41:19.720 - 01:41:29.720, Speaker A: Yeah, and I'd remind people, because a retort to that is like, well, most people don't run their own nodes, do they? When they press a button on metamask, right? It's like, no, they don't. But they have the option to.
01:41:30.830 - 01:41:40.860, Speaker B: Incredibly important. Having the option to leave the system or to verify the system for yourself makes sure that you have the same amount of power that everyone else has, right?
01:41:41.630 - 01:42:09.926, Speaker A: I don't vote in every single election. Like, I try to vote in all the major elections, but I don't vote in every single election. But having the ability to vote in elections is the thing I want preserved in my governance protocols, right? If you can't run a vote, if you can't run a node, non validating node, you have no vote. You have no ability to say which block is valid and which is not, which upgrade is valid and which is not, and it removes power from the user base.
01:42:10.028 - 01:42:58.390, Speaker B: Anatoly, the CEO of Solana, said that Solana is objectively decentralized, which is already an oxymoron because you can't actually measure decentralization. Therefore you can't objectively be decentralized. It's always subjective at the end of the day. But then Paulie Nyer responds to this claim that Solana is objectively decentralized, saying, ah yes, objective decentralization. Like giving half of the token supply to insiders, creating a delegated proof of stake consensus mechanism so that they can rule over it, and making it so expensive that it's not a trustless network with only validators and a few users running nodes to defend against validator attacks. This is the difference between the network topology of Ethereum and the network of the topology of some of a chain that has just juiced up the validator so that not everyone can run the node. And then there was a lot of Ethereum developer pushback against the whole abandoning the users thing.
01:42:58.390 - 01:44:06.678, Speaker B: And the power about layer twos is that if you want to compromise on decentralization, you can do that on a layer two. And you can literally port the avalanche blockchain, the Salana blockchain onto a layer two, and then retain all the decentralization compromises that you've already made and even be able to have an even more cheap and more throughput environment. Yet you also still get the decentralization and security that Ethereum has prioritized. And so this is also something that really frustrates the Ethereum people, is that you have this side chain of avalanche, where you can port from Ethereum to the avalanche l one using a bridge. But that bridge could have been turned into a cryptographically secure roll up and have avalanche be rolled up on Ethereum and have that be much more secure and retain decentralization. But they didn't do that because pumping l one tokens is way easier, especially when you just give them to people like give the tokens to 3 hours capital at the genesis of the whole entire chain in order to get this pay for the mercenaries that bootstrap this fake community around it. Same thing that happened to Salana.
01:44:06.678 - 01:44:13.066, Speaker B: If you can't generate a community yourself, give your tokens to multicoin capital, they'll do it for you.
01:44:13.168 - 01:44:13.482, Speaker A: Right?
01:44:13.536 - 01:44:30.834, Speaker B: And so this is kind of where a lot of Ethereum people get frustrated. It's like you're compromising on decentralization when you could have just been done a roll up and you're making it an l one because you need people to invest in your chain and because the community wasn't going to do it anyways in the first place. This is where a significant amount of frustration for me comes from too.
01:44:30.952 - 01:44:43.446, Speaker A: Yeah, I do think there's a lot of it. I want to be careful though, because I think that one thing that I don't think you're saying is that these other chains don't have communities or users or this sort of thing, right?
01:44:43.548 - 01:44:46.022, Speaker B: They didn't first, they didn't lead with that.
01:44:46.156 - 01:45:30.262, Speaker A: But there's after, there's like a question of know, many of these chains know developers, they have activity. They have a lot of things that are getting built on. Mean, Solana has a fantastic wallet, for example, the phantom wallet, which know arguably a better wallet experience than what Ethereum has today. There's some stuff getting built out in these chains, right? Whether the asset justifies everything that's getting built out or not is maybe a different question. And so, from a user perspective, I think going back to the points, users should feel free to use whatever solution they feel like. Go use robinhood if you want. Go use coinbase if you want.
01:45:30.262 - 01:45:53.162, Speaker A: Go use a sidechain. Go use polygon. Go use avalanche. Go use Solana if you want. Just use whatever you want. So there's no judgment here. The wrath, I think, is coming from people who are just exploiting retail investors on short run narratives that they actually know don't have sustainable longevity.
01:45:53.162 - 01:46:12.034, Speaker A: And they're fudding projects that are taking the slower, more difficult, decentralized route. That's where it goes off course, right? That's where people get frustrated, and I hope that comes. Uh, let's talk about some other reactions from the community. So what is Cyrus saying here?
01:46:12.072 - 01:46:49.822, Speaker B: Yeah, Cyrus says demand for cryptocurrency has greatly outpaced the technology. Given the macro climate. Vcs and other financial opportunists have found a way to monetize this imbalance by shilling centralized change to satiate the demand from retail. To save face, they claim that they are offering experimental alternatives with credible decentralization plans. Dubious eth maxis as a combination of a true passion for decentralization and b their bags are fighting back against this narrative. When ETH, or even BTC for that matter, given its status as the only other reasonably decentralized coin, finally scales, literally every single one of the opportunists will be beck. This is all short term monetization plan.
01:46:49.822 - 01:47:02.910, Speaker B: Due to the difficulties in actually scaling this tech, I'm skeptical anyone actually thinks these centralized chains are the future. If they do end up being fully decentralized, then I guess the Ethereum community was wrong. Place your short and long term bets accordingly.
01:47:03.070 - 01:47:04.434, Speaker A: That's a very rational take.
01:47:04.472 - 01:47:06.366, Speaker B: I think that's a great summary of what just happened.
01:47:06.408 - 01:47:07.750, Speaker A: Yeah, here's another one.
01:47:07.900 - 01:47:27.110, Speaker B: Paulina. Crypto Twitter is like an equestrian club from 1885. A bunch of spoiled, and I don't even know that word, irascible. Irasscible brats squabbling over whose horse is the fastest. Meanwhile, a gentleman called Carl Benz was building this contraption called the automobile. He's referring to ZK roll ups.
01:47:27.270 - 01:47:31.450, Speaker A: Irrescible brats. That's in the 1885 terminology there.
01:47:31.520 - 01:47:32.090, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:47:32.240 - 01:47:33.722, Speaker A: What about this take? This is you.
01:47:33.776 - 01:48:05.890, Speaker B: This is the one to round it all out. And I say we are fortunate to be alive during a pivotal moment in human history. The choices we make here and now will have outsized impact upon future generations that use these systems. We must knowingly take on this responsibility. And I think this is something that really divides crypto into two camps. It's people that understand that the choices we make will have impacts upon our kids and our kids kids and our kids kids. And so we need to make sure that we make the right choices for them today, because these things will ossify.
01:48:05.890 - 01:48:54.610, Speaker B: Little did I know when I signed up for Facebook in high school that Facebook would be causing civil wars like 10, 15, 20 years down the line or swaying the actual election of the United States of America. I didn't know that when I signed up for Facebook. But this is my favorite quote from the cipher punks manifesto, is that cipherpunks understand that the code they write impacts the people that use it. And so we need to make sure we have a very small window of opportunity to actually make sure that these systems that we are designing are people first, now and for forever. And there's a lot of people who the profit maxis out there that are trading. They're doing whatever they're going to do. It's the profit maxis that trade on try to make this their narrative, too, while they apply it to their bags that don't actually resemble this narrative.
01:48:54.610 - 01:49:07.994, Speaker B: They know that this is true. They know that the decisions we make are critically important right now. And then they say that they are making those same choices on something that's actually compromised and actually decentralized. That is inexcusable in my mind.
01:49:08.112 - 01:49:33.986, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you know what's funny is write this in a newsletter, bankless newsletter. It's supposed to be sort of a crypto investor newsletter, and this is supposed to be a crypto investor podcast. But we are not actually profit maximalists. We're not. Which is like sacrilege to say in some circles. I think somebody like, at 3 hours capital Suzu is like, why aren't you profit maximalists? You should be right.
01:49:33.986 - 01:50:19.074, Speaker A: But it's like, there are things that are more important than making money in this space. And one of the things that I think we care deeply about and bankless cares deeply about is that we actually create a bankless money system for the world. That's a decentralized property rights system for the metaverse, right? This is our opportunity. And so close. Like, if we get it right, there's literally, it's like literally a fork in the road. We get it right, we've got a fantastic future ahead of us. If we get it wrong, well, it's going to be a repeat of the broken kleptocratic system that we see in the physical world, except in the metaverse, it might be even worse than the metaverse, right? So I feel a tremendous amount of responsibility to get this right.
01:50:19.074 - 01:50:34.962, Speaker A: And it's like people are going to get super wealthy along the way. You're going to do great holding these ideals, right? Because you're here early, you're building the future. You're not going to be as wealthy as the pure profit maximalist. But how do you measure wealth?
01:50:35.026 - 01:50:35.206, Speaker B: Right?
01:50:35.228 - 01:51:25.106, Speaker A: It goes back to how do you measure wealth? Is it just about your net worth? Is that the only measure of wealth? Or you actually care about the systems that you're building and the economic value that you create for the world around you? It's incredibly important. This is like back to, it's more like the 1780s than the 1980s or the 1990s, right? Because we're creating a constitution here, we're creating a governance protocol, and it's incredibly important that we get the balance of power, the decentralization. Right. Because people are literally going to be living on top of the systems that we're building today into the future. So we're not profit maximalists. I don't make apologies for that. I think the bankless program is more rewarding than just profit maximalism.
01:51:25.106 - 01:51:37.500, Speaker A: You'll do fine. I think people historically have done really well on bankless and on this journey, but it's not optimized for making the most money possible at all times in the market.
01:51:38.430 - 01:52:27.530, Speaker B: Crypto is a reaction to the current status quo. It's a reaction to the 2008 cris, it's a reaction to the incumbency. And it's because people feel disenfranchised and left out of the system that they feel more and more aligned with crypto because crypto is more inclusive. The goals of making a decentralized system that benefits our kids. I'm not a profit, Maxi, but I want the most amount of wealth to be created over the long term. I want my kids to be able to have financial upsides from the crypto industry, and I want their kids to also have financial upsides on the crypto industry. But if we create another system that the population has a reaction to because of the incumbents and because of the capture, then this system is going to break down.
01:52:27.530 - 01:52:37.086, Speaker B: And so this is about focusing on decentralization now means that our kids can prosper and our kids kids can prosper in a fair and equitable system.
01:52:37.268 - 01:52:40.206, Speaker A: Man, let's get to it. The end. What are you excited about this week?
01:52:40.308 - 01:53:06.834, Speaker B: Oh, gosh, that was long. Yeah, let's get looking forward into the future. I'm excited about all the future conferences that are coming right after thanksgiving, I'm going to Miami for Art Basil, hanging out with the optimism team there, as well as Nate Moeller, the artist that I bought all those NFTs from that I've been looking at right on my new tv NFT display thing right over my shoulder. Really, really cool. Stoked for that. And then I go straight to Puerto Rico for Metaverso for Puerto Rico blockchain week. Also for the Pleaser Dow retreat.
01:53:06.834 - 01:53:32.186, Speaker B: That's going to be fantastic in 2022. We got Eth Denver coming in February. Eth Denver's home. It's going to be amazing. Bankless live podcast maybe. And then right after that in May in permissionless in Florida, where we are throwing the bankless event with the permissionless team, with the blockworks team throwing the permissionless conference where Ryan and I meet for the first time. Just a lot of cool events on the horizon.
01:53:32.186 - 01:53:33.550, Speaker B: So I'm looking forward to all of them.
01:53:33.700 - 01:53:39.986, Speaker A: Yeah, that's awesome, man. You're counting me out for Eth Denver. I haven't quite decided. I might go. I still might go. I don't know. We'll see.
01:53:39.986 - 01:53:41.250, Speaker A: It's pretty cold, though.
01:53:41.400 - 01:53:43.620, Speaker B: It is very cold. I'll believe it when I see it.
01:53:44.630 - 01:53:45.682, Speaker A: You know me, I guess.
01:53:45.736 - 01:53:47.670, Speaker B: All right, Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:53:47.820 - 01:54:17.178, Speaker A: I'm excited about Starkware. We had a fantastic conversation with them earlier this week and people don't realize how close general purpose ZK roll up chains are. Right? I thought this was a year away, maybe two years away. I've heard estimates that this is like three to five years away. It feels like it's eminent. Okay, Starknet is going to ship next week. This is like an optimism or an arbitrary.
01:54:17.178 - 01:54:44.002, Speaker A: It's a little bit different in some ways. You can't directly port your contracts. It's not quite as Ethereum native, but it's similar in a lot of ways. And transaction speeds are going to be fast. The more transactions, the more applications, the lower the gas fees go. And it's like right here. Okay, so when you see the metaverse on it, we're going to see gaming application, we're going to see NFTs on it, we're going to see entire composable defi money legos.
01:54:44.002 - 01:55:12.842, Speaker A: And it's here. It's going to start, I think, relatively small, like in the next month or two. But six months from now, I think the crypto world is going to look completely different because we will have these ZK roll up chains that are at least as big, if not bigger, than many of the layer one roll ups that are out here. So I personally didn't realize this was so close. Like, I knew optimistic rollups were here. They're fantastic. They're a great solution.
01:55:12.842 - 01:55:32.630, Speaker A: Now we've got ZK rollups with starkware coming out to you. And then we also had a conversation with Polygon, who's doing some really cool stuff with ZK tech. I'm sure we'll have ZK sync the matter labs folks on here soon, but I really feel like 2022 is going to be a huge year for roll ups and for scalability.
01:55:34.010 - 01:55:35.926, Speaker B: I'm also excited about all.
01:55:36.108 - 01:55:38.758, Speaker A: I know you are. All right, let's get to the meat of the week.
01:55:38.844 - 01:55:56.938, Speaker B: Volcano cities. So this is tweet out of out of bankless hq. We got two people fighting in the grass. One's labeled Ethereum, one's labeled Ethereum killers. Then we have somebody posing in front of them looking like, yo, look at these idiots fighting behind me. And that's bitcoin. Bitcoin in their volcano cities.
01:55:56.938 - 01:55:59.742, Speaker B: Yeah, that. It was crypto Twitter this week for sure.
01:55:59.796 - 01:56:14.178, Speaker A: It's so funny. Bitcoiners were not even worried about all of the drama in crypto Twitter between ethereum and the ETH killers at all. They're just happy with the mining news and volcano cities and everything that's going on in the bitcoin space. I think that about sums it up, man.
01:56:14.264 - 01:56:28.866, Speaker B: Absolutely. All right, everyone, thank you for spending your Thanksgiving morning. Yeah, thanksgiving morning with us. And I hope you guys have a ton of fun with your families. You don't always have to talk about crypto, but if you do, remind them about the values of decentralization.
01:56:29.058 - 01:56:39.846, Speaker A: Absolutely. And remind them to tune in to bankless. Happy thanksgiving from us to you. We've got so much to be thankful for this year. Let me end with the risks and disclaimers. ETH is risky. Bitcoin is risky.
01:56:39.846 - 01:56:47.870, Speaker A: You could definitely lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
