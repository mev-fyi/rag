00:00:00.170 - 00:00:08.394, Speaker A: If DeFi frontends need to be licensed DeFi in America dies, people will not use DeFI through licensed front ends because it will simply look like CFI.
00:00:08.442 - 00:00:32.902, Speaker B: Well, I think I disagree with that, but I more strongly disagree with at least one of the things you said, even if I don't know which one. I don't know that you can simultaneously think what you just said and also think that by far the most important thing is that validators remain permissionless. Because what you're saying right now is you lose the whole thing if you give a permissionless this front end. But then you also said that you get most of the value if you have permissionless back ends. And so I think I'm now confused about which of those you think.
00:00:32.956 - 00:00:40.706, Speaker A: If you gate the way that people use DFI, which is through a GUI, if you gate that as a licensed financial institution, you have turned DFI into tradfi.
00:00:40.738 - 00:00:53.214, Speaker B: The sense I'm getting now is basically that you think that the front end is just about as important as the back. If you got like 70 30 ods on which was permissioned and which was permissionless, you'd be kind of like, just take whichever gives me the 70%. Is that kind of how you're thinking about this?
00:00:53.252 - 00:00:58.540, Speaker A: I'm thinking of this from the perspective of actually wanting the entire world to be able to use an open, immutable financial system.
