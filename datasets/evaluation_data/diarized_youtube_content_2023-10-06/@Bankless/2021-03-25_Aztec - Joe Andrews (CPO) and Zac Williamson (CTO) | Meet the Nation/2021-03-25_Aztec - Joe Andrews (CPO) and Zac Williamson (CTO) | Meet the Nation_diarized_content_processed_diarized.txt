00:00:07.450 - 00:00:43.406, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation, welcome to the most recent issue of Meet the nation. Today we're talking to Joe and Zach of Aztec Protocol. Aztec is a privacy software solution, working with ZK proofs, zero knowledge proofs on Ethereum to make private transactions a thing. And not only private actions, but also private, scalable transactions. So Aztec has been a team working in this space for a while, long anticipated. And they are just rolling out their ZK payments infrastructure, which is kind of like Venmo on ethereum, native payments on Ethereum. And so just simple sends of Ethi USDC.
00:00:43.406 - 00:01:33.494, Speaker A: But when you send it to someone, it sends it privately. And so this is in a roll up. And so you deposit your assets into the roll up, and then once they're in that roll up, in your specific address on that roll up, you can shield those funds and then send them to someone in a private manner using cryptographic magic. It's a really important conversation, really important piece of technology for Ethereum, because as we know, Ethereum and blockchain's open permissionless systems are completely transparent at all times. And so if we ever want to use this futuristic financial system for the future of finance, it would be really nice if we could pay people without doxxing our own accounts or just generally have privacy. We go into these conversations and why privacy is important in this show. So without further ado, let's go ahead and get right into this meet the nation with the guys from Assec protocol.
00:01:33.494 - 00:02:20.114, Speaker A: But first, we're going to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. If you are looking for a product that connects your fiat bank account with Defi tokens and products, you need to download the Dharma mobile app. Dharma is a noncustodial smart contract wallet and comes with a bridge that connects you right into your bank account. Dharma is the fastest and most efficient wallet between your fiat in your bank account and any token on uniswap, or even any vault in yearn with Dharma, you can get over $25,000 per week into the DfI universe. And you can do it noncustodially. If you or anyone you know is hot on DeFi and you're trying to get your money into a Defi investment, dharma is the place to go. Signing up and going through KYC is an absolute breeze.
00:02:20.114 - 00:02:51.614, Speaker A: It took me just under 3 minutes. And after signing into my bank account via plaid, I am now just one transaction away from any token that uniswap has to offer. Go to ww dharma IO. That's D-H-A-R-M-A IO. Download the dharma app and get yourself unbanked today. All right, bankless nation, I am here with Zach Williamson and Joe Andrews. Zach is the CTO at Aztec, and Joe is the chief of product at Aztec.
00:02:51.614 - 00:02:53.730, Speaker A: Guys, welcome to the nation.
00:02:54.870 - 00:02:56.614, Speaker B: Thanks. Happy to be here. Hi.
00:02:56.732 - 00:02:58.262, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having us on.
00:02:58.396 - 00:03:18.538, Speaker A: So, Aztec, you guys have been working for a decent while now, working to introduce privacy to Ethereum. So where does this conversation start? Why does Aztec need to exist? And how does Aztec bring privacy to ethereum? Maybe we could start at the high level, the bird's eye views away.
00:03:18.704 - 00:03:53.570, Speaker C: Yeah, sure thing. Yeah. So why do they exist? Good question. Yeah. Justify one's existence. We think that as a privacy company, obviously, we think that privacy is essential to the kind of the long term success and future of blockchain technology. So our thesis is effectively that as blockchain technology reaches more into people's everyday lives and it starts to intersect more with the real world, people's demands for privacy are going to very much mirror what they expect from their traditional web two counterparts.
00:03:53.570 - 00:04:46.280, Speaker C: So when you're, for example, if you're getting your salary paid through a blockchain or a large volume of your payments is going through a blockchain, and you don't want people to be able to snoop on what's going on there in the much more short term. Obviously, DeFi has been an absolutely huge kind of industry over the last few years. And if you are trading large notionals, then that's a big problem because that will move markets and people can see what you're doing and they can front run your trades and you have all these associated issues that privacy can very efficiently resolve. So that's why we're doing what we're doing, because we think that it's kind of critical for the user to be able to have strong privacy guarantees if they want to use a blockchain for if they want to move a lot of their kind of their online life into the web3 world.
00:04:48.010 - 00:04:49.880, Speaker A: Joe, you want to add anything to that?
00:04:50.250 - 00:05:15.460, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I just echo most of those sentiments, but I think it's a prerequisite for that as well. So if you want to have kind of self custody of your assets, I don't think that should come at the cost of everyone being able to see which those assets are, which is the current defi status quo. So we're setting out to change that, and it's going to be an exciting year with the launch of ZqMoney as the first step.
00:05:15.830 - 00:05:52.506, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. My personal experience with privacy on chain is like, I have two main wallets. I have my cash wallet, which has 1% to 3% of my net worth. And because I'm bankless, all of my net worth is in Ethereum. And then I have my cold storage wallet, which is where all the rest of my money is. And so when I'm trying to make payments, when I'm telling friends to pay me back for something or whatever, and I'm trying to get them to use crypto, I tell them to pay my payment wallet. But then if I ever want to get my payment wallet money down to my cold storage wallet, then I link those two things and so they can kind of see where literally all of my net worth is.
00:05:52.506 - 00:06:52.960, Speaker A: And that's a terrible user experience, because when I ask them to venmo me, that doesn't mean that they automatically get to look under the hood and see where all of my money is. And so that's bad. Ux. And Joe, you said something just now where if we all want people to do self custody for their own funds, that implies that, well, that's going to be transparent on the blockchain somewhere, where if I store my money on Coinbase, I can kind of use coinbase to kind of obscure things, but then I'm not self custodying anymore. And that's kind of the whole point of this revolution. Maybe before we get into how asset works, maybe talk about how transparent blockchains are, because people think that bitcoin, like naive people will say, like, bitcoin is only good for money laundering, or crypto is just good for just doing illegal illicit activity. Maybe talk about perhaps why that's not true and how incredibly transparent these systems actually are.
00:06:56.870 - 00:07:42.240, Speaker B: Well, I just want to give anecdote, one of our early employees actually fell fry of that same kind of, hey, pay me with crypto, and we could kind of see what else was happening and which kind of defi protocols they've been investing in. And I think for even people in the industry, it's kind of one slip up and you're kind of branding your entire publishing everything on chain. And we've actually run a piece recently on Mark Cuban, who had the same slip up recently when he tried to buy an NFT. So, yeah, I think there is a lot of misconceptions around how public a blockchain is. Maybe Zach can explain a little bit more about that case.
00:07:42.690 - 00:08:55.640, Speaker C: Well, right now, in order for a blockchain to kind of function, in order for everybody to validate the correctness of everyone's transactions, you need the entire transaction public. So basically, the web of who's paying who and how much they're paying is completely visible to anybody. And so people think it's anonymous or isn't transparent because people's identities are kind of masked by addresses. You have an ethereum address that might not be linked to your real world identity, but the more kind of financial activity you actually perform with that ethereum address, the less relevant your real world identity becomes, the more relevant your on chain identity becomes. And particularly if you can link that information with who you are in the real world, which can be quite easy if you pay a friend, for example, and they see what your address is, and then that information can get broadcasted who knows who. And so because you can build up that entire transaction graph, you can perform quite sophisticated statistical analysis to see who's spending what, how they're spending it, and where they're spending it. So, yeah, it's actually an incredibly transparent technology, and it needs to be right now in order to function.
00:08:56.250 - 00:10:22.740, Speaker A: And there are entire companies like chainalysis that are built on taking away the fog away from public blockchains, right, where they are intentionally doing all of the data aggregation and analytics that they possibly can to help. Mainly things like governments do very noble things, which is track down actual real crimes. I remember chain analysis was part of this child pornography bust that they were using bitcoin to pay for child porn. And I'm super happy to find out that that was something that was able to be traced. However, we can extrapolate that into perhaps more dystopian versions of the future, where if every single financial action, every sort of political donation, every sort of like where you shopped and where you sent your money is completely public, it throws into question, like, are we really a free society if all of our money is completely public and all the consequences are public of our money. And this is something that David Chalm, I think, even predicted back in the 80s, where if every single Internet action that all humans ever do ever are public, that can be used to control society. And so the importance of personal privacy over your funds couldn't be any more important.
00:10:22.740 - 00:10:41.686, Speaker A: So, with that background, let's go into a little bit of the details as to how you guys actually add privacy to Ethereum. Let's start with the underlying technology there. And so, Zach, since you are the CTO, let's start with you. How do you guys actually add privacy to Ethereum?
00:10:41.878 - 00:11:37.430, Speaker C: So, yeah, well, through zero knowledge, cryptography, on the surface, seems like an almost impossible problem. Because in order to validate the correctness of every ethereum transaction, you need to see it. So how do you achieve privacy? How do you ensure the blockchain is correct, no one's double spending or cheating when you can't actually see people's transactions? And so this is where zero knowledge proofs come in. It's a technology which allows you to basically to prove the correctness of some piece of logic whilst keeping allowing you to hold back some secret information. So one example would be when you're logging onto a website, you could prove that you know your password without. So right now, if you log on to website, generally what happens is you send your plaintext password to the website. They then will hash it and check it against their records and see if you know the password, your username.
00:11:37.430 - 00:12:34.126, Speaker C: But instead you could serve as proof, proving to the website, say to Amazon, saying, I know what the password is for my username, I'm not going to share it with you. But here's a mathematical proof that I know it. And that's kind of effectively a similar thing to what we're doing here, where we're encoding an encrypted transaction in one of these zero knowledge proofs, so that you have some inputs and some outputs, and you prove that some of the inputs equals to some of the outputs, so that there's no double spending. But it allows you to encrypt the values that you'll be ever being transferred and allows you to encrypt the identities of the senders and the recipients. So at a high level, that's how it works. However, getting it working on Ethereum, it's set with a lot of technical challenges, just because this technology is quite difficult to use at scale, because it's very computationally intensive to construct these mathematical proofs, right?
00:12:34.148 - 00:13:26.430, Speaker A: And so Ethereum doesn't actually care about its own transparent nature. It doesn't care to publish everything to the world. It only cares that a transaction is legitimate or not. And so the problem being tackled here is, can we tell Ethereum that we are making a legitimate transaction without also doing all the transparency stuff? If we make everything public, that's a very easy way to indicate to Ethereum that this is a legitimate transaction. But there are other ways that we can communicate to Ethereum that this transaction is legitimate, that we can obfuscate all of the identity features behind that transaction. And so again, like you said, that's with zero knowledge proofs, which is a cryptographic tool. How computationally intensive is this cryptographic tool? And is that a variable that can be adjusted via innovation?
00:13:26.850 - 00:14:15.018, Speaker C: Oh, absolutely, yeah. It's a variable that has been adjusted quite heavily already. We had to invent a lot of the technology ourselves to get this working on Ethereum. I guess the first case of this being used, this technology being used in production, was with the pioneering zcash block in 2015. Give some numbers that it would take a zcash node about 30 seconds to grind through the computations you did to make a Zoonos group. And that's running like software directly on your laptop or your computer. Generally, when people are talking using Ethereum, they're visiting dapps, which means that your typical mode of interaction is going to be a website, and the software you can run in a web setting is going to be much slower than you can run into a natively installing code on a machine like a zcash node.
00:14:15.018 - 00:14:40.678, Speaker C: So basically, the zcash trick originally took 30 seconds to make the proof. Our zero circuits are more complicated than the zcash ones because we wanted to build a social account recovery functionality. And we're working in building for the web where things are approximately where cryptography is roughly eight times slower. So you run those numbers and you can easily get to transaction like proof construction times that run into several minutes, if not longer.
00:14:40.844 - 00:14:50.682, Speaker A: And does that run up against Ethereum's block times? So if that proof construction time takes over a minute, yet Ethereum block times are 12 seconds, do those things collide or are those different?
00:14:50.736 - 00:15:11.978, Speaker C: They're a bit different because this is a user constructing a private transaction proof in that browser. So in theory, they can send it in any block, so they don't have to construct it within a block time. But for the sake of the user experience, you don't want them waiting a minute or 10 minutes to make it to grind through the serial knowledge proof.
00:15:12.154 - 00:15:17.010, Speaker A: Their computer cpu is just like going, and their fan is heating up and all that stuff, right, exactly.
00:15:17.080 - 00:16:25.110, Speaker C: Yeah. So we did a lot of original research into this problem ourselves. So me and my chief scientist, Ariel Gabazon, published a new kind of what's called Universal ZK Snark, which basically it's one of these. ZK Snark is a fancy kind of zero proof, where you can take any program and turn it into a mathematical proof. And traditionally, these ZK snarks come with a lot of drawbacks, like you need to do these very elaborate kind of trusted setups when you kind of encode your programmers as circuits, which is a big security risk, and it's a big coordination problem. Universal snarks basically get around the problem by requiring one of, like, basically, you need to do one trusted setup to generate some cryptographic secrets that nobody knows the keys to. But once you've done that step, which we did last year with our ignition ceremony, then you can encode any kind of program into the snark sector without running additional trusted setups.
00:16:25.110 - 00:16:52.190, Speaker C: So that was one of the innovations that this new breathing system we table plonk. We thought it was a funny name at the time, and it's the fastest universal snark available at the moment. And so we've had to basically improve the speed of these proving systems by at least an order of magnitude to make it practical for Ethereum.
00:16:53.970 - 00:17:17.122, Speaker A: Will you describe this as perhaps your guys'main obstacle or your main goal or. The main purpose of Aztec is trying and compressing ZK proofs into as small as a byte size. Is that even the right terminology, or just compressing the efficiency of these proofs down to as small as possible? Because is that the thing that you guys have really unlocked?
00:17:17.266 - 00:17:36.118, Speaker C: Well, more or less. It's not really the proof size, which is the problem, because the existing proving system, existing snark tech, has already crushed down the proof sizes to very small values. It's more the time it takes to construct these mathematical proofs on a computer. That was the massive bottom line that we had to perform a lot of original research to.
00:17:36.304 - 00:18:29.390, Speaker B: We still have some way to go as well. If you kind of look at this coming on par with a card transaction, a card transaction or a Venmo transaction, end to end is kind of a second, maybe a couple of seconds if you have a network hiccup. ZK money on a good device is about 8 seconds right now, but the next version coming out in the summer will make us on par with that, especially on native provers in apps. So I'd say we're mostly there for payments. The next challenge is then what other things can you do with these kind of transactions? Because we're not kind of in a fixed world of, hey, I can just pay you. We're running on Ethereum, so we can do anything, so you can do much more exciting things. And those proofs are still a little bit too slow to run on the browser.
00:18:29.390 - 00:18:54.546, Speaker B: But by the end of the year, we should be in a position where you can do very complicated kind of proofs. Maybe taking out a personal loan, proving your salary is above a certain threshold for a credit score, those sorts of things become a possibility, and we're really excited for that. To kind of become unlocked and have people move their identities into this network.
00:18:54.738 - 00:19:14.000, Speaker A: Right. That's definitely some of the more Sci-Fi applications of zero knowledge stuff. And I definitely want to get in there, but I think I've gone a little bit too far into the weeds for the listeners. So I want to back up and ask, what is aztec and what is the product that is available that you guys just released a couple of days ago? Maybe? Let's start there.
00:19:14.370 - 00:19:42.642, Speaker B: Sure. So we launched a kind of demo of our protocol. As it stands currently, it's at ZK money, so you can go to it now. It's live. You can think of it as a private demo, so you can register a username, shield some funds. At the moment, we just support ETH, but we'll have DAi, BTC and a few other assets coming shortly. Once you've shielded the funds.
00:19:42.642 - 00:20:22.930, Speaker B: They're private. They're kind of cloaked under the aztec veil. And you can send them to any other username in the network for reduction in fees compared to sending it on standard Ethereum. Or you could send it back to a different Ethereum address. So back to your earlier example of kind of your cash wallet and your hardware wallet. You could move funds between those wallets using Aztec if you wanted to, or you could have your friends pay you at your ZK money username instead of your hot wallet. So short term, we're going after kind of the private venmo for the crypto.
00:20:24.630 - 00:20:37.670, Speaker A: So when I've made my aztec account, it's David Hoffman at David Hoffman, just like my Venmo. And then what I did is I submitted one eth, I deposited one eth. And that's into a roll up, right? You guys are on a roll.
00:20:40.410 - 00:20:40.966, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:41.068 - 00:20:53.450, Speaker C: One of the things zkist nuts can also be used for scaling as well as privacy. So we did both. We are operating basically a layer two side chain using our zkist nut tech to enable more efficient private transactions.
00:20:53.610 - 00:20:56.480, Speaker A: Okay, and then what kind of roll up construction is that?
00:20:57.090 - 00:21:31.174, Speaker C: So it's one that I guess it's called the ZK roll up. Zkzk roll up. Basically, users construct private transactions locally on their device, and they send them to a roll up provider. And at that point, the roll up provider has no discernible information. You've already encrypted and anonymized your identity. And the roll up provider's job is to basically aggregate a lot of transactions to go. So they take 128 of these private transactions and they construct a zero proof which kind of validates the correctness of these transactions so that the only thing that goes to the Ethereum main net is 10 of proof.
00:21:31.174 - 00:21:37.980, Speaker C: That proves 128 private transactions instead of just one, which massively reduces the cost of what we're doing.
00:21:38.590 - 00:22:11.894, Speaker A: I remember Vitalik having a talk about this, where he was talking about the power of roll ups, and then he just went one layer deeper. It's like, well, we have roll ups, but what if we rolled it up again? And I think maybe that's what you guys are talking about, where you're adding in zero knowledge proofs which do compress data, right. And then inject it into a roll up, which compresses that data again. And then that is what is submitted to Ethereum. So not only do we have efficiency in transactions, but we also have privacy at the same time. That's pretty cool.
00:22:12.092 - 00:22:31.770, Speaker C: Thanks. Yeah, that's exactly what we do. And one of the main innovations we had, we developed was we were the first team that created the kind of technology that was capable of creating basically a zero knowledge proofs that validate other zero proofs in a manner that's compatible with cool.
00:22:31.840 - 00:22:51.566, Speaker A: And so, okay, so back to my user experience flow. So I set up David Hoffman on your guys'roll up, and then I submitted one ether, and so I have one ether in that roll up, and then I was able to shield that transaction. But I've got a question for you guys. Why was I only able to shield zero point 39 of my one ether that I deposited?
00:22:51.758 - 00:23:20.086, Speaker B: Yeah, you should have been able to shield the full amount unless you paid a very high fee. So we enable users to kind of configure the fee to make the roll up settle faster. If you shielded one e, and that was kind of settled, and all your transactions were stable, you should have that as your spendable balance if you were trying to send that to another user.
00:23:20.278 - 00:23:27.310, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe that's where I got caught up, because I think I was only able to send a fraction of the ether that I deposited.
00:23:27.650 - 00:24:01.690, Speaker B: Yeah. So you can think of this a bit like a bitcoin utxo. So when you have a shielded balance, it's not actually stored as one number. They're encrypted notes that have different values. So you'll start with kind of a note worth one z key, and then as you send it, if you send me 0.1, you end up with kind of a change note that's worth 0.9. And in the current system, you have to wait for that transaction to be processed before you get your change back, before you can then process the next transaction.
00:24:01.690 - 00:24:21.520, Speaker B: You can solve this with kind of a bit more cryptography, but in the current system, yeah, you have to wait a little bit. So if you're planning on doing lots of kind of individual transactions, it's best to kind of shield smaller amounts so you end up with lots of different notes. Or if you want to do a larger transaction, shield it all in one go.
00:24:23.590 - 00:24:38.326, Speaker C: We're working on resolving that user experience because it's our first deployment of this tech. There are a few kinks like this that we need to work out to make it a truly seamless experience.
00:24:38.508 - 00:25:01.920, Speaker A: So when you guys said that I could ask people to send me money on my ZK account, can I get them to do that from the main Ethereum l one? Can that be one seamless transaction? And do they need to be aware of the fact that I'm sending them to a ZK wallet? Or do they need to also have their ether or USDC or die or whatever in the ZK roll up?
00:25:02.450 - 00:25:45.210, Speaker B: Long term we can get there. At the moment, they would have to kind of shield via kind of ZK money, but they can shield directly to you. So instead of shielding to themselves and then sending it, they can do one transaction. I think it's quite an exciting place to maybe take the conversation for a little bit. Because if a wallet decides to integrate that and the native kind of flow inside a wallet is kind of, hey, send. The wallet could look up at David Hoffman or your ethereum address and it could decide how you want to receive things. And there's quite a lot of work being done by Ens to actually resolve ens domains to an l two.
00:25:45.210 - 00:26:01.998, Speaker B: So we're part of a research discussion group to try and get that working over the next year or two. So I think long term, it shouldn't matter kind of where you want to receive your funds in the short term, because this is kind of bleeding edge tech. There's a little bit of friction there.
00:26:02.164 - 00:26:33.180, Speaker A: Yeah, let's go into that a little bit more. So people often talk about with roll ups and l two s, there's fragmented liquidity, there's onboarding and offboarding onto these roll ups, and people are worried about that. Ux. And then we have the conversations around like connect is trying to build payment channels between various l two s. Just go into more detail about how you guys are available, options or paths forward that you guys have to help the flow of funds going in and out of the roll up.
00:26:33.870 - 00:27:05.134, Speaker B: Sure. I think we definitely see the fragmentation issues of people trying to move d five protocols to other layer twos for us, we're kind of focused on privacy. So our l two is going to be a home for people's funds where they can go out and do safe private transactions. So we're actually in the next release. We're building a bridge. We call it the DFI bridge. And that bridge enables you to kind of, I think of it like a bus leaving the roll up, and it's a bus going to a certain destination.
00:27:05.134 - 00:27:57.940, Speaker B: It could be uniswap, it could be another l two. It could be anywhere, basically on Ethereum. And we're using kind of tools like that to help us aggregate the cost of moving funds from aztec to another system. I do think that there is risk, though, with kind of other projects kind of trying to split the liquidity pools. And our short term kind of goal is just to, whenever we talk about DeFi, we're going to point our roll up to the main net liquidity pool. So we'll have, like, an eth die swap in a liquid pair, and we'll kind of make that available through the roll up, and it will call out to uniswap l one directly and make the swap and bring the funds back. We just think it's kind of a simpler way of getting the same effect without having to bake in all these new trust assumptions of fraud proofs or complex l two code.
00:27:58.310 - 00:28:23.414, Speaker A: Sure. So if I have a bunch of zke eth that I've deposited, and I want to turn that into ZK die, maybe I sign a message and you guys receive it on the roll up, and then whenever the bus leaves, I don't know, maybe once every hour or so, whenever the bus leaves, then all my zke will be swapped for ZK die. And none of my privacy features or characteristics have been leaked to the main chain.
00:28:23.542 - 00:28:35.498, Speaker C: Yeah, precisely. If that bus has, like, 99 other users on it, then you only pay, like, 1% of the cost of a layer. One uniswap transaction.
00:28:35.674 - 00:28:46.342, Speaker A: And so that one uniswap trade is actually shared between everyone else on the bus as well, probably, plus a little bit more of a little bit extra computation as well, but again, between every single rider on the bus.
00:28:46.476 - 00:28:47.638, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:28:47.804 - 00:28:53.266, Speaker A: And then could the rate of buses leave faster and faster and faster?
00:28:53.458 - 00:28:55.400, Speaker C: Yeah, as long as there's demand for it.
00:28:57.130 - 00:29:06.010, Speaker A: That's very cool. That's very cool. Where else can these buses go instead of just with amms? Are there other options as well?
00:29:06.160 - 00:29:40.530, Speaker C: Yeah, well, we're working on creating kind of an interface. Well, what we're calling this bridge contract, where basically the way we're modeling it is if your interaction with layer two or deeper protocol can be modeled as a token swap or two token swaps, then you should be able to integrate with this portal to our layer two that we're building so that you can then get the benefit of kind of having aggregate these kind of buses of users leaving Aztec and transacting with your protocol.
00:29:40.970 - 00:30:34.498, Speaker A: Hey guys, I hope you're enjoying the interview so far. Quick break in the action because we got to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently.
00:30:34.498 - 00:31:10.030, Speaker A: One of Ave's V two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on Uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them. Check out the power of aave@aave.com that's aave.com. Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got back into crypto back in 2017, and it has been my main exchange of choice to make. My crypto buys and sells.
00:31:10.030 - 00:32:09.682, Speaker A: Gemini is available in all 50 states in over 50 countries worldwide, and on Gemini there are markets for over 30 various crypto assets, including many of the hot DFi tokens like Wifi, Ave, Uni, and also they are one of the few exchanges that has liquid dai markets. Having both the option of logging into the Gemini.com website or instead opening the Gemini mobile app has allowed me to be able to access any and all exchange and on or off ramp services that I've needed to on a moment's notice. With instant deposits and fast withdrawals, I'm able to make my money do the things I want it to, when I want it to.

00:32:09.682 - 00:32:38.734, Speaker A: Check them out. Gemini.com gobankless very cool, very cool. Okay, so if I remember correctly, the product roadmap for Aztec was first getting these private payments and privacy the ZK roll up out the door. But then I think I remember something about just private smart contracts, like generalized private smart contracts. Is that what's next on the roadmap? Is that the next logical spot in the conversation, or is there something first that we should talk about?
00:32:38.852 - 00:33:37.746, Speaker C: Well, it's the end game. I don't want to make any unrealistic claims that when we'll get there, because there are a ton of technical hurdles that we need to overcome. But we've done all the heavy r and d lifting, so it's just about developing, building the tech now. Yeah. So right now, our layer two can just do basic private transactions, but the end state is that you can create completely private smart contracts directly within our layer two, kind of, instead of your smart contract being encoded as an EVM, as a block EVM code, your smart contracts encoded as a snark circuit. And that will enable users to build fully private assets where they can define their own transaction types and their own logic for how these transactions can occur, as well as building quite feature rich d five protocols that can talk to these private cryptocurrencies. And the end goal is to have that all happening directly on our layer two.
00:33:37.746 - 00:33:45.250, Speaker C: So to minimize the cost, the transaction costs of these kind of interpretate contract transactions.
00:33:46.550 - 00:33:47.474, Speaker B: So what does that mean?
00:33:47.512 - 00:33:49.406, Speaker A: Does that mean that. Go ahead, Joe.
00:33:49.518 - 00:34:34.994, Speaker B: I was just going to say, yeah, that the path to getting there is, I think, quite interesting as well, because there's a number of kind of stepping stones, I think, that make that truly useful. And right now, you may have noticed there's a limit on ZK money, and partly that's because of kind of the custody around keys in Zkmoney. We've solved that in the current version that we're testing on kind of internally, where we can kind of actually use standard Ethereum keys. So not only now will kind of the cost of a private transaction be cheaper than a normal Ethereum transaction, but you can enjoy the same kind of custody benefits that you choose to use for your kind of layer one assets. So I think that's a prerequisite. And then secondly, what does that mean?
00:34:35.032 - 00:34:49.570, Speaker A: Does that mean that the same private keys that I have on my normal metamask or ledger wallet does the same thing on the ZK wallet? So perhaps I just use that metamask drop down from going from the Ethereum l one to going to the ZK roll up. Is that what that implies?
00:34:49.730 - 00:35:25.374, Speaker C: Absolutely. So right now with the tech we've released, which you need to generate an aztec account, which has its own aztec private keys, which is quite like, this is generally the way that private transaction system has to operate because the kind of cryptography that Ethereum does to validate Ethereum transactions typically has been a little bit too expensive to perform inside a snark circuit. But our latest research has solved that problem. So that in our next version of the roll up. Yeah. You're going to be able to directly authorize and validate private transactions in our relayer two roll up directly with signatures signed through metamask with your Ethereum keys.
00:35:25.502 - 00:35:31.762, Speaker A: Very cool, very cool. Sorry, Joe, to cut you off, you were taking us through the path to get to private applications.
00:35:31.906 - 00:36:15.266, Speaker B: Yeah. So then the second step is we kind of have basic kind of contracts working internally for this Defi bridge we're building, but it's not developer friendly. I guess like 0.3 on the journey is us rolling that out to mainstream users and kind of battle testing the system. And once that's done, we can kind of take all those learnings and roll it up in a very nice kind of developer friendly SDK. And with our programming language we've been building called Noir, which will kind of realize the full end state of the vision. I think it's worth going into the details of noir because it's out in Alpha, but it's obviously not usable in the roll up yet.
00:36:15.266 - 00:36:34.330, Speaker B: We're just getting feedback on the language. Yeah, it's an ambitious roadmap, but I think that the next kind of three, six months, there'll be a lot of updates and I think people will start to see that this is kind of no longer kind of Sci-Fi tech. And it's running live on Mainet, so we're super excited.
00:36:34.670 - 00:36:49.390, Speaker A: Yeah, Joe, paint us that picture. What is the world of Ethereum like when Aztec is towards the end of its roadmap and everything that you guys want to achieve has been achieved. What can we do with Ethereum now that this new technology has been unlocked?
00:36:50.770 - 00:37:25.994, Speaker B: That's a good question. I like to think of the kind of software developer who's probably working at a crypto startup. He's now getting his salary paid through Dai. He's gone completely bankless, and now he's going for a loan. He can prove just from his phone that he's got enough kind of headroom in his disposable income to get the loan for his mortgage. Maybe he can even buy the house on chain, some sort of NFT through a noir contract. But that's maybe a few years away.
00:37:25.994 - 00:37:52.580, Speaker B: There's some property law you'd have to solve first. But yeah, I think those sorts of things are going to start to be kind of the topic of the conversation over the next kind of maybe twelve to 18 months. It's kind of no longer DFI, but like user finance. That I think is where we're really excited. It's the sort of finance that you want in your everyday life. And those are the things that Aztecs focused on.
00:37:53.830 - 00:38:47.800, Speaker A: So lately, especially with all of this DeFi speculation been going been every time that SBF or Alameda research, every time that they move their funds on chain, people say they start to speculate where those funds are going to go. Like Siriyero's capital, their address is defi maximalist eth. And so people watch that address, and then all of a sudden, you will see some token, random token pumping, or some massively valued NFT be purchased from an exchange with a maximally successful version of Aztec. Is all of the movements of these funds, or somebody buys the $60 million beeple NFT and people are all trying to speculate who it is. With Aztec, this can all be done in theory. No one would ever be able to know who is doing any sort of activity at all unless they chose to actually publish that. Is that correct?
00:38:48.410 - 00:38:48.918, Speaker B: Definitely.
00:38:49.004 - 00:39:47.750, Speaker C: Yeah. That's what we want to get to. The plan isn't to completely put a cloak around defi, because it's very difficult to be completely primarily about this. It's quite difficult to do a few things with full privacy, like, for example, decentralized trade matching. If you don't know what trades are, how do you match them? But what you can do is you can anonymize the identities of the traders, and you can also obfuscate the values by effectively making every transaction type uniform. So if you have an exchange trading like ETH and I, if you make every, if every, if every, if you want to do a large trade of, say, like 1000 e, if you split that up into 1001 e transactions using a roll up so it's cheap, then you can maintain the anonymity of your identity. And so, yeah, people will know the trade is happening, and that could still move markets, but they won't know who is actually the beneficiary or the instigator.
00:39:48.910 - 00:40:01.180, Speaker A: Very cool. So that's hopefully where we end up. But what about for the end of 2021? How will as technology impact people's lives this year?
00:40:02.750 - 00:41:14.930, Speaker B: Yes, I think ZK money, we're going to try and grow it another ten x, at least in terms of users, and really increase the functionality there. So we want private swaps from inside the interface and starting to also think about kind of other areas you can spend your capital. So if you've got some funds in ZK money, maybe you can use it to buy some things, kind of privacy products like password managers or vpns. So start to think of it a bit more like just a private home for your funds on Ethereum. So when you want to go and do something, you first go to ZK money, and then you can dispatch those funds to a friend or to purchase something. By the end of the year, we'll have these l one integrations for swapping out popular DFI assets, and we'll have fingers crossed testnet versions of noir in programmable privacy, kind of in alpha, people playing around with it on the testnets. But it'll be a few more months into kind of 2022 before we're ready to let the training wheels come off noir itself because it's extremely complicated.
00:41:15.910 - 00:41:31.210, Speaker A: Well, I'm very optimistic about the future of Aztec. And, guys, I have to ask the question, since we're in a bull market, is there a part of Aztec where a token makes sense? Is there a room for a token in the future of aztec?
00:41:33.390 - 00:41:35.126, Speaker C: Do you want to feel this one, Jay?
00:41:35.318 - 00:42:16.710, Speaker B: Sure, definitely there is. I mean, tokens have huge kind of benefits, especially in networks, and they can incentivize community and more specifically on a kind of layer two network where you need to kind of decentralize the actual network itself and have these kind of block producers or roll up providers, as we call them. Incentivizing those to perform correctly is a perfect use for a token. We're doing a lot of analysis on how to do that and whether it fits our kind of model. But, yeah, I definitely think if we achieve that vision, a token will have some big part of it. Wow.
00:42:16.780 - 00:42:25.980, Speaker A: Very cool. Awesome. Is there anything else that people should know about the future of Aztec and your technology? Anything we haven't covered yet?
00:42:28.430 - 00:42:49.810, Speaker C: I think all the points have pretty much been hit. Yeah, if you want to play around with that. As just said, we're live at ZK money. If you want to experience affordable privacy on Ethereum, it's here today. And yeah, we're really excited to be able to kind of like turbocharge our technology and bring a lot of innovation in this coming years.
00:42:49.960 - 00:43:11.420, Speaker A: Right, so now that Zkmoney and as technology has been deployed to Ethereum, I would imagine that you guys are looking for users, but I would also imagine you guys are looking for specific kinds of users or specific types of developers. So for people that are watching this, what kind of defi users or developers are you guys really looking for to help stress test your technology?
00:43:12.830 - 00:44:03.354, Speaker B: Yes. On the user front, I think it's anyone who's kind of had the same problem we went through earlier. They've moved some of their funds into Ethereum and they have two pools of capital and they don't want to link them. I think that's a great early user to test the current version. And in terms of developers, we have all of the functionality available that we built ZK money with through our SDK. So if you're a developer at a wallet or kind of any sort of crypto custody solution, I think having a play with our docs, which are live at developers aztec network would be a good place to start. And we can't wait to see people start to build their own interfaces that integrate with the system, because this is a permissionless network, after all.
00:44:03.354 - 00:44:13.994, Speaker B: So, yeah, it's not up to us what you build. We've just given you an example of what you can build. So, yeah, we're very excited to see how the community takes that and moves it forward.
00:44:14.192 - 00:44:21.706, Speaker A: Fantastic. And if people listening want to join the community or just learn more, where does the community live? Do you guys have a discord? A telegram?
00:44:21.818 - 00:44:25.966, Speaker B: Yeah, we've got a discord. We can add that to the comments or.
00:44:26.068 - 00:44:35.750, Speaker A: Yep, yeah, I'll add that into the show notes for sure. Awesome. Well, guys, this has been a fantastic exploration into aztec. So, Zach and Joe, thank you for joining me on bankless meet the nation.
00:44:36.170 - 00:44:38.226, Speaker C: Thanks for having us on. It's been a pleasure.
00:44:38.418 - 00:44:39.810, Speaker B: Yeah, bye.
