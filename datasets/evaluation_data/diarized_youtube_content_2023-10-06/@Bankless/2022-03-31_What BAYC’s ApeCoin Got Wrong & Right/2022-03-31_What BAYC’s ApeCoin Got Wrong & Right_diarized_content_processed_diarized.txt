00:00:00.090 - 00:00:01.118, Speaker UNK: Board apes did it wrong.
00:00:01.204 - 00:00:01.566, Speaker A: But they.
00:00:01.588 - 00:00:02.446, Speaker UNK: Can afford to do.
00:00:02.468 - 00:00:20.094, Speaker A: It wrong. I do think they did it wrong. I did expect that this would work for them, but I think it works because they are them. The other thing is, they also know they are them. This isn't news. They know their position in the world, so they could do this. I think anyone that copies this will tank their project.
00:00:20.094 - 00:00:58.380, Speaker A: Because you cannot launch without utility any old project, unless you are literally the 5 billion valuation leader who can have the amazing execution to be on every major exchange. At the same time, if you don't have utility, your token is just going to tank, because why are people buying it? And we see this all the time. Projects are launching without utility and my main worry is that the last six months people have copied board apes and they're going to do it now and tank what potentially could be a good project and they'll be stuck with this token. Once you launch a token, it's there. You can't get rid of it, you can't just blow. Sorry guys, we hyped you up about this token and now we're not going to use it.
