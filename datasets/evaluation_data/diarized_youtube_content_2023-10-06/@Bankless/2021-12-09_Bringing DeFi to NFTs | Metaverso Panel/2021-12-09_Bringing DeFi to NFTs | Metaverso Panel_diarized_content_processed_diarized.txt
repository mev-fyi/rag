00:00:06.970 - 00:00:23.130, Speaker A: Hey, guys, welcome to another state of the nation. This is an edition where we talk about bringing nfts to DeFi. This is a special edition as well, because it's on site, on premise at a conference. You're going to get the full conference experience in this episode. What are we talking about today, David?
00:00:23.290 - 00:00:45.642, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a live episode that we recorded at the Metaverseo conference about bringing nfts to DeFi. Bringing DeFi to nfts. What happens when these worlds collide? And I started off this panel with just a very quick introduction. There's only two types of tokens out in the world. There's non fungible tokens and there's fungible tokens. That's the whole entire category. True in real life, too, by the way.
00:00:45.642 - 00:00:47.242, Speaker B: Yeah, it's also true in real life.
00:00:47.376 - 00:00:49.222, Speaker A: Either fungible or non fungible.
00:00:49.366 - 00:01:19.906, Speaker B: That's the only categories. But then also there's the intersection of these things, where the lines can start to blur and cool new things can be built out of that. So this is a 35 minutes panel that we recorded with four guests from around the cryptosphere. And those guests are Andy 852. You guys might remember him from a couple of NFT shows that we've had. He is the founder of Fractional. There's Ben lackoff from charge particles, Laura Haramio from Upshot, and Sam Cassat from Neptune Dow.
00:01:19.906 - 00:01:28.054, Speaker B: So those are the panelists. And we just talked all about the cool stuff that happens when you intersect ERC 20 and ERC 721.
00:01:28.172 - 00:02:02.318, Speaker A: Guys, this is going to be a double level up for you today, because it's not only a level up on nfts, it's also a level up on DeFi and this new thing, including where they both intersect. So it's a good opportunity to learn a bit more about liquidity into nfts. Number one. The second is, how do you generate NFT communities using Defi? You fractionalize nfts. What does that look like? How does that guide in your investment decisions? And also, I think you guys are going to get into the one thing that all nfts depend on, and that is oracles. So a lot to unpack here. Guys, before we go too much further, want to let you know about Metamask.
00:02:02.318 - 00:02:27.510, Speaker A: Metamask is sponsoring this message. They want us to let you know that they are working hard on hardware support. Okay. Metamask plus ledger. That's a combo I often use whenever I am using web three. Metamask, of course, is a fantastic web three and crypto wallet and they are improving integration with the ledger. Also, metamask on the lattice wallet has really been amped up and actually newly released.
00:02:27.510 - 00:03:06.610, Speaker A: Also, the keystone wallet, if you're using a trezor, if you're using a latice, if you're using a ledger. This is the way to get into crypto while using protection. You need that protection, the hardware protection that comes with owning custody of your own key, not having private keys inside of a browser. So, Metamask plus hardware wallets, a fantastic team up. And I would just encourage you, you probably have metamask if you don't go download metamask. If you already have metamask, then connect your hardware wallet to it and try the experience out again. There's been some bumps along the way with Ledger and Metamask support that some of you guys have experienced.
00:03:06.610 - 00:03:26.366, Speaker A: They are working to improve that, and I think the latest firmware updates on the ledger have improved that to a great degree. So check that out. We'll include a link in the show notes. David. We're going to talk about the panel itself and the content of the panel. But before we do, I want just a taste of the conference. Give me the conference experience, okay.
00:03:26.366 - 00:03:30.974, Speaker A: Because here I am in my office all the time. I never come out of my office. Right. I don't go.
00:03:31.012 - 00:03:32.080, Speaker B: Not sure it's possible.
00:03:32.930 - 00:03:47.186, Speaker A: Well, we don't know that for sure. But one day, you and I will meet at a conference in real life. One day soon, I promise. But until that time, for people who don't have the opportunity and the time to go to a conference, what was the Metaversal conference like?
00:03:47.368 - 00:04:20.074, Speaker B: Yeah, the Metaversal conference was a one day conference, which I think is the first one day conference I've been to in a really long time. And I think everyone really appreciated that, because this is also coming on the heels of Art Basel, which was a very long week in Miami, which was. Everyone was talking about how draining it was. But art Basel is something that happens every single year. I'm just learning about this because I didn't know about it. Big, big art, just like decentralized convention of sorts. There's many different venues and events just doing art stuff in Miami.
00:04:20.074 - 00:04:28.126, Speaker B: And this year, it was the running joke that it's actually called Crypto Basil now, because all the NFTs have taken over art Basel. So everyone was in Miami?
00:04:28.158 - 00:04:46.262, Speaker A: Yep. So there's two conferences, right? There's one. You went to two conferences in the space of, like, the last seven days or so. One was Art Basel in Miami. And the other is Metaverso in Puerto Rico. The panel we have upcoming is from Metaverso. But Art Basel, you're saying this was an art conference before nfts, right?
00:04:46.316 - 00:04:46.754, Speaker B: Totally.
00:04:46.802 - 00:04:51.754, Speaker A: Okay. And the NFT people are now, like invading it. So what is the feeling there?
00:04:51.872 - 00:05:23.310, Speaker B: Yeah, so like I said, there is the one canonical art basel at the Miami convention center on Miami beach. And even that had NFT stuff in it as well, but not too much. All the other events just like different, just installations. There was a big installation on a beach that people would go see, and there's this one big piece of art there. And people would hop around all these different venues and events going to all. Just checking out all the art. And all of them were like NFT had some sort of nfts about them somehow, somewhere.
00:05:23.310 - 00:05:52.480, Speaker B: And the industry is in the art industry, not the NFT industry is in some sort of. In a state of very much immaturity trying to figure out how to actually display nfts. There's a lot of just kind of like amateurish NFT displays where you had vertical nfts being displayed on horizontal screens. So there are big black bars. There were tvs just on tv stands, on tables rather than as a frame on a wall.
00:05:53.330 - 00:05:55.006, Speaker A: First year, though, it's going to get better.
00:05:55.108 - 00:06:21.030, Speaker B: First year. Yeah. Can't really knock them too hard because this is brand new. It's just happened. But there's much to be desired with in real life NFT displays. Right? Like how do we actually show these things? Somebody that I saw do it really well had nfts projected up on a big, big wall. So this artist, this is Nate Moeller, who's the artist that I bought my nfts from forever ago.
00:06:21.030 - 00:06:45.066, Speaker B: He was actually displaying those nfts, two big projectors that were synced up. So it just looked like one big thing. And he had it blown up. It looked like, I think it was like 50ft wide by 25ft tall on this massive wall. And so that was really well done. But the art industry is trying to figure out how to come to terms with appropriately displaying this very new format of digital art with nfts.
00:06:45.178 - 00:07:09.094, Speaker A: Are they cool with it? So, you know, in our podcast with Kevin Rose, he actually used the know trade and I'm going to continue using. So, like, what does the trad art world think of this new NFT thing? Is there some resistance or is there a warm embrace? Like, hey, welcome to the family. This has injected some new energy into the art scene. What's the feeling from Art Basil, I.
00:07:09.132 - 00:07:35.150, Speaker B: Think the art collectors, I don't think, are too different from the typical distribution of crypto skeptics to non skeptics. They're not really any different. Like some people like crypto, some people don't. I don't think the art collectors are any meaningfully different than the average person that you would get. Again, some people think it's the future. Some people are totally skeptical. The artists love nfts because specifically, it's empowering.
00:07:35.150 - 00:08:01.026, Speaker B: Very much so. And it's a new cohort of artists that are now able to play in art Basel because of nfts. So it's not really the trad artists. It's a new set of artists that have come into the fold specifically because of nfts. And then there are specifically events being spun up that are just trying to be conducive to that type of art. Kind of the very, very experimental, very much on the fringe digital art that wouldn't have really had an opportunity elsewhere.
00:08:01.138 - 00:08:27.914, Speaker A: Do you know what's so wild? I feel like this is a microcosm of what's happening in every single industry, right? So you get, like, trad art, and then you have this Nft thing. The crypto thing is kind of invading trad art a little bit. And I mean that in a good way, injecting new energy, creating this new medium. But it's not just art. It's like every industry, okay? This is happening in finance. This is happening in entertainment, Hollywood, the movie industry. It's now like nfTs.
00:08:27.914 - 00:09:00.330, Speaker A: This is happening in gaming. So I don't know how many conferences and conventions you intend to go to, David, but you could go to them every week, all year round, in all of the different industries, and have crypto, NFTs Defi represented in some way or another. It's just really invading every single aspect of industry that's going on. We haven't even talked about music. Right. I'm sure there's music conferences and festivals. NFTs are going to have a huge, prominent display.
00:09:00.670 - 00:09:34.370, Speaker B: It was also interesting to see some of the platforms having just cubicles or just, like, sections in these art venues. Super rare had, like, just, I think they had something like ten tvs up on a wall. And when I say tvs, these are actually good, like, frames that are meant for displaying art. And so super Rare has their own little section of this art display mixed with trad art. And then super rare is also debuting. Of course, they don't make art, they host art. So they were again hosting art, but this time in real life rather than on their website.
00:09:34.370 - 00:10:05.902, Speaker B: So they had actual artists that were also with them in the booths having their art displayed. And so it was kind of cool. It was like the real website of super rare just being manifested in this section of the art show. In real life, I thought that was kind of cool. Hash masks were also there at the same of there was one venue that just looked like in real life, opensea. It was kind of funny. It's like, oh yeah, if Opensea came and actually just had an in real life installation, this is what it would look like.
00:10:05.956 - 00:10:25.778, Speaker A: All right, so tell me a little bit. That was the art Basel conference experience. Tell us a little bit about Metaverso for people who couldn't attend. So how did that contrast how it was different? I know this is hosted by somebody who's on bank list previously, G Money. He's on a layer zero podcast. So what was different about this was.
00:10:25.944 - 00:10:41.194, Speaker B: A lot of people here were at Art Basel and they had just hopped over from Miami to Puerto Rico, but this cohort of people were a lot closer to the core of what I would call crypto. These are all the people that get it and know that everyone else around.
00:10:41.232 - 00:10:48.780, Speaker A: Them, also the crypto natives, the NFTs. There, there was no trad art scene at the Metaverse conference then.
00:10:49.230 - 00:11:20.486, Speaker B: Yes, correct. Yeah. So it was all digital displays showing NFTs that all the NFT collectors love serotonin and mojito, which are a marketing and NFT advisory company. They were also helping set this up. And that's Amanda Cassat and a few other also like crypto natives that have been with consensus for forever and now are doing their own thing. So, yeah, it's just a bunch of crypto natives and then all the sponsors that you would expect as well. And again, it was just a one day thing.
00:11:20.486 - 00:11:29.954, Speaker B: And they did a very smart job of starting the conference at eleven rather than something crazy like eight. So people could just warm up their day and then get to the conference.
00:11:30.002 - 00:11:31.186, Speaker C: Oh, that's better.
00:11:31.308 - 00:12:00.718, Speaker B: Yeah, it was just one stage with about 200 chairs, about 400 people there. Some people were inside, outside, and just a great, fantastic list of just topics and conversations. And what I really appreciated about it was how concentrated it was. It was like everyone could focus their energies just on one day. And because all of the good stuff was happening on that one day, everyone felt FOMo about not watching a panel. So the panels were decently well attended.
00:12:00.814 - 00:12:07.602, Speaker A: So everyone was together, people weren't skipping panels, and it was only like 400 people or so. So it was fairly small and intimate.
00:12:07.746 - 00:12:08.758, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah.
00:12:08.844 - 00:12:09.334, Speaker C: That's awesome.
00:12:09.372 - 00:12:29.100, Speaker B: Just did a really good job. G money. He's pseudo anonymous, so if you follow him on Twitter, he always has his ape as his VR filter. But in real life, no, there's no VR filter in real life, but he still goes by g money. So if you ever meet g money in real life, he'll shake your hand and like, oh yeah, I'm g money. But he still doesn't tell you his name.
00:12:29.470 - 00:12:35.310, Speaker A: That's hilarious. That's great. So were there any takeaways from you from Metaversal conference?
00:12:35.890 - 00:13:15.018, Speaker B: My takeaways is that Puerto Rico is really, really cool. Everyone really likes to be in Puerto Rico. It's a great spot to host a conference, even if it's just a one day much. It made a ton of sense to host it right in this present moment because it was right after our basel, half of the industry was already like only two and a half hours away, and it was everyone who cares deeply about NFTs for all the right reasons. There was a charity auction as well, so NFTs were being auctioned off to go to charities support Puerto Rico infrastructure, which is still needed in the wake of the hurricanes that happened last year. And it was overall just a fantastic event.
00:13:15.104 - 00:13:35.954, Speaker A: So tell me this, David. What do you get out of conferences that you don't get out of in person? Conferences that you don't get from all of the Zoom meetings and all of know YouTube and podcasts that people consume in the Twitter back and forth banter and the discord servers? What's different? Make the pitch for going to a conference. Why is it important?
00:13:36.152 - 00:14:06.330, Speaker B: Yes. Well, first off, some people that are really cool and interesting just aren't there. They're not on Twitter, they're not on the Zoom meetings. Right. So it's really just a matter of having surface area to a lot of people all at once. You can go and meet five people inside of 30 minutes, and the probability of one or two of those people having long term relationships is pretty damn good. There is no replacing real life, as much as we all want to live in the metaverse, just seeing faces.
00:14:06.330 - 00:14:31.938, Speaker B: And for those that are on crypto Twitter, like me and Ryan, degenerate all the time. Meeting someone in real life actually does impact how I read tweets when it's coming from somebody that I know. And this is true for emails and for podcasts. Once you meet the person, you just get a little bit more introspection as to what they are actually thinking. About when they write stuff and show stuff.
00:14:32.024 - 00:14:42.114, Speaker A: So it's important for community cohesion, and you're actually able to form a different type of connection in person versus all of the digital mediums that we totally, totally.
00:14:42.162 - 00:15:08.746, Speaker B: And ideas can be shared just a lot faster, just communication just a lot more lubricated. I don't know if you watched the state of the nation. I did with Robbie in real life at NFT NYC. But having Robbie right next to me, the conversation was really fast, and it moved really quickly because I could look to him, he could look at me. There was body language, and we forget about these things, definitely on Twitter and even on Zoom, you kind of don't really get that you and I, we don't have that problem because we've been on Zoom.
00:15:08.858 - 00:15:12.894, Speaker A: Well, I don't know. How good could it be if we were doing this person?
00:15:13.012 - 00:15:13.826, Speaker B: What a question.
00:15:13.928 - 00:15:20.382, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, maybe we'd be number one in the podcast charts rather than number four in the Apple investing category.
00:15:20.526 - 00:15:42.546, Speaker B: I don't know. Yeah, everything just happens faster. And so for people like me that really also have just, like, fantastic, enriching social experiences from these events, just more socialization per second. And so there's just more alpha. There's more. People can just say things that they're interested in at a higher ticket.
00:15:42.578 - 00:15:42.994, Speaker D: Go figure.
00:15:43.052 - 00:15:53.546, Speaker A: Opportunities. More alpha, better connections. Guys, that is your pitch. And I feel like that pitch is coming from David to me of why I should attend a conference in 2022. But we're coming at this is why.
00:15:53.568 - 00:15:57.326, Speaker B: Ryan, he's like, I get all the.
00:15:57.348 - 00:16:22.054, Speaker A: Benefit because David just does all of this. But, yeah, absolutely, guys. So if you're looking at conference 2022 schedule, there's a lot of great crypto conferences coming up. So budget some time, plan some time to meet the people that you see in the digital world in real life. It's definitely worth it. And David, next year is the year you and I will meet in real life at one of these conferences at some point or another. But.
00:16:22.054 - 00:16:38.490, Speaker A: Okay, let's talk about your panel now, because we got to the point. We're going to intro this. This is really cool. So the combo of defi plus nfts equals magic. I guess that's what you're talking about on the panel. So why should folks stay tuned to this panel? What are you guys talking about?
00:16:38.640 - 00:17:20.630, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a number of quick conversations that we had, and really, the format of this is just. I proposed a question, posed a topic, and just let the panelists take it down the line. Each one had their opportunity to share. Sometimes they built off of each other, but sometimes they just gave their thoughts. There are really important conversations with, for example, fidenzas. Very highly valued artblock NFTs with relatively low volume, like weeks can go by without a Fidenza sale. And so as collateral in DFI, or integrating ERC 721s into applications, if you want to use the capital that's locked inside of a fidenza, you need to have a secure and accurate price feed that the market can rely on.
00:17:20.630 - 00:18:05.720, Speaker B: And so how do you get a price feed for something that has one sale per week? And perhaps it's a floor? How does that even actually relate to a rare Fidenza rather than a floor fidenza? So solving that problem is hard, but definitely possible. If you want to skip to the end and just come to the conclusion, the answer is, there is no good way to do this. You have to do all of them and then combine them, which is a problem in of itself. The other really important thing I think is really cool about nfTs, that we're definitely watching it happen right now, but I think it really could supercharge people that really want to lean into this, is that a fractionalized NfT can make a community. And we're already seeing this with pleaserdao pleaser dow. They bought the OG doge meme for $2.4 million.
00:18:05.720 - 00:18:30.346, Speaker B: And it's the meme of the Internet. James from pleaserdal likes to say, it's the Mona Lisa of the Internet. It's the doge. It is the Internet's meme. And so there's only one of those, and pleaserdal owns it, but it's the Internet's meme. And so they have used fractional to fractionalize it into the dog currency. So the dog token is backed by the doge NFT, and now everyone can have a share of the doge.
00:18:30.346 - 00:18:37.422, Speaker B: And now there's a fantastic discord and dow spun up around the dog token because it's a part of the doge NFT.
00:18:37.486 - 00:18:53.990, Speaker A: Well, what's super interesting about that is just like, economically, we're talking about value creation. So they bought the doge NFT for 2.5 million, is that we said somewhere in that ballpark. Right. Okay. Then they tokenized it, fractionalized it, and the dog token is worth, I'm just looking at coin gecko 50 million. Right?
00:18:54.060 - 00:18:54.534, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:54.652 - 00:19:04.890, Speaker A: So it's like, that's a 20 x in terms of increased value creation. Right. And people might debate, is this a meme token? Is this real value.
00:19:04.960 - 00:19:06.406, Speaker B: Definitely a meme token.
00:19:06.598 - 00:19:47.400, Speaker A: But I mean, you can measure the value that was created from the defi markets. So I haven't watched this panel, David. I'm really excited to dig into it because what's cool about NFTs is, of course, when paired with defi, they inherit all of defi's superpowers. All right, traditional art doesn't get any of this, which is why I'm kind of bearish traditional art relative to NFTs in the same way I'm bearish gold relative to crypto assets like Ethan bitcoin. Right. Because there's so much more you can do with it, and it's just going to give all of these NFTs superpowers. David, before we get into this, is there anything else you want to mention?
00:19:48.010 - 00:20:25.054, Speaker B: Yeah, so kind of in the same vein as fractionalizing the doge NFT, pleaserdao is also launching free Ross dao, freerostdao.com. So definitely check that out. It's the constitution dao. But instead of buying the constitution, they're buying Ross Ulbrich's nfts that he's issuing from jail, the money that is going to free Ross Dao to purchase his nfts. The money that the purchase will go to is to a combination of actually trying to free Ross and then also donating to funds that help loved ones visit their other loved ones in jail. And so, freerouddos.com, it's again kind of the same thing as a fractionalized doge.
00:20:25.054 - 00:20:48.438, Speaker B: But instead of pleaserdao buying this NFT and then fractionalizing it, they are spinning up the dow and just donating their capital into the dao. And so this is again constitutiondao for freerostdao.com. If you're interested in helping Ross get free, maybe you are interested in taking part in the fractionalization of the Ross Ulbricht NFT. If free Ross Dao buys it from Ross.
00:20:48.614 - 00:21:08.914, Speaker A: The experiments are getting weirder, but the experiments are also getting better. So stay tuned to this panel, guys. You will find out what is next with the combination of nfts and defi from the following experts. We want to get right to the content. So we're just doing a quick sponsor rundown for you. These are the sponsors that made this episode possible. Go check them out.
00:21:08.914 - 00:21:18.020, Speaker A: Fantastic. Sponsors on bankless all of the time. Uniswap apply for a grant. Uniswap dao Ave get a loan without a bank, the bankless way.
00:21:18.550 - 00:21:33.462, Speaker B: We also have lido where you can stake your eth and get st eth in return, which accrues more etH, because that's how staking works. And of course, we have Gemini, which is the exchange that I recently bought the dip on. And that buy feels great. So buy your dips on Gemini.
00:21:33.606 - 00:21:37.210, Speaker A: Thanks to the sponsors that made this episode possible. You guys rock.
00:21:38.350 - 00:22:03.140, Speaker D: All right, thanks, everyone, for being here. This is actually the first ever live podcast, so that's pretty exciting. And of course, recap. This is about the intersection of NFPs and D five. And to really get that started, I just kind of want to put this frame into people's minds as they think about this, really. There's only two types of tokens on Ethereum. There's Ert 20, and then there's eRt type 21.
00:22:03.140 - 00:22:15.414, Speaker D: There's more than that. That's really just the gist of it. And that's what you get there. You got ert twenty s, the fungible tokens, which are DFI, and then you have the non fungible tokens, which are NFD. And so when you put those things.
00:22:15.452 - 00:22:17.366, Speaker E: Together, that's the whole thing.
00:22:17.468 - 00:22:37.040, Speaker D: And so what happens when we talk about the intersection of those two types of token standards? And that is what we will be unpacking today on this panel. So I want to introduce all of our panelists. If you guys want to give your introduction and elevator pitch as to what you do and your company, we will start with Andy first.
00:22:37.570 - 00:22:38.814, Speaker C: Hi, thanks for having me.
00:22:38.852 - 00:22:52.610, Speaker F: I'm Andy. I co founded Fractional, which does NFT fractionalization. Very underdose of the name, but yeah, I've been working in crypto and Defi for a long time. Super excited to be here. Awesome.
00:22:52.680 - 00:23:05.960, Speaker E: Hi, my name is Laura Haramino. I'm the lead product designer at Upshot. We do real time on chain and NFT appraisals using peer prediction and machine learning and accurate price prediction once and for all.
00:23:07.050 - 00:23:21.050, Speaker G: Hey, guys, it's been lingon. Simon Mayer, co founder, business lead at charge particles. So we are an NFT protocol that enables you to get a smart wallet into your NFT and links it to other assets.
00:23:22.030 - 00:23:53.654, Speaker C: Hi, my name is Dan Kappett. I've been around for a long time. A lot of you know me, probably as chief strategy officer of consensus, where I funded a lot of stuff like truffle, like metamask, front mess at the beginning. Fast forward a few years now, I'm doing a number of things. The founder of a company called Alive, we in contract with the Nettune though, which I upgrade. We provide liquidity to defi applications sometimes, and a bunch of other stuff I'll be talking about soon.
00:23:53.772 - 00:24:18.270, Speaker D: All right, let's go ahead and dive right into this. So let's get really grounded here. We have default. That thing is pretty damn robust. NFTs are still pretty new, but also extremely big. And the cool thing about crypto is it goes in all directions at once. And it really seems to be that the intersection of Defi and NFTs is kind of like one of the last areas that as an industry we really haven't tapped into yet.
00:24:18.270 - 00:24:34.466, Speaker D: So when we open up the door and look behind the intersection of defi nfts, how big is this? Why does this matter? Is there something actually here? Like, let's talk about the potential of what happens when we actually combine these things. Very broad, open ending question. And once again, Andy, start with you.
00:24:34.648 - 00:24:35.570, Speaker C: All right. Yeah.
00:24:35.640 - 00:24:41.366, Speaker F: I think what's interesting here is there's a lot of real world assets that.
00:24:41.388 - 00:24:43.638, Speaker C: We do kind of defi stuff in.
00:24:43.644 - 00:24:47.318, Speaker F: The real world with digging out of a mortgage on your house or different things like that.
00:24:47.404 - 00:24:48.726, Speaker D: And you can map all of that.
00:24:48.748 - 00:25:06.586, Speaker F: Really easily to NFTs and defi with NFTs. But what's really exciting is it kind of unlocks this world where you can do that with any asset in the entire world. And so, not to sound too bullish or anything, but it's kind of like the addressable market is every asset in the entire world that we're doing defi.
00:25:06.618 - 00:25:08.474, Speaker C: With, which I think is really exciting.
00:25:08.522 - 00:25:12.510, Speaker F: It's just like unlocking opportunities for lots of new people and new users.
00:25:14.770 - 00:26:03.870, Speaker E: To build out that. The potential to tokenize literally anything in the world is astonishing for implications of NMT. The biggest issue right now is how illiquid these things are. The fact that we don't have any accurate price prediction, the fact that it doesn't matter if I move my house on open space, if I don't have accurate price prediction for that, there's no way that I can leverage it against anything. Especially like what we're working towards. At upshot, we kind of marketed us as the intersection of NFTs and D five because we're building that foundational element, which is that accurate, real time updating every ten minutes price feed on literally every NFT. Suddenly things like, I don't know, synthetics become possible.
00:26:03.870 - 00:26:20.280, Speaker E: Take like underwriting, underwriting your debt with nfts become possible with accurate price prediction, price feed. So I'm extremely, extremely bullish on this new asset class and this new world. But that is the foundational element that's missing. And it's around the.
00:26:23.850 - 00:27:01.438, Speaker G: Mean. A lot of great points, but I think segmenting these things into this is the NFT world and this is the DeFi world. Even within NFTs themselves, defi itself, there's so many subcategories and sub sections of each of those. So eventually all of these things kind of meld into one big crypto space. The metaverse is surrounded by NFTs everywhere. And those NFTs will have defi access assets. You will have structured products that are containerized within an NFT.
00:27:01.438 - 00:27:17.430, Speaker G: And it just makes sense because that whole thing. So we'll continue to see melding the intersection of all of these in new and innovative ways. And we're just really beginning to scratch the surface of both of these together, both individually.
00:27:19.150 - 00:28:05.810, Speaker C: Agree? Yeah, I think at a conference like this, a lot of what we think about as NFTs are kind of like punks and apes and profile pictures and things like that. But I think to take a step back, nft just means non fungible token, right? It's a thing that's a unique digital object instead of a bunch of objects like a stock or something, it's a unique thing, right? And that can represent almost anything. We're starting to see experiments in that. Some people have tried it with real property. It's a little bit hard to link it to real property like houses, but you can imagine how something like the title to a house could be an NFT. It can also be linked to access, right? So uniswap, v. Three, the thing that represents your liquidity that you provided to the uniswap exchange is an NFT.
00:28:05.810 - 00:28:42.754, Speaker C: Some poor gentleman accidentally stole it because he thought it was a present that he got from uniswap. But if you think about it like that, all we know, we have this object, and that object can represent almost anything, right? You could lock other objects inside of it. You can use it like a derivative where a collection of other entities or collection of other fungible assets is linked to that, and that thing can be traded. And you can almost imagine the hierarchical structures that exist in normal finance. We can do that times 1000 algorithmically, because we have these two structures together. Just something for fungible, something for non fungible. So there's a ton of intersection to it.
00:28:42.754 - 00:29:01.160, Speaker C: I think there's a lot farther we have to go in the field because frankly, on like Ethereum, l one gas is too expensive to move around a thing that costs a dollar or even $10 or whatever. Right, I'll stop there. But we have fractionalization, lending, et cetera. There's a lot of applications, but we're early.
00:29:01.930 - 00:29:17.274, Speaker D: So for this next question, I actually want Andy to go last. So, Sam, I'm going to start with you. NFDs and d five. Isn't it just devil's advocate question? Isn't it just as simple as putting an ERC 20 token inside of a contract that fits out? An ERC 20 token?
00:29:17.322 - 00:29:18.430, Speaker E: Isn't that the whole story?
00:29:18.500 - 00:29:20.160, Speaker D: Is this really that big of a deal?
00:29:23.010 - 00:29:24.490, Speaker E: Or is there more time?
00:29:24.580 - 00:29:33.570, Speaker D: Like, what other things are involved with this intersection of D five of entities? Why is it more than just fractionalizing? ERC 721 token.
00:29:33.990 - 00:29:38.986, Speaker C: Right, I agree. I think there are lots of things that are not just fractionalizing.
00:29:39.038 - 00:29:39.254, Speaker G: Right.
00:29:39.292 - 00:30:14.414, Speaker C: So there's something, for instance, using it as collateral, there's also kind of gradations, right? We say 721 and actually there's 1155, which is sort of somewhere in between where there's a series of cards. Imagine one of the biggest applications of Defi NFTs has been yay, metaverse, right? And so the metaverse out where we are now in the metaverse, right. You can imagine an entire multitrillion dollar economy, as big as the existing economy of things that are like semi fungible and that you might want to use as representing their underlying financial reality. Right?
00:30:14.452 - 00:30:15.486, Speaker G: I may want to lend against them.
00:30:15.508 - 00:30:29.960, Speaker C: I want to sell them in a series. I might want to do lots of things that look like normal financial activity. And so, no, I don't think it's just sticking in the Rt 20 instead of nothing else. They're logically separate. In fact, they're conditions between.
00:30:31.850 - 00:31:12.370, Speaker G: Yeah. So financialization, fractionalization, using as collateral, you can also permission, like in a trustless way, lend your NFT. But yeah, the ability to have an NFT hold other assets, then use that basket, use that basket as a trust account and transfer it to somebody. And you have multiple of these baskets, kind of as sub accounts within your wallet, your address. This opens up a lot of opportunities.
00:31:14.950 - 00:31:57.940, Speaker E: And if you take it down to the most basic things you could possibly do right now, creating synthetic existing nfts is something that's around the corner as well. So suddenly you don't have to necessarily own this entire NFT to benefit from its valuation in the market. You'd be able to hold a kind of arbitrary position in any NFT that you see value in over time. And I recommend wage on it access to all of these different beautiful, exotic mechanisms through synthetics is also going to be like a beautiful sort of new horizon and bring accessibility to the space as well, which is one of the biggest lagging points right now.
00:31:58.710 - 00:32:14.498, Speaker F: Yeah, I think too, something that is interesting when you think about using DFI with nfts is not to bud my own bags in my company, but I don't think everyone always wants to fractionalize every NFT to use it in d five. Just because you fractionalize an NFT doesn't.
00:32:14.514 - 00:32:15.794, Speaker D: Mean it's immediately liquid.
00:32:15.842 - 00:32:43.118, Speaker F: Doesn't mean that there's $100 million liquidity on uniswap to use that as like a price oracle to do all these other things. And so I think that we really need just new creators and builders in the space thinking about unique and novel ways to kind of port some of the things that we've done in defi into an NFT world where lending with nfts and borrowing against your NFT probably does not look the same. It's not just fractionalize your NFT and borrow fractions. It doesn't really make sense.
00:32:43.284 - 00:32:45.182, Speaker C: Spend a long time trying to map that all out.
00:32:45.236 - 00:33:07.640, Speaker F: But maybe you borrow against your NFT and if you get liquidated, then it's fractionalized and you pay off the liquidation fractions and you keep some fractions and you can start to build more interesting, more NFT centric defi stuff that I think is really where this all has to go to see significantly larger adoption and kind of like meet NFT collectors and users and buyers where they are.
00:33:08.090 - 00:33:44.420, Speaker G: Yeah, and I think it's important. I mean, mentioned a few times, but we are early and there are core infrastructural issues. It's very tough to do these things with a very small amount. And yeah, there's layers, another more cheaper layer, one perhaps, but it is early, so it's the early innings. There's regulatory uncertainty, so it's very difficult to just. This is the innovation sandbox, and we will go crazy and build these crazy things that we can dream up because there are these more archaic laws and things that we have to play with.
00:33:47.530 - 00:34:32.434, Speaker D: Let's talk about liquidity, because if there's one thing that DFI is really, really good at, it's liquidity. Uniswap v three, fantastically liquid on, just not exotic capital. And then things like compound and Aubay are just another form of liquidity on the other side of things. ERC 721 nfts are inherently illicit. That's the unique danger of these things is that the fewer the number of them are, the harder it is to have a market. So let's talk about how DeFi can actually aid the NFT side of Ethereum and broader crypto in accessing more and more liquidity, and what that can really do for bringing out the best of NFTs. Andy, why do nfts need liquidity so badly? How can defi help?
00:34:32.632 - 00:35:22.980, Speaker F: Yeah, so I think kind of going back to a lot of the defi stuff, most defi derivatives, to a certain extent, require liquidity to price things or liquidity things, do a million other different things. And what I'm excited about is thinking about potentially interesting ways to do that with order books and different ways to really be able to gauge interest and demand for each other. NFT and logical stuff like that. I don't think we totally know what it looks like yet. I don't think that it's as simple as just, oh, uniswap amm one for nfts. I think you can do that to a certain extent from NFTx or the different pools that are pulling together floor level pumps or different things like that. But I think we'll need to see some level of innovation on the order book and demand side of NFTs in general.
00:35:22.980 - 00:35:46.730, Speaker F: And it probably like, I know there's some interesting stuff. I know that zero x monster guy is working on something called pseudoswap and he's working on an NFT on top of that, and there's interesting stuff happening in that space. But I'm really excited to see that play out. And I think that you can kind of tie in a lot of things that we're all working on into helping type the multitude of models.
00:35:47.390 - 00:36:38.950, Speaker E: Yeah, it's really interesting. You bring up the order book situation, something that we're working on at upshot, just the alpha of all alphas. This doesn't leave here, or it does, I guess Mr. Bell explains it. But the foundation of these appraisals and having these accurate prices that we can all agree on because it's done on chain, it is like literally, I don't know, just decentralized appraisals, decentralized price points, undisputed. Suddenly those owner books have a price. Suddenly there is a world where you'd be able to go onto a marketplace, onto a platform, and sell your NFT for whatever the appraised price point is for this specific NFT, not listed at a floor price, not listed below floor price, and hope that someone buys.
00:36:38.950 - 00:37:04.800, Speaker E: Know that there are people out there that see the potential of these assets and go, whatever it is, whatever the appraised price list is, I want it. And for you to be able to buy that in return as well, to be able to see when something is listed below the appraised price and capture that moment. Right now we're just sort of guessing on a market. Guessing in a bubble, hopefully not a bubble, but it feels a little like a bubble without that sort of truth. So.
00:37:29.890 - 00:38:00.280, Speaker G: You know, like Andy said, you just do the uniswap for NFTs doesn't quite work like that. So we are, and people are experimenting and playing around. There are core structural issues like Francis that are difficult. But at the end of the day, it is a nascent market. There are inefficiencies in all nascent early markets and these things just kind of are arbitrarily come in, stay, because there's a lot more going on and that's just kind of part of it.
00:38:01.130 - 00:38:14.166, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. And I think just to go back again to the generality here, right. ERC 721 can be anything, can be a house, my shoe, whatever. It's like, what is an order book for my shoe?
00:38:14.278 - 00:38:15.786, Speaker E: Doesn't make sense, right?
00:38:15.968 - 00:39:11.238, Speaker C: There's going to be different idiosyncratic ways that you might want to sell or provide liquidity depending on what it is, right? And like different kinds of stuff have different amounts of liquidity. Apartments in New York have liquidity, kind of. But the interface of that, the order book of that MLS system and some people that are very nice and show it to you. The liquidity of a house here is also pretty good now, but some places it might not be liquidity where your profile picture NFT maybe not so much, but for instance, that's something, we talked to a lot of groups about it. Like I've got a really valuable punk or something. Like we went against it, right? So what does an order both look like for that thing? We basically need to recreate the financial system in a way that's programmatized and hopefully better, more efficient. But it's got to be completely idiosyncratic depending on what the asset is and how it behaves.
00:39:11.238 - 00:39:32.500, Speaker C: What about the metaverse? Right? What if I've got, there are 5000 of these shields in this game and there's only 20,000 people who might want one. I can imagine what that order might look like, right? So it's self discrimination. It's about the point of what I'm saying is try to think about it generally as like something that can represent any asset and then back into the answer.
00:39:33.750 - 00:40:21.838, Speaker D: So continuing on this conversation, how to value an NFT when it doesn't really behave in the same way as an ERC 20 token. And especially like some art blocks, for example, presenters, there can be weeks that go by before a sale happens, but those sales are still big sales, right? A presenter will still go for hundreds of e. And just because a week goes by without a sale happens doesn't mean that there isn't demand for these things. They can be plenty liquid, even with low sales. So that brings us to the conversation of how do we appraise these things, how do we value these things when there isn't like a uniswap market for these things constantly trading. And so Laura, I want to ask you this question, since this has to do with uptrack, I'll start with you. Let's talk about the combination of oracles and nfts rather than on screen markets with nfts.
00:40:21.838 - 00:40:31.720, Speaker D: How can we use alternative methods to discover the value of these nfts that can be turned into an oracle for the rest of defi to tap into in a secure view?
00:40:32.330 - 00:41:40.470, Speaker E: So the way that we've been going about it, using a new form of mechanism design called peer prediction, where you're essentially, you have the bunch of experts validate based on their buildings, right? If you own like 100 pumps, you probably the process of that answer a bunch of ab questions, essentially, which NFT is more valuable? Airbnb. All of those answers go through a correlation, like a new type of mechanism line that comes out with an honesty score for each appraiser and then pulls the value one way or another. So it isn't like one person saying that this is worth 300 ace and that's it. I'm an expert. It's like hundreds of thousands of people pulling that price one way or another and then using machine learning to automatically update that constantly. So you have this human element feeding into machine learning, feeding back to human element. The one piece that's missing, and I think that is going to be the game changer, is finding a way to track that community element and finding a way to track that utility component.
00:41:40.470 - 00:42:25.394, Speaker E: Because right now you can't necessarily fit utility into machine learning. And they say that's valuable, right? But there is a way to look at a community, look at a discord server, look at who's involved in a project, bring all these backers together and come to a conclusion they have. This is probably the beginning of. And then using pure prediction machine learning to pull that value to a price point and keep it going relative to each other, relative to the collection. So that's the way that we're going about it. It's also because it's an onchain protocol. I think that's another very important topic, that there should not be one governing human that says this is truth.
00:42:25.394 - 00:42:44.560, Speaker E: They should say, I think this is the truth. And you can figure out if you think this is truth as well, way more decentralized, way more for web three. But right now we're spinning out price predictions for the top 200 NFT collections every ten minutes. And I'm so excited to bring that to the world.
00:42:45.730 - 00:43:13.478, Speaker F: One of the things that I'm excited about is being able to combine that with a lot of other on chain stuff as well. Something that I think about a lot for fractional and like ways that we can basically help our users who are buying a particular fideza or something have a significantly more informed decision, or basically be able to even plug into automated things and say, once the appraisal on one shot is 10% higher than the current fractional price, I want to be.
00:43:13.484 - 00:43:15.786, Speaker C: A buyer up until 5% higher for.
00:43:15.808 - 00:43:31.982, Speaker F: Different things like that. And we've also been thinking a lot about how fractions can potentially help a lot more with price increasing. And there's a lot of challenges because even a relatively rare Fidenza, the entire valuation of it is still a couple of million dollars.
00:43:32.036 - 00:43:32.926, Speaker E: It's not like you're going to get.
00:43:32.948 - 00:44:18.670, Speaker F: Some insanely liquid market for this one individual piece. But what we've been thinking about a lot lately is potentially having ongoing auctions or percentages of it. And so you can then kind of imply what the price is and say like, okay, if we were to auction off 1% ownership agenda and someone's willing to pay one ethereum for it, this is probably worth around 100 ethereum. And if you do that on a long enough time horizon, based on you say, okay, over the ten days where 1% was auctioned in August, they went between one ethereum to two ethereum. So one and a half ethereum or something along the line, really excited to start experimenting more kind of in that side of things where as a protocol you have a lot more control over the supply and how people are buying and interacting.
00:44:21.490 - 00:45:11.998, Speaker G: I think it's important with the pricing aspect of nfts. We keep going back to this, but nfts are so broad, the utility value varies by person. So if I'm a gamer giving an in game item, NFT to me might have a lot more value to me versus a non gamer. Or if I metaverse real estate and I want to buy up a whole like that has a different value to me versus somebody who doesn't play in that. And then as we continue to add a layer in utility value, I can rent off my land plot in the metaverse, I can rent off this in game asset to somebody else. I can rent my PFP to somebody that wants to go to a pump only party. This changes the value of these things drastically for me.
00:45:11.998 - 00:45:54.540, Speaker G: I don't have a pump, but if I do, I know renting it, then that adds value to me a bit because I can monetize it, I can rent it out. But since somebody that owns a pump and doesn't want to rent it doesn't diminish the value because then the guy that rented it come to the party. So all of these additional utilities also impact pricing significantly because they haven't really fully thought out or will continue to play and think out. But looking at other more illiquid alternative asset markets like art or real estate, these all have varying levels of liquidity and pricing, even though a transaction happens more infrequently than public.
00:45:55.730 - 00:46:51.070, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, perfect liquidity and perfect price discovery would be different depending on what asset it is in the future where you have NFT and it's actually a roll up, 5000 other NFTs and 25 of them are priced by Moonies or rated by Moonies, and some of them are rated by Moonies 2050 or whatever. The next like, upshot is upshot evolved into stuff that is going to replace those dinosaurs like that. We're going to have so many different pricing mechanisms and hopefully we'll be on chain algorithmic and much more efficient. And we won't have things like 2008 happen because actually it's more transparent layers of these things. But yes, price discovery would be great. I think we need a whole bunch of effort in each particular asset class, how to do it standard than we have in normal.
00:46:52.930 - 00:47:23.900, Speaker D: I want to bring up the topic of community here, because I think if there's one thing that we've learned that's a universal truth with crypto, if it doesn't have a community, it's not going to make it. And one of the reasons, probably why punks made it through the bear market was that because Discord was a fun place to be in the bear market as a shared space of absorbing all the pain of down for two years. I want to talk about nfps and D five. How can that be a tool for community generation. How can that be a community tool?
00:47:25.070 - 00:47:30.518, Speaker F: Yeah, I think we've seen some really cool stuff recently with just random groups.
00:47:30.534 - 00:47:32.282, Speaker C: Of people raising funds to buy stuff.
00:47:32.416 - 00:48:18.794, Speaker F: Like Constitution Dow, and now we have the green loss Dow, which is really exciting. While raising funds to participate in a Dow isn't like explicitly defi, it starts to really walk into that whole territory. And I think in general, the ability for communities that are built around particular nfts or different groups also turn it into this monetary group where they're able to build their own micro economies and do all this stuff inside of their shared interest group is just really interesting and exciting. I think it has the potential also to help a lot of people who otherwise cannot do this in either country they live in or. Yeah, I feel like we're going to see a ton more of these just.
00:48:18.832 - 00:48:20.058, Speaker C: Random dows coming up by.
00:48:20.064 - 00:48:24.630, Speaker F: And so people defying their smaller communities.
00:48:24.710 - 00:48:33.070, Speaker D: And that shout out free rossdao.com constitution Dow is up for crossover NFC.
00:48:35.010 - 00:49:34.190, Speaker E: Thinking about the implications of what you can do with energy and community building, just to take it to the memes industry for a second, being able to track your fan base and their interactions with your burp, with your nfts, your music, with your concert all on chain, suddenly you have a way more personalized way of communicating with these fans, figuring out who they are, where they are, what they're doing that has so much value suddenly not only to every single output of a creator, but also value to that community and being a part of it and having these NFT passports suddenly that bring you into the world. At SmEv, we like to say that access is better than value. What world are you unlocking with these nfts? I've been throwing around the idea of starting an activist down for Puerto Rico and using NFTs as a way to initiate.
00:49:35.050 - 00:49:36.040, Speaker D: Yeah, right.
00:49:40.010 - 00:50:12.720, Speaker E: And then even like, honestly, just the NTO today. Wow, this thing kept going. The NMT is such a more accessible entry point for most people. It's such a beautiful way to rally people behind. The NFT can be a ticket, it can be art, it can be whatever it is, but it is a unifying, limited asset. And at the end of the day, that is essentially a community. We'll talk more about that later.
00:50:14.290 - 00:51:05.514, Speaker G: Yeah, definitely. Humans are social creatures and this kind of virtual world of medical that we're living in, it's nice to have this shared sense of community. We all have this EMP and that makes us unique. We're all hosting this token and that's what brings us together, or we have a group chat, send up its own structure and we're all part of this together. So I think web three in general, really much more distributed in all these unique, fun ways. But then, like NFT and D five, what we're doing is our protocols. You can take this NfT that you own and love, that's part of your community, your boarding, and then you can use it with p five plugging into the Aave protocols underneath, earning a little bit of yield.
00:51:05.514 - 00:51:26.440, Speaker G: All containers within your board ape. And then essentially maybe that interest equates to something within the discord. Because you stake so much a day into your board ape, you're never going to sell. You have so much money into your game, it gives you a little extra something. So the ability for these things to work together.
00:51:35.150 - 00:52:17.430, Speaker C: So I think something has happened that's pretty remarkable over the last few years, which is the merging of this concept of sociality and brand and financial assets. And I think it's a generational thing. And if you look at the way that teenagers behave versus the way that my parents generation behaves, for instance, financial interaction is a lot more like something that you care about online. Obviously, NFTs are an example. Look at GameStop and community around on Reddit. There's something democratizing happening and there's something that is sort of not going to make it. We need energy around this.
00:52:17.430 - 00:52:26.742, Speaker C: But brands are realizing this right now. Brands, the reason why brands are all over. They realize that if you're an asset.
00:52:26.806 - 00:52:29.034, Speaker F: Or you're a product or whatever, you.
00:52:29.072 - 00:53:05.320, Speaker C: Don'T have that social element to it. It wasn't possible before because we didn't have the social media to be the administrative player of that. You didn't have the ability to connect in that way. Maybe you go once a year at the shareholders meeting, your budy or whatever, but now you're going to every day, all day. How much do I care about this asset? I think as human minds evolve with phones and pens and the communities around them blur with what is a community and what's an asset, that's what we're seeing right now, increasingly important.
00:53:07.210 - 00:53:55.378, Speaker E: I got one last thing to say, especially for artists. I think something that's missing from this conversation is like how an artist can incentivize secondary market action through their NFT collection. I think every artist, like the OG Crystal collection, that first mint tiny little Geode, and then programmatically inside the smart contract, every time it resells, another piece of that crystal grows out of it. And suddenly those crystals become more and more valuable, and that four crystal is suddenly more and more valuable. And that encouraged resale. That David chain of people wanting to discover on the other side of that sale, that's something that does have to do with incentivized finance, incentivized sales, something that any artist can do. Get creative with your smart contract.
00:53:55.378 - 00:54:31.230, Speaker E: Contact the facility that you know, and use that creative, problem solving mind to play with it, because there's so much potential beyond just, like, minting the piece you made last year. This is a new playground. There are a lot of Djen D five bros here, but getting artists in here, getting musicians in here, and tackling that landscape, which is the contract itself, I think, is where we're going to see the next genesis of these incredible financial tools that are beyond us. Trying to retrofit NFTs into D five protocols and instead building it into contract itself. Go out there and send away the secretary.
00:54:46.970 - 00:55:20.100, Speaker D: So there's been a lot of use cases and a lot of potential that I think is a ton of fun here, and I think when we have too much fun. Regulator, what about the regulatory clarity, relapse, clarity holding back the intersection of NFT, fractionalization, or the SEC or is relevant to this conversation, and what perhaps we use as an industry helps promote industry go forward?
00:55:21.670 - 00:55:53.098, Speaker C: Well, tough questions. So I think what's relevant to answer that part of the question is there are two approaches that regulators need to have. There's either you take a bunch of laws that were written in the 1930s and try to apply it to what we're doing now, or, and sometimes that makes sense, actually, something clearly, or you look at the use of properties, what we're doing, there's always going to be.
00:55:53.104 - 00:55:54.618, Speaker F: A tension between those things, and the.
00:55:54.624 - 00:56:39.900, Speaker C: Definitions are shifting out, too. A pump seems like a piece of art. Pretty sure it should be created like a piece of art. In my opinion. Some regulators don't agree with that. I don't really understand why. But then there's something that may be an NFT, and then what do you do? So it's a blurry line, I think to the extent that regulators provide clarity, to the extent to which the United States or whatever jurisdiction we're talking about can excel in that domain, if you look at the history of consensus for ethereum, there's a reason why a lot of it was in jurisdictions that understood the technology.
00:56:39.900 - 00:56:53.940, Speaker C: Our regulatory bodies understand the technology and look at it closely, the extent to which your jurisdiction as a regulator is going to excel. So I hope that we do that.
00:56:55.190 - 00:57:44.510, Speaker G: Yeah, I would just give the broad, definitely not pretending to be a lawyer, but I guess I completely agree with all these are laws that were written in the 1930s, 1940s. I mean, dow with more than 100 members with no legal entities, it's a general partnership and over 100 people. It's a security company. These are like serious issues. And even though I'm a big fan, I don't believe that these make sense, but they do. And if they're real and AML and things like that, these are real issues. Even though I would urge innovators in the states, find a lawyer that you have to work with.
00:57:44.510 - 00:57:56.562, Speaker G: This is an evolving shift, regulatory unknown right now, but you can do things in a more structured way and shield.
00:57:56.626 - 00:57:57.766, Speaker F: Yourself a little bit.
00:57:57.868 - 00:58:19.580, Speaker G: But the key is if you're operating within some amount of risk, you don't want to take any risk like only been launching. But it is very.
00:58:29.070 - 00:58:53.320, Speaker E: Important. I agree that it's not trying to carry, but slowly but surely society is catching up. I think we're slowly figuring out what this is all about. We're extremely privileged to be in this room and that's something. People in regulation have no idea what's going on. They're like bitcoin. This is all some sort of bitcoin, isn't it? Absolutely not.
00:58:56.250 - 00:58:57.830, Speaker D: Listening to this podcast.
00:58:59.710 - 00:59:17.550, Speaker E: Educate your peers, because as much as we might like to keep the playground to ourselves, we can't do this in the shadows anymore. It's better to have people understand in their working on the regulations and all the necessities.
00:59:22.130 - 01:00:00.890, Speaker F: I think in general it's really hard and in general because there's so regularity on a lot of things, a lot of stuff NfT like conversations around you. And so coming out and every single one solves security. Maybe some of them are, some of them weren't. You don't really know, but you still don't know. And it's just a very frustrating thing. But I also understand the regulatory bodies.
01:00:05.330 - 01:00:06.538, Speaker D: Incredible ecommerce.
01:00:06.634 - 01:00:21.634, Speaker F: We can't expect them to be some weird new old game project that comes after them. Actually, you guys, that's good. It's going to take long time, a lot of work, definitely talk to lawyers. Super smart than I am.
01:00:21.832 - 01:00:24.420, Speaker G: But yeah, it will take long time.
01:00:26.810 - 01:00:42.266, Speaker D: All right, guys, last question. Think about something that you personally would love to use in the intersection of defi. You want to lend out your pump, you want to collateralize, but what use case could be built that is not.
01:00:42.288 - 01:00:43.994, Speaker E: Built yet that you are looking forward.
01:00:44.032 - 01:00:47.820, Speaker D: To that will actually improve your personal life real quick.
01:00:52.130 - 01:01:06.320, Speaker F: I really want to use a lending protocol like a maker gap style coin that is basically paying the floor price of particular profile picture project. You can basically borrow against that.
01:01:13.510 - 01:01:31.290, Speaker E: I want to make like a curated synthetic album. Choose every NFT in the space I think I'm going to make it and then make a synthetic based on that and give people ultimate access to the things. Bottom floor. Buying that for me is incredible.
01:01:33.470 - 01:01:53.380, Speaker G: I'd like to see somebody use charge markers to create a virtual geocaching assets in it. Whoever finds it first, just like some interest and you don't have sacrifice, get them to your property.
01:01:57.270 - 01:02:06.594, Speaker C: I would like to have a way to build essentially like a reach of the metaverse and have it be run.
01:02:06.632 - 01:02:08.660, Speaker G: By really awesome people.
01:02:12.650 - 01:02:16.150, Speaker D: Thank you guys so much for being on the panel. Appreciate.
