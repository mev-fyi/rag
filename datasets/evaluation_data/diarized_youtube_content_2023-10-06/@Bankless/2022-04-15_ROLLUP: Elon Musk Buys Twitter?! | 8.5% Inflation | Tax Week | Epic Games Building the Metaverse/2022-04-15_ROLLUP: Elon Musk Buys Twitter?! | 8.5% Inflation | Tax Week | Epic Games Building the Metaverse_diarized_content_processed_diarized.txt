00:00:00.410 - 00:00:09.162, Speaker A: Question for you, Ryan. Just like, just gut take. How do you feel about the market? Just general sentiment. No charts, no numbers. General sentiment.
00:00:09.226 - 00:00:10.362, Speaker B: Can I be honest for a minute?
00:00:10.426 - 00:00:11.134, Speaker A: Sure.
00:00:11.332 - 00:00:25.062, Speaker B: I'm feeling real good about the market. Yeah. Hey, bankless nation. Happy second week of April. We got a hot week for you. Really excited about what we're doing today. And David, what is this episode called? Tell him.
00:00:25.156 - 00:00:45.286, Speaker A: Oh, Ryan. It's the Friday bankless weekly roll up where we recap the entire week in crypto, which, like I say, ryan is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless through the gamut of the news. We pack it apart, we pull it apart, we distill it for you, digest it for you, and download the entire week of crypto all in one episode.
00:00:45.398 - 00:00:58.558, Speaker B: Some nice digestion for you, some pre chewed meat for you. Am I being gross? Hey, look. Welcome to the east coast. That was a subject change. How's the east coast time zone for you enjoying this?
00:00:58.724 - 00:01:13.934, Speaker A: It's been a little bit of a shock. All my west coast friends aren't up in the morning, so I want to get up and start shit posting in discord. And they're not awake yet. But then we get to start the weekly roll up a lot earlier. This is the earliest weekly roll up you've ever done, Ryan.
00:01:14.062 - 00:01:38.860, Speaker B: Yeah, it is. Yeah. I can't believe this is like the crack of dawn, I guess, in comparison. But I love being on the east coast because I feel like we get a jump start on all of the west coasters. Right. So by the time you've woken up, I'm already in work mode and I'm like, just although you do wake up really early, so you're pretty close, but it's nice. You get kind of a jump start on the day.
00:01:39.230 - 00:01:50.270, Speaker A: Yeah. What I've noticed about Brooklyn is like, coffee shops don't open until like 730 or eight. And so I go out in the morning and I'm waiting for the coffee store to open. This is ridiculous.
00:01:51.410 - 00:02:01.266, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm not sure why that's going on, but anyway, guys, we got a hot week for you on the recap. We're going to get it back to crypto topics of the week. First of all, inflation. 8.5%.
00:02:01.368 - 00:02:02.014, Speaker A: WTF?
00:02:02.062 - 00:02:04.462, Speaker B: This is the highest, like in 40 years or something, David.
00:02:04.526 - 00:02:08.094, Speaker A: And when it's reported at 8.5%, you know, it's a little higher than that, Ryan.
00:02:08.142 - 00:02:25.290, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. You know, it's double digits already. We're going to talk about that. Also, Elon Musk, last week we told you he was going to be on Twitter's board this week. No, he's not, apparently, but now he wants to buy all of Twitter. Okay, we'll talk about that. Also, the merge, the ethereum merge, sad face.
00:02:25.290 - 00:02:43.034, Speaker B: Not happening in June, so we got to talk about that. Some people are calling this a delay. I think we have a different take on this. Also, Zuckerberg's metaverse, he's working on this metaverse thing, renamed his company. You will be shocked at what markup he is charging on nfTs.
00:02:43.162 - 00:02:46.930, Speaker A: No, I don't think I will, Ryan. I think I won't be shocked at all.
00:02:47.080 - 00:02:52.462, Speaker B: Well, yes, probably listeners will not be shocked, but it is surprising.
00:02:52.526 - 00:02:53.906, Speaker A: I will say high number.
00:02:54.088 - 00:03:12.538, Speaker B: Also, tax memes. Okay. Just to make you feel good. Look, yeah, I know, because this is coming out on the 15th and taxes are due either today or the 18th. I can't remember. So we want to just make you feel good about the pain that you just suffered compiling your crypto taxes. We got some memes in store for you.
00:03:12.538 - 00:03:41.810, Speaker B: We're going to get right to it. Before we do, though, guys, we should talk about the thing that we said would happen, which is these Keith herring NFTs. You know, it was national HIV AIDS Awareness week, and Mac and consensus NFt partnered up to issue these fantastic NFTs. A whole bunch of them are sold. They're sold already, David, I managed to snag this red one. There might still be some red ones left, I'm not sure. And the experience of buying it.
00:03:41.810 - 00:03:56.550, Speaker B: Yeah, okay. So the experience of buying it was really cool. So all I had to do this is it in my opensea wallet. One of my opensea wallets. All I had to do was put in my credit card. So no transaction fees. I didn't even have to spend fiat on this or, excuse me, eth on this.
00:03:56.550 - 00:03:57.586, Speaker B: I could spend fiat.
00:03:57.618 - 00:03:59.640, Speaker A: Right, so you didn't even have a taxable event.
00:03:59.950 - 00:04:04.906, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. Now you're thinking like me, I got them.
00:04:05.088 - 00:04:10.266, Speaker A: This is the only time of year I'm going to be into these tax memes. That's the second thing you've said to.
00:04:10.288 - 00:04:36.514, Speaker B: Me today, that I'm like, God damn, David is tax savvy now. Anyway, so you pay with fiat and there's no transaction fees. It's issued on Polygon. They send you an email, you click it, you get it minted, and you're all set. So pretty cool. And of course, as we reminded you the last week, 100% of the proceeds, even resale value, goes to support youth affected by HIV and AIDS. So you'll want to check this out.
00:04:36.632 - 00:04:53.820, Speaker A: Yeah, there's 5000 total red nfts left. They are the common tier, if you will, but you'll notice that they're going for $25 each with your credit card. But the floor price is $82. As soon as those sell out, what happens next? I don't know.
00:04:54.270 - 00:05:06.926, Speaker B: Nfts for charity, but maybe also some alpha kind of cool. Let's talk about markets, though, David. Let's see. Oh, by the way, link in the show notes to that if you want the easy button. Markets, though. Bitcoin price, we up, we down, we.
00:05:06.948 - 00:05:30.854, Speaker A: Sideways, we're down, Ryan. We started 43 and a half, $1,000. We fell down to a low of $39.5 thousand. So broke through that $40,000 number, which is a good number to not break through. But we are back above it. We are back above it at where we are now at basically $40,100 defending that $40,000 number.
00:05:30.854 - 00:05:35.846, Speaker A: If we could keep on defending that pretty well, that'd be nice. Dangerously close to below 40,000.
00:05:35.948 - 00:05:56.394, Speaker B: It's an interesting week to look at crypto prices, right? Because we're going to get to it. The 8.5% inflation we were talking about that happened this week. And so it's been interesting to see how bitcoin and ether and other crypto assets respond to this. But how about Eth? How has it responded to some of this news? And I think the news came out like, was it Monday ish about inflation worries? Monday, Tuesday, Tuesday?
00:05:56.442 - 00:05:58.766, Speaker A: I think something like that, yeah, you can see down.
00:05:58.868 - 00:06:00.766, Speaker B: We're down. But what's ETh for the week?
00:06:00.868 - 00:06:11.070, Speaker A: ETH is down two and a half percent this week. Bitcoin was down is down 5%. ETH is down two and a half percent. I wrote these numbers in. They actually might be down a little bit more than that. So it might be something like 5.5 and 3%.
00:06:11.070 - 00:06:31.618, Speaker A: Bitcoin and ETH started the week at $3,200, hit a low just below $3,000. Just like bitcoin is defending 40,000, ether is defending 3000. We are currently at $3,020, keeping our head right above water, not terribly comfortable, but defended nonetheless.
00:06:31.794 - 00:06:37.530, Speaker B: It's a good day for above three k. I'm going to say it every time, David. Eth, bitcoin ratio. What's the ratio looking like?
00:06:37.600 - 00:06:46.460, Speaker A: Yeah, ETh bitcoin ratio up two and a half percent. Yeah. So we are at 00:55 or, excuse me, what I have to say 0755.
00:06:47.250 - 00:06:47.806, Speaker B: Okay.
00:06:47.908 - 00:06:52.522, Speaker A: Up two and a half percent. I'm not like bull. Market appetite still on the table?
00:06:52.666 - 00:06:57.780, Speaker B: Yeah, it's definitely on the table. I'm going to look at the six month year. What are we looking at in the six month?
00:06:58.390 - 00:07:07.774, Speaker A: Go to the one year. Go to the one year, not the year to date because it's still so early. Go to the one year. Yeah. Trending higher. Trending higher. We're cool with it.
00:07:07.912 - 00:07:16.886, Speaker B: Interesting. All right, so the market's not saying bear territory right now. The market's kind of undecided, which is super interesting. How about question for you, Ryan, just.
00:07:16.908 - 00:07:24.742, Speaker A: Like, just gut take. How do you feel about the market? Just general sentiment. No charts, no numbers. General sentiment.
00:07:24.806 - 00:07:25.910, Speaker B: Can I be honest for a minute?
00:07:25.990 - 00:07:26.714, Speaker A: Sure.
00:07:26.912 - 00:07:50.670, Speaker B: I'm feeling real good about the market. Yeah. I'm feeling really like maybe I'm too bullish. And that worries me a little bit. Like the fact that inflation and kind of these fed shocks, the news has sunk in. I mean, the Fed is going to take some pretty drastic action here in the coming months. They're going to have to raising rates.
00:07:50.670 - 00:08:02.486, Speaker B: They're going to start selling their bonds. We got into a whole episode with us about crypto with Dan Morehead where we talk about this. That episode is coming out not next Monday but the Monday after.
00:08:02.588 - 00:08:04.600, Speaker A: Right. Because Metallic's coming out next.
00:08:05.770 - 00:08:38.178, Speaker B: You know, Vitalik gets the spot first, but the episode with Dan was fantastic as well. Anyway, I think that I would have with Ukraine, with all of the macro things happening this year, I would have expected it to tank hard. And it's not, it's actually becoming a little less correlated with the stock market. Right. So look, there could be some other shocks in store for us this year, right. A big hit on some event. Something could happen with the stock market and the bottom falls out of that.
00:08:38.178 - 00:09:01.770, Speaker B: Who knows? I think it will take crypto down with it, but I think our recovery might be stronger and faster. And it's not certain that all of those things will happen either. So I'm feeling pretty good about it and I don't know if I trust my instinct or feeling on that. But look, don't listen to me. I'm a long term holder about these things, so I get less worried about what happens in the week to week and the month to month. What's your take?
00:09:01.920 - 00:09:42.838, Speaker A: Yeah, I would agree. The market has definitely internalized and accepted the Fed's actions. From what I've gathered, we've had basically the whole entire year to come to terms with the Fed is going to raise interest rates and unoffload their balance sheet. And the news this week was that, oh, inflation was even hotter. The Fed is going to even more aggressively offload their balance sheet. And so we went from where we were at 3500 down to 3000 more or less or something like that in the last two weeks. And so if that's what it's going to be, when we find out that it's going to be even faster than it is, then fine, we'll take it.
00:09:42.924 - 00:09:44.054, Speaker B: Is that all you got?
00:09:44.172 - 00:09:56.634, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll take a gut punch of 3500 down to 3000. If this is how we are reacting to an acceleration of the bearishness, then that's fine. 3000 is cool.
00:09:56.752 - 00:10:16.178, Speaker B: Because here's the other thing. Macro is the only thing holding crypto down at the moment. I firmly believe that. Right. That's why we are kind of in this crap territory. If everything was going swimmingly from a macro perspective, I think we would be hitting higher highs over all time highs right now.
00:10:16.344 - 00:10:45.834, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree with that for sure. Actually, the episode that we did with Dan Moorhead is just really timely because Dan Moorhead was a macro investor before he became a crypto investor, and he realized in 2013 how macro of a conversation crypto is going to be. So he pivoted pantera from a macro fund to a crypto fund. The timing for that episode couldn't be better, but we got to put out Vitalik first. But for those who subscribe to the premium feed, who are paid subscribers of bankless, you'll get that early access earlier in the week.
00:10:45.872 - 00:10:48.762, Speaker B: Yeah, let's see if we can do that earlier, like earlier in the week.
00:10:48.816 - 00:10:50.634, Speaker A: Next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Yeah.
00:10:50.752 - 00:11:01.982, Speaker B: Thank you, bankless editors. Well, let's take a look at the cryptocurrency global chart. We don't usually do this, but I think we should start doing it from now on. David, so what is the crypto market cap total this week?
00:11:02.036 - 00:11:17.390, Speaker A: Yeah, we started the week at 2.8 trillion and we are currently at 1.96 trillion. So quick math, we lost a little bit over $0.1 trillion. Yeah, we lost a little over 100 billion.
00:11:17.470 - 00:11:20.850, Speaker B: Is that a quarter of an elon? We lost one quarter of an elon.
00:11:21.010 - 00:11:25.222, Speaker A: My God, that is a quarter. He's so.
00:11:25.276 - 00:11:25.910, Speaker B: Am I right?
00:11:25.980 - 00:11:26.710, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:11:26.780 - 00:11:27.974, Speaker B: I think it's close. I don't know.
00:11:28.012 - 00:11:44.606, Speaker A: I think it's pretty close. I wrote down these numbers right before we lost another, like 1% in the market. So I think the markets are down. The total crypto market cap is down a little bit over 4%. Writing how fast these markets move, like, the numbers get inaccurate from when I write them down 40 minutes ago to where they are.
00:11:44.628 - 00:11:48.750, Speaker B: Should we start talking about these in terms of how many elons we lost?
00:11:49.970 - 00:11:54.354, Speaker A: Well, the US dollar is becoming a terrible frame of reference, so you might.
00:11:54.392 - 00:12:02.980, Speaker B: As well Elon come on the show, though, seriously. Anyway, ETh gas, that's gone down a little bit this week, am I right?
00:12:03.510 - 00:12:12.310, Speaker A: Last week, the average gas price was 45 gray. We are down to 38 gray again. Always correlated with prices. Prices go up, gas goes up, prices go down, gas goes down.
00:12:12.380 - 00:12:53.202, Speaker B: Price at the pump going down. Well, let's talk about what that means. Here's some market insight from Dom. Have you ever thought about what gas price would make ETH actually deflationary in a post merge world? I hope you understood what I just said there in the post merge, because David and I have been talking about it for so long. If you don't go check out a YouTube video that we released on kind of what the merge is. But anyway, Dom says there is an easy way to calculate when, at what gas price eth is deflationary. And to do that, you take the number of active validators in the beacon chain, you calculate the square root and multiply that by a number.
00:12:53.202 - 00:13:15.786, Speaker B: 0.23, 939. Those don't matter. What's really interesting is these numbers right here, which is depending on the number of validators you have. The more validators you have, I guess the higher gas fees need to be to make it deflationary, but they're all still super low. And I think we're at about 3600.
00:13:15.888 - 00:13:19.078, Speaker A: Validators on the 360,000 validators.
00:13:19.094 - 00:13:20.890, Speaker B: Oh, 360,000 validators.
00:13:20.970 - 00:13:24.686, Speaker A: And then 13,000 validators more coming in the queue as well.
00:13:24.788 - 00:13:37.022, Speaker B: Which means about anytime gas fees are. Yeah, 1415 gwe above 14 or 15 gwe we're burning eth.
00:13:37.166 - 00:13:38.914, Speaker A: That's the threshold post merge in post.
00:13:38.952 - 00:13:54.726, Speaker B: Merge merge world, not current state. So that means anytime gas fees are above 15 gwe we're burning. If they're ever below 15 gwe, then we're not burning ETH in a post merge world. But my God, they're always going to be above 15 gwe, aren't they?
00:13:54.828 - 00:14:12.554, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. And according to the Ethereum researchers, they all feel comfortable with about 20 to 30 million ether staked for maximum ethereum security in its final form, like 30 million e stakes. It's going to be really nice when we have a very large layer two ecosystem, because they all going to need that security.
00:14:12.672 - 00:14:15.322, Speaker B: So like 20% ish of all ETH supply.
00:14:15.386 - 00:14:34.370, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Like 30 million ETH is going to be about what you see on the screen at 1 million validators. Right? Like 1 million validators times 32 million ether. Yeah, 3.2 million ether staked. No, 32 million ether staked. Excuse me, which is like 25 ish percent of all ether.
00:14:34.370 - 00:15:07.626, Speaker A: And as for just for people that don't know, the more ether that is staked to the proof of stake network, the Ethereum protocol issues a little bit more in total aggregate, yield goes down because what is issued gets spread out by more people. But the Ethereum protocol ramps up a little bit. The total amount of issuance just to have a balance, just to have an equilibrium. So at maturity, what this means is that we're looking about 24 guay perhaps for that threshold. For in a long term equilibrium of ethereum, 24 guay is the burn ratio. Over the long term, it's always going to be over 24 gwe.
00:15:07.658 - 00:15:45.222, Speaker B: We're going to be burning, we're going to be burning time all the time. Sometimes we're going to be burning massive amounts because we predict gas fees on the theorem main chain to go up and up and up and up because we are on this progress of first, gas is being consumed by users, then gas starts getting consumed more by smart contracts. Eventually gas will be entirely consumed. Ethereum block space will be consumed by layer twos. As the model here, we won't actually have users, individuals like you and I on the Ethereum main chain unless we're like super whales. We'll be doing our stuff on layer two and posting. The layer twos will be posting and purchasing gas from Ethereum.
00:15:45.222 - 00:15:49.562, Speaker B: So gas fees are just going to go up. So always going to be burning in the future.
00:15:49.696 - 00:15:54.986, Speaker A: Even the Ethereum whales probably won't be on the Ethereum l one because all the utility is going to be on the layer twos.
00:15:55.098 - 00:15:59.370, Speaker B: Totally, exactly. We're going to be moving to Brooklyn Way from Manhattan.
00:15:59.530 - 00:16:01.280, Speaker A: Right, David? Nice.
00:16:02.370 - 00:16:19.874, Speaker B: Okay. Itchy token. There's an itchy token collapse. I don't know why we're talking about this, other than it's just a big like 99% DFI debacle. And maybe there's some lessons here. What are the lessons here? It went from 650,000,000 market cap to 10 million in 12 hours. That's pretty painful.
00:16:19.874 - 00:16:20.470, Speaker B: What happened?
00:16:20.540 - 00:17:05.778, Speaker A: Yeah, over half a billion dollars just got deleted in 12 hours. So this was a brand new token that was coming out which was going to help produce a bunch of new stablecoins, kind of just like, kind of democratizing the ability to produce new stablecoins. And what happened is that there was a rari fuse pool. Fuse pool number 136 that was made for the Ichi token and the Ichi token, the team that was managing this rari fuse pool, because as this ichi token was like mooning, basically. It went from like zero to 600 million plus in market cap in like a month or so, maybe a little bit less since March. So, yeah, about a month, actually. Very strong price action up until the time it went to zero.
00:17:05.778 - 00:17:43.390, Speaker A: But basically. Okay, the team with IRA fuse pool, they made a fuse pool so they could borrow against the Ichi token. Kind of like being able to use it in compound, right, but for fuse. But compound doesn't allow you to do this because of risks. And this is going to be a great example as to why compound doesn't allow any asset to come onto its collateral. They increased the loan to value limit on the itchy fuse pool to 85%. So if you put in $1 million worth of Ichi token, you could get $850,000 in stablecoins back, which is a very large loan to loan to value ratio, which is largely reserved for only the most liquid of assets, bitcoin and ether, basically.
00:17:43.390 - 00:18:23.054, Speaker A: That's it. And even with ether, I'd say 85% is still a large amount, even with bitcoin. Kind of reserves only for stables, really, if you want to be hyper secure. But this very illiquid, very brand new token that has just recently had a very large run up in price was given an 85% loan to value ratio. So some users were making significant loans and allowing them to borrow stables, buy each tokens, put eachi tokens in the fuse pool to buy more stables, basically leveraging up on eachi tokens. And so there was a ton of leverage of Ichi tokens with outstanding us dollars being borrowed. And it's really important to note that just because you are leveraging up on Ichi tokens doesn't mean that there's significant amount of liquidity there.
00:18:23.054 - 00:19:09.110, Speaker A: So there's very little ability for, if a sell event were to happen for that price to stay stable, there's no liquidity on the Ichi tokens. And so as soon as there was a blip in the downwards price movement of the Ichi tokens, a massive cascading liquidation happened. And so as soon as the price of each moved by 15% from the highs, the protocol liquidated basically every single ichi token that it had in its its results, which is how it went to zero. Right? There was not enough liquidity to repay the pools. And so the Ichi token went down to zero. And so there's a lesson here. There's a lesson in don't take too much collateral or don't take too much leverage, especially on an illiquid, brand new token with very little price discovery.
00:19:09.110 - 00:19:52.398, Speaker A: But also, in theory, like this itchy token, this democratization of the ability to mint stable coins, that's a viable product that could have worked just fine. But what happened was that there was a very irresponsible team and a DGen community that caused the token price to implode, causing the project to implode. So on one hand we have this viable project, and then on the other hand, we have these irresponsible team and Degen traders that blew up the project. And so my lesson, I love this lesson. The lesson here is culture matters, Ryan. If you have a fundamentals of a project, and the fundamentals of the project are strong, but you have an irresponsible team and a Degen community, it'll wreck the project. Culture matters.
00:19:52.398 - 00:19:53.846, Speaker A: That is my takeaway.
00:19:53.958 - 00:20:25.730, Speaker B: Look, man, they basically burnt down their own house. What's interesting about fuse is different than compound is. Like, fuse is really a power tool. There is no risk to the fuse protocol for these shenanigans. I'm stealing that word now because it sort of isolates the risk to individual pools. So any community can spin up their own pool with whatever risk parameters they want. And this community just created this extreme, over leveraged, terrible pool, and this is the outcome and probably destroyed the project.
00:20:25.730 - 00:20:43.190, Speaker B: I don't know. It's trading a little bit higher now, but this is definitely shaking the faith. So fuse is a power tool. Be very careful how you use it. Yeah, definitely. It's just like shop class again. All right, let's get to inflation.
00:20:43.190 - 00:21:01.646, Speaker B: That's a big story this week. So we said 8.5% inflation. This is the White House. This is spokesperson for the White House calling extraordinary inflation extraordinarily elevated. Extraordinarily elevated. That was hitting headlines this week, I guess a few stats for us.
00:21:01.646 - 00:21:23.302, Speaker B: So inflation apparently was a 40 year high. This is a 40 year high. So we haven't seen this since, I guess, 1981. This is after a decade of inflation, the 70s. It's kind of the high watermark. And really the energy and food costs are spiking up. They're hitting consumers the most.
00:21:23.302 - 00:21:51.680, Speaker B: It's likely that the Fed is going to meet in three weeks time, they're going to increase rates, interest rates, by probably about 50 basis points. So half a percent. It's absolutely crazy what's going on. These are some of the inflation stats. Individually, gasoline, gas is not eve gas, regular gas is up 48%. Used cars up 35%. Meat, fish, eggs up 13%.
00:21:52.050 - 00:21:59.460, Speaker A: Read protein, because that's like meat, fish and eggs. That's protein, energy. Good quality food. Yeah, absolutely.
00:21:59.830 - 00:22:13.714, Speaker B: Food at home is up 10%. I don't know, man. Went to Costco this week, and our grocery bill has never been higher. That is all time highs. Yeah, absolutely. And I think everyone's feeling this. Everyone is noticing.
00:22:13.714 - 00:22:17.494, Speaker B: It's very visible. I mean, you're at, like two to 3% inflation per year.
00:22:17.532 - 00:22:19.606, Speaker A: You barely notice, right?
00:22:19.708 - 00:22:26.154, Speaker B: 8.5%. Then it's like, on a monthly basis, you're just like, wow, everything is spiking in price.
00:22:26.272 - 00:22:30.460, Speaker A: Right? Who could have seen this coming? Gosh, I don't know.
00:22:30.990 - 00:22:50.270, Speaker B: I mean, they used to call it transitory inflation. That was last summer, and we were kind of making fun of that. But look at this. Look at this chart, David. This is kind of a data is beautiful sort of thing, where you could kind of see rates from 1995 on. And we've just had decades, literally, of low inflation.
00:22:50.430 - 00:23:02.982, Speaker A: 1.4 is the lowest number that I see. The highest number that I see is four. All the way back 2009, it was inverse. The dollar was deflationary. 2009, I see a negative 2.4% inflation rate.
00:23:02.982 - 00:23:03.974, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah.
00:23:04.012 - 00:23:07.654, Speaker B: You're not seeing, like, 2008 was kind of a tricky year, of course.
00:23:07.692 - 00:23:22.462, Speaker A: Well, that makes sense because that's right before the housing bubble. That was the peak of the housing bubble, when there was so much capital flowing around. So that actually makes sense. And then we retraced it, right? Like, oh, 5% inflation rate happened too much. And then the housing bubble crashed and we recorrected that.
00:23:22.596 - 00:23:32.858, Speaker B: Healthy ish, at least CPI asset price inflation, different story. Not healthy, but, like, healthy, healthy, healthy. Now look at this. 6.2%. Bam.
00:23:33.034 - 00:23:51.302, Speaker A: 7.5%. April of 2021 is when you really start to see it, and it starts to really change the parameters, which makes sense because that is the first summer post Covid, when people decided that they were done and they were getting out and going to enjoy their lives again. This is all Covid, man.
00:23:51.436 - 00:23:51.926, Speaker B: Wow.
00:23:52.028 - 00:24:11.578, Speaker A: 8.5 number is a dark square. Oh, man. So there's many, many more unfilled months for the remainder of 2022. And that's really going to be the story. Like, how dark are those squares going to get, or are they going to return to normalcy? That is, I think, the big story of the remainder of 2022. How bad will inflation get?
00:24:11.664 - 00:24:15.998, Speaker B: I think we're headed to double digits. You had a take here. What was your take on this?
00:24:16.084 - 00:24:45.794, Speaker A: Yeah, my take was inflation and distrust in government are highly correlated. When they break our money, they break our faith. This is why in the crypto industry, we like to talk about the separation between government and money. The separation between money and state, because the government is responsible for the money and because money works, because we all believe in it. When our faith in the money breaks, our faith in government also breaks. These are the same sides of two different coins. No, two different sides of the same coin.
00:24:45.794 - 00:24:46.214, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:24:46.252 - 00:25:19.070, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And I think that inflation is the thing that everyone notices. I would argue that markets have been broken for a while, just the last, like, 15 years, asset price inflation has been absolutely insane, but now everyone's noticing it because everyone pays for things denominated in dollars, and now that's going off the rails. And it's not clear that the Fed has a plan that's workable to correct. Know, we use that term. Powell's just. It's the Jesus take the wheel approach.
00:25:19.070 - 00:25:45.740, Speaker B: I don't think they know what they're doing. I mean, a year ago, less than a year ago, they were calling all of this transitory. Does this look very transitory to you? We have a clear escalation in inflation rates. It's getting worse, not better. And how do you dial this down? They're barely taking action right now, and it's unclear that they'll be able to get this genie back in the bottle. So TBD on that.
00:25:46.590 - 00:25:52.698, Speaker A: It's hard to see inflation getting worse than 8.5%. But also, what do I know? I was born in the. Don't know anything.
00:25:52.864 - 00:26:16.706, Speaker B: Well, yeah, it did get worse, and it can get worse. And what's different than the 1970s is that the Fed has far more, like, the balance sheet is far more leveraged. I mean, they weren't, like, buying bonds in the 1970s, and they have been. There's a massive amount of bonds on the balance sheet, and our debt is higher than ever. Anyway, again, Dan Moorhead episode, if you want to hear more about this. Yeah.
00:26:16.728 - 00:26:20.546, Speaker A: The reason why Ryan just skipped to the 70s was because that's what we talked about in Dan Moorhead.
00:26:20.578 - 00:26:55.490, Speaker B: So let's contrast that. All right. We've called Ether Ethereum, ether the asset, an Internet bond before, and we think that this is especially true, of course, we're staking out in a post merge environment. Bloomberg has been really increasing their coverage on ether as an asset and getting increasingly bullish on it. They have a few analysts over there that are doing this. This is a Bloomberg estimate. Bloomberg is estimating post merge a 9% ETH staking yield and a negative 2% issuance reduction annually.
00:26:55.490 - 00:27:28.762, Speaker B: They're actually estimating Ether's yield as an Internet bond and its supply. This is the type of stuff that we were hoping financial analysts would start to do on Wall street that only like crypto people were doing, that only like guests on the bankless show and the bankless newsletter were doing. And now we have Bloomberg doing it, not just bankless. These estimates are pretty good. I mean, it's based on some stuff. They've done their research, they've done their due diligence. I'm not sure if it's going to be like 9%.
00:27:28.762 - 00:28:08.730, Speaker B: I actually would err on something higher than 9%, baby. Yeah, and it's probably like with MeV and such, you're probably like maybe twelve to 15% is what I would say. This 2% issuance reduction sounds about right, but it's just so cool to see Bloomberg covering this. And also contrast that with what's going on in the yield markets where you are making like if you buy a treasury, a government bond right now in real terms, how much are you losing per year? Like 2%, 3% losing per year. What a contrast in buying ether as an Internet bond versus the sovereign bonds that you can get in fiat economies.
00:28:10.510 - 00:29:12.890, Speaker A: Think of how magical this must look like, and honestly why people probably look at this with skepticism. How can there be a net issuance reduction of 2%, negative 2% deflation in the monetary supply rather than inflation of the monetary supply? And investors be getting yield that has to just boggle people's brains until they understand the relationship between blockspace sales, eip one, five nine, all that stuff. Okay, so on one hand you have a currency that is inflating in supply, so your real terms are going down and the yield that you get in the bond market is because of treasuries and issuance from the United States government is less than the actual real terms of value. So you have inflating supply of the currency base and the yield for your bonds is less than the actual inflation. On the other side of things, you have a deflating currency base, but the yield that you're getting on that deflating currency is higher than the yield that you would get in the bonds. I know, man. It's insane.
00:29:13.050 - 00:29:29.860, Speaker B: It's also, look, the narrative is too good here, too, right? It's just forget digital gold. Like, we're going after the bond market, the sovereign bond market, right? Not $8 trillion in market cap. It's like $50 to $70 trillion in market cap.
00:29:30.390 - 00:30:05.680, Speaker A: Peter Thiel, when he was talking at the bitcoin conference, he'd made the comparison between bitcoin and ethereum, and he compared ethereum to Visa, and he's like, all right, well, here's Visa's market cap as a payment network. But then bitcoin is going after the much larger market cap of gold, and gold has got a $7 trillion market cap, and Visa is only like, I don't know, half, I don't know, whatever visa is. And I'm just watching Peter Thiel talk about how comparing ethereum to Visa, I'm like, bro, you guys are taking the smaller market cap is going after gold. We're going after the bond market, bro.
00:30:07.090 - 00:30:29.702, Speaker B: I don't even understand. Ether is just as much a non sovereign store of value as bitcoin is at this point. To compare it in that way just feels like you're living back in 2017. Whatever. Look at this chart, man. Fiat issuance, 12%, right? And then we have Ethereum over here, post merged at a negative 2%. Negative 2.2%.
00:30:29.702 - 00:31:08.530, Speaker B: So it's almost like Apple stock buybacks, right? Where it's like Apple stock, you get a negative three to 4% issuance rate in kind of buybacks. That's essentially what you're getting with Ethereum anyway. I don't think the bond market is going to know what hits it once this narrative comes out. Okay? It's just like, realize it's just come from kind of the Ethereum community. Bankless is very bottom layer of the tier. We basically, we learn from researchers and we try to understand the protocol as best we can. We get it direct from the source, and then we bring it a level higher to help more people understand.
00:31:08.530 - 00:31:21.862, Speaker B: But, like, mainstream does not tune into bankless in the way they tune it. But Bloomberg tunes into bankless. So then Bloomberg gets a hold of it, and then pretty soon other analysts take a look at this thing. They're like, what is this?
00:31:21.916 - 00:31:25.494, Speaker A: What is happening of information?
00:31:25.692 - 00:31:32.730, Speaker B: This is what's happening. If you're listening to bankless, the good news is you're still early. No one knows about this, David. No one knows about this.
00:31:32.800 - 00:31:47.726, Speaker A: Right. Even half of the crypto, more than half of the crypto industry is not appreciating this. I'm sure that the bitcoiners, the anti Ethereum skeptics would love to say like, but you guys, the merge just got delayed. Okay, fine, more time to stack eth. That's great.
00:31:47.748 - 00:31:57.378, Speaker B: Yeah, let's talk about that. We'll talk about that coming up. But guys, we want to get to a few more things, some releases first. Before we do all of that, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:31:57.464 - 00:32:42.910, Speaker A: Arbitrum is an ethereum layer two scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and nfts. Over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrum, and the DFI and NFT ecosystems are growing rapidly. Some of the coolest and newest NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home. All the while, DeFi protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity. Using arbitrum has never been easier, especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitrum through all the exchanges, including Binance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com. Once inside, you'll notice arbitrum increases Ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee. If you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users, visit Arbitrum IO slash developer to start building your dap on Arbitrum if you're a dgen, many of your favorite dapps on Ethereum are already on Arbitrum, with many moving over every day.
00:32:42.910 - 00:33:45.026, Speaker A: Go to bridge Arbitrum IO now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience DFI nfts in the way it was always meant to be. Fast, cheap, secure, and friction free. Ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol, and now Ave V three is here. Ave V three has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of DFI, including isolation mode, which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types, and also efficiency mode, which allows for higher loan to value ratios and of course, portals, allowing users to port their AAvE position across all of the networks that AavE operates on like Polygon, Phantom, Avalanche, arbitrum optimism and harmony the beautiful thing about AAvE is that it's completely open source, decentralized, and governed by its community, enabling a truly bankless future for us all. To get your first cryptocuralized loan, get started@ave.com that's aave.com. And also check out the Ave protocol governance forums to see what more than 100,000 Dow members are all robbing about at governance ave.com.
00:33:45.026 - 00:34:19.518, Speaker A: If you're trying to grow and preserve your crypto wealth, optimizing your taxes is just as lucrative as trying to find the next hidden gem. Also, IRA can help you invest in crypto in tax advantage, ways to help you preserve your hard earned money. Also, crypto IRA lets you invest in more than 150 coins and tokens with all the same tax advantages of an IRA. They make it easy to fund your alternative IRA or crypto IRA via your four hundred and one k or by contributing directly from your bank account. There is no setup or account fees, and it's all you need to do to invest in crypto tax free. Let me repeat that again. You can invest in crypto tax free.
00:34:19.518 - 00:34:35.874, Speaker A: Diversify like the pros and trade without tax headaches. Open an Alto cryptoira. To invest in crypto tax free, just go to altoira.com bankless, that's altoira.com bankless, and start investing in crypto today.
00:34:35.992 - 00:35:15.758, Speaker B: All right, guys, the releases of the week. Robinhood, you know them big fintech platform, a lot of the meme stocks trading there, they just enabled crypto wallet transfers. So on Robinhood, for a long time, you've had the ability to buy, like, crypto assets, right? But Robinhood was always custodying them, and this annoyed us to no end because that is the antithesis of the bankless vision, which is you should have the option to take sovereignty of your keys if you want to. Robinhood previously had not enabled withdrawals to private keys. Well, now they are. So they are enabling the withdrawal from the Robinhood platform to crypto wallets, which is fantastic. Well done, Robinhood.
00:35:15.758 - 00:35:29.862, Speaker B: I think they are also adding some other crypto features. This is sort of what we've been told that are even more kind of self sovereign and bankless in the future, too. So I think this is a sign of Robinhood getting on board. What's your take here?
00:35:29.996 - 00:36:18.646, Speaker A: Yeah, they say from the article, the rollout began in September to a select group of users, as reported at the time. In December, the company inked a deal with blockchain analytics from chain analysis to prepare for the offering's wider rollout. So they probably didn't want to, if I'm reading the writing on the wall, they probably didn't want to allow users to have complete self sovereignty over their being able to take custody of their own funds, because securities regulations is different than crypto asset regulations. And so giving them the ability to freely exit is concerning for them. But that is the way the industry is moving. We have the power to take over our money, so we will. But they've onboarded chain analysis like the eye of Sauron of the government, the tech extension of the government to surveil the incomings and outcomings of going out of Robinhood to help protect them.
00:36:18.646 - 00:36:43.790, Speaker A: And so do be aware, if you are using Robinhood, the chain analysis, which has way better data about blockchain analytics than you do, is watching you. They're probably watching you anyways. So there's that. But this is Robinhood trying to keep up with the rest of the industry and allowing us to do all the things that crypto allows us to do. So thank you, Robinhood, for getting to this point. And I'm looking forward to the further increased innovations that coming out of you guys.
00:36:43.860 - 00:36:58.898, Speaker B: I think layer two is next. Look, they're adding the bitcoin lightning network, apparently, and I expect other ethereum layer twos will come after that, so very good. Also, Polygon. They're doing some more liquidity mining just to incent use of their protocol. What's going on here?
00:36:58.984 - 00:37:39.690, Speaker A: Yeah, this isn't just like another liquidity mining program. They're actually, I think, really pioneering innovating, trying to make liquidity mining get the KPIs that they're really looking for. They actually are literally calling it KPI liquidity mining. First ever, KPI liquidity mining 2.0. So rather than just like, yeeting out, spraying out matic tokens to incentivize the adoption of protocols, they're doing things that are more surgical, more targeted, to make sure that those issuance rewards are actually producing the outcomes that they're looking for, rather than just being like, liquidity mined to death, rather than just being farmed and dumped. So there's two parameters that they're really looking for in this 2.0 version of liquidity mining.
00:37:39.690 - 00:38:13.366, Speaker A: Total value locked and weekly average users. Total value locked really benefits the whales, which is good because you need liquidity, but weekly average users also benefits the small guy, like the little fry, the individuals. And so I like this model. If they can get this right, I think this is a great, just like, experiment for the industry to understand. Even anon teams can apply for the campaign every single month. Distribution is manually evaluated, which I think is actually a great just tool, just manual evaluation. It's a little bit harder, but you get a lot more bang for your buck.
00:38:13.366 - 00:38:40.866, Speaker A: And applications that have worked harder to get the KPIs out the door get more and more allocation for the next month. So long as they proved it. The individual projects get to choose where they send the funds, of course. And then there's this graph that Ryan's got on screen, which is showing all the eligible applications on Matic, on polygon that are receiving distributions. Things like Avegachi staked out, and then a bunch of other things that I'm actually not familiar with.
00:38:41.048 - 00:39:02.058, Speaker B: Yeah, this is really cool. So less gamable, and the bottom line is more tokens if you are using these layer two protocols, and so be aware of that and get involved, we encourage you to just use all of these protocols. Guys, you got to get there. What is this? This is umbra. Yeah, this is a privacy payments type of protocol. What's going on?
00:39:02.144 - 00:39:18.186, Speaker A: Yeah, privacy payments on both optimism and arbitrum. They call them stealth payments. I don't know if that's a technical difference from privacy payments like aztec or what stealth payments are, but I would imagine it's net the same. So, yeah, privacy payments on layer two coming with Umbra.
00:39:18.378 - 00:39:21.774, Speaker B: That's really cool. Good to see that privacy is also.
00:39:21.812 - 00:39:26.542, Speaker A: Expensive because it's computationally expensive, but when you put it on a layer two, it becomes a lot more viable.
00:39:26.686 - 00:39:41.254, Speaker B: Right. Which we need, man. So the I of Soron can't invade everywhere. We still are able to preserve our privacy as we are in the physical world. Uniswap Labs, they just announced and they just launched. Excuse me, a swap widget. This looks really cool.
00:39:41.254 - 00:39:42.102, Speaker B: What is this?
00:39:42.236 - 00:40:11.978, Speaker A: Yeah, so, as we know, the front ends for applications are centralized, especially like app Uniswap finance or whatever it is. I don't know. It auto loads into my browser. That's the Uniswap labs operated front end. That's the thing that restricts based off certain geolocations. They are building a widget to put different Uniswap labs front ends wherever there needs to be exchanges. So maybe it's like an iframe, if I'm remembering my web dev history correctly.
00:40:11.978 - 00:40:14.426, Speaker A: But you can basically inject a Uniswap.
00:40:14.458 - 00:40:15.326, Speaker B: Add it to your website.
00:40:15.428 - 00:40:31.858, Speaker A: Add it to your website? Yeah, just click button, deploy, allow for your tokens. Right. So I don't know, maybe you have like a token gated website and somebody comes to your website and wants to access whatever's behind your token gate, but they don't have your token. You could just put your Uniswap widget on your website so that people can get your token.
00:40:31.954 - 00:40:41.382, Speaker B: It's basically like you have to have ten tokens to become a member. You embed the Uniswap widget. Click here. Bam, you're a member, right? Because you're just buying on Uniswap or.
00:40:41.436 - 00:40:52.090, Speaker A: Any use case or any that needs a swap. Right? So like, oh, I got to go buy the token to do the things. Well, I got to go load up Uniswap. Well, if you just put the widget into the website, it's easier.
00:40:52.250 - 00:41:07.458, Speaker B: Yeah, it's super cool. It's going to become pretty pervasive. And all of that liquidity, of course, that Uniswap has bring to bear decreases the price on that stuff. So it's cool. Avalanche mempool. What do you want to tell us about this? Are they opening up? What's happening?
00:41:07.544 - 00:41:38.822, Speaker A: Yeah, so this was something. I was actually talking with David Meehau, who runs the crypto fees moneyprinter info. We use his websites a bunch to display metrics. And I was talking to him about how the avalanche mempool is actually not available for public view. This is something that they have closed and only available to people who stake Avax tokens, which I have concerns with because MeV is something that makes the defi ecosystem for your chain extremely efficient and extremely solid. Right. Very rapid liquidations.
00:41:38.822 - 00:41:41.900, Speaker A: It prevents cascading liquidations when there shouldn't have to be.
00:41:43.150 - 00:41:46.414, Speaker B: There might be. Some people don't even know what that mempool is, though, right?
00:41:46.532 - 00:41:47.374, Speaker A: Yeah. Wow, you're right.
00:41:47.412 - 00:41:51.834, Speaker B: Yeah. What is that? That's like a holding tank area, right, where transactions are queued.
00:41:51.962 - 00:42:35.198, Speaker A: So, yeah, if you're on ethereum, the way that I'm familiar with the mempool is like, you go submit your transactions, and then you go click the link to ether scan, and it shows, like, oh, your transaction is pending, and you've got the loading screen, and then boom, it's confirmed. Before it's confirmed, it's in the mem pool. So the mempool stands for memory pool. It's like a memory bank of transactions. And so while your transaction is pending and not yet in the blockchain, it's in the mem pool. And the Mem pool is where MeV arbitragers, people that are reordering transactions to benefit themselves, are taking all these transactions and ordering them so they can extract some sort of value, like some arbitrage on uniswap, or they can get first liquidations. Avalanche does not give that mempool out to the public.
00:42:35.198 - 00:43:05.686, Speaker A: It keeps it contained for the avalanche stakers, because that makes the Avax token, if you want to access the rewards of MeV you have to own Avax, right. It's a little bit reminiscent of order deal flow from Robinhood to Citadel, which got people very, very upset earlier in the days. And it's always been a very big concern of mine that they don't open up the mempool to the public. The mempool is a public good. It's a public resource. And having a publicly available mempool just makes the whole system very, very strong and anti fragile because as we saw.
00:43:05.708 - 00:43:22.246, Speaker B: In the Robin Hood case, the ability to order transactions or process them in whatever order you wish is a very powerful feature, especially when you're dealing with large amounts, anything financial. It's a very powerful superpower.
00:43:22.358 - 00:44:06.026, Speaker A: Oh, it's arguably the biggest power in Defi. If you have God mode basically over that one block, because you're the validator, you have momentary God mode for that one block, so you can order the transactions as you see fit to best benefit yourselves. Okay, so it's previously and actually still the Avalanche mempool is not available to the public. But this chainsight Labs organization, they put out a tweet announcing that they are opening up the avalanche mempool because they are an avalanche staker. And so on Avalanche's behalf, they are broadcasting the mempool because they have access to that data. So they tweet out, for too long, Mev on avalanche has been gatekeeped and siloed from the masses due to avax not gossiping the mempool. But no longer.
00:44:06.026 - 00:44:44.262, Speaker A: Today we release the web app to Snowsight, an Avax mempool service, so you can access, finally, the avalanche mempool at Avax, chainsite dev, and you can now tap into the mempool. And so what should be a public good has actually now been captured by Chainsight because Avalanche hasn't released it. And so now chainsight is like the broadcaster of the mempool. I mean, in my mind, avalanche should just open it up anyways. This is a logical conclusion for the avalanche mempool. But between now and then, chainsight has complete monopoly over the broadcasting of the avalanche mempool. But also, thank you to chainsight for opening that thing up again.
00:44:44.262 - 00:44:46.870, Speaker A: The mempool is the public good. It should not be privatized.
00:44:47.390 - 00:45:12.622, Speaker B: Absolutely. Let's switch to razors. Epic Games. They just got $2 billion. To do what? To build an avatar filled metaverse. All right, so the makers of Fortnite now get $2 billion to go create a whole bunch of avatars in whatever the metaverse means to epic games, which you know it's going to involve nfts of some form or fashion. That's pretty big news, man.
00:45:12.622 - 00:45:17.678, Speaker B: This is like a major gaming studio entering in a big way. What are your thoughts?
00:45:17.774 - 00:45:43.894, Speaker A: Yeah, there's also. Lego is involved. Yeah, Lego. I guess Lego has kind of always been like a metaverse esque type of organization, type of brand. 2 billion in raw funding. That's pretty insane. This kind of feels very similar to the Microsoft acquisition of Activision Blizzard, game companies being acquired or just funding and other things of this nature.
00:45:43.894 - 00:45:50.374, Speaker A: So Tradfi, web two trad organizations coming into the metaverse in their own particular way.
00:45:50.432 - 00:46:28.150, Speaker B: Okay. All right, let's talk about Uniswap Labs Ventures. We're just talking about Uniswap in general, but it looks like they've spun out a VC firm or a VC agency, I guess. And they are going to invest in web3 organizations, I imagine web3 projects. Here's a list of the projects they started with tenderly layer zero bridge protocol maker Dow apparently ave compound protocol, a whole bunch of others. What do you make of this sort of defi projects? DeFi protocols now launching their own capital pools as becoming venture capitalists.
00:46:28.910 - 00:47:03.506, Speaker A: I think it's a logical conclusion. It's not like they are making a particular strategy or they are doing anything unique. They have capital, and if you are somebody who owns capital, you need to put your capital to work for you. And so this is the logical conclusion. This is the theme of the space is like all daos have turned into vcs, all DeFi projects have turned into vcs. Like Coinbase Ventures started up forever ago. Coinbase is an exchange, but the industry is so ripe and young and fertile that they should take some of their capital because it's logical to and invest it in things.
00:47:03.506 - 00:47:08.178, Speaker A: So any DeFi app with a token that has a significant treasury, you're going to see them turn into vcs.
00:47:08.274 - 00:47:34.926, Speaker B: They're also investing in things that kind of benefit the Uniswap protocol. I would imagine the same way that FTX and SBF is investing in things that benefit FTx. So I imagine we see more of that. It's interesting. Yeah, I don't know quite how I feel about it, but Spencer Dune has an interesting take about vcs in general and the entire model. He says this protocols are launching funds anons are angel investing. Dows are raising millions per day.
00:47:34.926 - 00:47:56.162, Speaker B: Some projects don't even raise private dollars anymore. BC as we know it is probably dead by 2030. It's so funny because do you remember when icos were going crazy in 2017. That's what people were saying. It's like, oh, the VC model is dead. It's dead. And the vcs would fight back and be like, what are you talking about? These ICO tokens are nothing.
00:47:56.162 - 00:48:20.070, Speaker B: They're futility tokens. This isn't real. And they proved to be right, but I bet they are not going to be right. Over the longer time horizon, I think we have a massive disruption force in the typical VC model. We're never going back to the 1990s and the 2000 era of vcs. I think this crypto is going to completely disrupt what's happening. What are your thoughts?
00:48:20.150 - 00:48:51.000, Speaker A: Yeah, just one nuance and I think Spencer got it right, like vcs. And you said it too, vcs as we know it. And so you talked about how the vcs of the are dead. And I think the crypto industry has already shifted the Overton window of what a VC means. What VC is, is changing. But I do think the one thing that will never, ever go away from whatever you call a VC is always legitimacy and brand and trust. Right? That is what a VC is.
00:48:51.000 - 00:49:27.730, Speaker A: When I did my episode with Haseeb Qureshi from Dragonfly, we dove into these subjects and he made a very strong case as to why vcs will never go away. Because the opposite of vcs is retail. Right? And so when you say retail, what you're really talking about, what you want to be talking about is just like the average hobbyists who care and have the shared values and legitimacy, but it's hard to target those people. So what vcs do is they centralize and collapse all the legitimacy into one organization and they have their network. Right. You're never going to get away from that.
00:49:27.800 - 00:49:52.698, Speaker B: No. There is a need for the function that vcs provide. It's sort of like, we're not trying to get rid of banking, there's a need for banking, but we're trying to get rid of banks. That's what's happening. So you still need to lend, borrow and pay for things. You just don't need the 150,000 Wells Fargo employees to go help you do those things in the bank branches and physical locations. Yeah, I think that's what's happening here for sure.
00:49:52.784 - 00:49:59.014, Speaker A: Plus there's plenty of toxic individuals out there and those toxic individuals definitely don't become part of VC firms.
00:49:59.142 - 00:50:25.234, Speaker B: Right. Circle just announced 400 million dollar funding round, so they are getting funding. I think the big news is it's Blackrock fidelity. Like some really big institutional finance names now coming into circle. Circle of course, creators of USDC. Not the biggest, but the biggest, I guess, most legitimate stablecoin in the US. Also, avalanche developer just raised $350,000,000.
00:50:25.234 - 00:50:31.618, Speaker B: Avalanche developer. Does this just mean avalanche, the ecosystem, is raising $350,000,000? What is this, David?
00:50:31.714 - 00:50:42.518, Speaker A: Yeah, that title is certainly od. This is definitely the avalanche ecosystem. Ava labs. Okay, here's what they mean. The developer of avalanche, Ava Labs, they can basically.
00:50:42.604 - 00:50:47.114, Speaker B: I see avalanche, not an individual developer, it's the studio behind it. Yeah. Okay.
00:50:47.152 - 00:51:06.466, Speaker A: So report raised $350,000,000 in a new founding ground valued at $5.25 billion in valuation. The way that works, because the avalanche token is actually liquid. Right. So what they did is they probably just discounted it. Wow. The market cap of avalanche is $20 billion.
00:51:06.466 - 00:51:10.510, Speaker A: Does that mean that they got a 75% discount on the token?
00:51:10.590 - 00:51:15.662, Speaker B: No, there's the market cap of the token.
00:51:15.726 - 00:51:15.906, Speaker A: Right?
00:51:15.928 - 00:51:28.406, Speaker B: And then there's Ava Labs, the entity that likely owns a whole bunch of the token on their balance sheet. But is the development. This would be akin to the Ethereum foundation getting funded, for example, because they.
00:51:28.428 - 00:51:30.806, Speaker A: Have a balance sheet of ether on the table. Yeah.
00:51:30.828 - 00:52:14.450, Speaker B: And because they're producing ethereum type stuff. It's really interesting. I don't know the structure of Ava labs, but I imagine it's got to be a commercial entity, right? It's got to be like a private entity, which is very different than the EF, which has always been nonprofit, can't get funding like that and plans to dissolve over time. This is much more commercial. Definitely different than the vision that Vitalik had when he had this fork in the road of do we go nonprofit and become sort of a public good? Or do we go like raise money from vcs and go the Charles Hoskinson route that he was advising and he decided to stick with the nonprofit foundation, which is the EF, but many other layer ones are going in the complete opposite direction.
00:52:14.530 - 00:52:33.450, Speaker A: Yeah. The cultural difference, I think, couldn't be more clear here. The idea of dissolving the thing that helped birth ethereum rather than making that entity larger over time, has significant impacts to the ecosystem as a whole. The money that came from this was from three arrows, capital and polychain.
00:52:33.790 - 00:52:42.094, Speaker B: Interesting. Some people see this as a strength, others see it as a weakness. It depends what side of the spectrum you're on. I have my own takes, David. I know you do as well.
00:52:42.132 - 00:52:43.406, Speaker A: I don't think the listeners need to.
00:52:43.428 - 00:53:09.350, Speaker B: Guess ignite formerly tendermint. They just launched $150,000,000 accelerator for web3 projects. So this is from the cosmos ecosystem, really. And tendermint is being used everywhere. That's the consensus platform structure behind Luna, also behind matic. Like, tendermint is being used in so many different places.
00:53:10.010 - 00:53:13.590, Speaker A: So much praise for the actual technology of tendermint.
00:53:13.670 - 00:53:14.250, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:14.400 - 00:53:16.954, Speaker A: People have said that it's been for years. Yeah.
00:53:17.072 - 00:53:36.046, Speaker B: It's open source. Anyone can take it, use it in their project. It's definitely a net accretion to the industry. Actually, we're getting Ethan, who's one of the original creators of tendermint on bankless, to come on, tell us a few things about it. And the cosmos ecosystem might be sort of a back and forth debate structure. We'll have to see. Goldman Sachs.
00:53:36.046 - 00:53:46.340, Speaker B: They are investing in blockchain security firm Certic, an $88 million funding ramp. Certic. Are they, like, auditing smart contract auditing type stuff?
00:53:46.790 - 00:54:11.258, Speaker A: Yes. So Certic uses, from what they claim, AI technology to monitor blockchain protocols and provide security audits for smart contracts. So, like, I think one part chain analysis, but then also a little bit of just like, automated auditing. They also have launched KYC and fraud investigation services. So a combo of smart contract auditing but also chain analysis type stuff as well. Yeah.
00:54:11.424 - 00:54:22.014, Speaker B: Nice. Nomad as well. $22 million a seed round for security. First, interoperability. So another bridge type interoperability play. Really cool. All that money going to the space.
00:54:22.014 - 00:54:39.102, Speaker B: Speaking of all that money that's pouring into crypto, there are a lot of job opportunities pouring into crypto as well. We got a ton of them listed on the bankless jobs board. This is our time of the week to remind you to get a job in crypto. If you already haven't. It's the best place to work. It's fantastic. Let me read out some jobs.
00:54:39.102 - 00:54:47.410, Speaker B: I don't know what David's doing. He's leaving his desk. I think he's afraid to dance. No, he's doing the background dance. There we go. Jobs. Bankless newsletter editor number one content manager at Tally.
00:54:47.410 - 00:54:59.258, Speaker B: A director of developer relations at Vallus. A solidity architect. Aloo. A marketing manager at Misha. A UX designer, Prometheus research Labs. A community manager of Degen Dogs club. God, that sounds cool.
00:54:59.258 - 00:55:14.158, Speaker B: Co founder for an innovative omnichain defi protocol TBD mystery project. Blockchain engineer, Masari. Software engineer, Masari. Operations manager, Syndica. Senior product designer. Smart Defi senior go rust. Engineer syndicate senior full stack engineer syndicate.
00:55:14.158 - 00:55:24.306, Speaker B: Senior software engineer. Airdrop Labs. Oh, my God. There's so many. Product manager, crypto. Nori, a bankless web developer at bankless. Go check him out.
00:55:24.306 - 00:55:35.830, Speaker B: Man. That was a lot. David, you come back now. We got through all the jobs. We can move on now. People getting hired in crypto, it's a beautiful thing. You want to get to news?
00:55:35.980 - 00:55:50.826, Speaker A: Here's the sad face. News. Should have been expecting it. I get optimistic every single time. But the merge, according to Tim Baco, won't be in June, but will likely be a few months after. Of course, no firm date yet. There never was.
00:55:50.826 - 00:56:08.990, Speaker A: You can't call it a delay because there was never a date in the first place. People will call it a delay, though, just because there are expectations. People are like, ooh, June, June, June. And then Tim's like, nope, still not June. And then get kicked out a couple more months. And so August. August.
00:56:09.150 - 00:56:16.360, Speaker B: I'll do it again. You saying dates because you have to. I mean, there is no date, right? It's going to happen this year, though, isn't it?
00:56:16.730 - 00:56:18.040, Speaker A: 2022.
00:56:20.730 - 00:56:51.898, Speaker B: Right, Tim, I got the Gandalf meme here. Ethereum, devs right now with Gandalf face, the merge is never late. It arrives precisely when it means to. I think that's what the devs. That's what the devs are communicating. It's like, hey, guys, don't ever say a date again, okay? I feel like dates work through social consensus as well, is somebody says, oh, these things lead me to believe the date is x. It never comes from developers who are saying these dates unless it's, like, imminent.
00:56:51.898 - 00:57:27.130, Speaker B: And then the community rallies around that date and is like, yeah, it must be date x. And then someone gets a hold of it and it gets projected out further and further, and then everyone's saying June before long. But to be fair, developers never said June in the first place. They do not give dates. But, of course, we always like to ask, and I don't know, it feels like, what did Tim say? What are the exact words? Let's parse through this Jerome Powell thing. No firm date yet, but we're definitely in the final chapter. It won't be June, but likely in the few months.
00:57:27.130 - 00:57:29.740, Speaker B: After a few months, what's few to you? Is that three?
00:57:30.270 - 00:57:37.310, Speaker A: Yeah, three at best. You probably got to lean. You got to add. So it's not two. It's got at least three. Four. Yeah.
00:57:37.310 - 00:57:42.266, Speaker A: October. October. So much time to stack Halloween.
00:57:42.458 - 00:57:56.334, Speaker B: Gonna launch on Halloween, guys. Anyway is what it is. Keep moving forward. More time to stack eth. All right. Maker and Maple, a partnership to scale the digital economy. What is this partnership? David? Two D five protocols teaming up.
00:57:56.392 - 00:58:30.058, Speaker A: Yeah, this is super simple. The Maker Dow's D three m, the die direct module allows maker to mint Dai in specific liquidity pools. They have this with Ave. So Ave has the power to mint die directly as needed. This ability is now being sended to Maple finance. Maple Finance is a under collateralized institution lending defi app. So money like liquidity for institutions, trusted institutions who use their reputation as collateral and now is being hooked into maker so they can go and straight and mint die straight from the maker protocol.
00:58:30.234 - 00:58:38.370, Speaker B: Nice. Good protocol. Mashup. Good team up. NFT news. I'm going to start here. Do you know Mark Zuckerberg? He's creating this metaverse thing.
00:58:38.370 - 00:59:15.914, Speaker B: He wants to charge people 50% commission on nfts sold in the metaverse. It's actually like 47 point something percent. And this is basically kind of the App Store model. You know how Apple charges 30% and everything. It seems like meta and Mark and the team over there think they can just port this model over to the metaverse and over to nfts. And I don't know how he can think that. We definitely do not pay 50% commission to an intermediary on the things we use in crypto on nfts.
00:59:16.042 - 00:59:19.742, Speaker A: Granted, we do pay 2% to openC, 2.5%, right?
00:59:19.796 - 00:59:43.030, Speaker B: So that's something on purchases, and that's probably worth it. But can you command a 50% margin? And even Opensea, you got to anticipate as competition enters, its prices will erode. Because OpenC doesn't actually own the nfts. Right? It's all like registered on chain, so it's going to erode over time as well. What do you think of this? Do they just not understand the business model of this web3 thing?
00:59:43.180 - 01:00:10.320, Speaker A: Maybe there's part of the story that we're not familiar with, but also maybe just people are like, oh, yeah, I'll pay 50% to not get scammed by web3. Maybe that's the take here. But at the same time, all this whole web two, doing web3 things is going to, as people get more and more comfortable with it, they're going to realize, like, why am I paying Mark Zuckerberg such high rent? I'm going to go do it for free in web3. And maybe this is going to be a positive pr move for web3 over time, maybe.
01:00:10.690 - 01:00:20.814, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll have to see how that plays out. It just feels like that is so incongruous to egregious. It doesn't match. It's a misbehavior.
01:00:20.862 - 01:00:23.566, Speaker A: 50% rent fee on anything is egregious.
01:00:23.758 - 01:00:41.690, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I can't believe we still pay 30% in the App Store. This is cool. Aboard Apes Yacht club restaurant is just launched. You know what's cool about this? So this is the restaurant itself. You know what's cool about this is this guy, I presume, owns the board ape himself, right?
01:00:41.760 - 01:00:42.090, Speaker A: Sure.
01:00:42.160 - 01:01:18.018, Speaker B: And what I was thinking about is the license guarantees to the board ape owners. Basically they get to profit on use of their ape in whatever they choose. You could put it on a t shirt and profit. That way you could open up a restaurant and profit. That way you could sell license to it in a movie. So what's cool about this is kind of an entrepreneur gets use of the NFT that he purchased for some sort of commercial gain. And this is different than the Creative common license, right? Because if you have Creative Commons, anyone can do this.
01:01:18.018 - 01:01:27.534, Speaker B: Like your Mfers. My MFers, anyone can launch a store, put your MF, or in a movie without asking your permission, because that's Creative Commons.
01:01:27.602 - 01:01:28.426, Speaker A: Please do.
01:01:28.608 - 01:01:52.670, Speaker B: But board apes are more restrictive and they provide the owner of the NFT themselves with the actual license, ability and rights. So it's different. It's just like, I like how these two experiments are playing out. Like, I have probably preferences and I think some models will be more successful than others. But you got to admit that this is kind of a cool use of an NFT.
01:01:53.570 - 01:02:00.466, Speaker A: Yes, I guess. But also at the same time, what does the ape have anything to do with a restaurant? Right?
01:02:00.488 - 01:02:02.740, Speaker B: Oh, I have no idea if the restaurant will be.
01:02:03.430 - 01:02:10.790, Speaker A: If you're looking at like, all right, where do I want to get lunch? I'm hungry for cheeseburgers. Going to the ape aspect thing have anything to do with your decision making?
01:02:10.860 - 01:02:11.794, Speaker B: It doesn't look cringe.
01:02:11.842 - 01:02:14.360, Speaker A: Actually boost the value of the restaurant, though.
01:02:14.890 - 01:02:24.074, Speaker B: Yeah, this is like, the restaurant itself is maybe sort of a strange pick for this, but I don't know, plush toys. I don't know, something could hit. I don't know.
01:02:24.112 - 01:02:24.474, Speaker A: I guess.
01:02:24.512 - 01:02:30.686, Speaker B: So let's talk about this, the story. Yeah. So what's happening?
01:02:30.788 - 01:03:06.274, Speaker A: Yeah. Coinbase is creating an interactive three part film featuring the board, ape yacht club and apecoin communities. So a film about apes and the ape universe with Coinbase called the DGen trilogy interactive film. Maybe that's like the whole choose your own adventure type film that Netflix did not too long ago. And also Shimbuya from people pleasers building. Maybe that's what's going on here. But, yeah, again, the ape brand, that's what people should, I really think should take away is that basically NFTs are just brands.
01:03:06.274 - 01:03:12.678, Speaker A: That's what they are. The Ape brand is really, really strong. So now there's a restaurant ape brand and now there is a movie ape brand.
01:03:12.774 - 01:03:21.178, Speaker B: It's basically a brand brand manager, a community and some capital. That's, to me, what an NFT is like, an NFT community is.
01:03:21.264 - 01:03:31.646, Speaker A: But also my bear case for that is for anyone that doesn't own an ape NFT, they're not incentivized to go watch the movie. They're actually kind of disincentivized a little.
01:03:31.668 - 01:03:33.902, Speaker B: Bit because they're kind of cringed out by it. A little bit.
01:03:33.956 - 01:03:34.766, Speaker A: A little bit cringed out.
01:03:34.788 - 01:03:35.934, Speaker B: But I don't have an ape.
01:03:35.982 - 01:03:39.730, Speaker A: Yeah, right. I don't care about your community. I'm not going to go watch your stupid movie.
01:03:41.030 - 01:03:54.950, Speaker B: That's true. I do think that some of these things could actually flop in weird way. I don't know. It all depends on the brand management of it. There's a lot of dependencies here. It's going to be really interesting to see these things play out. Here's an experiment that didn't play out so well.
01:03:55.020 - 01:03:55.510, Speaker A: Oh, God.
01:03:55.580 - 01:04:17.806, Speaker B: So this guy, crypto entrepreneur, purchased Jack Dorsey's first ever tweet. The first time Jack Dorsey logged on into Twitter, 2006, he tweeted something. He purchased it as an NFT for $2.9 million. A jpeg of the tweet. I wonder if you could see what it looks like. Actually, let me pull it up.
01:04:17.908 - 01:04:25.550, Speaker A: The tweet was from scent and the tweet was something along the lines of just trying out my Twitter account. Tweeted from Jack. It was the first tweet ever.
01:04:25.700 - 01:04:37.982, Speaker B: Just trying out my Twitter account. Anyway, he paid $2.9 million for it. And then David, he went to go sell it. So he's like, I kind of want to sell it. I'm going to auction it out. I'm going to give some proceeds to charity.
01:04:37.982 - 01:04:57.786, Speaker B: He thought he'd be able to sell maybe $25 million NFT space. I bought it for 2.9. It's got to appreciate in value, I guess. The closing bid, the last bid, he got $280 for an NFT. He paid $2.9 million for.
01:04:57.968 - 01:05:03.870, Speaker A: What's the multiplier or the. Oh, God, that's like down point 99.99%.
01:05:04.020 - 01:05:06.622, Speaker B: That is some tax lost harvesting, my friend.
01:05:06.756 - 01:05:08.558, Speaker A: That's a down bad right there.
01:05:08.724 - 01:05:34.680, Speaker B: That's a real down bad. Now, he's probably not going to sell it for that, but it just goes to show you, like, man, you can really get wrecked by nfts. And I think a lot of the success that we read about nfts, for every success you see of somebody making millions of dollars, there has to be like 99 at least failures, probably 999. It's just the survival bias where we always hear about the guy who just made $5 million on an NFT flip, right?
01:05:35.850 - 01:05:47.340, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, I had a take about this. Remember when somebody bought the beeple nft for $69 million? What do you think that's doing on the secondary market?
01:05:47.710 - 01:05:50.074, Speaker B: I have no idea. I have no idea.
01:05:50.272 - 01:05:53.598, Speaker A: Over or under $1 million, I'm going.
01:05:53.604 - 01:06:05.726, Speaker B: To say I would not have departed with my ETh for that purchase. Okay. I would just kept my Eth for that purchase because I think it's an asset that's going to appreciate more than the beeple, but who knows?
01:06:05.838 - 01:06:06.722, Speaker A: That's right. Okay.
01:06:06.776 - 01:06:09.650, Speaker B: Beeple sold his ETh from that, too. A whole big chunk of it.
01:06:09.720 - 01:06:13.154, Speaker A: Yeah. At what price? I think.
01:06:13.272 - 01:06:16.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess maybe he's okay. I don't know.
01:06:16.872 - 01:06:18.514, Speaker A: I think Beeple is doing just.
01:06:18.632 - 01:06:30.990, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm sure he's going to be okay. What's this? There is people taking loans on their nfts now. We've talked about that for a while. It looks like it's happening. This is the biggest one I've seen. Somebody borrowed $8.3 million on their crypto punk.
01:06:30.990 - 01:06:32.374, Speaker B: The value of their cryptopunk.
01:06:32.422 - 01:06:55.994, Speaker A: Yeah. Remember that story of the crypto punk lot that was going to Sotheby's 104 of them and the guy hours before the lot because the cryptopunk floor was, like, plummeting at that time, and he was going to sell 104 cryptopunks, and then he changed his mind last minute. Well, he got liquidity in a different way by borrowing $8.3 million against his 104 cryptopunk loan collateral.
01:06:56.042 - 01:07:01.742, Speaker B: You know what that is? Tax free liquidity, my friend. Another pro tip for you. The tax edition of Bankless.
01:07:01.806 - 01:07:02.862, Speaker A: Don't get liquidated.
01:07:03.006 - 01:07:18.742, Speaker B: Yeah, just don't get liquidated. I'm sure he's fine. So that was a batch of 104 crypto punks. Not just one, obviously, which is why he's getting so much and die denominated, which is kind of cool. All right, let's get to the musk. Watch Elon Musk. He was going to join the board of Twitter last week.
01:07:18.742 - 01:07:24.460, Speaker B: Now this week he's quitting, that he's not joining the board any longer. Something happened. Do you know what happened?
01:07:24.830 - 01:08:00.702, Speaker A: Yeah, Elon, this morning, I believe. Yeah, this morning, Thursday morning, tweets out. I made an offer and then links to an SEC filed document, which is an offer to buy Twitter. Not buy shares of Twitter, buy Twitter, the whole thing for an average for a share price of $54.20, which is a 54% premium over the January 20 closing price, I'm sure. Why the January 20 closing price matters, but, yeah. Valuation of $43 billion.
01:08:00.702 - 01:08:03.510, Speaker A: Musk made an offer to buy Twitter.
01:08:04.250 - 01:08:11.482, Speaker B: How crazy would that be if that happened? So how much is this total? Do we know how much this is?
01:08:11.536 - 01:08:12.266, Speaker A: I don't know.
01:08:12.368 - 01:08:18.940, Speaker B: Oh, $43 billion. David. It's $43 billion. That's only, like, an 8th of a musk. That's not very much.
01:08:21.170 - 01:08:24.990, Speaker A: I'd really like him to stick to the whole rockets and electric cars.
01:08:28.690 - 01:08:33.242, Speaker B: For. Some people think he's going to be really good for Twitter. David, promoting.
01:08:33.306 - 01:08:39.010, Speaker A: I think Elon Musk has the potential to be really good for planet Earth and Twitter doesn't really have that same potential.
01:08:39.590 - 01:08:45.010, Speaker B: Interesting. As a Twitter power user yourself, are you not bullish on Twitter?
01:08:45.350 - 01:08:53.590, Speaker A: I would like the planet to not dive climate change and also for the humans to become an interstellar species, and Twitter is not doing anything in those regards.
01:08:55.450 - 01:08:59.702, Speaker B: Stick to what you know, Elon. That's what David's saying. Like, you're really good at some things. Go focus.
01:08:59.836 - 01:09:00.694, Speaker A: Tweet a lot.
01:09:00.812 - 01:09:08.598, Speaker B: But he'd have to outbid Justin's son, though, apparently. Justin's son is offering $60 per share. Is this real? Is this a real tweet?
01:09:08.694 - 01:09:22.810, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a real tweet for Justin's son is a one upping Elon musk. I tweeted out Justin sun, the me too founder of the world. Just like, oh, notice me offering $60 a share. I don't know if Justin sun has that much money. Pretty sure he doesn't.
01:09:22.890 - 01:09:37.426, Speaker B: If he does, it makes me very sad, because I know. Yeah, but that's a please notice me type take. Anyway, we'll see. We'll see if that happens next week. It could totally change next week. Maybe. Elon spying, Facebook or something.
01:09:37.426 - 01:10:10.846, Speaker B: We'll have to see. All right, switching gears for a minute, we got to update you guys on the axie Infinity hacker. Remember the hacker that stole hundreds of millions of dollars worth of eth from the Axie Infinity bridge to the ronin sidechain? Well, we're curious what he's doing with all of that money. How this hacker, he, she, they are exiting the system. This is a tweet from Watcher guru, somebody watching all of these accounts. Axio Infinity hacker has so far laundered 7.5% of the stolen Ethereum using tornado cash.
01:10:10.846 - 01:10:20.254, Speaker B: Tornado cash to launder it, which is, of course, sort of a privacy coin mixer, I might say tumbler on Ethereum. So what does this mean, David?
01:10:20.382 - 01:10:41.014, Speaker A: Yeah, so when you put your Ether into tornado cash, you can do it, I think, in lots of 110 and 100 ether. And then all of those get bundled up together, and then you sit and just let it steep and stew because people are putting in ether, people are pulling out ether. So you wait some period of time and then you pull it out the other side, and no one really knows who.
01:10:41.052 - 01:10:42.454, Speaker B: You get lost in the crowd, basically.
01:10:42.572 - 01:10:52.186, Speaker A: Exactly. Lost in the crowd. Right. 7.5% of one of the largest hacks in DFI ever is a significant amount of ether. And so. So I asked the question to Twitter.
01:10:52.186 - 01:11:30.534, Speaker A: It's like, well, imagine, for example, you put in 50% of all the ether inside of tornado cash. We know exactly how much ether is in tornado cash. We just don't know whose it is. So I tweeted out, can some dune analytics wizard tell me what percent of ETH in tornado cash this is because if the hacker puts all of their ETH into tornado cash, and then your wallet withdraws ETH from tornado cash, you could be pinned. Like, oh, maybe you're the hacker, right? Because so much of the ether is tainted. But as it turns out, the Ronan hack was 173,000 ether, 7.5% of that they deposited ether from the hacker is 13,000 ether.
01:11:30.534 - 01:11:51.454, Speaker A: Total ether in tornado cash. Ryan? 180,000. So that's about 7.5 ish percent of all tornado cash ether. So actually, 7.5% of that hack is actually pretty below the threshold. There's a nice graph that actually shows the very large deposit into tornado cash.
01:11:51.454 - 01:12:14.040, Speaker A: You might have it pulled it up in the next tab. So, yeah, you can see all the inputs and outputs, the red spikes, the green spikes going into tornado cash. And it turns out tornado cash has enough liquidity to hide a pretty sizable amount of ether. And so tornado cash is averaging 6.6 thousand ether per day in withdrawals, which is up significantly from, according to this tweet from where it was a couple of weeks ago.
01:12:16.570 - 01:12:44.660, Speaker B: Well, what do you think about this? I'm surprised we haven't heard the Elizabeth Warrens of the world talking about this. Maybe ethereum, bucking ethereum, the whole mix as basically a money laundering protocol. And see, this is how criminals can escape with cash, right, and privacy on chain. Privacy is bad. And the chain analysis of the world, maybe they can see into this thing, but maybe they can't. What do you think about that?
01:12:47.270 - 01:12:52.786, Speaker A: Privacy is a human right, but this is also a money laundering tool.
01:12:52.888 - 01:12:56.758, Speaker B: So there's that mixed, right, mixed reviews here.
01:12:56.924 - 01:13:06.070, Speaker A: Technology is inherently neutral. It's about how it's used. But privacy as a human right comes before anti money laundering efforts.
01:13:07.370 - 01:13:47.398, Speaker B: If you choose to prioritize privacy, then you kind of have to take the good with the bad. Isn't there just a fundamental trade off here that society has, by the way, this is not a crazy trade off. We've had this in cash forever, and this hasn't caused the downfall, collapse of society. Right. Still, the ability to find these criminals via other means without eroding the privacy of every individual citizen and knowing exactly what they own and exactly who they are. So it's something I feel like the crypto industry has to get stronger on. But I do also feel like it's a losing battle in the political sound bite game where somebody would be like, oh, yeah, and then they just laundered all this money through tornado cash, the money laundering tool.
01:13:47.398 - 01:14:29.470, Speaker B: And then pretty soon, everyone who's ever used tornado cash just to obfuscate their identity for legitimate reasons, non criminal reasons, they're painted in the same brush. So if you're using a privacy protocol at all, well, you must be a criminal rather than you just want to preserve your actual on chain privacy. And, yeah, that's a slippery slope because then exchanges start blacklisting any address that's interacted with tornado cash, you can imagine something like this happening, and then the only outlet for you is decentralized defi type protocols that have no ability to blacklist. Right. So this is why all of these things are very important, I think. But it's a complex subject.
01:14:29.630 - 01:15:03.122, Speaker A: Yeah. Bitcoin has proof of work as its big Achilles heel in its narrative. I think privacy on Ethereum, because tornado cash is actually a pretty inferior form of privacy. Aztec technology, ZK roll up, which is not just not ZK roll up, but zero knowledge proof technology like the aztec layer two is going to be a completely private layer. Technology or the privacy tools on Ethereum are only going to get orders of magnitude better, more secure, more private and more usable. This is going to be our narrative Achilles heel. This is going to be the attack vector for Ethereum is privacy.
01:15:03.286 - 01:15:20.994, Speaker B: I think it's privacy in general. Yes. And bitcoin has no privacy. In fact, there's a whole really interesting discussion which I don't think crypto could have gotten as far as it has gotten to this point without nation state kind of choking the baby in the crib. If it had privacy on the base.
01:15:21.032 - 01:15:28.680, Speaker A: Layer, there's a reason why Monero is not on any exchange, but also lightning network Ryan is private. As a private technology.
01:15:29.370 - 01:15:53.878, Speaker B: That's definitely a trade off and something that we're going to have to discuss with the regulators in the future. All right, guys, we're going to burn through a few more things near. They are launching an algo stablecoin on the 20 April called USN. This is going to be like UST for Terra. So other alternative layer ones joining the space there to compete for Terra. David, what's this hire center, an organization.
01:15:53.974 - 01:16:07.854, Speaker A: Consortium or between circle, between. With USD. And also Coinbase has hired two executives to oversee regulation operations. These are kind of one of our spearheading entities helping us fight the fight and regulation.
01:16:07.902 - 01:16:32.294, Speaker B: So we like to see that more regulatory firepower. Also Celsius. So this is a centralized lending and borrowing project. Exchange, I guess crypto bank, you might call them. Yeah, app similar to Blockfi. They have now made it such that non accredited investors in the US will not be able to deposit new assets into their account. So this happened with Blockfi in February.
01:16:32.294 - 01:17:14.630, Speaker B: This is the SEC coming down on these custodial crypto lending and borrowing protocols and saying, no, can't do that. Not here, not in the US, not to unaccredited investors, not to people who have less than $1 million in assets. So where do we go from here? We move to Defi and also the Celsius and the blockfis of the world seek to become regulated entities so they can start doing this sort of thing. David, let's talk about some more regulatory pressure. And this is coming from an interesting place, a series of class action lawsuits, and this is a new one that dropped to our attention this week. This is a class action lawsuit from a Uniswap user. Are you a uniswap user? If you're listening to bankless, you probably are.
01:17:14.630 - 01:18:00.150, Speaker B: Right? You may have been in the past. This is a Uniswap user that is accusing Uniswap labs of allowing fraudulent activity on its protocol. Okay. And non registered securities, other fraudulent activity. Apparently this user, you can read the entire plaintiff and the complaint, the class action complaint here. This user bought a whole bunch of Uniswap gems, right? Some might call these shit coins in last year, last summer. So, like, june, may of last summer, like stuff like the classics, like good old Ethereum, Max Matrix, Samurai, and Rocketbunny and Boombaby IO.
01:18:00.150 - 01:18:31.166, Speaker B: And if you read the complaint, about ten k was invested in these things, and almost all of them went to zero. Near zero. Right. And so the complaint is that Uniswap allowed this to happen. And so named in the lawsuit is Uniswap Hayden Adams, investors in Uniswap Labs, like a 16 z. Basically everyone they could think of. This is so crazy to me.
01:18:31.166 - 01:18:36.162, Speaker B: David, I have some reactions to this, but I want to hear yours first. What do you think about this?
01:18:36.296 - 01:19:17.742, Speaker A: This feels malicious. This feels like they were doing this with intent in order to smear Uniswap. Right? This is not just, in my opinion, there's perhaps a case to be made that this is not just some innocent person who got some uber driver tips to buy Ethereum, Max, or Rocket bunny, but instead are using this as a way to start targeting DFI legally. It's not the first time we've seen this, Ryan. You'll remember, a number of months ago, somebody deposited $10 into pool together and started suing. Then class action lawsuited pool together for losing money because of the gas fee, Ryan, not because.
01:19:17.796 - 01:19:18.782, Speaker B: Are you kidding me?
01:19:18.836 - 01:19:36.774, Speaker A: The gas fee because they lost money because they paid the gas fee. Class action lawsuit against pull together. This effort is still going on. Now this happens. Same thing. Class action lawsuit against some obvious, like, personally, Ryan, if I lost all my money in Rocket bunny and think about.
01:19:36.812 - 01:19:39.720, Speaker B: My life choices, I wouldn't publicize that.
01:19:41.130 - 01:19:46.758, Speaker A: I would not go publicly with that. And so I think that there's something insipid. Insidious. What's the word?
01:19:46.844 - 01:19:48.454, Speaker B: Insidious? Yeah, insidious. Yeah.
01:19:48.492 - 01:19:53.322, Speaker A: Going on behind the scenes. And I think this story is going to have to be unfolded a little bit more.
01:19:53.376 - 01:19:57.206, Speaker B: You think this is a takedown? An organized defi takedown? Possibly.
01:19:57.318 - 01:19:59.306, Speaker A: I think there's something bad going on.
01:19:59.328 - 01:20:36.054, Speaker B: Here, because how can you possibly blame uniswap, which is a permissionless, decentralized exchange that does not control asset listings at all? Individuals do. How can you possibly blame smart contract code, the developers of smart contract code? This is, to me, this is like blaming the developers of TCPIP for what just happened here. I mean, like, you may as well who originally created the TCPIP protocol that all of the rest of the Internet transacts on. Maybe we can hold them responsible because I lost money on Uniswap or I was scammed from a nigerian prince email.
01:20:36.092 - 01:20:38.650, Speaker A: Or something, or somebody made me mad on Twitter.
01:20:40.830 - 01:21:09.570, Speaker B: It's just absolutely ludicrous. And what I'm worried about is that there might be some, I guess, court precedent that negatively impacts and I guess even best case scenario. Man, these defi projects get tied up in these class action lawsuits anyway. That's why we do what we do. We got to talk about these protocols more and the value of them. Guys, we're going to get into some hot takes of the week, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:21:09.720 - 01:22:03.618, Speaker A: The layer two era is upon us. Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life. Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge with across. You don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer two back to Ethereum, a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum, where community members will decide on the token distribution. You can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a cofounder and helping to design the fair fair launch of a cross if you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely, go to accrop to to bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, arbitrum or Boba networks, the era of proof of stake is upon us and Lido is bringing proof of stake to everyone.
01:22:03.618 - 01:22:33.830, Speaker A: Lido is a decentralized staking protocol that allows users to stake their proof of stake assets using Lido's distributed network of nodes. Don't choose between staking your assets or using them as collateral in Defi. With Lido, you can have both. Using lido, you can stake any amount of your ETH to the Lido validating network and receive ST ETH in return. ST ETH can be traded, used as collateral for lending and borrowing, or leveraged on your favorite Defi protocols. All this without giving up your EtH to centralized staking services or exchanges. Lido now supports Terra Solana, Kusama and Polygon staking.
01:22:33.830 - 01:23:04.594, Speaker A: Whatever your preferred proof of stake asset is, Lido is here to take away the complexities of staking while enabling you to get liquidity on your stake. If you want to stake your EtH, terra Sol or matic and get liquidity on your stake. Go to lido fi to get started. That's Lido fi to get started. Living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys. And that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet. And brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the Ledger Nanos Plus, a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet.
01:23:04.594 - 01:23:39.406, Speaker A: With more memory and a larger screen, the Nanos plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions. And the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your NFT. What you see is what you sign. The Nanos plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things. So go to the Ledger website to check out the features of the new Ledger Nanos plus and join the waitlist to get yours. And don't forget about the crypto life card. Also powered by Ledger, the CL card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app, right next to all the defi apps and services that you're already used to doing like swapping tokens and staking.
01:23:39.406 - 01:23:45.570, Speaker A: So if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet, go to ledger.com, grab a ledger and take control over your crypto.
01:23:45.990 - 01:23:53.286, Speaker B: Alright guys, we're back with the takes of the week. This is one from Dan Price about taxes. That's the theme of this episode. David, what's this say?
01:23:53.388 - 01:24:11.340, Speaker A: Yeah, Dan Price says every other country. Here are your taxes. Does this look okay? America version Turbotax and H R block lobbied Congress. So you have to pay them hundreds of dollars and pull together all of the paperwork the government already has on you to file your taxes manually. Remindor that this is the state that we are in.
01:24:11.790 - 01:24:14.686, Speaker B: Yes, it's sad, sick, everyone that is.
01:24:14.708 - 01:24:18.160, Speaker A: Stressing out over taxes. You can thank Turbotax and h r block. Thank you.
01:24:19.490 - 01:24:44.230, Speaker B: So IRS and Congress, I suppose this is a question I've had in my mind. David, I'm going to just ask, but it's really this question we've talked about in some bankless shows. But are there going to be local or global winners for Defi? Right? And a global winner is like one kind of lending and borrowing protocol that establishes some sort of power law network effect, like say Aave and gets deployed across all of the chains, for example.
01:24:44.300 - 01:24:46.130, Speaker A: That would be avalanche, phantom.
01:24:46.290 - 01:25:34.322, Speaker B: All of the chains. Right? And it'd be ave this is the winner of lending and borrowing, for example, or compound or something like this, the local version of things, is no. Every single chain ecosystem will have its own automated market maker and lending and borrowing protocols. So like on avalanche they'll have Trader Joe, and on Ethereum you might have Uniswap, and on polygon you might have a quick swap or something like this. This has been a big question in my mind, because it's like a question of how do you invest? Do you invest with the big ones, or do you have to look for winners across every single chain? So I asked this question. Do you guys think there will be local winners or global winners? A few good responses here. The majority seemed to indicate that global winners would win, which was kind of my inclination.
01:25:34.322 - 01:25:40.230, Speaker B: But this guy Hildabi actually provided some data behind this. You want to read this tweet out?
01:25:40.300 - 01:26:13.022, Speaker A: Yeah. Stats following Uniswap's arrival on polygon leads me to believe that user stickiness will lead to global winners. In my opinion, the average user sticks to what he or she is familiar with, but it will be interesting to see how things develop. And then he gives a graph that shows how dominant Uniswap is across all the dexes on polygon. One asterisk on this is that if you're using polygon, you're more likely to be an Ethereum user. And if you're an Ethereum user, you're likely to be a uniswap user. Going across a different ecosystem to solana or avalanche, especially Solana, because Solana is not EVM.
01:26:13.022 - 01:26:21.398, Speaker A: Avalanche is like, maybe there's a different taste because it's a very different user base rather than just a slightly different user base.
01:26:21.484 - 01:26:23.240, Speaker B: So how do you think this shakes out?
01:26:24.330 - 01:26:36.774, Speaker A: I think the Uniswap branding is very, very strong. Also that technology is very, very strong as well. Like Uniswap V three is robust. Right. It's hard to compete with that. And so I think that lends itself to global winners.
01:26:36.902 - 01:27:03.540, Speaker B: I think we might have like a combo too. But you know how in countries, right, there's like sort of the Google of China, for example, for various reasons, some countries have their own flavors of this. I think you'll see some of that too. But then you'll also see some big global power law winners. There might be some geographic boundaries in these chains here that we don't see. Like maybe EVM versus non EVM is one of them.
01:27:03.990 - 01:27:07.598, Speaker A: I think that's right. It'll be interesting leaning towards global winners.
01:27:07.694 - 01:27:08.340, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:27:10.470 - 01:27:16.882, Speaker A: I could see there being global winners amongst all EVM chains and all non EVM chains having their own local winners.
01:27:16.946 - 01:27:22.620, Speaker B: Yeah, that's one possibility for sure. This is an Eric Wall tweet. What's he saying here?
01:27:22.990 - 01:28:01.602, Speaker A: He's taken a screenshot and the screenshot is of other tweets and the first person says, the gas fees on Avalanche are getting ridiculous. Somebody follows that up saying, yes, a transaction previously cost me. That's a 10,000% increase. I'm not sure on the math on that one. And then Eric Wall retweets this, saying, obviously the solution is an EVM fork, which poses the question, what is the model of scaling that the crypto industry is going to have every time a layer one blockchain gets full, are we going to get expensive? Gets expensive, get full, same same. Are we going to a one? Just spin up another layer one blockchain. That's an EVM fork.
01:28:01.602 - 01:28:23.870, Speaker A: Like another geth fork. Spin that out as blockchain, raise a bunch of vc cash. Or when a layer one blockchain gets full, do you just spin up another layer two? Which model of scaling is the industry going to go in? And lots of people in this, and this is, I feel like the question of 2021 and now going into 2022, how will the crypto industry scale? Will we put out more layer ones or will we put out more layer twos?
01:28:24.610 - 01:29:36.194, Speaker B: I do think that these are the two models, David, and I want to get to your post that you published this week about one of the models. But basically the two models are, are we going to live in this world of interconnected side chains with their own validator set, so none that are really like market dominant, just a whole bunch of new side chains that we keep spinning up all with their own defense and security spend? Or are we going to live more in a world of something like ethereum, where there's one modular chain that kind of provides economic security for a whole bunch of other layer twos? And the dichotomy here that I've heard, which is kind of an analog to the real world, is will we live in a world of many nation states with providing their own security, or will we live in a world with empires and maybe some dominant empires, some modular blockchains that kind of provide security for spheres of influence, if you will, territories, states, provinces and alliances with other countries? So you wrote about this, I think, in your post, the empire model for blockchains. And what's the argument that you're making?
01:29:36.312 - 01:29:51.260, Speaker A: Yeah, the argument I'm making is that if you are not playing to be the number one spot, then you are not playing. And I think the evidence for why this is going to be an empire model of a blockchain network rather than, you said nation states, ryan. But I think the alternative model is like, many, many city states.
01:29:52.590 - 01:29:55.402, Speaker B: Yes, that's what I meant. City states, not nation states.
01:29:55.456 - 01:30:25.950, Speaker A: Yeah. So rather like one dominant nation that blankets the whole world with their blockchain. Right. I think the Ethereum empire model, the many, many layer twos model is going to be the dominant one. And the interoperable side chains, a network of side chains where avalanche is the side chain to Ethereum, which is a side chain to Solana, which is a side chain to avalanche. There's a mesh network of sidechains that doesn't make sense. And people know this subconsciously in the tribalism and the fighting that happens on crypto Twitter.
01:30:25.950 - 01:30:45.002, Speaker A: The reason why we fight, the reason why crypto Twitter is tribal is because we all, at least subconsciously, some people consciously know this. And I'm trying to get people to consciously know it, which is why I wrote the article. We subconsciously know this is true. And that's why we are tribal, because we all want to be the number one spot. We all want our blockchain to be the number one thing.
01:30:45.056 - 01:30:46.858, Speaker B: We all know. We're playing the empire game.
01:30:46.944 - 01:31:17.806, Speaker A: We are all playing the empire game. Liquidity begets liquidity. Capital begets capital. Network effects begets network effects. And the number one blockchain claims all of these things. This is also just completely rational in game theory, because if you aren't, if you're fighting to be a good side chain, to be interoperable with other good side chains, you're going to lose to the blockchain that's fighting to be the. And in the last six months, over a billion dollars has been hacked.
01:31:17.806 - 01:31:45.150, Speaker A: Ryan, in what? In cross chain bridges, insecure bridges. Bridges are going to be the next big attack vector. And layer two, cryptographic bridges are always going to be more secure than cross chain multisig bridges. And so an empire model where there's one layer one with many, many layer twos that come to blanket the earth is fundamentally more secure than a poly cross chain, layer one model, I think, you know.
01:31:45.220 - 01:32:15.560, Speaker B: So, first of all, I would say bitcoiners acknowledge this and realize about bitcoin. This is why they fight hard. I think the Ethereum community doesn't so much, and I think they might cringe a little bit in the framing of this and I think spicy wood. I think the reason they do, though, David, is because they're used to empires. The nation state, analog of empire by conquest. That's how you go build an empire in the nation state world. You have to go conquer another set of peoples and take from them.
01:32:15.560 - 01:32:48.210, Speaker B: But this is not empire by conquest. This is empire by opt in. This is empire by conquest opt in. Right? And so basically the model is, oh, rather than spending, if I'm a side chain, a question. Rather than spending for my own economic security and spending, by the way, I have to inflate my token supply. It's really expensive. People don't look at this very often, but I know you and I look at this a lot, which is how much are chains actually spending in blockchain issuance for their security? And it's a whole lot of money to maintain that level of security.
01:32:48.210 - 01:33:36.926, Speaker B: Instead of doing that, why don't I just outsource my security? Want to opt into the Ethereum federation? I'll just have Ethereum protect, you know, I like that ecosystem. I'm EvM whatever. Like there's a lot of network effects. So let me just build that bridge and I'll become a roll up rather than a side chain, right? It seems to me, and again, it's not opt in. No one in Ethereum went and conquered that side chain. It was just basically like, oh, I'm looking at the economics of this and I'm trying to make the most rational decision, and so I'm going to become a subsidiary of Ethereum. Now, I do think that that model has got to be, that's sort of the model that we've seen play out in the conquest world of nation states where we don't have a whole bunch of Singapores and Hong Kong's.
01:33:36.926 - 01:34:06.730, Speaker B: It's like former, like we don't have a bunch of city states, we have some pretty dominant nation state empires. Maybe we have multiple. That could also be the case, and it is the case now, but there will probably be some eras and power law winners in more dominant empires. And I do think that is the quiet part that the Ethereum community doesn't say out loud. When you enter the we're fighting for monetary premium game, you necessarily enter that game of like, I guess opt in Empire building.
01:34:06.880 - 01:34:47.894, Speaker A: And there's so much evidence as to why this is the right model, because this is the model of coordination. Ever since humans stopped being hunter gatherers and we started being settlers and we actually created civilizations with property, we started this coordination game of who pays taxes to who, right? Like who can have the monopoly on violence. And in the blockchain world, it's who can have the strongest security. But in the physical world, a monopoly on violence is like, all right, whoever has the largest military gets to control the global reserve currency. In the blockchain world, it's whichever blockchain has the best security, has the best money properties of that layer one.
01:34:48.092 - 01:34:56.010, Speaker B: Okay. I would just also say to that, though, what you just said and what I just said, nine out of ten vcs disagree with that.
01:34:56.080 - 01:35:03.754, Speaker A: Yes, maybe ten because they're incentivized for as many layer one blockchains as possible because it's vc service area, maybe playground.
01:35:03.882 - 01:35:47.766, Speaker B: Yes, that's what you might say, but let's flip that around. I think it's worth steel manning. Their argument and basically more the steel man is they don't believe that security and defense, economic security of the chain is kind of the number one property. They would prioritize user experience, for example, far higher. And user experience is associated with low gas fees as well. And if you have to make lots of trade offs on security, decentralization, security people forget what decentralization is. It's good to remind people it's an anticorruption technology, so it helps preserve it, helps keep the cancer at bay.
01:35:47.766 - 01:36:16.302, Speaker B: It's like the white blood cells fighting the cancer in the spread in the body of the system. Okay. And they'll make some trade offs there where they'll introduce more potential for future corruption in exchange for usability. And they'll say that that's what users actually care about. It's the user experience, it's not the security. And so it's not the highest. People don't care one vc, put it this way, people don't care about what chain they're interacting with for security reasons.
01:36:16.302 - 01:36:43.934, Speaker B: They care about risk more. It's like, what's the risk? And so risk and security are related, but it's not one to one. There could be secure chains that have risk in other ways, and so they want to minimize risk over the long run. So I think a VC would push back on that and be like, hey, it's not actually a battle for maximum security, David. It's actually a battle for network effect and utility and user experience because that's going to drive the most users and the most liquidity over the long run.
01:36:44.052 - 01:36:52.218, Speaker A: Yep. And I highly encourage people. Please go read this article. It's one of my favorites that I've written in a long time. Link in the show notes.
01:36:52.314 - 01:36:57.278, Speaker B: That's cool. All right, man, those are the takes. But what are you excited about this week? You liking Brooklyn? Is that exciting?
01:36:57.374 - 01:37:30.790, Speaker A: Dude, I'm loving Brooklyn. There's a dao meetup that I'm going to later today with just like, seeing just a list of the invitees, like, oh, these are all my friends. This is, gosh, I never had this in San Diego or really any other time ever. And so just going to be in where dows are being built, where the metaverse is being built here at the epicenter of it all, which is Brooklyn. Williamsburg is really exciting. There's a boys club meetup that I'm going to later today, Ryan, which is also going to be lovely. And they're at the same time, so I have to party hop, and it's a Thursday, so that's going to be really exciting.
01:37:30.790 - 01:37:35.806, Speaker A: I'm still walking around Brooklyn deciding what part of it I'm trying to find an apartment in, but apparently you're definitely doing it.
01:37:35.828 - 01:37:36.590, Speaker B: You're making a move.
01:37:36.660 - 01:37:37.694, Speaker A: Oh, I'm doing it. Yeah.
01:37:37.812 - 01:37:41.790, Speaker B: Unless, look, next week, though, you're going to Amsterdam. What if you fall in love with a different city?
01:37:41.940 - 01:38:03.618, Speaker A: Oh, gosh, I don't know. I could fall in love with Amsterdam. I still love America. I mean, Amsterdam's got web, three people too, but nothing like Brooklyn and Williamsburg, right? Williamsburg is the epicenter of the metaverse. It's like where the metaverse has its link to the real world because everyone that's building the Metaverse lives here. And so it's like the metaverse instantiate in Williamsburg.
01:38:03.714 - 01:38:06.600, Speaker B: David's starting to sound like a Brooklyn maximalist here.
01:38:07.530 - 01:38:21.210, Speaker A: I never, ever, Ryan thought I'd ever live on the east coast, but here I am. But then you're also. Yeah. Off to Amsterdam on Saturday for Devconnect. I said this a couple, like, I last roll up. Probably the nerdiest conference that I'm ever going to go to.
01:38:21.280 - 01:38:30.250, Speaker B: We're going to talk about Nerdier than, what's it called? Am I thinking of conference east, Denver? No, no. Defcon.
01:38:30.410 - 01:38:32.190, Speaker A: Oh, well, I've never been to a so.
01:38:32.260 - 01:38:33.002, Speaker B: Oh, you haven't?
01:38:33.066 - 01:38:34.430, Speaker A: No. Never been to a con.
01:38:34.500 - 01:38:35.298, Speaker B: Are you going this?
01:38:35.384 - 01:38:51.894, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. In Columbia in October. I will be excited for that one on a future roll up. But this roll up is Devconnect in Amsterdam. Going to be modular blockchain talk. There's going to be eth staking talk. There's going to be a shared secret validator from oval network talk.
01:38:51.894 - 01:38:55.414, Speaker A: Oh, my God. I'm just going to just geek out. It's going to be great.
01:38:55.452 - 01:38:56.358, Speaker B: A lot of geek energy.
01:38:56.444 - 01:39:00.314, Speaker A: A lot of geek energy bigly and also good to see Anthony Cesano. It's going to be great to see him.
01:39:00.432 - 01:39:01.226, Speaker B: That's good.
01:39:01.328 - 01:39:02.860, Speaker A: Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:39:03.390 - 01:39:12.406, Speaker B: Okay, so bankless registered for a trademark of the bankless name about a year ago, and we finally got that back and we have the trademark.
01:39:12.518 - 01:39:14.526, Speaker A: I don't have my soundboard, but I.
01:39:14.548 - 01:39:44.198, Speaker B: Know it's pretty cool. So what's neat about this is when we get some time, I'm excited to try some on chain experiments with this thing. Right. So what is a trademark? It's just a registration in a country, in a nation state or a set of countries that no one else can use this mark for a particular purpose. Like no one else can use the bankless brand for a particular purpose. Bankless has always been somewhat of a headless brand. You and I are kind of spearheading the movement a little bit.
01:39:44.198 - 01:40:41.154, Speaker B: I'm really excited about how we could bring this trademark, maybe on chain and set the Dow loose on it. Right. So what if you could basically create a non revocable license for the DaO and participants of the Dow to use this trademark? So, for example, what if you could create a smart contract that was controlled by a snapshot vote, and the snapshot vote could vote on which new entity would get rights to the trademark and be able to use the bankless brand or not. You could revoke that or approve that via a bank Dow token. Snapshot vote. Like, how cool would that be? Or what if you had to hold a certain amount of bank tokens and stake them or do something like this in order to use that mark, use that trademark? I don't know. There's a lot of cool things, and I'm excited to because what is a trademark? It's just like a nation state smart contract.
01:40:41.154 - 01:40:56.958, Speaker B: It's a contract with the nation state. And so can we tie that into. Yeah, it's an NFT. So can we create that, instantiate that on chain, create kind of an integration layer here? So anyway, that's kind of Nerdy stuff, but I'm excited to talk to some crypto smart contract experts and see what we could do there.
01:40:57.044 - 01:41:06.526, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lot of potential there. For those who don't know, go to Instagram and type in bankless. Bankless HQ will show up, but so will like 50 other flavors of bankless bank.
01:41:06.558 - 01:41:08.734, Speaker B: Bankless France, Brazil, bank bankless Brazil.
01:41:08.782 - 01:41:17.022, Speaker A: Those guys are killing it. Bankless Russia. Like bankless Romania. Even some relatively small countries have a bankless.
01:41:17.086 - 01:41:27.062, Speaker B: There's podcast in Portuguese under the bankless name. All sorts of things. And I would love to kind of usher them into the bankless family even more officially through use of this.
01:41:27.196 - 01:41:31.754, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. So nice find. Nice nft find cool stuff.
01:41:31.792 - 01:41:42.010, Speaker B: Nft. Thank you, us government. Cheers. But you know what? Meme of the week, I guess. Thank you, us government again. Or maybe not so much. Taxes were brutal, man.
01:41:42.010 - 01:41:46.110, Speaker B: It's tax week, so we got to end with these. What's this tweet that we're looking at?
01:41:46.180 - 01:41:59.540, Speaker A: This is a relatively niche tweet, but it's one boxer standing up, ready to go be like, okay, all right, I'm going to file these taxes. Let's do this. And then the next scene is him sitting down, drinking water goes, damn, filing that extension was easy.
01:42:00.310 - 01:42:02.334, Speaker B: You can get an extension to October.
01:42:02.382 - 01:42:07.202, Speaker A: You can file those, but only for filing taxes. You still got to pay.
01:42:07.336 - 01:42:08.374, Speaker B: Yeah, you still got to pay.
01:42:08.412 - 01:42:11.640, Speaker A: You can't file extension to pay later.
01:42:12.330 - 01:42:19.080, Speaker B: That's awesome. David, you are schooled up on all this stuff, man. This is another. How do you think I did this? It's amazing.
01:42:19.530 - 01:42:21.206, Speaker A: How do you think I know these things?
01:42:21.388 - 01:42:23.546, Speaker B: Yeah, you've been hanging out with me a little bit.
01:42:23.568 - 01:42:41.360, Speaker A: I think I've come a long way. All right, this next meme is coming from the rug news. It's the onion for crypto. You should be following it because the Twitter account is hilarious. IRS web3 community employees tax strategy. We're finally getting guidance from the IRS. Their guidance is you'll figure it out.
01:42:42.210 - 01:42:49.834, Speaker B: So true. All right, guys, this has been the weekly roll up. This somehow turned into tax week. I don't know how, but we won't be talking about taxes for at least another year. Right, David?
01:42:49.882 - 01:42:51.022, Speaker A: One more year. Yeah.
01:42:51.156 - 01:43:03.474, Speaker B: All right, we're going to leave you with one final moment of Zen. But before we do, gotta tell you this, none of this has been financial advice. It never is. ETH and bitcoin are both risky. So is Defi. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west.
01:43:03.474 - 01:43:10.330, Speaker B: This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot. I wish my taxes paid.
01:43:10.400 - 01:43:15.370, Speaker A: My health care. I wish my taxes paid.
01:43:15.440 - 01:43:17.180, Speaker B: My college education.
01:43:18.510 - 01:43:21.840, Speaker A: I wish my taxes went to project.
01:43:23.490 - 01:43:31.600, Speaker B: I wish my taxes funded public transportation. My crypto taxes drive me crazy.
01:43:33.650 - 01:43:37.840, Speaker A: I owe more than I made in my entire life.
01:43:39.090 - 01:43:40.800, Speaker B: And the price of.
