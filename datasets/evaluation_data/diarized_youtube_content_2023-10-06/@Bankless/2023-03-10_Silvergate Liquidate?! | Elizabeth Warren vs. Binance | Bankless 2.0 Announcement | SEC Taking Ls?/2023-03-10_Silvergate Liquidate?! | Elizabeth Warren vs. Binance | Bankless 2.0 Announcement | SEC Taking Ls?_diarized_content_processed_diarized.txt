00:00:00.250 - 00:00:17.502, Speaker A: We got something called Bankless 20 that's just dropping at 12:00 p.m. Today Eastern on March the 10th, 2023. A whole new website, whole new experience for members, a whole new bankless, a whole new era. My God, it's a whole new everything, whole new media company.
00:00:17.556 - 00:00:20.000, Speaker B: What else? David the bull market starts today.
00:00:22.930 - 00:00:27.334, Speaker A: Bankless Nation. It is the second Friday of March. David what time is it?
00:00:27.372 - 00:00:39.734, Speaker B: Brian it's the Bankless Friday weekly roll up, where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, especially in this economy. Yet we persevere nonetheless, because we've got coffee with us.
00:00:39.932 - 00:00:56.766, Speaker A: We've coffee, we've got news, we've got crypto. What more could you ask for this morning? We've got some topics of the week, too. The Silvergate liquidation event, we're going to cover that. This is crypto's. TradFi bank. Did the politicians cause a bank run here? We're going to get into that story. What else we got?
00:00:56.788 - 00:01:20.390, Speaker B: David elizabeth Warren versus Binance. Also on the table, Liz Warren on the rampage. It's not Gary Gensler this week. It's Elizabeth Warren. And then after that, the SEC taking an L. So as Elizabeth Warren comes into the main character, gary Gensler taking a seat, maybe two L's. Is it too good to be true? We'll talk about all of that and more.
00:01:20.390 - 00:01:28.214, Speaker B: And perhaps the biggest news of the week, Ryan, which I know you're excited about, tell me about it. Tell me what's the what's the biggest news of the week?
00:01:28.252 - 00:01:52.702, Speaker A: We got something called Bankless 20 that's just dropping at 12:00 p.m. Today Eastern. All right? So listen to this. On a Friday morning, maybe later, if it's later, this thing has dropped already, 12:00 p.m. Eastern on March the 10th, 2023. A whole new website, whole new experience for members, a whole new bankless, a whole new era. My God, it's a whole new everything, whole new media company.
00:01:52.756 - 00:01:55.200, Speaker B: What else? David the bull market starts today.
00:01:56.130 - 00:01:57.946, Speaker A: We're calling it the drop.
00:01:57.978 - 00:01:59.346, Speaker B: Anyway, Bankless 20.
00:01:59.448 - 00:02:18.898, Speaker A: Guys, we're super excited about this because we've been working on this for a while. This is a new experience for our free members and then for those of you who are Bankless citizens to upgrade. So go check it out, Bankless.com. We'll talk about it a little bit more in the episode. David before we get in here, I gotta talk about our friends at Rhino. Fi tell us about the Rhino.
00:02:18.914 - 00:02:56.274, Speaker B: David rhino. It is the one stop DeFi app to do all of your layer two things. So if you don't want to do any more bridging, if you don't want to do any more network switching, if you don't want to deal with native gas tokens, but you still like doing DeFi things like trading, swapping, investing pooling, generally earning yield. Wherever yield is available in DeFi, rhino is available for you. It gathers all of the best multi chain opportunities and puts it all into one specific, beautiful interface. Unless you do your DFI stuff in a bankless way on layer twos without all the layer two complexity. There is a link in the show notes to get started.
00:02:56.274 - 00:03:00.198, Speaker B: You can go to App Rhino Fi to check it out.
00:03:00.284 - 00:03:07.526, Speaker A: That's the key in a bankless way. So don't have to depend on the blockfis or the celsius. This is all bankless technology.
00:03:07.628 - 00:03:16.746, Speaker B: This is all the chaininess all the chaininess without all of the surface area for having to deal with what chain you're on.
00:03:16.848 - 00:03:20.650, Speaker A: All the chaininess zero of the machinskyness.
00:03:21.310 - 00:03:22.780, Speaker B: We got to work on this.
00:03:23.730 - 00:03:26.666, Speaker A: All right, markets. What are the markets this week? Bitcoin.
00:03:26.778 - 00:03:37.810, Speaker B: Bitcoin down. It's a sad week and we're going to talk about why shortly. Started the week at $23,500. Down 8.7% oof, down to 21,005.
00:03:37.880 - 00:03:38.802, Speaker A: Did the Fed do this?
00:03:38.856 - 00:03:50.042, Speaker B: Is this why the Fed did this one? Yeah. The fed did this. I'm not some sort of market guru, but my sentiments were like, bully, bully, bully. And then the fed came. It was like, no, no bully. No bully.
00:03:50.046 - 00:03:51.414, Speaker A: You can't have that. Not this week.
00:03:51.452 - 00:03:52.694, Speaker B: Not yet. Not yet.
00:03:52.892 - 00:04:04.234, Speaker A: You're telling me Powell doesn't care that ETH Denver was going on and he was just striking us down anyway? He's not coming off the high of ETH Denver and he's just, like, pushing down crypto prices. Can you do that to us?
00:04:04.352 - 00:04:11.434, Speaker B: We were just having way too much fun out there. He's like, that is an illegal amount of fun. So I'm going to raise rates. That's what happened.
00:04:11.632 - 00:04:12.906, Speaker A: How about ETH Price? What?
00:04:12.928 - 00:04:20.622, Speaker B: Got a price? Also sad. Started the week at 1650 down 7.3% to where we are now at 1525.
00:04:20.756 - 00:04:24.190, Speaker A: Well, you know, what do we have? Three, four good weeks in a row.
00:04:25.650 - 00:04:31.618, Speaker B: We had a good attempt. It was fun while we let while it lasted. Now we're back down to Goblin town. Down we go.
00:04:31.704 - 00:04:33.486, Speaker A: This isn't goblin. This isn't goblin.
00:04:33.518 - 00:04:36.466, Speaker B: I'm saying we're going well, like, what.
00:04:36.488 - 00:04:40.022, Speaker A: Is Goblin town to you right now? This phase of the market, if we.
00:04:40.076 - 00:04:47.480, Speaker B: Get down to 1200, maybe below 1300, I will say we are have a bitcoin no Ether price.
00:04:48.030 - 00:04:49.738, Speaker A: 1200, not 12,000. Okay?
00:04:49.824 - 00:05:12.266, Speaker B: Oh, God. If we're at 12,000 circle, we did something wrong. Maybe this is the run up to like, $1,700 that Ether had and whatever bitcoin got to 25,000. Maybe that was the mid the year high. Maybe look, man, maybe we're going to Goblin town.
00:05:12.298 - 00:05:28.562, Speaker A: It's the same people. It's still the same people that are in. So, like, if you were holding three weeks ago, you're holding last week, you're holding the week before, you're still holding now. I feel like this is the same crowd. It's not like, yes, there's no a minor run up and we're like, oh, Crypto is back. That has not happened yet. Anyway.
00:05:28.562 - 00:05:35.400, Speaker A: So we're just crabbing with the same people in the market. And I'm not surprised. I think this is just part of the build market that we're in.
00:05:35.770 - 00:06:01.338, Speaker B: Here's. My take is that I'm the permable. We're both permables here. I think that there's, like, regulatory FUD that keeps on hammering at us, and crypto is scared of that. And it's always been scared of regulatory FUD. Like regulatory FUD comes in crypto dumps, and it dumps for like a day or a week, but it never is sustained. It's always a short term blip.
00:06:01.338 - 00:06:30.938, Speaker B: My bullcase is that that is also true of this rising interest rate fears is like crypto is like, oh, no, interest rate is still not over yet. And then we're ready to move on from all of this shenanigans. And so we're going to keep on taking these blows. But they're not systemic blows. They are short term blows. And so long as the blows keep on coming, the prices are going to be suppressed as soon as they stop coming. Ryan, I think it's yeah, chris Berniski put out this Tweet not too long ago.
00:06:30.938 - 00:06:42.346, Speaker B: Bitcoin is a beach ball that's trying to rise to the surface. As soon as the Fed and soon as Elizabeth Warren goes away, that ball is poking right up. But right now they're doing a pretty good job of pushing it down.
00:06:42.368 - 00:06:44.042, Speaker A: But it's like beach ball underwater.
00:06:44.106 - 00:06:58.082, Speaker B: Underwater. The beach ball is underwater, yeah. And so crypto wants to rise. It just keeps getting pummeled. But the point is, the equilibrium is that crypto wants to rise. It needs external forces to keep it suppressed. That's my take right now.
00:06:58.136 - 00:07:00.846, Speaker A: Good take. Good take. I support that take, David.
00:07:00.958 - 00:07:02.338, Speaker B: I made that one up just now.
00:07:02.424 - 00:07:04.738, Speaker A: How about the bitcoin ETH price? What do you think?
00:07:04.824 - 00:07:10.774, Speaker B: We are up 1.5% on the week above zero seven. For the first time in a while, we are at zero 71.
00:07:10.892 - 00:07:33.066, Speaker A: Want to thank Kraken for providing these incredible charts. This is all by way of Kraken Pro. And let me remind you, Kraken was a crypto exchange and a crypto platform that did not fail you in 2022. These are one of the good guys, one of the OGS that been with us from the beginning, doing things the right way and putting out some great charts that even allows an amateur like.
00:07:33.088 - 00:07:47.374, Speaker B: Me go back a year from now on the weekly roll ups. Like, go to a 2021 weekly roll up and see just Ryan Floundering on the chart. Sorry, Ryan. And now look at him, man. Look at me go now. Look at how good these charts.
00:07:47.422 - 00:07:49.902, Speaker A: I got candles, I got ratios.
00:07:49.966 - 00:07:53.394, Speaker B: Look at green candle at the end, man. That's just great.
00:07:53.512 - 00:07:57.010, Speaker A: I got the sole Bitcoin ratio if I want that.
00:07:57.080 - 00:07:57.858, Speaker B: How's that doing?
00:07:57.944 - 00:07:58.422, Speaker A: It's down.
00:07:58.476 - 00:07:59.206, Speaker B: Still not great.
00:07:59.308 - 00:08:07.570, Speaker A: It's still not great. No, but I like to keep it there just for fun because I can. Crypto market cap, are we above a trillion?
00:08:07.730 - 00:08:13.786, Speaker B: Yeah, but not by much. We are at 1.2 trillion. Just starting to get holding it there.
00:08:13.888 - 00:08:20.540, Speaker A: Yeah, below a trillion is starting to feel bearish. It's starting to feel not goblin town. Goblin town for me is like.
00:08:22.350 - 00:08:25.714, Speaker B: I don't think we got down to 600 million. 800 million is goblin town.
00:08:25.782 - 00:08:27.486, Speaker A: What did we do? Let's look at it.
00:08:27.508 - 00:08:29.982, Speaker B: I think we got down to seven high the high 700 million.
00:08:30.036 - 00:08:34.458, Speaker A: What do I have to do, Max? See, this is not a nice coin.
00:08:34.474 - 00:08:36.366, Speaker B: Gecko charts are not kraken's charts.
00:08:36.478 - 00:08:37.234, Speaker A: Let me see.
00:08:37.352 - 00:08:38.910, Speaker B: Their charts are not charts.
00:08:39.070 - 00:08:40.210, Speaker A: I can't see it here.
00:08:40.280 - 00:08:41.986, Speaker B: Yeah, you're oh, actually, whatever.
00:08:42.088 - 00:08:43.166, Speaker A: I've given up on this chart.
00:08:43.198 - 00:08:46.594, Speaker B: Kraken. Can you guys do a total crypto market cap chart, please?
00:08:46.632 - 00:09:06.250, Speaker A: Kraken, please. Let's get into some market news. Okay, so we alluded to this, but here's a Reuters headline. The Fed's Powell previews tougher rate hike path starting soon. Here's a quote from Fed chair Powell, who controls all things marcus, of course we know he is the god.
00:09:06.320 - 00:09:11.158, Speaker B: The God dollar is God, and Powell is the word of high priest.
00:09:11.334 - 00:09:38.902, Speaker A: Powell is the post the Pope? Nothing about the data suggests to me that we've tightened too much. Indeed, it suggests that we still have work to do. It's getting hawkish on the rate hikes there. It's hard to make the case that we've overtightened means we need to continue to tighten. That's what he a I saw this clip, David. I want to play it for you. I don't know if you've seen this, but this was Warren versus Powell on this very point.
00:09:38.902 - 00:10:00.122, Speaker A: And as we get into this clip, basically Powell is saying, hey, we need to fix inflation. Here's how we have to do it. You keep tightening until inflation is fixed. And Warren is saying, but what about a recession? What about the jobs? What about the voters? Right? So let's play this. I'm going to get your reaction to this. You ready?
00:10:00.176 - 00:10:01.018, Speaker B: I haven't seen this.
00:10:01.104 - 00:10:01.498, Speaker A: Okay.
00:10:01.584 - 00:10:09.294, Speaker C: Putting 2 million people out of work is just part of the cost and they just have to bear it. Will working people be better off if.
00:10:09.332 - 00:10:13.198, Speaker B: We just walk away from our jobs and inflation remains 5%?
00:10:13.364 - 00:10:42.040, Speaker C: Let me ask you about what happens if you do this. Since the end of World War II, there have been twelve times in which the unemployment rate has increased by one percentage point within one year. Exactly what you're aiming to do right now. How many of those times did the US. Economy avoid falling into a recession? It's not as black and white as the numbers.
00:10:42.670 - 00:10:44.378, Speaker B: Alan Blinder has written a book on this.
00:10:44.464 - 00:11:11.060, Speaker C: There have been twelve times that we've seen a one point increase in the unemployment rate in a year. That's exactly what your Fed report has put out as the projection and the plan based on how you're going to keep raising these interest rates. How many times did the economy fail to fall into a recession after doing that? Out of twelve times, I think the number is zero. I think the number is zero. That's exactly right.
00:11:11.910 - 00:11:12.754, Speaker A: There you go.
00:11:12.872 - 00:11:17.070, Speaker B: She's like trying to do a checkmate on Powell.
00:11:17.230 - 00:11:36.362, Speaker A: Got you. We're going to lose jobs. You're going to send us into a recession. And Powell's response is, inflation is worse. Inflation is also not good for American citizens, nor workers, nor those 2 million people. It erodes and Warren is saying, but you're going to cause a recession this way.
00:11:36.416 - 00:11:54.194, Speaker B: What's interesting? And then he says, yeah, you're right. And she's like, gotcha. And he's like, you idiot, read a book. I feel for him because he's like trying to explain himself, but she won't let him. And when I see this clip, I just see like, this is the politician playing the politician game.
00:11:54.312 - 00:11:54.690, Speaker A: Yes.
00:11:54.760 - 00:11:57.006, Speaker B: And it's so cringe, man. It's so cringe.
00:11:57.038 - 00:12:08.438, Speaker A: Let's remember that politicians are definitely influencers and they are happy to throw anyone under the bus, including central bankers, if it scores them influencer clout points, right.
00:12:08.604 - 00:12:13.030, Speaker B: This is the state trying to politicize the money.
00:12:13.180 - 00:12:57.918, Speaker A: But the fact that obviously this is working because we just played the clip, that's the exchange. But I do think that there is a pressure from Congress coming to Powell saying you can't cause a recession, but Powell's going like, well, what are you guys going to do about inflation? What's interesting to me, David, is congress doesn't they don't have answers to what we're going to do about inflation. In fact, I would argue that a lot of the consumer CPI inflation is actually not Powell's fault. You guys know, we are not Powell simps at bankruptcy. There's a lot of things that central bankers do that are not awesome for all sorts of things, right? They definitely have their hands on the money printer. You know who else does? Fiscal policy. Congress, our executive branch.
00:12:57.918 - 00:13:00.850, Speaker A: They can also print money and they did a lot of that fiscal spending.
00:13:00.930 - 00:13:04.050, Speaker B: During COVID only print money that is to the right chart.
00:13:04.130 - 00:13:43.090, Speaker A: I think you can say central bankers are largely responsible for massive wealth inequality, massive asset price inflation since like, the bailouts of 2008. It's been a flawed policy from the beginning. But I don't think you can point to them and say, hey, you are the sole reason for the last two to three years of CPI inflation. You can't you have to take responsibility for fiscal policy and the fact that countries are overspending relative to the tax earnings. And so you have to either increase taxes or you have to not spend as much. And there is no accountability on congress to actually do so. I feel like they're kind of throwing Powell under the bus and I can't believe I'm defending Powell right now.
00:13:43.240 - 00:13:48.870, Speaker B: I said the same thing, like, wow, I'm on Powell's side on this Elizabeth versus Powell debate. My gosh.
00:13:49.370 - 00:14:05.750, Speaker A: Anyway, what does this mean for crypto look battles back and forth? It means that fiscal policy and the money printer will continue to go, like, I think no matter what I think some of that's going to come from Congress, some of that's going to come from central bankers.
00:14:05.910 - 00:14:13.462, Speaker B: And political influence of aggregate congressional members is significantly more than what the Fed can probably withstand.
00:14:13.526 - 00:14:19.530, Speaker A: Probably. And no one wants to pay. Like, we don't want to swallow the difficult medicine. We don't want to get off the morphine trip.
00:14:19.610 - 00:14:37.666, Speaker B: We don't want to reduce our quality of life, because that's ultimately what this means. Do we want to pay back our debts? Do we want to increase interest rates? Well, we all need to start consuming less. We all need to start being more efficient. We all need to stop having this extravagant American lifestyle that we're used to over the last 50 years. And no one wants to hear that, especially not the boomers.
00:14:37.698 - 00:14:38.550, Speaker A: Let's talk about that.
00:14:38.620 - 00:14:39.266, Speaker B: Sorry, boomers.
00:14:39.298 - 00:14:42.982, Speaker A: Debt. What about the debt? Here, read the tweet out.
00:14:43.116 - 00:14:58.774, Speaker B: The US. Now has a record 16.5 trillion in household debt, a record 11.9 trillion in mortgages, a record 1.6 trillion in auto loans, a record 986,000,000,000 in credit card debt. This is what I was talking about. This is the extravagant lifestyle.
00:14:58.774 - 00:15:25.710, Speaker B: We're beyond our means as a country. We have been for my entire life, all of probably all these listeners entire's lives. Total mortgage debt is now double the 2006 peak right before the 2008 crash. Meanwhile, 30% of Americans have more credit card debt than savings, with balances rising at the fastest pace since 1999. This is all while mortgages rates just hit 7.1% and credit card debt hit a record 25%. We are fighting inflation with debt.
00:15:25.710 - 00:15:28.582, Speaker B: This cannot end well. Wow, that was a long tweet. Yeah.
00:15:28.636 - 00:15:32.214, Speaker A: Okay. By the way, how long can tweets be now?
00:15:32.252 - 00:15:34.434, Speaker B: That was a really long tweet. My gosh.
00:15:34.562 - 00:15:39.714, Speaker A: Like you can keep going. It's not only they're almost as limitless, dude, limitless tweets.
00:15:39.762 - 00:15:45.254, Speaker B: I don't know if I like that, but we're inflating. Inflation is the name of the game these days, including tweet length.
00:15:45.302 - 00:16:02.718, Speaker A: Got to inflate tweets inflating our tweets. The Twitter money printer keeps going burnt double coin check in. Let's talk about crypto markets for a second, though. USDT is on the rise. It's the highest level in 15 months. That is, of course, Tether. David, why is Tether going up?
00:16:02.884 - 00:16:11.154, Speaker B: This has got to be as a result of outflows from BUSD, right? So BUSD going down, UST going up, right. That's got to be the conclusion here.
00:16:11.192 - 00:16:33.622, Speaker A: I think that's what's happening. Yeah. Tether's gain came mostly at the expense of BUSD after the Paxo announcement, we talked about that last week, announcing they were halting new minting of BUSD. And it's grown 5.3 billion to a total of $71 billion in Tether. Which is Tether fully backed? We think so. Kind of, mostly.
00:16:33.622 - 00:16:34.620, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:16:35.230 - 00:16:39.350, Speaker B: That's not tether's product, brother. Tether's product is being an offshore stablecoin.
00:16:39.430 - 00:17:01.474, Speaker A: That's right. And that's what BUSD was maybe filling part of. And Tether is just going to take that. So the US system has no ability to go find hunt down Tether. Can they do that? I mean, this is outside of the bounds of US jurisdiction, right? But the US does have jurisdiction over some other things. We're going to talk about that when we come back. David, what are we covering next?
00:17:01.592 - 00:17:38.926, Speaker B: Silvergate liquidate is the only true word I'll say about that. Elizabeth Warren returns versus Binance, and the SEC taking an L, perhaps two.

00:19:35.000 - 00:19:42.550, Speaker A: Crypto bank silvergate Announces Voluntary Liquidation david, why would you voluntarily liquidate what's happening here?
00:19:42.700 - 00:20:33.446, Speaker B: You would voluntarily liquidate when things look so bad that you don't see any viable paths forward and so crypto Friendly Silvergate Bank, of course, has said that it's going to unwind its assets and wind down operations of Silvergate Capital Corporation. Quote from Silvergate in light of recent industry and regulatory developments, silvergate believes that an orderly wind down of bank operations and a voluntary liquidation of the bank is the best path forward. The bank's wind down and liquidation plan includes full repayment of all deposits. So that's good news. All deposits will be fully repaid according to the liquidation plan. The company did not say how it plans to resolve claims against its businesses. Silvergate is a crypto bank, is one of the two main banks for serving crypto companies, along with New York based Signature Bank is the other main one.
00:20:33.446 - 00:20:41.782, Speaker B: Just as a size comparison, silvergate had over $11 billion in assets compared with $114,000,000,000 at Signature.
00:20:41.846 - 00:20:45.110, Speaker A: I didn't know that. Much bigger. Ten x bigger.
00:20:45.190 - 00:21:17.794, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. The FDIC was in urgent talks with Silvergate to find ways to save the crypto Friendly Bank from shutdown. FDIC examiners arrived at the firm's headquarters last week and have been since reviewing the firm's books and records. The department is evaluating compliance with all financial laws as well as safety and soundness obligations, and is working closely with relevant federal counterparts. So I think there's probably a big question out there. Was it Silvergate's fault or was it external forces that have caused this? We'll have to find out.
00:21:17.794 - 00:21:25.090, Speaker B: I don't know if there's any reason to suspect Silvergate of anything, but I guess we're going to find out either way. Do you have a take on this, Ryan?
00:21:25.170 - 00:22:00.526, Speaker A: Well, a lot of people in crypto are saying that this is basically a run on the bank perpetrated by people in power, those regulators and politicians going on the megaphone and saying, like, the Operation Choke Point sorts of measures. People like Elizabeth Warren, for example, broadcasting this and saying withdraw funds from these crypto banks, these crypto companies. And I would say the broader point is like, remember, guys, we live in a fractional reserve banking system. That means any bank, whether it's Wells Fargo Bank of Him, any commercial bank.
00:22:00.638 - 00:22:02.878, Speaker B: That you use, operates on faith.
00:22:02.974 - 00:22:17.746, Speaker A: Operates on faith. And so if there was a run on the bank and you decided to withdraw, all of us decide to withdraw all of our money at once, we can't all get it. It doesn't exist, guys. It doesn't exist. It's a figment.
00:22:17.858 - 00:22:19.350, Speaker B: That's how the system works.
00:22:19.420 - 00:22:53.714, Speaker A: Yes, it's a figment of our imagination. It's all kind of on the ledger and it all works as long as everyone trusts it. And the FDIC has a 250K guarantee and all of these things. So there is some element, David, where yes, they probably were sloppy in areas is kind of my take right now. Based on the evidence I've seen, yes, Silvergate could have done additional AML KYC in places, they could have had some tighter risk policies, but I don't think this is not an FTX type situation. Right. I don't think that there was anything incredibly nefarious going on.
00:22:53.714 - 00:23:15.302, Speaker A: At least the evidence hasn't borne that out yet. But what I do know is there has absolutely been a run on this bank and perpetuated in some cases by regulatory congressional influencers who are pushing Silvergate towards the edge. And to that extent, I would say that is extremely irresponsible.
00:23:15.446 - 00:23:54.486, Speaker B: Right? Just to start this from the beginning of like a run on the bank is a fear and emotion based phenomenon from all customers, clients, depositors of that bank. And so if there is this run on the bank, that's happening and the reason why silvergate is shutting down is because there's just so much net outflow, out of the bank, because everyone is fearful that silvergate is going under and that fear perpetuates, right, like turns into a mind virus. We have to ask ourselves why did that fear happen in the first place? What is the patient zero or the trigger of that fear? Do you have an answer for?
00:23:54.668 - 00:24:28.306, Speaker A: I mean, I think obviously the entire market is incredibly jittery coming off of FTX. I'm not sure who exactly the patient zero is or what. I do know that the White House is making some comments on the back of this. This is the presser's secretary at the White House. In recent weeks, banking regulators have released guidelines on how banks should protect themselves from risks associated with crypto. As you know, this is a president that is repeatedly called on Congress to take action to protect everyday Americans from the risk posed by digital assets. And he will continue to do so.
00:24:28.306 - 00:25:12.270, Speaker A: The risk by digital assets. So that's what's being thrown under the bus here is crypto is digital assets. This is Senate Banking Committee. Friend of Banks, I might say. Sherard Brown saying as the impact of FTX's collapse continues to ripple outward today, we are seeing what can happen when a bank is over reliant on a risky, volatile sector like cryptocurrencies. So whatever is happening, David, whether this is a bank run and kind of silvergate is somewhat a victim in the situation, or whether silvergate did some things that were irresponsible and they're not a victim, they are responsible. We do know that politicians are definitely ready and eager to throw crypto under the bus and throw crypto banking under the bus.
00:25:12.270 - 00:25:20.034, Speaker A: And to me this is just like the continuation of the Operation Choke Point we've been talking about for the last since the beginning of this year, right?
00:25:20.072 - 00:26:12.018, Speaker B: Yeah. This is such a nefarious line. As the impact of FTX's collapse continue to ripple outwards today, we are seeing what can happen when a bank is overreliant on risky, volatile sector like cryptocurrencies. FTX was not cryptocurrencies. FTX was a bank that was pushed offshore and with all of those quality products that drove people into FTX not enabled to be held onshore by onshore banks, this was not a cryptocurrencies problem. As we know, as we've reported on bankless for quarters now, every single DeFi app in the crypto world held up completely solvently FTX, which is a bank which was ignored by the SEC, and all of the onshore regulated entities were hamstrung by onshore regulation. And so the FTX incident explodes, comes back to hit.
00:26:12.018 - 00:26:21.014, Speaker B: This is a banking crisis. It happens that there are crypto rails. It is a banking crisis that is the center of this.
00:26:21.212 - 00:26:51.534, Speaker A: The public's not going to understand the details. Maybe people in the crypto community will, but they're going to paint this as a problem with crypto. I mean, sharad Brown continues I've been concerned that when banks get involved in crypto, it spreads risk across the financial system and it will be taxpayers and consumers who pay the price. When banks get involved in crypto, what do you think that means? They're going to continue to choke the banking sector from touching this whole asset class of crypto. That's very disturbing to me. David. We Have Elizabeth Warren Tweet here.
00:26:51.534 - 00:26:52.494, Speaker A: What does this say?
00:26:52.612 - 00:27:39.726, Speaker B: Oh boy, my favorite. Elizabeth Warren says as the bank of choice for crypto Silvergate's, bank's failure is disappointing but predictable. I warned of Silvergate's risky, if not illegal activity and identified severe due diligence failures. Now customers must be made whole and regulators should step up against crypto risk. So in my mind, ryan I'm just saying regulators putting undue burdens upon the crypto banking sector, and then as a result of those burdens and perhaps also other things FTX and interest rates, but also as a result of what Elizabeth Warren is doing here in this Tweet, putting undue burdens upon the crypto banking sector, then the big crypto banking sector fails. And then she's like, I told you so, even though she's part of the problem that caused it to not be a well serviced industry in the first place.
00:27:39.828 - 00:28:19.494, Speaker A: Remember Tyler Cowan's caution, he wrote an editorial about this, came on our podcast and he was like, hey, I'm most worried that regulators and those in Congress will backlash far too far. And yes, there was problems with FTX, but you're really going to try to choke United States citizens, us citizens from this entire asset class? I worry about that. That's what's going on. I think Nick Carter had a fantastic take here on silvergate. He said this about silvergate, about the situation we were just talking about. The politicians are now telling us that because a single bank peaking at 16 billion in assets, that's silvergate wound down in an orderly manner, making depositors whole. No one lost money here, David.
00:28:19.494 - 00:28:35.082, Speaker A: No depositor lost money affecting. No one but shareholders, causing no knock on effects that crypto firms must be shut out of the banking system. Those holding equity, the shareholders of Silvergate lost in this. That's how it should be.
00:28:35.156 - 00:28:36.018, Speaker B: That's how this works.
00:28:36.104 - 00:28:50.200, Speaker A: It's a risk asset. Holding equity is a risk asset that the company is going to go bankrupt, of course. So in that sort of situation, equity holders get liquidated. No one that deposited funds in Silvergate has lost anything.
00:28:51.050 - 00:28:59.494, Speaker B: So, like a bank wound down in a correct and orderly fashion. And Elizabeth Warren is like grave dancing. Yeah. Is that what's going on?
00:28:59.532 - 00:29:12.106, Speaker A: I think so. I mean, Nick goes on and says they cry out safety and sound nests while chipping away at the foundation and then act vindicated when the structure starts to crumble. I think that's what's going on here. Here's another.
00:29:12.288 - 00:29:32.594, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is a take from a Mike from Blockworks. Liz Warren has a $67 million net worth even though her salary is $285,000 per year. Either she saved 100% of her earnings for 235 years or she's making money another way. I love this.
00:29:32.712 - 00:29:33.858, Speaker A: Why do you love this?
00:29:33.944 - 00:29:58.618, Speaker B: Well, this just calls into question the legitimacy of what she's doing. Right. She's an influencer who is talking against other people's bags, our bags, our crypto bags. And then she's what Mike is implying here is making money in ways that we don't understand. And so as an influencer of this state, he is calling into question the legitimacy of where she has made her money. I think that's a good thing to call into question.
00:29:58.704 - 00:29:59.980, Speaker A: Yeah, I get it.
00:30:00.670 - 00:30:05.354, Speaker B: And if people think that that's below the belt, I think that what Liz's Warren is doing is below the belt.
00:30:05.402 - 00:30:17.614, Speaker A: I don't necessarily think it's below the belt. I do worry a little bit about the kind of the just because someone's wealthy doesn't mean they made it in nefarious ways. And we don't know the source of her wealth.
00:30:17.742 - 00:30:21.982, Speaker B: But yeah, $67 million, brother.
00:30:22.046 - 00:30:34.434, Speaker A: It's a lot. That's a lot of wealth. Let's talk about this finance under scrutiny as well. That is happening this week. This is a letter sent yesterday by wow, Senator Warren. I guess this is the Senator Warren episode.
00:30:34.482 - 00:30:36.262, Speaker B: Senator Warren is the main character of this week.
00:30:36.316 - 00:30:51.274, Speaker A: Van Holan and Marshall to Binance and Binance us. It's absolutely devastating. This Tweet says they are flat out accusing Binance of fraud and money laundering. This is not good for CZ. Have you read this letter? What's the TLDR here, David.
00:30:51.402 - 00:31:29.778, Speaker B: Yeah, basically well, it's a pretty damning accusation of CZ and Binance's operations. Basically saying that Binance has knowingly enabled money laundering, reduced KYC compliance checks, allowed for higher and higher limits of non KYC accounts in order to trade on Binance in order to just make revenue. Right. That's their business model. It also says that accuses them of creating Binance US as like the compliant distraction so that Binance itself could grow larger offshore and do all of its perhaps illicit ways of generating revenue.
00:31:29.874 - 00:31:31.034, Speaker A: Meanwhile, that part's true, right?
00:31:31.072 - 00:32:07.490, Speaker B: We all saw that's probably true, yeah. Now the thing is, I wouldn't necessarily rush to the defense of Binance here. I think also we know that CZ and Justin Sun are buddies and we know that Justin's son used his ownership over Poloniax. Remember that one article? Justin sun was like, just pass any KYC check? Always pass, never fail, always pass, doesn't matter. Remember that? That's the story that came out, right? And so they're very close with each other. This is kind of I don't really think anyone's really going to rush to the defense of finance here.
00:32:07.640 - 00:32:16.850, Speaker A: So it's know, it's the big that's different than fraud. Is that the big charge here? That they were bypassing AML KYC.
00:32:17.010 - 00:32:23.026, Speaker B: Yeah, basically they were negligently enabling money laundering and illicit use of finance.
00:32:23.138 - 00:32:23.506, Speaker A: Gotcha.
00:32:23.538 - 00:32:28.666, Speaker B: Whether or not they were the ones actually doing it is a different story. I don't know if that's what this is charging them, but yeah, this is.
00:32:28.688 - 00:32:32.480, Speaker A: The Wall Street Journal breaking some things about Binance too. What does this say?
00:32:32.930 - 00:33:07.474, Speaker B: This says, Text from crypto giant Binance reveals plan to elude US authorities. So this was messages revealed from CZ and Binance leadership saying, hey, we're totally going to do our best to circumnavigate evade US regulations. We're going to spin up Binance US in order to prop that up and have that be like the fault, the subject of their scrutiny. And that thing is going to be totally compliant. But meanwhile we're going to do all the shady stuff in the back and apparently that has been explicitly made in text form and leaked to The Wall Street Journal.
00:33:07.522 - 00:33:24.174, Speaker A: So what's the take here then? Are we back to like, okay, is this all true? Are the regulators right? Are they right in stamping out this entire industry from the United States because it's only full of scammers. Is that what Binance is doing here? What do you say to this?
00:33:24.372 - 00:33:39.950, Speaker B: I say this is all just so tiring, man. What part of it I got nothing. It's like, damn it, we need to have regulation, but our regulators are being shitty at it. It's a double edged sword.
00:33:40.110 - 00:33:41.662, Speaker A: Bad people on both sides.
00:33:41.806 - 00:33:43.794, Speaker B: Yes. It's just like, no one's got it right.
00:33:43.832 - 00:34:29.646, Speaker A: Dude, we don't know enough to know what CZ is doing. I do know he's smarter than SBF, that's for sure. Just don't know. How would we know it's a centralized exchange? We just don't know it's by nature. It's trust based. But we do know that no one is talking here about like, okay, centralized exchanges are failing us in a variety of ways. Here's how we could shore up the regulation for centralized exchanges, right? And by the way, isn't it cool, American citizen, that crypto has also provided a self sovereign option called decentralized finance, which you can audit on chain? We never have to question whether it's a fraud.
00:34:29.646 - 00:34:59.210, Speaker A: We never have to question whether it's fully backed or has reserves. It's proof of reserves built in. They're not pointing people in that direction. They're saying the whole crypto thing is a fraud, is a scam. Right. They're not engaging with the members of the crypto community who are like, yeah, we hate FDX Two and SBF. And by the way, we've been saying that for a long period of time, that we're worried about centralized exchange as an attack vector.
00:34:59.210 - 00:35:24.674, Speaker A: They're not engaging with us at that level, so it doesn't feel collaborative. So I share your frustration, but they've got us in this spot where they can just point to like, five to ten scams last year in crypto, bad things that happened, and say, Look, I told you, like Elizabeth Warren, I was right. I was right. I predicted this. I told you this was going to happen. It's a difficult situation.
00:35:24.872 - 00:36:01.646, Speaker B: Yeah. I'll put on my libertarian free market, anti state hat and say that Binance has banked more people than any with his technology and its crypto rails. And Binance smart chain, for that matter, has banked more people using crypto technology than any nation state has ever done, ever, with a CBDC or any of their legacy traditional financial system. So I'm sure there's a lot of skeletons in the closet of Binance. I'm sure there's money laundering happening. I'm sure CZ is aware of it, probably. I don't know any of this stuff, but I'm sure there's a bunch of stuff that pisses off the state.
00:36:01.646 - 00:36:14.962, Speaker B: But my Eric Voorhees raw human perspective is that Binance is unequivocally a net positive for the world in terms of banking the unbanked and allowing financial freedom to proliferate. That's my take.
00:36:15.016 - 00:36:37.900, Speaker A: I think there's a way for regulators in Congress to cooperate with the finances of the world rather than just attacking them, trying to stamp this thing out of existence. David, this is somewhat related. The SEC snubbed as Voyager wins court approval for the sale to Binance. So Voyager, that defunct, I guess, crypto bank, crypto lending and borrowing platform, is trying to sell to finance us. And is that going through?
00:36:38.750 - 00:37:10.018, Speaker B: Well, it looks like it. That Voyager is the one that lent out that unsecured $660,000,000 loan to 3 Hours Capital, which I'm assuming they haven't gotten back. It's safe. Safe assumption. But approval was granted by United States Bankruptcy Judge Michael Willis, which came four days after arguments presented by Voyager and the United States Securities Exchange Commission were processed by that judge. Judge says this can proceed. And so this is actually really good news for anyone who's lost money on Voyager.
00:37:10.018 - 00:37:26.570, Speaker B: This article is claiming that if you are a Voyager customer, an impacted Voyager customer, you are going to get back approximately 73%. Wow. 73%, which is a very precise number for saying the word approximately. So that's great news. That's great news.
00:37:26.640 - 00:37:28.314, Speaker A: That is great. Definitely.
00:37:28.432 - 00:37:41.950, Speaker B: This judge's decision comes over a week after 97% of the 61,300 Voyager account holders found were voted in favor of the current finance US restructuring plan, according to a February 28 filing. That's pretty cool.
00:37:42.020 - 00:38:13.510, Speaker A: That's what shareholders want. It sounds like cool. Grayscale versus the SEC. David, this next story is, I think, a win. If you were asking yourself in the last two stories we were talking about, where are the checks and balances here? How do we stop this type of activity? I think the court system is one possible solution to that. So this is judges that are skeptical of the SEC's argument in the Grayscale versus Bitcoin ETF hearing. Can you tell us about that? David?
00:38:13.670 - 00:38:35.522, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is a court that has reviewed the facts and circumstances of the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF application. We want the Grayscale Trust, the GBDT Trust, to fold into elegantly and cleanly. A bitcoin ETF. A spot market bitcoin ETF. We have a bitcoin futures market ETF. Why not a bitcoin spot market?
00:38:35.576 - 00:38:36.594, Speaker A: Why do we want that?
00:38:36.712 - 00:39:03.734, Speaker B: We want that, ryan because right now, the GBTC asset trades at a 45% discount to actual GBTC. And so, of all the bitcoins that are in the GBTC Trust locked in, there one way can't come out. They are worth only 55% of their actual real value because there's not enough demand for GBTC, partly because of the whole grayscale three zeros capital loop.
00:39:03.782 - 00:39:05.834, Speaker A: So retail is getting screwed, basically.
00:39:06.032 - 00:39:33.618, Speaker B: Yeah. How much is the Grayscale GBTC Trust? Let me go look that up real quick. And so, as a result of that discount, there is a $4 billion gap. And what that means is that GBTC owners collectively are short $4 billion. There's $4 billion of wealth that could be created if the SEC allowed for a spot market Bitcoin ETF out of grayscale. They could make $4 billion. Just appear out of thin air if they did this.
00:39:33.618 - 00:39:40.470, Speaker B: And so the judge is like, hey, SEC, why aren't you doing that? Which is a really good question.
00:39:40.540 - 00:39:42.514, Speaker A: Why aren't you protecting investors?
00:39:42.642 - 00:39:42.982, Speaker B: Right.
00:39:43.036 - 00:39:49.446, Speaker A: This is like the second judge facilitating capital markets. Yeah. The whole vision on your website, you.
00:39:49.468 - 00:39:53.270, Speaker B: Can make $4 billion. Why aren't you doing it for retail.
00:39:53.350 - 00:40:13.786, Speaker A: The people that you're supposed to protect? This is the second judge saying this, who's skeptical of the SEC's decision to approve the futures ETF, but not the spot one. Not the one that we all want. The SEC hasn't offered any information that the petitioners are wrong. The judge says SEC has to explain why they're wrong. Yes, they do. Thank you. Some accountability.
00:40:13.786 - 00:40:27.638, Speaker A: David, you and I could say it all day. Crypto, Twitter can say it all day. A judge is requiring them to answer that question. And that is a nice check and balance. That's a product of our system, and I'm glad that we have it right now.
00:40:27.724 - 00:40:32.582, Speaker B: Gary Gensler's like, well, so you know.
00:40:32.636 - 00:40:35.574, Speaker A: How well office hours with Gary office hours?
00:40:35.612 - 00:40:37.014, Speaker B: Yeah. Turn it into influencer video.
00:40:37.052 - 00:40:46.634, Speaker A: Gary yeah, so that's what's going on there and maybe some hope for the future there if some of this power gets checked by the court system. David, what do we have coming up next?
00:40:46.752 - 00:41:16.130, Speaker B: Coming up next, we have an onslaught of Coinbase news. All of it good, thank God. So there's like four things that we're going to talk about, all related to Coinbase tornado cash 2.0 pulls a jujitsu move against privacy haters. We're going to talk all about that. We got Uniswap wallet, we got our ETH supply, and most importantly, Ryan, the biggest news of the week, which is Bankless 20. So all those details and more coming right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make Bankless 20 possible.
00:41:16.130 - 00:41:57.394, Speaker B: Uniswap is the largest onchain marketplace for self custody digital assets. Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange, but you know this because you've been listening to Bankless. But did you know that the Uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat onramp? Now, you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to Tokens in DFI inside of Uniswap. Not only that, but Polygon Arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate. But that's just DFI. Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, letting you find more listings for the best prices across the NFT world. With Uniswap, you can sweep floors on multiple NFTs and Uniswap's universal router will optimize your gas fees for you.
00:41:57.394 - 00:42:22.886, Speaker B: Uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across Ethereum, and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor. So go to app Uniswap.org today to buy, sell or swap tokens and NFTs. How many total Airdrops have you gotten? This last bull market had a ton of them. Did you get them all? Maybe you missed one. So here's what you should do. Go to Earnify and plug in your Ethereum wallet.
00:42:22.886 - 00:42:53.854, Speaker B: And Earnify will tell you if you have any Unclaimed Airdrops that you can get. And it also does Poaps and mintable NFTs any kind of money that your wallet can claim. Earnify will tell you about it. And you should probably do it now because some Airdrops expire. And if you sign up for Earnify, they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new AirDrop for it to make sure that you never lose an AirDrop ever again. You can also upgrade to Earnify premium to unlock access to Airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets. And for just under $21 a month, it probably pays for itself with just one AirDrop.
00:42:53.854 - 00:43:30.640, Speaker B: So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get. That's Earnifi. And make sure you never lose another AirDrop. And we are back. But first, watch this sick promo video for Bankless 20. That's great. I love that.
00:43:31.170 - 00:43:42.100, Speaker A: On repeat. Here it is. Bankless.com. Bankless 20. It's here it's our new website. We have fully migrated from Substack at this piece. Web two listening to it.
00:43:42.100 - 00:43:55.110, Speaker A: We are doing this so that we can start being much more of a crypto native media company. And you know what's cool about this, David, is I'm not sure we entirely know what that means.
00:43:55.260 - 00:44:02.066, Speaker B: All right, the point is we can find out. We're going to explore our own frontier. We have our own frontier now.
00:44:02.108 - 00:44:03.674, Speaker A: Are we going to front run the opportunity here?
00:44:03.712 - 00:44:19.774, Speaker B: We are front running the opportunity. Yeah. Bankless is going from just like being all Web Two e. I think we have one of the best platforms to experiment and innovate. And iterate about Web Three things natively, because now we have our own settlement. This is our settlement. This is our home.
00:44:19.892 - 00:44:43.222, Speaker A: This is our home on the Internet, on this protocol that we call home. Everyone's welcome. What are we doing here? Obviously, we're posting the podcast. This roll up that you're listening to will appear here. We're posting our articles, everything we write. We have this thing called a daily brief. If you only listen to Bankless and you don't consume it in your inbox every day, you should just start consuming it that way as well.
00:44:43.222 - 00:44:51.282, Speaker A: It's a daily brief. It's a guide to crypto for every day. We're posting that here. There is a fantastic ability to search for different guides.
00:44:51.346 - 00:44:54.454, Speaker B: David, you can tag your interests, tag.
00:44:54.502 - 00:45:22.306, Speaker A: Your interests if you want, guide to investing, all of our how tos if you want to get into kind of opinion pieces. Guide to Arbitrum, guide to optimism, guide to polygon. It's all here on the website, the crypto native features. All right. We had the hardest time. In fact, Substac would never integrate this for us, which is our previous platform. Just paying via, right? So people would be like, I'm trying to sign up for Bankless, but you're making me pay with a credit card.
00:45:22.306 - 00:45:25.570, Speaker A: And we're like, oh, well, there's the separate link. We can send it to you.
00:45:25.640 - 00:45:26.610, Speaker B: It's manual.
00:45:28.070 - 00:45:40.962, Speaker A: It was never really connected. And so now it's all connected. Now it's all seamless. Now it all works. You can pay via crypto. That's just a simple thing. But also we're going to add the ability to log in with Ethereum.
00:45:40.962 - 00:46:01.214, Speaker A: Of course, you can access this function. We're adding podcast NFTs to the post. We're going to do some other things that I can't speak about right now, but that are coming soon that we are super excited about and bullish on. And in general, we just want to grow this movement and grow this community in crypto native ways and push forward into the frontier. So that's what we're up to.
00:46:01.252 - 00:46:46.394, Speaker B: Man yeah, that's exactly right. And if you look on that far left, you have home listen read tools for little icons, for little tabs to explore different places. The number of icons there can grow as we grow the number of products and tools and things to do on Bankless.com. There's also native POAP minting. Yeah, we have built the best native in the browser in the website POAP Minting apparatus that I think exists. And so there is a POAP to Mint for those that are already Bankless subscribers. We sadly can't open it up to everyone because we can't spam attack POAP or allow POAP to be spam attacked.
00:46:46.394 - 00:47:00.130, Speaker B: But if you are already a Bankless subscriber, including free subscribers, you can go Mint the inaugural ship POAP because we are sailing west. We're going into a new world ship season. So go mint. That POAP. That's your big call to action.
00:47:00.550 - 00:47:06.626, Speaker A: Go do that bankless.com. Guys, thank you. Thank you for all the support. Thank you for everything, for bearing with us here.
00:47:06.648 - 00:47:10.470, Speaker B: Thank you for listening to all the ads that helped finance the building of this website.
00:47:10.540 - 00:47:36.160, Speaker A: It's important. We got to build our settlement, so that's how we're doing it. Anyway, so much more we could talk about. David, speaking of Bankless content and cool stuff, you've got some ETH Denver video, a whole series that will make you feel like you went to ETH Denver and hung out with David and listened into all the conversations that he was having, except for that one conversation last week with the lawyer where you talked about Lido. Not that one. All the other ones, though.
00:47:38.450 - 00:47:40.474, Speaker B: All the good ones that bring back to the nation.
00:47:40.522 - 00:47:42.746, Speaker A: All right, well, so what is this? Give us the highlights.
00:47:42.858 - 00:48:13.674, Speaker B: So this is part one of two parts. Every other time I've done this and this has been a reoccurring theme of what I do when I go to conferences is I interview people and I bring back interviews, like 20 minutes, bite sized interviews so you can feel like you were there. I did that twice, right? Two times at E Denver. So this is part one. This is at the Axelr Interoperability Conference, which was like a who's who of interoperability builders. Yeah, all the builders. I was trying to understand, like, all right, because there's ethereum layer twos and layer threes here.
00:48:13.674 - 00:48:47.318, Speaker B: There's Cosmos people, there's the Axelr team, there's all of the people doing like, omnichain and layer zero and all that kind of stuff. What is the theme of this conference? Clearly it's interoperability. When I was writing about this for the newsletter. This is also going to turn into a newsletter on the Bankless newsletter coming out today. So you will already have that in your inboxes the theme, Ryan, is like literally everything that's not the ethereum layer one or bitcoin. That was the theme of this conference. Anyways, so, like, layer two content, eigen layer content, Cosmos content, Axler content.
00:48:47.318 - 00:49:10.454, Speaker B: So that's part one. Part two is me and Luke running around with a microphone at Shelling Point and ETH Denver just randomly ninja interviewing people. We got Kevin awakee and Simona Pop from Shelling Point. We got Jesse from base. We got Victor Buenan from Coinbase Cloud. We got Lisa from Aztec. So many different interviews of people actually at Ethnver.
00:49:10.454 - 00:49:26.882, Speaker B: That is part two. That is coming soon. TM absolute chad of a production team that is pushing this content out within one week. Post ETH denver. They helped me film it, they helped me get the audio. They're processing tip of the hat to the Bankless pot squad. Tip of the hat, absolutely.
00:49:27.016 - 00:49:33.954, Speaker A: And of course, you can go find all of that content right now@bankless.com. Bankless.com.
00:49:33.992 - 00:49:34.354, Speaker B: Say it again.
00:49:34.392 - 00:49:35.218, Speaker A: Bankless.com.
00:49:35.304 - 00:49:36.082, Speaker B: Bankless.com.
00:49:36.136 - 00:49:53.114, Speaker A: Coinbase is doing some things too. Not just Bankless that's been building. Coinbase has been building some things. Today we introduce Wallet as a service. What is wallet as a service? This is a Coinbase offering now that makes it seamless to onboard users to Web Three. What is this, David? Yeah.
00:49:53.152 - 00:50:25.650, Speaker B: So it's an API. Wallet inside of an API. I never really thought that was possible. Which allows companies to create and deploy fully customizable on chain wallets. So users can create, access and restore mainly their wallets with authentication as simple as a username and password without needing to worry about seed phrases. So they have built a way to allow, I'm assuming, the rest of Web Two to easily spin up a wallet on demand on notice. And I think the most obvious use case that I'm just going to imagine off the top of my head, Ryan, is like the digital collectibles and Instagram.
00:50:25.650 - 00:50:28.766, Speaker B: What percentage of Instagram users have a wallet?
00:50:28.958 - 00:50:32.246, Speaker A: Not zero, because there's some but less than 1%? Yeah.
00:50:32.268 - 00:50:32.854, Speaker B: Less than 1%.
00:50:32.892 - 00:50:35.382, Speaker A: Less than 0.1%, I would say.
00:50:35.436 - 00:51:08.562, Speaker B: So say NFT creators who are now able to promote and share their NFTs on Instagram. That is a feature that is all throughout Instagram. Now say one of their fans wants to buy that NFT and that fan does not have a wallet. Well, Instagram could just ping the Coinbase wallet API and be like, serve this, give me a wallet, because they want to buy that NFT and it's there. And they could buy that NFT with Trad payment Rails, like with Stripe or whatever. And all of a sudden there's a wallet inside of Instagram that is accessible by the Instagram authentication service that's already built in.
00:51:08.616 - 00:51:17.486, Speaker A: I think that's really what this yes, non custodial. This is multiparty computation technology to make this non custodial.
00:51:17.598 - 00:51:35.782, Speaker B: It can be non custodial and it can also be custodial. It's customizable for both. It's really the wallet infrastructure that we need to be able to push wallets into every single corner of the Internet. This is insanely. It just makes crypto adoption so easy. It lowers the barrier for getting a wallet down to the absolute minimum.
00:51:35.846 - 00:51:53.294, Speaker A: We got Stripe for crypto also. Coinbase has also acquired oneRiver digital Management. Now, we just released our episode with Eric Peters. He's the CIO of one river. He is kind of the institutional crypto guy. I mean, all the kind of the billionaires with a lot of money. Respect.
00:51:53.294 - 00:52:03.540, Speaker A: Eric Peters and Coinbase has now acquired their company as I guess, a bridge to institutional investors increasing that. Do you have any other takes on.
00:52:05.750 - 00:52:09.814, Speaker B: Just they're doing everything, man. They're going in every single direction at once.
00:52:10.012 - 00:52:22.050, Speaker A: It's pretty cool. Including the direction of public relations and I think repairing crypto's image, their brand image. I know. David, you wanted us to take a look at this commercial.
00:52:22.130 - 00:52:27.434, Speaker B: I think this is just good content. So we're going to watch this cone based commercial. They don't even pay us for this.
00:52:27.472 - 00:52:35.898, Speaker A: What is this archaic system? Mother's maiden name beboid. You're telling me this guy is how things get verified?
00:52:35.994 - 00:52:37.070, Speaker B: That's my job.
00:52:37.220 - 00:52:56.226, Speaker A: I'm just saying you shouldn't have to buy $10 worth of gum if you just want $0.79 worth of gum. Why do you get charged your money to take your money from your account. And if you're out of money, they charge you for being out of money. What an overseas transfer takes five days. Business days.
00:52:56.408 - 00:52:56.850, Speaker C: Why?
00:52:56.920 - 00:53:11.766, Speaker A: What are they used a zeppelin? I deposited the check Monday. But Monday was a bank holiday. Why is this the way it is? A bank holiday? This system what the bank holiday? Makes no sense. This makes no sense. Who designs this system?
00:53:11.948 - 00:53:12.920, Speaker B: May I?
00:53:13.310 - 00:53:24.240, Speaker A: Is this really the best we can do? Hello, doe. We deserve better. Nice.
00:53:25.090 - 00:53:34.640, Speaker B: It's a coinbase ad, obviously. It is the best PR 1 minute of PR for the crypto industry as a whole that I've ever seen.
00:53:35.810 - 00:53:40.050, Speaker A: It's basically the bankless. It's basically banks suck and we can do better.
00:53:40.120 - 00:53:40.990, Speaker B: Finance sucks.
00:53:41.070 - 00:54:00.134, Speaker A: Let's use crypto to update it. That is the message. And it's a much better message, I feel like than the 2022 message that crypto was sending, which was come here to get really rich, come get yield. Yeah. And because we have like social boosting NFTs which yeah, sure, but this is the message. This is the better message.
00:54:00.172 - 00:54:01.190, Speaker B: This is the long term message.
00:54:01.260 - 00:54:27.342, Speaker A: We also are coming out with a podcast. Brian Armstrong, so we just talked to him earlier this week. I think it's a good kind of recap on everything that crypto is know, we spent a lot of time on regulatory in this episode, David, and I think that's because that's where crypto is right now. That episode comes out Monday. But if you are a citizen of the bankless nation, that means you're a premium subscriber. You should have access to that episode right about now.
00:54:27.396 - 00:54:29.490, Speaker B: Early access on bankless.com.
00:54:29.560 - 00:54:43.154, Speaker A: There you go. That's what we were waiting for. David, some cool news with tornado cash, which is an illegal crypto privacy anonymizer it's on the ofax no, it's not illegal.
00:54:43.202 - 00:55:36.834, Speaker B: It's just illegal for us, okay? It is an agnostic neutral piece of technology. It's just illegal for you and me. What are they doing? This isn't anything to do with tornado cash specifically. This is not the tornado cash team. This is Amin Soleimani announcing Privacy Pools V zero, which he is calling the sequel to Tornado Cache, also similarly branded as Tornado Cash. I think the TLDR is it's tornado cache. And this additional fun little mechanism that lets you prove the specific anonymity set, what does that mean? You can prove that you are not a Tornado Cache user who is of a certain address, as in, you can achieve privacy versus with this brand new tool without being associated with any other specific address that you determine, aka one on the OFAC sanction.
00:55:36.882 - 00:56:13.518, Speaker A: So you can prove that you are not and are not interacting with an address on the OFAC sanction list. So let's know the OFAC Finson identifies this particular set of addresses. This is North Korea. This is a well known terrorist group. These people are bad actors. You can prove your innocence essentially using this tool now. And so this should defang all of the reasons that the code itself and let's remind people, the Tornado Cash code itself, the smart contract on chain.
00:56:13.518 - 00:56:35.674, Speaker A: If you live in the US. OFAC Finson. The US. Has made it illegal for you to have on chain privacy because they're saying you might be one of these bad actors, but now you can prove your innocence. So doesn't this David, defang the whole, I guess, front of Finson saying, yeah, this is because terrorists and criminals, and.
00:56:35.792 - 00:56:41.082, Speaker B: It takes away the whole entire premise of making the Tornado Cash smart contracts illegal in the first place?
00:56:41.216 - 00:56:43.578, Speaker A: There you move. Your move.
00:56:43.664 - 00:57:03.780, Speaker B: I think Amin people who have listened to Bankless know I have, like, infinite respect for Amin. He's the guy that will go toe to toe with Goliath in a heartbeat without thinking. He really oh, he's a sower of chaos in the best of ways, like chaotic, the embodiment of chaotic. Good. I hope he deploys it on base.
00:57:04.630 - 00:57:05.346, Speaker A: On base?
00:57:05.448 - 00:57:07.806, Speaker B: On base. Chain. Yeah. Privacy pools on base.
00:57:07.848 - 00:57:12.790, Speaker A: That'll be fun. I'm sure Coinbase Compliance and Legal has really appreciated that you just said that, David.
00:57:13.610 - 00:57:17.750, Speaker B: Well, permissionless code. They made their chain permissionless. They know what they signed up for.
00:57:17.820 - 00:57:24.086, Speaker A: Let's see. Let's see how it goes. I mean, we want a free permissionless, open Internet. So let's push that boundary here's more.
00:57:24.108 - 00:57:26.170, Speaker B: Yeah. Privacypools.com is the place to go.
00:57:26.240 - 00:57:28.394, Speaker A: There we go. All right. Also bankless.com.
00:57:28.432 - 00:57:30.074, Speaker B: Also after bankless.com.
00:57:30.112 - 00:57:39.146, Speaker A: Yeah. Make that your next visit. Uniswap Labs, they introduced a mobile wallet. David, you and I got a chance to sit down with Cal, who is kind of the lead product design of this wallet.
00:57:39.178 - 00:57:39.982, Speaker B: It's pretty cool.
00:57:40.116 - 00:57:41.150, Speaker A: I really liked it.
00:57:41.220 - 00:57:42.350, Speaker B: I'm very bullish.
00:57:43.650 - 00:57:58.562, Speaker A: Apple has blocked them from launching in the App Store right now, but it is available on test flight. Unfortunately, we don't have an access code for you. In order to get that, you had to be listening to the conversation we had earlier this week, and there were about 100 of them. But here's David. He's showing. Off.
00:57:58.616 - 00:58:04.066, Speaker B: I got he's showing off his $48.87 and a crypto covenant.
00:58:04.178 - 00:58:18.890, Speaker A: Well, that's worth something. And the access code itself is worth something because it'd be pretty cool to use this wallet. I don't know, I'm pretty bullish on the future of this. I really like the designs. Nice and clean. I think Uniswap is dedicated towards iterating. On it.
00:58:18.890 - 00:58:24.940, Speaker A: A lot of cool things in store and bullish wallets in general. Wallet innovation in general, certainly.
00:58:25.550 - 00:59:08.010, Speaker B: Moving on to rocketpool is set to launch their eight ether mini pools. Okay, how does Rocket pool work? You have the node operator who spins up a node in the decentralized rocket pool network. They need to put up a bond to make sure that they don't do anything funky with the other people who come and deposit ether into their node. So what do you do? You put in 16 ether, one half of what it takes to spin up a node. Other people backfill that with 16 more ether and boom, you have a rocket pool mini node and 16 our ether is minted and distributed into the wild. That is a capital intensive way to produce a staked ETH token. And while the capital intensity is how we get decentralization and security, it is still capital intensive.
00:59:08.010 - 00:59:55.062, Speaker B: Rocket pool has created this system called mini pools, which actually lowers the collateral requirement down to eight. So instead of putting up a 16 ETH bond, you put an eight ETH bond. And instead of that being a one to one ratio of your ether to other people's ether, it is a one to three ratio where you put in eight ether and then 24 ether comes in to create three different rocket pool mini nodes. And so the capital efficiency of RPL doubles. And then also if you are a node operator, you increase the amount of fees that you charge the people who use your node to stake as well. So if you are a node operator, you're getting more yield and the total supply of our ETH goes up. This is a very long awaited upgrade from the rocket pool community by rocket pool.
00:59:55.062 - 01:00:03.530, Speaker B: It's actually not launched yet. It's coming. It's in no later than early April, which is one month away. That's pretty hype. Very hype.
01:00:03.610 - 01:00:22.766, Speaker A: This is Rocket Pool getting more capital efficient, which is bullish. And also our ETH is now on Euler, which is a lending and borrowing marketplace. A permissionless lending and borrowing marketplace. Similar, I guess, to Aave and compound. It's cool to see liquid staking derivatives saturating all of our DeFi lending platforms.
01:00:22.878 - 01:00:40.598, Speaker B: Yeah, our friends at Coinbase Staking and others, liquid staking tokens. Ryan would request that you call them liquid staking tokens, not liquid staking derivatives, because derivatives have a very specific legal meaning. Somebody's going to slap me, but no worries. Disclaimer. Sorry.
01:00:40.684 - 01:00:44.006, Speaker A: They are derivatives though. For real, though? Sure. We just can't call them that.
01:00:44.028 - 01:00:44.514, Speaker B: Semantics.
01:00:44.562 - 01:00:44.930, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:00:45.020 - 01:00:54.910, Speaker B: Disclaimer Bankless holds a bunch of RPL and we also run rocket pool mini nodes. And then Ryan and I are also angel investors into Euler and bullish ETH.
01:00:55.490 - 01:01:03.598, Speaker A: Certainly Polymarket tweeting out here. David, looks like someone knows something about the Arbitrum AirDrop. What is this? What is this graph we're looking at?
01:01:03.684 - 01:01:57.682, Speaker B: Polymarket is a predictions market that allows people to gamble about the probability of future events. And the theory behind prediction markets is that if one or a very low number of people know something, that they can sway the entire market because they can make a gamble. So if they know that the Arbitrum AirDrop is coming by March 31, they would go to this Polymarket market and they would bet that on the knowledge that they have. And so, as of recently, the probability that an Arbitrum AirDrop comes by March 31 on Polymarket has moved to greater than 50% chance. And so the implication here is that someone knows something and has taken a bet on that market. I took this tweet into the Arbitrum, our telegram with the Arbitrum team. Ryan I was like, hey, you guys wouldn't drop a token without scheduling a live stream with us first, right? And they were like, they didn't say anything.
01:01:57.816 - 01:02:03.970, Speaker A: They didn't say anything. They said, you never know, but you'll be first to know when we do if we do that kind of thing, right?
01:02:04.040 - 01:02:11.800, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly as we'd expect. So here's something that is not news, but is perhaps news. We don't know.
01:02:12.490 - 01:02:13.730, Speaker A: Another rumor, David.
01:02:13.810 - 01:02:14.546, Speaker B: Another rumor.
01:02:14.578 - 01:02:15.330, Speaker A: Perpetuating.
01:02:15.410 - 01:02:15.954, Speaker B: Thank you, Ryan.
01:02:16.002 - 01:02:33.246, Speaker A: More rumors of rumors. Cosmos Governance. They gave the green light to interchange security. I remember Zaki telling us a little bit about this when we had them on the episode for the Cosmos thesis. If you want to hear about that, you can go listen to that episode in the archive at where David? Where can they go?
01:02:33.268 - 01:02:40.430, Speaker B: Find that bankless.com. That's it. Bankless.com. Go there right now.
01:02:40.500 - 01:02:47.074, Speaker A: Yes. Anyway, they're actually doing it. So what does this mean? What is interchange security? Right.
01:02:47.112 - 01:03:32.634, Speaker B: So Cosmos, it is the app chain mesh network vision. It is basically the Ethereum layer two, layer three vision without the layer one. So if you only have networks connected to other networks and you don't have the single shared security model of Ethereum, that's Cosmos it's a mesh. Cosmos has given the green light to interchange security. That is cosmos becoming more like ethereum. So they are starting to enshrine Cosmos hub as the central security provider for the rest of all app chains that opt into that security, which is kind of like the Ethereum l two thesis. And so Adam is starting to fill these shoes that Ether is for Ethereum token.
01:03:32.682 - 01:03:33.594, Speaker A: It's a cosmos. Token.
01:03:33.642 - 01:03:51.234, Speaker B: Cosmos token. Yes, exactly. And so when I was talking to Sonny Ogerwald about this forever ago, he's like, yeah, the Cosmos and Ethereum long term conclusion of that design pattern is actually the same pattern. They have just started at different paths. Arbitrum. Excuse me? Not arbitram. Cosmos.
01:03:51.234 - 01:04:23.178, Speaker B: I got an Arbitrum token on my mind. Cosmos has opted in to prioritize the app chain mesh network vision first, shared security. Later, Ethereum did the shared security layer one first, also Etha's money first and now is now moving into layer twos and layer threes. The conclusion is the same. This is as the Ethereum layer two. Layer three super chain hyperscaling vision starts to unfold. Cosmos is also doing shared security and atoms as the reserve asset of Cosmos.
01:04:23.178 - 01:04:24.718, Speaker B: If the market wants it.
01:04:24.804 - 01:04:58.230, Speaker A: And I think this means if you're launching an app chain on Cosmos rather than bootstrap your own validator set, you just get to hire the atom holders as mercenaries for a fee, a gas fee, perhaps they're mercenaries, use their military instead, but you got to pay them because they're mercenaries. So that's cool to see and I think is value accrual related to Adam the token? At least it should be on the fundamentals. Let's talk about another token that started this whole crypto thing off. It's called bitcoin token. Bitcoin. Bitcoin's a token.
01:04:58.310 - 01:05:00.826, Speaker B: You just offended every single bitcoin maxi that listens to that.
01:05:00.928 - 01:05:02.966, Speaker A: It's a token, guys. They're all tokens.
01:05:02.998 - 01:05:04.550, Speaker B: It's not no, it's a coin.
01:05:04.630 - 01:05:08.186, Speaker A: I say bitcoin's a token. What is the difference between a token and a coin?
01:05:08.298 - 01:05:30.662, Speaker B: A token is an asset that is issued on top of another blockchain. A coin is the asset that is the native currency for the crypto economic system. Ether bitcoin is a coin. Uni token. Any ERC, 20 token is a token. Coins are innately related to blockchains. You can't have a crypto system.
01:05:30.662 - 01:05:46.986, Speaker B: You cannot make a blockchain without creating an economic security model. And so therefore, every single crypto economic system has to have the economic part, the security part, which is the coin, the currency, the gas, ether, bitcoin. I feel like this is a simple answer.
01:05:47.088 - 01:05:54.640, Speaker A: You win this round, David Hoffman. You win. You got that was a good answer. Maybe I was teeing you up for that. Fantastic answer.
01:05:56.450 - 01:05:59.162, Speaker B: We just wanted to teach a quick lesson. Quick lesson.
01:05:59.306 - 01:06:09.890, Speaker A: All right, so this is Roll Kit saying you can now run a sovereign roll up on Bitcoin. Wait a second. I didn't know Bitcoin could have a roll up. Is that possible? What is this?
01:06:09.960 - 01:06:13.486, Speaker B: Apparently it's been possible for a very long time, just no developer has figured.
01:06:13.518 - 01:06:14.306, Speaker A: That out right now.
01:06:14.408 - 01:06:43.434, Speaker B: Yeah. So sovereign roll ups on bitcoin now a thing. This is a Tweet out of Roll Kit dev, a modular framework for roll ups. And so this is a toolkit to produce sovereign roll ups on Bitcoin. Okay, why are we emphasizing the sovereign word? A sovereign roll up is different from a side chain, which is a chain that just what is a side chain? Actually, it's just like another normal validator chain, its own validator set that like checkpoints to a different blockchain.
01:06:43.482 - 01:06:46.350, Speaker A: Kind of doesn't have to just checkpoint to itself.
01:06:46.500 - 01:07:12.440, Speaker B: A sovereign chain. A sovereign roll up is a roll up that puts all of its data on a dominant chain, a bigger chain, and all of the data that it puts onto that chain can be used to reconstruct the roll up state. So it is much more trustless than a side chain. So bitcoin has advanced in the layer two trustless, layer two phase, well beyond liquid. God, all the ass hats at liquid. I hope they're just embarrassed. I know they're not, though.
01:07:14.010 - 01:07:52.114, Speaker A: Can we call this give me the case for why we can call this a roll up. I understand you're saying it's a sovereign roll up, but is it really a roll up? And this is a tweet that I'm going to read where I think somebody was asking Eric Wall that question. Let me pull it up. This is mahalo asking Eric Wall commenting on his tweet, being excited about this, and mahalo says that is not a roll up, though. There are no fraud ZK proofs. You're not actually doing the fraud ZK proof on the layer one. You're just doing the data layer, the data storage on the layer one, which does that make it a roll up, David, or is this something else?
01:07:52.312 - 01:07:57.506, Speaker B: I'm going to answer your question with a really annoying response. A ZK rollup doesn't have ZK proofs.
01:07:57.538 - 01:07:59.574, Speaker A: Ryan what do you mean?
01:07:59.692 - 01:08:02.898, Speaker B: A ZK rollup does not use ZK knowledge proofs.
01:08:02.994 - 01:08:07.160, Speaker A: No fraud or ZK proofs. I'm quoting mahalo here.
01:08:07.610 - 01:08:11.798, Speaker B: Sure. Validity proofs is what a ZK rollup actually uses.
01:08:11.894 - 01:08:15.098, Speaker A: Somebody who went to east Denver, and I did not actually.
01:08:15.264 - 01:08:17.882, Speaker B: That little bit of knowledge came from Starkware sessions. There you go.
01:08:17.936 - 01:08:20.106, Speaker A: Well, look, there's advantages to being a.
01:08:20.128 - 01:08:32.906, Speaker B: Conference or yeah, this is going to break my brain to try and explain. This is one of those I have to go back to basics about, like, okay, how does it work again? Oh, yeah, this works like that. I don't know. Ask me. Hello, Ryan.
01:08:33.018 - 01:08:58.562, Speaker A: I think we lose something here, and I'm not sure what. 100% as far as settlement assurances, I don't think that this is quite the same as a ZK roll up or an optimistic roll up on ethereum, because it's not doing the fraud and validity proving on the layer one. But I'm not sure from a user perspective what we've lost here, what security guarantees, settlement guarantees we've lost.
01:08:58.706 - 01:09:09.114, Speaker B: I'm going to let you be the negative Nancy of bitcoin of this episode. I'm going to say I am just happy that the pendulum in the bitcoin ecosystem has moved very quickly.
01:09:09.152 - 01:09:10.674, Speaker A: That they're even having these conversations.
01:09:10.742 - 01:09:29.218, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. That this is happening. The fundamentalist maxis are losing their control over the bitcoin narrative, and the builders and innovators and optimists of the bitcoin ecosystem are getting pigeonholes to finally grasp onto and take back bitcoin from the crypto luddites of the world.
01:09:29.304 - 01:09:32.418, Speaker A: That's it. Build back bitcoin, take it back.
01:09:32.504 - 01:09:32.850, Speaker B: Yes.
01:09:32.920 - 01:09:48.214, Speaker A: Maybe that's happening. Maybe the builders are coming and taking it back. Yeah, no, I'm not going to be bearish on that. I'm actually very bullish that these types of conversations are happening. I was just wondering what the difference is. So we'll flag that. Maybe I'll ask Mahalo or somebody else.
01:09:48.252 - 01:09:55.114, Speaker B: Who could tell me it's not some magical cool new roll up that's any better than you can do on a smart contracting layer, that's for sure.
01:09:55.152 - 01:09:56.074, Speaker A: Yes, and I think it might.
01:09:56.112 - 01:10:00.006, Speaker B: But it's something. It's something good for bitcoin.
01:10:00.038 - 01:10:11.230, Speaker A: I'm very bullish about this. Yuga Labs. This is also maybe good for bitcoin. Yuga Labs just made 16.5 million in the first bitcoin NFT auction. What is this, David?
01:10:11.570 - 01:10:48.746, Speaker B: So they have created a set of NFTs on the bitcoin ordinals protocol. They did this funky little auction mechanism where they took in bitcoin deposits from people and then took in their bids for what those bitcoin transfers would be. And then they said, okay, and then they did the auction, and then they returned all the extra bitcoins that people lost. And so $16.5 million in revenue for Yuga Labs for their 288 NFTs that they minted. The top bids were seven bitcoin and four bitcoin, which was insane. And they made $16.5
01:10:48.746 - 01:10:50.490, Speaker B: million in 24 hours.
01:10:50.640 - 01:10:53.030, Speaker A: Were people upset at how?
01:10:53.120 - 01:10:54.682, Speaker B: Extremely upset.
01:10:54.746 - 01:10:55.262, Speaker A: Really? Why?
01:10:55.316 - 01:11:14.446, Speaker B: What was because of the auction mechanism? Basically, they were their own I don't even know what to call it. Custodian. So people would say they would say, hey, send us your bitcoin and your bid amount, and then we will run this auction in our private black box closed environment, and then we will determine the winners and spit back out all the money to the auction.
01:11:14.478 - 01:11:14.862, Speaker A: Loser.
01:11:14.926 - 01:11:15.570, Speaker B: Completely back.
01:11:15.640 - 01:11:19.254, Speaker A: Terrible. That is not decentralized nor credibly neutral at all.
01:11:19.452 - 01:11:27.686, Speaker B: Hence the limitations of a blockchain that doesn't have a native smart contracting layer on it. Yes, it's very not bankless whatsoever, the.
01:11:27.708 - 01:11:30.066, Speaker A: Auction mechanism itself, but the actual mechanism.
01:11:30.098 - 01:12:05.342, Speaker B: Was bad and broken. Yeah, I mean, I don't think there did anything bad or anything, but the point is that well, we don't know, do we? Here's Casey's tweet, which is extremely spicy. Dear Yuga Labs, this ordinal's Twitter account that he's retweeting is correct. Actions like this prove that for some entities and for people, once a shitcoiner, always a shitcoiner. If I personally, Casey Rotomore, ever see you Luga Labs, the entity, fuck around with degenerate bullshit like this again, I will wash my hands of you forever and encourage others, including those close to me, to do the same. Get f'd, you highly regarded morons. Casey Bordemore.
01:12:05.342 - 01:12:06.114, Speaker B: Wow.
01:12:06.312 - 01:12:07.646, Speaker A: Casey Rotimore.
01:12:07.838 - 01:12:09.346, Speaker B: I had him on bank list with Eric Wall.
01:12:09.368 - 01:12:10.706, Speaker A: He's that casey.
01:12:10.738 - 01:12:13.430, Speaker B: This is the creator of the Ordinals protocol, bro.
01:12:13.580 - 01:12:16.230, Speaker A: And he is really pissed that they're using it in this way.
01:12:16.300 - 01:12:36.746, Speaker B: Well, I don't think he really cares about them being bad. He thinks that they are setting a precedent for spammers and attackers. Any bad person who sees this model is like, oh, I can just copy what Yuga Labs did and people will send me their bitcoins and I'll tell them I'll just give back the losers, but then I'll just run off with it. It does set a bad precedent.
01:12:36.778 - 01:12:48.782, Speaker A: You know what? I wasn't on that episode of Casey, but I listened to it. I really like this guy. I respect this guy. He's a new class of bitcoin builders. And look at him taking a stand against faulty auction mechanics.
01:12:48.926 - 01:12:57.842, Speaker B: He's got the spicy, sharp edges that bitcoiners have. And he's also got this builder. It's a new character arc of bitcoiner. You're totally right.
01:12:57.896 - 01:13:03.046, Speaker A: I like it. And of course, a whole bunch of bitcoin fundamentalists hate him for even doing that.
01:13:03.068 - 01:13:20.538, Speaker B: Certainly. Yeah. But I'd have never aligned with the fundamentalists, ever. Okay, so here is the update of bitcoin block space fees. Because of the Ordinals, bitcoin block space demand was up for four weeks in a row. It then became down for two weeks in a row. And that was last week.
01:13:20.538 - 01:13:41.234, Speaker B: In the last ten days or so, it is up very big. I'm pretty sure that spike at the very far end has got to be this Yuga Labs ordinals demand. But the power shifting back into the favor of ordinals are here to stay. So we'll see how this pendulum shifts left and right. But we had some very big weeks in bitcoin block space demand in the last week or so.
01:13:41.272 - 01:13:42.162, Speaker A: I like it.
01:13:42.296 - 01:13:44.194, Speaker B: I love this is so fun. Yeah.
01:13:44.232 - 01:13:47.234, Speaker A: It's been a while since bitcoin put a big smile on my face, but.
01:13:47.352 - 01:13:49.278, Speaker B: It'S doing really cool stuff.
01:13:49.464 - 01:13:50.610, Speaker A: I'm enjoying this arc.
01:13:50.690 - 01:13:52.962, Speaker B: I'm loving the pluralism coming out of bitcoin.
01:13:53.026 - 01:13:57.558, Speaker A: I like this new season of bitcoin. Yeah, 2023 season is great. Good job.
01:13:57.644 - 01:14:04.614, Speaker B: Creators of the show thankless listeners are like, I never thought this was possible. They just had to do stuff. Yeah, they had to enable builders.
01:14:04.662 - 01:14:22.190, Speaker A: Man. This is Amazon news that hit crypto this week. Amazon NFTs will be tied to real world assets. Tokens are possible. Amazon stepping into the NFT world, it sounds like. We're not exactly sure what this means. What do you make of this? Do we have any details?
01:14:23.890 - 01:14:42.280, Speaker B: I don't have too many details. They are working. Here's a statement. For instance, people would be able to purchase a fashion oriented NFT tied to a pair of jeans. So I think this is real world. High value physical items paired with an NFT. How they managed to do that, I don't know.
01:14:42.280 - 01:14:54.314, Speaker B: It's not clear what's going on here. But it is clear that something's happening. My take here is that someone is advising Amazon on what to do and how to do it.
01:14:54.352 - 01:15:00.874, Speaker A: Or maybe do you think there's a small skunkworks team working inside of Amazon that are, like, bankless listeners and are hearing this?
01:15:00.992 - 01:15:02.486, Speaker B: If there is, they're definitely bankless listeners.
01:15:02.518 - 01:15:03.842, Speaker A: And hit us in telegram.
01:15:04.006 - 01:15:05.502, Speaker B: Someone hit us up.
01:15:05.556 - 01:15:10.830, Speaker A: Give us some details so that we know more about this but not break any NDAs of course.
01:15:10.980 - 01:15:11.886, Speaker B: Of course not.
01:15:11.988 - 01:15:12.830, Speaker A: Yeah, it's cool.
01:15:12.900 - 01:15:14.926, Speaker B: We're not journalists. We're a thesis driven media company.
01:15:14.948 - 01:15:15.214, Speaker A: That's right.
01:15:15.252 - 01:15:16.110, Speaker B: Not journalists at all.
01:15:16.180 - 01:15:36.662, Speaker A: That's right bankless.com. We keep secrets. Let's monitor that as we get new news. David, multicoin Capital, their hedge fund, lost 91% in 2022. That was last year, of course. Big loss. Is this a big loss, or is this just like, the average crypto investor's portfolio? What's your take here?
01:15:36.796 - 01:15:55.200, Speaker B: It is a big loss. It's certainly worse than the average crypto person's portfolio. I've been known to be a multi coin disagreeer, at the very least. I was initially ready to grave dance, but then I looked at my portfolio, I was like, well, okay.
01:15:59.170 - 01:16:00.126, Speaker A: You'Re not down.
01:16:00.228 - 01:16:13.886, Speaker B: I'm not down. 91.4% not nearly that bad. But you can like 2022 was a bad year. Yes, Multicoin had very significant exposure to both, I'm assuming FTX, I think rumors on that one, David.
01:16:13.918 - 01:16:15.534, Speaker A: They lost a lot of funds in FTX.
01:16:15.582 - 01:16:17.582, Speaker B: Yeah, they had money in FTX. Yeah, right.
01:16:17.656 - 01:16:20.278, Speaker A: The old fashioned way. They got scammed by SBF, had a.
01:16:20.284 - 01:16:37.978, Speaker B: Ton of exposure to salana, and so, like yes, Multicoin Capital down 91.4%. That looks pretty damn bad. That sucks. They should have sold more, obviously. But also, reminder, like, 2022 was a very bad year, and they were probably up decently big in 2021.
01:16:38.144 - 01:16:41.110, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Do you remember, Ryan?
01:16:41.190 - 01:16:43.450, Speaker B: You fly very high, you fall very fast.
01:16:43.520 - 01:16:49.822, Speaker A: Ryan Selkis's end of the year report. Multicoin were, like, the big winners of 2021. Yeah.
01:16:49.956 - 01:17:04.002, Speaker B: I would just like to talk to some of the Multicoin LPs and investors, because the real signal here is like, are they happy? And I would like to hear more about that. I've heard my rumors. I've heard that people are upset. I haven't heard anything more beyond that.
01:17:04.056 - 01:17:07.970, Speaker A: Yeah, there's also rumors. We shouldn't say any more. Rumors.
01:17:08.050 - 01:17:08.578, Speaker B: Rumors.
01:17:08.674 - 01:17:17.906, Speaker A: We got slapped last week. But when hedge fund founders sell the top as well, it tends to leave a bad taste in everyone's mouth.
01:17:17.938 - 01:17:18.306, Speaker B: Bad taste.
01:17:18.338 - 01:17:19.894, Speaker A: And also calling this thing don't take.
01:17:19.932 - 01:17:23.558, Speaker B: A zoom, call in a Ferrari. Don't do that. That's not a rumor.
01:17:23.574 - 01:17:24.474, Speaker A: That did happen, by the way.
01:17:24.512 - 01:17:25.974, Speaker B: That did happen. That is confirmed.
01:17:26.022 - 01:17:43.086, Speaker A: Yeah, it is. I think OD. Sometimes when people hear the term hedge fund, which is supposed to hedge you against risk and they see a 91.4% loss, it's really not how these funds operate in crypto. They're more like just liquid VC firms, almost.
01:17:43.188 - 01:17:53.682, Speaker B: I don't operate a hedge fund. I don't intend on operating a hedge fund. I think if you are up some bajillion percentage points and at some point it's your duty to hit the sell button.
01:17:53.736 - 01:17:57.490, Speaker A: Is it? I wish I could take my advice. I don't do that personally. I never hit sell.
01:17:57.640 - 01:18:01.814, Speaker B: Yeah, well, you're not operating a hedge fund. You're operating a media business.
01:18:01.932 - 01:18:06.886, Speaker A: True. David, what's this story? This is crazy. I think this is a follow up to our story last week, right?
01:18:06.988 - 01:18:20.890, Speaker B: Yeah. So last week, a judge ruled that rocket ship, upward chart and money bags emojis can be construed as financial advice. A second judge has ruled that the shruggy emoji completely nullifies all previous emojis.
01:18:22.030 - 01:18:23.498, Speaker A: This is great news.
01:18:23.664 - 01:18:27.754, Speaker B: Yeah. So you can just say whatever you want and then you end your tweet with a shrug.
01:18:27.882 - 01:18:28.270, Speaker A: Wow.
01:18:28.340 - 01:18:29.498, Speaker B: Not financial advice.
01:18:29.594 - 01:18:35.194, Speaker A: Yeah. That's all you have to do. That's a disclaimer. So a shrug can be a financial disclaimer, not financial advice.
01:18:35.322 - 01:18:41.922, Speaker B: At least this is. According to therug mirror XYZ I'm getting the sense that Ryan did not get rugged this week.
01:18:41.976 - 01:18:45.302, Speaker A: No, I saw it in the agenda. It almost got me and then I clicked it this time.
01:18:45.356 - 01:18:45.670, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:18:45.740 - 01:18:46.054, Speaker A: All right.
01:18:46.092 - 01:18:52.840, Speaker B: This is a pretty good one. I think this is actually a pretty good.
01:18:55.610 - 01:19:06.362, Speaker A: I think that if a rocket emoji means you're pumping your bags and you are soliciting or it's financial advice, then a shrug emoji should mean you are not doing those things.
01:19:06.496 - 01:19:15.866, Speaker B: Yeah, there's that meme out there where he's like the crypto investor, just tells his friend, totally buy this token, it's going to make us rich.
01:19:15.898 - 01:19:16.142, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:19:16.196 - 01:19:23.070, Speaker B: I don't know, though. You always finish up with Idk, though, so that you don't ruin their life. That's what the shrug emoji oh, that's great.
01:19:23.140 - 01:19:39.250, Speaker A: All right. I don't know, though. Perfect. We have a new disclaimer, actually, at the end of the Bankless podcast. We'll just replace it with I don't know, though, shrug emoji. Thank you, the rug, for bringing a little levity to the situation here. What's this? Invest in music.
01:19:39.250 - 01:19:43.958, Speaker A: Welcome to invest in music. Fans become collectors. That's cool. Sounds cool. What is it?
01:19:44.044 - 01:20:06.686, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a brand new podcast. New podcast on the scene for people who want to consume more podcasts than what Bankless can offer you. Although that's probably a surprise if you are into the world of music NFTs. This is a podcast out of Cooper Turley. And so if you want to keep up with the world of music NFTs and the growing economy that relates to investing in and sharing web3 music and other things of that nature, invest in Music is the new podcast for you.
01:20:06.708 - 01:20:20.034, Speaker A: So check it. Good idea. Very cool. All right, on the raises this week, there have been a bunch, but here's the one notable. One. Ethereum layer two, scroll, which is a ZK EVM. Layer two reaches 1.8
01:20:20.034 - 01:20:26.350, Speaker A: billion in valuation in their new funding round. That's a big valuation for a bear market valuation.
01:20:26.430 - 01:20:35.282, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. They raised $50 million. So $50 million in the bank at a $1.8 billion valuation. And disclaimer. Ryan and I are angel investors into scroll.
01:20:35.346 - 01:20:40.594, Speaker A: You said it in the bank. What bank you think they use? Hopefully it's not Silvergate Signature. Who knows?
01:20:40.722 - 01:20:47.130, Speaker B: I mean, that was the metaphorical bank, especially when it's USDC. Yeah, when we invested in scroll, we said USDC.
01:20:47.630 - 01:20:59.690, Speaker A: When is our language going to adapt to rather than say, in the bank or like, I still catch myself, I say we got money in the bank, or like, I'll write you a check and I'm not literally writing a check anymore.
01:20:59.770 - 01:21:00.110, Speaker B: Right.
01:21:00.180 - 01:21:01.694, Speaker A: It'll take some time to kind of catch up.
01:21:01.732 - 01:21:05.618, Speaker B: Oh, I think we still use the words it starts to mean something different.
01:21:05.704 - 01:21:06.340, Speaker A: Okay.
01:21:07.430 - 01:21:10.802, Speaker B: It just landed in my account. Because you sent it 5 seconds ago.
01:21:10.856 - 01:21:12.754, Speaker A: Yeah, that feels a lot better.
01:21:12.872 - 01:21:15.170, Speaker B: And I didn't have to wait jobs this week.
01:21:15.240 - 01:21:27.766, Speaker A: Of course, we got companies raising. That means we got companies hiring big one to point out this week. Bankless is hiring, of course, but I want to point this one out. Immutable wants a protocol blockchain engineer. This is layer two.
01:21:27.948 - 01:21:28.818, Speaker B: Very technical.
01:21:28.914 - 01:21:41.962, Speaker A: Yeah. Fantastic work in gaming. Gaming infrastructure, gaming platform. Go check this out. There's a whole bunch more jobs I could list, but I won't right now. Go check that out at the Banklist palette.com jobs board.
01:21:41.962 - 01:21:43.610, Speaker A: David, what do we got coming up next?
01:21:43.680 - 01:22:12.066, Speaker B: Coming up next, we got questions from the nation as well as the hot takes of the week, as well as the meme of the week, as well as what Ryan and David are bullish on. We'll probably chatter about some ETH. Denver stuff as well for those that want to stick around after all the news and just hear about what ETH. Denver was like. So all of that and more coming up as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. The phantom wallet is coming to Ethereum. The number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved UX to Ethereum and Polygon.
01:22:12.066 - 01:22:49.342, Speaker B: If you haven't used Phantom before, you've been missing out. Phantom was one of the first wallets to pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for Ethereum and polygon. But that's just staking. Phantom is also the best home for your NFTs. Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your NFT experience, pin your favorites, hide your Uglies, burn the spam, and also manage your NFT sale listings from inside the wallet. Phantom is, of course, a MultiChain wallet, but it makes chain management easy, displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or phishing websites. Phantom has already saved over 20,000 users from getting scammed or hacked.
01:22:49.342 - 01:23:34.826, Speaker B: So get on the Phantom Waitlist and be one of the first to access the MultiChain beta. There's a link in the show notes, or you can go to Phantom app Waitlist to get access. In late February, Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web3 landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems. With a recent addition of Arbitrum, nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home. Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees.
01:23:34.826 - 01:23:53.270, Speaker B: With Arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro, it's also now ten times faster than before. Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum experience. Web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap and friction free.
01:23:53.420 - 01:24:17.966, Speaker A: Question from COGI this week from the bankless Discord. Here it is. Is there some economic or technical reason that chains cannot use a stablecoin as the native token for gas? I know Terra did, but that was a unique setup. Which didn't work. Yes, it didn't. Why is there no chain? Using a fully collateralized stablecoin as gas and providing non inflationary staking rewards based on fees for blockspace? Seems like a good idea.
01:24:18.068 - 01:24:33.042, Speaker B: Interesting question. Yeah. I really love some of these questions that really illustrate to me where the question asker is on their journey down the crypto rabbit hole, this person is at the very starting to get into some really technical level questions like, why can't use stable coins for gas? Yeah, it's a good place.
01:24:33.096 - 01:24:34.834, Speaker A: Thinking of novel ideas here, right?
01:24:34.872 - 01:25:02.330, Speaker B: Yeah. Asking, why can't we do this? Is a great way to learn. Okay, so, great question. Why can't we use a stable coin for gas? Terra did, and so they said, Is there some economic or technical reason? And the answer is yes, both. Going back to when we were talking about tokens versus coins. Ryan, we need Ether, the coin of ethereum, to be the gas. Why do we need that? Well, because in proof of work so this also applies to bitcoin.
01:25:02.330 - 01:25:41.446, Speaker B: You need ether and bitcoin to have value because they are the things that economically secure systems the outside world calls the crypto industry, like blockchain. These are blockchains. A blockchain is actually just one part of a grander system of technologies that combine together, create what we know as like bitcoin or ethereum. The way that Vitalik and I've been using this language, have called these things crypto economic systems. And so it's a semblance of cryptography, a blockchain for a database and economics. You must have a native currency of a crypto economic system to be self sufficient and independent and autonomous because that's.
01:25:41.478 - 01:25:42.698, Speaker A: What secures the thing.
01:25:42.784 - 01:26:09.634, Speaker B: That's what secures the thing. Miners don't mind bitcoin unless bitcoin has value. Stakers don't stake Ether unless stakers have value. Where does that value come from? It comes from the entrined relationship between the economics of buying block space from bitcoin and buying block space from ethereum using the native currency. If you don't have that relationship between block space, demand. And currency of the chain, then why does that currency exist at all?
01:26:09.832 - 01:26:11.374, Speaker A: It has to be intrinsic.
01:26:11.502 - 01:26:42.326, Speaker B: That relationship must occur. That has to be and therefore, on the ethereum layer one, we cannot use Dai, for example, to pay for gas because we must enshrine the value of ether. So that is the economic reason. Also, in EIP 1559, this made this formal. So before EIP 1559, people were talking about like, oh, you can just pay miners OTC, you can venmo them to process your transactions. And that could have worked and actually still is true for bitcoin. Actually, bitcoin is actually not enshrined.
01:26:42.326 - 01:27:07.382, Speaker B: Miners can put things into the blockchain for zero bitcoins if you pay them in the pocket. So that's still a thing for bitcoin. In EIP 1559, it formally enshrined ether as the native currency of ethereum. So you can't route around ether. Ether must be burnt in order to make a transaction on ethereum. So that is the technical reason that you can do this. Now, what's cool is that that is true of the ethereum layer one.
01:27:07.382 - 01:27:41.038, Speaker B: That is not true of layer twos. You can use any token that you choose on a layer two to pay for gas. However, that layer two must pay for ether for layer one block space. But any layer two could use a stablecoin or any other type of asset for that matter, as gas coinbase chain, they would be violating securities laws, could tokenize the coin security and the coin equity, turn that into a token on base, and that could be the gas token for base. That's not what's happening. I just made that up.
01:27:41.124 - 01:27:49.662, Speaker A: By the way, theoretical possibility make way more sense in my opinion. Like securities laws aside, that would be like a much more aligned kind of ecosystem.
01:27:49.726 - 01:27:55.438, Speaker B: That would be very, very bullish for the coin asset. Sure. Except for the fact of violating securities laws. That part would bearish.
01:27:55.534 - 01:28:20.746, Speaker A: Yes. Now, okay, so tell me about by the way, I think that was a great answer. Thank you. A couple of things this triggered for me. But tell me about this new account abstraction ability where through a smart contract wallet, I actually don't have to pay for my ethereum gas fee with ETH, the token. Is that a thing that's happening? Is that part of what you meant by kind of the technical reason you.
01:28:20.768 - 01:28:42.154, Speaker B: Can'T okay, now onto New Horizons. Now we're talking about wallet design and account abstraction. What account abstraction does is that say you've got a brand new wallet and you throw 25 USDC in there. There's zero ETH in there, so you don't have any ether to pay for gas, and you would like to send that 25 USDC and outbound or do something with it or deposit into pull together, but you don't got any gas.
01:28:42.202 - 01:28:43.534, Speaker A: Yeah. Wouldn't it be nice? It would be nice.
01:28:43.572 - 01:29:10.486, Speaker B: Wouldn't it be nice? Yeah. So with account abstraction, you can have a different wallet pay your gas fee. And so you actually never have to have ether inside of your wallet. And you can still do crypto and DeFi things. Someone else on your behalf pays for your gas, but that person is still paying for gas. Yeah. The economic rules of you must use ether still apply to someone somewhere, but with account abstraction, you can change who's responsible for those rules.
01:29:10.518 - 01:29:40.390, Speaker A: A relay could pay for it. The smart contract wallet could kind of provide some reason to pay for it. All of those things. That was a great answer. Do you know the other thing that kind of reminded me of is when you were talking about yeah. In bitcoin, this is still an unsolved problem, that somebody could go in a telegram group and send someone money out of bound in order to reward them for processing their transaction first before everyone else. This is the problem of any mev minor extractable value.
01:29:40.390 - 01:30:21.666, Speaker A: And we could call it minor extractable value in the case of bitcoin. All this kind of throws to me is like with Bitcoin doing this ordinals thing and with Blockschase demand going up, my God, they're going to have to go solve all of the same problems that Ethereum has had to. Solve over the past three to four years, including challenges with their monetary policy and enshrining Bitcoin as the asset for blockspace. Also including issuance. And they're going to have to follow this exact same path and solve it whether they know it or not. Why? Because if your block space is demanded in the same way that ethereum is, then you're going to face the same challenges that ethereum did. It's hilarious to me.
01:30:21.666 - 01:30:25.390, Speaker A: Like, in a good way. Like, oh, that's sweet, you're growing.
01:30:25.470 - 01:30:26.402, Speaker B: Like, they're doing it.
01:30:26.456 - 01:30:30.594, Speaker A: You're doing it. Yeah. Anyway, they'll figure it out, I'm sure.
01:30:30.632 - 01:31:08.930, Speaker B: Okay, so that brings us to the take of the week, which, because you've said that, I'd like to skip to the last take of the week and we can go to the other ones first. This one from Wong Zhong Ayan. Sorry for butchering your name. Apologies. Who tweets out ethereum culture and technology is influencing bitcoin culture and technology. Now for people that have been around for last bear market, nick Carter says this, I believe Hazu also says this, or previously said this, is that ethereum culture is downstream of bitcoin culture in that bitcoin bitcoiners bitcoin is at the spearhead of the crypto movement and everything else is downstream of bitcoin, including ethereum. That was very true.
01:31:08.930 - 01:31:20.214, Speaker B: You and me, Ryan, being like in Anthony, Suzanne and all the others saying, like, ETH is money. That was us. Like being downstream trying to catch up. Trying to catch up. Right. Block space, demand, security, all that kind of stuff.
01:31:20.252 - 01:31:23.986, Speaker A: I learned about settlement assurances as well as you did from Nick Carter.
01:31:24.098 - 01:31:49.920, Speaker B: Exactly right. And so, so much of what is ethereum today, we learned from bitcoiners. Bitcoiners have stalled out, man. And now I think the tables have turned. And so ordinals all of what you just said, just like bitcoiners have to learn about enshrining, the value of BDC, all that kind of stuff. Now they have to do all the hard work that Ethereum has done over the last five years and they haven't done any of it because the fundamentalists have been in the lead. They've had control.
01:31:49.920 - 01:31:58.990, Speaker B: And so now we're finally bullish on bitcoin builders. But it's also now bearish because they now realize how far behind they are in this conversation.
01:31:59.070 - 01:32:05.746, Speaker A: It's going to require some protocol upgrades. And do they have the social layer, the layer zero that can adapt and sustain that?
01:32:05.768 - 01:32:06.530, Speaker B: I think they do.
01:32:06.600 - 01:32:13.346, Speaker A: Right. It's going to be an uphill battle and a challenge, but it's definitely cool to see. We got some other takes of the week. This is one from Mike Dudas.
01:32:13.458 - 01:32:36.714, Speaker B: Mike Dudas is retweeting two of Paul Krugman's very old tweets. One goes back to January of 2018 where Paul Krugman says cryptocurrency lets you make electronic transactions, but so do bank accounts, debit cards, PayPal, Venmo, all these other methods involving trusting a third party. But unless you're buying drugs, assassinations, that's not really a big deal. And so kind of disqualifying crypto.
01:32:36.762 - 01:32:39.134, Speaker A: All crypto payments are criminals, aren't they?
01:32:39.252 - 01:32:57.320, Speaker B: So fast forward to his tweet just now. So five years later. I've been using Venmo for years, says Paul Krubin, but now it won't allow me to make payments. I've spent a long time in chat with representatives. They told me they can't explain why or fix it. The software has taken control. Mighty how to turn tables in five.
01:33:00.410 - 01:33:20.330, Speaker A: You know, sometimes you don't realize it until it happens to like paul Krugman is an economist. Of course, he's said some pretty anti crypto things in the past, not seeing its utility. But until it happens to you in the country where you live or in the situation that you have in front of you, you actually don't appreciate the value.
01:33:20.480 - 01:33:33.950, Speaker B: It just always brings me back to my two mental models of people in the world. There's people that see crypto for what it can be in the future and then therefore believe in it today. And then there's people who see it for what it is today and see just like a fucking mess.
01:33:34.020 - 01:33:57.986, Speaker A: Yep, those are the two. I totally agree. Mark Andreessen, this is somewhat related. He said this I can't convince you to want freedom, but if you do want freedom, it can't come to you in the form of a centralized system, whether that's communism backdoor cryptography or centrally controlled AI. That was a good take. If you want freedom, it can't come built on top of centralized systems.
01:33:58.098 - 01:34:04.506, Speaker B: Love it very true. It cuts so deep for what we're trying to do here. Yeah, crypto is here to set you free.
01:34:04.688 - 01:34:07.242, Speaker A: Absolutely. David, what are you bullish about?
01:34:07.376 - 01:34:44.310, Speaker B: Oh, God. I am bullish on the Bankless nation. Man are you? So people who listen to Bankless will know that I'm very, very bullish on ETH Denver as an event because it was the place that I decided that I'm going to just yeet myself out of my previous life and do whatever this crypto thing means. So I was like, alone, going off to ETH Denver with zero friends and I just like, awkwardly first day of school. Oh, my God, it is the first day of school. Had I didn't know anyone in ETH Denver, so I just gave this person my phone, like, hey, can you take a photo of me in front of this sign? And here's that photo. Fast forward.
01:34:44.310 - 01:35:14.938, Speaker B: Five years later, we're at the first ever Bankless meetup and there's 150 people here and we had to keep it a secret because we knew that it was just going to be overwhelmed. So shout out to everyone that came for the Bankless meetup and had the free beer at the brewery. It was a fantastic time. I enjoyed meeting absolutely everyone. Ryan I got up on stage, grabbed a microphone, zero plans whatsoever, and just started talking for a little bit and ended up just like, thanking all of the HQ team for all the support. It's cool, it's great to have company. It's dangerous to go alone.
01:35:14.938 - 01:35:21.902, Speaker B: And the fact that 150 people want to show up for the same movement that I saw five years ago is just incredibly humbling.
01:35:21.966 - 01:35:29.602, Speaker A: Yeah, it is. It's super humbling. This is the other how it started, how it started, how it's going, only in like a positive way.
01:35:29.656 - 01:35:34.566, Speaker B: It's going pretty well. So that's what I'm bullish on. What are you bullish on?
01:35:34.588 - 01:35:54.094, Speaker A: Ryan look, I'm going to say it again. Bankless.com. Bankless 20. I just want to take a moment because we talked about it already so much, about why we're doing this, I think. And the big reason is because it was time to get more freedom. David and kind of time to set sail. Yeah, at a high level.
01:35:54.094 - 01:36:21.910, Speaker A: I mean, Substack is kind of its own platform a bit more that's the platform we were using for our newsletter and for Bankless premium membership and that sort of thing. It was constraining. We couldn't build crypto features on top of it. So we set sail, we created our own path, we created some more white space. It's been a tremendous effort. This is just the beginning, though. That's what excites me the most, because now we can start building on top of this platform.
01:36:21.910 - 01:37:17.606, Speaker A: And I just want to take a minute to thank the entire Bankless team that has made this possible. In particular, I want to thank Jason and James, who are our key web devs and front end experts that actually brought this to fruition, and of course, our entire newsletter team, Alpha team and the Pod squad. For Populating, all the content is a fantastic job and I want to thank you, Bankless listener. We appreciate you guys a lot. The picture that David was just showing you, I was asking David like, oh, so how is the Bankless Nation? When you meet people from the Bankless community, how are they in person? Are they cool? Do they have good vibes? Do they like us? Yeah, it's like these are all united people with a shared set of values and it's so cool. They're instant friends, right? Right. And we would not be able to kind of launch this and carry this movement forward.
01:37:17.606 - 01:37:24.102, Speaker A: We really consider ourselves in this whole headless brand of the Bankless movement, just torch bearers. We're just trying to set the path.
01:37:24.246 - 01:37:25.354, Speaker B: Trying to show the way.
01:37:25.392 - 01:37:47.090, Speaker A: Yeah. Bankless is for everyone, and now we have more resources to do it. And we have those resources because you tune in every week to this show and support us because some subset of you have become Bankless citizens and are taking that journey with you, with us. And we just appreciate you all. It's just fantastic. So thank you. Thank you to everyone who made this possible.
01:37:47.090 - 01:37:48.702, Speaker A: This is just the beginning.
01:37:48.846 - 01:38:09.254, Speaker B: Yeah, we've been wanting a website for a while, but we've wanted to also do it right. And this is finally a website that we just feel so damn good about. And like Ryan said, it is just the beginning and meaning that now we have our own vehicle, our own ship, our own structure to do cool things on top of.
01:38:09.292 - 01:38:11.270, Speaker A: David, did you send me a cool thing?
01:38:11.420 - 01:38:40.414, Speaker B: I just sent you a cool thing. I got it open first thing. That you can already do something Bankless Nation on the Bankless site, which is if you already are subscribed to Bankless. If you already have given us your email address to receive the newsletter or the podcast or whatever, you can go mint a PO app. And Ryan's about to show the POAP on the screen because it's ship season, because we are sailing west. So this is the inaugural PO app for Christening, if you will, the Bankless website. It's a ship because we're sailing west.
01:38:40.414 - 01:38:44.382, Speaker B: It's a ship because it's ship season. And it's just really just a badass.
01:38:44.446 - 01:38:48.594, Speaker A: First time I've seen this, man. I love this. Shout out to Logan, who produced this.
01:38:48.632 - 01:38:52.194, Speaker B: For us on his birthday, by the way. Sorry for making that request, Logan.
01:38:52.242 - 01:38:55.030, Speaker A: Thank you. And look, we got the black flags at the top. Do you see that?
01:38:55.100 - 01:38:55.734, Speaker B: It's so good.
01:38:55.772 - 01:38:56.022, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:38:56.076 - 01:39:16.810, Speaker B: So if you want to mint the POAP, you go to Bankless.com, sign in with the email address that you've already created an account. If you have not yet already created account, I'm sorry, you can't mint the PO app because of anti sibyl and spam mechanisms. We have to gate it to people who have already given us their email addresses. Otherwise people will attack the system, go with the POAP, and celebrate us sailing westward. We're going west.
01:39:16.970 - 01:39:21.502, Speaker A: This is awesome. All right, David, let's end here. Meme of the week. What are we looking at this week?
01:39:21.636 - 01:39:26.566, Speaker B: So this was the toilet paper at East Denver. It was a roll of toilet paper. Was this everywhere?
01:39:26.618 - 01:39:27.166, Speaker A: Are you serious?
01:39:27.198 - 01:39:37.960, Speaker B: It was quite a lot of places, yeah. Wow. This is Sam Beckman fried on toilet paper. So if you ever took a number two, you wiped your butt with Sam Beckman fried's face.
01:39:38.490 - 01:39:41.430, Speaker A: Did you get the opportunity, David, or is that a personal question?
01:39:41.500 - 01:39:44.198, Speaker B: I'll leave that up for the Bankless nation to wonder about.
01:39:44.284 - 01:39:45.510, Speaker A: For the imagination.
01:39:47.130 - 01:39:48.150, Speaker B: Picture that.
01:39:48.300 - 01:39:54.922, Speaker A: That's been the end. That's it, guys, we got a cool moment of Zen for you again, celebrating the new Bankless 20 website.
01:39:55.056 - 01:39:57.898, Speaker B: If you're it won't really make sense, so watch this, okay?
01:39:57.984 - 01:40:05.290, Speaker A: Yeah. Watch YouTube. Risks and disclaimers, guys. Crypto is risky. You could definitely lose what you put in. But we're headed west. This is the frontier.
01:40:05.290 - 01:40:12.554, Speaker A: It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. This has not been financial advice. Shrug emoji.
01:40:12.602 - 01:40:13.710, Speaker B: Shrug emoji.
01:40:17.970 - 01:40:19.040, Speaker C: Here we go.
01:40:50.050 - 01:40:52.942, Speaker A: So pretty, isn't it? Wow.
01:40:53.076 - 01:40:57.166, Speaker C: When the bus moved and I saw that house for the first time in.
01:40:57.188 - 01:41:00.654, Speaker A: My wildest dreams, I never could have.
01:41:00.692 - 01:41:03.210, Speaker C: Imagined something so gorgeous.
