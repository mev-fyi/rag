00:00:08.170 - 00:00:25.794, Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better and how to frontfront the opportunity. I'm Ryan Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bankless. David, we finally got him, Hayden Adams.
00:00:25.842 - 00:01:29.334, Speaker B: On the podcast, ladies and gentlemen, we got him Hayden Adams, the creator of Uniswap. We go through the entire history of Uniswap, starting when it was just a blog post from Vitalik on Reddit. I think going into Hayden getting laid off and being convinced by his good friend Carl Florish that he's going to all of a sudden become an expert on Ethereum building and DFI. And turns out that's exactly what happened. And so Hayden takes us through the story of Uniswap from inception to where we are today with Uniswap v three to where we are going tomorrow, which is Uniswap being the world's largest asset exchange platform in the world. And it's been a fantastic story. And there's so many different detours and turns that we take because it's interesting every step of the way and there's so much value to be derived from this conversation because not only is it the story of Uniswap, but it's the story of Ethereum at large as well, because it's such an emblematic of what it means to build something on Ethereum.
00:01:29.334 - 00:01:31.500, Speaker B: I had a fantastic time talking with.
00:01:32.510 - 00:02:13.542, Speaker A: Is just, I feel like this is going to be one of those legendary stories that the world hasn't yet. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in their garage right in Menlo park, that area. Or like Bill Gates, the story of Bill Gates. Or know Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook, all of these things now that says bad connotations these days, but it's that important. And it still hasn't escaped in mainstream. This is one individual, very first software development project able to disrupt the entire financial economy by building code on top of Ethereum. No one believed that this thing would work.
00:02:13.542 - 00:02:41.870, Speaker A: This was at a time when Ethereum was dead. And lo and behold, it just surpasses. In the last six months, surpassed the volume of Coinbase. And if you listen to Hayden, you come out of this episode incredibly bullish. You come out of this episode believing that Uniswap could one day surpass the volume of traditional finance like SP 500 and Nasdaq. Such a compelling story, such an Ethereum centric story. So honored to be one of the ones kind of talking about it early.
00:02:41.870 - 00:03:02.866, Speaker A: This is like an anthology. It goes through the entire timeline of Uniswap. That's sort of the first half of the episode. In the second half of the episode, we get more into Uniswap V three and the details. And boy, are there a lot of details around Uniswap V three. It's very clear that Hayden and team have thought about this exhaustively. We talk about the sushi vampire attacks.
00:03:02.866 - 00:03:42.018, Speaker A: We talk about the Uniswap stimulus package, the Uniswap airdrop as it was 4.5 billion in value to 500 different Ethereum accounts. Like crazy stuff. We talk about his reasoning for licensing. And core to this entire conversation was one through line David, which was what are the values of a decentralized financial system? What are bankless values? And what does that mean? What does it mean to instantiate that in code on Ethereum? What does it mean to instantiate that in the Uniswap protocol? So, really great episode. Definitely worth the wait. And we're super excited to bring this to you guys.
00:03:42.104 - 00:04:27.918, Speaker B: To me, the coolest story about Uniswap is this dance between the relationship of the values of Ethereum and also providing financial tools to the Ethereum community and the greater world at large, while also inspiring bottom up community ownership. There's so much value to be derived here. So let's go ahead and get right into the interview with Hayden, but first we'll talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on Ethereum.
00:04:27.918 - 00:04:54.554, Speaker B: Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while, and we'll say it again. Dows have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap dow apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion.
00:04:54.554 - 00:05:16.034, Speaker B: This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the uniswap? Dow. No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a uni grant@unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go. That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you.
00:05:16.072 - 00:05:36.050, Speaker A: Uniswap for sponsoring bankless metamask is your go to wallet for the bankless journey. If you're going bankless, you need metamask, period. Browser and mobile. Get them both. This is your tool to unlock the world of defi. Here's my favorite part. Now you can swap tokens directly in metamask with a single swipe.
00:05:36.050 - 00:05:58.346, Speaker A: This has got to be the easiest way to trade Ethereum tokens. Choose a token, you own a token to exchange it with. Get your quotes. If you like what you see, you hit swap. That's it. What makes swap so useful is what happens behind the scenes. It compares dexs, aggregators, and market makers to find you the best price with the lowest network fees and the least slippage.
00:05:58.346 - 00:06:30.266, Speaker A: This means you can swap a wider range of tokens, and swaps can even automatically split up your trade to give you access to better liquidity. You don't even have to think about it. Try it out. Download Metamask for desktop or mobile now at Metamask IO and start swapping. All right, bankless nation, we are super excited to have our next guest, Hayden Adams, the legend, the creator of Uniswap. Guys, this episode has been one year in the making. We've been asking Hayden on the podcast for twelve straight months now.
00:06:30.266 - 00:06:45.998, Speaker A: We aggressively pestering, aggressively pestering on Twitter. We had Mark Cuban first, and we were faced with a dilemma whether to have Mark Cuban or Hayden first. We had Mark Cuban first, but now we have the long awaited podcast with Hayden Adams. Hayden, how are you doing?
00:06:46.164 - 00:06:57.380, Speaker C: I'm great. Really happy to be here. Really happy to be on the podcast. And I'm definitely sorry that I've rugged you a few times on saying that I was going to come on and then not, and canceling and pushing it back.
00:06:59.190 - 00:07:17.478, Speaker A: It just makes this all that much better because we just wanted it so much. You're building the suspense, and I think the community is really excited to have you on. So, David, I think we're going to do this podcast as kind of like a timeline of events. So do you want to kick us off with the first milestone in the timeline and we'll run through it?
00:07:17.644 - 00:07:28.394, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Hayden I believe the genesis of Uniswap started with you getting laid off. Can you tell us about that part of the story and where things went after that?
00:07:28.512 - 00:07:53.060, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. I mean, to some extent, it started a little bit before that. I had a friend in college, his name is Carl, and he was super obsessed with Ethereum, incredibly passionate about it. He would tell me to buy it back when it was a few cents. I didn't really care that much about it at the time. I wasn't that interested, I don't think. I was studying mechanical engineering, and I sort of had a planned path for my life, I think.
00:07:53.060 - 00:08:19.980, Speaker C: And so after I graduated college, I spent a. Sorry, my chair is squeaky. Yeah. After I graduated from college, I spent a year working as a mechanical engineer, specifically doing computational fluid dynamics, which is basically just stuff with heat flow. And we were working with car designs, but I don't think I liked it at all. I might have hated it. It just wasn't very interesting.
00:08:19.980 - 00:09:10.410, Speaker C: Mechanical engineering is one of those fields where it sounds like it's very futuristic and it's actually mostly stuff from Newton and hundreds of years ago. And so I don't think I was very passionate about it. And fortunately I got laid off because I don't think that I would have left. And at the time, this was in the summer of 2017, and so Ethereum was finally starting to take off around then and had basically ballooned from maybe one to $2 to like 15 to 30. And so there was starting to get some excitement in the Ethereum ecosystem. And I got on a call with my friend Carl, who had been working at consensus, and then he had recently moved from consensus to working with the Ethereum foundation. He was writing the proof of stake smart contract for the original proof of stake Casper.
00:09:10.410 - 00:09:41.720, Speaker C: And we basically got a call and he know, congratulations, this is the best thing that's ever happened to you. You're going to become an Ethereum developer. Well, I don't really have a software development background. I had done maybe one or two coding classes as part of mechanical engineering, but very, very little. And so I felt know there's no way I could make this transition. I'm too far behind, too late in my career. And what Carl really impressed on me was know no one knew how to code smart contracts yet.
00:09:41.720 - 00:10:47.478, Speaker C: And it was so early in the Ethereum lifecycle that you could become, well, what he said to me specifically is in one year's time, you're going to be a world expert on Ethereum. And I was like, probably not. But there was something really exciting about Ethereum. The more we talked about it, there was sort of this, the idea of programs that can hold money, the idea of finance where no one controls it, the idea of you can send money and no one can stop you and no one can kind of take your money. There was something really interesting about it to me, and so I decided to make the leap. So I spent a few months basically just learning solidity, writing some initial smart contracts, writing a token contract, all that sort of thing. And then Carl pointed me know, I had another kind of call with Carl where I was basically, I I'm starting to get it, but I don't feel like I'm making enough progress.
00:10:47.478 - 00:11:12.340, Speaker C: I don't really know what to do with it at this point. And so I decided I wanted a project to learn on something that I could take a little bit further. And Carl pointed me to this blog post from Vitalik on automated market making. And that essentially outlined the initial idea of Uniswap, which is you can make a smart contract that has this x times Y equals K formula, and it will allow you to trade between two assets. So that's where it started, really.
00:11:13.670 - 00:11:52.798, Speaker B: The interesting thing about this story to me, is that the moral of this story we're about to go through the creation of Uniswap v. One, the creation of Uniswap v. Two, the Token Uniswap v. Three, optimism. But to me, the moral of this story happened at the very beginning, where you had this budy Carl, who, for those that don't know Carl, his energy and optimism is absolutely infectious. And you were coming from the legacy world, and you had skepticism as to your ability to build, and perhaps didn't have that optimism that Carl had about you being able to create something on Ethereum. What can I really contribute? I don't know how to code.
00:11:52.798 - 00:12:16.150, Speaker B: And Carl's like, no, you're going to be an expert in one year's time. And perhaps your reaction was, how is that even possible? Yet here we are today with Uniswap being perhaps the most successful ethereum application. It's an elegant beginning to this story. How do you see that beginning of the story and how it kind of played out?
00:12:16.300 - 00:13:06.342, Speaker C: Yeah, I definitely think that it speaks volumes to what Ethereum is and what the Ethereum ecosystem is. I definitely didn't do it alone, and there was definitely so much along the way. But all of it kind of points to the power of Ethereum and the power of decentralized finance, which is really, for one, it was because it was a small community at the time. It's still kind of a small community in some ways. Everyone was very welcoming, and so everyone you spoke to was very passionate about it and was very welcoming and inviting and basically just wanted to bring more people in. Right? So Carl wanted to bring more people in, and so he kind of sucked me in, into building on Ethereum. But then there's kind of this other aspect of it, which is sort of more almost a technical aspect of it, which is that you can build applications where you don't need to trust anyone.
00:13:06.342 - 00:14:07.580, Speaker C: And that's just like a very important part of the story, which is that what I did wouldn't really be possible in traditional finance because I didn't have a reputation that would allow people to trust me with their money. And what was nice about Uniswap, right, is it was an application, and anyone could read the code for themselves, it was fairly simple. Or rely on other people who had read the code that this was safe to use and people were willing to put their money in it, and they didn't have to trust me, they were trusting the code that I had written. And that is sort of what allowed it to grow so much and so fast. And I think it's just such an amazing property of Ethereum. And then I think that beyond that, just the kind of permissionless nature where anyone can build on top of it, where anyone can participate in it, definitely was another aspect which is sort of fundamental to what Ethereum is, which made it possible in the first place.
00:14:08.590 - 00:14:26.558, Speaker B: So you have been given this project pointed to out by your friend Carl. So, hey, there's this blog post from Vitalik about Amms, this x times Y equals k curve. And then you just start tinkering in solidity and start building this thing out. Where does the story go from here?
00:14:26.644 - 00:15:15.330, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that as I started tinkering with it, at first it was really just, I want to learn how to write smart contracts and I want to learn how to create web interfaces. And so the very first version was just me writing some simple code, learning kind of the basics of web development. It was very much the way I viewed it, was a learning experience for myself, definitely. As it started to form, once I had an initial proof of concept, which was this, I don't know if you've seen that version of the site. There's a sort of early proof of concept version of it, the retro version. Once I sort of got to that point, what I did is I started to compare it to other projects in the space at the time and the differences between them. And something that basically the primary decentralized exchange at the time was Ether delta.
00:15:15.330 - 00:15:41.446, Speaker C: And Ether delta felt very different from Uniswap. Uniswap had this aspect. It was sort of like a very confusing user experience. It was very complex to use. Actually, before this mechanical engineering background, I didn't have any finance background whatsoever. So to me, it almost felt a lot more intuitive for my own use. So I started to kind of get a feel of this Ux implications.
00:15:41.446 - 00:16:36.700, Speaker C: And then the other thing that I started to get a feel of was, and this is maybe more important, is the underlying properties of decentralization and censorship, resistance and permissionless. Basically, all existing decentralized exchange platforms that were kind of either in the works or existed at that time didn't really have the same underlying properties of Ethereum that I cared about. The properties of Ethereum that excited me were the fact that you didn't have to trust anyone, the fact that it could never go down, the fact that it was permissionless. But when you looked at things at the time like Ether delta, it didn't actually have those same properties. And so I started to view it not necessarily as, okay, this is a way for me to learn, but it was also, what does it look like to build an application on top of Ethereum that has the same properties as Ethereum itself that everyone cares about?
00:16:39.390 - 00:16:54.900, Speaker B: At what point in your story did you realize that this Uniswap thing could be as big as it is today? When did this go from a pet project for you, just learning to code to perhaps this is something that can change what Ethereum is.
00:16:55.750 - 00:18:02.680, Speaker C: I think that we need to accelerate almost two years in this story, because everything I'm talking about was basically late 2017. And I'd say that throughout 2018, basically my story was traveling around every Ethereum event I could, meeting as many people in the space as I could, starting to build out uniswap into a more complete version. I got this Ethereum foundation grant was definitely a pivotal moment for it, where I now had some financial support for it. That was definitely important at the time. And I also had almost a responsibility to build it where people gave me money to build it. Now I was like, okay, I actually have to take this a little bit further. And so I basically resolved on getting a version to Mainet, getting a version that felt production ready, and I set out to kind of accomplish all the tasks that were needed, whether it know, obtaining an audit, hiring contractors to build an interface, writing the white paper, but still all along that time, I didn't really know how it would be.
00:18:03.930 - 00:18:10.040, Speaker A: Bit just on that. Hayden, for a minute, can you tell us about that funding? So how much was it and where did it come from?
00:18:10.810 - 00:18:47.698, Speaker C: I saw very little of it personally, but there was definitely kind of a few ways that it got financed. So the Ethereum foundation grant, it was sort of written out as $100,000. Technically, it was $50,000 plus 100 and something ETH. Basically, it was the cost of an audit, and the audit ended up, was denominated in ETH. And so I just asked for the ETH amount. By the time I received the payout, the ETH had gone down something like 75, 80, ended up much closer to like $55 to $60,000. But it did.
00:18:47.698 - 00:19:30.020, Speaker C: And I think that there was a few people who kind of helped me out with small personal grants along the way, such as that guy Pascal, who was mentioned in the blog post and got a grant from balance at one point. And I think that none of that money, I didn't see a single penny from the grants personally. I had bought a little bit of ETH in early 2017, and I basically just was selling all my ETH and living off of it. And so I kind of basically sold all of my ETH to live while building Uniswap, which was, it ended up being the right gamble. But yeah.
00:19:30.710 - 00:19:40.006, Speaker B: Were you aware of the gamble you were making at the time? Did you think that, oh, this could perhaps come back and really helped fund my life, or what did you think you were doing?
00:19:40.028 - 00:20:32.520, Speaker C: I think it was more like I needed to pay rent and eat food, and I wanted to keep building uniswap. I'll say that. The other, there's financial support, but there's kind of maybe the more important thing, which was community support and support from kind of other contributors. I definitely had an example would be Khalil, who's the designer at Uniswap and kind of has become much more known in the crypto industry for his design work. He was helping out on the project actually as early as, I believe, December 2017. So I basically paid him a little bit, but not very much as a contractor for early design work and early front end work. I also paid some other developers, but in part they were contributing with their time, as, you know, people like Carl and people like Vitalik, who gave me feedback and introductions in the space.
00:20:32.520 - 00:21:16.338, Speaker C: Definitely the sort of ethereum community who supported me and inspired me to keep on building. It was super instrumental to it and maybe even more valuable than any of the financial support that I got was going to my first Ethereum conference with Edcon in Toronto. And I met so many people. I actually, I met a few of them the day before, but Dan Robinson, I met Andy Millennia, who was the CTO at Makerdao. I met Phil Dyne. I met all these people who kind of helped bring me into the space and were very generous with their time and their advice. And all of that was so incredibly important.
00:21:16.504 - 00:21:42.522, Speaker A: So I want to get kind of a reset on this timeline of events we've moved through so far. So summer of 2017 was when you got laid off. Right. And Carl is sort of making the pitch all this time where you're getting plugged into the community and you're writing sort of the first prototypes of Uniswap that happened somewhere in the 2018 or so time range. Yeah. And then the Uniswap launch. Right.
00:21:42.522 - 00:22:07.586, Speaker A: So November 2, 2018, was when Uniswap V one launched. And I want folks to understand sort of the backdrop of this. The backdrop, Hayden, you were kind of alluding to is we had these things called decentralized exchanges. But to your point, Hayden, they weren't totally decentralized. They certainly weren't permissionless. An operator had to sort of add the assets. They weren't fully on chain.
00:22:07.586 - 00:22:16.470, Speaker A: So the order books off chain. And here you are in 2018, the market's kind of dead, right? Like, the ethereum project has failed.
00:22:19.050 - 00:22:20.630, Speaker B: DFI was not a thing.
00:22:20.700 - 00:22:27.930, Speaker A: Maker was just like, sort of a little bit there, but not fully there. I don't even think they had their single collateral die out. Maybe they did.
00:22:28.000 - 00:22:29.322, Speaker B: It was one month old.
00:22:29.456 - 00:22:55.410, Speaker A: Okay, so all very brand new. And what you're doing in that backdrop is you're bringing something called an automated market maker to the fold, which is a totally new take on decentralized exchanges or on exchanges, period. It's not an order book type of exchange. And you're deploying this thing. Can you talk about sort of the context of when you deployed it on November 2 and sort of what you expected?
00:22:55.830 - 00:23:32.526, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that I didn't fully know what to expect. I think what I knew at the time one was that Vitalik was very smart and liked the idea, and that on its own, was like a huge, you know, if Vitalik thinks it's a good to, I'm gonna assume it's a good idea or at least worth trying out. And then I think that the other thing that I knew is I knew the benefits of it, and I knew that there were downsides. In fact, everyone I spoke to from the traditional financial world, to extent that I spoke to people from the traditional financial world, did not think it would work, even some of it. Shocked? Yeah.
00:23:32.628 - 00:23:33.998, Speaker A: What did they say to you?
00:23:34.164 - 00:24:10.810, Speaker C: Well, they basically said that, hilariously, some of the same things people are saying about Unisoft V three today, which is active market makers are going to beat up passive market makers. People who just deposit liquidity are going to slowly have their value drained over time. Basically that it was too slow to update prices. By that I mean it updates prices in real time, but if someone actively wants to change their price, then they're competing against arbitragers, and it maybe takes too long to do that. So yeah, there was all sorts of reasons that it was never going to work. It was too capital inefficient.
00:24:11.490 - 00:24:31.758, Speaker A: What about Hayden? Even in the Defi community, what were people saying? Because as I remember at the time, the idea was that decentralized exchanges were of the flavor of Zero X and of ether delta. And this idea of an automated market maker was even foreign within DeFi.
00:24:31.934 - 00:25:04.266, Speaker C: It was foreign within Defi, I will say that. And Defi didn't exist yet, as we said. But within Ethereum, I think that it did get a lot of support from certain people. I think that there was like a strong signal from Vitalik when he sort of supported it very early on that a lot of people picked up on. There was also plenty of people who said it wouldn't work every step of the way for sure. But I also got a huge amount of support from people who were excited by it. Examples would be even like Amin on day one.
00:25:04.266 - 00:25:39.526, Speaker C: So day one, it had about $30,000 of liquidity, which was put in by people we kind of knew. And so I was terrified it would be lost through a potential hack. I did everything I could to avoid that, but I was still kind of terrified that there would be real money at stake. And then the second day, someone introduced me to Omi, and he messaged me. He was like, I'm thinking about putting a million dollars in today. And I was like, I'm trying to sleep at night, and I would prefer you don't. But what I did know is that it had these sort of decentralization properties that other things did not.
00:25:39.526 - 00:25:47.706, Speaker C: And I basically wanted to figure out what is the value of those decentralization properties relative to maybe the potential weakness of the system.
00:25:47.808 - 00:25:48.122, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:48.176 - 00:26:36.220, Speaker C: Maybe it isn't as capital efficient as an order book, but it definitely is more decentralized in an order book. It's definitely easier to create a new market, it's definitely easier to create. Liquidity definitely lowers the barrier of entry, and I think that for me, that was enough just as a starting place. And then definitely I was overwhelmed with the response, the positive response that I received where despite it being like an insane bear market, where everything was going down, I think that the one thing that wasn't going down was Uniswap traction during, during 2018. And seeing it kind of just exponentially grow in usage and traction was when I started to think that maybe there was something more there.
00:26:37.150 - 00:27:48.306, Speaker B: This part in the story to me is a through line of the core deep Ethereum community members who really understood what was going on here, versus perhaps the legacy financial people that you talked about that only saw problems. I can definitely attest to the fact that I started paying attention to Uniswap because Amin kept on talking so highly of it. And I personally really respect Amin and he was the person that really did a good job through Twitter explaining the merits of this whole thing. And I do think that Amin ultimately did end up seeding the spank eth LP and then also becoming very handsomely rewarded for that behavior. Ultimately, when the uni token came down, the that there was that liquidity, but that was just for spank and ETH. And I think the biggest, most legitimizing event, I think in the early days of Uniswap was Makerdao, or the people behind the maker team decided to move their MKR liquidity away from Oasis decks into Uniswap. Were you a part of that story at all?
00:27:48.488 - 00:28:46.558, Speaker C: So what's so awesome about the story, from my perspective, is how little involvement I had in actually growing the liquidity or bringing it to the platform. It was really just like a natural occurrence where I think it resonated with people at the maker. I had friends at Maker, but I actually had no idea who the major MKR liquidity providers were in the early days of Uniswap. I didn't know any of the early big liquidity providers, really, and it just kind of happened early. Kind of members of Makerdao saw merit in it and put some of their MKR and some of their ETh in the pools. And it was a validating experience, especially early on when it started becoming the number one market for MKR. And maybe it was worlds behind things like coinbase or even ether delta, but it was the number one market for MKR or the number one market for Dai.
00:28:46.558 - 00:29:21.914, Speaker C: Well, not Dai yet, but yeah, that was definitely a very validating thing. And by the way, just to speak to your previous point on the community and the bear market, there was something really special. People who were around and building in the bear market were people who truly believed, and I think it was like a really exciting time because of that. Everyone who was there was there because they shared the values of Ethereum. They weren't there to make money because everyone who was there had lost a huge amount of money. And so, yeah, it was definitely like an awesome time. And people like Amin were really instrumental.
00:29:22.042 - 00:30:10.762, Speaker A: I totally agree. The tourists moved out, and the settlers were there, the builders remained. And before we get too much further in the story, Hayden, I want to ask this question because you keep going back to sort of almost core values of uniswap, trustlessness, permissionlessness, censorship resistant. And I'm curious to hear, I mean, these are values that I think are inherent in the Ethereum platform. It sounds like you understood these very well at a fundamental level. And you talked about the Uniswap experiment being worth trying just because they exemplified those values. I'm wondering if that's something from your personal life, like you just highly identify with these values or if this is more an engineering mindset of, well, all of these other exchanges, decentralized exchanges, are trying this spot on the trade off spectrum.
00:30:10.762 - 00:30:14.160, Speaker A: But what about this spot? I wonder if this has product market fit.
00:30:14.530 - 00:30:55.390, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that it's a little bit of both. I think that I'm personally very interested. I think I'm interested from an engineering perspective. I think it's really what drew me into Ethereum and helped me kind of, Carl sort of advised me to do it. But the thing that kind of helped me make the leap was that there was something so interesting and novel about. I think that I definitely recognized problems within the existing financial world, or maybe just power structures in general that existed where obviously there was a huge amount of wealth concentration. There was kind of a huge amount of gatekeeping.
00:30:55.390 - 00:31:51.710, Speaker C: Very few parties could participate in finance. And the idea of sort of a financial system that removed unnecessary middlemen, a financial system that helped more people participate and basically help redistribute more wealth to more people, was something that I definitely believed in and still believe in very much, and has been kind of always been a driver. And it was originally my driver to getting into Ethereum. But like you said, I don't view the Uniswap's values as different from Ethereum's values at all. I think that they're very similar. And every step of the way in working on Uniswap. I've kind of taken my lead from Ethereum itself, from Vitalik, from kind of the decentralized finance movement, the broader movement.
00:31:52.450 - 00:32:09.030, Speaker B: Yeah, it's definitely going to be a through line of this podcast and something I want to sit on for a while towards the end here, but let's keep going down this Uniswap story. So we've got Uniswap V one, built on Ethereum. We've got some early community members.
00:32:09.100 - 00:32:09.334, Speaker C: Now.
00:32:09.372 - 00:32:31.254, Speaker B: There's a uniswap community. Amin is in this community now, and some anonymous MKR liquidity providers are in the Uniswap community. Uniswap community is growing, but with Uniswap V one, what were the obvious things that needed to be addressed, that could be addressed? What were the shortcomings that you had your head on that you wanted to tackle?
00:32:31.382 - 00:33:09.580, Speaker C: Yeah. And by the way, just to add on that before, some other really amazing things that started to happen around that time was people building projects on top of Uniswap. Probably the earliest example would be, would be conlan, who built what eventually became Uniswap info. He built this sort of analytics site. It was just me. I didn't have the kind of capacity for building an analytics site for Uniswap, and someone else came and built that. And as people started to spin up sites dedicated to kind of building on top of Uniswap, that was like such a huge push forward and such an exciting moment.
00:33:09.580 - 00:34:00.806, Speaker C: But, yeah, definitely I saw that as Uniswap was growing, and I definitely saw that there was sort of demand for Uniswap, that there was something there that was worth pursuing further. And I decided I was going to pursue it further. And so that's kind of where the seed round happened. I guess what I was 100% sure of is that there's no way that I built a perfect system by myself with no finance or developer background. And so I knew that there were better versions of Uniswap that could be created, and I knew that I couldn't create them. I knew I didn't want to and shouldn't create them alone, and that more people could join in this. And so that's really what led me to.
00:34:00.806 - 00:34:15.280, Speaker C: I didn't know what the long term kind of structure of Uniswap would look like. I didn't really know what the long term kind of community would look like, but I knew that it should be taken further. And at that time, sort of the thing that made the most logical sense was basically to raise money.
00:34:15.650 - 00:34:27.250, Speaker A: So this brings us to, like, April or so 2019. And you're talking about a seed round, which was led by paradigm, small amounts at the time, like a million dollars in the seed round, something to that effect.
00:34:27.400 - 00:34:28.370, Speaker C: 1.8 million.
00:34:28.440 - 00:34:39.382, Speaker A: Okay, so 1.8 or so. And before that, you didn't really have a team at all working on this. Hayden, was it mainly you solo, and this sort of allowed you to build out the team? Think about a team.
00:34:39.516 - 00:35:23.140, Speaker C: Yeah. From fall 2017 until spring 2019, I was the only person who was working on it full time. Wow. Definitely. You've probably read that sort of history of Uniswap blog post, which shows that there were sort of an army of people along the way who contributed and helped and encouraged and pushed it forward with me. But definitely until spring 2019, I was the only person who woke up every day saying, what do we do next for Uniswap, and how do I kind of improve on it and what can we do with it? Definitely the highest priority with the seed round was to have a few more people working full time on the project.
00:35:23.830 - 00:35:50.666, Speaker A: So this was, we're still in the bear market blues. We're still in the era of Defi, just maybe being realized, but only the settlers have realized it. All of the tourists are gone from the industry, but these investments are being made. And you felt, it seemed like at that time that, okay, there's something here. Amms maybe are a thing. This uniswap thing has product market fit still had fairly small. It was fairly small in terms of liquidity at that time.
00:35:50.666 - 00:35:52.954, Speaker A: How much liquidity were we talking in 2019?
00:35:53.082 - 00:35:59.566, Speaker C: I can check right now. Spring 2019. Okay. It had, like, about $8 million in it at the time.
00:35:59.588 - 00:36:00.110, Speaker A: Okay.
00:36:00.260 - 00:36:01.680, Speaker C: And the volume was.
00:36:02.290 - 00:36:11.250, Speaker A: David's laughing, but that was impressive back then. It was like a whole new smart contract thing and had accrued 8 million in liquidity.
00:36:11.830 - 00:36:15.010, Speaker C: It was doing about a million dollars a day in trading.
00:36:16.870 - 00:36:25.090, Speaker A: Around that time. Were you thinking about the seeds for what a v two would look like? Yeah, basically clause with v one that you hope to solve.
00:36:25.170 - 00:37:14.280, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the first thing that I knew needed to happen was that people needed to not lose money when they traded on Uniswap due to bad UX issues. And so there were know. I think that by far the first priority. The first two hires were basically Noah, who's our engineering lead, and Khalil, who's our design lead. And basically we set about making sure that when people went to the Unisoft interface, it became something that didn't feel like a hackathon project. The original Uniswap interface was created in three weeks by a single contractor that I hired, just for context. And so the very first priority was get the Uniswap interface to a point where people really can trust it with their money.
00:37:14.280 - 00:38:01.206, Speaker C: But then beyond that, there was sort of this broader question of, okay, there was definitely unisoft. V two was top of mind, and what would a next version of the protocol look like? Are there some obvious wins and obvious improvements to make? And I think that the most obvious improvements were one, just overall architectural improvements, like code based quality improvements. There were a few minor kind of bugs in the v one code. I mean, it still works and runs today pretty well, but for example, it never worked with tether because of this sort of token bug, and it couldn't handle tokens that had certain implementation details. So there was definitely this general code quality, architectural improvement. And then the sort of two other things that we were focusing on. There was one just arbitrary ERC 20.
00:38:01.206 - 00:38:16.810, Speaker C: ERC 20 pairs, which hilariously never ended up being that important. They're important, they're a decent chunk of uniswap, but probably still only something like 10% of uniswap today is non eth pairs.
00:38:18.190 - 00:38:20.460, Speaker A: Do you have any comments on why do you think that is?
00:38:21.310 - 00:38:56.614, Speaker C: Yes, I think in part when we were working on v two, it was definitely before, like, curve existed. And we definitely knew that there were going to be eventually ways to make stablecoins more efficient. But we did expect, because curve hadn't been out yet, we did expect this to at least be a big improvement for stablecoin. Stablecoin Paris to some extent. And we did expect that to be better for stablecoins. So that was kind of part of it. And that ended up not happening, in part because more efficient stablecoin focused amms came out around the same time as v two.
00:38:56.614 - 00:40:01.354, Speaker C: Or I think somewhere between when it was announced and when it was launched was when curve came out. And then I think that the other point is that people really love eth pairs, people in Ethereum, like denominating an ETH. A lot of ERC 20 tokens and Dfi tokens tend to track kind of a similar market movements with ETH and bitcoin, I guess the whole market kind of moves together. So I think people really like ETH pairs generally. And so those are still by far the most popular, although we'll see if that stays the same in uniswap v three. I think that the kind of final big change with uniswap v two was definitely the introduction of oracles, which I think, again, I think that they've been wildly successful in some rights. But again, I don't know if in some ways we did a clubhouse talk the other day with Dan Robinson, and his hot take was that uniswap v two kind of failed at everything that it attempted to do while still, like wildly succeeding, which is basically Oracle's never actually took off that much.
00:40:01.354 - 00:40:36.040, Speaker C: I mean, they are now one of kind of second to chain link or kind of probably the most used oracle system on Ethereum. And so they definitely have sort of led to this algo stablecoin boom. And there's definitely a few projects like reflexor and compound that are now using it. And so I think that Uniswap v two oracles are really great. But at the same time also, we never showed them the love that they necessarily needed to kind of gain this broader adoption. And maybe that's a kind of important point I can make about what we viewed uniswap at v two. At the time we were creating it, and then what it ended up being to us as a team.
00:40:36.040 - 00:41:32.218, Speaker C: I think that when we were working on Uniswap v two originally, we basically viewed it as almost like the multilateral die to makers single, the kind of equivalent of multilateral die to single collateral die of uniswap v one. And I think that what we realized very close to the launch of v two is that actually it was just single collateral die v two, and that we were going to need to work on this v three version. And that that was ultimately like the version that we had to build an ecosystem on top of. Basically, by the time we had launched Uniswap v two, we were actually already starting to work on v three. And there was probably one or two very brief conversations where we were like, is it worth launching v two? This v three design is so much better, but what we realized is how much longer it would take to get there. We knew it was going to be just like a massive development hall. And so we basically decided, launch V two.
00:41:32.218 - 00:42:34.240, Speaker C: It's just a much more scalable infrastructure, just better infrastructure, much more scalable to build kind of, for Uniswap over this next year. But what we didn't do is then spend what we had originally planned to do when we were building V two is then start building up, participating in building out the ecosystem around it as a team, kind of along with the community. And instead, what happened is we immediately spent all of our time working on Uniswap v three sort of full time, and the community sort of built up the ecosystem around Uniswap V two on its own. That's kind of something that maybe people don't quite realize about how V two evolved. I will say that despite all that, I've kind of skipped pretty far through the timeline. Despite all that, Uniswap V two was an enormous success in terms of growth and traction, where it grew from doing a million dollars a day in trading to a billion dollars a day in trading. I think that there was sort of some really pivotal moments, I think.
00:42:34.240 - 00:43:02.120, Speaker C: Was it September of this year where Uniswap did more trading volume than Coinbase? Not on a day, not for an hour, not for a week, but for a full month, the trading volume was higher. And so definitely there was this explosion of usage of v two. But at the same time, from how we were viewing the role of the protocol in the long term, I think that we just were already fully on the v three train.
00:43:02.650 - 00:43:22.480, Speaker A: I want to make sure folks capture the significance of that. So you launched Uniswap in November of 2018. Right? And then two years later, a couple of months earlier, because you said September 2020, it's doing more volume than Coinbase is doing. That's what you just said.
00:43:23.010 - 00:43:25.742, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess we skipped a whole bunch to get to there.
00:43:25.796 - 00:43:47.326, Speaker A: But you're stepping back for a minute. Does that surprise you? Is this like, why did this happen? How did this happen? And why did this happen from a 20,000 foot view? Because that surprises me. And I'm honestly surprised, Hayden, that this story isn't widely known or isn't widely told outside of DFI and crypto circles.
00:43:47.518 - 00:44:26.080, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. If you asked me in 2017, it would be shocking. If you asked me in 2018, it would be shocking. If you asked me in 2019, it would be shocking. If you asked me in midway through 2020, it would be shocking. So I would say that up until it happened, up until sort of maybe a few months before it happened, if you asked me when or if Uniswap was going to pass coinbase on a monthly trading volume over time, definitely as I got more usage and traction, we started to see some of the real value of automated market making. And I'm going to get into.
00:44:26.080 - 00:45:23.090, Speaker C: So I started to have some long term amm maximalism thoughts where like, hey, this can actually be a real thing. This might be how all trading is done in the future, but that future didn't feel a few months off. It felt a few years off. Still, I think, or like two years off, maybe. It didn't feel like something that was ever going to happen in 2020, even as late as early 2020, it seemed like two years off. But I think what happened basically, is that Uniswap opened up a world of permissionless innovation that just moved. So, and because of how permissionless the innovation is in Defi and on top of Uniswap, it was able to move just so much faster than anyone could have anticipated.
00:45:23.090 - 00:46:14.094, Speaker C: The ability for anyone to kind of create a liquidity pool without needing professional market makers, the ability to not just not need professional market makers. You don't even need to have a technical background. We had an interface for it. You simply deposit some tokens and you simply just like, typing numbers in a field, and you hit create and in a created liquidity that existed forever for that asset. And the projects that needed exchange as a subcomponent of what they were doing no longer needed to build an exchange. Makerdao very early on built their own exchange. They built oasis, and ultimately they didn't need that because Uniswap became this sort of primary market for those assets.
00:46:14.094 - 00:47:13.938, Speaker C: And so I think that just how easy it was to create liquidity and not just self. It's almost like user generated content versus sort of editorial content. Think about the difference of how fast New York Times articles can come out versus how fast YouTube videos can come out. It's like that, but with finance and money, the fact that anyone can create something and anyone can use it just lets it grow so much faster than sort of permission to financial models. And so I think that we saw this kind of explosion in d five summer. I think that the big thing that came out of that was like yield farming. And what you notice about yield farming and sort of DeFi summer is that the projects that are best positioned to benefit from that are projects that work for this long tail of assets and use cases.
00:47:13.938 - 00:48:15.882, Speaker C: And I think that Uniswap was just very well positioned to benefit from that because it works so well for the long tail, because even projects like Makerdao and compound, which are decentralized and they're defi, but they kind of rely on pooled risk. And because of that, they sort of tend to only work for a subset of assets versus Uniswap, where risk is basically split out on a per token basis or a per pair basis. And so anyone can kind of come in and join, and there's like no real pooled risk. Basically, any liquidity provider can take on whatever risk they want on an individual basis. And so people who are providing liquidity on some new obscure asset aren't exposed to some other obscure asset. And so I think that's sort of part of what happened is just this explosion of activity and use cases that was just so exciting. And I think it brought a huge amount of people into the space.
00:48:15.882 - 00:48:20.640, Speaker C: And Uniswap was just like right there as the infrastructure that was needed to support it.
00:48:21.170 - 00:49:32.702, Speaker B: And during 2018 and 2019, there was a very select, small, contracted group of people that really understood these things. Makerdao came online in January of 2018, and Uniswap really came into its shoes, really in early 2019 when all of this early liquidity came. And that's when kind of collectively as a community, we all started to realize these things. Hayden, I think this is right is then when you didn't really know that what you just said about the long tail of assets and enabling tools for anyone, that perhaps wasn't exactly something that you realized in the earliest days of Uniswap and only came about when people actually started to use it. And as a community, we all kind of realized this collectively together as people started to use these things. I remember using Uniswap to provide liquidity for this pov token that I just minted for funsies and just handed it out to my friends. And some people just wanted to buy it, and so they just went to Uniswap and they could buy this token that I had just minted.
00:49:32.702 - 00:50:24.180, Speaker B: That's absolutely crazy. And another story that stuck with me was with my time at realty, where we had tokenized real estate. We wanted to make real estate liquid. And all of a sudden, we had this market that we could just put our asset into our relatively esoteric niche, asset that had no alternative secondary market. We were able to tap into the power of Uniswap without permission and the instantiation of Uniswap, the existence of Uniswap, along with the other two kind of like King DFI protocols in 2018 and 2019, maker Dow and compound, that's kind of where some of this early DFI narrative really came out of. We wouldn't have been able to talk about Ethereum in the way that we talk about Ethereum without Uniswap. How do you perceive Uniswap's contributions to the conversation of Ethereum at large?
00:50:24.870 - 00:51:39.306, Speaker C: Yeah, I definitely think that kind of, as I had sort of mentioned earlier, early on, I saw Uniswap as this example project of a way to build an application on Ethereum that kind of mimicked its underlying properties. And I think that we just kind of ran with that. And so I think that I've always sort of seen Uniswap as an example of at least trying to be an example of doing it the right way, if that makes sense, doing defi the right way, which is like doing it kind of responsibly, doing it in a way where it kind of holds on to the values that matter. And so, yeah, it's always been something that's been incredibly important to us since very early on. And I definitely agree with what you said there, which is like early people like yourself, even, who started to get more accustomed to it and understand it more and who also shared those values, really just contributed so much to its growth and its traction. And as more people started to understand it and kind of spread the word of it, it was sort of like mutually beneficial to the space. Uniswap benefited from it, but then maybe Ethereum benefited from it as well.
00:51:39.408 - 00:52:30.870, Speaker B: Hey guys, I hope you're enjoying the interview so far with Hayden. We are about to get into the defi summer part of Uniswap's timeline, and we ask about sushi swap and what it was like to be on the Uniswap team during the whole sushi swap saga. And then we, of course, get into after that Uniswap v three and spend a ton of time talking about what is the innovation behind Uniswap v three. We talk about concentrated liquidity, we talk about the oracles. We talk about how Uniswap V three is flexible enough to allow the market to shape the curve of the amm and what that means. And then we finish off this interview with a conversation with Ethereum values and how Uniswap is an extension of those values and what Hayden hopes the long term legacy for both Uniswap and Ethereum are around to the world around us. Such a fantastic interview.
00:52:30.870 - 00:53:11.494, Speaker B: But first, before we go any further, we have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Synthetix is Ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol. What does that mean? Synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets, which are assets that are priced via an oracle rather than bids or asks. Traders can use the quinta exchange, which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics. Traders on quinta can trade synthetic tokens like SBtc s oil or SDFI. Because Quinta is powered by synthetics, traders experience zero slippage on their trades. No, I didn't mean low slippage.
00:53:11.494 - 00:53:42.910, Speaker B: I meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform. No slippage on your trades. You can also easily short assets with isynths, which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset. Synthetics isn't just for traders. Developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets. Or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects. If you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform not found in the legacy world, check out Quinta IO.
00:53:42.910 - 00:54:27.726, Speaker B: If you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral, go to www. Synthetics IO, where you can stake your SNX or ETH and earn fees from synthetics is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens, and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets.
00:54:27.726 - 00:55:10.606, Speaker B: If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini Crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset.

00:55:10.708 - 00:55:47.130, Speaker A: Gobankless so, Hayden, in our timeline story, we're summer 2020, and we have DFI summer where crypto and DFI discovers yield farming. We discover this thing called a governance token. August 2020, you guys raised more funding, so 11 million in series A round. So beyond your seed round. You're now series a round with some of the same investors and some new ones. And then this event kind of happens on the end of DFI summer. So heading into DFI fall, maybe, which is the sushi swap vampire attack.
00:55:47.130 - 00:56:05.518, Speaker A: So this is where a competitive automated market maker takes Uniswap v two code forks. It calls it sushi swap, juices it with yield, and starts to acquire some liquidity. Tell us. Pick up the story from there.
00:56:05.684 - 00:57:09.480, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that maybe, just to preface that, there were actually other projects at the time sushi came out, there were actually other projects that had been working on forking uniswap in the background. And I think that they almost didn't end up launching because of sushi and because of the traction it got. So just kind of like, a funny note is that we definitely were very aware that there was going to be forks with Uniswap. And I think that we kind of use forks generally as fair play because open source software, open source license. However, I think specifically with sushi, and not even sushi, but specifically chef Nomi, the guy on Twitter who was promoting it, I think that I was suspicious of him. And very early on, I had some tweets where I basically questioned his intentions. I guess the way that Nomi was tweeting about uniswap seemed opportunistic to me.
00:57:09.480 - 00:57:56.274, Speaker C: It was very much, like, hostile and aggressive. Oh, Uniswap is controlled by the evil vcs. And it was very much like it was kind of, Uniswap should be owned by the community, which I agreed with. But what was kind of interesting is that the community that Nomi was talking about was not actually the Uniswap community. It was the people who were yield farming sushi tokens, which is a little bit different. I think that something that was really exciting about the sushi swap saga was it showed how much demand there was for increased community engagement with uniswap or with Amm protocols generally. And so I think that it was definitely really exciting as well.
00:57:56.274 - 00:59:00.214, Speaker C: There was a lot of interesting things happening at the time, and there was obviously a huge amount of traction. Ultimately, it was like a huge net liquidity increase to Uniswap before and after kind of the migration occurred. But I think that something that I was always very cognizant of at the time, and what sort of colored how I viewed it, was basically when Nomi was tweeting about, oh, this is the more community oriented version. What was kind of first in mind was that who is the Uniswap community, because to me, it didn't feel like Sam Bankman fried and Kyle Simani were the Uniswap community. It felt like the Uniswap community was the people who had contributed and used it over the years. Right? The liquidity providers, amin, like all these people, that was the Uniswap community. And so a more community oriented version of Uniswap would be one that kind of brought those people into the process.
00:59:00.214 - 00:59:19.310, Speaker C: And so I think that for a long time, definitely we had thought about a token and had been considering it, but definitely there was sort of an acceleration of that from our perspective, seeing how much demand there was for the community version of Uniswap. And so that is definitely kind of one of the things that led into the launch of Uniswap governance.
00:59:21.570 - 00:59:28.338, Speaker B: Would you mean to say that you guys weren't actually thinking about a token as much as you were after the sushi swap event?
00:59:28.504 - 01:00:19.822, Speaker C: I think that there was definitely something that definitely tokens in general, right. The idea of a token had been around forever when Uniswap first came out. V one, there was a thought of a token, right, because it's a project on Ethereum, and tokens exist on Ethereum. So I've always sort of thought about it, and I think that it was things that I had considered. Even if you see some of the kind of how we kind of talked about it in the v two announcement, we started to talk about community. It's things that I had considered, but I think that the sushi swap saga definitely revealed how much the community wanted it. And I think that that was like, it definitely made us much more interested in pursuing it as a viable thing much sooner.
01:00:19.822 - 01:00:40.520, Speaker C: And so definitely, to some extent, yeah, there was no final decision on whether or not there would be a token until after sushi had started. And so we definitely moved quite fast on the creation of the governance contracts. And, yeah, it was a busy few weeks, for sure.
01:00:40.970 - 01:01:02.110, Speaker B: We definitely want to get into the conversation of the token, obviously, because that was such a monumental event in defi history. But I want to hang on sushi swap just a little bit longer. If we were a fly on the Uniswap offices, if there were offices, because by now we're into Covid times, what would we have heard from the conversations about the Uniswap team, about the sushi swap events?
01:01:02.790 - 01:01:38.090, Speaker C: I think it's kind of what I said early on. It's kind of what I just said in the past few cents. It's basically general suspicion around Nomi specifically. Definitely some excitement around the community's engagement and interest in participating and the sort of kind of traction that was happening around it. So, yeah, I think that that was kind of the two main. The main things that we were kind of thinking about in. And for what it's worth, the suspicion around Nomi was definitely not unjustified.
01:01:38.090 - 01:01:51.680, Speaker C: He did do the rugby thing, and then, of course, there's sort of what happened then and then where it is now, which is obviously a little bit different, for sure.
01:01:52.370 - 01:01:53.630, Speaker B: How do you see that?
01:01:53.780 - 01:02:14.360, Speaker A: Sorry, David, I just wanted to chime in for those who are not aware of the chef Nomi history. This is a pseudo anonymous character who started sushi swap, forked the original code, and then rug pulled. That's crypto language for stole some of the funds, eventually gave some of it back, how that story concluded, and the community moved on.
01:02:14.730 - 01:02:33.582, Speaker B: And, Hayden, how would you describe the relationship between Uniswap and sushiswap today? These things, in my opinion, fill different niches. How do you define the different roles provided by these different projects? And what do you think that's going to be like growing along Sushiswap, moving into the future?
01:02:33.716 - 01:03:36.866, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, hilariously, I think if you spend all day on crypto Twitter, you might be shocked to know that we think about other competitors probably just as much, if not more, than sushi, and we probably don't think about them nearly as much as a lot of people would think. I definitely think know what we tend to focus most on. I think that the people we view as maybe the strongest competitors are more things like finance and things like Coinbase, to be honest. And I think in terms of sushi specifically, we are very curious what they're going to do next. From our perspective, Uniswap v three is just, like, such a massive improvement that something that looks like Uniswap V two can't really compete with it in the long run, from my perspective. And so I'm very curious how they respond to that or if they, you know, from. From what I've seen so far, there's been a few things that they've been doing.
01:03:36.866 - 01:04:02.586, Speaker C: One, that they've been kind of branching out away from exchange and amm with their sort of forays into lending. And then the other thing that they seem to be doing is kind of branching out into ethereum killers and basically bringing Uniswap V two to BSc and Salana and Phantom and these sort of other kind of EVM chains. So that seems to be what they're focused on right now, but I guess.
01:04:02.608 - 01:04:35.226, Speaker A: We'Ll see different focus from Uniswap. I take, by the way, you said that we'll get into that when we talk more about V three. But just one of the last milestones on our timeline here is September 16, 2020. That was the date of the Uniswap airdrop. And I think everyone who had been active in DFI remembers this date. Because if you're using DFI, one of the first things you do on DFI, like, as soon as you take custody of your keys, you get off a centralized exchange. You're doing something with Uniswap.
01:04:35.226 - 01:04:49.834, Speaker A: That's the first app everyone uses. And the beautiful thing was, if you did anything with Uniswap, if your private key from Metamask made any exchange on Uniswap, you got a token, like Oprah Winfrey style, right?
01:04:49.872 - 01:05:01.850, Speaker C: You get a token including if the only thing you did on Uniswap was make a transaction that love our. There was something like a thousand accounts that had only made failed transactions.
01:05:01.930 - 01:05:29.474, Speaker A: So tell us about the stats here. So you're even supporting the failed transactors in Uniswap. But this was a very wide distribution to what is essentially the fledgling defi community. All of the settlers that we talked about, very few of the tourists were using Uniswap, but all of the settlers were kind of using Uniswap. How big was this airdrop? And can you talk about the design and your thought process going into that?
01:05:29.592 - 01:05:55.102, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, in terms of how big it was, I believe it was 150,000,000 tokens, which are currently valued at about 30. So about what's current value is somewhere in the realm of $4.5 billion is how big the Uni retroactive distribution was in terms of. At the time that it occurred, it was more in the realm of $450,000,000. I think that they were valued at.
01:05:55.156 - 01:05:57.610, Speaker A: About $3 and across. How many accounts was this, Hayden?
01:05:57.690 - 01:06:53.578, Speaker C: And I think it was over 500,000 accounts. So something that we were so excited about going into the launch of Uniswap governance was Unisoft had something that no one else had at that time. And it was like a long history of a large amount of real users. No other project had hundreds of thousands of users. And so definitely it was super exciting when we were kind of designing it, there was sort of, how do we wait against swappers versus versus liquidity providers? And early on, I think we were very liquidity provision oriented. Oh, they're the people who took on the most risk, but at the same time, we kept kind of coming back to like, we really want this to be owned by the community. And there is so many more people who participated in swapping the kind of allocating a significant amount to the swappers.
01:06:53.578 - 01:07:34.890, Speaker C: There was so much fewer lps that even though they got kind of less, a smaller portion of the distribution individually, they were very well rewarded. And so kind of allocating a huge amount just to evenly spread across all accounts that had ever touched Uniswap was really exciting. And some of the stories that came out of it were really incredible to me. People were kind of. Some examples of really awesome stories were like someone reached out about a class of students in rural Turkey where they had all kind of. Their teacher had got them all to try making a trade on uniswap, and suddenly they all had more than their full tuition's worth of worth of tokens.
01:07:35.050 - 01:07:35.710, Speaker A: Wow.
01:07:35.860 - 01:08:13.820, Speaker C: Or there are people in the Philippines who were playing Axio infinity and they received two year salary worth of tokens. So definitely there was a lot of really cool stories that came out of it, or even smaller ones, like people who, oh, I bought my engagement ring, or I bought a PS five. Definitely a lot of really cool stories that came out of it. And then the other kind of cool part is that it brought a lot more people in and engaged them. And I think on the first day or the second day, I think uni was maybe one of the, had the most unique account holders of any token, aside from maybe one other on Ethereum. So it was definitely a really cool, exciting event.
01:08:14.510 - 01:08:57.400, Speaker B: So let's zoom out really quick because I want to backpedal into the conversation of the shared values and ethos that Ethereum brings. And Hayden, at the start of this podcast, you talked about the different ways that Ethereum and Defi can redistribute wealth, and hopefully that is the through line of not just early Ethereum, but all of Ethereum into the future. And so as somebody who built this application that eventually had a token, which is then collectively now worth over $4 billion of distributed funds, how does it feel to have created something that was able to put $4 billion into over 100,000 individual people's hands, pat yourself on the back, how does that feel?
01:08:59.050 - 01:09:44.840, Speaker C: Definitely so much of that value was built by the Ethereum community and the community of people around it. I think it definitely is very inspiring to see how much has been built on and around Uniswap by the community. And the community is not just like Uniswap, like the whole Ethereum community, there's quite literally hundreds of applications building on top of Uniswap. We finally started tracking our integrations and somewhere in the world of 300 plus, maybe more different applications that are building on top of Uniswap. And so, yeah, it's definitely incredible to see all the kind of excitement and interactions. It's mind blowing how fast things can move in defi, for sure.
01:09:45.290 - 01:10:32.310, Speaker B: So the frequent metaphor that people use to try and explain what the Uniswap airdrop is to people that are unfamiliar with Defi is that it's like if you were riding for Uber or driving for Uber, and then Uber would just drop you some equity. Or if you're the user of Facebook, you would just get Facebook equity for using the application. And this has been a great through line, a great narrative boost to Ethereum at large. My question to you is, do you think that this event will actually result in the long term perception shift of humans at large and how we deal with equity with the applications or companies or whatevers that we use? Do you actually think that you have shifted the overton window?
01:10:33.130 - 01:11:25.026, Speaker C: I'm not sure. I think that sort of how we view it is more through the lens of governance and community kind of ownership and community building and how that can best be done in sort of a decentralized manner. How protocols, how do people kind of coordinate with protocols? And I do think that Uniswap has the chance to be very impactful on that front. One way to think about what Uniswap governance can do, the better way to think about it is like, what can't Uniswap governance do? And then you can imagine it can do literally anything else. What Uniswap governance can't do is steal all the funds from Uniswap protocol. Right. Because the smart contracts are immutable.
01:11:25.026 - 01:12:11.202, Speaker C: They're kind of know. The uniswap kind of protocol is truly sort of permissionless and decentralized in this way where truly trustless in this really meaningful way. And it was always very important to preserve that. And so when you think about what role does governance have, I think that the role that governance has shouldn't be to be a custody provider, right? And it's not. Right. The role is more like, well, what can't be done entirely through on chain smart contracts? Well, that's kind of governance roles. Anything that can be automated in smart contracts should be automated in smart contracts.
01:12:11.202 - 01:13:08.210, Speaker C: And then what can't be automated in smart contracts is sort of this coordination and kind of incentivization and kind of community growth thing. That's the thing that there's sort of this coordination that can't just be kind of automated. Right. Like humans building things can't just be kind of built into a smart contract, or it can be, but you kind of have to have some method of coordinating people. And I think that's generally a thing that is maybe sometimes lost in Ethereum right now is like, the importance of humans and social movements and people with values building things. There's sort of this. Sometimes this tendency towards, like, code is law and nothing should ever change and everything has to be completely automated forever.
01:13:08.210 - 01:13:26.750, Speaker C: But there's always going to be a human element, because we're all human beings. And that's kind of the role, on a very philosophical level, the role of kind of governance is to sort of try to coordinate the human element of a decentralized ecosystem.
01:13:28.850 - 01:14:18.574, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think people even forget, even with base protocols like Ethereum, there is this layer zero. There is this social layer to the system writ large. So here we are in the story. We've gone through kind of the legacy of v two, uniswap v two. And I feel like this is sort of almost the time in the episode where we get to talk about the thing that we teed up the entire time. Because up to this point, the way you've talked about V two has been even Uniswap V one has been that it's sort of an unfinished project, right? Like you had bigger, wilder ambitions, almost like Uniswap V one and V two were sort of a beta version, right? Sort of just a smaller instantiation of what the vision could be.
01:14:18.574 - 01:14:45.334, Speaker A: Now enter V three. And I know this is something that you've had to keep tight lips on for a while. Or I guess the Uniswap team has chosen this approach to keep us all shrouded in secret. But last week, you announced it to the world. You announced the launch date, which is May 5, which we're super excited about. You also launch some of the key details that would be contained in this thing called V three. And this is really more.
01:14:45.334 - 01:15:06.654, Speaker A: If V one was sort of, or V two was like a point release upgrade, this is a whole new version of Uniswap. It's almost like a whole new vision. And I'm not sure that I entirely understand all of the elements of it, Hayden, to be honest. So why don't you start by telling us, in your own words, what is cool about uniswap? V. Three.
01:15:06.852 - 01:15:42.150, Speaker C: Yeah. So maybe a starting place is like, what is the goal of uniswap V. Three? And I think that the goal of Uniswap v. Three, there's sort of been a lot of kind of like, automated market making has been almost disproportionately successful to the sort of capabilities that they provide. And that comes out of the fact that they sort of offer these new innovative things that traditional exchange models can't offer. Right. The sort of ability to incentivize liquidity, the ability for more people to participate, the kind of ease of providing liquidity.
01:15:42.150 - 01:16:22.806, Speaker C: All these kind of things are what make it success possible. Despite the kind of early reasons people said it would fail, which is issues around flexibility, issues around capital, efficiency, issues around just like efficiency of the system in general. Right. The kind of amount of capital that gets wasted, the sort of difficulties with expressing opinions, or like Uniswap v two kind of forces you to take very specific bets. People are always like, oh, it's a short straddle. Oh, it's like you're betting on mean reversion. People have all these things that they say that you're doing when you're providing liquidity on Uniswap v.
01:16:22.806 - 01:17:01.554, Speaker C: Two. And the point is that it generally is forcing tons of people to share the same strategy. And the problem with all amms, before Unisop v. Three, there's kind of various ones that have started to add more flexibility. But the problem generally is that there's always a cost to expressing your opinions imposed on the entire system. And what I mean by that is that, first off, as a general point, there's no single price curve, right? Amms, general. Right.
01:17:01.554 - 01:17:50.030, Speaker C: They create this sort of price curve that automatically sets prices, and it sort of automatically controls the rate at which they of, and there's several different projects. There's Uniswap, which has this very neutral curve of evenly distributing liquidity between zero and infinity. Then there's projects like curve, which sort of warp the shape of the curve such that the price updates slower when the price is closer to the price of one. The curve kind of flattens out and then spikes towards zero infinity. And then there's projects like balancer, which also kind of let you modify it a bit. But the general problem is that there's no one curve on a per pair basis. If you imagine a giving trading pair, there's no one curve that can optimally serve all trading pairs.
01:17:50.030 - 01:18:53.286, Speaker C: And then beyond that, even within a single trading pair, there's no one curve that can optimally serve all liquidity providers because liquidity providers have individual preferences. First off, pairs have individual market properties, different sort of volatilities, all of that. But beyond that, individual liquidity providers have different expectations for what the market properties for that pair will be. And so ultimately, if you expect an asset to move up, if you're very confident an asset will move up in value, versus if you're very confident an asset will move down in value, versus if you're very confident that the asset will move flat, how you would want to provide liquidity is very, very different. And you could imagine a very naive approach to kind of solving this expressiveness would be basically just through external aggregation. That's kind of like the balancer approach, which is like, okay, people can provide liquidity in a bunch of different ways. Or you could almost imagine like there's Dex aggregators that are aggregating your curve and uniswap and balancer, and you kind of have this sort of different aggregation across it.
01:18:53.286 - 01:19:52.346, Speaker C: But the problem there is that you have this very hefty aggregation cost where very frequently it's not worth the cost of checking, because ethereum is like a resource constrained environment. It's very frequently not worth the cost of checking two places because that doubles the network fee, or sometimes it more than doubles it. And so what Uniswap v. Three really aims to solve is bringing the expressiveness that's needed in liquidity provision without kind of introducing this aggregation cost per preference that's expressed, if that makes sense. So Uniswap v three kind of has this very efficient way of batching every single person's preferences into a way that you can kind of aggregate across an infinite range amount of them while still supporting efficient trading. Yeah, maybe I should pause for a second. I can keep going, but there's, let.
01:19:52.368 - 01:20:26.458, Speaker B: Me try and spit that back at you and see if you like my summary. To me, the infinite malleability of uniswap v three goes from what uniswap v two is, which is, here's your price curve. Attention to trading pairs. Ether die. Here's your price curve. It's x times y equals k. And then with uniswap v three, the infinite malleability of being able to generate more parameters around where liquidity providers want to, or how to provide liquidity.
01:20:26.458 - 01:21:14.098, Speaker B: All of a sudden, instead of uniswap dictating what the price curve is, it's the market discovering what the price curve should be, or could be that is optimal for those specific trading pairs. So all of a sudden, because of the programmability of the expressiveness of Uniswap v three. What you said is it gives the option to express opinions about the future outcomes of assets. What that does is that generates a unique price curve for every single trading pair. And that price curve is going to be determined by the market participants who think that they have the optimal price curve. And naturally, the market participants that are correct are the ones that are ultimately going to dictate what that price curve looks down the line. How does that definition land with you?
01:21:14.184 - 01:22:01.586, Speaker C: Very close, I'd say that. Very close. I think the only thing that I would add is that the market participants who are correct are probably the ones who are going to do the best, which is maybe the only kind of flip. There's no necessarily right way. The whole point is that there's no single right way to provide liquidity, right? And the market might conform around an opinion that's ultimately incorrect, and maybe there would have been a better distribution, but there's no way to perfectly know that. And so it more just like anyone who wants to provide liquidity can now provide liquidity in a way that better expresses their opinions. If you think ETH is never going below $1,000, again, not investment advice, but if you think that you will want to provide liquidity in a very different way from if you think ETH is never going above 3000.
01:22:01.586 - 01:22:52.290, Speaker C: Right. And so there's different ways that you'll want to provide liquidity if you have different preferences. And I think that there's definitely a lot of kind of, right now there's a lot of sort of early confusion about what it will look like and how people will be able to kind of understand it enough to express their preferences. But I think that that's sort of just kind of follows kind of how utop has always been, which is that it takes you a while to understand it, but then eventually it's going to be understandable, and then more people are going to be able to participate the same way that no one understood v one when it launched. And then as you were kind of talking by defi summer there, it's all these people who understood it and were able to engage it. It might be a little bit of a similar process where it takes some time for people to understand how to express their preferences, but then they will be able to express those preferences. Maybe one other kind of lens to just talk through this quickly is like capital efficiency, like price risk.
01:22:52.290 - 01:23:07.766, Speaker C: There's sort of these two fundamental things that people have always talked about in the amm space, I invented this word impermanent loss. Some regrets at times, but what would.
01:23:07.788 - 01:23:09.240, Speaker A: You have rather called it?
01:23:09.930 - 01:23:52.166, Speaker C: Some people have said it should be called like, unrealized loss. Or maybe let me just define what it is and then talk a little bit about it in the context of slippage. What impermanent loss is, is basically the price risk you take on as a liquidity provider. Like inherent to providing liquidity. One way to think about what you're doing when you're providing liquidity is you're essentially saying, I'm willing to sell tokens on either side of the market price, right? In v two, at least, you're always willing to sell like an equal amount on either side of the market price. What that means is basically, if a token is going up in value, you're sort of selling that token and raising the price a little bit. Every unit of that token you sell, you raise the price of the next one by a small amount.
01:23:52.166 - 01:24:58.380, Speaker C: And so you're basically like selling tokens as they're rising in value. Or similarly, if the token is falling in value, you're kind of buying those tokens as they're following in value. And so this kind of concept of impermanent loss is essentially the idea that if you buy a token at a lower price and then it rises in value, it would have been better to not, sorry. If you sell a token at a lower price and then it rises in value, it actually would have been better to not sell it, wait for it to rise in value, and then sell it at a higher value, or just hold it in your wallet because it's now worth more. The flip side though, and the reason that I kind of had this term impermanent is it kind of gets at this idea of, well, what if the price falls back down to where it started? If the price returns to where it started, it actually wasn't a bad idea to sell it at a lower price because it eventually returned to that price. And you sort of like, if the price returns back to where you started, you just end up back where you started. And so it wasn't a bad idea to buy or to sell on the way up in the first place.
01:24:58.380 - 01:26:02.378, Speaker C: And Unison v two always had this sort of trade off between this. If you enter at one moment and exit at another moment, at that moment, the difference in prices, sort of that impermanent loss or unrealized loss becomes realized. And at that moment, what you want is you want to have collected enough fees to kind of offset the downsides for selling some tokens at a suboptimal price. But it's worth noting that amms are like a two sided marketplace, and there's another participant in this system, and that's the traders and people kind of, for some reason, people always forget about traders in amms and only think about it through the lens of liquidity providers. If you think about it from the trader's perspective, what does a trader want? A trader wants to buy tokens at a good price. And if there's some sort of like, if there's a current market price for that token, they want to be able to buy as many tokens as close to that market price as possible. And so if you think about it from that perspective, the more tokens that a liquidity provider is willing to sell closer to the market price, the better rates traders are getting.
01:26:02.378 - 01:26:50.426, Speaker C: And so that's like the other side of the sort of marketplace, which is like the less price risk a liquidity provider is willing to take on, the less impermanent loss a liquidity provider is willing to take on, the worse race traders get. Because if they're willing to sell less tokens closer to the market price, that means the person trading is able to buy less close to the market price. And so it's just like worth noting that how much price you're willing to take on directly impacts how much trading volume you can support and how good the prices can be. And so we call it like an iron law trade off. It's just a trade off matrix of how much am I willing to sell close to the market price. The more you are, the better rates. The more price risk.
01:26:50.426 - 01:27:07.254, Speaker C: The further away the less price risk, the worse the rates. And there's no right answer. Right. That's once again why we have to create this expressiveness. That's why you have to make it possible for people to choose for themselves how much price risk they're willing to take on versus how much trading volume they want to support.
01:27:07.372 - 01:27:12.674, Speaker A: So Hayden, how does this tie into capital efficiency then, when you give everyone those choices?
01:27:12.722 - 01:28:35.650, Speaker C: Yeah, there's some really easy things to kind of say here, which is, I wish I had written down some numbers to give examples, but you could imagine very early on when we were working on Uniswap v three, something that we realized, and I don't remember, the price of ETH was probably like in the $200 range, but we realized something about, you have say like $10 million in the ETH die pool. And what we realized is about like a quarter of the liquidity in those contracts existed for buying ETH below the price of $10 when ETH is like 200, and like a quarter existed for selling ETH above 5000. So you have all this inventory in the contracts that are sitting on these sort of obscure edges of the smart contracts, just waiting for prices that might never be reached. And so when you think about people focus a lot on impermanent loss, which is like, oh, I sold some tokens and I didn't get the optimal rate, but they're forgetting the kind of other, maybe more important component of it, which is what we're calling the inventory risk, which is basically uniswap v two made you hold 50 50 value in two tokens. And essentially what you do when you put, let's say you put in like $1,000. Essentially, you're putting in $500 on ETH to die. You're putting in $500 for buying ETH.
01:28:35.650 - 01:29:27.646, Speaker C: You put $500 of die to buy ETH at every single price between the market price and zero, and it's evenly distributed. And then you put in $500 of ETH to sell at every single price between the market price and infinity. And so you have, like, a huge amount of capital that's just completely wasted on the fringes, because if you never expect those prices to be reached, any capital that goes there is just a complete waste. And this kind of effect is massively compounded for things like stablecoin. Stablecoin pairs, where you expect the vast majority of trading to happen in maybe a 1% price movement, maybe less even. And so the fact that something like 99.9% of capital exists for prices that might never, rarely will ever be reached is just completely, just like a massive waste.
01:29:27.646 - 01:30:33.110, Speaker C: And I guess I want to tie it quickly back to the inventory risk, which I was mentioning, which is some people provide liquidity on ETH to die and maybe have a very high degree of confidence that ETH will go up in the near future. Some people provide liquidity and have a very high degree of confidence eth will go down. Some people provide liquidity and have a very high degree of confidence ETH will be flat. And because of that, with uniswap v three, there's now three different ways you might want to kind of provide your liquidity. As I had just mentioned, 50% of the capital in v two, basically is die liquidity, buying it below the market price. But what if you don't expect eth to go down, then why are you, if you're expecting eth to go up, then why are you holding dai in a smart contract to buy eth at low prices? It's just wasted capital and it's exposure to an asset that you don't want to hold. On the flip side, if you think that ETH is going to go down, then all the ETH that you're holding for selling at a price of $10,000, why are you holding ETH to sell at $10,000 when you think ETH is going to go down? That's like nonsense.
01:30:33.110 - 01:31:56.146, Speaker C: So in unison v three, you could essentially imagine there's two different ways to think about it. One way to think about it is you could take sort of, if you sort of constrain the price range in which you expect trading, most trading activity, and the price to kind of stay within for a given period of time, you could almost imagine all capital that's wasted, that's kind of sitting outside of, that can basically be removed. And so you might be able to provide liquidity with basically put in 25% or 10% of the value that you would have to put into v two to create the exact same exposure support, the exact same amount of trading that you would in v two with maybe 10% of the capital, 20% of the capital, whatever it is. The other way to think about it is maybe you have a very high degree of confidence that the price will stay around the market price and be a sideways market for a long time, then you can actually maybe, rather than putting less underlying capital to create the same effect, you could put the same amount of underlying capital to create a much greater magnified effect. And so, rather than putting in $100 instead of $1,000, that same effect, you could put in $1,000 and create ten times the effect. And so, being able to create massive amounts of liquidity, and when we talk about how amplified this can be, an example would be if you were to provide liquidity only between, say, 99.9 cents and a dollar and 0.1
01:31:56.146 - 01:32:40.320, Speaker C: cent, which you can do on like a stablecoin. Stablecoin pair with $1 million in uniswap v three, you can create the exact same amount of liquidity that you would, and it take on the same price risk, but still that you would need $2 billion in uniswap v two to create. And so you can basically put a million dollars in, and as long as it's trading between that price range, the sort of effect is completely identical in terms of price risk, or sort of completely identical in terms of impermanent loss and fees earned and liquidity created as $2 billion in, like, a diuSDC V two pair. But all the remaining whatever, there's, like, a huge amount of capital that you now can kind of allocate to other things.
01:32:41.250 - 01:33:40.610, Speaker A: Anyway, so, Hayden, my mental imagery for this, and one we've used before, is like, you ever see that clips from that old tv show robot wars, where you've got these people are constructing these mechanical robots, and you put them in an octagon and they face off and they fight. My imagery model for this is. This is what's happening with automated market makers and with exchanges, right? You have these different protocols, and they're all trying to win at this whole liquidity war. And so you've got, like, uniswap over here with its version of its curve, and then you've got curve over here, and you've got balancer. You've got all of the others, and they're all kind of competing for this liquidity in this robot wars game. What I think you've done, and maybe this is how I understand what you were saying earlier. You said earlier in our conversation that uniswap V one and V two is almost similar to, like, single collateral die, right? And the new Uniswap V three, that's multicolateral die.
01:33:40.610 - 01:34:13.210, Speaker A: What I think you meant there is, with uniswap V three, you can essentially be any curve. You're not just coming into the robot war with a buzsaw and attacking another robot who's got, like, a blowtorch. You've now got all the weapons. You've got the buzsaw, you got the blowtorch, you've got the thing that's going to destroy the top of the other robot. You've got all of the weapons at your disposal. And the market then chooses what the most efficient weapons are going to be. So you don't even have to plan and aggregate all of these strategies together.
01:34:13.210 - 01:34:32.900, Speaker A: You don't have to have individuals come and say, this is the curve. It should be a human being who does that. You just basically get the market makers to decide, right? Because the market makers will pick the optimal weapons and optimal strategies to optimize your uniswap robot. Weird analogy. But for some reason, that works for me. How does that land?
01:34:34.230 - 01:35:22.100, Speaker C: I dig the analogy. I pretty much agree with you there. It basically just opens up this whole range of almost existing projects could almost build themselves on top of uniswap. If existing projects are kind of like specific market making strategies, then those could be expressed through Uniswap e three. I think that we're going to start to see a movement from projects that are kind of trying to build their own way of market making to projects that are basically using Uniswap e three as a way of expressing market making strategies and getting people to adopt them who kind of share common opinions. And so definitely, yeah, it goes from this sort of single use case or this sort of single curve to this. Just anyone can create any curve within it.
01:35:22.100 - 01:36:29.450, Speaker C: And in a way that's like huge amount of props to the engineers who built it that's actually quite efficient on Ethereum, which is hard to kind of overstate how much work it was to get there. We had the designs pretty well fleshed out maybe by nine months ago, ten months ago. But making that kind of an efficient system, making that efficient was just a massive task. But it's here now and I think that we've seen a lot of interest from the community. Something that's maybe very different from how Uniswap might be now versus how it was before is before it was like iterating to the version of the protocol to build the ecosystem on. And now it's not to say that there hasn't been an ecosystem that's been building, but it's like now there's this real moment where the community can come in and kind of build all. Like there's so much that needs to get built on v three because of how much more expressive it is, because it's more complex.
01:36:29.450 - 01:37:04.980, Speaker C: But ultimately in the long run, it's like the most flexible, most kind of long term oriented Amm design that exists. Right. We're trying to be forward looking with the design and what will be needed three years, four years from now. We're not expecting some massive overhaul. We don't have another 1000 x improvement on amm up our sleeve. The point from here is it's up to the community to kind of build out what market making and liquidity provision looks like. On top of this.
01:37:06.870 - 01:37:59.854, Speaker A: One thing I think that the community needs to build out, and David's going to get to this question, is liquidity for some of these positions because they're nfts, they've moved from ERC twenty s to nfts and we'll get to that in a minute. But before we do, Hayden, just like one, I guess downstream effect of sort of unlimited curves is that rather than everyone sharing the same dumb strategy as an LP might today, this is really going to professionalize liquidity providers in that you have to be armed with a best strategy if you're actually going to make money at this liquidity game, what are the implications or downstream effects of that? Some people have said, well, one negative effect is possibly this no longer democratizes providing liquidity to the protocol because the experts and the pros and the quant, they'll do all of the work here. Any thoughts on that?
01:37:59.992 - 01:39:06.650, Speaker C: Yeah, I have so many thoughts on this. I wrote some notes about it. I'm going to try to get through everything because there's like a lot to unpack here. And I think that just some high level points would be that. First off, if you're democratizing by forcing people to provide liquidity with suboptimal strategies, that's not a long term winning method of, that's not an efficient marketplace, that's not something that will win in the long run, is, oh, well, we're going to force everyone to use inefficient strategies because that's the only fair thing we can do. That doesn't make sense and it doesn't work. I will say, though, despite the kind of recent narratives that have come out of v three, I think a lot of that comes out of complexity and how early on it is sort of similar to how I mentioned v one was received in the very long run, and I can kind of back out from some of this stuff, but in the very long run I'm incredibly, incredibly excited and optimistic and bullish for passive liquidity provision and broadening the user base of who provides liquidity.
01:39:06.650 - 01:40:59.550, Speaker C: I think that if you look at, there's sort of this analogy that we like to talk about, probably a lot of it's me and Dan Robinson and kind of other people on the team is like, if you, you can kind of compare passive investing strategies to active investing strategies in the history of them, which is like if you went back 50 years and you said, oh, in the long run, active money managers are going to get outcompeted by retail clubs who invest a small amount in everything. You'd think that they were crazy. But what you saw with index funds is that in the long run, very few active money managers outcompete these sort of broad indexes that most people have their money parked in, where everyone kind of investing a little bit in everything somehow is like for the vast majority of wealth, it's like how investing works. And I think that we have some very long term views on this happening with liquidity provision, which is that rather than your sort of over time complexity in market making often comes from sort of, especially for very volatile assets and very volatile, the most popular kind of short tail of assets, especially volatile assets. That's where it becomes very difficult for passive market makers to compete for very low volatility. Assets like stablecoins or in the traditional world, you can imagine, like fiat, like euro to USD, that sort of thing there. The passive strategies are going to be just like simple enough that I think passive will outcompete active by having lower margins to participating what we really expect to see over the long run.
01:40:59.550 - 01:41:33.738, Speaker C: I kind of talked about Uniswap being like a forward looking protocol. Over the long run, we kind of anticipate crypto becoming less volatile. If it's successful, it will realize its value. Right now, it's all this potential that we see, but over time it will realize its value, and a lot of things will become a lot less volatile. We're not expecting these 30% single day movements on the biggest assets in the world. If Ethereum is the biggest asset in the world in the future, we're not expecting it to move 30% in a day. Right? So it's worth noting that these things will become less volatile over time.
01:41:33.738 - 01:42:52.340, Speaker C: And as they become less volatile, passive dominance becomes a lot more feasible and possible and likely. I think that there's kind of a few other points, which is, as I mentioned, active lps kind of do best on volatile and very popular assets. And that's because active lps, they have high overhead. There's sort of a cost to kind of adding on new strategies, and they don't want to take risk, and it's not worth basically them participating in the sort of long tail of markets and to kind of go back to that sort of user generated content, YouTube type analogy. There's no way Uniswap has had 35,000 pairs deployed to uniswap v two. And just to how many trading pairs do professional market makers are they actually going to basically want to hold inventory in and provide liquidity on? And so there might always be this room for active lps to come in, and there might always be an area where they do dominate, which is like sort of the subset of assets where it's very profitable for them, the subset of assets that are still very volatile and hard to do optimal strategies. But it's also worth noting that that's not automatically a bad thing.
01:42:52.340 - 01:43:46.242, Speaker C: If active lps are coming in and offering better prices if active lps are coming in and offering better prices on more risky assets, that means traders are getting better rates on more risky assets. And so the fact that active lps can kind of come in and better serve traders in more volatile markets, I don't know if that should be viewed as a purely bad thing. I think it's viewed as a bad thing in part because there's sort of this fear that there won't be a place for passive liquidity provision. But I guess what I'm trying to say here is that on low volatility markets, which we're expecting to be more dominant over time in crypto as well as on the long tail, passive is going to dominate on all of that. And I expect that to be far greater value than the sort of subset of volatile but very popular assets. And we'll see. And the fact that active comes in there I don't think should be seen as a purely bad thing.
01:43:46.242 - 01:43:52.726, Speaker C: I have a few more things to say. I know I've been talking about this one for a long time. As mentioned, I took notes on this one.
01:43:52.828 - 01:45:21.022, Speaker B: So, Hayden, let's zoom out a little bit and talk about some specifics. So with Uniswap V three, we have this much maximally expressive amm curve versus Uniswap V one and V two, which was a fixed, locked, rigid price curve. And with all engineering, there's trade offs, right? So now that we've unlocked expressivity and uniqueness in strategies for lping in Uniswap, what that does is that makes the LP positions for these Uniswap lps non fungible. Right? One strategy is not the same as another strategy. So no longer do we have the ERC 20 LP tokens, which have historically been extremely awesome as collateral inside of applications because of how they are fungible. But now they are fractured into nfts and each one is different, which means that we've kind of lost this ability to use these nfts as homogeneous collateral in DFI, but we've also lost the ability for lazy liquidity providing, which is one of the things that was really touted as one of Uniswap's V ones and V two s best features, is like, well, it democratizes access to LP, but kind of what the throughline here is what we're saying is that it's only democratizing access to LP because it's actually really inefficient and it just forces everyone into this really inefficient strategy. And so moving forward into the future, I see a world where these market makers are competing with various strategies, and these strategies are instantiated in the NFT strategies.
01:45:21.022 - 01:46:07.170, Speaker B: And rather than being individuals competing to generate the right strategy and therefore the most optimal NFT LP position. Perhaps this is actually better served by other protocols on Ethereum. Perhaps something like a yearn vault or other. We've seen set protocol do robo trading and other social trading where people will compete on their strategies. Do you see this? And there's immense demand for lazy LP, right, just here's my capital. Generate yield, generate as much yield as possible. Do you see the application layer of ethereum coming to facilitate this need of a recombining fractured liquidity in nfts and also providing lazy liquidity solutions?
01:46:07.510 - 01:46:53.470, Speaker C: Yeah, so, absolutely. And just to step or to back up a second. Well, maybe we don't need to back up that far. First off, something that always gave us a huge amount of comfort building uniswap v three when it came to this topic is that uniswap v two is a subset of uniswap v three. You can make the Uniswap v two strategy in v three very easily, and then you can very easily make that fungible if you want. It's worth noting that of course, then you are competing with more active people who are concentrating their liquidity and maybe earning higher returns closer to the market price. But it's also worth noting that Uniswap V two lps were always eventually going to compete with more efficient liquidity provision.
01:46:53.470 - 01:48:13.820, Speaker C: And to be honest, it will still be better to take the v two strategy in v three than to keep your liquidity in v two. Because once v three starts offering better prices because it has sort of more concentrated liquidity, it might not be worth the aggregation cost of trading across v two and v three simultaneously, versus if you take the v two strategy in v three, you're actually kind of getting a free aggregation with all the trading through v three. And so you are always going to be competing with v three. You're still going to be competing with v three if you stay in v two, but in a way where the aggregation has an additional cost to aggregating you. So if v three is operating better prices already, you're getting no volume instead of some percentage of volume while taking on the same sort of price risk either way. So there's sort of just like this subnote of like I've kind of seen various people talk about how, oh, maybe we'll stay in v two, but really, as v three is a subset of v three, there's almost no reason to ever do that. In general, though, as you mentioned, there's just no way to kind of treat all liquidity as identical, when not all liquidity is doing the same thing.
01:48:13.820 - 01:49:24.340, Speaker C: So there is no way to preserve fungibility across all liquidity in a pool. Some interesting things though, however, is you do still have a measure of who is providing liquidity, where their liquidity exists, whether or not it's currently in range. And so one thing that fungible liquidity is used for that maybe people are worried might not be possible, is something like liquidity mining, where you're kind of evenly paying out some new token to existing lps on a pair sort of prorata proportional to their contribution. What's interesting to note is that it is entirely possible to create an NFT position manager where someone can deposit an NFT. And basically the way that liquidity is tracked, we have enough sort of data to create a liquidity mining system where you can back out how much any individual liquidity provider provided liquidity over a period of time and for how long. You can basically back out whether or not someone's liquidity was in range. So you could essentially do liquidity mining across all lps, even if they have non fungible positions in a sort of fair, equal way.
01:49:24.340 - 01:50:21.650, Speaker C: But I think that what gets sort of maybe another sort of aspect, so the liquidity mining thing is already kind of possible and doesn't really need to be rethought or made fungible to do it that way. But I think that the other things that David's talking about, which is like using liquidity as collateral or even just maybe there's two things. One is using liquidity as collateral and the other thing is basically just no thought liquidity provision. How do I provide liquidity and not think at all about what I'm doing? There's sort of a few things. One, there's a huge amount of room for teams to come in, and we've already seen an outpouring of interest from various teams across the space to come in and design these strategies of kind of different expressive ways to provide liquidity, and those include urine. But there's also sort of a whole range of other projects that are thinking about it. And there's some notes which are.
01:50:21.650 - 01:51:13.620, Speaker C: One note is basically no thought liquidity provision might be more suited towards less volatile pairs. And so to some extent it's possible that some of these more risky pairs will see less people doing sort of no thought liquidity provision. But at the same time it's possible that there are people who are down to think about it and other people just want to trust someone else to think about it for them or trust a series of people to think about for them. And that's where you have this kind of vault style ux where it's definitely possible to have sophisticated parties managing liquidity and managing sort of long term strategies and other people just adopting them. And so I think that we see a very large amount of room for that one way. We're thinking about the UX of V three. We're kind of doing interface work on it right now.
01:51:13.620 - 01:52:16.760, Speaker C: We have this kind of initial interface, which is basically just fully expressive, which basically gives you full access to every feature in V three. And that's kind of like the starting place that you build everything else on, which is like, it needs to be possible to provide liquidity within a bounded range for a given fee tier, all that stuff. And then the next step is basically, okay, well, what if people kind of want to sort of, maybe some people want to manage it themselves, but sort of want to have sort of preset types of understanding? I'm more bullish on this token. I'm more at risk averse to that token. It's possible you don't need necessarily a vault ux to kind of express that sort of opinion of if you think EtH is going to go up over the next year, you can tweak your sort of. We're talking about them, we're kind of considering them almost like templates, but almost design like pre built strategies which aren't managed on chain or automated. But instead you basically preset sort of how you provide liquidity, and maybe you update it once a year or once every three months, kind of depends on the time horizon you're thinking on.
01:52:16.760 - 01:53:02.680, Speaker C: And it sort of expresses your opinions a little bit better. And then the sort of final step is these sort of more managed active ones, which are kind of continuously keeping more liquidity closer to the market price, maybe earning higher fees, taking on a higher risk, for sure. And so there's kind of a world for all these different things, and we want to kind of contribute to that. But we also think that there's so much room, the whole world of like, oh, we're going to build these competing amms. I think that that whole world should now be like, oh, we should build competing amm strategies, but just, we don't need to build the amm, we can just build the strategies. So, yeah, I think that I'm incredibly excited for what's going to be built on top of it and how the community will come together to kind of solve these problems.
01:53:03.370 - 01:53:17.370, Speaker B: Hayden, I really want to quickly touch this subject before we move on to the future of uniswap. But there are three fee tiers, three specific fee tiers in uniswap v. Three. Why just three specific ones and not a spectrum?
01:53:18.350 - 01:54:10.460, Speaker C: We ran the whole gamut on this one. We explored every possible option, maybe to just make sure everyone, like people listening, understand why one or the other, and what this sort of trade off space is. While we have gotten to the point where, while unisoft v. Three solves this problem of I want to sell more tokens closer to this price or to that price, what it doesn't solve and sort of still, like prorata, splits out. It still kind of lets you kind of earn fees pro rada proportional to the amount of liquidity you're contributing in a given range, as opposed to just underlying capital. But you can't disproportionately reward some lps over others, all lps. There still needs to be like a common shared fee relative to the amount of risk you're taking on and what that fee should be.
01:54:10.460 - 01:54:58.794, Speaker C: Kind of similar to the sort of fundamental problem. There's no necessarily. There's no single right answer to it, right. It's basically based on the sort of risk tolerance, it's based on the sort of volatility of the asset. On the flip side, something that's so incredible about unitsolve v three is it solves, as I kind of mentioned earlier, it solves this aggregation problem where people can take on unique strategies and they're all perfectly aggregated together. So the balancer v one approach was essentially, we're going to let anyone deploy a pair with any fee. But our concern about that approach is essentially that it leads to too much liquidity fragmentation, sort of having a fee level that if there's an aggregation cost to having a fee level at 0.3%
01:54:58.794 - 01:55:38.946, Speaker C: and also at 00:30 2% and also at zero point, 35%, there's sort of this inefficiency from that, this aggregation inefficiency. So what we really wanted is to encourage liquidity to kind of congregate at sort of distinct levels where the aggregation cost outweighs the kind of sort of marginal difference between sort of like being somewhere in the middle. We set three initial fee tiers, kind of designed for the 0.3% of uniswap V. Two, I think, has worked far better than people could have possibly imagined. That was one of the biggest things people said uniswap would never work is because it only had a 0.3% fee tier.
01:55:38.946 - 01:56:07.710, Speaker C: But what you see is it's currently doing a billion dollars of trading, has $5 billion of liquidity, and it actually works pretty nicely for a huge amount of assets. And so the way we're thinking about it is we want liquidity to kind of congregate at specific levels that makes most sense on a per pair basis. And so the 0.5% fee tier is like this catch all, like kind assets. We're basically expecting all of them to go in there. 0.3% is kind of this uniswap V two, like catch them all generic.
01:56:07.710 - 01:56:39.194, Speaker C: And then this 1% is maybe for these sort of more niche use cases, super high risks, super sort of short term, like things that are only around for a short amount of time. So you need more fees. There's sort of this higher risk fee tier or higher volatility. And it's possible we need more in the long term. And this is something that actually uniswap governance will be able to add on additional fee tiers. But what we don't want, we could have added, say, a 0.2% fee tier, but our sort of current guess is that the kind of inefficiency of having a 0.2
01:56:39.194 - 01:56:54.142, Speaker C: and a zero three of aggregating across that will outweigh the benefits of having this sort of slightly more expressiveness. And so that's kind of where the feat here kind of come into play, is it's sort of this general trade off space.
01:56:54.276 - 01:57:31.114, Speaker A: So before we leave v three, we got to talk about oracles, and I was curious. You referenced oracles in the context of v two, and you were saying how Dan Robinson, you guys were talking about how they kind of work, but they're not optimized. But to me, I was always wondering if oracles in uniswap were almost like a byproduct, like a public good, right. The Uniswap protocol itself provides liquidity. It provides trading. Oracles are just kind of a byproduct or an afterthought, a public good for the ecosystem. Is that how you view them? And how are oracles changing in v three?
01:57:31.312 - 01:58:48.626, Speaker C: So maybe this really high level point that I don't see talked about nearly enough, is that the sort of current thought on how the kind of current approach to oracles, I don't know if I should say projects by name, but the way that a lot of people think about oracles is basically bringing off chain data on chain. And when it comes to the price of decentralized, when it comes to centralized assets, that makes 100% sense. When it comes to bridging real world assets and centralized things to the decentralized world, that makes sense. But if we create a world where 99.9% of all trading happens on chain, on decentralized platforms, then why do we need these sort of bridge things that bridge data from a centralized world to a decentralized one, when the trading itself, the trading activity, actually already happens on chain? And so for assets to have their trading happen on chain, there is no reason for people to be like bridging that data or interpreting. You basically can just directly check the data yourself. In doing so, you're not adding on any additional trust assumptions.
01:58:48.626 - 01:59:31.778, Speaker C: There's definitely various what is the cost of attacking this considerations, but you're not adding in these sort of new outside dynamics to it. You can basically create sort of self contained, fully on chain sort of oracles that where you don't need to really think about who's reporting the prices, or if there's sort of some mechanism around that, it's more like, oh, the smart contract can just natively check the prices and what prices they were trading at on chain. And in a world where Uniswap is the primary market for an asset, there's no real reason to be bridging data from binance. Or so I might have forgot. What was your question about?
01:59:31.864 - 01:59:40.280, Speaker A: My question at the lead off was whether Uniswap views oracles as a public good, or is it fundamental to the protocol itself?
01:59:40.970 - 02:00:37.014, Speaker C: So I think that it views it as a fundamental to a fundamental part of any sort of trading protocol or any sort of exchange is providing price discovery and having that be useful externally. Right. Like the way that oracle aggregation products work is they're taking prices from off chain exchanges and putting them on chain essentially. And so part of providing trading is also providing price discovery. And so I think that, yeah, it is basically this public good for the rest of the community, but in a way that really benefits uniswap as well, because it enables all these things to be built up around it. And so we do view oracles as incredibly important to Uniswap because if it enables more things to be built on it, more decentralized, more trustless things to be built on it, that sort of drives more value back to the network ultimately in the long run. So it's kind of like a network effects thing.
02:00:37.014 - 02:00:51.466, Speaker C: It's kind of like aiding the community in building more products. You can even think about all these algo stablecoins, they all use Uniswap t waps, because they're sort of, not all of them, that's probably, but most vast majority of them kind of came out of being able to have on chain price.
02:00:51.648 - 02:01:04.110, Speaker A: It's definitely on chain oracle that is censorship resistant and trustless. It's definitely like a core primitive that DFI needs to run on top of. But what's different about the oracles in v three versus v two?
02:01:04.260 - 02:01:22.454, Speaker C: Yeah, basically the difference about oracles in v three versus v two is that they're massively easier to use and to integrate, and they expose a lot more data at any given moment. I think that this was actually, I listened to your kind of breakdown of unison v three, and I think that this is maybe the one error you guys got a little bit wrong, was.
02:01:22.492 - 02:01:27.560, Speaker A: Like, that's generous, because we felt like we got more than one wrong doing okay.
02:01:28.330 - 02:02:11.686, Speaker C: But basically we kind of came up with this in v two, this model where you sort of basically have this stored price accumulator, where you check the value at one moment, and if you check at some other moment in the future, you can get like a perfect average across that period of time. And that's sort of the starting point for uniswap v three. Uniswap v three has that as well. And so you could check at one moment, you could check a year later, you could check two years later and get a perfect one year or two year average. You could also check 10 minutes later, get a perfect ten minute average. However, there was this kind of constraint with v two, which is that you need to check at the exact moment that you need to average across. And so if want a 1 hour average in uniswap v two, you have to check at one moment at the start of that hour, not just any hour.
02:02:11.686 - 02:03:01.990, Speaker C: You have to start at the check at the start of the hour to get the checkpoint. You have to check again at the end of that hour, and then you average across that uniswap v three. Oracles basically stores this kind of array of historical data points. How we did that while decreasing the net gas cost to traders is sort of the magic of it and what made it possible. But now it basically stores up to nine days of historical data, where as long as you're checking an average within the last nine days, you don't need to be online at the exact moment, you don't need to have a previous checkpoint, which is very expensive, by the way. The checkpoint, you checkpoint and you check it again, you average, it requires multiple transactions. You have to store that data here you can check at one moment and you could say, what is the average over the last hour without having a prior data point.
02:03:01.990 - 02:03:26.590, Speaker C: Or you could say what was an average starting if it's on Tuesday. You could say what was the average from Sunday at 01:00 p.m. To Sunday at 03:00 p.m. And you can get that on chain in that moment without any prior data in a very gas efficient manner. And so it basically just opens up this world of much higher sophistication, much easier to build, much easier to integrate, kind of oracle based projects on Ethereum.
02:03:27.010 - 02:04:05.062, Speaker B: And also very much in align with the increased expressivity that we are finding in v three. And I expect the infrastructure around Uniswap v three lp to really get adopted quickly. And perhaps maybe these oracles are a little bit further down the line in adoption. But like you said, ultimately we are going to live in a bankless world, and we won't need external price references to understand the values of our assets, because we'll just be able to get them from Uniswap. The last thing about Uniswap B three that I want to touch on is the software license. Can you explain the rationale behind the software license, Hayden?
02:04:05.206 - 02:04:42.520, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. I think that one kind of starting point is basically that our team is very like, we're massive believers in open source software. We're huge fans of it. Everything that we've built up to this date has been sort of basically under GPL. Right. The reason that sort of all these kind of folks exist is because of how kind of committed we've been to open source software. I think that something else that we're very committed to is like the Uniswap community and to the Ethereum community.
02:04:42.520 - 02:06:06.754, Speaker C: And that I think one kind of observation is that we're not fully convinced that kind of the sort of early days of the Internet views on free open source software, like how that kind of evolved, fully anticipated how decentralized finance, the world of decentralized finance that we exist into today. And I think that some of what is possible now wasn't possible then, and some of how value is built now is not how value is built then. And so I think that's like a very kind of important framing for this, which is basically in the long run, we think that the world should exist on sort of open source rails, open source infrastructure. And the license of Uniswap v three is essentially a time delayed GPL license. So in two years or sooner, it will be GPL, right? There's no way for anyone to increase it past two years. Part of it was that we wanted the Uniswap community, which is kind of ultimately sort of responsible for the Uniswap protocol moving forward, to have a say in this process. Does Uniswap protocol want finance forking v three, day one and pouring all their money into that fork? I'm not convinced that that's what's desired by the Uniswap community.
02:06:06.754 - 02:06:55.570, Speaker C: And so we kind of gave the governance has this ability to accelerate the license if it wants, or to provide exemptions if it wants, through these sort of onchain governance votes, and ultimately it will be GPL. But I think that giving the community time to kind of digest v three, to start building on top of v three without worrying about finance forking from day one is maybe something that is desired by the community. I have to say that we were a little bit unsure how it would be viewed. I think that our team kind of stands by that as massive open source fans. Our team was basically unanimous in this decision in how to kind of license this code. And I think that overall, we did have some. We were a little bit unsure how it would be received by the community.
02:06:55.570 - 02:07:37.680, Speaker C: But I have to say, from what I've seen, it's received a fairly positive response. And I've probably had much more people reach out to me and say that they're happy with the license than had people reach out and say that they're unhappy. And I've had people at other projects reach out and say that they've been thinking about the same things and that they're considering using it for their project. And I think it's just worth noting that how early DeFi is and how these networks will ultimately evolve is still being figured out. And I think that we've never been like a project that's afraid to try to push the boundaries and innovate and build in new ways. And so I think that that's kind of how we see what we're doing here.
02:07:39.010 - 02:08:17.850, Speaker A: So, Hayden, maybe this dovetails with the last question. So this is a time delayed license, right? And you mentioned binance, smart contract chain. And we were also referencing, I think the through line for this entire episode is also ethereum values, right? Trustlessness, permissionlessness, decentralization. Many of these are also bankless values that aren't instantiated on other chains in other locations. Let's talk about optimism. Right? So maybe this also goes back to the moral of the story, as David was saying, which is if Carl gives you advice. If your friend Carl gives you advice, you take that advice.
02:08:17.850 - 02:08:49.666, Speaker A: Carl's on the optimism team, among many others. But this is an ethereum optimistic roll up, which bankless listeners will be familiar with. With that technology. We've had Vitalik describe it before and others. And what was interesting about Uniswap V three is you didn't try a shotgun type approach. So we've seen sushi swap, for instance. Where are they going to deploy sushi swap? They're going to deploy everywhere and let the market pick kind of who wins.
02:08:49.666 - 02:09:07.754, Speaker A: Uniswap has decided to go with one specific solution, at least so far, and that is optimism and optimistic roll ups. Can you talk about why? And maybe there's a values discussion here, maybe there's an engineering discussion. I'm not sure what the discussion is, but why?
02:09:07.952 - 02:09:47.880, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that there is a values thing here. It's not hard to scale Ethereum. If you don't care about the values of Ethereum, you just sacrifice decentralization. You do it every time and you've scaled Ethereum every time. And so what's really hard is scaling Ethereum, or scaling Ethereum without sacrificing what matters, which is decentralization, censorship, resistance, permissionless, trustless, all these things. And doing that is hard and it takes time and it requires focus and this sort of shotgun approach of like, oh, I'm going to deploy anywhere. I don't know.
02:09:47.880 - 02:10:45.420, Speaker C: We don't see any benefit to deploying on a more centralized version of Ethereum because that doesn't really add to what Uniswap is and it doesn't extend what uniswap is capable of doing. It kind of sacrifices what Uniswap is capable of doing to kind of make it able to support higher volume or something. And so I think that what we're really excited about optimistic rollups and exploring with optimism is how do we scale Ethereum as Ethereum is today? How do we kind of allow for more participants, more lower fees, higher throughput, while retaining the security of ethereum while keeping the permissionless nature of it? And that's a long, hard project. Right. No one has done that. Mean they have, they're very scaling solutions, but no one has scaled defi yet. Right.
02:10:46.350 - 02:11:15.022, Speaker A: Can I ask you a question on this, Hayden? Because this is an important question to me. Do you think users care? Right? So I care. The bankless community cares. Decentralization matters, trustlessness matters. But the counterargument to all of that that's been put to us is that at the end of the day, Hayden, users just want to trade. They'll go where the liquidity is. They don't care about trustlessness and permissionlessness and decentralization.
02:11:15.022 - 02:11:20.806, Speaker A: The way you're talking about it and the way we talk about it at bankless, will users care about this?
02:11:20.988 - 02:11:54.850, Speaker C: I think that users don't care until they have to care. Users don't care until that shit goes down. Users don't care until users don't care until their transaction is reverted or their funds are locked. Right. Users don't care until right up until the moment that they're forced to care. And by then it's too late. And so the important thing to note is that we've always known that more centralized systems will continue to have a very broad user base until decentralized systems are able to scale better.
02:11:54.850 - 02:12:31.102, Speaker C: And so it doesn't bother me that binance chain exists and gets volume. I don't see any difference between binance and binance chain. And the exchange applications on binance chain pancake swap doesn't seem any different from binance to me. It's like the same people running the same servers. You know what mean? Like, yeah, people don't care and people do go to binance, and that's fine, because right now it costs a lot of money to make a trade on Uniswap, and we don't want that. And we're going to do the work to scale Uniswap. And the community will do the work with us, and the community will also.
02:12:31.102 - 02:13:21.382, Speaker C: But the point is that an optimism will do the work. But the point is that unless we're able to scale what matters, which is the decentralization, there's nothing else. Nothing else really matters. My goal for Uniswap is not to be the highest volume centralized exchange in the world. My goal for Uniswap is to be a decentralized trading platform and to stay that way. And so there is kind of this one other aspect of the fragmentation versus using one solution to start with is kind of just like a focus thing, which is like we've always taken the approach of doing one thing the best way possible, rather than trying to do everything at once. And so what is kind of, I think, negatively, Uniswap is still using a science.
02:13:21.382 - 02:14:07.498, Speaker C: We're still just pushing the boundaries in the envelope on this sort of one very simple idea that started with Uniswap V one. And nothing has really changed in the kind of vision, nothing's really changed in the kind of goals or what it does it's just getting better. And the goal is to kind of continue on that approach and get the best version of this thing. And deploying it in 50 different places, to me feels like saying, oh, we've kind of finished with what this thing is and now we're just going to try to put it everywhere. But there's no point in putting it on 50 different chains. None of them is better than if there's no best version of it. We want to create the sort of actual best l two experience for Uniswap V three and putting it on 50 bits different places won't do that.
02:14:07.498 - 02:14:22.254, Speaker C: I don't think being able to kind of concentrate and focus and build one thing properly seems like the right approach and it's a hard, long, difficult task, but it's entirely doable and we're quite excited for it.
02:14:22.452 - 02:14:56.458, Speaker B: My personal answer for this is that it's easier to make people care about Ethereum's values if we build the technology that helps facilitate it. And I see that being built with Uniswap, I see that being built with optimism. All of a sudden it's not hard to scale Ethereum's values because of these applications that are being built. Hayden, optimism isn't that far away. Could you perhaps tell a user story of what it's like to trade what you think it may be like to trade on Uniswap when Uniswap is deployed on optimism and available to everyone?
02:14:56.624 - 02:15:57.470, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that, first off, it's worth noting that the general roadmap for optimistic roll ups is to progressively scale in a way that aligns very nicely with the Ethereum roadmap. And so it can scale maybe ten x, maybe 100 x, whatever it is, just on e one as it is today. But sort of as sharding comes out, that has a multiplicative effect on optimistic roll ups. And so it's worth noting that it's not going to be like an overnight day one complete. Well, first off, it will be like a massive order of magnitude improvement overnight, but it's not going to be like the end all be all, and there will be a steady process of improvement and iteration moving forward. Probably the biggest difference from the start on optimistic roll up is you're going to have instant transaction confirmations where you sort of have this kind of economic guarantee your transaction will be included in a block or someone will lose a lot of money somewhere. Basically the person kind of the sequencer, essentially.
02:15:57.470 - 02:17:20.118, Speaker C: So basically being able to right now there's sort of this really negative UX of I submit a transaction, it might take 30 seconds, it might take 2 minutes, might take 5 minutes, or maybe I'm a user who didn't set the gas properly and it's never going to ever execute right. And so having this ability to have an instant like you click it and then immediately you kind of have this ability to immediately know whether or not your transaction is going to be included, especially for smaller value transactions. Maybe if you're sending $20 million or something, you're going to want to wait for that to be posted to ETh L1 in a few blocks. There's always this kind of the same way that on Ethereum layer one, if you send a billion dollars, you're not going to be satisfied after one block, you're going to be satisfied after x amount of blocks. And so there's still that kind of aspect of it. But for people doing sort of smaller trades, you're going to have this really awesome ux of just instant transaction confirmation, which is going to be really awesome. And then we're definitely expecting massive reductions in fees, although we're also expecting a massive increase in usage to the point where it's not going to be like if we can do ten times more transactions, it's not going to be a 10th of the gas cost because we're probably going to have a lot more trading that goes along with that, and it's going to make maybe even smaller arbitrages more profitable and people are going to be doing much smaller trades and there'll be a lot more activity, but definitely like lower gas costs.
02:17:20.118 - 02:17:29.898, Speaker C: Instant confirmations are the two probably biggest. And then over time that will continue to get scaled up with the broader Ethereum scaling roadmap, I think it's going.
02:17:29.904 - 02:18:26.410, Speaker A: To be an exciting few months. And what's interesting to note is how successful Uniswap has been on Ethereum mainnet, in spite of some of these UX challenges and wondering as it enters this new landscape whether it can be even more successful elsewhere. Last thing on all of this, Uniswap now has a larger treasury than the Ethereum foundation. If you sort of aggregate all the Uni tokens and the value of that, and uni governance sort of governs over all of that. Right now you were talking about values of decentralization and trustlessness. Hayden, do you see Uniswap and the governors of this treasury as being sort of stewards for decentralization in a similar way that the EF has been a steward for decentralization? We've heard Vitalik and the EF talk about these values. We're hearing Uniswap talk about these values.
02:18:26.410 - 02:18:29.566, Speaker A: Do you accept that mantle or that role in any way?
02:18:29.748 - 02:19:03.770, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I'd say that. Not me personally, but I'd say that in general, the goal for this governance system is to kind of continue on with the sort of values of Ethereum and the values of decentralization. What we don't want to see is all the treasury funds going to early whales who provide the most liquidity in the first year of its existence. Right. We're trying to think about this. What should this look like? Two years, three years, five years? We always try to be forward looking. We're not trying to compete against Uniswap, we're competing against the future.
02:19:03.770 - 02:19:53.210, Speaker C: And we're preparing in terms of how Uniswap sort of, or at least how I see Uniswap's role. And so definitely what's been really exciting from the treasury, right, is the only thing that the treasury has done so far is fund developers and community members building value and growing the ecosystem. Right. The sort of main thing that has passed so far is this grants committee, which has now funded I think, like 25, 26 different community projects and hackathons and developers. And I think that that's sort of an early look at what I personally hope is to come. I mean, in part, we're going to just see it's sort of up to the community on how it wants to evolve over time. We might see things happen that I've never anticipated.
02:19:53.210 - 02:20:29.750, Speaker C: But what would excite me the most is to see the treasury go towards kind of bringing value to the ecosystem, to growing the ecosystem, to building out value that sort of benefits everyone, to help kind of build this more fair, more decentralized financial system that we're kind of all in the Ethereum community rooting for. That's kind of what I view as the goal of governance. And so that might be why it kind of seems to function a little bit differently from other projects, which maybe focus more on short term user acquisition.
02:20:33.370 - 02:21:19.140, Speaker B: Anyway, Hayden, as we come to the close of this conversation, and again, thank you for coming on to the bankless podcast and giving us your time, I want to zoom out and kind of just touch on the moral of the story that we've been dancing around for this entire podcast. Uniswap seems to be just a beloved application of both deep Ethereum researchers, crypto economic tinkerers, developers, but also just the broader community and users of Ethereum. And even by the outside world, the people who don't yet understand crypto and Ethereum, but they've heard of Uniswap and they think it's cool to you. What are the reasons as to why Uniswap has found itself to be in such a beloved position by such a wide swath of community members?
02:21:19.910 - 02:22:15.094, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think that there's a few things that go into that. I think that a big part of it is what we've been talking about, about the values that it sort of espouses and adheres to. In some ways I was talking about early on, it was always about, can we make this follow in the footsteps of Ethereum, espouse the same values as Ethereum and sort of lead by example for applications built on top of Ethereum. By staying true to that, I think that has allowed it to become much more popular within the Ethereum community. I think that sort of the other maybe thing that people really like about Uniswap is what it enables them to right. It kind of unlocks the same way that I was able to build Uniswap, now other people can build all these things on top of it. I wouldn't be able to do what I did without all the massive work that Vitalik did and all the people at the Ethereum foundation and Carl did.
02:22:15.094 - 02:22:58.946, Speaker C: And what Uniswap now does is it enables other people who want to build this decentralized financial system to then build, now they can contribute, and they kind of have this other Lego, the whole money legos narrative that I'm a big fan of. It enables more people to kind of build on top of uniswap and build on top of Ethereum and build new, exciting things. And so I think that adults of all ages love Legos, or people of all ages love legos. And I think that people love the kind of vision that it's working towards. And so personally, that's kind of what I see as what has kind of led to its popularity and success from a social and community standpoint and extending.
02:22:58.978 - 02:23:06.200, Speaker B: That outwards not just about Uniswap, but about Ethereum at large. What do you think the lasting legacy of Ethereum will be upon our.
02:23:08.890 - 02:24:00.458, Speaker C: That I think that we have a vision for it. But I think it's really important to recognize that there's a difference between realizing a vision is really difficult, and it's a long, arduous task that can't be done overnight, and it shouldn't be taken for granted as a guaranteed outcome. And so I think that my hope for Ethereum is that it leads to a fairer, better financial system that empowers more people to participate, helps redistribute wealth to more people. My hope is it leads to a better, fairer world. What I think is a little bit scary to me at times is that people kind of take that for granted as like, oh, if Ethereum succeeds, no matter what, the world will be better. And I think what they mean is like, no matter what, I'll be richer. And I think that that's like a very different thing.
02:24:00.458 - 02:24:31.060, Speaker C: And there is this aspect of the Ethereum community that I do worry about, which is the part of it that doesn't sort of adhere to the values or aren't into it for the values behind it. And I think that it's really important that the people building it kind of stay true to them and continue to promote them. Because I don't know what the legacy of Ethereum will be. I know what I want it to be, and I think that we all have to fight to make that happen.
02:24:32.950 - 02:25:01.494, Speaker A: Well said, sir. We're happy to join you in that fight, certainly on the social layer. Last question for you, Hayden. This may be a fun question. Uniswap has passed so many cool milestones. We talked about maybe the biggest so far, which is exceeding the total trading volume of Coinbase. The next milestone maybe is an order of magnitude higher, something like exceeding the total trading volume of S P or the Nasdaq.
02:25:01.494 - 02:25:04.140, Speaker A: When do you think that happens, if it does at all?
02:25:04.910 - 02:26:13.620, Speaker C: I don't know, two years? It's hard know. Every time I predict two years, it happens in like one. I don't know if it'll be two years, but it could know. There is something insane about how if you just look at how many assets, how many new tokens are created every day, there's about the same amount of tokens created per day as are added in several years to some of these kind of legacy financial trading platforms. I do see a world where that is like a really interesting milestone, where I think it kind of depends on crypto growing and mass adoption of. If there is mass adoption of Ethereum and decentralized finance, and I expect there to be, I definitely have a very strong conviction that decentralized finance will see mass usage and mass adoption as it scales and as the UX improves, which it's doing, and it will take time to get there. But once that happens, once there is mass adoption, I think that the ceiling on what DeFi can do is far greater than the ceiling on what traditional finance can do, right? The milestone might be a thousand x.
02:26:13.620 - 02:26:39.878, Speaker C: What traditional finance can do because of how much more can be done. So yeah, I think that the sky is the limit, but I don't know that it's hard sometimes to predict. Usually when I predict it happens faster, but then you also don't want to predict and be wrong and have it be too soon. But I see this stuff exploding over the next few years for sure. And definitely orders of magnitude increase in users.
02:26:40.054 - 02:26:48.442, Speaker A: Absolutely. Well, we share that optimism. Hayden Adams this has been well worth the wait, sir. Thank you so much for coming on bankless and long live the unicorn.
02:26:48.586 - 02:26:55.298, Speaker C: Thank you. Really appreciate you having me on and maybe next time it won't take two years. Absolutely.
02:26:55.384 - 02:27:19.250, Speaker A: We'll do this again soon. Guys. Resources for you some action items go read the Uniswap birthday blog. That was a post put out by Hayden Adams that goes through the timeline. We used some of that information to compile the timeline for this episode. Also, read the uniswap V three announcement. Those action items will be in the show notes as always, guys, risks and disclaimers eth is risky.
02:27:19.250 - 02:27:30.970, Speaker A: Trading on Uniswap is risky. All of crypto is risky. So is DFI. You could lose what you put in, and that includes if you are a liquidity provider. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone.
02:27:30.970 - 02:27:34.494, Speaker A: But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
