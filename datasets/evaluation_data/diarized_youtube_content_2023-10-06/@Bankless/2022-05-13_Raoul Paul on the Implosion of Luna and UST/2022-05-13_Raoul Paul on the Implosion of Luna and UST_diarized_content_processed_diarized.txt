00:00:00.200 - 00:00:06.745, Speaker B: When you hopped into this recording room, UST price was at 98 cents being defended. Do you know what it is right now?
00:00:06.865 - 00:00:07.617, Speaker A: No, it's.
00:00:07.641 - 00:00:13.641, Speaker B: At $0.92. So that's $1 billion of stablecoin market cap that's gotten a race in the last 30 minutes.
00:00:13.713 - 00:00:25.785, Speaker A: The market's always going to test this stuff. Right. This is what the markets do. You want to test the fragilities. And this is an S curve moment for the entire algorithmic stablecoin idea. I mean all of them have failed so far. So let's see whether they survive it or not.
00:00:25.785 - 00:00:28.881, Speaker A: I hope they do because it would be nice, but it's not. Sure, right?
00:00:28.913 - 00:00:43.269, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you have any opinions on just like the systemic nature of Terra? Because they're using non terra assets like Bitcoin and Avalanche is also in their portfolio to defend the peg. So like the concerns that people are having is that they are going to dump the rest of the market before they have to dump their own assets.
00:00:43.357 - 00:00:57.765, Speaker A: Well, this is the margin call I talked about. Right. It's exactly the same thing. And so what's happened is they're now getting asked for their collateral back. This is what you expect to see at this phase. This is a liquidation phase. And that's when somebody taps you on the shoulder and say, I want your collateral back and you have to sell it.
00:00:57.765 - 00:00:59.205, Speaker A: So in this case, it's the bitcoin.
