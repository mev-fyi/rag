00:00:06.780 - 00:00:11.584, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone, to another episode of State of the Nation. David, how are you doing today?
00:00:11.702 - 00:00:37.864, Speaker B: Absolutely fantastic. I think we have a pretty interesting state of the nation ahead of us. Zero X Mackie from Sushiswap. This will be the first non pseudo anonymous camera off state of the nation that we've ever had, at least with a guest. Our cameras are obviously on, but our guest, Xerox Mackie, he's on standby with his camera off because he's pseudo anonymous. And that's kind of how the sushi swap protocol rolls. So we're going to get a little bit more into that later.
00:00:37.982 - 00:01:02.524, Speaker A: This is going to be a super fascinating episode. I think you're going to learn a lot if this is your first day of the nation. These come out every Tuesday. We try to live stream them on YouTube. Then we put the video up, then we get the podcast out to our podcast listeners. So this is an opportunity for us to relate some of the interesting things that are going on in the bankless nation to big picture stuff. We're going to be getting to that Zero x Machi conversation in just a minute.
00:01:02.524 - 00:01:25.508, Speaker A: But David, we've got some new stuff going on in the bankless nation as well. We had a fantastic episode with Justin Drake that just came out this past Monday. I think it was our most bullish Ethereum episode yet. That's maybe bold to say, but because the topic was cryptography, what were some of your takeaways from this episode?
00:01:25.604 - 00:02:29.080, Speaker B: Yeah, Justin Drake, this was a unique podcast that come out of the Bankless podcast that I think might be my favorite episode that we've ever done so far. It's also our longest. It's a marathon at 2 hours and 20 minutes. And I think what makes this episode so unique was that Justin Drake, who is an Ethereum researcher, by the way, he works for the EF, he's a cryptographer, came to us with this proposal for what he thought would be a really cool episode, and he was totally right. The idea came to him when he heard us do this bullcase for Ethereum, bullcase for ETH series that we did with Eric Connor, Anthony Zazano DC investor and then we had the guys at ETH capital on, and then Justin Drake wanted to introduce what he calls moon math, the bullcase for cryptography. And I think my biggest takeaway, just as a little teaser for what's in that episode, everyone should totally listen to it, is what I'm now calling Drake's Razor, where Justin Drake has two rules of thumb that he lives by that I think this whole entire industry is pinned on. Whereas if you can use cryptography, use cryptography.
00:02:29.080 - 00:02:54.688, Speaker B: But if you can't use cryptography, use crypto economics. And this is of course, in relation to building something, building an app on top of ethereum or actually creating a consensus protocol, like Ethereum itself, Ethereum, the protocol, or anything else in this cryptocurrency industry. Use cryptography if you can, but if you can't, you can use crypto economics. And I think that's going to be a very valuable tool, very relevant to the protocol sync thesis and something that's really a really strong mental model that I got out of that episode.
00:02:54.784 - 00:03:24.080, Speaker A: Yeah. And I was just so struck by how far we've yet to come on the cryptography. Basically, this moon math that you're talking about is basically Moore's law for crypto. And we're just at the very start of this trajectory of crypto innovation. Cryptography innovation, really. And that's going to make all of our blockchain systems that much better. We also have Yanav from the graph who's coming on an AMA community.
00:03:24.080 - 00:03:44.016, Speaker A: Ask me anything this Thursday, 12:00 eastern. So check that out. And Jeremy Alair, our conversation with the CEO of Circle, he is one of the main leaders of USDC, the stablecoin. He came on the podcast. That conversation is coming out Monday. Any takeaways from Jeremy Alair?
00:03:44.048 - 00:04:30.896, Speaker B: David, Jeremy Alair has been at the forefront of what has been an extremely active quarter of crypto regulation. Right. Originally, people always thought that bitcoin is going to be the target of crypto regulation, but bitcoin seems to be kind of getting a pass. And what actually seems to be the target of crypto regulation has been stablecoins, crypto dollars, and primarily USDC. We saw this with the stable act, but then we also saw this with Fincen's guidance on self hosted wallets that is very relevant to stablecoins. And so Jeremy Lair, as the founder behind the USDC crypto dollar, has had to take the brunt of this highly active regulatory environment as it relates to our industry. So we mainly get that perspective out of Jeremy.
00:04:30.896 - 00:04:38.352, Speaker B: But then, of course, we also talk about USDC inside of DeFi, which was a very fun conversation. So stay tuned for that one coming out next to Monday.
00:04:38.496 - 00:05:19.510, Speaker A: Jeremy is bullish Defi. He's bullish Ethereum. Guys, you can hear all about our after the podcast conversation as well. David, we started doing these debrief episodes available for bankless premium subscribers, and that's really an opportunity for you and I, we used to have these discussions all the time after a podcast to actually talk about the podcast that was and do a full debrief of our thoughts. That I think is one of the times I level up the most is those after podcast conversations where we sort of dump our thoughts and our primary takeaways and talk about them. And that's going to be now made available for bankless premium members.
00:05:19.880 - 00:05:59.456, Speaker B: Yeah, I do get a lot of learning out of those conversations, and I'm pretty happy that we are making these conversations available to bankless premium subscribers. One of my favorite things about bankless is that there's two of us, and so we actually get to throw ideas back between each other's because obviously one person can only have one person's ideas. And so these are the times where we sit and reflect upon the podcast that we just had. Literally, as soon as we're done recording a podcast, Ryan and I hop into a Zoom and be like, to make sure it's not stale. Then we hop into a Zoom and hit record. And so that's what those debriefs are 2030 minutes long for the bankless premium subscribers. So if you are interested in those, there is a link in the show notes available to you, so you can go watch those.
00:05:59.558 - 00:06:05.808, Speaker A: All right, David, let's start with the question I ask you for every state of the nation. What is the state of the nation today?
00:06:05.974 - 00:06:38.024, Speaker B: The state of the nation is growing. We are growing the pie. Like, I'm sure you are getting text messages, Ryan. I'm getting text messages about people who are interested in bitcoin, interested in Ethereum, interested in Defi, trying to figure out what this is all about. And of course, people are just throwing money at this industry right now, right? We are not in a scarce environment right now. There is less competition going on. And I think that's kind of why bitcoiners and Ethereum, these ecosystems have generally separated, is because in bear markets, people fight, right? But in bull markets, there's abundance.
00:06:38.024 - 00:07:02.996, Speaker B: There's not much need for fighting. All protocols are receiving basically all the funding that they need to continue. And I see this dynamic, and what this is really relevant to is the Uniswap versus sushi swap conversation. I think a lot of. There's a decent number of people that perhaps have a bad taste in their mouth about sushi swap. From the way that it was spawned, from the way that was birthed into the world. There's this conversation of a vampire attack.
00:07:02.996 - 00:07:15.992, Speaker B: I think we're going to get into the subject when we talk to Mackie. But there's this competitive air about if sushiswap wins, Uniswap loses. No. Or vice versa. Uniswap wins. Or sushiswap uses, like, no. I don't think that's what's going on.
00:07:15.992 - 00:07:36.584, Speaker B: I think this pie that we have, this defi pie, is growing at such an incredibly large rate that the fact that there is both Uniswap and sushiswap, which are maximizing in their own core competencies, illustrates how much abundance there is in this world right now, especially in the world of defi. And so the state of the nation, Ryan, is growing. We are growing.
00:07:36.712 - 00:07:54.064, Speaker A: Absolutely. Well said. I think very often the crypto tragedy sort of get into this trap of thinking that this is a fixed pie, fixed sum game. It's not even within different chains. Bitcoin plus Ethereum. Bitcoin is better because Ethereum exists. Ethereum is better because bitcoin exists.
00:07:54.064 - 00:08:22.028, Speaker A: This is all on ramps from the traditional banking system to this new banking system, and it is all additive. And I think that's what the Sushiswap versus uniswap example really is. Because of Sushiswap's existence, Uniswap is that much better and has that much more volume. David, we're going to get to that in just a minute. But first, we should take a minute to talk about the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:08:22.114 - 00:09:04.852, Speaker B: If you are looking for a product that connects your fiat bank account with Defi tokens and products, you need to download the Dharma mobile app. Dharma is a noncustodial, smart contract wallet and comes with a bridge that connects you right into your bank account. Dharma is the fastest and most efficient wallet between your fiat and your bank account and any token on Uniswap, or even any vault in yearn. With Dharma, you can get over $25,000 per week into the Dfi universe. And you can do it noncustodially. If you or anyone you know is hot on defi and you're trying to get your money into a defi investment, Dharma is the place to go. Signing up and going through KYC is an absolute breeze.
00:09:04.852 - 00:09:41.248, Speaker B: It took me just under three minutes. And after signing into my bank account via plaid, I am now just one transaction away from any token that Uniswap has to offer. Go to ww Dharma. IO. That's D-H-A-R-M-A IO. Download the Dharma app and get yourself unbanked today. If you want to live a bankless life, you need to get a monolith DFI Visa card monolith is both a one two punch of an Ethereum smart contract wallet, as well as an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your Ethereum wallet wherever visa is accepted.
00:09:41.248 - 00:10:32.904, Speaker B: It's really a fantastic tool that lets you use Ethereum for what it does best, which is holding and managing your financial assets, but also keeps you connected to the rest of the world's payment rails. Monolith also offers on ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defi, so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if ever you need to, and your deposited money goes straight into your non custodial wallet, so your money is never held by a centralized intermediary. Because your monolith wallet is native to ethereum, monolith helps you transcend both the legacy and the crypto worlds because the money that you hold in your monolith wallet has the power of defi behind it. Swapping assets on Uniswap or earning yield in Defi is at your fingertips. But with monolith, so are the groceries at your grocery store or the coffee at your coffee shop. Go to monolith XYZ to sign up and get your monolith visa card today.
00:10:33.102 - 00:10:37.364, Speaker A: Welcome to bankless state of the nation. How are you doing today, Ryan?
00:10:37.412 - 00:10:59.650, Speaker C: Hey David, thank you for having me. Just very quick intro. I'm a core contributor to sushiswap. I don't actually code. We have like a CTO and a bunch of core developer helping on this side of things. So really I'm just instrumental in growing the protocol, making sure that the community is tended to, and so on. I'm the one entering pretty much everything.
00:11:00.260 - 00:11:22.424, Speaker A: That is awesome. Well, thank you so much for clarifying. And I think we should start is could you give us some history? So for folks that weren't here, don't remember, for me, Defi Summers was sort of a blur in many ways. Can you give us a history of the project? Like, how did things start? Take us through the story so far.
00:11:22.622 - 00:12:16.420, Speaker C: Yeah, sure, no problem. So we started the end of August with only a medium article, discord. And then we grew to $1.8 billion, I think, in TVL in almost a week or so, which all came from Uniswap LP tokens at first, before we had our first migration to our own set of smart contracts that were basically a fork of the Uniswap ones. And all of this was made by chef Nomi, which was one of the trigo founders back then, including me and Sushiswap chef. So this is kind of how we got started. The goal were very clear from the beginning it was going to be a community led fork of Uniswap.
00:12:16.420 - 00:12:58.688, Speaker C: And then it kind of grew into this massive, I guess, protocol and umbrella under an open model that was pioneered by yarn, wi fi, and so on. So this is kind of where we started, and since then, we kind of keep iterating. We have been funding some teams to work on multiple projects that are in the same ecosystem as sushi. So we have bentobox, we have gusoku, we have miso, and so on. All of these are added by different teams of developers. Some of them are more supported by the core team than others, and so on. So this is.
00:12:58.688 - 00:13:59.800, Speaker C: It's pretty simple. I've been like a fervent Ethereum community member since I would say, early 2017 or so, before the big ico mania. I got interested back to crypto after, I guess, being dormant for three, four years, and then I discovered Ethereum and all of the possibilities of smart contract. And from there, I've always wanted to join the ecosystem, the community, but never really had any, how can I say, experience in the field. So it was very hard for me to get the confidence to basically take ownership and go on and just send some resume, et cetera. So I just never participated until I kind of saw sushiswap. And I've always wanted to contribute to uniswap and kind of the dex field.
00:13:59.800 - 00:14:03.070, Speaker C: So I took ownership and I just rolled with.
00:14:06.640 - 00:14:55.744, Speaker A: Yeah, what would you say? Some folks over Defi summer have kind of a bad taste left in their mouth still with sushi swap. I think part of it was initially the birth, the genesis of sushiswap. Some called it kind of a vampire attack of this other defi darling, which is uniswap. I would love for you to talk about that. And then also kind of the second event that happened is chef nomi. And maybe describe that, because I have still a lingering taste and bad taste in my mouth from, I guess, probably the chef nomi event. Can you talk about what happened there and its impact in kind of the history and trajectory of sushiswap?
00:14:55.892 - 00:15:41.296, Speaker C: Yeah, no problem. I mean, we can keep it. Very simply, the fact that we call it an attack when back then, uniswap at maybe $250,000,000 in TVL is pretty, I think, ridiculous. A lot of people got introduced to being an LP because of this whole kind of liquidity mining phase and craze et cetera. So calling it an attack is kind of really, I think, meaningless in a way. I think it was just like we unlocked for the first time an amount of liquidity and assets that were dormant in the ecosystem. And this is what is bringing so much, I would say, attention to the space in the ecosystem.
00:15:41.296 - 00:16:25.604, Speaker C: We basically were able to grow more in one month than the entire year of 2020 with all these incentives and kind of teaching people, newcomers, how to LP for the first time. Before that, you were only, like, putting some assets and they were, quote unquote, giving you tokens. Now we were actually lping, and this had this tremendous impact of changing the game. Right. We went from 500 million to $1 billion locked in DFI to today we're at $26 billion. And I think we're on track to 100 million by the end of the year. And how do you do this? You bring new people to the ecosystem.
00:16:25.604 - 00:16:30.810, Speaker C: You make sure that they are able to easily earn yield on their assets and productivize them.
00:16:31.340 - 00:16:47.708, Speaker A: So Mackie David stated, the nation this week was growing the pie, and you really feel like Sushiswap did that. Not only for DeFi, but also for Uniswap. It brought more volume and value to the Defi ecosystem and also to uniswap.
00:16:47.884 - 00:17:20.920, Speaker C: Yeah, what happened is we were able to not only, I guess, make them launch a token to actually be open and governed by the community, but we were also able to make sure that these people were incentivized to provide liquidity. So what we did is the biggest gift an LP could have wished for in a very long time. And this is kind of what I am kind of spare eating here. It's not about just like, oh, it's a fork, or it's not a fork. It's all about making sure that lps are taken care of. It's not just a 0.3% fee going to them anymore.
00:17:20.920 - 00:18:22.364, Speaker C: I think we're going to be seeing a lot of innovation coming on this side of things where capital is going to be not just more efficient, but capital is going to be more smart, capital strategies to deploy capital is going to be with less risk, less impermanent loss or divergence loss, whatever you want to call it. And yeah, this is kind of it for nomi, I think very quickly brief on the subject, because it's been quite some time and he's not involved anymore in the project. I think there was some inflammatory, I guess, toxic comments being made and thrown around on Twitter. Everyone was all bit. We said Florida poo in French so I would say everything was tense back then and we are past this. I don't think his actions were to praise at all, but everyone kind of was under pressure. He cracked it a little bit and here we are.
00:18:22.364 - 00:18:26.700, Speaker C: Now it's past us and we can make sure that this is community owned.
00:18:29.940 - 00:18:33.250, Speaker A: Project. He's gone, but the community is marching on. Right?
00:18:34.340 - 00:18:57.688, Speaker C: Exactly. And I do think that the fact that this project succeed, even though that we had like, I guess this first incident, it just makes sushiswap stronger every time along the steps. Right? We are improving. We have difficulties all the time, but we are making sure to fix the problem that we have on our way and so on.
00:18:57.854 - 00:19:18.880, Speaker A: I want to go back to your comment, Mackie, about Uniswap. Uniswap, of course, famously airdropped a token to its users in September. How much of their decision to Airdrop do you think was because of Sushiswap?
00:19:20.580 - 00:20:05.872, Speaker C: I don't know about the decision to airdrop. I think it was like a very good marketing stunt. I think it kind of made sure to align incentives for people that used the project before and to guarantee that some of the, I guess, most fervent Uniswap, LP and believer would have a say in the protocol. You don't give like 1000 token to Sox holder for fun, right? You want to have the most dirt fan of your protocol being able to have a meaningful voice. And I think this was great. I don't really agree with how the governance has been kind of blocked or the requirements were very strict at first. They are in a different legal landscape than us.
00:20:05.872 - 00:20:10.130, Speaker C: They are based in the US. So I do understand all the ramification there.
00:20:12.660 - 00:20:26.340, Speaker A: So bottom line is though, you think that the birth of Sushiswap brought some competitive pressures to Uniswap even, and provided more benefits for both Uniswap users and their lps?
00:20:27.640 - 00:20:29.110, Speaker C: I do think so, yeah.
00:20:31.260 - 00:21:26.360, Speaker B: There's a very interesting story here because Uniswap got off to this very rocky start. And I am personally convinced that the vampire attack was less of an attack and more of a value add. Yet that was the branding. And then on top of the branding of the attack on Uniswap, there was the chef Nomi that took the dev fund and ran. That's behind us. Sushiswap has turned into this pillar of a community and has kind of led the charge into seeing what can really be done when you have a bottom up community take control over a project and turn it into something awesome. And so now the branding behind Sushiswap has nothing to do know chef Nomi or the vampire attack, and it's now something that I would say is largely differentiated.
00:21:26.360 - 00:21:50.610, Speaker B: Could you describe the process that Sushiswap went through to get to this point? People thought, including me, that Sushiswap was dead in the three months defi bear market between Defi Summer and where we are now. Yet that was the opposite of the case. Maybe you can tell us the story of how sushi swap came to be into what it is now.
00:21:50.980 - 00:22:19.556, Speaker C: I think it's very easy, David. There's always someone to enter at Sushi, like whether you want to be building. We will help you. We will give you a grant if the work has been done and so on. We will always support efforts of people that are willing to do partnership. You have some issues with Uniswap in itself, then you can fix it at Sushi and it's going to be implemented and pushed. Granted that it passed all the security, the workflow.
00:22:19.556 - 00:23:05.050, Speaker C: But what is very important is pretty much we were able to get like a diehard community of builder and people that resonated with this ethos of actually community led, where actions and votes are accessible to anyone. This is kind of what made us very different. We have a very clear token value to accurate value to the token. I mean, the rules are very simple, and it's just how we were able to grow, I think, is by collaborating with other protocols, making sure that our dev designer or else are tended to and so on. This is just the key. It's collaboration. It's being open.
00:23:05.050 - 00:23:32.130, Speaker C: We're not like a team. We're not based in a single country or city. There's a lot of hurdles to this. And the way we work as an open can be very messy. But once you get inside this discord, once you get inside the talking the forums, you kind of realize that there is actually a soul into this project. There's a community that loves what we're doing. And I think this is why we were able to come back from this bear market.
00:23:33.060 - 00:23:41.140, Speaker B: So what would you say is Sushiswap's core competencies? What are the things that it's good at that really differentiates itself from Uniswap?
00:23:43.000 - 00:24:24.156, Speaker C: We're very good at many things. I would say, first of all, we are always improving, I guess everything related to the UI, even if we started with three different ones, it was super messy at first. We're starting to unify all of this together into something that is more easy. We were able to get integration with partners that were not able to get on Uniswap for months because they had no support. So we're providing a wide glove service to all the projects with our core dev. This is just like what we are good at right now. We're also very open minded on other alternatives on the blockchain.
00:24:24.156 - 00:25:00.728, Speaker C: So we're thinking about cross chain swaps on Ethereum, powered by torchain. We're thinking about going on Polkadot with Moonbeam and so on. We even have a grant right now for moving to the serum ecosystem, not moving any liquidity, but literally opening new branches where assets can be swapped on other chains. And I think this is very important, because if you're not, I guess, open to other communities and bridge them together, then what is the point of being community led and so close minded?
00:25:00.904 - 00:25:24.580, Speaker B: I think that fits into the conversation of where we wanted to take this, because I think one of the differentiators between Sushiswap and Uniswap is that Sushiswap has developers that talk to other projects, famously wiren and urine, I think is actually the correct pronunciation. Amaki, maybe you could talk about the relationship between sushiswap and urine.
00:25:26.200 - 00:26:31.224, Speaker C: Yeah, the urine ecosystem is very fascinating. It's really just a group of individuals with the same values, I think we're talking about decentralization, we're talking about open, we're talking about fervent developers, like people that are intense in everything that they do. And we are able to kind of leverage each other competencies and basically help each other. It's just like an alliance, in a way, where we all get together to work and we make sure to execute on the same pace. Right now, I can tell you for a fact that we are swamped with things to do, so it can be very difficult. But every month, I think, or so every two weeks, we have these inter team calls where we can make sure that we're on pace, on partnership, collaboration and so on. And it has been wonderful to see cream, pickle, acro, yarn, all of these wonderful projects, in my opinion, kind of slowly uniting into something.
00:26:31.422 - 00:27:29.660, Speaker A: So we've kind of seen this pattern, maki, I think, before in crypto, right? So you have sort of almost your first mover, and then you have your fast mover, right? So in the crypto bank world, you have Coinbase, first mover, and then you have binance, which is fast mover. And then in the decentralized lending world, you have compound, which is kind of first mover, and they're a bit more slow and cautious. And then you have aave, which is like all the assets. We're going to try flash loans, we're going to build all of these new things. We're going to embrace assets that compound doesn't. First we're going to push the bleeding edge a bit more. Is that the right dichotomy, would you say, with the difference between a uniswap and a sushi swap? Now that uniswap is kind of first mover, whereas sushi swap is trying to be a fast mover that's a bit more embracing of things that might be cutting edge.
00:27:32.640 - 00:28:20.332, Speaker C: It's a good economy or analogy. I don't think it's fair to say that we're kind of the fast mover of uniswap because I do believe that they right now are that work, working on some groundbreaking innovation and so on. We are really just like trying to do our own path from now on and we're going to capitalize on composability and flexibility of things. I don't know if you've. Maybe we're going to talk about this later for what is coming up for sushi, but we're trying to bridge different world at the moment. We want to make sure that the DeFi can access retail and the centralized exchange of this world to make sure that DeFi can grow even bigger. We do have also other plans for scalability and so on, but maybe we can talk more about this later.
00:28:20.332 - 00:28:26.610, Speaker C: The fast mover, it would say that Uniswap is not moving, and I think that's not fair.
00:28:27.700 - 00:28:43.620, Speaker B: How would you differentiate the sushi asset between the uni asset? How would you characterize how uniswap the protocol leverages and uses its uni, the asset? And then how would you compare that to how sushi leverages sushi, the asset?
00:28:46.680 - 00:29:29.252, Speaker C: I think uni is just a type of sushi, personally. I think they will try to at some point get some value accrual to the token. Otherwise, I don't really see the value in just a pure governance token that votes and the way that's been distributed and so on. It's very hard to get to this tipping point for voting and proposing and so on. I do know they're using compound contract, right? So they can in theory ask for more vote. But it's still very complicated. I think the IG sushi, or like the sushi in itself is not just attracting fees from the AMM too.
00:29:29.252 - 00:29:54.410, Speaker C: This is kind of part of the strategy. It's going to be coming from multiple products under the same umbrella. I think that's one of the key differentiation. Unless Uniswap starts to expand over the Amm realm, it's always going to be very two different products. The goal is the same, it's governance. But we're also paying our token holders. We are giving.
00:29:55.440 - 00:30:56.476, Speaker A: Oh, go ahead. Yeah, sorry, Maki. I don't want to box you in again with another kind of pattern or dichotomy, but I'm about to try another one on you. So it seems like there's also another dichotomy with DeFi protocols in that you get for a similar market, you get one protocol that is kind of US based, has Silicon Valley type investment or traditional venture investment, and then you get another protocol that is outside of the US. Outside of traditional us legal apparatus, not necessarily venture funded, more bottom up community. So again, an ave versus compound kind of comes to mind, right? Or like a maker versus synthetics. Do you think the fact that your founders are pseudo anonymous outside of the US, does that give you more flexibility in terms of the things you can build? We were just talking about value accrual to sushi.
00:30:56.476 - 00:31:05.100, Speaker A: The token. Does that even give you more flexibility to design a higher value accrual token? What are the benefits there in your approach?
00:31:05.260 - 00:31:37.720, Speaker C: Yeah, I do think that is beneficial and instrumental in the success of sushi. This is kind of tricky. I don't know why the US government is so constraining all this innovation. Blockchain. What we're seeing is like most of these teams are now outside of the US for going to blockchain hub like Singapore, Taiwan, and in Europe like Portugal and so on. It's just going to keep going this way because we want a future that is bankless. We want a future that is decentralized.
00:31:37.720 - 00:31:54.530, Speaker C: And what happened is you are risking prison to build, I guess, the future of finance in the US, so might as well just leave. But this is part of why we were anonymous. This is kind of the reason.
00:31:59.000 - 00:32:41.292, Speaker B: Mackie. I want to ask questions about V two. And of course, if there's going to be something similar to Uniswap's plans to v two, or if sushi has their own plans to v two, we're going to get into that topic of conversation. But first, we're going to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. If you are looking for a product that connects your fiat bank account with DFI tokens and products, you need to download the Dharma mobile app. Dharma is a noncustodial smart contract wallet and comes with a bridge that connects you right into your bank account. Dharma is the fastest and most efficient wallet between your fiat in your bank account and any token on Uniswap, or even any vault in yearn.
00:32:41.292 - 00:33:20.750, Speaker B: With Dharma, you can get over $25,000 per week into the DfI universe, and you can do it noncustodially. If you or anyone you know is hot on defi and you're trying to get your money into a defi investment, Dharma is the place to go. Signing up and going through KYC is an absolute breeze. It took me just under three minutes, and after signing into my bank account via Plaid, I am now just one transaction away from any token that Uniswap has to offer. Go to ww Dharma IO. That's D-H-A-R-M-A IO. Download the Dharma app and get yourself unbanked today.
00:33:20.750 - 00:34:18.844, Speaker B: If you want to live a bankless life, you need to get a monolith DFI Visa card monolith is both a one two punch of an Ethereum smart contract wallet, as well as an accompanying Visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your Ethereum wallet wherever Visa is accepted. It's really a fantastic tool that lets you use Ethereum for what it does best, which is holding and managing your financial assets, but also keeps you connected to the rest of the world's payment rails. Monolith also offers on ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defi. So it's trivial to top up your monolith card if ever you need to, and your deposited money goes straight into your non custodial wallet. So your money is never held by a centralized intermediary. Because your monolith wallet is native to Ethereum, monolith helps you transcend both the legacy and the crypto worlds, because the money that you hold in your monolith wallet has the power of defi behind it. Swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in defi is at your fingertips.
00:34:18.844 - 00:35:09.200, Speaker B: But with monolith, so are the groceries at your grocery store or the coffee at your coffee shop. Go to monolith XYz to sign up and get your monolith visa card today. All right, guys, we are back with zero X Mackie from the sushi swap protocol. We want to ask about l two s, and everyone in the DFI world is kind of having their one eye on Uniswap because we know Uniswap is working very hard to pioneer their own l two. Hopefully, it's fantastic, and we want to ask about Sushi's plans for l two s. Is sushi just looking towards Uniswap? Kind of like how the rest of us are about what their plans are for getting onto an l two? Or are you guys kind of carving your own path? And if you are, what is that path to exchanging on an l two so users can save on gas fees?
00:35:10.980 - 00:35:55.176, Speaker C: Sure. So, very quickly, I do think that L2 for 2021 are going to be massive. I think we're going to see for the first time, real adoption of this tech because we're getting to a moment where they are going to be better enough to power, like EMM and so on. But besides that, I don't think we're going to be rushing to release on this tech. We're like right now exploring all of our options with ZK roll ups, arbitram, Starquare, ZK sync, and so on. The thing is, we want to make sure that if we do move onto a L2, we don't just move by ourselves. We don't want to just be able to do swaps.
00:35:55.176 - 00:36:56.988, Speaker C: If we move somewhere we want to bring with us, like a money market, is it going to be cream ave? Is it going to be other options? This is all in the talks. I think that if we were to move with five participants from the urine ecosystem at the same time, this would be way more interesting than just by ourselves, because then the users are not constrained to just doing swaps. But then we don't want to forget about composability. I think this is one of the most crucial aspects of Defi, is that we want to make sure that people are not locked, I would say, or they cannot do what is fun with all these protocols and collaborating. So once this is cleared up, then we're going to be announcing what we do for the L2 part scalability. And I do think this is something that is six months away, in my opinion.
00:36:57.164 - 00:37:16.568, Speaker A: So, Maki, do you have any guesses on how this will play out? Because there is an element to what you're talking about with the move to L2, or even you were talking about kind of a multi chain world. There is some loss of composability, there is some liquidity silos that start to form. So how is this all going to play out in your mind? Do you have any scenarios you can paint for us?
00:37:16.734 - 00:38:25.356, Speaker C: I mean, from what I saw, the siloing of assets and so on between optimistic, sorry, and other L2 are going to be kind of not too impacted by that. I've seen like connects network has been working on bridging L2s together. I do think that we're going to see more and more of this sort of initiative, because if the assets are trapped there or frozen there, there's going to be massive gains for people that are able to bridge them. So I don't think it's going to happen or maybe just at the beginning and then we're going to find solutions. But aside from that, I'm not a specialist of L2 personally, so I won't pronounce myself too heavily on this topic, but I'm just very happy to see the innovation that it's going to bring to the table on the side of the user experience are going to be totally different. I think we're not going to have to care about gas anymore. And this was, I think, the missing piece for Ethereum to another competitor.
00:38:25.356 - 00:38:50.464, Speaker C: Everyone was kind of screaming scalability and how cheap their transaction were on other chains. This is going to kill this notion, in my opinion. And this is when other blockchains, if they really have a community or like a soul, that's where they're going to create their own interesting feature, because otherwise everyone's going to move to Ethereum.
00:38:50.592 - 00:39:15.630, Speaker A: Yeah. So what do you think about that? So you mentioned earlier that part of what sushi is doing is actually branching out or playing with other chains too. Like you mentioned the Polkadot ecosystem, for example. How do you think that plays out with Ethereum? Are the ETH killers going to kill eth? Will they carve out a different niche in the ecosystem? Will they all compete? Will they all be one big happy family? What's your take on this?
00:39:16.160 - 00:39:58.248, Speaker C: I think they're just going to be doing their own things, like similar to what sushiswap is doing with this whole uni vs. I think they're just going to be building their own kind of solutions on defi blocks and so on and so on. If they don't, then it's just going to die, simply put. And you cannot just take whatever is happening on Ethereum and just mirror it somewhere else and then assume that people are just going to move. That's not how it works. They need to invent their own groundbreaking things, I think. And on Polkadot, I'm kind of fairly certain that some innovation is going to be in crypto and blockchain, et cetera.
00:39:58.248 - 00:40:10.764, Speaker C: It's always the people. We don't have a million dev yet. And if you don't have a strong community of developers, of community advocates and so on, then it's worthless.
00:40:10.892 - 00:40:21.540, Speaker A: Okay, so you mentioned Polkadot. Are there any other ecosystems that you are impressed with as kind of layer one ecosystems?
00:40:21.960 - 00:40:47.576, Speaker C: I haven't looked at all of them personally. So I would say all I'm missing right now is binance, smart chain, atom. I haven't looked it up. All the ghost chain, I don't care. So not interested in the rest. I would say these two are kind of the main ones. And what is very important with us, it's something with a bridge.
00:40:47.576 - 00:40:52.172, Speaker C: If we cannot have a bridge back to ethereum, then we don't care, basically.
00:40:52.306 - 00:41:16.304, Speaker A: Got it. All right, so ethereum possibly as sort of a settlement layer, certainly a central hub to all of this innovation, but other chains possibly playing a role as well. Can you talk a bit more about the sushi swap roadmap? You've got a v two coming up. You mentioned something called Bento box earlier. Tell us what's in store for the next releases of sushi swap.
00:41:16.432 - 00:41:58.524, Speaker C: So what is very interesting is right now we are like finishing up the formal verification for bento box. This is going to be huge. I think this is going to be our kind of margin solution on top of sushi. So we are going to be enabling long and short leverage, basically, on any single pair that is on sushi. And we're going to be partnering with a lot of participants to make sure that this is a very popular product. I would say in a way where the Iron bank can be instrumental there we can have strategies with urine and so on. This is going to be, in my opinion, like the next step in sushi swap.
00:41:58.524 - 00:43:18.044, Speaker C: And then the AMMV two is going to be very interesting because this is when we're going to be able to unlock more flexibility. And we are talking about the pair composition, the fee structure for pools. One of the key thing of the mirror and update, I think, is going to be the franchise pool aspect where we are trying to make sure that, I would say c five can happen, but in a way where they are connected with us. So they will be able, in theory, for binance user to, let's say provide liquidity on sushi swap with a franchise pool if finance is interested, and so on. This is the goal, like exchange, are going to be able to set their own fee and then provide, I guess, the abstraction for the user to not even play with metamask and so on. Personally, I prefer the fact that people have ownership of their assets and everything and are self sovereign, but this is not for everyone. I cannot get my dad and mom to buy sushi on sushi swap at the moment, they won't be able to understand all of this dimension and they just want a very similar experience to, I guess, their bank account.
00:43:18.162 - 00:43:20.892, Speaker A: Yeah, they want the training wheels on.
00:43:20.946 - 00:43:21.164, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:21.202 - 00:43:57.880, Speaker A: And look, all of us started on an exchange. Our first step was to get fiat into crypto, so we all started on an exchange. What you're talking about sounds similar to something David and I talk about often, which is the protocol sync thesis, which is the idea as well, that many of these exchanges will start using DeFi protocols as build on top of them. Essentially use DeFi protocols as their base layer. But how hard or easy is it for a centralized exchange, like a binance, for example, to tap into the liquidity in Sushiswap right now? Can they do it without your permission?
00:43:58.380 - 00:44:23.730, Speaker C: Yeah, they could do it without our permission, but I do think that they want some assistance. They want a wide glove experience. They want developers that can support them in their efforts. They want to make sure everything is secure. There's all this compliance aspect also to keep in mind all the time and so on, that we are trying to mitigate in a way. Right. Want to make sure there is no issues with this on this front.
00:44:23.730 - 00:44:59.580, Speaker C: Defi, as you may know, is very prone to attacks and so on exploits. So there's always risk. There's also this part where impermanent loss is real and we wouldn't want a user to lose their assets or incur losses if you are a very interesting API and so on. That's why we saw X sushi happening on centralized exchange more and more, because it is pretty much quote unquote without any risk of downside.
00:45:01.040 - 00:45:01.452, Speaker A: Right.
00:45:01.506 - 00:45:16.610, Speaker C: So this is kind of the approach, I would say. And yeah, that's one part of the whole roadmap. I mean, I could go on. I've written a very extensive medium article about.
00:45:18.020 - 00:45:30.420, Speaker A: Well, we will link that medium article in the show notes. Maki, one other thing you mentioned when you were going over the high level, there is something called the Iron bank. Sounds super cool. What is the Iron bank?
00:45:31.400 - 00:45:59.840, Speaker C: So the Iron bank is going to be part of the new update from cream, like the upgrade from cream. It's going to be a way for protocol to leverage liquidity without any collateral. So that means if you are in need of massive amount of tokens, or else you can just borrow it without any guarantees on the other side. Right. You don't need to show that you will use the fund in a good way.
00:45:59.910 - 00:46:09.510, Speaker A: So this is the idea of collateral without a collateralized loan this is a credit based type of loan. How are they able to do that?
00:46:10.120 - 00:46:48.656, Speaker C: I mean, I would love for you to have Leo perhaps on the show and explaining all of this from top to bottom. It is very interesting. And since Andre shared the post about it and the cream team, it was kind of mind blowing, because this is going to be enabling a totally different, I would say not primitive, but different way of thinking about liquidity and so on. You are not just bounded by what, I guess the people are providing to your smart contract. So this enables things like 100 x leverage, for example, or things like that.
00:46:48.758 - 00:47:25.710, Speaker A: Wow, we're definitely going to have to dig into that a bit more on bankless. Can we talk about a bit more about your future roadmap compared to Uniswap? So Uniswap is launching their v three sometime soon. There's a lot of hype. Don't know exactly what's going to be in that v three. It seems like sushi swap is kind of. It started as a fork of Uniswap, but now it's going its own direction. Are you going to fork Uniswap V three at all, or take any of their ideas? Or is sushi swap basically on its own trajectory now?
00:47:26.480 - 00:48:03.210, Speaker C: I mean, we're very open to pretty much everything that is going on in this space. And if Uniswap was to evolve into or innovate in a way that is groundbreaking, I don't see why everyone in the ecosystem wouldn't kind of get inspired. But for us, I think we're past this forking phase. That was essential in, I guess, bootstraping the treasury, bootstraping the community, the product. But now we are well funded in the treasury. At the moment, as we speak, we have more than $100 million. Right.
00:48:03.210 - 00:48:52.628, Speaker C: With all of this being controlled by the community, we're able to pretty much build anything that we wish. We have built an amazing team. I think on the technical front, we still need to hire many people on the more ops design and so on. And we're kind of setting up ourselves for blazing our own path, basically not forking their code, like, just making sure we've shared our own roadmap. We're working with very different approach. Jeff, a friend that I've spoken with very recently told us that sushi is similar to a bazaar, and Uniswap is a catalydrol where they're not sharing anything that they're working on. I don't know if it's by fear or if it's because they're worried that it is too massive.
00:48:52.628 - 00:49:28.376, Speaker C: I don't know. Maybe it's not ready yet. We have absolutely no pointers. And this is what is infuriating, I guess, with Uniswap is that even if you wanted to help, you are kind of let down, right? You cannot help in any single way. On Sushiswap mindset, we're more like, all right, we are not pretending to be the most knowledgeable people in the world. Everyone is welcome to join. Everyone will be paid extremely generously to help out, and there is absolutely no barrier to entry.
00:49:28.376 - 00:49:37.300, Speaker C: Anyone that wants to get involved will be involved. There's no resume at Sushiswap. It's all based on your output, meritocracy and so on. So that's pretty much.
00:49:37.370 - 00:50:00.990, Speaker A: Yeah, that's fascinating. That also may be a reaction to the advance of sushiswap. It seems like they might be doing keeping things under wrap for competitive reasons. One other thing before we conclude kind of talking about the roadmap is we mentioned this. I don't know if the feature or a product that you're calling bento box, what is that?
00:50:01.600 - 00:50:37.028, Speaker C: It's just leverage, basically. On every single pair of sushi swap, you will be able to deposit your assets and basically earn apy on top while people are borrowing it and going for leverage. Position two to three x, it's going to be enabled with flash loans inside and so on. Boring. Crypto has been the architect behind it. There is a lot of development on this side, and I think if one wanted to learn more, you could always read the Bento box plus medium article. I can probably link it to you in the show notes.
00:50:37.028 - 00:51:22.536, Speaker C: It's going to be a way for people to, if you have like a quote unquote gem, you will be able to long it, you will be able to short it. There will be no assets that are not possible to basically leverage. And what is very interesting with this aspect or this approach is that we're not going to be optimizing for TVL on pairs. So we're not going after the compound ave cream of this world. We're really optimizing for usage. We are making sure that the APY are going to be high for people that are in need of, I guess, a very specific asset. And that's why the elastic rate kicks in.
00:51:22.536 - 00:52:16.452, Speaker C: It's going to be very fast. It's going to be way different than Ave and compound and these sort of things we're talking about like an ideal API of 80% on pairs, 90% goes to the people putting the assets to work. 10% goes to x sushi holders. And then whenever there is like a liquidization happening, the first 2% of the asset can be flashed, loaned, and the profit is going to be paid directly to Xushi holder before it is our bots that can access it. So this way, we're making sure that the system is benefiting the whole ecosystem of sushiSwap, and we're also giving the liberty or freedom, the freedom for people to create new pairs whenever they want. So they can pick the oracle, they can pick the risk parameters. It's all isolated risk.
00:52:16.452 - 00:53:01.944, Speaker C: So if a pair fail, it's not going to affect the broader system of the bento product. So this is kind of, I guess it's very difficult to wrap your mind around, but once you read, I guess, the medium article and the documentation, you just simply get it. And what is very cool about it is it's not just a product. It's also called, it's an infrastructure layer, too. So you can build on top of the bento box with assets being available without approved transaction and so on. You have like a very capital efficient base layer to build on top. So we're probably going to see, quote unquote, the AMM built on this, on top of this.
00:53:01.944 - 00:53:07.850, Speaker C: Who knows? Maybe we're going to see other products. This is kind of Bento for you. Yeah.
00:53:08.300 - 00:53:19.260, Speaker B: So the assets that people are borrowing, are they the same assets that have been deposited to sushi in the amms, or is it a different product that's unrelated?
00:53:19.600 - 00:53:46.820, Speaker C: Different product, yeah. But there's going to be more interwining, I guess, in 2021, once it is launched, we're probably going to have way more builder and we're going to have incentives, probably, and grants for people to experiment with it, because I do think it's going to be instrumental in our future and in a way to differentiate ourselves than UniSwap.
00:53:47.160 - 00:54:24.720, Speaker B: So this actually starts to feel like a little bit something more like a right, like this is something that I think or behavior that we are seeing coming out of Yam, where Yam built the umbrella protocol, which really has. It's arbitrary, has nothing to really do with a yam token, except for that people behind the yam token built the product. Is this kind of the same thing where the bento box doesn't actually have anything to do with sushi swap the amm, but it's under the sushi umbrella. What's the takeaway message there? Should we expect more products that are differentiated from other sushi products that are still under the sushi umbrella.
00:54:25.060 - 00:54:48.056, Speaker C: Exactly. I mean, you are nailing it down. It's like a dow. It's an open. Everything can happen in the sushi ecosystem. You're a chef. If the idea is we are received by the community and we're just going to be giving you funding and get to it, and we want to enable passionate people to join us and build what they're passionate about.
00:54:48.056 - 00:55:32.330, Speaker C: It's about what you love. And to be honest, if there's one contribution to sushi, that the impact we had with sushi swap was to make sure that incentives are more broadly distributed from now on. The fact that we can onboard like full time people that were not necessarily working in crypto full time, this is wonderful. In my opinion, it's all about making sure that the ecosystem grow, and by doing so, not only are you helping the sushi ecosystem, but the broader community. And then we're just getting closer to a bankless future and a future where we are building the future of France, basically.
00:55:33.100 - 00:55:36.570, Speaker A: Mackie, how much volume do you guys have these days?
00:55:38.300 - 00:55:41.788, Speaker C: To be fair with you, I don't look at the volume every single day, I can tell you.
00:55:41.794 - 00:55:43.980, Speaker B: Right, in a week, plus or minus.
00:55:44.960 - 00:55:46.990, Speaker C: I think it's a bit more than this.
00:55:48.160 - 00:56:00.592, Speaker A: Let's call it half a billion to a billion a week. As you're talking, Mackia, I just want to pause and reflect at how strange this is and how revolutionary this is.
00:56:00.646 - 00:56:00.912, Speaker C: Right.
00:56:00.966 - 00:56:43.144, Speaker A: So here is a DFI protocol built by a team of pseudo anonymous individuals that was originally built as a fork of another protocol. And you have right now 100 million in your treasury to continue through a dow to deploy, to build out the product. You've got volume between 500 million to a billion a week. You are continuing to iterate and build like a revolutionary DFI primitive. For someone thinking about traditional startups, even somebody who's on the cutting edge traditional startups in Silicon Valley.
00:56:43.192 - 00:56:43.656, Speaker C: Right?
00:56:43.778 - 00:57:27.148, Speaker A: This sounds crazy. This sounds bizarre. Like this is not the way the traditional world works. If you wanted to build a banking system or a financial primitive in the traditional world, it would take regulation, it would take licenses, it would take vc checks, it would take startup funding, it would take an established headquarters location, it would take press releases and partnerships. What we're doing here in DeFi is so strange compared to how the traditional world does that. I was just struck by that as you guys were talking. I don't know if you have any follow up comments to that, Mackie, but this is truly a different type of thing.
00:57:27.148 - 00:57:28.860, Speaker A: That's happening in DFI.
00:57:29.360 - 00:57:42.640, Speaker C: Yeah. Just to give you maybe more numbers, metrics behind what you just said for the week, the past week we did in volume around $2 billion just on.
00:57:42.710 - 00:57:47.764, Speaker B: Sushi swap a day, not a week. That was my mistake there.
00:57:47.882 - 00:58:33.890, Speaker C: Yeah, no problem. Who could have thought that we would be here six months ago? No one, I think. But this is just a testament to how you can build anything and pretty much gain traction by just perseverance and making sure that you have a community that is not only enabled and working and growing the pie for you. This is kind of crazy, but it's not benefiting me, myself, individually, but everyone that is part of it. And I think that is what is very important. We are enabling people to swap assets from anywhere in the world. There's no front end bypass or whatever it is.
00:58:33.890 - 00:59:34.316, Speaker C: Ethereum is really like, in my opinion, the next step in enabling, I guess, the future of finance and I guess the world is not even ready for when we can have or eat wallets on our iPhone or androids or whatever, and pay on square terminal and so on. This is just the rails of the future and daos and open. We don't have, I guess, the blueprint yet to build them. You can see recently, I'm pretty sure some people on the yarn ecosystem are listening. We're going to see a minting, possibly a voting on a minting to make sure that contributors are incentivized in a decent way and to bring treasury to their community. So everything is kind of still moving, and we're assembling the rocket as we fly kind of type of situation. So I do think that the future that is coming is not even.
00:59:34.316 - 01:00:08.912, Speaker C: This is just the start. Like, what we're seeing here is just the start. We don't even have all of the innovation. We have some exotic perps, exotic option, derivative and so on that are coming. The finance layer on ethereum is something, but I don't know if you've seen all the NFTs action happening to the way that they're becoming more liquid. This is very interesting on all the fronts, I guess. And this is why I cannot just think that any other layer can, I guess, remove ethereum of it.
01:00:08.912 - 01:00:11.490, Speaker C: There's just too much happening. There's too much life.
01:00:12.660 - 01:00:45.310, Speaker B: Mackie, you've used the word capital efficiency, or the phrase capital efficiency a number of times so far in the show, and I know that Andre from urine is really big on the concept of capital efficiency. And so since you guys are close to that project, it seems to make sense that sushi is focused on capital efficiency as well. Maybe you could talk about your philosophy about capital efficiency and design in sushi swap products that make capital more efficient. Maybe you could talk about that.
01:00:45.680 - 01:01:16.500, Speaker C: So, for example, very quickly, because I know we're running out of time a little bit, but capital efficiency is that you can deposit your assets, for example, in a urine vault or in a bento box kind of pool or something like this, and you don't need to move it yourself. You don't need to pay a huge amount to move all of this. Similar to. Have you ever switched capital from compound to Ave?
01:01:17.480 - 01:01:18.688, Speaker B: Yeah. Manually?
01:01:18.864 - 01:01:54.256, Speaker C: Yeah, manually. It can be an asshole sometimes. I know there's some tools with flash loans now, but before that it was very tedious, I would say a tedious process. With Bento, you don't even need to approve other contracts to kind of move all of these assets and so on. And it's just to make sure things are less cost, they cost less to you in transaction and so on. It's really about this, and also that you get the most out of your assets. So, for example, if you are LP, you want to deposit them in.
01:01:54.256 - 01:02:19.188, Speaker C: Maybe a solution that is going to provide you impermanent loss without you needing to move everything. We're thinking about strategies on top of Bento to make sure that assets of people are working for them while they are sitting there being lended. So it's all of this notion that when we're talking about capital efficiency, Maki.
01:02:19.364 - 01:03:00.170, Speaker A: We want to close this maybe by talking about the future of DeFi in general. So we talked about so many things. I'm sure you were in a place now you didn't think you would be a year ago at this time, right? So at some level, it's hard to predict the future. That said, you are on kind of the frontier, as we would call it, on bankless, of this whole Defi experiment, and you're talking to many different projects. What do you see ahead for us in DeFi right now? What projects are you excited about? Either things inside sushi or in Defi in general, that we should also be looking into.
01:03:01.980 - 01:04:39.172, Speaker C: To be honest, I think what is going to be very interesting to see evolve and so on, besides scalability and so on. It's all the fact that this project can be started now without any sort of funding, I would say, or there is no gatekeeper anymore, right? Which means if there is no gatekeeper, all the innovation can happen and be funded by the community and I guess the early adopters, meaning that we're going to be seeing people that are able to support themselves and launch whatever they please, whatever they're passionate about, whether it is derivative, whether it is related to identity, whether it is related to NFT. We're going to be seeing more innovation than we can even concede at this point that we can absorb in our mind who would have predict all of this liquidity mining phase? And this is just one thing, right? This is just to bootstrap like liquidity and so on. It's not perfect for everything. But I do think that we're going to be seeing other, not just primitives, but incentives in a way. I think the one I want to be seeing myself and we're going to be working on at sushi is enabling developers to be quote unquote paid or like having more revenue streams from helping protocols. So they don't need to ask permission for a grant, they don't need to go by a tedious process.
01:04:39.172 - 01:05:50.110, Speaker C: Or else they just can build with legos that are provided and be incentivized for doing so. I think once we can make sure that builders are incentivized in a remarkable way, I think we're going to see so much innovation from them that the human are very creative individuals and anonymous is probably the anonymous kind of Persona and so on are going to keep going and being more mainstream, I do think. And at some point it's just not going to be our only little bubble that we are in, that crypto is for power user and crypto native and so on. We're probably going to be seeing people in all part of the world being able to accept crypto for the first time. The PayPal news that happened, people forgot already about it, but it's happening and they're going to be opening in many countries very soon, meaning that we are going to be able to be first class citizen with crypto. And once the shift happens, anything is possible at that point.
01:05:51.360 - 01:06:35.460, Speaker B: Mackie, I want to thank you for coming on the bankless state of the nation. I think there's a lot of really powerful takeaways that we can get from this conversation and from what Sushiswap has taught the ecosystem. I think one of the biggest things that it's taught me and showed the rest of the listeners is that, well, first off, Sushi has a massive treasury that could be somebody's paycheck. And that is not just for sushi swap. That's also true for Yam, that's also true for urine. A lot of these DFI protocols have treasuries that they're ready to pay out to people that provide value to the ecosystem. That was something that, personally, when I was getting into the space of crypto in 2017, there wasn't very many opportunities to contribute.
01:06:35.460 - 01:07:22.888, Speaker B: If you didn't know how to code, if you didn't know how to write solidity, you kind of had to sit and watch while the coders did the coding stuff. But with Yam, with sushi, with wire, there's a lot of community management, there's branding, writing, marketing. And I think it's an open invitation to anyone listening or watching this on YouTube that there are protocols that are looking for your human capital, your labor. And Sushiswap is kind of pioneering that along with their own path through Defi, just kind of being exemplar models of what open source software development can really look like in a world powered by Ethereum. I think this is a fantastic story that I personally will be watching with great interest. So, Mackie, thank you for coming on and helping tell that story to the bankless nation.
01:07:22.984 - 01:08:03.400, Speaker C: Pleasure. Thank you for having me. David and Ryan, I never expected to be on this show, to be honest with you. I remember vividly when all of the not Maxi, but all the fervent influencer of Ethereum, I would say, were very against Sushiswap. But we proved ourselves to be actual pillar of the ecosystem, I think, and we will keep going, so we'll keep doing so and be there for helping any project to launch, to exchange on our platform and so on, and provide collaboration, because this is key in this ecosystem.
01:08:03.740 - 01:08:26.556, Speaker A: Well said. There are no gatekeepers in the bankless economy. Mackie, thank you very much for joining us, guys. David and I work for a protocol. It sounds like there are tons of opportunities for you to work for a protocol, too. Perhaps your kids will work for protocols, not companies. Really fascinating discussion here with Mackie, of course, risks and disclaimers.
01:08:26.556 - 01:08:38.110, Speaker A: Eth is risky, Defi is risky. So is all of crypto. This is really the frontier. We're headed west. It's not for everyone. But thanks for joining us on bankless today.
