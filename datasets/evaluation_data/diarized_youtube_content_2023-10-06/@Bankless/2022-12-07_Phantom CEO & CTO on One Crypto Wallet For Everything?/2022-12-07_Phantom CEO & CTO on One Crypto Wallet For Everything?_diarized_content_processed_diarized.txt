00:00:00.250 - 00:00:22.106, Speaker A: Phantom, which is a crypto wallet, is kind of similar to MetaMask, kind of in browser. And it's been previously on the Solana wallet. And now it is going to be deployed to ethereum. And I wanted to see it for myself because I have not had any experience actually with Phantom to date that will displease the soul.
00:00:22.138 - 00:00:54.962, Speaker B: Maxi yeah, true will also be joining you in that this will be the first time I've seen the Phantom wallet, but from everyone that I know in the crypto world who goes across all the chains much more than you and I have the time for, they say that their favorite thing about Solana is the Phantom wallet. So now Phantom, they announced that they're coming to the ethereum layer one and also polygon. And so the joy that is Phantom wallet is about to be able to be experienced by the ethereum side of things. So, Ryan, I'm happy to have you join me on one of these Alpha leak episodes.
00:00:55.046 - 00:00:57.342, Speaker A: Yeah. Am I doing it right? Is this going okay so far?
00:00:57.396 - 00:00:58.286, Speaker B: That's great.
00:00:58.468 - 00:01:15.950, Speaker A: I'm super excited, honestly. And this is more than just a conversation. I think we're going to actually see some live demos here of what's going on, what Phantom is about to release. Guys, before we get into it, want to tell you about another tool that is essential for your bankless journey. That tool is called opolis. David, tell them about Opolis.
00:01:16.030 - 00:01:56.818, Speaker B: Opolis, yeah. So there's a bunch of things that we like to do in the world of Web Three. We like to work for a Dow, or perhaps we like to be an NFT artist. Things that are confusing to typical nation state employment structures. How do you manage payroll, how do you manage health care, how do you manage your taxes when you are working on the frontier in ways that the nation state doesn't understand? Well, opolis is here to help you do what you do best, which is continue to be working on the frontier of Web Three while also being compliant with taxes and also getting health care. Opelis is a co op. And so everyone who is a part of the Opelis ecosystem, they all come together.
00:01:56.818 - 00:02:36.030, Speaker B: And then Opelis negotiates for better and better healthcare rates and services. Because of how many people that they have in the Opolis co op, they are able to negotiate healthcare services for their co op members. Also, because it's a co op, if you sign up for Opolis, you also become an owner of Opolis. Sounds pretty damn web3 to me. And so if you join soon, by the end of this month, by December 31, you get 1000 work tokens, which is the token of the Opolis co op, and 1000 bank tokens as well. There is a link in the show notes for you to get started so you can continue pioneering out the frontier with healthcare. Because the frontier is dangerous.
00:02:36.370 - 00:03:02.598, Speaker A: That is important of course, independent contractors in crypto. You absolutely need to check this out. All right, David, do we want to say anything more about Phantom? Actually, I don't know the details in terms of when they're deploying, so I'm hoping to ask that from the Phantom guys. I'm also hopeful to see kind of a demo of what that looks like. Ideally the demo that's kind of multi chain. So showing us, like, ethereum and matic. What else should viewers pay attention to today?
00:03:02.684 - 00:03:39.746, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that well, first off, the Ethereum Ecosystem could definitely use some competition in the wallet space. MetaMask definitely dominates. Rainbow is definitely growing in market share, but more wallets competing with other wallets is always great and sounds like Phantom is entering the ring of competition in the Ethereum Ecosystem, which competition is great for the consumer. I also want to ask about, because on the MetaMask side of things, there's always, like, the infura backend. It is controversial, even though it shouldn't be, but we will ask about that. How does transactions get broadcasted? What is the back end of this solana wallet as well?
00:03:39.768 - 00:03:42.994, Speaker A: How bankless is it? How bankless autonomous is it? Exactly.
00:03:43.112 - 00:03:46.498, Speaker B: Yeah, but I think those are the big angles to pay attention to.
00:03:46.584 - 00:03:56.358, Speaker A: Well, guys, we'll be right back with Brandon and Francesco from Francesco from Phantom. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:03:56.524 - 00:04:44.594, Speaker B: Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web Three landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems. With a recent addition of Arbitrum, nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home. Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees. With Arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro, it's also now ten times faster than before. Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum.
00:04:44.594 - 00:05:33.958, Speaker B: Experience Web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap and friction free. The Brave Wallet is your secure multitrain onramp into Web Three, and it's built directly into the Brave privacy browser. Gone are the days of managing multiple wallet extensions that put you at risk of phishing, spoofs and tracking. With the Brave Wallet, you can securely manage your crypto assets across more than 100 different chains, including Ethereum, Layer Two, Salana and more, all without downloading risky extensions. The Brave Wallet is easy to set up and removes the headache of jumping between wallets and extensions. It's lightweight, but packed with great features like built in token swaps, buying and holding NFTs with a gallery view and support for hardware wallets, but also much more than that because Brave is shipping new features every single month with a mission to make Web Three easier to navigate for its over 55 million users. Wallet extensions are a thing of the past.
00:05:33.958 - 00:06:01.770, Speaker B: So get started with Brave's Web Three ready browser today and experience a decentralized Web seamlessly without all the clutter. You can download the browser@brave.com bankless and click the wallet icon to get started. How many total Airdrops have you gotten? This last bull market had a ton of them. Did you get them all? Maybe you missed one. So here's what you should do. Go to Earnify and plug in your Ethereum wallet, and Earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed Airdrops that you can get, and it also does poaps and mintable NFTs any kind of money that your wallet can claim.
00:06:01.770 - 00:06:27.174, Speaker B: Earnify will tell you about it. And you should probably do it now because some Airdrops expire. And if you sign up for Earnify, they'll email you. Anytime one of your wallets has a new AirDrop for it to make sure that you never lose an AirDrop ever again. You can also upgrade to Earnify premium to unlock access to Airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets. And for just under $21 a month, it probably pays for itself with just one AirDrop. So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get.
00:06:27.174 - 00:06:29.250, Speaker B: That's ear ni.
00:06:29.410 - 00:06:46.430, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are here with the Phantom team to talk about Ethereum's newest wallet. I'm expecting big things from this, guys. No pressure, but I've heard so much about Phantom when I kind of see this. We've got Brandon, who's the COO and co founder, and Francesco, who is the CTO and co founder. Guys. Welcome to Bankless.
00:06:47.410 - 00:06:49.038, Speaker C: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
00:06:49.124 - 00:07:14.230, Speaker A: Okay, so I would say welcome to Ethereum, but you guys are like, you've been on Ethereum before, and you've been building on Ethereum previous to Phantom. Can you tell us about that? And let me be maybe one of the first to say welcome back to Ethereum. If no one's ever said that on a podcast with you, it's great to have Phantom entering the ecosystem. We're very excited. But can you tell us about your stories in Crypto, how you started Phantom?
00:07:14.890 - 00:07:15.640, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:07:16.010 - 00:07:16.374, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:16.412 - 00:07:32.934, Speaker C: First of all, thanks so much for having us on the show. Super exciting to kind of give everyone a preview of what's to come from our side and what to expect and yeah, longtime listener. So pretty surreal to be on here. So appreciate it.
00:07:32.992 - 00:07:33.630, Speaker A: Cheers.
00:07:35.170 - 00:07:35.534, Speaker D: Cool.
00:07:35.572 - 00:07:35.726, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:35.748 - 00:07:42.938, Speaker C: Well, I can kind of get started, just talk a little bit about how we got started, how we ended up where we are, because you guys have.
00:07:42.964 - 00:07:48.206, Speaker A: Some experience, like before Phantom. Take us to the before Phantom days and then the story of Phantom.
00:07:48.318 - 00:08:27.326, Speaker C: Totally. So Francesco, myself, and Chris, who's the third co founder, we all got our start in Crypto around 2017. So if you remember that's sort of the previous hype cycle all about ICOs white papers sort of ethereum come up and we all got our start at a crypto startup called Zero X, which is a company that develops decentralized exchange technology sort of in the ethereum DFI space. And we kind of got our start actually before DFI was even coined as.
00:08:27.348 - 00:08:31.120, Speaker B: A term, zero X was a 2017 darling. Yeah, I remember.
00:08:31.650 - 00:08:33.360, Speaker C: Yeah, good times.
00:08:33.730 - 00:08:38.190, Speaker D: Didn't Lake coined a term or someone at Zero X was involved in coining the term DeFi?
00:08:38.350 - 00:09:39.222, Speaker C: Yeah, there was like a bit of a story there. There's sort of like a telegram group where DeFi was originally coined and we had a couple of coworkers in that group. But yeah, anyway, so that's kind of how we got started. And yeah, that was a really different time. It was basically the whole DFI Web Three space was really emerging from this sort of primordial goop of the permissionless blockchain and everyone was just sort of like working in their lanes trying to figure things out. And so the area that we were very fortunate to be able to work on was this decentralized exchange area. And from basically the course of 2017 and 2021, so about four years, we were doubling down on decentralized exchange and had the great opportunity to work on a number of pretty widely used DApps in the Ethereum space.
00:09:39.222 - 00:11:00.366, Speaker C: So one of them is called Matcha XYZ, which is a dex aggregator that you may have used or some of the listeners may have used, but basically it's a DAP that helps a user get the best price possible for a swap by sort of scanning all the different types of decentralized exchanges out there. And we also worked on sort of the backend technology for that called Xerox API, which actually is used to power a number of swap experiences across the entire ecosystem. So that's kind of where we cut our teeth and where we really got to get some experience building DApps at scale. And through that experience, we sort of were able to gain a couple of key insights. So the first insight that we gained was that the wallet is basically the bottleneck of growth for the entire Web Three ecosystem, really. So once you start building a DAP and you get to a certain size and you say, hey, let's really start being diligent about trying to grow the DAP, analyzing growth funnels and all of that, you end up realizing that every single funnel ends with sending someone over to MetaMask. So whether that's on the sign up flow, you ask someone to install a wallet, you kind of kick them out to MetaMask and hope that they return.
00:11:00.366 - 00:11:43.854, Speaker C: And then even on core flows, like even on the swaps, every single flow terminates and a MetaMask pop up and sort of praying that the wallet is sort of holding up its end of the bargain. And properly guiding the user towards those last steps. And so, yeah, we realized that wallets were, I think, not necessarily innovating at the pace that we would like working at the application layer. And we decided, hey, someone needs to kind of step up and push the competition here. And so that's kind of how we decided to go after Phantom in the first place, was through our experience working at Zero X.
00:11:43.972 - 00:12:04.530, Speaker B: Is there any part of the wallet ecosystem, the wallet flow or UX that you really identified? Like, damn, damn, this is really broken. I would like to fix this. This part is not being innovative on somebody should do this. Maybe we should do it. What parts of the wallet world do you remember as the things that you really wanted to target?
00:12:05.530 - 00:12:42.240, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. Well, yeah, like I mentioned before, so there's two main areas. So there's one sort of like signing up for adapt, sort of necessitates you going over to a wallet and installing it. So the whole onboarding piece to this day remains pretty hard for normal users. But that's definitely one area that we were looking at and wanting to innovate. And then the second is the actual transaction authorization. So when people are performing transactions and approving them, they usually don't know what they're doing.
00:12:42.240 - 00:12:58.530, Speaker C: They see some information about call data or addresses or something like that, but vast majority of people don't know what's going on and it's very confusing. And so that's another area that we were looking to innovate.
00:12:59.190 - 00:13:27.486, Speaker A: Can I ask you a question that's been on the back of my mind? We love that you guys are in Ethereum. What took you guys so long to get here? And so you started in the Solana, and many of our Solana friends have always been very excited about the Phantom for Solana. There's clearly a desire from the Ethereum community. Why now? Can you talk about some of the decisions behind that?
00:13:27.668 - 00:14:35.134, Speaker C: Yeah, well, kind of going back to my initial intro, so we kind of had two main insights actually that guided us towards building Phantom. One was this idea that, hey, working on the wallet is probably the highest leverage place that we can be to actually help grow the entire web Three ecosystem. The second insight is that the world is moving towards a more MultiChain future. And actually for me personally, the first time that that really kind of came to fruition for me was observing the rise of finance smart chain in 2020. And before Binance smart chain, it was pretty much unthinkable by anyone in the Ethereum community that as a user or developer, you would use anything other than Ethereum. But Binance smart chain really challenged that notion and really showed that one, there was an appetite for faster and cheaper blockchains. But especially if you couple that with the distribution of a giant like Binance, you can actually really kind of shift the landscape.
00:14:35.134 - 00:16:18.838, Speaker C: And so the second major insight that we had was that the world was moving towards a more multi chain future. And so that's sort of the provenance of Phantom as a multi chain MetaMask competitor. So then that brings me to your question kind of what took us so long to come to ETH and what brought us down the path that we did? We decided that we saw firsthand how dominant MetaMask was on Ethereum and understood that there are some very powerful network effects going on there and understood that it would be very difficult to compete head on with MetaMask. So what we decided to do, especially because we believe that the future would be MultiChain, was to basically carefully pick an alternate l one blockchain to start our journey on, use that blockchain to sort of carve out our home turf, and then use that time on that blockchain to build momentum and sort of cut our teeth with the product and then sort of propel ourselves over sort of of kind the next legs of our journey. But the problem with that was that we ended up exploding in like Solana ended up exploding in popularity and growth and we basically had to just double down just to survive basically and ride the wave, so to speak. And so I think in an ideal world we actually would have come home a lot sooner, so to speak. But yeah, we really had to basically double down to serve the community and all of the activity that was happening there.
00:16:18.924 - 00:16:31.260, Speaker A: I think by the way, partially because of Phantom, solana saw such fantastic growth, like a very polished, a strong UX experience in the wallet side, helps with onboarding for sure.
00:16:33.790 - 00:17:16.194, Speaker D: It was always part of the roadmap. We actually even had I think during our Solana beta we had an EVM waitlist. So we were very optimistic about when we would be able to ship multi chain and then we just started gaining hundreds of thousands of users per week and the biggest challenge that was like was spam, basically. So we became a honeypot. Our users became like a target and we had to build all this spam infrastructure and trust and safety infrastructure. That took us many months. So now we have an awesome support team, I think one of the best in the industry, honestly.
00:17:16.194 - 00:18:06.280, Speaker D: I heard you guys call MetaMask the support for Ethereum. We feel very much the same way about Phantom. On Solana we are the support desk. So we built all that and we can get into this later. But we also and Brennan touched on it a little bit, but we actually incubated a company called Blowfish that builds this. It's sort of like a transaction firewall, transaction antivirus service. So instead of having this don't trust verify contract, which is what it is today on MetaMask and other wallets where you're expected, sure there's some information surface, but at the end you as a user are expected to make the final call about whether to execute the transaction, whether it's safe or not.
00:18:06.280 - 00:18:27.822, Speaker D: We try to take some of the responsibility there now, and we'll actually tell you whether what we think about it. So if we see something suspicious with the transaction, we'll actually flag it and we still let you click through and submit it. So we're not blocking anything, but we just try to inform you in the best way that we can about that. I think that is a super important part of what we did, too.
00:18:27.956 - 00:18:28.206, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:28.228 - 00:19:18.538, Speaker B: And there's definitely, like, a philosophical choice here, right? MetaMask is very built with a very intentional philosophy about user first. It wants to be kind of like bare metal, bare minimum, and really just push all power and control to the user. But a lot of modern users are like, well, can you kind of take care of me, though? Can you tell me that this transaction I'm about to sign will drain my wallet? Even if that is a pop up, that perhaps is a political choice? There's a lot of philosophy there, so maybe that's something to keep in mind while we go through the wallet and see some of the features. I know. Like, Dan Finley is kind of at MetaMask. He's kind of a philosopher type and has very strong opinions about how wallets should get built. So maybe we can talk about that as we go through the wallet.
00:19:18.538 - 00:19:31.700, Speaker B: But guys, I'd love to see it because I'll totally admit I'm about to be embarrassed by the YouTube chat here. I actually personally have not seen the Phantom wallet. Can we whip out some images so I can kind of get my eyes on it?
00:19:32.070 - 00:19:34.340, Speaker D: Well, we have a demo. Do you want images or a demo?
00:19:36.230 - 00:19:38.310, Speaker A: Wait, what does the chat want? David?
00:19:39.050 - 00:19:47.910, Speaker B: I'm sure the chat wants the demo. I'll speak for them. Well, there's a lag time, so they're going to see this moment in about 10 seconds.
00:19:48.410 - 00:19:49.930, Speaker A: Give them the demo no matter what.
00:19:50.000 - 00:19:51.850, Speaker B: Yeah. All right. What are we seeing here?
00:19:51.920 - 00:20:06.142, Speaker D: Sharing my so. And Brandon, feel free to chime in here. Whatever. What you're about to see is the Phantom multi chain beta build. So this is not available to users yet. It'll be available next week or two.
00:20:06.196 - 00:20:07.600, Speaker B: So no one's seen this?
00:20:08.290 - 00:20:10.910, Speaker D: No one has seen this. This is an alpha leak.
00:20:12.130 - 00:20:12.766, Speaker A: You said it.
00:20:12.788 - 00:20:14.020, Speaker B: Alpha Leaf said it.
00:20:14.630 - 00:20:17.890, Speaker A: Wow, these shows are great. I should join them more often. David.
00:20:21.190 - 00:20:33.030, Speaker D: So if you want to sign up, you can sign up at Phantom app. Slash waitlist, by the way. Yeah, let's get started. So I'll use this bankless background, since it's way nicer.
00:20:33.450 - 00:20:34.390, Speaker A: Agreed.
00:20:35.530 - 00:20:37.480, Speaker D: Anything you want to say, Brandon, before I open?
00:20:38.970 - 00:20:39.846, Speaker C: Go for it.
00:20:39.948 - 00:21:04.480, Speaker A: One challenge is if, as we're going, we should say a few things because there's going to be some people that are actually listening to this in podcast form, I remind you, like YouTube banquets comes on YouTube. And also Spotify has a video version of this. But if you could, as you're going, Francesco, kind of just describe a little bit for people who don't know the visual in front of them.
00:21:05.730 - 00:21:16.660, Speaker C: Sure. One thing I'll add before we get started is that, yeah, we're going through the browser extension version, but everything that you see here is also available as a mobile app on both iOS and Android as well.
00:21:17.270 - 00:21:18.020, Speaker A: Correct.
00:21:19.210 - 00:22:07.380, Speaker D: So I'm just unlocking my Phantom wallet and bam, we're in. So the first thing you'll notice is that you see Ethereum, Solana and Polygon all in one account. So that is how we're modeling multi chain Phantom. So there's this concept of, quote unquote multi chain accounts. So instead of having to switch between a Solana account, an Ethereum account, or a Polygon account, you sort of have them have these blended views and we try to abstract the underlying chain as much as possible. So if you hover over the copy tooltip, you'll actually see all three addresses. And of course, the Ethereum and Polygon ones are the same, but we try not to make any assumptions about what our users know.
00:22:07.380 - 00:22:32.542, Speaker D: So it's tempting to have like an EVM real here or something, but I think as we add more chains, we'll be very explicit about what your address is on an EVM chain, even though it's like, the same. So you'll never see this EVM concept in here, really. You'll just see, like, Ethereum, Polygon and whatever other chains support that's it for the home screen. Brandon, I'll let you chime in if.
00:22:32.596 - 00:23:01.062, Speaker C: You wanted to say, yeah, that's pretty much it. This is the home screen. Like Francesco mentioned, as a user, you have an account. Each account has a grouping of addresses, which may be a slightly different concept to someone who's familiar with MetaMask, where they just sort of have one address per account. But this mental model is actually not so different from what you might expect from an experience on Coinbase, for example.
00:23:01.196 - 00:23:23.790, Speaker A: What do you mean by an have? Let's say I have five Ethereum addresses, public Ethereum addresses, and then I have five others on Polygon. Those are the addresses. What's the account? Is the account. The one thing that I have with Phantom. What's kind of the account level that you're aggregating?
00:23:24.850 - 00:23:34.002, Speaker D: Yeah, the number can share around accounts is always interesting. So typically in a wallet, you'd call these addresses accounts. So I believe MetaMask calls them that as, right?
00:23:34.056 - 00:23:34.900, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:23:35.350 - 00:24:14.160, Speaker D: So we're just calling them multi chain accounts. So it's sort of this, as Brandon said, this grouping of addresses across all the chains is one account in Phantom. So if you have five polygon addresses that you want to import, so that's going to be another important thing to say. Say you have a seed phrase with a bunch of ETH addresses on it. You'd be able to import those into Phantom and you'd still have your five ETH addresses be imported, and you'd be able to switch between them. But each of those accounts, each of those single chain accounts will have been magically multi chainified, and they will have corresponding Solana accounts as well.
00:24:16.290 - 00:24:18.458, Speaker A: Corresponding solana accounts.
00:24:18.554 - 00:24:22.366, Speaker D: I might be getting a little bit into the weeds, but maybe we need.
00:24:22.388 - 00:24:24.080, Speaker A: To see more to see how this works.
00:24:24.450 - 00:24:41.080, Speaker B: One question I have for you on this interface here is like, all right, so we got some Ether on Ethereum, we got some Sol on Salana, and we got some Maddok on Polygon. But Maddox, I could actually send that to the Ethereum layer one. So if I had Maddox on my Ethereum address, how would that be displayed here?
00:24:42.250 - 00:24:48.854, Speaker D: Yeah. So we support all Polygon and Ethereum, ERC 20s, too. So all tokens show up here okay.
00:24:48.972 - 00:24:50.870, Speaker A: In their aggregated form, right?
00:24:51.020 - 00:24:53.642, Speaker D: In an aggregated form. Oh, that's a great question, actually.
00:24:53.776 - 00:24:56.458, Speaker B: Right. How do I know what network they're on is the question.
00:24:56.624 - 00:25:03.918, Speaker D: I don't happen to have any other tokens in this wallet except for span tokens, which I will unhide just to show you this.
00:25:04.004 - 00:25:04.880, Speaker B: Oh, cool.
00:25:06.690 - 00:25:08.654, Speaker D: They're all on Solana, but this should be good enough.
00:25:08.772 - 00:25:12.750, Speaker A: Like quality tokens, flip GG.
00:25:13.970 - 00:25:24.130, Speaker D: So that is a good question. So for native assets, we sort of just have these one off icons, but for any other asset, we'll show you the icon of the asset.
00:25:24.550 - 00:25:25.250, Speaker B: Perfect.
00:25:25.400 - 00:25:26.606, Speaker A: Oh, that's smart.
00:25:26.718 - 00:25:27.246, Speaker B: Love it.
00:25:27.288 - 00:25:30.806, Speaker D: So you can expect Polygon logo and Ethereum logo here as well.
00:25:30.988 - 00:25:40.246, Speaker A: Very smart. So if you had it on both chains, it would show you both logos. Correct. And if you have it on five chains, all five logos, we have some.
00:25:40.268 - 00:25:51.094, Speaker D: Ideas about USDCs across a lot of chains and being able to click in and then seeing this aggregated balance view, but we have not there's a lot of ideas around that, but haven't done that.
00:25:51.232 - 00:25:52.960, Speaker A: Okay, got it.
00:25:54.130 - 00:25:58.270, Speaker D: Cool. I think it's time to move on to the NFT tab.
00:25:59.330 - 00:26:17.574, Speaker A: We're going to get at some point in this conversation into when is this actually going to arrive? Right? Because we're in beta version, you guys haven't deployed, but that's on everyone's mind. You don't have to answer it now. We want to tease people, but yes, be thinking about your answer for that.
00:26:17.692 - 00:26:20.326, Speaker D: Because we're going to ask we have an answer.
00:26:20.428 - 00:26:21.126, Speaker A: Good.
00:26:21.308 - 00:26:23.542, Speaker D: But we're also happy to tease the audience if you like.
00:26:23.596 - 00:26:26.582, Speaker A: All right. Yep, tease. Cool.
00:26:26.636 - 00:27:00.878, Speaker D: So moving into the NFT tab. So I will say this is one differentiator between us and MetaMask on the extension, at least that we show NFTs. So I have several hundred NFTs in here. You can click into the collection. So this is a popheads collection on Solana, then click again to see the actual added. So a lot of these features are not even available to Solana users. So we rewrote the app completely for multi chain.
00:27:00.974 - 00:27:01.426, Speaker A: Wow.
00:27:01.528 - 00:27:04.100, Speaker D: Which maybe answers your question about why it took us so long.
00:27:05.430 - 00:27:07.720, Speaker A: Would what would the list button do here?
00:27:08.250 - 00:27:11.830, Speaker D: So you can actually list this on Magic Eden.
00:27:13.530 - 00:27:16.470, Speaker A: Magic. Eden is now on ethereum. Are they moving to Ethereum?
00:27:17.950 - 00:27:25.580, Speaker D: So maybe that's another important concept is in the same way as the home tab. This is a blended view of your.
00:27:28.030 - 00:27:29.046, Speaker A: NFTs.
00:27:29.158 - 00:27:30.198, Speaker D: These are all NFTs.
00:27:30.214 - 00:27:30.346, Speaker A: Right.
00:27:30.368 - 00:27:34.238, Speaker D: Now we will buy an ethnic on this call.
00:27:34.404 - 00:27:39.498, Speaker A: On this call. Okay. We have a recommendation. Crypto punk NFTs.
00:27:39.674 - 00:27:40.426, Speaker D: Pardon?
00:27:40.538 - 00:27:45.170, Speaker A: Do you guys do sound NFTs? They could buy into the bankless collection. David.
00:27:49.190 - 00:28:14.406, Speaker B: I do like how you can list an NFT straight from the wallet. That is probably a fantastic user experience. I would expect people to expect just to have. Okay, so it tells you what the floor price and tells you the original purchase. See, here's a philosophical choice that I'm seeing here. You have the ability to list an NFT straight from the wallet on a specific marketplace.
00:28:14.438 - 00:28:14.634, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:14.672 - 00:28:38.450, Speaker B: So this is a choice that Phantom Wallet has made on its users about a particular NFT marketplace that it has chosen to be the place to go. Can you talk about a little bit of why that choice? Right, because if I wanted to put on my open source maxi hat, I would say, like, you guys are making a kingmaker out of Magic Eden by just routing the NFT liquidity there. Can you talk about that choice?
00:28:39.670 - 00:29:36.950, Speaker C: Yeah, I can talk a little bit about that. So, yeah, it's important to note that there's the experience that you have inside the walls of the wallet, but then there's also the experience of browsing any web3 application you want outside of the wallet. And so even though we provide a lot of interesting convenience features in the wallet, you can always bring your wallet around you with you to any application you want, whether that's OpenSea or blur or something else, and use them there. But we do offer certain convenience things directly into the wallet. And yeah, I'd say the choice that we made there is mostly around sort of safety and security. So when we put something directly into the wallet, we're basically making an implicit guarantee around the safety and security of that. And so we don't want to add any random marketplace that shows up.
00:29:36.950 - 00:29:47.830, Speaker C: We actually do want to make sure we vet the marketplace, the team, the integration, et cetera, before we say like, hey, this is safe for users.
00:29:48.730 - 00:30:10.974, Speaker A: Is that tied into your business model at all? Do you get a referral commission? Is that part of how you monetize this thing? Because a wallet is free. But of course, like MetaMask, for example, monetize it in various ways. Right. They have kind of a liquidity provider. They take a portion of fees. Is there something like that about Phantom that just people should be generally familiar with? Yeah.
00:30:11.012 - 00:30:26.450, Speaker C: So on the third tab there, we do have an in wallet swapper, which. Is very similar to MetaMask. And like MetaMask, we basically take a fee on certain pairs when you trade there, that's sort of described when you are sort of checking.
00:30:28.330 - 00:30:28.694, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:28.732 - 00:30:35.366, Speaker C: I mean, I think the business model is something that we're still everyone's figuring out in the wallet space, but the.
00:30:35.388 - 00:30:44.860, Speaker A: Way that we're but like the NFT listing, you're not receiving any commission if you list it on Magic Eden versus OpenSea or something, is that correct?
00:30:45.630 - 00:31:07.394, Speaker C: Not the moment, but it's something that actions that we take, basically the way we think about it is that we want to bring the best of ecosystems directly into the wallet, the best of different verbs or actions that you like to take. And all those are potential surface areas where we can add a convenience fee or do something.
00:31:07.512 - 00:31:09.650, Speaker B: Are there plans to integrate OpenSea?
00:31:11.030 - 00:31:17.250, Speaker C: No concrete plans at the moment, but also no concrete blockers. Just a matter of prioritization.
00:31:17.910 - 00:31:18.750, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:31:18.840 - 00:31:29.420, Speaker D: It's worth. This feature was designed in such a way that we can support multiple providers. It just so happens that Magic unit is extremely dominant on Solana, so we decided to go with them first.
00:31:29.950 - 00:31:37.738, Speaker A: Well, that's cool. So NFTs in the extension, of course, all of this is the same user experience, really, but very similar.
00:31:37.824 - 00:31:45.520, Speaker B: So these are all NFTs that you own. Can you also browse NFTs broadly or only the ones that you own?
00:31:46.290 - 00:31:47.822, Speaker D: Right now, it's only the ones that you own.
00:31:47.876 - 00:31:48.480, Speaker A: Okay.
00:31:49.090 - 00:32:07.430, Speaker D: On the mobile experience, we have a fifth tab, which is the browser, and we used to surface some recommendations in there, but of course Apple wasn't happy about that, so we can get to that too. But no, it's basically yours. Only yours.
00:32:08.410 - 00:32:12.120, Speaker C: If you scroll down there, you can actually see that there's an ENS in here as well.
00:32:12.490 - 00:32:14.120, Speaker D: Maybe there is, yeah.
00:32:15.130 - 00:32:19.640, Speaker C: So we have this phantomvault ETH ENS in there.
00:32:20.410 - 00:32:26.298, Speaker A: That is cool. Okay, so we've gone through kind of two tabs at the high level. Is there anything else on?
00:32:26.304 - 00:32:44.030, Speaker D: The other thing to call out is I think one thing we've learned is that a lot of NFT experiences are designed around especially in wallets. It feels like they're designed around users having maybe hundreds or tens or hundreds of NFTs, but we just find that our users have thousands.
00:32:46.370 - 00:32:46.878, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:46.964 - 00:33:26.394, Speaker D: So that's actually pretty common. And there's a whole bunch of reasons why that's challenging for us, but one reason and for them as well. So that's why we added search. So this will show you you're easily able to navigate to the specific NFT that you own. We have a lot of management features as well that will be coming out. So you can pin the collections you want to surface, bring those to the top of your collectibles tab. You can hide the collection if you don't want to see it, you can report it as spam.
00:33:26.394 - 00:33:38.018, Speaker D: So we've added a lot of given that our users have literally thousands of NFTs. We've added features to help them manage them because it can be really hard just to even find your NFT if you don't have this.
00:33:38.184 - 00:33:39.538, Speaker A: That's really good, guys.
00:33:39.704 - 00:34:15.402, Speaker C: Yeah, that's an important note that I want to double click on is that sort of our experience on Solana has been really interesting because we've taken a peek into the future of what an ultra low fee environment looks like and the different types of issues and problems that appear there. And yeah, basically TLDR is that people love to collect a lot of NFTs. So, yeah, a lot of users actually have thousands of NFTs and some users actually also have hundreds of wallets that they manage with.
00:34:15.456 - 00:35:04.138, Speaker A: That's what I think is cool. It's like back to kind of philosophies know, MetaMask started Ethereum main chains expanding outward, right? Whereas you guys started as an Ethereum world we might call like a side chain or a different chain, the Salana ecosystem. And now you're expanding in and that gives you like the whole experience on Salana over the past 18 months has got to be like Ethereum on steroids, basically, right? And so you've solved some of those problems. You've already started to think about MultiChain and I think it primes you guys to go because the MultiChain thesis is correct. I think that's been shown. It's correct. Now there's still some question as to whether there'll be dominant settlement layers versus a world of many side chains.
00:35:04.138 - 00:35:55.870, Speaker A: We've talked about this on bank list for listeners, right. It's kind of like the Ethereum one settlement layer and a whole bunch of layer twos and the Cosmos everything's an app chain sort of notion and maybe there's some probably space in between where they kind of converge. But both of those visions are multi chain, to be clear. Right. Like even in Ethereum with layer twos you're going to have arbitram and polygon and optimism and all the ZK providers as well. And so because you've already designed around that, that allows you to kind of expand quicker. So I guess maybe I'm kind of leading up to rather than a statement maybe sort of like a question does this all make layer two expansion fairly easy? Because now you're in a straight EVM world and you started with kind of polygon, but it's got to be I don't know, you tell me.
00:35:55.870 - 00:36:07.250, Speaker A: You're the CTO, Francesco, so correct me if I'm wrong, but it's got to be once you're here in Ethereum land in EVM, pretty easy to sort of scale this out across other layer twos somewhat.
00:36:11.750 - 00:37:08.710, Speaker D: I think you're right in that we were able to solve the harder problem up front, which is to support a non EVM chain and an EVM chain at once and in this case two EVM chains and one non EVM because that's a lot harder than it is just to support multiple EVM chains. And so we are really well positioned to add support for Arbitrarium, Avalanche, L, two S, what have you. But I will say that it's not as easy as you think, because our integrations are actually very deep. So even going back to the home page, we actually show you, unlike other wallets, in many cases, we show you all your tokens. So we have an index of which tokens you own and make sure to surface those automatically. You don't have to add it in the same way. Getting NFT data is quite challenging for new chains.
00:37:08.710 - 00:37:49.090, Speaker D: Supporting swapping on new chains can be somewhat challenging. Transaction history, same story. So I think it's really easy for us now to add support for new chains in a shallower way. So like this progressive enhancement, graceful degradation concept that you saw in browsers in the early days, too. So we have that sort of concept. It's really important to think about this degree of support concept. It's definitely easy for us to have light support, but the lift required to actually add all these features for a new chain is non trivial.
00:37:49.430 - 00:38:31.294, Speaker B: There was something that you said, Francesco, about how Phantom got a taste of what a low fee blockchain looks like. And it's always been mine and Ryan's philosophy that the economics of a monolithic blockchain are unsustainable. But again, we don't have to go into that. But Solana, I think what I got out of that is Solana, during its height of the Bull Run, really got a taste of the future, right? It was ahead of the game. What happens when there are zero fees? You see a Cambrian explosion of more NFTs, more collection. And so, to me, this wallet, whoever's wallet this is with a Bajillion NFTs in it, is a taste of the future. You're muted, Ryan, is a taste of the future.
00:38:31.294 - 00:38:58.226, Speaker B: Right. Where I expect everyone to have thousands of NFTs across so many different ecosystems, for whatever reasons. That is the Web three future that I envisioned for the world. Salana got there first because of the low fees. Whether or not monolithic chains are sustainable is a different story. But we are going to see chains with basically zero fees for users in the long term. The crypto world, whatever your thesis is, it will converge upon mean thousands of NFTs.
00:38:58.258 - 00:39:02.698, Speaker A: David, this sounds like deep. People just get addicted to this stuff.
00:39:02.784 - 00:39:23.774, Speaker B: Well, I mean, that's a real problem. I wouldn't think of thousands of collectibles. But we got a playing card here, right? So rare. And they're all your metaverse property that you. Yes, exactly. Your swords, your playing cards, your Pokemon, whatever you want. The whole point about crypto is that we get to make assets now.
00:39:23.774 - 00:39:30.898, Speaker B: That's our power, that's our superpower that we have. And now we get to explore that frontier of what assets can we make that are cool to make?
00:39:31.064 - 00:39:32.930, Speaker A: And it turns out people want thousands of them.
00:39:33.000 - 00:39:46.758, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. Not just like a crypto punk and a crypto dick butt, which is me. But all assets, all the assets. And so we need a wallet that can contain all of the assets. Yeah.
00:39:46.844 - 00:39:53.530, Speaker D: Yes, that's correct. It's actually really bad on polygon too. You can't really do anything on polygon without receiving a spam NFT.
00:39:55.150 - 00:40:00.410, Speaker C: Yeah, spam NFTs, I think, is the dark side of that coin.
00:40:03.950 - 00:40:09.258, Speaker D: Do you want to talk about the hidden collections and going back to this trust and safety discussion?
00:40:09.434 - 00:40:51.510, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff that I still want to talk about there's that the chat is asking when phantom token. So I guess I'll have to ask that token. But first guys, we have to cut to sponsors to help. Thank all these sponsors to help us go bankless in all of my years in crypto, I have never been hacked, scammed or lost money to a thief. And a lot of that credit goes to my Ledger hardware wallet. The Ledger Nano X and the Ledger Nanos plus hardware wallets allow users like you and me to secure and manage all of our crypto assets and our NFTs, all with the security of storing users'private keys offline and out of reach from hackers. The Ledger Nano X is the perfect hardware wallet for managing your crypto and NFTs on the go because it connects to your phone with Bluetooth and has a nice big screen for easy transaction readings.
00:40:51.510 - 00:41:25.234, Speaker B: Ledger has also upgraded the iconic Ledger Nanos and made the new Ledger Nanos device more DeFi and NFT friendly, making it the perfect hardware wallet for beginners. Ledger has truly maximized for both ease of use and security. So discover which Ledger device is best suited for your journey by going and visiting shop. Ledger.com. If you've been listening to Bankless, you know that we're fans of the modular Blockchain thesis. The idea that Blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus, allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves. And Fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry.
00:41:25.234 - 00:42:09.358, Speaker B: By supporting parallel transaction execution, fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web3 world. Fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the EVM with its own Fuel VM, which is more efficient and optimized, opening up the design space for developers. And lastly, Fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain specific language sway and a supportive tool chain called Fork. With Fuel, you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like Validity while adopting the improvements made by the Rust tooling ecosystem, letting the Fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the EVM. If you want to learn more, there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a Fuel network. The layer two era is upon us. Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need layer two bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live.
00:42:09.358 - 00:42:29.654, Speaker B: A layer two life. Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge. With across, you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across's bridges are powered by uma's, optimistic Oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer two S and Ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure. And across. V Two has just launched.
00:42:29.654 - 00:43:01.298, Speaker B: Their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency, layer two to layer two transfers, and a brand new chain with polygon, all while prioritizing high security and low fees. You can be a part of across its story by joining their discord and using across for all of your layer two transferring needs. So go to across to quickly and securely bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, polygon, arbitram, or Boba Networks. All right, bankless nation. We are back with the brand new Spiffy phantom wallet. And now we're going to start pressing some buttons. I think we're going to press some buttons in the Phantom Wallet.
00:43:01.298 - 00:43:05.720, Speaker B: I think we might buy some NFTs. Guys, what buttons should we press first?
00:43:06.970 - 00:43:08.386, Speaker D: Let's buy an ethnic.
00:43:08.498 - 00:43:09.138, Speaker B: Let's do it.
00:43:09.164 - 00:43:15.002, Speaker A: Wow. Which one? Yeah, that's the big question is which one? We going big. We going little.
00:43:15.056 - 00:43:17.098, Speaker B: Yeah, we're buying a CryptoPunk, right?
00:43:17.264 - 00:43:21.450, Speaker D: We came prepared. We have five, almost six E to spend.
00:43:21.600 - 00:43:23.402, Speaker A: Six e to spend big.
00:43:23.456 - 00:43:24.058, Speaker B: Spend.
00:43:24.224 - 00:43:28.586, Speaker A: Dare we ask the chat how much of a delay is there between the feed and the chat? Dave?
00:43:28.618 - 00:43:29.354, Speaker B: About 10 seconds.
00:43:29.402 - 00:43:34.298, Speaker A: Yeah, there's 10 seconds. All right, so if we ask chat, what NFT should we buy?
00:43:34.404 - 00:43:35.986, Speaker B: Oh, they're going to come running.
00:43:36.088 - 00:43:41.298, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. We should tweet it out. Let me tweet something out, actually.
00:43:41.384 - 00:43:42.706, Speaker B: Buy an NFT Live.
00:43:42.888 - 00:43:51.526, Speaker A: We have five. You're not going to spend it all. Budget your marketing budget, guys. Let's see. I'm going to live tweet this.
00:43:51.708 - 00:43:57.590, Speaker D: While you work on that. We can talk about how it works, I guess.
00:43:57.660 - 00:44:00.570, Speaker A: Yeah, tell us about how it works. Yeah, sorry.
00:44:00.720 - 00:44:29.986, Speaker D: So we're on blur. So blur is NFT marketplace or aggregator. So currently we're compatible with these MetaMask Connect buttons. We are working with people across the ecosystem, like the various Wallet Connect modal solutions to add ourselves, and we expect to be in a lot of them when we launch. But right now, I'm going to click MetaMask. It works.
00:44:30.088 - 00:44:34.900, Speaker B: That's tight. How does that work? What happens if you also have MetaMask loaded up, though?
00:44:35.450 - 00:44:50.634, Speaker D: It's a good question. So there isn't actually a good standard for this, so I believe it's the extension you install second that dominates wait.
00:44:50.672 - 00:44:53.034, Speaker B: You guys hijacked the MetaMask button.
00:44:53.232 - 00:44:55.338, Speaker D: This is pretty common practice, actually.
00:44:55.504 - 00:44:57.020, Speaker A: Wow, that's cool.
00:44:57.390 - 00:45:28.600, Speaker D: We might add an affordance. We don't want to ruin the experience, right? I mean, you should be able to use what wallet you want to use. And to be clear, if MetaMask is installed after Phantom, MetaMask does that to Phantom, and so there are affordances around letting you choose, but we haven't really built them yet, so yeah, you can see Priest interconnect experience. I'm signed in.
00:45:31.210 - 00:45:33.190, Speaker B: Oh, there's Tim Ferriss's, NFT.
00:45:33.690 - 00:45:47.210, Speaker D: While you guys figure out which one to buy, we can just show you this transaction simulation feature. So it might be too small on the screen, but I'm going to click Buy now on this floor. Pudgy penguin four point.
00:45:47.280 - 00:45:49.690, Speaker B: The Pudgy floor is at four. Good for the penguin.
00:45:52.290 - 00:46:25.634, Speaker D: It's actually the same experience that our Salana users are accustomed to. So we make it pretty simple. We just show you what you're receiving and what you're sending or what you're paying for it. So it says Pudgy Penguin number 2722, and then it shows you in red that you're paying 4.23 E for it. So this seems simple, but there's a lot going on behind the scenes. So the transaction is sort of being the transaction and the origin as well is sort of being scanned to make sure there's no mal intent.
00:46:25.634 - 00:46:56.658, Speaker D: It's making sure the website isn't a scam website. It's making sure there's not attempts to curtail the simulation, to get away with simulation. There's all this analysis going on in the background and if it had been a malicious transaction, you'd get this big red warning that says, hey, something's up. You may want to think twice about approving. So I don't know, Brand, if you want to add anything, maybe that's about how many people we save.
00:46:56.824 - 00:47:17.394, Speaker C: Yeah, so this is an interesting one, something that we're pretty proud of. Like Francesco said, this feature is live on the salon ecosystem at the moment. And yeah, it's actually having real impact. So as of today, we've actually saved users from over 18,000 wallet draining transactions.
00:47:17.522 - 00:47:18.246, Speaker A: Wow.
00:47:18.428 - 00:47:34.190, Speaker C: 18,000 different instances where someone was about to get fished into sending all their NFTs and tokens. We were actually able to prevent those. And in the last 30 days alone, we've saved around 3000 unique users.
00:47:34.850 - 00:47:37.360, Speaker A: Say it again for the regulators. How many is that?
00:47:37.730 - 00:48:06.760, Speaker C: Yeah, around 3000 unique users. And I mean, that's crazy because all of those users are very likely users that will never come back again if they get fished, you know what I mean? And so we're all trying so hard to bring all these users in and yeah, it's really up to everyone who's writing software in this space to provide a safe and easy to use environment and so to kind of retain people.
00:48:07.130 - 00:48:42.340, Speaker A: Here's another thing that's super important. Back to kind of philosophy for a second. By the way, I tweeted this out, guys, and put it in the bankless discord. So I'm getting some submissions in. I don't know what Chat saying about what NFT we should buy, but from a philosophy perspective okay. Part of the reason I think we got in the situation we did in 2022, where we trusted a whole bunch of centralized exchanges and actors and we let SBF steal $16 billion from crypto users in our industry, is because we didn't have the tools in place to go bankless. And some of that is on us.
00:48:42.340 - 00:49:35.294, Speaker A: Not all of it, but some of that is on us. We've been trying to talk about education, but when it's very difficult to get your crypto from an exchange and to start using a wallet to the extent that that's difficult, we will have money that is locked in centralized providers and we won't be able to actually live up to the full potential of this decentralized peer to peer money system. Like the reason we're all here. So we end up making compromises and sticking our funds in a celsius or a BlockFi because it's too hard. So to the extent that we are able to solve UX issues and keep it bankless, that is truly how we scale this industry. So I'm very bullish on tools like this. And this is like, back to a theme we can talk about FTX.
00:49:35.294 - 00:50:09.674, Speaker A: We're not doing a single FTX SBF episode this week. Right, David? And what we want to focus in on is how we're actually rebuild this industry. And tools like this are how we rebuild this industry on bankless principles. So I just want to hear from you guys again. So this is a noncustodial wallet, right? We're not giving up our private keys to any third party. There's no bankers in the middle, there's no SBF, there's no like, in your transaction set that you're trusting with your private keys. This is completely bankless.
00:50:09.674 - 00:50:19.330, Speaker A: Can you confirm that for me? It works the same way as MetaMask. It works fundamentally the same way as a ledger hardware wallet. Can you confirm that for me and talk about that for a minute?
00:50:20.230 - 00:51:02.400, Speaker C: Yeah, no, definitely consider that confirmed. So, yeah, Phantom at its core is a noncustodial crypto wallet that helps users self manage their crypto and not only store it and manage it safely, but also do stuff with it safely. And so, you know, Phantom turns your browser, your existing browser, existing mobile phone, into a crypto wallet and opens up a world of decentralized applications to users. And that's kind of really one of the core innovations of Web Three is the decentralized applications. And yeah, we really are aiming to provide safe and easy access to that.
00:51:03.010 - 00:51:16.100, Speaker A: Is this still seed phrase driven? Is there any kind of like social recovery type of aspect or is that kind of like out of reach for now? Because that's another piece that's difficult for people. Smart contract wallets have tried to solve anything on that.
00:51:16.470 - 00:52:04.580, Speaker C: So currently the key model is the same as MetaMask and where there is a secret recovery phrase that lives at the heart of the wallet in which you can derive a number of different addresses, we do support hardware wallets as well. So similar to MetaMask, you are able to plug in your ledger and also save that as an entry that you can use. But yeah, key recovery and key management is definitely a huge area that we want to be innovating on in the and things like count abstraction, social recovery, potentially smart contract, wallets, MPC, et cetera. Those are all things that are on the table for sure. And yeah, we're looking forward to pushing that forward.
00:52:05.430 - 00:52:18.502, Speaker A: All right, David, I think we bought us some time here. We ready to put together a quick list of shopping list? Yeah, shopping lists. I've got a few from my side. I'm monitoring discord and twitter. Do you have something to add?
00:52:18.556 - 00:52:39.162, Speaker B: Yeah, well, so from the chat, Pudgies have definitely come up. Crypto Covens, which I'm a huge fan of, has come up in the chat monoverse space, which I'm unfamiliar with, but if I could put my hat in the ring, I would 100% be down to purchase a crypto dickpod. The only NFP that matters.
00:52:39.226 - 00:52:55.746, Speaker A: Let me throw in my shopping list. And several people are typing as well. Stony's not heard of Stony's by Satoshi's mom. Might be low price though. Maybe there's that pudgy penguins came up on my side. Stonies are cheap. Okay, that's the discount aisle.
00:52:55.746 - 00:53:06.786, Speaker A: We can shop in podcast NFTs because of the bankless community. This is not a self submission cockpunch. Tim Ferriss was recently on the podcast.
00:53:06.898 - 00:53:08.520, Speaker B: Our NFT just came up.
00:53:09.070 - 00:53:10.970, Speaker D: Yeah, you're at front of here.
00:53:11.040 - 00:53:11.980, Speaker B: It's great.
00:53:15.230 - 00:53:17.274, Speaker A: And then Pooleys, by the way.
00:53:17.312 - 00:53:17.686, Speaker B: Coolies.
00:53:17.718 - 00:53:22.060, Speaker A: Go to a good cause. All right. Pooleys are do you guys know Pooleys with a Y.
00:53:25.650 - 00:53:26.154, Speaker B: Puffers?
00:53:26.202 - 00:53:26.510, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:26.580 - 00:53:32.426, Speaker B: So that's a pooley derivative. This is these are pooley MFR derivatives.
00:53:32.618 - 00:53:34.122, Speaker A: But we should do the OG Pooleys.
00:53:34.186 - 00:53:36.034, Speaker B: Yeah, I didn't see that one come up.
00:53:36.152 - 00:53:54.278, Speaker A: The reason is pulleys are cool because it goes to like pull together. Got a lawsuit and it goes to the defense fund. That'd be one. That'd be cool. Nars, have you heard of this chain runners? Anyway, we got a few options here.
00:53:54.364 - 00:53:55.686, Speaker D: Let's pick one or two.
00:53:55.788 - 00:53:58.440, Speaker A: Okay, we're getting greedy here.
00:53:59.690 - 00:54:01.690, Speaker B: Buy all of our NFTs.
00:54:02.350 - 00:54:06.198, Speaker A: We should do like relatively cheap ones, right? Crypto tick bots.
00:54:06.374 - 00:54:08.938, Speaker C: I can send some more. Ethan, if we're really you're ready to.
00:54:08.944 - 00:54:14.430, Speaker A: Buy, save your dollar. Your ETH, guys. Stake your ETH. Don't spend it.
00:54:14.500 - 00:54:20.846, Speaker D: My only ask is that it's profile picture friendly because we're going to show off a personalization feature later.
00:54:21.028 - 00:54:24.802, Speaker B: All right, well, David, I know a few people who have that as their.
00:54:24.856 - 00:54:30.420, Speaker A: PFP, but I will stop without shilling your bags. What do you think makes the most sense here? You're the NFT project.
00:54:30.790 - 00:54:43.510, Speaker B: Okay. So MFers are CCO Pooleys are good for a good cause. They're also cheap. I vote Pooleys puffers. PFRS cooley puffers. The ones we're looking at right now. Yeah.
00:54:43.580 - 00:54:45.510, Speaker A: Does this go to a good cause too?
00:54:45.660 - 00:54:49.158, Speaker B: I don't know, but the pooley meme does.
00:54:49.324 - 00:54:51.820, Speaker D: All right, you can buy a really nice one.
00:54:53.390 - 00:54:56.490, Speaker A: I don't know that it makes a difference. Does it? David.
00:54:59.630 - 00:55:01.338, Speaker D: This one resonates with me.
00:55:01.424 - 00:55:07.630, Speaker A: Oh, yeah? What do you think, uncle pink, white nerd glasses? Yeah, glasses are good.
00:55:07.700 - 00:55:08.698, Speaker B: Got to have the glasses.
00:55:08.794 - 00:55:09.754, Speaker A: Got to have the glasses.
00:55:09.802 - 00:55:10.398, Speaker D: Do it.
00:55:10.484 - 00:55:11.934, Speaker B: Seems like a fair price.
00:55:12.132 - 00:55:20.018, Speaker A: So we're buying this on Blur. We're approving the transaction right now on the Phantom Wallet, and then we wait.
00:55:20.104 - 00:55:20.814, Speaker D: Pending.
00:55:20.942 - 00:55:21.598, Speaker A: Pending.
00:55:21.694 - 00:55:22.734, Speaker B: Is that ethereum?
00:55:22.782 - 00:55:24.286, Speaker A: So it's in the phantom wallet.
00:55:24.478 - 00:55:31.750, Speaker D: This is from Blur, actually. All right, so, yeah, it's a good old fashioned e transaction.
00:55:32.170 - 00:55:33.960, Speaker A: Where are the gas fees on this?
00:55:34.330 - 00:55:36.338, Speaker D: How much have we spent? I don't not burn.
00:55:36.434 - 00:55:37.334, Speaker B: $6.
00:55:37.452 - 00:55:44.010, Speaker A: $6? How much did we burn? No, I'm kidding. That's awesome.
00:55:44.160 - 00:55:45.002, Speaker D: Just like that.
00:55:45.056 - 00:55:47.290, Speaker A: And now can we see it in the Phantom Wallet?
00:55:47.870 - 00:55:55.162, Speaker D: So you can see the balance went down. We should probably search for it since we also are power user pooley.
00:55:55.306 - 00:55:56.894, Speaker B: I think pfer is what you want.
00:55:56.932 - 00:55:57.566, Speaker D: Here they are.
00:55:57.668 - 00:56:00.302, Speaker B: Great. Wow, that happened so fast. That populated so quickly.
00:56:00.356 - 00:56:04.190, Speaker A: So it indexes, like, automatically. That's pretty magical.
00:56:04.690 - 00:56:14.580, Speaker C: Yeah. Since we just bought a brand new NFT, we can also pin it. So if you in the top, right, pin it now. If you go back to our page, it shows up right at the top.
00:56:15.130 - 00:56:23.590, Speaker A: So cool. All right, here's a challenge. Do you guys do sound NFTs. How would a sound NFT?
00:56:25.610 - 00:56:29.218, Speaker D: We can play it. It just won't appear. The image won't appear.
00:56:29.394 - 00:56:30.758, Speaker A: Okay. Right now.
00:56:30.844 - 00:56:31.686, Speaker C: Well, let's do it.
00:56:31.708 - 00:56:32.698, Speaker A: Let's see an example.
00:56:32.784 - 00:56:34.410, Speaker D: Can we have should we buy Bankless.
00:56:36.030 - 00:56:38.986, Speaker B: The only podcast NFTs that exist? Yeah.
00:56:39.168 - 00:56:41.962, Speaker D: You're not saying we should, though. Not saying that we shouldn't.
00:56:42.106 - 00:56:44.106, Speaker A: Crypto renaissance is solid.
00:56:44.298 - 00:56:45.546, Speaker B: A solid collectible.
00:56:45.658 - 00:56:47.070, Speaker D: All right. Solid collectible.
00:56:49.010 - 00:56:51.566, Speaker A: For Josh Rosenthal. This is great. Do you guys ever listen to this.
00:56:51.588 - 00:56:57.890, Speaker C: Episode, the Crypto Renaissance episode? Yeah, not yet.
00:56:57.960 - 00:56:59.586, Speaker B: There's a reason why we started that one.
00:56:59.688 - 00:57:06.310, Speaker A: They have the collectible. It's just I'm not going to say it's my favorite. It's my favorite.
00:57:08.570 - 00:57:09.030, Speaker D: Wow.
00:57:09.100 - 00:57:10.038, Speaker A: Already done.
00:57:10.204 - 00:57:11.478, Speaker D: Only $4.
00:57:11.644 - 00:57:16.674, Speaker A: $4. But that must seem really high for you guys, coming from the beautiful salon.
00:57:16.802 - 00:57:20.806, Speaker D: It is. Fractions of a cent on some polygon or on polygon.
00:57:20.918 - 00:57:26.838, Speaker A: We just bought a sound NFT podcast. Podcast NFT. The Crypto renaissance.
00:57:26.934 - 00:57:30.710, Speaker B: We just bought our own collectible while live streaming. We're totally getting it. Liz warned.
00:57:30.790 - 00:57:33.162, Speaker A: Well, we didn't what's the name of.
00:57:33.216 - 00:57:36.880, Speaker C: Oh, it was there. Just search. Oh, here we go.
00:57:37.490 - 00:57:41.870, Speaker D: So, yeah, the preview actually shows up. I can play it for the audience.
00:57:43.670 - 00:57:45.074, Speaker B: Oh, wow. The sound is coming through.
00:57:45.112 - 00:57:53.570, Speaker A: The sound's coming through. Is everyone hearing that or is it just drop the beat. Keep playing.
00:57:56.410 - 00:57:59.490, Speaker B: The Phantom Wallet is already music NFT enabled.
00:57:59.650 - 00:58:00.534, Speaker C: That's correct.
00:58:00.652 - 00:58:03.000, Speaker B: Wow. Truly, it's happy now?
00:58:03.930 - 00:58:05.560, Speaker D: We made a return on it.
00:58:06.730 - 00:58:09.170, Speaker B: Oh, because we bumped the floor price. Because we bought the floor.
00:58:09.330 - 00:58:12.860, Speaker A: But this tracks the returns from what market is this feeding from?
00:58:13.790 - 00:58:21.534, Speaker D: I believe it's feeding from a few marketplaces. This is the floor. So if you were to sell the empty for the floor, we just increased the floor by buying it.
00:58:21.652 - 00:58:23.242, Speaker B: Nice job, Bankless.
00:58:23.306 - 00:58:33.166, Speaker A: Pumping our bank and by being on the bankless podcast. Right. This is so cool. Well done, guys.
00:58:33.348 - 00:58:39.410, Speaker D: Thanks. I just wanted to show off one final thing, which is we bought this pooley before going to set it as our avatar.
00:58:41.350 - 00:58:50.946, Speaker B: And what was that useful for? That just shows. So you just know which wallet it is. You can just make it more. This is my gaming wallet and this is my NFT collection wallet.
00:58:51.058 - 00:58:53.554, Speaker A: Totally burner addresses.
00:58:53.602 - 00:59:05.450, Speaker D: I think one of the hard things with MultiChain is there's a lot of addresses to manage, actually, and I think a lot of people rely on skimming their raw address to know which wallet it is.
00:59:05.600 - 00:59:11.470, Speaker A: I have some memorized, not like the full thing, but I know the four digits in the front and the back.
00:59:11.540 - 00:59:34.340, Speaker D: Yeah, totally. Yeah, exactly. And it's a bit harder when you have three addresses to one account, quote unquote. So we've done a lot of user research and have gone pretty extensive lengths to make this easier. So, yeah, using as many visual cues as you can, so you can name it, you can set a profile picture to it just so you remember which one it is.
00:59:36.470 - 00:59:59.194, Speaker A: That is super good. I would remind folks, like our analogy for an address. Crypto wallet address, your public key. It's basically like your bank account number, right? Then you can put other property into it. So it's almost like a bank vault. But how many of you know your bank account number? That's on the bottom of a checkbook that you have? Nobody knows that. That's the point.
00:59:59.194 - 01:00:23.330, Speaker A: You shouldn't have to. It should be abstracted away from you. All right, so now it's the part where we get to ask you guys, the problem for everybody watching this episode is that this is not yet released, but that will change. And when is that going to change? When is this going to be live on ethereum and polygon?
01:00:25.430 - 01:00:26.690, Speaker D: You got it, Brendan.
01:00:27.610 - 01:00:58.282, Speaker C: Yeah, so, yeah, pretty excited to say that in the next few weeks, 2022 before holidays. Before the holidays, right. We will have not live to everyone, but we will have an experience where you can go and if you download the normal the production phantom app, you can enter in a beta code and sort of evolve it from a Monochain wallet to a MultiChain wallet and use it in this beta phase through the holidays.
01:00:58.426 - 01:01:07.134, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So let's be clear on what people need to do. So they should go to the phantom AppList slash waitlist site or follow us.
01:01:07.172 - 01:01:10.130, Speaker D: On Twitter, because we'll be releasing the beta codes on Twitter, too.
01:01:10.200 - 01:01:14.340, Speaker A: And then you release beta codes on Twitter. Do you have a beta code right now that you can.
01:01:16.070 - 01:01:21.558, Speaker D: Oh, well, we could. It's not actual right now, though, because we haven't okay, okay.
01:01:21.724 - 01:01:24.534, Speaker C: But we can create a bankless code for you guys.
01:01:24.572 - 01:01:35.066, Speaker A: Can we just do a bankless code so that people don't even. Have to remember, if they watch this episode and they listen to it, then they could just go to this phantom app, waitlist, and type in Bankless and they get this.
01:01:35.168 - 01:01:37.340, Speaker D: We can just make one up now. It's like, yes.
01:01:37.870 - 01:01:40.342, Speaker C: So for sure we can do one that's called Just Bankless.
01:01:40.406 - 01:01:48.350, Speaker A: Just Bankless. Awesome. And then what are they downloading? Do they have to hit the download button for it to convert?
01:01:49.170 - 01:02:00.110, Speaker D: So you just download the normal apps, nothing special. And then there will be a beta code redemption flow and just go from there. Phantom app slash download.
01:02:00.270 - 01:02:05.620, Speaker B: Guys, I just got the Twitter bot notification that a Bankless NFT was sold, so thank you.
01:02:06.730 - 01:02:07.622, Speaker D: You're welcome.
01:02:07.756 - 01:02:15.814, Speaker A: Supporting a show. No, this is great. Do we have to ask? Does the chat want to know anything else?
01:02:15.852 - 01:02:19.014, Speaker B: David, is there going to be a phantom token ever?
01:02:19.132 - 01:02:29.270, Speaker C: Okay, that's a good question. Something that we could talk about probably for a while, but in the short to medium term, we don't have any plans to do a token.
01:02:29.350 - 01:02:29.980, Speaker A: Okay.
01:02:32.430 - 01:02:33.770, Speaker C: I can elaborate.
01:02:34.110 - 01:02:35.100, Speaker A: That's fine.
01:02:35.410 - 01:02:35.774, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:02:35.812 - 01:02:47.170, Speaker C: I think that right now we're pretty much laser focused on making sure that the user experience is as safe and easy to use as possible before overcomplicating things.
01:02:47.320 - 01:03:15.238, Speaker A: I think people are a little tired yeah. Token fatigue for a while, so that's perfectly okay. We're in the build market now, not in the token market. So, guys, thanks so much for joining us. I'm really glad. This is great news for the entire crypto community and really excited to see that you guys are coming back home, as you said, and deploying here.
