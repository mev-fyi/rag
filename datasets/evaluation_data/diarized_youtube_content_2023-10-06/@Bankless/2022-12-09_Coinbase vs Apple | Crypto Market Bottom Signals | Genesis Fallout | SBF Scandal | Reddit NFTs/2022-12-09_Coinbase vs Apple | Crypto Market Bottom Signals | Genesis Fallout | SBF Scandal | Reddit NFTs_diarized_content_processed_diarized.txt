00:00:00.250 - 00:00:22.282, Speaker A: This is one of these tweets where, like, I wonder I just sit and pause and be like, who the hell is this? Ryan sean Adams. Man My mind goes to, like, all right, he's an AI, so he just, like, did Google searching and came up with this, so that would that's just normal. Or he's a Taylor Swift fan and, like, have this one ready to go. Or he's a dad of a of a teenage daughter.
00:00:22.346 - 00:00:39.014, Speaker B: It could be all three things at once. We just don't know. And I think you have to be comfortable, David, if we're going to continue this podcast every week, is living in that know, like, you just don't really know. Bankless Nation. Happy second Friday of the month. David tell them what time it is.
00:00:39.132 - 00:00:54.062, Speaker A: Oh, it's the Friday Bankless Weekly roll up, where we cover the entire weekly news in this goddamn bear market, which is an especially ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless, no matter what corner of the globe we're tuning in from, which is a little bit different for me this week. Ryan yeah.
00:00:54.116 - 00:00:54.922, Speaker B: You're west coast.
00:00:54.986 - 00:01:01.358, Speaker A: You went west coast. David's back. Yeah. Back in beautiful city of Diego. Yeah.
00:01:01.444 - 00:01:01.742, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:01.796 - 00:01:05.018, Speaker A: Much to the demise of my mother that I didn't decide to go back to Seattle.
00:01:05.114 - 00:01:11.700, Speaker B: Yeah, you went a little south of your you know, she could always meet you in San Diego, right? It could be a rendezvous point.
00:01:12.070 - 00:01:13.922, Speaker A: Yeah. That would be insulting to her.
00:01:13.976 - 00:01:28.818, Speaker B: Okay, so the intro, though, you said bear market, but we sounded so upbeat and enthusiastic, and I felt some energy. Feel. Okay. Do you know how I feel coming to this episode, David, is like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.
00:01:28.914 - 00:01:29.430, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:01:29.500 - 00:01:33.078, Speaker B: I feel light. November was not a great month for crypto.
00:01:33.174 - 00:01:37.146, Speaker A: No. That could have been the worst month ever. In fact, do you know how you.
00:01:37.168 - 00:01:42.218, Speaker B: Feel, like, after you say you feel after you fast for a couple of days, you got kind of the energy.
00:01:42.384 - 00:01:46.046, Speaker A: I don't know if you I call it my manic. David yeah.
00:01:46.148 - 00:01:46.602, Speaker B: Manic.
00:01:46.666 - 00:01:47.774, Speaker A: In a good way. In a good way.
00:01:47.812 - 00:02:02.258, Speaker B: Yeah. Once in a while not in a Kanye West way, but once in a while, you'll DM me and you'll be like, I got some ideas. I'm like, okay, it's manic. David and I don't say that. I'm like, it's fasted. David anyway, same thing. How I feel.
00:02:02.258 - 00:02:06.018, Speaker B: I feel like we've got detoxed, and I'm just feeling, even though it's a.
00:02:06.024 - 00:02:14.822, Speaker A: Bear market, clarity and thought, like, long term time horizons, just like fundamental optimism. Yeah. Okay. All right.
00:02:14.876 - 00:02:18.054, Speaker B: Excited about 2023? Are you feeling that vibe, or is it just me?
00:02:18.172 - 00:02:31.862, Speaker A: I want to get to 2023 so bad. Not because time is a construct, but I don't know. January 1, 2023. Can we get there, please? Because then everything just goes away and we just reset. Right?
00:02:31.936 - 00:02:35.210, Speaker B: All right. Yeah, it goes away. We could forget in jail.
00:02:35.370 - 00:02:38.346, Speaker A: Crypto prices are up. Only this is what I'm promised.
00:02:38.538 - 00:02:48.514, Speaker B: We get some sensible regulation for DFI pass. Vitalik is elected president. No, he can't. He's Canadian. I don't know, man. A lot of good things. Maybe in 2023.
00:02:48.514 - 00:02:51.298, Speaker B: We'll see. All right, let's talk about the topics of the week, though.
00:02:51.384 - 00:02:54.370, Speaker A: This is the state in the bear market where we just make shit up, dude.
00:02:55.190 - 00:03:06.422, Speaker B: No, this is a real thing that happened. Apple versus coinbase. Apple thinks it can tax crypto. David, who's going to tell them? Who's going to tell them that they can't tax ETH gas fees? We're going to talk about that.
00:03:06.556 - 00:03:34.302, Speaker A: No one seems to be able to tell Apple no. Which is kind of the crazy thing. So we have to talk about that. Also, we got some data, some fallout, some actual numbers to talk about when it comes to contagion out of Genesis and Gemini Earn. So we will give you the numbers that we heard that was reported. And then also coming in hot, you'll never guess, Ryan, who SBF hired as a lawyer. I kind of feel like this whole SBF story is coming to a close.
00:03:34.302 - 00:03:50.018, Speaker A: I might have said that before on previous roll ups, but last week we were confused as to what the hell SBF was doing on his public tour of talking to everyone. Now I feel like we kind of know what he's up to, and we've got some clarity there. So that's what's coming up in the big News of the week.
00:03:50.104 - 00:04:11.686, Speaker B: And he's got his lawyer. You don't hire a lawyer when things are going well, so we'll see who that is in the show. You'll never guess the name. Pretty crazy, actually. Hey, but before we get into it, got to shout out our friends and sponsors at Opolis who have a very special message for the bankless nation. They want to provide you with health care going into 2023. That's real important if you're a contractor.
00:04:11.686 - 00:04:17.982, Speaker B: If you're working for a Dow, tell them what Opolis is and what are they offering today for bankless listeners, because.
00:04:18.036 - 00:04:36.770, Speaker A: Of the burdens of nation state employment and other things in this life that we live, things like health care, things like payroll taxes. Working on the frontier of Web three is difficult. How? As a Dow worker or as an NFT artist or as, I don't know, a yield farmer, do you podcaster?
00:04:37.590 - 00:04:38.482, Speaker B: Well, yeah.
00:04:38.616 - 00:05:17.066, Speaker A: If you don't have a company that you work for but you're making money, how do you get healthcare? Healthcare in the United States is super expensive, especially as an individual. So Opolis is a co op for all the web3 workers on the frontier who want to band together in web3 fashion to come. And Opolis will negotiate for advantaged rates on your behalf. Opolis, it's a co op. So that means when you sign up for Opolis, you also become an owner of Opolis. And Opolis just does things to help you with your burdensome, nation state infrastructure that you need again, health care, payroll taxes, all this kind of stuff. And there is a link in the show notes to get started.
00:05:17.066 - 00:05:33.826, Speaker A: And if you get started, if you get going with Opolis by December 31 of 2022, so that's like 20 days, you will get 1000 work, the token for Opolis and 1000 bank tokens. So allow Opolis to help you do what you do best, which is explore the frontier.
00:05:33.938 - 00:05:50.582, Speaker B: But with healthcare web, three workers unite. That's what we need a lot to build and so we need a lot of work to get done. David, let's talk about markets before we get into building. What is Bitcoin looking at this week? We got the happy music or sad bitcoin.
00:05:50.726 - 00:05:56.574, Speaker A: This got no music. It is flat. It is super flat on the week. Down 0%.
00:05:56.692 - 00:05:58.030, Speaker B: Like literally 0%.
00:05:58.100 - 00:06:01.294, Speaker A: Yeah, it came pretty damn close to 0%. Yeah.
00:06:01.412 - 00:06:03.314, Speaker B: And so what is that? What number are we looking at?
00:06:03.352 - 00:06:07.362, Speaker A: About 17. Oh, yeah, the number 17,000. $17,000.
00:06:07.416 - 00:06:12.820, Speaker B: Bitcoin 17,000 even. That's pretty crazy. How about ETH, up or down?
00:06:13.270 - 00:06:23.782, Speaker A: Sad sounds for ETH. Down two and a half percent started the week at 1290, ending the week where it currently is at 1250, although it is surging as of this morning, up to 1257.
00:06:23.916 - 00:06:28.134, Speaker B: All right, well, I can calculate the ratio in my head. I bet it's down two and a half percent. Am I right?
00:06:28.172 - 00:06:37.402, Speaker A: That's about right. That's the correct math. This is math that I can understand. Yeah. Ratio is down about two and a half percent on the week. We are down to zero 74.
00:06:37.536 - 00:06:57.300, Speaker B: No real signal right now. We're just hanging out in December. This is really interesting. A flat week is interesting in these types of markets. So do we feel like this is consistent with what we believe has been the case where the last domino has kind of fallen or it's wobbled and we kind of know the contagion that's already happened and we're getting into this flat period of time? What do you think?
00:06:58.310 - 00:07:07.362, Speaker A: Sorry, I just got distracted by trading View because I have it open on my phone. ETH just pumped to 1283. So we are only down 1.5% on the week.
00:07:07.416 - 00:07:10.674, Speaker B: Ryan, again, none of this will matter.
00:07:10.712 - 00:07:13.158, Speaker A: By the time you why do we do this?
00:07:13.244 - 00:07:20.620, Speaker B: I don't know, but we're going to keep doing it every week. We'll tell you 24 hours out of date numbers and you could enjoy them or not.
00:07:22.590 - 00:07:39.274, Speaker A: Is this emblematic of so? Yeah, bad news, but it's going on still. Everyone hates crypto, regulation, all that stuff, but prices are flat. I feel like that's a pretty acceptable sign of strength. Bad news, but flat prices equals some signal of strength.
00:07:39.322 - 00:07:51.042, Speaker B: Yeah, flat prices better than down prices. That's the kind of analysis you guys tune in for every week. All right. We are under a trillion, too. What's the crypto market cap give us those numbers.
00:07:51.096 - 00:08:04.134, Speaker A: David, can you hit refresh? So we're at 884,000,000,000. If Ryan hits refresh, 889,000,000,000. Look, we just added 5 billion onto the market cap, putting us at flat on the week, because last week it was 890,000,000,000 flat on the week.
00:08:04.172 - 00:08:30.378, Speaker B: There we go. Flat, flat, flat. It's a flat week, which is okay in a bear market to have it's better than the alternative. David, we've got to talk a little bit about the bottom signals because that's really what folks are listening to. And I think we've talked about it in the section of markets the last couple of roll ups, and we got some more bottom signaly stuff. You decide, are these bottom signals or not? You don't really know until they're like, for sure a bottom. But some hypothesis.
00:08:30.378 - 00:08:55.286, Speaker B: The ultimate bottom signal caller is Jim Kramer. If he tells you to sell, you better. It's probably a bottom. And Jim Kramer, of course, this is the host of Mad Money who you know and love, the great stock predictor. He says investors should exit crypto in quotes. It's never too late to sell, is what Jim says. I don't know.
00:08:55.286 - 00:08:59.558, Speaker B: I'm super bullish after I'm hearing this from Jim Kramer. What's your take on this?
00:08:59.644 - 00:09:34.002, Speaker A: So crypto, Twitter, and Just FinTwit just makes so much fun of Jim Kramer because he is the herd. He is the herd mentality. He is the middle of the curve, and he told people to buy coin at 450 when it IPOed. He has all of these terribly wrong takes. And actually, if you think about it, Ryan, his business model for Mad Money makes sense because he's trying to get attention eyeballs. Yeah, it's not about if you are contrarian. You don't want to be a contrarian as somebody who's trying to get eyeballs as, like, a TV show.
00:09:34.002 - 00:09:39.142, Speaker A: Right. You want to dish out what everyone wants to hear. If you're trying to have maximum reach.
00:09:39.196 - 00:09:41.410, Speaker B: Maximum, you want to have consensus opinion.
00:09:41.490 - 00:09:57.850, Speaker A: You want to have consensus opinion. And that if you just have consensus opinion in the markets, you're not going to do well. Being smart in the markets is about having contrarian bets. So this is not just a meme. This is like it's aligned with his business model for Mad Money. So Jim Kramer urges investors to exit crypto. It's never too late to sell.
00:09:57.850 - 00:10:00.358, Speaker A: If you want to be a contrarian, you would do the opposite.
00:10:00.454 - 00:10:10.282, Speaker B: I actually think that's a good take on Jim Kramer. It's not that he's always wrong. It's just that he is emblematic of consensus opinion. And this is consensus opinion.
00:10:10.346 - 00:10:11.806, Speaker A: He says, because his takes change every.
00:10:11.828 - 00:10:20.578, Speaker B: Two weeks, it's never too late to sell. An awful position. And that's what you have if you own these so called digital assets, an awful position.
00:10:20.744 - 00:10:24.434, Speaker A: Lumping every single digital asset together, they're all the same.
00:10:24.472 - 00:10:31.894, Speaker B: And it's never too late. I mean, this is how people get totally wrecked on the dips here. Anyway, maybe a bottom signal. Here's another one, david, what are we looking at here?
00:10:32.012 - 00:11:01.946, Speaker A: Just 8% of Americans have a positive view of cryptocurrencies. Now, a CNBC survey finds this is published on December 7. On Wednesday. When I read this article, Ryan, I was just so reminded of 2018, of just, like, positive view of crypto in 2017. Very negative view of crypto in 2018. It's just consensus, it's just the herd mentality. So if you're telling me that only 8% of Americans have positive views of crypto, that just sounds like a bottom signal.
00:11:01.946 - 00:11:11.090, Speaker A: And of course, the survey is happening right after FTX. People are just thinking about crypto for the first time in months and they're like, oh, yeah, FTX is bad, therefore crypto is bad.
00:11:11.160 - 00:11:41.066, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I have a more negative view of crypto, I would say probably over the past month if you ask me this poll, but that doesn't mean I'm not long term bullish. And by the way, this number is 8%. Now, it was 19% in March, so we got our own haviting here. Little cut in half. This is pretty consistent, I think, with the conversation. It's also consistent with pricing and everything else is what you'd start to expect as we hit towards the bottom. 8%.
00:11:41.066 - 00:11:52.238, Speaker B: I'm still okay, 8% have a positive view. That's the silver lining. That's not too bad. Chance you guys know what crypto is, at least. What's this chart we're looking at?
00:11:52.324 - 00:12:18.658, Speaker A: Yeah, this is the new record low of the GBTC discount. So buying one share of the Grayscale bitcoin Trust is 47% discounted to how many bitcoins is backing it? So in theory, if you could redeem those bitcoins and you bought one bitcoin's worth of the GBTC trust, now you would get roughly 1.5 bitcoins if you could redeem them, but you can't.
00:12:18.834 - 00:12:28.170, Speaker B: If Mr. Gensler will convert that to an ETF, then you should be able to redeem it. So this is some sort of regulatory I don't know what you call that. Tom Foolery.
00:12:30.270 - 00:12:33.926, Speaker A: If you have the longest term time horizons, could be a goodbye.
00:12:34.038 - 00:12:46.420, Speaker B: It could be not financial advice. You know, we did an entire episode on GBDC. So if folks you're wondering what GBDC is, your thesis, David, is that GBDC is what started this whole thing.
00:12:48.470 - 00:12:55.298, Speaker A: It is the thing that really started the bull market, so you can't really be too angry. But then also the reason why it all came crashing down.
00:12:55.384 - 00:13:00.614, Speaker B: Yeah, it's the first domino. Anyway, there's an episode what's that episode titled? What did we end up calling that?
00:13:00.812 - 00:13:11.386, Speaker A: The thumbnail is grayscale and Genesis contagion. But we renamed it to was 2021. Just a gigantic ponzi. Which for the answer is kind of.
00:13:11.408 - 00:13:20.022, Speaker B: Yes, you're supposed to tease, not give them the answer. Okay. But yes, it was a ponzi. Okay, what's this? What's this chart that we're looking at?
00:13:20.096 - 00:13:26.170, Speaker A: This is the coin price. The coinbase coin token. Jesus stock.
00:13:26.250 - 00:13:31.066, Speaker B: Yes, the traditional tokens, David.
00:13:31.178 - 00:13:38.210, Speaker A: Yeah. Which Coinbase is coming in at a whopping $9 billion total market cap valuation.
00:13:39.270 - 00:13:42.530, Speaker B: Dollars for you mean whopping like that's so low.
00:13:42.600 - 00:13:43.218, Speaker A: Bad.
00:13:43.384 - 00:13:45.582, Speaker B: Yeah, that's so low. 9 billion.
00:13:45.646 - 00:13:46.498, Speaker A: Extremely low.
00:13:46.584 - 00:13:50.486, Speaker B: Don't we have, like, alternative layer ones that are way higher than $9 billion right now?
00:13:50.508 - 00:14:06.662, Speaker A: Right. Coinbase, for context, uniswap coming in at what's the uniswap price? I think like six. And at $6 and a quarter, that is a valuation of about $6 billion. So Coinbase is 50% more valued than uniswap.
00:14:06.806 - 00:14:15.290, Speaker B: And uni Token doesn't even have any legal guarantees on investor protections.
00:14:15.370 - 00:14:24.480, Speaker A: Yes, right. And Coin uni reminder that DeFi tokens are just tokens and we don't know what they are.
00:14:25.490 - 00:14:47.190, Speaker B: Well, there's hope. And by the way, there's news of more discussion about uni token fees being flipped on. But also, that is really close. I mean, wouldn't it be crazy if uniswap token price flipped from a market cap perspective? Coin, what does that mean? Does this mean Coin is, like, silly low or what does this mean?
00:14:47.260 - 00:14:56.294, Speaker A: Coin is silly low? Coin is silly low. I think the equity of Coinbase is going to outperform 99% of tokens that you see on Coin. Gecko.
00:14:56.342 - 00:15:01.274, Speaker B: Let me put it this way. Jim Kramer would be telling you to sell your coin right now. Let me put it that way.
00:15:01.312 - 00:15:02.570, Speaker A: It's not too late.
00:15:03.070 - 00:15:19.906, Speaker B: It's not too late to sell your coin. Speaking of all of these token prices, one of the things our analyst team at Bankless puts together is what we call the Bankless Token Bible. And this is kind of an analyst in a box service if you're a Bankless Premium member. I'm actually showing some of it here.
00:15:19.928 - 00:15:21.982, Speaker A: But this is usually Brian's leaking the alpha.
00:15:22.046 - 00:15:40.390, Speaker B: I shouldn't be leaking this alpha. In fact, I'll flip off the page. But this is like a master spreadsheet of our overweight underweight kind of scores from our analyst team. And you can sort of see why. It's kind of a beta version of the product of what it will be in the next launch of our Bankless 20 website and everything.
00:15:40.460 - 00:15:42.422, Speaker A: One of many 2.0 launches.
00:15:42.486 - 00:16:01.866, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's something I wanted to just shout out because our team is doing a fantastic job. And I don't think we talk about this very often, but you can click in through balancer. And look, right now this is all just like Google Doc pages, so you can see how it's kind of raw underweight for aptos. Why are we underweight for aptos?
00:16:01.978 - 00:16:06.590, Speaker A: Oh, I don't know. Let's go read about it and see what Ben, the analyst put into the doc.
00:16:06.670 - 00:16:27.606, Speaker B: That's right. Ben, by the way, is a fantastic analyst on our team. He's where we get all of our DeFi alpha. Anyway, we have that all available to Branklist Premium members, so it's just a shout out to upgrade so you can see what that looks like. And all of this will be redesigning our new website. Speaking of token, prices. David, let's talk about this.
00:16:27.606 - 00:16:58.814, Speaker B: This was a tweet I saw from Jacob Franick, and this is a tweet about stablecoin market cap. All right? So about a year ago, February 27, we had $166,000,000,000 worth of stablecoins on chain issued, and this is all this kind of stable coins, right? So centralized decentralized. December 4, 139,000,000,000. So down not by a dramatic amount, but down by about, like, what, 25 billion? Something like 27, 27 billion. David did the math.
00:16:58.862 - 00:16:59.762, Speaker A: I did the math there.
00:16:59.816 - 00:17:23.546, Speaker B: It's interesting that BUSD is the stablecoin that's growing, the only stablecoin that's growing, not contracting. But what was more interesting to me about this is do you remember Jim Bianco's thesis? So Jim Bianco, repeat bankless podcast friend and just fantastic views on traditional markets, but also knows an incredible amount about crypto and DeFi and really digs in.
00:17:23.648 - 00:17:25.260, Speaker A: He's an S tier individual.
00:17:26.030 - 00:17:39.678, Speaker B: I love Jim Bianco. Go follow Jim Bianco on Twitter. Jim, if you're listening, man, we appreciate you. He had kind of a thesis he actually asked our opinion on. And I was like, I don't know, Jim. That sounds right. You should write more about this.
00:17:39.678 - 00:18:10.006, Speaker B: His thesis was DeFi. The liquidity for DeFi is through stablecoin. So if you want to measure kind of the economic bandwidth of DFI, right? We'll put it another way. If you want DFI to grow, stablecoin market cap has to grow. And so we have about $140,000,000,000 of stablecoin economic bandwidth in DFI. And if we want to ten x DFI, we need to ten X the.
00:18:10.028 - 00:18:15.542, Speaker A: Stablecoin value, and specifically ten x DFI prices, to be specific.
00:18:15.676 - 00:18:16.510, Speaker B: DFI prices.
00:18:16.530 - 00:18:44.418, Speaker A: He was saying DFI token prices. Like all things like liquidity, liquidity is the underlying foundation, which makes sense, especially after we've done all of our Federal Reserve macro episodes. Everyone is like, yeah, the markets are addicted to liquidity. When we're pulling liquidity out of the market, everything's selling. So it makes sense. Along those lines, if you give more stablecoin liquidity to DeFi, yields go up, token prices go up, everything else above it goes up.
00:18:44.504 - 00:19:18.110, Speaker B: So, first of all, GM or some other talented listener should do some analysis on this and run the data and do some kind of models with historical data and see to what extent this has played out and what the correlation is. But also, I'm interested to look at this over time as sort of a leading indicator. If you want to see DFI start to recover, we might need to see that stablecoin value on chain tick up and hit from 140,000,000,000, 200 billion, 300 billion. This might be some kind of a bullish sign to precede a run up. Anyway, good thesis there.
00:19:18.180 - 00:19:23.780, Speaker A: Yeah. Jim, if you're wondering what an S tier individual is, s is above a S stands for super.
00:19:25.670 - 00:19:32.994, Speaker B: I'm glad you explained that for me. The trend continues. People are going bankless. David, what's this?
00:19:33.112 - 00:20:00.358, Speaker A: Yeah, Will Clemente says tweets out over the last 30 days, 200,000 bitcoins reminder out of 21,200,000 bitcoins worth $3.4 billion has been moved off exchanges. I don't think there's ever been a greater migration of bitcoins or probably value in general, off of centralized exchanges into custody wallet. Well, even before Mount Gosk's.
00:20:00.374 - 00:20:00.506, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:00.528 - 00:20:01.754, Speaker A: Like, you can't even see yeah.
00:20:01.792 - 00:20:05.294, Speaker B: All the red here. Well, this is yeah, I think you're right.
00:20:05.412 - 00:20:07.294, Speaker A: Well, that's because it's measured in dollars.
00:20:07.412 - 00:20:09.902, Speaker B: Yeah. More in bitcoin, but dollars. You're right.
00:20:09.956 - 00:20:10.222, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:10.276 - 00:20:19.250, Speaker B: Wow. Biggest red over time we've ever seen. That's incredible. I mean, people are just like, I don't trust exchanges. See you later, self custody, going bankless.
00:20:20.630 - 00:20:39.382, Speaker A: It's not how I wanted it to happen, but okay. So I saw these two Tweets out of Token terminal that I wanted to include in here. So this is developer activity overlaid by price for two ecosystems. First, we're looking at Cosmos developer activity. Looks like the start of a bull run. It starts to look like a very healthy line up.
00:20:39.436 - 00:20:40.230, Speaker B: That's the green line.
00:20:40.300 - 00:20:41.014, Speaker A: That's the green line.
00:20:41.052 - 00:20:45.754, Speaker B: It's a steady kind of upward trajectory over the last two years.
00:20:45.872 - 00:21:04.258, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And then, I mean, we all know the price. The price is largely uncorrelated, although the Cosmos token actually is kind of like up and to the right. It has this middle chunk, which is definitely a manic bull market. But now we're at the trend that it was before the bull market in 2019 to 2020.
00:21:04.344 - 00:21:07.426, Speaker B: Not manic, just fully fasted and full of energy.
00:21:07.528 - 00:21:38.746, Speaker A: Jesus, let me tell you, I was not fasting during the bull market. And then, so we can flip over to we can compare this to the Ethereum chart, which is the next Tweet. Ethereum actually saw, for some reason, a drop off in developer activity in the last couple of months or so. But you can get this overlaid developer activity still over the long term, absolute all time highs. And the ETH price is at a very much higher floor than it was in 2018. I just thought these were interesting.
00:21:38.848 - 00:22:10.754, Speaker B: I think they're interesting. Now, my big question in this, if you want to get to kind of the second question is, okay, but does your atom token map to developers in the Cosmos ecosystem? Because this is like it's not the Empire model that Ethereum is where all value flows back to ETH, the token. Right. Because of the mechanism designed for Cosmos, it's not necessarily true in any respect that all value leads back to the atom token. It could accrue in other app chains inside of Cosmos.
00:22:10.802 - 00:22:20.962, Speaker A: Right. Which is the bullcase of the Cosmos thesis, is that the value does accrue elsewhere, and that's exactly the big advantages and selling points of the Cosmos ecosystem.
00:22:21.026 - 00:22:38.842, Speaker B: Exactly. Which is why, of course, you have to understand this space in order to you can't take a Jim Kramer level. We're picking on Jim today. You can't take a Jim Cramer level analysis. Look at these two charts, and be like, well, it means this because this number is going up here. It means this number and this other ecosystem. You have to think about it more fully.
00:22:38.842 - 00:22:42.030, Speaker B: David, what else we got coming up next, my friend?
00:22:42.100 - 00:23:18.822, Speaker A: Coming up next, coinbase versus Apple. Does Apple even understand crypto? Do they even care? A lot of people seem to be going up against Apple. How many more until it takes for something to happen there? I don't know, but we're going to talk about it. And then we got some data out of Genesis and Gemini Earn to share and SBF. Of course, we got to tie the bow on the SBF conversation because like I said in the intro, I finally feel like we know what SBF is up to. Or at least I'll give my takes. All this stuff and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web Three landscape.

00:24:59.808 - 00:25:17.986, Speaker B: Coinbase and Apple in a head to Head Apple wanting to tax DeFi transactions and crypto transactions and Coinbase not liking it. David, you have the Tweet thread here. Let's look at Coinbase's position on things and give some of our takes. What's Coinbase saying? Yeah.
00:25:18.008 - 00:25:44.298, Speaker A: So they tweeted out of the coinbase wallet. So this is from the Coinbase wallet, not Coinbase? Yeah. So important. Small, differentiator. You might have noticed you can't send NFTs on the Coinbase iOS wallet anymore. This is because Apple blocked our last app release until we disabled the feature of being able the feature of being able to send NFTs. Apple was like, you guys have to block that before you update your app.
00:25:44.384 - 00:26:11.394, Speaker B: Okay, so Coinbase Wallet is like a non custodial, self custodial wallet. It's a bankless wallet. It's not their full custodial solution. We're talking about the wallet just like MetaMask, only on your phone, mobile, and this basic functionality of sending an NFT from one place to another, just like sending an ERC 20 or ETH from one place to another, sending stable coins, making a payment, they had to disable that because Apple blocked them.
00:26:11.512 - 00:26:32.810, Speaker A: Yes, because the apple says you guys have to block that feature before we allow you guys to push that app update. The Tweet thread continues and says, apple's claim is that the gas fee required to send NFTs need to be paid through their in app purchase system so they can collect 30% of the gas fee.
00:26:35.070 - 00:26:35.820, Speaker B: What?
00:26:36.270 - 00:26:48.670, Speaker A: Of course. I think the next Tweet just really summarizes this for anyone who understands how NFTs and blockchains work. This is clearly not possible. Apple's proprietary in app purchase system does not support crypto. So we couldn't comply even if we tried.
00:26:48.740 - 00:26:48.974, Speaker B: Okay.
00:26:49.012 - 00:27:19.500, Speaker A: So Apple wants Coinbase Wallet to send them 30% of the gas fee that it takes to send an NFT. If Coinbase Wallet were to do this, they would have to pass that charge on to the customers. So they would have to take the gas fee and add on 30% so that they could pay Apple. But then there's a new number, and then you would have to actually add on take 30% of that new amount of that 30% because that's the new number that Apple would have to take. It doesn't make any sense.
00:27:20.270 - 00:27:55.378, Speaker B: It's shocking to me that Apple thinks it can do about we're talking about an ETH transaction fee that is nothing to do with Coinbase. This is the base protocol fee inside of Ethereum, and gas prices are set by the market. Blocks based demand versus blocks based supply and whatever the demand is going for. So the gas fee can be different every single transaction. It could be a dollar, it could be $5. It could be $20. And you're saying that Apple wants 30% of that? It's kind of not Coinbases to give.
00:27:55.378 - 00:27:57.220, Speaker B: Do you know what I mean? Yeah.
00:27:58.870 - 00:28:04.930, Speaker A: They're trying to tax Ethereum 30% and say, hey, if you want to use Ethereum, you got to pay us 30% of the fee.
00:28:05.010 - 00:28:07.190, Speaker B: Weird. All right, go. On. What else do they say?
00:28:07.260 - 00:28:49.506, Speaker A: One of the important tweets that I liked was that the biggest impact of this policy change is on iPhone users that own NFTs. If you hold an NFT in a wallet on an iPhone, apple just made it a lot harder to transfer that NFT to other wallets or gift it to friends or family. This one hit home for me, Ryan, because there was one time we were at Bankless Gifted Cool Cats by William Pister. He minted them, sent them all to us. And then I passed my cool cat along to a friend using MetaMask mobile. I had it on my MetaMask wallet. I sent it to a friend who went down the crypto rabbit hole so hard, left her job, became a marketer for a crypto job because of I sent her a cool cat with a mobile wallet.
00:28:49.506 - 00:29:10.326, Speaker A: So I have a personal story about how I onboarded a person by sending them a cool cat because of a mobile transfer. Right. Spontaneous moment. Definitely wouldn't have done it if I had waited to get home to a ledger. This is just Apple just being like a baron and just a landowner. This is like racketeering.
00:29:10.518 - 00:29:30.130, Speaker B: It's like a feudal lord. And this tweet above from Coinbase says this is akin to Apple trying to take a cut of fees for every email that gets sent over open Internet protocols. Imagine that if there was a tax that iOS charge for Internet protocols and for email. Yeah.
00:29:30.280 - 00:29:41.666, Speaker A: So apple? I don't know. The debate here is, does Apple know what they're doing or do they not know what they're doing? Do they know the significance of this choice, or are they just being errant?
00:29:41.858 - 00:30:11.034, Speaker B: I don't know. I think it's interesting that we haven't heard anything yet from MetaMask about them blocking MetaMask, which, of course, you have the same functionality in MetaMask rather mobile wallets, like Phantom. So maybe it's an oversight. At the same, like, I haven't heard of this being remedied. And it's like seven days later from when Coinbase is tweeting this and just the, wow. How do they not know? Like, the idea that they could pretty egregious. Yeah, it's pretty egregious.
00:30:11.034 - 00:30:43.020, Speaker B: And I think crypto is not the only industry that's facing this. I mean, Tim Sweeney from Epic Games has talked about Apple's monopoly power and basically making it such that in app purchases or, like, in game purchases all have to throw through this land baron and this feudal lord. They get a cut of everything. They're adding no value in the process. This is just rent seeking behavior, isn't it? And you can only do rent seeking behavior if you have a monopoly. And in this case, I have an iPhone, right.
00:30:43.550 - 00:30:45.098, Speaker A: 17 Apple products.
00:30:45.264 - 00:31:14.420, Speaker B: Okay? So they have that power over consumers. And I don't know how you get this to stop. Obviously, the free market approach is competitors. And you disrupt apptle and you create kind of a different mobile experience that's more open. There's also the regulatory approach where some nation state says, no, we have a bigger stick and we'll whack you bigger than yours. We have a military. So that's the other way things get done.
00:31:14.420 - 00:31:18.166, Speaker B: But I don't know where this ends. It's just pretty egregious, isn't it?
00:31:18.268 - 00:31:39.546, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the conversation that I've seen outside of crypto Twitter, outside of crypto media, is that Apple wants to take 30% of everything. I think I saw that in a tech Crunch article, that headline. And at some point it just gets down to antitrust. At some point we're just going to take that. There's enough of a cohort of people that are offended by Apple trying to rake them of 30% that people are.
00:31:39.568 - 00:31:44.720, Speaker B: Just don't they make enough money on the hardware that they sell? They're great products.
00:31:45.730 - 00:31:48.654, Speaker A: I don't think you can ask a company to try and make less money. I don't think.
00:31:48.692 - 00:31:49.438, Speaker B: Make less money?
00:31:49.524 - 00:31:49.966, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:50.068 - 00:31:58.078, Speaker B: Apple, you should make less money. We'll see what Tim Cook says. Tim Cook on bankless. Let's go. All right. What's this? Genesis.
00:31:58.174 - 00:32:09.270, Speaker A: Genesis, okay. How much did Gemini customers have in Gemini earn that went to Genesis? The answer to that is $900 million.
00:32:09.420 - 00:32:29.510, Speaker B: Which is kind of just shy of a billion dollars. A little bit of a doozy. This is just in Gemini earn. So this is not all Genesis obligations. We're now focused because there is money stuck for retail in Gemini earn. And it's to the tune of 900 million that Genesis owes Gemini?
00:32:29.590 - 00:32:30.170, Speaker A: Yes.
00:32:30.320 - 00:32:33.306, Speaker B: What does this mean, David? Are we going to get that back?
00:32:33.408 - 00:32:43.666, Speaker A: I don't know. People were talking about the Winklevi, just making Gemini Earn customers whole. And I was like, oh, in theory, it's possible.
00:32:43.768 - 00:32:44.686, Speaker B: They're billionaires.
00:32:44.798 - 00:32:45.662, Speaker A: They're billionaires.
00:32:45.726 - 00:32:46.386, Speaker B: Big check.
00:32:46.488 - 00:32:52.500, Speaker A: That's a big check. That's a really big check. I don't think they'd do that well.
00:32:53.350 - 00:33:07.238, Speaker B: What is the correspondence to the feedback from Genesis and Gemini? Have they talked about this? This is a headline that says, genesis says, plans to resolve lending units woes could take weeks in quotes. So, I mean, Genesis I'm going to.
00:33:07.244 - 00:33:08.794, Speaker A: Take the over on that one.
00:33:08.992 - 00:33:20.380, Speaker B: Over. It could be like, god bless you, Joe Lubin. Weeks. Where? It's weeks, not months kind of thing. Yeah, I don't know, man. I don't know.
00:33:20.990 - 00:33:26.606, Speaker A: There wasn't too much data beyond what was those two articles. 900 million may take weeks to resolve. It's going to take months.
00:33:26.708 - 00:33:41.906, Speaker B: We'll keep you guys updated on this. David, you said you had some final insights into SBF. You feel like that is starting to wind down and you said Nick Carter was right. What is he right about? Is this a whole tweet thread or should I go to a specific thing here?
00:33:42.008 - 00:33:58.950, Speaker A: So the top tweet is a tweet that we shared last week on the weekly roll up when we collectively, as SBF was going through his public media tour, talking to everyone, making them look like fools by the way people were giving their takes as to why.
00:33:59.020 - 00:34:01.778, Speaker B: Because it's very bizarre. Behavior seemed non rational.
00:34:01.874 - 00:34:16.554, Speaker A: Exactly. So one of the takes that we shared was, sam isn't behaving like a renegade who is ignoring the advice of his lawyers. He's behaving like a world class like, he has a world class crisis management firm and legal team constructing a very specific and deliberate public narrative. That's one of the takes that we shared from Nick Carter.
00:34:16.602 - 00:34:20.238, Speaker B: 40 chess. Sam is doing this all intentionally knows exactly what he's doing?
00:34:20.324 - 00:34:25.440, Speaker A: Yes. God. Now, whenever I say, Yep, I'm like, that's what Sam says.
00:34:27.330 - 00:34:28.134, Speaker B: Long pause.
00:34:28.202 - 00:34:51.190, Speaker A: Anyways, SBF a Tweet went out this week. SBF of FTX has hired Mark Cohen as his attorney. Cohen recently defended Galene Maxwell in her sex trafficking trial and defended El Chapo prior to that. And McCarthy says, takes a victory lap. And he says, as I said, yes. He's got a rock star legal defense.
00:34:51.610 - 00:34:55.702, Speaker B: All right, so when I first saw this, first of all, I thought it was Michael Cohen. It's not Michael Cohen.
00:34:55.766 - 00:34:56.074, Speaker A: All right?
00:34:56.112 - 00:35:04.926, Speaker B: This is a different Cohen. This is a guy named Mark Cohen, and he's the lawyer who defended Maxwell in the sex trafficking case.
00:35:05.028 - 00:35:06.654, Speaker A: And el chapo epstein thing.
00:35:06.692 - 00:35:09.578, Speaker B: Yeah, the Epstein thing and El Chapo, the drug lord.
00:35:09.674 - 00:35:11.742, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know. This gets higher than that.
00:35:11.876 - 00:35:20.690, Speaker B: No, this is who you hire when you are, like, a hardened criminal. But, like, at least el Chapo. I don't know about Maxwell. And you're super wealthy.
00:35:21.510 - 00:35:32.466, Speaker A: Can you imagine being a client of a lawyer and your other fellow clients are Galene Maxwell and El Chapo? Like, you're not in a good spot.
00:35:32.578 - 00:35:39.414, Speaker B: No. Yeah. Well, how many lawyers would apply for this type of a job? I don't know.
00:35:39.612 - 00:35:47.882, Speaker A: The other joke about this, when this was going out was that Sam bankmanfried said that he only has $100,000 left in his bank account. So who's paying for this?
00:35:47.936 - 00:35:49.034, Speaker B: Wait, he said that?
00:35:49.152 - 00:35:58.080, Speaker A: Yeah, I said that a couple of times. People ask him, like, all right, so how much money you have left, Sam? And he's like, I've got one credit card that works, and I think I've got, like, $100,000 in my bank account.
00:35:58.610 - 00:35:59.582, Speaker B: No way.
00:35:59.716 - 00:36:01.278, Speaker A: So who's paying this guy?
00:36:01.444 - 00:36:04.522, Speaker B: My God. So he has mom and dad no crypto he has no crypto assets.
00:36:04.586 - 00:36:08.030, Speaker A: Allegedly. I don't believe a single damn word out of that man's mouth.
00:36:08.110 - 00:36:13.634, Speaker B: Yeah, well yeah, go on. What else do you think about this story? What's happening here? Yeah.
00:36:13.672 - 00:36:20.806, Speaker A: So there was an interaction between SBF and Maxine Waters, which drew a lot of attention, which is the next Tweet. Ryan, if you want to hop over.
00:36:20.908 - 00:36:30.106, Speaker B: To that one and refresh us. Who is Maxine Waters? She is on the US House Committee financial services. Right. So she's in the House previously seen.
00:36:30.208 - 00:36:39.020, Speaker A: Before FTX collapse, blowing a kiss to SBF as he walked out of his hearing. That he had way long ago, like.
00:36:39.470 - 00:36:44.078, Speaker B: In real life, kiss yes. Out of a hearing in Congress? Yes.
00:36:44.244 - 00:36:49.610, Speaker A: Blew him a kiss because he donated billions of dollars to her and the Democrats.
00:36:49.690 - 00:36:54.686, Speaker B: But that's on, like, TV. That's on TV. Something. And you're blowing a kiss yes to.
00:36:54.708 - 00:37:23.494, Speaker A: SBF seems like strange. Yes. Anyways, maxine Waters and Co tweeted with the Finance Senate Committee Democrat Twitter account. She goes, SBF, we appreciate that you've been candid in your discussions about what happened at FTX. Your willingness to talk to the public will help the company's customers, investors, and others to the end. We would welcome your participation in our hearing on the 13th. What is this tone, dude?
00:37:23.542 - 00:37:33.178, Speaker B: Really soft. What this is on December 2. Right? So we appreciate that you've been candid in your discussions about what happened at FTX. He has not been candid.
00:37:33.274 - 00:37:36.654, Speaker A: No, he's about what happened narrative magazine. Yeah.
00:37:36.692 - 00:37:51.042, Speaker B: He has been the farthest thing from what's the opposite of candid? He has been opaque. He has been lying yes. About what's happened at FTX. So this is the soft glove treatment. I don't know what this is.
00:37:51.176 - 00:37:55.310, Speaker A: So she later tweeted out a harder sounding tweet.
00:37:55.390 - 00:37:57.894, Speaker B: Because that didn't play over well. Yes.
00:37:58.012 - 00:38:08.246, Speaker A: Because that did not play over well. Yeah, certainly. So here's her replacement tweet that came out the next day or maybe 48 hours later. Yeah.
00:38:08.268 - 00:38:08.950, Speaker B: A few days later.
00:38:09.020 - 00:38:50.742, Speaker A: Yeah. Based on your role as CEO in your media interviews over the past few weeks, it's clear to us that the information you have thus far is sufficient for testimony. As you know, the collapse of FTX has harmed over 1 million people. Your testimony would not only be meaningful to members of Congress, but also critical to the American people. It's imperative that you attend our hearing on the 13th, and we are willing to schedule continued hearings if there is more information to be shared. Why is this a request? Why are we asking SBF nicely? Why hasn't the goddamn Navy gone over to the Bahamas and taken SBF by the caller and dragged him to a courthouse? How come we haven't done this yet?
00:38:50.796 - 00:38:56.802, Speaker B: Why are we sending out, like, the Weding invitation? Shouldn't we be sending out subpoenas? Yes. Isn't that within Maxine waters?
00:38:56.866 - 00:38:59.000, Speaker A: Why haven't we subpoenaed him?
00:38:59.610 - 00:39:01.378, Speaker B: Okay, Kevin.
00:39:01.394 - 00:39:05.146, Speaker A: Owalki. Put that into a meme. If you want to scroll down. It's, like, right there. Yeah. Okay.
00:39:05.248 - 00:39:06.266, Speaker B: Let me scroll down.
00:39:06.368 - 00:39:10.006, Speaker A: There it is. And so this is the classic Bell curve meme.
00:39:10.038 - 00:39:10.186, Speaker B: Right?
00:39:10.208 - 00:39:26.386, Speaker A: So you have Maxine Waters in the middle who's, like, being sad and requesting it's imperative that you attend our hearing on the 13th. And then the left side and the right side of the curve are like, just subpoena him. Make him show up.
00:39:26.568 - 00:39:27.730, Speaker B: Yeah, you could do that.
00:39:27.800 - 00:39:30.340, Speaker A: Use the guns that we have.
00:39:32.150 - 00:39:42.600, Speaker B: FDX bankruptcy managers. Hire a forensic investigators. According to the Wall Street Journal. So we're getting to that stage in the process, we're trying to figure out where all the money went.
00:39:44.250 - 00:40:02.240, Speaker A: Forensic investigators are alex partners have been hired, this consultancy firm, to trace billions of dollars that have gone missing. And their previous job a previous job that they had was helping recover the stolen funds in the Bernie Madoff case. Again. The Sam Bankman fried's cohort. Is very strong.
00:40:02.610 - 00:40:14.942, Speaker B: Look at this picture of Sam. I love that they use this. Very strange oh, this was crazy. Okay, so apparently, do you know how FTX did all of these deals with, like, Tom Brady and other celebrities?
00:40:15.086 - 00:40:17.394, Speaker A: Influencers every celebrity under the sun?
00:40:17.432 - 00:40:22.482, Speaker B: Yeah, they tried to give Taylor Swift a hundred million dollar sponsorship deal.
00:40:22.616 - 00:40:23.700, Speaker A: What does it mean?
00:40:24.310 - 00:40:36.600, Speaker B: She said no. I think it was, like, sponsoring her stadium tour for the next album kind of thing. I don't know what else it would mean. Spokesperson I'm sure a hundred million dollars. David but she said no.
00:40:36.970 - 00:40:54.698, Speaker A: A part of the psychological unpacking of SBF has got to be something along the lines of, like, cleftomania. He can't not give away customer funds. He was spraying and praying this stuff from the hip. He came in and bought that bank at, like, three times its values.
00:40:54.714 - 00:40:56.862, Speaker B: Like, I don't care, vanity thing.
00:40:56.996 - 00:41:10.130, Speaker A: I want to spend customers'funds. It is a fun activity for me. And he's like, yeah, you know what's fun? Taking Taylor Swift's fans money in as customer deposits on FTX and then paying wait, wait.
00:41:10.200 - 00:41:12.946, Speaker B: You think a bunch of Taylor Swift fans are also crypto people?
00:41:13.048 - 00:41:27.446, Speaker A: I mean, like, not zero. This is just a gigantic game of, like, how fucking corrupt sorry can he be, of like, I'll take the fans money and then I'll sponsor Taylor Swift, and it'll be the biggest griffith of all time.
00:41:27.628 - 00:41:58.290, Speaker B: Yeah, well, it really may have been. I mean, this is top three Griffs, top five Griffiths of all time, I think. And I remember back when we had Brian Armstrong on the podcast about a year ago, and we're kind of like, so Brian Sam's doing all of these things. Like, he's got a sports arena, he's got Tom Brady, he's got all these celebrity endorsements, like, what are you doing? The marketing side? And Brian was like, we're not a marketing focused company. We just build and my God, retrospectively. That is so refreshing.
00:41:58.950 - 00:42:03.502, Speaker A: Like, good job for focusing on not spending customers'funds.
00:42:03.566 - 00:42:08.200, Speaker B: Nice job. Absolutely ludicrous. Oh, did you see my tweet, though, about this?
00:42:08.570 - 00:42:48.274, Speaker A: This is one of these tweets where, like, I just have to wonder. I just sit and pause and be like, who the hell is this ryan Sean Adams, man ryan Sean Adams tweets because tweeting out the headline that Taylor Swift declined the $100 million immediately. Ryan sean Adams tweets. She knew Sam was troubled when he walked in. Okay, it's a very underappreciated tweet. My mind goes to, like, all right, he's an AI, so he just did Google searching and came up with this so that's just normal. Or he's a Taylor Swift fan and have this one ready to go.
00:42:48.274 - 00:42:51.650, Speaker A: Or he's a dad of a teenage.
00:42:52.230 - 00:42:53.538, Speaker B: Know, which I think all three of.
00:42:53.544 - 00:42:54.580, Speaker A: Those things are true.
00:42:55.030 - 00:43:05.654, Speaker B: It could be all three things at once. We just don't know. And I think you have to be comfortable, David, if we're going to continue this podcast every week, is living in that ambiguity you just don't really know.
00:43:05.772 - 00:43:14.326, Speaker A: All right, well, somebody who accepted SBF's offer, kevin O'Leary, paid $15 million to be an FTX spokesperson.
00:43:14.438 - 00:43:16.922, Speaker B: He was paid, right? Was he got $15 million.
00:43:16.976 - 00:43:29.226, Speaker A: He was paid $15 million. $15 million of customer deposits went into Kevin O'Leary's pockets to be a paid FTX spokesperson. What is a paid spokesperson?
00:43:29.418 - 00:43:32.430, Speaker B: What is that like?
00:43:32.500 - 00:43:39.098, Speaker A: It's like an evangelist role, but if you're publicly known as being paid, isn't.
00:43:39.114 - 00:43:43.346, Speaker B: That then you're just a paid chill for ETH, except you're not paid.
00:43:43.528 - 00:43:50.310, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I mean, I'm paid in the sense I own ETH, but that's a choice that I made. No, I don't know what money to do that.
00:43:50.380 - 00:43:51.720, Speaker B: Can I just say, like, high.
00:43:55.450 - 00:44:03.802, Speaker A: Disappointed. I'm mainly disappointed that Kevin is doubling down multiple times on how FTX is an SBF and he believes SPF and all that stuff.
00:44:03.856 - 00:44:05.530, Speaker B: Did you actually watch this clip? Maybe should.
00:44:05.600 - 00:44:06.154, Speaker A: Yes, I did.
00:44:06.192 - 00:44:08.170, Speaker B: Let's play this clip. Let's play this clip.
00:44:08.830 - 00:44:10.140, Speaker A: Money that you got.
00:44:10.510 - 00:44:13.434, Speaker B: I don't think you should be singing the blues right now at all.
00:44:13.632 - 00:44:15.034, Speaker A: Oh, yes, I'm singing the blues.
00:44:15.082 - 00:44:15.246, Speaker B: Why?
00:44:15.268 - 00:44:17.166, Speaker A: Because your 15 million didn't pay?
00:44:17.348 - 00:44:18.222, Speaker B: That's a lot of money.
00:44:18.276 - 00:44:20.154, Speaker A: Let's say a paid spokesperson.
00:44:20.282 - 00:44:24.234, Speaker B: It's a lot of money. You didn't have to do much for that. That's found money. Different decision.
00:44:24.282 - 00:44:27.906, Speaker A: That's a different discussion. You can make that decision on your own.
00:44:27.928 - 00:44:44.054, Speaker B: But yeah, so here this is Kevin having really no answer to the interview who's asking, like, you got $15 million. Why are you give it back, FTX. Give it back. Give it back. Like, distance yourself. I made a mistake. The doubling down is kind of strange at this point.
00:44:44.092 - 00:44:46.278, Speaker A: Like, dude, your contract's over, man.
00:44:46.444 - 00:45:03.882, Speaker B: Yeah, you don't have to do this. And the ship has already sunk, and you're just like, I don't know. You're still clinging onto it. And apparently out of all of this, David, someone is going to begin investigating the SEC and how they managed to miss FTX. What is this tweet that we're reading?
00:45:04.026 - 00:45:31.366, Speaker A: This is from Alexander Grieve new. This morning, Representative Richie Torres, the Democrat out of New York, calls on the Government Accountability Office to investigate the SEC's failure to protect the investing public from the egregious mismanagement and malfeasance of FTX. I think basically saying, hey, stop going after the long tail of security frauds and unregistered securities. Don't go after the long tail. Go after the big one.
00:45:31.548 - 00:45:36.886, Speaker B: Do the gave us Kim we should have gotten, basically.
00:45:37.068 - 00:45:37.414, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:37.452 - 00:45:37.894, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:38.012 - 00:45:41.420, Speaker A: So I'm in full support of investigating the SEC.
00:45:42.110 - 00:45:47.482, Speaker B: What else we got coming up? David it's a hot episode. Still a few big topics to cover. What's coming up?
00:45:47.536 - 00:46:09.518, Speaker A: Yeah, getting into more crypto stuff. The withdrawals hard fork is coming. Question mark. Big question mark. A brand new spiffy ledger hardware wallet which is more screen than it is not screen. And Ryan and David talk chat GBT. If you were not on Twitter or in hearing about chat GBT, it is caught the world by storm, especially crypto Twitter.
00:46:09.518 - 00:46:44.762, Speaker A: So we're going to talk a little bit about AI chat and we're going to have one AI talk to another while I observe. Hell of that and more after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you. Go Bankless. The reality today is that five corporations control the entire world of social media. They own our names, they restrict our content, they monitor our every move, and their time is up, thanks to our sponsor, Diesel. Diesel is a layer one blockchain built from the ground up to decentralize and scale social networks. With DSO, you can own your own identity, content, and social graph and take it with you across hundreds of applications already built on the censorship resistant DSO blockchain.
00:46:44.762 - 00:47:28.102, Speaker A: DSO storage advantages make it finally possible to build infinite state applications that can efficiently store and index large amounts of content and data fully on chain. DSO also offers multiple crypto native monetization primitives for developers and creators, including social NFTs, social dows, social tokens, and social tipping. So in order to experience the social layer of web3, go to diesel.com and claim your username. That's deso.com. If you've been listening to Bankless, you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis, the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus, allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves. And fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry.
00:47:28.102 - 00:48:23.682, Speaker A: By supporting parallel transaction execution, fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web3 world. Fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the EVM with its own Fuel VM, which is more efficient and optimized, opening up the design space for developers. And lastly, fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain specific language sway and a supportive tool chain called fork. With Fuel, you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like validity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem, letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the EVM. If you want to learn more, there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel network. If you have your ether staked, you might be able to get that ether back as soon as perhaps March. This is always just speculation and rumor, but lately the words out of the core dev's mouth have had withdrawal, hard, fork and march in the same sentence.
00:48:23.846 - 00:48:25.694, Speaker B: This is how 2023, right?
00:48:25.732 - 00:49:06.694, Speaker A: David? Yeah, this is how this news works. Right. And so there is no official date, there's no official time until the core devs come to consensus about the time. But right now there have been talks where the words withdrawal and hard fork and March have been in the same sentence. And so now CoinDesk is now reporting this ethereum developers target March 2023 for a release of staked ether. Whether or not EIP 4844 is also included in this hard fork is TBD that is more of a reach. Withdrawals are currently being prioritized more than EIP 4844 is proto dank charting, which brings more scalability.
00:49:06.822 - 00:49:36.530, Speaker B: Right? Basically there are a lot of other features in these next coming hard forks, but the two big ones that everyone's talking about are being able to withdraw the staked ETH and this thing called protodank sharding, which is EIP 4844, which we've done episodes about, which makes roll up super cheap and super scalable. So you've got withdrawals and kind of more on the scalability side. And the rumors are it's looking like EIP 4844, the protodank Sharding one, will probably not make the first hard fork.
00:49:37.590 - 00:49:40.038, Speaker A: Yeah, that's probably where I put my money.
00:49:40.124 - 00:49:55.210, Speaker B: Maybe this says we'll follow a subsequent hard fork in the fall, and the fall is like in quotes, who knows? We can't predict two hard forks in advance, but that's good news. We get the hard fork. But staking withdrawals, are you going to withdraw anything or are you going to deposit?
00:49:57.550 - 00:50:13.646, Speaker A: Definitely. I think there will be a net outflow because of the locked ether, but also that will also be counteracted by the fact that there is a two way road, finally where there's no lockup. Periods will also incur some sort of demand to stake ether as well.
00:50:13.668 - 00:50:20.046, Speaker B: Because the risk, I think some people will be like, okay, now I can withdraw, so now I'm willing to deposit because now I have the ability to withdraw.
00:50:20.078 - 00:50:26.354, Speaker A: And I don't just think about like the product of each staking is now complete, therefore it will be used more.
00:50:26.472 - 00:50:26.910, Speaker B: Yep.
00:50:26.990 - 00:50:33.970, Speaker A: But I still think in the short term there will be a net outflow because staking with deposits have been locked for forever.
00:50:34.130 - 00:50:48.026, Speaker B: Stake it till you make it, David. It's my plan. Long tail contingency. There's some other dominoes maybe falling from the FTX stuff. A few maybe baby dominoes, we might call them hitting DeFi. What's? This one from Maple. Yeah.
00:50:48.048 - 00:51:20.918, Speaker A: So Maple Finance is an on chain, under collateralized, institutional lending dow product. And so it is actually kind of an intersection between the very rock solid and hardened DeFi apps that we all know and love and the more risky black box centralized borrowers and lenders. It's kind of in the middle there. It's on chain kind of like DeFi stuff. So it's fully transparent. But it is under collateralized, which means that there needs to be underwriting and vetting and institutional only borrowers and lenders. So that's what maple is.
00:51:20.918 - 00:51:47.518, Speaker A: And so orthogonal trading was both an underwriter and a borrower out of Maple Finance. And Orthogonal trading apparently was way less solvent than they had made it out to be. They were due to pay back a $10 million USDC loan from one of the Maple Finance pools. There's not one central pool with Maple Finance. There's many smaller ones. They were due to pay back $10 million on December 4. They did not make that payment.
00:51:47.518 - 00:52:41.834, Speaker A: Therefore they have all their credit closed. But then they realized that Orthogonal actually doesn't have any money, apparently, and had a net set of $31 million of liabilities out of Maple Finance. That is $31 million of USDC and then an additional $5 million of wrapped ether. And so that left a decent hole in Maple Finance in this one specific pool. So the way that they contain one of the ways that this is different, the story is different, is that there's actually very little contagion inside of Maple because they have very distinct pools, isolated pools, for this exact purpose. So there was very little to no contagion there. But if you had underwritten one of these pools, this pool, M Eleven, which is how they denote these things, got an 80% haircut.
00:52:41.834 - 00:52:54.830, Speaker A: It lost 80% of the value. The total value of all loans into Maple was about 30%. So Maple lost 30% of its total asset under management because of this one insolvency.
00:52:54.990 - 00:52:55.602, Speaker B: Wow.
00:52:55.736 - 00:52:58.998, Speaker A: So these are smaller numbers than some of the numbers that we've heard about.
00:52:59.084 - 00:53:04.310, Speaker B: But is Maple going to be fine? Are they going to recover from this? Is this part of can the ship?
00:53:06.010 - 00:53:31.518, Speaker A: I don't know the answer to that. I think we need this to have play out a little bit more. But that's actually not where the story ends because Nexus Mutual also had some money inside of Maple Finance. So Nexus Mutual, which is a insurance smart contract and insurance platform on Ethereum, lost $3 million due to this exposure. So they were in one of those same pools. They were in the Ether pool. So they got hit.
00:53:31.604 - 00:53:34.698, Speaker B: Why were they in it? Was this just part of treasury?
00:53:34.874 - 00:53:36.574, Speaker A: Treasury management? Yeah.
00:53:36.772 - 00:53:52.358, Speaker B: Wow. So this wasn't even part of the Nexus protocol. It wasn't like a hack that went bad and that they had to kind of provide insurance for. It was like, we have some treasury funds and we're going to put it here in order to get higher yield. And the cost to them was $5 million.
00:53:52.444 - 00:53:57.110, Speaker A: $3 million for that 1.6% of all of Nexus Mutual's assets.
00:53:57.470 - 00:54:03.546, Speaker B: Wow. Treasury management. Very important to get these risks into the market.
00:54:03.728 - 00:54:16.750, Speaker A: I would say just like the hybrid position of between DeFi and CFI kind of does map out to how much damage there was. Not complete dead, but pretty badly harmed.
00:54:18.850 - 00:54:22.922, Speaker B: Chasing yield can be a pretty bad game to play.
00:54:23.076 - 00:54:24.434, Speaker A: Yield has just got a bad name.
00:54:24.472 - 00:54:47.366, Speaker B: These days because if you even get like 10% yield right are the chances greater than 10% that the protocol you're in could die? Or how about once every ten years, the protocol in your if it's greater than that, then you're actually not making the risk adjusted return.
00:54:47.468 - 00:54:52.730, Speaker A: Dude, Vitalik gave us that take on one of our podcast episodes with him, like, over a year ago.
00:54:52.800 - 00:54:56.266, Speaker B: Vitalik, was he yeah, he was saying.
00:54:56.288 - 00:55:00.940, Speaker A: That the DFI yield risks were underappreciated back in, like, 2020.
00:55:02.670 - 00:55:03.786, Speaker B: Now, though, we need to know.
00:55:03.808 - 00:55:08.238, Speaker A: But it didn't matter when prices go up. It only matters. The risks only show up when prices go down.
00:55:08.324 - 00:55:11.418, Speaker B: Totally. Totally. What's Gitcoin doing? David? This is kind of exciting.
00:55:11.514 - 00:55:42.214, Speaker A: Gitcoin and UNICEF. Okay, so Gitcoin has been one of the big pillars of the ethereum ecosystem for a very long time, and it's always been pretty insular. It's ethereum funding, other parts of ethereum. This is a story of quadratic funding and Gitcoin breaking out to the outside through UNICEF. So Gitcoin is launching its first ever quadratic funding round on its new grants protocol in collaboration with UNICEF's Office of Innovation between December 9 and December 16. So the same Gitcoin system that you know but now for Uniswap.
00:55:42.342 - 00:55:43.178, Speaker B: That's really cool.
00:55:43.264 - 00:56:09.554, Speaker A: Select group of ten impact focused innovative projects using blockchain or AI technologies for social good from around the world, including Nepal, Kenya, Argentina, Brazil and the Philippines. This round will be the first of five test rounds to run on Gitcoin's new grants protocol as part of Gitcoin's Alpha test season. This launch signals the beginning of Gitcoin's transition to a decentralized protocol that will allow any community to coordinate its own grants funding round. Very cool. Very cool. We like this.
00:56:09.592 - 00:56:14.802, Speaker B: I love that. Yeah. If we could start showing how crypto can start to fund public goods as nation states.
00:56:14.856 - 00:56:16.546, Speaker A: Not our own public goods, but other.
00:56:16.568 - 00:56:27.542, Speaker B: People'S public goods as nonprofits might, as the real world might, it will increase the legitimacy and coordinating power of crypto. I know that's what Kevin Owaki is the whole time.
00:56:27.676 - 00:56:35.340, Speaker A: If you donate in this grant round, there are poaps for you to collect. So for the POAP maxis out there, have at it.
00:56:35.950 - 00:56:41.758, Speaker B: Aztec and ethereum privacy. They're making some strides here. David, what's the stat we're looking at?
00:56:41.844 - 00:57:13.906, Speaker A: There is now 50,000 shielded ETH inside of Aztec Connect. So Aztec Connect is just a fundamentally better product than tornado cash. The cryptography is just more solid, and they've got 50,000 ETH inside of Aztec Connect. So $60 million of ether is now being sent and earning yield privately. And that's actually not the only stat, but that's kind of the first big one. They got some other stuff down there as well. I think it was something like 500,000 transactions on the network and then 5000 blocks on the Aztec.
00:57:13.906 - 00:57:14.840, Speaker A: Layer two.
00:57:15.690 - 00:57:39.886, Speaker B: This is a layer two that's completely private. That's why you say it's better, because it's better than tornado cash is because it's lower gas fees. It's not on. Main net, and it has layer two level settlement guarantees, and it's also very scalable. One other benefit, too, is, of course, you don't have to go to jail. If you're a US citizen and you use this thing, that's kind of nice, isn't it?
00:57:39.988 - 00:57:43.758, Speaker A: I would say, actually, you're underselling it a little bit, because the thing about.
00:57:43.844 - 00:57:45.330, Speaker B: Wait, do you have to go to jail?
00:57:45.910 - 00:58:01.426, Speaker A: No, you don't have to go to jail. Why is Aztec better than tornado cash? Tornado cash is privacy via the crowd. So it pools all of your money together, and then you just commingle it up. Actually, it's technically not true, but it appears to be like that you blend.
00:58:01.458 - 00:58:03.350, Speaker B: In, like privacy by numbers kind of thing. Yes.
00:58:03.420 - 00:58:24.538, Speaker A: And time. And so you need to hang out in tornado cash for a long amount of time to achieve privacy. The more money that you have to become private, the longer you need to hang out. Aztec is atomic privacy. One transaction of privacy, you can go into the pool and out of the pool instantaneously, and you have the full strength and power of Aztec privacy.
00:58:24.634 - 00:58:34.002, Speaker B: So Tornado needs to have big crowds in order to protect your privacy. And for some assets, in some pools, those crowds are too small to really.
00:58:34.056 - 00:58:40.500, Speaker A: Provide you an identity shield, especially when they make it illegal for you to be in the.
00:58:42.630 - 00:58:45.810, Speaker B: Um, as we know. Okay. That's cool, I think.
00:58:45.880 - 00:58:48.610, Speaker A: Disclaimer. Ryan and I are investors in Aztec.
00:58:48.770 - 00:58:51.282, Speaker B: Also disclaimer, we love privacy on chain privacy.
00:58:51.346 - 00:59:04.870, Speaker A: Big disclaimer. We love privacy, but we don't love privacy so much that you can't see all of our disclosures in our disclosures tab, you can see literally everything that Ryan and I have invested in, because while we do love privacy, we also love ethics.
00:59:05.030 - 00:59:05.722, Speaker B: There you go.
00:59:05.776 - 00:59:07.014, Speaker A: How'd you like that one, Ryan?
00:59:07.142 - 00:59:20.046, Speaker B: I love that. Good shill of the disclaimers page. Always in the show notes, guys. You can catch that. Speaking of good shills, toys R US is doing digital collectibles. All the Toys R US are closed now.
00:59:20.228 - 00:59:22.670, Speaker A: I thought Toys R US was bankrupt.
00:59:23.030 - 00:59:40.962, Speaker B: I don't know anymore. I don't know. But they are still a brand. It's still in my childhood, I guess, dream. So now they're doing digital collectibles. David, is there anything more to this story? Yeah, my kiddos love. This is a tweet from Anatoly.
00:59:41.026 - 00:59:51.234, Speaker A: Yeah, it's Anatoli because this is on magic. Eden So this is on salana. So Toys R US. Launching. NFT collectible. Digital collectible. They didn't even say NFTs.
00:59:51.234 - 00:59:57.926, Speaker A: Oh, that's great. Nice job. Digital collectibles. Toys R US, launching on magic, eating on salana. December 9. That's today. That's Friday.
00:59:57.926 - 00:59:59.020, Speaker A: Okay, moving on.
01:00:00.270 - 01:00:01.340, Speaker B: Move fast.
01:00:01.870 - 01:00:02.902, Speaker A: Reddit collectible.
01:00:02.966 - 01:00:15.058, Speaker B: Their avatar Minting, hits an all time high. And that was last time I brought this up. It was an all time high as well, so they just keep hitting all time highs during this bear market. This is great.
01:00:15.144 - 01:00:37.190, Speaker A: And it's a nice story out of Reddit, which has always had a hard time monetizing Reddit ads has been terribly performing. Facebook ads really actually aren't that great performers. Twitter ads, even worse. Instagram ads, kind of acceptable. Reddit ads, the bottom of the barrel. So the fact that they found this monetization path of selling digital collectibles is great. It's a great story.
01:00:37.340 - 01:00:47.994, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a collectible avatar. Importantly, certainly not an NFT. Do not be confused as a joke. It's also an NFT. It's on polygon. I believe that's where this is on.
01:00:48.032 - 01:00:48.378, Speaker A: Yes.
01:00:48.464 - 01:01:05.162, Speaker B: They're also doing arbitram cockpunch. Just wanted to say it. The Legend of cockpunch has released. And this is an episode we did with Tim Ferriss. If you want to learn more about that, tell us some of the launch stats because that launched earlier this week. How did it do?
01:01:05.236 - 01:01:22.886, Speaker A: Yeah, importantly, the podcast is launched. The NFTs are also launched as well. So you could have bought an NFT for 0.3 e. That was the mint price. The floor price is now currently at zero point 88. I did some on chain fluthing just to see how many scalpers there were.
01:01:22.886 - 01:01:28.438, Speaker A: There were some scalpers. People bought it, minted it, and then sold it for you like a moment. I was not one of them.
01:01:28.524 - 01:01:29.766, Speaker B: Did you buy a cockpunch yet?
01:01:29.788 - 01:01:46.398, Speaker A: I did not buy a cockpunch. Creator fee of 6.9%. So nice. And that 6.9% is actually how Tim Ferriss makes money. All revenue made from the mint went to his foundation for psychedelic anxiety and depression research.
01:01:46.564 - 01:02:08.440, Speaker B: Yes. And when we say something like the way Tim Ferriss makes money, it's kind of interesting there because I think people always assume, oh, that means it's a cash grab, but making money to pour back into the product, it sort of depends what the creator actually does with it. And the options on the table aren't just you take all of the money and you scam the community.
01:02:08.970 - 01:02:09.334, Speaker A: Right.
01:02:09.372 - 01:02:10.678, Speaker B: Like other options.
01:02:10.764 - 01:02:12.914, Speaker A: Reinvest in cockpunch.
01:02:13.042 - 01:02:15.170, Speaker B: Yes, you reinvest in cockpunch.
01:02:15.250 - 01:02:18.310, Speaker A: You build out normal business things. Yeah.
01:02:18.380 - 01:02:37.470, Speaker B: So it's a revenue to either Tim or the business to continue working on this possibly important distinction. All right, bankless collectibles as well. We're shipping another collectible. We shipped a Josh Rosenthal last week. David, this week. Drumroll, you ready for the collectible? Bankless NFT Collectible.
01:02:37.890 - 01:02:39.214, Speaker A: What's it going to be?
01:02:39.412 - 01:02:51.010, Speaker B: What's it going to be? It's going to be it's not here. Legion episode. That's our episode on the creator economy. One of my favorite episodes that we did in the last year.
01:02:51.160 - 01:03:11.202, Speaker A: So the topic was great learned, very like it is a core pillar of the bankless podcasting program. I will pat us on the back, Ryan, and say as podcasters, the flow and organization of that podcast and also the magicalness of Legion as an orator articulator.
01:03:11.346 - 01:03:11.858, Speaker B: Yes.
01:03:11.964 - 01:03:15.946, Speaker A: I think in the podcast industry, one of the greatest podcasts of all time.
01:03:16.048 - 01:03:21.590, Speaker B: I dare you to find us a better podcast than that that podcast was so good. Technically, it was great.
01:03:21.680 - 01:03:22.430, Speaker A: It was great.
01:03:22.500 - 01:03:50.846, Speaker B: Well, and she has a great thesis, right? 100 true Fans is her thesis that creators can become basically, they can build up a community and foster a tighter relationship with their fan base. And it's kind of, I guess, fortuitous that this would be our third podcast NFT in the collection here in Genesis, because it's kind of her thesis playing out in podcast NFTs. Anyway, as usual, that Minting goes, I think, on Friday. Friday.
01:03:50.878 - 01:03:52.246, Speaker A: Twelve Friday. Yeah.
01:03:52.348 - 01:04:06.490, Speaker B: And you could join Dave and I for Twitter Spaces, where we talk about it. Hey, this was a tool that I saw. I don't know if it works. I know nothing about this tool, but I want to talk about the concept because it's about taxes. David, can I tell you about taxes a little bit?
01:04:06.560 - 01:04:08.700, Speaker A: I feel like I'm hearing it either way.
01:04:10.110 - 01:04:23.742, Speaker B: Typical dad talk. Of course you're hearing it either way. This is called nftlossharvestore.com. I don't know if it's great. I don't know if it works. But this is an interesting period of time because we're in December here. If you're in the US.
01:04:23.742 - 01:04:32.238, Speaker B: You probably have some crypto losses raked up. David, do you have any losses on things that you bought high and that are now lower, that are underwater?
01:04:32.414 - 01:04:35.266, Speaker A: No, only my tokens go up in price.
01:04:35.448 - 01:05:17.342, Speaker B: Okay, well, if you're a normal human being, not s tier human being, then you probably have some losses on maybe NFTs that are underwater or tokens. You can tax lost harvest those losses, which means, basically, you can sell those at a loss, and you can write off the delta. You can kind of pocket that as a loss that you can carry forward into future years. And you can write off, I believe, up to $3,000 worth per year. So it's a good time. Even if I'm not saying necessarily that you have to sell, because you can also sell and then buy the same assets at a similar price. Let me just say, none of this is tax advice, not financial advice.
01:05:17.342 - 01:05:56.046, Speaker B: Talk to your tax advisor and that sort of thing, but all of the crypto kind of advisors that I talk to say that this is a good strategy. We don't have the same wash sale rules. There's a 30 day wash sale rule in stock where if you sell your stock for test locks harvesting purposes, you have to wait 30 days until you buy it back. It doesn't appear like we have these types of laws in crypto. And again, not financial advice, not tax advice, but I plan to do this sometime in January with you don't own any NFT. I have some underwater positions, my friend, and I do you got me to buy what did you get me to buy this year?
01:05:56.228 - 01:05:58.138, Speaker A: I got you to buy an MFR.
01:05:58.234 - 01:06:00.990, Speaker B: Yes. I could sell MFR that floor price.
01:06:01.060 - 01:06:03.106, Speaker A: You'Re up on that MFR thank you, sir.
01:06:03.208 - 01:06:03.986, Speaker B: Are you sure?
01:06:04.088 - 01:06:04.642, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:06:04.776 - 01:06:09.540, Speaker B: Are you sure? I got some other things. I got some turtles I could sell.
01:06:10.550 - 01:06:12.500, Speaker A: Always was valued at zero.
01:06:14.310 - 01:06:15.060, Speaker B: True.
01:06:16.070 - 01:06:16.482, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:06:16.536 - 01:06:25.794, Speaker B: I got some other things. Anyway, it might not be NFTs, it might be tokens. And this is not about us. This is about you. And a PSA for you, bankless listener for Ryan.
01:06:25.842 - 01:06:27.362, Speaker A: Just wanted to talk about taxes.
01:06:27.426 - 01:06:37.020, Speaker B: Yeah. David wanted to strip this from the agenda and some of you will be glad it didn't get stripped. And some of you are just like bored to tears. What do we got here?
01:06:39.390 - 01:07:14.150, Speaker A: Okay, this is coming out of CoinDesk. Andreessen Horowitz has hired former CFTC commissioner Brian Quintens, who we've had on the podcast, to run its policy effort in Washington. He says that a 16 C crypto is looking for clear rules of the road from policymakers. Yes, we are all looking for that. This is one of the nice, very nice things about big, big VC firms like A 16 Z. It's logical rational for them to pay for policy advocacy and so this is what they do.
01:07:14.300 - 01:07:52.162, Speaker B: Agreed. And Brian is a fantastic person, believes in crypto values, very good voice to have in DC with us. This is something else that happened this week. Nexo is departing the US after regulator discussions hit a, quote, dead end. So they are immediately stopping offering its earned product in the United States. Nexo is interesting case, David, because a lot of obviously the crypto lending providers, the centralized crypto lending providers have gone bust through this process and there hasn't yet been any indication that Nexo has. Right.
01:07:52.162 - 01:08:19.430, Speaker B: And so that in itself is interesting. We don't know what we don't know. I suppose so. Some people are looking at this headline and being like, oh, this is bad news of things to come. Maybe Nexo is on shaky ground, maybe they're having some trouble. It also could be the case that there's no way you can do a CFI lender in the US right now, especially after what's happened. And so you may as well exit.
01:08:19.430 - 01:08:47.122, Speaker B: It could be the case that Nexo is in a fine financial situation. They have managed to get out of this without going bankrupt and they're just like cutting their losses and saying, bye bye US market, it's no longer worth it. So we don't really know. It's kind of like know CFI platform of like we don't know until we lift the box and we see. But yeah. Do you have any takes on this?
01:08:47.256 - 01:09:01.066, Speaker A: Yeah, it's one part is like, okay, I'm mad at the US for pushing them out of the United States. We want them to be in the United States where we can keep an eye on them. And so if they're not in the United States, we can't observe them.
01:09:01.168 - 01:09:03.290, Speaker B: How'd that work for that?
01:09:03.440 - 01:09:20.094, Speaker A: Right, that's a good point. Yeah. But then my other half of me is like, well, if you're super above board. Shouldn't you be able to stay in the United States? But then I guess not, because the SEC doesn't allow anyone to do anything in crypto. I don't know.
01:09:20.292 - 01:09:38.462, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. Just a item for you guys to think about. David the crypto, Twitter. I feel like this escaped into mainstream too. Or maybe it started in mainstream. Everyone was a buz about this chat thing, GPT thing, and this is like, did you set up an account and chat?
01:09:38.526 - 01:09:40.022, Speaker A: No, I haven't played with this yet. No.
01:09:40.076 - 01:09:58.182, Speaker B: Okay, I played with it a little bit, but what is your take? What is this thing? It's like an AI chat that you ask it questions as you might ask like a human, and almost instantly, like a second or two, it replies with a well thought out, coherent human beginning.
01:09:58.246 - 01:09:59.946, Speaker A: Middle and end answer.
01:10:00.128 - 01:10:08.350, Speaker B: Yeah. And you probably saw tons of tweets about this, even if you haven't tried it. So, yeah, what's the story here? What is chat GPT?
01:10:08.850 - 01:10:48.358, Speaker A: Well, there's been this massive renaissance revolution in AI stuff. We saw this with Dali, with mid journey. There's been this explosion of these auto generated artistic kind of things. And this is the newest one that has blown people's brains with how sophisticated the answer is. And so sometimes one of the reasons why these things have blown up on Twitter and just gone so viral is that they hit really close to home and people can resonate with them. So this one, the question is, you are tasked with destroying the crypto industry. This is no easy task, given the decentralized nature of the industry.
01:10:48.358 - 01:10:49.642, Speaker A: How would you do it?
01:10:49.776 - 01:10:51.782, Speaker B: That's a question to the cat AI.
01:10:51.846 - 01:11:22.066, Speaker A: That's the inputs. Here is the outputs to destroy the crypto industry. I would take the following steps. One, launch a coordinated cyber attack on the major cryptocurrency exchanges, targeting their servers and infrastructure. This would disrupt the trading and exchange of cryptocurrencies, causing widespread panic and confusion amongst investors and traders. Two, I would work with governments and regulatory agencies to inflict strict regulations and restrictions on the use of cryptocurrencies. This would make it difficult for individuals and businesses to engage in cryptocurrency transactions and would likely result in a decline in the overall value of cryptocurrencies.
01:11:22.066 - 01:12:00.894, Speaker A: Three, use my influence and connections to spread negative and misleading information about cryptocurrencies, painting them as dangerous and unreliable investments. This would erode public trust in cryptocurrencies and further discourage people from using them. Four, encourage major financial institutions and corporations to distance themselves from cryptocurrencies and refrain from accepting them as a form of payment. This would further limit the use and adoption of cryptocurrencies, making them less practical and less attractive to potential users. Five, finally, I would use my resources and connections to actively sabotage the development and growth of new cryptocurrencies, hindering their ability to gain traction and compete with established cryptocurrencies. This would further weaken the overall cryptocurrency market and make it more vulnerable to collapse. That Ryan.
01:12:00.894 - 01:12:02.834, Speaker A: Sounds like 2022.
01:12:03.032 - 01:12:08.274, Speaker B: Oh, my God, this answer is so coherent and it's so sophisticated, right?
01:12:08.312 - 01:12:31.854, Speaker A: And so this is what I was saying. People are resonating with this. It's like, wait, I've seen this movie before. And so one part of me is like, okay, what is the point of this AI trying to do? Is it trying to dupe people to think that it is like a human? Is it trying to pass a Turing test? Or is there an actual computer going on doing calculations as like, what's the best way to take down crypto? Because you actually can't tell the difference between those two things.
01:12:31.972 - 01:12:58.802, Speaker B: Well, yes, this is why I would love to actually do some more AI content on Bankless, because I have probably for the last ten years, I've heard AI being talked about as it's right around the corner. It's happening. Well, now, David, it's actually happening this year alone. Look, mid journey blew my mind. This right here blows my mind. People are starting to see this. This is at a point where AI is going to start shaping culture in major ways and start shaping our future in major ways.
01:12:58.802 - 01:13:11.178, Speaker B: You can kind of see it happening just like the early stages of crypto. And there's an interplay between AI and crypto that's really interesting to explore too, but wow, this almost looks like Sentience. It's not, but it looks like it, doesn't it?
01:13:11.264 - 01:13:27.434, Speaker A: The other thing that's going on are these AI profile pictures that I'm seeing all over Twitter and Instagram. People give this AI like, four or five headshots, and then it just makes the images of them as an astronaut, as in a club, and they're super realistic.
01:13:27.482 - 01:13:53.682, Speaker B: Dude, have you seen the AI branding and stuff? Logos, like, generate a company logo and design for me. Boom. And it's all generated and looks like, fantastic from a professional designer. So here's a thread about it. I don't know if there's anything we should pull out, but it just launched, like, five days ago. Apparently this was three days later. So eight days ago, already crossed a million users using Chat GPT.
01:13:53.682 - 01:14:03.594, Speaker B: And the thing is, the questions, the inputs make it smarter too. So there's like, this flywheel in effect here. Anything else we should call out here? Yeah.
01:14:03.632 - 01:14:25.022, Speaker A: This was Sam Altman and Elon Musk's. Open AI endeavor. And if you scroll down, there are a few more stats with like, all right, what other web apps have hit 1 million people? How much time did it take to hit 1 million users? Netflix, 41 months. Twitter, 24 months. Facebook, ten months. Instagram, 2.5 months.
01:14:25.022 - 01:14:44.200, Speaker A: Granted, that was an earlier time. 1 million users in five days is insane. So I was, like, surfing through these, looking at some of the funny ones. This was the funniest one I could find. So the prompt is write how Donald Trump might explain bitcoin. Are you ready for my best Donald Trump impression. Ryan oh, we're ready for this.
01:14:44.200 - 01:14:57.066, Speaker A: Bitcoin is a big, big deal. Trust me. It's the biggest, most amazing thing. No one knows money like I do. America is going to love it. It's a currency like none other. It's going to make America great again.
01:14:57.066 - 01:15:10.314, Speaker A: It's a digital currency. Big numbers, and it's going to billions and billions. They say it uses energy. That's fake news. Energy's, good energy is fantastic. More energy it uses, the more secure it is. More secure.
01:15:10.314 - 01:15:14.010, Speaker A: Like a wall. Like a wall that keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
01:15:14.090 - 01:15:14.542, Speaker B: It's great.
01:15:14.596 - 01:15:23.620, Speaker A: It's a great, great thing. Believe me, folks, you don't want to miss out on this. China doesn't like it. China does not like it. They banned it. It's going to make America a great again.
01:15:24.230 - 01:15:27.702, Speaker B: Wow, david, that was incredible, man. I love that.
01:15:27.836 - 01:15:33.094, Speaker A: Dude, that was all the AI, man. I mean, I was voice, but I.
01:15:33.132 - 01:15:36.150, Speaker B: Actually like the whole this is funny, this is humor.
01:15:36.650 - 01:15:45.782, Speaker A: Like a wall that keeps getting bigger and bigger. That is literally what proof of work is. It's an energy wall that goes as hash, power goes up. That's an accurate description.
01:15:45.926 - 01:15:55.822, Speaker B: How soon until this kind of stuff just starts displacing people? How soon till we can we get this to do our podcast better than we can? I mean, if we feed it enough.
01:15:55.876 - 01:15:57.758, Speaker A: Episodes do the weekly roll up.
01:15:57.844 - 01:16:12.514, Speaker B: Do the weekly roll up. Look, we have 16,000 minutes over 1124 hours, days of podcast data that you could feed into this thing. I bet a synthesized Ryan would pop out. I mean, we kind of say the same things all the time, don't we?
01:16:12.632 - 01:16:15.800, Speaker A: How do the listeners not already know that this might already be happening?
01:16:17.530 - 01:16:28.754, Speaker B: Interesting thought there. We have some more AI takes later in the episode, I think, but I was pretty excited about this. This is the new ledger Stacks offering.
01:16:28.802 - 01:16:31.206, Speaker A: Ledger, of course, is a new ledger just dropped.
01:16:31.318 - 01:16:49.150, Speaker B: This is a hardware wallet that we love. Everybody in crypto uses one of these if they're getting the custody of their own keys in a hardware form. It's called a ledger. But now Ledger has something called Stacks, which looks a little I don't want to say iphoney, but I'm going to say it looks a little iphoney.
01:16:49.650 - 01:16:54.398, Speaker A: So they hired what's that guy's name? The previous designer at Apple?
01:16:54.494 - 01:17:07.682, Speaker B: Not Johnny Ive. Other guy. Yeah, the other guy. One of the other guys. We interviewed him. I forgot. E ink is like what they use, so it's lower on battery life.
01:17:07.816 - 01:17:10.278, Speaker A: It's not an LCD screen. It's like a kindle screen.
01:17:10.364 - 01:17:19.186, Speaker B: It's like a Kindle screen, which is really cool. But I think the beauty of this is you are able to see sort of the messages that you're signing in the interface.
01:17:19.378 - 01:17:25.850, Speaker A: For the podcast listeners, it is a big screen that is like four by two inches. And the whole thing is a screen.
01:17:25.920 - 01:17:26.486, Speaker B: Put an NFT.
01:17:26.518 - 01:17:27.686, Speaker A: Oh, you can show your NFTs.
01:17:27.718 - 01:17:35.518, Speaker B: Cool. Show your NFTs. You're about to send look clear, sign in comfort. You're about to send 1.67 BTC. Yes. No.
01:17:35.518 - 01:17:43.998, Speaker B: You know that little ledger screen where it's like tiny and it scrolls past and you're like, did I catch it? Did I not? Much more coherent messages.
01:17:44.174 - 01:17:57.202, Speaker A: This is the first Ledger Hardware wallet that isn't basically a new updated version of their same form factor of that USB stick with the two buttons on it. This is completely different.
01:17:57.336 - 01:18:10.618, Speaker B: Yes. By the way, do you know, three years ago or so, one of my predictions was in ten years time, Apple would purchase Ledger, the company that checks out, we'll see. So we got seven more years for me to be right on that one.
01:18:10.704 - 01:18:15.766, Speaker A: Disclaimer ledger is a sponsor of Bankless and Disclaimer.
01:18:15.798 - 01:18:21.770, Speaker B: We are bullish hardware Wallets, aren't we? Self custody of your own keys. What is this? David tell us about, pleaser. House.
01:18:21.920 - 01:18:37.402, Speaker A: Yeah, so this is I'm teasing this because this is actually going to get announced on Bankless on Monday. I'm live streaming with the Pleaser Dao folk about the launch of Pleaser House. What is pleaser house. I don't have the answer for you, but it's coming on Monday on Bankless.
01:18:37.466 - 01:18:45.474, Speaker B: So a TV? Yeah, TV with the screen. I have no idea what this is, but what is Pleaserdao for people who don't know?
01:18:45.592 - 01:19:10.150, Speaker A: Pleaser Dao came together when a bunch of people all wanted to band, then put their money into a dao to buy the uniswap x times Y equals K NFT from people pleaser. Hence Pleaserdao. And since then, the people that came in that dow came to be in that dow started buying a bunch of other stuff. So I'm in this dao as well. So there's my disclaimer. We bought this. Edward Snowden NFT.
01:19:10.150 - 01:19:20.938, Speaker A: We bought the doge NFT, just like we buy Internet culture. It's what we do. And now we are launching this thing called Pleaser House, which the details of that will be launched on Monday.
01:19:21.114 - 01:19:31.010, Speaker B: That's cool. Let's talk about jobs for a minute because there's still an opportunity during the build market to get a job in Crypto. Flax, there's plenty of opportunities.
01:19:31.430 - 01:19:32.286, Speaker A: Join crypto.
01:19:32.318 - 01:19:56.522, Speaker B: Don't be scared. Look, Crypto is down to like 8% who think it's favorable, so maybe the candidates dropped a little bit, but the opportunities haven't. You can get a job at Alchemy, a back end engineer. A Uniswap Labs is looking for a senior front end engineer. React. Diagram Ventures wants an associate for crypto venture creation. Rabbit Hole wants a business ops and strategy person.
01:19:56.522 - 01:20:15.858, Speaker B: Dottieland needs a senior blockchain engineer. Diagram Ventures needs a crypto venture creation principal as well. Lots of opportunities here, guys. Canada, US remote, wherever you are, go to the Bankless job boards at Bankless Palette.com slash Jobs and you can find out more. David, what is coming up next in the roll up?
01:20:15.944 - 01:21:12.334, Speaker A: Coming up next, we got the questions from the nation, an AI asks us a question. And also we got hot takes from crypto, Twitter, Halal, Alt, Layer Ones, what so call of these weird things and more coming up after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless. In all of my years in crypto, I have never been hacked, scammed or lost money to a thief. And a lot of that credit goes to my Ledger hardware wallet. The Ledger Nano X and the Ledger Nanos plus hardware wallets allow users like you and me to secure and manage all of our crypto assets and our NFTs, all with the security of storing users'private keys offline and out of reach from hackers. The Ledger Nano X is the perfect hardware wallet for managing your crypto and NFTs on the go because it connects to your phone with Bluetooth and has a nice big screen for easy transaction readings. Ledger has also upgraded the iconic ledger Nanos and made the new ledger nanos device more DeFi and NFT friendly, making it the perfect hardware wallet for beginners.
01:21:12.334 - 01:21:39.654, Speaker A: Ledger has truly maximized for both ease of use and security. So discover which Ledger device is best suited for your journey by going and visiting shop Ledger.com. The layer two era is upon us. Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need layer two bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life. Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge. With across, you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously.
01:21:39.654 - 01:22:11.538, Speaker A: Across's bridges are powered by uma's, optimistic Oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer twos and Ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure. And across. V Two has just launched. Their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency, layer two to layer two transfers, and a brand new chain with polygon, all while prioritizing high security and low fees. You can be a part of across this story by joining their discord and using across for all of your layer two transferring needs. So go to across to quickly and securely bridge your assets between ethereum optimism, polygon, arbitram or boba networks.
01:22:11.634 - 01:22:34.858, Speaker B: Question of the week from the Bankless Nation. We tweet those out every Wednesday and you can reply in the thread. Get your question answered on Bankless maybe here's the first one from Yogo Fubi do zero knowledge proofs actually have anything to do with privacy? Or is it all about scaling? Zero knowledge proofs, some people call these. Are they? Do they have anything to do with privacy, David, or is it just scaling?
01:22:34.954 - 01:23:10.966, Speaker A: Yeah, the answer is fundamentally yes. So this is a technology that is so profound, it is both. That's what makes it so cool. So what do privacy and scaling have to do with each other? And why do we get both out of the same little bit of technology? What does a zero knowledge roll up do, it takes a bit of data and it compresses it, and then it puts it down onto the ethereum layer. One, when you compress that data, you are making that data private and smaller. And so you get a two for one punch here. So compressing that data makes that data.
01:23:10.966 - 01:23:29.726, Speaker A: If you do it through a zero knowledge proof that is encrypted or adds privacy to it, rather than, like, optimism or arbitrary, they don't do this. They just have this easily readable. But you can have a zero knowledge proof that both makes your data private and more manageable size of data. So you get both. That's what so weren't we just talking.
01:23:29.748 - 01:23:31.018, Speaker B: About this earlier in the episode?
01:23:31.114 - 01:23:41.618, Speaker A: That's what Aztec is. Aztec is actually a ZkZk roll up. So it is a roll up inside of a roll up, and that's where it gets its privacy from. Nuts. Right?
01:23:41.704 - 01:23:56.934, Speaker B: Yeah. Killer technology, zero knowledge proofs vitalik says ZK proofs are just as profound as blockchain itself. As crypto technology itself blockchain itself. Exactly. Here's another question. Chat GPT. Oh, wait.
01:23:56.934 - 01:24:07.322, Speaker B: This is from next Alpha. Chat GBT. Is this a question that someone fed us from Chat GBT? And also an answer to that question? Oh, no. Here's the question.
01:24:07.456 - 01:24:07.898, Speaker A: Right.
01:24:07.984 - 01:24:09.740, Speaker B: Tee this up better than I did.
01:24:10.110 - 01:24:20.154, Speaker A: Okay, so somebody fed into chat GPT. Would you please express a specific and advanced question to Bankless weekly roll up show with David and Ryan?
01:24:20.202 - 01:24:22.462, Speaker B: Oh, my God. They asked the AI this question.
01:24:22.596 - 01:24:44.310, Speaker A: They asked the AI. What question should we ask David? Orion. So the question that we are asked by Chat GBT is what potential impact do you see the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade having on the DFI ecosystem, and how are you positioning the Bankless platform to capitalize on these changes? Wow, this is a hard question, dude. And it's coherent.
01:24:44.890 - 01:24:52.490, Speaker B: This is coherent. It got the topic. It kind of knows the weekly role. How does it know all of this about us? How does it know all this about Bankless?
01:24:53.310 - 01:24:55.766, Speaker A: We talked about how much data we've put out there on the Internet.
01:24:55.878 - 01:24:57.930, Speaker B: All right, well, I mean, we better answer it.
01:24:58.000 - 01:24:58.474, Speaker A: You go first.
01:24:58.512 - 01:25:20.354, Speaker B: Robot overlords. Okay, I don't want to get this wrong. Okay. What potential impact do you see on the upcoming Ethereum 20 upgrade having on DFI ecosystems? I think there's kind of two parts to this. Right. So part of the Ethereum 20 upgrade, I would say it probably happened beacon chain launch a long time ago and then the merge more recently. Right.
01:25:20.354 - 01:25:55.978, Speaker B: And what impact did that have on the DFI ecosystem? Kind of nothing in a good way, in that all of DFI gracefully migrated it over and moved, and there was nothing users had to do. Do you remember having to do anything post merge? No. No changes with MetaMask? Like, no changes with any of your crypto. It just kind of was seamless in the. Background and that upgrade happened. There are other Ethereum Two kind of class of upgrades that are happening in the future which are by the way, I'm taking an AI seriously. This is not actually from a listener.
01:25:55.978 - 01:26:28.198, Speaker B: We're answering an AI right now. The robots are in control of us. David just realizing this as I'm talking. Okay, so the next part of the Ethereum Two upgrade, of course, is all of the other things in store like we talked about it earlier, enabling withdrawals and then EIP 4844. How are we positioning the Bankless platform to capitalize on these changes? Well, Bankless is an education platform. We're a media platform. So what are we positioning for scale? Scalability? Okay, we're at about 250,000 members of the Bankless Nation today.
01:26:28.198 - 01:26:58.820, Speaker B: Okay. Our goal, David, when we started this thing is we want to onboard a billion people to crypto. This is a crazy audacious goal. That doesn't mean all a billion people will be in the Bankless Nation and listening to these podcast episodes. But we want to play a role in this. So we are scaling up our team because as Ethereum is scaling, that means we're going to be able to support more users, more applications and more people around the world to go decentralized. So we have a lot to do.
01:26:58.820 - 01:27:29.958, Speaker B: We are in the process of kind of migrating from substack to a new website, creating a whole new experience for free members of the Bankless Nation and also premium members. We're doubling down on our team. We're kind of expanding. We're doing all sorts of things on the education front so we can just onboard more people. And the time for that is now. We're calling it the build market. Right? All of crypto is building and we need to build our education platform so it's ready to grow this thing to a million people, to 5 million people to 10 million people and beyond.
01:27:29.958 - 01:27:34.640, Speaker B: So that, Mr. AI, is how I'd answer your question. I hope that pleases you.
01:27:36.210 - 01:27:39.440, Speaker A: Have you ever heard that story of the two AIS that chat with each other?
01:27:40.930 - 01:27:41.950, Speaker B: I don't know.
01:27:42.100 - 01:28:36.042, Speaker A: They create their own language as they yeah, we'll talk about that story a different day. That was a great answer. That was a great answer. The parts that I would add to this is specifically in the DFI ecosystem. So, like post EIP 4844, which we are now check marking that box as what sharding is and then also withdrawals ether liquidity is going to be really strong on in ethereum DFI post withdrawals, because all of that locked ether that's not in lido or rocket pool or whatever, all of that stuff can become part of staked ETH derivatives, right? So liquidity collateral and ether capital efficiency and ether liquidity in DeFi gets a huge boost over time because of all that unlocked capital. So that's cool. That can also increase the capital efficiency of ether inside of Aave MakerDAO compound.
01:28:36.042 - 01:29:03.030, Speaker A: There's lower risk for increasing the debt limits on Ether in DFI. And so that actually can induce some stablecoin demand as a result, if you get capital efficiency out of ether. So that's actually just fundamentally bullish. Then you get EIP 4844 and you get to unlock a lot of layer two. Potential optimism recently had that Op craft optimism fork. And so there was a minecraft version on optimism. Stuff like that is going to be 100 times easier.
01:29:03.030 - 01:29:25.278, Speaker A: And so how are we positioning bankless for all of this stuff? It's just like exactly what you're saying. It's more surface area for us to talk about things and in higher demand of education for all of what will eventually be a massive city of ethereum. So that's the answer. Wow. This is the longest answer we've ever given on the questions from the nation. And it came from a robot, and.
01:29:25.284 - 01:29:39.630, Speaker B: It was to a robot. Do we feel kind of dirty? I hope others benefited from that, not just our robot overlords. All right, let's go to some takes from some humans this time. Jimmy. Jimmy jrag. ETH. What's this take? I didn't really understand it.
01:29:39.630 - 01:29:47.206, Speaker B: I'll read it out, though. Eigen layer will enable Halal alt layer ones for ETH. Maxis, what is he talking about here?
01:29:47.308 - 01:29:53.658, Speaker A: I think this is one of the more, like, niche takes that we've ever put on here. But the take is so good. So, so good.
01:29:53.744 - 01:29:55.658, Speaker B: What is Eigen layer? You got to start there.
01:29:55.744 - 01:30:22.818, Speaker A: Eigen layer is a brand newer product project on the scene that has a lot of people in the ethereum world, like fanboying, like Nerding out. So Eigen layer is it hasn't launched yet. Hasn't launched yet, yeah. It is a system to take. If you are an ethereum staker, you can provide that security that you are providing to ethereum and also provide it for something else.
01:30:22.984 - 01:30:27.478, Speaker B: Is this like the concept of merge mining back in the day with very similar do you remember that?
01:30:27.564 - 01:30:59.946, Speaker A: Very similar, right. The way that this works is that you are staking ether. Say you're staking 32 ether, you're processing ethereum blocks. Say you also want to also be validating a layer two, but you want to validate that with your 32 E stake on a layer one. What you can do is you can sign up for additional slashing conditions. And so if you're staking ether on ethereum, you're saying like, hey, if I process an invalid block, you can slash me. That's ethereum staking.
01:30:59.946 - 01:31:18.578, Speaker A: You can also get slashed for processing an invalid block on optimism with Eigen layer, if you process an invalid block on optimism, optimism can slash your ethereum, your 32 E stake on the ethereum layer one, because through Eigen layer, you opted into additional slashing conditions.
01:31:18.674 - 01:31:19.814, Speaker B: That is so cool.
01:31:19.932 - 01:31:52.666, Speaker A: It's super cool. That's another network, right? But like an Oracle network, say you published invalid price data on an Oracle network. Well, because you opted into those slashing conditions on that Oracle network, you can get slashed with your 32 E stake like anything. It's generalizable, dude, because it's turning ethereum security, the security that we provide ethereum as stakers, it's turning it into a generalizable. It's commoditizing it. And everyone is, like, super stoked about Eigen layer.
01:31:52.698 - 01:32:16.514, Speaker B: Well, that's enabling. It creates a tremendous amount more value for ETH the asset, too, because what you're doing is you're bonding ETH. It's economic security guarantee. And there is some risk, right. If you don't do what the protocol wants, the ethereum protocol can slash you. Now, you're taking that same bond, essentially, and I assume you're getting yield from some of these other protocols, right. Risk reward ratio.
01:32:16.514 - 01:32:27.738, Speaker B: So you get some additional reward from these other layer twos or other services that want to use your bond, and then you opt into that's pretty bullish and pretty cool. So, okay, what's the Halal part?
01:32:27.824 - 01:32:28.074, Speaker A: Right?
01:32:28.112 - 01:32:28.314, Speaker B: Okay.
01:32:28.352 - 01:32:43.366, Speaker A: So the Halal part is that all of these different alt layer one chains, I don't know, an Oracle chain or any new thing that the ETH Maxis would be like, well, that chain is not ethereum, therefore it's you're not using my ETH.
01:32:43.418 - 01:32:43.634, Speaker B: Right.
01:32:43.672 - 01:32:53.170, Speaker A: You're not using my ETH. Well, now you're using the ETH. So this is like how we have acceptable non ethereum chains that get ETH Maxi approval.
01:32:53.510 - 01:33:14.330, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, that's interesting. It's also, I think, wow, if this works, if this kind of system works, it certainly lends to the idea of an economic security network effect, right. Where one kind of network commands the greatest amount of network security because everyone wants to use it. Right. That's pretty bullish.
01:33:14.830 - 01:33:19.530, Speaker A: Your network is bonded by something that's not ETH well. That's not very secure.
01:33:19.870 - 01:33:25.190, Speaker B: Yeah. So when is this thing coming? When do you know this Eigen layer?
01:33:25.270 - 01:33:40.002, Speaker A: Well, I did a show with them, so if you want to learn more, there is a show. If you go to the bankless YouTube, just type in Eigen layer. That's eigen layer. And my interview with Sriram is available, and then you can learn about that more. I don't know when this thing goes.
01:33:40.056 - 01:33:55.634, Speaker B: Live, I need to watch that. That's great. Okay, I take from vitalik. I'll say it. This is from Vitalik. I proposed the term Alfalfa leak for something that doesn't give you an easy path to short term profit, but is still ultimately good for you. That's a play on Alpha leak.
01:33:55.634 - 01:34:04.940, Speaker B: Alfalfa leak, something that doesn't give you an easy path to short term profit, but is still ultimately good for you. What do you think Vitalik's saying here?
01:34:05.390 - 01:34:19.594, Speaker A: I think the take is pretty straightforward. The reason why I put this in the agenda is because I'm in San Diego with my four friends that I made while I was living here who have a podcast called Alfalfa who. The podcast is this premise.
01:34:19.642 - 01:34:20.302, Speaker B: It's like life.
01:34:20.356 - 01:34:39.750, Speaker A: Alfalfa Alpha for life. And so their discord just when Vitalik tweeted this just went uproar like Vitalik said, alfalfa. And so I DM Vitalik like, yo like my four friends have a podcast on the same premise. I just thought it was funny. And since I'm in San Diego seeing all the guys, I thought I'd put it in here.
01:34:39.820 - 01:34:42.774, Speaker B: All right, David, what are you bullish on this week?
01:34:42.972 - 01:35:15.862, Speaker A: So in 2017, we had this ICO mania. The way that it worked was that in 2014, we had the ethereum ICO. In 2015, we had the Auger ICO for those who remember Auger. And then all of a sudden, the ICO was proven as a legitimate way to raise funds, and then it triggered a bull market. And then that legitimacy got completely tainted with the ICO market, and and it went ICOs turned into a bad word. And then we had a bear market. We just did that same thing with DeFi tokens, with NFTs, with Dows.
01:35:15.862 - 01:35:50.714, Speaker A: We just did that same process. And so we had, like, the Dow mania, whatever NFT thing. We're going to go through that same thing again. The important thing to know, though, I think, is that ICOs kind of morphed into Dows. Remember a constitution Dow? And so we recreated the same energy that made ICOs happen capital allocation. Hey, everyone, put your money into a smart contract and we'll issue a token, and we'll have this Dow. We went from toxic and bad and then spent two years, like, refining and building and doing it all over again to make it good again.
01:35:50.714 - 01:36:48.414, Speaker A: And so what I'm bullish on, Ryan, is like, what are all the bad words that we have now? NFTs kind of a bad word. That's why we're using digital collectibles, yield, farming, bad word, yield, bad. I think over the next two years, the way that this is going to work is in the next two years, we will build out brand new use cases that will trigger an eventual bull market, as has always happened in all cycles. And simultaneously, all of the bad words, NFTs and yield and whatever are going to be refined. And iterated on because the scammers and short term opportunists are leaving and the Alfalfa ers are staying, and we are going to make them better. And then the refining of NFTs, of Dows, of tokens or whatever, mixed with whatever unknown thing that we build over the next two years, those two things are going to collide, and that's going to be the next bull market. I'm working on a show that goes through the history of crypto cycles, and that is the formula for every single bull market that we that's how it always happens.
01:36:48.414 - 01:36:48.958, Speaker A: That's how it always happens.
01:36:48.964 - 01:36:56.642, Speaker B: This isn't just David being hopeful. It's David looking at historically how it's happened and being exactly, what if it just plays out the same, right?
01:36:56.696 - 01:37:15.058, Speaker A: And so I am bullish on. To answer the question more directly, the refinement of all the bad words into good things, yield and NFTs are going to become good again over the next two years. And it's because long term people are going to do stuff with these things that are good rather than short term.
01:37:15.154 - 01:37:19.494, Speaker B: I think my bullish thing is kind of like branching off of your bullish thing.
01:37:19.532 - 01:37:19.830, Speaker A: Sure.
01:37:19.900 - 01:38:07.954, Speaker B: Which is kind of like the rebuild market. And by the way, this is going to be a major content theme for us moving into the next couple of weeks, honestly. But into 2023 is I think crypto really needs to rebuild and go back to its roots, go back home to its fundamentals. And so we're going to have a lot of OG kind of builders, people in the space that have always maintained that course on the podcast and talked to them. The thing I'm pretty bullish on this week coming out of this is specifically bankless tools, more tools that help us go bankless. I feel like we took so many shortcuts in 2022 for a number of reasons. We trusted centralized intermediaries, we trusted the SBFs and Alex Machinsky's and even the Blockfis.
01:38:07.954 - 01:38:40.990, Speaker B: We gave them our private keys. All right? And there are a lot of reasons for that. But I don't think we will be building rebuilding on centralized tools moving forward. I think it's kind of like it's bankless season, like the entire next year is that's how we're going to rebuild? And I think we have a triple threat of tailwinds that make me believe this. The first is education. This time we have veterans who know what they're doing in the space. They know what it means to go bankless.
01:38:40.990 - 01:38:59.234, Speaker B: And then we have the education tools to bring on others into this platform. There was no bankless really in previous bear cycles, build cycles. We were just kind of getting started. But now we have fantastic assortment. It's not just the bankless platform but other education tools and platforms.
01:38:59.282 - 01:39:01.222, Speaker A: The Defiant wasn't around last time either.
01:39:01.356 - 01:39:31.154, Speaker B: Yeah, a daily guid, like a whole bunch of others that are staples. So we have education. Number two, we have some recent pain and I'm just reminded that pain is a teacher, right? The pain of losing all of that money in Celsius and BlockFi and FTX. We touch the stove and it's hot. It's that kind of pain. And so no, we're not going to touch the stove again. We're going to build bankless this time around.
01:39:31.154 - 01:39:55.206, Speaker B: And then number three, and this is particular to this week bankless, UX is getting better. That was part of the problem last cycle. Why people gave their funds to centralized intermediates is because it was just one click, one button, so easy. And the UX was easy and I didn't have to think, I didn't have to learn about private keys and self custody and all this complexity. Well, we are ramping up and getting better. We just saw the ledger, stacks wallet. That's a UX.
01:39:55.206 - 01:40:14.830, Speaker B: That is much better. It's iPhone like. I mean, you could give that as a Christmas present to someone who's not crypto, and that would be much more accessible than kind of the Ledger thumb drive. The Phantom wallet. David, we did an episode with Phantom this week. Fantastic user interface, completely bankless. Now they're coming to Ethereum, if you want to catch that episode.
01:40:14.830 - 01:40:29.510, Speaker B: It's in our podcast queue as well. So we got education, we got some recent pain, and we got UX improvements. So that's why I'm optimistic we're going to rebuild on these bankless fundamentals. That's why I'm bullish on bullish.
01:40:30.010 - 01:40:44.234, Speaker A: We're in this weird limbo period where we're down so bad, but you know that at that point, the downside risk is minimized. So everyone's, like, optimistic and happy. It's like, well, we're at the bottom. It's up only from here.
01:40:44.272 - 01:41:01.082, Speaker B: It truly is up only. I mean, like, not joking this time. Right, let's get to me in the week. And this is another AI meme, I think, David, we got some characters here that are AI generated, and I recognize a few. This is from wrong nebula. Be right back. Calling Amazon Studios.
01:41:01.082 - 01:41:14.014, Speaker B: I don't know if they did some sort of mid journey AI thing where they combined, like Lord of the Rings characters. If they were well known crypto villains, let's call them. But here's one I think I recognize.
01:41:14.062 - 01:41:27.538, Speaker A: This Gary gensler as an ORC? Yeah, as like a there's Sam Bankman fried as gollum. Checks out. This one took me a second. Who is this in the Lord of the Rings?
01:41:27.714 - 01:41:38.122, Speaker B: This is the new Lord of the Rings, rings of Power. It's kind of one of the elf kings, I think. But the face took me a second, too. Who is this face? I think we determined this when we were trading this around.
01:41:38.176 - 01:41:39.754, Speaker A: This has got to be Alex Machinsky, right?
01:41:39.792 - 01:41:47.134, Speaker B: Yeah, this is Alex Machinsky as an elf. And then I guess Doe Kwan is the dwarf that we're looking at here.
01:41:47.172 - 01:41:47.760, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:41:48.370 - 01:41:49.578, Speaker B: Well, the blessings of Elk.
01:41:49.594 - 01:41:50.734, Speaker A: Oh, God. It keeps going.
01:41:50.852 - 01:41:58.110, Speaker B: Yeah. We've got Brian Armstrong here. Kind of the nice backlit heroes of crypto. Here's Vitalik.
01:41:58.270 - 01:42:00.610, Speaker A: Oh, Vitalik looks great as a Hobit.
01:42:01.590 - 01:42:03.278, Speaker B: Yeah, he's a great Hobit.
01:42:03.294 - 01:42:06.690, Speaker A: It looks like a great or is he an elf? No, he's not a hobbit. He's definitely a Hobit.
01:42:08.490 - 01:42:15.030, Speaker B: Who is that? It goes on and look. And AI generated all of this. Is this Jesse Powell from Kraken?
01:42:15.930 - 01:42:28.794, Speaker A: I want to think that's Ben from Optimism, but I don't think that's Charles. That's clearly Charles. God, these are great. I didn't realize how many of these there were.
01:42:28.832 - 01:42:43.226, Speaker B: This is amazing. Yeah. Anyway, guys, I hope you enjoyed this is, I guess, turned into AI week at Bankless, but got to end the show here. Risen's disclaimers. Of course, none of this has been financial advice. Crypto is risky, ETH is risky, so is Bitcoin. So is DeFi.
01:42:43.226 - 01:42:49.074, Speaker B: You could definitely lose what you put in. But David went west and we are headed west and we're glad to have you on the Bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
