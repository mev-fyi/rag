00:00:00.090 - 00:00:20.826, Speaker A: Let's talk China. David, sad face. Okay, this is, I guess, stuff getting real in China. We've had bans before. This time maybe it's different. We had saw Hill on the podcast. If you guys missed that earlier this week, go check out our state of the nation with Sawhill, where we cover this in depth.
00:00:20.826 - 00:00:25.206, Speaker A: But what's the high level take here? What are they banning? What does this mean for us?
00:00:25.348 - 00:00:57.630, Speaker B: Yeah. So what are they banning is a little bit kind of up in the air. I think it's more related to actual businesses. So if you are helping facilitate crypto transactions, then that's bad. But there's a little bit of speculation that simply holding crypto and owning crypto is still okay. It's going to be one of those things where we're just going to have to find out after the fact. Chinese regulators, they kind of get to do whatever they want, right? And so they will interpret their own laws in ways that will benefit them by their choosing.
00:00:57.630 - 00:01:38.586, Speaker B: But as far as being a business in China, you are shutting down, basically, is what's going on. And not only are businesses inside of China, but businesses that are serving chinese customers are also restricting access to their platforms to chinese customers. So we've seen mining pools not allow chinese miners. We see exchanges that are based in China with a lot of chinese customers, have extreme outflows. And this is why we know that this ban is real, because we are actually seeing on chain verifiable data and decisions being made by companies that are in China or relating to chinese customers actually change their policies. So it's kind of like the easiest tell ever to figure out. Oh, yeah, this one's actually real.
00:01:38.768 - 00:01:54.622, Speaker A: Yeah. Huobi, which is a large exchange based in China, they are getting rid of. If you're a chinese citizen and you're on Huobi, you have to exit, you have to leave. Right. They're blocking them all from their platform. That's going to phase out. Also, you mentioned outflows, David.
00:01:54.622 - 00:02:08.626, Speaker A: There was a coinbase chart that just showed, like, Ethan, bitcoin outflows from Huobi over the last few months. But then on the news of this, and it was just like this single red spike down, right.
00:02:08.808 - 00:02:10.830, Speaker B: Exit all exchanges.
00:02:10.990 - 00:02:28.874, Speaker A: Largest, largest decrease ever. Now, to some of your thoughts. Earlier, we're talking about maybe some of this is going to end up in Defi, like this capital has got to go somewhere. China's just squeezing the balloon. They're squeezing it outside of their borders, outside of their regulated exchanges. Seems like a short sighted move. But it's going somewhere else.
00:02:28.874 - 00:03:01.154, Speaker A: Maybe it's going to Defi, maybe it's going to us exchanges, maybe it's going to the binances of the world, but they don't want it in their jurisdiction. This is also something that I noticed this week, David, is they blocked Coingecko, Coinmarketcap and Tradingview. It's all blocked in China now. So great firewall. Of course you can VPN around that, I guess, but this is now more censorship of DeFi, maybe a direct attack on DeFi and crypto to make these websites blocked in China. It's the first time they've been blocked.
00:03:01.202 - 00:03:21.590, Speaker B: Ever, as we all know. You actually can't ban crypto. You can only ban your own citizens from touching crypto. And so crypto, it's still actually in China. It's just now illegal for you as a chinese citizen to actually touch it. And that's an important distinction and an important takeaway. I mean, how much can China, they've already banned video games, apparently.
00:03:21.590 - 00:03:30.350, Speaker B: So how much is China actually going to ban before their citizens are just fed up with it? I mean, it's China. So the answer is like a lot. But there's a tipping point somewhere.
00:03:31.090 - 00:03:41.922, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And I think they're just going to, many citizens are just going to not listen. Right. They'll just find other avenues and ways of doing this and move capital the way they want to.
00:03:41.976 - 00:04:40.770, Speaker B: There was speculation that all of this demand out of all these chinese exchanges to trade and speculate and do exchange things has gone from these chinese exchanges to DYDX, to a trustless DFi exchange, which operates on a similar performance level because of the layer two as the exchanges that they are fleeing from. And so I think the big takeaway here is that when a nation state like China comes and bans crypto, where do they go? They don't go to another alternative, like more western centralized exchange. They go to Defi. Right, because they just got, quote unquote censored. And so they're not going to go onto another censorable platform, they're going to go onto a DFI platform. And so there's an article here out of coin Telegraph that says the DYDX token gains 80% in a week. What's driving the Dex token rally, and their subline is traders raised their bids for the decentralized exchange token, believing as it would benefit from China's decision to classify all crypto transactions as illegal.
00:04:40.770 - 00:04:51.946, Speaker B: And so there's speculation that people are moving on to DYDX in order to escape China, which just makes sense. Like go on to the censorship resistance platform after you get censored by your nation state. That's what they're for.
00:04:52.128 - 00:05:05.598, Speaker A: Well, yeah, there's sort of a crypto narrative for you. It's like China ban equals bullish for defi bullish banning. That could be what's happening. Love that man. Love that. I think that could be what's happening.
