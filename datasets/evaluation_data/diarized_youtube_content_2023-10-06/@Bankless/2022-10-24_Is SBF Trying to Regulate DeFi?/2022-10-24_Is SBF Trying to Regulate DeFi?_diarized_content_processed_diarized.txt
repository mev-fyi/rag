00:00:00.170 - 00:00:27.426, Speaker A: SBF wants to regulate DeFi, as promised. He says, this is a tweet. My current thoughts on crypto regulation? There's a section about asset listing. What's the security, what's not. There's this section on OFAC. He says this then both centralized and decentralized applications can query in real time the list of sanctioned addresses to avoid transferring funds to or accepting funds from those addresses, saying, basically, if you're a uniswap or DeFi, before you let an address do something with your protocol, you have to query the OFAC sanctions list. Here's my response.
00:00:27.426 - 00:00:44.386, Speaker A: David, with respect, this absolutely sucks. You're saying DeFi should be OFAC. You're saying on chain freezes should be normal. You're saying DeFi front ends need to register as a broker dealer. No, this is not reasonable. This would eliminate the US from the crypto race. The straw man argument for those in the DeFi community is, oh, you're in deFi.
00:00:44.386 - 00:00:59.450, Speaker A: You don't want any regulation at all. No, that's not true. We actually really want clarity. We really want regulation. But you know what's worse than no regulation? Bad regulation. Yes. If we end up with bad regulation, it could set the US crypto industry back by like years, maybe generations, maybe it'll never recover.
