00:00:00.250 - 00:00:44.260, Speaker A: I have no choice but to be an optimist. Also, as an entrepreneur, you have to be an optimist. But what I've seen in Buenos Aires recently caught me by surprise in a significant way, and it made me feel very proud. It was the proudest moment of my career to have my heroes Vitalik Buttering our hero Vitalik Buterin visiting my country for the first time. And for him to realize that my country loves him, and for my country to realize that this is for real and it's so powerful that the entire political spectrum has to meet with him. I have never felt any problem. I don't know if I will ever be able to surpass an experience like that, but it speaks greatly about what's going on there and the potential it has to change things.
