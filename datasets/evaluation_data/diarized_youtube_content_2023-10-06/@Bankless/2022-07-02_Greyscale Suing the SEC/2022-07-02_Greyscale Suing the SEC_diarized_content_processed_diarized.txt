00:00:00.090 - 00:00:02.202, Speaker A: Crypto is taking the SEC to court.
00:00:02.266 - 00:00:09.066, Speaker B: Grayscale is actually suing the SEC. They are the creators of the GDPC product. Can you explain what's going on here for us, David?
00:00:09.098 - 00:00:13.326, Speaker A: The GPTC is worth only 70% of what one bitcoin is worth.
00:00:13.428 - 00:00:21.806, Speaker B: GDPC is a product that you can get in your retirement account. Because we don't have an official ETF in the US. We have to use products like GDPC, which is a trust, and.
00:00:21.828 - 00:00:55.770, Speaker A: It'S like almost inarguably an inferior product. And there's like a month illiquidity lockup period for creditor investors between when they deposit bitcoin and when can they redeem their GBTC. And it's no fault of grayscale at all. It's the SEC's fault, because the SEC won't let them turn this into an ETF. And so the SEC rejected Grayscale's bot bitcoin ETF application. And so the day that the SEC said that they denied the grayscale conversion of the trust to an ETF, Michael Sonnenstein tweets out, we've filed a lawsuit against the secret.
