00:00:00.170 - 00:00:12.160, Speaker A: This is the most interesting part of this article. Hong Kong securities and Futures Commission released a rulebook for the crypto industry last year stating that retail investors can start trading crypto from June 1.
00:00:12.530 - 00:00:21.786, Speaker B: What bankless? Nation. It is the first Friday of June. What time is it, David?
00:00:21.898 - 00:00:38.342, Speaker A: Ryan it's the bankless Friday weekly roll up where we cover the entire weekly news crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor. There is so much to cover this week, which is why I'm talking so fast. It's the morning time for me now for the first time in two months. So I'm back. Caffeinated welcome back. My east coast. Yeah, it's great to have you, actually.
00:00:38.476 - 00:00:45.302, Speaker B: It's good to see that background again, David. I missed it. We're seeing kind of a different background for the last week. I missed those bricks.
00:00:45.366 - 00:00:48.074, Speaker A: Yeah. The brick and the lighting and the good camera. It's all back.
00:00:48.112 - 00:00:56.400, Speaker B: Everything. You know, it's June and last year, 16 days from now, 3 hours capital went bust. It's when we first found out about really?
00:00:56.850 - 00:01:01.982, Speaker A: This is 3 hours capital month. Last month is around terra month, and this month is 3 hours capital month. Man.
00:01:02.036 - 00:01:02.446, Speaker B: Yes.
00:01:02.548 - 00:01:02.958, Speaker A: Man.
00:01:03.044 - 00:01:05.550, Speaker B: Time flies right when you're having fun. Are we having fun?
00:01:05.620 - 00:01:14.734, Speaker A: Little did we know. We still had FTX ahead of us at this point, actually. Okay, well, that means that it's been roughly one year since ether bottomed. It's been one year since the ether bottom. In that case.
00:01:14.772 - 00:01:22.690, Speaker B: That's true. About one year since ether bottom. We're going to talk about that then. Also a few topics of the week. Did China just do a 180 on crypto?
00:01:22.850 - 00:01:23.958, Speaker A: Did you read about this?
00:01:24.044 - 00:01:29.462, Speaker B: I just started to, and I want to get your take on it, but I feel like no one is talking about it and we're going to talk about it. What else we got to cover?
00:01:29.516 - 00:01:43.694, Speaker A: We got this celsius endgame. So if you are a celsius creditor or you're interested about the state of Celsius creditors hi, Ryan. You're going to find out exactly how much money you're going to get. And if you are over $5,000 of a celsius creditor, you're going to get something else.
00:01:43.812 - 00:01:45.642, Speaker B: I'm prepared to be disappointed.
00:01:45.786 - 00:01:58.386, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely hold your breath on that one. WorldCoin raising $110,000,000 115 divides the crypto industry continues to be polarizing. And then also the secret to winning the bear market. We got a take from Kobe at the end here.
00:01:58.568 - 00:02:14.114, Speaker B: All right, before we get in, David, we've got a special word from our friends and sponsors. Do you want to add some more excitement to your life? Your staking life, that is. You can add excitement to the staking routine of ETH using the Asymmetrics protocol. What is this thing, David?
00:02:14.162 - 00:02:42.126, Speaker A: So for those that are familiar with pool together, asymmetrics is like pool together, but for ETH staking. And so you stake your ether and then instead of giving just boring 4.55%, you get anywhere between zero and 1000%. And it could be anyone. Probably going to be zero, might be 1000%. And so this is what we call a prize linked savings account. And so all of the yield gets pooled up.
00:02:42.126 - 00:02:59.146, Speaker A: And then one lucky winner gets everyone's yield, and everyone else gets zero 0% yield. And so if you would like to add a little excitement to your ETH staking, asymmetrics is for you bankless CC Asymmetrics, you also can follow them on Twitter asymmetrics underscore ETH on Twitter.
00:02:59.198 - 00:03:06.886, Speaker B: Look at this. Look at this. Almost seven ETH that you could just get on the Daily right now. That's the current reward pool. Kind of fun, right?
00:03:06.988 - 00:03:26.000, Speaker A: So only 234 users are competing for that seven E. I believe there's also, like, an extra little incentive. So you actually technically get more yield if you net everything out with Asymmetrics. You just have to be ready to get 0% for a while, or maybe 1000.
00:03:27.010 - 00:03:35.534, Speaker B: You don't know until you try. Yeah, you could try your luck here. Okay. Let's get to the markets, though. Bitcoin price. What are we at on the week?
00:03:35.652 - 00:03:41.940, Speaker A: Call it a flat week. Up half a percent on the week started at 26,700. Ending at 26,900.
00:03:42.390 - 00:03:43.902, Speaker B: All right. How about ether?
00:03:44.046 - 00:03:50.694, Speaker A: Actually up 2.5%. So ether is up on the week started at 1820. We are up to 1865.
00:03:50.812 - 00:03:53.046, Speaker B: And the ratio ether, we actually got.
00:03:53.068 - 00:03:55.160, Speaker A: Pretty high up on ether this week.
00:03:56.010 - 00:03:57.414, Speaker B: Spike, what's this green candle here?
00:03:57.452 - 00:04:20.350, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that was when the debt ceiling got raised. So coupled to trad markets, but still slowly positive optimistic trajectory lately on Ether 2.5%. Ether BTC ratio looking really good. If you are directionally long ether like I am at zero point 62.
00:04:20.500 - 00:04:21.198, Speaker B: Wow.
00:04:21.364 - 00:04:22.298, Speaker A: Happy ratio.
00:04:22.394 - 00:04:23.834, Speaker B: That's a pretty big ratio.
00:04:23.882 - 00:04:27.074, Speaker A: Gain in the month is up only in May. Yeah.
00:04:27.192 - 00:04:48.262, Speaker B: Wow. I'm zooming out, by the way, on the Kraken Pro charts, which lets you do this. Very nice. I can see the ratio over time. Yes. Okay, so we're back around the April, like mid April, but you're right after a dip at the end of April, where we've been up only in May for the ratio. Go ETH.
00:04:48.326 - 00:04:53.878, Speaker A: Total crypto market cap, $1.17 trillion. Pretty flat. Pretty flat.
00:04:53.974 - 00:04:56.026, Speaker B: David, give us some stablecoin numbers, too.
00:04:56.128 - 00:05:11.358, Speaker A: Down. Ryan. Down. Stablecoin numbers. Okay, so twelve months change in stablecoin supply. It's bad. 162,000,000,000 down to 126,000,000,000 year to date change since 2023, 139 total amount of.
00:05:11.524 - 00:05:18.478, Speaker B: Stablecoins that have been issued. So it's like kind of market cap of stablecoins, which is a great usage metric for stablecoins.
00:05:18.574 - 00:05:37.782, Speaker A: Yeah. So the stablecoin supply in crypto is our liquidity. So it's a very base. Nice. It's important to see where stablecoins are going. Seeing them go down is bad because that means there is less liquidity in the system. Interestingly, though, tether is at an all time high.
00:05:37.782 - 00:06:09.470, Speaker A: So tether, the year to date of tether started at $70 billion, is currently at $83 billion, surpassing its all time high. Twelve months ago, it was at $83 billion. Then three rows capital got liquidated. It started to trend downwards, but now tether has resumed all time high. So for a while, USDC was looking real good against tether, gaining a lot of market share. Lately, ever since a year ago, and especially after the banking crisis, USDC has had some headwinds and tether has gotten some tailwinds.
00:06:09.550 - 00:06:16.674, Speaker B: Look at this chart. So I have a take on this last bear market. Stablecoin supply actually grew a bunch. My God.
00:06:16.712 - 00:06:17.854, Speaker A: That is Gargantuan.
00:06:17.902 - 00:06:21.114, Speaker B: Yeah. 2019 versus 2021. In fact, it grew primarily.
00:06:21.182 - 00:06:29.698, Speaker A: Okay. Looking at 2020, we were at like $5 billion of tether supply. 2020. Fast forward to 2022, touching 85 billion.
00:06:29.794 - 00:06:30.054, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:30.092 - 00:06:31.350, Speaker A: That is growth.
00:06:31.430 - 00:07:03.794, Speaker B: But you know, what's interesting is why this decrease? One explanation for this is T bills, treasuries are actually the best yield farm out there right now, and that is outside of DFI. In the last bear market, with interest rates Fed interest rates at 0% or close to 0%, very low. Let's just say DFI interest offered, the best yield on your dollar is no longer the case. Although here's a take maker is trying the maker dow is mulling a proposal to boost the Dai savings rate to 3.3%.
00:07:03.912 - 00:07:06.260, Speaker A: When's the last time you heard the Dai savings rate?
00:07:06.630 - 00:07:11.240, Speaker B: It's been probably 2020. I haven't even thought about it since 2020.
00:07:11.690 - 00:07:39.280, Speaker A: I used to consider the Dai savings rate as, like, the binary star system between the ETH stake rate and the Dai savings rate. This is when Dai was, like, the only meaningfully, decentralized stablecoin on ethereum. And then it's been at zero for a very long time, or at 1% as of recently. But 3.3% is not small. That's a decent chunk of maker Dow revenue going into the Dai savings rate implied that will increase the supply of Dai in the market.
00:07:39.890 - 00:07:53.726, Speaker B: That's the aim. And by the way, making them more competitive with basically debills with Treasuries out there, which are about 5%, something like this. So crypto creeping up there, it's a nice equilibrium. Let's talk about ETH staking, though. What is this chart from, Hildabi?
00:07:53.758 - 00:07:54.482, Speaker A: Yeah, this is crazy.
00:07:54.536 - 00:07:54.898, Speaker B: Okay.
00:07:54.984 - 00:08:03.010, Speaker A: 17.4% of all staked ether was deposited last month in the month of May. Wow, that is significant.
00:08:03.090 - 00:08:06.934, Speaker B: 17.4% of the total ETH stake happened.
00:08:07.052 - 00:08:10.342, Speaker A: Including the deposit queue, which is a one way queue into the beacon chain.
00:08:10.406 - 00:08:11.322, Speaker B: That's crazy.
00:08:11.456 - 00:08:11.946, Speaker A: Yes.
00:08:12.048 - 00:08:14.794, Speaker B: I mean, this is much more than I thought.
00:08:14.912 - 00:08:27.278, Speaker A: Yes. In the same way this kind of feels like post EIP 1559, it ended up burning way more ether than people thought. Yeah, same thing's happening with stakings. Like, man, people are staking way more than we thought that they would.
00:08:27.444 - 00:08:31.486, Speaker B: Anytime you say ETH burn rate, I got to open up ultrasound money just.
00:08:31.508 - 00:08:33.966, Speaker A: Because it's been at least two weeks since we've opened up ultrasound money.
00:08:33.988 - 00:08:35.522, Speaker B: We'll do, man, look at this. Look at that.
00:08:35.576 - 00:08:35.746, Speaker A: Down.
00:08:35.768 - 00:08:38.142, Speaker B: Only beautiful down only supply.
00:08:38.286 - 00:08:42.190, Speaker A: We are negative 275,000 Ether since the merge.
00:08:42.270 - 00:08:42.974, Speaker B: Damn.
00:08:43.102 - 00:08:44.658, Speaker A: Win 1 million. Win 1 million.
00:08:44.744 - 00:08:47.778, Speaker B: Tell me about the Ethereum validator queue, though. Interesting story.
00:08:47.864 - 00:08:57.206, Speaker A: Speaking of all time highs, the wait to be on the beacon chain for a validator is at all time high 38 days. So if you deposit 32 Ether, got to wait 38 days.
00:08:57.308 - 00:09:02.218, Speaker B: The world's most popular club, you can't get in, you got to wait 38 days.
00:09:02.304 - 00:09:06.058, Speaker A: Everyone wants to get exit time is zero minutes.
00:09:06.224 - 00:09:22.154, Speaker B: Zero minutes. You are free to leave any time. There's happy hour in there. So everyone's trying to get in. Total mev distributed to validators. Here's an interesting stat on its own. 200k ETH distributed to validators of mev.
00:09:22.154 - 00:09:23.394, Speaker B: What does this tell us?
00:09:23.512 - 00:09:52.538, Speaker A: So mev, this also includes tips. So just anything above base fee is what we're looking at. So 200,000 Ether was distributed to Ether stakers. Cumulatively total since proof of stake has launched, so Ether stakers have received, so spenders have been sent 200,000 Ether to savers. This is why Ether is great savings technology. And this is a meme. I am just ripping from the hands of bitcoiners who say BTC is great savings technology.
00:09:52.538 - 00:10:08.170, Speaker A: Staked Ether is the best savings technology of all time. And what we're seeing here is we're seeing spenders, people with short time preferences giving their time preference to people with long term time preferences. The ETH stakers.
00:10:08.330 - 00:10:14.706, Speaker B: See, guys, what you don't know about David is he is actually a hardcore bitcoiner. He just substitutes the word bitcoin for.
00:10:14.728 - 00:10:24.210, Speaker A: Ether, except it works way better. Dude, bitcoiners have always been right, except they just chose the wrong chain.
00:10:25.830 - 00:10:44.106, Speaker B: All right. For the bankless maximalists out there, though, of which both you and I consider ourselves, we want maximally bankless things. This was a great headline and story coming out of Decrypt this week. Ethereum and Bitcoin balances on exchange edged towards a five year low. What?
00:10:44.208 - 00:10:44.858, Speaker A: Wow.
00:10:45.024 - 00:10:45.834, Speaker B: Take a look at this.
00:10:45.872 - 00:10:46.460, Speaker A: Wow.
00:10:46.910 - 00:11:12.418, Speaker B: The amount for ether. Anyway, there's now 18 million ETH Ether on exchanges. That represents 15%. Did you know, though, in the summer of 2020, it was 30%? So we have about half of the amount of ETH on exchanges in Custodial systems than we did in 2023 years ago.
00:11:12.504 - 00:11:12.946, Speaker A: I love that.
00:11:12.968 - 00:11:23.842, Speaker B: This is great. This means more people are going bankless, more people are taking custody of their private keys and getting it off of custodial solutions. Very, very bullish on this metric.
00:11:23.906 - 00:12:07.410, Speaker A: So we should ask, why is this happening? What's going on here? Why are so many people going bankless? This trend definitely started with post FTX. So everyone who's been on a centralized exchange has been like, you know, I'm going to try out that self custody thing. So even there's been outflows of free ETH from even all the good exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, right? So that's going into people's self custody however they want to do that. There's also regulatory fears and so if the choke point is like, you know what, I don't want to get choked out, I'm going to do the self custody thing first. And then also there's the Beacon chain, which is sucking up all the ether, which requires self custody kind of most of the time. Some of the time. Interestingly enough, hardware wallet sales are also up only as well.
00:12:07.410 - 00:12:24.662, Speaker A: So there's just all of this demand. And also at the same time versus 2020 DFI as a utility is way better than it's ever been. Like, the utility of being bankless is up. So as the industry has developed, the reasons to self custody has also increased.
00:12:24.806 - 00:12:40.650, Speaker B: Another one of the most bullish things going on that no one's talking about because it's a bear market. We don't like good news, except we do on bankless. I'm always down for some good news. Cyrus Unesi had a really good take, I think, on the current state of the NFT market. Why don't you give us the TLDR?
00:12:40.810 - 00:13:06.374, Speaker A: The NFT market is garbage and going to zero and retail hates JPEGs and crypto. Twitter hates all coins with pictures. He's being hyperbolic here. And then he follows up and says, here are a few reasons why I haven't dumped my NFTs because of this. First, I still like my JPEGs more than I ever liked true altcoins. The art is worth more to me than looking at XRP or Iota balance on a block Explorer. He's just picking out like, chickcoins, basically picking on them.
00:13:06.374 - 00:13:42.642, Speaker A: The market caps of these NFTs are extremely tiny. Now, a one ETH floor translates to a $20 million market cap. That depends, of course, on the supply of the NFT, but generally speaking, the 10,000 PFP is like kind of the standard. Even at the depths of the 2019 bear market, giant Scams still maintained higher market caps than this $20 million market cap is insanely small. NFTs are structurally underinvested in because people don't understand them yet. Blue chips like punks and apes are sitting at a $1 billion market cap, which $1 billion coins have more staying power and brand value and utility and fundamentals than punks. I'll wait.
00:13:42.642 - 00:14:03.210, Speaker A: Memes are still extremely popular. People have quit buying them, but they can't quit talking about them. There's something about JPEGs that gnaws at you. They don't disappear the way Neo, Iota and AVAX did. Can it really go down another 90% from here? Don't answer that. I'm fairly certain someone will come along and buy this stuff soon. Why? Because mixing gambling and art is the new cultural phenomenon.
00:14:03.210 - 00:14:18.542, Speaker A: I think it's a great series line of thought. I think don't overthink NFTs. They were a big bubble and they were this first big bubble and let's be stupid simple here, just saying.
00:14:18.596 - 00:14:21.498, Speaker B: Basically, NFTs are better meme coins than meme coins.
00:14:21.594 - 00:14:23.678, Speaker A: Yes, that's exactly right. There you go.
00:14:23.764 - 00:14:24.414, Speaker B: That's what it is.
00:14:24.452 - 00:14:34.580, Speaker A: And they're going to pump again for the same reason they pumped in the first time, and I think illiquid low cap NFTs are a great place to place your bets in. This.
00:14:35.510 - 00:14:50.826, Speaker B: One thing I see Cyrus saying, though, is the blue chip ones in particular, those are the ones that are kind of like surviving, right? And there's definitely going to be some up and comers, but definitely there's going to be the vast majority of NFTs that are going to go to zero or close to zero, right?
00:14:50.928 - 00:15:01.834, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah. I think the game is to pick your bets, pick your place, your chips as to which ones you think are underpriced low priced, but still being like, circulating around on crypto, Twitter.
00:15:01.882 - 00:15:04.714, Speaker B: You're betting on culture, aren't you? You just make these cultural bets.
00:15:04.762 - 00:15:06.080, Speaker A: Cough MFR, sir.
00:15:07.330 - 00:15:12.494, Speaker B: Stop shilling your bag, sir. I don't even know. I might own an MFR. Yes.
00:15:12.612 - 00:15:13.774, Speaker A: You have one. Yeah, you have one.
00:15:13.812 - 00:15:17.538, Speaker B: You convinced me to buy one. God only knows what that's priced at right now.
00:15:17.544 - 00:15:20.002, Speaker A: I'm sure it's one easy. All right.
00:15:20.056 - 00:15:20.226, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:20.248 - 00:15:21.394, Speaker A: See, it's not at zero.
00:15:21.512 - 00:15:29.894, Speaker B: No, that's about what I bought it for, I think something like this. All right, David, we've got some stuff coming up. What do we have coming up?
00:15:29.932 - 00:16:16.814, Speaker A: Coming up next, we're going to talk about China's potential 180 on crypto, which might be the most bullish news I've ever heard ever, and no one's talking about it. Are people not talking about it for good reason or not? We don't really know.

00:17:29.094 - 00:17:47.314, Speaker B: Is China warming up to crypto? That is the question right now. Here's a headline beijing Releases White Paper for Web three innovation and Development. This is coming straight from Beijing. A web3. Innovation and development. White paper. We're not seeing these kinds of white papers being written by the White House these days.
00:17:47.314 - 00:17:48.866, Speaker B: Tell us what's going on.
00:17:48.968 - 00:18:30.494, Speaker A: So this white Paper, which I'm trying to figure out the significance of, the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, which released this White Paper, I am not a China expert at all, so I have no idea how this institution scales in the world of authorities in China. Anyways, the document states that Web Three technology is an inevitable trend for future Internet industry development. The Commission aims to construct Beijing as a global innovation hub for the digital economy. To that end, Beijing's Chaoyang district will spend at least 100 million yuan, $14 million every single year until 2025. Not that much money, but still, it's more than zero. This got on CZ's radar. Who gave a take? Interesting timing on this web.
00:18:30.494 - 00:18:41.234, Speaker A: Three white paper, he says. Not sure of the authenticity. Lots of talks about NFTs VR AI metaverse, et cetera. Looks like ByteDance. JD and Baidu each have their sections. Gavin Wood and Beeple were mentioned. Web Three.
00:18:41.234 - 00:18:44.270, Speaker A: Web three web3 people mentioned. Yeah. Gavin Wood.
00:18:44.350 - 00:18:50.760, Speaker B: Yeah, look, someone actually printed this out too. It's an actual printout of the white Paper in paper form. Imagine that.
00:18:51.130 - 00:19:16.006, Speaker A: And so this is the most interesting part of this article, this white Paper to me. Hong Kong securities and Futures Commission released a rulebook for the crypto industry last year stating that retail investors can start trading crypto from June 1. What? Okay, first, this is Hong Kong, not China, which is an important difference. Although valence strong valence?
00:19:16.038 - 00:19:31.950, Speaker B: Is it an important difference? Yes. No, it almost seems like the experimental zone for the rest of China. The financial experimental zone. But go on. This is the securities and Futures Commission. So is that like the equivalent of if the SEC and CFTC combined?
00:19:32.110 - 00:19:34.034, Speaker A: That's what this is inside of Hong Kong? Yeah.
00:19:34.072 - 00:19:34.834, Speaker B: Okay, go ahead.
00:19:34.872 - 00:19:57.594, Speaker A: Stated that retail investors can start trading crypto from June 1. So, first off, congrats to Hong Kong for getting rules. Really happy for you. And if this was mainland China, this would be massive. Hong Kong is a great pigeonhole, great foothold, great beachhead for the rest of China. But retail investors can start trading crypto. Wow.
00:19:57.594 - 00:19:59.286, Speaker A: Well, that's just fantastic.
00:19:59.398 - 00:20:37.858, Speaker B: This is is there was also a segment, I guess, on TV in China. So from the China Central Television, CZ called the Chinese community buzzing after Bitcoin was seen on TV in a segment and of course, this is pretty tightly controlled state media, so very intentional to choose to show bitcoin or not. This is like buy Bitcoin, withdraw cash redeem. I don't know again what all of this means. David. It's difficult to parse, but there seems to be a warming to crypto in China.
00:20:37.954 - 00:20:48.534, Speaker A: In the west are still trying to figure this out because we don't know how big of a deal this agency is. The segment that you're talking about is actually taken down. So it's taken down retrospectively.
00:20:48.582 - 00:20:49.498, Speaker B: Well, that's not great.
00:20:49.584 - 00:21:18.322, Speaker A: So others have said Wu blockchain his tweets. This is an unimportant governance department in Beijing and it is just deliberately exaggerating emotions. It's focused on the AI. And metaverse, while the Chinese government is nothing supportive of crypto. So some people are saying it's a nothing burger. I am in a couple chats, asking some Chinese friends and other people's opinions about, like, Yo, what's the deal here? How legit is this? And there is contention. No one can come to consensus on this.
00:21:18.376 - 00:21:38.426, Speaker B: Oh, really? Some people are saying, hey, it's a big deal. Others are saying it's not a big deal at all. Yeah, that's kind of the question. I guess maybe that's the measured take. But China really, I think, has been an enigma on crypto. So very difficult to discern. But I guess one take on this is, I think, whenever, you know.
00:21:38.426 - 00:21:53.082, Speaker B: So China and the US. Of course are economic rivals. Rivals in many different ways, it seems like. Increasingly if the US. Goes hard on banning crypto. Negative on crypto. I think China will in turn support Crypto.
00:21:53.082 - 00:21:56.480, Speaker B: Like if the US. Zigs China's going to Zag take?
00:21:57.170 - 00:21:57.934, Speaker A: Yeah, Right.
00:21:57.972 - 00:22:00.062, Speaker B: Which is probably long term bullish.
00:22:00.126 - 00:22:01.038, Speaker A: Good for crypto.
00:22:01.134 - 00:22:08.770, Speaker B: Yeah. Now on the back of this, even in Hong Kong, I don't see a whole bunch of crypto projects being like, all right, cool.
00:22:08.840 - 00:22:09.386, Speaker A: Hong Kong.
00:22:09.438 - 00:22:29.162, Speaker B: We're moving to Hong Kong. Let's do it right. And so until I see that sort of skin in the game and stake, I think the market will be pretty undecided as to whether China is actually warming to crypto or whether this is just a flash in the pan. And the thing is, I feel like China has changed its mind on crypto so many times.
00:22:29.216 - 00:22:48.946, Speaker A: If China came in and said, we are so bullish on crypto, like we're going to allow everyone to do anything, and that would be really bullish for a moment, and then they could completely change their mind, as they have already done five times over the next year. And so, even if we got the most bullish news possible out of China, no one would be like, okay, but are you serious though? Because we don't really know.
00:22:49.048 - 00:22:53.422, Speaker B: So, mixed review on this news, but probably more positive than certainly negative.
00:22:53.486 - 00:22:54.974, Speaker A: Right trending in the right direction.
00:22:55.022 - 00:22:59.878, Speaker B: Worst case, it's a nothing. Burger but there could be something here. Tell me about the end game that is correct.
00:22:59.964 - 00:23:03.922, Speaker A: It is not bearish. If there's anything we know, it is not bearish.
00:23:03.986 - 00:23:10.298, Speaker B: There we go. Tell me about the end game for Celsius, though. David, you promised. Am I going to get out of this account?
00:23:10.384 - 00:23:11.462, Speaker A: Are you ready for this headline?
00:23:11.526 - 00:23:13.210, Speaker B: Ryan I don't know.
00:23:13.280 - 00:23:18.170, Speaker A: I'll brace my fahrenheit wins bid to acquire assets of insolvent.
00:23:19.070 - 00:23:22.570, Speaker B: Are AIS writing these CoinDesk articles now?
00:23:22.640 - 00:23:29.822, Speaker A: Crypto consortium Fahrenheit has won a bid to acquire the insolvent lender Celsius network, whose assets were previously valued at around $2 billion. Oh, okay.
00:23:29.876 - 00:23:35.614, Speaker B: I thought they got this wrong. I thought they converted Celsius to Fahrenheit. Fahrenheit is the winner of the bid.
00:23:35.662 - 00:24:01.442, Speaker A: Crypto consortium called Fahrenheit has purchased apologies, freedom units taking the victory here. Okay, so the group will acquire Celsius institutional loan portfolio, staked, cryptocurrencies mining unit, and additional alternative investments. So the plan proposes that all of Celsius assets except Liquid Cryptocurrencies will be transferred to a newly formed company, Nuco. And so here's the deal. Here's the deal. Are you ready for Aaron?
00:24:01.506 - 00:24:01.926, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm ready.
00:24:01.948 - 00:24:02.426, Speaker A: What you're going to get?
00:24:02.448 - 00:24:03.274, Speaker B: Do I get anything?
00:24:03.392 - 00:24:15.150, Speaker A: If your Celsius bag is more than $5,000, you will get a small distribution and become a shareholder in this new company, which is going to have some private equity, some mining assets, et cetera.
00:24:15.490 - 00:24:18.734, Speaker B: It's a little bit more than five k. That's what I get?
00:24:18.932 - 00:24:59.526, Speaker A: Yes, perhaps. And so what does Celsius currently have to give all these new shareholders of this new company? They have some DFI crypto assets. They have a loan book, loan book portfolio, PE and VC investments, liquid Cryptocurrency, about $500 million and also mining assets because Celsius wanted to buy bitcoin miners because they thought that was a good thing to do with the money. So this new plan proposes that all of these except the Liquid Crypto assets will go into a newly formed company, Nuco. 100% of the equity in this new company will go to the creditors that are owed more than $5,000. Pro rada. Those owed less than $5,000 will get $0.70
00:24:59.526 - 00:25:02.422, Speaker A: on the dollar. That's the on their claims. And no equity.
00:25:02.486 - 00:25:19.810, Speaker B: If you are a Celsius holder, it's a totally different deal if you have 5000 or less. If you have less or less than 5000, I should say, then you just get 70%. So you get a 30% haircut and you get 70% and no equity. If you have more than $5,000, you get this new co equity.
00:25:21.830 - 00:25:34.966, Speaker A: Depending on how they're marking this. Say you have ether in Celsius and Celsius goes insolvent. That ether was priced higher. So like 70% on your dollar. For a force hold of ether for.
00:25:34.988 - 00:25:38.806, Speaker B: That amount of time. Think about that. If it's marked to market at the.
00:25:38.828 - 00:25:42.966, Speaker A: If it's marked to market, which I think I don't know how they're doing that.
00:25:43.148 - 00:25:51.790, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know that detail. That'd be a good question. 70% on the dollar for the claims and no equity. Yeah, it depends on what the value the ether was at the time, certainly.
00:25:51.940 - 00:26:13.154, Speaker A: Okay, so if you are a creditor above $5,000, you should not expect to see much returns after you get all the deductions. So you get the distribution of the liquid crypto assets that is left after they pay out the sub 5000 people. Any share of the Monies that Celsius gets from suing Machinsky. So that's fun. And then you also get the share of this new company equity. You are not getting.
00:26:13.192 - 00:26:15.778, Speaker B: He has no money. Come on. You're not going to get anything.
00:26:15.864 - 00:26:17.362, Speaker A: No, he cashed out a lot of money.
00:26:17.416 - 00:26:17.922, Speaker B: Oh, really?
00:26:17.976 - 00:26:19.698, Speaker A: He cashed out hundreds of millions, him and his wife.
00:26:19.714 - 00:26:19.942, Speaker B: Okay.
00:26:19.996 - 00:26:27.106, Speaker A: Yeah. Along with all the other yes. Big clawbacks. Big clawbacks. I mean, I don't know how much that's going to translate.
00:26:27.218 - 00:26:28.710, Speaker B: Equity, then revenge.
00:26:29.530 - 00:26:37.738, Speaker A: Okay, so there are new managers and investors also that need to be paid. So $35 million per year salary to be paid to the management team of this new company.
00:26:37.824 - 00:26:39.260, Speaker B: Who are these guys?
00:26:41.230 - 00:27:10.966, Speaker A: The Fahrenheit team, who will be putting $50 million of their own money to buy the shares of this new company. Their equity is subjected to a two year lockup that they can sell up to 30% of their equity after one year. If Celsius equity trades at 150% of net asset value after one year, the Fahrenheit team has the option to dump on you. If Celsius equity tokens increase in value, fahrenheit can sell in one year. If the value of this new equity token goes up by 50, what are.
00:27:10.988 - 00:27:14.626, Speaker B: They going to do? What's their business? Are they going to take in private equity?
00:27:14.658 - 00:27:22.710, Speaker A: Right. They're just going to take it, reshuffle it, try and rebuild it. Same thing was going on with FTX 2.0 right now. It's like they're also trying to restart that exchange.
00:27:22.870 - 00:27:32.174, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm not bullish on this equity. I'd rather get 70% of my money back right now rather than have this.
00:27:32.292 - 00:27:35.018, Speaker A: I think you had more than $5,000 in Celsius.
00:27:35.114 - 00:27:53.474, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, not much more, but I don't love this, but I don't know. The new managers schmalk. Schmaminsky is going to be the new manager. Is there anything like the old managers like, come on, this doesn't help?
00:27:53.512 - 00:28:02.178, Speaker A: Well, hey, if you have enough money to buy a company like this to make a bid in this state in the market, you got to be doing something not terrible, but that's hopeful.
00:28:02.274 - 00:28:07.590, Speaker B: Fahrenheit. All right, so we're fahrenheit freedom outside of the is that what they're called? Freedom units?
00:28:08.250 - 00:28:09.334, Speaker A: Yeah. Fahrenheit. Yeah.
00:28:09.372 - 00:28:17.158, Speaker B: Oh, my God. You're making a joke about. The fahrenheit system rather than the metric system. All right, exactly. I thought that was the token they're called, like, freedom units. It wouldn't surprise me. All right, David.
00:28:17.158 - 00:28:48.082, Speaker B: Well, let's move on from Celsius. I want to leave that in the distant past here. I want to talk about where we are today in the crypto market right now. And this is a question for the OGS. Is this crypto winter darker than the last? What inspired this question for me was I saw this tweet from Iceberg who said, every chat I'm in is super depressed about the current state of crypto. I don't know what chats this individual is in. They look like kind of a dev angel investor focused on crypto, NFTs and bitcoin.
00:28:48.082 - 00:29:14.254, Speaker B: So probably a crypto trader type, but definitely follow price as closely as we do. So that kind of begged the question to me, is this crypto winter darker than the last one? And I put out a question to the OGS. I got a bunch of fantastic responses. Maybe I'll read a couple and then I'll get your way in. So Dan McGardle says no, not at all. In 2011. And by the way, Dan's been through about all of these.
00:29:14.254 - 00:29:33.026, Speaker B: In 2011, negative 94% he's talking about. I think he's talking about bitcoin price primarily. So not full crypto market cap. So 2011 was negative 94%, was easy to fear. It was done for decades. Crypto was done for decades. 2015, we got a negative 87%.
00:29:33.026 - 00:29:48.898, Speaker B: That was the bear market there. 2019, negative 84%. That was the last one. But Digital gold had caught on. The beginning of D five were apparent 2023, we're only down 78%. Centralized stuff failed. Oh, well, every other bear market was worse.
00:29:48.898 - 00:30:13.566, Speaker B: So Dan's take was every other bear market was worse. And he brought some data points objectively rather than 2011, negative 94%. 2019, negative 84%. Bitcoin at least is only negative 8%. So that's a take. Brantley ETH says not even close. Crypto is an order of magnitude bigger, more developed, better funded now, and has a far lower chance of total failure at this point.
00:30:13.566 - 00:30:46.154, Speaker B: DC Investor says no because we are not dealing with existential crisis, but we got big enough this time where mainstream questions the value prop like the natives last time. A lot of responses to this, from what I could tell. Most of the OGS here's, anthony Sassano says, not even close. Last bear market, people were questioning if crypto would even survive this bear market. There's more genuine, actual, long term focus building going on than I've ever seen before. Most of the OGS are saying, no, it's not worse. Do you concur? What's your take on this question?
00:30:46.272 - 00:31:20.742, Speaker A: I think there's two sides of this conversation. I think almost by definition, OGS who have seen two bull markets. So that's you, that's me, that's suzano. That's a number of these people here. By definition, it's not as bad for them because a one they've done it before and B, they bought in at like ten x lower prices to begin with. So for them specifically, it's not as bad because they're just in a little bit more of a cushy position. I think everyone's first bear market feels the same, stresses them out in unique and different and unique ways and that is always going to be the same.
00:31:20.742 - 00:31:46.334, Speaker A: Everyone's first bear market, their conviction is going to be tested. Last bear market, we had certain challenges that we do not have this time. And this bear market, we have new challenges that we did not have last time. Last time, Ethereum funding was about to go to zero and we were about to have to pause development to figure that out. Right. And we legitimately had no use cases on the app layer. Why Ethereum inspired me in 2017 to 2018, I can't remember.
00:31:46.334 - 00:32:27.654, Speaker A: It was just like the vision, I guess it was around, yeah, the hope for that it could be something Reed did not have, the regulatory oversight and like Gary Gensler and Chokepoint 2.0. So that is a new challenge and that is what these current people who are going through this bear market are questioning themselves about, not about what's the utility, et cetera, et cetera. And so, yes, every single bear market, the stress from every single bear market for every single new cycler is always valid and unique. And I would also agree that, yes, these challenges are different and perhaps easier, but they are still extremely tough challenges. So I'm a little bit on both sides.
00:32:27.782 - 00:33:07.558, Speaker B: What's kind of interesting is this is sort of almost a bear market defined by a negative regulatory reaction, negative nation state reaction to crypto. And that just means we're there, we're at the end of the level. This is round one of the boss fight, right? And we're fighting the final boss. This won't be the only battle. I think the final boss will take multiple forms, but that's how far we've actually come. And if you had told me in 2019 that the 2023 bear market would go down to just less than a trillion dollars, I'd be like, Bear market? Wait, what?
00:33:07.644 - 00:33:16.890, Speaker A: Yeah, but that's just because of when you got in, though. It's just like your disposition as a result of the place that you started in the crypto industry.
00:33:17.470 - 00:33:56.326, Speaker B: I guess what I'm saying is, objectively, at $1 trillion, we got some punch. There's something here in crypto and that means something. But I totally acknowledge that everyone's bear market probably feels just about the same. So if this is your first time, it probably feels like the first time comparably to an OG. But that's why I do think OGS can kind of take the perspective a little bit. They have a valuable perspective in that they can say objectively rather than my own feelings. Objectively, is this a harder bear market than previous? And they're saying, anyway, it's not worse than the last one.
00:33:56.428 - 00:34:02.010, Speaker A: The threat of crypto not coming back is completely gone in my mind, and that is the big difference.
00:34:02.160 - 00:34:03.770, Speaker B: David, what do we have coming up next?
00:34:03.840 - 00:34:33.394, Speaker A: Coming up next, Blend Blur's new NFP lending platform is putting in numbers. We got the world Coin raise to talk about USDC natively on Arbitrum. We got some MoonPay executives pocketing $150,000,000 before shuttering the company Oof, and so much more to talk about. But first, a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors, especially MetaMask and MetaMask Learn to learn about all of the crazy crypto jargon that Ryan and I sometimes use without explaining ourselves. So if we do that, sorry. But also, MetaMask Learn has a product to learn all about that. So let's go hear from them right now.
00:34:33.394 - 00:35:17.390, Speaker A: Learning about crypto is hard until now. Introducing MetaMask Learn, an open educational platform about crypto, Web Three, self custody, wallet management, and all the other topics needed to onboard people into this crazy world of crypto. MetaMask Learn is an interactive platform, with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand, giving you actual practical experience for navigating web3. The purpose of MetaMask Learn is to teach people the basics of self custody and wallet security in a safe environment. And while MetaMask Learn always takes the time to define web3 specific vocabulary, it is still a jargon free experience for the crypto. Curious, user friendly, not scary. MetaMask Learn is available in ten languages, with more to be added soon, and it's meant to cater to a global Web Three audience.
00:35:17.390 - 00:36:09.454, Speaker A: So are you tired of having to explain crypto concepts to your friends? Go to learn MetaMask IO and add MetaMask Learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of web3. Mantle is a brand new high performance ethereum layer two network built differently from the other layer twos you may be familiar with. Mantle is a modular layer two built on the Op stack, but uses eigen layer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer one. Not only does this reduce Mantle's gas fees by 80% compared to other layer two s, but it also reduces gas fee volatility. Mantle has a decentralized sequencer set, eliminating the risk of downtime and censorship on the network. And because Mantle implements multiparty computation nodes, layer one settlement execution is shortened from seven days to as low as just one or two. Mantle is the first layer two built by a dow and is backed by one of the biggest dow treasuries in the world, bitdao.
00:36:09.454 - 00:37:04.370, Speaker A: Mantle already has subcommunities from around web3 onboarded to help the growth of Mantle, like game Seven for web3 gaming, or Dao for the world of DSI and Bybit for TVL Liquidity and Onramps. Check out Mantle at Mantle XYZ and follow them on Twitter at zero Xmantle. Blend Blur's NFT lending platform has put in some absolute numbers, loan volumes of $308,000,000 in the past 22 days. Why 22? Because it launched 22 days ago. So in addition to the NFT trading platform that we all know as Blur, their Blend platform is doing something like 20% to 30% of the total platform's revenue. So Azukis amassed 70,000 Ether in loan volume, coming from 6500 loans, coming in at number one in the preferred NFT borrowing collection on Blend. Crypto Punks coming in at 35,000 ETH in loan volume, Meladys coming in at 22 and a half thousand.
00:37:04.370 - 00:37:12.786, Speaker A: So we all knew that NFT phi was a thing, but Blend from Blur has just like, dropped an absolute cannonball in the world of NFT finance.
00:37:12.818 - 00:37:19.654, Speaker B: This has just exploded. So 82% of the NFT lending market, can you just explain what is an NFT loan? David yeah.
00:37:19.692 - 00:37:23.866, Speaker A: So you put up your NFT as collateral and then you loan some money.
00:37:23.968 - 00:37:25.690, Speaker B: You take it to the pawn shop, basically.
00:37:25.840 - 00:37:26.406, Speaker A: Yep.
00:37:26.518 - 00:37:28.106, Speaker B: Take to the pawn shop and pay.
00:37:28.128 - 00:37:36.634, Speaker A: You back your Ether, your USDC, I'm assuming this is all Ether and then you get your NFT back or you don't and you get liquidated and somebody buys your NFT as a put on the NFT.
00:37:36.762 - 00:37:50.206, Speaker B: Wow. So this could cause some tears if NFTs go up again and somebody ponded off and sold the bottom effectively. That's very interesting, though. It's good to see NFT phi taking off. Tell me about the coinbase wallet.
00:37:50.238 - 00:38:19.962, Speaker A: David yeah, so Coinbase Wallet has introduced gas free USDC transactions on polygon. So you can send USDC on polygon using the Coinbase Wallet for free. Coinbase will cover your gas fees. I was wondering what the mechanism behind this. And so this is actually using EIP 3009, which is in the account abstraction category. So it's using this EIP 3009 transfer with authorization. It's a meta transaction which is again, part of the whole account abstraction thing.
00:38:19.962 - 00:39:10.302, Speaker A: And so Coinbase just relays the transaction, pays the matic gas fee and you get free USDT transfers on polygon. I think this is a cool marginal improvement for a narrow use case, which is USCC in Coinbase Wallet on polygon. But I think why this is a big deal is that it extrapolates very, very well. As soon as EIP 4844 comes dank Sharding and gas fees on layer two s come, there's going to be a fight for consumers, for Wallet users, for transactors on chain. And it's going to come to like I bet you most transactions on chain from retail users end up being free because someone's going to subsidize that because that is a competitive advantage. They should be free. Predicting this with this information I'm loosely held prediction most transactions from retail end users are just going to be free.
00:39:10.356 - 00:39:14.960, Speaker B: On layer twos or free or they might get paid.
00:39:16.050 - 00:39:17.038, Speaker A: That's a different story.
00:39:17.124 - 00:39:35.282, Speaker B: Well, this is really interesting because this is a key element of UX. Imagine the crypto experience right now. Imagine if you were to transfer money from somebody in Venmo. You actually had to have like, PayPal stock portion of PayPal stock to pay that fee to transfer. That's bad. UX. And so this is working on that problem here.
00:39:35.282 - 00:39:55.900, Speaker B: By the way, USDC is now natively on Arbitrum. Well, actually, not yet. Sorry, you got to wait seven days. June eigth. It will be natively on Arbitrum, so it's good news for layer twos as well. David, what is going on here? MoonPay executives pocketed $150,000,000 raised from Series A. Of course, this is the account.
00:39:55.900 - 00:39:59.434, Speaker B: Web Three is going just great from our friend Molly White.
00:39:59.472 - 00:40:00.138, Speaker A: Molly's account?
00:40:00.224 - 00:40:03.422, Speaker B: Yeah, of course it would be her. Hey, Molly, how are you doing?
00:40:03.476 - 00:40:04.570, Speaker A: What's up, Molly?
00:40:04.730 - 00:40:09.502, Speaker B: Okay, so what is the story here? What dastardly deed just went on in Web Three again?
00:40:09.556 - 00:40:32.598, Speaker A: MoonPay Insiders CEO Ivan Soto Wright and along with others, sold $150,000,000 of their own equity in their Series A raise in 2021. So MoonPay raised $555,000,000 at a $3.4 billion valuation, and then the founders cashed out $150,000,000 of that right before a crypto crash. Not a good look.
00:40:32.684 - 00:40:33.222, Speaker B: Not great.
00:40:33.276 - 00:40:34.022, Speaker A: Not a good look.
00:40:34.076 - 00:40:58.126, Speaker B: VCs have some responsibility in the kind of their documents and raises to not let this happen to them, because if you're an investor, this kind of thing does not feel good if you just invested in a company and the founders are already exiting before they've seen it through. Right. So I guess a little bit like, shame on the VCs who also did this too, but also shame on MoonPay. It's just bad form to do this.
00:40:58.228 - 00:41:04.270, Speaker A: It's definitely a if it bleeds, it leads type of headline. Maybe the VCs were okay with it for some particular reason.
00:41:04.340 - 00:41:04.622, Speaker B: Maybe.
00:41:04.676 - 00:41:17.630, Speaker A: But, man, MoonPay was inside of one single bull market. As a founder, I would feel bad if I exited inside of the same bull market, right? Like, exit in the next bull market. That's the social contract after you get.
00:41:17.640 - 00:41:20.022, Speaker B: The thing done and it's really there and it's really built.
00:41:20.076 - 00:41:21.990, Speaker A: Hey, maybe they consider it done.
00:41:22.060 - 00:41:40.682, Speaker B: Paradigm, I think the most prestigious, one of the better VC companies in crypto, I would say, is broadening its crypto only focus to areas including AI. So paradigm just caught the AI bug. That's the story here. David, are they abandoning crypto? Is paradigm done with crypto. What's going on?
00:41:40.816 - 00:42:13.730, Speaker A: So they have changed their bio on Twitter. They've also changed some of their website. So it used to be Paradigm backs disruptive crypto, web Three companies and protocols. And now it's paradigm is a research driven technology investment firm. There was a line we believe crypto will define the next few decades was removed from the home page, which now makes no mention of Web Three or Blockchains. And so there comment from a source for the block which wrote an article about this. This change doesn't mean the company is shying away from crypto, but rather highlighting its reach into adjacent areas such as AI.
00:42:13.730 - 00:42:30.410, Speaker A: So Paradigm gets the AI bug, changes up their website. And why is this news? Because people are talking about it on crypto Twitter. They're like, paradigm are now grifters. They never were committed to crypto in the first place. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. What's your take on this, Ryan?
00:42:31.230 - 00:43:03.686, Speaker B: I don't think so. And look, VCs are going to go where the opportunities are for VCs. So, look, if crypto is jealous about that, I don't really understand that take. I guess I will say that there is an element where a lot of investors, though, in general, the shine has worn off of crypto. AI is the new hot thing from an investor perspective. Right, right. And I think that there's some opportunity in that because when everyone else the best time to actually be looking at AI was probably like 2021.
00:43:03.686 - 00:43:14.378, Speaker B: You know what I mean? Like right before. But everyone was focused on crypto. Yeah, I think it's kind of a no story. Maybe crypto is feeling a little bitter about being forgotten here.
00:43:14.544 - 00:43:36.106, Speaker A: I think it's right. I think it's exactly that meme of the guy looking over his shoulder and his girlfriend, the crypto girlfriend, is like, who are you looking at? And the paradigm is looking at AI. Again, why are we talking about this take? Well, because there was a decent number of people, decent number of people on crypto Twitter who were like, up in arms about this. In my mind, this isn't news.
00:43:36.228 - 00:43:37.730, Speaker B: Y'all are just bored.
00:43:38.790 - 00:43:41.714, Speaker A: So why are we talking about this? We're talking about it because other people.
00:43:41.752 - 00:43:42.594, Speaker B: Are talking about it.
00:43:42.632 - 00:43:50.142, Speaker A: Last week, three weeks ago, people were canceling bankless. Two weeks ago, people were canceling ledger. And now people are canceling Paradigm because they changed.
00:43:50.206 - 00:43:51.602, Speaker B: Oh, people are canceling paradigm.
00:43:51.666 - 00:43:56.806, Speaker A: Yeah, this is why this is news. It's like people are trying to cancel Paradigm. No, this is you betrayed us.
00:43:56.828 - 00:43:57.554, Speaker B: This is paradigm.
00:43:57.602 - 00:44:00.294, Speaker A: Paradigm has like a billion dollars that they betrayed crypto.
00:44:00.342 - 00:44:19.758, Speaker B: In crypto, though, there is news. It's layoff season finance layoffs. They're calling this a Pruning of non performers. And they have laid off, apparently 20% of their workforce. I believe that's correct. They had 8000 employees. Yeah, it's a lot, right? So 20% down.
00:44:19.758 - 00:44:41.010, Speaker B: Also just noticed this week, Nanson analytics company, great product they've built. They just laid off 30% of their workforce. So the CEO kind of wrote about this and this was his take. It's extremely difficult decision. We announced a reduction of our team by 30%. Two reasons for this. First, we scaled up the team on the back of breakneck growth.
00:44:41.010 - 00:45:06.560, Speaker B: It's kind of a whiplash. Crypto was expanding so fast, you felt like you needed to hire a ton, and now you have to take that off. And this year has been brutal for crypto markets. So I think crypto startups, crypto companies are taking an opportunity to sort of Prune and to scale back right now. And that's just the way things are in the bear market. These companies aren't going anywhere. I'm very confident of that.
00:45:06.560 - 00:45:13.934, Speaker B: They are just taking some time to kind of Prune. Coinbase did this earlier in the year. Gemini did this, kraken did this.
00:45:13.972 - 00:45:30.422, Speaker A: All the big companies have laid people off. This is just a normal part of the market cycle. There is the layoff phase for every company and really if you are optimizing for growth and you are not laying people off in the bear market, you haven't picked the correct optimization point.
00:45:30.476 - 00:45:36.662, Speaker B: That's what Brian Armstrong straight told us with his policy the last time we had him on the always.
00:45:36.716 - 00:45:47.558, Speaker A: It's sad to see layoffs. It's like an unfortunate headline for the company. But if you are not laying people off, then you didn't hire enough in the bull market. So this is normal.
00:45:47.654 - 00:46:03.280, Speaker B: Expand, contract, expand, contract. That's how things grow here. Speaking of expansion, WorldCoin just getting ready to expand. Mightily I think here. Sam Altman and company raised $115,000,000 for the WorldCoin project. What is the significance of this?
00:46:03.730 - 00:46:22.022, Speaker A: Well, the WorldCoin is really putting rubber down onto pavement and so they are just ramping up everything. I feel like they think that they are primed to take the next big steps as a company to scan more people's eyeballs, to get more orbs out into the world and actually go from kind of a monolith to more of a modular company which is part of the whole world.
00:46:22.076 - 00:46:27.538, Speaker B: Every time you say that, scan people's eyeballs with an orb, it can't not sound dystopian.
00:46:27.714 - 00:47:02.866, Speaker A: I'm sorry, it is dystopian. The reason why I'm comfortable saying those words is because I have accepted that biometric scanning is a valid attempt to produce civil resistance. And once you accept that premise, you understand that, then it's like, okay, well, what are you going to scan? Fingerprints? What are you going to scan your face? Well, you need to scan something and the iris is the most civil resistant part of your body. So if you accept these assumptions then you get, okay, we're going to have to scan everything.
00:47:03.048 - 00:47:10.434, Speaker B: But think of this. I get that. So technically this may be the right solution, but think of this crypto bros want to go on you.
00:47:10.632 - 00:47:12.966, Speaker A: The optics are terrible. And that's world. Who is it?
00:47:12.988 - 00:47:18.386, Speaker B: Oh, it's the maker of chat GPT. The most powerful AI on the planet wants to be the orb.
00:47:18.418 - 00:47:24.694, Speaker A: Is this chrome ball that all these WorldCoin employees have a habit of pulling out of their backpack?
00:47:24.742 - 00:47:38.800, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there could be all press is good press kind of thing. This is very attention grabby in a way. I just wonder if it just segues itself off a cliff rather than actually works. That's my big question right now.
00:47:39.650 - 00:48:42.898, Speaker A: If you're concerned about how the WorldCoin Project is going to work or not, you should pay attention to how people are trying to game it. And that is definitely currently underway. Right now people are trying to game WorldCoin because the idea of WorldCoin and part of what they're raising money for is that they make building the orb more permissionless and they also make scanning eyeballs also more permissionless. So you have like orb agents, god agents of the orb or agents of the orb who are not employed by WorldCoin who are incentivized to go scan people's eyeballs because the protocol pays them to do that. It's like a referral fee. I know this is so as soon as you incentivize that to happen, well how are you going to get to 8 billion people? You have to do this in a permissionless incentive driven way and so they pay you in WorldCoin to scan people's eyeballs as like a referral fee. And so then people are going to be like okay, do I need to go scan individuals or can I game the system somehow? And so people are trying to game the World Coin protocol and civil attack it.
00:48:42.898 - 00:48:53.590, Speaker A: And if the WorldCoin protocol stands up to those civil attackers who are paid to try to attack the thing and it still works, you got to be bullish on the system.
00:48:53.740 - 00:49:03.770, Speaker B: I'm sorry, I think it's purporting to solve a massive problem. That is the upside here. It's like identity, some kind of an onchain identity solution.
00:49:04.350 - 00:49:06.858, Speaker A: But wow, the branding is not great.
00:49:06.944 - 00:49:16.654, Speaker B: One thing they have to really do is they have to get the privacy maximalists on their side. I think they have to get the decentralization maximalists on their side because they're not going to get the centralizers on their side.
00:49:16.772 - 00:49:22.526, Speaker A: The nation state level wants vectors to hate WorldCoin. I think that one is actually the easiest to account for.
00:49:22.708 - 00:49:23.838, Speaker B: What? Which one?
00:49:23.924 - 00:49:34.562, Speaker A: Privacy. Privacy is pretty easy to not. They have all of the like here's how we don't collect your data, that's all available. And I think you have to get.
00:49:34.616 - 00:49:41.526, Speaker B: People who I respect in the privacy community to independently audit this. It can't just be WorldCoin being like.
00:49:41.708 - 00:49:44.002, Speaker A: I would love Zuko's take on WorldCoin.
00:49:44.066 - 00:50:14.950, Speaker B: Zuko's take? Yeah, a few of the other privacy maximalists we've had on Matt from Hopkins, remember we had him on podcast. I would love his take. Anyway, interesting, a lot of money, big war chest here and some major investors coming in including Blockchain Capital A 16, Z, Bain Capital, et cetera. So it's definitely a lot of VC firepower here. Speaking of which, Magic just raised 52 million to grow crypto wallet as a service used by corporate clients like Mattel and Macy's.
00:50:15.130 - 00:50:34.082, Speaker A: Yeah, these guys have been around for a while. They used to be called Fortmatic Wallet if you remember that. Way back people, I actually haven't heard about them in a very long time, but I remember working with them back in my last startup as like hey, we need wallets for people who don't give a shit about crypto.
00:50:34.146 - 00:50:36.130, Speaker B: Very practical, very practical approach.
00:50:36.210 - 00:50:46.542, Speaker A: Very similar to Coinbase's service system that they built up. Yeah, so congrats to the magic people. You guys have been heads down building for a very long time. Very good project, David.
00:50:46.626 - 00:50:47.626, Speaker B: We have coming up next.
00:50:47.728 - 00:51:14.254, Speaker A: Coming up next, we got questions from the nation. We're going to talk about Lido's dominance. We're also going to talk about whether or not Ethereum is better or worse because it has a respective and visionary thought leader. Vitalik, of course, takes of the week and what Ryan and I are bullish on. And then we got a song a day from song a day man. And we will get started with all of that stuff as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible.

00:52:53.352 - 00:53:26.094, Speaker B: In the show notes questions from the nation today. Of course, these are asked in the Bankless Discord, which is available to all bankless citizens. Here's the question given Lido's dominance in staking share and clear intentions not to self limit their shares rocket Pool's Dao did. Would it be possible for the Ethereum Foundation to implement a cap on the maximum share any protocol can control? While not ideal. Would it be possible to implement a protocol upgrade as a last resort to protect the network from majority control? Blue Furball asks this question david, what do you think?
00:53:26.132 - 00:54:06.838, Speaker A: So there's two parts of this question that I think are worth pulling out. Would it be possible for the Ethereum Foundation to implement a cap? And then is that cap even possible at all? So EIPS come from many different places. Whether or not the Ethereum Foundation has deemed it appropriate to actually push and promote an EIP, EIPS are discovered more emergently, like the Ethereum Foundation didn't push 4844. Dankrad and Proto Lambda, who's now on optimism. These people came up with Dank Sharding and then pushed that. I'll just throw an objection to the idea that the Ethereum Foundation is implemented.
00:54:06.854 - 00:54:13.622, Speaker B: I would say they can. I mean, you have to get client devs on board as it can come from EF researchers.
00:54:13.686 - 00:54:43.782, Speaker A: So if like Dankrad and Justin Drake came to consensus about an EIP, then, yeah, that came from the EF. But they are influential, yes, and they are in the EF. So semantics here. But the bigger question is like can we influence a cap? And that answer is no, we cannot, because the Ethereum beacon chain does not actually know what is an entity and what is a solo staker. It doesn't have information about who is what. And so that is a subjective thing that is something external to the protocol. So it's not actually possible.
00:54:43.782 - 00:54:59.450, Speaker A: How would you determine who's got what ether where the Ethereum protocol is not aware of that fact. And so there's no way to actually enforce decentralization at the protocol layer. That's part of the layer zero.
00:54:59.600 - 00:55:10.062, Speaker B: So I think there was actually discussion this week, a lot of discussion on Lido this week and some concern about the share of the market. It's over 30%. I don't know if it's like 33.
00:55:10.116 - 00:55:13.726, Speaker A: 36%, somewhere in that range in the 60%.
00:55:13.908 - 00:55:45.178, Speaker B: No, it's not that high. What are you saying is a proportion of total ETH staked, of liquid staked ether. Okay, liquid staked ether, yes. But total ETH staked, it's closer to the low thirty s. And that's what protocol designers are really mostly concerned about, is the total proportion here. And if it gets over one third versus two thirds, there are different bad things that can possibly happen. Danny Ryan wrote a great post about this this week, which might refer you to as well.
00:55:45.178 - 00:55:58.986, Speaker B: So there's cause to be concerned. But the remedy is on the social layer. I think right now it's basically people saying, hey, don't stake with Lido, they have too much stake.
00:55:59.178 - 00:56:20.242, Speaker A: Interestingly enough, it's also where the problem arises, because Lido is explicitly a monopolistic dow they have explicitly stated no, our goal is to be the staking provider. We will not self cap because that's antagonistic to our vision for ourselves, which is to be the most decentralized staking as a service protocol.
00:56:20.386 - 00:56:48.990, Speaker B: But. Don't you think Ethereum needs to be resistant to that? So people often compare it to Prism. Prismatic, right. And they say, well, Prism took fantastic steps to sort of self limit their own growth. And there was a time where they were like 70% of the Beacon Chain client, right, and kind of growing. And now they're back down to like, what, 30% to 40%. What's different, though, with Prism versus this is there's no profit incentive for Prismatic to increase in market share.
00:56:48.990 - 00:57:04.322, Speaker B: In fact, it would only cause more hassle for them. I remember we talked to Preston Van Loon and Terrence from Prismatic after the Ethereum finality event and they were like, thank God there were other like it puts the burden off of us.
00:57:04.456 - 00:57:06.846, Speaker A: Lita does not say thank God there's rocket pool.
00:57:06.958 - 00:57:07.378, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:57:07.464 - 00:57:12.610, Speaker A: Lida looks at rocket pool and be like, I want your staked ETH, put it in my vault.
00:57:12.690 - 00:57:42.958, Speaker B: So what do we do about this? Is it a problem? What do we do about this? My answer for what we do about this is like level up. We have to have some staking competitors that are competitive with Lido and win the old fashioned way, which is a competitive tool set that people want to stake with. It's not happened yet, which is so maybe that's a bit like hand wavy. Right. Do you have a better answer?
00:57:43.044 - 00:58:16.282, Speaker A: Yeah, there's plenty of staking as a service dows coming on to the scene. So there's competition available, the supply of competition coming into the market is that's not a problem? Many people would like to start and are starting staking as a service orgs. Some differentiated, some not really. The big answer is we need solo stakers. So there was the rated network report that came out that there was 6.5% of validators on Ethereum are solo stakers. Which sounds like a small number, and maybe it is, but remember, 6.5%
00:58:16.282 - 00:58:42.418, Speaker A: are these ultimate hardliners who will not compromise ethereum till I die, go down with the ship. These are these type of people and you only need a minority of those to make sure the Ethereum is protected. There's still the concern of like, anything above 30% is bad. The Lido apologists will say, well, Lido itself is a decentralized.org it wants to be decentralized even more than it already is.
00:58:42.584 - 00:58:44.258, Speaker B: And it's taking steps, to be fair.
00:58:44.344 - 00:58:56.546, Speaker A: Taking steps, yes. And then the further Lido Apologists will just point at rocket pool and say, hey, that community, that rocket pool just is mad at Lido because rocket pool.
00:58:56.578 - 00:58:58.662, Speaker B: Wants that because they're in second place.
00:58:58.716 - 00:59:23.738, Speaker A: Because they're in second place. Right. Yeah. Granted, the culture around rocket pool is healthier for Ethereum. So if rocket pool had more and Lido had less, I would say that that would be objectively better for Ethereum. But you also have to be aware of the incentives for rocket pool in that community. Everyone wants to take down lido ultimately is the layer zero that is going to be the thing that protects Ethereum.
00:59:23.738 - 01:00:00.330, Speaker A: And so this is why anytime lido shifts into having too much control, you're going to get just like natural pushback from a nebulous set of participants with their own individual incentives. I will say, going back to my first point, though, making solo staking easier is going to always be the best answer. Yeah, there's always so much work to do with making and that's really what the EF should be doing, is making gui's for solo stakers GUI. So if you have to, as a solo staker, touch the command line, that's bad and we should not have that and we should fix that. And that's going to be a much better solution.
01:00:00.830 - 01:00:08.954, Speaker B: I think so, too. I think so too. But the layer zero is trying all sorts of things, including shame. Right? Shame is a shame layer zero strategy.
01:00:09.002 - 01:00:12.426, Speaker A: Lido stuff being so monopolistic, it's shaming.
01:00:12.458 - 01:00:23.650, Speaker B: Lido, but also shaming people who stake with lido. And that is a stick that layer zero can use. We got to have better sticks. We got to have better carrots and sticks than that.
01:00:23.720 - 01:00:28.946, Speaker A: Do you own any staked ETH at Bankless or do we only own our ETH? We don't own any R ETH, but we run many.
01:00:28.968 - 01:00:33.830, Speaker B: Are you talking about lido staked ETH? Lido staked, yeah. We don't own it at Bankless, but.
01:00:33.980 - 01:00:35.906, Speaker A: We do run rocket pool mini pools.
01:00:36.018 - 01:00:42.620, Speaker B: Yes. Oh, are you trying to virtue signal? Yes. David just slipped that in there.
01:00:44.190 - 01:00:45.660, Speaker A: We're doing our part.
01:00:46.750 - 01:01:32.006, Speaker B: All right, here's a question from here's a question from K Nas. What effect do you think it has on the evolution of the specific chain? The fact that Ethereum has a clear, respected and visionary thought leader? Vitalik, of course, compared to Bitcoin, that has none, really. What do you think about that? So Satoshi did the white paper thing. He's there for a little bit, he participated on various internet forums and then disappeared. Right. Vitalik, he founded this thing, created the White Paper, has not disappeared, has been active in shepherding this, I think, in a decentralized leader type of way. So it's very different from the model of a CEO.
01:01:32.006 - 01:01:51.310, Speaker B: But still, he has not abandoned the project, he's been working on it, even though most of the other Ethereum co founders did sort of abandon Ethereum early days. And I didn't honestly know what Vitalik would do, whether he would kind of stick with it or whether he'd do the Satoshi thing. Anyway, the question is, what effect do you think this has had on Ethereum?
01:01:51.730 - 01:02:20.678, Speaker A: I am grateful that Vitalik is the leader that he is. The bitcoiners will point to Vitalik and be like, look how centralized Ethereum is. Whatever Vitalik says goes to some degree, whatever Vitalik says goes isn't wrong, but it's not in the way that they're saying it is. They're saying, yeah, like, Vitalik is this dictator of Ethereum. It's like his way or the highway the only things that Vitalik feels strongly about are like the right things to feel strongly. He's just right. He's like the right leader.
01:02:20.678 - 01:02:22.886, Speaker A: And I say that as somebody who's.
01:02:22.918 - 01:02:29.322, Speaker B: Like, you follow Vitalik more like you might follow, like Gandhi, for instance. It's not like top down, it's more.
01:02:29.376 - 01:02:30.778, Speaker A: Bitcoiners are going to love that one.
01:02:30.864 - 01:02:37.566, Speaker B: You know what I mean? But seriously though, there's an element of like, he's earned it spiritual leadership here. He's earned it though, right.
01:02:37.668 - 01:02:55.726, Speaker A: And his track record is proven. Now, as somebody who spent the last two months with Vitalik and Suzalu and Montenegro, I can tell you he's doing many other things that are not ethereum. And so he is a leader across industries, across technologies. And so Ethereum is not the guy's.
01:02:55.758 - 01:02:56.690, Speaker B: Not his full time job.
01:02:56.760 - 01:03:18.170, Speaker A: The guy's a like, he's not the leader of ethereum. He's vitalik also. He has philosophical directions about how ethereum should be developed and stuff. But yeah, he's living a life and some of it happens to be concerned about Ethereum and other things he's concerned about, like network states and longevity and public goods.
01:03:19.710 - 01:03:49.334, Speaker B: The question of has this had an effect on Ethereum? Undoubtedly so. In fact, I would say ethereum would not be where it is if the leader kind of abandoned it. Not abandoned it, but just went Mia after the White Paper or after Ethereum 10. Right. It really needed some shepherding leadership. And I'm kind of reminded I'm a sucker for Founding America type of things, right. Founding Fathers, after they wrote the Constitution, they didn't just like, YEED out of there.
01:03:49.334 - 01:03:49.574, Speaker B: Right?
01:03:49.612 - 01:03:49.862, Speaker A: Right.
01:03:49.916 - 01:04:19.946, Speaker B: I mean, they were still even Washington won the Revolutionary War, served as president for a period of time. The country kind of needed that. There were a lot of questions that the original Constitution didn't solve. And so you needed a Bill of Rights and you needed to hash things out in, like, the Federalist Papers and all of these things. If the founders of the United States just left after the first White Paper of America was shipped, this would have been a complete mess. It took some time to sort all these things out. And I think the same is happening with Ethereum.
01:04:19.946 - 01:04:22.174, Speaker B: It's more complicated than Bitcoin, too. Yeah. Right.
01:04:22.212 - 01:04:33.010, Speaker A: Bitcoin had the luxury of being simple enough where the founder could just leave and it be okay. Ethereum was not that and is not that and needed that guidance from the people who are philosophically and ideologically aligned.
01:04:33.430 - 01:04:35.620, Speaker B: I still think Bitcoin needs it too.
01:04:36.070 - 01:05:17.202, Speaker A: Well, I've been there. Sorry. The best leadership that I see Vitalik doing and that I know actually works is when he writes articles titled Legitimacy on his blog post and that article becomes cited in Startups Reasons for Existing. I've seen the Vitalik Legitimacy post cited in decks more than most other articles that I've read. And that's just leading in this very passive, low touch way that still steers an entire ecosystem. Yeah, I don't know if I answered the question, but I think we gave the content that the question asked for.
01:05:17.256 - 01:05:47.242, Speaker B: Yes, vitalik was necessary. Yes, it massively influenced ethereum. No, it wouldn't have gotten here without a Vitalik or someone like him. And I do think he is actually a fairly unique type of leader in history. A lot of leaders kind of grab power and they tend to keep it, and he's gone in the other direction. Vitalik is much less necessary for Ethereum to succeed today than he was five years ago. In fact, I think at this point, if Vitalik left, ethereum would be totally, totally fine.
01:05:47.376 - 01:05:59.294, Speaker A: That would have been true a number of years ago. The last few times I've introduced Vitalik on the podcast, I've introduced him as Vitalik, the guy that holds the record for the most ignored EIPS, proposed EIPS. It's true.
01:05:59.492 - 01:06:06.462, Speaker B: Most of his EIPS are interesting. We should delve into the ignored ones. Maybe there's some good ideas.
01:06:06.526 - 01:06:09.826, Speaker A: That is some niche content. I don't know.
01:06:09.928 - 01:06:31.386, Speaker B: Not understand it. All right, let's get to some takes of the week. We got one big one from Kobe. So kobe on opportunity. How do you win during the bear market? David, what do you do? This is the season that we're in. We've called it kind of the apathy market. Kobe had some advice, and I think he said this sometime in maybe in.
01:06:31.408 - 01:06:32.758, Speaker A: The bull market at the peak.
01:06:32.854 - 01:06:38.218, Speaker B: So when everyone was drunk. And look at these podcast participants. Do you recognize some of these faces here?
01:06:38.304 - 01:06:43.280, Speaker A: Van spencer suzu. I don't know who the others are.
01:06:43.650 - 01:06:47.200, Speaker B: Okay. Some bull market content people anyway.
01:06:49.410 - 01:06:51.242, Speaker A: Pre 3 hours capital demise.
01:06:51.306 - 01:06:52.742, Speaker B: Let's play the clip.
01:06:52.826 - 01:07:34.426, Speaker C: You think the majority of people that don't make it are the people that lose interest between bull markets. Like people that have known about it from so far back who still haven't made it. It's because as soon as it gets frothy, it gets to the bull market. They rebuy the all time high breakout. So they rebought at like they play the bull market. They're a little bit naturally bearish, and the bear market hits and they stay interested for about a year, and then towards the tail end, like late 2018, 2019, they just naturally lose interest and they go, oh, this shit's over. I've got life commitments, whatever.
01:07:34.426 - 01:08:25.406, Speaker C: And then they get back involved when it starts getting frothy again. And those are the people that are not going to make it. So if there is one piece of advice that I can give is, like, find a way to remain the same level of interest that you have now. When you check the chart every day, you lose sleep over your positions, whatever the fuck you're doing, you over leveraged apes. You need to have the same level of interest when everything's really boring, because right now everyone's interested, right? My parents are super like, what shall I buy my friends from school way back when are hitting me up, saying, is cardano good and whatever, but none of those people are interested in the bottom. None of those people are interested when it's going sideways for six months. And if you tell those people at the bottom in the six months sideways, now's the time they fucking ignore you.
01:08:25.406 - 01:08:46.802, Speaker C: They're like, Nah, it seems a bit risky. It's not for me. I'll look at it later. And then they hit you up in January of this year, like, is it too late to get in, by the way? And you're like, no, just immediately market buy. It's like something, it's thirty k. And they're like, I'm going to wait for a dip. And at 60K, they're like, Is it too late to market buy? Like you said, you're like, Bro, I have no advice for you anymore.
01:08:46.802 - 01:09:12.010, Speaker C: I told you it's four k to buy. I told you, like, six k to buy. I told you it's seven k to buy. So the main way you have to make it is try and perpetuate your interest through the boring bit. The boring bit is where the opportunity is when all these moon boys and all the marketers and all the lappers, they disappear from Twitter and they don't participate anymore. Their accounts just stop tweeting. That's the bit where you're supposed to be interested and you're supposed to be taking your next three years of positions.
01:09:12.010 - 01:09:16.814, Speaker C: Most people that don't make it, they stick around for the fun bit. That's it. Stick around for the boring bit.
01:09:16.852 - 01:09:27.870, Speaker B: There it is. David so try to maintain your interest during the boring bit. This is the boring bit. Let me ask you, how do you maintain your interest and how have you done it in previous boar markets?
01:09:28.030 - 01:10:20.738, Speaker A: Yeah, in 2019, which was the last boar market that we had, is when I felt like I was taking crazy pills, man. Unitswap got invented, dye was growing like crazy, compound was being utilized, and no one was talking about it. And the advice that I have is like, there is going to be similarly exciting innovations that are granted, going to be more complex because we're one more cycle more mature. But there's going to be things that excite you, that you're looking around and no one else is getting excited. And you're like, Why the f not? Now, if you're good at this game, if you're a good investor, if you're good at playing the crypto world, you will understand, and if you have identified it correctly, you'll understand that that's alpha and you're not taking crazy pills. I felt like I was taking crazy pills for a whole entire year, if not longer. But this is where you have to understand, like, no, you're the smart one.
01:10:20.738 - 01:10:54.830, Speaker A: You are paying attention when other people are not. And looking for alpha is actually easier, so long as you understand that, yes, people aren't going to be excited about this. Thing for maybe a frustratingly long amount of time, but so long as you see the vision and you have identified opportunity that this is the year to do it. And we were talking about the bear market incoming. At the end of 2022 1st, we're punched in the face bear market, and now we're having the bull market. And here we are, we've arrived. And so now it's a matter of like, hey, this is where you actually make millions of dollars.
01:10:54.830 - 01:10:58.414, Speaker A: Next bull market. If you identify the opportunities in order.
01:10:58.452 - 01:11:27.286, Speaker B: To do this, though. Okay, so I think Kobe's advice is so salient around, do whatever it takes to stay interested, right? Okay, so realize that during the bull market, your brain was actually rewired for dopamine hits. Every time you checked price on your phone, your app and the price went up, boom, dopamine hit. Where's it going to go next, right? Oh, it's down a little bit, but boom, big increase again. And you're looking@your.net worth. And you're like, wow, this is amazing.
01:11:27.468 - 01:11:29.222, Speaker A: Every time I refresh, it goes up.
01:11:29.276 - 01:12:23.046, Speaker B: You got hooked on the dopamine, so you consumed all this crypto content. Now that dopamine is all gone, all right? So you have to get your hit. Like, your brain wants chemical hits from something, and you have to get it from something else, all right, where you can get it. At least for me, it's been doing stuff, building something, learning about something, trying a new D Five protocol, trying a new wallet, like learning about ZK machine learning or some sort of obscure topic, and then maybe making content about it. If you have dev skills, obviously you build something, right? If you don't have dev skills, if you have other kind of softer skills, then you're writing, you're researching, you're doing all sorts of things to keep yourself busy. And you have to get the chemical hit that way instead. So you have to really rewire your brain.
01:12:23.046 - 01:12:41.150, Speaker B: And I think if you stay here and if you can maintain your interest, then, as David, you just said, there's benefit on the other side of that. But you have to sort of trick your brain into it because you've been addicted to the dopamine price hits. It's no longer present anymore. You got to get it from somewhere else.
01:12:41.300 - 01:12:44.202, Speaker A: You know what's a great source of dopamine, Ryan?
01:12:44.266 - 01:12:44.586, Speaker B: What's?
01:12:44.618 - 01:12:53.630, Speaker A: That is when all of the things that you thought were true come true and turns into a million dollars because you stuck it out through the bear market. That's a nice source of dopamine.
01:12:53.710 - 01:12:57.140, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's not instant, is it? It takes some time.
01:12:58.470 - 01:13:04.358, Speaker A: It first takes the crazy pills section. You have to feel like you're taking crazy pills, and that's how you know you're onto something.
01:13:04.444 - 01:13:08.994, Speaker B: That's where we are. All right, what else? We got another take of the week. This is yours?
01:13:09.122 - 01:13:32.702, Speaker A: Yeah, this is me. So here's my take. That's actually not a take as a question. Do you all think that I can get Ryan to sign up for another weekly show? And so here's my idea for the show. 35 minutes long on Wednesdays, five minutes for the intro, and then we talk about what we're going to talk about. And then 15 minutes I teach you about something. And then another 15 minutes you teach me about something.
01:13:32.836 - 01:13:37.454, Speaker B: That's like anything. It's just not crypto. Just you come and you teach me something.
01:13:37.492 - 01:13:49.798, Speaker A: And I would imagine that the listeners would enjoy it if it were to be about crypto, because we did just talk about figuring out ways to, say, interested in crypto during the bull market. But there is no requirement that it is about crypto. Yes, correct.
01:13:49.884 - 01:13:58.470, Speaker B: Are you trying to get, like is this a side way to get the food podcast in here? Are you going to come with, like, nutrition lessons, world War II podcast?
01:13:58.550 - 01:14:00.700, Speaker A: I don't know. Could be anything.
01:14:02.030 - 01:14:10.586, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, look, the hardest thing for me is just finding time to do recording. David, as you know, we carve out.
01:14:10.608 - 01:14:15.342, Speaker A: The time, and anyone else who needs a meeting in that time can f off, really.
01:14:15.396 - 01:14:39.960, Speaker B: So we just carve out dedicated time every week, carve out dedicated time for another show, stop doing other meetings. I don't know. I mean, one question I would have for the Bankless Nation is, would they be interested in this for me? One thing that gives me the dopamine hits is when we get feedback from these shows, people are actually interested when we get viewers on our shows. And when I hear feedback that, hey.
01:14:40.330 - 01:14:42.662, Speaker A: Great episode, product market fit.
01:14:42.716 - 01:14:59.934, Speaker B: Product market fit. That's the kind of thing. So a signal for this would be if we heard from Beckless listeners that this kind of show format was interesting. Maybe they get too much content from us already. David I don't know, man. Don't we do like three to four podcasts a week? Every single freaking week? And we're talking about adding another one here.
01:15:00.092 - 01:15:17.934, Speaker A: I remember when, let's see, it was the Weekly Roll Up, which was the third show that we layered on. First we did the Monday podcast, and then I was like, Ryan, we need to do a weekly news show to cover this event that's happening. So we layered on State of the Nation. And then I was like, Ryan, we're only covering one weekly news thing. We need to recover the entire week news. Let's do the weekly roll up. But that was like, two years ago.
01:15:17.934 - 01:15:32.760, Speaker A: We've been doing these three podcasts for like, two years. I think it's time for another podcast. And I think if you pull up this tweet I just sent you in, zoom ETH wave. Put it nicely. David learns something. Ryan learned something, and I learned two things. Sounds like a good deal to me.
01:15:35.130 - 01:15:50.358, Speaker B: There you go. Well, I want to hear what the bankless nation thinks. Let me mull that over. David, I can't give you an answer on the commit. No, I can't commit on the know. I'm naturally breaks anyway. But I will say, to your credit, I did think that the podcast was a bad idea in the beginning.
01:15:50.358 - 01:15:57.230, Speaker B: I did also think that adding the weekly roll up was a bad idea. And weekly roll up has become, like.
01:15:57.300 - 01:15:58.990, Speaker A: The cornerstone of this podcast.
01:15:59.650 - 01:16:12.562, Speaker B: I enjoy it. This gives me energy. Sometimes it's hard to kind of get your head around all the topics, but I enjoy these little chats we have, so I don't want to discount this. Tell me what you're bullish on this week, though, my friend.
01:16:12.616 - 01:16:29.874, Speaker A: So I know we just came out of hey, how do you maintain interest during the boar market? My strategy is to invest time and energy into something completely different so that when you do have time for crypto, you make it very intentional and you go very deep rather than just getting, like, scrolling through crypto, Twitter.
01:16:29.922 - 01:16:31.994, Speaker B: You don't even talk about the meme coins if you don't want to.
01:16:32.032 - 01:16:40.634, Speaker A: That kind of you're free to ignore what you consider noise and just tap into intentional stuff. Anyways, so I'm bullish on climbing mountains.
01:16:40.762 - 01:16:41.440, Speaker B: What?
01:16:42.210 - 01:16:43.322, Speaker A: Completely unrelated.
01:16:43.386 - 01:16:46.762, Speaker B: Actual mountains? Actual outside the Metaverse mountains.
01:16:46.906 - 01:16:53.194, Speaker A: So in one month's time, you'll be doing two weekly roll ups with Anthony Cesano.
01:16:53.242 - 01:16:53.870, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
01:16:53.940 - 01:17:14.562, Speaker A: I will be in the middle of mountains in Washington, mount Rainier and Mount Baker. And then at the end of EthCC, I've signed up to climb the Matterhorn, which, by the way, is verifiably insane thing to do, to sign up to climb the Matterhorn while having done zero mountains before. Which is why I have to say also dangerous question mark on the risk spectrum.
01:17:14.626 - 01:17:20.890, Speaker B: Yes, I would say everything's on the risk spectrum. How far on the risk spectrum is this Everest?
01:17:22.190 - 01:17:34.750, Speaker A: So Everest is 26,000ft, the Matterhorn is 15,000ft. Just judging a mountain by feet, you can't do that. Very imprecise picture. Look at how fucking steep that thing is, dude.
01:17:35.650 - 01:17:37.374, Speaker B: I mean, are you sure you see.
01:17:37.412 - 01:17:39.374, Speaker A: The ridge that is on the right side?
01:17:39.492 - 01:17:41.578, Speaker B: I don't want to do this podcast solo, David.
01:17:41.674 - 01:17:54.690, Speaker A: Yeah, I know. Well, not only is it your co host, but it's also a very integral member of the bankless team as well. So it's two of us, so hey, if we both go down, you might as well just fold this. Oh, my God.
01:17:54.760 - 01:18:02.070, Speaker B: Wow. This is great. This is great news. I'm excited for you. So what kind of training goes into this?
01:18:02.220 - 01:18:20.090, Speaker A: I've been going to the gym twice a day for the past week or so, ever since I got back from just starting out Montenegro. Starting that training, I was running around in Montenegro. Now I have 50 pounds on my backpack on a stairstepper, which, let me tell you, is extremely boring. My God, though, makes crypto very interesting.
01:18:20.160 - 01:18:21.950, Speaker B: You can listen to some podcasts while you do it?
01:18:22.020 - 01:18:23.038, Speaker A: That's exactly what I did.
01:18:23.124 - 01:18:23.982, Speaker D: That's exactly right.
01:18:24.036 - 01:18:24.302, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:18:24.356 - 01:18:32.334, Speaker B: Wow. Well, this looks crazy. I would never attempt something like this. And I'm also proud of you.
01:18:32.532 - 01:18:34.750, Speaker A: Hold on. Don't be proud of me. I haven't done it yet.
01:18:34.820 - 01:18:37.760, Speaker B: Okay, but just even trying to attempt this is crazy.
01:18:38.210 - 01:18:43.762, Speaker A: Well, we'll see if I can actually get it halfway up the mountain. But that's what very, very excited about.
01:18:43.816 - 01:18:44.066, Speaker B: All right.
01:18:44.088 - 01:18:46.642, Speaker A: I don't know how to get exposure to mountains, but if I could, I would.
01:18:46.696 - 01:18:49.746, Speaker B: No Boar Market for David. He's going to climb the Matterhorn.
01:18:49.778 - 01:18:50.226, Speaker A: Matterhorn?
01:18:50.258 - 01:18:51.702, Speaker B: Yeah. That's incredible, man.
01:18:51.836 - 01:18:52.834, Speaker A: What are you bullish on Ran?
01:18:52.882 - 01:18:57.640, Speaker B: It's nothing nearly as exciting. Something about crypto is that okay.
01:18:58.090 - 01:18:59.034, Speaker A: Wait, what?
01:18:59.152 - 01:19:26.446, Speaker B: It's restaking. So we did this episode with Sriram, who is kind of the father of restaking. He's the founder of this protocol called Eigen Layer. We recorded that earlier this week. It comes out on Monday. Got me really excited about restaking. At least excited, probably 80% excited, 20% concerned, which is always the most interesting type of podcast.
01:19:26.446 - 01:20:13.934, Speaker B: And I feel like restaking will either hit product market fit and it'll be absolutely massive or it won't. Right. But if it does, it'll be a really big deal. So this, to me, restaking is potentially as big as layer twos were for scaling decentralization, and it's as big as mev was in terms of the challenges presented to the protocol and protocol research. It really changes the incentive game. And to me, it's as big as maybe the merge or something like it for the value of ETH, the asset. So you combine all of these things and man, restaking is like this massive rabbit hole that I feel like we'll be journeying on not just now, but in the years to come.
01:20:13.934 - 01:20:49.018, Speaker B: That, again, is if it hits, if it achieves Product market fit. And I think there's more than a fair chance it will. So this is something I think that you want to learn about ethereum and you want to know about crypto. This is probably the newest frontier to go explore. So I anticipate this first episode will be one of many that we actually do on restaking. In fact, we're talking about doing a panel with Sriram and some of the protocol researchers as well and talking about this further. So I'm bullish on it, but, like, scared bullish on staking is what I would say.
01:20:49.018 - 01:20:53.134, Speaker B: Maybe the same way you're bullish about climbing the Matterhorn. At least I hope you're a little.
01:20:53.172 - 01:20:56.190, Speaker A: Like, cautiously fearful you're doing something wrong.
01:20:56.260 - 01:20:59.760, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I feel the same, except from the comfort of my home.
01:21:01.970 - 01:21:11.410, Speaker A: The scariness can stay inside of the computer. The investable surface area around resaking is significant. I mean, it's as large as layer two.
01:21:11.480 - 01:21:14.850, Speaker B: Like you said, it's going to change the game. Going to change the game, I think, very much.
01:21:15.000 - 01:21:16.702, Speaker A: Thank you for making this section about crypto.
01:21:16.766 - 01:21:40.858, Speaker B: Yeah, you're welcome. Meme, of the week. We have no meme of the week, but we do have something special for you guys. And this is a moment of Zen song. So full disclosure ahead, a lot of language in the next song here that you're about to hear. I think it's worth it because it is exactly how I feel. We've got to stop sending our money to Randos on the Internet who are just going to scam us.
01:21:40.858 - 01:21:56.954, Speaker B: I feel justified in playing this song. This is a song by Song and Day Man that we're about to hear. So let's play that. I'm going to get to risks and disclaimers and then stick around for that. Of course. Got to let you know, none of this has been financial advice. Crypto is risky.
01:21:56.954 - 01:22:05.218, Speaker B: You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
01:22:05.304 - 01:22:31.420, Speaker D: Stop sending fucking money randomly new asshole. Stop sending fucking money randomly new asshole. Stop sending fucking money. Random fucking money.
