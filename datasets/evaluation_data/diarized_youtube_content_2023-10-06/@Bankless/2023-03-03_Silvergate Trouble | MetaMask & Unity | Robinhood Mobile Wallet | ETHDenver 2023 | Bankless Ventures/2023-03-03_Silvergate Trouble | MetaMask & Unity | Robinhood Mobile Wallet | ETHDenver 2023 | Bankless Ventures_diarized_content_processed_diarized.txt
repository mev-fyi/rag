00:00:00.250 - 00:00:06.510, Speaker A: Hosts of Bankless podcasts raising $35 million crypto venture fund. Hey, that's us, I think. What, what's this about?
00:00:06.660 - 00:00:11.870, Speaker B: Yeah. So, Ryan, you and I and our friend Ben Lake off are starting Bankless Ventures.
00:00:13.890 - 00:00:19.070, Speaker A: Bankless Nation. It is the first Friday of March. David, what time is it?
00:00:19.140 - 00:00:37.446, Speaker B: Oh, Ryan, it's the East Denver version of the Bankless Friday weekly roll up where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto. And so much of that news is happening at East Denver. So much of the announcements that we're going to talk about are being announced at East Denver. So if you don't have coffee, grab it because you're going to need it to get through this weekly roll up. I definitely am.
00:00:37.548 - 00:00:47.770, Speaker A: Okay, so you're in Denver right now. I am not. But the conference, per usual, as is tradition, the conference hasn't officially started though, yet, has it?
00:00:47.920 - 00:01:14.734, Speaker B: So it's different this year. The previous years at ETH Denver, it has been held in this venue called the Sports Castle. But we outgrew the Sports Castle by a wide margin last year, so we had to go to the Denver Convention Center. So the official canonical ETH Denver event does start today, but so much has already happened already. There are so many side events. There was this interoperability conference that was Monday and Tuesday. There was walletcon yesterday.
00:01:14.734 - 00:01:34.314, Speaker B: So to say that East Denver hasn't started yet is missing like the forest for the trees, because so much of other events have already happened and have been ongoing all week. So Ethnver week has definitely been a very big thing. Plus the hackathon has already been going on. So the canonical ETH Denver event starts today, but so much is already underway as well.
00:01:34.352 - 00:01:39.450, Speaker A: That's because when people talk about ETH Denver, it's really a shelling point for getting a whole bunch of crypto people together.
00:01:39.520 - 00:01:40.362, Speaker B: It is now. Yeah.
00:01:40.416 - 00:01:55.422, Speaker A: What's the vibe like on the ground? What's the vibe? How are people and by the way, by the way, we're recording this Thursday morning, but this goes out Friday. So the official ETH Denver event will have started by the time you guys are listening to this. But yeah, what are the vibes, how are people feeling?
00:01:55.566 - 00:02:07.666, Speaker B: So it's very much more diverse in subject matter. Last year, East Denver, I think there was like 13,000 to 14,000 people that came and the venue only held 7000, so that was an issue.
00:02:07.768 - 00:02:12.146, Speaker A: And last year was in February when the market was like just riding all time highs.
00:02:12.178 - 00:02:13.874, Speaker B: It was totally different. Very close to highs.
00:02:13.922 - 00:02:14.182, Speaker C: Yes.
00:02:14.236 - 00:02:24.458, Speaker B: Okay. We haven't gotten official headcounts yet because it's really hard to get an official headcount because there is no official headcounter. But people have been giving me estimates of 15 to 20,000 people.
00:02:24.544 - 00:02:25.734, Speaker A: Are you serious?
00:02:25.862 - 00:02:55.826, Speaker B: Dude, I was at what was the ZK day and it was all about zero knowledge. The room was absolutely packed. The ZK day, the one day event about all about zero knowledge was more than East Denver 2020 as a whole. If you told me back in 2019 that there would be a single one day conference, specifically about zero knowledge stuff happening in 2023, I'd be like, Well, I guess why I'm here in this industry, I expect that to grow. But it's crazy, man.
00:02:55.928 - 00:02:56.242, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:56.296 - 00:03:10.550, Speaker B: So it's so large that people are subdividing into different streams, different talks, different tracks. The energy is very, very large and it's hard to keep track of everything. It is literally impossible to go to everything. You have to pick and choose what you want to do.
00:03:10.700 - 00:03:47.720, Speaker A: Guys, as far as content goes, I know David is going to bring us back a ton of content. We've got a full Bankless media team on the ground at ETH Denver, and we're calling this like a virtual conference pass, which is basically what we're providing. I like to think, David, you're doing this partially in service to people like me who don't go to these events. And you go and you record, you get some of the highlights, you talk about the takeaways, and we publish all of this on the Bankless newsletter and of course, on our YouTube channel. And for premium subscribers, we package this all up into some RSS episodes that you can capture as well. So I bet you're coming home with a lot of content.
00:03:48.170 - 00:04:32.690, Speaker B: That's exactly right. I go to the content, Ryan, so you don't have to. At the Interoperability summit, I recorded, I think, eight interviews with Siri Ram from Eigen layer, with Sonny from Cosmos people from the Axilar layer one which has piqued my interest. Interestingly, so many different people, specifically outside of the EVM ethereum ecosystem, the rest of the non ethereum world, all about the Interoperability Summit also Ledger from up only he was there as well, so I got to meet him for the first time. And so that was eight interviews at that event. Luke and the rest of the Bankless media team and I are going to go to the actual canonical Ethn revent today and tomorrow and probably do that again. So, Ryan, I might have like 16 interviews for you.
00:04:32.760 - 00:04:34.574, Speaker A: Rest that voice. Rest that voice.
00:04:34.622 - 00:04:35.570, Speaker B: Do you hear it?
00:04:35.720 - 00:04:54.806, Speaker A: A little bit. And I'm worried about you. I've been told that what you have to do in these look at me, armchair quarterback. I didn't even go to these things. But what you have to do is you speak with a lower voice so it comes more from your throat and that tends to exactly. That's totally normal. It's totally normal.
00:04:54.806 - 00:05:13.738, Speaker A: David, in person, he sounds like an octave deeper, too. Anyway, we got a lot of things to cover, too, and we got a short amount of time to do it. So topics of the week, gary coming out swinging against crypto. Gary Gensler, of course, he thinks everything is a security, but not everyone in the rest of government agrees with him. Neither do we? What else we got, David?
00:05:13.914 - 00:05:44.746, Speaker B: Things not looking great at Silvergate, the main bank of crypto, looking pretty distressed, so we have to talk about that. And then the big news, which got announced yesterday. MetaMask, everyone's favorite wallet, has released an SDK to go with the Unity game engine, planting a very firm flag that gaming is going to be the next big wave of adoption, servicing 2.7 billion people. Robin Hood released a mobile wallet and I was actually able to try that out. So we got the details as well. But then there's already so many other announcements as well.
00:05:44.746 - 00:06:03.022, Speaker B: DevCon gets announced in 2024. Account abstraction is live on the ethereum layer one, but I thought you needed a hard fork for that. We'll talk about that. Yuga labs is doing ordinals. There's a lot to talk about. And Ryan, I have to go in literally under 90 minutes because I have a talk at Shelling Point. So we are going to race through this weekly roll up.
00:06:03.076 - 00:06:22.258, Speaker A: All right, let's burn through it. And before we do, we want to tell you about our friends and sponsors at Rhinofi. Respect the rhino is what I say. This is a really cool interface on top of DeFi, and there's all sorts of what David and I call money verbs that you can do here. You can trade, you can swap, you can invest pools. Tell us a little bit about Rhinofi, David.
00:06:22.354 - 00:06:52.266, Speaker B: Rhinofi is a multi chain aggregator, so all of your different L2 opportunities are being put into the same interface. So whether you want to trade, whether you want to stake or pool or invest or access some vaults or whatnot, you can do this all on App Rhino fi. This is built on Starkx technology. And so if you want to just have all of your cool DFI L2 stuff all in one place, check it out. There's a link in the show notes. Again, app rhino fi.
00:06:52.378 - 00:06:58.386, Speaker A: Guys, now is the time to go explore things while we're in the bear market. In the build market, of course. So go check.
00:06:58.488 - 00:07:04.046, Speaker B: This is just like banking interface 2.0. Go look at your dumb old Wells Fargo.
00:07:04.078 - 00:07:04.498, Speaker A: You want me?
00:07:04.504 - 00:07:07.378, Speaker B: And then go look at this and tell me which one looks more fun.
00:07:07.544 - 00:07:14.850, Speaker A: This looks way more fun. I hate my banking user interface. It hasn't changed in the past, like, 15 years. All right, let's get to markets.
00:07:15.010 - 00:07:33.846, Speaker B: Speaking of new cool interfaces, again, all crypto interfaces are way better than all previous financial interfaces. What we're looking at, of course, is the Kraken charts, where we're going to look at the bitcoin price starting the week at $23,300. Exactly flat on the week. 0% up, 0% down. Yeah, exactly flat.
00:07:33.878 - 00:07:37.674, Speaker A: Are you just doing that because you didn't want to look up the numbers? David? You're just flat.
00:07:37.722 - 00:07:39.242, Speaker B: No, it's literally flat, Ryan.
00:07:39.306 - 00:07:41.546, Speaker A: That's hilarious, man. Okay. How about ETH flat?
00:07:41.578 - 00:07:50.910, Speaker B: Too. Flat ish starting the week at 1600, ending the week at 1625, up 1.5% on the week. I call 1.5%. Pretty flat.
00:07:50.990 - 00:07:56.942, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a bull run for ants. Who cares about this? How about the ratio?
00:07:57.086 - 00:08:04.454, Speaker B: Ratio? Well, I think you can do the math on that one. Even I can. We are up 1.5% at 0697.
00:08:04.572 - 00:08:15.690, Speaker A: Well, thanks for making it clear. And thanks to Kraken for these fantastic charts that you can find at Pro, Kraken.com, because I'm a pro. I'm a trading pro. David, I don't know about you, but these charts make me feel like it.
00:08:15.760 - 00:08:17.962, Speaker B: When I think Ryan, Sean Adams, I think Trading Pro.
00:08:18.016 - 00:08:25.498, Speaker A: I know you do. That's a meme. That's real life, too. Okay. Global crypto market cap. Are we above a trillion?
00:08:25.594 - 00:08:32.880, Speaker B: Above a trillion. $1.11 trillion in total. Crypto market cap down 2% in the last week or so.
00:08:33.570 - 00:08:50.002, Speaker A: Let's talk about a few stats going on in the crypto markets. I kind of skipped the Fed this week, David, because nothing's really going on in macro. At least this is what I feel like the state of macro is. There's a lot of doom and gloom types of things, like a lot of doomers out there.
00:08:50.136 - 00:08:52.342, Speaker B: And Dome is in right now.
00:08:52.396 - 00:09:03.514, Speaker A: Yeah. There are a few people who are predicting a glorious recovery. Right. But I don't think anyone really knows. It could go one way or it could go the other. So it's really impossible to talk about this week, but I do know that.
00:09:03.552 - 00:09:06.458, Speaker B: The bulls and the bears are in perfect balance right now.
00:09:06.544 - 00:09:30.434, Speaker A: Yeah, that's why we're flat on the last couple of weeks. It's been flat. All I know is I zoom out whenever. I don't know the answers in the short run and look at the long run. And the government is going to continue to print money, crypto is going to continue to eat the banks, and this is a decade long bet. So who cares about the short run noise? Who cares about the week to week prices that we bring you every single week on the roll up? It's all noise. It doesn't matter.
00:09:30.434 - 00:09:49.574, Speaker A: But let's talk about crypto, David. Let's talk ethereum. It just had its highest month of earnings ever. We love talking about ethereum. We love talking about its earnings. But I thought that this chart was really cool just seeing it depicted all the way from back in October 2016. This is the monthly Ethereum earnings.
00:09:49.574 - 00:09:52.182, Speaker A: And you'll notice here, David, it's been negative.
00:09:52.326 - 00:09:52.730, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:52.800 - 00:10:01.146, Speaker A: Ethereum has been unprofitable from October 2016 all the way massively until when the merge turnaround happened.
00:10:01.248 - 00:10:21.874, Speaker B: The merge? Yeah. Proof of stake makes blockchains profitable. So really, when I see this chart, I just see proof of work versus proof of stake. And so if you want to have an expenditure positive blockchain, you need to have proof of stake. And that is what we are seeing. And so this is another way of saying the burn. So instead of being on the website of ultrasound money.
00:10:21.874 - 00:10:23.298, Speaker B: Instead, we are at this one.
00:10:23.384 - 00:10:24.418, Speaker A: We tricked you.
00:10:24.584 - 00:10:26.274, Speaker B: Well, it's a different way of looking at this thing.
00:10:26.312 - 00:10:26.466, Speaker A: Right?
00:10:26.488 - 00:10:37.894, Speaker B: And so burn is at all time high. Monthly Ethereum earnings is at all time highs as well. But this chart is just really putting it into perspective as to what that means in comparison to Ethereum's history.
00:10:38.012 - 00:11:06.110, Speaker A: Yeah, what's also in stark contrast is a lot of earnings reports are coming out for equities and securities and they're all kind of down. Like profits are down. This is funny because Ethereum profits are up when you look at issuance as kind of the cost and you look at transaction fees as the reward. Ethereum's profitable right now, even in a bear market. David, this was a really interesting take from Hildabi about NFT royalties that we've been talking about for a while. And this is somebody who dives into the data. There are a few discoveries here that I think bankless folks should know about.
00:11:06.110 - 00:11:07.646, Speaker A: What is Hildabi saying here?
00:11:07.748 - 00:11:24.422, Speaker B: So, Hildabi is walking us through the royalty stats on doing analytics boards. By the way, shout out to Hildabi and all of his using Dune analytics boards. A lot of the time when I go to Dune and I find a board and I find a good one, I go look at who made it's. Always Hildabi. Not always. Data always also comes to mind. So quick shout out there.
00:11:24.422 - 00:12:17.794, Speaker B: So, Hildabi is walking us through some data analytics about creator royalties. And the big theme lately has been the royalty wars and how royalty percentages are going to zero as a result of this fight between Blur and OpenSea. And so, while what's interesting here is while percentage of royalty is going to zero, so like the percentage of what is paid on a NFT transfer is going lower and lower and lower because margins are getting compressed, total aggregate royalty payments are actually at all time highs. Surprising, right? How do you square this? Well, it's because even though percentage on a per transaction basis is getting compressed, total volume is going up. So while royalties are getting compressed, total actual royalty payments are at all time highs. And that is a result of competition between these two major NFT trading platforms. So, an interesting alternative.
00:12:17.794 - 00:12:19.442, Speaker B: Look at the royalty wars.
00:12:19.586 - 00:12:27.350, Speaker A: Yeah, it's great news for creators. Royalty revenue is actually going up, which is cool to see. David, we got a lot more coming up. What's on tap?
00:12:27.510 - 00:12:47.090, Speaker B: Gary the Destroyer is absolutely unhinged. We had the bankless meetup yesterday and Mike Selig, our nice securities lawyer a couple of times, was there. He dropped some comments into my ear, so I will share them after we talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.
00:12:47.160 - 00:13:40.930, Speaker C: Kraken has been a leader in the crypto industry for the last twelve years.

MetaMask Learn is an interactive platform, with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand, giving you actual practical experience for navigating Web Three. The purpose of MetaMask Learn is to.
00:14:12.672 - 00:14:14.346, Speaker B: Teach people the basics of self custody.
00:14:14.378 - 00:14:43.014, Speaker C: And wallet security in a safe environment. And while MetaMask Learn always takes the time to define Web Three specific vocabulary, it is still a jargon free experience for the crypto. Curious, user friendly, not scary, MetaMask Learn is available in ten languages, with more to be added soon, and it's meant to cater to a global Web Three audience. So are you tired of having to explain crypto concepts to your friends? Go to learn MetaMask IO and add MetaMask Learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of Web Three.
00:14:43.132 - 00:14:49.206, Speaker A: Gary the Destroyer he's on the attack. It seems like he's on a mission to destroy crypto. I don't know what's up with Gary, but what's he doing?
00:14:49.228 - 00:15:15.886, Speaker B: This week, David declaring everything a security. In the New York magazine, he's made some statements which basically summarized as, everything is a security except Bitcoin. Every company in crypto out there is in violation. Crypto is pointless, but blockchain is kind of neat. And this is a summary from Alexander Grieve, who finished it up. Hard to argue you're acting in good faith if you're admittedly trying to stamp out an entire industry. I saw another tweet.
00:15:15.886 - 00:15:32.440, Speaker B: I can't remember who tweeted it, but it was basically like the meme of the Wright Brothers discovered planes and flight, and every other plane after the Wright Brothers is illegitimate, as in, like, Bitcoin is decentralized, but every single other chain after Bitcoin is not legitimate, which is.
00:15:33.210 - 00:15:37.254, Speaker A: Exactly what it is. But it's like, is Gary a bitcoin maxi or what?
00:15:37.292 - 00:15:54.310, Speaker B: He's acting like it he's acting like a bitcoin maxi regulator, and I'm not saying this to say that this is what Bitcoin Maxis believe. But if you were someone who only wanted to fence and protect Bitcoin and attack everything else, if that was your agenda, that would be Gary Gensler's agenda.
00:15:54.390 - 00:16:01.390, Speaker A: I don't understand. So I was bored yesterday while you guys were at the party, so I went on a tear of a did you see this Tweet thread?
00:16:01.970 - 00:16:06.174, Speaker B: We had the team dinner last night, and we were all like, Guys, let's ride up.
00:16:06.212 - 00:16:37.302, Speaker A: Who's doing this? So I was just in a parking lot somewhere. I was waiting for one of my kids to get done with something. I was just, like, going through all of the potential things that Gary might consider in the real world. Unregistered securities. Here's a Chili's gift card for $25 that you can buy in any local gas station. David, if the Paxos BUSD stablecoin is a security, I ask you, my friend, is a Chili's gift card also a security? That's a question I would post. Gary Gensler.
00:16:37.366 - 00:16:38.474, Speaker B: Say yes, it is.
00:16:38.512 - 00:16:42.154, Speaker A: Okay, we got a security. Here's another example. Pokemon cards. Are they security?
00:16:42.272 - 00:16:43.770, Speaker B: 100% a security.
00:16:43.920 - 00:16:44.906, Speaker A: Wow. Profit.
00:16:45.018 - 00:16:46.846, Speaker B: Profitable upside. Yeah.
00:16:47.028 - 00:16:48.318, Speaker A: Efforts of others.
00:16:48.484 - 00:16:49.422, Speaker B: Big time.
00:16:49.556 - 00:16:50.302, Speaker A: Howie test.
00:16:50.356 - 00:16:51.054, Speaker B: Big time. Yeah.
00:16:51.092 - 00:16:55.630, Speaker A: Pokemon cards. Must be a security. Here is a sword. I think this is a Diablo sword.
00:16:56.210 - 00:16:57.614, Speaker B: Diablo to me. Yeah.
00:16:57.732 - 00:17:02.370, Speaker A: King sword, noble sword. You know, an item drop in your favorite video game has got to be security, right?
00:17:02.440 - 00:17:03.538, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, God. Yeah.
00:17:03.624 - 00:17:06.418, Speaker A: Do you have Chuck E cheese? Did you go to Chuck E. Cheese when you're a kid?
00:17:06.504 - 00:17:07.906, Speaker B: These tokens, not exactly.
00:17:08.008 - 00:17:10.806, Speaker A: This looks like an ERC 20 token to me.
00:17:10.988 - 00:17:12.354, Speaker B: Chucky call them tokens.
00:17:12.402 - 00:17:16.322, Speaker A: Yeah, they stole it from Chucky. And those are also securities. Classic cars.
00:17:16.386 - 00:17:21.242, Speaker B: Classic cars that appreciate in value off. Well, is that the upfront of others? Well, somebody else built it.
00:17:21.376 - 00:17:26.886, Speaker A: Well, Taylor Swift. She's got kind of a songwriting artist. Signed autograph.
00:17:26.918 - 00:17:28.620, Speaker B: That's reputation of others.
00:17:28.990 - 00:17:31.930, Speaker A: How about hotel points? Unregistered security or no?
00:17:32.000 - 00:17:38.250, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I mean, the value of a hotel point has to be determined by how much that hotel wants to make those things valuable.
00:17:38.330 - 00:17:45.026, Speaker A: And they can inflate that at any time. They can inflate those, change the value of it. What's the supply schedule of a hotel point?
00:17:45.128 - 00:17:47.634, Speaker B: Well, it's not the place, let me tell you that.
00:17:47.832 - 00:18:00.946, Speaker A: How about a human organ? Got a little carried away here. Fortnite V bucks? Definitely. Right? A puppy. I don't know. Like, you can buy a puppy. There's a market for puppies.
00:18:01.138 - 00:18:07.874, Speaker B: You can breed cattle, and cattle can produce dividends, and that's an effort of that cattle milk.
00:18:07.922 - 00:18:11.382, Speaker A: The milk is the milk money that comes out of the cow. It's fungible.
00:18:11.446 - 00:18:12.790, Speaker B: It's a profitable enterprise.
00:18:12.870 - 00:18:20.602, Speaker A: I get it. Yeah. Colescash, look, man, this is my Canadian upbringings. Canadian tire dollars. The Canadian watchers will know what these are.
00:18:20.656 - 00:18:21.834, Speaker B: I do not know what these are.
00:18:21.872 - 00:18:32.222, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a Canadian thing. Anyway, all of these could be securities. That's what's so ludicrous about this whole thing. There's no rhyme or reason other than does Gary hate it? If yes, it's a security. That's the way it seems to me.
00:18:32.356 - 00:18:57.554, Speaker B: Yeah. And the point that we're making, rather than talking about specifically what Gary has said, is, like, this is the implication of, like, yes, everything other than Bitcoin and the Bitcoin blockchain is not decentralized and is totally a security. All crypto exchanges are complicit. Probably bankless is complicit because we talk about these things so tight. And really, that's the news of this week is that this is the stance that Gary is taking publicly.
00:18:57.682 - 00:19:03.818, Speaker A: It's a really hardline stance, and I don't understand it. This is a take from crypto lawyer Jake Trevinsky. What's he say here?
00:19:03.984 - 00:19:45.862, Speaker B: Jake says, Chair Gensler may have prejudged that every digital asset aside from Bitcoin is a security, but his opinion is not the law. The SEC lacks the authority to regulate any of them until and unless it proves its case in court for each asset, every single one, individually, at one time. Which is why we titled this section Gary the Destroyer. Right. Because he's coming in, he's doing the whole chilling effect thing, which is unconstitutional and trying to scare everyone and just being a megalomaniac dude. He's just doing the power grab thing. Like, it's becoming clear and clearer and clear that Gary does not care about his job or his role, but is simply trying to grab power.
00:19:45.996 - 00:19:48.706, Speaker A: Yep. Well, mad King Gary That's mad.
00:19:48.738 - 00:19:49.702, Speaker B: King Gary yeah.
00:19:49.756 - 00:19:52.090, Speaker A: This is Logan Bollinger. What's he say?
00:19:52.240 - 00:19:58.950, Speaker B: Logan says, friendly reminder that Gary Gensler's opinions on what is or isn't a security are not legally dispositive.
00:19:59.030 - 00:20:01.430, Speaker A: Oh, good. We don't have kings here. Right? This is america.
00:20:01.510 - 00:20:11.498, Speaker B: That's right. In this country, judges, not SEC chairs, ultimately determine what the law means and how it applies. Doesn't mean his thoughts are irrelevant. They are just not dispositive. That's a new word for me. Dispositive.
00:20:11.674 - 00:20:20.610, Speaker A: Yeah. They're just not dispositive. Cool. Okay. Gabe Shapiro. What's he say?
00:20:20.680 - 00:20:41.302, Speaker B: Gabe Shapiro, one of a very well respected lawyer in the crypto space, now says that now that Gary Gensler has made clear he regards every single token, including stablecoins other than Bitcoin, as securities under US. Law, can we start asking, what's the plan here? That's a really good question. I'm sure. Where do you come in and talk to us so I can handcuffs on you.
00:20:41.436 - 00:21:12.210, Speaker A: This has got to be part of Operation Chokepoint. And so, David, I guess the good news is this goes to the court system, but I'm not so sure this is good news. It depends on whether we have reasonable judges in the court system. This was a take I saw last week. So a federal court just ruled that these emojis this is the rocket emoji, the graph going up and the bag full of money. Yeah, the chart emoji and the bag full of money. Objectively mean one thing, a financial return on investment.
00:21:12.210 - 00:22:07.060, Speaker A: I believe this is from the NBA TOPSHOTS legislation. The judge says this in their ruling, pointing at an exhibit of NBA TOPSHOTS tweets. Each tweet promotes a recent sale or statistics of recent sale of moments on the marketplace. And although the literal word profit is not included in any of the tweets, though rocket ship emoji in quotes, stock chart emoji and money bags emoji objectively mean one thing a financial return on investment. If you are doing the rocket emoji or the moneybag emoji, David, you are giving financial advice on Twitter whether you know it or not. According to this judge, absolutely ludicrous takes, david and I don't even understand if these people don't understand how the internet works, like you can't just say an emoji is financial advice, can you?
00:22:07.930 - 00:22:29.946, Speaker B: I mean, they're not wrong. That's why they're putting the emoji in there though. The problem is that this is the official NBA TOPSHOT account. I think if there was a random user of NBA TOPSHOTS, that would be think. I do kind of think like, yeah, if you're putting the upwards chart and rocket ship and money bags emojis into your platform and you are that platform.
00:22:30.128 - 00:22:57.458, Speaker A: Yeah, we kind of bad form, but what do you do? What are you going to do? This is a stupid thing. If I do a Pokemon card rocket emoji and I'm the issuer of Pokemon, I guess that's an illegal tweet, right? What is that? I don't understand what's going on here is kind of the bottom line take and I don't know that the courts are going to interpret things in a reasonable way.
00:22:57.544 - 00:23:05.526, Speaker B: Maybe this yeah, it's hard because there are promoters laws, right.
00:23:05.708 - 00:23:16.810, Speaker A: If you don't want to buy a freaking movie of an NBA top shot, don't buy it. I think people have to have a bit of responsibility when it comes to.
00:23:16.880 - 00:23:31.470, Speaker B: I think that's really like there is confusion and gray area and so what do we do in this environment? We push power and control and responsibility back to the individual rather than by doing this to the issuer. Yeah, you're not Taylor Swift tickets rocket emoji. That's going to be a thing too. It is a thing.
00:23:31.620 - 00:24:08.934, Speaker A: Yeah, it is a thing. You're not going to filter kind of the internet from these sorts of things and I think doing so is a dead end. But there is a chilling effect that's going into effect. Robinhood received a crypto related subpoena request from the SEC and it's basically just saying the SEC is saying to Robinhood, hey, there might be securities on Robinhood. The subpoena concern, among other things, lists Robinhood's cryptocurrency listings and custody of cryptocurrencies and platform operations. So Robinhood clearly doesn't have clarity from the SEC. Coinbase is suspending binance USD stablecoin.
00:24:08.934 - 00:24:40.534, Speaker A: So that's been delisted on the back of the SEC and I believe financial regulator in New York doing this. Mastercard is holding up their crypto plans. They put that on hold. There's a report out that Visa was going to do that as well. But then Visa put out a statement, I think from Kai Shefffield who's been on the podcast saying the story is inaccurate as it pertains to Visa. Here's the reality. And he talks about how Visa is continuing to partner with crypto companies.
00:24:40.534 - 00:24:46.902, Speaker A: Anyway, there was this chilling effect on the industry and that's a result of Mad Gary's actions here.
00:24:47.036 - 00:25:13.354, Speaker B: Yep. Nope. That's all come out. And so this is Gary, once upon a time being like a crypto hardliner. And now this is why we're calling it Gary the Destroyer, gary the like. This is going so far that this is actually starting to get pushback from people outside of the crypto industry. And so this is news saying a new Congress body to come to hold a hearing on the regulatory attack on crypto.
00:25:13.354 - 00:25:19.554, Speaker B: So they're starting finally to get pushback from Congress. Yeah. So walk us through this news, Ryan, if you will.
00:25:19.592 - 00:25:56.990, Speaker A: Yeah. Congress David is holding a digital asset subcommittee within the House Financial Services. They're scheduled to hold their first ever meeting on March 9. And the hearing is titled this Coincidence or Coordinated the Administration's Attack on the Digital Asset Ecosystem. I think we would say. This is certainly coordinated activity, but it's really Congress's job to rein regulators in when they go after power vacuums and seem intent on killing an entire industry. It's good as well that a lot of the blame is being pushed back on those that are responsible for it, namely the SEC and Gary Gensler's leadership over there.
00:25:56.990 - 00:26:13.106, Speaker A: Senator Tim Scott called this the elephant in the room and Warren Davidson called Gary Gensler's selective enforcement on the crypto industry, I think referring to that as troubling. So that's specifically what this meeting in Congress is going to be about.
00:26:13.288 - 00:26:35.610, Speaker B: Yeah. And this is how this has to end. Gary has gone from being a hard ass to being absolutely unhinged. So this is going to be a fight and now we have to fight him. And Congress is picking up wind that Congress doesn't like Gary necessarily. Congress has no interest in supporting Gary. He is a rogue actor in a rogue agency.
00:26:36.270 - 00:26:54.814, Speaker A: I hope that's the case. Yeah. Brian Armstrong put a fantastic op ed out in CNBC and let me just read a quote from it. This is part of the pushback and fight back. Yet while other jurisdictions progress, he's talking about outside of the US. The US. Seems more focused on turf battles between regulators.
00:26:54.814 - 00:27:07.662, Speaker A: No other country in the world has spent as much time and energy trying to convince its citizens that crypto assets are securities. Let's remember this whole securities thing. It's not even a topic of conversation.
00:27:07.726 - 00:27:11.426, Speaker B: In laughing about europe is laughing at us.
00:27:11.448 - 00:27:43.838, Speaker A: Dude, we were just talking about legislation which is know decently folks we talk to give it like maybe a B minus. It's reasonable. It doesn't it is completely sensible on its interpretation of what a security is and what it's not. This is a rogue agency in the US. I'm not sure why Gary and others are making this such a big deal. It's absolutely stupid. And I think in general, the context for me is this US anti crypto posture is crazy.
00:27:43.838 - 00:27:51.470, Speaker A: It's a complete self owned I mean, you've seen it like the US has the talent, we have the entrepreneurs, we have the capital to lead in crypto.
00:27:51.550 - 00:27:53.202, Speaker B: We have the oh yeah.
00:27:53.256 - 00:28:09.882, Speaker A: And yet our regulators are saying to the builders, yeah, go build somewhere else. We don't want this here. I think America is for real. America is forgetting that has to compete, right? It has to outbuild the rest of the world if it's going to stay competitive. And those in government just don't understand it.
00:28:10.016 - 00:28:19.020, Speaker B: Yeah. This is like my worst favorite thing about humanity, about how one bad person can fuck it up for billions of people.
00:28:19.870 - 00:28:27.486, Speaker A: Yeah. And thank Gary. Certainly some of the class of 2022 scammers certainly gave him more fuel to.
00:28:27.508 - 00:28:37.794, Speaker B: Be able to, you know, who doesn't care about Gary or anything that he has to say? All of the scammers of 2021 and 2020. They don't care about this at all.
00:28:37.832 - 00:28:44.670, Speaker A: Yeah. I know. It's frustrating. It's frustrating. Some other news too, that is somewhat related. Silvergate bank. What's this? David?
00:28:44.750 - 00:29:20.810, Speaker B: Yeah, so Silvergate Bank, as of this morning, stock tumbles 45% after a growing concern about the solvency of Silvergate. And so Silvergate reported a $1 billion loss in the fourth quarter. And this has caused a sort of run on the bank. There's not been any actual symptoms of insolvency yet. There have been concerning murmurings from actually Silvergate itself, as well as other indications as well. Coinbase has no longer accepted or initiated payments to or from Silvergate and has rerouted customer deposits to a different bank.
00:29:20.890 - 00:29:21.946, Speaker A: They were using silvergate.
00:29:21.978 - 00:29:50.422, Speaker B: Coinbase was yes, they have other banks, but they have started to route payments to a different bank. They stated as an abundance of caution. And so it was stated that Silvergate sold additional debt securities to repay debts this year. And they have said that further losses would mean that the bank would be less than. Well, capitalized is what they said. One part of this is like, okay, banks take risk. That's what they do.
00:29:50.422 - 00:30:34.550, Speaker B: That's the part of their business model. Crypto is risky. There's not that many banks in the crypto industry. Therefore the few banks that do serve crypto bear the general risk of kind of the entire industry. We all know what happened with the insolvencies of 2022 and so that has impacted a large amount of Silvergate's clients, which makes them unable to pay back their loans to Silvergate, which means Silvergate has to eat some losses. And then in addition to that, Operation Chokepoint has really reduced the interest in investing in Silvergate or making silvergate a credit worthy bank. And so all of this has led up to this moment right now, where Silvergate stock tumbles 45%.
00:30:34.550 - 00:30:45.446, Speaker B: Coinbase doesn't want to use Silvergate out of an abundance of caution. And so this is one part like kind of a cell phone out of the crypto industry. Then Magnet blown up because of Operation Chokepoint.
00:30:45.478 - 00:31:04.458, Speaker A: Because of thanksgary, they can't get banked anywhere else, basically. And it's gary it's the entire administration that seems to be involved in Operation Chokepoint and the stock is certainly taking a tumble, as you mentioned, Silvergate stock as a result. The question is where are crypto exchanges going to actually bank in the US? There's operations.
00:31:04.554 - 00:31:08.654, Speaker B: This is not the banklessness that we want. This is the bad banklessness.
00:31:08.782 - 00:31:19.026, Speaker A: Yeah. This does not help liquidity inflows into crypto and it cuts off a way for people to become more bankless. That's the bad news this week. The good news though David, is good.
00:31:19.048 - 00:31:20.118, Speaker B: News from here on out.
00:31:20.204 - 00:31:29.798, Speaker A: Good news from here on out. All right, we got through the worst of it. MetaMask is now in the unity store. David, do you know much about Unity, the gaming platform?
00:31:29.964 - 00:32:05.794, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a very well adopted, very high profile game engine that many of your favorite games, if you are a gamer, is built off of. MetaMask has released an SDK for incorporating MetaMask into unity. What does that mean? Web three games, asset powered games. Sign in with Ethereum in your Unity game. Anything that you can think of that has to do with your private key on Ethereum into a Unity game engine. So their topic of what that means is massive. But simply think of a more seamless injection of private keys into Unity games and all of the positive second order effects that come with that.
00:32:05.832 - 00:32:13.590, Speaker A: Did you know, David, there's 2.7 billion users and developers that use Unity for a game or a set of games?
00:32:14.090 - 00:32:18.370, Speaker B: Did you mean 2.7 billion users who are playing with securities inside of their games? Ryan?
00:32:18.450 - 00:32:20.646, Speaker A: Oh, God, I hope not. Don't tell Gary.
00:32:20.758 - 00:32:33.594, Speaker B: Well, we'll just DDoS gary fuck it. 2.7 billion of us with all of the gamers. Gary's like everything's a security is like all of the gamers are playing with unregistered securities. Gary go get them a court case.
00:32:33.632 - 00:32:43.662, Speaker A: For every one by one. Can't wait. Take all the twelve year olds on one by one. Enjoy that. This is the Unity asset store. David. They have the whole section called Decentralization here.
00:32:43.662 - 00:32:46.446, Speaker A: That's where you see this. So if you scroll down asset asset.
00:32:46.478 - 00:32:50.786, Speaker B: Store, that doesn't mean crypto assets, that means like gaming assets. Right?
00:32:50.968 - 00:32:57.426, Speaker A: It's not a crypto worry, don't worry. Or is it? Sorry, no, there are assets in the.
00:32:57.448 - 00:33:00.742, Speaker B: Store, like gaming assets, like download this package or whatever.
00:33:00.796 - 00:33:01.014, Speaker A: Right?
00:33:01.052 - 00:33:01.494, Speaker B: Yes.
00:33:01.612 - 00:33:03.398, Speaker A: Because Unity is a but I don't.
00:33:03.404 - 00:33:05.830, Speaker B: Know, maybe gary's like, oh, I can regulate that.
00:33:05.980 - 00:33:26.060, Speaker A: Did you say asset? Did you say asset pops? Gary no, this is a different type of asset. All right. It's a software asset. Anyway, unity is a technology platform for gamers. I didn't realize how big it was. Holds about a 50% market share. The only other Next biggest gaming engine is the Unreal engine.
00:33:26.060 - 00:33:36.882, Speaker A: Oh, Pokemon Go, by the way, that is built with Unity. So can you imagine, like, oh, MetaMask wallet inside of Pokemon Go to collect your Pokemon? Can you imagine that?
00:33:36.936 - 00:33:37.890, Speaker B: I can imagine that.
00:33:37.960 - 00:33:39.906, Speaker A: I know. You're a Pokemon go player, aren't you?
00:33:39.928 - 00:33:41.620, Speaker B: I haven't played in a while, but yes.
00:33:42.070 - 00:33:57.670, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, anyway, watch out for those Pokemon securities. But it's pretty cool. I think this is going to be huge. This is going to help bring crypto mainstream, and I think crypto has some work to do with the gaming community. Can we just say that they don't like NFTs right now?
00:33:57.740 - 00:33:59.906, Speaker B: This is that they're digital collectibles.
00:33:59.938 - 00:34:04.090, Speaker A: They're not NFTs, though. It's totally different thing. All right, what do we have coming up next?
00:34:04.240 - 00:34:26.654, Speaker B: Coming up next oh, my gosh, so much. Robin Hood wallet is out. We got the Deets Scroll. ZKE EVM soon. TM oasis. You like that one, Ryan? Oasis clawbacks money from a hacker to give back to its rightful owner. But was it the right thing to do? And DevCon is heading to Southeast Asia in 2024, which they didn't announce a specific city.
00:34:26.654 - 00:34:33.138, Speaker B: So I don't have my flight yet, but, you know, I will soon. All of that and more. But first, a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.
00:34:33.224 - 00:35:05.494, Speaker C: The phantom wallet is coming to Ethereum. The number one wallet on Salana is bringing its millions of users and beloved UX to Ethereum and Polygon. If you haven't used Phantom before, you've been missing out. Phantom was one of the first wallets to pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for Ethereum and Polygon. But that's just staking. Phantom is also the best home for your NFTs. Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your NFT experience, pin your favorites, hide your Uglies, burn the spam, and also manage your NFT sale listings from inside the wallet.
00:35:05.494 - 00:35:33.634, Speaker C: Phantom is, of course, a multi chain wallet, but it makes chain management easy, displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or phishing websites. Phantom has already saved over 20,000 users from getting scammed or hacked. So get on the Phantom Waitlist and be one of the first to access the MultiChain beta. There's a link in the show notes. Or you can go to Phantom app Waitlist to get access in late February. Hey, bankless nation. If you're listening to this, it's because you're on the free Bankless RSS feed.
00:35:33.634 - 00:36:13.742, Speaker C: Did you know that there's an ad free version of Bankless that comes with the bankless premium subscription? No ads, just straight to the content.

00:36:45.994 - 00:36:59.230, Speaker A: Robin Hood has a noncustodial crypto wallet. Now, they said they were going to do it last summer. Now here it is. It's available on the iOS App Store. David, did you have a chance to download this and check it out? Can you give us the details?
00:36:59.310 - 00:37:27.850, Speaker B: Yeah, amazingly, in the middle of Ethereum, I did have a chance to actually download this. Okay, so here's the deal. It's an Ethereum only wallet at the moment, and polygon, you can deposit and send tokens on the Ethereum layer one. You cannot trade tokens on the Ethereum layer one. You can only send in and out. If you send into the polygon network on the Robinhood wallet, you can trade. And the trades that you make on the polygon side of Robinhood wallet are gasless.
00:37:27.850 - 00:37:31.062, Speaker B: That's the full extent of the wallet.
00:37:31.206 - 00:37:37.278, Speaker A: When you say trade, you're doing it on a decentralized polygon protocol call, is that right? With some liquidity pool or something?
00:37:37.364 - 00:38:21.914, Speaker B: This is a collaboration between Robinhood Polygon and Zero X. And so Zero X has this Relayer API that's used to swap, and so the Robinhood wallet calls the Zero X Relayer API, swaps the Tokens, and that's all gasless and automatic and basically synonymous with the UX that Robinhood users are used to in their normal wallet. No other blockchains are supported, no solana, no avalanche. I mean, I'm sure they probably have plans to incorporate them at some, but like right now it's a pretty constrained limited functionality. Now, limited functionality, I'm sure they are going to add more, but right now it's just like on the Ethereum layer one, it's inbound and outbound transfers, and then on the polygon L2, it's inbound and outbound transfers and swaps via Zero X.
00:38:22.032 - 00:38:26.638, Speaker A: How is that Haptic response, though? Remember their co telling us about that?
00:38:26.724 - 00:38:28.538, Speaker B: I did notice any Haptic response.
00:38:28.714 - 00:38:32.720, Speaker A: When you hit a trade, it vibrates in your hand, you feel good.
00:38:33.570 - 00:38:40.930, Speaker B: Well, I haven't been able to trade because I sent in 25 USDC to the ethereum layer one and I was like, okay, swap for ETH. And I couldn't.
00:38:41.350 - 00:38:41.762, Speaker A: Okay.
00:38:41.816 - 00:38:53.286, Speaker B: But I'm sure this is just the first debut. I'm sure they've got I love that they're doing the UX is great if you are well done to the Robin Hood app. It is almost the same kind of UX and UI layer. So it's great.
00:38:53.308 - 00:39:03.574, Speaker A: And why do we care so much about this is because it's bankless non custodial wallet. It's super cool to see Robinhood developing this and building this out using their.
00:39:03.692 - 00:39:17.566, Speaker B: Did in just expediency. I did save my private keys to the cloud which is a native feature in there. And I'm like, OOH, I hope they got that one right. You can also save your own private keys to yourself the normal way. You can also trust Robinhood to save.
00:39:17.588 - 00:39:23.520, Speaker A: It to the cloud. That's fine as long as people know what they're getting into. Right? For $25, how much do you care?
00:39:23.890 - 00:39:27.680, Speaker B: Well, I did $25. Other people?
00:39:28.210 - 00:39:33.074, Speaker A: Yeah, in the future, I know as long as they have the option, I'm content with it. It's a great first.
00:39:33.112 - 00:39:34.834, Speaker B: They do have the option. They do have the option.
00:39:34.952 - 00:39:38.382, Speaker A: What's going on with scroll? Another first of all, what is scroll?
00:39:38.526 - 00:40:21.902, Speaker B: Scroll is a ZKE EVM that is trying to be EVM equivalent, which is an ambitious endeavor, to use my words, at the start of every weekly roll up. But they are going all the way down into the bytecode making circuit things to make the EVM a ZKE EVM, but also Ethereum equivalent. Very ambitious, very bullish. If they can get it done, they are getting it done. The last I checked with them, they had like a 600 gigabyte Ram requirement in order to run their prover and then they dropped that down to 200, which is a huge order of magnitude of improvement, but still have a long way to go to make that accessible to more and more and more. Anyways, they have announced that their ZKE EVM is live on a Gorely testnet. 100% permissionless.
00:40:21.902 - 00:40:27.460, Speaker B: And so this is the last major step that they need in order to go to the scroll main net.
00:40:28.470 - 00:40:30.786, Speaker A: This is way faster than I thought it would be, David.
00:40:30.818 - 00:40:51.950, Speaker B: All the Zkevm stuff, it's happening very, very fast. So it's 100% open sourced. Scroll has even frozen some of its code base to pass to auditors for review. So like the Scroll Zkevm main net, you can see it on the horizon. It is not that far off. So congrats to the scroll team. Ryan and I are angel investors in scroll.
00:40:52.290 - 00:41:11.282, Speaker A: Yes, true. You find that on our disclosures page. Always this CoinDesk headline, Ethereum, says, ERC, four, three seven, deployed, tested and the beginning of the era of smart accounts. David, what is this, ERC what does it do? I could tell you're bullish about it.
00:41:11.336 - 00:41:26.578, Speaker B: So glad you asked. Yeah. ERC 4337, what's the difference between an EIP and an ERC? Well, an EIP is something that gets hard forked in. An ERC is a smart contract standard. That's not technically the difference, but it's good for these purposes.
00:41:26.674 - 00:41:33.270, Speaker A: Like an ERC 20 is just a standard that everyone agrees to. It's not something that needs to be forked into the code of ethereum.
00:41:33.350 - 00:41:59.390, Speaker B: That's exactly right, yes. So, ERC 4337 was deployed to the ethereum layer one. What does that mean? Somebody just wrote a smart contract. There is ERC four, three seven, which is the account abstract and standard that has been worked on by Joav Weiss, who is the man that we are looking at in this picture here and many, many others. It is account abstraction inside of a smart contract. So, typically, the way that people have thought about account abstraction is needing to enable it at the protocol layer.
00:41:59.470 - 00:42:05.186, Speaker A: Yeah. Honestly, going into this, that's how I thought it was going to happen. It needed to be forked in.
00:42:05.288 - 00:42:31.926, Speaker B: Yeah. So that is still the long term conclusion. But in the meantime, we have ERC 4337 as a smart contract to enable account abstraction as a smart contract. And so you can start to do smart contract wallet level stuff, account abstraction level stuff, on the ethereum at layer one, starting today, instead of at the protocol native level. It's just a smart contract that you can use. But this has now been deployed. This caught a lot of people by surprise, because I think, like you, Ryan, and me, I was like, oh, you can do this through a smart contract.
00:42:31.926 - 00:42:56.050, Speaker B: That's pretty cool. And so smart contract wallet capabilities is now on the ethereum layer one. And this really is just like a middle step between native support at the protocol level, but it can also hasten that because we can have more iteration, more development, more experimentation and more innovation on the actual protocol standard that will eventually get incorporated into the Ethereum layer one at some future date and time.
00:42:56.120 - 00:43:34.346, Speaker A: And the reason, by the way, guys, we're so excited about account abstraction, is it enables a new era of smart contract wallets, which is basically like if you think about the user experience of Fintech, a mobile app, like venmo, for example, or revolut in the UK and Europe. This enables that many of our wallets right now they do not have seamless user experience. Right? You're signing transactions, you have no idea what you're signing. Smart contract wallets will smooth all of that out, make it incredibly easy to use. This is a big UX upgrade in the future and this is the infrastructure for that UX upgrade.
00:43:34.458 - 00:43:56.402, Speaker B: The metaphor that I've used to explain this. Is that all of your wallets, your MetaMask, your ledger, anything with an it's called an externally owned account. Anything with a private key that is a bitcoin of a wallet, a bitcoin version of a wallet. It's not programmable and simple and not programmable. Grammar, account abstraction, smart contract. Wallets like kind of a hard word to understand. It's the ethereum of wallets.
00:43:56.402 - 00:44:04.134, Speaker B: It's a wallet with a chip in it. You can program your wallet to do anything. And that is how we get over a lot of UX and UI hurdles.
00:44:04.262 - 00:44:14.430, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like people have coffee mugs, but there's an ember mug which has a chip in it which you can heat at any time. That is the equivalent. It has a chip in it.
00:44:14.580 - 00:44:22.046, Speaker B: I don't know about that. I think my metaphor is a little bit better.
00:44:22.228 - 00:44:29.778, Speaker A: Not a sponsor of the podcast. I'm a fan. Board Apes, they are doing things on the bitcoin blockchain. What are they up to?
00:44:29.864 - 00:45:02.766, Speaker B: Yeah, Yuga Labs. So not board apes. Board apes parent yuga Labs. People know the Board Apes, but Yuga Labs is the software company behind board Apes said Monday it's planning to release an NFT collection minted on the Ordinals protocol. The twelve fold collection will feature 300 generative art NFTs created by Ugalabs and placed on a twelve x twelve grid, which serves as a visual allegory for the cartography of data on the bitcoin blockchain. It will include 3D elements as well as hand drawn features. Interesting kind of divergent from what Yuga Labs typically does.
00:45:02.766 - 00:45:34.386, Speaker B: This new collection does not come with any extended utility or has any affiliation with the current ethereum based collections out of I mean, this is what we're looking for out of Ordinals is adoption by players who are here for the long term. And this is what we talked about, ordinals usage being up for a month straight. Ordinals demand is down for two weeks straight. But there was a hype mania. It hit a peak, it could hit a trough and go back up, but we are down two weeks in a row on Ordinal usage.
00:45:34.498 - 00:45:55.166, Speaker A: Yeah, this is good for bitcoin. Whether bitcoin maximalists know it or not, they need blocks based demand in the future, and this helps with that. David, there was a bit of a controversy in DeFi circles last week as well. Oasis exploited its own wallet software to seize crypto stolen in the wormhole hack. That is the title of this article. Can you tell us what happened?
00:45:55.348 - 00:46:48.330, Speaker B: Yeah, so Oasis app, it's a DFI app. It seized assets, it clawed back assets related to the $140,000,000 exploit of the Wormhole Bridge, if you remember that one, last year, and then returned them to the authorized third party, Ryan, after being ordered by a court to do so. So a DFI app was ordered by a court to seize assets that were stolen to return them to the rightful owner. Who was that rightful owner by the way, that was Jump capital. So the money, our favorite people got sent back. Sorry to all the good people at Jump, but you guys have done some, not some great things, and I'm not afraid to admit that and neither should you. Anyways, so Oasis app clawed back assets that were stolen from the wormhole bridge that were Jump's assets, gave them back to Jump after being ordered by a court.
00:46:48.330 - 00:46:59.310, Speaker B: So the instance is like cool, we stole money back from a hacker and gave it back to the rifle owner. But what precedent does this set? What are your thoughts on this, Ryan?
00:46:59.470 - 00:47:27.882, Speaker A: Well, first of all, it's a surprise. Shouldn't Oasis not be able to do that? I think that's the first thing. If it's truly decentralized, then the makers of the protocol or the application shouldn't have the ability to go claw back funds, go reach into a multi SIG or into a smart contract and take those funds out. So can you talk about that side of the story? Because we always say is it's not don't be evil, it can't be evil. Like there is no ability to change an immutable code. But what happened in this case?
00:47:28.016 - 00:48:07.990, Speaker B: Yeah, so the contracts for Oasis were upgradable, which meant there was a hole for Oasis to upgrade their contracts to get that money back. This goes back to my philosophy of if you can be regulated, then you ought to be regulated. And if you can't be regulated, then you won't be regulated. And I think this is the case of an example of an app that could be regulated because clearly a court was able to order someone to do something to get the money back. And that puts Oasis in the category of can be regulated. Now, if they want to not be regulated, they shouldn't have upgradable smart contracts. I feel like that's a pretty safe claim to make.
00:48:07.990 - 00:48:34.190, Speaker B: However, I do understand the utility of having upgradable smart contracts because you can prevent from exploits, you can protect your software, you can protect your users. Plenty of reasons to have upgradable smart contracts. But this is the tug of war, the push and pull between decentralization and centralization. What does decentralization get us? Immutable money, which is great, also comes with the costs. And so this is just an example of where those two ends meet.
00:48:34.340 - 00:49:10.262, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a reminder that there are many D five protocols and even L2s and other things that you think are maximally decentralized and immutable that still have these upgrade hatches. And so we should be conscious of that. Now, for many of these protocols, they are temporary, but that temporary period of time could be months, it could also be years. So people should be conscious of that. It's also like people are pretty upset with the Oasis Labs developers saying that it sets a bad precedent. One thing I would say, though, is put yourself in the shoes of an Oasis developer. You know, you have this escape hatch.
00:49:10.262 - 00:49:35.074, Speaker A: And by the intent here's an important point. This wasn't, as I understand it, David, an intentional escape hatch. It was actually a bug, a flaw in the way that the code was written that the wastis Labs Devs happened to know about. Anyway, they received this court order, and it's just like, well, you have the ability to withdraw the funds, and if you don't do it, you're going to get in trouble with the authorities. Authorities metaphorically go to jail if you don't do this, right?
00:49:35.112 - 00:49:35.554, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:35.672 - 00:50:05.850, Speaker A: It would be so much simpler if you could just be like, we can't do it. There's no ability, there is no access point for us to withdraw this, and that is maximally decentralized. So you're not put in the place where you have to make that decision. But as far as morally, ethically, should they have resisted and gone off to prison? The money was stolen. Right. So I'm not very upset at the Oasis Devs for this. We just don't know what happened behind the scenes.
00:50:05.930 - 00:50:15.360, Speaker B: The calculus is simple. Hey, your app has stolen money in it. Give it back or go to jail. I'm like, well, personally, I'm like, okay.
00:50:15.970 - 00:50:17.826, Speaker A: I'll live the money fight another day.
00:50:17.928 - 00:50:23.810, Speaker B: Exactly. I'll give the money to the right person and I won't go to jail. That's a win win. And then maybe burn the private keys.
00:50:25.270 - 00:50:36.054, Speaker A: I you know, that's just where we are as an industry, and I think we should admit that's the case. David, coinbase had some scheduled downtime this week, but I don't know if that's the story you wanted to get to.
00:50:36.172 - 00:50:57.498, Speaker B: No, this is really just a lead into the next story. Coinbase has upcoming planned scheduled downtime. So this will be on Saturday for 8 hours. Upcoming? Yeah. I don't know how frequent this is. I think this is perhaps like a longer than normal, but this is totally like a normal thing for Coinbase to do. What's not a normal thing to do is have unscheduled downtime for a layer one blockchain.
00:50:57.498 - 00:51:36.378, Speaker B: Salana had 19 hours and 20 minutes of downtime. The Salana Foundation said is still investigating why the network went down. During the outage, the users could not process transactions, including NFT and DeFi trading. And so I was asking some of the analysts who pay attention to Solana DeFi on the bankless team by the way, the analysts on the bankless team pay attention to much more things beyond the ethereum centric nature of you and me, Ryan. And so I was asking, so did this impact any DeFi apps? Did anyone get liquidated when they shouldn't have? What happened? And they were like, well, there's not much TVL left in Solana DeFi. Really? Yeah.
00:51:36.544 - 00:51:43.654, Speaker A: I guess now it's more based. It's NFT. It's kind of cultural. I guess it's become more that and less DeFi.
00:51:43.782 - 00:52:02.258, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's like we said this, Ryan, the last time Salana went down. It was a good while ago. It was, I don't know, six, nine months ago, the last time Salana went down. But, like, man, you really not need to start building up Lindy. And you have to reset the Lindy clock. Now, your chain went down for 19 hours.
00:52:02.258 - 00:52:35.600, Speaker B: Imagine if the world of finance was built on this. The whole point of crypto is to have 24 7365 Immutable smart contracts and DFI services. If your layer one chain goes down, that gives certain people power and other people not have power because some people can process transactions when other people can't. And they will be able to have God mode over DeFi, over all DeFi on Solana in that one moment of time while that network is down. And you can't do that. And so we have to set the Lindy clock back on Solana once again.
00:52:38.210 - 00:52:41.834, Speaker A: I know it's going to sound like we're kind of over, like, Solana bashing.
00:52:41.882 - 00:52:44.594, Speaker B: But this is so important.
00:52:44.792 - 00:53:08.682, Speaker A: I totally believe that certain things disqualify you from the race of layer one, right? And you frequent downtime, long periods of downtime, or you have to do an offline coordination to kind of restore it's, one of those things. So I know Solana, the community is working hard on this and building, and we wish them the best for this, but this has to be fixed during this bear market.
00:53:08.736 - 00:53:20.730, Speaker B: Need to start building Lindy. Every time you reset it, you go back. So far, the Lindy is at zero. Even non ethereum chains have better Lindy than Solana.
00:53:21.390 - 00:53:54.230, Speaker A: Not to harp on Solana too much, but apparently the Solana stores in New York City and Miami are also closing as well. So sign of these bearish times, I suppose. David the FTX ex engineering chief, Nishad Singh, pled guilty to criminal charges, so I believe he joins Gary Wang and Caroline and some of the other FTX criminals. Still outstanding. Is Sam bankman fried? But with all of his executives pleading guilty, he can't be too far behind. Is there anything else you want to add to the story?
00:53:54.380 - 00:54:18.138, Speaker B: Yeah, Sam Bankman fried. At least not that he had many friends left, if any, but another definitely one off of the list of potential Sam Bankman fried friends. This guy, I'm assuming, is going to work with the authorities to settle his case in a favorable way possible, which is not going to help Sam Bankman freed. Meanwhile, Sam Bankman freed this, like, 29 year old youngish dude just living at home with mom and dad, just watching football.
00:54:18.234 - 00:54:27.710, Speaker A: Back football on a VPN after stealing $15 billion. Strange. David, this is the DevCon news. Tell us about it.
00:54:27.780 - 00:54:44.950, Speaker B: DevCon Seven has been announced coming to Southeast Asia in 2024. No specific time, no specific place other than Southeast Asia. Very large place, but keep your calendars open for 2024 to go to Southeast Asia if you're interested in DevCon.
00:54:45.290 - 00:54:51.110, Speaker A: Are they doing these every two years now? Or is there every 18 months? Because the last one was in 2022, right, in Bogota.
00:54:51.930 - 00:55:24.738, Speaker B: Yes, that was 2022 in Bogota in October. So I've talked to Joseph Sweischer about this. There's no hard and fast rule for what they're doing. Dev Connect is the smaller sister event to DevCon. And EF has committed to doing Dev Connect every single, not every single year on a reoccurring basis. And so I think the vibe here is that DevConnect and DevCon are like this binary star system that rotate around each other, to use a metaphor, with one star being bigger than the other, DevCon being the big star, DevConnect being the small star. This is just how my brain and.
00:55:24.744 - 00:55:26.798, Speaker A: One of them has a faster orbit, right? Which is Devon.
00:55:26.814 - 00:55:35.126, Speaker B: No, I think every nine months is like every nine months you get the DevConnect, which is the smaller one, and then nine months later you get the DevCon, which is the big one.
00:55:35.228 - 00:55:39.030, Speaker A: Hey, that's cool. Southeast Asia. Always interesting places that they host.
00:55:39.370 - 00:55:42.326, Speaker B: I haven't gone to Asia yet, Ryan. This is going to be my first trip to Asia.
00:55:42.438 - 00:55:56.750, Speaker A: There you go. Get ready. Book 2024. So you're available. David, this is some bankless news and this is under our raises section. I'll read the headline. Hosts of Bankless podcast raising $35 million Crypto Venture fund.
00:55:56.750 - 00:55:59.390, Speaker A: Hey, that's us, I think. What's this about?
00:55:59.540 - 00:56:35.526, Speaker B: Yeah. So, Ryan, you and I and our friend Ben Lake off are starting bankless ventures. We are still pretty early in this process, but we are starting up a venture capital firm. Why are we doing this? Well, as people who listen to the Bankless podcast know, ryan and I do a bunch of angel investing. We also do a bunch of advisory work and we enjoy supporting founders who are helping explore the frontier of crypto and the frontier of what it means to go bankless. And so all we're really doing is now we are putting all of that effort that we're already doing into a structure that we are now calling Bankless Ventures. And so I think this conversation really got started, Ryan.
00:56:35.526 - 00:57:02.846, Speaker B: We were like, hey, man, we're doing a lot of angel investing. We should hire an analyst. We should help make this a lot of work easier for us. It's a lot of work. So then when the conversation continues, like, well, that just starts to look like a VC firm. So, really important point of emphasis, we're already doing basically everything that it takes to do a VC firm, private market investing, angel investing, advisory work. And now we are putting that inside of a structure.
00:57:02.846 - 00:57:11.814, Speaker B: The only thing that's really new here is now we're doing that with outside capital for LPs. So that's really the thought process behind this.
00:57:11.932 - 00:57:48.354, Speaker A: Nothing changes with respect to our schedule still coming at you with all the content that we always have. And of course, our disclosures are always updated. So if you want to get a feel for the types of angel investments we have been doing and the types of things that we'll be doing in the fund itself. You can head on over to Bankless.com slash disclosures, click the link there and you'll see all of these things and the reason why they honestly need to be organized in some sort of a different structure. But David, I don't know if I'd trust a guy in this kind of a jacket know, it looks kind of like a crypto rebel here if I'd give this guy my money. Was this taken last night?
00:57:48.552 - 00:58:27.258, Speaker B: That was at the Bankless meetup? Yeah. And the first question that everyone probably asks is like, all right, how does Bankless Ventures affect the media side of things? And the very big and easy answer is that it just doesn't change anything at all. And intentionally so. When we first thought about doing Bankless Ventures, our first exploration was a long conversation with lawyers. It was like, what would we have to change on the media side of things to do Bankless Ventures? Because we don't want to change anything on the media side of things. We want to preserve media to the maximum degree. And so after that conversation with lawyers, because we have literally the industry's best disclosures, we also never do any page content ever on principle.
00:58:27.258 - 00:59:08.790, Speaker B: And we already have an editorial policy that makes all of our personal angel investments not impact our content decisions. We just learned that everything that we are already doing on the media side of things doesn't impact Ventures and Ventures doesn't impact media. And so when we have been chatting with potential LPs at the very beginning of these chats, we make a very firm statement at the very beginning of our call that Bankless Media in no way will support Bankless Ventures. If any portfolio company wants to come on the podcast and we've gotten plenty of questions or requests from our portfolio companies to come on the podcast before, they will always have to do it the old fashioned way, which is by building something worthy of covering and sufficiently interesting to the Bankless audience.
00:59:08.870 - 00:59:31.630, Speaker A: And with the investment funds that's flowing into crypto all over the place, of course crypto is always hiring. You can check out the latest jobs on the Bankless Jobs board. That's bankless palette.com jobs. Uniswap Labs needs a senior software engineer. Bankless is hiring some writers, analysts, social growth leads consensus wants a Director of Engineering. There's still that Adidas Role, a global head of Web three strategy and planning.
00:59:31.630 - 00:59:39.042, Speaker A: Whole bunch more go over to the Jobs Board and check that out. That's bankless palette.com jobs. David, what do we got coming up next?
00:59:39.176 - 00:59:51.498, Speaker B: Coming up next, we got the questions from the nation. We got some good ones as well as what Ryan and I are excited about as well as the takes of the week. So don't go anywhere. We're going to get to all of that and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.
00:59:51.584 - 01:00:31.350, Speaker C: Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web Three landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems. With a recent addition of Arbitrum. Nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home. Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees. With arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro, it's also now ten times faster than before.
01:00:31.350 - 01:01:03.614, Speaker C: Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum experience web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap and friction free. How many total airdrops have you gotten? This last bull market had a ton of them. Did you get them all? Maybe you missed one. So here's what you should do. Go to Earnify and plug in your Ethereum wallet, and Earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get. And it also does poaps and mintable NFTs any kind of money that your wallet can claim. Earnify will tell you about it.
01:01:03.614 - 01:01:27.302, Speaker C: And you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire. And if you sign up for Earnify, they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new AirDrop for it to make sure that you never lose an AirDrop ever again.

01:01:32.294 - 01:01:58.750, Speaker A: Got some questions of the week for you. The first from the Bankless Nation Discord, simon Bruce, 1974, here saying, using base as an example, if a chain is built on the Op stack, that's the optimism stack. Does it still require a bridge to move assets to another chain built on the optimism stack, or optimism? Or is it as simple as sending the asset as a normal transaction? That's the question. What say you, David?
01:01:58.910 - 01:02:40.238, Speaker B: The answer is yes and no. Right now the answer is yes. The idea about the Opsack is in the future that answer will be no. And the answer won't be ever perfectly no. But the answer trends towards no. Why is that such a confusing answer? The idea is that base and optimism are both on the Op stack because of that common denominator, the bridge between these two chains has less risk and less dependencies and more standardization. And so the bridge between Base and the Op stack is less Bridgy than it would be had it been to like, I don't know, Base to Arbitrum or Base to Polygon or something.
01:02:40.238 - 01:03:08.678, Speaker B: Because of the common denominator of the Op stack, a lot of complexity is removed. And as further innovations, more innovations come to the scene, a lot of that complexity becomes abstracted and mobfuscated away. And so, yes, there will always be a bridge. Right now, that bridge is pretty Bridgy, to use a very technical term. And then in the future, it will become less Bridgy. And that is also true for all Op stack chains. And so the Bridginess trends towards zero.
01:03:08.678 - 01:03:26.400, Speaker B: However, it will never hit zero. But the idea is that with additional technologies, you can obfuscate and abstract a lot of the Bridginess. I made an op stack video. If you go to YouTube and type in Bankless Op Stack, there's my face next to a thumbnail that's titled Op Stack. If you want to learn more, click that video.
01:03:26.770 - 01:03:37.106, Speaker A: It's all part of the same kind of, I guess, nation security apparatus, if you will. It'll be more like traveling from New York to New Jersey than, like, New York to cross the border to Canada or something like that, right? Yeah.
01:03:37.128 - 01:03:57.314, Speaker B: So imagine it's like, okay, we're in the United States in the 17 hundreds you can get from New York to Washington State pretty easily. Well, not pretty easily. You can do it without crossing a passport control, but you still got to walk. And then you fast forward 300 years, and then you can just fly really, really fast. The bridginess gets less Bridgy.
01:03:57.442 - 01:04:01.014, Speaker A: No high speed rail, though, yet, which makes me better every time I think about that.
01:04:01.052 - 01:04:01.746, Speaker B: Not yet. Yes.
01:04:01.788 - 01:04:28.338, Speaker A: Come on, american. Okay, here's a question from Captain Randall Wall. I think I said that right. Sorry, Captain, apologies if that has already been covered, but what are your thoughts on the Eigen Layer and the potential impact of ETH staking and price? Do you see this as helpful to alts in terms of securing validation? That first question of what is Eigen layer? First, maybe you have to define that and what's the potential impact on ETH staking and ETH price?
01:04:28.504 - 01:05:04.542, Speaker B: Yeah, so Eigen Layer has just absolutely swept the world of crypto by storm just because of what it is. And if you are curious about this answer to this question, it would behoove you, I think, to listen to the interview I did with Sriram at the Interoperability Summit that I went to a couple days ago where we talked about this subject in particular, what is Eigen layer? Eigen Layer is taking normal ethereum staking and adding on additional what I'm calling, like, mods, if you will. And so not only are you staking your ETH to ethereum for all of the normal reasons, but you can also use that ether stake that you've already staked to also secure something else. So rather than having when you say.
01:05:04.676 - 01:05:08.558, Speaker A: Secure, the idea is like a bond, right? It's like economic security.
01:05:08.724 - 01:05:09.054, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:05:09.092 - 01:05:17.714, Speaker A: So that's what you mean by modding. You're like, I'm going to secure this ethereum main chain thing, but then for some additional risk and reward, I'll also do this other thing, right?
01:05:17.752 - 01:06:27.590, Speaker B: So imagine like chainlink, you stake the link token to do the Oracle network with Eigen layer, you can stake your ETH to ethereum again for normal staking reasons and then also have that same stake, also secure an Oracle network or a data availability network or generally anything that needs economic security. And so the idea is that this produces additional yields for estakers because they can secure more things, but with additional slashing penalties if you lie or do something wrong for whatever additional thing that you're doing. So the question is what is the potential impact on estaking and price for all of the there was a tweet that we talked about forever ago. Eigen layer will enable Halal alt layer ones for sure, which which also deserves unpacking. So I'll do my best. The idea is that all of these alt layer ones like Celestia subnets on avalanche, like all of these reasons to produce different alt layer ones that would trigger the decentralization maxis. Now you can just use ethereum staking, normal ethereum staking, to do all of that same kind of services without having to have additional tokens or additional chains or all that kind of stuff.
01:06:27.590 - 01:07:07.042, Speaker B: And so it produces additional yields for your ETH and it really imbues a lot of the reasons to make additional alt layer ones and imbues that value into ether and ether staking. So in the pendulum, I talked about this with Sriram, there's like a pendulum between polychainism mesh network of many, many chains and bridges. That's one end of the spectrum. And then the other end of the spectrum is like single one dominant layer, one chain. There's always a spectrum of where we are in the pendulum. And Eigen layer really pushes this towards there really only needs to be one dominant chain and everything else is less necessary. There's going to be a tug of war between these two things.
01:07:07.042 - 01:07:15.110, Speaker B: But Eigen layer is definitely pushing towards like all you really need to do is stake ether and then sign up for additional yield opportunities if you want.
01:07:15.260 - 01:07:19.702, Speaker A: I think to the question the captain is asking about impact on price.
01:07:19.836 - 01:07:20.882, Speaker B: Oh, it's bullish.
01:07:21.026 - 01:08:32.074, Speaker A: This is incredibly, freaking, incredibly bullish. Do you remember the idea that we'd come out with a couple of years ago about ether, the Internet bond, which is the idea that ether is an Internet bond for the ethereum ecosystem. That's what happens when you're staking, you're actually bonding it, and it accrues monetary premium in the way that a bond might. This is now ethereum being able to export ether, the asset, as a bond to other foreign chains or foreign protocols. And that is incredibly powerful because these kinds of monetary premium games, like bonding type games, are all power law games, right? So why would you bond with some other chain's native asset when that is far less liquid and far more volatile than Ether, the Internet bond? So this is like if Eigen layer really picks up and that's still an if, right? We don't know for sure, but if it picks up, it is incredibly bullish for Ether the asset. As the meme that we predicted a couple of years ago. As the Internet bond, ether the asset really becomes a bond for securing things economically on the Internet.
01:08:32.074 - 01:08:46.098, Speaker A: And wow, that is a powerful place to be. So that is why this technology is not just bullish for more chains, more experiments, more scalability, more expansion, but it's also incredibly bullish for Ether the asset. And I don't even think we've come up with a model for that yet.
01:08:46.264 - 01:09:09.978, Speaker B: Yeah, the most bullish way to articulate this is that go to CoinGecko, filter out all tokens and only do layer one chains. And as you go down the market cap stack, think of all of those things, those special purposes things that those chains do, and Eigen layer allows Ethereum to eat all of them. That's like the most bullish articulation about what Eigen layer does. Yes, it's definitely possible.
01:09:10.144 - 01:09:11.350, Speaker A: Crazy, right?
01:09:11.520 - 01:09:11.854, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:09:11.892 - 01:09:24.986, Speaker A: All right, some takes this week. This one from Anne Olsen. That's an ETH. May 2016. Ethereum launches on coinbase. May 2023. Coinbase launches on ethereum.
01:09:24.986 - 01:09:28.606, Speaker A: My, how things change. This, to me is a perfect that.
01:09:28.628 - 01:09:30.190, Speaker B: Deserves so much more likes.
01:09:31.510 - 01:09:55.162, Speaker A: Look at me. I didn't even give it a like. There you go. This is the perfect articulation of the protocol sync thesis, I think, which is, yes, it does. Yes, the most credible neutral technologies sync to the bottom of the stack and become the basis and the foundation for everything else. Coinbase was started before Ethereum and yet now it's building on top of Ethereum. That's incredible to me.
01:09:55.162 - 01:09:59.866, Speaker A: And, yeah, perfect articulation of what we've been talking about.
01:10:00.048 - 01:10:15.886, Speaker B: When did we develop the protocol sync thesis? That was like 2019, I think. So. Four years ahead of it. I'm pretty sure this was one of the main articulations. You said eventually Coinbase will build its own chain and it will use its own chain to produce its products and services. That was a prediction that you had.
01:10:15.908 - 01:10:21.522, Speaker A: No idea at the time. We had no idea it would be on a L2. The concept of L2 didn't even matter.
01:10:21.576 - 01:10:36.210, Speaker B: That is an aside detail, is the idea is that protocols slip under banks and that was always the articulation. And so this is what it means to be a thesis driven media company. Man yeah. Sometimes we get things right, Ryan.
01:10:36.370 - 01:10:41.770, Speaker A: Sometimes we do. Here's something else I think we'll get right. David this is my tweet. Why don't you read it?
01:10:41.920 - 01:10:49.398, Speaker B: Ryan sean Adams says the secret to success in any bear market. One, learn. Two, build. Three, accumulate.
01:10:49.574 - 01:10:50.570, Speaker C: That's it.
01:10:50.720 - 01:10:51.974, Speaker B: Walk us through this, Ryan.
01:10:52.102 - 01:11:18.694, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's really your job in the bear market. You're listening? So this is a bear market for you, and you got to do those three things. Learn, build, and accumulate. Number one, learn. Find people that are smarter than you in this space. Tune into informational resources that are trusted, that are long term oriented, that have ideas and theses and back those things up with research rather than kind of the pump and dumps. Use as many DeFi protocols as you can.
01:11:18.694 - 01:11:43.822, Speaker A: Travel in a pack in a community rather than alone. You'll learn faster that way. Join chats, join discords, follow people on crypto that you respect and want to learn from. That is what learn means, and you have tons of time to do that during the bear market. Secondly, build. This is applying your talents, your skills, whether you're a podcaster, maybe start a podcast or come on a podcast. If you're a writer, write something.
01:11:43.822 - 01:12:19.938, Speaker A: If you're an artist, create art. If you're a musician, do music, experiment with NFTs. If you're an engineer, my God, there's so much you can do with that skill set. If you're a front end designer, if you're an organizer, you can organize things, you can govern things. There's so much that you can do by applying your talents in this crypto space. I know, David, that's very much what you did when you kind of entered in that 2017 2018 eras. Like, you're really good at communication and talking about narratives, and so you did these things and that progressed from kind of like part time type work to it became your full time gig.
01:12:19.938 - 01:12:52.462, Speaker A: There is a massive opportunity to build. So much needs building and so much is getting created right now, and you have the opportunity to be on the ground floor. And then, third, don't forget to accumulate. Don't forget to buy. This is important. Don't forget to buy the assets that are going to appreciate if your ideas around learning and kind of the building phase are successful, you have an opportunity to get a piece of I'll call this equity. Not in the Gary Gensler Security Equity line of thinking, but more like in the upside of this entire industry.
01:12:52.462 - 01:13:36.660, Speaker A: Sometimes, David, I see people that they've been in crypto, they've done incredible things, they know all sorts of things about it and they've built it, but they've made the mistake of not accumulating along the way, right? So they don't get to share with the rest of the community in that upside. Make sure you don't become one of those people. So whether that means dollar cost averaging, in again, don't risk more than you can afford to lose, but the percentage will vary depending on who you are, your stage of life, your risk tolerance, all of these things, or lump sum. I mean, now is the time it's still a bear market. Now is the time to accumulate. You don't want to accumulate during the top of the next Pico Bull Run. You want to accumulate now so that's it like anybody else who's selling you other things of, like, ten secrets to getting rich on crypto in, like, 90 days.
01:13:36.660 - 01:13:54.566, Speaker A: That's all garbage. Only three things you need to do. This is proven. This is tested. Everybody who's doing well in crypto that we know david has done these three things learn, build, and accumulate. And the last thing I'll say is, these things are all on you. It's stuff you have to go you're not going to get spoon fed this stuff.
01:13:54.566 - 01:14:10.042, Speaker A: You have to go pick up, take some responsibility on yourself and do it your own. There you go. This turned into RSA dad talk. But it's so important. It's so important, and you have time right now. You're listening, you're here. You can go do these things.
01:14:10.042 - 01:14:10.986, Speaker A: Don't wait.
01:14:11.168 - 01:14:29.346, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll just add this isn't necessarily easy to do these things, but it's also not necessarily hard either. And it is fun, and it's fun along the way. And so it's just a very simple roadmap. Don't overthink it, and make sure you have fun along the way.
01:14:29.448 - 01:14:36.166, Speaker A: There you go. That's what David always reminds me of, to have fun along the way. This looks fun. I'm sorry I missed it. What are we looking at? David? Yeah.
01:14:36.188 - 01:14:54.666, Speaker B: So we had the first ever Bankless Nation. Meetup the Bankless Nation manifested in real life, sometimes network states of what this is certainly becoming. Ryan. Had manifested in real life at a brewery. Man, it was awesome. Ryan it was also packed. Look how many people there are.
01:14:54.666 - 01:14:57.820, Speaker B: There was, like, over 150 people there. Yeah.
01:14:58.350 - 01:15:01.722, Speaker A: What's the vibe? How's the bankless community doing? How's everyone doing?
01:15:01.856 - 01:15:30.834, Speaker B: It was so many different people from so many different walks of life that all had different reasons for why they like Bankless and why they listen. And so there were people from Asia talking about people from Korea talking about, hey, I do a lot of translations of Bankless content into other podcasts and other newsletters. The bankless. Brazil guys were there. Bankless Brazil, every single time. Anthony Cesano was there. Yeah, we had a ton of previous guests.
01:15:30.834 - 01:15:46.458, Speaker B: We had the Alfalfa boys, my friends from San Diego. It was just a really cool time. I realized, like, halfway through, I was like, oh, yeah, there's a microphone in a stage. I'm not used to going on a microphone alone, but I got to say something, so I hopped on.
01:15:46.624 - 01:15:48.314, Speaker A: Say, thanks, everyone, for coming.
01:15:48.512 - 01:16:15.618, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks to everyone for coming. And then I kind of told the story of, like, yeah, Ryan and I just started the podcast and newsletter with the intention of making content, but then we hired a few people, and then we hired a few more. And then I said, like, hey, if you're from HQ, everyone raise your hand and then introduced HQ one by one by one and was able to make a big thanks to all the team that was able to support this because we would not be able to do organize a meetup without the actual team behind us.
01:16:15.704 - 01:16:16.174, Speaker A: Totally.
01:16:16.222 - 01:16:39.706, Speaker B: And so this particular East Denver is the event where the Bankless HQ team has showed up the most. I'm currently in an airbnb that we're calling the Bankless Dorm because we have six or seven other people here. So we got Luke and Dave helping me record content, which is why the in real life conference interviews are going to be the highest quality high production interviews that we even though they're there.
01:16:39.728 - 01:16:44.634, Speaker A: And they're still going to get you this roll up out too. Yes, right here.
01:16:44.672 - 01:16:45.822, Speaker B: I'm looking at him right now.
01:16:45.876 - 01:16:46.778, Speaker A: God bless.
01:16:46.954 - 01:17:05.138, Speaker B: Giving me a wave. And then there's Chrissy, who is handing out all the PO apps and talking to everyone in the Bankless Nation. So I think the choice, Ryan, to move beyond just a fun little lifestyle business and grow this into what is becoming a network state of sorts, I think was a good move and we.
01:17:05.144 - 01:17:25.980, Speaker A: Should keep doing it. I know. So I haven't met as many of you guys bankless nation in real life as I'd like to. But the times that I have, it's always felt like just like instant connection, like kindred spirit, like different place in the world, maybe different language, all sorts of differences. And yet we're all kind of like one group that is going west together.
01:17:26.430 - 01:17:38.382, Speaker B: With the most diverse group of people from all around the world, from all these different interests and meaning and purpose for being here. Everyone just gets along so well.
01:17:38.436 - 01:17:41.230, Speaker A: It's really amazing. I love it. Really cool.
01:17:41.380 - 01:17:43.598, Speaker B: All right, well, that's what I'm excited about.
01:17:43.684 - 01:17:46.900, Speaker A: Is that what you're excited about? That was what's excited about. Okay, cool.
01:17:47.830 - 01:17:48.926, Speaker B: What are you excited about, Ryan?
01:17:48.958 - 01:18:07.126, Speaker A: David? I'm excited about how this bear market is shaping up. I don't care what anyone says, this is my favorite bear market ever, maybe the best ever. And that's because the tourists are gone. The settlers are here. They know why they're here. We have product market fit. We're not going to run out of money this time.
01:18:07.126 - 01:18:30.910, Speaker A: I think we're like fairly well capitalized. This was not the case in 2018 and 2019. The riff raff and the scammers are quiet. They're either going to jail or they've fled to places where they can't get caught. And the builders are building. And I think that's what you're seeing at ETH Denver is just a whole bunch of builders getting together more than ever during this bear market. They're not dismayed by what's going on.
01:18:30.910 - 01:18:56.870, Speaker A: They're not put out by the regulators. They're just heads down building. And so that's why this is one of the most exciting times, honestly. I've been in crypto and I can say that I don't know that 2017 was exciting. It's kind of like Discovery. 2018 and 2019 were kind of a grind of figuring this out and finding product market fit. 2020 was exciting because it felt like some of thesis was coming true.
01:18:56.870 - 01:19:00.066, Speaker A: 2021, things were starting to go off the rails.
01:19:00.178 - 01:19:01.826, Speaker B: I hated 2021 was great.
01:19:01.868 - 01:19:02.874, Speaker A: Second, it was great.
01:19:02.992 - 01:19:03.798, Speaker B: Was a slog.
01:19:03.894 - 01:19:30.450, Speaker A: Totally. And then 2022, I was just like, it sucked. I was very disappointed with 2022 and all the shenanigans that went on. 2023, it just is feeling like it's shaping up to be my favorite year in Crypto yet because we got the settlers, we got the product market fit, we got a little bit of money, we got funded. And so now we can head west and build out this movement and be ready for the next wave of adoption. So that's what I'm excited about this week.
01:19:30.600 - 01:19:48.434, Speaker B: Yeah. The only thing bad about 2023 is Gary Gensler. But there are so many ways to turn that evilness that Gary Gensler brings to us into something like really good. We're banding together, we're learning to fight in Capitol Hill. And I think he's going to level us lemons out of lemonade.
01:19:48.482 - 01:19:54.922, Speaker A: He's going to level us up, man. It's one boss. It's not the final boss still, but it's a boss fight. And so okay, bring it.
01:19:54.976 - 01:19:57.466, Speaker B: Let's do like everything else in Crypto is coming.
01:19:57.648 - 01:20:13.086, Speaker A: Yep. David Meme of the week. I haven't seen this yet, but I did see the parent tweet. So this was you and Anthony Cisano. It says caption this as David in his jacket and Anthony, you guys together at Denver. So I think we're about to look at a yeah.
01:20:13.108 - 01:20:29.206, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is the third time I've met Anthony Cesano in real life. I first saw him at ZK Day and gave him a big hug but then had to run off. I was like, oh, that's one of my best friends I haven't seen in so long. But I got go talk to this person. But then I got to come back to him. But it's just like so fun how casual it is.
01:20:29.206 - 01:20:38.162, Speaker B: Like, oh, Anthony in real life now, but it's always so good to see him. So we took a photo and I put out this caption, this header on the photo, and we're about to look at the winner.
01:20:38.226 - 01:20:49.158, Speaker A: This is the winner. Okay, let me look at this. This is Gimli, of course, lord of the Rings. Thank you. You told me. I'd like this. Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf.
01:20:49.158 - 01:20:51.178, Speaker A: That is Gimli saying this.
01:20:51.344 - 01:20:57.902, Speaker B: And of course Gimli is of course Anthony. Because know the beard. The big, big beard. I get it.
01:20:58.036 - 01:21:01.898, Speaker A: Well, you guys are not opposing tribes. You guys are same tribes. So you're both dwarfs.
01:21:01.914 - 01:21:06.914, Speaker B: Yeah, but we're just super snarky with each. We're like we're like brothers who fight all the time. Yeah.
01:21:06.952 - 01:21:10.254, Speaker A: All right. Gimli and his brothers. He has a lot. Of Big dwarfs.
01:21:10.302 - 01:21:11.970, Speaker B: I'm Legolas and he's gimli.
01:21:12.390 - 01:21:13.314, Speaker A: That's awesome.
01:21:13.432 - 01:21:14.686, Speaker B: I'm an elf, apparently.
01:21:14.798 - 01:21:20.742, Speaker A: Of course you'd want to be Legolas. I understand that. Sorry for that, Anthony. David loves you, though.
01:21:20.796 - 01:21:24.150, Speaker B: Well, Anthony was a big fan of this response as well.
01:21:24.300 - 01:21:31.254, Speaker A: That's good. All right, guys, that's been it the ETH Denver edition. I guess next week we'll be talking a little bit about Denver too.
01:21:31.292 - 01:21:42.186, Speaker B: But David's getting the conference is actually started right now. I am literally about to run off to Shelling Point to give my talk and then ETH Denver conference for the rest of the day. So you boys got to leave.
01:21:42.288 - 01:21:54.906, Speaker A: Yeah. We'll get some content to you guys, though, pretty soon, so you'll feel like you're there. Risks and disclaimers. Got to let you know, none of this has been financial advice. It never is. It's not legal advice either. Who knows what a security is? I don't even think Gary Gensler knows.
01:21:54.938 - 01:21:55.406, Speaker B: I have no idea.
01:21:55.428 - 01:22:04.786, Speaker A: Crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the Bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
