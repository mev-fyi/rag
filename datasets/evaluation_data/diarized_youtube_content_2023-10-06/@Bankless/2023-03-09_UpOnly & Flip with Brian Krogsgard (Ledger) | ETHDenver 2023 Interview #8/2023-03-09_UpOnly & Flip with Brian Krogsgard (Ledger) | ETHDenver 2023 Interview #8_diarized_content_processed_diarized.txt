00:00:12.730 - 00:00:40.262, Speaker A: Bank of the Nation. We got the last interview of the day here at the Axelar Interoperability Summit, and this one was a surprise. A very pleasant surprise. It's not really going to be about Interoperability. We're talking to Ledger. Ledger Cast, also known as Brian Krosgaard from UPONLY, from Daily Open, a fellow content producer, and a long friend I've had in the space. We talk about his company Flip, which is all about NFTs, both being an NFT trader but also an NFT community member at the same time.
00:00:40.262 - 00:00:50.254, Speaker A: And after we're done talking about Flip, we'll of course talk about UPONLY and all the other content that Ledger puts out. But first, before we get to that conversation with Ledger, a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make show.
00:00:50.292 - 00:01:30.822, Speaker B: Possible kraken is our strategic sponsor for 2023. Why? Because Kraken has been around for over twelve years and has proven itself to be deeply aligned with the crypto industry. Trusted, centralized crypto platforms are hard to come by these days, which makes the few remaining ones even more valuable. With over 9 million users and not a cent lost, choosing Kraken as our strategic sponsor for 2023 was a no brainer. We need exchanges like Kraken to provide the onramps to get people to go bankless, and Kraken's emphasis on security and transparency makes us feel good about having them as a sponsor. If you're unsure about your centralized exchange or Onramp, perhaps open an account with Kraken today. And if you're unsure about the rest of Web Three, well then maybe you should get your Learn on with MetaMask Learn.
00:01:30.822 - 00:02:16.454, Speaker B: Learning about crypto is hard. There's no one out there to hold your hand to get into this industry. Until now. MetaMask Learn is the best place I've ever seen to send someone to learn everything there is to know about Web Three. If you're a company trying to onboard employees, or you're a son or daughter trying to onboard your boomer parents, MetaMask Learn is the place to send them interactive and engaging lessons, making learning about Web Three fun and easy. Now, once you're through the Kraken's gates and you've taken the MetaMask course on what's a Dex, you're safe to make your first stop into the world of DFI. Where better to start other than Uniswap? Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange for crypto asset trades and swaps, but it's now also an NFT aggregator as well, making Uniswap some of the best decentralizing trading tech that's out there.
00:02:16.454 - 00:02:54.478, Speaker B: Uniswap's big announcement at East Denver is their Uniswap wallet, which is waiting to get released to the public as soon as Apple stops being a big ol bully about crypto apps in the App Store. Uniswap is basically on every chain that's relevant in the crypto ecosystem. So if you want to use Uniswap, but with the cheapest possible fees, then use Uniswap on Arbitrum. The Arbitrum, L2, is the host of Ethereum's most vibrant DFI and NFT communities. Arbitrum is already surpassing the ETH layer One in transaction volume, and it's not even close to full capacity. With so many vibrant communities on Arbitrum, Arbitrum is a good place to call home for the era of L2s. Speaking of settling into new homes, the Phantom Wallet is now available on both Ethereum and Polygon.
00:02:54.478 - 00:03:12.874, Speaker B: That's right, the number one wallet on Salana is expanding into the Ethereum ecosystem. Phantom is the one wallet for everything. Displaying NFTs, making NFT trades, swapping tokens, staking tokens. So if you're a multi chain surfer or an NFT power user, then the Phantom Wallet is for you. It also comes in mobile. Check it out at Phantom. App.
00:03:12.874 - 00:03:14.342, Speaker B: Now, let's get into the interview.
00:03:14.406 - 00:03:21.766, Speaker A: Baggage nation. We're talking with somebody different today here at the Axelr Interoperability series. We're talking with Brian Crosgaard. You might know him as Ledger. What's up, Ledger?
00:03:21.958 - 00:03:22.974, Speaker C: Not much. How you doing?
00:03:23.012 - 00:03:24.240, Speaker A: Did I just DOX you?
00:03:24.690 - 00:03:25.054, Speaker C: What?
00:03:25.092 - 00:03:26.046, Speaker D: Did you DOX me?
00:03:26.148 - 00:03:26.414, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:26.452 - 00:03:26.750, Speaker D: No.
00:03:26.820 - 00:03:30.990, Speaker C: All right, I'm doxed hello, my name is Brian. I live in Alabama.
00:03:31.890 - 00:03:32.542, Speaker A: Keep going.
00:03:32.596 - 00:03:34.734, Speaker C: Born in the 80s, so I've been.
00:03:34.772 - 00:03:45.394, Speaker A: Putting on my podcaster, Voice, because I'm doing all the whole interviews. But you're also a podcaster, so I know you don't need it. When people approach you at these things, do they know you from Brian from Flipside or Brian from up?
00:03:45.432 - 00:03:48.134, Speaker C: Only they don't know me as Brian at all.
00:03:48.252 - 00:03:49.400, Speaker A: That's a good point.
00:03:50.570 - 00:03:54.678, Speaker C: Are you that letter guy? The one in the corner of the screen?
00:03:54.764 - 00:03:57.026, Speaker A: Yeah. The small little video camera?
00:03:57.138 - 00:03:57.462, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:03:57.516 - 00:04:03.994, Speaker A: So you like me? Well, I actually no longer operate my own OBS. I got Luke behind the camera operating my OBS. And also Dave here.
00:04:04.032 - 00:04:04.474, Speaker C: Nice.
00:04:04.592 - 00:04:06.794, Speaker A: You still do your OBS? Yeah.
00:04:06.832 - 00:04:08.698, Speaker C: When we record a show, why do.
00:04:08.704 - 00:04:11.530, Speaker A: You put your own camera, small and down in the corner?
00:04:11.950 - 00:04:42.594, Speaker C: It just kind of was organic from the very first show that we did because I was actually trying to help Kobe stream an interview with Bitlord, which was random. And then all these people from a cast of 2021 characters came on that and we had like 7000, 8000 people join that show live. And that was episode zero. And in it I was like, I'm just kind of here. So I made myself picture in picture, and then it just fit after that. Plus, I kind of like it. I like being we learned one thing in crypto, don't be the main character.
00:04:42.642 - 00:04:43.334, Speaker A: Right.
00:04:43.532 - 00:04:46.470, Speaker C: I am never the main character, so that works fine for me.
00:04:46.620 - 00:04:51.030, Speaker A: You contribute a lot to the conversation. But no. Look at Kobe. Kobe can be the main character.
00:04:51.100 - 00:04:52.502, Speaker C: That guy can be the main character.
00:04:52.566 - 00:04:54.906, Speaker A: So what is the status with Up Only?
00:04:55.088 - 00:05:00.170, Speaker C: Up Only is a podcast that records sometimes whenever the hell you guys want. Yeah, pretty much.
00:05:00.240 - 00:05:00.762, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:00.896 - 00:05:06.030, Speaker C: We have no obligations because I don't know if you know, but our sponsor collapsed and turned out to be a fraud.
00:05:07.010 - 00:05:10.270, Speaker A: Yeah, the sponsor world has been different ever since then, let me tell you.
00:05:10.340 - 00:05:10.622, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:05:10.676 - 00:05:15.982, Speaker C: And honestly, we've been kind of slow playing. It just we'll be there when it matters.
00:05:16.046 - 00:05:16.514, Speaker D: Sure.
00:05:16.632 - 00:05:21.646, Speaker C: Is that like a news tagline? Welcomed up only TV. We'll be there when it matters.
00:05:21.758 - 00:05:28.338, Speaker A: When you want us, we'll be there for you, man. Okay, but you are here to be flipped by crypto.
00:05:28.514 - 00:05:32.690, Speaker C: No, not Flipside. Flip. Flip XYZ.
00:05:32.770 - 00:05:33.810, Speaker D: Flip XYZ.
00:05:33.890 - 00:05:42.202, Speaker C: In the vast world of crypto company names, there is a Flip XYZ, a Flipside crypto. And I think there used to be another one that changed names that had Flip in the name.
00:05:42.256 - 00:05:42.474, Speaker D: Okay.
00:05:42.512 - 00:05:45.718, Speaker A: I think Flipside might be my other budy will's project Flip.
00:05:45.814 - 00:05:52.822, Speaker C: Flipside is like a very query driven developer data thingy.
00:05:52.886 - 00:05:54.090, Speaker A: Okay, well, they're irrelevant.
00:05:54.170 - 00:05:54.906, Speaker D: Tell me about Flip.
00:05:54.938 - 00:06:20.086, Speaker C: That's right. No, they seem like they're a cool project. They just should change their name. You should change your name. So we're flip and it's flip XYZ and we're an NFT aggregation platform. But we're kind of like if you take some of the best things from exchanges and aggregators and research platforms and slap it all together and it's an all encompassing experience in one place and it's on desktop and mobile, and it's damn good. And not enough of you know about it.
00:06:20.108 - 00:06:23.046, Speaker A: So you should go use so who is Flip for?
00:06:23.148 - 00:06:34.470, Speaker C: Flip is for the person that definitely has a wallet, maybe has an NFT, but they don't necessarily treat NFTs as altcoins with pictures.
00:06:34.550 - 00:06:37.382, Speaker A: Okay. They care about their NFTs.
00:06:37.446 - 00:06:53.498, Speaker C: Yeah, they care about the NFTs they own. Like I'm pudgy. Penguin nine, six, five and I'm invested in this community. And I'm going shopping for my NFT. I'm not just trading derivatives of NFTs at the margins of floor prices.
00:06:53.594 - 00:06:57.726, Speaker A: Okay, so not the NFT power traders that Blur is going after?
00:06:57.828 - 00:07:13.720, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they're going after a different market and I think they've done a great job at that and getting liquidity in it. We're going after people that kind of like if you think of it in an ERC 20 landscape, like a swing trader, not somebody on five minute candles. Sure.
00:07:14.090 - 00:07:15.234, Speaker A: A momentum trade.
00:07:15.282 - 00:07:15.446, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:07:15.468 - 00:07:49.486, Speaker C: But I always say this in my own investing. It's like, okay, well, I'm going to invest based on fundamentals and trade based on technicals. And with my JPEGs, I'm going to pay attention to the price. If I buy something, I could think it's the coolest thing ever, but if I buy it for 0.1 e and it goes to ten e, I'm going to be tempted to sell it. So the price does matter. And a lot of platforms ignore price and metrics and community driven stuff, and we have all of those interesting metrics, but the creator, the community, the art is still first and foremost.
00:07:49.598 - 00:07:54.500, Speaker A: Okay, so what can Flip really do that other NFT platforms don't really offer?
00:07:54.870 - 00:08:16.202, Speaker C: The big thing that literally nobody offers, and we've had since day one is a native mobile app, and what it's best at is being a notification hub so I can follow your ENS. And if you flip an NFT anywhere so you trade something and sweep something, I can get a notification, and it's like, hey, David is aping checks right now.
00:08:16.256 - 00:08:16.522, Speaker D: Sure.
00:08:16.576 - 00:08:26.446, Speaker C: And checks are 0.2 E. And I'm like, Well, David told me about Maddox when it was $0.11, so I better freaking get over there and sweep, like, 50 checks or something.
00:08:26.548 - 00:08:27.006, Speaker D: Okay?
00:08:27.108 - 00:08:28.990, Speaker C: You get notifications of anything like that.
00:08:29.060 - 00:08:37.890, Speaker A: For all of my friends that I've told, hey, you should totally buy MFRS. They could set notifications that if I ever sell my MFR, they could be like, Yo, David, what the fuck?
00:08:38.390 - 00:08:46.430, Speaker C: And they will. Yeah, I gave away so Charles Reed is a big crypto dick butt guy, and now I've said, Crypto?
00:08:46.510 - 00:08:48.034, Speaker A: I'm also a big crypto dickbuck guy.
00:08:48.072 - 00:08:48.274, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:08:48.312 - 00:09:09.786, Speaker C: Now, I've said that. So he gave me one, and I told him, Charles, I won't sell it. And I did ask him, though. I was like, hey, can I give it away to somebody as part of a thing? And he was like, yeah, that's fine. So I transferred it to someone, and Meltom, literally, like the same day, was like, what have you done? Because she thought I sold it. I was like, melting. I did not sell it.
00:09:09.786 - 00:09:12.026, Speaker C: Do not kill me. I'm so sorry.
00:09:12.128 - 00:09:12.874, Speaker A: She would too.
00:09:12.912 - 00:09:13.434, Speaker C: Yeah, I know.
00:09:13.472 - 00:09:19.150, Speaker A: I've hung out with Melton a couple of times in New York within five minutes. Every time I'm meeting here, we're talking about crypto dick bus.
00:09:19.220 - 00:09:56.122, Speaker C: Yeah, and now we are, too. And that's just how it is. But if you're like, you get those notifications, it's directly in your feed. So, like, all the wallets I follow, all the collections I follow, it's going to tell you out of standard deviation, price movement. It's going to tell you, hey, this person listed that if I'm following, like, I have this Azuki that's, like, my favorite azuki. It's got these background firefly things, and the guy finally listed it, and I knew because I was following it on Flip, and it's like, hey, it popped up on Openc, sent me a notification, and I'm like, okay. I like it, but I don't like it for 69 E.
00:09:56.122 - 00:10:05.742, Speaker C: Sure. But you get all that information. And by the way, if you ever just want to share it, it's the best single NFT landing page in the world. Go try it.
00:10:05.796 - 00:10:07.374, Speaker A: For the NFT newbies out there that.
00:10:07.412 - 00:10:28.798, Speaker C: Need a good you know, if you think of your sources of truth, there's etherscan. From a data perspective, OpenSea, except for OpenSea, is like, no. No other exchanges exist. Ours is going to show the accuracy of ether scan and the trustworthiness of OpenSea, but it's also going to have just a beautiful interface.
00:10:28.894 - 00:10:35.010, Speaker A: Okay, so when Melton did come and say, yo, why did you give away your dick butt? What she usually did she get notified by a Flip?
00:10:35.090 - 00:10:36.678, Speaker C: I hope she did, but I don't.
00:10:36.844 - 00:10:37.734, Speaker A: I'm sure she did.
00:10:37.772 - 00:10:43.450, Speaker C: She may just have, like, a direct brain connection with, like, somebody gave away a dick.
00:10:44.030 - 00:11:04.814, Speaker A: So it seems to be, like, really at the intersection of people who care about collections but still play the trading game. And so I really care about cool cats. I'm willing to sell my Cool Cat, but I'm also willing to buy another Cool Cat because I really like the Cool Cat system. So it's like somebody who's willing to play the financial game but still enjoys a collection at the same time.
00:11:04.852 - 00:11:21.510, Speaker C: Yeah, and I find what most people do is they may have one thing that they really care about. I was talking to Luca from Pudgy Penguins recently, and I think it might be the only collection that I've never sold something from. And I didn't realize it, but I think I'm a pudgy Maxi.
00:11:22.090 - 00:11:25.474, Speaker A: Well, I, however, am a pudgy bottoms bottom seller.
00:11:25.522 - 00:11:35.734, Speaker C: There you go. I'm sorry. They may be a Pudgy Maxi, but they're a cool cats. Enjoyer.
00:11:35.782 - 00:11:36.090, Speaker D: Sure.
00:11:36.160 - 00:11:57.118, Speaker C: And so they actually see the monetary side of some stuff that they're not totally in love with, but then they've got their version of a grail community. And for that one, it's not about the money, but they still want to keep track of everything. They want to know the news. They want to see what their portfolios were. So we have like a portfolio valuation tracker with multi wallet. We have taxes. Of course we do.
00:11:57.284 - 00:11:58.506, Speaker A: Ryan's going to love that one.
00:11:58.548 - 00:11:58.946, Speaker D: All of a sudden.
00:11:58.968 - 00:11:59.682, Speaker A: Ryan's going to love it.
00:11:59.736 - 00:12:21.382, Speaker C: Me and Ryan are just going to nerd out on the taxes. So it actually will transition your cost basis between your multiple wallets. So every wallet that you've connected to Flip, we can generate a report and send you your tax basis. If you're beautiful harvesting, if you're loss harvesting or looking at long term gains, it'll qualify that. Tell you what, you've made it's pretty daggum cool, man.
00:12:21.436 - 00:12:27.706, Speaker A: I'm sure a lot of 2021 NFT traders or 2022 NFT traders are now like, oh, I wish I had had.
00:12:27.728 - 00:12:35.630, Speaker C: That when I was doing well. Now they're still doing it, but they're like, I cannot believe I lost $50,000 on a JPEG.
00:12:37.170 - 00:12:39.854, Speaker A: Did you raise for Flip? Like, how is this whole thing we.
00:12:39.892 - 00:13:12.694, Speaker C: Raised in late 2021 was our seed rounds cool. And that was led by Distributed Global in chapter one. And we'll probably be raising again this year, and we're in it for the long haul to build wealth. And one other thing you mentioned earlier, kind of some of the hot topics. We're doing some stuff around like a royalties API right now because we think part of being catered to communities is to really empower them. It's to be opinionated, but not necessarily political. We're not telling them, hey, here's what you should do with this royalties API.
00:13:12.694 - 00:13:20.650, Speaker C: But you do deserve the information of, like, my community. I want token gate at my discord based on whether they paid royalties or not. You can do it.
00:13:20.720 - 00:13:20.954, Speaker D: Cool.
00:13:20.992 - 00:13:32.490, Speaker C: And so that's one of the things where it's more of like, creating tooling specific to those communities. So we're trying to think pretty deeply about that side and get a bit opinionated. I'm excited.
00:13:32.570 - 00:13:38.738, Speaker A: Very needed, especially as other platforms are really just marginalizing everyone to have the opt in platform.
00:13:38.824 - 00:13:39.026, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:13:39.048 - 00:14:31.838, Speaker C: And that's something that I think a lot of us saw coming for a long time, is like the race is zero for fees and liquidity and NFTs is good in a way, but I think if you take something non fungible and then just make it completely fungible, you're kind of upending the original purpose. And to me, the ERC 721 spec is a deed or a title or a receipt for a thing. It's like this thing, right? And I think that's still important and that's the future. Use case of NFTs. But derivatives platforms are still huge and they can like, from a volume perspective, they can trade at multiples of the spot platform. So it's not impossible for board Apes to do a billion dollars worth of derivatives trading, but like $100 million worth of spot trading of the underlying.
00:14:31.934 - 00:14:44.818, Speaker A: So who are you looking for for Flip? What's your ideal customer and on the hiring side of your hiring or BD relationship side, who are you looking for to join the movement? Yeah, we want movement. What do you guys call yourselves?
00:14:44.914 - 00:14:47.602, Speaker C: We say flip and then say go to flip. XYZ.
00:14:47.666 - 00:14:48.038, Speaker D: Cool.
00:14:48.124 - 00:15:22.370, Speaker C: But yeah, we call ourselves Flip. From a customer perspective, we want people that are excited about NFTs, excited about the long term future of NFTs. There's more than even just the speculation side of NFTs. I'm really into experiential NFTs, so, like, hey, I'm at this event and I didn't spend any money to be here. Sorry, but let's say I spent a be here. The art or the NFT is actually my receipt with a visual component, but I'm happy to have spent that. Don't need long term value from it.
00:15:22.370 - 00:15:49.226, Speaker C: But that NFT can still be my token, my access pass, the various gated components that NFTs can serve an interesting purpose for. We want people that are excited about what that means, what the community side of NFTs unlock. And then from a business development perspective, if you are one of these communities, if you're building NFTs, if you're looking for better tools, better places to send your community, talk to me.
00:15:49.328 - 00:15:49.980, Speaker D: Beautiful.
00:15:50.670 - 00:15:56.814, Speaker A: What is the future of content production? Tell me about the future of ledger cast up only and ledger doing content?
00:15:56.932 - 00:16:17.762, Speaker C: Yeah, I still do content every week, but more on the technical side of things. Weekly open and ledger cast but up only is still here. I promise we talk a lot and we'll get back to a more regular format pretty soon. But if something really big happens, we'll pop on.
00:16:17.816 - 00:16:22.294, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm sure. Hopefully I could take a little bit more break before that happens.
00:16:22.492 - 00:16:23.334, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:23.532 - 00:16:27.702, Speaker A: Ledger, if there's anything else, feel free to go out and open mic, but otherwise, thank you for joining me.
00:16:27.756 - 00:16:32.854, Speaker C: I'm just happy to be here, and, man, y'all are doing great work. It inspires me, so I appreciate it.
00:16:32.892 - 00:16:42.238, Speaker A: Well, hey, before I had Luke behind the camera and Dave behind on the audio, I had Ledger teaching me everything I know about OBS. The cross pollination goes back pretty far.
00:16:42.324 - 00:16:42.670, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:16:42.740 - 00:16:43.900, Speaker D: Good to see you. Cheers. Later.
