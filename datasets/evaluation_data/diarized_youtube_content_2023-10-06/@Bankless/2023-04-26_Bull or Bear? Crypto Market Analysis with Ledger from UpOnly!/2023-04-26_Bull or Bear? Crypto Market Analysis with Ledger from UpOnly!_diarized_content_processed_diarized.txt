00:00:27.860 - 00:00:45.400, Speaker A: Bankless Nation. Where is the crypto market going? Are we going up, we going down? I don't know. Maybe a bit of both. David, today is an episode where we look at prices, we look at the charts. Bankless is a thesis driven media company, but not today. We're just looking at price today. Who do we have on what are we discussing?
00:00:45.740 - 00:01:40.910, Speaker B: We're bringing on ledger from up only fame to help us guide. Walk us through the charts. So we're going to look at the big boys, the bitcoin, the ether, the BTC ether ratio over the long time frame and also the near time frame, because, Ryan, two weekly roll ups. Ago you were talking about how you were feeling ready to capitulate on the possibility of triple digit Ether ever coming back. And then we had a moment where I was like, wait a second. We could just go right back down to $1,000 Ether TBD on three digit Ether. But I think the big question that is going around in the crypto Twitter space is, is this the biggest bull trap of the bear market? And I think we remember back in 2019 the run from bitcoin from 3000 to 14,000 back down to 4500.
00:01:40.910 - 00:02:01.908, Speaker B: So I remember that bull trap. And I want to make sure that to the best of our ability, we are able to at least ask the question, are we seeing something similar here today in 2023? Because if you remember, that was May of 2019 is when that happened. Right in the middle of the year.
00:02:01.994 - 00:02:02.624, Speaker A: I know it's.
00:02:02.672 - 00:02:04.496, Speaker B: Here we are, April 26.
00:02:04.608 - 00:02:24.860, Speaker A: Interesting point in the market, that's for sure. And I'm going to give you some more commentary on that. But before we do, got to let our Bankless Nation know a message from our friends and sponsors over at Gnosis. Safe. Now it's called just safe. This is the multi SIG that everyone in Ethereum uses. It secures billions of dollars.
00:02:24.860 - 00:02:48.032, Speaker A: Bankless uses it. You go to bankless. Ethnosis Safe. That's where we store the goods here. And you've also heard us talking about account abstraction as well. This is the next generation of Ethereum wallets that give these wallets like a fintech type of experience. Well, Safe is launching something called SafeCore, which is an account abstraction tech stack.
00:02:48.032 - 00:02:49.652, Speaker A: David, do you want to tell them about this?
00:02:49.786 - 00:02:59.828, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really an SDK for all of you account abstraction builders out there. Right now we are in the paradigm of what we call externally owned accounts.
00:02:59.924 - 00:03:00.596, Speaker C: Boo.
00:03:00.708 - 00:03:28.508, Speaker B: We want to be with smart contract wallets. Yay. What do we need to get there? We need an account abstraction SDK, which is exactly what Safe has built with their Safe Core account abstraction SDK. You can go access that if you're a builder. There's a link in the show notes to go click that. There is also an account abstraction anything goes hackathon starting May 1. This is in addition to being a hackathon, a nontechnical hackathon.
00:03:28.508 - 00:03:52.708, Speaker B: So if you have memes products, ideas, MVPs, everything is fair game. That's why they're calling it an anything goes hackathon. If you want to participate in your first hackathon, but you are not technical, this is a great place to get started. So help inspire this smart contract revolution so we can leave the stone age of Wallet UX behind us. And you can do that with Safe at Safe Global slash core or click the link in the show notes.
00:03:52.804 - 00:03:59.080, Speaker A: Dude, I can't believe you're so mean to EOA wallets just then. I mean, they've served us well up to this point, okay? Have some respect.
00:03:59.820 - 00:04:02.520, Speaker B: They are literally the Stone age of wallets.
00:04:02.880 - 00:04:32.240, Speaker A: Well, okay, so getting back to price though, and kind of the comments, yeah, we are in a very interesting place in the market. I feel like something about this under 2000 mark for ETH, right? That's just a number that sticks in my head and conveniently going to this episode. We're also just under 30K on the price of bitcoin, and I know that because I just checked. Otherwise I haven't been paying a lot of attention to price. But today is our opportunity to pay much more attention to it with Ledger. Guys. We'll be right back with Ledger.
00:04:32.240 - 00:04:40.504, Speaker A: But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible, including our number one recommended exchange. That's Kraken. Go check them out.

00:05:25.242 - 00:05:26.064, Speaker C: The token. Hub.
00:05:26.112 - 00:05:55.404, Speaker D: You're a onestop shop for alpha to help you navigate through the crypto markets. Have you ever wished for a trusted resource that would share their thoughts, ratings and their opinions about tokens? Boy, do we have the product for you. The Bankless Token Hub is where we provide Bankless citizens with the alpha on the hottest tokens in crypto. We do the research so you don't have to. The Bankless Token Hub includes the Token Ratings, where our team shares their research and outlook on the hottest tokens in crypto. Also, the Token hub includes bankless bags. Our own internal investment club.
00:05:55.404 - 00:06:26.324, Speaker D: Bankless Bags is where we put our money, where our mouth is. And for the bankless power user out there, you can access the analyst team 24/7 inside the Bankless Nation Discord. You can ask them questions and learn from a group of people deep in the weeds of crypto investing. The last feature of the Token Hub is the ability to upvote or downvote token ratings. The Bankless Token Hub lets you learn from your fellow citizens to rate these tokens yourselves. The Bankless Token Hub is launching right now and has already been beta tested by your fellow bankless citizens. So stay tuned in the Bankless Discord for updates.
00:06:26.324 - 00:07:03.344, Speaker D: And if you're not a bankless citizen, well, you better sign up if you want access, because this corner of Bankless is available for citizens only. I'll see you in the discord. If you haven't yet experienced the superpowers that a smart contract wallet gives you, check out Ambire. Ambire works with all the EVM chains, the L2s like Arbitrum, optimism, and polygon, but also the non ethereum ecosystems like avalanche and phantom. Ambire lets you pay for gas and stablecoins, meaning you'll never have to spend your precious ETH again.

00:07:19.748 - 00:07:36.172, Speaker B: You already know him, but here we've got Ledger, aka Brian, aka Ledger co host of the Up Only podcast. Don't know if that's a thing anymore. We'll ask that later on in the show. Well, also the co host of Ledger Cast, a trading podcast that he runs with Josh Olswitz, also the co host of the Daily Open podcast.
00:07:36.236 - 00:07:37.904, Speaker C: Weekly Open. Weekly Open. Weekly Open.
00:07:37.942 - 00:07:39.072, Speaker B: Excuse me. Weekly open.
00:07:39.126 - 00:07:39.888, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:07:40.054 - 00:07:46.596, Speaker B: And overall, another content producer in the space of crypto. Ledger, welcome back to the show.
00:07:46.698 - 00:07:51.748, Speaker C: Hey, thanks for having me. My screen got smaller, so I don't know what happened there, but here we are.
00:07:51.834 - 00:07:53.264, Speaker A: It's bear market shrinkage.
00:07:53.312 - 00:07:57.908, Speaker C: That's what I think.
00:07:57.914 - 00:08:36.164, Speaker B: We want to hop right into this because there's two forces in the conversation warfare games of crypto Twitter, which is this is the biggest bull trap of all time versus this is just the bounce back out of the FTX liquidations and the three rows capital liquidations. And this is about what's fair value. And so I'm hoping you can help us navigate that question. Of course, I don't expect anyone to be able to read the future and answer that question, but when you hear the question, at the very least, are we in the biggest bull trap of all time? What comes to mind?
00:08:36.362 - 00:09:09.950, Speaker C: This is the early innings. If it's even a bull trap. This is unimpressive. Yet, as a bull trap, I am not even remotely interested in selling anything at this moment. And bears will feel much more pain even if there's a longer sideways market ahead. We are at the equivalent in my mind, if you look at Ethereum at 2000 of Bitcoin breaching back above 4K.
00:09:13.040 - 00:09:15.036, Speaker B: Back compared to the last.
00:09:15.218 - 00:09:17.776, Speaker C: Yeah, and I can share a screen whenever you want me to, but you.
00:09:17.798 - 00:09:18.992, Speaker B: Can go for it. Yeah, we are right.
00:09:19.046 - 00:09:24.788, Speaker A: We got to chart this whole episode. This is just a bull trap for ants. You're just not even impressed by this.
00:09:24.954 - 00:09:31.670, Speaker B: So you're saying that bull traps are a thing and the bull traps are totally possible and we're not there yet.
00:09:33.640 - 00:09:38.228, Speaker A: Talk to me what a bull trap is. What is a bull trap anyway? Guys, for the non traders, a bull.
00:09:38.244 - 00:10:31.960, Speaker C: Trap is where bulls think all the pain is over and gone and done and the real pain has not even started. Like we're going to go to $500 ETH or $400 ETH and everyone that thinks we were done at sub 1008, 900, whatever is wrong and they're all going to feel pain and we're going to go much deeper. Instead, I would say bears will continue to feel punishment as they try to fade the market recovery. And I mean this across ethnbtc. This is not an ETH BTC conversation. If I look at Bitcoin itself, I see really excellent structure and recovery. This is not to say it can't go down 20, 30%.
00:10:31.960 - 00:11:24.868, Speaker C: I don't care about that. I care if it's going to go down another like 60, 70% from current prices or make new lows to a significant degree or something like that, or massively underperform the S and P 500 or broader markets. In my mind, crypto is way ahead of the rest of the market in terms of feeling pain and recovering to where you may not have had max pain in some markets, but I believe that we've had max pain and then some in major crypto markets. There are bear markets going on in crypto right now. Without a doubt, on a relative basis, you cannot objectively look at Bitcoin or Ethereum and say that it's true about those two assets. Now, this is what I said. I was going to spoil you with DeFi and I'm using Abe.
00:11:24.868 - 00:12:15.064, Speaker C: I love Ave. Great product, great team, great people, great principles. Ave relative to Ethereum is in a massive bear market and making new lows DeFi. If you own the coins or even if you own, like NFTs, those bear markets may have years ahead on a relative basis to some of the strongest assets on planet Earth. Right? Like Aave relative to the dollar is just sideways, no problem, not new lows. But when you're comparing it to somebody calls it ultrasound money and ethereum or the linear distribution schedule of bitcoin where you know exactly what's going to happen with monetary policy. Ethereum, we don't know.
00:12:15.064 - 00:13:03.000, Speaker C: We just know people love burning it. But either way, you have this disinflationary like minimum inflation, lowering inflation over time, where the world is inflating more and more. And with ethereum you have disinflationary and sometimes highly deflationary assets that people are using block space and there is demand to put hash rate out there and to spend energy for bitcoin and to spend development cycles and compute power on ethereum. And those are unbelievably, fundamentally strong assets with really powerful economic principles that no other asset in the world can compare.
00:13:03.980 - 00:13:06.360, Speaker B: Man, I feel like I'm listening to a bankless podcast.
00:13:07.500 - 00:13:31.676, Speaker C: You're just listening to me. It's just me, Brian Krogsgaard, representing himself and no one else. No co host, financial advice or anything else. I love holding ethereum. I love holding bitcoin. I love holding hard assets right now. I love when I can actually attach yield to those assets if possible and safe and secure and not over leveraged.
00:13:31.676 - 00:14:43.210, Speaker C: If you're over leveraged, if you're in derivative assets, if you're deep down into the weeds of like in a coin sense, the 1000th coin not interested, not even remotely. They're not strong assets. If you are interested in the core framework of what makes up decentralized applications and finance and money and stuff and ultra durable, that when the United States is going after it, it doesn't care because there's hundreds of other countries that'll pick up that baton. There are hundreds of thousands and tens of thousands of other developers and other software creators and other principled believers that see the value of this as money and see the value of this as an application platform and see the value of this as durable goods relative to their piece of crap inflation, their piece of crap politicians, their piece of crap policies that you don't understand. You don't know what's going on. You don't know what's going to happen other than that you're going to lose your value over time. These two assets are some of the best in the world, full stop.
00:14:43.210 - 00:14:56.750, Speaker C: So you said we're just going to look at price, but I'm screening fundamentally based on that. And then we can talk about, know, some trader looking at the weekly chart or the daily chart or the hourly chart is going to lose or make money.
00:14:57.440 - 00:14:57.896, Speaker A: David.
00:14:57.928 - 00:14:59.390, Speaker C: I like electric guy.
00:14:59.760 - 00:15:14.768, Speaker B: This is you're. You're bifurcating this conversation into two and I think we'll approach each one. And I'm actually really interested in talking about the DeFi tokens, but I know that comes second just because and it's.
00:15:14.784 - 00:15:20.420, Speaker C: Not just looked I'm just clicking random ETH pairs like AVAX ETH looks like.
00:15:20.490 - 00:15:40.584, Speaker B: Right, well, okay, so the pattern I'm going to point out here, if you do ENS versus ETH, it's down. I bet you if you do any DeFi token and any alt layer one that went through its first bear market. The combinator or first cycle tokens are just down bad versus bitcoin and ether.
00:15:40.712 - 00:16:00.160, Speaker C: That's right. But even, like, second cycle tokens, like SNX looks like it could break down relative to ETH. And Synthetix is doing some pretty amazing stuff. Right know? I don't know the economic even I'm not paying attention. And that's the attention. Kobe talks about this a lot. It's an attention.
00:16:00.160 - 00:16:07.168, Speaker C: And why why bother down the deep line if you are not the front page of attention?
00:16:07.344 - 00:16:10.084, Speaker A: Can we just take a peek at, like, a L2 token, though?
00:16:10.202 - 00:16:11.124, Speaker C: Yeah. Which one you want?
00:16:11.162 - 00:16:11.792, Speaker A: A matic?
00:16:11.856 - 00:16:14.148, Speaker C: Or like a how about arbitrary op?
00:16:14.314 - 00:16:15.956, Speaker A: Okay. This is so new, though.
00:16:16.058 - 00:16:16.768, Speaker C: Okay.
00:16:16.954 - 00:16:43.200, Speaker B: Right. That was another category of conversation that I had, is, like, there's the Ethan bitcoin, there's the blue chips, there's the DeFi tokens. There's also the L2 tokens. Maddox is interesting because it's a first cycle token. It had its first big bull market this last cycle, but then also, it's a L2 token to be price referenced with optimism in Arbitrum as well. So that's like a third topic of conversation.
00:16:44.340 - 00:16:46.530, Speaker C: This is optimism. I don't want to own this.
00:16:48.900 - 00:16:50.076, Speaker A: Not relative to ETH.
00:16:50.108 - 00:17:16.570, Speaker C: You're saying this is relative to ETH. I think optimism is great. And this is the dichotomy of a deflationary world. Right. When you live in a deflationary world, when the underlying asset is the strongest asset, it disincentivizes creative production and upside. There's a ton of, like, optimism. Investors, early investors are so happy.
00:17:16.570 - 00:17:32.748, Speaker C: Right? Optimism. Retail buyers are not, and they probably won't be for a year or two. You know what I mean? This could all change. This is a daily chart. This isn't that big of a deal. This could change in a week. Right now, right this moment.
00:17:32.748 - 00:17:35.164, Speaker C: Not interested. I want to see much lower prices.
00:17:35.212 - 00:17:41.692, Speaker A: Are you making a case for ledger? Like, do you remember that slogan, the dollar wrecking ball where the dollar just sucked?
00:17:41.756 - 00:17:43.152, Speaker C: Yeah, it's the ETH wrecking ball.
00:17:43.216 - 00:17:46.100, Speaker A: Is this the ETH wrecking ball? Is that what you're saying?
00:17:46.170 - 00:18:13.630, Speaker C: It's Ethan BTC wrecking ball, where you see essentially the equivalent of BTC dominance or ETH dominance or Majors dominance. Now that's a chart I like. That's a daily chart of Bitcoin dominance relative to everything else. But in the scheme of things, on a weekly basis, it's still down here. There is nothing preventing this from moving another 50%.
00:18:14.000 - 00:18:19.436, Speaker A: You think Bitcoin dominance could get to 70% even in an ETH wrecking ball world?
00:18:19.538 - 00:19:05.980, Speaker C: Well, ETH and BTC are going to imagine the double wrecking ball component there. We'll look at ETH BTC, we'll battle about ETH and BTC, because that's actually an amazing battle. It's like, where do you overweight ETH BTC, that chart? I think Bitcoin has a chance to drop a 25% bomb on ETH. That's the worst case scenario in my mind. I also think ETH could double if it just says, all right, little bitcoin boy, here, sit aside, and I'm going to take over, because people use me. That's a really interesting debate. That's the only debate that I actually find interesting, because when I look at this, this is just because it's the chart I have available.
00:19:05.980 - 00:19:12.656, Speaker C: If I had a BTC and ETH versus Everything chart, I'm in.
00:19:12.838 - 00:19:13.376, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:13.478 - 00:20:01.964, Speaker C: So why would I own everything if I'm really interested in BTC and ETH? And to me, the high beta. So, like, 5% 10% of your portfolio is go make bets on things you believe in. You all were talking about account abstraction, like ideas that people are building protocols on, things where you invest at 10 million or 50 million that might be worth 500 million. A ten X is amazing on, like, an early stage thing. If your tech is right, something that is not the tech is not right or the product market fit is not right, I'm not interested. I'm not interested in something that is. If I'm the one that got in for a 25 or $50 million valuation and now it's a two or three or 4 billion, that's great.
00:20:01.964 - 00:20:30.810, Speaker C: I'm perfectly happy to hold it and move that to BTC and ETH over time. If I'm looking to get in a two or three or $4 billion valuation, I need a bull market to take that to a $40 billion valuation. So when I look at the big L2s, I look at some of that kind of stuff, I still think they're awesome. I just don't think they're awesome for the next six months. Like when BTC and ETH might stomp on absolutely everything.
00:20:31.740 - 00:20:41.080, Speaker A: Six months. That's an interesting time horizon here. So your basic I want to connect this to kind of the privilege of.
00:20:41.230 - 00:20:47.752, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't have the privilege of people's comments, so I'm talking to my two friends. I'm not talking to the YouTube commenters.
00:20:47.816 - 00:20:59.248, Speaker A: That's a better way to do it, honestly. Okay, so Ethan Bitcoin like, they are Mario and Know, and they just picked up the star. I just watched the Super Mario Brothers movies. Awesome, by the way.
00:20:59.254 - 00:20:59.808, Speaker C: Was it good?
00:20:59.894 - 00:21:02.288, Speaker A: Yeah. And they're just smashing through everything.
00:21:02.374 - 00:21:40.152, Speaker C: They are like, this is a two year sideways battle. Two years. Now, ETH won the previous, like, whatever this is, climb out of the 2019 bear market. ETH climbed, climbed, climbed, and broke up, and it became a big kid. Right? ETH went from, I don't know, XRP or ETH, and now it's like, that's hilarious. There is only ETH. There is Bitcoin, and there is Ethereum, and Ethereum leveled up, and now it's gone sideways for two years.
00:21:40.152 - 00:22:26.830, Speaker C: Now, is Bitcoin going to pillage and be the bigger wrecking ball? ETH will still do well even if it's at zero five, even if I believe it has a destiny for zero point 14. But if it goes to zero five and it has a destiny for zero, I have a three x on a relative basis to win Buy More ETH when that happens. So your bet, your gamble that you should be making in my mind, what I'm going to make is, do I want to own ethereum or do I want to own bitcoin? I want to own ethereum. Without a doubt, for the trip to zero, ethereum will hit zeroteen in my mind.
00:22:29.040 - 00:22:30.688, Speaker B: That's real close to the flipping, by the way.
00:22:30.694 - 00:22:32.496, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to say, what is the flipping? Is it?
00:22:32.518 - 00:22:47.700, Speaker C: But that's what's so sick. This is where the fun is. Imagine Udi versus David. Not as good as David versus Goliath, but it's.
00:22:50.280 - 00:22:52.900, Speaker B: Really gracious to uni calling him a goliath.
00:22:54.120 - 00:23:01.768, Speaker C: Yeah. Michael sailor can be David. David versus Sailor. Right.
00:23:01.854 - 00:23:03.064, Speaker B: I like that one better.
00:23:03.182 - 00:23:18.556, Speaker C: Yeah. So that's a great battle. I want to see that battle. Now, David, you might get down bad. That's a 200 week moving average of ETH relative to BTC. So the four year moving average, and.
00:23:18.578 - 00:23:22.176, Speaker B: It'S like I'm looking at right there, 49.
00:23:22.278 - 00:23:43.060, Speaker C: Yeah, that's the four year moving average. ETH could go there. And Sailor is laughing at you and talking about bitcoin as energy, and he's sitting on top of a volcano, and bitcoin is $100,000 and bitcoin and ETH is whatever 5% of that is, right?
00:23:43.130 - 00:23:44.564, Speaker B: It's $5,000.
00:23:44.682 - 00:23:51.848, Speaker C: $5,000. So it's like, oh, cry me a river. My ethereum is worth $5,000. But he's like, but bitcoin is $100,000.
00:23:51.934 - 00:24:05.390, Speaker A: And I cannot be stopped in that voice, by the way, David, would you take that bet with Sailor? Could we meme a David versus Sailor into existence? Like, bet him on the ratio? That'd be a lot of fun.
00:24:05.840 - 00:24:09.230, Speaker B: I think both Sailor nor I care for that bet.
00:24:10.240 - 00:24:49.070, Speaker C: But you know what happens? I don't care if it's 105. We're just using these as easy numbers, right? It could be 20,001 thousand, right? Like, it's the same ratio, but let's just say it's 105 in 2025. Okay? That's not a short bet, that's a two year process to say 100,005 thousand. And E bleeds out for this is here we go. January 2025. So this chart just is the worst little racetrack car. Like, what are those things called that my kids do?
00:24:50.000 - 00:24:53.980, Speaker B: Yeah, the little zippy black track race cars.
00:24:54.480 - 00:24:54.796, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:54.818 - 00:25:43.470, Speaker C: It's like the worst track ever. It's like just this slow drip out where bitcoin gets stronger and stronger and ETH is doing great and bitcoiners are laughing at ethereum people, and then ethereum is like, all right, and it goes fifteen K, and it goes from here to here because, I don't know, the World Bank is now on ethereum. Who cares? Who cares what the narrative is? You just need a narrative. You need the alt season, you need the ETH leading, you need the DeFi summer, you need that moment that takes three months, and it just unwinds all of the Sailor energy. And then you have your alt season and all of those freaking L2s and DFI coins and dog tokens and cartoon pictures and Meladys, they go to infinity and then everything explodes again.
00:25:44.000 - 00:25:45.644, Speaker B: Man, you make it sound so simple.
00:25:45.762 - 00:25:50.270, Speaker C: But that's a cycle. We just did that. We just did that like a year ago.
00:25:50.960 - 00:25:52.690, Speaker A: It's how it always happens.
00:25:53.300 - 00:26:23.368, Speaker C: We went from 400 to 4000 and David was like, just imagine if my Ethereum went to $4,000 and I bought it at 90. Brian's like, I will talk to you from my evil lair. That's what we did. So now we're like, oh, when are we going to make it again? And it's like, it's only been a year, man. It's been two years since the market really topped and a year since it bottomed or something like that.
00:26:23.534 - 00:26:25.816, Speaker A: Something has to happen that's unexpected, right?
00:26:25.838 - 00:26:28.308, Speaker C: Ledger that is unexpected.
00:26:28.404 - 00:26:29.524, Speaker A: Why is that unexpected?
00:26:29.572 - 00:27:16.280, Speaker C: Because if bitcoin is at, let's just say bitcoin goes to $100,000 in 2025, but the S and P 500 has not made a new high. And it's like, illegal in America to run a D five company. You have $5,000 ETH and $100,000 bitcoin. It's illegal to operate a D five company in America. Like, Bitcoin as currency is in two countries or something, like El Salvador and whoever they pick next, freaking Cuba or something. And it's like, that's the scenario we live in in a couple of years. And the habiting happened and the hash rate tripled and we're all pumped up, but our maladys are worth 0.1%
00:27:16.280 - 00:27:19.960, Speaker C: of what they were in 2022. I don't have a malady.
00:27:21.840 - 00:28:02.392, Speaker B: Last bear market, when young little David was excited about his $90 Ether, and I was, like, fighting with the bitcoiners and I just felt that they were wrong and I had people like Ryan agree with me and all that stuff. And then the cycle happened more or less, like, kind of how we thought that it would play out. Fast forward to now, I do not feel that same level of confidence about reading the market, because like you said, we got this Gary Gensler guy who's coming to jail, all of our developers, and we have interest rates now, and there's all these new things that make me much less convicted versus a whole entire cycle ago.
00:28:02.446 - 00:28:48.584, Speaker C: But it's because you made a lot of money when the asset was really cheap relative to a typical person. It doesn't matter how much money you made, right? Like, you own one ethereum. You own one ethereum from $100 and it's like 20 cups of coffee, right? Then you held that until it went to $4,000 and you're like, I bought $4,000 with 20 cups of coffee. I forsook my Starbucks trip every day, every workday for a month, and now I have a used Toyota Corolla. That's the bet you already won. That's the bitcoiner bet. From seven dollars to seven hundred dollars.
00:28:48.584 - 00:29:48.892, Speaker C: Or from like that's 2012, right? It's the Bitcoiner bet from the harder one was bitcoin was breaking 2013 twelve and $1,300 highs and went to $20,000. That's more like where we're talking about now for Ethereum and for Bitcoin. The road to Bitcoin being worth half a million dollars is really hard for me to imagine. When it was $7 when I first heard about it in 2012. So $7 to half a million dollars. So that's two cups of coffee to a house. That's the trade that Lop made, right? That's the trade that Kobe made, right? The people that were buying Bitcoin for $7, $12, what's the friggin difference between 100% move when it goes to half a million dollars? People just hate you.
00:29:48.892 - 00:30:10.530, Speaker C: They hate you. They hate you. They hate your industry. There's jealousy and envy and you're just like, I don't know, bro, I HODLed. So if you are Mr. Bankless Ethereum, believe in the network, believe in the true value of what this can be. The compute layer of the entire world.
00:30:10.530 - 00:31:37.324, Speaker C: Public and private infrastructure that runs on public infrastructure secured by itself, that cannot be disturbed or overtaken, does not have a single point of influence that can stop it. Ethereum has challenges, right? Like, who gets governance done? Right? Can the CIA change the direction of Ethereum governance? Those are the types of changes you're talking about. Can one miner take over the Bitcoin network? Can North Korea have an impact? These are big kid conversations. These are state players don't like that debate because it's too close to being real. Like, what's more powerful, bitcoin and Ethereum or a tiny nation? Take? I will put my chips on the side of Bitcoin and Ethereum before I would put my chips on the 50th largest country in the world. But what about when that decentralized financial platform is the fifth largest country in the world? It's like Australia or Canada, and they're like, we just keep printing trillions of dollars and we control it because we have gigantic guns. We're going to point our guns at Bitcoin and the rest of the world is like, no, our guns already lost and we have nothing.
00:31:37.324 - 00:31:46.544, Speaker C: And we are now part of this empire that's growing. This is the bitcoinization argument, right? I'm just putting it in different terms.
00:31:46.662 - 00:31:54.560, Speaker A: By the way, guys, if you're curious, the 50th largest country in the world by economy is New Zealand. So that's ledger just shitting all over New Zealand.
00:31:56.180 - 00:32:03.524, Speaker B: I was about to say it's like, man, I don't even know I can't name don't even know how to map out where the fifth 50th largest country in the world.
00:32:03.562 - 00:32:33.180, Speaker C: But they know who Satoshi is and they know who Vitalik is. But who cares who the Prime Minister of New Zealand is? New Zealand looks beautiful. They probably have both. It's just a couple of guys that need more power with their amazing oceanfront states and their doomsday bunkers. Honestly, you might want to bet on New Zealand and against, I don't know, something really close to New Zealand because New Zealand's. Got the doomsday bunkers.
00:32:34.740 - 00:32:47.404, Speaker B: I had a conversation with Ryan on, I think, the weekly roll up this last week, and it was more or less like a conversation about the ODS of the next cycle playing out just like the previous cycles.
00:32:47.452 - 00:32:55.620, Speaker C: And I remember going a double top, basically, it goes to the same exact spot it went, and it's kind of like a ho hum. Is that what you mean?
00:32:55.770 - 00:33:16.620, Speaker B: No, I mean, like in the 2018 bear market. No, it was a bear market. And then everyone was like, oh, the next cycle that comes. The next cycle that comes. And My tried to put on the little contrarian hat and I was like, everyone's talking about this next cycle as if this given thing doesn't consensus mean that it's not going to happen?
00:33:16.690 - 00:33:18.588, Speaker C: And then that happened.
00:33:18.674 - 00:33:18.972, Speaker B: Right?
00:33:19.026 - 00:33:22.136, Speaker C: And that made every single person, including.
00:33:22.248 - 00:33:25.324, Speaker B: For the podcast listeners ledger is pointing at the COVID Dump.
00:33:25.452 - 00:33:39.796, Speaker C: Yeah, but that's including you. Including me. You know where you were. You questioned everything. BitMEX had $18 million from Bitcoin going to zero on a derivatives platform that a bunch of apes were killing each other on.
00:33:39.898 - 00:33:42.324, Speaker A: That was scary. March 2020. I remember.
00:33:42.362 - 00:33:45.076, Speaker C: It was super scary. And that was ryan did not where.
00:33:45.098 - 00:33:46.724, Speaker B: You were on that moment.
00:33:46.842 - 00:33:49.320, Speaker A: I remember my office, as always, David.
00:33:50.140 - 00:33:53.576, Speaker B: No, we were recording a podcast. We were recording episode number two.
00:33:53.678 - 00:33:59.548, Speaker A: Yeah. Was that number two when Spiked and Die was destabilizing and ETH was yeah.
00:33:59.554 - 00:34:01.416, Speaker B: And we were both getting liquidated in MakerDAO.
00:34:01.448 - 00:34:09.244, Speaker C: Yeah, it was a Wednesday or Thursday night, I can't remember which, but I remember exactly who I was with.
00:34:09.282 - 00:34:09.870, Speaker B: Morning.
00:34:10.480 - 00:34:13.216, Speaker C: No, but the night before, when it.
00:34:13.218 - 00:34:16.764, Speaker B: Was like five k it was the night before. It was the night before Arthur Hayes.
00:34:16.812 - 00:34:24.700, Speaker A: Was calling for triple digit ETH for so long and he actually got it and I couldn't believe it. Sorry. Double digit ETH. Double digit?
00:34:24.860 - 00:34:41.236, Speaker C: Yeah. The double digit shitcoin. Yep. And he also might have had to turn the exchange off in order to prevent Bitcoin from going to zero. Bitcoin derivatives. I'm just making stuff up. But that's the fear.
00:34:41.236 - 00:35:05.570, Speaker C: Even though it was the start of the greatest wealth creation cycle in crypto's history. The day after now, this is a weekly chart. That next week was so scary that next week was like, we didn't go to zero. I hope we survive. The next week was like, wag me, baby, let's go.
00:35:08.420 - 00:35:17.620, Speaker B: Okay, but the question I was asking is throughout that last bear market, I was just saying, like, oh, everyone's talking about the next cycle that's inevitably coming. And then it did. And so fast forward to this.
00:35:17.690 - 00:35:30.292, Speaker C: But here, up here where they were really talking about that, and they lose faith. They lose faith. They lose faith. They gain it. They question everything. Half the people literally went bankrupt. I mean, you remember the funds that went bankrupt during that period.
00:35:30.292 - 00:35:37.416, Speaker C: They couldn't experience any of this. They never made it because they went broke. They never made it because they got.
00:35:37.518 - 00:35:44.716, Speaker B: But you're saying, like, right now in this present bear market, you're pointing at Ether, they're going to do it again.
00:35:44.898 - 00:36:19.364, Speaker C: We're somewhere between no, I'm just trying to point at parallels. I'm not trying to say Third Avenue is going to be the same as Second Avenue. I'm saying it's a street with buildings on it. And typically this street over here is kind of a growth phase once you build the other street. You know what I mean? Bitcoin City is going to grow or whatever. I believe in the growth of it, but if people don't come in and inhabit it, then no, of course it can change.
00:36:19.482 - 00:36:24.436, Speaker A: One of the ways we were talking about it on the roll up was like, what year is it compared to dumping?
00:36:24.468 - 00:36:26.520, Speaker C: Like, crazy, as I talk, by the way.
00:36:26.670 - 00:36:28.824, Speaker B: Yeah, we're in the comments saying so as well.
00:36:28.862 - 00:36:30.910, Speaker A: We're not helping the market right now, but okay.
00:36:31.360 - 00:36:34.540, Speaker B: Bankless has one trading chart show and we're dumping.
00:36:35.520 - 00:36:45.628, Speaker A: Is this most like another analogous year? Is this like 2019? Yeah, we're not like 2020. What year is it compared to the last cycle?
00:36:45.724 - 00:36:46.732, Speaker C: Like I said, I don't.
00:36:46.796 - 00:36:48.156, Speaker B: May 2019.
00:36:48.348 - 00:37:07.050, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a lot of uncertainty. Will ethereum be illegal? Will bitcoin be disavowed? Who's going to ban it? Is the US. The new China. That's a good question.
00:37:08.780 - 00:37:09.144, Speaker B: Actually.
00:37:09.182 - 00:37:30.910, Speaker C: That obviously puts pressure on asset prices. But China banned bitcoin all through 2017 as well, and the US bought it. And now what if the US just keeps banning stuff? The CFTC or the SEC or the FTC or the FAA? I don't care.
00:37:34.100 - 00:37:46.324, Speaker A: On that for a moment. There's two things that have actually surprised me about the kind of the year regulatory backlash, which you've really had. Number one, that we haven't dumped harder with bitcoin ETH Price. That's surprising in and of itself.
00:37:46.362 - 00:37:47.396, Speaker C: Everything blew up.
00:37:47.498 - 00:37:47.908, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:47.994 - 00:37:53.444, Speaker C: But also only was on last week. Tonight with John Oliver the other day.
00:37:53.642 - 00:37:58.436, Speaker A: I saw that, by the way. I should have reached out and congratulated you guys. It was for the no, I was.
00:37:58.458 - 00:38:00.410, Speaker C: Like, how bad did he talk about?
00:38:01.580 - 00:38:02.216, Speaker A: Not at all.
00:38:02.238 - 00:38:06.072, Speaker C: Did he make fun of Up Only or just make fun of Doequat? I'm not sure which.
00:38:06.126 - 00:38:17.864, Speaker A: It was John Oliver's segment. He had his kind of, like, 25 minutes segment, and he was crypto is a failed experiment. Yeah, smashing crypto, but with justifiable reason. Because he brought Terra centralized.
00:38:17.912 - 00:38:19.352, Speaker C: Crypto was a failed experiment.
00:38:19.416 - 00:38:33.840, Speaker A: Alex Machinsky with his, like, banks are not your friend shirt. It was all of the hits, basically all the 2023 hits. And they showed a clip from Up Only where Do Kwan came on one of Your lives in between. And Martin.
00:38:34.180 - 00:38:36.980, Speaker B: Right. Martin Screlli told him the joke so bad.
00:38:37.050 - 00:39:06.376, Speaker A: Yeah, that made okay, back to the regulatory point. Surprised we haven't gone down more. I'm also surprised. The reason I don't think the US will go all out ban I know we're talking about a fundamentals here and it's trading price podcast, but the reason I don't think they'll go to all out banner Congress, this is a trade. Okay. Did you see the sessions with Gensler getting grilled in front of Congress?
00:39:06.488 - 00:39:11.580, Speaker C: Actually, I saw his talk where he said two thirds of the market are not securities.
00:39:11.740 - 00:39:24.036, Speaker A: Crypto has more friends, I think, in Congress than I previously thought. It was actually pretty astounding. That was actually a bullish take on the event of, like I'm going to.
00:39:24.058 - 00:39:47.748, Speaker C: Call out a couple of them. I hate how freaking, what do you call it? Polarized or like partisan. It's getting yeah, because I don't think crypto is a partisan thing. But there were like Tom Emmer and Loomis and but there were a bunch of people that we didn't know as well then either that I'm looking for their names right now. Patrick, was it?
00:39:47.774 - 00:39:48.984, Speaker A: Patrick McHenry.
00:39:49.112 - 00:40:17.504, Speaker C: Warren Davidson and Patrick McHenry. Tom Emmer. Warren Davidson. Patrick McHenry. And I said they stood up for American companies trying to operate within the crypto ecosystem in good faith, but lack good faith guidance from our own regulators. And then you look at Gary Gensler's comments as an instructor versus as the chair of the SEC, and he contradicts his own self badly when he was an instructor. This was Brian Armstrong tweeted this yesterday.
00:40:17.504 - 00:40:27.060, Speaker C: It's a video of him saying two thirds of the market are not securities, or something like that. And then now his comments are nothing but bitcoin is a commodity.
00:40:28.540 - 00:40:37.688, Speaker B: My explanation for that was that his pivot is just clear because he started being paid by the banking sector in some backhanded deal.
00:40:37.854 - 00:40:40.284, Speaker C: I have no idea. I'm not going to take the word.
00:40:40.322 - 00:41:01.712, Speaker B: Obviously that's a complete conspiracy. But something about Gary Gensler just did a complete pivot. The show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome. I don't know where the incentive came from, but I know what the outcome is. Which the outcome is, like, Gary Gensler is here to kill crypto to the best of his ability. So there's an incentive there somewhere. I think it used to.
00:41:01.766 - 00:41:10.644, Speaker A: It could just be part of Operation Choke Point, like the members of government executive branch, elizabeth Warren, whoever just said.
00:41:10.682 - 00:41:27.320, Speaker C: Hey, I'd just like to say, whichever whale is watching this show and counter trading me right now by selling everything they own when I talk about it being the best asset in the world, if you could please freaking stop. People are upset at me and I'm blaming this market dump on bankless podcast and my own.
00:41:27.390 - 00:41:35.212, Speaker B: Oh, wow, we are still going down. Okay, so we started the podcast. Bitcoin was $29,700 and now we are down to 20. Literally thousand dollars.
00:41:35.346 - 00:41:40.430, Speaker C: I started talking at 1940 and we're at 1830. Wow.
00:41:41.840 - 00:41:42.590, Speaker B: Okay.
00:41:43.520 - 00:41:48.512, Speaker C: This is Kobe dumping everything he owns right now. So that's my conspiracy theory of the day.
00:41:48.566 - 00:41:49.312, Speaker B: Just because.
00:41:49.446 - 00:41:52.930, Speaker C: All right. No, just because he's going to counter trade me as much as possible.
00:41:54.420 - 00:42:44.764, Speaker B: Can you open up that tweet that I just sent into Zoom Chat here? I don't know how legitimate this is, but I want to get your take on this as a trader. This is Andrew King tweeting out what could just be a great viral tweet, but he tweets out when the market sells off for what seems like no particular reason. And this is after the move from Ether at $2,100 down to like 1800, where we basically are right now. Andrew Kang tweets out when a market sells off for what seems like no particular reason. One can either assume that one, the trend has been exhausted and a larger, longer correction is on the horizon, which is like the call for a mid year bull trap or two. Someone knows something and then he follows that tweet up with a hash which is basically him timestamping a secret. So Brian, I just want to get your take on this tweet.
00:42:44.764 - 00:42:55.690, Speaker B: There's like this weird shift in price action ever since Ether broke 2000 and Bitcoin broke 30,000, that all of a sudden things just dump now. So I wanted to get your perspective here.
00:42:56.380 - 00:43:27.436, Speaker C: I don't really care. It's too short. Like Andrew is know millions of dollars on GMX and sometimes he's up millions and sometimes he's down millions and he's trading this crap. And this is absolute in my mind, the noise and not the signal. The signal is what's happening on weekly time frames. And monthly time frames like charts are very valuable. I'm on here to talk about charts.
00:43:27.436 - 00:43:29.410, Speaker C: This is the chart I care about.
00:43:30.100 - 00:43:35.104, Speaker B: When you trade, what time frames are your candle? This one the weekly time frame.
00:43:35.152 - 00:43:35.856, Speaker C: Daily and weekly.
00:43:35.888 - 00:43:39.312, Speaker A: One week ETH to dollars. Is this weekly?
00:43:39.456 - 00:44:35.530, Speaker C: Yeah. When the market is going like parabolic, yeah. Put me on an hourly chart and I'm going to rotate a two X in a shitcoin to another shitcoin and try to two X that. But when I'm talking about where do I want my value, my worth and my allocation, I only care about this. Do I need dollars? Do I need crypto? Do I need hard assets or oil or gold or somebody's dollar milkshake? What's the important stuff? And in my mind right now, inflation is not under control. We may have a deflationary shock, but we're still printing money. We unwound half of the tightening that we did in like two days of crappy bank failures and Federal Reserve failures to control the situation.
00:44:35.530 - 00:44:42.420, Speaker C: And they tried to blame crypto because they know that they are totally screwed unless they find a scapegoat.
00:44:42.580 - 00:44:43.290, Speaker B: Right.
00:44:43.900 - 00:45:04.972, Speaker C: That's my personal opinion. I don't want First Republic Bank shares. They just went down like 50% yesterday because they're like, oh yeah, we still suck like silvergate and Stargate press release. Yeah, whatever. All those banks are like signature and all them Stargate.
00:45:05.036 - 00:45:05.808, Speaker B: I want to put my money in.
00:45:05.814 - 00:45:20.004, Speaker C: A big fan of Stargate. Well, there's a stargate. I'm an investor. Sorry, I slip. Freudian slip. That's the layer zero. I know you don't like the naming conflict there, but layer zero and Stargate are a thing that's a messaging protocol between things.
00:45:20.004 - 00:45:21.536, Speaker C: So sorry, I didn't mean to say that's.
00:45:21.568 - 00:45:22.004, Speaker A: Great.
00:45:22.122 - 00:46:00.288, Speaker C: Silvergate and Signature and Silicon Valley and First Republic, they have all these unsecured deposits over two hundred and fifty k and they're losing their deposits because people do not trust their money in those institutions. Right. I do trust that my ethereum is my ethereum. I trust that my bitcoin is my bitcoin. They are worried about that stuff because if people lose trust in that, they lose trust in dollar hegemony and all that kind of crap that bitcoin Maxis talk about for years and years.
00:46:00.454 - 00:46:01.072, Speaker A: Right.
00:46:01.206 - 00:46:31.420, Speaker C: And I think those are real arguments. And when you have periods of fear and concern and you start questioning is a bank run possible? No, as long as it's Morgan. And the US just says we'll keep printing to make it work. That's what they're doing. We will backstop the biggest banks. The rest can just go suck it up. Right, sorry.
00:46:31.420 - 00:46:45.128, Speaker C: If you're a bondholder of a mid sized bank in South Dakota, right, tough luck, get your money out. Why would you want money in anything but Morgan Chase?
00:46:45.304 - 00:46:48.976, Speaker B: Damn lecturer's coming to slay some people today, man.
00:46:49.078 - 00:47:07.460, Speaker C: But this is the truth is we have fragility in our banking system and they're all complaining about the fragility of scammers in crypto. They cannot make that argument about decentralized protocols and products that are built on sound principles.
00:47:09.000 - 00:47:10.740, Speaker B: We're 100% aligned on that.
00:47:10.890 - 00:47:12.356, Speaker A: I know, but that's what that connection.
00:47:12.388 - 00:47:14.312, Speaker C: The prices are reflecting it.
00:47:14.446 - 00:47:37.296, Speaker B: Right, okay. And that's what I want to make that connection is like how that relates to this chart here, but there's a ton more that yeah, sorry, this is great. This is my other assets I want to talk to, but we have to immediately cut to sponsors to talk about all these ways that immediately cut to the sponsors that make this show.
00:47:37.318 - 00:47:38.944, Speaker C: All right, you got me fired up, man.
00:47:39.142 - 00:47:45.236, Speaker B: You are fired up. And I want some more of that. We'll get right back to some shitcoins right after this.
00:47:45.418 - 00:48:29.628, Speaker D: Learning about crypto is hard until now.

00:49:33.188 - 00:50:05.644, Speaker D: The phantom wallet is coming to Ethereum. The number one wallet on Salana is bringing its millions of users and beloved UX to Ethereum and polygon. If you haven't used Phantom before, you've been missing out. Phantom was one of the first wallets to pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for Ethereum and polygon. But that's just staking. Phantom is also the best home for your NFTs. Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your NFT experience, pin your favorites, hide your Uglies, burn the spam, and also manage your NFT sale listings from inside the wallet.
00:50:05.644 - 00:50:26.336, Speaker D: Phantom is of course, a MultiChain wallet, but it makes chain management easy, displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or phishing websites. Phantom has already saved over 20,000 users from getting scammed or hacked. So get on the Phantom Waitlist and be one of the first to access the MultiChain beta. There's a link in the show notes, or you can go to Phantom app.
00:50:26.458 - 00:50:46.488, Speaker B: Waitlist to get access in late February, Bankless Nation, we are back with Ledger, who has just been some hot fire lately, and it's been a while since you've been doing some podcast, Ledger, because you had an emergency removal of an appendix. Congratulations on that, I guess, for an appendix.
00:50:46.584 - 00:51:00.560, Speaker C: Yeah, I found out yesterday it actually had ruptured, and I didn't know that. I had to get it all removed and then my gut was rotten, so I had a couple of weeks in the hospital. Or a couple of weeks with multiple trips to the hospital.
00:51:01.700 - 00:51:02.720, Speaker A: That's painful.
00:51:03.140 - 00:51:05.116, Speaker B: David coming out of letter.
00:51:05.148 - 00:51:06.364, Speaker A: I do still have your appendix.
00:51:06.412 - 00:51:06.672, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:06.726 - 00:51:06.944, Speaker A: Okay.
00:51:06.982 - 00:51:07.884, Speaker C: Congratulations.
00:51:08.012 - 00:51:09.796, Speaker A: I'm gone. No appendix, man.
00:51:09.978 - 00:51:10.436, Speaker C: Oh, wow.
00:51:10.458 - 00:51:12.116, Speaker B: I'm the only one. You don't need one on the show right now.
00:51:12.138 - 00:51:13.110, Speaker A: You don't need it.
00:51:13.720 - 00:51:20.600, Speaker C: I'm not going to gross you all out with some of the stuff I learned. Not having your appendix is kind of bullish.
00:51:25.180 - 00:51:27.080, Speaker B: I'm kind of scared to ask why.
00:51:27.150 - 00:51:30.632, Speaker C: You don't want to ask. Any more follow ups like we're going to lose all your listeners.
00:51:30.696 - 00:51:32.924, Speaker A: It's an optional organ, David. You don't need it.
00:51:32.962 - 00:51:36.524, Speaker C: I know that. I'll explain what I learned later.
00:51:36.722 - 00:51:37.470, Speaker B: Okay.
00:51:38.160 - 00:51:43.376, Speaker C: Chad GPT told me the answer to what an appendix is used for. So we'll talk about oh, I know.
00:51:43.398 - 00:51:44.784, Speaker B: What an appendix is used for.
00:51:44.902 - 00:51:45.570, Speaker C: What?
00:51:46.580 - 00:51:58.304, Speaker B: It is a store of bacteria in case your colons just get absolutely wrecked from infection. It is a nice little warehouse of bacteria to restore your gut microbiome.
00:51:58.432 - 00:52:15.336, Speaker C: Yeah. Have you ever played organ trail? When they die dysentery because they can't coat themselves in good bacteria and then they start consuming bad bacteria again. And so then they're in trouble if they don't have their appendix to serve that function.
00:52:15.438 - 00:52:21.836, Speaker A: Wait, your appendix is just a side chain colon? Is that you're telling me we're going.
00:52:21.858 - 00:52:48.660, Speaker C: Down this rabbit hole? It means if you lose your appendix, it's because you weren't using it very often, which means your bowels do not drain themselves out because you died in Organ trail. So you live in a modern society and in a modern society where you're not completely emptied out, then you don't use your appendix and it gets a little rusty and it can't handle it, and it just overflows with death because it's not being utilized well enough.
00:52:48.810 - 00:52:52.070, Speaker B: This is quite possibly the most bearish content.
00:52:56.200 - 00:52:57.430, Speaker A: I was interested.
00:52:58.760 - 00:53:07.908, Speaker C: Told you I wasn't going to do it. This is what you do at a bankless. Meetup with, like, three beers in you. Not when you're sober. On effect 02:00 in the afternoon.
00:53:08.004 - 00:53:12.380, Speaker B: We're going to get the Clip team to make a clip out of this and share this on Twitter with any.
00:53:12.450 - 00:53:19.708, Speaker C: Context about why we're doing this in a pin. Dex, this is just decentralized trading content.
00:53:19.794 - 00:53:20.524, Speaker A: Nice.
00:53:20.722 - 00:53:25.520, Speaker B: God, I don't know if I want to continue this. Let's get back to the charts.
00:53:26.180 - 00:53:26.992, Speaker C: Let's do that.
00:53:27.046 - 00:53:27.264, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:27.302 - 00:53:30.092, Speaker B: Can I get you to pull up some alt layer ones? Can we look at solana?
00:53:30.236 - 00:53:33.104, Speaker C: Oh, I love Solana. Relative to what?
00:53:33.142 - 00:53:42.790, Speaker B: Solana chart. I just want you to pull up. I want you to treat I'll tell you the test where you look at the shape of the line and you tell me how you feel about it.
00:53:43.800 - 00:54:07.992, Speaker C: I'm going to take you to I don't have sol ETH, but I have solusd and solusd. It's like this is what I would call let me see if I have them. Yeah. There we go. A bunch of lines. This is the SBF $3 kind of range bounce. That's the Destiny chart.
00:54:07.992 - 00:54:52.430, Speaker C: In the worst possible case scenario, they actually have done some really cool stuff. So what they haven't been able to get into is this kind of bear market range that Solana Maxis would have loved to be the bottom, but then SBF happened and FTX failure happened and it was like, yeah, lol. No, these coins are gone because our cost basis is like eleven or something like that. So we're still totally fine. Dumping on your face at $10 so that we don't go bankrupt as a firm or as a hedge fund or as a whatever. So it went to $10 and now it's like at 20. Okay, two X, that blah whatever.
00:54:52.430 - 00:55:21.376, Speaker C: Can it get back into the previous range, the 25 to 50? The one where salana people don't feel like they're dying? This is ethereum $40 or not 40. This is ethereum, like 100 plus. And salana $10 is ethereum $100 and $8. Salana was ethereum $80. Ethereum is going back to $15 where it was when it went on Coinbase. I don't think that's going to happen. But this isn't a good chart.
00:55:21.376 - 00:55:37.560, Speaker C: It's not a chart where I'm just like, you know what? That's what I want to own. Unless I think it can go from $25 to $50. And I'll disclose, I do have a little, like, long, long term salana. Not a meaningful amount, but salana owned for a long time and didn't sell that portion.
00:55:38.060 - 00:55:44.904, Speaker B: If I asked you to look at other alt layer ones, would you more or less give me, like, a similar story, maybe worse?
00:55:44.952 - 00:56:27.720, Speaker C: I think salana actually has a chance to ethereum itself. I think the monetary principles of salana are just as bad as ethereum's were in 2018. There's still a lot of inflation, there's still a lot of centralization, but only on salana is a great narrative. Only possible on salana. The Salana phone I'll disclose, too. He told me he was going to send me a phone. I haven't gotten it yet, but his challenge was use it for a week and see what and like, I was like, yeah, man, that's like, if I can do crypto on my phone and get out of the Apple ecosystem of absolute anti crypto trash other than maybe Steve Jobs with Satoshi.
00:56:27.720 - 00:56:31.464, Speaker C: Did y'all see that? The white paper on macOS.
00:56:31.512 - 00:56:32.668, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw that.
00:56:32.834 - 00:57:05.448, Speaker C: But anyway, I think that's amazing. I think salana, if salana could be the Third Avenue, right, like the bitcoin the ethereum, the salana achieve network effects that have power and then they can fix the things that are wrong. Ethereum sucked in 2017. It was an ICO hosting platform. And now you have Ave and you have uniswap what did it hit? $1.5 trillion of transaction volume. That stuff is amazing.
00:57:05.448 - 00:57:12.760, Speaker C: Ethereum is money. Ethereum is principally sound, even if chaotic.
00:57:13.500 - 00:57:17.748, Speaker A: So you think it has a chance to be that third thing?
00:57:17.934 - 00:57:18.872, Speaker C: Without a doubt.
00:57:18.936 - 00:57:23.724, Speaker A: And would you put any other alternative layer one in the running for that?
00:57:23.842 - 00:57:27.244, Speaker C: No. Which ones would I?
00:57:27.362 - 00:57:31.872, Speaker A: Cosmos maybe tech is good. Basket of it.
00:57:32.006 - 00:57:34.240, Speaker B: Adam is tech is good, money is bad.
00:57:34.390 - 00:57:34.752, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:34.806 - 00:57:52.076, Speaker C: And it's also a cathedral. Salana is kind of a bizarre, like the same way that Ethereum was. It was a little bit cathedral who was building on it, but now they got thousands of people building on it in an absolutely chaotic way, the way that Ethereum was in 2018.
00:57:52.108 - 00:58:04.728, Speaker A: But what does something like even salana against bitcoin and ETH? Because to the point, in the first part of this episode, you're saying the only two assets, it's a two horse race, is Ethan bitcoin. I don't care about anything else at this phase of the market.
00:58:04.814 - 00:58:15.192, Speaker C: I don't. Blue chips. Look where it is. Look at what I'm looking at. Sole BTC is not something I want to not. I'm talking about the fundamental case. This is where I talk about that fundamental and then the trade.
00:58:15.192 - 00:58:27.730, Speaker C: The trade is not there for Solana. The fundamental case, I think, might be building, but I don't like maybe it's not until it goes down to here. Right.
00:58:29.060 - 00:58:35.156, Speaker B: If you said ledger is pointing to something that's like down 60%, I'm not.
00:58:35.178 - 00:58:38.612, Speaker A: Familiar with these numbers here. The ratio of sold to bitcoin here.
00:58:38.666 - 00:58:48.570, Speaker C: That'S a 50% dump relative to bitcoin. So if bitcoin goes to 40 or Salana stays at $20.
00:58:51.340 - 00:58:59.144, Speaker B: We got some comments in the chat saying you guys are completely discounting cardano and ripple. Yes, we are doing that.
00:58:59.342 - 00:59:20.848, Speaker C: I'll take that one to the grave. I don't have to own it. You don't have to own everything. Why would you want to own everything? Take concentrated bets and believe in them. And I see a world. This is like a banana parabolic down move relative to bitcoin. That's not pretty.
00:59:20.934 - 00:59:22.636, Speaker B: As in it accelerates.
00:59:22.828 - 00:59:28.630, Speaker C: Yeah, it's sloping more down the longer you go and it's not great.
00:59:31.000 - 00:59:40.632, Speaker A: Do you think that this changes at any point? Right? Or when does this change? Will we feel the phase shift of the market?
00:59:40.766 - 00:59:44.730, Speaker C: Okay, you won't be first, but you don't have to be last.
00:59:45.100 - 00:59:57.708, Speaker A: Okay, so this is an era, you're saying, where we've just got ETH and bitcoin, they're going to outperform everything. So you don't think it's worth owning anything relative to them, but that will change at some point, 100%.
00:59:57.794 - 01:00:05.596, Speaker C: And that's when you're ready to take your incredible buying power of Ethereum and bitcoin and deploy. And deploy.
01:00:05.628 - 01:00:06.720, Speaker B: It go down.
01:00:06.790 - 01:00:10.450, Speaker A: Zach, how will you know when it's time?
01:00:11.780 - 01:00:31.610, Speaker C: Let's go back to principles. Right of trading. This is a 20 week moving average. It's getting pounded by the top side. The 20 week moving average, which is five months, is an absolute ceiling. It cannot get above four to five month a quarterly price.
01:00:32.540 - 01:00:47.980, Speaker B: Just to pick this for the podcast listeners, the Solana chart, all the candles, the green candles, the red channels are going down into the right. There's a white line above all the candles. And anytime the candle touches and pounds into the ceiling. Anytime it touches the white line, it plummets.
01:00:49.600 - 01:01:23.272, Speaker C: That's the same thing bitcoin did from twenty k to three k. I'm going to go look at it real quick. This is what I use charts for, and it's taken me some time to just know you don't have to be there. Okay, this is Bitcoin after it went to $20,000 in 2017. This is that same moving average. It doesn't really matter what you're using, but this, just imagine it as like a quarterly price almost, or a one third of the year. It couldn't get above that.
01:01:23.272 - 01:01:57.632, Speaker C: Got slammed by it six k. It was sitting at it, and it got decimated to a four year average price when it finally broke down. Salon is not even four years old. It doesn't even have the green line. But when am I interested? Turn it. Tell me that the price can get above the average price of the last one third or one quarter of a year and show some support. But that takes the way you guys were in ethereum land in 2017 and 2018 and 2019.
01:01:57.632 - 01:02:25.804, Speaker C: Believers. It's believers in salana. And salana has thousands of believers that need to absorb those coins and show that it can bottom relative to bitcoin. That's not even relative to dollar, right? That's relative to bitcoin. And then I'll say, okay, I will take some precious bitcoin or some precious ethereum and I'm going to put some of it into salana. I don't care if the price of salana is $20 or $100. I don't care.
01:02:25.804 - 01:03:16.488, Speaker C: I care what it is relative to my current established buying power of the two most powerful assets in the world. That's what I care about. Can I buy 20 salana or 100 salana or whatever it is for every ethereum that I deploy into it? I don't know what the ratio is, but if I can, as long as the trend has flipped, then I will earn more relative ethereum because the price of salana went up. And then someday maybe I'm actually going to want to hold salana even through a bear market. Not all of it. If I have 100 salana, I might hold ten through whatever price it goes to next. And I sold 90% of it with relative buying power and put it away for the home team because I want to retire someday.
01:03:16.488 - 01:03:22.988, Speaker C: You know what I mean? That's the trading component of this broader fundamental narrative.
01:03:23.084 - 01:03:29.292, Speaker A: And you think that what's really important here is this moving average here, it's just trend trading.
01:03:29.356 - 01:03:45.704, Speaker C: It's just saying trading. Trend trading based on a quarterly price average or something ish 20 weeks versus 201 10th of the time frame is faster than the four year time frame. That's all that means. And 200.
01:03:45.822 - 01:03:54.484, Speaker A: When do you think that happens? Are you just looking the charts and watching for kind of the trend to switch or you have no idea whether that the dollar.
01:03:54.532 - 01:03:59.988, Speaker C: Version of it says it's okay to hold right now. David, you're muted maybe on purpose.
01:04:00.164 - 01:04:12.430, Speaker B: Yeah, it's probably good. This is why we bring ledger on every six months, because I feel like within six months, at some point, I'm just waiting for him to tell me, like, oh yeah, bye bye. Bye bye. It happened three months ago.
01:04:12.960 - 01:04:19.408, Speaker C: It had a chance, literally relative to the dollar, right. In 2022. And then FTX failed and it went to zero.
01:04:19.494 - 01:04:20.130, Speaker A: Right.
01:04:21.380 - 01:04:23.476, Speaker B: Do you guys want to know why we're dumping right now?
01:04:23.578 - 01:04:24.230, Speaker C: Why?
01:04:25.560 - 01:04:33.588, Speaker B: Here, I'll just send you a Tweet ledger. Mount Gox and government wallets have started making transactions, so Mount Gox bitcoins are.
01:04:33.594 - 01:04:38.520, Speaker C: On the okay, so it's not my fault I'm blaming carpelli's.
01:04:42.700 - 01:04:50.410, Speaker B: So I don't know if that's actually meaning things are actually being sold into the market or traders are just selling because of fear of others.
01:04:50.780 - 01:05:15.250, Speaker C: I'm sure it's both, but this is where other people can shine. Like, they can sit there on the hourly chart. Mount Gox coins will be absorbed. Those are massive w's by people that were into crypto way before us. And even though they lost 80% of their coins, they still like 100 X. Right? That's the best force hold ever unless you sold your claims and never got them. And by the way, that's where salana people are now.
01:05:15.250 - 01:05:35.076, Speaker C: Salana people have their coins locked in FTX and they're selling their claims for $0.20 on the dollar. What if salana goes to $200 again and it ten X's and they're crying and they're gone and they're, like, running a food truck now because they don't believe in crypto and instead they could have ten X from here trading on Kyle Davis.
01:05:35.108 - 01:05:36.708, Speaker B: That is sus exchange.
01:05:36.804 - 01:05:47.740, Speaker A: I'm sure that's probably someone's specific story of I feel bad saying that, but there's one guy who heard that and felt personally attacked.
01:05:48.880 - 01:05:54.480, Speaker C: Can I ask you I've been there, man. Not at the food trucks, but down bad. It's how it goes.
01:05:54.550 - 01:06:22.264, Speaker A: A rite of passage. This entire episode on trading and prices, we haven't yet once mentioned macro and the R word of recession or anything else. Does that factor into your analysis at all? Are you just like, it's too much? I can't even factor that into the model, so I just ignore it because I know some kind of crypto traders who are just like, I don't pay attention to macro because no one actually knows what's going to happen. What's your take on this?
01:06:22.382 - 01:06:51.410, Speaker C: I think we're kind of at an inflection point. If you just look at the dollar, the Dixie relative to other stuff, but all these currencies suck. The dollar could bounce heavily if you're just looking at a chart, a chart is a chart is a chart. Josh Olswitch 2017 and put me on a deserted island. I'll look at the chart and I'll tell you what I'll do. Sometimes I'll be right, sometimes I'll be wrong. But hopefully 60% of the time I'm right, and therefore I win.
01:06:51.410 - 01:07:22.876, Speaker C: I'm allowed to be wrong. I'm allowed to get it wrong. I'm allowed to not understand. But I'll look at the chart in isolation and make the call. Lacking fundamentals. My value add is, can I look at the fundamentals and then take the same exact strategy? And that way I'm not trading, like, doge, PayPay, taco, coin, and instead I'm trading ethereum, right? Like the easiest win of all time. PayPal, coin, zero.
01:07:22.876 - 01:07:32.380, Speaker C: Ethereum. Not zero in the future in the long run. I once traded Bed, Bath and beyond and ten X. My money on Bed, Bath and beyond stock.
01:07:33.440 - 01:07:35.696, Speaker A: Were you bullish on fundamentals, sir, or.
01:07:35.718 - 01:07:51.252, Speaker C: Is this just they had a billion dollars in the bank at the time. Since then, that was more than the valuation of the stock. They owned their own real estate. And I was like, this store sucks. People go here in August when they're about to go to college, and then they go there.
01:07:51.306 - 01:07:52.736, Speaker B: I've been to Bed, Bath and beyond.
01:07:52.848 - 01:08:25.436, Speaker C: I know you'll go again when you have a baby, but it won't be owned by them because it'll be owned by someone that bought the bankruptcy assets for pennies on the dollar. But the chart of this a chart of this a chart. And I ten X. My money on Bed to Bath and beyond. A small amount of money that turned into a reasonable amount of money. And I did nothing but trade that for 2019, because guess what? Crypto wasn't worth trading. And that chart was like and everybody was like, this company is going bankrupt.
01:08:25.436 - 01:08:54.810, Speaker C: And I was like, yes, they are, but not yet, and now they're bankrupt. I haven't traded it since it became a meme stock. Once it became a meme stock, I was definitely no longer interested. But I turned a few thousand dollars into a few tens of thousands of dollars doing it. And then I turned a few tens of thousands of dollars into E and GBTC when the market was doing well. And now my IRA is worth a little bit of money, and that's pretty freaking awesome. And it started at, like, nothing.
01:08:56.700 - 01:08:57.852, Speaker A: And that's all.
01:08:57.986 - 01:08:59.630, Speaker B: I have further questions.
01:09:00.080 - 01:09:00.684, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:09:00.802 - 01:09:33.140, Speaker C: This is an honesty episode, right, where I'm coming out firing it's tax protection, a new man. I won't touch it until I'm 65 years old. And it's not like the majority. Like, I own a home, and I have a couple of other available assets. It's not going to change my life in the near term. But the fact that you turn something from your first job into six figures or something like that because you traded Bed, Bath and beyond stock in a tax protected account is pretty funny.
01:09:34.680 - 01:09:40.644, Speaker A: Great story. All right, well, David, do you have any other questions about charts, prices?
01:09:40.692 - 01:09:43.128, Speaker B: Because I want to ask not about charts, no.
01:09:43.214 - 01:09:53.790, Speaker A: What are you doing these days? Ledger. So is it like 2019 where crypto is super boring and you got bitcoin, but you're waiting for things to happen, so why trade? So what are you spending your time doing?
01:09:54.160 - 01:09:54.908, Speaker B: Building.
01:09:55.074 - 01:09:57.260, Speaker C: Never been I'm biddling.
01:09:57.680 - 01:09:58.744, Speaker B: You want to pull up Flip?
01:09:58.792 - 01:09:59.340, Speaker C: What is this?
01:09:59.410 - 01:09:59.940, Speaker A: Flip.
01:10:00.040 - 01:10:01.436, Speaker C: Flip XYZ.
01:10:01.628 - 01:10:29.690, Speaker B: This isn't just Brian. I want to actually give this take this take out there. Sometimes when the charts are not conducive to trades, sometimes when the markets aren't ready, the option to build a company and invest in private markets by building stuff is actually the best ROI on your time. And so, Brian, what are you building these days?
01:10:30.780 - 01:10:48.568, Speaker C: I'm trying to not DOX everything, but also show you Flip. We're releasing this coming week the best in class OTC trading platform for NFTs.
01:10:48.584 - 01:10:50.904, Speaker B: Wait. First, what is flip?
01:10:50.952 - 01:10:54.972, Speaker C: Flip XYZ. If you go to Flip XYZ, let me show it. Yeah.
01:10:55.106 - 01:10:56.524, Speaker B: You want me to pull up?
01:10:56.722 - 01:10:58.064, Speaker C: I was trying to pull up what we're doing.
01:10:58.102 - 01:10:59.136, Speaker A: You got the screen?
01:10:59.318 - 01:11:01.632, Speaker C: Yeah, I was trying to show you what we're doing next.
01:11:01.686 - 01:11:04.656, Speaker A: You've got a next thing after Flip XYZ?
01:11:04.768 - 01:11:23.176, Speaker C: No, this is what people see on Flip today. Okay, so this is just JPEGs. Love JPEGs. But this is sharecorns with charts, with images. Yeah, well, not all of them. I am my pudgy, and my pudgy is me. But most of these are going to zero.
01:11:23.176 - 01:12:05.344, Speaker C: Right. But there's incredible utility in some stuff as well. I'm a huge believer in ENS. I absolutely love ENS, own tons of them, own stuff that I think is worth millions of dollars, but nobody else believes it yet. But I'll just sit there and hold it until somebody else decides they want to name their child after their ENS or like a sports team or whatever is going to needs to own that ENS. And there's incredible profile utility in that. But today, at this moment, you say, you just sold me and I'm going to go buy these ENS.
01:12:05.344 - 01:12:18.490, Speaker C: So we enable trading and sweeping and all the same things that you see on Jim and Genie and Blur or wherever else. And it's pretty darn cool. I can't show you because it'll DOX me real.
01:12:20.380 - 01:12:22.860, Speaker B: Oh, just DOX your wallet. I see.
01:12:23.010 - 01:12:23.276, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:12:23.298 - 01:13:02.068, Speaker C: So I have six wallets connected to my Flip account because we have multi wallet, multi device, hardware wallet, hot wallet, mobile wallet, rainbow wallet, coinbase wallet, MetaMask, all connected to your Flip account. And you can view an aggregated view of your portfolio. You can sweep and shop and transfer between all of those. It's a incredible all in one solution for NFTs that also has this really impressive market data for any collection that you're interested in. Who's involved? Who are the top holders? What are they doing? What's the trait of these collections?
01:13:02.244 - 01:13:07.210, Speaker A: This is awesome, man. What's the team size behind who's building that?
01:13:07.760 - 01:13:31.808, Speaker C: We're very small. Yeah, we're a sub ten person team. Pretty good. Yeah. And it's really cool. Like, you can go search for dictionary words and I want to buy a top 5000 word. And you can go find out what those ENS words are or like here you go.
01:13:31.974 - 01:13:42.900, Speaker B: Can we determine what the top 1000 words are as valued by ENS names? Humans now finally can figure out what 100 words are.
01:13:43.050 - 01:14:00.000, Speaker C: Yeah, half an ETH. You can buy ether ETH for zero point 85 ETH. And you can buy it on Flip. It's a top 1000 word, 5000 word. It's a dictionary word. And then when you go to buy it, you can I don't know what this is. Let's go to I love how we're.
01:14:00.020 - 01:14:03.212, Speaker B: Just buying words now and not even thinking about it.
01:14:03.266 - 01:14:04.072, Speaker C: But domains.
01:14:04.136 - 01:14:05.630, Speaker A: We've been doing this for a while.
01:14:06.880 - 01:14:11.596, Speaker C: Thank you. This is literally domains. So I can buy this or never.
01:14:11.618 - 01:14:12.930, Speaker B: Had it phrased like that.
01:14:13.780 - 01:14:18.480, Speaker C: David ETH, is that a in?
01:14:18.550 - 01:14:35.380, Speaker B: He's in. Dave Dow. Shout out to the Dave Dow Telegram. At least I know a few of you guys are in here. Okay, by the way, if you are listening to this and your name is Dave, you are not here's the show, then you need to DM me right now so you can get into the Dave Dow Telegram.
01:14:35.720 - 01:14:37.088, Speaker C: The owner of Dave Dow.
01:14:37.184 - 01:14:39.092, Speaker B: Dave ETH is in the Dave Dow Telegram.
01:14:39.156 - 01:15:33.332, Speaker C: I don't know what that shill was about, but what I just did is I followed David ETH on Flip. So I can also put it in a I want to buy folder, or I can add new folders and then I say if it ever goes for sale, if it ever gets listed, canceled, transferred, and then also for ENS, show me renewal and expiration events, we'll send you a mobile notification that something happened with David ETH. So if your name is David and you want to own this, then you are not very smart if you're not subscribed to what's happening here. We show a history where somebody paid 32.8 E for this and they've held it since six ETH is back in whenever this was, March 2020. And you can go look at that and say, oh, that was on OpenSea. They have paid their royalties.
01:15:33.332 - 01:15:42.696, Speaker C: So we're very much in the royalty conversation. We want to be opinionated about that. If I go to latest live sale.
01:15:42.728 - 01:15:48.520, Speaker B: Can we move on from David ETH? Because I have just PTSD from not purchasing David ETH.
01:15:48.600 - 01:15:53.548, Speaker C: Yeah, it's fine. This is just the NFT market. So in the last minute people have.
01:15:53.634 - 01:15:58.076, Speaker B: Wait, can we go to Ryan ETH? What was the last price for Ryan ETH? Was it above or below? David ETH.
01:15:58.108 - 01:15:59.440, Speaker A: It's got to be above.
01:16:05.240 - 01:16:24.392, Speaker C: Let's see if we can find it as an asset, not as somebody's domain. He doesn't have Ryan ETH in this same thing because we're trying to search for it by I need to search for it somewhere else. But interesting, we'll solve that battle later. So I don't think he holds running this is awesome.
01:16:24.446 - 01:16:33.164, Speaker A: So you think JPEGs are coming back ledger? No, they're not. How about a new round of why are you building this?
01:16:33.362 - 01:17:13.320, Speaker C: Because this is not JPEGs. This is NFT infrastructure and NFTs are non fungible tokens on a blockchain. And we are really good at showing what's happening on an ethereum NFT and an EVM compatible NFT. In the future, somebody needs to come give us a lot of money and we'll build this and we'll put it on Arbitrum, and we'll put it on Optimism, and we'll put it on Avalanche, we'll put it on wherever you want to put it. That's very expensive to take a blockchain and then put it in a database. So, ethereum layer one. We are presenting the market in a way that we can present hey.
01:17:13.320 - 01:17:36.160, Speaker C: Unpaid paid partial royalties. What are the average royalties on Blur? What's the market share of Blur and Jim and OpenSea? What's going on with this NFT that I'm following? So the next thing I'm trying to show you without doxxing myself badly is I can't do it. This is doxx yourself.
01:17:36.230 - 01:17:36.800, Speaker A: It's okay.
01:17:36.870 - 01:18:08.696, Speaker C: I really can't. I want to be able to show you, essentially, my feed. So what we're releasing next week is I want to make you an offer. So what we have right now is we have some onboarding stuff and you can look at your points and you can get some of that stuff. What we're about to release is I want to make you let's see if I can do this without getting in trouble.
01:18:08.888 - 01:18:16.396, Speaker B: By the way, Ryan ryan ETH was bought for ten E four years ago and it has not moved since.
01:18:16.578 - 01:18:17.180, Speaker C: All right.
01:18:17.250 - 01:18:19.096, Speaker A: And what was David ETH?
01:18:19.288 - 01:18:25.648, Speaker B: 32 ETH, but it was bought in this last bull market. Hard to get price discovery on that one.
01:18:25.734 - 01:18:30.844, Speaker C: What is your thing? Trusting stake.
01:18:30.972 - 01:18:33.036, Speaker B: No. David Hoffman ETH.
01:18:33.228 - 01:18:41.250, Speaker C: Who's that? You don't have your primary DNS set.
01:18:41.960 - 01:18:43.030, Speaker B: Don't I?
01:18:43.480 - 01:18:47.496, Speaker C: No. You're called practical b on ours. You must not have you didn't let.
01:18:47.518 - 01:18:48.916, Speaker A: It expire, did you, David?
01:18:49.028 - 01:18:49.544, Speaker C: No.
01:18:49.662 - 01:18:51.576, Speaker A: You go to bankless ETH if you want.
01:18:51.678 - 01:18:52.840, Speaker C: Are these yours?
01:18:53.420 - 01:18:54.584, Speaker B: Yeah, that's on me.
01:18:54.702 - 01:19:15.900, Speaker C: Okay. So we're releasing this next week. So this is our OTC interface. That's awesome. I'm going to give you 0.1 E for this fair price for your crypto punk, David. I'm going to give you a rocker punk and zero one ETH.
01:19:16.500 - 01:19:18.016, Speaker B: You can bundle up a trade, I.
01:19:18.038 - 01:19:36.968, Speaker C: Can bundle up multi asset ETH. We whatever you want. This is not released yet. I'm probably in trouble right now. I'm going to send this to you multi asset, and then I'm going to propose this trade to you. I'd have to go approve a couple of things and all that. Sure.
01:19:36.968 - 01:20:17.392, Speaker C: It will send you a desktop notification that's in kind of a Tweet deck type format. It's going to send you a mobile notification. It's going to have a publicly shareable link that you can just view the trade proposal, I'm going to be able to send you a message that says, david, definitely accept this offer. And I say continue, and I'm going to approve my Wheath, which is going to pay the royalties for my side. So this is positive royalty. It's a trade interface. This is all in our staging development.
01:20:17.392 - 01:20:40.568, Speaker C: So I'm going to go away now before I make any really big mistakes. So I'm going to do all that, send it to you, and then you're going to choose whether you want to accept that deal or not. And what this does, here's what's cool about this. It's really awesome. It really prevents scamming. This is an approved wallet with an ENS attached to it. They've authenticated on flip.
01:20:40.568 - 01:21:13.830, Speaker C: They have a multi wallet portfolio on Flip and they can safely engage in this OTC trade that's built on top of Cport. It's just not OpenSea and hideous and whatever else. But we're using open technologies to build better interfaces and better tooling and we're supporting creators that we partner with. And we're looking for creators that want to work with us to be their official OTC platform to enable people following markets to say, I can't follow all this crap, but send me a notification when something cool happens on stuff I own.
01:21:14.280 - 01:21:15.030, Speaker B: Beautiful.
01:21:16.360 - 01:21:17.204, Speaker A: There you go.
01:21:17.322 - 01:21:31.140, Speaker B: That was a great it's testament to what you're building and also the way that you present it that not a single person dropped off the stream after going through all of that, going from charts to talk about Flip, we're still at 650 viewers.
01:21:31.220 - 01:21:31.524, Speaker C: Pleasure.
01:21:31.572 - 01:21:36.700, Speaker B: Thank you so much for coming on and helping us walk through this chart and also showing us your cool, spiffy new product.
01:21:36.850 - 01:22:14.984, Speaker C: I appreciate it. We've been around a while, but honestly, when there's no market, you're building a product for where you think the market is going to go. And I think JPEGs with altcoins, with pictures is really stupid. I think your punk or my Pudgy penguin is really cool. I also think ENS is really cool and I think NFTs are going to be used in incredible ways that we don't understand yet for ticketing and access and membership and gateways and things that actually matter, where you need non fungible tokens, not ERC 20s, but do not hold those JPEGs until you buying power.
01:22:15.102 - 01:22:20.876, Speaker A: Right now you want to hold Bitcoin and ETH is the message from Ledger, then you can buy the JPEGs later.
01:22:21.058 - 01:22:22.524, Speaker C: See, he gets it.
01:22:22.722 - 01:22:24.748, Speaker A: It's easy. It's so easy when you build the.
01:22:24.754 - 01:22:29.996, Speaker C: JPEG platforms and then buy the JPEGs later.
01:22:30.098 - 01:22:37.440, Speaker A: Master plan, guys. We hope you enjoyed that. Looking at prices today. Ledger, thanks for coming on, man. It's great. I love the energy.
01:22:37.590 - 01:22:39.888, Speaker C: Thank you so much. It's been a real pleasure to be here.
01:22:39.974 - 01:22:54.444, Speaker A: Look, we're excited to weather the rest of this bear market with you for however long it goes or however short it is, we don't know. Of course, none of this bankless listeners has been financial advice. Crypto is risky. So are all the tokens. You could definitely lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier.
01:22:54.444 - 01:23:02.100, Speaker A: It's not for everyone. This hasn't been financial advice, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot. Bye.
