00:00:07.770 - 00:00:27.014, Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, and how to front run the opportunity. I'm Ryan. Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman, and we're here to help you become more bankless. David, what an episode. Arthur Zero X.
00:00:27.014 - 00:00:28.598, Speaker A: What did we cover today?
00:00:28.764 - 00:01:17.458, Speaker B: We covered a little bit of everything, and we started off with the story of how Arthur Zero X and Defiance Capital came to be. And it's already one of my favorite stories in Defi, favorite stories in Ethereum. And it's something that I feel really passionate about, is that if you are coming into the space and you see things and you notice things and you start to execute on the things that you noticed, you too, just like Arthur Zerox, might be able to turn $100,000 into 100 million dollar plus fund, that option, and that choice is available to you if you have the grit and the patience and the foresight to be able to see the things that Arthur Zero X saw and why he was able to turn defiance capital into the gargantuan that it is in this space, we covered much more than that, and.
00:01:17.464 - 00:01:18.686, Speaker C: So I'll leave that to you, Ryan.
00:01:18.718 - 00:01:21.350, Speaker B: To explain to the listeners. But that was my favorite part.
00:01:21.500 - 00:02:02.510, Speaker A: Give that back to me. Yeah, look, man, it was my favorite part too. This story is amazing. Six figures to nine figures, right? And the thing I would add to that is you also have the grit to stick with this during a bear market. I think that's key. If you're looking for that, like, 50 x, 100 x type of return, you have to believe in something when no one else does, right? Right now, we're in a hotish, warmish bull market. It was not that way in 2018 when Arthur was growing up in DFI and when he was investing in things no one else was touching, these tokens were like, everyone hated tokens.
00:02:02.670 - 00:02:03.698, Speaker B: Tokens were out.
00:02:03.784 - 00:02:25.046, Speaker A: Tokens were totally out. Anyway, we covered that. That story is amazing. We talk about Defiance capital has focused on fundamentals, which is really cool to hear. Not just not narratives, not sentiment, but actual fundamentals of tokens and ignore the rest. Listener, that is an option for you. You don't have to go chase all of the narratives that you hear and see in crypto.
00:02:25.046 - 00:02:55.494, Speaker A: You could just focus on fundamentals. Refreshing. Hear that? We did an automated market maker comparison. Why are sushi and Uniswap valued differently? How about curve? How about Bancorp? How about balancer? Will one automated market maker win the network effect? Will there be many. We also talked about ETH killers. I will not give away Arthur's conclusion there, because I think he had some great conclusions. I even asked him if he had to pick one non Ethereum layer one, which would he be and why he answered that question.
00:02:55.494 - 00:03:26.062, Speaker A: Then we talked about, and concluded this with Defi from an asian perspective. So from the perspective of Asia, I should say. And Arthur had a great kind of, I guess, categorization of different areas in Asia that aren't like, jurisdiction based, but are more kind of cultural alignment that I think was super useful and will be useful to listeners as well. And of course, we concluded with price predictions because we just had to, because it's bankless and it's fun.
00:03:26.116 - 00:03:36.894, Speaker B: Well, we also concluded with what Arthur is really excited about towards the end of 2021. And he actually gave a really interesting answer. And, well, I'll tease it real quick.
00:03:36.932 - 00:03:38.654, Speaker C: Here, because it was actually the elaboration.
00:03:38.702 - 00:03:58.150, Speaker B: I think was the cool part. He thinks he's really excited for scale, as we all are. We've been beating the layer two summer drum here on bankless, but Arthur thinks that once we have scale, the floodgates for users just absolutely open. And so we dive into that a little bit as well towards the end of the conversation. But as a recap, that was the whole episode.
00:03:59.130 - 00:04:07.770, Speaker A: Really cool story, guys. You are going to enjoy this. So before we get into the episode, we want to thank the sponsors that made this possible.
00:04:07.920 - 00:04:14.906, Speaker C: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure.
00:04:15.018 - 00:04:16.942, Speaker B: Instead of a cumbersome order book system.
00:04:16.996 - 00:04:52.070, Speaker C: Where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while, and we'll say it again. Dows have money, and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap.
00:04:52.070 - 00:04:59.190, Speaker C: Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor.
00:04:59.270 - 00:05:00.986, Speaker B: Do you have something of value to.
00:05:01.008 - 00:05:39.506, Speaker C: Contribute to the Uniswap Dow? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a unigrant@unigrants.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go. That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you Uniswap for sponsoring bankless balancer is a powerful platform for flexible, automated market makers. Typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool, which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs. In Defi. With balancer, you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm, which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility.
00:05:39.506 - 00:05:41.686, Speaker C: This makes balancer an awesome building block.
00:05:41.718 - 00:05:43.478, Speaker B: For so many different use cases.
00:05:43.574 - 00:06:42.218, Speaker C: Balancer pools can make asset indices, but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers, balancer lets you collect the fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity. Additionally, balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules, such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools, which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity. At bankless, we use a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t shirts to much success. Balancer V two brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you. In V two, idle tokens are capable of generating yield in DFI without sacrificing liquidity in the pool using Balancer's asset managers. Balancer's vault architecture lets you trade between balancer pools at a fraction of the cost versus trading on other platforms. Balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in Defi by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange.
00:06:42.218 - 00:06:44.782, Speaker C: Dive into the balancer pools at app.
00:06:44.916 - 00:07:13.558, Speaker A: Balancer fi bankless nation. We are super excited about our next guest. Arthur Zero X is one of the most successful Defi investors in the entire crypto space. He runs Defiance Capital, which is the largest defi focused fund in Asia. He's based in Singapore, funded by tons of investors, maybe most notably by the three Arrows capital folks, Suzu and Kyle Davies. Arthur, we have so much to talk about, man. I'm glad you joined us today.
00:07:13.558 - 00:07:14.680, Speaker A: How are you doing?
00:07:15.530 - 00:07:21.030, Speaker D: I'm doing well. Been a listener of Bangladesh since day one, and it's my pleasure to be here.
00:07:21.180 - 00:07:53.394, Speaker A: That's awesome. Well, very cool. Well, we have been a follower of yours for a long time as well, and I want to kind of start with this story, which is kind of your story of getting into DFI and getting into crypto. I understand that you went full time into crypto in 2018, so lots of folks managing funds have been in crypto for longer. You tweeted this out, and I think this is incredible. 500,000,050k followers. What comes next? Five K-E-I hope so.
00:07:53.394 - 00:08:06.920, Speaker A: Maybe ten k e, but 500,000,050k followers, you started in crypto full time in 2018. That is incredible, man. That's an incredible story. How did that happen? Tell us.
00:08:07.870 - 00:08:53.174, Speaker D: Yeah, so it's a long story, but I think there's some useful takeaways, so I'll share a bit more. I started in the space in 2018. Initially, I want to run a crypto research startup, because I think initially when I came into the space, I realized that there's a lot of focus on the hype and the promises, but there is lack of focus on what's really happening and how to value this thing properly. So I initially want to run a crypto research startup, but I didn't find product market fit. So what happened is I decided to focus on investing instead. But that was the bear market. So 2018 bitcoin went to 3000.
00:08:53.174 - 00:09:30.654, Speaker D: If went to the lowest point, I think was 80 plus dollars. But I think during that period of time, I was always asking myself, so besides just trading and speculation, what other use case can we get from crypto? And coming from someone who went through the ICO bubble, I think that's very important, because during that period, everyone who have experienced it must have realized that we can literally see all the different use cases being experimented. Travel and A, B and B on blockchain, Spotify on blockchain, et cetera, et cetera.
00:09:30.702 - 00:09:31.970, Speaker B: Uber on the blockchain.
00:09:33.030 - 00:10:40.694, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. But I think none of them are really being realized or achieved in a major way except for financial use cases at the end of 2018. I think the first time I heard about DFI was in, I think, January 2019. But I know the term was coined in late 2018 by a group of early d five teams, such as, I think, the set protocol, dharma and a few others, they just joined together and say, why don't we create a term for this new movement? And then the term defi was born. And this is also part of the extension of my stablecoin thesis, because when I was helping some of the new crypto startup, initially, a lot of them want to introduce their own token as a payment mechanism, but it has shown not to be working well. In fact, it just doesn't work at all because nobody want to use a new token to pay for any services. People want to use a common currency in crypto world that will most likely be eth or bitcoin.
00:10:40.694 - 00:11:23.958, Speaker D: But right now I would say that stablecoin is actually the most suitable payment. Just the people want a stable unit account. And I think that time stablecoin just started to took off because bear market people want to find a safe haven and stablecoin become natural selection. And I think that being bullish on stablecoin also lead me to bullish on DeFi as well, because DeFI allow this whole exchange of crypto assets between stablecoin and the volatile one. And this is a very obvious use cases. And after that, the extension of lending and borrowing. After being a user of this, I can just see how important is to the entire space.
00:11:23.958 - 00:12:31.910, Speaker D: So that's why I started to dig more research into DFI, start being a power user and early supporter, and obviously being a very early user of synthetics community helps a lot as well. And that kind of lasts me through most of 2019, being an early D five user and community member, especially in the synthetics. And I think what really changed is synthetics start to did quite well around there. And I think around 2020, the whole space before D by summer start to grow pretty well on an organic level. But then after D five summer, it just was just like an explosive moment that everyone realized that DFI is not a fad, that a lot people start to really recognize that there's a lot of potential in think at that moment. I raised defiance capital, and we have grown very fast since then. So with the support of trees capital, we have raised around meat eight figures of capital.
00:12:31.910 - 00:12:56.142, Speaker D: But trios and myself are the largest investor. And from 2022nd half 2020 until now, we've grown tremendously to around low to midnight figures of capital right now. Obviously, the figures change a lot depending on the market condition, but yeah, that's where we are right now. Yeah, I think we can go deeper into any part we would like to.
00:12:56.216 - 00:14:01.900, Speaker A: Arthur, that's a pretty incredible story. And bankless listeners, I want you to draw out a few things that Arthur said there as he started with kind of a thesis, but then he also became a DeFi super user, which is interesting there, and then turned kind of investor, turned fund manager. But the amounts that you're managing are pretty incredible. Arthur. And I'm just curious because I think a lot of people listening are Defi super users, also Defi investors, and they're pretty excited about your trajectory, because they want a similar trajectory. They're interested in the path that you've taken. So what is it? Was it just this combination of right place, right time, you being a Defi super user, you applying a thesis at a time when the market was bearish and then it flipped bullish? What's kind of the secret ingredient for your success here? Because I think a lot of listeners want to emulate this.
00:14:06.510 - 00:15:10.926, Speaker D: I would say that I think there's no secret. It's more like after doing your research or so called homework, a really strong belief in your research, in your understanding, and obviously that is based on your research, is the right research. And I think that a lot of time people are very affected by what is happening now, but not on what has happened over the last, previous trend and what is the ongoing trend. So if you always focus on the current point of the market, you're always going to draw a very different conclusion, because crypto can be in a bull market in two months, in a bear market in two months, which is what we have experienced recently. But if you look at the crypto in 2018, yes, there was the bubble and a lot of the misallocation of capital, but the usage of crypto actually has been increasing. And even that time we see a very small glimpse into the potential NFT. I was also the very early player of cryptokitty as well.
00:15:10.926 - 00:16:11.922, Speaker D: So I think obviously the NFT whole thing really come off around early this year. Right? But the first glimpse into the potential already happened two years ago. And for Defi, you can also argue that you see the potential of Dexes when ether Delta came on the scene, but it just also was two years too early until uniswap really changed the game. So I think that by looking into the previous usage and the early sign of product fee and you look at where the world want to go next, I think you can really the so called cliche Zoom out that gives you a lot more confidence on where the world is going. So I think that the biggest factor for me is really the persistent, because I think a lot of people drop out during a bear market, but I believe that what we are doing is just not all hype and there's actually something bigger that we are building. And obviously I think being early helps a lot, but I think the entire space is still incredibly early. There are some DeFi project where investors, when I invested, it's around less than 100 million market cap.
00:16:11.922 - 00:16:25.046, Speaker D: And right now I think there are still quite a lot of promising d five protocol. They are trading at below 100 million market cap as well. And I have no doubt some of them will become a billion dollar d five protocol in the future. And these are most of them.
00:16:25.148 - 00:16:26.040, Speaker A: Which ones?
00:16:30.490 - 00:16:44.800, Speaker D: I don't want to be this like a top my back section, but I think most of them, which I mentioned, they're actually publicly listed. Really, you can buy them from Uniswap, from some of the centralized exchanges. So, yeah, you don't even need to get into private sale to get in.
00:16:45.170 - 00:17:25.580, Speaker A: Here's the other thing that you were doing at a time when it wasn't popular, because in 2017, it was the era of futility tokens, like pointless tokens, that were injected in protocols, right? In 2018, it was not popular to make a bet on a token. Like, tokens were out, they were dead. I mean, they were useless, right? This is what the market sentiment held. And that's why we saw, even while there was early traction in Defi protocols, tokens just weren't being valued, probably the way they should be valued. Was that a core part of your thesis at the time, that, hey, these tokens are actually worth something, even though the market is highly discounting them?
00:17:26.910 - 00:18:14.666, Speaker D: Yes. So I think that's where I was quite different with most of the consensus back then, because I think, first of all, I used to be very adamant, and I think right now, I still have a very strong focus, efficient on token value accrual. I think especially in a bear market during 2018, there was really no bottom, especially for the so called outcoins. After they dropped 90%, they can still drop another 80%. So I think at that point of time, value accrual become extreme, because there should be some base flaw in the value if the product is being used and people are using it. So if the product is used, there should be some value being captured and this value should provide like, a flaw to the value in the token. So you know that it will not go to zero.
00:18:14.666 - 00:18:45.954, Speaker D: And that gives the token holder a lot more confidence in holding during the bad time. So that was the way I approach it during the bear market. And I think that this actually extend to most of the token. I think that some form of value accrual has to be, because else what are we really investing? I mean, the so called futility token. Yeah. The investor doesn't need to hold them, we only need to purchase them when we need to pay for certain token services, which is why that the demand factor will be so weak. Yeah.
00:18:45.954 - 00:19:31.780, Speaker D: So I think that's a very major difference. And I think that the unique thing about token is because I personally did a lot of research. So what is the best way to design a good token, and how do we make it integrated into the platform? I think that there's two main purposes a token should serve. First, it has to have a strong value accrual. The second thing is it should serve as a growth catalyst for the protocol and the community, because I think this is the advantage of token competitive traditional equity, because you can't really freely give out the equity to your user and community member due to various regulatory restrictions. But for token, you have a lot of leeway to innovate with this, and this is actually a very strong advantage that the crypto community should not give up on.
00:19:32.710 - 00:20:11.760, Speaker B: Arthur, one thing I think is really cool about your story, and I want to go more into fundamentals, and we're about to get into that in just a sec. But I want to still talk about the story of defiance capital. And you, Arthur, you came into this world in 2017. You go through the bear market with us in 2018, 2019 with me. We're both students of the 2017 era, and I want to impress upon the listeners that you came out of just your first cycle starting to manage a fund. But, Arthur, I want to ask, how old are you? How old are you? How old are you?
00:20:12.290 - 00:20:14.354, Speaker D: I'm currently 29 years old.
00:20:14.552 - 00:20:39.480, Speaker B: And you're managing a fund that's somewhere between 200 and $500 million, depending on the emotions of the crypto markets. Does that ever scare you? Is that a scary thing? Because that's a lot of money, and you're 29 years old. That's a crazy thing that I think we could only find in crypto. Do you ever reflect on just the magnitude of the discrepancy between the size of the fund and how young you are?
00:20:42.170 - 00:21:09.250, Speaker D: Yeah. Yes. I think there's actually another factor I'm most impressed and surprised by, actually. I think even in traditional finance, you do have some of the successful trader managing a few hundred million dollars of capital. But I think most of these are not their capital. But I think for crypto, I'll say it's not just for our fund, but a lot of other fund as well. Like the principal capital is probably a majority of the investment fund.
00:21:09.250 - 00:21:52.800, Speaker D: Same for defiance. So I think, in that sense, it's quite amazing that how people at our age can accumulate such an amount of capital and just managing such an amount of swing. I think this really brings to the fact that crypto is a major level playing field and for everyone from different background, because I didn't come from a very wealthy family. And actually, I came to Singapore only ten years ago, and crypto just really give everyone the opportunity who are willing to put in the effort and willing to make it happen. So I think that's the fact I'm definitely impressed by.
00:21:53.170 - 00:22:54.846, Speaker B: I think that's what listeners should really walk away with right now. When Arthur is telling his story about just the formulation of his thoughts in 2017, 2018, as somebody that also came into the world of crypto around that same time, I very much resonated with these thought structures or thought patterns that Arthur was having about what he thought about the market at the. So I think listeners should understand that it's possible to come into the world of crypto and look around and formulate an opinion as to what's going on and then turn that into a fund or turn that into something. Arthur here turned it into a fund. Other people can turn it into something else. But how far you have to go into this industry to start really making a difference and doing something cool is not as deep as what people thought. And that's the opportunity that I think a lot of listeners should come to, or conclusion that they should come to, is that you can come in and figure out what's going on in the world of crypto.
00:22:54.846 - 00:23:30.160, Speaker B: You got to do your homework for a year or two, but then you look around and start formulating an opinion and start to test that and turn that into something viable. And so, Arthur, maybe you could just go in a little bit more into just the details as to how you established your own confidence in your ability to call the shots or your own confidence that your theses and your beliefs about the crypto world were the right world. Did you ever have doubts, or did you ever have concerns, or just tell us the story of just coming into the shoes of a 500 million dollar fund?
00:23:31.890 - 00:24:22.910, Speaker D: Sure. I think I used to say that in the tweets a few days ago. Confidence is the memory of winning, and I believe that it should be the same for everyone. Like, when you're doing something and you keep getting certain form of validation from your action, and then your confidence will just increase. And I think that in the initial phase, I think it took a while, because I think that my first was synthetics, and it took a while for the thesis to be realized, but I think that it's also a comfort fact that sometimes you have to do it yourself. I think the early stage where people wasn't recognizing the potential of synthetics, and it was during a bear market I took upon myself and spent, I think close to one and a half months to write a really comprehensive report. And actually, that report was not perfect.
00:24:22.910 - 00:25:06.094, Speaker D: And I think even if you look at it right now, it's already outdated. So I don't suggest people to go and search it up, but I think you have to do something, belief in yourself and make it happen, to just really put it out there and see what kind of result you get. And I think the result was actually overwhelmingly positive. And then I think after a few months, the market start reacting to that. And then I just keep applying the same approach to the different DeFi protocol which I invested in, spend time in the community, help out and help to popularize them, and also just communicate with the team and see if any value we can add as much as possible. And I think this approach is actually quite universal. It's just that not many people are doing in a crypto that time.
00:25:06.094 - 00:26:04.080, Speaker D: I think when you look at a traditional venture capital, they also lend a lot of support to the community. And I think this probably also brings my experience from stock investing, because I think in a stock investing world, there's something called the activist investing, actually not just stock. I mean, there's this in the bond market as well. The investor will really try to affect some changes in the companies or the stuff they are invested in to get value out of it. I think that in crypto, similarly, you can actually apply this concept and actually to a bigger extent, because most of the crypto and Defi protocol, very early stage, and the team will very happily interact with most of the committee members. So you can really have a lot of influence on the future, on how the protocol is being run. So I think just keep doing this, and the feedback you get will just help you to build a lot of confidence, and this is how you get to that level.
00:26:04.610 - 00:26:23.000, Speaker B: Arthur, was there a moment where it just became obvious that the next step for you needed to be starting a fund, or did you always want to start a fund? What was the inflection point where it defiance capital became a thing? What was the signal that you got from the market that you needed to start a fund?
00:26:24.890 - 00:27:35.600, Speaker D: I think the signal was the success we have been getting, the growth we've been getting, even before the fund was formed, it was a very strong validation of our investment thesis and approach, although we started from a very low base, but our return was pretty insane for most of 2019 and 2020, because even you look at it, most fund, even a small one, they don't really outperform bitcoin until 2020. I think the outperformed bitcoin part only started this year, where you see stuff like pocado and other stuff start going like crazy, like 20 x or 15 x. But I think 2019 was quite hard to outperform bitcoin because just bitcoin dominance was so strong during that period. But we have managed to did that and then just keep doing that for most of the time. And we have been seeing our investment thesis being validated. Like some of our call, it was actually quite public because I was quite active on Twitter fairly early on, and most of our call was validated in a very convincing way.
00:27:36.290 - 00:28:05.750, Speaker A: So let's talk a little bit about that investment thesis, Arthur. I think we want to spend some time here. So defiance capital, you guys say we invest in defi eating traditional finance. That is something definitely bankless listeners are quite familiar with. We talk about it all the time. DeFi is going to eat traditional finance. But I find it striking as you as kind of a crypto super user, a crypto native have sort of started defiance as a crypto native fund.
00:28:05.750 - 00:29:04.700, Speaker A: So you're able to do things like invest directly in Daos. There was an interesting post by Kane Warwick, who's one of the founders of synthetics. He wrote a post on Dao First Capital formation. I thought it was really interesting because he makes the point and this was, I believe, addressed to founders where he hey, founders, why go the traditional VC route and legal structure route when you're going to decentralize all of those things anyway? Why not just start with a Dow first and start with that structure? You know you're going to end up in that structure to begin with, so why not save some time? What's interesting about, I believe the way defines is structured is you can more easily invest and are more comfortable, maybe prefer to invest in crypto native dow type vehicles like that. Can you talk about the edge that that gives defiance and how important it is for investors to look at crypto native capital coordination vehicles like.
00:29:09.870 - 00:30:09.694, Speaker D: Yeah, I think we are one of the crypto native fund. They are able to invest in DAO directly, just that because we have been in the space for a very long time. So we are comfortable with this kind of structure. And Dao also in a way that there is some protection to the investor as well because most dows structured by the way that you need some majority to make some major decision. And sometimes most of the time, the investor will also have some decision making responsibility as well. And I think the importance is especially crucial for DeFi protocol because I think that there's a reason it's called decentralized finance. And I think with the recent regulatory action, especially the latest, I call it FATF guidance, it was recently being delayed to October, but it's still not 100% sure that how is it going to be.
00:30:09.694 - 00:30:44.570, Speaker D: And there's the potential to be a very strict interpretation of that which going to regulate DFI protocol the same way as a centralized crypto company. But the DeFi industry is obviously trying to lobby for a much more sensible guidance. But regardless, I think that it's important for the DeFi protocol to find a way to gradually decentralize, and I think Dao is one of the best structure to do that. So, yeah, this is why we really support this DAO capital structure formation.
00:30:44.990 - 00:31:29.610, Speaker A: Arthur, something else you guys have emphasized, and we even started talking about it when you talked about token value accrual, is this focus on fundamentals. And we've talked to a ton of different crypto native funds and traditional kind of crypto funds on bankless, and I haven't quite heard the emphasis on fundamentals from the others, as you seem to have. A lot of them talk about sentiment, a lot of them talk about narratives, a lot of them talk about community. Can you tell us what you mean when you talk about fundamentals? What are fundamentals in crypto and why are they important in this industry? That seems like it's sometimes just based on memes.
00:31:31.070 - 00:32:26.918, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a great question. I think every fund actually do look at fundamentals, but they will probably define fundamentals in a different way. So for us, fundamentals means the team quality, the valuation of the protocol, and to extension to the team quality is like the execution track record. Have they built something valuable? What's their previous history, the technical architecture? Because sometimes we find that the whole thing, the design to be unfit, or sometimes the design is superior, the community involvement and the token value accrual. And the last but not least, the near term catalyst. So these are most of the fundamental factors we look at. And to us, fundamental matters a lot, because in crypto, right, the correlation very often go to one when the market is dropping.
00:32:26.918 - 00:33:12.118, Speaker D: So actually, in a sense, if you are talking about downside protection, there is not that much reason to be very diversified. Like you want to avoid the risk where one of the protocol got hacked, and then you lose 100% of your investment. But if you want to diversify just to prevent the correlation risk, there's not much reason in that, because everything go down at the same time. But when in a bull market, when the token is rallying you can see a lot more dispersion. Like some will do a lot better. Like some did 500% in the Q one this year, but some only did like 100%. So I think that by focusing on the fundamental, you can capture this kind of positive divergence when the market is rallying.
00:33:12.118 - 00:33:45.458, Speaker D: And I think that market do pay attention to the fundamentals, but often it can get crowded out by the very noisy stuff. And I think this is part of the extension of the current world we are being in. There's a meme coin investing in the stock market as well. And to a certain extent, there's like a meme stock investing in the stock market and a meme coin investing in the crypto world, like the dogecoin and the shiba and all the stuff. But I think that ultimately, there's a very different kind of audience looking at this stuff. The smart money will always look at the fundamental. It's just how they interpret it.
00:33:45.458 - 00:33:48.406, Speaker D: Everyone have a slightly different way of interpreting it.
00:33:48.588 - 00:35:09.198, Speaker A: Arthur, I just looked at coin market cap, like sometime earlier today, there's some sort of coin dashboard, and Shiba was at over $4 billion in fully diluted valuation. And that just blew my mind first and second, it made me a little bit sad, right? Just a little bit sad, because there are so many interesting assets in crypto, so many capital assets with cash flow, so many defi assets with protocols behind them that are going to change the world and eat the rest of finance. But people out there are out chasing, like, meme coins. And that just kind of makes me sad, I guess, for crypto. But you're saying you have hope. You're saying that in the longer term that crypto markets are going to value fundamentals so highly. I guess my question is, how do you explain things like litecoin or XRP or the Shibas of the world in that context? Are they going to ultimately just diminish while the fundamental assets are going to increase? Or are we just in a world of funhouse mirrors and narratives? And maybe fundamentals are kind of pushed aside in this new market that we live in.
00:35:09.198 - 00:35:14.610, Speaker A: Give me some more hope here on why fundamentals matter more than narratives.
00:35:15.750 - 00:36:04.350, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that it's a gradually changing process. I want to draw an analogy from the stock market. So before Benjamin Graham published the book called Security Analysis, the market for the larger period of time doesn't know how to value a stock properly. So I think the stock, like 70, 80 years ago was actually quite similar to crypto. Now, there was a lot of hype and speculation and people don't really know how to value it properly. And the discounted cash flow model only popularized, I think around like, I think 19, sorry, I probably get a year around like 50 or gradually the process are being refined and people start to talk about the discount rate and what is the equity risk premium. So all these things take time to develop.
00:36:04.350 - 00:36:34.550, Speaker D: I think we're in a similar phase in crypto, where there's no consensus on how to value crypto asset yet. And as a result, and people also have a very surface view, like normal people have a very surface view on what is crypto. Because when they come into crypto, they always talk about bitcoin first, and this is called cryptocurrency. Right. And then to an extent they think all, most of it are like currency ish crypto. But you guys have talked about it. A lot of the crypto, especially in the d five space, are capital asset.
00:36:34.550 - 00:37:19.846, Speaker D: They produce cash flow, they're what we call the productive assets. So the way you look at them is very different from the way you look at the currency. I think that unfortunately that there's still a lot education we need to do. I think that the Defi community over the last few years is really a lot more focused on building the right product and because the scalability is not software, so we don't want to onboard the mainstream user too early. But unfortunately that the bull market came and then the retail was always on boarded to the exciting stuff and where the opportunist actor was always trying to capture the attention. Look at Shiva swap, right? I mean, I think this is my view and my research, but I think that there are some group of people behind it and they are not doing it for altruistic reason. I think they probably have some game plan behind it.
00:37:19.846 - 00:38:05.830, Speaker D: And then these people are always at the marketeer, they always know how to capture the retail's attention. And a lot of defi people really want to build a good product and they want to make sure their product is good enough before they really start to market it out the wider audience. So I don't think this is going to change immediately, but I think it's a gradual process where market is just slowly getting smarter and smarter through various cycle. It might not happen as fast as we hope to be, but I think it's definitely changing because this is how the fundamental investment approach we are able to use to generate so much return for us and our investor, right. We went from low six figures of capital to around like nine figures of capital and all these are done through a fundamental investment processes.
00:38:06.650 - 00:38:41.810, Speaker B: A frequent metaphor we use on the bankless program is that we are speed running the history of money and finance. And I guess when, Arthur, you say that previous markets had equal amounts of trouble valuing fundamentals, I guess we should incorporate that and as knowledge. When we say that crypto speed running the history of money and finance, well, it's not doing it in one year. It's not going to happen that fast. It's going to happen in 1020, 30 years. And so we are still likely going to go through a phase where the market is having trouble understanding what the hell it is. What is the assets that are inside of these things.
00:38:41.810 - 00:39:30.690, Speaker B: And Arthur, one of the fundamental metrics or fundamental drivers that you say that you pay attention to over at defiant is token value capture. And does the token actually capture value? Now there's a wide range of token models that exist out there that we could, and we don't have the time to go through every single one. But I want to ask you to pull apart two examples that you have seen in the defi space of one token that has a really strong token value capture mechanism that you just really like, or a handful, and then some other tokens that while you like the projects and maybe the project adds value to the world, the token just doesn't capture any value. Can you kind of compare and contrast some winners and some losers in this category just for examples for our listeners?
00:39:32.550 - 00:40:35.480, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. I think I was a very big proponent of the synthetics token economics from the beginning, because I think they are the one that pioneer using token inflation to incentivize the community and also incentivize the early adopter, because the inflation starts from a pretty high level, but it's gradually tapered down. So it reward the early user who really believe in the protocol and took the initial risk. So I think this is very good design. And also there's a very obvious value capture where by taking the risk of staking in the synthetics protocol, the token holders are rewarded by the fee generated by the protocol at the same time, both in the native token and also in the extra fee income that was generated by people trading on a synthetics protocol. So I think that by taking some of our risk, they are also rewarded in some sort of income. So I think this is usually a pretty universal principle, and I still think that it's a pretty good design.
00:40:35.480 - 00:41:14.766, Speaker D: Obviously, when it comes to hedging the debt exposure, it was always quite problematic. Other design, I think it was very well designed, but until right now, I think not enough people have understand it, which is Bangkok. So actually Bangkok, they went through a lot of iteration. I think right now they finally arrived at the token economic model that make a lot of sense. So out of so many Dexes protocol, actually Bangkok capture the most value for the token holder. I think 40% to 60% of the fee actually go to the Bancorp token holder. But it doesn't come in the form of income, it actually come in the form of the burning.
00:41:14.766 - 00:41:46.830, Speaker D: And there is also consistent of the so called inflation or to support a new liquidity pool as well. But actually it was quite complicated. I think most people don't really realize that. So as a result they are still not really valued highly. But actually our team wrote a blog post on that one explaining how the mechanism works. So I think for the more detailed minded people they're happy to take a look. So I think both these have a very good design and I think for lending and borrowing protocol ave and compound the value accrue is quite similar.
00:41:46.830 - 00:42:29.340, Speaker D: They both take a small percentage from the interest owned that accrue to the depositor and go to the treasury. I think in the future the token holder can vote on how the treasury is accumulated. Reserve is going to be used, it can be returned to the token holder or investment into the protocol. And I think for Aave, the token holder is quite similar for maker as well. The token holder is also acting as a backstop to the solvency of the protocol as well. So I think this is a very sound economic design. So it took them a while to come to this design as well.
00:42:29.340 - 00:43:25.886, Speaker D: And then you have a lot of the DeFi protocol that just doesn't capture value at all. Right. And they don't have a very concrete plan how to get there as well. I think those are just the team and community need to figure it out. So I think another more controversial point I have is I think at this stage, buyback and burn is probably not the most optimal solution because in a way I think the placeholder have published a blog post called Buyback and they actually argue that buyback and burn, when the protocol still have a lot of growth potential, is actually destroying capital. And I really agree with desk, because when you look at an early stage startup in the traditional world, nobody is just doing share buyback or giving out dividend that early, actually. I mean giving dividends sometimes, but usually it's one off.
00:43:25.886 - 00:43:57.774, Speaker D: It's not a consistent dividend policy. When you have a lot of growth potential, you always want to reinvest in the growth, and that's actually fine. So yeah, I think the buyback and burn for most of the DeFi protocol right now is a bit too early that they should actually find a way to reinvest this protocol or even just give back to the token holder. I think it's still better than burning the capital directly, although I understand there's some tax implication for returning the so called dividend to a token holder, but I think that a better way can still be designed.
00:43:57.922 - 00:45:11.120, Speaker A: So, Arthur, so you don't love the buyback and burn, or probably the distributing cash flow too early back to token holders? Because your argument is should reinvest back into the protocol? I'm curious about this because we have some protocols sitting on now. Billions of dollars worth in treasury, right? So one that comes to mind is the Uniswap team. We talk about it often billions in their treasury, and they've got like 1520 people on their team. And so what could they possibly invest back into those billions of dollars? They're not like a large bank where they have office floors and physical infrastructure and tons of employees in suits and ties and travel expenses and all of these things. It's just like 20 people in a protocol. So what about that argument that hey, if the protocols don't have anything to do with the money, and what should protocols spend on? Maybe they should push some of those funds back to the token holders. Any thoughts there?
00:45:12.870 - 00:45:50.060, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that is a very sensible point. But I don't think that most DeFi protocol would not find a way to utilize their capital effectively. I think Uniswap is outlier just because of how highly valued they are. And as a result that treasury is massive because the token is worth a lot. But I think most DeFi protocols do not have that huge amount of capital. And setting aside some as a reserve for future usages, I think that most of them can find a good way to invest those capital. Like you can invest in more education.
00:45:50.060 - 00:46:40.220, Speaker D: I think this is always like you're always fighting attention against the meme coin, right? So why don't the DeFi protocol invest in more educational channel, more outreach effort, more translation, more in the local community so that not just the english speaking community understand what DeFi is about, but the community from all the other world as well. I think some protocol did it better, but I think generally most of the DeFi protocol we are speaking to, because they are early stage as well, are a lot more focused on improving their product instead of reaching out to the new community. Because I think that you guys actually, like Bangladesh, did a very good job by translating your content to multiple languages to reach out to more community. I think this is what a lot of the protocol could have done better. And actually, it just takes a lot of effort, and you might just need to hire a lot more people.
00:46:41.230 - 00:47:25.020, Speaker B: Arthur, we want to keep on going down the fundamentals rabbit hole, and I ultimately want to get to kind of an AmM comparison, because I think there's a lot to be learned, a lot to be gleaned from talking about all the different dexes and how we see the market valuing these things. But before we get there, we need to talk about all the different metrics that one could use to evaluate a protocol. So, Arthur, say you are coming upon this new up and coming DeFi protocol that you want to evaluate. What are the metrics that you really look to first? Is it market cap, fully diluted cap? Capital efficiency ratios? What are the basic metrics that you look at first, and then maybe some of the more advanced ones as well?
00:47:27.710 - 00:47:50.402, Speaker D: I think the basic one. Okay. So I think it depends on whether the protocol already have a working product. So I think if you do not have a working product yet, it's really similar to how most VC look at it. The team, the track record, the concept, the vertical. They are voting. Are there any precedent, and can you value them? So I think these are pretty standard.
00:47:50.402 - 00:48:31.466, Speaker D: I probably will not go too much into it, because this is really on how the traditional VC thing about investment in crypto, you have the token part. You want to think about how the team is planning to distribute a token and what do they plan to do with the token. So I think for those with already a working product, there's a few metrics I think matters a lot. There's also a very good post on Messari recently, talking about which fundamentals of defi protocol matter the most. I think that what we look at, we look at, first of all, if it's indexes, we look at the volume. I think that's very universal. How much volume are they generated? And then after that, we look at the fee value capture, if there's a fee value capture.
00:48:31.466 - 00:49:05.898, Speaker D: So I think right now it's pretty standard. Like most protocol cap, for the non stable coin protocol, they take 0.5% of the trading volume as a fee, and for the stable coin, they take slightly lower. I think curve took like 0.4% of the trading volume, or actually the fee as an income. And then you look at the total value lock, and this actually represent how much capital this protocol is securing. I think this is a very popular ratio in the DeFi space right now.
00:49:05.898 - 00:49:49.986, Speaker D: And I think capital efficiency is on a case by case basis where I think some protocol is just optimized for more capital efficiency. I think that matters, but we still look at the fee generated, I think that matter the most against the market cap of the protocol. So I think this is ultimately how a capital asset is being valued in a traditional finance like price to earning ratio. And to the extent the discounted cash flow, how much cash flow you're generating should dictate how highly valued you are. And after factoring the growth rate and the discount rate of the protocol. So these are the universal factors. But I think one factor that really drive a lot of the price action is the user and the user growth.
00:49:49.986 - 00:50:17.860, Speaker D: Because I think that at this stage, people understand the cash flow might not come immediately because, for example, Uniswap have no cash flow, because they just don't have any value capture at the moment. But they're valued the most among the DeFi protocol because they have a tremendous user base and the user growth is also one of the best in the industry. So I think this is a metric that out of that there's no direct correlation with the value accrual, but it's something that the market is placing a lot of emphasis on.
00:50:19.430 - 00:50:37.750, Speaker B: So what are some of the assets that you see out there, the protocols or projects that you see out there that would you say are undervalued? Based on the metrics that you look at, are there any things that really just stand out as a complete outlier between their valuation and the actual fundamentals that the project holds?
00:50:38.910 - 00:51:28.178, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, disclaimer, I think this asset might be something that defines whole position in. I think that if you look at a pure metrics level, you can actually just go to token terminal and then you can just sort the asset by price to sale ratio and then you can just see, or price to earning ratio. I think they're coming out with that as well. Then you can just see what is the most undervalued. I think we have always maintained that sushi soil is very undervalued because given the volume they are doing, they should not deserve such a huge dispatch. I know a lot of people argue that unisoft v three is going to kill sushi sort because sushi is just like an older version, like v two design. But the fact that that hasn't happened, because I think that what we have seen over the last one to two months is unison.
00:51:28.178 - 00:52:24.790, Speaker D: Vtree is really optimized for the active liquidity provider, which right now means like the professional market makers. I think it's very hard for retail to be a passive liquidity provider on VTree. And I think there are some backtechs being run, although the sample size not big enough that they actually did not perform better than the b two. So I think there's passive lp still have its place. And as a result, I think that at this ratio, that sushi sading at this market is basically pricing like zero growth. Sushi Sa is just not going to grow further, which I think that's not the case. And I think from a growth stage level, not looking beyond just the ratio, I think both Aave and compound is undervalued by the market because I think among all the different d five verticals, lending and borrowing are the segment with the most defensible mode.
00:52:24.790 - 00:53:13.466, Speaker D: So in a sense that I don't think there is any new lending and borrowing protocol using the similar design, building on Ethereum can come in and disrupt them within a year. I think it's just not possible because it takes a long time to build the trust and build the safety, because both of them have operated for more than one year and there was no security incident as well. So I think these take time to build. It's also the vertical with the most obvious liquidity and network effect. Because it's like if you do not have sufficient deposits in the platform, people can't borrow a huge volume and vice versa. So it takes a long time to build out the network effect. And also because the token is worth a lot more, the liquidity incentive they give out is more effective as well.
00:53:13.466 - 00:53:18.300, Speaker D: So it's just very hard for the early stage protocol to compete Ave and compound in this regard.
00:53:19.390 - 00:54:10.990, Speaker B: Arthur, let's go into a little bit of a case study with all of the amms that are out there, because there's a lot, there's Uniswap curve, sushiswap, Bancorp, we've already talked a little bit about some of these, but I want to go into more detail about specifically the sector of amms, because I think that can really be an illustrative example. Uniswap, you talked about how it has really high growth sushiswap. You said how it is being valued as if it's not going to grow. Then you also earlier talked about Bancorp and how it has captured a lot of value for its token holders. How do you see the market valuing these things differently? It seems to be that each one of them has their own fundamentals, right. Each one of them is capturing some sort of fees. But it seems to be that the market is telling different stories based off of each of these different amms.
00:54:10.990 - 00:54:17.310, Speaker B: Do you have a rationale or an explanation of why the market values these things so differently?
00:54:20.570 - 00:55:01.374, Speaker D: I think that right now market is in a way of most of the investors, when they look at Defi, they want to invest in the growth. And I think that as a result, that Uniswap just captured the lion's share of the attention in the market. And they are the pioneer of that model as well. So market have a lot of confidence on Uniswap being able to maintain that dominance and being like the most cutting edge team as well. So I think as a result, their model is always being placed a lot of premium. And I think for other Amm model, the more unique one will be balancer and Bangkok. Because sushi shop is just like the same design as a unisor V two.
00:55:01.374 - 00:55:45.380, Speaker D: I think the market want to see whether the differences can compete with the v three design. I think so. We are invested in both Bangkok and Balancer because we think that there is a value to their design and the way they present to the user. But I think it takes time for the market to learn about it and to be convinced, because balancer was actually, I think, the second major defi protocol to kick off the liquidity mining. But after that, the traction got taken away by uniswap instead. And then it always takes time for the market to spend time to understand a specific. And you need some catalyst as well.
00:55:45.380 - 00:56:34.820, Speaker D: It can become in the form of fundamental, let's say like I think XC Infinity, it's not a DeFi protocol. But recently the price have done very well, outperform most of Defi protocol. It's just that because the revenue they're generating is just way too big to be ignored. So this can be a catalyst event that your fundamental is so superior that the market just can't ignore it. Or you have some catalysts where people are really amazed by the design. So I think both Bancor and balancer, they need this kind of event for people to really spend time understanding their design and to come to a conclusion that this design actually is really a very good design and the market should value them in a different way. So I think you usually need some event to capture the market attention and for market to value you in a different way.
00:56:35.750 - 00:57:27.570, Speaker A: I'd also throw maybe curve into the mix here. And I'm curious Arthur, just one other follow up on the AMM portion of this conversation is the market also seems to be somewhat divided, and some folks believe that the AMM exchange world will be dominated by sort of a power law winner. One automated market maker will dominate, say 80% of the exchange market. Others believe that there will be many different automated market maker designs. And you with an investment in Bancor and also balancer, kind of more the long tail automated market makers. At this point, maybe that's more indicative of your belief. How do you think this shakes out? Will there be one power law winner or will we live in a world with many different automated market makers?
00:57:29.270 - 00:58:37.574, Speaker D: I think that there's no power law because liquidity is very fungible in this space. And we have seen the scene have changed over the last one to two years. Well, I think IDEX used to be the largest decentralized exchange until they decided to make some changes. I think implementing KYC probably affected their fortune quite a fair bit, and then uniswap came to the scene and then maintained their dominance since then. But it's just that when you look at the centralized exchange, the fate has always changed, right? I mean, finance wasn't that dominant until 2018, and then you have Bitfinex was used to be dominant, and polonics and older time, the chinese exchanges was the most dominant as well. So liquidity is very functional, and I think in that sense that there's always possible for some am to come with a new design and improve it, and then just be more dominant for a certain period of time. So I think it's actually good for the end user, because everyone is just trying to come with a better design and compete over time.
00:58:37.574 - 00:59:19.714, Speaker D: And I think that you will see a power law for a certain period of time, but not forever. So I think that the situation can always change and you might end up in an equilibrium where just that there is no dominant. Mm. That everyone just have like a certain market share that's not changing too much. And I think that if you subscribe to the aggregation theory, what matters is the aggregator anyway, because they are going to, for any order, they are more than a certain size. You will always use aggregator to get the best pricing rather than just go to one amm to trade there. So I think in that sense, I believe that the power law is less likely to apply in the amm because liquidity is very fungible.
00:59:19.714 - 00:59:56.434, Speaker D: They will always move to the amm that give them the most best trade off for them. I think right now for passive LP Bancor is probably one of the best place because there's the impermanent protection. If you can stake for 100 days, you are not going to get any impermanent loss and you get some extra reward as well from the fee. So I think that for passive LP, these actually are in most cases, not all cases, a better decision than providing in a VTree, because Vtree, you need to actively manage it and you need to change the range depending on market condition. Is.
00:59:56.472 - 01:00:28.110, Speaker A: This is interesting. So Arthur, you're saying liquidity, it doesn't necessarily have loyalty. We could live in a world with many different automated market makers. And if people believe in sort of aggregation theory, then maybe some of these aggregators are more important. The machas of the world, the one inches of the world. I want to ask you another question with respect to network effects and power laws, and this is the question about Ethereum and ETH killers, or some people call them eth attempted murderers. What's your take on ETH killers?
01:00:31.810 - 01:01:21.470, Speaker D: My take on ETH killer is most of them are not going to be able to chip away at Ethereum's dominance except for very selected few protocols. I think my view, if I were to put a number, I would say there's probably less than five that will be able to chip away Ethereum's dominance, but they will not be able to kill Ethereum. So I think I've said to a lot of different people. So I think that Ethereum's dominance will probably come down a little bit. I think let's talk about DfI dominance or NFT dominance. 95% of the DFI and NFT are built on Ethereum right now. In the next two years we might see that coming down to 80% just because that other protocols start from ground zero.
01:01:21.470 - 01:01:56.742, Speaker D: So their growth rate will always be faster than Ethereum. Because Ethereum is already the majority of the economic activity from a growth rate percentage, it's always going to be slightly lower because you're already bigger. Bigger stuff always grows lower. Right. But I think Ethereum's dominance still going to stay at probably around 80% just because the network effect is so entrenched. And Ethereum itself is also constantly improving as well. We have the optimism and later in the year, like the ZK Rob deploying as well, and then we have Eve two pointly going to happen within the next three years as well.
01:01:56.742 - 01:02:22.530, Speaker D: So I think that the dominance is going to maintain, but I will not write off the fate of all the so called Eve killer completely because I think some of them, they are trying to carve like what we call the blue ocean strategy. They are trying to target new user. They are not on board into Ethereum right now, and I think the world is big enough for some of them to do well, but I don't think any of them will overtake Ethereum.
01:02:23.030 - 01:03:01.710, Speaker A: So I'm curious about this, just digging into this because you don't believe in a single dominant automated market maker, right? Because you think liquidity doesn't have loyalty and is somewhat fleeting. But you seem to believe that a smart contract platform, an open financial platform like Ethereum, has more ability to maintain dominance. Why is that? Does Ethereum have deeper moats than a uniswap? And why do you think that Ethereum can achieve its dominance and retain its dominance, whereas an automated market maker can't?
01:03:03.010 - 01:04:03.966, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a very good question. I think that when you look at the multiple factors which I'm going to go through, the network effect of a base layer is just a lot stronger, because when you look at the most successful so called scaling solution or other chain to gain a lot of user recently it was a binance smart chain. So what did binance smart chain did well that allowed them to gain so much user in a short amount of time is using the same block explorer, which is metamask, and using the same, sorry, same block Explorer, which is ether scan, the same team built for them called BSE scan, and they use the same wallet, which is the metamask, and use the EVM so that they can plug in with ether scan and metamask. So this is the network effect of Ethereum right?
01:04:03.988 - 01:04:04.560, Speaker A: Now.
01:04:06.870 - 01:04:52.526, Speaker D: Binance previously tried to build their own decks before, but it failed, which is called the binance chain. And they have their own dex built in because they did not inherit that network effect. And binance right now is likely the largest crypto company with the largest user base. Even with that, they cannot bootstrap their own chain successfully without relying on Ethereum's network effect. So I think that's a very good case study on how strong the network effect of Ethereum is. And I think the infrastructure on a base layer is just a lot harder to migrate on, because when you talk to the technical guy, you have the subgraph you need to build, you have the dev toolings, all this thing. It's not like you built a defi app on if layer one, the user can easily migrate because it's just like a front end, they just have the metamask.
01:04:52.526 - 01:05:26.442, Speaker D: But using a new layer one is like a totally new user experience. And the infrastructure that you need to use is also very different. I think the best analogy will be like an App Store analogy. Right now, the two most dominant App Store is like a Google and Apple. So a very big Microsoft tried to compete in this. They try to have their own App Store as well, but even a company of this size couldn't do it and they just retreat. In the end, they're just no longer doing this.
01:05:26.442 - 01:05:42.880, Speaker D: Right now, the market is just between Apple and Google. So I think this is probably the best analogy to understand the network effect of a base layer like Ethereum. And while the app, it's a lot easier to migrate between different layer one platform, right?
01:05:44.230 - 01:07:08.350, Speaker B: I think perhaps to expand upon that answer, we could also include Ethereum layer twos, where once you have your protocol built, as you said, once you have Ave built, once you have uniswap built, it's easy for you to just deploy that on binance smart chain or any EVM compatible app. And it's also easy for you to build that on Ethereum's own layer two, right? And so Ethereum as a base protocol can have Ethereum flavored derivatives, one of which could be binance smart chain, another one could be polygon, another one could be optimism or arbitrum. And these are all different chains that could be your app to be deployed upon, but you're stuck inside of the EVM ecosystem while building the actual aave, the application or uniswap the application, or any of the other defi apps that we know and love. Building that from scratch is actually the hard part. And once you do that hard part and you do it on an EVM compatible chain, then you're kind of stuck inside the EVM compatible world no matter what chain you're on. And usually Ethereum itself obviously benefits from EVM compatible stuff, but also, most importantly, Ethereum l two s also benefit from EVM compatible stuff. Arthur, how do you view ethereum l two s as playing into the Ethereum moat conversation?
01:07:11.570 - 01:08:01.786, Speaker D: I think that it's just very obvious that they are major help to the Ethereum, especially on a scaling roadmap. And I think this has also come from the community wanting to find a way to solve the scaling issue before Eve 2.0 is life. And I think all this is actually just a very entrenched, further entrenched Ethereum's network effect. Because all this layer two solution will need to adopt Ethereum's based infrastructure. EVM compatible will make their adoption happen much faster and also having a very supporting similar infrastructure and devtooling will just help them go a long way. So this definitely helped to entrench the network effect of Ethereum.
01:08:01.786 - 01:08:51.562, Speaker D: So actually I also want to come back a bit on something that I didn't mention on. Why do I think the network effect of Ethereum is so entrenched? I think there's also another two things which I think is very specific to layer one. One is the distribution of the ownership. I think right now most of the new smart contract platform is proof of stake based. And I think most people agree that proof of stake, there's a lot of advantage over proof of work, which I'm not going to go into repeat that. But I think one thing, there is one slight disadvantage, which I think is it's harder to decentralize the ownership of the proof of stake blockchain over time compared to provoke. Because provoke, the miner will always need to sell that coin to cover the operating expenses.
01:08:51.562 - 01:09:50.240, Speaker D: But for proof of stake, the selling pressure is a little bit lesser, the holder will still sell that. I think everyone have a take profit point. I think for people like us, we think that when Ethereum is at we will start to sell a little bit more of our ethereum. I think it's the same for pro stake if they will gradually decentralize over time, but the selling pressure will not be as strong as the proof of work base. So any new proof of stake blockchain will take a much longer time to decentralize and distribute their ownership compared to Ethereum. And I think that is part of the advantage of Ethereum compared to other proof of stake blockchain. Because when ownership is very concentrated, it's always lead to a slightly less censorship resistance, right, because a few token holders have most of the stake and it also takes a time for a lot of the proof of stake platform to achieve what I call the minimum viable censorship resistant level.
01:09:50.240 - 01:10:40.470, Speaker D: Because I think decentralization is a spectrum, but you can't have to be like the extreme end of the spectrum. Like we only have ten nodes and half of the nodes are run by the same parties. So I think that is definitely, you do not even cross a minimum threshold, but I think when you cross a certain threshold then I think people can start to trust that there's some form of sensor resistance built in and people can really start to see where is it going on the decentralization roadmap. And I think on both these factors it's very hard to compete Ethereum because Ethereum has a very clear roadmap on how they plan to decentralize further. And yeah, this whole ownership distribution is just a very strong mode that's very hard to overtake.
01:10:40.650 - 01:10:56.280, Speaker A: So you think Ethereum will continue to be dominant, but other layer ones will still have some role to play? I'm curious about this. If you had to pick one non ethereum layer one to bet on, what would it be and why?
01:10:58.170 - 01:11:45.086, Speaker D: Yeah, I think I'm going to get a lot of hate for this. But as an investor, I have to say after doing our research, I believe that Solana right now has some potential. Because I think that if you want to compete Ethereum, you can't compete on factor where Ethereum is the strongest at. I think that you can't compete Ethereum on being the most decentralized and you can't compare Ethereum on the same design and architecture. So I think if I really want to bet on an Eve competitor, I want to bet on a protocol that is taking a completely different approach. And I think a lot of the other Eve killer, they actually are just making some minor tweaks to the Ethereum and have some marginal improvement. I think that alone is not sufficient.
01:11:45.086 - 01:12:21.406, Speaker D: So I think Solana has a why. I think Solana has a potential is because they are taking a very different approach. They will not be as decentralized as Ethereum and they actually accept that trade off. But they do have a roadmap on how do they decentralize it. But they actually accepted the fact that they will not have few hundred thousand nodes running their few hundred thousand nodes in the future because they require a certain level of hardware requirement. But they want to find the more enthusiast hobbies. They're willing to spend a few thousand dollars to run their nodes and they accept that as a fine trade off.
01:12:21.406 - 01:12:34.870, Speaker D: And their skilling is really a lot rely on the hardware, which I think is a very different approach compared to Ethereum. So if I want to bet on something, I want to bet on something that's totally different, not where you are making a marginal improvement to Ethereum.
01:12:35.770 - 01:12:49.674, Speaker B: Hey guys, I hope you are enjoying the conversation with Arthur zero x thus far. In the second half of the show, we ask Arthur's opinion about Ethereum killers, eth killers, and whether he thinks that there is room in the market or not for them.
01:12:49.712 - 01:12:51.386, Speaker C: I thoroughly enjoyed his take there.
01:12:51.408 - 01:12:56.182, Speaker B: He's got a very specific opinion about this. And then we also ask Arthur about.
01:12:56.336 - 01:13:02.894, Speaker C: The different ways that the east approaches Ethereum, bitcoin, Defi versus the west, and.
01:13:02.932 - 01:13:15.346, Speaker B: How different areas inside of the east, the Chinese speaking languages, the English speaking asian countries or Japan and Korea. How they all approach Ethereum and defi separately, and a little hint there is.
01:13:15.368 - 01:13:17.314, Speaker C: That they each kind of approach this.
01:13:17.352 - 01:13:19.886, Speaker B: Industry as a reflection of the culture.
01:13:19.918 - 01:13:25.846, Speaker C: That they have at know. Shocker. The culture dictates the way that we approach things. And Arthur goes in and talks about.
01:13:25.868 - 01:13:33.606, Speaker B: The way that different areas of Asia look and have a stance towards Defi and Ethereum really enjoyed the second half.
01:13:33.628 - 01:13:36.278, Speaker C: Of this conversation, so don't go anywhere. But first we have to take a.
01:13:36.284 - 01:13:40.186, Speaker B: Moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible.
01:13:40.368 - 01:14:12.366, Speaker C: Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make. My crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens, and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets.
01:14:12.366 - 01:14:55.266, Speaker C: If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset. When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH. So whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of ETH bonus back to me. At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after signup, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com.
01:14:55.266 - 01:15:45.806, Speaker C: Gobankless the Ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on Ethereum, which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets. Ave version two has a ton of cool features that makes using the Ave protocol even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have supplied collateral here, you can see me borrowing 200 USDC against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens. In eTh. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently.
01:15:45.806 - 01:16:05.250, Speaker C: V two also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets, trade them on uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave with Ave. Users can do this in one seamless transaction, saving you time and gas costs. Check out the power of aave@aave.com that's aave.com.
01:16:05.340 - 01:17:00.410, Speaker B: Arthur I want to turn the conversation to a more global perspective about crypto and Defi and Ethereum. And while we are this global Internet based industry, we all come from our specific parts of the globe and we come into deFi. We come into crypto with our specific backgrounds and specific ways of viewing things. And one thing I've always been curious about, and never really been able to get my finger on the pulse of, is how the east generally at large, views crypto and ethereum differently than the west. And I'm assuming the east is a very large place. There's subdivisions inside of the east. Overall, how is the east viewing this industry, perhaps differently, or just prioritizes things in this industry differently than the west? Again, how is the east also subdivided into different sectors that view this industry differently?
01:17:01.790 - 01:17:49.254, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a great question. So, yeah, I would categorize the Asia or the East Committee into different parts. First of all, you have the english speaking region, which basically counts India and most of the Southeast Asia. So I think these are actually, I think due to the lack of language barrier. So the adoption of defi actually has been, I wouldn't say common, but among the crypto community, I think they are one of the fastest to understand DeFi and actually use it in a pretty significant way. So actually, from our understanding, a lot of the Southeast Asia countries have a pretty decent defi community. They might be a bit localized, but they are using DeFi application in a pretty major manners.
01:17:49.254 - 01:18:48.670, Speaker D: And then you have the chinese speaking region, which is basically China, Hong Kong and Taiwan and this country. I think initially they were a bit skeptical, because I think China back then in 2018, have a big transaction mining trend among the central exchanges, which is quite similar to liquidity mining currently. And as a result, they were quite skeptical for most period of time. But I think 2020, after the DFI summer, a lot of them have actually start to use DFI app in a major manner. And I think there's a lot more user up as a result of that. And then you also have, I think, the two other major crypto user, which is Japan and Korea. But I think largely due to language barrier and a cultural factor, these two regions have not really been using DeFi that much compared to the other places.
01:18:48.670 - 01:19:57.042, Speaker D: So this is how I would categorize think when it comes to China. I think the chinese speaking region, what we have seen is they are usually a lot more practical, and I think slightly less focused on the etos. I think what they really cherish about the DeFi is the self custody of the asset, because I think that they have seen the trouble with Okex recently, which nobody can withdraw any balances for, like, I think, two months. And I think that by using DeFi, this really prevent this issue from happening again. But I think on the decentralization aspect, on how decentralized this protocol is, I think they assess a lot more trust in a team and to the player itself. But I think for the english speaking community, we just want to have a lot more built in check and balances. So I think this is probably some of the more obvious difference we can see.
01:19:57.042 - 01:20:12.150, Speaker D: But I think most of them have accepted the benefit of using DeFi apps compared to a centralized change. And I think everyone just like the fact that they're being rewarded by being an early adopter and user of DeFi protocols.
01:20:13.530 - 01:20:18.438, Speaker B: I think that's really interesting. There is a common ethos of crypto.
01:20:18.534 - 01:20:20.122, Speaker C: That you're going to find, no matter.
01:20:20.176 - 01:21:23.230, Speaker B: What culture or background that you come from. But I think in your answer, and maybe I'm hopefully not trying to just create something out of nothing, but I think what I'm seeing is that everyone is coming to crypto for the reasons of the merits of crypto. They're the same universally, but different regions of the world or different regions of Asia emphasize something that their legacy financial system that they're coming from is really lacking. For example, you talked about how in China, people really, really value that bearer asset nature of being able to hold your own keys. Well, China is a top down, authoritarian region. You would want that power to be able to control your own keys, especially coming from that region. And you talked about how Japan and Korea don't really go into the protocols as deep as maybe what we might do in the west, and they kind of stay on focusing on exchanges, and that also makes sense from countries that don't have that deep of a history of financial markets or financialization.
01:21:23.230 - 01:21:34.580, Speaker B: They aren't too comfortable going that deep into the world of crypto, because that's just not where they came from, from their legacy markets. Am I reading too far into this, or do you agree with that take as well?
01:21:37.590 - 01:21:50.920, Speaker D: I largely agree with that take. I think the historical and cultural factors likely will dictate the pace of adoption. Yeah, I think that's definitely true.
01:21:51.530 - 01:22:21.810, Speaker A: How much of this is just like, language translation stuff, though, too, Arthur, do you think? I don't know what Defi actually looks like in, say, mandarin, for instance. Are there defi interfaces that are created in native Chinese, or is that something the Defi community can work on more is internationalization and non english speaking education communication interfaces?
01:22:24.470 - 01:23:17.134, Speaker D: I think that it has to be taken as a holistic approach. I think by just doing a translation, that's a very good start, but I think ultimately, it makes sense to have some people in the community to speak to them and just gradually build that. So I think, I want to bring an example. I think Makerdao is probably one of the most successful DeFi protocol when it comes to adoption in the chinese speaking region. So I think one of the results, because they hire a very strong chinese community lead that really know the market there very well, and as a result, are able to communicate with a lot of the crypto user in China. But actually, most of the other Defi protocol do not have such a person to sit on the ground and able to do that to their community. So I think that is probably a more important factor.
01:23:17.134 - 01:23:42.202, Speaker D: You have someone in that area to promote and evangelize the stuff. I think this also happened. Ethereum. Right. I think Vitali, at the very early days, went to China a lot to evangelize Ethereum, and as a result, Ethereum still have a very big community in China, but a lot of the other protocol just did not do that. As a result, they just do not get the same mind. Yeah.
01:23:42.202 - 01:23:55.674, Speaker D: So I think that you always need a few evangelists to help the. Yeah, I think language translation is a good start. Having a good interface is a good start, but you always need some local evangelists.
01:23:55.802 - 01:24:31.770, Speaker A: It's funny, it always comes back to people as the layer zero in crypto. That's what this entire industry is based on. Yeah. Fascinating. So, really quick, before we leave sort of the Asia perspective here, I'm curious, your thoughts, Arthur, on all of the bitcoin mining stories that we've heard from China of legislation, regulation, the chinese government coming down hard on bitcoin mining. How should we interpret that, and what does that mean for crypto in China? And DeFi.
01:24:33.870 - 01:25:14.386, Speaker D: Great question. I think that the interpretation should be fairly straightforward. I think right now, China, they just want to have a lot more control over the financial market. And in their view, crypto is part of the financial market, and actually, it might affect their ability to further regulate or control the financial market as well. So as a result, they want to prevent this activity from happening. So the exodus of chinese miner is real. So we know a few major chinese miner and a mining pool.
01:25:14.386 - 01:25:48.642, Speaker D: They are all going overseas to find look for a new home. So, yeah, I think that you can also see from the hash rate as well. I don't think these are coming back because it takes a long time to build all this infrastructure. So I think the exhortators will just continue, and they're going to find a new home elsewhere, and you're going to see the concentration of hash rate in China becoming a history. That's my prediction. Because I think even if, let's say this is relaxing, the further the uncertainty will just prevent all this big miner from reinvesting back in the region. That's my view.
01:25:48.642 - 01:26:37.506, Speaker D: And I think that another big factor is the fiat on Ram in China is being curtailed further. So it will become harder and harder to convert the local currency, which is the remmingbi, into crypto, vice versa, going forward, because they just want to clamp down on all the OTC trading activities. In fact, one of the biggest OTC traders was actually put into was, I think, a guy called Zhao Dong. I might get a fact wrong, but that's what. Yeah, but I think, so we can expect. I think it's reasonable to expect the growth from the chinese side to slow down a little bit, because they just have a harder time to fail on ramp. But I think that the community that those that are initiated will continue to stay.
01:26:37.506 - 01:26:58.010, Speaker D: Some of them, they will just always keep some of their balances in the crypto space, like some of their net worth in the stable coin, in some bitcoin ethereum. And some of them, they know that it will be hard to convert this money into fiat, but they were okay with it. And I think this is what's going to happen going forward.
01:26:58.160 - 01:27:22.260, Speaker A: I will say, arthur, it seems like your jurisdiction, Singapore, is absolutely crushing it when it comes to response to crypto. Like, the Singapore government seems to be handling crypto with a very open mind. And also very soberly, is that what it's like on the ground. Are you impressed with what Singapore is doing or are there more subtleties there?
01:27:23.910 - 01:28:16.770, Speaker D: I have to say I'm definitely impressed, but there's definitely subtleties there as well. So I think that first of all, the regulator, even up to the top one, really try to understand what is it about. And I think right now their understanding is probably one of the top when it comes to from a global regulator point of view. So they understand what DeFi is, they understand the advertised benefit of DeFi, they also understand the problem right now. But whether they fully buy into the benefit of DeFi, we are not 100% sure yet. Say they do know the benefit that we've been talking about, but whether they believe it or not, I think that remain to be seen. So I think they are waiting to see more evidence, because I think a key thing to convince them right now is that most of the traction in DeFi is just restricted to the crypto space.
01:28:16.770 - 01:29:26.710, Speaker D: It doesn't touch the mainstream user yet. So I think in that regard, they are still skeptical that whether the benefit of DeFi can translate to the real world activities, which I think all of us believe will be, but I think just the roadmap towards that happening. But I think when it comes to regulation, Singapore ultimately is not a very big country, so it will follow the FATF guidance and the major key law being drafted by the bigger country like us and EU. So in that sense, it's definitely a lot friendlier and they are understanding. But the subtlety is that doesn't mean that they're going to regulate this thing in a completely opposite manner compared to the guidance issued by the global financial policy setting body. Yeah. So I think there's a subtlety there, but I think the entire approach is also a lot less prosecutorial and less aggressive in the sense that when you are doing something that's not 100% compliant and in gray area, the first action is not to going after you, but it's instead to try to understand what you're doing and make you compliant.
01:29:26.710 - 01:29:30.300, Speaker D: So I think that's the difference in approach there.
01:29:30.910 - 01:29:56.260, Speaker B: Arthur, as we come down to the close in this conversation, and thank you so much for giving us some of your time. This has been, I've already learned so much. I want to ask you what you are looking for out of the crypto industry in the second half of 2021. What is really missing that you really think needs to be here as a part of this industry? What are the next innovations that you see coming that you are really looking forward to?
01:29:58.070 - 01:30:38.750, Speaker D: I think it's really about scaling. I think we have seen the success of Polygon and also binance smart chain. I think more scaling solution will just help Ethereum to scale and more DFI app to be able to onboard more user as well. I think the d five protocol on Ethereum just crossed, I think definitely have crossed 1 million user over time. I'm looking forward to this crossing 5 million and 10 million probably by end of the year. I think it's possible if we have a very successful scaling solution and just more and more users starting to use defi application. So I think we have went beyond the zero to one phase in Defi.
01:30:38.750 - 01:30:50.370, Speaker D: I think next step is really about growing the user face, growing the user base and just getting more and more product to the hand of the normal crypto user and just a mainstream user.
01:30:51.350 - 01:30:58.600, Speaker B: Did you say that you think that we can five to ten x the users of this industry by the end of this year?
01:30:59.370 - 01:31:08.522, Speaker D: Yes, I think it's possible. If the scaling solution is good enough, I think it's definitely possible.
01:31:08.656 - 01:31:14.490, Speaker B: Why is scale such a crux? Why is everything hinged on scale?
01:31:14.990 - 01:31:38.820, Speaker D: Because I think that you can look at this from like a traditional tech company, right? I think the user experience, the initial user experience matters a lot. So I think if you do not have a good scaling solution, if user are being turned off by the first impression, they're just not going to come back. So I think it's important that we are able to onboard them with very good first impression and then they continue to stay.
01:31:41.270 - 01:32:09.402, Speaker A: That is a pretty bold prediction and I also love it. So five to 10 million DFI users by the end of the year is possible. Just let's end with a couple more predictions. Arthur, if you're willing to indulge us. Sir, we love predictions, so please indulge us. What do you think the total locked value in DFI is going to be? And then how about the price of ETH at the end of 2021? Again, fun predictions. Maybe right, maybe wrong.
01:32:09.536 - 01:32:18.080, Speaker D: Just fun. Okay, do you count BS Tvl as part of the TvL? Do we want to count them?
01:32:19.890 - 01:32:30.794, Speaker A: Do we count it, David? I kind of count Defi. Whatever is on Defi pulse is close to being counted. Okay, let's use only not binance smart chain.
01:32:30.922 - 01:32:32.978, Speaker D: Okay, let's use d five pulse as the oracle.
01:32:32.994 - 01:32:35.640, Speaker B: Unless they added that. They added it. Then we'll count it.
01:32:40.570 - 01:32:44.358, Speaker D: I think we will hit 80 billion. Yeah, 80 billion by end of the year.
01:32:44.524 - 01:32:45.278, Speaker A: 80 billion.
01:32:45.314 - 01:32:52.602, Speaker D: So just a little less. That's not very bullish. Okay, let's do 100 billion, double. Okay.
01:32:52.656 - 01:32:53.942, Speaker B: Got to be a bullish prediction.
01:32:54.006 - 01:32:55.462, Speaker A: Give us price of ETh.
01:32:55.606 - 01:33:07.226, Speaker D: Price of ETh. I think it's very possible we will hit. Can I give a range?
01:33:07.338 - 01:33:08.106, Speaker A: Yeah, give a range.
01:33:08.138 - 01:33:10.820, Speaker D: Absolutely. Please. Yeah, I think 5000.
01:33:11.910 - 01:33:12.418, Speaker A: Wow.
01:33:12.504 - 01:33:14.530, Speaker B: All right. Retaken new highs.
01:33:14.950 - 01:33:18.818, Speaker A: Do you guys hold ETh? Is that part of the d five portfolio or is that.
01:33:18.904 - 01:33:49.678, Speaker D: Yes, we hold if because if is money. And if it's a major asset within the D five space, we hold it a lot of time to provide liquidity to the protocol that we are supporting because most of the pair, even with the dominance of stablecoin, are still against for, let's say, for balancer, it's against if. And for a lot of the other liquidity provision we do, it's all against if. So we always hold if in our fund for various reasons and also from an investment reason as well.
01:33:49.764 - 01:33:54.094, Speaker B: Gotta hold it here first. Eth is money, and not the first.
01:33:54.132 - 01:34:15.990, Speaker A: Time you've heard it here. You definitely heard it here first. Well, Arthur, it has been an absolute pleasure to chat with you.
