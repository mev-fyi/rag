00:00:00.170 - 00:00:10.090, Speaker B: Whatever you do, it always looks like you're having fun, and everything you do also feels like mostly true, very human. Is that a through line? Is that something you've striven for? Is that just part of your nature?
00:00:10.170 - 00:00:36.902, Speaker A: I think it's the latter. I think it's a part of my nature. I guess you got to dig up the old content from like five and six, grinding it out, founding Reddit to see if I still have the same vibes. But I think so. The advice I find myself giving ceos is to think of communication on the Internet just as you would communication offline. That's sort of like the ideal party host is someone who's not there talking about themselves but helping connect good people and starting good conversations in good times. And that's so much of it.
00:00:36.902 - 00:00:49.300, Speaker A: And I think I've been fortunate because creating Reddit was probably not just a great outcome for me professionally, but it also set the stage for all the things that are most valuable now in web 316 years later.
