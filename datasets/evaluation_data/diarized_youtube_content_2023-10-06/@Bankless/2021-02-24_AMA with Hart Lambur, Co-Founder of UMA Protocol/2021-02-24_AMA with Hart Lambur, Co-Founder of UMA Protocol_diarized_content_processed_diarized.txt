00:00:13.510 - 00:00:14.460, Speaker A: Okay, we're good.
00:00:15.870 - 00:00:29.146, Speaker B: Bankless nation, welcome to this community. Ask me anything. We've got Hart Lambert here from the UMA protocol. This is a synthetics protocol. We're super excited to bring him here today. Some quick logistics. Of course.
00:00:29.146 - 00:00:42.498, Speaker B: This is a community. Ask me anything. So you guys feel free to ask questions. We will try to bring those questions into the conversation. You can ask them on YouTube. You can ask them in the bankless members only discord. We're making a change.
00:00:42.498 - 00:01:01.302, Speaker B: We usually do these on Thursdays around 12:00 p.m.. Eastern. We are now doing them on Wednesdays at 12:00 p.m.. Eastern. So, quick change. I think we're doing it the second and fourth Wednesday of every month. So this is the fourth Wednesday of the month of February, and we're bringing this to you here.
00:01:01.302 - 00:01:03.400, Speaker B: David, how are you doing, man?
00:01:03.770 - 00:01:28.890, Speaker A: Super awesome. I've always been curious as to what the spiel behind UMa is. Right. It's one of the few protocols that I haven't really done a deep dive into myself. So I'm really excited to get Hart on here to answer some of my questions. And then, of course, also the community questions as well. I know that a lot of these viewers for these amas are on periscope, right? Because it's just easy to see on Twitter.
00:01:28.890 - 00:01:55.340, Speaker A: But if you want to get your questions asked, go to the YouTube chat box. I'm monitoring the YouTube chat box. If you've ever seen me doing this, like, looking off to the left, it's because I'm trying to get your questions and relay them to heart. So that's what's going on always. The YouTube chat box is a really fun place to be when we do these live streams. And so get your questions in there as well. And of course, if you are a bankless premium subscriber, you can also put your questions into the bankless discord where we will prioritize those.
00:01:55.950 - 00:02:05.370, Speaker B: Absolutely. All right, well, before we get to Hart, we're going to introduce him in a moment, but first, we want to tell you about the fantastic sponsors who made this. Ask me anything possible.

00:04:19.770 - 00:04:44.160, Speaker B: Alright, guys, we are back with Hart Lambert, who's the co founder of the UMA protocol. This is a synthetic asset protocol on Ethereum. We've talked about synthetic assets in the past on the newsletter, various other places. We think it is absolutely massive, has absolutely massive potential within Defi. Hart, how are you doing? It's great to have you on bankless. Are you ready for the questions today?
00:04:45.170 - 00:04:51.906, Speaker C: It's great to be here and yeah, Ryan, David, I am ready for the questions and looking forward to chatting with you guys.
00:04:52.008 - 00:05:03.350, Speaker B: That is awesome. All right, so we got to clear this up, because you are a former Goldman Sachs person. So you spent some time in the belly of David. Didn't know.
00:05:03.420 - 00:05:04.710, Speaker A: I was not informed.
00:05:06.330 - 00:05:07.078, Speaker C: Tell us.
00:05:07.164 - 00:05:17.740, Speaker B: So what is it like being in the belly of the beast in Goldman Sachs for the time you spent there and then coming to Defi, what's that transition been like?
00:05:18.750 - 00:05:51.170, Speaker C: Well, I learned a. Okay, Ryan, I'm old for Defi, as we previously discussed, but I studied computer science in university, like the true nerd that I am. And honestly, when I graduated, I was in New York at the time. I'm canadian, and there's no startup jobs. There's no computer science jobs. When I graduated New York, startup scene has changed dramatically. The only place I could get a job was at a big bank.
00:05:51.170 - 00:06:19.210, Speaker C: That's actually how I ended up there. And I ended up as a bond trader through the financial crisis. So I was actually the guy trading government bonds when the Fed was doing all their buybacks. I was the guy at Goldman Sachs that was actually selling the Fed all the bonds from Goldman Sachs. It's like absolutely hilarious. And so I learned a lot around how markets work, how market structure works, and how people respond to incentives. That's just been really fascinating.
00:06:19.370 - 00:06:22.640, Speaker B: Did you learn how bailouts work during that time as well?
00:06:23.650 - 00:06:45.720, Speaker C: I did learn how bailouts work. I did learn a lot about monetary policy. I'm not actually sure you and I agree on all the macroeconomics here, but doesn't matter. I really learned a lot about how markets work, learned a lot about economics, learned a lot about incentive structures. And that set me up to play in DeFi. Really.
00:06:48.570 - 00:07:21.300, Speaker B: Like, what's different about DeFi versus kind of traditional finance? So a lot of people, I think in DeFi, it's honestly, they're learning finance through DeFi, which is somewhat incredible. I think that the best way to learn finance these days is to actually get into DeFi, start using these tools, because that's a crash course in financial history. But anyway, a lot of people entered finance listening to this through DeFi and don't know much about kind of the traditional financial world. What should they know about it? What are kind of the differences that you see?
00:07:22.550 - 00:08:11.330, Speaker C: Well, there's a lot of work. A lot of stuff has been invented in traditional finance. It's just completely unapproachable and completely unavailable to the average person. So the thing that I think is wild about DFI is it makes it possible for some 15 year old kid in his parents basement to create a financial product. That's a wild idea. It might be dangerous, by the way, there might be some rug pulls or some bad ideas that get created in those basements, but that approachability and accessibility is pretty fascinating. And if you think about it, like, when I first started at Goldman, I started right when structured products and cdos and all this stuff was kind of getting created or was booming, I should say.
00:08:11.330 - 00:08:48.058, Speaker C: And these were effectively financial products being engineered within these Wall street banks. And being engineered actually pretty badly within these Wall street banks. And DeFi now is like letting a whole other category of people tinker and build things. And I hope they're being built and engineered a lot better than that stuff was. But the approachability and the ability to actually write a financial contract in your parents basement, that is wild. And that just does open up finance to a whole different market for people to better understand it hart so let's.
00:08:48.074 - 00:09:15.190, Speaker A: Go into that a little bit more. I love that juxtaposition between financial products from the legacy world versus financial products in the Defi world. But let's talk about financial products and synthetic assets in the legacy world. What is this world like? And what are synthetic assets specifically in the legacy world, legacy financial system? How are these things built? How do they operate? Who uses them? Why are they useful?
00:09:16.090 - 00:10:05.640, Speaker C: Yeah, well, let's talk about maybe the concept of just a derivative, David so what is a derivative? What's the point? Why does it matter? A derivative is a financial contract, and in traditional finance, it's really a legal contract. And I'll actually come back to this analogy here, too, but it's a legal contract. So Ryan and I can make a legal contract where we're betting on something, and it could be the value of brazilian equities, the brazilian stock market. And I'm picking the brazilian stock market right now because it's actually like Ryan's in the US. It's actually really difficult for him to buy the brazilian stock market because of regulations and rules or whatever else. But Ryan doesn't really care about actually owning the brazilian stocks. He just cares about betting on whether they go up or down.
00:10:05.640 - 00:11:04.090, Speaker C: He just wants the exposure. So if you are a hedge fund or whatever, what you do is you go and you write a legal contract called a derivative with an investment bank that gives you access to this type of risk. And you can now sidestep the fact that this hedge fund can't actually buy brazilian equities because it's difficult to do so. Instead, they can buy the price exposure of brazilian equities through this derivative contract. And so call that a synthetic kind of exposure where they don't actually own brazilian equities directly, they own a legal contract that gives them exposure to brazilian equities. And so what has happened here is that hedge fund, rather than not being able to buy something, is able to use the synthetic asset to kind of bet on anything and to get price exposure on anything. And it makes finance for them global.
00:11:04.090 - 00:11:19.582, Speaker C: The problem is that Ryan's not a hedge fund and he can't get access to that as an the, there's not the resources. A Wall street bank won't write a derivative contract for a.
00:11:19.716 - 00:11:41.750, Speaker A: Because it's a permission system, right? Like Ryan doesn't have billions and billions of dollars on his bankroll. What are the other restrictions that prevent? Because I got my roommate downstairs. We like to talk about the future of finance. Why can't we just go create a contract between each other? And how is that different than perhaps a bigger, well capitalized institution making a contract?
00:11:42.810 - 00:12:17.418, Speaker C: Well, you and your buddy probably could create a contract for each. Like David, let's say you're in the state of California. The two, you guys could write down on a piece of paper a legal agreement, what that thing is, and say, hey, we want to do this. And you could probably. You could do that. But what's your enforcement mechanism there? I guess you could go and sue your buddy in the state of California if he doesn't pay up on your derivative contract, which would be hilarious. But there's sort of a barrier to entry.
00:12:17.418 - 00:12:56.026, Speaker C: You better write like a multi million dollar contract in order for it to be worth it to sue the guy. So it's the same reason why Ryan won't have access to the derivative markets that a hedge fund does, because he's just not a big enough fish to go after the enforcement mechanism. This legal enforcement mechanism only works at big scale for huge entities writing these contracts. Defi and frankly, what we're doing is designed to change that, to make that be accessible at a much more approachable, like a much lower entry point. Lower the barrier to entry.
00:12:56.138 - 00:13:33.142, Speaker B: David, I think it's bad news for roommate relations to write derivatives with your roommate. Maybe not. But I've got a question, and this is like a big picture question, because when you talk about terms like derivatives, hart I want to make sure people understand this. I think a lot of people have seen this graphic. Have you seen this? Hart it's like money around the world, right? And this is comparing the world's money in markets, 2020. And it's very visual, right? So each size square is worth a billion dollars. So you've got silver here, $100 billion with one square.
00:13:33.142 - 00:13:37.974, Speaker B: And then you've got the size of cryptocurrency, and then you've got, like, military spending and it sizes.
00:13:38.022 - 00:13:45.882, Speaker A: That cryptocurrency metric needs to get significantly updated because it says it's $244,000,000,000. This was made a while ago. Yeah.
00:13:45.936 - 00:13:48.670, Speaker B: So I guess add like, eight blocks or so, whatever.
00:13:48.740 - 00:13:49.166, Speaker A: Right?
00:13:49.268 - 00:14:03.650, Speaker B: But it's, like, close. All right, so then you've got us budget deficit on you go. And you got billionaires. How much they own. Then you've got, how much for gold? 8 trillion. 10 trillion in this calculation, 11 trillion. Fortune 500.
00:14:03.650 - 00:14:07.650, Speaker B: Anyway, you get all the way down. You pass global debt. You pass real estate.
00:14:08.310 - 00:14:09.614, Speaker A: Global wealth, real estate.
00:14:09.662 - 00:14:25.526, Speaker B: Holy shit. Going past real estate, which is huge. Okay? Real estate is how big is real estate? That's before global debt. I don't know. I missed real estate. It's somewhere in here. Then you've got global wealth, but then you've got this big thing at the end, which I think is the stunner, which is derivatives.
00:14:25.526 - 00:14:54.260, Speaker B: Okay? If all that other stuff, real estate, stocks, global debt, you thought that was big. You get to the end of this graph infographic, and you see derivatives, and it's like 560,000,000,000,000 worth of global money is in derivatives. And you keep scrolling down. It takes a whole bunch of scrolls to see all of the value in derivatives. Can you explain that? Is this good? Is this healthy? Is this how markets work? Or is there a real problem here?
00:14:56.150 - 00:15:37.754, Speaker C: This sort of stuff is a bit of a misnomer because you have a lot of offsetting risk. So, Ryan, you and I make a billion dollar derivative where you're going long bitcoin, and then you unwind it later. But you don't actually unwind that trade. You just do a derivative in the opposite direction for a billion dollars. So now we've got a $2 billion derivatives outstanding. And the way the derivatives market has evolved, there's just all of this offsetting risk, which, by the way, part of the problem here, part of the problem in the financial crisis, is that nobody actually really had a good picture of that offsetting risk because it wasn't written down in one place.
00:15:37.812 - 00:15:41.102, Speaker A: And was the issue was that it wasn't actually offsetting correctly.
00:15:41.166 - 00:16:43.334, Speaker C: Was that the issue or people didn't know what was offsetting? Right. People, like, there was sort of just like, oh, I think I was actually on the Goldman Sachs derivative trading desk on, like, when Lehman's blowing up. And Goldman doesn't really know what risk they have to Lehman brothers. They kind of think they know. But it's like when you've got numbers like that, if you're off by a little bit, it could be like billions and billions of dollars, right? And so, frankly, there's a whole other thing where if you had a blockchain and you had all those derivatives written on a blockchain, where somebody could actually go and look at, really articulate precisely what the risk was. That, to me, reduces systemic risk a lot. This is a whole other conversation, right? But this is where I think DFI is going and why, I think, going back to what I was saying earlier in 2006, when people were inventing CDo cubes or whatever, there was not a lot of transparency into what the underlying risk of those products were.
00:16:43.334 - 00:17:02.378, Speaker C: If you put them on a blockchain, it's a hell of a lot safer because people independently can see, like, okay, here's what this thing is. And so to me, finance is meant for a blockchain. Like, finance and what people's contracts are should be written on a blockchain because it provides a lot more transparency into where things are going.
00:17:02.464 - 00:17:51.110, Speaker A: This is a big conversation that I've had with a number of bitcoiners, is that bitcoiners will point at DeFi and be like, look at all that risk. Look at that composability risk. Like, if Makerdao goes down, the whole thing goes down. We're just going to recreate the financial crisis. And that's never made sense to me because I would say that financialization and financial tools can be dangerous. I think Warren Buffett has this quote that finance could create weapons of mass destruction. But I totally see that there's a fundamental difference that when everything is done in an inside out fashion and everyone has equal access to information, and that information is actually consumable, that is what prevents something like an eight crisis, right? It's like we just didn't have the information because people only had a very narrow view of what they were able to see, and no one could have the big picture.
00:17:51.110 - 00:18:06.030, Speaker A: And now we have things like dune analytics and the graph, which lets us help us consume data. And that, I think, is really the fundamental difference that if we had Ethereum as a financial platform, the eight crisis wouldn't have happened. How does that land with you, Hart?
00:18:07.030 - 00:18:41.626, Speaker C: I agree, man. Listen, this is a controversial statement, and some people will push back on it, but at a minimum, you take these mortgage backed securities that blew up in 2008 and the reason why they blew up is nobody knew what was behind them. Nobody knew what was in these mortgage backed securities, right? They had to basically trust some bank or then some credit agency. And those guys didn't know either. It was bad. Think of trust. Actually here, there was too much trust baked into the creator of these products that couldn't be verified as to what it was.
00:18:41.626 - 00:19:07.006, Speaker C: And so if instead that structure, if you were to make, imagine a sort of ethereum based version of it, there's some wrapper that includes a bunch of loans, but you can actually go and look at those individual loans on the blockchain and you can verify with yourself trustlessly what's happening there. That is so much so. I agree, David, you have the ability.
00:19:07.038 - 00:20:04.150, Speaker B: To view source on financial tools and financial products, which is super powerful. Before I get off the infographic, one other question I have heart is this. So if you scan the infographic and you look at traditional finance, the other thing that kind of jumps out at me is the base money. The reserve assets are relatively small and then the derivative assets are absolutely massive. So like multiples of the reserve base money assets, right? So you've got kind of your layer one m, one money that's tiny, and then everything built on top gets bigger and bigger and bigger until you get derivatives and they are the biggest of all, over 500 trillion. Do you expect the same thing to play out in this new financial system that we're building in DeFi, where you have a relatively small kind of base money reserve asset and then you've got things built on top. But derivatives are the biggest from a notional value perspective of all.
00:20:04.150 - 00:20:05.800, Speaker B: Does that play out here too?
00:20:06.570 - 00:21:06.874, Speaker C: Yeah, I just don't know. If you call them derivatives, there might just be something different. There's room for new shit to get invented. But like Ryan, I do agree that what you will see at some level is like a base asset, a reserve asset, which ETH is money, right? So we'll make it ETH. But you have a base asset and it gets used in all these ways that then the notional value builds up and you're already seeing that happening in DeFi, where your base asset is ETH, which is used to create Dai, and then you take the ETH dai pair and that can be used as collateral to take something else. You're already beginning to see this happening, and I think that is the nature of finance. With leverage and debt happening, that's just the way it works hart let's get.
00:21:06.912 - 00:21:27.070, Speaker A: Into some of the more specific details about UMA and I think a lot of listeners, there are mental models around. Synthetic assets will probably begin with synthetics, which uses chainlink oracles to come to a consensus about what the price of an asset is. What is the UMA model for producing a synthetic?
00:21:28.310 - 00:22:10.670, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the mental model to think about here, I actually want to think of it as almost a primitive that we're putting forward. And if you go back to the early days of maker, where maker was single collateral die, where it would only had ETH in it, what happened there? You took ETH, and let's make it wrapped eth, let's call it an ERC 20 asset. You took Eth as a collateral, and you created a derivative token, a synthetic token, Dai, that was deemed to be worth. There's a payout function. It was deemed to be worth a dollar of eth. That was what dyes were supposed to be worth. They're supposed to be backed.
00:22:10.670 - 00:23:29.206, Speaker C: What we've built is effectively a generalized version of that concept, where we call it a synthetic token that takes an ERC 20 collateral and takes a payout function, and creates a synthetic token, a derivative token, that is some amount of that underlying collateral, as defined by this payout function. And so this is actually a surprisingly powerful primitive, because we can do all kinds of crazy things where we convert or transform one ERC 20 asset into another. The difference to point out, because you mentioned synthetics, synthetics has just a very different model, where they have a pool, a debt pool, that's everybody staking their SNX to create this debt pool. And out of that debt pool, they allow users to buy synthetic assets. So all synthetic assets in the synthetics platform are collateralized or backed by this single debt pool. Whereas what we're doing, what we've proposed, is it's actually much more of a component. It's a single primitive that an ERC 20 asset goes into this contract to mint a derivative token according to some payout function.
00:23:29.388 - 00:23:57.920, Speaker A: So, there's a big criticism of the synthetics model is this systemic risk conversation, where this one single pool of debt, if that doesn't work out, all synthetic assets crumble. The takeaway that I just got out from you, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that Uma, as a primitive, doesn't actually depend on one single pool of debt. It is more modular between the input asset and the output asset. Is that correct?
00:23:58.770 - 00:24:25.130, Speaker C: Yeah, that is mean. Again, I think I actually have a lot of respect for the synthetics platform and all that, just to be very clear. And I think they're doing really fascinating stuff and the whole defi ecosystem should be thankful to a lot of their innovations and the way they push things forward. So say that clearly. But yeah, there is a pooled risk approach here. That is true for other platforms, like compound has the same issue. Compound.
00:24:25.130 - 00:25:00.840, Speaker C: If any asset fails, the whole thing fails. There's similar arguments that can be made to some of these other pooled platforms. David, what we're kind of producing is more, we really think of it as a developer infrastructure. So developer can come to us and take our contract, take our primitive, and say, I'm going to segregate this pool where I'm going to create a synthetic asset that's backed by just this one ERC 20 in its own sort of segregated pool. And that has pros and cons. It's kind of got its own different use case.
00:25:02.650 - 00:25:45.954, Speaker B: I think there's one kind of takeaway here is if you're listening, and this is kind of your first exposure to synthetics. The magic moment for me in understanding it was back to Hart's example of die. Like once I wrapped my head around dai and understood that, then I started to understand what a synthetic is. And it's basically if you take an ERC 20, like a store of value, right? Whether that store of value is wrapped bitcoin or ether, or whether that's USDC. So you take a store of value and you combine that with an oracle, like so with a price feed. Store value plus price feed in a smart contract platform equals anything. You could create anything you want out of it.
00:25:45.954 - 00:26:28.194, Speaker B: You could create s and P 500. You could create like gold, silver, any commodity, any asset, anything that has value. The art on David's wall, anything, basically. So that to me is why this synthetic primitive is so powerful, because we have a lot of store value ERC 20 assets, right? And we've made a lot of strides forward to create great oracle solutions. Now we have even arguably more decentralized oracle solutions like the uniswap twap. And now we can create anything. And by the way, this is the notion, if you've been following bankless for a while, the notion of why economic bandwidth is so important.
00:26:28.194 - 00:26:50.374, Speaker B: What we mean when we say economic bandwidth is just the market cap and the liquidity of that store of value asset. And it can be know centralized like a USDC, or it can be more trustless like Eth. But anyway, that's the combination. Store of value plus oracle equals any kind of asset that you want. Is that a good way to think about it?
00:26:50.572 - 00:27:20.002, Speaker C: I love that. I'm going to steal it and use it, Ryan. But it's alchemy, right? It is alchemy where you're taking store of value ERC 20 asset plus price feed to any other thing. And it actually probably segues nicely into what our oracle solution is, which I'm not even sure you guys have. Like, we're pretty quiet about, or it's a bit under the radar, a bit more nerdy. But we have this whole philosophy on how to. We've written something.
00:27:20.002 - 00:28:35.740, Speaker C: We're going to label this the optimistic oracle. Our whole solution to this is to not rely on a price feed, but to actually try to create these things where we only need a price if there's a dispute. And I can go into a bit more detail, but this priceless methodology that we've adopted, this optimistic oracle, allows us to essentially create a price feed for anything, which if you take it back to your model of what you just described, if we have store of value. So ERC 20 asset plus price feed for anything, it literally lets us create a derivative or synthetic asset for anything. And this is where I think the ability to create new shit, to actually dream up assets that didn't otherwise exist, suddenly becomes possible. So if we wanted to make a price feed, if the price feed for anything could be the number of subscribers to your YouTube channel. Right? All of a sudden we can make a synthetic asset that actually tracks the value of the number of subscribers to your YouTube channel.
00:28:35.740 - 00:28:40.362, Speaker C: And I think this becomes super interesting and kind of fun.
00:28:40.496 - 00:29:21.430, Speaker B: Yeah, it's basically back to that kid in the basement. That kid in the basement can go create a synthetic of anything of value and then go trade it in this platform. That's the magic of it. The other magic of it, I think, is when we're talking about DeFi, permissionless, open, decentralized finance, this is what solves the could. Like, rather than Robinhood stopping trading on GameStop, we can create these synthetic assets in ways that they really can't be stopped by a centralized intermediary. So that's powerful, too. Okay, so I got to confess though, Hart, I don't fully understand the priceless oracle thing, and I'm not sure we have the time to get into the technical.
00:29:21.430 - 00:29:41.280, Speaker B: Like, I have my head wrapped around what Chainlink does. I understand that all of these various oracle. I understand that. I understand Uniswap's oracle at a decent level, but how is your priceless oracle different? Is there like an explain it like I'm five just for that?
00:29:41.650 - 00:30:23.306, Speaker C: Yeah. The way to think about this is we're enforcing our contract optimistically and you can actually think like, frankly, a lot of the thought process came from conversations we had with plasma group, which is now the optimistic team. And optimistic rollups like same concepts here. The goal here is let's minimize oracle usage. Let's only use the oracle if there's a genuine dispute, effectively in L2, like an exit game. And the way to think about this is actually more like a traditional legal contract back to David's derivative agreement that he wrote with his roommate. Right.
00:30:23.306 - 00:31:04.460, Speaker C: In that derivative agreement, David wrote with his roommate. This legal contract, you hope you don't have to sue the other person to enforce it. Your goal is to not go to court and litigate this thing. Your goal is just that you only use court as an enforcement mechanism so that, wait, if you don't follow the terms of the contract, I will sue you. The very high level understanding for our optimistic oracle is the same concept where we don't use the oracle in 99% of the cases. And actually it's more than that. We only use the oracle to get a price if there is a dispute in what happened.
00:31:05.230 - 00:31:55.398, Speaker A: Okay, so this seems like there could be some efficiencies here because you guys have removed the oracles, but the oracles are still there in the backstop. Right. So it's the threat of the oracles in the background that makes the incentives for people to follow the rules in the first place. And I would imagine Maker Dow, I heard this crazy stat from somebody who works at the maker Dow team where they are spending 20,000, $30,000 a day in gas fees to constantly update the oracles on the ethereum. L1, that's inefficient. That's a crazy number, right? We could be doing other things with that capital. And so I think what you are doing is what you are saying is like, well, we'll have the oracles, but we won't use them because we are going to give the option for participants to settle between themselves as they agreed.
00:31:55.398 - 00:32:07.150, Speaker A: And if somebody defects from that agreement, then we will do the more expensive stuff, which is bring in the oracles. And that's like kind of quote unquote, bring in the courts. Right. Bring in the judges, bring in the lawyers.
00:32:08.050 - 00:32:30.920, Speaker C: That's exactly right. David. And I think the maker examples this is part of our path to thinking here was exactly that. So maker is pushing all these prices to the blockchain every 510 minutes or whatever they're doing all this. And most of those prices aren't being used for any liquidation. They aren't being used for anything. They just have to be there.
00:32:30.920 - 00:32:51.994, Speaker C: And then you have liquidations that happen. That happen pretty rarely. So our design, or kind of simplifying it, is like, okay, when a liquidation happens, you have a keeper. Same in the maker system. You have a keeper say, hey, I'm going to liquidate this position. But there's no on chain price feed. They just say, I'm going to liquidate this position now.
00:32:51.994 - 00:33:34.998, Speaker C: And the only difference we do here is we let that liquidation go through, but we don't pay the keeper their reward for a two hour period. It's a parameter of our system. We don't pay them their reward for that period. And if anyone during that period disputes that liquidation, then it goes to the oracle. That's basically for dispute resolution. And because of the economic design here, because a liquidator, if they do a bad liquidation, loses a lot of money. We've actually designed this where to date, in the sort of six months less than that, but five months that this design has been live, we've only had one dispute, one genuine dispute.
00:33:34.998 - 00:34:16.790, Speaker C: We've tested it, and basically this optimistic enforcement has actually worked really effectively. And so it's very efficient in terms of a gas cost thing. But the other thing that makes it really cool is we can be an oracle for a lot more things, for pretty much anything. We don't need to. Going back to the example of, if we wanted to make a token with the number of subscribers to your YouTube channel, you guys couldn't do that right now in this current gas environment, if you had to push an oracle update for the number of subscribers to your YouTube channel on chain, that would just be too costly for you to do. The other advantage to this approach is that it lets us do things like that because disputes are so rare.
00:34:18.090 - 00:34:58.180, Speaker A: One thing I want to ask is, the threat of the oracles in the background is what keeps people aligned. And this makes sense to me when I'm reminded of our episode with Justin Drake not too long ago where he didn't coin anything, but I would like to say he coined this rule, this law that I call Drake's razor, where if you can use cryptography, use cryptography, and if cryptography fails, use crypto economics. And this seems to be saying, like, okay, we'll just use the protocol, and if there's a dispute, then we'll turn to crypto economics. Right. My question is that two hour window of that dispute window. That is nice. That makes sense.
00:34:58.180 - 00:35:21.740, Speaker A: And maybe this is kind of missing some of the design here. But 2 hours is a long time for liquidations, but kind of a short time for humans, right? Like, I sleep 8 hours a night, or I at least try to get my 8 hours a night's sleep. What if somebody tries to liquidate me in those 2 hours while I'm asleep? What's up with that? How do we get the assurances there? Where do the crypto economics come in?
00:35:22.430 - 00:35:47.282, Speaker C: Yeah, that's where this crypto network is so awesome. Right? Because, David, we can design this. So if you have a position, you get badly liquidated. You get liquidated when you shouldn't have been. We don't need you to dispute that. We need just somebody that's watching the network to dispute it. And as long as we can pay that dispute or a legitimate, appropriate reward, they show up.
00:35:47.282 - 00:36:19.570, Speaker C: People respond to economic incentives. So while you're asleep, if you get unfairly liquidated, some guy in Hong Kong should be the guy being like, okay, I'm going to dispute David's liquidation here, the guy that liquidated David here, because he shouldn't have been liquidated, and I'm going to get a reward for doing so. And so the idea is that you have this network where all these eyes all over the globe are watching these transactions to make sure they're appropriately followed and they're responding purely to economic consensus.
00:36:19.670 - 00:36:30.610, Speaker B: I'm going to slip a quick youtuber question in here because I think it's relevant right now. Somebody watching on YouTube is asking, we recently wrote an article about Keeperdao. Are you familiar with Keeperdao cart?
00:36:31.030 - 00:36:35.154, Speaker C: I am familiar. Not like super deep. I think it's really interesting.
00:36:35.272 - 00:36:44.840, Speaker B: Are they an entity that can provide some of the liquidations that you were just talking about, the kind of a keeper entity? Are they doing that or are they the type of entity that would do that?
00:36:46.970 - 00:37:11.418, Speaker C: Yes, the type of entity. No, they're not doing it right now, but we've talked to them, and I would like entities like that to do this. And again, it kind of goes right into this whole idea of, like, they'd be one of these network. It's like out there in the ether, pun intended, that's monitoring these contracts to make sure they're appropriately followed.
00:37:11.594 - 00:37:40.600, Speaker B: Okay, so you've got this synthetics protocol, this primitive that you've built out. Can we get into a few examples of this, of how people are building it? So you've got 63 million total locked value in contracts on UmA, 21 million of synthetic tokens that have been minted using UMA and nine projects. Can you give us Highlight a few examples of how Uma is being created and what synthetics are coming out on the other side?
00:37:41.530 - 00:37:47.930, Speaker C: Yeah, those numbers are actually all scale. We don't have that being updated live yet. That's something that's happening in the next week or two.
00:37:48.080 - 00:37:50.090, Speaker B: You could pull that right from the blockchain.
00:37:50.830 - 00:38:20.374, Speaker C: I know it's embarrassing. So they're higher than that. But yeah, I can talk about the types of things that have been created that I find really interesting. And again, guys, the part that I push here, we are trying to position Uma like our infrastructure as being this platform to create these synthetic assets. We're not creating them ourselves. And we want to make it super easy for a developer that comes up with an idea. And developer might even be the wrong word.
00:38:20.374 - 00:39:11.240, Speaker C: It's like a financial product inventor that comes up with an idea. We want to make it super easy for them to go and create that thing. And so stuff that's been created, fixed term loans, we'll call these like yield dollars or zero coupon bonds where I take Ethereum or I take wrap. Bitcoin, that's my collateral and I want to create a synthetic token that's worth a dollar at some future date. So, okay, I've just built a lending platform based on this asset. What the badger Dow community is doing is taking this concept in a wild direction where the badger dow guys have all of these vault tokens. So people that have.
00:39:11.240 - 00:39:38.890, Speaker C: My favorite example is like the Badger WBTC eth sushi token. So you're providing liquidity on WBTC ETH and then you're staking it in badger to earn badger tokens and you've got this vault token that is an illiquid asset. Well, what if you use that as collateral in a synthetic asset to mint a yield dollar token? A token that's worth a dollar at Xbiry.
00:39:39.330 - 00:39:39.786, Speaker B: Shit.
00:39:39.818 - 00:40:26.510, Speaker C: I've just used my illiquid asset and I've transformed it using this alchemy process into something usable that I can now get leverage or borrow against, which is kind of cool. So that's one thing I'm going too deep here. Project teams are creating a bitcoin dominance tracker so I can buy a token that tracks bitcoin dominance. As bitcoin dominance goes up or down, I make money. Same with altcoin dominance. I think this is a super interesting financial product to bet in a market neutral way on whether the long tail of crypto assets is going to do better or worse. Somebody created a bitcoin cash synthetic on Ethereum.
00:40:26.510 - 00:40:36.734, Speaker C: I shouldn't say anything too controversial to bitcoin cash. I don't know why people care about this, but someone wanted to say controversial.
00:40:36.782 - 00:40:38.082, Speaker A: Things about bitcoin cash.
00:40:38.216 - 00:40:39.220, Speaker B: Yeah, it's fine.
00:40:42.390 - 00:40:43.140, Speaker C: Okay.
00:40:44.310 - 00:41:17.200, Speaker B: It's pretty amazing because it's a blank canvas. Anyone can create anything they want, but where would someone get access to, like, let's say I wanted to bet against bitcoin dominance. Not saying I do, but let's say I did. Where would I go do that? Because there's no UmA protocol where it's all website know where it lists sort of all of the different assets from just this, just available in the rest of kind of the defi infrastructure. Like, I'd go to uniswap and find that. Or is there one central location where all of these synthetics are.
00:41:19.010 - 00:42:03.020, Speaker C: Mean? Ryan, that's kind of like a good. I don't know the answer to that. I don't know if we, like, should we have a centralized page that lists everything that's been created with our protocol? Maybe that seems like a good idea. That seems like something we should build. If you wanted to bet against bitcoin dominance, you can buy an altcoin dominance token right now on domination finance, which is using our infrastructure behind the scenes. There's sort of an open question here, just for us as a project, where how loud do we want to be versus behind the scenes? Stripe doesn't list every merchant using the stripe platform to process credit card payments. Right.
00:42:03.020 - 00:42:17.940, Speaker C: But we might be different. Maybe we are supposed to list everybody that's building synthetic assets. It's kind of an open question that I don't know. And discoverability does matter, so you make a good point. Maybe we should have a page where. Here's everything you can buy.
00:42:18.470 - 00:42:33.094, Speaker A: Hart, I want to know where liquidity comes from in the system. Right. We earlier talked about a potential synthetic asset that tracks the bankless subscribers. Right. And I would be bullish on such an asset. Right, but doesn't that mean that.
00:42:33.132 - 00:42:35.106, Speaker B: I'm glad to hear you say that, David.
00:42:35.298 - 00:42:51.340, Speaker A: No, super bearish not going anywhere. But if I buy into an asset that tracks bankless subscribers on the YouTube, does that mean that somebody needs to take the opposite side of that? Like, where does the liquidity come from? How does this work?
00:42:52.930 - 00:43:13.214, Speaker C: Yeah, so, David, this is where amms are mind blowing and are the future. And guys like this is, again, coming from a guy that was a market maker at Goldman Sachs for like a decade. Screw that. Amms are the future because of this long tail?
00:43:13.262 - 00:43:13.474, Speaker A: Right?
00:43:13.512 - 00:43:16.354, Speaker B: It's long tail mean.
00:43:16.392 - 00:44:16.226, Speaker C: Like, listen, so right now the answer is that to make these synthetic assets usable, they need to be put in a uniswap pool, or Amm pool that has reasonable liquidity. Right now that's actually pretty capital intensive. It takes a lot of capital to create a uniswap pool that has decent liquidity around this stuff. But I have a lot of faith that's going to change, be it in future versions of what balancer and Uniswap are doing, or we've got some other half baked ideas too on how to make this stuff be a lot more capital efficient. But really, the Amm idea and the fact that there's people out there that now get it, they're like, oh, look, I can be a liquidity provider and earn fees by being this market maker, and I might get short. I might sort of sell an asset that I otherwise like, but I'm getting paid to do so. This is like a core concept that is frankly making, I think, these long tail synthetic assets usable.
00:44:16.226 - 00:44:36.554, Speaker C: So your core question, David, you're right. Like right now, your YouTube channel subscriber, it's a bit costly. Like, you'd have to actually put a lot of capital in to make this subscriber token liquid. But I think that's going to get better, easier, and easier and easier and less capital intensive in the near future.
00:44:36.672 - 00:45:20.710, Speaker A: Okay, so I would just like to summarize, and again, I want to compare and contrast the UMA model with the synthetics model. The synthetics model people really appreciate because they have infinite liquidity on any asset, because they have this massive debt pool, which means liquidity can come from anything. But there's also that conversation of like, well, the commitment to infinite liquidity is also a commitment to systemic risk, right? So, like, bullish and bearish at the same time. UMA strips out that mass, like that unified liquidity debt pool. And so it doesn't have infinite liquidity for everything, but it also doesn't have any systemic risk. Right. So that means that it's not just enough to make a synthetic asset, you need to also create liquidity.
00:45:20.710 - 00:45:26.560, Speaker A: Right. So just because you can create an asset doesn't mean that it's liquid. Right. So it's a two part process, is that correct?
00:45:27.410 - 00:45:55.586, Speaker C: That's spot on, and I think that's exactly right. So right now, in order to make. You can make a synthetic asset right now on pretty much anything, but then you got to make it usable. Right? And making it usable requires making it liquid. Right? So I agree with your two step process, and I'd also agree that the second part of this process right now, that's where I think making it less capital intensive to make it liquid makes that two step process easier and easier and easier.
00:45:55.698 - 00:46:18.350, Speaker B: It's the other difference between synthetics, that UMA is a bit more like blank canvas in that it's permissionless. I could create whatever synthetic I want, whereas with synthetics they kind of add different synthetic listings over time onto their platform. But synthetics, you could just build anything. It's kind of permissionless.
00:46:19.650 - 00:46:48.118, Speaker C: That reasoning goes back to the oracle, goes back, Ryan, to your bit of store of value, ERC 20 plus price feed. So synthetics is limited. Synthetics is limited by price feeds. They need a chain link price feed for something. So that has to exist. And also then I guess, financial engineering concerns around their debt pool and the risk they're doing. But chain link, there aren't chain link price seeds for anything.
00:46:48.118 - 00:47:25.966, Speaker C: And in the current Ethereum gas environment, there couldn't be. It would be too costly for sure. And even if you didn't have this gas environment, you still need, that's still different. And also, by the way, I'm fan of Chainlink and a lot of what they do, and there's real use in having, call it like the fat head assets being pushed on chain, like the eth dollar price should be on chain for people to use. That makes a lot of sense. But the long tail stuff, this is where you get more constrained. So there's just pros and cons to all these different approaches.
00:47:25.966 - 00:47:41.030, Speaker C: And I think, as you pointed out, this is a very big market and it's all symbiotic, right? So different approaches for different use cases that I think all jive together quite nicely.
00:47:41.690 - 00:48:03.150, Speaker A: So one thing we've noticed ever since DeFi summer came around is that protocols are able to leverage their token to add liquidity to help bootstrap liquidity into their system. Is that something that the UMA, because UMA has a token, I believe it's called UMA. How does the UMA token integrate itself with the UMA protocol and does that help boost your liquidity?
00:48:05.090 - 00:48:36.140, Speaker C: Our token, our token holders are fundamentally the voters in the oracle. Our token holders are effectively the oracle that we try to minimize usage of, and we'll keep it at a high level for that. And then separately, David, to your point, we are using our token in liquidity mining campaigns and we actually have a pretty interesting program we call developer mining. But we are using our token to help incentivize liquidity in these pools to help make the assets be more liquid or.
00:48:39.870 - 00:49:17.880, Speaker B: Yeah, can we talk about developer mining for just 1 second? Because that's a theme we talk about a lot on bankless, which is Dave and I like to joke that we work for algorithms and protocols, which we basically do, right, but there are more and more opportunities. We're talking to the graph not too long ago, maybe it's our AMA before last, and they talked about how success, all of the earning potential possibilities that existed within the graph protocol. So tell us about your developer mining. If I'm a developer, I want to do something for UMA protocol. Is there an opportunity for me?
00:49:18.730 - 00:50:03.218, Speaker C: Yeah. So first of all, high level question or not question statement. We are designing incentive structures. Like crypto is designing incentive structures. Ryan, to your point, we work for algorithms, we work for incentive structures here. And liquidity mining, like yield farming, is a fascinating incentive structure that has been proven super successful at getting liquidity into amms, call it. We wanted to take that concept and be like, okay, well, wait, we actually really want to incentivize developers with an idea for a product to come and build on our platform or build using our infrastructure.
00:50:03.218 - 00:50:38.066, Speaker C: And so we can actually do clever things like we can measure any new synthetic that gets created, how much value is minted in that synthetic, how popular? Quote unquote popular popularity measured by dollar value locked. How popular is that synthetic? And then what we can do is every week we can look at all the synthetics minted on our platform and be like, oh, this synthetic is, here's the popularity. Let's pay these guys rewards. Let's pay these developers rewards based on the popularity of their idea.
00:50:38.168 - 00:51:23.870, Speaker B: This is cool. Okay, when you say developers, what you mean is kind of this new class of financial engineers who's developing synthetics. And what's really cool about this is when we started to get Web 20, right, with Facebook and Instagram and everything that came after it created this whole new economy of people from their offices or from their homes, who would just generate content for what, for attention, for likes. That was kind of the currency. What you're talking about is essentially these kids in their houses or wherever they live, or anybody really being able to create synthetics. And the value of the synthetics that they create is based upon its usage. And you can actually earn an income that way.
00:51:23.870 - 00:51:39.380, Speaker B: Right now you have YouTube influencers. Basically, you could have synthetics creators as a full time hobby, maybe, maybe a very lucrative job, depending on the success of it. This is what you're talking.
00:51:40.230 - 00:52:28.434, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll Fred Ursim. I stole this idea from him a while ago. But so long tail. Long tail financial products, right? If you think of YouTube's like the unboxing video, something you could have never, right? And all this shit that happened because of user generated content. I do have a belief, and the timing of this is hard, but I do have this belief that we will have user generated financial products of a sort that are like this long tail of things that you wouldn't otherwise predict. And you're right, Ryan. I see there being a world where if people produce financial products or produce ideas that other people want, they can earn an income off of that.
00:52:28.434 - 00:52:50.540, Speaker C: I think that is a world we're going towards. And I don't quite know what it looks like, but I completely agree. It's part of our vision, right, that it's easy to create financial products, it's easy to build in defi we make kind of like building this defi stuff simple. And this new class of kids in their basement create interesting things that other people want.
00:52:51.230 - 00:53:29.510, Speaker A: Okay, guys, and everyone in the YouTube, this is the last call for listener youtuber questions. So if you have a question for Hart, get it into the chat box also like and subscribe. Hart, my question for you is no one can really predict the future of Uma better than you and the UMA team, right? And so when you guys are shooting the shit, eating lunch, like not really thinking about the future, what are some of the crazier things that you guys think about that you could do with? Like if you guys really went super deep and you're like, well, we could do this and then this. Give us an example of some really Sci-Fi type stuff that could happen out of Uma.
00:53:33.470 - 00:54:13.190, Speaker C: David, that's a good question. And I'm currently obsessed with thinking about this stuff. So we did our KPI options, right? We can create a synthetic token, like a project can create a synthetic token that pays out some amount of project tokens based on a project hitting their KPI. We announced this. I think it's a better type of incentive structure than many yield farming things out there too, because what you end up aligning the collect, you end up giving the community ownership in the success of a protocol. I think that's wild. And I think the types of ways you can expand that are pretty wild.
00:54:13.190 - 00:55:04.742, Speaker C: We can create all kinds of call options, a lot of different options, markets and structured notes, various sort of interesting payouts using the same primitive, the same synthetic. I've actually very recently realized we've only scratched the surface of what Ryan's alchemy, his example of store value like ERC 20 asset plus price feed equals big space. One of the things that is really mind bending that I'm recently thinking about is what if we were to create a synthetic asset collateralized by its own amm pool? This is recursive. It makes your head hurt a lot. But I think there's like wild things you could do there. There's lots of fun stuff. Basically.
00:55:04.742 - 00:55:10.120, Speaker C: I think we've got a lot of potential innovation coming.
00:55:10.810 - 00:55:55.030, Speaker B: I want to ask you. We're getting to kind of the close. Maybe there's some other questions we should ask. But, Hart, this has been kind of burning in my mind. So you started at Goldman, now you're fully down the Defi rabbit hole, right? You're all in here. So I guess my question is, why hasn't Wall street, why haven't other financial engineers in traditional finance discovered Defi? They love building financial products, don't they? Of course they do. Do they think you're crazy when you talk to them about this or when you keep in touch? Why aren't we seeing Wall street using UmA protocol to create all of these really cool derivatives?
00:55:55.850 - 00:56:22.810, Speaker C: So Ryan, they are, they're jealous. They want to be doing this. This is all they want to be. You know, my old boss at Goldman works with us now, works really closely, and is doing this just having a lot of fun. He wrote a blog post on creating structured notes using building all this stuff. He's having a lot of fun doing this. The difference here is the people want to play in defi.
00:56:22.810 - 00:57:01.100, Speaker C: I actually talked to a lot of Wall street people that are either looking for jobs in DeFi or want to transition to it or whatever else the institutions, like, having worked at Goldman Sachs, the institutions aren't going to move, man. They're going to get like. And we don't want them to move. You want Goldman Sachs to have its lunch eaten by like uniswap or something, right? And that will happen. I think that's just how technology evolves, where the people in the incumbent, in this case Wall street, will move to this new infrastructure and will build new entities, organizations, or whatever else that will eat the incumbents. And that's great.
00:57:03.170 - 00:57:13.214, Speaker A: So what's in store for the future of like, what's on your roadmap that we have to look forward to a lot.
00:57:13.412 - 00:58:19.400, Speaker C: So we're doing this KPI option thing and we're going to be doing our own version of it, where we are going to be airdropping tokens to people in our community and people that have been used governance in other communities, been active governors in other communities, we're going to airdrop them. An option that will increase in value the more RTVL goes up, which I think is pretty cool. We're pretty transparent. I think there's a cool idea for call options that we're going to put out in the near future. We're going to publish more loudly about our optimistic oracle which can be generalized for other use cases outside of just synthetic tokens and make that be kind of like a cool primitive that can be used for applications where you need a price feed on something weird, on kind of a price feed on anything. And then we have a perpetual synthetic token, which is a pretty hard financial engineering problem that is audited and ready to go. We're going to put an experiment, we're going to test that out.
00:58:19.400 - 00:58:24.038, Speaker C: So there's a lot. It's like we're pretty busy right now.
00:58:24.204 - 00:58:55.760, Speaker A: Uma as a platform, I'm reminded of that one famous Gif of the Microsoft people on stage going, developers, developers, developers. It sounds like you guys need a bunch of developers. So if we have any developers listening, I'm seeing some developers in the YouTube comments. How can they get started to go start playing around with Uma? Because interestingly, Uma seems to be not just a money Lego, but a money Lego factory. And it seems to really need money Lego developers to really build out money Lego structures. How can developers get started?
00:58:56.610 - 00:59:03.940, Speaker C: You guys are so good at the taglines and the marketing, right? I'm going to steal that. David, the money Lego factory. That's like good, man.
00:59:05.030 - 00:59:09.350, Speaker B: I think there's a job title in there too. Like money Lego designer.
00:59:10.330 - 00:59:33.950, Speaker C: Money Lego factory worker. Like a very blue collar title here. I like that a lot. So David, you're entirely want. And I actually doke back to that Steve Ballmer on stage being all sweaty going, developers, developers, developers. That is what we want to do. Best way is join our discord.
00:59:33.950 - 00:59:52.834, Speaker C: To start with discord umaproject.org and we need to do better documentation. We need to do all this other stuff, but join our discord, read our docs and yeah, chat with us basically. All right.
00:59:52.872 - 01:00:15.002, Speaker B: I want to see you replicating the Steve Balmer gift someday. Just getting up on a stage and screaming it. Make sure you feel the passion that bomber felt at that time. Man, this has been a lot of fun. I think. I didn't know a ton about Uma protocol going into this, but I feel like I know a ton coming out. Hart, thank you so much for spending time with us today.
01:00:15.002 - 01:00:16.218, Speaker B: We appreciate it.

01:00:58.284 - 01:01:50.418, Speaker A: Gemini is the world's most all right first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens, and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset.
01:01:50.418 - 01:02:41.042, Speaker A: When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH, so whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of ETH bonus back to me.

Gobankless Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol.
01:02:41.042 - 01:03:24.326, Speaker A: If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's v two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them.
