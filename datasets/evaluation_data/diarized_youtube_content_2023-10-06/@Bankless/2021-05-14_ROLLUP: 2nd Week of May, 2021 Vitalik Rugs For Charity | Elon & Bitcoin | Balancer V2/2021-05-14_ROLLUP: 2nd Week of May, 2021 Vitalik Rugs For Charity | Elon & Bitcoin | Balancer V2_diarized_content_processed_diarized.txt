00:00:07.850 - 00:00:13.710, Speaker A: Hey, guys. Happy Friday. It is the second week of May, and it's roll up time. David, how are you doing today?
00:00:13.860 - 00:00:23.066, Speaker B: Absolutely fantastic. In a different spot in the world this particular week of May. I'm in San Diego today, so that's why you see this different Airbnb background.
00:00:23.178 - 00:00:27.494, Speaker A: It's looking nice. Are you sure that's not a. A synthetic background? This is not a green screen.
00:00:27.532 - 00:00:42.170, Speaker B: This is not a green screen. No. This is a real place, a real physical place in the world. Funnily enough, I have all of my same equipment with me. I just brought it all down. But it's a new spot. Same equipment, same roll up, same weekly roll up that we are going to get into right now.
00:00:42.240 - 00:01:00.554, Speaker A: Well, David has gone portable. This is awesome. So if this is your first weekly roll up, we do markets, we do releases, we do news, then some takes. We talk about what we're excited about and stay tuned to the end for the meme of the week. I think we've got some special stuff on meme of the week. This comes at you every Friday. Check it out on YouTube.
00:01:00.554 - 00:01:24.434, Speaker A: That's the best place to view it. But also on the podcast if you are more audio inclined. Hopefully this comes at you in the morning for your morning coffee, so enjoy it on your Fridays. The best way to download the week that was in crypto. David, before we get into markets, we got to mention consensus invest. The conference is coming up. This is consensus 2020 Coinbase conference.
00:01:24.434 - 00:01:42.390, Speaker A: This is the big one, the big conference crypto conference to attend. And you know that because it's got some really fantastic people. It's got Ray Dalio, Brian Brooks from the OCC. David, who are some of the other people? Lyn Alden, I think I saw mentioned.
00:01:42.560 - 00:02:13.782, Speaker B: Yeah. And I'm actually speaking there twice. Not as big as Ray Dalio or Lyn Alden, but I have two talks that I'm talking about, talking about ultrasound money, and I think the evolution of the investment thesis of ether over time, starting with the triple point asset and kind of how that's gotten wrapped into ultrasound money, but also the state of DFI and under a panel of do we really need banks anyways, in the current state of the DFI ecosystem? So it can be a lot of really interesting conversations from a lot of very interesting people.
00:02:13.916 - 00:02:41.200, Speaker A: So the date on that, guys, is May 23. That's when you want to have your ticket before then so you can get access to that event. It's going to be a fantastic know. David, in previous years, consensus really hasn't had that much in terms of DeFi and Ethereum content, but I think that's totally changing this year, and it's really exciting. Along with kind of the narrative shift, we're getting a lot more bankless style content in consensus. So it's really exciting to see as.
00:02:41.570 - 00:03:11.410, Speaker B: Absolutely. And in previous years, Defi wasn't as big as a thing as it is now. And so this is actually going to be the first coindesk event where DeFi is really kind of a mainstream topic. And so I'm excited to see the conversations that come out of that, because it's always a place where different heads come together and sync with each other, sync each other's heads. And we get to get perspective from people that you wouldn't really typically get that perspective from them in other circumstances.
00:03:11.490 - 00:03:20.586, Speaker A: There's a link in the show note, guys, or you could go to bankless CC consensus 2021. Pick up that ticket. David, are you ready to get to the markets, man?
00:03:20.688 - 00:03:33.130, Speaker B: Absolutely, Ryan. I think this is going to be the hottest section of this weekly roll up because the markets are extremely hot, also up and down in direction. So many different things to talk about. So, yeah, let's go ahead and get right into markets.
00:03:33.210 - 00:03:58.262, Speaker A: We'll start with bitcoin. I'm going to show you a sad chart, David. This is where the Charlie Brown music comes in. Cue that under 50k, bitcoin has kind of dropped quite a bit. 2 billion in liquidations from the recent price drop with bitcoin below 50k. Tell us the story here. What's happening.
00:03:58.396 - 00:04:46.162, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this price movement really has come on the heels of that. Elon Musk Tesla tweet, which we're going to be talking about coming up, but we'll talk a little bit about it here. Tesla announced that they are no longer accepting BTC, and Elon Musk said that it was because of energy concerns and just like popular demand to decline to use BTC specifically as a use of energy consumption, there's a lot of speculation as to what is really going on. Is that really the through line? Is Elon playing like he just making erratic moves? Either way, it really took a lot of momentum out of bitcoin sales, and we saw a price as low as $47,500 is the recent low in bitcoin price. And like you said, a bunch of liquidations. People really didn't see this coming. People are really bullish bitcoin.
00:04:46.162 - 00:04:51.446, Speaker B: But there seems to be some narrative headwinds that bitcoin is facing right now that's giving it a little bit of a trouble.
00:04:51.558 - 00:05:32.582, Speaker A: It's almost David like, live by the narrative, also die by the narrative. So when that narrative switches and Elon Musk is no longer in the news for purchasing bitcoin on Tesla's balance sheet, but instead he's saying it's wasteful and we're going to move away from bitcoin as a payment option, and you kind of die by that narrative. And the whole crypto market has felt that we should jump to ether as well. So what happened with the price of ethereum this week? Because it was having a absolutely tremendous week, just a bonkers week, all time highs. And then the Musk rug pull tweet, right? Yeah.
00:05:32.636 - 00:05:59.118, Speaker B: So I asked Su Zu in our state of the nation last week, do you think that this ether price appreciation, both in dollar and bitcoin terms, is perhaps one of crypto's largest events ever? Because that's what I think. And he agreed. There is a through line here that this ether run up in this specific week, up to the high that it got to. New all time highs of $4,356 is the new ether all time high.
00:05:59.204 - 00:05:59.694, Speaker A: Wow.
00:05:59.812 - 00:06:40.906, Speaker B: Perhaps one of Crypto's most monumental events ever. I think that's a perspective worth taking. And then, of course, we get the Elon rug pull. It was too strong of a rug pull, even though there's a case to be made that when he said that he was looking at other cryptocurrencies, more green cryptocurrencies, all the ETH bros are like, oh, he's talking about Ethereum, right? He's talking about Ethereum, right? And while we did dip off of that $4,350 high, and now we are at the low, low price of $3,650. So what is that? That is for $700 drop. Wow. A $700 drop in the.
00:06:40.928 - 00:06:42.830, Speaker A: You remember when ETH price was $700?
00:06:42.900 - 00:07:09.542, Speaker B: Yeah. It's astounding that we can even just dip $700 and it still feels very high just because of how fast Ether has run. Also, the ETH BTC ratio is actually doing a pretty good job, like keeping its head above water. And perhaps that's because of the narrative of the green energy debate versus proof of stake and proof of work that people are starting to wait that into the market.
00:07:09.676 - 00:07:59.190, Speaker A: Yeah, let's talk about that ratio in just a second. I do think that the Elon Musk tweet is very bullish ether in the long run, at least it'll take the market a while to sort this out. And, of course, Ethereum hasn't fully switched over to proof of stake from proof of work. But we've talked about it, David, so often in these roll ups, like it's only a matter of time before the proof of waste narrative. Whatever you believe about bitcoin's energy consumption, almost doesn't matter. It's the narrative that matters. And once that narrative breaks into mainstream, the amount of waste energy consumption that bitcoin has, and if it's phrased as waste versus other cryptocurrency networks like Ethereum, like number two in the market cap, 99% less energy consumption, 99.9%
00:07:59.190 - 00:08:06.422, Speaker A: less. I think that is going to have a heavy weighting in investors minds, just that narrative coming out.
00:08:06.556 - 00:08:27.326, Speaker B: And we do need the merge to actually happen, because we actually do need Ethereum to be green. Ethereum is just under a wasteful paradigm just as much as bitcoin is. The only difference is that in our roadmap, we have this green proof of stake future. Well, the way that narrative lands is that if it actually becomes true, and so we actually need that event to.
00:08:27.348 - 00:08:57.734, Speaker A: Happen, that's true, too. And that event looks like it's going to happen possibly nine months, maybe twelve months. The difference with the bitcoin community is like, no proof of work is great. We're doing this forever, so that's different. The other thing about this bullish move all the way up to all time highs of 4356 is it seems to be institutions maybe driving this rally a bit more. That's certainly what the Three Arrows folks said. We've seen lots of chatter about that in crypto, Twitter as well.
00:08:57.734 - 00:09:09.994, Speaker A: So we'll have to see to the extent that comes true. David, let's talk about the ETH bitcoin ratio, because you alluded to that. And, man, it's just going up and up and up.
00:09:10.112 - 00:09:44.466, Speaker B: What's happening here does not stop going up. Yeah, hit a high of 0.8, which again, are levels that we have not seen since, I think, in the very late stages of the bull market in 20. There are very few time with total time in which ether has been higher in bitcoin terms, than bitcoin. And so again, uncharted waters, uncharted territory. This is why we're calling this, like one of Crypto's most monumental events ever. It's really hard to gain in bitcoin terms against bitcoin.
00:09:44.466 - 00:10:18.370, Speaker B: It's really hard to appreciate versus bitcoin. And ether has just rocketed off of this zero three floor all the way to zero eight extremely quickly in the Vitalik podcast. This has nothing to do with legitimacy, but we talked about equilibrium flips, and all of a sudden things happen slowly, and then all of a sudden they happen very quickly. I think that could really illustrate what's going on here. There seems to be this equilibrium flip going on between bitcoin and ethereum, where people are starting to integrate. Perhaps a smart contracting layer is where it's at. Perhaps proof of stake is the future of crypto.
00:10:19.270 - 00:10:51.202, Speaker A: People talking about the flipping too, once again, and not just like ETH bulls who were talking about the flipping inevitability in 2019 and 2020. And everyone was like, yeah, sure, whatever, guys. Now people like three arrows capital, Suzu both and Kyle Davies from three arrows capital were like, yeah, the flipping is inevitable. And when this cycle, that means ether flippins, bitcoin, this cycle. So this ratio is something we're going to come back to. Ratio. Gang website 46% of the way to a market cap flipping.
00:10:51.202 - 00:11:15.410, Speaker A: Of course, Ethereum, ether has flipped bitcoin in all sorts of other metrics, but the official flipping, I think, is the market cap flipping, and there's 46% of the way there. I think that's going to be pretty monumental. If that happens this cycle in crypto, it'll be the first time bitcoin was ever surpassed by another crypto asset. What do you think, David? If that happens, you think it'll be short lived?
00:11:16.810 - 00:11:44.354, Speaker B: There's a conversation. There's definitely a case where if ether flips bitcoin, it's just for a flash, just for a moment. Long term, definitely in the. Absolutely. Ethereum is flipping bitcoin, and that's going to be the way it is forever. I don't know. I feel like there's a lot of energy behind the trade where if people start to see that ethereum is really getting close, like 80%, like 70% to 80%, I think people are going to front run the flipping.
00:11:44.354 - 00:12:16.338, Speaker B: And just like I said, equilibrium flip is going to be kind of a rush to the gates. And I can kind of see it once it even becomes close. I feel like once ethereum is like 70% to 80% of the way to flipping bitcoin, it's almost already guaranteed. At that point in time, people are going to not want to miss out on their last chance to get a good price on ether. In bitcoin terms, I think once we hit 7.8 or 70% to 80% of the flipping, the flip is just inevitable. It just is going to keep on going, and the snowball is only going to accelerate.
00:12:16.434 - 00:12:32.426, Speaker A: We are definitely getting closer. Okay, let's talk about DFI. So some of the metrics, of course, assets under management, we're hovering at about 80 billion at this point in time. Numbers continuing to go up, down a little bit, I think, on the week. Any thoughts here?
00:12:32.528 - 00:12:51.214, Speaker B: Yeah. New highs of $85 billion total, locked in DFI. I remember when we crossed $1 billion and everyone was just super excited. It was blowing up Twitter. It was made news. And we haven't really had an event like that since then because $2 billion came really fast. $5 billion came really fast, 10 billion.
00:12:51.214 - 00:13:09.954, Speaker B: Like, no one was excited at $10 billion because we just felt so expected. Are we even excited about $100 billion? I'm ready to see if crypto Twitter and dfI Twitter really blows up about when we cross the 100 billion dollar mark. Is it really going to be that monumental? Because at some point, this is kind of expected.
00:13:10.082 - 00:13:21.194, Speaker A: David, if you tweet something out about 100 billion. I'll retweet it, man. I'll retweet it. I got your back. Don't worry. I think it's big. All right, let's talk about the DFI pulse index as well.
00:13:21.194 - 00:13:26.794, Speaker A: That's kind of flat on the week it was up before. Elon rug pull. What's happening here?
00:13:26.912 - 00:13:54.470, Speaker B: Yeah, we got a new high, just over $650. I think it was about a high of $655. Now we are down to the price of $543. So a big decline off of that peak. DFI tokens. DFI assets really had a very strong showing yesterday and the day before Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, DFI tokens were actually appreciating versus ether and DPI versus ether, which is where we're going next. Found perhaps a floor.
00:13:54.470 - 00:14:07.450, Speaker B: Am I calling a floor here? I tweeted out, I'm calling the ETH DPi floor. And then I followed right up with that, saying, there's a very good chance. I don't know how to call a floor. So take that with a grain of salt.
00:14:07.790 - 00:14:09.340, Speaker A: What floor did you call?
00:14:13.090 - 00:14:29.730, Speaker B: Dpi? Okay. And we are now at 00:15 and. Yeah, look at that. The 0.3 level is where we saw the bottom of the dfI bear market after DfI summer, quote unquote bear market. I think this level holds.
00:14:32.470 - 00:14:43.400, Speaker A: Are you saying Eth remains flat while defi goes up? Or are you saying both go up? Just defi goes up faster. Or are you saying eth goes down and defi goes up?
00:14:43.930 - 00:14:52.106, Speaker B: Oh, gosh. Do I have my bull goggles on? If I say that ether goes up and also DPI goes up, I think.
00:14:52.128 - 00:14:53.260, Speaker A: You always have your.
00:14:53.710 - 00:15:16.510, Speaker B: I do have my bull goggles on all the fucking time. Excuse my french. But, yeah, I think Ether goes up and defi tokens go up even more. I think Defi season is around the corner because we know institutions are allocating into, like, how can you not allocate into ether and not believe in, right? So why would they also not allocate to things like uniswap, things like Aave, perhaps even things like urine?
00:15:16.590 - 00:15:33.494, Speaker A: If it's institutions, I suppose. Although we saw Defi summer, everyone was like, yeah, Defi is a big deal. Ether not a big deal. It'll be like bitcoin or stablecoins on Ethereum will be the reserve assets. And that narrative is starting to shift. But that was a narrative we saw in summer of last year.
00:15:33.612 - 00:15:41.834, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right. No, I think institutions are allocating into ether, and I think blue chip defi tokens, prestige Defi tokens are next.
00:15:41.952 - 00:16:03.898, Speaker A: We got to get through some other seasons first. Maybe eth season we have to get through. Maybe not. Maybe it's simultaneous, but garbage season. David, let's flip to this really quick before we come back to ether, because we've got some more stuff to talk about. Ether garbage season is what some are calling it. These are some of the dog coins that have absolutely skyrocketed.
00:16:03.898 - 00:16:07.650, Speaker A: So what are these and what's going on?
00:16:07.800 - 00:16:23.186, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know if these are all from the same platform or same protocol, but everyone's on the tailwinds of doge doing crazy doge stuff. Everyone is making, like, new doggy tokens. So we got shibu token leash, token, akita, token, like, new doggy tokens.
00:16:23.298 - 00:16:24.470, Speaker A: Elon, there's.
00:16:27.450 - 00:17:13.542, Speaker B: So, like, the crazy thing is, first off, a lot of these market caps are extremely vapid, like, extremely low liquidity, extremely low unit prices, making extremely inflated market caps. And so the market cap are, these things aren't real. It's not a very good metric for measuring these things. But what is real and what is astounding is the amount of volume on Uniswap trading these doggy tokens, because you can't fake that they're paying gas fees and they're paying uniswap exchange fees to trade these doggy tokens. And they're some of the highest volume assets on uniswap over the last, like, two days. Perhaps the reason why gas fees have been so insane this last week, upwards of 200 and 5300 I even saw 400 gray at one point in time. Is it because of goddamn doggy tokens on you? I think it could be.
00:17:13.542 - 00:17:15.618, Speaker B: I think it garbage season. Goddamn.
00:17:15.714 - 00:17:58.610, Speaker A: We'll talk about this. But Vitalik, that may be our second rug pull of the week. Vitalik's big move to wreck the doggy coins. We'll talk about that in a minute. What's your overall take? Why is this happening? Is this just speculative mania? Are we in? Does this feel like late stages of a crypto bubble when we have assets like these just pumping? I saw a story this week from the block, which is basically like how someone turned $100 into $2 million by betting on one of these doggy tokens. It's stories like that that start to saturate and everyone's like, oh, wow, it's easy to become a millionaire. I'm going to just buy this asset.
00:17:58.610 - 00:18:04.182, Speaker A: Are you worried that this is like late stage bubble that we're seeing here? Yeah.
00:18:04.236 - 00:18:36.478, Speaker B: First off, when they say that this person put in $100 and now has $2 million, if he market sold he or she market sold their $2 million, they would not get $2 million out. That's part of the inflated market caps. You would have an extreme amount of illiquidity discount that you would not be able to get. You would still make a get it. You'd probably still get a ton of money because these things did go up in price. But again, the market cap appreciation of these things are extremely vapid. But to the point about what's going on here, what's the through line here? If you are a believer of late stage fiat credit cycles, money doesn't matter anymore.
00:18:36.478 - 00:19:22.078, Speaker B: If the money is a farce, then people will invest into farces. And because the money is a farce, the investment works. That's the late stage fiat credit cycle theory. All and any investments work because there's so much money sloshing around that you literally can't put your money into a bad place without getting a return. There's too much dumb money sloshing around, and every single opportunity is an investment. And also part of the late stage fiat credit cycle is that people know that their nine to five job with their salary in dollars, which is not keeping up with inflation, while inflation is rampant, either actually at the CPI level or in asset price inflation, they know that they can't make it in life. They know that their salary, they're doomed to a nine to five job.
00:19:22.078 - 00:19:42.486, Speaker B: And so there's risk in not aping into things that are trying to get them to be a millionaire because they believe that it's their ticket out. We saw this energy with GME, we saw this energy with yoloing into dogecoin. That's this late stage fiat credit cycle is that you've got to ape into something that can make you a millionaire or else you're doing your nine to five for the rest of your life.
00:19:42.588 - 00:20:22.050, Speaker A: I think that's exactly right. And there's this populist undercurrent that says, and if we all ape into the same assets together, then we all do really well. It's very much that Wall street bets absurdist, nihilist culture coming into crypto in the form of doggy coins. Super interesting, the cultural expression of these things. David, let's flip back to an asset we do believe in for another minute. Back to Eth, okay? Because, dude, like EtH, all time highs, crazy week. Ethereum market cap actually grew larger than all the largest banks in the world for the first time.
00:20:22.050 - 00:20:33.270, Speaker A: Look, man, I think that's worth a minute to celebrate. Bigger than Morgan, bigger than bank of America, bigger than ICBC, China Construction bank, bigger than our favorite, Wells Fargo.
00:20:34.170 - 00:20:34.822, Speaker B: Nice.
00:20:34.956 - 00:20:46.358, Speaker A: Ethereum, bigger than all of them. Not all of them put together yet, but all of them at a market cap of almost half a trillion dollars at its high. I think that's pretty awesome, dude.
00:20:46.454 - 00:21:02.350, Speaker B: Yeah, if it was all of them put together, it would be something like $2 trillion or something. Very rough napkin math. Ether definitely deserves to be bigger than all banks put together in my next milestone, all banks put together. That's true banklessness.
00:21:02.690 - 00:21:34.298, Speaker A: The other thing that's an absolute monster is not just market cap price appreciation, but ETH fees. So the revenue that the Ethereum network is driving based on block space demand. So fees have like two sides to it. On the one hand, it becomes more expensive to put transactions through. And I think as users of Ethereum, we've all felt that, especially this last week, trying to get some transactions through, it cost, rather than a transaction that might cost $10, costs like $30.
00:21:34.464 - 00:21:37.978, Speaker B: A UnisoP trade cost upwards of $200 last week. This week.
00:21:37.984 - 00:22:10.642, Speaker A: Yeah, that's crazy. And that is why we need layer two. On the flip side of that, it just means there's a tremendous amount of block space demand. And so the Ethereum protocol, of course, is producing a massive amount of revenue. ETH's annualized fees, based on yesterday that was May 10, amounted to $32 billion. Absolutely crazy. Ethereum managed to process more fees in an hour than bitcoin for the whole day, like blocks based demand.
00:22:10.642 - 00:22:22.090, Speaker A: Off the charts. This is a Justin Drake chart up only. This is charting Ethereum daily transaction fees from 2016 all the way up to 2021.
00:22:22.160 - 00:22:24.842, Speaker B: Now, it's a logarithmic chart, and it's up and to the right.
00:22:24.896 - 00:22:42.302, Speaker A: Oh, my God, dude, I just noticed. It's a logarithmic chart. Yeah, of course, Justin Drake. Of course it would be logarithmic. Just monster fees here. I want to maybe end with this. This is another valuing eth model that our friend Justin Drake put together.
00:22:42.302 - 00:22:57.766, Speaker A: And I think he put this together, David, because he's doing like the world podcast tour now. So I think you'll hear a lot of Justin Drake on other podcasts, maybe more. Mainstream finance graduated out of bankless it. I started here, though.
00:22:57.868 - 00:22:58.520, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:00.970 - 00:23:29.390, Speaker A: But this is another, I think, a model that he put together on the value of ethereum. And we'll include this in the show notes. People can click through this. But what's crazy, I think, is some of these assumptions. There are really two basic assumptions you can make when you model out something like ether. One is just the value based on transaction fees. So this is similar to how a capital asset, like a stock, might be valued.
00:23:29.390 - 00:23:57.558, Speaker A: How much profit is it generated? What's the price of the asset I'm buying? How much earnings is it generating? And then you get like a price to earnings ratio based on that. Right. So stocks are valued this way. The second lever that ether has as an asset is a monetary premium, which is just some degree to which the asset should be valued above and beyond that, because it's used as a money stored value change unit of account.
00:23:57.724 - 00:24:29.246, Speaker B: To put this into triple point asset terms we're talking about, the p to e ratio is specifically just the capital asset side of the triple point asset equation. The monetary premium, I would say, is what happens when you integrate the other two parts of the triple point asset, the lockup demand for ether and defi, and also the consumable demand for ether as transaction fees. I would say, like, as a rule of thumb, the first half is we're just talking about ether as a capital asset, and then you add the monetary premium by adding in the value, the theoretical value of the other twos.
00:24:29.358 - 00:24:44.722, Speaker A: Exactly. That's exactly it. And so what's interesting here is if you look at just the PE ratio. So a typical stock might be a high growth stock. I don't know what Google is from a PE ratio perspective. Maybe close to the hundreds. Something like Netflix.
00:24:44.722 - 00:25:14.818, Speaker A: As recently as last time I looked at it, months ago was 180 or so. That's what you're paying for a stock. From a PE ratio perspective. If you just assume ether at a PE ratio of 50, given the revenue it's generating, then the fair market value with no monetary premium would be 13k. This is just based on a super conservative low growth blue chip price to earnings ratio of 50.
00:25:14.984 - 00:25:18.626, Speaker B: The fair market tried and true valuation metric. By the way.
00:25:18.728 - 00:25:40.826, Speaker A: Yes, in stocks, in any capital asset, the market value would be thirteen k, right? If you assume a higher growth tech stock valuation, not even something crazy. Dude, I saw zoom months ago. PE ratio of 4000 growth. Okay?
00:25:41.008 - 00:25:45.100, Speaker B: Ever since we started bankless, zoom has not gotten any better, right?
00:25:45.870 - 00:26:42.646, Speaker A: A PE ratio of 100, the long term eth valuation would be one hundred and thirty k. One hundred and thirty k. Okay, this is just PE ratio. This is not a factoring in monetary premium. So if you factor in monetary premium to what Justin calls the best guess scenario of a PE ratio of 50 and a monetary premium factor of four, then the fair market value of eth would be fifty one k, right? Anyway, he's got a range here that ranges from like a conservative dial to a heavily optimistic dial. And I think it's super useful for financial investors to actually see the two levers that, as you said, that ether has as an asset both the capital asset quality and also its monetary premium quality. Because you have to factor both of those things in.
00:26:42.646 - 00:26:49.322, Speaker A: And my God, it looks like ether, even at 4k, even at all time highs, is still underpriced.
00:26:49.386 - 00:26:50.346, Speaker B: Stupid. Underpriced.
00:26:50.378 - 00:26:50.526, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:50.548 - 00:27:26.266, Speaker B: And just to ground the listener, the Google PE ratio currently in 2021, is 57. Or, excuse me, that's the Amazon PE ratio. Google PE ratio, 2021 is 25. And we know that, everyone knows that DFI innovates at an extremely fast pace because it's asynchronous innovation going in all different directions at all times, right? And so there's no comparing Ethereum progress, rate of progress, and rate and innovation to a centralized company. It's like this emergent structure, permissionless building. Anyone can build a money Lego. The more legos, money legos that come, the more room for more money legos that are.
00:27:26.266 - 00:27:59.734, Speaker B: That there are. And so I would personally, if you agree with that narrative, you would think that Ethereum's PE ratio should factor in lots of growth because Ethereum grows really fast. So I'm personally in the camp of like 100 ish PE ratio as pretty fair. The other thing, again, bull market goggles are on today. The other thing to think about is that the whole triple point asset. The title of that piece I titled Ether a new model for money as a monetary premium. Justin Drake did a very simple, like, four x, like, whatever, like random number.
00:27:59.734 - 00:28:32.122, Speaker B: Call it a. If there's precedent for that, that's great. What there's not precedent for is a triple point asset with monetary premiums coming from every single asset class. In theory. If you believe in the triple point asset theory, ether as a monetary premium should have the best monetary premium multiplier of any asset in history. That's what the triple point asset thesis is. So not only should we be bullish on the PE number and kind of weight it high, we should also weight very highly the moneyness of ether and the monetary premium.
00:28:32.122 - 00:29:05.478, Speaker B: And so what happens when you have a PE ratio of 100, but you also have a strong monetary premium multiplier? That's when you get literally a $2.1 million ether valuation. It seems absolutely ridiculous. It makes no sense. I don't think ether is going there at all until something weird happens to the dollar. But it's a good thought process to have about, like, well, Ethereum grows really quickly, therefore high PE ratio. Ethereum's moneyness is really, really strong, therefore strong monetary multiplier.
00:29:05.478 - 00:29:09.290, Speaker B: Uncharted waters, new paradigm. Crypto renaissance.
00:29:09.710 - 00:29:14.670, Speaker A: Got to remind you guys, of course, this is not financial advice, just theory. Please.
00:29:14.740 - 00:29:16.400, Speaker B: Your boy was a psych major.
00:29:18.450 - 00:29:29.038, Speaker A: A lot of this is psychology, David, so this is all relevant as well. Guys, we are going to take a minute to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible, and we'll be back with releases.
00:29:29.134 - 00:30:04.746, Speaker B: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on Ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while, and we'll say it again.
00:30:04.746 - 00:30:38.498, Speaker B: Daos have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap? Dow? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a Uni grant@unigrants.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go. That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project.
00:30:38.498 - 00:31:43.550, Speaker B: Thank you Uniswap for sponsoring bankless Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, Legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's v two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on Uniswap and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them.
00:31:43.550 - 00:31:49.102, Speaker B: Check out the power of Ave@ave.com. That's aave.com.
00:31:49.236 - 00:31:57.934, Speaker A: All right guys, we are back with releases. David Definity, the decentralized Internet computer, has finally launched. What does this mean?
00:31:58.052 - 00:32:35.534, Speaker B: Yeah, this is very, very hyped, very old project. 2018 2017 18 project finally coming into mainnet. Lots of hype back then, lots of hype now. I'm not too well informed about the technical merits of definity, but the people that I pay attention to as kind of like my litmus test for what's real and what's fake say that the technical merits of definity are interesting and worth paying attention to. There is the classic scale via centralization argument of definity. The way that they get scale is by having supercomputers. I think that there is a decentralization roadmap over time.
00:32:35.534 - 00:32:53.806, Speaker B: So right now this is definitely I would bucket this in the Ethereum killer camp. And they also are having this very marketed launch. And so again, not necessarily what we would call aligned with the bankless ethos, but it is very big news. And so congratulations to the definity team for getting your project out the door.
00:32:53.918 - 00:33:29.834, Speaker A: Yeah, so this is a project that's been talked about so long, and it's really been built almost in a closed way. So even the code is not completely open source, but talked about in 2016. And I remember being part of the definitive community early on, and there was actually an airdrop that they talked about in 2018. And being in the US, I couldn't actually participate in an airdrop. You couldn't be a us citizen. So I actually got my cousin in Canada, I was like, hey, cousin, check out this airdrop. And he was like, what is this? What am I doing? Anyway, signed up for it in 2018.
00:33:29.834 - 00:34:16.722, Speaker A: He finally got his tokens. Now, wow. His ICP tokens valuation when this thing launched was 170,000,000,000, something like that. So he was instantly pretty excited about that when he realized they finally unlocked. What's interesting about this, David, is I do think that they are trying to compete for a different narrative, which is they want to be the storage and AWS, the decentralized AWS. So not like monetary settlement layer, but take for example this, the uniswap front end, right. That needs to be hosted somewhere that could be hosted on filecoin, ipfs, that could also be hosted on definitive.
00:34:16.722 - 00:34:44.758, Speaker A: Right. So kind of a different use case. Decentralized social networks is something that they've also talked about. I do think they're less coming for Ethereum as a killer and more coming for a decentralized AWS. Now, whether they can pull it off or not, it does seem very centralized. In order to run machines in this ecosystem, you're kind of running that in a data center, if you will. So it's all built on top of that.
00:34:44.758 - 00:35:02.670, Speaker A: So there's some centralized components, but it is an interesting technology as part of the full spectrum stack, and we'll have to see where it goes. So kind of exciting, I think. Kind of interesting, but like the valuation, man. Wow. 170,000,000,000 for this thing. To me, it's just a lot to prove.
00:35:03.010 - 00:35:38.266, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a worthwhile story to follow. And I'm not one to discount the value of progressive decentralization. That's a decentralization model followed by a lot of DFI teams. It's different when we talk about an l one, but also at the same time, perhaps you could say the same thing about that's. How ethereum became decentralized. It started off pretty decentralized, but always the nature of progressive decentralization, things always start off centralized. And so I hope for the best.
00:35:38.368 - 00:35:40.602, Speaker A: Kind of some corporate marketing, though behind this, I don't.
00:35:40.656 - 00:35:44.010, Speaker B: Corporate marketing. Corporate marketing is weird. I don't like that.
00:35:44.080 - 00:35:51.034, Speaker A: Let's be balancer v two. Balancer automated market maker. What's going on in v two?
00:35:51.152 - 00:36:32.214, Speaker B: Yeah, this is actually a pretty big update from what I understand. And the cool thing about balancer v two is the absolutely massive amount of gas efficiency, gas savings that you use now when you use v two. Also, there's a new front end, which in my opinion was much needed. And really the big takeaway is that instead of many different balancer pools for all the canonical typical assets, there's actually just one balancer contract. Now it's actually one pool. And what it really does is it separates assets from AMM logic. And so that has like, not too savvy on the technical details.
00:36:32.214 - 00:37:17.522, Speaker B: But you can use the balancer amm and the assets that you are trading against all live inside of one contract. And the AMM and the assets are actually separated, and so they get a lot of gas efficiency there. I would also imagine that they get a lot of liquidity there because they are able to pool all assets together and they don't have to route around different contracts for every single balancer pool. There's also some other improvements. We did the Stani plus Fernando fireside chat moderated by Dan Elitzer a while ago, where idle assets deposited into balancer get yield in Aave. This is a really very strong technical implementation that is really just all about what DFI is, which is capital efficiency. Capital efficiency, capital efficiency.
00:37:17.522 - 00:37:24.506, Speaker B: And so really a monumental upgrade to balancer. Congratulations, Fernando. Congratulations to the balancer team and all bow holders as well.
00:37:24.608 - 00:38:09.606, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. To me, the balancer v two story is sort of, they built out a platform for launching other automated market makers. So it's not just one automated market maker. It's like a automated market making machine. So it can partner with Aave, it can partner with Gnosis protocol, and it's super cool to have that design space out there. David, let's talk about some other design space, and that is layer two design space. Arbitrum is an optimistic roll up layer two that, in conjunction with optimism, I would say are the most hotly anticipated optimistic roll up layer twos that I at least am aware of.
00:38:09.606 - 00:38:17.418, Speaker A: And they just announced may net opening to developers May 20 eigth. This is super cool. What's the story here?
00:38:17.584 - 00:38:36.334, Speaker B: Yeah, there was actually a very good podcast on the Zero Knowledge podcast. If you want to get into a deep dive into arbitram, I thought that was a very helpful way to understand arbitrum. The fact that we have a concrete date is also extremely exciting. We've been saying it. It's like, l two is coming. L two is coming. Sometimes l two s are actually here.
00:38:36.334 - 00:38:57.670, Speaker B: DydX is on an l two, but it's really optimism and an arbitram that are really going to be where like, oh, yeah, l two s are canonically here. Go use them. Now, they say it's open to developers on the 20 eigth, but in the podcast they said that it's really open to everyone, but it's really the developers who have the know how to actually use that first.
00:38:57.740 - 00:38:57.926, Speaker A: Right.
00:38:57.948 - 00:39:25.310, Speaker B: Like there's no front ends built out, no nothing. And they actually did a very good job. Also in the podcast, they said that they didn't allow anyone to actually access arbitrum before anyone else. And so all teams are getting access to arbitram, l two at the same time. So there was no kingmakers. They didn't bestow early access upon certain DFI teams. So there's going to be like a rush into arbitrum, I think, right? On May 20 eigth.
00:39:25.310 - 00:39:47.542, Speaker B: Last week on the weekly roll up, we talked about how, ok, exchange is going to enable deposits right into arbitrum. And so I think they've done a very good job, like getting business development work out the gate as well, even before launch. And the other take to have is that if arbitrum is here on May 20 eigth, optimism can't be far along. Optimism, early June, question mark? Question mark.
00:39:47.596 - 00:40:15.326, Speaker A: Yeah, hopefully. And the cool thing about both arbitrum and optimism is, of course, it is an entire EVM. That's ethereum, virtual machine inside of a roll up. And we've seen what an EVM in another layer one can do. An example of that is binance smart chain absolutely blew up in terms of usage. And that's what these roll ups are, which is why this technology is so hotly anticipated on the defi side. So, man, I'm super excited about it.
00:40:15.326 - 00:40:36.374, Speaker A: They did say a word of caution at the end of this post, so we should let listeners know about this. We're doing our absolute best to get arbitram out, but the dates in this post are based on the best information currently available. So, guys, don't be surprised if dates get pushed out but the fact that they're throwing something out there may 20 eigth feels promising. We're getting close. Cool.
00:40:36.412 - 00:40:38.106, Speaker B: Congratulations to the arbitram team.
00:40:38.208 - 00:40:53.226, Speaker A: David, let's talk about this leveraged index. So, index co op, put this, a leveraged index mechanism together with ETh. Not too long ago, the FLi eth two X FLI. Now they're doing it with bitcoin. What's the story?
00:40:53.408 - 00:41:18.254, Speaker B: Yeah, I put a tweet out right after they announced this, saying, like, oh, you thought that index co op, the FLI index token from the index co op stops at ETH? No, here's bitcoin. And also, broaden your horizons as to what index co op can do. And so, cool. Now we have a two x bitcoin token. I think it would make sense for them to have a two X DPi token. Let's just recycle their own products.
00:41:18.392 - 00:41:18.694, Speaker A: Also.
00:41:18.732 - 00:41:21.590, Speaker B: I would love to ape into that right now, personally.
00:41:22.410 - 00:41:26.086, Speaker A: What is it? What are the basics of the two XFlI in general?
00:41:26.268 - 00:41:38.010, Speaker B: Yeah, I need to actually get into how that works. There is some underlying rebalancing of WBTC and tokens. I think it's some sort of perpetual swap.
00:41:39.310 - 00:42:05.300, Speaker A: It's just you're taking a margin position, right? And so you're incurring some additional liquidation risk on the downside if the asset price goes down. But if it goes up, you're doing two x. So it's a nice, I guess, way to juice your returns if you're living on the wild side of crypto. And just like ETH price volatility, bitcoin price volatility is not enough for you. You get to go two x up and two x down if you want that.
00:42:06.470 - 00:42:49.486, Speaker B: If you really just want to live on the edge, if typical crypto volatility isn't enough for you, index co op has a product for you. Exactly. The interesting thing is that this is, I think, really competitive with leverage applications like DyDX, trading applications like DyDX. Because what a token is, is a manifested instantiated position where you can go into DyDX and get a two x long position inside of the DyDX platform. You can just do it by buying this BTC or ETH FLi two x token right on uniswap. So the ease of access is there, but also it's composable, because now that your position is instantiated inside of a token, that token can go do things. You can go use that as collateral in other places.
00:42:49.486 - 00:43:00.146, Speaker B: And again, capital efficiency, capital efficiency, capital efficiency. This is perhaps like the future of leverage. It's as single token assets. Win three x leverage, win four x leverage.
00:43:00.258 - 00:43:22.458, Speaker A: It's not only the future of leverage, it's like the future of finance, dude. I'm just like, how can ETFs compete against something like this? Something that's composable, that can be put in all of these other applications within DFI. Etfs are dead, man. This will eventually kill them and eat all of them. We're just watching that play out in real time. David, should we get to the news?
00:43:22.624 - 00:43:28.478, Speaker B: Oh, gosh. Here we go into the news, into the belly of the beast of this particular weekly rollout. Let's do it.
00:43:28.564 - 00:43:32.746, Speaker A: Let's start here. This is a tale of two rug pulls, and we're going to start theming.
00:43:32.778 - 00:43:36.022, Speaker B: The weekly roll ups. And that's the theme of this week, is the tale of two rug pulls.
00:43:36.106 - 00:43:53.046, Speaker A: It really was the big story this week. The first we talked about a little bit, which was the Elon Musk tweet. And here it is. For people who haven't seen it, Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using bitcoin. This is Elon Musk tweeting this out. Look at the likes here, David. Almost half a million.
00:43:53.148 - 00:43:54.114, Speaker B: That's a lot of likes.
00:43:54.162 - 00:44:16.986, Speaker A: Tesla will not be selling any bitcoin, important to note. But we are also looking at other cryptocurrencies that use less than 1% of bitcoin's energy transaction. That's that narrative that's coming back to bite bitcoin for the first time. The reason why bitcoin is down so much on the week, I think we can point to there. Anything else you want to say about rug pull one, David?
00:44:17.098 - 00:44:45.238, Speaker B: Yeah, Eric Connor had a good take where he said, it's probably just true that no one was buying Teslas with bitcoin. That's probably why, if they were actually receiving decent revenue from bitcoin, they would still be accepting it. That's probably what's going on. The other takeaway is that we are currently looking at other cryptocurrencies that use less than 1% of bitcoin's energy transaction. That's the whole point of proof of stake, whole point of ethereum, blah, blah, blah. Again, ethereum, not actually there yet. So, question mark.
00:44:45.238 - 00:44:50.006, Speaker B: What he's actually referring to is Elon woke to proof of stake. Ethereum. I would imagine he is.
00:44:50.028 - 00:45:03.126, Speaker A: He understands. Look, man, what's Elon even doing here? Because he's been all over the. Like you didn't know this. Besides, before, like, two months ago or whatever, when you decided to start taking bitcoin, of course you knew this Crypto.
00:45:03.158 - 00:45:08.106, Speaker B: Bobby had that take. Like, Elon Musk is doing less due diligence than I am when I ape into a doggy token.
00:45:08.218 - 00:45:34.822, Speaker A: Of course he knew. So, like, then you have to ask yourself, okay, well, why this reaction? And it must be that narrative, just internal pressures are building on him, the board, whomever, maybe funds that purchase Tesla stock and no longer want to because of this pressure must have been building for him to release something like this. That's kind of what I think, but even so, it feels very erratic. Right?
00:45:34.876 - 00:45:47.914, Speaker B: Erratic, like nonsensical, like jumping all over the place. Like, what's Elon going to do next? He's on SNL, shilling doge Elon. I know it's ridiculous to make this request of Elon, but, Elon, please calm down. Calm down.
00:45:47.952 - 00:45:50.780, Speaker A: But also, come on bankless. Also come, but also calm down.
00:45:51.390 - 00:45:53.210, Speaker B: And then get hyped on bankless.
00:45:54.270 - 00:46:14.226, Speaker A: We'll talk about Elon. All right, second rug pull. This is Vitalik, dude. Okay, you got to set up this story because a major theme of the week, of course, is garbage season. All these doggy coins pumping, and Vitalik put an end to that almost in one swift move. Set up the story. What happened here?
00:46:14.328 - 00:46:26.306, Speaker B: Right, so it's a common aping activity to send Vitalik's address, which is publicly known, your bags. Because then it's like, oh, Vitalik has these bags. Like, oh, bullish.
00:46:26.338 - 00:46:26.866, Speaker A: Bullish, bullish.
00:46:26.898 - 00:46:37.702, Speaker B: Bullish makes no sense. But people do it anyways, for some reason. I would imagine it was the creators of these doggy tokens sent Vitalik an absolute fuck ton of these doggy tokens.
00:46:37.766 - 00:46:40.202, Speaker A: 50% of their supply in some cases, right?
00:46:40.256 - 00:47:08.366, Speaker B: Which is ridiculous, probably thinking that he just wouldn't do anything, and he usually doesn't do anything with these tokens that people send to him. But there is some maliciousness about these doggy tokens. There's a centralized creator, centralized pre mine. Some early people got access to them. People are calling this, like, retail speculation, retail mania, but I actually don't think so. Because why is retail. Because you have to buy these things on uniswap.
00:47:08.366 - 00:47:33.182, Speaker B: And the amount of transaction fees specifically because of the doggy tokens was absolutely insane. Retail is not paying. I don't think retail is paying $200 to ape into doggy tokens. I think those are other crypto whales, crypto traders who are just doing the speculation game. And I think that's why we're cool with this rug, pull a. Because don't send your money to someone for free and expect them to keep it just because they are.
00:47:33.236 - 00:47:52.738, Speaker A: Okay, so tell us what happened then with Vitalik gets all these coins, they're in his ETH address, and it's like from a market cap perspective, it's worth billions. Of course, market cap does not equal liquidity, as we talked about earlier, but these are just collecting in Vitalik's public ethereum address. So then what happened, right?
00:47:52.824 - 00:48:21.422, Speaker B: And for some reason there was actual demand to actually provide liquidity. So there was actual ether being traded, hundreds of ether in these liquidity pools. And Vitalik just market dumped it and then sent it all of the received ether, which is actual money, not doggy tokens, and sent it to various charities. Right? So he sent 13,000 ETH to givewell. He gave 1000 e plus all Elon tokens. Elon, which is a doggy token to the Methylusa foundation. I don't know what that is.
00:48:21.422 - 00:48:22.698, Speaker B: 1000 Methusela.
00:48:22.714 - 00:48:24.462, Speaker A: I think that's antiaging. Yeah.
00:48:24.596 - 00:48:51.666, Speaker B: Oh, that makes sense. Vital is very into antiaging AI safety, artificial intelligence safety, like, oh thank God, doggy tokens protecting us from the robots. 500 ETH to crypto relief, not sure what that is. 500 ETH to Charter Cities Institute. He also sent a bunch to the COVID India foundation. And so Vitalik just donated. Technically, on a nominal level, he donated like billions of dollars to charity.
00:48:51.666 - 00:48:57.186, Speaker B: But again, $1 billion isn't coming out of this because of the illiquidity of these tokens.
00:48:57.218 - 00:48:58.806, Speaker A: Definitely going to be millions though, right?
00:48:58.908 - 00:49:00.910, Speaker B: Definitely millions. Absolutely millions.
00:49:01.010 - 00:49:02.006, Speaker A: Double digit millions.
00:49:02.038 - 00:49:25.918, Speaker B: Maybe Vitalik rug pulled these doggy tokens and all these people that were trading and hyping up these doggy tokens and really put, I think the mania was going to end regardless. But Vitalik was the person that absolutely ended it and just put his foot down. It's like, this is absolute nonsense. Now all the doggy tokens are like nuking in price. And so Vitalik rug pulled a bunch of degen traders in the name of donations to.
00:49:26.084 - 00:49:40.262, Speaker A: Some people are angry at him for this. And by the way, some of those token proceeds also went to Gitcoin, so funding Ethereum public goods as well. Super cool, but not a lot of people. Some people are angry at Vitalik for doing this. What's your take on that?
00:49:40.396 - 00:50:00.730, Speaker B: Well, don't get angry at Vitalik for you're allowed to gave it to him. Yeah. You gave it to him. Maybe you didn't gave it to him, but why are you upset that you aped into this random doggy token and then it dropped in price? Like, what were you expecting? There's a reason why we called you defi dgens. Your actions have repercussions.
00:50:01.150 - 00:50:26.770, Speaker A: Yeah, to me. And I think Anthony Sasana said something about this is like, a chaotic good move. It's definitely a good. Right. And, like, it benefits public goods rather than the creators of doggy tokens. I'm all for it. I just think it's like an awesome moment in history in crypto, to see this play out in real time and just something that can only happen in crypto, right? Meme tokens go to billions of dollars, get sent to Vitalik's address.
00:50:26.770 - 00:50:37.110, Speaker A: For some reason, Vitalik's like, what do I do with it? Okay, I'm going to market, sell it. Price goes crashing. But in the end, who benefits? Public goods. Charities benefit.
00:50:37.610 - 00:50:46.458, Speaker B: We benefit public goods. If it goes to public goods, we all benefit. Second, if you miss out on the doggy pumps, you're actually getting it back to you in the form of, like, anti aging research.
00:50:46.544 - 00:51:10.290, Speaker A: Maybe we can all live longer now. Maybe the robots won't come kill us in 30 years. All right, David, let's talk some more Ethereum stuff. This is super cool. I think Vitalik, again, maybe he's just doing everything. I don't know how he has time to dump his doggy tokens when he's proposing on uniswap governance that uni become an oracle token. What is this about?
00:51:10.440 - 00:51:56.594, Speaker B: Yeah, I think people are still really trying to integrate this into their brain. I remember Justin Drake a while ago, very long time ago, months ago, sent this proposal around, this EIP, which would instantiate the value of ether into the actual Ethereum protocol. And so there was actually a disagreement between Vitalik and Justin Drake, where Justin Drake wanted the Ethereum protocol to have a little bit more features. And getting the actual price of ether into the protocol level is advantageous for a number of different reasons. Vitalik disagreed. He wanted that role to be served at the app layer. And this is a continuation on that train of thought, where Vitalik says that Uniswap can be the protocol that offers oracle services to the actual ethereum protocol specifically for the ETH USD price.
00:51:56.594 - 00:52:46.862, Speaker B: And so this actually, if you want to extrapolate this out, this puts uni not just as a Defi exchange token, but also as an oracle token, not unlike link, not unlike a chain link, mainly for specifically on chain verifiable information. But what he's proposing is that Uniswap becomes a more robust oracle service for ether prices and other prices. This is a little bit of a complex post as the nature of Vitalik's post, so I need to get into this a little bit more. I don't know what the difference is between Uniswap oracles right now and what Vitalik's proposing, and so I actually reached out to the guy who runs the Chapman University crypto club, and he is going to be writing something about this, and maybe we'll get that out on the bankless newsletter.
00:52:46.926 - 00:53:29.262, Speaker A: Yeah, that's super cool. I think one thing that it does is he's proposing that the Uniswap, the uni token, act as like a backstop for some of these things. So if there's like a disagreement, final settlement occurs through Uniswap governance vote in the same way that know settles disputes and access and oracle. So it's kind of a slow time delay decision making process. Something to that effect is my high level understanding of it. But what's cool about this, David, is this is the secret ingredient, right? Store of out. We've talked about this formula a lot on bankless, most recently in our Chainlink podcast with Chainlink God store of value, right? That's some sort of collateral plus price.
00:53:29.262 - 00:54:00.122, Speaker A: Feed equals what? Anything you can have any asset when you have that. You could model the s and P 500, you could model gold, you could model silver, you could model the price of real estate in a certain area, all sorts of things when you have that combination. And this gives a censorship resistant price feed oracle, at least for the ETH US dollar pair, which would be super cool. So just a really exciting proposal, I think. Probably bullish for Uniswap too, right?
00:54:00.176 - 00:54:39.234, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what I was going to get into. Vitalik has never ever spoken so directly about a specific token on Ethereum, at least not with a formal report. And I'm reminded of our podcast with Joel Mongro where we talk about what capital is, is the ability to direct resources of an economic system. If all of a sudden uniswap oracles become immensely powerful. This is a fundamentally different valuation model for Uniswap. Above and beyond exchange fees. It's now also dictating possibly extremely important oracle infrastructure for Ethereum.
00:54:39.234 - 00:54:55.402, Speaker B: So a completely brand new value capture mechanism for the uni token. I don't think the market has integrated this at all. I don't even know how it would even begin to do so. But if this proposal is taken seriously by Uniswap, governance. I think this is extremely bullish for uni.
00:54:55.536 - 00:55:32.034, Speaker A: So much more responsibility too, to the Uniswap team, Hayden, Adams and crew. Remember when we had Hayden on and we asked him, hey, you've got a treasury with like 7 billion, $8 billion now, right? Your treasury is now bigger than the treasury of the EF, the Ethereum foundation. How are you going to be stewards of the public good? That is the Ethereum protocol. Right. And I think they're stepping into that role a little bit, but this is another, I guess, ask for them to step into it even more. Be the oracle. Be part of the Oracle solution for Ethereum.
00:55:32.034 - 00:55:35.330, Speaker A: I think it's super cool to see that evolve. Anything else? David?
00:55:35.410 - 00:55:38.078, Speaker B: Yeah, disclaimer Uniswap is the sponsor of bankless.
00:55:38.274 - 00:55:47.100, Speaker A: I said the grads program. Yeah, as well. Van Eck filing for ethereum ETF. David, any quick takes on this?
00:55:47.470 - 00:56:17.138, Speaker B: Yeah, there is an immense amount of backlog for bitcoin etfs, to the point where it's actually just like, this is my interpretation of events where there's so much demand for bitcoin etfs and the SEC has been so slow that there's just this massive, just pent up demand for bitcoin etfs. And I think once they finally figure out how to get the bitcoin ETF out into the world, the many of them, they're probably going to not make that same mistake again. And so once bitcoin etfs happen, I bet you ethereum etfs happen extremely quickly.
00:56:17.304 - 00:56:36.582, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I think that's a good take. I'll leave it at that. Another interesting stat this week, 1 billion in volume for starquare. That is a ethereum layer two solution. Part of that is from DydX, which is absolutely crushing it on layer two. Another part from that is from diversify and immutable.
00:56:36.582 - 00:57:08.760, Speaker A: That's immutable. X also on the synthetics quinta side of things, Quinta has surpassed $1 billion in USD volume. Quinta mostly on ETh main chain, but also has a transition path to ethereum layer two as well. I think these two stories are kind of related. Both the 1 billion mark, both sort of successful. D five protocols now in the process of transitioning to layer two. Any other takes on that?
00:57:09.530 - 00:57:14.198, Speaker B: Probably a good time to be a trader. Those people probably worked out. Yeah.
00:57:14.284 - 00:57:36.240, Speaker A: Hopefully you weren't short. Let's talk about this, which is interesting. Someone swiped the uniswap.com domain name. So I guess Uniswap, the foundation, the protocol, the people behind did not own that. Someone swiped it and started pointing it. Where to Sushiswap's Dex website.
00:57:36.240 - 00:57:39.150, Speaker A: Who did this, David?
00:57:39.490 - 00:58:03.698, Speaker B: I don't know. I would imagine that is somebody who is very proximate or very close to Sushiswap and probably has made a lot of money off of Sushiswap or sushi Token. Because who else would be incentivized to purchase uniswap.com? I would like to know how much that was purchased for it. I bet it's got to be in the millions and millions of dollars. This is one part kind of just like poking fun, but also one part kind of malicious.
00:58:03.794 - 00:58:05.880, Speaker A: This is a little dick move.
00:58:07.610 - 00:58:12.040, Speaker B: It's very funny. I'm having a good time. I'm lawing. It's a little bit of a dick move.
00:58:12.510 - 00:58:23.386, Speaker A: Does this just continue the beef between uniswap versus sushiswap? Like the beef that started with the vampire know, we've got like, east coast, west coast, biggie versus tupac? Is this what's going on?
00:58:23.568 - 00:58:36.494, Speaker B: Think again. I think it's all fun and games between sushiswap and Uniswap, more or less. But also, at the end of the day, there is real value at stake. There is real market cap. There are investors behind these. There is. It's like fun rivalry.
00:58:36.494 - 00:58:46.258, Speaker B: But also, this is a real move. This isn't just like, no, this is a shot fired for sure.
00:58:46.344 - 00:59:08.154, Speaker A: Yeah. Who knows who did it, though, of course, hard to trace these things. Wyurne dropping Woofie. Okay, man, you got to unpack this. I guess the context here is doggy token week, garbage season. But Wyrn is not a garbage defi protocol, and YFI is a legitimate capital asset. What is this story? What's going on? Right?
00:59:08.192 - 00:59:15.322, Speaker B: And so part of the doggy token mania is they're extremely low unit prices, right? There's so many units.
00:59:15.386 - 00:59:17.306, Speaker A: 1 quadrillion supplies.
00:59:17.338 - 00:59:42.114, Speaker B: We're talking quadrillions of supplies. Right? And so, like, one doggy token was like one penny. And it just really just messes with people's psychology because they think that's really bullish. Like, oh, if it's one penny and it goes to a penny, I'll be a millionaire. It makes no sense, but it taps in. We see this every single bull cycle. People are trying to learn how to understand fully diluted market caps versus market caps versus unit prices.
00:59:42.114 - 00:59:59.286, Speaker B: Don't buy bitcoin. It's too expensive. At $60,000. Makes no sense. Doesn't matter. But what Bantek did on the yearn team is he just made a contract for a one to one swap of YfI token into Woofie token. Woofie sounds very similar to yippee.
00:59:59.286 - 01:00:20.706, Speaker B: And all it did is it just redenominated YFI. I don't know how. It just moved the decimal place. And so it made YFI, which is a very high value asset at a single unit. It's something like 70. It hit a peak of $90,000 right after doing this. And the reason why it hit a peak is people were buying into this narrative that like, oh, it works.
01:00:20.706 - 01:01:00.846, Speaker B: People are going to buy Woofie token because of the low unit price and because it's a one to one swap, there's going to be a lot of buying demand for YFI completely unrelated to fundamentals of urine or, like, revenue from the urine protocol. This is just trader psychology. This is just being a part of garbage season. And it absolutely worked. All bantek had to do to get a 30% increase in the price of Wifi was create a contract that redenominated it. Wifi was the absolute outperformer of DFI tokens. This week goes from like, breaks through its previous all time highs of like $55,000, hits $60,000 and goes all the way to almost $90,000.
01:01:00.846 - 01:01:12.114, Speaker B: And I think it's back down to somewhere around, like, in the low $70,000. So still much higher than it previously was. And again, all you had to do was redenominate your token to have a different decimal place.
01:01:12.232 - 01:01:47.294, Speaker A: Dude. Sad that this worked at some level, right? Like, these whoopi tokens were like $0.09. But also, I guess the first level of analysis in something like this is, well, this is Wi Fi using a cheap gimmick to get people to buy their token, right? And that's first order analysis. But also second order analysis is WiFi is a legitimate defi asset. It's producing cash flows. It's arguably been undervalued for the last several months. Like, fantastic team around this thing.
01:01:47.294 - 01:02:05.730, Speaker A: And rather than buying useless doggy coins that are just going to pump and dump and get rug pulled, why not buy Woofie? Because that is an actual capital asset. So maybe Wifi is saving people from themselves. I don't know. Question mark. Any thoughts on those takes?
01:02:05.880 - 01:02:36.398, Speaker B: Yeah, you can see in the article, at the time of writing, Woofie last changed hands for $0.09, implying a roughly 3% premium over YFI. Right. Because the buying pressure, buying demand goes into woofie, and then people can arb that trade by putting YFI into the woofie contract and then arving that kind of funny kind of. Again, like if you want to be a protocol, maximalist banteg and the other urine developers, their one job is to make Wi Fi number go. So, like, if they can find different ways to do that, then that's all legitimate. At the end of the day.
01:02:36.398 - 01:02:38.362, Speaker B: You know what my takeaway is, Ryan?
01:02:38.426 - 01:02:39.290, Speaker A: What's that, David?
01:02:39.370 - 01:02:42.990, Speaker B: We should submit an eip to move the decimal place for ether.
01:02:43.810 - 01:02:45.538, Speaker A: There you go. That's all we need.
01:02:45.624 - 01:02:47.342, Speaker B: Let's do an ether stock split.
01:02:47.486 - 01:02:57.810, Speaker A: Look, actually, some protocols have done that. Like dot did that, polkadot did that. Oh, really? Yeah. I think Ethereum doesn't need that at this point, David.
01:02:58.410 - 01:02:59.906, Speaker B: That would be a little bit perhaps.
01:02:59.938 - 01:03:30.906, Speaker A: Illegitimate, but maybe you could submit the Eip and see where it goes. Let's talk NFT stuff. So the one NFT headline is crypto punks sell for $17 million. Where? Not on an NFT marketplace, but at Christie's auction, major mainstream auction house selling crypto punk nfts. Dude, cryptopunks. This is really the Rolex. David, Andrew Steinwald said this when he came on the podcast that nfts are really not about wealth, they're really about status.
01:03:30.906 - 01:03:42.578, Speaker A: And I'm seeing the elevation of crypto punks in digital culture status. Right. Like, what's flashy? Well, you show off your awesome crypto punk because it's worth like 100,000 on.
01:03:42.584 - 01:03:44.514, Speaker B: Your Twitter avatar, discord avatar or something.
01:03:44.552 - 01:03:50.054, Speaker A: Are you seeing this in these cultures? It's definitely a status symbol at this point. Right.
01:03:50.092 - 01:03:58.914, Speaker B: And I just can't get myself to buy a crypto punk because I want to play in the status game. But they're so high priced. Okay. They're so high priced.
01:03:58.962 - 01:04:02.762, Speaker A: So you would do it. I've never been the type for the right price. Sure.
01:04:02.816 - 01:04:03.178, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:03.264 - 01:04:14.694, Speaker A: I've never been the type to want a Rolex or something like. Like I care less. But I do agree there's something appealing about maybe this a bit more crypto punk avatar.
01:04:14.742 - 01:04:16.074, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a big conversation.
01:04:16.122 - 01:04:17.406, Speaker A: I wouldn't say no to it.
01:04:17.508 - 01:04:40.630, Speaker B: So let's actually go into this, right? Like Air Connor has his crypto punk. DC has his crypto punk avatar. It's a nice thing to have on crypto Twitter where we're all in the virtual world, right? We're all living in what Andrew calls the metaverse. Right? So having a cryptopunk avatar is like a status symbol. Yeah, it's your lambo the thing is, you don't need to own the crypto punk to make it your avatar.
01:04:41.290 - 01:04:43.990, Speaker A: Are you going to go steal Eric Connor's NFT?
01:04:44.410 - 01:05:19.026, Speaker B: Not necessarily. So here's the experiment I want to so listeners to bankless can know that perhaps I'm rug pulling a crypto punk sanctity. But what I want to do is I want to screenshot a cryptopunk, but I also want to Photoshop edit it, and I want to make it not actually a crypto punk and do something different with it. Like, maybe I'll make a fake cryptopunk, a fraudulent cryptopunk. Then I'll make that as my avatar. Will anyone notice or care? And I'll be in the crypto punk cool kids club with my crypto punk now.
01:05:19.048 - 01:05:21.490, Speaker A: They will, because you just said it on roll up. Steven.
01:05:21.990 - 01:05:25.522, Speaker B: It's more of a thought experiment. Ryan, why don't you do this?
01:05:25.656 - 01:05:35.026, Speaker A: Why don't you create a whole fake crypto punks, like, replica of all of them and sell them at a discount and become a millionaire? David, multimillionaire.
01:05:35.058 - 01:05:46.522, Speaker B: Well, no, because you can't do that, because that is truly fraudulent. If you're trying to make on chain crypto punks, you can't make fake ones. You can screenshot them and then put them as your avatar fraudulently, without putting it.
01:05:46.576 - 01:05:55.754, Speaker A: I'm just surprised no one's done this, right. It's the analog equivalent to the guy in New York City who's selling you, like, fake rolexes, and he's like, hey, look at my briefcase.
01:05:55.802 - 01:06:01.550, Speaker B: Right, right. The crypto punks we have at home comes to mind.
01:06:01.700 - 01:06:18.934, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. All right, David, let's get to some bitcoin stuff, shall we? Bitcoin. Taproot activation has begun. Bitcoin has been talking about taproot for so long, I've almost forgotten what it actually is. What is Taproot, and why is this a big deal?
01:06:19.052 - 01:06:58.798, Speaker B: Yeah, taproot is a soft fork activation, so much like segwit for those that were around in 2017, 2018 when segwit got activated. And so it basically allows for more expressive bitcoin transactions. And so bitcoin is actually gaining a little bit of expressivity with this taproot activation. I'm not familiar with some of the technical details as to how this happens. They talk about how there needs to be 90% of minor signaling to have consensus for taproot to activate. I don't know why 90%. I always thought that softwareworks were always an opt in system, and so if like, 5% of bitcoin miners are processing segwit or taproot blocks.
01:06:58.798 - 01:07:41.546, Speaker B: Then in theory, taproot is 5% accepted by bitcoin. And if you make a taproot transaction, you'll have to wait for that 5% of bitcoin miners to mine your transaction in order to get that integrated. But really, you just need any amount of bitcoin miners to actually get your specific types of transactions into the bitcoin blockchain. I don't know why we need 90% activation, but that's what we're going for. And so what's currently happening is bitcoin miners are signaling that they will include Segwit transactions right now or taproot transactions right now. And generally, Taproot is a very, just like there's consensus in the social layer for bitcoin, bitcoiners that everyone wants taproot. It's not a hard fork.
01:07:41.546 - 01:07:44.766, Speaker B: It's a soft fork. It's opt in. It's very much in line with bitcoin.
01:07:44.878 - 01:07:48.194, Speaker A: What do they get for this, David? So a little bit more expressivity, right?
01:07:48.232 - 01:07:52.990, Speaker B: This is privacy features. Yeah. Smart contracts.
01:07:53.070 - 01:08:00.150, Speaker A: How much more expressivity are they getting? What new things do you think could be built on bitcoin in a taproot world?
01:08:00.300 - 01:08:22.142, Speaker B: Yeah. We should get somebody who's a taproot expert on bankless to really talk to them about this. But multi signature transactions are a little bit more cheaper, and they're private. There's a little bit more privacy here, and I think it really just unlocks new options a little bit further up the bitcoin stack. And so bitcoin is gaining a little bit of expressivity here.
01:08:22.276 - 01:08:51.670, Speaker A: Yeah. So it feels like it's in the realm of incremental improvement. Not like adding smart contracts to bitcoin level expressivity, but incremental improvements, making maybe some apps easier to build on bitcoin in the future. I guess we'll have to see. David, let's talk about this grayscale bitcoin trust hit record discounts. Negative 20% discounts to spot value. That's pretty insane.
01:08:51.670 - 01:08:53.926, Speaker A: I don't think we've ever seen this before.
01:08:54.028 - 01:08:56.274, Speaker B: No, this is the new low for the premium.
01:08:56.402 - 01:08:58.054, Speaker A: Good time to buy. Good time to buy.
01:08:58.092 - 01:09:08.534, Speaker B: Yeah. If you're bullish on bitcoin, the trade is to sell your bitcoin and buy GBTC tax events, not financial advice. Things can go wrong, blah, blah.
01:09:08.582 - 01:09:13.258, Speaker A: Or just sell your stocks, maybe all the stuff in your fidelity account.
01:09:13.424 - 01:09:27.146, Speaker B: Yeah, right. Like 20% premium. It must just be that there was just a massive flood of bitcoin into this trade in the first place, and people are kind of like panic selling. But if you're long bitcoin, this is a free trade for you. This is literally 20% free bitcoin.
01:09:27.178 - 01:09:27.738, Speaker A: Never seen it.
01:09:27.764 - 01:09:31.310, Speaker B: Also, with an ETF right around the corner, grayscale has a proposal.
01:09:31.390 - 01:09:32.642, Speaker A: That's probably why. Right.
01:09:32.776 - 01:09:41.666, Speaker B: Grayscale has a proposal to turn GBTC into a bitcoin ETF. Right. And so at that point in time, that premium should just snap right back in theory.
01:09:41.778 - 01:09:58.486, Speaker A: Weird to see this during the bull run, though. Not something you'd expect, but microstrategy is kept at it. They're nothing if not consistent dollar cost averaging into bitcoin. Michael Saylor and crew just bought another 15. Buying dip dollars. Are they buying the dip?
01:09:58.598 - 01:10:05.834, Speaker B: Buying the dip, yeah. What was the average price? $55,000. They could have gotten a little bit better, but they're probably still buying right now anyways.
01:10:05.962 - 01:10:11.680, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. David. Let's get to Tom Brady, laser eyes. Is this the one?
01:10:12.290 - 01:10:14.634, Speaker B: Tom Brady is a bitcoiner. Got laser eyes on twitter.
01:10:14.682 - 01:10:19.262, Speaker A: Is he going to be paid in bitcoin or is this possibly. Okay.
01:10:19.396 - 01:10:21.406, Speaker B: He wouldn't be the first football player.
01:10:21.518 - 01:10:28.200, Speaker A: Yeah. I love this as a social signal. It's just really cool. I mean, well done, bitcoiners. Good job with the laser eyes.
01:10:28.970 - 01:10:30.118, Speaker B: Big w there.
01:10:30.204 - 01:10:51.260, Speaker A: All right, David, one last thing before we get to some of the other agenda. Crypto exchange. Binance is now facing investigation by the IRS and Department of Justice. A new report. This is fresh news as of today, David. I guess it's finally happening. The IRS is knocking on door, right?
01:10:51.870 - 01:11:02.830, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm trying to do my best to not feel schoddenfreud, but this is what happens when you play with fire. CZ, like, you can't be.
01:11:02.900 - 01:11:42.138, Speaker A: The writing was on the wall in quotes, right? He can't be an exchange in quotes. I think CZ and Binance have always been skirting this line of sort of wanting to maintain custody of assets and being a regulated institution, but not playing by the rules of all the other regulated institutions. Is that kind of the take here? There's an element of like, David, shouldn't you be for free markets? Why are you feeling Schottenfreud? Schottenfreud at this event? Shouldn't you be an anti regulation type guy? I thought you were a crypto quote unquote libertarian or anti authoritarian figure.
01:11:42.304 - 01:12:17.222, Speaker B: Yeah, I am all for free markets. The thing is that when you can see the writing of the walls, when you are instantiated in meat space, you have certain commitments to the meat space world, which, in my opinion, binance and CZ were not fulfilling. They were not fulfilling. You can't really be in the meat space, but not also play games with regulators if you are moving billions and billions of dollars like Binance is, someone's coming knocking. There's literally no place on planet Earth that you can be where no one can come get to you. Your servers live somewhere. You're instantiated in meat space.
01:12:17.222 - 01:12:32.538, Speaker B: And as a side quest, that makes kind of why I'm bullish. Proof of stake is because proof of stake literally is not instantiated in meat space. It's in the ether. It's in the virtual world, unlike proof of work, which is literally instantiated in meat space. But, David, what if instantiated is always a risk vector?
01:12:32.634 - 01:12:44.466, Speaker A: What if the same report came out that the DOJ and the IRS were knocking on Uniswap's front door? Hayden Adams, front door. What would your reaction be there? And what's the difference?
01:12:44.648 - 01:13:26.410, Speaker B: Right? The difference is that you can't stop Uniswap because you can't stop Ethereum, because Ethereum is not instantiated in meat space. And it won't be even less under proof of stake. But also, if they put Hayden in handcuffs and took him away, I would be extremely fearful of what is, in my mind, of extremely authoritarian move. Because you can't stop Uniswap, yet you are doing something in this very, extremely hypothetical scenario. They know they can't stop Uniswap, yet they are still penalizing people who are Defi founders. There's a reason why can't be evil or can't have control or can't shut that down is a liability risk mitigation mechanism.
01:13:27.330 - 01:13:34.654, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the big difference in my mind, too, is CZ has access to your private keys. Hayden Adams does not.
01:13:34.772 - 01:13:35.198, Speaker B: Right.
01:13:35.284 - 01:13:42.398, Speaker A: That's the big difference. When we say, what is a crypto bank? It's a group that has access to your private keys. They maintain custody of your assets.
01:13:42.494 - 01:13:44.146, Speaker B: That mediates you and your money.
01:13:44.248 - 01:14:06.454, Speaker A: We call these crypto know, they're called exchanges. But this is what banks do in the regular banking system. They take custody of your assets. That is the thing we're trying to get away from in crypto. That is the thing uniswap does not do. Hayden Adams and Uniswap team and all of the code doesn't get access. There's no way for him to access your private keys.
01:14:06.454 - 01:14:23.566, Speaker A: That is the difference between Defi and something like Binance. To know if you have custody of someone's funds, there ought to be some regulatory responsibilities for that. When you don't. Different story in my mind.
01:14:23.748 - 01:15:01.034, Speaker B: Yeah. The last line of conversation that I think is relevant to have, and I tweeted this out forever ago, where I said, at some point in time, somebody is going to come knocking on Binance's door. I don't know who? I don't know when. Is it the United States? Is it China? Somebody's coming knocking. And at that point in time, CZ is going to wish that he had become more politically aligned with the Ethereum community. And something that I got from Anthony Suzano forever ago is like Binance had this opportunity to be an Ethereum powerhouse. They could have really helped out the ecosystem rather than carbon copying it and trying to fork it and keep it for themselves and keep the same energy.
01:15:01.034 - 01:15:26.314, Speaker B: They could have been something like consensus, where they built out a studio that built out stuff for Ethereum. They could have been really politically aligned with Ethereum, yet they chose to co opt it and try and brand it for themselves. And then we have CZ talking about BNB flipping ether. And now the time has come where three letter agencies are coming knocking on the door of binance. And now he doesn't have any friends. Right? You only have the very small binance ecosystem. You could have been friends with Ethereum.
01:15:26.314 - 01:15:27.720, Speaker B: We could have helped you.
01:15:28.410 - 01:16:13.154, Speaker A: Here's the other take on that, though, is like, don't count Binance out by any mean. Look at the recent hires that Binance has made. These are people from us regulatory regimes that CZ and Binance are hiring to run their exchanges and be on their executive team. This is the play that the traditional banks have made, is basically buy your way into political power. And there's certainly enough billions of dollars for CZ and binance to pay fees, get regulators aligned, curtail some things, and stay in the game. So I definitely expect Binance and company will stay in the game, but we'll see what happens. This is definitely not a small thing.
01:16:13.154 - 01:16:20.006, Speaker A: All right, David, we're going to come back with some takes, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:16:20.188 - 01:17:07.026, Speaker B: Balancer is Defi's most powerful automated market maker. Typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool, which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs of Defi. With balancer, you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm, which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility. This makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases. Balancer pools can make asset indexes, but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers, Balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity. Additionally, balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules, such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions or even liquidity bootstrapping pools, which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity. At bankless, we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t shirts to much success.
01:17:07.026 - 01:18:02.850, Speaker B: Balancer V two brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you. In v two, idle tokens are capable of generating yield in DFI without sacrificing liquidity in the pool. To top things off, Balancer is reimbursing all gas costs with valve rewards, meaning that all your gas costs are returned to your wallet with the balancer governance token, Balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in Defi by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange. Dive into the balancer pools at pools Balancer Exchange Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make. My crypto buys and sells Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens, and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets.
01:18:02.850 - 01:18:50.738, Speaker B: Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset. When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in eth, so whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of eth bonus back to me. At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus.
01:18:50.738 - 01:18:55.526, Speaker B: Check them out@gemini.com. Gobankless all right, David, let's get to.
01:18:55.548 - 01:19:07.254, Speaker A: Some hot takes for the week. This is the first one. Everyone gets a private key. Brantley eth tweeted this out. Talk about everyone getting a private key and the ramifications of this thread.
01:19:07.382 - 01:19:43.442, Speaker B: Yeah, Brantley Milligan of EnS. He's the reason why we all have our favorite ens addresses, him and Nick Johnson and the whole Ens team. He tweets out, one of the most significant side effects of the rise of crypto is we're finally giving everyone a public private key pair. What cypherpunks have tried unsuccessfully to do for years with ideology is happening with crypto because of incentives. This has far reaching consequences. And then he makes a tweet thread, which is definitely worth reading, perhaps some homework for the bankless nation. But basically what he's saying is that because we all are playing, like, defi games, we all want our tokens.
01:19:43.442 - 01:20:39.474, Speaker B: We all need our hardware wallets with our ledgers or our metamask. We all now have public private key cryptography. And there's something extra outside of cryptocurrency that is not just about money and assets, but it's giving people the power of public private key cryptography. There's something powerful in of itself of just about having everyone having a public private key pair. The first and best way to do this is I would love to never have to use an email and password anymore and just log in by signing a message so that the service that I'm logging in with understands who I am because of my Ethereum or not even my Ethereum address, my public private key pair that I can sign with my ledger, and it's not even relevant to ethereum, or it's not even relevant to bitcoin or any other blockchain or crypto system. It's just about having your own personal private key that is something that you control, that is like your personal password to life, and it doesn't stop there. The fact that everyone has a public private key pair is extreme.
01:20:39.474 - 01:21:02.810, Speaker B: A very important conversation for personal sovereignty, self sovereignty, the sovereign individual. And now what Brantley is saying, because of everyone playing around in defi season and playing with getting their bitcoin, getting their ether, and importantly, self custodying these things, now everyone has a public private key pair, and now we can finally unlock the version of the world that the cipherpunks envisioned for us.
01:21:02.980 - 01:21:21.906, Speaker A: Yeah, it really is amazing. Like you said, this could eliminate the need for username and passwords. Across everywhere. We use username and passwords. Right? And the messy two factor authentication with the public private key pair, you don't need that sort of thing. You can just do it with your public private key. The other thing this eliminates.
01:21:21.906 - 01:21:56.866, Speaker A: David, I was just signing some paperwork, like, irl the other day, right? And I was just like, it's going to be good. How crazy is it that we are still using physical signature as a proof of authenticity? A proof of identity? Like, why can't I just hit some buttons on a hardware device or a UB key or metamask dialog instead? Or, like, every time you go to buy something, you're buying something with a credit card, for instance, and you have to sign your name. Come on, man. Are you really?
01:21:56.888 - 01:22:00.546, Speaker B: I attest to how I am, who I am, with my signature of a.
01:22:00.568 - 01:22:12.582, Speaker A: Name that could be anyone's, is not. This is just such a legacy artifact of a paper analog world. I think all that's going to go away in the future. Brantley's absolutely right.
01:22:12.716 - 01:22:30.698, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know about you, but when I sign something, just a. Yeah, I do smiley faces. I've had zero repercussions for doing that. And I've done that for years. I actually don't have a signature because for years and years, I've only Signature. So when I actually sign my name, I'm like, fuck, how do I write my own name?
01:22:30.784 - 01:22:40.382, Speaker A: Yeah, just print it. Like, what is it, David? Okay, that's awesome. All right, let's get to the second take. So, Michael Wong here.
01:22:40.436 - 01:22:41.322, Speaker B: Michael Wong.
01:22:41.466 - 01:22:51.314, Speaker A: No validators. No validators. No security. No security, no developers. No developers, no users. No users, no fees. The end.
01:22:51.314 - 01:22:52.738, Speaker A: What's the story here?
01:22:52.824 - 01:23:04.502, Speaker B: Yeah, so, Michael Wong, shout out. Bankless. Head of culture. Chief of culture. Chief culturalist. Some unofficial title that we've bestowed upon him. He's the memer behind the bankless Twitter account, by the way.
01:23:04.502 - 01:23:30.974, Speaker B: Go give him a follow. So what he's talking about is just this bootstrapping, recursive loop of a crypto system. And he's talking about it's one part, like a good take on why fees need to be fees and why we need fees in the first place. Because if you don't have any fees on your blockchain, you have less incentive to run a validator for your blockchain. If you have less incentive to run a validator for your blockchain. Your blockchain has less security. If you have less security.
01:23:30.974 - 01:24:03.990, Speaker B: Developers don't want to build on your stuff. If it's an unstable foundation, they don't want to build on you. If you don't have any developers building on your system, you don't have any users using your system. If you don't have any users using your system, then you don't have any fees. So it's a recursive cycle and hopefully a positive feedback loop. Once you start to get one of these things, you'll start to get the others of these things. And that's kind of why Ethereum's network effects are so strong, is Ethereum has gone from its zero to one moment of it's hitting this recursive loop of fees, validators, security developers, users fees, validators, blah, blah, blah.
01:24:04.670 - 01:24:12.962, Speaker A: To me, this take kind of starts at the very last line, which is no users, no fees. It's right. The beautiful thing is that this is a virtuous cycle.
01:24:13.126 - 01:24:15.150, Speaker B: Ethereum doesn't have to start anywhere.
01:24:15.650 - 01:24:45.906, Speaker A: Yeah, but Ethereum as a network is incented to get more users to make its block space more valuable, because when it does that, all of these other things happen. That's where my mind enters this cycle. Right. I know the cycle could begin anywhere, but that is a beautiful thing because then the network is optimized to provide very valuable block space. What's block space? A uniswap transaction consumes block space. What's the value of the Uniswap transaction on any given day? That's what anyone's willing to pay for that. And that has become very valuable.
01:24:45.906 - 01:25:20.510, Speaker A: Per our earlier conversation in the markets section, we were talking about the massive amount of fees that Ethereum block space is generating. This, to me, is the healthiest sign of a blockchain. Block space demand, users paying for fees. Like you've said before, David, and I think we said it again in our podcast earlier this week, state of the nation on chain transaction fee maximalism. Right? There's an element of that, right? And Ethereum definitely has that and has built up a healthy network as a result of users paying fees on its chain.
01:25:20.670 - 01:26:01.710, Speaker B: This virtuous cycle, I think, does also a very good job to articulate why you and I, Ryan, as people that are trying to promote this bankless revolution, why we only consider bitcoin and ethereum as really bankless tools. Right? Because they are the only two systems that have this virtuous cycle, that they have actually bootstrapped into existence. Right. EOS is a dead system because it never got this virtuous cycle like litecoin never got this cycle. So there's a difference between crypto economic systems like bitcoin and ethereum and other cryptocurrencies which I don't consider to be a live system, like litecoin not alive. Bitcoin, cash, not alive. These things aren't systems.
01:26:01.710 - 01:26:07.410, Speaker B: They haven't bootstrapped themselves into existence yet. They're not a live organism.
01:26:08.310 - 01:26:31.446, Speaker A: I agree. And you're talking, by the way, about just layer one specifically, but you haven't reached product market fit until you see substantial revenues, some level of revenues being produced by your block space. And no other chain has really passed that bitcoin and ethereum have. Of course, there's things like Doge which haven't passed that, but have rocketed to, like 80 billion.
01:26:31.478 - 01:26:33.366, Speaker B: Doge has some good fees right now, dude.
01:26:33.478 - 01:26:35.100, Speaker A: It does it. Yeah.
01:26:36.030 - 01:26:38.938, Speaker B: If you go to cryptofees info, it's on the charts, man.
01:26:39.024 - 01:27:04.980, Speaker A: There you go. That's some early bankless, right? Well, I mean, we asked the question of the three arrows, guys. They seem surprised, but didn't discount Doge's ability to become a store of value. And I don't think the bankless thesis does either. Would I buy Doge? No. I mean, we got to see some sustained activity. But would I discount it as a possible contender for store value? No.
01:27:07.590 - 01:27:21.610, Speaker B: Do we need to make a proposal to update the bet index to include Doge? I don't think so. Before we move on, I'll leave this one last homework assignment thought experiment to the bankless listener. Where do you think this virtual cycle starts?
01:27:22.350 - 01:27:25.066, Speaker A: The virtual start, guys.
01:27:25.168 - 01:27:25.978, Speaker B: Where's the start?
01:27:26.064 - 01:27:47.826, Speaker A: DBD. Let's go to this one. Ethereum has created the most amount of wealth among a distributed and diverse group far beyond any other startup. The ecosystem is great because the community constantly reinvests in new research and projects. The rate of reinvestment is perhaps greater than Silicon Valley. What's your take on this?
01:27:47.928 - 01:28:26.922, Speaker B: Yeah, my mind goes back to when we were talking about Justin Drake's model for the PE ratio and why perhaps it's appropriate to give Ethereum the benefit of the doubt of having a very high pe ratio, like something around 100 plus. Because innovation moves at a breakneck speed. And part of the reason why is because we recirculate our investments, right? Like when crypto D five people make money on Ethereum, they tend to, a, leave it there, and also b, reinvest it into similar like projects. And so that's why it's okay to integrate extremely high rapid growth into the Ethereum investment thesis.
01:28:27.066 - 01:29:09.802, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the part of this I really like, so I'm not sure if Ethereum creates super distributed wealth, right. I don't think cryptocurrency is a wealth distribution tool necessarily. I think it's definitely a financial equalizes financial opportunity, that's for sure. But the take on this that I like is heard someone say this week, Ethereum is the new Silicon Valley. And what I think is interesting about that take is, like, Silicon Valley didn't start with Facebook and Google. And the current era that we see as Silicon Valley, it started in the 1960s with Hewlett Packard, right? And that was the original silicon. Right.
01:29:09.802 - 01:29:54.826, Speaker A: And then those companies, venture capitalists, people, investors who are successful with that era of computing, invested in the next cycle, which was the pc revolution, which invested in the next cycle, which was the Internet revolution, which invested in the next cycle, which was the mobile tech revolution. And that is why Silicon Valley grew as a sector, is because every generation just invested in the next generation. And I very much see that's what's happening with Ethereum right now. So people that were successful with ether as an asset, they're now investing in DFI. People are successful with the first layer of DFI protocols, are now investing in Gen two. It's happening like it happened in Silicon Valley, just at a super accelerated rate. And I think that's super cool.
01:29:54.826 - 01:30:10.640, Speaker A: And there's opportunity. The thing that is cool is opportunity for everybody in the world to enter Silicon Valley, you had to live in Silicon Valley. No longer the case. You can live anywhere in the world. You have Internet connection, like start building on DeFi. That's what's cool about.
01:30:11.490 - 01:30:40.374, Speaker B: And that you took the words right out of my mouth. And I think that's why Santiago is saying that this wealth distribution is actually perhaps better than at least legacy counterparts. Again, cryptocurrency, it's not the best wealth distribution tool. But think of the distribution of ether, and which we know is actually pretty good with the genie coefficient, is way more distributed than Apple equity or Amazon equity, or typical startup equity, right?
01:30:40.412 - 01:30:45.862, Speaker A: Just like Facebook equity, which most of that happened when it was private. Most of the growth happened when it's private.
01:30:45.926 - 01:31:38.454, Speaker B: Exactly like ether was never private. It did an ICO presale with a lot of analysis about how fair and distributed that ether in the presale was. Then we had this proof of work distribution, and then that's just ether, the asset not only that, but we also have Defi tokens, which, again, allows for a lot of churn and distribution of wealth. Right. Like, you can come in and you can rise the ranks of capital just by one specific defi token that you find your niche in. And kind of like how we were talking about with Josh Rosenthal on the Renaissance podcast, where we made the claim that the renaissance, it was fast, but it also began in one specific spot in the world and moved outwards from there, versus this crypto renaissance, which is happening equally everywhere. And so that is also a reason to be bullish on wealth distribution.
01:31:38.454 - 01:31:47.966, Speaker B: And so it's not a silver bullet for wealth distribution. But I do think that ethereum and crypto at large is better than previous systems. Yes, absolutely.
01:31:48.148 - 01:32:07.022, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree. Let's go to this take. This is a Wall Street Journal take. And the headline is really the take. The Fed is playing with fire. So I think what's interesting here is, David, a report just came out this week that inflation, this is CPI inflation was 4.2% in the US in the month of April.
01:32:07.022 - 01:32:29.542, Speaker A: It's a high number, high number. Analysts were expecting the top range 3.6%. It comes out, it's 4.2%. So things are heating up. And I think there is a narrative that is starting to propagate, not just in crypto cycles. In crypto circles, we've always said the Fed is playing with fire, nation states are playing with fire. But now it's going a bit more mainstream.
01:32:29.542 - 01:33:03.110, Speaker A: Like, careful, the engine's running hot. What's the next move of the Fed and central bankers now? Now that inflation, like we've seen asset price inflation the last 1011 years, that's almost been hidden. Mainstream hasn't really reported it. I have no idea why. But now it's surfacing in CPI, consumer price index, and I think there's increasing recognition that the Fed is playing with fire. And what do we do if inflation starts to massively increase? What levers do we have from here?
01:33:03.260 - 01:33:30.430, Speaker B: I think the perspective that listeners should have is they are playing with fire inside of a forest that hasn't had a forest fire in over a decade. That's what people should be concerned about, right? Like, is this just April or is this the beginning of rampant inflation? Inflation can get out of control. And so what's May? What's June, what's July? Is this the first of things to come? Do we even know it's a great inflation?
01:33:31.890 - 01:33:38.990, Speaker A: Be like, so the Jim Powell and company, they say, look, this is just Covid ending.
01:33:39.070 - 01:33:40.574, Speaker B: And so pent up demand.
01:33:40.702 - 01:34:07.146, Speaker A: Pent up demand. And so they say this will level up. It's definitely something to watch. David, let's talk about this last one. This is a clip from the Vitalik episode on legitimacy that we released this month or earlier this week on Monday. This is a quote from him. An asset having a community that wants it to be an ultrasound money is a good property for an ultrasound money to have.
01:34:07.146 - 01:34:33.166, Speaker A: Vitalik said this, I think, when we asked him the question about, hey, what do you think of this ultrasound money narrative? And his response has been pretty consistent since, I think the first time I heard someone ask him that a few years ago, which was you in Tel Aviv when you asked him, hey, Vitalik, is eth money? I want it to be money. And as a member of the community, I want to know if you think it's money. And what was his response? David?
01:34:33.278 - 01:35:05.354, Speaker B: His response was that Ether is money if the community wants it to be. And this is how crypto assets come to be, is a community comes around and rallies behind an asset because of its merits and says that because of these merits, this thing is really, really good money. And all of a sudden, that's how money becomes like, it's a shelling point. It's a coordination. Like. This is almost the only bullish thing I've heard Vitalik say about Ether, the asset, because he has to be very muted about it. He wants to be very apolitical.
01:35:05.354 - 01:35:11.694, Speaker B: But he's saying if the community wants ether to be ultrasound money, then it will be ultrasound money.
01:35:11.732 - 01:35:18.034, Speaker A: Same answer. The same answer he gave you those years ago. Pretty cool. All right.
01:35:18.072 - 01:35:25.358, Speaker B: But it's pretty clear that I'm pretty sure the community wants ether to be ultrasound money because of how incredibly fast that meme stuck.
01:35:25.534 - 01:35:39.458, Speaker A: It is beginning to feel that way, isn't it, David? All right, let's talk about meme of the week. We've got two this week. We should start with the first one. We're going to fade out with, I think, the second one. Describe this meme for people who can't see it.
01:35:39.564 - 01:35:42.342, Speaker B: Yeah. God, I think this is bad boys.
01:35:42.406 - 01:35:44.650, Speaker A: I haven't bad boys, too.
01:35:44.800 - 01:36:02.670, Speaker B: Anyway, one of bad boys something, but it's been doctored, of course, because it's a meme and it's now rug boys. It's Vitalik dual wielding pistols with Elon Musk behind him. We got the tale of two rugs this week and Vitalik. And so good.
01:36:02.740 - 01:36:20.386, Speaker A: So good. I think a perfect meme to encapsulate the news of the week. You know what? We're going to fade out with this bonus meme. But before we do, just want to mention, of course, everything that we talked about in the roll up is risky. EtH is risky. Crypto is risky. So is bitcoin.
01:36:20.386 - 01:36:38.922, Speaker A: If you're on the defi journey, you could lose what you put in. But of course, we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. And with that, let's fade out with the real meme of the week, the big meme of the week. David, do you want to intro us?
01:36:39.056 - 01:37:11.540, Speaker B: Yeah, sorry, podcast listeners, it's not going in the podcast because this is very much a visual meme. But shout out to Fred Master meme generator. He made this one. ETH has no supply for let's watch. Try to realize the truth. What truth?
01:37:12.440 - 01:37:14.180, Speaker A: There's no supply floor.
01:37:17.370 - 01:37:18.882, Speaker B: There's no supply floor.
01:37:18.946 - 01:37:37.460, Speaker A: It's even better than a supply cap. It's a decreasing capital.
