00:00:00.080 - 00:00:10.342, Speaker A: There's a growing conversation in the Ethereum space about is the starknet L2 interested in actually becoming its own kind of sovereign chain that disconnects from the Ethereum layer one?
00:00:10.398 - 00:00:11.158, Speaker B: Absolutely not.
00:00:11.206 - 00:00:12.022, Speaker A: No, we.
00:00:12.038 - 00:00:22.582, Speaker B: Do not foresee this. We don't have any plans for such a thing. We are relying in so many aspects on Ethereum, and that's our strategic decision from day one. And it's a four.
00:00:22.638 - 00:00:23.710, Speaker C: Year old strategic decision.
00:00:23.782 - 00:00:23.966, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:23.990 - 00:00:24.174, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:24.214 - 00:00:31.526, Speaker A: Okay, so there's no plans for the stark net to become its own layer one. What about settling upon a different layer one? Like, in addition to Ethereum, we've been.
00:00:31.550 - 00:00:32.614, Speaker C: Approached many.
00:00:32.654 - 00:00:33.862, Speaker A: Times by.
00:00:34.038 - 00:00:45.134, Speaker C: Anyone you can think of. Okay, our answer is simple and straightforward. We're a L2 on Ethereum. That's what we've been building for years now, and we're very proud of that. This is where we're at. This is where we exist.
