00:00:00.090 - 00:00:58.220, Speaker A: In the current form. The way we build web two social you have different kind of interactions. You as a user, you create your audience in one platform and you can't move that audience from one place to another. Essentially web two social is about capturing the data interactions that you do on the platform and then selling services and products to you that you might buy. So at the moment there isn't a way actually to have a system where all the developers can come together and build competing algorithms and actually allow the users to vote with their feet very easily and go towards applications that are providing them better. Algos so what we did is that we created a protocol that is essentially a social graph, meaning that you create your profile once and anyone that builds an application on top of the lens protocol leverage of the whole social graph user base, essentially everyone is helping to each other, providing users. Essentially it's a public good for the whole community.
