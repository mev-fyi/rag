00:00:13.050 - 00:00:32.454, Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, and how to front run the opportunity. This is Ryan. Sean Adams. I am here with David Hoffman, and we're here to help you become more bankless. David, how are you doing after that.
00:00:32.492 - 00:01:30.390, Speaker B: Epic episode we just came out of, perhaps the best bankless episode we've ever recorded with Vance Spencer of framework. Vance got on my radar when he did the podcast with Dimitri from hidden Forces, and he just nailed everything I thought about DeFi. And so we wanted to get him onto the Bankless podcast to do a podcast with two hosts that live inside of the DeFi ecosystem instead of outside of it, and Vance just hit it out of the park. This podcast was absolutely insane. We kind of go through the history of communities that came out of the 2017 mania, went through a grueling bear market together, created culture while their respective teams created protocols, and turned into the D five protocols that we know of them today. And then we talk about liquidity, mining and governance tokens and distributing ownership over these pseudo equity cash flow protocols. And then we talk about how these things compose together.
00:01:30.390 - 00:01:44.010, Speaker B: And then we finish off with some of the most insanely bullish predictions I've ever heard ever about crypto at the very end. So you guys got to listen to the whole thing. This episode just flowed so beautifully. Ryan, what did you think about this?
00:01:44.160 - 00:02:29.174, Speaker A: You know, we always talk about in the intro, we always talk about how to get started, how to get better, how to front run the opportunity. This is an episode that will help you front run the opportunity, because Vance and the framework folks have been front running the opportunity in DFI since the whole thing started in 2017, 2018. So if you listen to one episode on DFI and you're trying to get insights into what's next, what's the future, trying to understand how to invest, deploy capital in the space. This would be the one to listen to. Of course, the 27 episodes previous are also some essential listening as well. So if this is your first bankless episode, go check out the archive. Lot of gold in the archive.
00:02:29.174 - 00:02:37.914, Speaker A: And we've been building up to this point. David, you know what? I've got kind of no more to say on this. I think we should just get to the goods and go right into the episode.
00:02:38.042 - 00:02:46.930, Speaker B: Yeah, there's nothing more that we could add to this insanely dense episode. But before we get there, we're going to take a moment to talk about our fantastic bankless sponsors.
00:02:47.350 - 00:03:10.822, Speaker A: The first sponsor, I want to tell you about is Ave. Ave is a DeFi protocol that you absolutely have to check out. What can you do with it? You can lend. You can borrow banklessly all on Ethereum. So you could do things like lend Dai to the protocol. It will magically transform that Dai into an interest bearing DAi account. Not just Dai, all sorts of crypto assets on Ethereum.
00:03:10.822 - 00:03:41.742, Speaker A: You can also borrow against it. Ave has been climbing up the leaderboard as well, and they've recently released avonomics, which is their token economics upgrade. You can read more about it. We will include a link in the show notes. So avonomics grants key decision making to Ave token holders. It creates more safety and economic incentives to reward protocol growth. One of the coolest things is it actually introduces a safety module so there is staked.
00:03:41.742 - 00:03:54.742, Speaker A: Ave becomes a collateral of last resort. You can find out about Ave avonomics, start using the protocol@ave.com that's a v e.com for those of you that have.
00:03:54.796 - 00:04:49.154, Speaker C: Been transacting on Ethereum, you've noticed that the gas prices have just been insanely high, 60 guay on a good day and sometimes all the way up to 100 gwe, which is really reducing the amount of activities that is really feasible to be able to do on Ethereum. This is where our newest sponsor, Loop Ring comes in. Loop Ring is a ZK roll up scaling protocol for Ethereum, for both trading and for payments ZK rollups. That stands for zero knowledge rollups. It's basically cryptographic magic. It allows you to combine activity and transactions into one single bit of information, which means that massive amounts of transactions can be bundled into a very small chunk of information, which reduces the gas per transaction. At loopring IO, you can find a ZK rollups based exchange and also a payment mechanism, all with the same security guarantees of the Ethereum l one blockchain.
00:04:49.202 - 00:04:50.186, Speaker B: Which is really important.
00:04:50.288 - 00:05:35.250, Speaker C: So loop ring and ZK rollups allows you to scale up transactions, tradings payments into thousands and thousands of transactions per second, but with the same security guarantees of the main Ethereum blockchain, which is just incredible. In September, loop Ring is releasing the loop ring wallet. This will be a mobile smart contract wallet with ZK rollups tucked in natively. I'm really excited for how this is going to impact the adoption of Ethereum. The rest of the world will be able to experience venmo type transactions, but with the same amount of trustlessness and security of the decentralized future ahead of us. So if you're a trader that's being eaten alive by gas fees. Visit loopring IO to get onboarded into Ethereum's cheapest and fastest exchange.
00:05:35.250 - 00:05:57.050, Speaker C: All it requires is an Ethereum address, and you can trade on a high performance order book completely gas free. And transferring Ether and ERC 20 tokens on the platform is completely free. If you visit loopering IO, enter the code bankless in order to get the highest vip tier for six months. So check that out. There's a link in the show notes. Visit looping IO, enter code bankless.
00:05:57.210 - 00:06:32.906, Speaker A: All right, let's get to the episode with Vance Bankless Nation. We are so excited to bring on our special guest, Vance Spencer. Vance is the co founder of Framework Ventures, which is a Defi first crypto fund. We'll talk about what that means in just a minute. But it basically means he and his partner had the thesis of Defi before it was cool. Now everyone's doing it. He's got a background in Silicon Valley as well.
00:06:32.906 - 00:06:38.426, Speaker A: Vance, how the heck are you doing? Is this a Defi bull market, my friend, that we're in?
00:06:38.528 - 00:07:07.882, Speaker D: Hey, thanks for having me on. Is this a defi bull market? It certainly seems like there's a lot of enthusiasm. I think, with all the vegetable coins coming out, I think it's good to see the technology progress. It's good to see the community rallying around these kind of new primitives. It's good to see more users in the space. I don't know if I would call it a bull run quite yet, but certainly things are heading in the right direction.
00:07:07.966 - 00:07:16.054, Speaker A: All right, so maybe I missed some vegetable coins, guys. What else is there? I know there's yams, but are we at, like, potatoes? Are we broccoli yet?
00:07:16.172 - 00:07:22.410, Speaker D: There's hams, yams, spaghetti. The whole food can defi coins.
00:07:23.150 - 00:07:24.886, Speaker A: So we're hitting all the food groups.
00:07:24.998 - 00:07:37.994, Speaker D: Yeah, you got to hit all your food groups for proper nutrition. I mean, we're not specifically bullish on one section of the food pyramid versus another, but it's good to see the whole food pyramid getting the attention it deserves.
00:07:38.042 - 00:07:51.186, Speaker A: Well, one thing you've been consistent on is your consistent bull thesis for DeFi. Can we talk about that for a minute? If you were to summarize, Vance, the framework bull thesis for DFI, the why DFI? What is it?
00:07:51.368 - 00:08:40.290, Speaker D: Our pitch on DFI is three things. Number one, finance is the world's largest market for consumer enterprise software. Number two, there's been almost no innovation in finance for the past 30 or 40 years. And the reason there has been no innovation in finance for the past 30 or 40 years is because there's no developer sandbox. If you develop a game or if you develop a social networking app, you can go to the iOS App Store, you can get it on test flight, you can get instant distribution into millions and millions of iPhones. If you want to develop a financial product, your path to getting that out into the market is effectively to go work for Goldman or Morgan Stanley for 20 years, get senior enough to propose some new exotic instrument, and then hope to get it pushed through. There's really no developer first ethos in finance until now.
00:08:40.290 - 00:09:35.710, Speaker D: And what we think Defi is, and this is always evolving, but generally it is the developer sandbox for finance today, anyone in the world, whether you're a developer in India, developer in know, smart kid living on the west coast, east coast, United States, whatever, you can go and build synthetic assets, you can go and build an amm, you can go and build new and interesting applications built off the financial primitives and the tooling that is based on Ethereum today. And that's something that's fundamentally new. And when things get ten to 100 times cheaper, innovation naturally explodes. You saw that with Amazon Web services, you saw that with the iPhone becoming this new developer platform and distribution mechanism. And I think that's kind of where our bullcase for DFI comes from. On a really general sense. In a very specific sense, we're bullish on the people in the industry.
00:09:35.710 - 00:10:05.422, Speaker D: I think it's all just about people. You have the Andres, you have the Michael from curves, you have Kane's, you have Robert Leshner's, you have runes. These are very unique people in the sense that these probably aren't the likely candidates to go and start an equity based company. But the DNA of a founder in this space is just so much different and it's so interesting and they move so fast that it's just hard to not be as bullish on the space as we are on the people in it itself.
00:10:05.556 - 00:10:08.078, Speaker A: So it's really the permissionless aspect of it.
00:10:08.164 - 00:10:35.800, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm super excited to see how we can put the supply chain on a blockchain and track strawberry shipments in real time. But I think the real innovation is going to be just new things that we can do with this technology and just the creativity of developers around the world. Seeing Robert Leschner build a unicorn in two years, that's a huge just flag that he planted in the ground and that's going to serve as a rallying point for people.
00:10:37.370 - 00:11:05.278, Speaker A: Vance, I've just on this permissionless point for just 1 second some people outside of Defi have said, well, if the traditional banking system just opened up all of their APIs, you'd basically have the same thing. So there's efforts to do that in Europe, and maybe it's more advanced in Europe than it is in the US. Do you believe that's true? What if all of the banking infrastructure API layer just sort of opened up? Would we have permissionless finance that way, too?
00:11:05.364 - 00:11:31.100, Speaker D: So the european regulation as it relates to banks is effectively opening up all APIs for read access. That's a lot different than write access, and it's a lot different than fully kind of embedding permissionlessness within the banking stack itself. So I'm pretty bearish on just like the open up the bank APIs, and we'll have a permissionless finance kind of ecosystem today. I really think you need to re architect this stuff from the ground up.
00:11:31.790 - 00:12:07.960, Speaker B: Yeah, Vance, you said that you're bullish on DeFi because of the financial sandbox. And what we're talking about is there are perhaps ways that the legacy system could open up and be a little bit more modular and experimental. But at the core of the problem, why is traditional finance so gated? Who's gating it? Is it the private banking industry, or is it like the nation state regulations? Why can't we have what we have in the DeFi world today with financial experimentation in the legacy system? Who's holding that back?
00:12:09.210 - 00:12:57.054, Speaker D: It's honestly a mixture of both the enterprises that control the financial stack as it lives today. They really have no incentivization mechanism to open it up for third party developers. And to do a true permissionlessness financial system, they would have to develop new business models. They would have to potentially cannibalize what they already have going. It's just something that doesn't have a very clear value prop for them. And on top of that, you know, they're burdened by regulations and things that they need to do as a financial services business to stay compliant within whatever geography that they're currently located in. So there's the old adage that it's really hard to turn, like just a huge cruise liner, but with a smaller boat, you can be a bit more agile and get placed a bit faster.
00:12:57.054 - 00:13:04.438, Speaker D: So I'm just more bullish on just this bottoms up developer movement rather than like a top down rearchitecture of the existing financial system.
00:13:04.524 - 00:13:51.170, Speaker B: So the DeFi protocols that we've seen lately, and you rattled off a list of DeFi entrepreneurs, DeFi seems to be able to offer the breeding ground for a new type of person. Right. And you listed like Rune Kane, just the leaders of these DeFi protocols that are perhaps technically minded. They're developers, but they're also financially minded as well. And so there seems to be this new breeding ground for these new types of people that are coming from the finance world and also coming from the tech world that is now enabled to do something experimental. And so there is now so many more finance startups that are enabled by crypto and by Defi.
00:13:51.330 - 00:14:38.946, Speaker D: If you look in traditional industries versus what's going on in crypto, the amount of greenfield in crypto, both on the. There's not a lot of people experimenting there yet. And on the kind of, this is just a massive wave that people are going to ride. The opportunity is relatively large compared to just kind of developing a basic C Corp equity style company. But with that comes additional risks. Like, one of the things that I ask founders when they say, we want to do a token, we want to hand this over to the community, we want to fully decentralize this. One of the questions I ask is, are you about that life? Is that something that you really want to do? You're playing for a much larger outcome because you're looking at basically the rearchitecture of finance in the 21st century.
00:14:38.946 - 00:15:11.786, Speaker D: But it also comes with regulatory gray area. It comes with moving organizational control of your baby to a dow or people you don't know. I think the people that do these things the best are the ones that just full on embrace it whole hog and just go for it. You see Andre just distributing Wifi to people based on the premise that this is software that he builds, that he will continue to develop it, but he doesn't want to organize it anymore. That's very powerful. You see Kane doing the same thing with the three Dow structure. You see Robert Leshner doing the same thing with progressive decentralization.
00:15:11.786 - 00:16:03.530, Speaker D: It really isn't for everybody, but the entrepreneurs that self select to be in this space are just of an incredible caliber because they're at the cutting edge of financial technology and of just organizational principles writ large. And so I think maybe it's just the self selection, but the entrepreneurs that we see in this space, the really high quality entrepreneurs, that is the real scarce resource. And they're just frankly, incredible when things really start to get humming. And I think the thing that all these founders probably won't come out and say, but is readily apparent to me, is that these people are playing for much larger outcomes than just a, you know, you might get to a billion, 2 billion, $3 billion valuation for your C Corp equity. And that's great. You'll probably sell it, maybe you'll try to spac it, take it public, whatever, that's great. But when you look at DFI and you look at the cash flows, these protocols accrue.
00:16:03.530 - 00:16:32.694, Speaker D: It's very easy to see these being ten 5100 billion dollar businesses the meme used to be, which coins will be to trillion. But I think that will eventually happen just because of the way the token works in the system and the way it captures value and just the community owned nature of these things. And so I think that's just a long winded way of saying that the entrepreneurs in this space, they're playing for a lot more than just traditional entrepreneurs. And their kind of caliber of talent and attitude has to match that pace.
00:16:32.822 - 00:17:19.014, Speaker A: It seems like you guys aren't just looking in DeFi, but part of the thesis is to find that crypto native unicorn founder. Right. And we'll come back to some of the founders and the archetypes a little bit later, because I think it's super interesting to dive into more. But before we do, can we talk about another element of the thesis that I feel like, framework, the way you've structured your company, is a little bit business. And this is, if I understand it correctly, Vance, you have kind of two sides to your, I guess, investment business. There's two sides to framework. There's kind of the fund side, where you're actually actively investing, and then there's also the lab side, where you're actually participating in these networks in various ways.
00:17:19.014 - 00:17:32.910, Speaker A: So it's almost like an activist investor type of flavor, where you're doing both sides. You're investing in the networks, but you're also participating in them. Can you talk about that a little bit so we can understand how things are structured, why you've decided to structure it that way.
00:17:32.980 - 00:18:12.166, Speaker D: On the activist investor side, I think activists usually comes with a bit of a negative connotation, generally. Like with these protocols, we come in peace. We're definitely opinionated, and we definitely want to see things get done. And I'm happy to be pushy with teams or with the community, just in the spirit of pushing things forward. But our bias is to the protocol and then to the founding team in that order. And early on in the lifecycle, when there's more of a core team than a protocol, that may flip. But once this thing is live, it's like you've created this public park, and it's basically all of our job to maintain it and make sure it doesn't kind of just become this tragedy.
00:18:12.166 - 00:18:37.698, Speaker D: The common style situation in terms of labs and ventures. Ventures is our principal investing entity, and that's where we do most of the venture work out of. But labs. The reason why we have that is because participating actively out of a fund is very difficult. There's admin, there's audit, there's tax complexities. But more than that, you need to have the talent in house. Like we have a full engineering team.
00:18:37.698 - 00:19:03.466, Speaker D: You need to be building infrastructure. You can't really do that at both fund. You need to have mechanisms for participation in governance. And honestly, that works best out of a C Corp. And so the idea of labs was just fully born out of how do we provide services to our portfolio companies in the way that is the most valuable. And so you'll see us doing things like participating in governance. You'll also see us being the largest trader on a lot of the protocols we participate in.
00:19:03.466 - 00:20:03.870, Speaker D: And that's because we've built custom trading infrastructure that does really remarkable things to help bootstrap volume, bootstrap liquidity, and show people how you can use these protocols. An example of that is our futures trading strategy. So what we do is we'll look at Binance, and we'll look at the perps on Binance, and we'll trade them when the funding rate spikes, and we'll hedge that out on know, really we were the first people to figure out that you could do this, and that hedging on synthetics exchange was the best way to hedge a futures bet. But really, we're building this to not only benefit the network in the sense that we're effectively harvesting yield from CFI and giving it to the synthetic staker base. But we're also doing this to show people and lead the way on how you can actually use these decentralized protocols to add value to a trading strategy if you're a trading fund, or if you're a retail customer, or really whatever. And so labs is really just our active participation entity. It's where we kind of demonstrate the value of protocols through, and then coming up here, we're actually going to start building things and spinning them out.
00:20:03.870 - 00:20:19.298, Speaker D: And so eventually we want to kind of see framework ventures as just one business line that we have, while labs kind of does a bunch of different things to support the protocol, to push things forward more generally in DeFi, and just to be a good steward of.
00:20:19.304 - 00:21:08.178, Speaker B: The industry as a fund that is an active user of the protocols that you guys are participating in. You guys get access to some alpha that maybe somebody that just buys a protocols token on Uniswap doesn't have because you guys are in the trenches using the protocol for what it's supposed to be used for, seeing its positive, seeing its negative, seeing where it needs to get fixed. And then also you have a stake in the protocol because you are investing in the tokens of the protocol, which means that you guys are incentivized to work with the teams of these protocols to make their protocol better. So tell us a little bit about that process. So you guys are users of synthetix, you guys are users of Aave. Tell us about your communication with these teams and how this is kind of a conversation about how to iterate and improve the product.
00:21:08.264 - 00:21:48.974, Speaker D: Yeah, so I think the first thing is that, and this is definitely different than traditional venture hedge funds, is that we do 95% of our business out in the open. Whether it's in the Wifi Telegram channel, whether it's in the synthetics discord, whether it's in the ave discord, people can see what we're doing. And I think that gives them a sense that there is no kind of boogeyman behind the curtain with ulterior motives, in the sense that we're just very open and honest and transparent with the communities about what we do. And I think after we did that once, people started to notice it, after we did it twice, it was kind of interesting. But then third time people are like, oh, interesting. These guys are good stewards of the protocol. We can trust them.
00:21:48.974 - 00:22:59.750, Speaker D: And I think when you see this backlash against vcs in the market with things like Wifi or Yams, right or wrong, I think that's why we haven't really been looped into that bucket just because we're super close to the metal, we're super transparent and people just know that we come in peace. So I think that's kind of one aspect of what we do. But you're totally right in the sense that our whole strategy is that instead of being super large, we're just going to be super agile, we're going to be the first, we're going to be the heaviest user, we're going to be the closest to the metal. We're going to understand how these protocols work at an atomic level, so that when it comes to making investment decisions, we can make those as accurately as any person on the planet. And really this shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody. But the only way to learn about stuff is to just do it and then to figure out if you're interested or if it's working for you kind of later down the road. And so using these protocols and getting into the dna of what's going on and understanding how the smart contracts are architected and what the vulnerabilities are, that's just the standard part of our due diligence process in a way that I don't think is fundamental to many other firms.
00:22:59.750 - 00:23:11.910, Speaker D: And that's because we have a full engineering team. That's because we have a full trading architecture. That's because we're just super close to the teams and the DNA and the culture of the space itself. And I think that is, in a lot of ways, our unique advantage.
00:23:12.590 - 00:24:19.838, Speaker A: Vance, it kind of strikes me that we're just talking about what you look for is crypto native founders, essentially, right? So they're not going to be the know cast, the typical archetype who would start a Silicon Valley firm. Well, you guys are also not structured as the typical VC fund or the typical even crypto hedge fund. It's more of a crypto native fund type approach that you're taking. Right. And what also strikes me is that what you've been able to produce with this approach is this really incredible feedback loop where as you're stewards of the network and you add value to the network, well, then you start getting invited into the network more by the grassroots community. It also provides a way for you to really learn about what you're investing in. It strikes me, I don't know if you think this is the case, but it strikes me that many, even crypto funds don't actually know what they're investing in when they're buying a token and when they're investing in something.
00:24:19.838 - 00:24:33.810, Speaker A: And certainly the traditional funds have no idea what they're buying. Do you see a lot of that? Is there an information arbitrage that you guys have because you're actually participating in these things and using defi that they don't.
00:24:36.070 - 00:25:24.898, Speaker D: Not to toot my own horn, but absolutely, we get a lot of questions of, how are you guys this close? How do you guys have this much information advantage? And I think the honest answer is just like, this is literally all we know. Michael and I live together. We started the fund together. We've known each other for five years and have been best friends in the foxhole of crypto and other startups throughout that. And I think just like the relationship between Michael and I and just our commitment to building something that can be quite large and hopefully outlast us is really kind of what separates us. And just in terms of bringing the same intensity to work every single day, reading everything on crypto Twitter, meeting every single person. If anybody in the link marines or in the synthetic Spartan needs help with the resume or editing things like that, we will actually help them.
00:25:24.898 - 00:26:10.130, Speaker D: And it's not just because this is some psyop information advantage. It's just like, this is because this is all we do, literally. And so just being as humanly close to the possible, or humanly as close to the metal as possible is really where all of our advantage derives from. And I think what's really cool for us is we saw these couple of chinese blockchain outlets that posted this full story about us, and it was really well researched, and it had all the details of how the fund started and what our thesis was and the projects we've been in, and we literally had no communication with those people before they posted. I'm on. I'm on Google translate, like, trying to read kind of broken Chinese in English. And it's just like, people notice this stuff.
00:26:10.130 - 00:27:02.062, Speaker D: When you're authentic, when you're showing up every day, when you're bringing that same intensity, and when you're just showing that you're good stewards, it reaps benefits. It might take a little bit, like, we were deeply uncool for probably the better part of a year, and a lot of people still think our style is pretty whack, but this is basically what we do, and it's like the best job ever, and we're super thankful for it. And we're just kind of determined to keep giving back to the community and keep pushing things forward. And I want to get to another point that you made, which is, these aren't the typical founders. These aren't the typical people that you might invest in. I think that is one of the things that I enjoy the most out of crypto is just the sheer volume of the number of characters in this space. Kane is basically a pseudo anarchist.
00:27:02.062 - 00:27:05.102, Speaker D: It's pretty funny to me, but that's kind of what he is.
00:27:05.256 - 00:27:08.006, Speaker B: Straight up. Not even a little bit.
00:27:08.108 - 00:27:26.762, Speaker D: Danny is like this pretty funny finish guy. Michael igrov is ex particle physicist, and it's just like, the amount of people you meet in this space is super interesting, and it's what keeps me super motivated. And I just think it's just an incredible vertical to be in right now.
00:27:26.816 - 00:27:31.866, Speaker A: I feel like it's just like the island of misfit toys, like everybody, and.
00:27:31.888 - 00:27:52.180, Speaker D: Then you have someone like Andre who he launched Wi Fi, and then I called him like 2 hours later, just like first kind of out of the blue call, and he described himself know the Joker in know chasing a it. He wouldn't know what to do with it. And immediately after that call, I looked at Michael and I was know, we have to buy as much of this as humanly possible.
00:27:53.350 - 00:27:57.794, Speaker A: That's a complete opposite of what a Silicon Valley VC firm would do, by the way.
00:27:57.912 - 00:28:46.014, Speaker D: Oh, yeah. And there was discussion about it, and there was kind of like looking at the business model and what this could possibly be. And I posted a short Twitter thread about the thesis on, you know, things like that and opportunities like that you really have to be prepared for. And if you have a traditional VC mindset in this space, I don't think it's just part of your natural kind of reflexes to think openly about. For us, we saw Andre in this anti VC movement as a theme, and the fundamentals of the business were sound. But if you're a venture capitalist and you see a theme that explicitly excludes know, that should immediately be a cue for you to get exposure to it, because purposefully, you're not supposed to be part of that. And if you can kind of help subvert that and help the company and help the narrative and help the protocol, you can add outsized value to that investment.
00:28:46.014 - 00:28:51.270, Speaker D: And so just like weird opportunities like that is just the stuff that we live for.
00:28:51.340 - 00:30:09.950, Speaker B: It seems to be to me, that framework ventures suffered through the bear market just like the rest of us, right? And also just like the protocols that framework invested in. One of the topics that we're going to go into is what happens to a protocol and its community when it goes to a bear market and how it comes out of that. And it seems to me that you guys survived the bear market by just using this sandbox that is defi as your ground for sharpening your sticks, right, as your ground for getting better and kind of shedding traditional thought and just learning what works in the moment, right? And then as a result of this, you guys have turned into just, it turns out what works is just being good governors of a protocol. As a result of this, you guys have invested in things that you know have worked, and you guys are now the stewards of these protocols. And so at this point, how do you guys, because you guys have limited energies, you guys have limited capital, because capital is not infinite. So at this point, now that we've gone through this bear market, and now we seem to be, quote, unquote, going into a bull market. How has your learnings guided what you guys now decide to invest in? Like, what are the criteria for a protocol that you guys really look for that kind of matches this thesis that you guys have generated over the last.
00:30:10.020 - 00:31:11.042, Speaker D: Two years, I think at this point, and we started with probably 20 million when the fund started. At this point, our energy is probably the rate limiter and Michael and I's time versus our capital. We could make seed investments, series A investments all day. But the stuff that we've always kind of internalized and talked about is not becoming the spray and prey vcs that do a bunch of different projects and have no conviction or very little conviction, or just kind of working off of the signaling of other vcs and letting them kind of do the cognitive work for them. For us, I think we've always taken a lot of pride in investing in things that are deeply unpopular, whether it be chainlink, which nobody has liked for a long time, except for lots of kind of grassroots organizations. Synthetics, which got hacked, was a stablecoin project, was located in Australia, that didn't seem like a natural candidate to be a good project. But all this stuff, it just comes down to the people.
00:31:11.042 - 00:32:05.380, Speaker D: For us, like who is leading the project, who is sitting in the chair, it's cool to have all these big brain thesis about the future of money and the future of finance and all that good stuff. And to a certain extent, we want to see sound business logic, good rationale, and thinking through the plan. But more than that, the people that are sitting in the chairs are doing the work. If you have a cornerstone leader, like a kane or a rune or a leschner, they're a magnet for talent. And if you get enough people that are smart and are dedicated and that are in tune with this movement and issuing a token and living that type of life, a lot of it is possible. And so I think from our lifecycle as a fund, we've shifted from being very thesis oriented, which we still are to a certain extent, to being a lot more people oriented now. And in a world where everything is conducted over Zoom, we haven't met probably 70% of the founders in our portfolio in person.
00:32:05.380 - 00:32:46.206, Speaker D: It really becomes how good of a judge of character, of work ethic, of integrity are you? And I think know Michael and I just happen to be pretty decent at that. But also our networking crypto has just kind of like allowed us to vet these opportunities a bit. You know, for us, the stuff that we really enjoy is making an investment, giving them a year, year and a half to get the protocol out to market and just working with them in a really deep way to help kind of bring that to fruition. Future swap is an example of that. That's hopefully launching in the next month. Fractal is another example of that, which will probably be a little bit more of a gestation period into next year. Teller is an example that will launch this year.
00:32:46.206 - 00:32:54.994, Speaker D: But that's our bread and butter. Like, working with people and helping them build things that are important and sticking with them through the good and the bad is really just kind of what we do.
00:32:55.112 - 00:33:47.166, Speaker B: Finding good talent, good people, and sticking with them through the good and the bad, that's a great lead into where I kind of want to go next with this conversation. And where that is is actually, I want to go backwards and I want to go back into 2018, 2019, which was the grueling bear market. Right? And we've been talking about some of these all star founders that are talent magnets, but not only are they talent magnets, they're also community magnets. Right? And so far, I think it's very fair to say that all of the DFI tokens that have done these kind of insane returns in 2020 and even before that are tokens that also generated community. So can you comment on how these successful DFI protocols are? The protocols that came out of the bear market with a working protocol and a very strong community, the talent breeds.
00:33:47.358 - 00:34:29.810, Speaker D: More talent, and then that breeds community, and then the product needs to be there. But once those things hit full stride, they can be very powerful. And I think for us, thinking about communities and how those spread and how those become viral is a fundamental part of what we do. And it's basically just like our ecosystem strategy. If you look at all of our protocols, you can probably notice a very common theme. Chainlink provides data to probably all of the protocols that we invest in. All of the protocols that we invest in work together, providing their assets to each other, giving preferred access to technical resources, and just kind of having deep technical and cultural integrations.
00:34:29.810 - 00:35:17.970, Speaker D: And so I think this isn't something that a lot of firms have hit on quite yet. But when you can take one protocol and you can mesh that community with another, it's so much easier than just doing a cold start of a community. When you can combine things and when you can get people to work together, and when you have this idea of a tent where everybody's in the tent, everybody's growing together, everybody's extremely happy. That is one of the more powerful concepts in crypto. And I think the marquee example of that is when synthetics started using Chainlink oracles. The combination of those two communities really bred this fervor and this interest and excitement in not only a really great use case for Chainlink, but a high quality customer and synthetics that could really help chainlink and ride the wave of just defi in general. So I think that's kind of my first point just on the bear markets.
00:35:17.970 - 00:36:00.286, Speaker D: Just the resilience and the perpetual optimism of founders throughout the past couple of years has just been incredible. Perpetual optimism, believing in yourself, believing that you're going to prevail, demonstrating passion and confidence. These things are force multipliers. This can take you from a few people supporting your project to hundreds, if not thousands, if not tens of thousands. And that's one of the main things that we look for in people, is, do they have that perpetual optimism to ride out the highs and the lows? Because Michael and I, just from firsthand experience, have had to do that as well. We've had years where things haven't been awesome. We've had years like this one where things have been really good.
00:36:00.286 - 00:36:18.578, Speaker D: But it's all about having the perpetual optimism and the focus that you will prevail, and that things are going to go your way. It's just a matter of kind of banging your head against the wall a number of times until it works. And that's kind of the main thing that we look for as we go through kind of the bear and bull markets that are pretty common to this space.
00:36:18.664 - 00:37:11.222, Speaker B: I think that the most interesting thing that I've observed over the 2019 transition into 2020 of these protocols is the creation of culture in every single protocol. And we have these memes, these shelling points of a logo or a mascot for every single protocol. We have the link marines, we have the synthetics Spartans. I think Ave is now the Ave Avengers at this point. And so these community of people who are inherently interested in Defi, and maybe all had some semblance of some thesis of Defi, and that's why they were there, all stuck around through this bear market together. It's the people that are provably in it for the tech, almost. And then also, at the same time, there's also the financial returns, if you have the conviction enough.
00:37:11.222 - 00:38:15.734, Speaker B: But going through the bear market as a community together generates this culture and community. And that's why we see a lot of memes coming out of every single DFI protocol that has successfully made it through this bear market. And so what I'm bullish on is exactly what you said, where each Defi protocol is its own tribe, but they're not tribal. And the concept of composability in Ethereum, the composable protocols, begins to make composable communities, and that ultimately coalesces into this one single Defi community that I think was successfully tapped into by yams. Because if you go to the Yams finance page, you see a place for every single one of these communities to work with Yams. And that's what Yams really was, was like this pinnacle of community that captured this energy and turned it into this own meme generating thing. And then we've also seen memes and culture already emerge extremely quickly out of the yearn and wifey systems.
00:38:15.734 - 00:38:24.250, Speaker B: So when you guys think about protocols and communities, how do you guys fit in culture? Or is it kind of just like an interesting afterthought?
00:38:24.750 - 00:39:15.038, Speaker D: No, I mean, it's literally the first thing that we think about. I think the community that we're best known for is probably the link Marines and just playing a very early role in helping kind of develop that. But to your point, it's so true. I don't know if you really have a community until it's been through not in a bear market, but just a market or a period of time where things are more dicey and less. Sure, in a bear market is a great way to purge out the people who are not true believers. And you see a lot of the memes and the culture and the offhand, kind of like inside jokes form in these periods of tumult. And I think that's perfect because you want to really kind of have a strong foundation of your community and an identity of who it is before you take it to a mass market.
00:39:15.038 - 00:40:03.802, Speaker D: And the best way to do that is through kind of a bear market. In terms of your point about composable communities, that's exactly kind of our thesis on community management and starting. It's so hard to cold start a community. If you can use, whether it be another community or just a general theme, to kind of bootstrap your protocol to a certain level of usage and attention, that's the best way to do it. And I think a great example of that is just Aave, really. If you look at Aave's rise, most of its TVL, at least initially, and through kind of probably mid this year, was Chainlink, and they were the first people to adopt Chainlink oracles. Everybody who loves ChainLink puts all of their chainlink on Aave because they know it's secured by oracles that they trust, and that's been a really symbiotic community.
00:40:03.802 - 00:40:55.614, Speaker D: And I think that's one of the coolest things about this space, is that it's not zero sum. You can have a partnership in crypto that is so technically and culturally integrated in a way that really isn't possible in traditional startups. And I think that is just one of the superpowers that this space has, is that not only are things technically composable, they're culturally composable. And that's just like something that we think about a lot. And the other thing we think about is just smallness. The best things start very small, and there's this sense of either exclusivity, or there's this sense that the rest of the market is ignoring you, and that smallness breeds fervor and that fervor breeds a few more followers, and those followers are really interested, and that eventually kind of slowly starts to seep into the mainstream. And identifying these little cultural nuances and determining how they spread is something that I spend a lot of my time on.
00:40:55.614 - 00:41:20.406, Speaker D: And I think other investors kind of think of this as like you're looking at memes all day, and it's like, yeah, I'm looking at memes all day, but that's part of my job. I'm being paid to identify themes and which themes might be profitable as long as they're followed up by solid technology, hell yeah, that's what I'm going to do. And if that means spending time on a four chan or Reddit or crypto Twitter for hours and hours each day, that's just what I'm going to do.
00:41:20.588 - 00:41:25.560, Speaker A: Well, I guess the meme is just really the rallying cry for that culture, that community we're talking about.
00:41:26.250 - 00:42:21.866, Speaker B: Hey, guys, going bankless is a journey, and you don't have to do it alone. So we're going to pause the episode with Vance really quick so we can talk about some of the fantastic bankless sponsors that offer you tools to help you live a bankless life. As we all go westward, we need to get our values into the crypto world, but hopefully escape the tyranny of centralized rent seeking institutions. And that's where monolith can help you get your value into the crypto world while skipping over the crypto banks. Coming soon to Monolith is an on ramp directly from your old World bank account into your smart contract wallet on Ethereum. And for those that don't know, Monolith also has a Defi card which uses Dai in your smart contract wallet, but on the Visa network. So you can go to your grocery store, swipe your defi card, pay for your groceries like a normal person, and still be part of the crypto, bankless crypto economic future that we are all excited about.
00:42:21.866 - 00:42:38.462, Speaker B: So you can get your value from your bank account directly into your crypto Visa card without having to go through any crypto bank intermediary, which is just absolutely fantastic. So in order to get started, go to monolith XYZ and get your bankless Visa card.
00:42:38.516 - 00:43:08.054, Speaker A: Today, I want to tell you about another bankless tool that I personally use. It's fantastic. This one is for our us listeners. It's called rocket dollar. So if you have an IRA or a 401, the problem is it's jailed inside of your brokerage. So your fidelity account, your Schwab account, that means you don't have good access to crypto. The only crypto that you can buy is in a trust form, and it's marked up like five x six x eight x.
00:43:08.054 - 00:43:38.818, Speaker A: The price, you're getting ripped off. So what you need to do is break your retirement account out of jail, set up something called a self directed IRA or a self directed 401K. We've written articles about this on bank list that we'll include in the show notes. Rocket dollar takes care of all of the pain in getting set up. They help you with the paperwork. You could break your retirement account out of jail and also use the bankless code to get $50 off. So make sure you use that code bankless when you sign up on rocketdollar.com
00:43:38.818 - 00:43:40.450, Speaker A: to get $50 off.
00:43:40.600 - 00:43:47.140, Speaker B: All right, guys, let's go ahead and get right back into the interview with Vance, because there's a lot of bullishness ahead, and I'm really excited about it.
00:43:47.510 - 00:44:44.002, Speaker A: I want to return to the way David started talking about this, which is the bear market, and get back to that theme that you were just talking about, Vance, of conviction. Because now that DeFi is on the upswing, I think we quickly forget what it was like in the bear market, like how unorthodox these types of perspectives were, how contrarian they were, and how convicted you actually had to be to do some of the moves that you guys made in 2018 and 2019. I want to talk about some of those moves specifically and some of those investments specifically. I mean, first of all, as a sector, people thought not only crypto was dead, right? But maybe bitcoin is the only app. And there was this maximalist kind of movement that did. Okay. But inside of crypto, everyone thought Defi was just this niche.
00:44:44.002 - 00:45:31.970, Speaker A: Everybody was investing in ETH killers, right? The next smart contract platform that would replace EtH and supersede it. Everyone thought that bitcoin was the only app. And what I'm really interested in is how some of your investments had conviction, even among the insiders. So let's talk about synthetics for a minute. So you guys are well known for a concentrated bet on synthetics when it wasn't very popular, and I'll confess, I was there back then. Right. So when synthetics was called Haven, and Haven didn't quite work, the way I understood it in 2018 or so, was that it was kind of like a maker competitor, and I think that was kind of the popular belief.
00:45:31.970 - 00:45:59.390, Speaker A: There was this belief that protocols can't really pivot. There was this belief that there was already a stable coin. If it was going to work in Defi, it would probably be Dai and maker, and nobody was. It was not popular to invest in SNX, to invest in synthetics. But what did you guys see that everyone else didn't? Why did you have such conviction about that investment at a time? It was massively unpopular.
00:46:00.210 - 00:46:51.530, Speaker D: Yeah. So we met Kane at the web3 conference in Berlin last year, and that was kind of our first introduction to the team. And we met him through Sergey, kind of on the pretenses that they would be one of the users of their oracles. And it really just started from a dinner of hanging out with Kane and hearing about his backstory and hanging out with Justin and hearing about his time as one of the technical leads at Mongodb, and talking to Jordan, their business development guy, who is just incredibly smart and savy. And back then, crypto was pretty much dead. And it was like, wow, these guys are really talented. What are they still doing in this space? What do they know that we don't know? Over a period of months, we would have calls with them and we would kick the tires, and we would hear the vision.
00:46:51.530 - 00:48:21.034, Speaker D: And they were very upfront about the shortcomings of Haven and protocol and the Oracle hack. And I can't describe how deeply unpopular SNX was, because it had literally just been one of the biggest hacks in Defi. And for us, we acknowledged that we saw it, we took their answers at face value, that they would fix these things, that Chainlink was a viable solution to their oracle problem and the vulnerabilities that it had, and we tried to see where would defi be going next, and it's a mixture of high quality synthetic assets that represent not only the US dollar, but the korean yuan, leverage, bitcoin leverage, Tesla, and it's a mixture of that, and then it's a mixture of these reflexive token economics, which not only build a balance sheet for the protocol itself, but it also builds this mini trading game where people are hedging their debt and they're kind of trading against each other. And really the hardest thing to do in a d five protocol is to get your first hundred users that are trading real size. And this seemed just like a natural solution to that problem. And so from that, from understanding the size of the opportunity, if you knew nothing about crypto, and I dropped you in crypto, and I said, point to where the profit centers are, you would immediately go to binance and BitMex and you would say, holy shit, if you can get leverage, you're going to make a ton of money. This is the only space that you should be paying attention to.
00:48:21.034 - 00:48:52.386, Speaker D: This is the only space you should be investing in. Spot markets are potentially not that interesting. Everything else is probably too early. But if you can get to some type of decentralized bitmex, that's a huge opportunity. And our thesis has evolved since then. I think synthetix is very likely to become a decentralized bitmex style player. But I also think when you're issuing SUSD, SBTC, and those are viable inputs to the yield farming kind of craze that will take place over the next five to ten years, it has this interesting optionality as a protocol.
00:48:52.386 - 00:49:49.418, Speaker D: And so from that, from Michael and I talking just from us batting around these ideas 1000 times, from talking to Kane 100 times, we got to the point where we put in, I think it was like 16% of our fund, into synthetics. And it's kind of one of those moments where you clasp your hands, you take a deep breath, and then you're. But you know, I think one of the things that we pride ourselves on is just know more conviction in our fingernails than a lot of people do in their whole body when they start investing in stuff. And I think that just comes from doing deep research. Michael and I being able to be open and honest with each other about the shortcomings or the potential protocols. And just for us acknowledging that this fund, this concept, we view this as a startup, it's always day one for us. We always need to be willing to take risks that potentially seem a little bit crazy to the extent that they're well thought through.
00:49:49.584 - 00:50:43.530, Speaker A: 16% is a very concentrated bet, my friend. Like, kudos for having that one pay off. And again, I just can't overestimate how unpopular SNX was at that point in time. People were calling it a scam. It was not a popular decision to make. One thing that's tripped me up and maybe trips me up a little bit still, about SNX, maybe you can address Vance, is people say it's a recursive model, right? So it's basically all the synthetics that you were just talking about, which a defi bull would say, yeah, of course, synthetics are going to be massive in defi, massive on Ethereum, but the fact that all of synthetics, synthetics are based on the value of SNX is somewhat recursive. It's almost like Wells Fargo backing all of its deposits with Wells Fargo stock.
00:50:43.530 - 00:50:52.282, Speaker A: What do you say to this point? Because I think it's tripped some people up about synthetics as a platform and as an investment.
00:50:52.426 - 00:51:47.760, Speaker D: Yeah. And I fully hear and understand those concerns. It's reflexive on its way up, and it's potentially reflexive on its way down. But for us, the idea that you can build this balance sheet in your native token, and that generates this reflexivity, which effectively forces people to trade and bootstraps your first hundred users, that leads to the idea of synthetics, the trading volume of synthetics, and just the culture of synthetics spreading. To the extent that more people learn about it, more people trade it, who are not SNX stakers. And then you eventually add in different types of collateral, like ETH, like bitcoin, to build that balance sheet out of things that are not just synthetics, that eventually you will get to this ecosystem that is not just relying on synthetics collateral, but all the fees are going to synthetic stakers that is a bit more healthy. And those are things that we talk to the synthetics team about that we're actively pushing for.
00:51:47.760 - 00:52:47.570, Speaker D: The reality is that they have a lot of things on their roadmap that will, just, outside of the question of SNX collateral, make the debt pool a lot healthier. Whether that's an open interest funding rate, whether that's leveraged futures, whether that is using synths effectively, virtual tokens on one inch and curve to make this interesting virtual bridge. The problems of synthetics are probably larger than just SNX's bad collateral. If you could identify the top three problems of synthetics, that would probably be number three to me, maybe even lower. I think the better arguments are, how do you grow trading volume more organically? How do you construct a trading incentive program that pushes volume through the exchange. How do you deal with cannibalization of synth trading volume on centralized exchanges or protocols, like uniswap versus synthetics exchange. But these are all good criticisms.
00:52:47.570 - 00:53:06.198, Speaker D: These aren't bad ideas or poorly reasoned things to think about for us. I just think if you have growth, if you have interest in trading synths, if you can get them integrated into more places, a lot of the growth that comes with that will solve a lot of the fundamental problems of the protocol itself.
00:53:06.284 - 00:53:11.786, Speaker A: It will put. Okay, so let's talk about another one. So link. When did you guys get into link?
00:53:11.968 - 00:53:24.378, Speaker D: Oh, man, link. So we got into link in. I think it was September 4, 2017.
00:53:24.554 - 00:53:43.314, Speaker A: Okay. All right. So if people are go take a look at the charts and see what the price of link was September 4. You said 2017, not 2018. Okay. All right. I think at the time.
00:53:43.314 - 00:54:31.122, Speaker A: 20 17, 20, 18, 20 19 or so, probably the insider thought, again, outsiders just thought, this whole DFI, this whole crypto thing is dead. But insiders thought this, including myself, oracles are going to be super important, right? No dispute there, no argument there. They're going to be super important for DeFi. But link itself has very little value. Right. It's just another utility token, and we just came off of an ICO mania where all of these utility tokens went to zero. Right? So that might have been the common insider DFI insider belief, but you guys started making bets in 2017, and then I imagine you followed up in subsequent years with even more.
00:54:31.122 - 00:54:43.110, Speaker A: So what did you see about link, maybe as a system, and also about the value accrual mechanism of link that all of the DeFi insiders and crypto insiders.
00:54:45.290 - 00:56:02.766, Speaker D: So the genesis of our link investment was Michael found this paper called Town Crier, which is effectively about how you can securely bring data off chain to on chain. And it's written by Ra Jules, who's a professor at IC three, which is the Cornell Institute for Cryptocurrencies, who we've met a couple of times. So the relationship was with some context, and we read it and we were like, wow, this is really smart. If there was a monetization mechanism and incentivization mechanism for an oracle network to do this, that would be very powerful. Just because if you think about it from 100,000 foot perspective, if you think about where value accrues in a blockchain world, because blockchains don't have networking capabilities, a good choke point for pricing power, and for value accrual is where data feeds or output payments get processed into and out of blockchains. And so philosophically, we thought that that was probably the main place where value would accrue. And that if you built a sufficiently robust oracle network, it would not only be this thing where developers were using it just for kind of one off price feeds or things like that, it would really become fundamental middleware for developers to really build products.
00:56:02.766 - 00:57:13.698, Speaker D: And at the end state, developers would probably end up interacting more with an oracle network as it starts to store private keys, do off chain computation, bring data from off chain to on chain than they actually would the Ethereum base layer itself. And so, you know, that was the original thesis, and it's developed over time. And for us, we knew Sergey, and so the idea that this thing would take two or three years, that was okay with us as long as we could talk to him and kind of bounce ideas off of him. And when things were super dicey in 2018, we could get just some idea of what the plan was and kind of like what his general vision was for the entire Oracle network. And I think for us, we view Chainlink as effectively an insurance business, and we view the Chainlink token as much the same. If you look at the value that Chainlink is securing, it's about three and a half billion dollars right now in terms of projects that have integrated these oracles into their fundamental architecture. And this is the value that Chainlink is securing.
00:57:13.698 - 00:58:30.926, Speaker D: On the daily active volume side, it's probably 500 million to a billion dollars in volume that Chainlink is actively securing from McDEx to DyDX to other kind of trading protocols. And so, really, I think for us, the grand vision of Chainlink is, number one, it's going to be a payment token for the ecosystem itself. But number two, it's just going to be effectively this insurance layer, once staking comes out, where people are verifying the quality and accuracy of their data feeds coming from off chain to on chain, and it'll kind of be valued at the similar multiple of maybe an insurance company. And so that's kind of the general arc of the investment and the thesis, the things that really tipped us off early, that this could be something special, was just the community in early days, that was on four Chan, and that's Horizon's own problems. But in terms of a forum for forward thinking, sometimes edgy talk about technology, four Chan is relatively undervalued. It was the first forum that I read about Ethereum on, again, the first forum that I read about bitcoin on. If you're looking for people who are dissatisfied with the status quo that are highly technical, that's usually a good place to look.
00:58:30.926 - 00:58:48.280, Speaker D: And I think with the rise of Defi shitcoins being traded on four chan, it's probably a little bit less signal today. But way back in the day that was something that stood out to us and we could say, wow, this is informed discussion about what this could be. It's very likely the community brews around this.
00:58:48.730 - 00:59:16.766, Speaker A: That's another thing only a crypto native fund would do is pick up investment thesis ideas from fortune. But for people who didn't pull up the graph. Right, so you're talking about September. In November or so 2017, Link was trading at about eighteen cents per link today. Right now it's about 15. Got as high as, I don't know, let's see here. $20, $20.
00:59:16.766 - 00:59:54.860, Speaker A: Okay, so that's been a successful investment. All of these utility tokens you mentioned, payment token. You also made the case for kind of insurance. Why Link has to be value bowl because it'll be used for staking. But a whole bunch of tokens in that class ended up dying in 2017 and have never come back. What is it about the chain link community? Where do the chain link marines come from? Where does chain link God on Twitter? Where does he come from? Who is that guy? So many questions about Link.
00:59:55.630 - 01:00:01.440, Speaker D: So we were doing an interview with Bloomberg and the woman was like, do you know who chainlink God is?
01:00:01.890 - 01:00:02.880, Speaker A: No way.
01:00:04.450 - 01:01:30.390, Speaker D: I was just like, that is not what I thought we would be talking about. All right, so on the token itself, I think the most important thing to understand about Chainlink is that it's in v, one of its network, and it'll be probably ten versions before the thing is fully decentralized and the token is fully used in the payment mechanism. And the staking, or the staking will probably be sooner than that. But eventually what they're trying to do is just build out this two sided marketplace where you have data requesters and data providers, and right now they bootstrap that with the aggregator contracts and they bootstrapped that with node incentive subsidies, where if projects want an oracle, they can trust the 21 top node operators on cosmos, which are effectively the same node operators on Chainlink to provide that same base layer security to their data feeds. And if your base layer isn't as secure as your oracle network, I really don't understand the premise of building on blockchain other than regulatory arbitrage. So I think that's the most important thing. As the network matures, it's going to move from an aggregator contract to more of a service level agreement where smart contracts and node incentives or node operators are interacting on a service level basis to provide data and then have things like which type of infrastructure are you running? Okay, how much insurance are you willing to stake on this oracle request? And so on and so forth.
01:01:30.390 - 01:03:14.534, Speaker D: So that's going to take a little bit. But our vision of this network is that it starts with DeFi, it expands an enterprise, and eventually this just becomes the entire middleware for the smart contract powered economy, which is definitely a buzword, but it's entirely true. If you ask people back in the day about how long it took them to sign documents and how onerous that process was, and then when docusign came along, how much of a seat change that was in the pace of business and how much more effective things were, that's largely what I think will happen with blockchain and oracles and things like that. So it's a huge bet on the future of the industry as a whole and the need for high quality data on chain in terms of the link marines and where they come from. It's funny, populism is real in crypto, having these leaders which are not driven by venture capitalists, which don't have this kind of undertone as being elitist, which a lot of honestly, the blockchain marketing and the blockchain ethos comes off as to normal people that spread this community of people that are just interested in the concept that oracles are powerful and they can potentially play a huge role in kind of the next phase of blockchain. And I think that having just a more diverse base of people than smart contract developers and wealthy people that live on the west coast of the United States, that actually breeds a healthier community than just kind of the circular stuff that we see a lot of in whether it be DeFi or blockchain writ large. And so when people ask where do the link marines come from? It's honestly everywhere.
01:03:14.534 - 01:03:36.910, Speaker D: I've met people who are literally blacksmiths in Tennessee that are link know hitting me up on know. I've met people in Florida that are link marines that are looking for help with their know. It's really a movement that exists outside of the popular narratives of DeFi today. And if you think of things that are indicative of where the future is going, that's usually pretty prescient.
01:03:37.250 - 01:04:16.842, Speaker A: Yeah, we were talking earlier about that VC backlash. I mean, I guess this is all part of it, part of this populism and I got to say, part of the reason the bankless movement has been so successful to this point is due to that. Right. At some level, people see the vcs as well as they should. The Silicon Valley VCs and the east coast Wall street folks, they see those people as the banking. Like. That's kind of what this movement is meant to disrupt, right? It's about bringing some credible neutrality to the every man, so everyone competes equally in these markets rather than having an established class sort of get advantages.
01:04:16.842 - 01:04:20.640, Speaker A: So I can see it now that you put it that way.
01:04:21.090 - 01:04:58.822, Speaker D: Absolutely. I mean, that's what this whole movement is about. You can go on your computer with any amount of money you have deposited into ave or yield farming or really whatever, and earn money. There's no middleman. You don't need to rely on some centralized institution. And I think that is hugely powerful. The venture capital backlash in this space is not just constrained to some of the egregious behavior that funds displayed in the 2017 run up with the smart contract platforms and ideas that just weren't well thought through that people pumped money into and then dumped on retail.
01:04:58.822 - 01:05:19.310, Speaker D: But it's indicative of a larger, larger societal trend of people being sick of a few institutions, a few people having information rights and information advantages over the rest of people. And so for us, we're all for this populist wave in crypto just because I think it speaks well to the ethos of what we're trying to accomplish.
01:05:19.470 - 01:06:42.842, Speaker B: So this brings up a really good point, and it's a conversation that's pretty close to my heart. And so we have Ave, we have synthetix, we have link, we have compound, and we have the compound governance module, and then we also have yield farming and liquidity mining. And what all these things are trying to do is trying to get tokens into the hands of the users in order to turn over the keys of the kingdom to the users that are actually using the protocol. And partly we want to do that because that's part of the ethos of cryptocurrency. But also the teams that are building these things need to exit because a lot of what is going on in DeFi is straight up regulatory arbitrage, right? Like a large part of the cryptocurrency world is ignoring the regulations of the nation state and doing their own thing in a way that is the best for the user, but not at all best for the nation state. And so we just talked about, like, the banking class, right, that is an institution of people and finance that doesn't really want things to change, and they definitely don't want DeFi protocols to kind of soak up all the value in the space. And so if Aave and compound, and if all of these defi protocols grow to as big as we hope that they will, there is inevitably going to be some backlash.
01:06:42.842 - 01:07:42.254, Speaker B: And so that's why compound started this whole movement with this governance token that now all these other protocols are following suit. Because I think everyone knows that in the future there's going to be a lot of vested interest in stopping this movement. Right? Like the legacy system, the incumbents don't want things to change because that's what incumbents do. What this bull market, I think really resembles is this coming more or less middle finger to the legacy system that is giving over the keys to the kingdom before the nation state and the nation state regulators can even figure out what is actually going on. And the idea here is we're going to liquidity mine these tokens and get them into the hands of the users so that no one can enforce KYC, so that no one can actually know who these users are. And so these protocols gain anti fragility through. Is that.
01:07:42.254 - 01:07:48.980, Speaker B: Is that an okay take? Is there anything that you want to throw a flag there? Or is that something that you kind of agree with?
01:07:49.910 - 01:08:22.738, Speaker D: The protocol for launching a protocol today is much different than it was two years ago. It's not. Let's get a bunch of ICO advisors, let's pump a bunch of money into it, let's negotiate with centralized exchanges so that we have some good price action upon the listing. Let's make the team lock up super short so we can get some liquidity on our holdings today. It's a mirror image of what happened in 2017. No money, we're going to liquidity mine it. No listings.
01:08:22.738 - 01:08:53.494, Speaker D: It's just going to be on uniswap for whoever wants it. Lockups that last forever. Most teams are doing three or four years. Synthetics actually voluntarily locked up all of their team tokens for an additional year last month. And this is three years after the initial ICO. So really, the playbook has been flipped on its head. And I think all of this is a response to just the market shouting at people that 2017 hurt, and they don't want to see that again.
01:08:53.494 - 01:10:19.630, Speaker D: But also, it's a reaction to regulators effectively saying, if you issue this like a security, we're going to come after you. And I think in a large extent, what we're doing today is a lot healthier with liquidity mining and distribution especially the projects that really have that be kind of their first principle. Instead of doing an equity cap raise and distributing tokens to have the cap table like compound, you do something like Wifi, where it's just like the tokens are out there, go get them if you want them. I think that's like a relatively more powerful approach, I think, on the regulatory side. And I had a conversation about this with a smart investor a couple of weeks ago. His point was, there's now so much money being made in the space, and most of it's on paper, admittedly, that there's going to be some type of regulatory backlash people are starting to notice. And so whether that is hester Pierce creating a regulatory sandbox for blockchain protocols, whether that is some type of precedent coming down the pipe on a us based company about how they have done their decentralization process, there will be some type of regulatory clarity which will reorient people in terms of, okay, they said, we can't do this, so this is appropriate.
01:10:19.630 - 01:11:25.042, Speaker D: And eventually we'll get to best practices where things will get just more and more decentralized, more and more transparent until regulators are okay for that. And I think the point of regulators is to make sure that people don't get hurt. And when people get hurt is when things happen in opaque information advantage situations where things are more centralized. If you do things fully decentralized, and if you do things in a fully fair way, the role of a regulator changes from this weird pseudo babysitter that has to play whack a mole with 1000 scammy projects to someone that is auditing code and making sure that the interest rate model on compound actually works, or the interest rate model on AAVE actually works, or the synthetic staking pool is as healthy as it could be. And I don't know if you guys saw this, but a couple weeks ago the SEC put out a job request for someone who could actually read smart contract code. And I think if I think about the future of regulation, that's where I want it to head. I want them to be auditing code, I don't want them to be playing whack a mole.
01:11:25.042 - 01:11:33.260, Speaker D: I think that is a far higher leveraged job that they could be doing, and I think it benefits the consumer just an order of magnitude more.
01:11:33.630 - 01:12:20.540, Speaker B: That's a pretty interesting take about the future of regulation in DeFi that I haven't really heard before. And it's definitely an optimistic one, where regulators come in and just make sure everything is going okay, rather than trying to shut everything down. In a world where compound and ave and synthetics are like multibillion dollar platforms with tons of value, and it is actually making dents in the legacy financial system, how adversarial do you think this world is about to become when regulators find out that DeFi protocols actually they can't be swayed to the regulator's whims? Do you think we're about to enter an adversarial world, or do you think it's going to be a little bit more cooperative than that?
01:12:23.150 - 01:13:41.890, Speaker D: If you read all the regulatory precedent, whether it be on mixers or whether it be on icos from 2017, really, all of it biases. If there is this one centralized actor, if this is this one centralized controller, there's problems. If you can get to this decentralized form of governance and this decentralized form of just effectively protocol organization, I think it becomes more of an open question to regulators as to who is responsible for what is our regulatory jurisdiction, who do we need to come after? And we are all for regulation and the maturation of this industry. I think the industry has its roots in crypto anarchism, but eventually we're going to have to grow out of that, and I think that's fine. What we should be doing right now is giving regulators the tools and the context to kind of follow us on that journey so that we can make DFI a hundred billion trillion dollar asset class, something that people take seriously. And one of our investors is a very well known Wall street guy. And we walked him through, and he deposited assets on blockfi.
01:13:41.890 - 01:14:20.238, Speaker D: And we walked him through what compound was, and he was saying, what do you mean? I can get 30% yield. This seems like a scam compared to blockfi, which is just a centralized institution that I can trust. And once we walked him through, you can audit the code, you can audit the quality of the collateral. You can see in real time how the interest rate model is behaving. On the other hand, blockfi gives you literally no transparency into what they're doing or how they're doing it, and they're paying you a third of the interest rate. It was clear to him which one was the better bet for him to put capital on. And I think that regulators are largely going to see that as well.
01:14:20.238 - 01:14:37.258, Speaker D: I think on a human level, when you take things out of people's scope, they don't really take that well because you're diminishing the importance of their job. But I think it actually opens up a much more broader interpretation of what regulators can do. In a market that is completely transparent.
01:14:37.374 - 01:14:46.102, Speaker B: So throughout this conversation that we've had so far, we've been talking about the importance of community when it comes to how these DeFi protocols work.
01:14:46.156 - 01:14:46.566, Speaker D: Right?
01:14:46.668 - 01:15:39.938, Speaker B: A Defi protocol without a community is not a protocol at all. And especially with the coming world of regulation, which is coming to crypto, there's another very strong reason as to why community is so important. Because if you are creating this governance token that governs over the protocol, you need a group of people to hand off that governance token to a governance token without a community is just decentralization theater. And then we are going to have the same kind of laws and regulations upon these, quote unquote, decentralized protocols that aren't actually decentralized as they would like a centralized lending institution. I think that's where the conversation of the protocol sync thesis comes into play. Because communities gravitate towards protocols that are deep in the protocol sync thesis. Vance, are you familiar with the protocol sync thesis, by the way, before I keep on citing.
01:15:40.034 - 01:15:41.354, Speaker D: No, no. I am. Yes.
01:15:41.472 - 01:16:18.662, Speaker B: Okay, great. Now that's good to hear. First off, communities gravitate towards things that are dense in the protocol sync thesis that are at the bottom, a, because they're good investments, but b, because of their credible neutrality. Right? And so I think the protocol sync thesis is going to be this magnet for things, applications, protocols, that I hope regulators look fondly upon. Because the reason why they are down in the protocol sync is because they are credibly neutral. They are fair. They haven't scammed anyone, maybe they haven't followed regulation to a t, but they haven't harmed anybody in the process.
01:16:18.662 - 01:16:33.402, Speaker B: And so my kind of bullish thesis for defi at large is that the protocols that are dense, a cannot be touched by regulators, but b, regulators don't even want to touch them because they've dotted all their I's and crossed all their t's. Is that a fair take?
01:16:33.536 - 01:17:45.730, Speaker D: Totally. I think the superpower of Ethereum is that it's incredibly neutral, almost Switzerland esque platform for people to build on. And I think that know viewed favorably in the eyes of regulators. If you looked at the CFTC kind of comments on what its security versus commodity status was, if you look at even kind of any of the big consulting firms such as Deloitte or Ernst and Young, they look upon Ethereum as this neutral compute layer. And I think that is the main tailwind that Ethereum will benefit from. If you look at something like pick your ETH attempted murderer, it's so much harder to claim neutrality in the age of venture investment, in the age of some of the applications that are getting built on top of something like Solana getting outside share tokens, it just doesn't come off the same way. And so I really agree with you in the sense that Ethereum superpower is this sense of benevolence towards developers, incredible neutrality, and just a sense of fairness and a lack of platform risk.
01:17:45.730 - 01:18:14.700, Speaker D: But that also comes with downsides. And I think that with the e two schedule, we've seen that in a leaderless, decentralized organization, things just take a little bit more time. But computers took like 40 years to fully be realized. It's been six years since Ethereum came out. We can afford to be patient. And if it's a two year time horizon for eth two, if it's a three year time horizon for e two, I think that'll look like a speed bump in the general arc of this technology.
01:18:15.550 - 01:19:16.954, Speaker A: Yeah, I think probably both David and I totally agree with your ethereum thesis there. It should not ever sacrifice its credible neutrality for some short term velocity, as many other ethereum murderers, as you put it, are doing right now. Attempted murderers. There you go. All right, so let's move a little bit further to current state defi and talk about that for a minute. So here's something bankless listeners will be very familiar with our thoughts on DeFi tokens writ large, right? That they are essentially proto capital assets, or could become them. They are these governance tokens where the governors of the tokens, once decentralized, can actually vote in cash flows, and then these defi tokens can become capital assets with on chain value flows or cash flows, which means you can value them based on something that people are familiar with in the stock market world, which is net present value of future returns, essentially.
01:19:16.954 - 01:20:14.814, Speaker A: Right? So we learned this in business school. That's super cool. But something that I think you guys realized before, maybe a lot of people and before me, because I'm just recently observing this as well, is that there's actually even more premium in some of these defi assets than just the value flows and just the cash flows. So you tweeted this out, Vance, I caught this a few weeks ago, and we'll take SNX as an example. So that's the synthetics token that we've been talking about earlier. And you said something like valuing SNX based solely on volume and fees on the synthetics exchange is undervaluing it. What I think you were saying is that valuing SNX just based on its ability to generate cash flows, is actually undervaluing it, because there is some other hidden premium here that makes it even more valuable.
01:20:14.814 - 01:20:27.286, Speaker A: I want to talk about that. What is this additional premium that makes SNX even more valuable than just the volume and fees? We'll just take SNX as an example, because I think it's a useful one.
01:20:27.388 - 01:21:48.202, Speaker D: And just like a primer on valuation for those who aren't familiar, if you look at any protocol, whether it be uniswap or compound or synthetics, the fees that accrue to that protocol, either from the fees that are generated from trading for Uniswap or synthetics, or the spread between the borrowed lend rate on something like compound, that is the basis for what you value the protocol on. And generally, if you look at consumer Internet startups or protocols themselves, they trade on what is effectively a price to earnings ratio. And price to earnings ratios are the fundamentals of how you value things in traditional finance. And just some comps, late stage mature SaaS startups. So software as a service that are listed publicly, they trade at around ten to 20 priced earnings. Earlier stage stuff, it can range from infinity to being something more reasonable in the 300 to 400 to 500 range. If you look at all of the DFI protocols that exist today, and you try to value them, generally they trade at 100 to 200 times their fee base on a yearly basis.
01:21:48.202 - 01:22:12.466, Speaker D: So that's their price to earnings ratio. So if a protocol has a million dollars in fees, it'll probably trade at around $100 to $200 million. And this valuation band is something that hasn't moved in actually the last six months. So it's been relatively consistent as building up a valuation benchmark. In terms of my point with synthetics, there's two ways to value synthetics.
01:22:12.578 - 01:22:27.210, Speaker A: And by the way, Vance, before we get away from that valuation band, that valuation band price to earnings ratio, it's not crazy, right? Netflix is about 88 or so high. Eighty S. Amazon is in the hundreds, isn't it?
01:22:27.360 - 01:23:21.502, Speaker D: Yeah. No, it really isn't. And I think you can make the argument, not financial advice, that this stuff is potentially undervalued relative to its total addressable market. But really, what the price earnings ratio tries to express is, number one, how much is this protocol making in fees for its holder base? And number two, what is the market's expectation of growth? If you have a super high multiple, like Netflix at 88, people are still expecting Netflix to grow a huge amount. But if you have something like 100 to 200 in a very early stage consumer tech industry that's taking aim with the largest financial market in the world. That's when you start to be like, okay, maybe this is relatively undervalued. That's part of it.
01:23:21.502 - 01:24:23.502, Speaker D: The other part of this is how directly do the cash flows of that protocol or company tie directly to the stock or token that is underlying it in a stock like Netflix? Netflix does not actually pay dividends, so you're never actually going to earn any of that cash flow. It's all going to be reinvested into growth of that company. For something like synthetics, you're earning those fees directly. They pay out a dividend every single week. And so again, when you talk about that hidden premium, it's a result of a few things. It's a result of, a, the moneyness of the token and the monetary premium it accrues, b, it's a result of that token having just more direct access to cash flows and being a more efficient vehicle for value capture, and then c, it has additional premium because the governance of tokens is more direct than you would have for a stock. And so those are the three things that are generally universal.
01:24:23.502 - 01:24:49.630, Speaker D: And why tokens, when compared to equity trade at three to five x, what you would see in an equity counterpart like Ripple, I think, raised around at two or 3 billion, but the tokens are valued at around 10 billion. And so it's the market's perception. It's just the general attitude that the tokens have some type of premium versus equity.
01:24:49.810 - 01:25:40.358, Speaker A: Can we talk about a fourth too, like maybe a d here? Which is what I'm coming to maybe understand. So we were talking earlier about kind of this token mashup. David used this, I think, brilliant term. David. We want to see an article, composable communities. Right? And that was maybe best exemplified the first time I saw how powerful this was in yams, where you brought all of these tokens together and they could be jointly farmed in these yam pools, right? But the lucky, I don't know, seven or eight or so tokens that got in those pools were tokens that had really strong communities, very desirable communities. XRP was not invited, even if it was tokenized on Ethereum, right? But synthetix was.
01:25:40.358 - 01:26:26.120, Speaker A: YFI was other tokens with powerful communities. And what we saw is maybe this fourth thing, which is like a farming token premium. I don't know if that's fleeting, whether that's just like the current state of things, or whether that's more lasting. But when yams launched and started shooting up in price all of the tokens that had yam farms, essentially, where you could farm with them, they shot up too, right? Like we're talking like 50% in a day for things like comp and Ave lend and wifi. What do you think about that idea, the farming token premium idea? Is that sort of just a fleeting thing, like one time only, or is that real too?
01:26:26.570 - 01:27:26.810, Speaker D: No, that's spot on. And to the synthetics example that you threw out as a synthetics holder, I'm earning money from the fees of the protocol, but I'm minting. When I stake synthetics, I'm minting SUSD, SBTC, s eth. And the things that I can do with those synthetic assets are I can put them in curve. And just from those synthetic assets alone, I can earn 45% yield on top of what I'm earning onto the synthetics, just the exchange fees. And so the valuation point that you were making earlier is like the valuation of synthetic should be the composite of the exchange fees and the yield farming fees that you accrue from its synthetic assets. And so juxtaposing this next to your example of like Wi Fi and yams and synthetics and lend and all the tokens that seem to be the potpourri of when you're trying to bootstrap a defi community, these should be allowed to be yield farming assets.
01:27:26.810 - 01:28:42.174, Speaker D: I agree with that in some sense. But do I think that yams will be the monetary base for the new financial revolution? I may disagree with that. However, for things like SUSD and SBTC that serve as representations on chain of something that you might not otherwise have, those premiums are sustainable. People will always need a synthetic form of bitcoin on ethereum that they can trade. People will always need a synthetic form of the US dollar that is truly permissionless that they can trade on chain. And so for me, I view synthetic assets that synthetics produces likes, ETH and virtual tokens as having this shot to really corner a market on being the collateral that allows people to yield farm with. So like when you know, a USDC SBTC pool that'll allow you to earn future swap tokens or curve, you can put SBTC and SUSD into those premiums will sustain, I don't know if yams or wifi as a monetary basis, especially including the locking mechanisms that their governance has, if those will retain their premiums long term from just yield farming.
01:28:42.174 - 01:28:56.214, Speaker D: But I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. Those two assets are absolutely, at least WiFi is just a cash flow machine and its valuation will be reflective of effectively all the yields in DeFi writ large.
01:28:56.412 - 01:29:46.402, Speaker A: Okay, so you do think this yield farming mechanism will continue to command a premium. You're just skeptical on some of the maybe underlying more memetic assets, like a yam, for instance. Right, and its long term value. But I want folks to kind of connect the dots here in sort of the analog world. This would be like owning a share of Apple stock, right? Let's say I owned a share of Apple stock and I was able to deposit it into my Chuck Schwab account and then earn Tesla shares. As a result of doing that, if I deposit my Apple shares, I lock it up in this brokerage account, I can start earning Tesla shares. That's kind of what we're doing here, and we're doing it in order to distribute the tokens to communities.
01:29:46.402 - 01:30:17.010, Speaker A: So it seems to be the case that tokens with very strong communities, like a wifey or an SNX, will just be valuable because other tokens want to harness the power of those communities, and they're willing to give them their tokens in order to do that, their capital assets. It's like, I'm willing to give Apple shareholders some Tesla that I print because apple shareholders are a fantastic community that I want as part of my Tesla governance. Is that kind of what's going on here?
01:30:17.160 - 01:31:25.750, Speaker D: Yeah, the distribution of. When you try to bootstrap a protocol with an interest of, like, if you start Wifi eight, the sequel to Wifi seven, and you have Yams and Wifi and lend and SNX, you are kind of like bundling those composite communities into what you hope will be an amalgamation of yours. I go back and forth as to whether defi yield farming is a short term or long term thing. On one hand, you have compound and ave and all these guys messaging that inflation will continue for four years. I think this is basically kind of the same game played over and over and over again. At first, people are really interested in playing a game, but the more iterations it has, it becomes marginally less exciting. I think that from yield farming, where we build from here, is perpetual swaps coming on chain.
01:31:25.750 - 01:32:03.730, Speaker D: I think that'll probably be the next leg up with layer two and things like future swap or perpetual protocol, or derivatives or synthetics futures. And then from there, we're basically at feature parity with centralized exchanges. And so that's when we get into the really interesting things of being able to ship high quality synthetic assets like Tesla or oil. And really that's when the centralized exchange experience will effectively be no more superior to DFI. And I think that's when we see kind of spot and leverage volumes go from today they're about 5% of centralized volume to, I think, about 50%.
01:32:03.880 - 01:33:56.706, Speaker B: I do want to give a shout out to Dan Elitzer, because he wrote about this concept of composable assets in his very old piece, old for crypto, superfluid collateral and open finance, where he wrote an article about how you can deposit ether and die into uniswap. And then there's this token that comes out of that, which then you could use as collateral, right? And what Dan wasn't equipped with at the time was this world of defi governance tokens, which are themselves capital assets that other defi token protocols are using to tap into, to distribute their capital assets. And so right now, in this world of a capital asset pseudo equity tokens that are yielding further capital asset pseudo equity tokens, right now the yields are good, right? In urine finance, the YUSD, formerly known as the YCRV token, it's earning like 50% APR on your die or on your USDC, which is insane. And then there seems to be like every new week, a new liquidity mining yield farming tool that is tapping into all these other pseudo equity governance tokens that uses those energy in those communities to distribute their token, to make their protocol governed by the community, right? And so we have returns, we have people leveraging compound and ave to access the capital in their tokens to purchase more tokens to do more yield farming. And the borrowing of that money creates yield in these protocols, which is why people are supplying crypto dollars into these protocols to begin with. My point is that right now, the music is playing, right? And so long as you can access 50% APY on your crypto dollar inside of urine, there's going to be capital coming into the space to access that. People will say that APR, like high APR, means high risk.
01:33:56.706 - 01:34:45.714, Speaker B: And that's generally true, but also not necessarily. There could be no risk, and there could just be just returns. There's definitely risk. By the way, so long as people are able to access returns, the capital will flow, the capital will come in, and this is the way that it worked in 2017. People made money, and so more money came in, and then those people made more money, and then the music kept on playing. However, at some point, the music has to stop, because that's just how these things work. The music just doesn't continue, and at some point, the music will stop playing, and then while there will still be yields, these assets that these yields are coming from will start to depreciate in price because the selling will commence and then while the yields will still be there, the assets that everyone owns will depreciate.
01:34:45.714 - 01:35:00.620, Speaker B: And then that's when the tide will turn and we go from bear market, from bull market to bear market. That's my kind of like 1824 month time horizon for DFI. That's kind of like my game plan that I've kind of integrated in my mind.
01:35:00.930 - 01:36:10.622, Speaker D: I think in a lot of ways what's happening right now with the vegetable coins feels unsustainable. And that's because it probably is. People are just forking code that already exists, whether it be, and it's mostly the composite of the compound governance module and the SNX staking contract. And maybe you throw in a rebase in there and then it's like, okay, we're good to go, but that won't continue and that won't sustain this industry much more than a couple, two or three months. What's going to happen is that, and I think we have really good eyes on this, just because we have a lot of early stage protocols that have yet to launch. People are going to release perpetual swaps, people are going to release options, smart contract platforms, people are going to really start to take share from centralized exchanges and then after they take share from centralized exchanges, they're going to take share from centralized OTC desks and the market will continue to expand. And I think if you think about where the yield is coming from, the yield is coming from just a fundamental bullishness on the size of the opportunity today, which is relatively well defined.
01:36:10.622 - 01:36:42.790, Speaker D: It's just, okay, step one, eat all the centralized exchanges. And that in and of itself is probably 100 to 200 billion dollar aggregate market cap opportunity for D five protocols, probably more. You look at the valuation of bitmax, it's around 12 billion. You look at the valuation of FTX, it's probably three or four. You add up Coinbase, that's another probably 1512. You can get to $50 billion in aggregate market cap on an equity basis. Market opportunity.
01:36:42.790 - 01:37:15.400, Speaker D: And if you think about the premium that tokens accrue, it's probably four or five times that. So as long as the industry starts or continues to make progress towards eating these businesses in earnest, things are going to go our way. But it's not just going to be the same game of musical chairs that people keep playing. People will just get bored of that, the spaghetti coin or whatever. Michael and I got into the office one morning and we kind of looked at each other like, do we want to farm the spaghetti? Like, no, we don't want to do that. We've done that. It's cool.
01:37:15.400 - 01:38:17.958, Speaker D: We have more of an eye towards innovation and what's next. And I think the things that this next leg up of DeFi really depend on is layer two or a new blockchain like Solana, even though I'm less bullish on that. But assuming there's progress with layer two, and I think the one that we're most bullish on is optimism and ovm, we can really make this not just a flash in the pan, not just like in crypto. There's this weird conception that bull markets only last a year. And if you look at every major technological shift over the past 30 years, that's been a ten year rearchitecting of an existing industry where multiple players have had huge outcomes. And I think that's where we start to go eventually. But I think the first step there is getting to a transaction latency that can replicate the centralized exchange experience and solve a lot of the front running issues with oracles that currently exist.
01:38:18.134 - 01:38:30.446, Speaker A: Let's fast forward advance. It's been super cool. Let's fast forward. Let's say some of those oracle problems are resolved. Front running problems are solved. Let's say layer two is resolved. Ovms, optimistic roll ups, whatever.
01:38:30.446 - 01:38:40.286, Speaker A: What's next for Defi? You mentioned a few things, but what's really going to add energy for this next bull market cycle?
01:38:40.318 - 01:39:27.762, Speaker D: Do you think DeFi will eat the OTC dusks, then it will eat decentralized exchanges. It's not going to be this massive one thing that comes out of blue and just changes the industry completely. It's going to be the stuff that we've seen in the past, just composability building on itself, culture and communities building on itself. And it'll happen slowly and then it'll happen all at once. And I really think that a lot of the UX concerns about using DFI are starting to be resolved. And that combined with real layer two experiences will effectively make DFI competitive, decentralized finance in effectively always minus the KYC. And so going into q one, Q two of next year, I expect layer twos to be up and running.
01:39:27.762 - 01:39:47.590, Speaker D: And I think that's when we really start to see our next inflection point. The next three months kind of feel like everyone's still building. DyDX is moving to layer two. Synthetics is moving to layer two. Some other ones are moving to layer two. And I think that will be kind of q one. Q two will be when things really start to take off from attraction and user perspective.
01:39:47.590 - 01:40:18.340, Speaker D: But I will say the other thing is if something like serum or something like, I guess basically just serum is successful, that could really accelerate the industry and the narrative of ETH as a settlement layer in a way that would be positive as well. I don't think this is game, but I think usually the stuff that you don't think of is the stuff that ends up mattering. And we're kind of all eyes on what that might be.
01:40:18.710 - 01:40:42.634, Speaker A: So it's kind of this probability cloud of potential outcomes, and you're kind of trying to guess which one might come true now, but making bets on all of them. You mentioned a few things to get specific. You mentioned Teller. I think a fractal future swap. These are unreleased defi primitives, as I understand this. You want to tell us about one of those? Just pick one and tell us about something new.
01:40:42.832 - 01:41:18.358, Speaker D: Yeah, fractal is probably the newest one. So fractal is currently a centralized company. It's the largest market maker in DeFi. It's the largest market maker on Zero X. It's led by a really sharp guy named Carson, who's physics PhD McKinsey guy, but just absolutely hilarious and loves to mix it up into generate defi circles. And really we met them and they were like, yeah, we're trying to do this centralized market maker thing. We're trying to maybe get bought by jump or something in the next few years.
01:41:18.358 - 01:41:59.646, Speaker D: And we were like, hold on, hold on. Let's turn this into a protocol. Market making is a primitive that should exist in Defi today in the sense that it is a market neutral strategy that everyone is paying an arm and a leg for. If you're a project trying to get market made on a centralized exchange, this should be a public good for people trying to serve and get liquidity, just like uniswap is a public good for projects that want permissionless listing. And so there's so many hard problems with fractal that we're working on right now. How do you put the trading strategies, how do you put the logic on chain? What's the best way to govern this? This looks like kind of an on chain fund. How do we shift that narrative to be more of just, this is a traditional market maker.
01:41:59.646 - 01:43:00.070, Speaker D: How do we do off chain computation? How do we build exchange relationships that will allow something like a dow to trade on it? I think that's most of the new ground that we're breaking. But if you look at the citadels, if you look at the junk tradings of the world, if you look at any of these really large market makers, these are five to ten to $15 billion businesses, these are huge, and they're really the fascia of the centralized exchange and traditional finance world. And so I think building that and building that in a high quality way that can be community run is a public good, is something that we're really excited about. And the team is just like, extraordinarily talented. And, yeah, we just led their last round, and I think that it'll probably be another six or twelve months before they get out of the gate. But building those fundamental primitives into DFI is just something that people need. We hear it from our portfolio companies, and that's just generally the first sign that we look to in terms of this is really needed.
01:43:00.070 - 01:43:16.314, Speaker D: So, super excited about fractal and those guys. And I think that in a space where everybody is just kind of forking and copying each other's code, you win points for creativity and you win points for thinking a little bit further into the future. And I am really hopeful that fractal can be something special.
01:43:16.512 - 01:43:31.150, Speaker A: That does sound exciting, Vance. This podcast episode has been absolutely insane. Thank you for joining us. I want to end with this. This is always fun. You strike me as someone who likes to make predictions. We'll see if that's the case.
01:43:31.150 - 01:43:58.742, Speaker A: And at the start, you talked about leg. One of your three leg thesis at framework is, look the total market size. The tam of this entire finance industry is absolutely massive. It's measured in trillions. T with a t. Let's talk about predictions by the end of this cycle. These things always play out in cycles, whether the cycle is one year or ten years, as it could possibly be.
01:43:58.742 - 01:44:17.920, Speaker A: But at the end of this cycle, what are we going to see in terms of total value locked in Defi? What are we going to see as far as market cap of DeFi protocols, market cap of ETH, market cap of BTC? Those are the things I think I would be most interested in hearing about.
01:44:18.850 - 01:44:59.658, Speaker D: Yeah, I think in this next cycle, call it the next 24 months, we'll get to 10 billion, and then it'll look like that was forever ago. I think we'll probably eclipse probably 100 billion, maybe something like 500 billion, just in terms of total value locked in DFI, especially as things like curve and compound and ave really start to get their hooks into the traditional finance ecosystem. That combined with a ton of liquidity being pumped into the market by central banks, I think is kind of the perfect storm for just DFI writ large.
01:44:59.744 - 01:45:11.870, Speaker A: Wait, let me make sure I got that. So you're saying total locked value right now is about 6 billion, up from about 1 billion in February. And you think by the end of the cycle, 24 months, we could be as high as half a trillion?
01:45:12.290 - 01:45:47.494, Speaker D: Yeah. That's unreasonable to assume. There's this chart that we have where it's, know, DeFi today. Size of ethereum, size of bitcoin, size of traditional finance. We're not playing for DeFi just being this niche thing. We're playing for Defi integrating itself into CFI in a way that people don't fully understand could happen. And that's why when I illustrate the size of the total addressable market for finance, I'm not just illustrating the size of crypto, I'm illustrating the size of traditional trading infrastructure.
01:45:47.494 - 01:46:20.678, Speaker D: And so I think we'll get to 10 billion. We'll blow past that. We'll probably get to 100 billion. And then it really depends on where bitcoin and Ethereum go. If we get to 100 billion and then Ethereum quadruples, we're pretty much looking at a new asset class in a way that really has not been described before. My personal bias is that people have trouble thinking in terms of exponential regression. Most people think in terms of, like, linear step changes.
01:46:20.678 - 01:46:28.154, Speaker D: And so I'm hopeful that we get to 100 billion and then optimistic upside is 500.
01:46:28.272 - 01:46:32.502, Speaker A: All right, hit us with ETH market cap and bitcoin market cap 24 months into the cycle.
01:46:32.646 - 01:47:24.620, Speaker D: Oh, man. Eth market cap. That's tough. I think we'll be looking at probably, you know, 500 billion trillion dollar protocols at some point. I don't know if it's really going to be in this cycle. It could very well be, but the market opportunity for this, and it just seems od to talk about because it's like three guys on a podcast in a relatively niche industry. But this is the promise of this technology is actually becoming this neutral sediment layer that people all around the world actually use.
01:47:24.620 - 01:47:31.840, Speaker D: I wouldn't be surprised to see a couple of these protocols become a trillion dollars at some point.
01:47:33.090 - 01:47:37.470, Speaker B: So here's one for you. Ether flipping bitcoin. Is that on the table?
01:47:38.450 - 01:48:21.834, Speaker D: Personally, I've never been a gigantic fan of bitcoin. I think there's just some logical absurdities on, just like, its general sustainability. And I'm much more bullish on more expressive platforms that have Internet native culture. So I do think that will happen at some point when you have things like staking, when you have things like e two phase one coming out, it feels pretty undeniable that the potential of Ethereum will be known by the wider market. So I feel somewhat confident in saying that, yeah, ETH will flip in bitcoin at some point in this next cycle. Bullish, Vance.
01:48:21.962 - 01:48:42.466, Speaker A: Yeah, bullish, definitely, Vance. David, you and I need to get ready for some new bankless podcast visitors and listeners. If everything Vance said comes true, it's going to be a crazy 24 months. Vance, it has been an absolute pleasure. This has been a load of information. I think the bankless nation is really going to enjoy it. Thanks for joining us.
01:48:42.648 - 01:48:45.026, Speaker D: Awesome. Well, thanks so much guys. I really appreciate it.
01:48:45.128 - 01:49:16.942, Speaker A: All right, everyone, this has been episode number 28 with Vance Spencer. That is from framework Ventures and action items today. Guys, I mean, you've heard us take some time to digest all of this. That would be my first action item suggestion because there's a lot here. Maybe listen to the podcast again, maybe a third dime at half speed if you want to pick up everything. Also start to get involved in these communities. Do what Vance and framework are suggesting, except on your own, on a micro level.
01:49:16.942 - 01:50:01.194, Speaker A: Get involved in the wifey, get involved in yam governance proposals if you want, get involved in synthetics governance, just to see what these networks are all about. That is the bankless way. And that's how you start to understand what these tokens are, what the investments that you're making are by getting involved, getting active in these networks. We've also even put out an ETH validator, how to join as an ETH two validator in Testnet. That's a way you can get involved as well in Ethereum two and what's going on there, and understand the latest state of the testnet. We'll include that as a third action item and a link to that that was written in bankless just last week. Guys, as always, this is not financial advice.
01:50:01.194 - 01:50:17.726, Speaker A: Risks and disclaimers. ETH is risky, so is crypto. So are the assets we talked about today. If you choose to use some of these protocols, remember, you could lose what you put in. There can be hacks, there can be bugs, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone.
01:50:17.726 - 01:50:20.940, Speaker A: But we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
