00:00:00.170 - 00:00:26.994, Speaker A: The 10th amendment is the one that says, the powers not reserved to the federal government shall be reserved, respectively, to the states and to the people. The vision of the Constitution was one of decentralization, the idea that different states could compete. The states weren't supposed to be particularly similar to one another. It allowed people the different choice of which rails they wanted to ride. Do you want to ride the rails of Connecticut or the rails of North Carolina? They're bound by a common set of ideals. But it's up to the people to choose in a decentralized manner. That was the vision of the founding fathers.
00:00:26.994 - 00:00:36.310, Speaker A: Decentralization. It's baked into the constitution. The 10th and final of the amendments in that original Bill of rights enshrined that principle of decentralization into the very DNA of this country.
00:00:36.380 - 00:00:37.286, Speaker B: And I think that's part of the.
00:00:37.308 - 00:00:39.940, Speaker A: DNA that we need to revive in this country as well.
