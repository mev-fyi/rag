00:00:01.770 - 00:00:27.638, Speaker A: Hello everyone. Welcome to State of the Nation, episode nine. David and I are super excited about the state of the nation today. We're going to talk about what's happening like we usually do. Relate it to big picture stuff, drop some insights and action items. And right after we talk about our sponsor is going to mention a few other updates today as well as the schedule. But David, why don't we start with our sponsors? You want to kick it off?
00:00:27.724 - 00:00:57.598, Speaker B: Yeah. So I was playing with one of our sponsors games last Friday and a little bit this weekend. Gods unchained. For those of you that played magic, the gathering. For those of you that played Hearthstone yugioh, this is a game just like that, but instead the cards that you own in the game are ERC 721 tokens on Ethereum. So the big problem with magic the gathering was that it was physical. So you had to be across from a person with other physical cards to play them.
00:00:57.598 - 00:01:37.590, Speaker B: So that kind of sucked. And then there's Hearthstone that came around so you could play over the computer, but then you never owned your actual cards because Blizzard just owned them on a centralized database. What godzone chain does is they have the best of both worlds, right, where you own your cards because they're digital assets on Ethereum, but you can play on the online medium that the world is now turning to. So it's a really fantastic game and it's a really fantastic dev team that is kind of leading the charge when it comes to ERC 721 standards and also gas on Ethereum. Check them out@godsunchained.com. Download the game. You can start without having to buy any tokens and without having to buy any cards.
00:01:37.590 - 00:01:47.950, Speaker B: They give you the basic starter pack that you need to get started. It's a really elegant UI, really elegant whole experience, and it's just a ton of fun. I played it all weekend.
00:01:48.290 - 00:02:07.378, Speaker A: Absolutely. All right, so the second sponsor we want to tell you about is Ave. Ave is a long time favorite of the bankless community. So it is a lending and borrowing protocol at its core. So it's all DFI, it's all bankless. What you can do is deposit an asset into Ave. You do that by going to ave.com.
00:02:07.378 - 00:02:39.386, Speaker A: So an asset could be any ERC 20 token, like a die, for instance, or an ETH. And what it will do is it will provide you a yield on top of that. So you're effectively lending your assets to the protocol. That's one side of the market. The other side of the market is where you actually borrow against the protocol. And the unique thing about Ave is they don't just offer variable rate loans, they offer fixed rate loans. So with most DeFi protocol lendings, what happens is the interest rate could change on a day to day basis.
00:02:39.386 - 00:03:19.946, Speaker A: With Aave, you can sort of lock in that interest if you're borrowing something from the account. So they are just crushing it in terms of popping up the DeFi leaderboard in terms of total value locked. So there's a lot more going on inside of that protocol. Also, they released avonomics, which is super exciting. That is some token economics to their protocol. One of the big things, there's lots to highlight about it, but one of the big things is they're actually going to be putting a percentage of tokens of reserve assets into sort of an insurance type of protocol. So if something happens to Ave in the future, that can be paid out.
00:03:19.946 - 00:03:41.698, Speaker A: So that's going to be included in avonomics. We will include some links where you can check out avonomics and you can check out Ave. But if you're looking to get started and just try a small amount today, you can do that@ave.com. Aave.com check the show notes David what are we doing? You know, I didn't ask you how you're doing, but how are you doing?
00:03:41.864 - 00:04:25.902, Speaker B: I'm doing fantastic. We released a just killer episode with Andre Cronier, who was the creator of the yearn and the Yiffy protocol token that just went out on the podcast stream on Monday. If you haven't listened to that, give that a listen. There was some fud going around from this decrypt article about how Andre is close to quitting. And then Andre also came out on Twitter saying that that article was not accurate. And so I feel like people really turned to listen to this episode to really get a glimpse as to what the hell that decrypt Fud article was even talking about, because it wasn't entirely wrong. Andre did say that he was fed up and really tired with what he's been building, but he did not at all allude to how he is bailing or quitting.
00:04:25.902 - 00:04:28.526, Speaker B: So for more details, listen to the podcast.
00:04:28.638 - 00:04:32.722, Speaker A: Absolutely. It's a fantastic podcast. One of our most downloaded, actually, already.
00:04:32.856 - 00:04:33.394, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:33.512 - 00:05:02.254, Speaker A: So it's just crushing it and super interesting. It was called dense, I think, on Twitter. So take a look at it, maybe listen to it a couple of times if you need to. The other thing is, bankless nation is growing like crazy. So we hit a really cool milestone yesterday, which is 10,000 subscribers to the newsletter where it all started. So we just want to thank everyone for hanging with us and being a part of this community. It's just been really rewarding to see.
00:05:02.254 - 00:05:07.102, Speaker A: And bankless is not even a year old, and we are population ten k right now.
00:05:07.156 - 00:05:09.470, Speaker B: Ten k, yeah. It's a big city.
00:05:09.620 - 00:05:16.782, Speaker A: Absolutely. So we're growing. We want to grow this into a metropolis and then eventually a full size bankless nation.
00:05:16.846 - 00:05:17.460, Speaker B: Right.
00:05:18.390 - 00:05:25.186, Speaker A: David, we should talk about the ethscape shirts as well. So what's the latest on those? We introduced those last state of the.
00:05:25.368 - 00:06:13.426, Speaker B: Yeah, so the ethscape shirt, it's the rare apparel platform that we're kind of building out, and it's the first one, season zero, we're calling it. This is going to be a regular rolling out seasons of new awesome scarce merch. And what we did was we made 50 shirts, and we also made 50 tokens. And if you want the shirt, you buy the token from Uniswap and you burn it, and then you get the shirt sent to you. And so somebody's already redeemed one, so their shirt is in the mail on the way. Looking forward to hopefully seeing a tweet come out on Twitter from some guy wearing the ethscape shirt. And so we had this set up into two phases, right? So we had this initial phase where the buying demand on Uniswap would suck up some of the tokens, and then we would start to release the tokens as well.
00:06:13.426 - 00:06:59.458, Speaker B: So what we did is we supplied all tokens to Uniswap, every single one eth per token, and then the purchasing power would increase the price of the token. And then the plan was to withdraw liquidity and sell as the price went up to keep that price dampened and shallow until we ran out of tokens. And so the first phase of that happened. And then we realized that with Uniswap as a distribution method, it kind of runs up against a wall in that second phase. Right. And so the price got too high, and we couldn't sell them because people weren't pushing that there wasn't enough supply and the demand wouldn't reach that certain threshold. And so there wasn't really a good way to offload these.
00:06:59.458 - 00:07:47.298, Speaker B: And so we're working with a balancer team to try out this new mechanism that they've always discussed and always kind of promoted as a potential use case of a balancer pool. And it's basically a dutch auction. And so what we're going to do is, as we build out the system with balancer we're not ready to do that yet. We're just kind of talking about our plans. What we're going to do is we're going to withdraw the remaining liquidity from Uniswap and then put it all into a balancer pool. And so there's going to be like, the remaining tokens that we have, it's going to be like 40, 38 tokens, something in that ballpark, and we're going to supply them, all of them, into balancer with a very low supply of either dai or ether or something. And then these supplies cross over time, and the price of the tokens will tick downwards at a rate over time and time and time.
00:07:47.298 - 00:08:34.622, Speaker B: And so when prices will go down, and then there will be only so many shirts, only so many tokens that you can purchase. And as you purchase them, the supply runs out as the price lowers, and so the price will get closer to zero over time. But before it gets to zero, it's likely that all the shirts will have been purchased because people will buy them for more than $0. And so at some point between where we initially set the parameters at, we're going to set it really high, something like $3,000 a shirt, and then it's going to trend towards $0 a shirt over time. And somewhere between those two ends, all the shirts will be bought. And it kind of does work like Uniswap. Like when you purchase a shirt, the price goes up, but the price will go up and then continue to tick back down over time until either all tokens are sold or the price is zero.
00:08:34.622 - 00:09:02.074, Speaker B: And so this is just a much better way to distribute these things. Uniswap isn't really a distribution mechanism. This dutch auction from the balancer system, I think, is going to distribute these things because we don't want these tokens. We want you guys to have these tokens. And so this is a way for us to get the tokens out into the ecosystem so that people can actually redeem these shirts. I don't want to just sit on a box of really awesome shirts for months on end. So that's the update with that?
00:09:02.192 - 00:09:25.922, Speaker A: Absolutely. That's going to be super cool. The summary is basically phase one was successful. The market found a price for these shirts on Uniswap. It's still active. Now, phase two, we've sort of changed plans to move phase two to a dutch auction type model where all of the liquidity is essentially off of our books and into the market. I think that'll be great.
00:09:25.922 - 00:09:33.970, Speaker A: Very exciting. We don't have an ETA on that, though, but stay tuned here for that and you'll be first to know.
00:09:34.040 - 00:09:40.518, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a reason why we labeled this season zero, not season one. We're still trying this thing out.
00:09:40.684 - 00:09:55.562, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And the market is definitely having fun with figuring out what the price of these eatscape shirts are. I mean, they've moved quite high and now they're sort of back to mid to your last I looked, it was like $700 or something for it got.
00:09:55.616 - 00:09:58.860, Speaker B: All the way up to $1,800. And then people started to.
00:09:59.710 - 00:10:21.842, Speaker A: Yeah, that is a lot. I love the shirts. I'm not sure I'd do one 8000 hundred dollars for one shirt. Of course. All right, so what else are we doing? So this state of the nation is going to be a little bit different this week. So we're actually going to release this in two episodes. There's going to be a part one, which you are listening to right now, and we've recorded a little bit.
00:10:21.842 - 00:10:52.394, Speaker A: First we're going to stitch these videos together, and then there's going to be a part two. The part two is actually going to be on Eth supply with Vitalik. We think that that deserves its own dedicated episode. And we wanted to get this episode out to you today because we've got some super interesting, time sensitive topics. One in particular that we're talking about a little something called Yam, which has kind of hit the bankless community. So that's what we're going to start with today, and that's how it's going to be divided. So expect two state of the nation episodes this week.
00:10:52.394 - 00:11:05.290, Speaker A: It's a bonus week. This is just part one. Stay tuned for part two. I don't know, Wednesday, Thursday. Sometime this week we will release part two with Vitalik, where we are actually talking about the Eth supply gate, as you call it. Right, David?
00:11:05.370 - 00:11:10.290, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what bitcoiners call it. That's what's going around in their circles.
00:11:11.030 - 00:11:21.526, Speaker A: Well, let me ask the question. I guess we're going to do this question twice. I'm not sure. Maybe there's just one state of the nation, but David, what is the state of the nation? This. What's the, what are we using?
00:11:21.628 - 00:11:32.950, Speaker B: The state of the nation is propagating. It's such a perfect word. So bankless just hit ten k. Bankless nation. Ten k large. Fantastic. There's people flooding into the discord.
00:11:32.950 - 00:11:58.130, Speaker B: If you guys aren't in the discord, join it. It's where a lot of the awesome conversation happens. Meanwhile, in DFI, there's this new thing called Yam, which is the yam farming revolution. It's a new cycle of the season. So that has now propagated the defi ecosystem. The first users of Uniswap, that number has gone through the roof. So Uniswap users are propagating.
00:11:58.130 - 00:12:04.414, Speaker B: The text about defi continue to flow in. Everything is propagating. Everything is propagating.
00:12:04.542 - 00:12:24.346, Speaker A: Yep. And we are recording this intro, actually post yam launch. And we recorded the yam section of this pre yam launch. So it's just like an hour, an hour and a half before the launch of yam. It has launched and you can find out more about it in real time. All right, David, we should get right to it then, sir.
00:12:24.448 - 00:12:31.406, Speaker B: Right. First, before we talk about yams, we got to get into our second round of the sponsors and then it will be clear skies after that.
00:12:31.508 - 00:12:55.278, Speaker A: Awesome. All right, David, let's take a minute to talk about two more of our fantastic sponsors. The first is Polymarket. Polymarket is a prediction market with a very simple and understandable user experience. You can use it to express an opinion as to the likelihood of future events. We've written a tactic about this. We will include it in the show notes.
00:12:55.278 - 00:13:34.510, Speaker A: It is fantastic to use. You can bet on future events using ETH, you can bet on it using dai. It's very much like a wisdom of the crowd sort of phenomenon. So you can go there not to gamble, but also to gain a glimpse into what the market's actually predicting about things. Things like the total locked value in defi, things like coronavirus metrics, things like the US government and election outcomes, all sorts of things. Go to poly market and check out the markets that are available. You could tweet about it and tag poly market when you do.
00:13:34.510 - 00:14:03.050, Speaker A: And if you do that, you can email hello at Poly market with bankless as the subject line, and they will cover all of your gas fees. So make sure if you're using Polymarket, email hello at Poly market with bankless in the subject line, they will cover your gas fees, which are not insubstantial at this point in time. So check it out, check the show notes out and get into the prediction market landscape.
00:14:03.950 - 00:14:42.838, Speaker B: All right, our second sponsor is Ampleforth. Ampleforth is a pretty interesting experiment going on in Ethereum right now. Ampleforth is a base money asset, right? So it's trying to be an m zero, and it has this clever little mechanism built into it, so it tracks $2,019. But it's not a stable coin. And so it has this very interesting mechanism where as the price of ampleforth goes up and down, it will rebase. And so if the price is above a dollar, it will rebase by minting everyone new amples to bring that price down. And if it's below a dollar, it will do the opposite, and it'll burn amples from peOple's wallets to bring that price back up.
00:14:42.924 - 00:14:43.174, Speaker A: Right.
00:14:43.212 - 00:15:15.646, Speaker B: And so it has similar values to bitcoin in that it's nondilutive. And so if you own 1% of ampleforth tokens, you will always own 1% of all ampleforth tokens, no matter how many there are, no matter what the rebases do. And it's meant to be a non correlative asset to crypto. Right. It's supposed to be collateral for DFI that doesn't act like the rest of the collateral for defi. So you can check them out@ampleforth.org. You can take part in the ampleforth liquidity mining by going to geyser ampleforth.org
00:15:15.646 - 00:15:35.990, Speaker B: and submitting Ample and ETH to the Uniswap pool to get a little bit of extra rewards. Speaking of Ampleforth and this crazy rebase mechanism that drives this thing, we are going to talk about something brand new to the crypto space as of today, and I'm going to share my screen here, and it's called yams.
00:15:37.370 - 00:15:41.438, Speaker A: Yams. So like yams as in the vegetable? Yams.
00:15:41.474 - 00:15:43.126, Speaker B: Yams as in the vegetable, apparently.
00:15:43.158 - 00:15:46.746, Speaker A: Okay. And apparently there's an emoji for yams. I didn't realize that.
00:15:46.768 - 00:15:47.194, Speaker B: I did not Know.
00:15:47.232 - 00:15:52.598, Speaker A: I knew there was a zucchini. Yeah, but we have an emoji for yams.
00:15:52.694 - 00:16:13.854, Speaker B: Yeah. So yam is this ThinG, it got released today. Actually, this post went out 10:00 a.m. August 11, which for me, that was an hour and 10 minutes ago. And so some people have been teasing this a LitTle bit earlier, which is why we know to cover it. But I've just been reading it and I want to share it now. I'm calling it YampLE because it's very much ample.
00:16:13.854 - 00:16:27.906, Speaker B: Fourth. But it's an experiment in fair farming governance and elasticity. And so take ample and take the y fee, the yifi, the yearn distribution mechanism, and combine them together, and that's more or less what you get with yam.
00:16:28.018 - 00:16:52.830, Speaker A: All right, hold on for a second. So you said take ample. I hope people were paying attention when you were talking about ampleforth as kind of a sponsor for bankless, and you had this great meet the nation where you actually interviewed one of the co founders of Ample and went in depth on what ample is. But should we maybe start, David, with a recap of what ample actually is? Yeah, in case people missed what you just said in the sponsorship.
00:16:54.870 - 00:17:45.410, Speaker B: So Ampleforth goes up and down in price, as all tokens do, right? Because when there is a specific number of units out there for a given period, that unit doesn't go. There isn't any more or less of that unit for that one time period. So like bitcoin, or like other assets, the price fluctuates. The only thing that Ampleforth does differently is that it tracks using an oracle, it tracks the price of the ampleforth token on secondary markets like Uniswap, and then it rebases, which means it adds more to the supply or removes from the supply an appropriate amount to keep that price roughly targeting dollars. So it's not a stable coin, it's just as volatile as bitcoin. But the unit of account tracks a dollar over time. And so the yam token does that too.
00:17:45.410 - 00:17:50.466, Speaker B: But it also does some other things as, and so real quick, though, why.
00:17:50.488 - 00:18:23.002, Speaker A: Is that useful, David? So obviously it's really exciting when we have tokens that are scarce supply, because it creates sort of a scarcity game. I'd almost call this, people hate the word ponzi, right? But there's Ponzi schemes that are ripping you off, and then there's transparent ponzies, which are like games. And I would say bitcoin is like a transparent Ponzi game. Everyone's bitcoiners in their hearts would admit this too. Everyone is trying to collect their portion of the 21 million bitcoins. That's the game, right? So this is like a game. It's a scarcity game.
00:18:23.002 - 00:18:40.450, Speaker A: But the difference, one difference at least it doesn't have bitcoin's longevity, doesn't have all sorts of things, doesn't have its own blockchain. It's all based on Ethereum. But one of the key differences as well is it's trying to rebase itself as close as possible to a dollar every day. Why is that even useful?
00:18:41.430 - 00:18:56.022, Speaker B: Yeah. So the jury is kind of actually still out on why this is useful. My answer for this is that it acts as trustless collateral for DeFi that you are going to be comfortable paying back in the future no matter what.
00:18:56.076 - 00:18:56.294, Speaker A: Right?
00:18:56.332 - 00:19:29.838, Speaker B: So the market cap of Ampleforth could go from something really small to really big. But if you owe ten ampleforth tokens. Ten amples. You're only going to be paying back $10 plus or minus a couple of percentage fluctuation. It doesn't matter what the market cap of the network did, you always will pay back roughly the same purchasing power in order to pay back your debts. And so it's a trustless way to denominate debts over the long term. And so this really differentiates itself from Dai, or a stablecoin, especially USDC, because it's relatively trusted.
00:19:29.838 - 00:19:46.694, Speaker B: And then Dai, as people criticize Dai more and more and more for onboarding centralized assets, Ampleforth gets more and more relevant because Dai isn't an m zero, Dai is an m one, which means it's created by collateral. Ampleforth is itself collateral. That's the main.
00:19:46.732 - 00:20:17.026, Speaker A: Yeah, right, exactly. And some people would say it's not a good m zero at all. And I would totally agree. What makes an m zero good is basically liquidity. The most saleable asset is what makes an m zero good. But there is something to what you said, I think, again, this is totally an experiment, but when people define, even economists define what money is, they usually look at three attributes, but there's actually four attributes. So they always talk about store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account.
00:20:17.026 - 00:20:42.694, Speaker A: But other economists add a fourth, and that's unit of deferred settlement. Unit of deferred settlement. So that's like unit of account, but unit of account specific to loans. Right. And the reason the US dollar reigns supreme, basically as the world's reserve currency, is because most debt, most loans are denominated in us dollars. So this fourth attribute, unit of deferred settlement, is actually pretty important. That's the experiment.
00:20:42.694 - 00:21:13.202, Speaker A: It seems like Ampleforth is iterating on. But a lot of people, David, don't like Ampleforth. And I think when you boil it all down, it kind of is because of one thing. It's not that they don't appreciate, understand the mechanism of it. I think at least the smart folks that I've talked to, it's that they don't like the initial distribution of Ampleforth. A large portion of amps were distributed to investors to kind of fund the team, fund the original idea. Right.
00:21:13.202 - 00:21:29.190, Speaker A: And that's the aspect that folks don't like. It's not as organic vcs are actually involved. The team has bags, quote unquote. And a lot of people, when you boil it all down, seem to be up in arms about that specific aspect of it. Would you agree?
00:21:29.340 - 00:22:02.274, Speaker B: Yeah. They're distrustful of people whose incentive is to shield their bag. And Ampleforth is kind of caught in this rock, in the hard place where the project is about the token, where things like Ave or compound or maker, they're not centered around the token, they're centered around a product or service, whereas amplifier is centered around this token, which kind of puts the team in this hard, difficult spot of like, yeah, we're trying to grow our product and service, and our product and service is this. That's so, I know I derailed you.
00:22:02.312 - 00:22:06.498, Speaker A: David, but I wanted to get that out there. So tell us what yams are.
00:22:06.664 - 00:22:11.766, Speaker B: It's good. So yams are something similar and also something completely different.
00:22:11.868 - 00:22:12.134, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:12.172 - 00:22:47.390, Speaker B: So you can kind of think this as a competitor to Ampleforth, but you would also be missing a very large component of what makes yams work. And also, ample force strictly has in its values that it's a trustless, governance minimized system. And yams are not that, they are welcoming governance. And that's a very key differentiator, because trustless m zeros need to be without governance. And this has a governance function and something else as well that Ampleport doesn't have.
00:22:47.460 - 00:23:01.958, Speaker A: But first of all, the thing they did first is, as I understand it, and again, we're just kind of learning about this now because it's totally fresh. The first thing they did was they forked Ampleforth. So this is a fork of ampleforth, is it not?
00:23:02.124 - 00:23:24.878, Speaker B: Maybe fork is the wrong forking means that you're taking that code and then you're changing it, and then you're redeploying it. What they're really doing is they're taking the code of Ampleforth, and they're taking the code of compounds governance mechanism, and they're taking, not the code, but like the pattern of Yfi Yifi distribution. And they're combining that all into one thing.
00:23:24.964 - 00:23:25.550, Speaker A: Right.
00:23:25.700 - 00:23:30.446, Speaker B: And so it's taking a bunch of different features and combining it into this one project.
00:23:30.548 - 00:23:39.794, Speaker A: So they're not forking the code per se, they're more like forking the meme. Right. They're more forking the issuance policy and the entire idea here.
00:23:39.832 - 00:24:15.450, Speaker B: Right, right. Yes, we're forking ideas more than we are code. The ampleforth code might be an actual fork, but again, if you compare this to Ampleforth, you're missing out on what this really is. Okay, so the yam token, very much like Ampleforth, tracks a dollar, right? So that's the, that's very much the same. There's a governable treasury for promoting the yam system, right. And that's very different. There's a treasury of funds that aren't denominated in yams, that is governed by the yam token holders.
00:24:15.450 - 00:25:30.550, Speaker B: Very much like Yfi, very much like Yifi. And then also there's this distribution mechanism that incentivizes community members to take control over yams and have this fair launch. Right, okay, the key difference here is that I'm going to scroll down real quick. The key difference here is that when a rebase happens for yam, just like a rebase happens in Ampleforth, tokens are minted and added to the total supply that's shared throughout everyone, right? So if you own 1000 yams and then the rebase mechanism mints 10% more, you will have 1100 yams. The only difference is that when a rebase happens, 10% of the newly issued yams goes to purchasing the Y curve token. And the Y curve token, for those that don't know, is like a very high yielding stablecoin asset, right? So the Y curve is the Y dai, Y tether, YUSDC, YBUsD, all the Y stablecoins which are stablecoins submitted to liquidity in the curve protocol. When you combine all those together, they create the Y curve token.
00:25:31.290 - 00:25:54.510, Speaker A: Y curve is like a super stable, it's like a meta stablecoin, right? Y curve meta meta stablecoin, meta meta. Okay, so y curve, the token itself is like a stable coin. That portion is dai, a portion is BUSD, a portion is USDC, all the other popular stablecoins on Ethereum. And does y curve as well entitle you to curve's transaction?
00:25:55.890 - 00:26:15.006, Speaker B: So Ydai receives. This is really stretching my capacity of understanding these systems. YDAi receives yield from people using curve and dai, right? And so does y tether, so does YuSDC. And then when you combine all those together, you get YCRV.
00:26:15.118 - 00:26:28.040, Speaker A: Right, but it's going to track the dollar. It's just like a dollar super meta stablecoin that's kind of almost diversified its risk across multiple stablecoins, but also adds the risk of curve, right, exactly.
00:26:28.490 - 00:27:00.878, Speaker B: And then there's also yield, right? So when 10% of the rebase for yams happens, 10% goes to purchasing y curve and adds that to the treasury. So what's happening is a little bit of money printer. Money printer is going on where they're printing money to purchase other money to add it to the treasury, which the yam token governs over. Right? Okay, so that's kind of the big value prop of yam is that over time the treasury of yam gets larger.
00:27:00.974 - 00:27:35.774, Speaker A: Because of the rebase and the rebase. Right. So this is how ampleforth basically works. A similar way is there's a rebase. So what will happen is when lots of people are bullish on amples, just in general, for whatever reason, then amples float above a dollar, so they'll start trading at $2, or they'll start trading at $3. I've even seen it close to $4 trading. And then what happens is more supply is printed essentially during that rebase in an attempt, algorithmically, to drop the price of amples closer to one dollars.
00:27:35.774 - 00:27:54.942, Speaker A: So that's how it's pegging. This works the same way, except that a portion of that rebase, on the upside, so say yams were trading at $3, for instance, 10% of the rebase amount would be taken and parked into a governance fund. A treasury of some sort.
00:27:55.096 - 00:27:56.278, Speaker B: Protocol treasury. Yeah.
00:27:56.364 - 00:28:06.838, Speaker A: And that treasury would essentially be sort of almost like the base utility value that's backing all of the yams in existence. Is that right?
00:28:06.924 - 00:28:38.562, Speaker B: Right. So it kind of turns the Y curve as like the deposits of the system, and then the yam as the credit of the system, and you can buy the yams on the secondary market as credits to access the deposits of the Y curve. Right. And so now we have to get into the distribution. Right. So there's eight different pools of yams that will send out yam tokens to those that supply the tokens to them. And so we can go to the yam website.
00:28:38.562 - 00:29:07.398, Speaker B: Right. And so this is what you'll see when you go to the Yam website, depending on what tribe you consider yourself. If you're like a link marine, if you're a spartan, if you're a maker, whatever. I like how they turned. Every single one of these is an emoji of sorts. So you can take your asset of choice and deposit it, and that deposits it into the quote unquote farm for that particular yam. And this is just a distribution mechanism.
00:29:07.398 - 00:29:25.234, Speaker B: Your assets aren't doing anything in here, they're just being there. No one's on the other side of this. This is just proof of locked up capital so that you can receive the yam token. Right. It's not at risk except for the fact that it's out of your wallet. It's not at risk because it's not being borrowed against. Nothing's happening.
00:29:25.234 - 00:29:26.946, Speaker B: You're just locking up capital. Right.
00:29:27.048 - 00:29:37.058, Speaker A: And to be clear, David, none of the yam initial supply was awarded to a team pre mined. Venture capital funded none of it. Right.
00:29:37.144 - 00:30:11.614, Speaker B: Well, yeah, let's go to the ether scan page and we can see where all the yam tokens are. Right. With the holders, there are eight addresses, each holding a quarter million yam tokens. And then there's 1234-5678 pools for depositing assets to get the yam token. So we can assume that these eight pools, each with a little bit over 7% of the supply, correlates to one of these pools that we see on the Yam website. By the way, this goes live in 30 minutes from this time of recording. So by the time the viewers are watching this, this is already live, just.
00:30:11.652 - 00:30:17.378, Speaker A: Live for the first day, right? Yeah, but this has 3.5 million. And I thought there was 5 million.
00:30:17.464 - 00:30:40.700, Speaker B: Yeah. So on the medium page, which is like the announcement, it says there's 2 million distributed 250,000 yamper pool over seven days, launching in 30 minutes. But there is a total supply of 5 million. Yeah, I don't know where that comes. I don't know where those are.
00:30:41.790 - 00:30:43.558, Speaker A: Well, is that a pre mine?
00:30:43.654 - 00:30:44.154, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:30:44.192 - 00:30:45.386, Speaker A: Anybody getting the 2 million?
00:30:45.488 - 00:30:51.390, Speaker B: I don't know, but they actually don't. According to ether scan, they don't exist.
00:30:52.450 - 00:30:56.766, Speaker A: So are they deciding to award those later? That's interesting.
00:30:56.948 - 00:31:27.590, Speaker B: So here's one thing that is happening in another pool. I think somebody has. There must be a multi sig that controls the yam printing, minting. But it sounds like after this phase is done, there's going to be a second phase where 3 million more yam get distributed through the Yam y curve. Uniswap v two liquidity. Right. So yam is supposed to track a dollar, and so it's going to be paired against y curve to give yam the liquidity.
00:31:27.590 - 00:31:30.038, Speaker B: This is like the Ampleforth geyser program.
00:31:30.124 - 00:31:31.370, Speaker A: Yeah, I got it.
00:31:31.440 - 00:31:37.254, Speaker B: Yeah. So there's going to be liquidity incentives for depositing y curve and yam tokens into uniswap.
00:31:37.302 - 00:32:00.590, Speaker A: So it feels like phase one is they're trying to seed some distribution almost in a Wi Fi type way. People are familiar with, like, go listen to our Andre podcast. Came out this, like, get familiar with that. And then. So they're distributing not to vcs and kind of investors and that sort of thing. They're distributed to liquidity providers. And then phase two is they're trying to incentivize liquidity.
00:32:00.590 - 00:32:16.002, Speaker A: And by the way, incentivizing liquidity has been incredibly. It's worked really well for Ampleforth. Like, they were number two, something like that. Number one by a long shot. On uniswap.
00:32:16.066 - 00:32:17.062, Speaker B: On Uniswap. Right.
00:32:17.116 - 00:32:33.598, Speaker A: Okay. Liquidity incentivization does work and has seemed to work with Uniswap. So this is like the playbook almost, but with a different distribution. We need to find out where that other, like the 3.5 million, right? We've got 3.5 million tokens. This is 5 million.
00:32:33.598 - 00:32:36.080, Speaker A: I'm wondering about. Where's that other 1.5?
00:32:36.450 - 00:32:52.980, Speaker B: Yeah. Wait, so 2 million into the pools, 250,000 yamp per pool. And so here they are. But, yeah, so this is weird. So when you add up eight times 250, you get to.
00:32:53.510 - 00:32:54.082, Speaker A: Oh, man.
00:32:54.136 - 00:33:10.714, Speaker B: Quick math, you get to 2 million, but there's 350,000,000 yams here. So there's some unaccounted for that hasn't popped up on ether scan yet. And that's just a mechanism of a specific contract in ERC, 20 tokens that sometimes people don't include for whatever reason.
00:33:10.912 - 00:33:14.650, Speaker A: Are we sure they're not doing anything else? They're not printing some for their.
00:33:14.720 - 00:33:27.334, Speaker B: I don't is. According to this post, they're very specifically trying to make a non vc printed token. Right.
00:33:27.472 - 00:33:34.458, Speaker A: What are they saying? Do they say explicitly anywhere that the yam team doesn't get anything and no one gets anything aside from these liquidity?
00:33:34.554 - 00:33:41.090, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think there is a yam team. Right. There's just the people that made this thing and I don't think they would call themselves the team.
00:33:41.160 - 00:33:41.346, Speaker A: Right.
00:33:41.368 - 00:33:50.774, Speaker B: And so a fair distribution mechanism that incentivizes key community members to actively take the reins of governance, I guess that doesn't, no one is saying in this.
00:33:50.812 - 00:34:01.578, Speaker A: Post explicitly that aside from these liquidity mechanisms, no one else is getting. It does say that right here. All right, well, the post says it.
00:34:01.744 - 00:34:14.874, Speaker B: Yam is being distributed in the spirit of Wi Fi. No pre mine, no founder shares, no VC interest. Simple equal opportunity staking distribution to attract a broad and vision aligned community to steward the future of the protocol and token.
00:34:14.922 - 00:34:18.938, Speaker A: All right, so I'm assuming that's true. And assuming that is true, I don't.
00:34:18.954 - 00:34:23.710, Speaker B: Know Brock Trent or Clinton, but I do know Dan and I do know will. And I like those guys.
00:34:23.780 - 00:35:00.726, Speaker A: So I'll leave it at that. So if we were to kind of summarize the difference here, the difference, it seems to me, make sure I capture this. Between Ampleforth and Yams are obviously length of time, but one is, Yams has a reserve they set aside. Ampleforth has no reserve so basically, there's no underlying value besides the value of Ampleforth's. Ampleforth amps are the reserve. Right. And so this has 10% or so it's going to set aside in some sort of a treasury.
00:35:00.726 - 00:35:27.106, Speaker A: And you would assume that the market would value, the price of yams would not drop below the value of that treasury. You might make that assumption because it's a treasury that backs the value of yams. Right. That's one difference. There's some base backing reserve, almost like central banks have a reserve of other assets, like gold nut sort of thing. And the second difference is governance. Right?
00:35:27.288 - 00:35:28.310, Speaker B: Huge difference.
00:35:28.460 - 00:35:44.810, Speaker A: That's a huge difference. Okay, so governance is yam token holders. They get to vote on what can be done with that treasury, and they vote on other aspects of governing the protocol in a similar way of wifi, whereas Ampleforth is a bit more governance minimizing, wouldn't you say?
00:35:44.960 - 00:36:10.690, Speaker B: Right. And I don't even think that it's right to compare these things, because they're achieving totally separate goals. They have similar mechanisms, but they have totally different success scenarios. Right. And so Yam is really a hybrid platypus between Yifi and yearn and Ampliforth. Right. But they're not competitors.
00:36:10.690 - 00:36:15.682, Speaker B: I would maybe even say that Yam and Yiffy are more competitors than yam. And.
00:36:15.736 - 00:36:28.538, Speaker A: Wait, you think so? It seems to me what Yam is trying to do is compete as a base money zero and m zero, just like Ampleforth. Whereas Yifi is a capital asset. Right. Very clearly. Yes.
00:36:28.624 - 00:36:32.314, Speaker B: Yes. I think that is because the value.
00:36:32.352 - 00:36:34.860, Speaker A: Of VM, there's no fees associated with it.
00:36:36.510 - 00:36:37.580, Speaker B: What do you mean?
00:36:37.950 - 00:37:01.694, Speaker A: Oh, did you hear me? What? Think that. I think we got, like, a little disconnected there for a second. So I think that it seems to me that ample is competing in the same way that yams are, as an m zero, because there's no underlying transaction fees. Like with yiffy Wifi, there's wifey. We keep saying, yiffy, wifey.
00:37:01.742 - 00:37:02.658, Speaker B: That's my bad.
00:37:02.824 - 00:37:22.474, Speaker A: So with wifey, there is, like, the transaction fees from the protocol. Ultimately, it's kind of a cash flow. This has no cash flows aside from the reserve. It's set aside as that 10% reserve, but everything above that 10% reserve of the value of Y curve tokens, that's all like monetary premium territory, right? Wouldn't you?
00:37:22.672 - 00:37:23.178, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:23.264 - 00:37:23.514, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:23.552 - 00:38:11.410, Speaker B: So it's a little bit of splits. It really actually does split, wiren, yearn, Yiffy, Wifi, Wifey, whatever. It really splits that and Ampleforth right down the middle and constructs its own thing. So I think when you say that you think that yam competes with Ampleforth, I think that that will be up to the yam token holders as to how they perceive yam's role in Ethereum, because these five, they're calling themselves the horticulturalists, Brock, Trent, Clinton, Dan will, they are spinning up this system, but they don't own the system. The whole idea is that day one, it's in the hands of the community. So the community will decide what role does the yam token fulfill in Ethereum?
00:38:11.570 - 00:38:47.230, Speaker A: That's interesting, but it is a double edged sword to add governance, right? So like with ample, no amount of ample, the token at least entitles you to governance, correct? Right. And people would say, look, it's still centralized because there's a central team. Absolutely understand, right. You can change the code, that sort of thing. But with this governance of token holders, they can vote. 51% of yam token holders could say, we want to print all future supply of yam directly to this specific set of addresses. Right.
00:38:47.230 - 00:38:57.958, Speaker A: Whereas in Ampleforth there's no protocol mechanism for governance to do that. Right? No. That's a double edged sword, though, because that could be bad for a base money system.
00:38:58.044 - 00:39:04.458, Speaker B: Yes, base money system and governance are kind of like oil and water. But again, we will see what happens.
00:39:04.624 - 00:39:10.138, Speaker A: The cool thing about this is the Wifi distribution, I think. Yes.
00:39:10.304 - 00:39:33.938, Speaker B: And this is also yield farming for beginners. Because all you do is, if you were listening to this, you probably have one of these assets, right? You probably have Ave or link or synthetics or maker or comp or, oh, at the very least you have, we have wrapped ether, you have something here. And all you have to do is you deposit it. That's all you do.
00:39:34.024 - 00:39:45.698, Speaker A: And this is the point where we say, don't deposit anything that you're not willing to lose, right? Because there's no audits. No audits.
00:39:45.794 - 00:40:23.550, Speaker B: No audits, big audits, none. While the initial creators of the Yam protocol have made reasonable efforts to attempt to ensure the security of the contracts, including forking much of the code base from existing well audited projects and soliciting review from friends, nothing approaching the rigor of a formal audit has been conducted at this time. We strongly urge the caution to anyone who chooses to engage with these contracts and think a proper professional audit would be highly advisable if the project gets any meaningful use. This was a ten day project from start to launch. They started this ten days ago. This is completely like right out the gate. Your own risk.
00:40:23.630 - 00:40:48.646, Speaker A: This is Andre's. I test in prod. This is what's happened here. They're testing in prod. This whole thing could get hacked in a heartbeat, in a second. In fact, as soon as it receives some attention, you can bet there are some smart people looking at how they can exploit the vulnerabilities of this thing, right? So if you choose to do this, and we don't recommend that anyone. This is not financial advice.
00:40:48.646 - 00:41:00.846, Speaker A: We don't recommend anyone chooses to use these defi protocols. But this is, like, on the spectrum of risk, this is, like, code red super risky. You could lose anything you put into this thing.
00:41:00.948 - 00:41:40.490, Speaker B: Yeah, if you guys watched my settlement assurances and the protocol sync thesis talk at ethereal, I talked about the time value locked metric for valuating DeFi protocols, right? So, like, Makerdao has a really high time value locked. It's had a lot of value locked in its contracts for a lot of time. This has had $0 locked for 0 second. It is literally the worst time locked value score you could have. And the only unaudited plus unaudited. So the only way that you get time value locked is more value flows into the contract. So it's kind of like a chicken and egg debate, but when it comes to lindy, this has zero.
00:41:40.490 - 00:41:41.670, Speaker B: Zero lindy.
00:41:41.750 - 00:42:01.586, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know how much more we can say about how risky this is. It's just super freaking risky. I mean, I had a tweet last week. I feel like some people aren't appreciating the risks of. Or they aren't appreciating that other people are talking about the risks of defi. This whole place, the whole defi bankless thing.
00:42:01.586 - 00:42:19.702, Speaker A: We talk like, that should be wrapped in police caution tape. Like, do not cross unless a chunk of a building could fall on your head and wipe you out. Right. This is, like, dangerous stuff. Defi is not safe. So keep that into context. Other things are safer than others, but some things are safer than others.
00:42:19.702 - 00:42:32.540, Speaker A: But if you're entering all of this stuff, none of it is risk free. All of it's risky. You could lose everything. This is one of the most extreme sorts of things that we see. It does not appear to be a scam, right?
00:42:33.330 - 00:42:34.730, Speaker B: Does not appear to be a scam.
00:42:34.810 - 00:42:45.890, Speaker A: These are some legitimate names, but that doesn't mean much in terms of the risk. It means a little bit, I guess, but very risky. Anyway, anything else?
00:42:46.040 - 00:42:52.174, Speaker B: Nothing for me. Nothing about yams. We're calling it yampple. It's yampple.
00:42:52.302 - 00:42:59.880, Speaker A: It's yampple now stacking yams. All right, what else should we talk about, my friend?
00:43:00.810 - 00:43:02.450, Speaker B: Moving on to dexes.
00:43:02.610 - 00:43:05.686, Speaker A: Dexes. Okay. Dexs are blowing up. Right? In a good way.
00:43:05.788 - 00:43:07.686, Speaker B: Yes. In the way that we like.
00:43:07.788 - 00:43:08.646, Speaker A: Like, in a good way.
00:43:08.668 - 00:43:08.854, Speaker B: Right.
00:43:08.892 - 00:43:21.214, Speaker A: It's finally hitting product market fit. I'm going to pull up a tweet from Hayden about Dex volume while you maybe intro us to what's happening in the Dex world, because it's getting really excited. Yeah.
00:43:21.252 - 00:43:57.618, Speaker B: So this is one of those metrics that really indicates that all of the action is happening inside of Defi. Right. And that epicenter right now is uniswap. And we know this because newly issued tokens are getting listed on uniswap first before any other exchange. Binance just listed Wi Fi, Yifi token yesterday, a full two weeks after its genesis, so still pretty fast. But also two weeks behind Uniswap, because Uniswap is permissionless. Uniswap didn't need to wait for Andre to whitelist it on Uniswap.
00:43:57.618 - 00:44:26.210, Speaker B: That's not how it works. Still yet to be on Coinbase, and so the epicenter of this whole boom that's going on is uniswap. Right. All the volume is on Uniswap. It's dwarfing centralized exchanges. I don't know off the top of my head how much volume there is on a coinbase exchange on a daily or weekly or monthly basis. But I bet you if we saw a comparison of various centralized exchanges, and then you would have uniswap be up there in those numbers.
00:44:26.360 - 00:44:36.370, Speaker A: Look at this seven day volume. If you extrapolate that, $34 billion in volume annualized.
00:44:37.190 - 00:44:37.806, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:37.928 - 00:44:52.954, Speaker A: That's insane. I mean, that's a very large exchange at this point that has got to be eking up to even the krakens of the world. Let's say that tier of exchange. It's crazy.
00:44:53.072 - 00:45:11.360, Speaker B: I'm trying to find a tweet real quick so I can send it to you, but basically it is. Yeah. Here, I'm going to send this to you, Ryan, in zoom notes, so you can display this one. This one just came out today. If Uniswap was an l one blockchain, it would be third.
00:45:12.370 - 00:45:12.990, Speaker A: In what?
00:45:13.060 - 00:45:35.686, Speaker B: In fees. I'm pulling it up in fees. And this was actually a little bit late. There was an earlier image that showed, like, uniswap was at, like, holy crap .7 million in one day fees, and bitcoin was at, like, 0.9. So Uniswap is almost as big as bitcoin in how many fees? The volume of what fees are these?
00:45:35.708 - 00:45:36.950, Speaker A: Are these gas fees?
00:45:37.530 - 00:45:40.694, Speaker B: No, exchange fees. Not gas fees, exchange fees.
00:45:40.822 - 00:45:41.210, Speaker A: Right.
00:45:41.280 - 00:45:55.418, Speaker B: And so this is the 3.3% on every single Uniswap trade. That is what this is talking about. Right. Just Uniswap is taking a comparable amount of fees as the entire bitcoin blockchain.
00:45:55.514 - 00:46:04.882, Speaker A: And we said taking. But the interesting thing about Uniswap is these fees are going directly to liquidity providers, right?
00:46:04.936 - 00:46:14.194, Speaker B: So it's not going to the Uniswap team, it's not going anywhere. It's going to a nebulous set of liquidity providers, whoever they are.
00:46:14.392 - 00:46:53.886, Speaker A: This is an liquidity incentivization mechanism. Now, something else that I've been watching with Uniswap is just last week they announced 11 million in funding, which is interesting, right? And I wonder how that they've been a funded team before. They were obviously. The story of Uniswap is Hayden, who developed it, received like $100,000 something grant from the Ethereum foundation, built the whole thing. His first programming project launched it. And it was pretty popular from day one. But now they're starting to get funding, which leads me to wonder as to what they're actually going to do.
00:46:53.886 - 00:47:10.614, Speaker A: Like, is a token going to be next, right? Are they going to go the way of comp or balancer, which we've seen, and create sort of a capital asset out of these fees? And will a portion of that capital asset be rewarded or awarded to vcs? Which is interesting. What do you think about that?
00:47:10.732 - 00:47:34.662, Speaker B: Yeah. While I talk about what I think about that, go ahead and go to that link that I just sent you, because that one's pretty fun too. For every fully governance minimized governance, reduced protocol like Uniswap, for every protocol that is entirely trustless, entirely like hands off, there is also the governable hands on version of that.
00:47:34.736 - 00:47:35.166, Speaker A: Right?
00:47:35.268 - 00:48:02.758, Speaker B: So balancer has both of these, right? The cool thing about balancer is it launched with both of these at once, where you can have your own native balancer pool that doesn't answer to the balancer token, or you can, Uniswap is the non governance application, and there's probably a version of Uniswap that can be governed that would then justify the uniswap token. And so that is perhaps my idea as to what's going on.
00:48:02.844 - 00:48:03.800, Speaker A: We will see.
00:48:04.170 - 00:48:05.798, Speaker B: That graphic is so cool.
00:48:05.884 - 00:48:08.082, Speaker A: All right. They call this pacman.
00:48:08.226 - 00:48:21.386, Speaker B: Yeah. This is a graphic of all the transactions going on over a specific period or active addresses that are really like heavy defi users. Right.
00:48:21.488 - 00:48:44.414, Speaker A: These are the users. And each of these, by the way, each of these users, some people think they're individuals. We've talked about before on bankless Day of the nation, David, that it's not so much. Don't think of that as one to one mapping of individuals. It's one to one mapping to a bank account. An Ethereum address is like a bank account, and a bank account is a capital pool that can represent one individual, or many individuals could represent hundreds of thousands of individuals.
00:48:44.462 - 00:49:14.526, Speaker B: Right, right. Anyway, yeah. And this graphic just shows exactly where Uniswap is in relation to the rest of the defi ecosystem, which is at the epicenter. Right. So there's all this economic activity between synthetics, Kyber, DDX, Bancorp, Auger, compound maker, but then there's Uniswap that is basically connected to. So, like, whenever there's a transaction going on, on compound or auger or something, it's always seemingly one transaction away from uniswap. Right.
00:49:14.526 - 00:49:29.330, Speaker B: So no matter whatever people are doing, they're going through Uniswap to go through other protocols. And so Uniswap is just like this volume pac man that's just munching on all the liquidity in the space in a good way. Right.
00:49:29.400 - 00:49:59.578, Speaker A: What is. Oh, okay, so all that red in the center, that's usage accounts, ETh addresses that are shared by three or more protocols. So there's a whole bunch of accounts, it looks like, that are just using Uniswap. That's what that means if it's just on its own. So if it's yellow, then it means it's being shared by one or more protocols. But all of this kind of pink color, Uniswap color, some people are just going into defi just to use uniswap, it looks like.
00:49:59.664 - 00:50:31.874, Speaker B: Yeah, one way to view this. All these pink dots, these are all Ethereum accounts that are just using Uniswap. And there's a lot of them. There's more than there's ever been before. To me, this is a bunch of new entrants into defi, because Uniswap is the easiest protocol to use. The UI is super elegant, and it's the place where you go to buy all these defi tokens that are mooning. And so this massive array of pink dots that are people who are just using one protocol are the new entrances into Defi.
00:50:31.874 - 00:50:44.826, Speaker B: And eventually, over time, I predict that they will migrate into becoming yellow, and then also orange red dots, which are turning into Defi super users, right. They're using multiple protocols, but right now, Uniswap is like the first dot, and.
00:50:44.848 - 00:51:28.838, Speaker A: That'S why there's so many. Just a story, just evidence of this empirically. A text from a friend a couple of weeks ago. He said he's just a coinbase user. And he's like, hey, I want to do some stuff with Defi tokens. And he listed a few that he's interested in, and he's like, how do I do it? And I said, you can't get those in Coinbase, right? So we traded a text message back and forth, and he was motivated because of the speculation of DFI tokens, naturally, and he'd never been motivated before, but within 45 minutes, he set up a metamask account, had his first Uniswap transaction completed, and was one of those pink dots. Basically, it's difficult, but at this point in time, it's not that difficult.
00:51:28.838 - 00:51:36.090, Speaker A: I mean, two or three years ago, none of these dots existed. There was maybe Maker. Where's maker on this? Just maker.
00:51:36.510 - 00:51:38.394, Speaker B: Very far left is where.
00:51:38.592 - 00:51:48.938, Speaker A: Very far left. Yeah, it's just maker. And all of these dots are just. That's in the know. Year and a half, two years, right. Crazy, crazy stuff, David. Yep.
00:51:48.938 - 00:51:57.186, Speaker A: It looks like we are moving forward pretty fast, maybe at an accelerated pace. Should we wrap up with this?
00:51:57.368 - 00:51:59.630, Speaker B: I think that's it. That is the state of the nation.
00:51:59.790 - 00:52:14.018, Speaker A: All right. State of the nation today. Action items. We will include a few in the show notes. One, of course, is to verify eth supply yourself. We talked about that at first. Don't trust what you read necessarily on Twitter.
00:52:14.018 - 00:52:38.426, Speaker A: Dig a little deeper. And I think bankless listeners generally do. We'll include some links to yam and yam farming. Again, appreciate the risks before you do anything with that, but it is another fascinating monetary experiment. And lastly, we'll include some links to check out out some of the Dex usage as well. So you can see how that is growing too. Guys, none of this was financial advice.
00:52:38.426 - 00:52:49.180, Speaker A: Eth, bitcoin, all the D five protocols we always discuss are very risky. You could lose what you put in. This has been bankless. State of the nation, episode nine. Thanks a lot.
