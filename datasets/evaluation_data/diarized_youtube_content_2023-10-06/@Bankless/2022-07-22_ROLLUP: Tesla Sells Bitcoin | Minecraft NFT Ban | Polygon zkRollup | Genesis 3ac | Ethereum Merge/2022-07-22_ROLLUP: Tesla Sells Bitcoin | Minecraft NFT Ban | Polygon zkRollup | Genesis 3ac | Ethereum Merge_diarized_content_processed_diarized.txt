00:00:00.170 - 00:00:16.798, Speaker A: Is the bear market over? Happy third week of July, bankless nation. Are you ready for it? I hope you are. It's another weekly roll up where David and I download the week. And David, today you are coming in from Paris, France, right?
00:00:16.964 - 00:01:18.674, Speaker B: Yeah. So at ECC, where it all began, meaning a year ago, ECC a year ago was like the first conference that really kicked off conference season, and then just like a mania of conferences after that, but now it's a year later, and it's crazy that it's only been one year since the last ECC, which really, it kicked off in real life crypto for so many people, all the conferencers and conference goers of the world, so much has happened in the last year. Vitalik had his talk about non financial use cases of blockchains a year ago, and then about six months later, we have things like lens protocol gets shipped, and then soulbound tokens captures everyone's attention, and we have verifiable credentials. And so he just had a talk today. I actually didn't listen to it because I had to come do this, but I was talking to him in my quick little interview, which we'll talk more about later. I was like, vitalik, what are you going to talk about this year? What are we going to be focusing on in about six months as a result of this talk you're about to give? And so I asked him that question in a little interview.
00:01:18.802 - 00:01:48.538, Speaker A: Imagine the power to speak things into existence. You're just like, oh, I think it'd be cool if we did this. And then boom, stuff starts happening. But I know you brought a lot of content home with you from Ethcc. And the great thing about it is, guys, bakeless, I don't get out as much as David. Of course, you guys know this, right? So David hits all of the conferences for me and for all of us collectively, because we can't go to everything. And I think you've brought home like 2 hours of content or something like this, a whole bunch of interviews.
00:01:48.538 - 00:01:51.358, Speaker A: I haven't even seen some of this stuff, but you're going to have to.
00:01:51.364 - 00:01:54.206, Speaker B: Wait in line like everyone else. Ryan, are you going to tell us.
00:01:54.228 - 00:01:54.958, Speaker A: About that now, or are you going.
00:01:54.964 - 00:01:56.398, Speaker B: To tease that and talk about it?
00:01:56.404 - 00:01:57.550, Speaker A: Toward the end of this episode?
00:01:57.630 - 00:02:22.970, Speaker B: I'll just say I interviewed eight people from across the ecosystem. We'll talk a little bit more about some. Okay, here's one. Here's a little bit. I asked Kane about his fight with Suzu, so that was pretty fun. And then I also asked the Starkware team, if they would ever move Starkware the layer two into Starkware the layer one. So things just have a little bit more spiciness in real life.
00:02:22.970 - 00:02:24.406, Speaker B: So I enjoyed that angle.
00:02:24.518 - 00:02:42.638, Speaker A: I love that. Thanks for being spicy, man. These are the questions people want answered. But, guys, we have some of the topics that I think you're going to want to hear about, because the roll up, the purpose of this show that we do every single Friday, and I hope you're enjoying your morning coffee. People are like, why coffee? Why not herbal tea? Whatever your hot beverage of choice is, I hope you are.
00:02:42.724 - 00:02:48.526, Speaker B: Again, if it's only black coffee, it's coffee. If you add anything to it, it's a beverage.
00:02:48.638 - 00:03:10.838, Speaker A: See, like more of this carbs, minimalism coming out of David? I don't know, but we've got some topics to cover. We're going to get through them in just a minute. The first is the question on everyone's mind, I think is, is the merch being priced in okay, eth prices are way up from the bottom, but was that the bottom? The question is, was this the shortest bear market ever? What else are we going to talk about this?
00:03:11.004 - 00:03:34.154, Speaker B: Know, not too long ago, Ryan, there was the phone wars week where Solana launched its phone. And then we had three more phone things get released on the same week. Like, weird that happened the same week. Well, this week it's Zke EVM week. So Polygon just announced their ZKE EVM EVM equivalent. So did ZK sync and then also scroll. Also another Zke EVM.
00:03:34.154 - 00:03:56.966, Speaker B: Also announced their ZKE EVM announcement. So I guess this week is just Zke EVM week. And so we'll talk about why everyone's so excited about the ZkeVM. There's also, we get to actually get super detailed report as to what actually backs a USDC. So we'll talk about that. And of course, it's never ending. Ryan, the three arrow saga continues as it I probably will next week.
00:03:56.966 - 00:03:59.560, Speaker B: And the week after and the week after, I bet.
00:03:59.930 - 00:04:20.238, Speaker A: Guys, quick psa for you as well. Did you know if you're listening to bankless on Spotify, you can also see bankless on Spotify. This is a new feature that they just launched. They picked bankless as a podcast that they're co launching this with. Where inside of the Spotify app you actually get video. So go check that out on Spotify. I watch some of the podcasts I enjoy this way as well.
00:04:20.238 - 00:04:33.842, Speaker A: It's kind of a cool format and it gets some distribution outside of YouTube. So we've got a few different ways. We are distributing bankless visual content, and we do have some visuals in the show, so it can be useful to go check that out.
00:04:33.976 - 00:04:41.782, Speaker B: David, did you know, Ryan, that on the road, people that listen to the podcast often think I'm Ryan because they don't know what we look like.
00:04:41.916 - 00:04:42.646, Speaker A: No way.
00:04:42.748 - 00:04:47.750, Speaker B: Yeah. They very frequently are like, oh, Ryan from bankless. I'm like, no, the other one.
00:04:47.820 - 00:04:49.062, Speaker A: Because they've never seen your face.
00:04:49.116 - 00:04:50.370, Speaker B: Yeah, they don't know what we look like.
00:04:50.460 - 00:05:06.190, Speaker A: Guys, if you don't know what David or myself look like, you're missing out. You've got some pretty faces. You're missing out on at least one of us. Okay, but go check out Spotify. Just catch a glimpse. If you see us in person, you'll know who's David and who's Ryan.
00:05:06.530 - 00:05:07.870, Speaker B: We have nice cameras.
00:05:08.290 - 00:05:27.026, Speaker A: Yeah, we have. Okay, cameras. That's right, David. We got to also talk about our friends and sponsors, rhinofi. This is the company that used to be called diversify. This originally was a fantastic decentralized exchange, doing it the right way. Completely non custodial, completely bankless, built on starkware technology.
00:05:27.026 - 00:05:38.006, Speaker A: So built on a layer two, just like DydX. Now they are expanding, so they're rebranding. They're going like, I guess it's grab DFI by the horns. Is that a slogan they're using? If not, they should.
00:05:38.108 - 00:05:38.422, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:38.476 - 00:05:38.646, Speaker A: Okay.
00:05:38.668 - 00:05:39.702, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure they're using it.
00:05:39.756 - 00:05:53.366, Speaker A: It's Rhinofi, and it's no longer just trading. We've got some other money verbs in there that you can do. David, I'm going to pop this open so people can see what's happening in Rhinofi and tell us what else you can do in the Rhinofi app.
00:05:53.408 - 00:06:28.290, Speaker B: Right now, rhinofi is just obfuscating or abstracting a lot of the complexity of the multi chain universe. We all know that that's where we're going. Whether you believe it's multi layer one or multi layer two or both, rhinofi just abstracts so many of the layers so you can do your defi things regardless of what chain it's on, because honestly, sometimes you just don't really care what chain it's on. You just want to do the thing. And Rhinofi lets you do the thing without having to think about the chain that's behind the thing. And so you can invest and get yield, as we all do and know and love. You can put money into lps.
00:06:28.290 - 00:06:34.234, Speaker B: You can just do the basic trades and swaps so you can check it out. There is a link in the show notes to go there.
00:06:34.352 - 00:06:57.886, Speaker A: Yeah. I really feel like this is worth bookmarking because it's going to be an app that's going to get better and better. And of course, because you're on layer two, you get to save on all of the transaction fees. You can also sign up to hear about rhinofi's mystery airdrop that's going to be coming. They're dropping some cash with that $5,000 something to this effect. So go click the link in the show notes. Sign up for that so you won't miss out on another airdrop.
00:06:57.886 - 00:07:10.294, Speaker A: David, let's get to markets, man. Bitcoin. We got the happy music playing. We should play some happy music in the background because we're up a little bit on the week. Let me share the bitcoin charts and do you tell us what's going on?
00:07:10.412 - 00:07:22.666, Speaker B: Yeah, bitcoin up about 11% this week. It started about $20,200, and we are up to $22,600, 11%, double digit percent. You can't be sad about that. That is a good week.
00:07:22.768 - 00:07:28.620, Speaker A: I'm not sad about that. I'm very happy about that, actually. And EtH tells a similar story. What are we looking at here?
00:07:29.070 - 00:07:49.822, Speaker B: More than 11%. Ryan? Eth is up 31%, going up from about 1150 to where it is now at 1500. It hit $1,650 at the peak, which is pretty crazy. That is Pretty crazy. That is a good week. There's not very many weeks that you see 30% in a blue chip like Eth.
00:07:49.886 - 00:08:11.926, Speaker A: No, that's huge. Right. And so let's get into it, because the question on everyone's mind, I think, is twofold. Right? So we have the first question of, is the bear market over? And everyone always asks this right question, but the truth is EtH is up 73% from lows. At least it went up that high. Eth lows, if you recall. Look at this, David.
00:08:11.926 - 00:08:15.610, Speaker A: 897 was the low. We got into triple digits.
00:08:16.190 - 00:08:19.930, Speaker B: That makes my $904 buy feel really good.
00:08:20.080 - 00:08:22.618, Speaker A: Yeah. Wow. You got one of those?
00:08:22.704 - 00:08:24.574, Speaker B: I got a $904. Yeah.
00:08:24.692 - 00:08:26.014, Speaker A: I hope it was a big one.
00:08:26.132 - 00:08:27.998, Speaker B: You may have timed the bottom, but.
00:08:28.004 - 00:08:29.422, Speaker A: That was only a month ago, guys.
00:08:29.476 - 00:08:29.742, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:29.796 - 00:08:51.862, Speaker A: All right. And now, of course, because price drives narrative, as we all know. Price drives sentiment, as we all know. A bunch of people are asking, is the bear market over? Crypto is up. It must be over. Crypto market cap is over a trillion dollars. So that's one question the other question is, well, it seems like ETh went up a whole lot more than bitcoin this week.
00:08:51.862 - 00:09:11.994, Speaker A: Is news of the merge finally getting priced in? Let's take those questions one at a time. So first, bullish David, is the bear market over? What's the case for that? Whatever you say, I'll make the case for the opposite case. So why don't you tell us about the bear market?
00:09:12.112 - 00:09:59.934, Speaker B: I think it's actually worth going back and to the 2022 predictions post that we made at bankless. I said one of my predictions was that the merge would happen in 2022 and that Ether will not be in a bear market about three to six months post merge. As in the effects of the merge would cause not necessarily a bull market, but we would be out of the bear market as a result of the merge. And you're starting to see that being priced in right now. This is clearly and unequivocally, absolutely the merge having a price impact on ether, the asset today. Even in a bull market, even in a mania, it takes a lot for something to go up 30% in one week. It takes a lot more for something to go up 30% in a bear market going off.
00:09:59.934 - 00:10:23.794, Speaker B: Okay, granted, we bottomed at 900, and things generally bounce off of the bottom no matter what. So if that was the bottom, then you definitely get a bounce. But, like a bounce up to like 101. 200 is a good trade. What is that? Like 30% off the bottom? But we went 30% more off the bottom up to where we are now at $1,500. Is the bear market over? Bear market is like. It's kind of a sentiment like you're only in a bear market if you feel like you're in a bear market.
00:10:23.794 - 00:10:35.878, Speaker B: But I will say for me, Ryan, $1,500 does not feel like a bear market in the grand scheme of things. Like $1,500, actually pretty expensive. There's four digits in there.
00:10:35.964 - 00:11:22.678, Speaker A: So I think what people are asking when we're in the bear market is, is this just a temporary blip up before we take another plunge down to new lows? That's really the big question. Are we going to hit new lows? And so, first of all, I'll kind of address your thought about the merge being the ETH effect. The ETH price jump is because of the merge. I completely agree with that, actually. And I don't think I've ever seen the market price in some fundamentals in the way that I saw that happen this week. The market is kind of, to be honest, a short term dumb, I guess, because in this case, the merge as a fundamental is also a narrative, the market only kind of prices narratives. And so now we see, look at this difference down from all time high.
00:11:22.678 - 00:11:51.070, Speaker A: We were at like 83% or something for ETH and low 70 percentages for bitcoin. ETH has just caught right back up. It's only 68% down from all time high number. And bitcoin is 67% down from all time high. And you can also see, I mean, look at this jump on the ETH bitcoin ratio. We're up like 22% on the ratio. So relative to bitcoin, ETH has gone up 22%.
00:11:51.070 - 00:12:12.102, Speaker A: And that has to be the merge. So I'm with you on that. I think the merge is starting to get priced in, and it's just starting to get priced. All right, so maybe there's more to that to come. But let me give kind of the bear case of why we may not have hit the bottom yet. David, I don't want to hear it. No, you got to hear this.
00:12:12.102 - 00:12:52.050, Speaker A: Okay. And I think some of the reasons that you make the argument for the bullcase, but what scares me most probably is macro, the macro setup. We had Luke Groman on the episode last week. He's the worst he's ever seen in his career. We had Travis Kling on earlier this week, and he talked about the macro setup and what happens if something breaks in the broader macro environment. The fed raises rates too quickly, bond markets break. What's happening with the euro? What's happening with the now? Like, everything in macro is feeling kind of shaky and merge or not.
00:12:52.050 - 00:13:27.050, Speaker A: If something breaks or something gets really shaky in macro, we're going down and we ain't seen the bottom yet, in my opinion. I don't think the merge can save us if that is the setup and if that's what we go to. And I would also say, recall 2018, all right, we go down 80%, something like this, and then we'd pop back up and everyone be like, oh, it's over. That was the dip. I hope you bought the dip. Did you buy the dip and then back down again? And the plunge was even lower than the previous. So this is also the nature of a recovery.
00:13:27.050 - 00:13:55.766, Speaker A: It's like a staggered recovery where you go up and you go down and you go up and you go down. And it's like a staggered plunge as well on the way down. We still might be in that staggered plunge area. And if you were to ask me, I'd still probably, I'm probably 50 50 on it, David. That's probably where I am. Both are kind of equal probabilities. One that we're done, that we've hit the bottoms, and the other that we've still got a ways to go.
00:13:55.766 - 00:13:56.854, Speaker A: What do you think about this?
00:13:56.972 - 00:13:59.640, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's all a bunch of bs. I think we hit the bottom.
00:14:01.070 - 00:14:03.500, Speaker A: You ready to call it? You're buying in now.
00:14:04.190 - 00:14:28.500, Speaker B: Okay. So this falls into the same category that I see a lot of people doing. It's like, oh, let's retrofit 2018 and apply it to 2022. And, yeah, I mean, to some degree, like manias and bubbles. And when prices get out over their ski tips, it's all going back to the same pattern, which is like the human Psyche. So yeah, of course it's going to repeat. It's the human psyche that is making bubbles happen.
00:14:28.500 - 00:14:49.530, Speaker B: But that's actually different this time because of the actual merge. The merge is the most. It's the biggest catalyst in crypto ever. You would expect it to be different. And the whole point of it is that it is different. Ethereum moving to proof of stake is unlike any other proof of stake network. The fundamentals behind ether, the asset are unlike any other fundamentals.
00:14:49.530 - 00:14:55.930, Speaker B: This is not just some narrative. This is supposed to show up in the charts.
00:14:56.270 - 00:15:02.722, Speaker A: Let me ask though, do you think it could overcome catastrophic or very bad macro news? Macro?
00:15:02.806 - 00:15:31.094, Speaker B: No, I don't think that it will. However, also on our show with Groman, we also painted the picture of like, okay, macro could break and everything could go to zero and that'd be bad. Things going to zero will be bad. But also there's the inverse side where there's like a needle to thread where the Fed could turn on the money printer at the same time of the merge. And that's uber bullish. And so those things cancel each other out. And so I think you just don't consider that at all and just take it for what it is.
00:15:31.094 - 00:15:33.298, Speaker B: And what I see is the merge being priced.
00:15:33.394 - 00:15:52.102, Speaker A: Know, I actually think Arthur Hayes of Bitmex made the best case for that this week. And we're going to get into that in a little bit. So, guys, stay tuned. Anyway, this is the debate, and the market is absolutely having this debate. Bear market or bull market, not too sure. But we do know that the merge is a positive catalyst. I rattled off the market cap numbers, but we're above a trillion now, aren't we? That's good news.
00:15:52.176 - 00:15:57.054, Speaker B: Hooray. I feel like that's a pretty safe bull bear market line is $1 trillion. Market cap.
00:15:57.172 - 00:16:17.086, Speaker A: Yeah, it's definitely a good meme line, for sure. Jumping to this chart for a second. This was interesting. I saw this on Twitter this week. This is macro elf. 200 years of inflation adjusted returns for different asset classes. We're all dead in 200 years, but still, quite interestingly, showing a chart of assets over time here, David.
00:16:17.086 - 00:16:43.120, Speaker A: And this goes all the way back to the 18 hundreds. Right. So you kind of want to answer that question of everyone's asking, what is the best asset class to hold for the long run? Even though things go down, things go up. If you're a long term investor, you want to know, and you look at this annualized return over 200 years. Stocks, 6.6%. Bonds, 3.6%. T bills, 2.7%.
00:16:43.120 - 00:17:00.210, Speaker A: Gold, 0.1%. Us dollar, negative 1.4%. And I thought this was very interesting. I have a caveat to this and a very important caveat, but I want to get your reaction first. What do you think this is telling us?
00:17:00.360 - 00:17:08.734, Speaker B: Well, my first thought is that if crypto was on this chart, its line would be way higher than, like, 45 degrees. It would be like 50 or 60 degrees. Yeah.
00:17:08.872 - 00:17:11.240, Speaker A: Invisible. On this chart. It's ten years.
00:17:11.850 - 00:17:30.214, Speaker B: We did not have crypto in 18 two. But the annualized return of the crypto industry, it's something like 50% year over year, which is absolutely insane. And it's been like that ever since bitcoin started in 2009. That's really the only thing that I thought about when I saw this chart.
00:17:30.262 - 00:17:49.780, Speaker A: Do you know, I think the takeaways for many people in the traditional finance space are like, oh, this is why you should always hold stocks forever. And gold is such a scam. But here's the problem with that. And by the way, everyone will agree, holding fiat is a bad idea. Do you remember the Ray Dalio book that we just read?
00:17:50.230 - 00:17:51.422, Speaker B: Changing world orders.
00:17:51.486 - 00:17:53.090, Speaker A: Changing world orders. Okay.
00:17:53.160 - 00:17:55.654, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not the exact title. It's close enough.
00:17:55.772 - 00:18:39.650, Speaker A: This is just us assets. All of these are us assets. And the US has massive survivorship bias in that it basically became the world empire in the last 200 years and survived wars, all sorts of macro events. This is like an example of a successful economy and empire. Go look at Germany, or how many times did they reset their currency? How many times did their stock market go to zero? Basically, go look at Russia. Go look even at the UK, and you have a vastly different picture. So I think it's a complete mistake for people to look at this, especially when we're dealing with a changing world order.
00:18:39.650 - 00:19:13.022, Speaker A: Right. To look at this and to say, oh, I should always hold all of my assets in us stocks. This assumes a lot about the US's position of dominance in the future. And you might not want to make that assumption. And anyway, it's just a fallacy. I see when people throw up these charts, because if you were in Germany, for example, you had no access to stocks. Germany during one of the intervening periods where the currency dropped to zero and stocks went to zero, et cetera, then gold was, like, the best option for you.
00:19:13.022 - 00:19:16.430, Speaker A: And so massive survivorship bias in this chart is what I see.
00:19:16.580 - 00:19:51.340, Speaker B: Yeah. For the viewer, you can just imagine more or less like a wave. And this is how ray Dalio illustrates these things, is like, we are stocks, bonds, bills. Gold, not gold, are riding the wave of the US economy, and empires come and go. And so this can be like, in theory, could be like the peak of a wave, right? And now we're on the decline. You just have to broaden your horizons and sometimes realize that things and the global order, they only change every few hundred years. And so you have to take that into account.
00:19:52.030 - 00:20:12.782, Speaker A: We're kind of in that phase. Speaking of which, let's talk about the dollar. So the Dixie is still crushing it. Super high DXY is up. I know we asked the question of what is it composed of? The DXY composed of. We've got a table of what it's composed of. So what's in the DXY index? Why is it a measure of dollar strength? And what is it measuring dollar strength against?
00:20:12.916 - 00:20:28.642, Speaker B: Yeah, 57% euros, 13.6% japanese yen, 11.9% british pound, 9% canadian dollar. And we got tiny little bits of the swedish corona. Okay. And the swiss franc. And so, yeah, this is what the DXY measures against.
00:20:28.642 - 00:20:33.858, Speaker B: It's the strength of dollar against all of these things. But it's basically the euro. 60% the euro.
00:20:34.034 - 00:20:43.286, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So no wonder it is rising. And I think that paints the picture and tease us up for Arthur Hayes's take this week. Did you read this article, David?
00:20:43.318 - 00:20:45.082, Speaker B: I haven't read this one, so you have to walk me through it.
00:20:45.136 - 00:20:51.840, Speaker A: Oh, it's so good. Okay, so it's titled a samurai, a knight and a Yankee. Can you guess who those characters are?
00:20:52.610 - 00:20:58.960, Speaker B: I'm going to go ahead and guess. That is Japan, british, Britain and the United States.
00:21:00.210 - 00:21:32.460, Speaker A: So the samurai is the japanese central bank authority. The knight is the euros, Christine Lagarde. And the Yankee is Jerome Powell. Anyway, he kind of walks through them all kind of meeting in this inn and talking. Anyway, that's his narrative tee up. But the summary of this article, I'll read a quote from it. Arthur Hayes says, I will argue that the only solution left for any governments of countries that are not productive is to pay back their debt loads by inflating them away.
00:21:32.460 - 00:22:10.834, Speaker A: Any country that is not productive has to pay off its debt load by inflating it away. All right? And he goes through the reasons why the US is not nearly as productive as it once was. For every dollar the government spends, neither is Europe, neither is Japan. And so they're stuck in this position of having to inflate their debt away. Similar themes we talked about, lyn Alden, similar themes with Luke Groman and all of our macro podcasts and of course Ray Dalio. But then he goes into the setup right now, the macro setup right now. And so his first piece is Europe and Japan.
00:22:10.834 - 00:22:49.874, Speaker A: All right, from an energy perspective, they're in a bad place because they basically import all of their energy from other countries. They don't have much internal energy production. The US is in a different place from an energy perspective in that the US has a lot of its own natural resources. It's a net exporter, particularly natural gas is a strength. And he goes through the problem with what the EU and Japan are doing is they're inflating their currency. They're effectively going into like yield curve control mode and they're inflating it against energy, so they're issuing more of it. And this is causing massive inflation for their people.
00:22:49.874 - 00:23:28.494, Speaker A: This is like a Weimer republic type of play. And I know Luke Groman had talked about this, but they can't get cheap energy from Russia because the war in Ukraine, the US doesn't want them to. And so they're stuck in this rock and a hard place between. Their population is clamoring for lower prices on all of their consumer products, specifically energy and food and some others. And yet they can't release the pressure due to geopolitics. The US doesn't want them to. Maybe to some degree they don't want to as well.
00:23:28.494 - 00:24:22.378, Speaker A: So what's going to happen is the DXY is going to continue to rise. The dollar is going to continue to get stronger relative to those currencies we just talked about. That basket of currencies and inflation in Europe and Japan will continue to rise until there's a breaking point and the population says enough is enough. But the problem for Japan and for Europe is do they go back to Russia and try to get some cheaper energy, right? And like, the US doesn't want them to do that. And so maybe the US says, no, there's some political tensions, but they can't stay in their current state of continuing to inflate their currencies against energy in against the dollar. So what do they do? They have to go to the Yankee, they have to go to Jerome Powell, the US government, they have to go to treasury and they have to say, hey, you guys have to help us. If you want us to continue sanction this hard, you guys have to help us out.
00:24:22.378 - 00:25:15.026, Speaker A: And so what, Powell, what treasury is going to have to end up doing is going and buying bonds, buying japanese bonds, buying euro bonds, and effectively devaluing the dollar relative to these currencies, making these currencies stronger. Okay, what that's going to do is massively inflate the balance sheet of the Fed now not only with us debt and us bond debt, but also other sovereign countries debt, particularly its allies. That is kind of the way out. And so what Arthur predicts is going to happen is, on the one hand, Powell is going to say, yeah, we're trying to crush inflation. We're going hawkish on this. We're increasing interest rates by like zero point 75%. Yet again, we'll continue doing it.
00:25:15.026 - 00:25:52.150, Speaker A: We're going to break the back of inflation. I am Paul Volcker reincarnated. Watch me do this. On the other hand, he expects behind the scenes like treasury and the US government to actually be issuing more currency in order to buy the bonds of its allies. Okay? That's the backdrop here. If you play this out, that's what Arthur is predicting. But what this means, David Netnet is probably very bullish for cryptocurrency, particularly ether, particularly bitcoin, because whenever the money printer turns on, that's when these assets climb.
00:25:52.150 - 00:26:23.030, Speaker A: That is the correlation that's been preserved from the beginning. And right now we're in this phase of money printer is off right now temporarily. There's some quantitative tightening going on, but Arthur predicts that it's going to have to be turned back on in order to bail out us allies. And once that happens, crypto will resume its ascent and take off. So that is the thesis. And to me, it's kind of an aggregation and consolidation of much of the macro discussion we've been having on bankless. And I think it's a pretty reasonable prediction.
00:26:23.030 - 00:26:23.830, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:23.900 - 00:26:45.846, Speaker B: And that maps onto just like the general thesis that a lot of just, I would say, bitcoiners have about the state of fiat currencies in nation states is that you end up in debt. And sure there's volatility, sure you have bear markets, but the long term conclusion of the US dollar is to inflate away to zero and all fiat currencies inflate away to zero. And in that world, it's just like bullish for all assets.
00:26:46.038 - 00:26:56.654, Speaker A: Absolutely. Let's talk about another blue chip or another question that we have, which is, is DeFi back? All right, so some defi blue chips.
00:26:56.702 - 00:26:57.940, Speaker B: I'm ready to be heard again.
00:26:58.310 - 00:27:12.466, Speaker A: Are you ready to be heard again? DFI blue chips have been climbing so particularly ave looking good. Uni looking good. MKR also looking good. And they've been climbing even relative to ETH lately. I know we have a chart up here. What are we looking at, David?
00:27:12.578 - 00:27:23.820, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the East DPI chart since Genesis back in October of 2020. And in eth terms, it's like down only, but it's been up since May.
00:27:24.830 - 00:27:26.342, Speaker A: What is DPI, David?
00:27:26.486 - 00:27:49.122, Speaker B: Yeah, DPI is a DefI pulse index. It's just an index of a lot of defi tokens. And so I think Uniswap is like the biggest one. But of course there's maker Ave sushi swaps in there, a few other ones. It's the blue chips, just like all the defi blue chips. Right. And we've talked about the DPi before, but we stopped including it in the weekly roll up because every single week it was, like, down.
00:27:49.122 - 00:28:07.106, Speaker B: Sad. Yeah, there was no news. It was just like, yeah, it's just down all the time. But not in the last month or so. Ever since May, it's been a little bit up. So the ETH to DPi ratio was about zero four. We are currently at zero 62, which is a healthy percentage increase.
00:28:07.106 - 00:28:57.522, Speaker B: It topped out in the local high at the beginning of January at around zero 75. But, Ryan, we are still down very bigly versus ETH because it started in 2021 at about 00:26. So one quarter of an ETH was one Dpi, but now it's just zero six of an ETH is one DPi. But we know that DFI protocols are super bullish because they keep on earning all the fees. And so you can see on crypto fees, just like there are meaningful days where synthetics and uniswap are beating bitcoin in daily. This, in this particular day, with this screenshot, synthetix was behind bitcoin, but synthetix is from, if I'm recalling correctly, earning more fees than bitcoin most of the time, and that is a lot of fees. Uniswap just sweeping the floor of absolutely everything, getting more protocol fees than Ethereum is, which is nuts.
00:28:57.522 - 00:29:06.794, Speaker B: And so defi tokens are down bad, but they're all just like one fee swap fee switch away from just like earning a ton of money.
00:29:06.992 - 00:29:28.510, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree. And David, I know we've got some content coming on bankless on how to fix the economics and the governance of these defi tokens, because I feel like we've got product market fit, we've got successful protocols generating millions in cash. Now we just got to figure out that fee switch component, and then we're off to the races with DFI tokens. And I expect much more of a recovery.
00:29:28.670 - 00:29:38.840, Speaker B: Uniswap made $4.6 million in one day on the protocol. That is nuts. Yes, $4.6 million a day.
00:29:39.290 - 00:29:43.074, Speaker A: Pretty much all profit, too. It's like not a lot of operating.
00:29:43.202 - 00:29:44.534, Speaker B: Tell me to shut up.
00:29:44.732 - 00:29:49.282, Speaker A: That's fine. Tell them to tune into the roll up tomorrow and they'll understand why you're yelling.
00:29:49.426 - 00:30:17.940, Speaker B: I saw this chart this week on Twitter, so I thought about including it. It's an analysis on an Ethereum address. What do they do first on Ethereum, do they do a dex trade or do they buy an NFt? And the dex trade used to be in the lead for the majority of 2021. But it looks pretty clear that the recent trend is your first activity is more likely to be buying an NFT than it is interacting with a decentralized exchange. I mean, we kind of know this. Nfts are for everyone. There's always an NFT out there for you, no matter what.
00:30:17.940 - 00:30:27.294, Speaker B: If you don't like nfts, you just haven't found that one yet. And defi exchange stuff, not necessarily for everyone. NFT is about the culture and Defi is about finance.
00:30:27.342 - 00:30:35.062, Speaker A: Do you think we can just extrapolate this? And NFT is going to continue to lead DFI as the way people access the space for the first time. Do you think that's true?
00:30:35.116 - 00:30:53.750, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's right. Andrew Steinwald said it right. ERC 20 tokens, or currencies are meant to value stuff. They're a measurement of stuff. But nfts are the stuff. So, yeah, there's going to be a bajillion nfts and only a handful of ERC 20 tokens that are sustainable.
00:30:53.830 - 00:31:21.254, Speaker A: I guess in the real world, there is much more non fungible property than there is fungible property. So that kind of maps to the bits, map to the atoms in this case. And I have noticed, David, by the way, that the blue chip nfts seem to be doing okay. They seem to be holding up relative to ETH. I think the crypto punk floor is like 80 right now. 80 eth, something feels good. It's not too bad relative to ETH, relative to the fiats, it's down pretty bad.
00:31:21.254 - 00:31:33.670, Speaker A: And the ape floor is holding. It's like in the 90s, something like this. So the blue chip NFTs, I think some people would have expected them to really get crushed in Eth terms. And they just haven't.
00:31:33.830 - 00:31:45.182, Speaker B: Well, yeah, because you can't. Well, first you can't take leverage on nfts, so they're immune from that. But also, if you're in a pinch, you can't really sell an NFT in a pinch. So people don't, people are kind of like buy it and hold it for life.
00:31:45.316 - 00:31:54.366, Speaker A: That's a really interesting take. Yeah, I guess they're not selling. Maybe they're not forced sellers, too. Maybe it's a different type of individual holder. What do we got coming?
00:31:54.548 - 00:32:01.902, Speaker B: You will be able to leverage up on nfts later. That is a financial innovation that is definitely coming and that's going to unlock some absolute degeneracy in this industry.
00:32:02.046 - 00:32:23.174, Speaker A: Guys, coming up next, we're going to talk about merge dates. Has the merge date been announced? Maybe. Kind of. Not really getting close. Maybe we're going to talk about that. Also, it seems clear that it's ZK roll up season. But the big question is who's going to be first to market with the first ZK EVM roll up? That is ethereum equivalency.
00:32:23.174 - 00:32:35.278, Speaker A: And also we're going to talk about the three eras. Capital. Again, the saga continues. More court documents released. We're going to dive into what all of that means. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:32:35.444 - 00:32:56.674, Speaker B: Lens Protocol is an open source tech stack for building decentralized social media applications. It is the new era for social media. We all have toxic relationships with our web. Two apps. We want to break up with them, but we can't. These applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made, we need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us. Lens isn't a social media app.
00:32:56.674 - 00:33:25.194, Speaker B: It's a protocol to let a thousand web three social apps bloom. Lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user. In crypto we say, not your keys, not your crypto, and on lens we say, not your keys, not your profile. With lens, your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use. And instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app, lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media. Lens is the last social media handle that you'll ever need to create. So in order to get started, there is a secret code word in the show notes.
00:33:25.194 - 00:34:12.230, Speaker B: Enter that code word in the Google form links and you'll be well on your way to entering the world of web three, Social Zksync is an Ethereum layer two network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization. Zksync has combined the power of zero knowledge rollups and the Ethereum virtual machine, enabling developers to build the greatest web three projects possible, ones we haven't even seen yet. Crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world. But crypto killer apps need ZkSync as a platform to build on first. It's generally accepted that zero knowledge roll ups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology. And Zksync is leading the charge into the final frontier of crypto economics. So if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof foundation which gives your users the best UX possible, check out Zksync's website at zksync IO.
00:34:12.230 - 00:34:26.226, Speaker B: And yes, there's also going to be a token, so give them a follow on Twitter too. At zksync. The merge is coming. The merge is coming. Ryan, the merge is coming. We kind of have a date, maybe question mark. It is an actual date, but also with a question mark.
00:34:26.226 - 00:34:59.866, Speaker B: It's a maybe date. We are thinking about the 19 September for the merge. And so here is superfiz, who pays attention to these things, his tentative timeline. This is also Tim coming out of the all core devs call. Okay, so the Gorely testnet gets merged on the 11 August and we are live streaming that on bankless. So tune in for that. And if that goes well, the all core devs call after that, I believe on the 18th will plan the next merge and that will trigger like the Bellatrix and that other name of that testnet that I can't remember.
00:34:59.866 - 00:35:32.322, Speaker B: That whole client will get released. All those client software that I don't really know, the name I can't really remember. Go watch the episode with Tim Baco if you want those details. That'll happen two weeks after the August Gorely merge, and then we will merge two weeks after that. So August 18 is the all core devs call to pay attention to, but it is tentatively looking like possibly September 19, two weeks after that call. Again, this is not official, this is speculation, but the dates are becoming more and more clear. Everyone is super hungry for this, including the developers.
00:35:32.322 - 00:35:34.646, Speaker B: So merge date question mark?
00:35:34.828 - 00:35:56.442, Speaker A: Yeah, that's it. And so you'll find out more. We'll know more after the August 18. Whether the Gorely testnet was successful or failed the previous dress rehearsals have been successes. You kind of expect this one to be. And if it is successful, I've heard people, the hell presses of the world talk about the merge probability as high as 95% in September.
00:35:56.506 - 00:35:57.342, Speaker B: September. Yeah.
00:35:57.396 - 00:36:02.720, Speaker A: So this is the next key event, and we'll know much more in the next two to three weeks about this.
00:36:03.730 - 00:36:30.840, Speaker B: Obviously the whole entire industry has their eyes on the Eth price because of the merge. But if you really want to lean into this, there's plenty of derivative tokens that are going to have plenty of merge exposure, Lido and rocket pool being the obvious ones. But there are also some extremely undervalued staking as a service tokens that are out there. We are actually going to be doing an article on this on bankless, but if you want to do your own research and get ahead of the game, there's your alpha. You're welcome.
00:36:31.290 - 00:37:03.854, Speaker A: Yeah, and by the way, Alpha, go subscribe to the Bankless newsletter if you're just a podcast listener. So you get this stuff in your inbox. All right. Also, let's talk about the second thing, which is it feels like ZK roll up season. Feels like all of the roll ups are competing for us as Ethereum users. And I got to tell you, that feels good. The big question, I think, is who gets to claim the release of the first ZK EVM that is a fully ethereum compatible EVM chain in a ZK rollup.
00:37:03.854 - 00:37:31.420, Speaker A: And before we read out this tweet, David, can you just give people some context on why are ZK roll ups so cool? What's neat about, and like, I know people have probably heard us talk about roll ups a lot and layer two and the scalability strategy, but let's get beyond that. Roll ups are the way Ethereum scales. We know that. Why are ZK rollups special specifically? And why within that are ZK EVM roll ups special?
00:37:31.790 - 00:38:14.586, Speaker B: Okay, quick, quick roll up. Tldr speed run. We got optimistic roll ups and optimistic roll ups are secured by, like, there is potentially, say that there's an imposter in the building, and if you find the imposter, you can go and you find them and then kick them out. And then you have this assurance that you can kick them out of the building that you don't want the imposter in, but the imposter can't get in the building in the first place, and you have to go and do the thing to kick them out. A ZK roll up is secured by, like, no, an imposter can't even enter the building, which is kind of an interesting metaphor. Another way to describe this is optimistic roll ups. They're a blockchain that bundle up a bunch of transactions and settle it down to the layer one.
00:38:14.586 - 00:38:47.926, Speaker B: ZK roll ups are another layer of compression. So it's basically compressing everything by putting into one bundle. But then the ZK side of things is like another cryptographic compression on top of that. So we're aggregating a bunch of transactions compressing that, and that gets put down to the Ethereum layer one. So the combination of the security model of ZK roll ups, which means that you don't have to wait, for example, the outbound bridge out of arbitram and optimism takes seven days for your ether or other tokens to clear, because they.
00:38:47.948 - 00:38:51.970, Speaker A: Want to make sure the security guards can go find the bad guys buildings.
00:38:52.130 - 00:39:26.830, Speaker B: Right, exactly. And so that has some cost to it. And then there's ZK roll ups, which, because of that security model, all transactions have instant finality. And so that makes them faster and cheaper, but they also makes them less expressive. So this is why we have had Starkx's, which is like more proprietary app layer chains, like Dydx, which is now moving over to Cosmos. But still, in the Starkx ecosystem, there's also immutable X, which is a Starkx chain. These are all proprietary, custom built ZK chains for these specific use cases.
00:39:26.830 - 00:39:44.646, Speaker B: Which brings us into the concept of ZK evms, which is a generalizable Zk roll up, which is so like, we have optimism, and arbitrum, which are super generalizable. They're just like Ethereum. They can do solidity. They have the virtual machine. You can write an arbitrary code. You can build whatever. With Zks, up to this point, you haven't been able to do that.
00:39:44.646 - 00:40:11.274, Speaker B: You would have to custom build your own chain, and it would be a Zk roll up. And with the Zk EVM, we are bringing customizability and expressivity to the power of zero knowledge cryptography, zero knowledge rollups. And we generally conclude. Everyone says, even Vitalik, especially Vitalik. He's the one that says this actually is that we long term conclude. In a world of ZK rollups, it doesn't even matter if we're talking about Ethereum like Cosmos will eventually be a Zk ecosystem avalanche. If they get it right, they'll do be a Zk ecosystem.
00:40:11.322 - 00:40:13.646, Speaker A: Even the optimistic rollups will probably, even.
00:40:13.668 - 00:40:54.662, Speaker B: The optimistic rollups will eventually become Zk rollups. And that is an explicit strategy stated out of optimism themselves. So everyone's going ZK at the end of the day. And so this is why the fight for the first Zke EVM is such a big deal, because you have the best sort of scaling compression technology in the world mixed with the evm, the know tech stack of smart contracting languages. And so the Zkevm is a huge fight. And so this is where we'll get into this tweet that we're showing on screen, where John Adler says, congrats to scroll Polygon and ZKsync for each announcing the first ZkevM, because it all happened this week. I do think that I could be wrong on this, but I might.
00:40:54.662 - 00:41:07.620, Speaker B: Pretty sure I'm right. I do think the credit goes to Zksync. I think they had this stuff out like a year ago. Yeah, I will say that. But the Twitter army can fact check me on that one.
00:41:08.070 - 00:41:16.146, Speaker A: I don't even know who's first. What I love to see, though, is, like, them competing to be first. It's so good to see because they.
00:41:16.168 - 00:41:17.162, Speaker B: Are also so nerdy.
00:41:17.246 - 00:42:02.482, Speaker A: It's so nerdy. But they're competing for Ethereum users, and they're all competing to scale Ethereum. This goes back to the strategy of Ethereum, which is kind of genius retrospectively, which is to basically outsource its scalability to a massive number of teams and companies. And so they can expand all at once in multiple directions. Right? It almost like, reminds me of kind of like some kind of an organism, like a fungus or something, or some kind of a spore, that's just like simultaneously expanding in this decentralized way in all of these different directions. And you can really see the genius of it because it's brought competitors to play. And so let's go through each of these one by one, David, because I think it's worth talking about.
00:42:02.482 - 00:42:39.600, Speaker A: So Polygon released this week its ZK EVM solution. So of course, Polygon has its proof of stake chain. But they also acquired a technology called Hermes. They did that about a year ago, if I'm recalling correctly. And Hermes had a whole bunch of ZK evm tech already built, and now they are taking that, repackaging that under Polygon, getting kind of the polygon business development effect and rollout marketing around it and launching that. And apparently what they're launching is something that they say is EVM equivalent. We could talk about that.
00:42:39.600 - 00:42:57.946, Speaker A: It's open source, it fully uses Ethereum, of course. It's its layer one, and it's an implementation only. So they got the GitHub, they have the code. It's an implementation, not testnet yet. Okay. They didn't announce a testnet. They said that that is going to be next, but they're not at the testnet phase.
00:42:57.946 - 00:43:33.380, Speaker A: But this, I think is pretty big news because it's Polygon, and Polygon, I mean, we've been talking about the last few rollups, has onboarded so many different companies and solutions. Like their business development arm is absolutely humming. So that is the first solution, is polygon, ZKE, EVM, maybe EVM equivalent. I'm not actually sure how equivalent it is versus compatible. These are two terms that we're going to talk about. What is the difference between EVM equivalent and compatible, David? Or is this something that we have to just do more research on to figure the differences out?
00:43:34.470 - 00:44:04.554, Speaker B: I understand it actually pretty well at a conceptual level. It's the nuances, the more detailed stuff that I don't understand. Basically, the EVM isn't one thing. It's not like something that you can point to. It's like a set of standards. And so there is an EVM tech stack that includes many, many different things. And at some point in that tech stack, you can fork away from the EVM and then do something different on all parts, all things above the stack that you've forked away from.
00:44:04.554 - 00:44:20.682, Speaker B: So, like, think of it as like a multilayered cake. And you can fork away from the EVM standard at the top and be mostly EVM equivalent, but not completely. Or you could fork away something at the very bottom and be very, very divergent from the EVM, but only be a little bit like the VV.
00:44:20.746 - 00:44:22.894, Speaker A: Why does it even matter? Right?
00:44:22.932 - 00:45:06.010, Speaker B: And so there is an entire ecosystem of. Devtooling is the big one. And this is where I'll start to get stressed in my knowledge. But like devtooling, like solidity, like compilers, like technical speak, technical speak, technical speak. But there's a bunch of just like peripheral infrastructure that is all built around the EVM. And so being completely EVM equivalent, rather than just mere EVM compatibility, also unlocks the complete suite of infrastructure and compatibility of all the devtooling and surrounding, again, infrastructure that has been built around this EVM standard. And so if you are EVM equivalent, you will ride in the tailwinds of all of this open source development.
00:45:06.010 - 00:45:30.310, Speaker B: And so if you fork off of the EVM standard too soon, you are going solo and you have to build your way where. Think of it like a peloton, right? Like a bicycle line of bicycles. Super efficient if the bigger group it is. But if you fork away, you're kind of going on your own. It's more headwinds. Although you can do it for very good reason. The EVM is by no means like a perfect set of technology.
00:45:30.310 - 00:45:42.674, Speaker B: It's just a set that we have. And so you can go solo and do it for the right reasons and just build super, a highly optimized thing. But then you also just lose the drafting speed of completing.
00:45:42.802 - 00:46:05.998, Speaker A: This is the point. Equivalents of equivalents and also compatibilities. You take all the stuff that's been built on the EVM and you have the ability to just port it with minimal work, in some cases zero work. You could take all the Uniswap code, all the ave code, everything in deFi, everything in nfts, and it just works out of the box. That is the point of all of this EVM compatibility and equivalency. Talk about the second one. ZK sync.
00:46:05.998 - 00:46:15.060, Speaker A: So they've just also announced something this week and their take on a ZK sync. Zke EVM. What did they say?
00:46:15.430 - 00:46:43.942, Speaker B: Yeah, they're doing the same thing that Polygon did they say today we're happy to announce ZK sync 2.0. The first ZKE EVM roll up will be live on Mainet in 100 days. That is about the same roadmap as Polygon. I had in my very many set of interviews that I've done at ECC. Mihalo was one of them, where we talked about this. Mahalo from Polygon. I also talked to Alex from Zksync yesterday as well.
00:46:43.942 - 00:46:51.166, Speaker B: We were talking about some of this stuff. Everyone's like, again, the timing of this is just so funny. Everyone's about on the same timeline with.
00:46:51.188 - 00:46:55.790, Speaker A: Like, well, they're rushing. It's a roll up race basically, right?
00:46:55.860 - 00:46:56.974, Speaker B: Yeah, big time now.
00:46:57.012 - 00:46:58.178, Speaker A: One difference though is this is going.
00:46:58.184 - 00:46:59.602, Speaker B: To unlock some cool stuff.
00:46:59.736 - 00:47:07.854, Speaker A: ZK sync. I believe they've had a testnet for a while, I mean, to the point you made earlier, and I don't think polygon, ZKE EVM has had a testnet yet, and they don't.
00:47:07.982 - 00:47:08.660, Speaker B: Correct.
00:47:09.270 - 00:47:14.402, Speaker A: They're throwing down dates, David, 100 days to mainnet. I don't think scroll.
00:47:14.466 - 00:47:15.622, Speaker B: That is a specific number.
00:47:15.676 - 00:47:27.770, Speaker A: That's a specific number. We'll be counting this down, but, yeah, that would be great. And it's a similar solution. Right. We should probably do a whole episode on. Yeah, we're going to panel between these things.
00:47:27.920 - 00:47:33.900, Speaker B: All these Zke EVM competitors, let's just put them all in the same zoom and see what happens.
00:47:34.350 - 00:47:55.438, Speaker A: Seriously, though, we'll just ask questions of them and let's kind of see what happens. Okay, now, here's the third, guys. Yeah, here's the third that announced. So the third is scroll. This is. I'll read the tweet. After over a year of building our Zke EVM based ZK roll up, in close collaboration with the privacy scaling group at the Ethereum foundation.
00:47:55.438 - 00:48:16.620, Speaker A: Little flex there, we are releasing the pre alpha version of scroll for external testers. Okay, so they have something that sounds similar to Polygon, but they're calling it a pre alpha version. Seems like there needs to be a testnet still before we get to, again, you know, order of magnitude around the same timeline as these two other ZK roll up.
00:48:17.710 - 00:48:28.206, Speaker B: Yeah. Like Ryan watching arbitram and optimism have their competition. That's been fun. The Zke EVM competition is going to be so fun.
00:48:28.388 - 00:48:29.120, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:29.490 - 00:48:33.230, Speaker B: As a media person, I'm just going to sit back with my popcorn. It's going to be great.
00:48:33.300 - 00:48:54.086, Speaker A: Yeah, it's going to be great. And as David and I have said before, we love all of our children equally. We are very excited about this. All of these technologies are maximally decentralized technologies. Right. That are prioritizing security and decentralization. If they are designing a ZK roll up correctly, that's what they're doing.
00:48:54.086 - 00:49:13.094, Speaker A: So they're scaling the values that we care about most, which are decentralized, bankless values. And so we're cheering all of you guys on. Well done. Keep running. In this race, I hope you each win. Exactly. All right, David, let's get to the 3 hours capital.
00:49:13.094 - 00:49:25.206, Speaker A: More CFI drama on the way this time. I think the leading news is there was an affidavit that was released. Remember we talked about so much? All of this would be settled in court documents. This is like a thousand page court.
00:49:25.258 - 00:49:28.386, Speaker B: Document that does not scream efficiency to me.
00:49:28.408 - 00:49:31.374, Speaker A: Ryan, no, it does not. I mean, this is not written on chain anywhere.
00:49:31.422 - 00:49:36.094, Speaker B: It's 1157 pages of legal docs.
00:49:36.142 - 00:49:58.540, Speaker A: Imagine how much going to read that. How much money did it cost? Ignore kind of the court system and all of the infrastructure, but just to create a document like this and gather all these facts. Anyway, we've learned some things from it. One of the things we learned is that the crypto lender genesis, which is an absolutely massive crypto OTC firm, they lent three arrows capital $2.36 billion.
00:50:00.030 - 00:50:18.914, Speaker B: That's a lot, David, if you have a bajillion dollars and somebody comes knocking at your door and says, hey, can I borrow $2.3 billion? I don't think there's. I'm not in this business, so what do I know? But I don't feel like you say yes to that question. You don't lend $2.3 billion.
00:50:19.112 - 00:50:20.318, Speaker A: Well, it's collateral.
00:50:20.494 - 00:50:24.606, Speaker B: No one who needs $2.3 billion is in a good spot.
00:50:24.798 - 00:51:00.154, Speaker A: Well, it's collateralized, right? So there's a portion of risk that's removed because it's collateralized. The Genesis loans 30 s capital had a margin requirement of over 80%, and it did sell some of the collateral when three arrows capital failed to maintain that. But you definitely get the sense that there's a delta, and I'm not sure if the numbers are named here, of how much three arrows capital actually owns Genesis. I pretty sure Genesis is going to be fine. They're absolutely massive. I think they had better risk management, certainly, than the Celsius's of the world. But I'm sure this also still hurts.
00:51:00.154 - 00:51:13.970, Speaker A: And that is why they're more junior to the Defi protocols. Let me say that three zeros capital had to pay back, as did Celsius, as did block all of the D five protocols. But it looks like they're still out some money here, David.
00:51:14.710 - 00:51:27.030, Speaker B: Yeah, so I just did the math. 80% of 2.36 billion is $472,000,000. They probably got less than that. So they're probably at least 400 million in the whole. That's more money than I have.
00:51:27.100 - 00:51:42.480, Speaker A: That's painful. Right? I think all of CFI is learning about risk management again, and I think they'll be much more cautious moving forward. At least you hope so. But we don't know. We don't know for sure. This is another one. 3 hours capital total.
00:51:42.480 - 00:51:47.134, Speaker A: They owe their creditors at least $3.5 billion.
00:51:47.332 - 00:51:56.494, Speaker B: I would love to see a leaderboard, a high scoreboard of who got hurt. By 3 hours capital the most. I think this is number one. I'm pretty sure.
00:51:56.532 - 00:52:01.246, Speaker A: The pain dashboard voyager. This is everybody, Dave, the 3.5 billion.
00:52:01.278 - 00:52:16.834, Speaker B: Yeah, this is everybody, right? And so Voyager is up there pretty high up there at 660,000,000. I think this comes in at number two, like, roughly 400, 450,000,000. I would just love to see that list of just, like, all the contagion.
00:52:16.882 - 00:52:28.220, Speaker A: Meter Celsius is on there. 75 million. Of course, Celsius, now defunct and coinless services. A lot of this is retail money, is the tragedy of it.
00:52:28.910 - 00:52:31.894, Speaker B: I always forget that. And I'm like, oh, yeah, wait. And this is sad.
00:52:31.942 - 00:52:49.282, Speaker A: Yeah, it is sad. It is sad. We'll talk about Celsius in a little bit, but the audacity of this. Here's another headline for you. David Suzu, 3 hours capital. The co founder, he just filed a $5 million claim against his own firm while he's on the run. Okay.
00:52:49.336 - 00:53:00.502, Speaker B: I feel like they should just like, yeah, sure, you can have your money. Come get it inside the United States of America. We'll give it to you. We'll give it to you over here that's waiting for you here inside the US.
00:53:00.556 - 00:53:22.866, Speaker A: Here's the quote. I've just seen the list of creditors to 3 hours capital and noticed that Suzu has filed a claim for $5 million. While being on the run, he has somehow found the time to diligently and ruthlessly fill out forms to pursue a claim against his own fund. Well, you find time for that, Suzu, but not to tell us what's going on with 3 hours capital.
00:53:22.918 - 00:53:24.394, Speaker B: Sue, come on the podcast.
00:53:24.442 - 00:53:26.720, Speaker A: Oh, God. What would we even say?
00:53:27.490 - 00:53:28.730, Speaker B: Oh, I've got some thoughts.
00:53:28.810 - 00:53:43.474, Speaker A: Celsius. This is going back to Celsius and some of that retail money. But we have some new news as to what the gap might be. Looks like Celsius has a $1.2 billion balance sheet hole. That's the size of the bullet wound. Just a $1.2
00:53:43.474 - 00:53:57.538, Speaker A: billion fund hole. And that they have. Let's see, Celsius has 5.5 billion in liabilities. That's the bad stuff. And $4.3 billion in assets.
00:53:57.538 - 00:54:26.546, Speaker A: So you can see where we get the delta of $1.2 billion. Yeah, kind of painful. And, again, retail will be one of the debtors, essentially, that bankruptcy has to pay back. But it just matters in order of operation where they fall. Right? So, like, more senior debt holders to Celsius could be far above them and get their $1.2 billion back before retail does.
00:54:26.546 - 00:54:38.330, Speaker A: So I don't know, David, what the status of my Celsius account is. Am I 100% down or only like 50% down? And I guess we'll see in the court document.
00:54:38.510 - 00:54:43.638, Speaker B: I think you get like 70% to 80% back. Yeah, we'll see in like a year.
00:54:43.804 - 00:54:58.890, Speaker A: What's so interesting is, again, but DFI has not had this problem whatsoever. We're going to watch this play out over weeks and months and years as we have in the roll ups. I'm already almost sick of talking about it. It's just.
00:54:59.040 - 00:55:00.858, Speaker B: No, we're talking about it next week, are we?
00:55:00.944 - 00:55:20.178, Speaker A: But DFI just happens so quickly and everything's on chain. All of the pain is over basically, instantly, 24 hours. You have to go to courts. We don't have to have 1000 page documents. That in itself is a beautiful thing and certainly much more time efficient. What else we got in the roll up, David? What are we going to talk about?
00:55:20.264 - 00:55:38.054, Speaker B: All right, coming up next, in the second half of the show, the ENS markets continue to be super hot. Somebody accidentally bought something for 100 ETH and they didn't mean to. An ENS named Jesus Eth. We'll go in that. That's a fun little story. Also, what exactly backs a USDC? Now we know. Now we know.
00:55:38.054 - 00:56:12.654, Speaker B: And also there's a new token coming. It's a bridge token, but I'm not going to say which because I'm going to tell you as soon as we get back from some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Juno is bringing crypto friendly banking straight into your checking account. With Juno can send money from your Juno checking account straight onto a layer two like Polygon optimism arbitrum, and they have Zksync and Starknet support on their way. You can skip the Ach wait times, you can skip all the gas fees and go straight from your checking account to an Ethereum layer two in seconds. Inside Juno, you can buy and sell crypto with zero dollar fees. And your Juno checking account comes with a metal Mastercard that gives you up to 5% cash back on your spending.
00:56:12.654 - 00:56:43.046, Speaker B: Juno is also giving you $10 cash back on your first crypto deposit and $100 when you set up a direct deposit. This ad just writes itself. So go sign up at Juno finance bankless. The Brave browser is the user first browser for the web three Internet with over 60 million monthly active users. And inside the Brave browser, you'll find the Brave wallet, the secure, multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser web three is freedom from big tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy. But there's a weak point in web three. Your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions, which can easily be spoofed.
00:56:43.046 - 00:57:10.706, Speaker B: But the brave wallet is different. No extensions are required, which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets. Brave Wallet is your secure passport for the possibilities of web three and supports multiple chains, including Ethereum and Salana. You can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp. And of course, you can store, send and swap your crypto assets, manage your nfts, and connect to other wallets and DFi apps. So whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro, it's time to ditch those risky extensions. And it's time to switch to the brave wallet.
00:57:10.706 - 00:57:42.346, Speaker B: Download Brave@brave.com slash bankless and click the wallet icon to get started. And we're back. Jeremy Alair tweets out. Jeremy Alair of Circle, who runs USCC, says, as a part of our commitment to increasing transparency and disclosure around USDC today we are publishing our first monthly breakdown of the USCC treasury reserve assets by each and every treasury bond and list of cash reserve custodians. They even have something Ryan called the CuSIP, which sounds like a serial number for our particular treasury or something. So they're down to the serial numbers of their assets and the valued.
00:57:42.346 - 00:57:49.170, Speaker B: So, like, this is the most amount of disclosure that I've ever seen any bank or any financial institution. Nice job, circle. Well done.
00:57:49.320 - 00:58:20.006, Speaker A: Yeah, it's great. So what is backing your USDC? Well, it's almost all us treasuries. So 42 million of the 55 is treasuries, and the other 13 million is cash in the bank, in actual bank accounts. That's what's backing it. So mostly treasuries and then some dollars in a bank account, that's pretty much digital bank account dollars. It's pretty much your wells Fargo dollars. Some treasury, except tokenized, that's what a USDC is.
00:58:20.048 - 00:58:26.480, Speaker B: Aren't treasuries bullish in high interest rates? So isn't interest rates going up good for the USCC business model?
00:58:29.330 - 00:59:01.786, Speaker A: Treasuries? Well, I don't know. The interest rate is really the treasury yield, right? So what's the interest rate? Like 1.75, something like this? Right. So it provides a slightly higher return than pure cash, but I guess that could go up. It's pretty much a dollar, though. It's just like when you put your funds in a Wells Fargo account, or it's called a certificate of deposit or something like that. That's ultimately on the other side, going to treasuries, generating some nominal yield, kind of like that.
00:59:01.786 - 00:59:09.402, Speaker A: A savings account. It's a bank account. It's a bank dollar. What about Ave, David? They're doing something with balancer, a token swap. What is this?
00:59:09.456 - 00:59:24.938, Speaker B: Yeah, they did a dow token swap. Ave Balancer token swap proposal was passed and also has been executed. So about $1.1 million worth of Ave was swapped for about $1.5 million worth of balancer. I don't know why they had a discrepancy. Maybe just illiquidity premium.
00:59:24.938 - 00:59:43.522, Speaker B: So now Ave owns some pal and bal owns some Ave. We did a show with them forever ago about how Balancer would use aave in the back end to increase the yield for a lot of the assets deposited into balancer lps. And that goes into Aave. And so this partnership has been long and strong. And now there's a formal token swap.
00:59:43.666 - 00:59:45.622, Speaker A: Why do they do this? Just to cement their.
00:59:45.756 - 00:59:47.480, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's a.
00:59:48.570 - 01:00:08.366, Speaker A: We're just, we're now more aligned than we were previous to this token swap. Yep. It's interesting. Curve is also announcing, or there's rumor that Curve is going to be releasing a stablecoin CRV Us dollar. Do you know anything about this rumor? I saw this tweet. It was worth talking about, but I haven't seen, I don't know much about.
01:00:08.388 - 01:00:23.140, Speaker B: This rumor, but we had the phone releases, then we had the Zkevm releases, and then Aave released a stablecoin at decentralized stablecoin. Then Curve released a decentralized stablecoin. Some really cool developments coming out. I would love to cover this when the details are out.
01:00:23.670 - 01:00:49.002, Speaker A: Let's get into the NFT scene right now. First, some bad news. Openc lays off roughly 20% of its staff. And this is Devin Finzer. He cites unprecedented combination of crypto winter and broad macroeconomic instability. Have you heard anything about this, David? I know a lot of crypto companies are laying people off Coinbase, obviously blockfi, but many of them. Is this just another.
01:00:49.136 - 01:01:04.160, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just like the big entrenched people, I guess. I wouldn't call Opensea too entrenched, but the bigger players seem to be laying people off and the smaller players seem to be scooping people up. So I'm sure these people are just hopping into another job, another crypto job.
01:01:04.470 - 01:01:52.320, Speaker A: Also in NFT news, Kevin Rose, his proof project has just acquired an Ethereum NFT team called Divergence. Looks like this is kind of an aqua hire engineering aqua hire. But Kevin and Proof definitely have big plans to expand Moonbird's ecosystem, the proof ecosystem, into a social universe. And David, we had Kevin on the podcast a couple of months ago, and he basically dropped a game plan to us of how to actually do this, how any creator can kind of, with a little bit of this and a little bit of that, create a NFT community, membership driven community for their fans. And so he already gave us the blueprint. Now it looks like he's going a few more steps down it. I'm really excited about what he's doing because I think it's paving the way for many others to follow.
01:01:54.130 - 01:02:08.600, Speaker B: He said he was very committed into seeing this thing, fully committed to this whole thing, and it definitely has shown up in stuff like this, the proof ecosystem, like you said, kind of just giving people a blueprint to do similar things.
01:02:09.210 - 01:02:55.934, Speaker A: I hope they do. I think we are learning some lessons from it as well. In bad NFT news though, did you see David Minecraft just issued a ban on nfts in its game. And of course Minecraft is an infinitely moddable type of ecosystem and probably the biggest and most well known virtual worlds out there. But I want to give you the reason why, because I was very curious as to why would Minecraft do this? What are their stated reasons? And I think this is a reason I haven't heard quite articulated this way. But let me read it from their notice where they said NFTs are now banned from Minecraft. Each of these uses of NFTs and other blockchain technologies creates digital ownership based on scarcity and exclusion.
01:02:55.934 - 01:03:41.694, Speaker A: Scarcity and exclusion, which does not align with Minecraft. Values of creative inclusion and playing together. Nfts are not inclusive of all our community and create a scenario of the haves and the haves nots. The speculative pricing and the investment mentality around nfts takes the focus away from playing the game and encourages profiteering, which we think is inconsistent with the long term joy and success of our players. I got to admit when you read that it is a reasonable take at the high level in that value. It's not just like nfts are bad and they never work and they're just a bunch of scams and they're always stupid. It doesn't align with our values.
01:03:41.694 - 01:04:07.750, Speaker A: We want our economy to be basically completely free, purely open source. We don't want digital property rights in the Minecraft universe. We want everything to be copy and paste. We don't want digital scarcity at the very bottom found. So what do you think of this argument? Because I think it's an interesting philosophical argument for games. When you do inject private ownership of digital property, it does change the dynamics.
01:04:07.830 - 01:04:47.938, Speaker B: Of a virtual world, certainly, and it definitely is reflective of the last two years of nfts. But we have to remember that NFTs are just a token standard. It's the people that choose to manifest those NFts in a particular way. So it's the people that are creating scarcity and exclusion, and that is definitely a downstream byproduct of a bull market mania where prices go up. Nfts do not have scarcity and inclusion built into them. At the protocol level, yeah, only one person can own a token, but we can still mint infinite nfts. And so there are plenty of ways where NFTs can be consistent with the values of minecraft.
01:04:47.938 - 01:05:07.918, Speaker B: You would just have to build it that way. And right now nfts have this branding of scarcity and exclusion. So it's really just going to take some more open minded game to really have success with integrating nfts to really change the minds of people, because people are just scarred. Like the external world is just scarred of the NFT mania of 2021.
01:05:08.084 - 01:05:30.050, Speaker A: I'm kind of interested in digging into this deeper philosophy of like, is digital scarcity a good thing? Right? I think there could be some people who say, no, this is contrary to open source values and technology, where everything is free and everything is shareable, and we want a world in our digital landscape where everything is kind of equal. We don't have the haves and the have nots.
01:05:30.210 - 01:05:34.886, Speaker B: You can just give nfts out to everyone. You can build it, you can do.
01:05:34.908 - 01:05:56.522, Speaker A: Whatever you want it at first, but then it converges into basically people who are really good at the property game. They add to their virtual property, they become kind of entrepreneurs, they trade up, they leverage through their maybe meritocratic efforts. They actually become better at the whole game of capitalism.
01:05:56.666 - 01:06:04.238, Speaker B: And there does so what, Minecraft is just like communism in a game. No one owns anything. Everyone is for everything.
01:06:04.324 - 01:06:40.806, Speaker A: Yes, this is kind of what I'm getting at. And I do think that there's going to be this dichotomy between people who start saying, no, private property ownership or the concept of ownership is not a good thing on the Internet. And maybe Minecraft is taking that stance anyway, deeper philosophical conversation we don't have time to get into. But this person makes the point. Minecraft completely rejecting nfts and what they represent is a big deal. Minecraft is the most successful video game in virtual world in history and was a big target for NFT racketeering. Minecraft has decided NFTs have no place in its future.
01:06:40.806 - 01:07:04.290, Speaker A: Here's another tweet. Somebody who built like NFT worlds, I think on top of Minecraft, like kind of an NFT mod extension on, you know, rest in peace, it's no longer going to work. They're banning that completely. So it does set the precedent for the entire virtual world gaming community. If Minecraft is taking this stance of now, we don't want private property in our games, right?
01:07:04.360 - 01:07:12.950, Speaker B: Well, I mean, eventually they will come around because that's where incentives lie. It's just up to us to not be degenerates with our nfTs.
01:07:13.850 - 01:07:17.894, Speaker A: Why don't you breeze over this, David? But notice, top five on Opensea. Yeah.
01:07:17.932 - 01:07:29.674, Speaker B: So a while ago I got very emotional about the Nickelodeon NFTs that were coming out because they're going to eventually release a SpongeBob NFT and I'm going to buy it and none of you will because I'm going to buy it.
01:07:29.792 - 01:07:30.650, Speaker A: No matter the price.
01:07:30.720 - 01:07:31.610, Speaker B: No matter the price.
01:07:31.680 - 01:07:32.794, Speaker A: Take all of David's Eth.
01:07:32.842 - 01:07:53.298, Speaker B: Yeah, take it all. Every single one. But that SpongeBob NfT is not out, but the rugrats and hey, Arnold, NFTs are out. And so there was 342 eth worth of volume in 24 hours on these Nickelodeon NFTs. These are actual real Nickelodeon IP NFTs issued by Nickelodeon. So cool.
01:07:53.464 - 01:08:03.014, Speaker A: Brings out the, like what SpongeBob character is your thing? Would you buy actual SpongeBob, squidward or someone else?
01:08:03.052 - 01:08:03.494, Speaker B: Question.
01:08:03.612 - 01:08:05.350, Speaker A: Well, you got to think hard about this, man.
01:08:05.420 - 01:08:08.310, Speaker B: Yeah, I could get a Gary.
01:08:08.890 - 01:08:09.682, Speaker A: Get a Gary.
01:08:09.746 - 01:08:11.738, Speaker B: I could get a Gary. Yeah, there you go.
01:08:11.824 - 01:08:13.690, Speaker A: David's buying the gary. Don't front run him.
01:08:13.760 - 01:08:14.426, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:08:14.608 - 01:08:17.850, Speaker A: All right. What's happening here in ETH world?
01:08:17.920 - 01:08:28.478, Speaker B: Amazon EtH has a 1 million USDC bid for it. It has not been accepted. That bid expired. So no deal. No deal.
01:08:28.644 - 01:08:32.302, Speaker A: But some other NFts are going strong. God eth. What's this?
01:08:32.356 - 01:08:50.614, Speaker B: Well, yeah, this also was, I don't think was accepted. But somebody put 700 eth bid on God eth. I don't know if that was accepted or not. Jesus Eth. Was it up for sale for 1000 e? I would not value it that much.
01:08:50.812 - 01:08:56.358, Speaker A: I think that's too high. Sorry, eths are getting a little silly right now. Is that what it feels like to.
01:08:56.364 - 01:09:15.082, Speaker B: You a little bit, but what's the story? I mean, God Eth, that's a gem. That's a gem. Yeah. How can you hate that? Yeah, there's a fun, quick little story. People are also minting sentences as their ens name. They're probably not using it. It's more of like a meme.
01:09:15.082 - 01:09:51.078, Speaker B: So somebody minted, stop doing fake bids. It's honestly lame, myguy eth, because people were putting a fake bids onto their NFT, and then that person put a 100 ETH offer on it. Or somebody put a 100 ETH offer on it as a fake bid. Right? But then that person sold their NFT for 1.8 ETH, which was a real bid, but then they forgot to cancel the 100 eth bid that the offer that they put on. And so the new buyer bought it for 1.8 e and then accepted the 100 ETH bid.
01:09:51.078 - 01:10:02.518, Speaker B: And so the person got their original ens name back, but then they lost 100 ETH because they forgot to cancel their 100 ETH offer. Wow, that's a big oof.
01:10:02.694 - 01:10:47.098, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a 98 e loss there for just fooling around with being funny. Do you know one of the stories this week as well was the Tesla balance sheet. It basically discarded a whole bunch of the bitcoin that they had been holding. Do you remember when this started happening, when there was big news in the crypto community that Elon and Tesla were buying bitcoin? Well, apparently they sold 75% of their bitcoin at an average price of 28k, almost 29k, which is nearly a 9% discount from their average entry of 31k. They did not have the conviction to hold the dip, David. Look, they just bought, like, it went down 10% from their purchase price. And they were like, oh, panic got to sell.
01:10:47.098 - 01:10:48.006, Speaker A: And they sold.
01:10:48.118 - 01:10:49.594, Speaker B: We want off no more.
01:10:49.632 - 01:11:08.530, Speaker A: Yeah, we want off this ride. But what's crazy about that? So, of course, one narrative is, do you remember when the popular narrative is probably a year ago, is like, all of the companies, all the Fortune 500s were going to start buying bitcoin for their balance sheet, right? That really didn't happen.
01:11:08.600 - 01:11:10.958, Speaker B: Not really. It was just sailor.
01:11:11.134 - 01:11:23.302, Speaker A: Yeah, it was pretty much just sailor. A few others and even Tesla, when they got in, they just sold. And so there's that piece of it. But there's also this point, David, that Calio makes, right?
01:11:23.356 - 01:11:55.886, Speaker B: So Kalio says on Twitter, also, elon basically liquidated three years capital because this happened a while ago. This wasn't, like, in the last week or so. The news of this came out because of like a quarterly filings or something from Tesla. But the price at which they sold their bitcoin at $28.8 thousand was like right before the big leg down for bitcoin, between $29,000 and where it bottomed out at one $800. And so the meme is that Tesla sold about 75% of their bitcoin, causing the price to go down, which caused three O's capital to get liquidated.
01:11:56.078 - 01:12:03.538, Speaker A: That's crazy. I don't know. Ironic. Very strange. I mean, I'll never cease to be surprised in crypto. What's going on?
01:12:03.624 - 01:12:14.614, Speaker B: Coming up next, we got a new token. Here's that bridge token that I promised across protocol. They tweet out when Alpha. Now is the alpha. The first stage of the across token launch is live.
01:12:14.652 - 01:12:14.950, Speaker A: Today.
01:12:15.020 - 01:12:56.846, Speaker B: They're launching an across referral link program. And there is a bunch of, it's like a referral program, like you get your own link and then you send people, and if they send people there, and if they use your link to go across the across bridge, you get ACX tokens as a function of how much fees that you paid for the protocol. I think if you pay like one dollars in fees, you get like $0.80 worth of a token. Seems a little gameable, Ryan. So I'm a little bit concerned about that, but I'm sure that they know this. I just saw heart Lambert of Uma, which is the team behind across earlier yesterday.
01:12:56.846 - 01:13:14.442, Speaker B: So here are the tiers. I don't know what this rate is. Maybe 40% of the fees. I think we got copper, bronze, silver, gold, premium copper. You get a 40% rate by just like creating the link. Bronze, 50% rate. If three unique referral transfers or $50,000 in volume, then that scales up to platinum at the very top.
01:13:14.442 - 01:13:23.100, Speaker B: 80% return rate, 20 unique referral transfers or volume. Damn, we should have our link. Our referral link.
01:13:24.210 - 01:13:52.898, Speaker A: We got to create that good opportunity there. And innovative ways to earn tokens. I think this cycle, this is kind of the way airdrops are moving, is you have to do some things to earn your airdrops in the future. Only raised this week is this one. NFT fraud fighters optic. They raised an $11 million seed funding round. This seems to be a way to authenticate basically the authenticity of an NFT copy.
01:13:52.898 - 01:14:08.330, Speaker A: Mints apparently are an ongoing problem in the NFT space and community, and so they're using some AI technology to identify the copycats and I guess authenticate and whitelist the good nfts and the pure ones. So interesting raise there.
01:14:08.400 - 01:14:09.930, Speaker B: That seems straightforward.
01:14:10.350 - 01:14:17.870, Speaker A: Yeah. Getting into jobs. David, crypto is still hiring, as you say, it's specifically the smaller companies this time around. Should I read out a few?
01:14:17.940 - 01:14:18.990, Speaker B: Yeah, let's do it.
01:14:19.140 - 01:14:40.994, Speaker A: This is your reminder to get a job in crypto. Now is opportunity. Bear market can be completely ignored because the job market is hopping streams is hiring a financial analyst. Steakfish is a smart contract software engineer. Steakfish again, a back end full stack software engineer. Also a blockchain marketer, non technical. A front end software engineer.
01:14:40.994 - 01:14:56.266, Speaker A: A DevOps engineer. Ethereum foundation here hiring a front end engineer. Uniswap Labs is hiring. Are you generous? Is hiring. Chainlink Labs. Whole bunch of companies and projects hiring right now. You can go check out that list at thebankless palette.com
01:14:56.266 - 01:14:58.730, Speaker A: board. Also sign up for that.
01:14:58.880 - 01:15:02.140, Speaker B: David, the worst dancing that I've ever done. What's coming?
01:15:02.750 - 01:15:09.150, Speaker A: You're in Paris, it's like in the 90s. You're tired. You've been going all day. What time is it for you?
01:15:09.300 - 01:15:11.582, Speaker B: It is. Oh, yeah, 630.
01:15:11.716 - 01:15:14.826, Speaker A: I saw the ravi on your calendar, too. Are you still going to hit that tonight?
01:15:14.858 - 01:15:18.698, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. After this, taking a nap, going and getting dinner and going to the Ravi.
01:15:18.794 - 01:15:23.854, Speaker A: Yeah, make that a long nap, man, because you got to catch up. You got to catch up a little bit. What's coming up next, though?
01:15:23.972 - 01:15:43.094, Speaker B: Questions of the week. We got a couple questions of the week, two of them. We'll talk about it. I believe it's a question about rocket pool and then also fraud proofs and the ASiCs that are eventually going to come with fraud proofs. We're going to talk about that and also some hot spicy takes. Ryan, I'm fighting with this bitcoiner. I'm trying to fight him and get him on the show and then fight him there.
01:15:43.094 - 01:16:22.242, Speaker B: Well, I don't think that's going to be a take of the week, so I guess I'll just say that. But that's all coming up next, right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Arbitram is an ethereum layer two scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use DFI and nfTs. Some of the coolest new NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home, while DFI protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage. You can now bridge straight into arbitram from more than ten different exchanges, including finance, FTX, Huobi and crypto.com. Once on Arbitrum, you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees, allowing you to explore new frontiers of the crypto universe. New to Arbitrum for a limited time, you can get arbitram nfts, designed by the famous artists Ratwell and Sugoy for joining the Arbitrum Odyssey.
01:16:22.242 - 01:17:05.934, Speaker B: The Odyssey is an eight week long event where you complete on chain activities and receive a free NFT as a reward. Find out more by visiting the discord at Discord GG Arbitrum. You can also bridge your assets to arbitram at Bridge Arbitram IO and access all of Arbitrum's apps at Portal Arbitram one in order to experience defi and nfts the way it was always meant to be. Fast, cheap, secure, and fiction free, Rocketpool is your friendly, decentralized Ethereum staking protocol. You can stake your ETH with rocket pool and get our ETH in return, allowing you to stake your ETH and use it in DFI at the same time. You can get 4% on your Eth by staking it with rocket pool, but you can get even more by running a node. Rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes.
01:17:05.934 - 01:17:33.482, Speaker B: Running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node, and you only need 16 eth to get started. Why would you do this? You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled e, so your API is boosted. So if you're bullish east staking, you can increase your API and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network, which currently has over 1000 independent validators. It's yield farming, but with Ethereum nodes you can get started@rocketpool.net and also join the Rocketpool community in their discord. You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there.
01:17:33.616 - 01:18:00.710, Speaker A: All right guys, we are back, starting with the questions for David and myself in the weekly roll up. Just a reminder, if you have a question, go follow bankless hq on Twitter and we are tweeting out. We're asking you for questions once a week and you can respond to that tweet thread and get your question in. This is the first one from top. In the past you have mentioned that bankless spun up x amount of mini pools via rocket pool. It's true. We are staking via rocket pool right now.
01:18:00.710 - 01:18:14.774, Speaker A: What are the benefits of having multi mini pools versus a full node? I think people are asking these questions because they're getting excited about staking, David, but what are the benefits of a multi mini pool versus a full node in the rocket pool ecosystem?
01:18:14.902 - 01:18:48.158, Speaker B: I love this question. This is basically the why rocket pool? Question. Okay, so why rocket pool? In rocket pool, a node operator, the normal node operator is 32 eTH on a node that you run, and then you just stake your eth and run the node. And that's what you do with rocket pool. You spin up a rocket pool node, which basically is a node that is also part of the rocket pool network. Instead of putting in 32 etH, you put in 16 eth, and then you allow other people to come and fill up the rest of the node. And so you put in 16 as your half of the bond.
01:18:48.158 - 01:19:29.230, Speaker B: And then other people can, like, somebody puts in one, somebody puts in three, somebody puts in four, and then boom, you have 32 eth, and you've let other people stake their eth using your node, but you put in 16 eth because that's like the bond that you need to have in order to not be malicious. You're not going to do anything crazy because you have your own ETh in there. What are the benefits of doing that? Well, first, I mean, we can just talk about the altruist part of it is like, you allow other people to stake their ETH, which is nice, good job. Good for you. But there's also the profit side of it. And we all know humans like profit. And so in addition to getting the ether yield, you as a rocket pool node operator also get 15% of the staking commission of the other half of the yield.
01:19:29.230 - 01:20:10.800, Speaker B: So if there's like a 7% eth yield, which is about expected post merge, you get 15% of that, 7% of the 16 eth that is in the other half of your rocket pool node. So you get a boost in your ETh Apy. You also don't need 32 eTh, you only need 16 ETH to get that started. But in addition to that, you also get RPL issuance. And so if you run a rocket pool node, you get RPL distributions because you also need RPL as a bond to also bond that to your rocket pool node to make sure this thing is super secure. So you get more eth yield. By running your node with rocket pool, you also get RPL token emissions as well.
01:20:11.570 - 01:20:17.962, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly right, David, well said. That's why we're running some nodes, and it's going pretty well so far. Very exciting.
01:20:18.026 - 01:20:21.154, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we've tested three blocks so far. We're up to three.
01:20:21.192 - 01:20:23.954, Speaker A: Three blocks. That's not bad for like three weeks. Four weeks we've been.
01:20:23.992 - 01:20:34.120, Speaker B: Yeah. So if anyone pays attention to the graffiti on the beacon chain, you'll know it when you get a block, because our graffiti is bankless. Was here at some point.
01:20:35.210 - 01:20:53.402, Speaker A: Next question. This is a question from incognito. Are ZK rollups just like proof of work, especially in terms of energy consumption? Good question. We've been talking about ZK rollups the entire time. I mean, from here. And he includes a link. It says off chain transactions are being bundled and generate cryptographic proofs.
01:20:53.402 - 01:21:18.534, Speaker A: Not really sure. But isn't this just like proof of work and needs much energy? So the question of some sequencers are required, some a tech stack is required, and asics are essentially required to run ZK roll ups. Right. And the question is, are these going to be as energy intensive as proof of work? And so have we just shifted the problem to roll ups and now it's a ZK problem? What's your answer to that question?
01:21:18.652 - 01:22:01.986, Speaker B: Yeah, the very simple answer is that proof of work is a race, and so you are incentivized to consume as much electricity as possible because you need to be first with ZK rollups. ZK rollups also can benefit from asics to make their proof generation faster, just like a proof of work runs on asics. But it's about the economic model, where with a ZK roll up, you don't need to be first to generate that proof. You just need to generate the proof. And you don't really get, there's no reward for doing it, you just need to run the proof. So one ASIC can support an entire ZK roll up, for example. And so we don't need warehouses and warehouses and warehouses of asics to secure a ZK roll up.
01:22:01.986 - 01:22:22.378, Speaker B: You just need to generate the proof. And so because there's only one machine doing that, or a few machines, like, no, absolutely not, we will definitely not get anywhere near the level of electricity consumption. It's basically zero. There is basically zero energy consumption to generate a proof. It's like running a program on your laptop. It's not that hard.
01:22:22.544 - 01:22:27.434, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah. Proof of work is pretty unique in its energy consumption profile, I'd say.
01:22:27.632 - 01:22:56.786, Speaker B: All right, last question of the week. Mag 80 ETH says polygon is killing it. But do develops like the ZKE EVM benefit the ETH token? Or do these developments benefit or increase the value of just the Matic token? Do you think there are any merits to seeing polygon as a competitor to Ethereum. So yeah, this is the classic alignment question. Are roll ups aligned with the layer one? And the answer isn't holistically, absolutely yes, because it is actually a different blockchain. It is not Ethereum itself. Therefore it has a different level of alignment.
01:22:56.786 - 01:23:19.142, Speaker B: Now is that alignment like misaligned or aligned? It's a spectrum. You can be highly, highly aligned with Ethereum. I would put optimism in this camp. They were going after EVM equivalents very early. And EVM equivalents is, I would say strong, strong Ethereum alignment. In addition to that, they don't use the op token as their own native currency token. They use EtH.
01:23:19.142 - 01:23:55.138, Speaker B: So that is strong ethereum alignment. So I would say optimism is highly, highly aligned with Ethereum, not just at the protocol level, but also in the philosophy and values level. On the very other side of the spectrum, I might put something like the starkware ecosystem and starknet, where they announced their token is a native payment token rather than ETh for the starknet. And they also have layer threes on top of the layer two. They also have their own coding language. And culturally I wouldn't compare them to sharing the same values of Ethereum, at least not as much as I would with optimism. So there's a spectrum here of alignment.
01:23:55.138 - 01:24:28.834, Speaker B: So polygon killing it. But do the benefits benefit or increase the value of ether or just matic? It's both. There is a little bit of a misalignment, but that is just the bargain that you make when you produce a different blockchain. You have to optimize for something different. You are not the Ethereum layer one. But I would definitely say absolutely all things on all layer twos that settle on the Ethereum layer one always ultimately benefit Ethereum. The mere concept of just buying block space and using ether to do that and burning ether is like the minimum level of alignment required to have a mutually aligned system.
01:24:28.834 - 01:24:30.530, Speaker B: And so the answer is both.
01:24:30.680 - 01:24:50.182, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think across that spectrum, as you said, they outsource monetary supremacy differently to Ethereum. Right. Arbitram. Optimism. They use ETh completely with polygon. They're using ETH as the gas token and they're using matic for staking and with starquare, as you mentioned.
01:24:50.236 - 01:24:52.406, Speaker B: Wait, no, matic is. Matic is the gas token.
01:24:52.598 - 01:24:57.350, Speaker A: No, it's not. Not for the ZK. EVM.
01:24:57.430 - 01:24:58.730, Speaker B: Oh yeah, for the ZK.
01:25:00.910 - 01:25:43.142, Speaker A: Just mentioned this and kind of confirmed it because people were asking questions about that and then Starknet, as you said, that's going to be completely using its own token. And this kind of reminds me, if you know how we use the. I'm just obsessed with this analogy of like, federal government versus states. I just love this. Like, if you, if you look at kind of the early United States, do you know, many individual states had their own currencies. And that actually stopped when the constitution started being enforced, was written and put into law, into practice. Because in article one of the constitution, it says Congress gets the power to coin money and regulate the value of foreign coin.
01:25:43.142 - 01:26:04.702, Speaker A: And it also says no state gets the ability to coin money. So that was embedded in Congress, in the constitution, on ethereum. That is not embedded in the Ethereum constitution. So if you are a roll up, if you're a consumer of ethereum block space, there is no protocol mandate that you must use the ether token. So it's a bit of a different.
01:26:04.756 - 01:26:11.250, Speaker B: Setup on the layer two. It does mandate it on the layer one. So you do have to use the currency at the layer one.
01:26:11.320 - 01:27:05.220, Speaker A: That is completely true. And so on the layer one, to your point, if any blockchain is a roll up and they are paying for ethereum block space, they are a net consumer of ethereum block space, then they are net accretive to ether. And some of these States might want to preserve their own currencies as well. So they might use ether plus their own currency. There is a world maybe where one of these states become large enough that they decide to fork off from the union entirely, right? So Texas, okay, they become so large, your economy is so great, they start to say we're better off without just ethereum, and we want to kind of launch our own chain as a layer one and fork off and leave ethereum. We'll still have treaties with them and alliance, but we won't have the monetary union that we. And that is possible.
01:27:05.220 - 01:27:30.294, Speaker A: So I think we'll see lots of different outcomes. And I guess the bottom line is none of these roll ups are positioned in a way that make them a layer one settlement for other roll ups and for foreign governments for other roll ups. We'll have to see how that changes in the future. But each of them are taking a different approach. Anyway, that's, that takes the week, David.
01:27:30.342 - 01:27:31.674, Speaker B: Onto the takes. Let's do it.
01:27:31.712 - 01:27:35.294, Speaker A: We got one from Blockfi. This is Ryan Selkis. What is he saying?
01:27:35.412 - 01:27:56.854, Speaker B: Yeah, so Ryan Selkis says the path taken by Blockfi and Celsius leadership teams this past month are as divergent as it gets. I don't really know what he meant by that. So I asked him if he could elaborate. And Ryan Selkis continues saying Celsius fought to the last minute to save themselves and they put user funds at risk. Blockfi fire sold to a bidder that would protect user funds at all costs. Thank you, blockfi. Nice job.
01:27:56.854 - 01:27:58.760, Speaker B: Also, Celsius F off.
01:27:59.610 - 01:28:00.854, Speaker A: You did a better job.
01:28:00.972 - 01:28:02.418, Speaker B: Use another spectrum, David.
01:28:02.514 - 01:28:08.782, Speaker A: There's so many spectrums here, right? Like both careless with risk management, but Celsius was just far more careless.
01:28:08.866 - 01:28:10.890, Speaker B: It was just ludicrous.
01:28:11.310 - 01:28:28.250, Speaker A: Terrible. They were blockfi. They made some mistakes, but still preserved. And then other crypto banks are even healthier. People are talking this week about Coinbase bankruptcy again, and I don't see that at all. That is not in the card. That would be a massive surprise.
01:28:28.250 - 01:28:35.840, Speaker A: Coinbase did not loan through us capital any money anyway. So different crypto banks played this very differently, had different risk management in effect.
01:28:36.690 - 01:28:51.538, Speaker B: Ryan. Ryan Tron Adams tweets out, you have to realize that blockchains have two social layer. Two layers. The tech layer, the layer one, the social layer, the layer zero. Also, the name of my podcast on layer zero, the code is memes. Brains are the validators. Shared belief is the consensus.
01:28:51.538 - 01:29:05.834, Speaker B: The social layer matters even more than the tech, but they interact in a perpetual feedback loop. Ryan, I feel like very few people or very few communities outside of Ethereum understand this. I think the bitcoiner ecosystem understands this.
01:29:06.032 - 01:29:31.026, Speaker A: I think that's so true. And I think that is the single most unappreciated part of the crypto story and blockchain story of the value of the social layer. Right? So the social layer does have code. It's in narrative form. It's in meme form, it's articles, okay? It's podcasts. We are forming the social layer now on bankless as we speak. This is part of it.
01:29:31.026 - 01:30:09.790, Speaker A: It's very important. Brains are the validators. So everyone's individual brain, their belief, their orientation on something, has the ability to accept what an article is saying, what a meme is saying, what a narrative is saying, what a podcast host is saying as true or false. They're checking it. Their brain is kind of the fact finder. And then shared belief becomes kind of the consensus of the layer zero chain, right? And ultimately, David, that's what all of the technology rests on. And there's also this feedback loop between the layer one and the social layer, in that some social layers attract.
01:30:09.790 - 01:30:48.710, Speaker A: Well, some tech layers attract different types of social layers due to the choices that they've made. And you could kind of, I think the anthropology of these systems is probably the most fascinating part. The economics is super fascinating. The technology is super fascinating. But the culture of these layer zero ecosystems of ethereum versus bitcoin versus solana versus some other chain, that is the most fascinating part for me. And it shows you that this is a coordination technology and a social technology. And I think almost no one is looking at blockchain deeply through this lens.
01:30:48.710 - 01:30:58.126, Speaker A: People like Josh Rosenthal are on our podcast, a few others are doing it. But is the most interesting way to look at crypto technology. And the whole thing that's happening in.
01:30:58.148 - 01:31:39.926, Speaker B: Crypto and the big lessons I like to pull from this is like it was something that was really interesting is Danny Sesta from Wonderland becomes super egotistical, very populous tactics, and then goes after maker Dow and says, oh, we're going to be better than maker Dow and make the next stablecoin. And then we get in a fight with him because I didn't know who he was. I get attacked by his fraud community. And then Danny Sessa and his icarusing blew up like a month later because of the whole Wonderland drama. Fast forward about two months, I get in a fight with Doe Kwan on Twitter. Doe Kwan says, buy my hand, die. The stablecoin from Makerdao will die.
01:31:39.926 - 01:32:26.250, Speaker B: And then I get in a fight with him, and then we become enemies, I guess. And then he gets super egotistical and self centered and just pumping and shilling and telling you, Ryan, that you don't know anything about blockchain, and then just becoming crazy and then blows up about a month later. So there's this pattern of when the social layer incentivizes this populist maniacs to run a protocol, and then they also happen to go after Makerdao. They blow up. And that's because the code of the layer zero works its way into the tech stack on the layer one or the app chain. And so you have to understand who your leaders are, because the culture that these people surround themselves with interact with certain people and create the actual fundamentals of the actual technology themselves.
01:32:26.400 - 01:33:07.078, Speaker A: Yeah, and the other side of that is true, too. A lot of people looked at the terra design itself from a security model on upwards to the algo stablecoin model, and they said, oh, I'm not touching that. I'm going to build on a different ecosystem. And so the design of the layer one tends to attract a different layer zero people who are just certainly in it for more temporary, not thinking about these things, not thinking about the long term in that way. One of my favorite contrasts, though, is like bitcoin versus ethereum, because we did bring in the. Corey, these are the two long standing communities. What is this clip that we're showing right here?
01:33:07.244 - 01:33:40.194, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is the end of our Luke Gromman podcast, where he basically gives the bitcoiner line that proof of stake represents fiat systems. This is like a fiat system, which just makes no sense. A lot of macro experts, they're knowledgeable in macro. I would put Lin Ald in here. As soon as they start talking about crypto stuff, it kind of breaks down. And so it was conflating governance with proof of stake, like all bitcoiners do. And then Corey Cliftson, who I've actually had on my other podcast, POV crypto Ryan, I hosted him on that show once.
01:33:40.232 - 01:33:41.330, Speaker A: I don't know him at all.
01:33:41.400 - 01:33:50.550, Speaker B: Yeah, he tweets out. Imagine having a show, and every time you finally get a smart guest to come on, they tell you your life's work is meaningless. It's so sad to watch over and over and over.
01:33:50.620 - 01:33:51.638, Speaker A: They're talking about us.
01:33:51.724 - 01:33:53.030, Speaker B: They're talking about bankless.
01:33:54.410 - 01:34:07.958, Speaker A: Because Luke is, to be clear in this clip, he was. No, no, I'm not into crypto. I'm into bitcoin specifically. That is the only crypto. Like, stop talking about other cryptos. My focus and the value here is actually bitcoin.
01:34:08.134 - 01:34:11.802, Speaker B: Corey, let's fight. Let's fight. What do you mean fight?
01:34:11.936 - 01:34:13.690, Speaker A: Come on the show. You want to bring them on the show?
01:34:13.760 - 01:34:16.382, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll host them on the show, and we'll yell at each other.
01:34:16.436 - 01:34:43.766, Speaker A: There you go. So I tweeted this out early in the week because I was feeling a lot of, like, a whole bunch of people piled on and talked about how dumb we are and all sorts of things. Right. Which is pretty typical on Twitter. But the weird thing about going back to the anthropology and the social layer, the layer zero here is you can't apparently, in, like, particularly the bitcoin maximalist community. We got into this with Nick Carter a little bit. You can't be a bitcoiner who likes ethereum at the same.
01:34:43.868 - 01:34:44.998, Speaker B: Right, right.
01:34:45.164 - 01:34:57.626, Speaker A: Apparently. And so I tweeted this out. I'm a bitcoiner who likes ethereum more. Is that, you know, some people, of course, are saying, yes, that's allowed. Your tweet was like, no, you must sacrifice everything. Kind of tongue in cheek here.
01:34:57.728 - 01:35:28.238, Speaker B: Well, take that seriously. Okay. Connecting this to the economic model of bitcoin. Bitcoin is a faith based blockchain. The security budget runs out and so you have to operate on faith that this thing works. And the only way that it works is that if bitcoin literally goes to infinity, and that's the only way of the sustainability of the ecosystem, if bitcoin pumps forever. So you have to have faith that that bitcoin price doesn't go so low that the blockchain becomes unstable.
01:35:28.238 - 01:35:45.194, Speaker B: And so if you are not allowed to believe in any other crypto asset, because you must have the shelling point of, you have to believe in bitcoin. Bitcoin is a faith secured blockchain. As soon as the issuance runs out, it's insecure. And so you have to have faith that it works.
01:35:45.392 - 01:36:05.018, Speaker A: What's interesting is we've emphasized the social layer to being so important. Right. Like, ethereum's social layer is very important to success. It would be maybe a lot less faith based, I would say, but there is some sort of underlying beliefs here. But that's exactly what you're saying is, like, the religious aspect is the thing that's. So. Do you know Dennis Porter?
01:36:05.114 - 01:36:07.614, Speaker B: Yeah, I've also. We hosted him on the show, actually.
01:36:07.652 - 01:36:25.538, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. I don't think I was there for that show. I think it was, like you and Justin. Anyway, so he answered the question from, I think, the bitcoin maximalist position. I'm like, I'm a bitcoiner who likes ethereum more. Is that even allowed? Dennis Porter goes, that's like saying, I'm a Green Bay fan, but I like the bears more. Okay, football reference, right? These are mortal enemies reference.
01:36:25.538 - 01:36:41.146, Speaker A: Okay, so I was like, so it's not allowed, right? And he's like, some people think owning bitcoin is enough, and I wish we all live in that world, but we don't. You'll never be accepted as a bitcoiner until you sell your eth bags, because you've attacked bitcoin so much. Right? And I think they would classify what.
01:36:41.168 - 01:36:45.002, Speaker B: You just said as running out of attack on bitcoin. I just attacked bitcoin?
01:36:45.066 - 01:36:59.154, Speaker A: Yes. That's an attack on bitcoin. It's an attack on the faith, a heretic, basically. It's monetary warfare. And you chose a side that's opposed to bitcoin. I was a little snarky, tongue in cheek. I also own a house.
01:36:59.154 - 01:37:20.326, Speaker A: Do I have to sell that to you, Dennis? He told me I had to sell all my EtH in order to be a bitcoiner. No, Ryan, here's the key. It's not just a back and forth part of this. Is like, I'm just so fascinated by the social dynamics here. And I really feel like we are witnessing the birth of not just a social movement, but almost like techno religions here.
01:37:20.348 - 01:37:30.054, Speaker B: David, blockchains are like omnipotent gods. Every single blockchain, every single layer, one is a God, and there are algos.
01:37:30.102 - 01:37:46.754, Speaker A: Why this crypto is so tribal, algos being religion. So here's what he said. I also own a house. Do I have to sell that, too? Dennis goes, no, Ryan, it has nothing to do with your. Okay, distinction. You and David specifically go after bitcoin. You still have the ultrasound money emojis in your name.
01:37:46.754 - 01:37:54.370, Speaker A: That's the we like ethereum more part. You also challenge the energy use of bitcoin. These are both attacks on bitcoin.
01:37:54.710 - 01:37:58.660, Speaker B: No, they're fair and valid critiques. Right?
01:37:59.770 - 01:38:11.062, Speaker A: They can't accept that I am bullish on bitcoin. I like bitcoin. The number is going to like, I'm a bitcoin. I hold a bitcoin. I own some bitcoin. I just like eth better for many of the reasons we just said. Well, you've gone the other way.
01:38:11.062 - 01:38:38.690, Speaker A: But I'm a bitcoiner if I own bitcoin, right? No, according to Dennis, because you have attacked the faith. And so this is where I think it gets religious. I go, I think all this would be plainer if you guys put out a statement of faith, like the core beliefs of bitcoin. What does it take to be a bitcoiner? Yeah, something simple. And like, the Christians did this in the early days with nicene Creed. Anyway, we go back and forth. I just think the religious parallels here are very interesting.
01:38:38.690 - 01:39:15.674, Speaker A: He goes, that's impossible, Ryan, you know that some of the folks who say holding bitcoin is enough could be right. I've thought deeply about it, but you're making me realize that someone can't attack bitcoin and be a bitcoiner. So Dennis goes, it's impossible to write a statement of faith because that would be, like, more centralizing. I think it can be solved. I think if the bitcoiners wanted to come up with a statement of faith like the maximalists of what it actually takes to be a bitcoin maximalist and say things like, thou shalt not attack bitcoin, I, as a bitcoiner, will not attack bitcoin. Instead, I will support it in all of these ways. And that makes me a bitcoiner.
01:39:15.674 - 01:39:35.438, Speaker A: It would be much more simple, but I'm super interested to see how this evolves over the decades to come, because, David, bitcoin still ain't going anywhere, not with this level of unshakable belief that people have. Even if and when we think it's very likely the flipping happens, whereas ETH is larger market cap. You're not going to shake this community, David.
01:39:35.614 - 01:39:40.038, Speaker B: Look at how strongly they're cyber hornets for a reason.
01:39:40.124 - 01:40:15.982, Speaker A: Well, where does it go, right? It's like, okay, you start to create statements of faith. You start to say, Satoshi being kind of this anonymous person who's faded in the decades to centuries to come, how does this evolve? Right? Is Satoshi like the God who left earth? I don't even know. It gets weird. But I think that we are seeing the birth of a religion, so it's not just an asset class that we're investing in. And people don't understand these social dynamics at play. But that to me, is the lens through which we have to view this space. Anyway, a little bit of trolling with Dennis and some back and forth fun, but honestly, I'm 50%.
01:40:15.982 - 01:40:19.682, Speaker A: It's just pure fascination that this is how people see things.
01:40:19.816 - 01:40:41.820, Speaker B: Well, this is kind of like why I'm generally bearish on bitcoin in the long term is that the culture around bitcoin is that bitcoin has no flaws. Its current state is absolutely perfect. Immaculate. Immaculate conception of bitcoin. This was perfect from day one, and therefore we don't need to improve it. And I'm like, yeah, bitcoin's got some flaws. It's not perfect, guys, you got to fix some stuff.
01:40:41.820 - 01:40:50.694, Speaker B: You can secure a blockchain without proof of work, and no, proof of work is not the most fair consensus mechanism. It's actually highly centralizing. Goddamn.
01:40:50.822 - 01:41:10.306, Speaker A: Yep, there we go. Back to that. Let's see. Last thing is your take here. David Hoffson says, born too late to explore the globe, born too early to venture into space, but born at the perfect time to watch eth become the greatest asset the world's ever seen. That's a pure pump tweet, David. I feel like I've read something like that before.
01:41:10.488 - 01:41:17.502, Speaker B: Yeah, can you retweet that? I'm trying to get more likes in Sazzle so I have the canonical most liked version of this copy.
01:41:17.566 - 01:41:19.170, Speaker A: You already won. You already won?
01:41:19.240 - 01:41:27.138, Speaker B: No. Okay, that's what I said. But then he got another one because he's tweeted out three times or whatever, that one that has like 900 likes. So I need to get 100 more likes.
01:41:27.234 - 01:41:30.970, Speaker A: These are the tweets that perform all right, work on that for you.
01:41:31.120 - 01:41:55.966, Speaker B: What, are you bullish on this? Yeah. Right. The frontier used to be in the era of the 17 hundreds, 16 hundreds of gold, God and glory. Right. God themed episode today of, like, getting on the ship and exploring the frontier of Earth. But it's also too late to explore the final frontier of space. But at least we get to Ryan, explore the crypto economic frontier of Ethereum.
01:41:56.158 - 01:42:03.940, Speaker A: I'm totally with you. I think that's the most exciting white space available for people. All right, what are you excited about this week? Tell me.
01:42:04.310 - 01:42:41.354, Speaker B: I've teased it out a little bit, but I've done eight interviews between 20 and 30 minutes each, all at ECC. And I'm just like, really leaning into the in person interviews. I really, really like these, but also just like the state of bankless. I feel like we get to ask cooler questions and so give me some highlights. I asked the starkware people as to whether they will ever fork off of Ethereum and settle on a different chain or whether they will just make their own layer one. I am, of course, not leaking the answer at. I remember when Kane, Warwick and Suzu got in a fight on reasonable size houses on crypto Twitter.
01:42:41.354 - 01:42:45.810, Speaker B: Well, I talk about him with that, asking all the fun stuff, and it's kind of cool.
01:42:45.960 - 01:42:49.426, Speaker A: I heard there's something about Vitalik as.
01:42:49.608 - 01:43:02.514, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, well, he's the number one. Yeah. I asked Vitalik about the general morale of the Ethereum developers and how that's tracked over time. Yeah. Some questions that I don't really think anyone could really ask. So I'll run through it. We got Vitalik.
01:43:02.514 - 01:43:13.754, Speaker B: We got Stannie from Ave. Kane from synthetics. We got Kevin Owaki and Austin Griffith as a duo. That was fun. That was super comical. Evan McMullen from disco. I'm definitely going to miss some people.
01:43:13.754 - 01:43:26.510, Speaker B: Mahalo from Polygon. We did Sonny from Cosmos. I'm also getting super interested in Cosmos. Actually got super interested in Cosmos back in 2018 when I first learned about it and then just got sucked into Ethereum.
01:43:27.010 - 01:43:29.454, Speaker A: This is like a taste of ECC, though, right?
01:43:29.492 - 01:43:43.890, Speaker B: This is like an ECC experience, but also just like sub micro podcasts. Because I asked Sonny about Cosmos. Right? I asked Evan about decentralized data. And so in addition to, all right, house Paris, it's also like, okay, let's talk about what you're up to.
01:43:43.960 - 01:43:49.206, Speaker A: All right, so this is the eth CC experience episode, I guess at least that's what it'll be for me. And when does that come out?
01:43:49.228 - 01:44:05.142, Speaker B: David that's going to premiere 11:00 a.m. Pacific time, 02:00 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday. So I just threw all of these very high def 1080p local microphones. Audio quality should be great. It's coming out on your YouTube this coming Tuesday, so stay tuned.
01:44:05.206 - 01:44:12.182, Speaker A: And also Spotify video podcast, also video on Spotify. So go check that out. Cheers.
01:44:12.246 - 01:44:13.626, Speaker B: Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:44:13.808 - 01:44:20.686, Speaker A: David? I got to say it, man. I'm so thankful you didn't steal mine because you're at ECC. I'm bullish on the merge, my friend. We have a date.
01:44:20.788 - 01:44:24.554, Speaker B: We're all bullish on the merge. That's the entire market section of this podcast, Ryan.
01:44:24.602 - 01:44:32.126, Speaker A: All right, that's the next few weeks, like the next two months, I'm going to be bullish on the merge. Maybe the rest of the year. I'm bullish on the merge.
01:44:32.158 - 01:44:36.340, Speaker B: Okay. I just don't need to ask you this anymore. We'll just over and over.
01:44:37.110 - 01:44:53.450, Speaker A: So it's so exciting. I mean, this has been such a long time coming, but the timing is what strikes me, and I tweeted this out. Ethereum is about to become the world's only deflationary monetary asset at a time of historic monetary inflation. What a contrast. What a contrast.
01:44:54.350 - 01:44:55.834, Speaker B: I'm jealous that you tweeted that out. That was.
01:44:55.872 - 01:44:59.754, Speaker A: Look, man, that's like, maybe I stole this from Anthony Sassano back in the day.
01:44:59.792 - 01:45:02.954, Speaker B: No, I said this first. No, this is unique. I was the one making this connection.
01:45:03.002 - 01:45:39.282, Speaker A: The Internet bond is the connection to make here. Right? Which is like ETH as an asset is becoming like a sovereign bond, essentially. And so you can buy japanese bonds, you can buy us treasuries, you can buy euro bonds. But why would you when you know you're going to be the sucker on the other end of that table and it's all going to be inflated away and your real returns on those assets will be negative. Well, guess what? Your real returns on ETH as a bond will not be negative. You know how we know this is because it's a deflationary asset as ETH.
01:45:39.346 - 01:45:40.794, Speaker B: Or it's about to is used, as.
01:45:40.832 - 01:45:59.502, Speaker A: Block space is used, it gets burnt. A portion of ETH gets burnt. So the supply goes down. Even now in these low gas fee economic times, we're still burning like 0.2% ETH per year. As if you go to ultrasound money, you can go see that. So a deflationary asset, that's what's coming.
01:45:59.502 - 01:46:10.578, Speaker A: I'm really excited about this. We've been talking about ultrasound money for like over a year. I think that episode Justin Drake came out probably July of last year.
01:46:10.744 - 01:46:11.858, Speaker B: No, it might have been earlier than that.
01:46:11.864 - 01:46:34.806, Speaker A: 15 or 16 months ago, right. Over a year ago. And now we're finally here, we're about to get into ultrasound money, and I'm very excited about the economic benefits not going to scale eth yet. That comes later. All the ZK stuff we've been talking about, that's a scalability strategy. But this is a massive economic upgrade. Not to mention we get all the benefits of proof of work going away and environmental narrative.
01:46:34.806 - 01:46:35.638, Speaker A: All of these attacks.
01:46:35.654 - 01:46:36.700, Speaker B: Bitcoin again.
01:46:37.070 - 01:46:42.054, Speaker A: I taxed bitcoin again at the end. Apparently I'm not a bitcoiner. I do not subscribe.
01:46:42.102 - 01:47:00.526, Speaker B: I'm looking. It's going to be really sad when there's a couple of roll ups ago I had that tweet is like, how to become a millionaire. Stick around during the bear market. Well, it's going to hit different when we're all millionaires because the dollar got turned into. Got turned into nothing. And so one ether is a million dollars because a dollar is a penny.
01:47:00.558 - 01:47:07.826, Speaker A: Now, like, not like this, but not like this. Please, God. All right, meme of the week. What do we got this week?
01:47:07.848 - 01:47:23.114, Speaker B: Meme of the week, song of Day Man, Jonathan Mann, who I've also had on the podcast. I've had goddamn everyone at the podcast at this point. He did a song with our job section, so he made a song about getting a job in crypto. And that is going to come up right after Ryan gives us the regular disclaimers that we usually do.
01:47:23.232 - 01:47:38.126, Speaker A: Guys, if that doesn't pump you to get a job in crypto, then nothing will. Enjoy this song from the song of day man. Of course. Before we get there, though, I have to say, wrestling disclaimers, crypto is risky. ETH and bitcoin are absolutely risky. You could lose what you put.
01:47:38.148 - 01:47:40.154, Speaker B: You just said bitcoin's risky. That's an attack on bitcoin.
01:47:40.202 - 01:47:45.194, Speaker A: I just attacked bitcoin there. But I also attacked Ether in the same sentence. But we are headed west.
01:47:45.242 - 01:47:48.366, Speaker B: Yeah, well, at least ethereum isn't insecure and can take criticism.
01:47:48.478 - 01:47:59.014, Speaker A: Stop this. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot. Get a job in crypto. Don't wait to it.
01:47:59.014 - 01:48:02.070, Speaker A: Now I get a job in crypto.
01:48:02.410 - 01:48:06.550, Speaker B: These boys say how get a job in crypto.
01:48:19.890 - 01:48:30.490, Speaker A: Non technical. Technical, technical, technical, technical.
