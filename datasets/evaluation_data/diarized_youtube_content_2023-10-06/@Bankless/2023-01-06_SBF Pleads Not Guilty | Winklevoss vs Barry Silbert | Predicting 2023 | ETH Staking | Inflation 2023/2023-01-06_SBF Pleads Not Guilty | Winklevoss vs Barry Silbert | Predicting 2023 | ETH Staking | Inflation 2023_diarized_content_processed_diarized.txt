00:00:00.170 - 00:00:05.200, Speaker A: SBS pleads not guilty. Bold strategy. We'll see how that plays out.
00:00:07.490 - 00:00:13.470, Speaker B: Bankless Nation. Welcome to the first roll up of 2023. David, you ready for this?
00:00:13.540 - 00:00:20.094, Speaker A: 52 more weekly roll ups to go in 2023. How is that intimidating? Ryan, do you think we can do it?
00:00:20.212 - 00:00:37.910, Speaker B: Oh, I think we can do it. I've got the stamina. I'm coming into this year fully energized, actually. Break was really good for me and some time to reflect, and I was feeling kind of burnt out by the end of the year, but no longer. I'm ready for 2023. I'm excited about it. How are your holidays, Dave? Did you get any special Christmas gifts? Anything cool?
00:00:37.980 - 00:00:56.334, Speaker A: We only do stocking stuffers in my family, and I got dry bags, which I think is just great because dry bags are what you or bags you put stuff into when you put into your mountaineering backpack. So you can go walk through snow and rain and not get your stuff wet. So, yeah, your boy is going to be having a dry sleeping bag while he climbs some mountains this year.
00:00:56.372 - 00:00:57.630, Speaker B: Just dry bagging it.
00:00:57.700 - 00:00:59.338, Speaker A: Dry bagging it. Dry bag it's.
00:00:59.354 - 00:00:59.994, Speaker B: Like a disease.
00:01:00.042 - 00:01:03.102, Speaker A: It doesn't sound too it doesn't sound like a sexy present, let me tell you.
00:01:03.156 - 00:01:08.834, Speaker B: No dry bags. But awesome, man. I know you're doing some mountains this year, so that'll come in handy for sure, right?
00:01:08.872 - 00:01:09.122, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:09.176 - 00:01:21.910, Speaker B: I also noticed, by the way, when you're setting up for this episode, that you've got a little portrait behind you that I don't know if people can see. Okay. So maybe our editors can kind of cut this in, or David's going to try a zoom in on the portrait.
00:01:23.770 - 00:01:25.510, Speaker A: It's actually there. Yeah.
00:01:25.660 - 00:02:04.610, Speaker B: But at the top of it is, I think, a memento from 2022. That will be a longtime memento to help us remember that year, which is a picture of you tearing up during a roll up. This is a roll up where we were talking about how bad everything was and all of the scammers in the space, and I think it kind of hit you, and it became a meme. I saw Twitch Streamers talking about this, and somebody normie twitch Streamers? Yeah, somebody turned it into an NFT and like an art piece, and it's just fantastic. Like, crying Crypto bro is probably what mainstream might tag this.
00:02:04.680 - 00:02:19.122, Speaker A: No, that's exactly why it got caught traction in the Gamer twitch sphere. The person that painted this really phenomenal piece of artwork I'm going to zoom in on it again is actually a Hexagon. That was a Hex community member that I bought.
00:02:19.266 - 00:02:24.586, Speaker B: People who aren't familiar, that's just somebody from the Hex community, right? Yes, exactly. That's what they call them.
00:02:24.608 - 00:02:31.934, Speaker A: Hexagons. Yeah. It's like a really good watercolor, and I paid them 100 USDC, and they shipped it to me. Yeah.
00:02:32.052 - 00:02:33.422, Speaker B: That's awesome. I love that.
00:02:33.476 - 00:02:37.998, Speaker A: I also think that so far, that marks the bottom.
00:02:38.164 - 00:02:39.102, Speaker B: That marks the bottom.
00:02:39.156 - 00:02:40.080, Speaker A: That's the bottom.
00:02:41.250 - 00:02:50.766, Speaker B: Okay, well, so part of the topics for this week, guys, we'll get into the topics, but one of them is our 2023 predictions. And you may have already heard a tease. David sounds like he's calling a bottom.
00:02:50.868 - 00:02:52.814, Speaker A: Yeah, but pretty bottomy. I've been calling a bottom.
00:02:52.852 - 00:03:03.094, Speaker B: Yeah, I might check you on that. We'll see. We'll see when we get to the predictions. Also, we've got SBF pleading not guilty. I didn't do it, he says in court. We're going to talk about that. What else we covering today.
00:03:03.212 - 00:03:16.202, Speaker A: The Winklevoss have picked a fight with Barry Silbert on Twitter. The Winklevoss, of course, are operating the Gemini Exchange, which the Gemini earn program has money stuck inside of Genesis, which is part of Barry Silbert's digital currency group.
00:03:16.336 - 00:03:19.740, Speaker B: Both twins, mind you. Right. Because you mess with one, you mess with the other.
00:03:21.550 - 00:03:38.274, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah. And so we're going to pick apart that fight. And also some bad news on the Celsius court proceedings. Ryan, I'm sad to say that you are not a customer of Celsius. You actually are just a investor depositor creditor just like the rest of them.
00:03:38.392 - 00:03:39.262, Speaker B: Just a sucker.
00:03:39.326 - 00:03:41.410, Speaker A: Just another sucker. Yeah. Okay, cool.
00:03:41.480 - 00:03:45.282, Speaker B: They gave my private keys to Alex Machinsky and he ran off with them.
00:03:45.336 - 00:04:02.666, Speaker A: That's exactly what happened. Yes. And yes, that's exactly right. And then, of course, we have to talk about 2023 predictions hours. We're also going to rate some of our 2022 predictions and also talk about some other very awesome predictions that we've seen throughout the space. Eric Walla in particular. I think we're going to go through his.
00:04:02.666 - 00:04:12.858, Speaker A: But first in the market section, we got to talk about all the things going on in the liquid staking derivatives ecosystem, because that's a very hot topic leading into 2023 this week. So all of these topics and more.
00:04:12.944 - 00:04:42.182, Speaker B: Coming throughout the show, guys, we're going to get right into it. Before we do, we want to tell you about our friends and sponsors over at Osmosis. David one of my New Year's resolutions going to 2023 was to do more DFI stuff. I felt like 2022 last year was all about just keeping my head above water and just talking about all the craziness that was going on. This year, I've made a concerted effort to go use more things. One of those things I've started using is Osmosis on the Cosmos chain. This is really cool.
00:04:42.182 - 00:05:00.742, Speaker B: If you want to explore the Cosmos ecosystem, particularly DeFi and cosmos, osmosis is the place to start. The way you do it is you spin up this wallet. It's called a Kepler wallet. You're from the ethereum ecosystem. It's kind of like MetaMask, only for Cosmos. And you go to app Osmosis zone. There's a link in the show notes.
00:05:00.742 - 00:05:21.982, Speaker B: You can deposit atoms to this chain. You can bridge across USDC and WETH small amounts to start. That's all I would advise. But it's a great opportunity to start this chain. And David started on this chain. And David, I was surprised at how easy and how good the UX was. It'd probably been like, two or three years since I went down the Cosmos rabbit hole.
00:05:21.982 - 00:05:43.366, Speaker B: I hadn't been here in a long time. And the UX has just, like, ten X improved. On Osmosis, you can not only trade it's kind of like a uniswap type app, but you can also stake, you can also view all of your assets. So it's almost got kind of like a Zerion Zapper type flavor to it, too. Really cool thing to try in 2023 if you're looking to explore the frontier of crypto.
00:05:43.478 - 00:06:13.518, Speaker A: Yeah. And bankless listeners who listen to our episode about why uni chain is inevitable within Elitezer, this is highly synonymous with that whole thesis. Osmosis is basically kind of uniswap, but as an app chain in the Cosmos ecosystem. So just wanted to connect that dot there. Ryan, you said one of your New Year's resolutions is to be more of a DeFi power user. I want to draw your attention to the Tweet. If we could actually just derail this conversation.
00:06:13.694 - 00:06:17.490, Speaker B: Oh, sure. Go ahead, derail.
00:06:18.390 - 00:07:00.706, Speaker A: I stopped being a DFI, like, super heavy power user and just having latent positions that I would hold open on the blue chips, like Ave Maker. And that's because in 2022, a lot of the DFI stuff you and I didn't really vibe with. And so the Tweet that I want to call attention to, if you can pull that up, I'll just send it to you in Zoom chat. This is one year ago to the day when we got into a fight with Daniel SESTA, by the way. So this is just a one year anniversary of our first of many fights throughout 2023, starting with Daniel SESTA when he came in super hot in my DMs after I said, maker is the most unsustainably valued, most sustained, unfairly valued asset this industry has ever produced. And then Daniel Cesta, who I didn't know who he was at the time. I knew what Wonderland was.
00:07:00.706 - 00:07:05.380, Speaker A: I knew what time and spell and all that stuff was. I just didn't know Daniel Cesta's name.
00:07:06.890 - 00:07:12.550, Speaker B: He was a DeFi developer doing degen. He's like a DeFi wonder Kid kind of person.
00:07:12.620 - 00:07:32.778, Speaker A: Right, exactly. Yeah. Right. And, like, big populist leader with big populous tweets. And this was after the time Token. And all of these Danny tokens were at their all time highs. So he follows up and says, this is why I'm not surprised you've never invited us to your DeFi show fair to protect your bags and your suit friends.
00:07:32.778 - 00:07:37.710, Speaker A: I have never, ever been charged with having suit friends before. So that was a first.
00:07:37.780 - 00:07:38.014, Speaker B: Really?
00:07:38.052 - 00:07:41.566, Speaker A: I was like, who the hell is this guy? Yeah, Bitboy did that same thing to me.
00:07:41.588 - 00:07:43.166, Speaker B: He called suit. Right.
00:07:43.188 - 00:07:45.954, Speaker A: So it's the same people, like, going for after popular tactics, right?
00:07:45.992 - 00:07:46.290, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:46.360 - 00:07:49.700, Speaker A: I just thought, this it's january 4, 2022.
00:07:51.750 - 00:08:10.326, Speaker B: I'm feeling so much better than I was at that point in time. I was just getting sick of it. And where is Danny session now? Kind of washed out. Projects were destroyed, turned into kind of like just a short term pump and dumper. That's what it was. And it was revealed only, like, what, six weeks later.
00:08:10.428 - 00:08:26.494, Speaker A: That's such six weeks later. Yeah. And then we got in a fight with Doe Kwan. And about six weeks later after that, that fell down. And then we did it again. And then that was the story of 2022, us getting in fights with people and then blowing them. Blowing well, that's another thing.
00:08:26.532 - 00:08:33.246, Speaker B: So I want to be more of a DFI user. I have time for that. Rather than kind of chasing all this speculation, all the craziness going on.
00:08:33.268 - 00:08:33.358, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:33.364 - 00:08:39.010, Speaker B: I have more time for that too. Another thing is I don't intend to pick any fights right now.
00:08:39.080 - 00:08:39.742, Speaker A: Fight anymore.
00:08:39.806 - 00:08:49.426, Speaker B: They're all I mean, I don't want to say it's only the good people left. I mean, we could go fight Richard Hart right now if we wanted to, but much energy is that guy.
00:08:49.448 - 00:08:50.882, Speaker A: He's going to stick. Yeah.
00:08:50.936 - 00:09:08.182, Speaker B: So anyway, it's a refreshing way to start the year. And speaking of which, let's talk about markets. David all right. Because we got to get to where we starting in the market section. Let's talk about bitcoin. And we should get cracking on that right now. Thanks to Kraken for showing us these prices.
00:09:08.182 - 00:09:10.474, Speaker B: What is bitcoin looking like on the week?
00:09:10.592 - 00:09:33.630, Speaker A: Bitcoin started the week at 16,600. It is up about 1.2% to $16,834 where we currently are, by the way, ryan since we're level setting because it's 2023, we are about a little bit more than one year away from the next bitcoin happening early. 2024 is when the next bitcoin happening is scheduled.
00:09:33.710 - 00:09:35.106, Speaker B: I feel like no one's talking about it.
00:09:35.128 - 00:09:39.942, Speaker A: David well, the happening is not priced in. It's still a year away. It's still more than a year away.
00:09:40.076 - 00:09:53.594, Speaker B: But still, I mean, I remember, like, previous happenings, the 2020 happening, there's such fervor. Like even 18 months from the happening, 18 months out from the happening, bitcoin community is talking about it, but it's actually becoming less and less impactful over time.
00:09:53.712 - 00:10:07.374, Speaker A: Yeah, and that checks out, right? Because every happening has like 50% less magnitude than the happening prior. It's like an asymptote. Right. But also just like, bitcoin isn't as CenterPoint of this industry as it was four years ago.
00:10:07.492 - 00:10:11.166, Speaker B: Let's look at the year for bitcoin. Down on the year, big down on.
00:10:11.188 - 00:10:13.246, Speaker A: The year, big down on the year.
00:10:13.268 - 00:10:18.926, Speaker B: Down 60% on the year, 40,000 all the way down. How about ETH? What's that looking like on ETH?
00:10:19.038 - 00:10:28.354, Speaker A: ETH up 3.9% on the week, going up from $1,200 up to one $250 in seven days.
00:10:28.552 - 00:10:28.962, Speaker B: Great.
00:10:29.016 - 00:10:29.282, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:29.336 - 00:10:33.846, Speaker B: This is like on January 3, there's a pump. We had a three to 4% rise in one day.
00:10:33.948 - 00:11:01.370, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And people are pointing at the ETH BTC ratio for there were just a bunch of ta about convergence on the ETH BTC ratio that was either going to break up or break down. People were placing their bets and turns out it broke up. It broke to the upside. Which leads us to the ETH BTC ratio, which is up 2.8% on the week, 72, up to zero 74, where we are today. And so, yeah, that's the state of the markets with ether and bitcoin and the ratio.
00:11:01.530 - 00:11:09.438, Speaker B: Well, let's talk about some other metrics, and we'll do a yearly recap here. So how about the total crypto market cap? Where are we? Under a billion.
00:11:09.534 - 00:11:13.540, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, under a billion. 850,000,000,000 on the total crypto market cap.
00:11:13.910 - 00:11:41.562, Speaker B: How does this compare on a year over year? So, when we look at the performance of 2022, some numbers coming in. So the S and P 500 david was down. So this is stocks down about 18% last year, Nasdaq. So this is like tech stocks. Remember growth stocks, which boomed like crazy in 2020. 2021, down 33%. So stocks down Badish, but not compared to crypto.
00:11:41.562 - 00:11:49.118, Speaker B: Let's take a look at some of those numbers. Total crypto market cap, David down 65% for 2022, down.
00:11:49.204 - 00:12:04.910, Speaker A: Now, that includes the stablecoin market cap. So there's some just bad measurement there because a bunch of that market cap went flat. And so the actual crypto asset market cap is down worse than that.
00:12:05.080 - 00:12:27.590, Speaker B: I see in terms of investable assets, the pain that people feel, right? Yeah, that's a good note. Bitcoin down 65% during 2022. ETH down 68%. 2022. Sol salana tokens down. 94%. Other alt layer ones, similar DPI.
00:12:27.590 - 00:12:35.614, Speaker B: This is the DFI pulse index. So these are the top DFI tokens down 80%, which doesn't sound so bad.
00:12:35.652 - 00:12:38.990, Speaker A: But I'll remind you that it was down 80% the year prior to that, too.
00:12:39.060 - 00:12:45.566, Speaker B: Oh, okay. Back to back down 80%. So, predictions, this is a comeback year, right? Can't get any worse.
00:12:45.598 - 00:12:51.474, Speaker A: Yeah, right? DFI has been in a bear market. They're like, hey, welcome guys.
00:12:51.672 - 00:13:04.902, Speaker B: For a year, we've already been down in the 8th circle of hell. NFT blue chip. This is the top ten NFTs. This is a metric coming from Nansen, which is interesting, only down 15%.
00:13:05.036 - 00:13:05.794, Speaker A: Is that in ETH?
00:13:05.842 - 00:13:07.078, Speaker B: Denominator, I think that yeah.
00:13:07.164 - 00:13:13.818, Speaker A: Down 15% in ETH. So you have to pay negative 68% in dollars and then go down 15 more percent.
00:13:13.904 - 00:13:17.450, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess the way to measure your NFTs is in ETH.
00:13:17.950 - 00:13:19.034, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the right?
00:13:19.072 - 00:13:27.338, Speaker B: Is that how you measure it? That's not how mainstream measures it's. All dollars. Like you bought a million dollar punk, you're down in ETH.
00:13:27.434 - 00:13:40.510, Speaker A: To that, we'll talk about this. Somebody bought a punk for a certain dollar price. That's about the same dollar price that it was sold. So it was a wash in dollar terms, but they were up about three X in ETH terms, was that a victory or was that not a victory?
00:13:40.590 - 00:14:04.140, Speaker B: Well, you and I know the answer. That was a huge victory. That's like a three X victory, because ETH is money, and it's the money you want to hold. Stablecoin market cap. So, to your point, this is the total volume value excuse me, of all stablecoins out there, down 17%. So we had some exit from stablecoins DFI, total value locked. This is like assets under Management, down 76%.
00:14:04.140 - 00:14:12.158, Speaker B: Layer two total locked value is also down, actually, on the year in dollar terms, down 28%.
00:14:12.244 - 00:14:14.080, Speaker A: Yet that's a win.
00:14:14.450 - 00:14:18.606, Speaker B: But tell me the silver lining, because if you denominate it in ETH, what is it?
00:14:18.628 - 00:14:50.550, Speaker A: Yes, a layer two TVL denominated in ETH is up 118%. In the grand scheme of things, that's what a bull market looks like. In 2022, you are only down 28.7% and your East Denominated TVL is up 120%. The L two S are currently in a bull market, despite the rest of crypto being down an average of 65%. If you are only down 28% in US dollar terms, that's a win. That's a huge win.
00:14:50.700 - 00:15:11.582, Speaker B: If you're down least, you're winning in this market. L two has had a good year. So that's how we wrap 2022. That's what went on. We'll talk a little bit more about what we can expect in 2023 later in the episode. But, of course, crypto spot volume on exchanges down as well. So you could see the peak here, like the peak was around May of 2021.
00:15:11.582 - 00:15:18.386, Speaker B: In terms of volume on exchanges, what is FTX? Where's FTX? Here. Do you see it on the right?
00:15:18.488 - 00:15:19.618, Speaker A: I don't see it.
00:15:19.784 - 00:15:21.774, Speaker B: They must have stripped FTX from these charts.
00:15:21.822 - 00:15:26.558, Speaker A: But legitimate, I think they're not counting that as no longer legitimate volume.
00:15:26.654 - 00:15:38.438, Speaker B: Yes. All right, well, take us to some traditional finance metrics as well. Give us some context for the SMP market that we're in, the stock market that we're in, and this decline versus others.
00:15:38.604 - 00:16:22.082, Speaker A: Yeah, so we're looking at a graph on the screen here that basically has every single negative 20% or more decline from all time high of the S and P 500. And there's a bunch on screen there's 1234-5678, 910, 1112 different 20% declines from all time highs since World War II. And so you can see 2022 in red. It's kind of hard to see because at the very beginning, they're overlapping, but I'm highlighting it here with my arrow here. Ryan can't see that in red, we have it 2022, and I would say it's among the herd. It's definitely on the lower end of the herd, as in it has dropped faster than the herd of these many different declines. But I would say mostly par for the course, slightly worse.
00:16:22.082 - 00:16:26.198, Speaker A: But also we're in the middle of it. It could continue.
00:16:26.284 - 00:16:26.934, Speaker B: Not over yet.
00:16:26.972 - 00:16:28.402, Speaker A: It's not over necessarily.
00:16:28.466 - 00:16:34.042, Speaker B: It kind of looks a little bit at this point, like the way 2007 looked right.
00:16:34.096 - 00:16:52.190, Speaker A: And so we are declining at about the same pace that 2007 was, except we are not at that point of 2007 where it was declining as much as we were and then it went down like two to two and a half times more. Yeah. Well, that's interesting fear for you guys.
00:16:52.260 - 00:17:01.314, Speaker B: Well, so if we get a 2023 that matches the stock market 2007, then we're down another 30% from here.
00:17:01.432 - 00:17:03.810, Speaker A: Basically we got way more to go.
00:17:03.880 - 00:17:08.142, Speaker B: And that could take another, what, nine months to play out something like this.
00:17:08.216 - 00:17:11.800, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. That's like worst case scenario for sure.
00:17:12.170 - 00:17:25.306, Speaker B: We also had this 8.3 trillion was wiped out of the stock market in 2022. If that's a headline number for you as well, what is Michael Burry's take on inflation? I thought that was interesting as we entered this year as well. Yeah.
00:17:25.328 - 00:17:54.738, Speaker A: Michael Burry is calling for the peak of inflation. He says inflation peaked, but it is not the last peak of this cycle. We are likely to see lower CPI, possibly negative in what's, two h 22nd half, second half of 2023 and the US in recession. By any definition, the Fed will cut and government will stimulate and we will have another inflation spike. It's not hard. So that's what he's saying. We've currently spiked.
00:17:54.738 - 00:18:05.526, Speaker A: Ah, but it's not going to be the last spike that we will see, but we're going to come down for it and then we'll spike again. And then he's probably saying we're going to come down from that spike and then I'll spike again thereafter. I think that's what he's calling for.
00:18:05.628 - 00:18:21.466, Speaker B: This is kind of when we talked to some of the macro experts who we like and respect. Lyn Alden, for instance, in the summer, this is kind of what she was predicting basically, that we would be able to slay the beast, but then it would return and it would just be basically chop from inflation. From here on out, we're going to.
00:18:21.488 - 00:18:37.714, Speaker A: Just trade blows between inflation and our insurmountable debt problem. And so we're going to be like, oh, inflation, it's too high, we need to raise interest rates. And then we'll raise interest rates and like, oh, interest payments, they're too high. And then we'll go back and we'll just bounce back between those two things.
00:18:37.832 - 00:18:43.454, Speaker B: A bright spot in the crypto markets. Recently, crypto asset markets have been liquid LSD.
00:18:43.582 - 00:18:44.462, Speaker A: LSD.
00:18:44.606 - 00:18:48.726, Speaker B: What is LSD? David, explain what those are and show us some numbers here.
00:18:48.828 - 00:18:54.840, Speaker A: So LSDs are liquid staking derivatives, not the compound made by Albert Hoffman in 1947.
00:18:57.610 - 00:18:58.898, Speaker B: OD amount. About that.
00:18:59.004 - 00:19:19.886, Speaker A: Yeah, let me tell you albert Hoffman. Yeah, two ends on his name. Okay, so to lead the pack, we have Lido rocket pool and swise out of the LSD sector. Lido is up 45%, which is a big deal because it's a pretty high market cap. It's currently clocking in at $1.3 billion in fully diluted value.
00:19:20.068 - 00:19:28.674, Speaker B: What do liquid staking derivatives do. Basically, these are ETH like staking service providers? Basically, yes.
00:19:28.712 - 00:20:04.762, Speaker A: And so the idea is that you can stake your ETH with one of these systems, lido Rocket Pool, Swise. There's also a few others and they will return you a staked ETH token as a result. And so that staked ETH token is ether, plus the staking rewards that that ether is also getting. So the rewards are built into the token. So Lido has staked, ETH, Rocket Pool has our ETH, swise has some, I don't know, can't remember the name of it, but it's got something similar. And so then what we're talking about are the tokens associated with that protocol. Right? So LDO is the Lido Dow Token, which is up 45% at a fully diluted valuation of $1.3
00:20:04.762 - 00:20:27.166, Speaker A: billion. That's a big move, 45%. And these are over two week time horizons, by the way. So 45% in two weeks, a big move for a $1.3 billion valuation. Project rocket Pool up 15% to $420,000,000, fully diluted. And then Swise as the smallest of the bunch, up a whopping 61% for a $125,000,000 valuation.
00:20:27.166 - 00:20:31.126, Speaker A: Ryan, did you know that we had exposure to Swise and the Bankless fund?
00:20:31.308 - 00:20:32.598, Speaker B: I do know that.
00:20:32.764 - 00:20:34.402, Speaker A: Nice job, Ben. Well done, Ben.
00:20:34.466 - 00:20:38.150, Speaker B: Okay, david, you mentioned the bankless fund. What is this Bankless fund thing?
00:20:38.300 - 00:21:22.550, Speaker A: Yeah, so we've got a super chat analyst, Ben Gov, on the Bankless team. He's also highly active in the inner circle and he also does a ton of analyst research for the Bankless newsletter, which ends up turning into the Bankless Token Report and also the Token Bible. So if you want some of this research, you can go get that. If you are a premium subscriber and using some of that research, him and me and Ryan are in a little discord room in the HQ chat and we talk about what we want to invest in based off of the research that he is doing for the Token Bible and the Token reports. And so if you want access to some of Ben's research and what we are thinking about when we invest in the Bankless fund, you can subscribe to Bankless and get some of that research.
00:21:22.700 - 00:21:25.286, Speaker B: So Swise was in there, Swiss was.
00:21:25.308 - 00:21:28.518, Speaker A: In there, RPL was in there. I do not believe we have Lido exposure. No.
00:21:28.604 - 00:21:58.690, Speaker B: Yes, and of course all of our disclosures are posted at all times@banklesshq.com. Disclosures where you can see the composition of all things Bankless, everything we hold. All right, David, let's talk about ETH staking because that number has gone up as well. We're looking at total ETH deposited 16 million or so ETH. I don't know what percent that is. About 13%, maybe close to 14% of all supply is now staked.
00:22:00.390 - 00:22:03.726, Speaker A: Of course it only goes up into the right because withdrawals are not enabled.
00:22:03.758 - 00:22:05.010, Speaker B: But this thing can't go down.
00:22:05.080 - 00:22:13.670, Speaker A: This thing has never not gone up into the right. That thing is just an absolute rocket ship. So 16 million ether state. Wow. Like, not too far away from 20 million.
00:22:13.820 - 00:22:41.822, Speaker B: A big event. Catalyst. I think this quarter is the question of will we actually get withdrawals enabled maybe this quarter or shortly after into the next quarter? And what will happen to this number once withdrawals are enabled? I think David and I have said before, we don't think it'll go down that much. Others are a bit more bearish on this. Say it'll decrease dramatically and that will be a net negative for ether. I'm still keeping the bull position on that. I don't think this number goes down very far.
00:22:41.822 - 00:22:50.722, Speaker B: Even post withdrawals, when withdrawals are enabled, I still think it creeps up and we definitely finished the year higher than when we started. But what's your take on this?
00:22:50.776 - 00:23:26.970, Speaker A: Oh, I think that's exactly right. I think that there'll definitely be a short term decrease because people will withdraw. There will be more churn than there is a decrease, as in people will be able to finally withdraw from Lido. And this is kind of the meta that's going on right now with the LSD derivative. Meta is like, all right, a lot of stuff is locked. When there's finally churn that's enabled, who's going to try and capture Lido's market share? Is Lido going to even lose market share? But the fish are hungry and they're trying to capture some of that churn. I think there's going to be way more churn shaking of the snow globe.
00:23:26.970 - 00:23:53.670, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. And because of withdrawals as a conversation, people are just saying, thinking that just like, the attention is going to be on the LSD meta. And so that's why we're talking about this right now. The LSD trade has definitely shown up in the charts. You can see it and whether I think the staking supply will go down. I bet you in the quarter, in the three month period, it will be net up. So I bet you it could be down for a month.
00:23:53.670 - 00:24:02.074, Speaker A: Maybe it's down for two months. By around three months, I'm pretty confident that whatever withdrawal, the net withdrawals happen will have already happened and will be up into the right once again.
00:24:02.192 - 00:24:12.218, Speaker B: So LSD doing well. So is Arbitrum. Arbitrum had a big year. This is size. Chad saying Arbitrum sizes. Size. By the way, I met Size Chad in person at permissionless.
00:24:12.218 - 00:24:15.578, Speaker B: He absolutely lives up to his name. This man is a beast.
00:24:15.674 - 00:24:22.554, Speaker A: That is not a manufactured, that is an organically discovered name. Size chad is truly size Chad.
00:24:22.602 - 00:24:30.514, Speaker B: Do you know, there's a picture out there somewhere, I've never been able to find it. Of me, Size Chad and Cooper Turley all, like, standing next to each other and I'm in the middle.
00:24:30.632 - 00:24:32.098, Speaker A: I have not seen that.
00:24:32.184 - 00:24:48.006, Speaker B: No. Basically, it looks like I'm like frodo and there's like aragorn and Boromir or something. I look like a child. I'm child sized compared to these people. Anyway, what's the size chad of Arbitrum. What's this graph we're looking at?
00:24:48.108 - 00:25:04.502, Speaker A: So on the left we have the deposits of ETH into Arbitrum one, which is totaling a little bit over 800,000. And on the right we have deposits in ETH to literally every single other layer two, which is coming up to 700,000.
00:25:04.656 - 00:25:06.974, Speaker B: Now, this isn't TVL, this is to.
00:25:07.012 - 00:25:38.406, Speaker A: ETH, this is ETH, this is Bridged ETH, which is in my mind, the best kind of TVL. But you're right, not all TVL. And so Arbitrum is literally the size chad of layer twos. So congrats to the Arbitrum ecosystem. And one thing I've definitely noticed on Twitter is that the Arbitrum community has started to delineate into subcommunities. And so you're seeing really that same sort of thing that we saw on Ethereum over 2020 to 2022 of Ethereum developing into its own subcommunities communities. You're seeing that in Arbitrum as well.
00:25:38.406 - 00:25:41.146, Speaker A: So the Arbitrum like ecosystem is really strong.
00:25:41.328 - 00:25:54.414, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll see. This is another snow globe where this is just getting started. This competition for L two S is just getting started. And so I'll love to see this number at the end of 2023. David, what do we got coming up next?
00:25:54.532 - 00:26:10.146, Speaker A: SBS pleads not guilty. Bold strategy. We'll see how that plays out. The wink of eye of twins. Pick a fight with Barry Silber of DCG and Genesis on Twitter. And again, like I said, a not so great update from the Celsius court proceedings. So that's all the big news of the week.
00:26:10.146 - 00:26:42.266, Speaker A: And so we'll get to all of these conversations and more. But first, a moment to talk to Kraken, who is our strategic sponsor of 2023.

00:28:46.494 - 00:29:06.442, Speaker B: David. I hope we left SBF in 2022, but he's back. This time he's saying he's not guilty, but before that, he also said, it wasn't me. What is he talking about here? This tweet, none of these are me. I'm not and couldn't be moving any of these funds. I don't have access to them anymore. What funds is he talking about? People think he moved some money.
00:29:06.576 - 00:29:46.598, Speaker A: Yeah. So on Crypto Twitter, this conversation happened as soon as this one wallet, which was known to be SBF's wallet, started moving hundreds of thousands of dollars from wallet A to wallet B. And then SBF retweeted a Cointelegraph article talking about this, saying, none of these are me. I couldn't be doing this because I don't have access to them anymore. And then crypto Twitter replies like, this is an address that you stated was yours. SBF frequently previously identified this address that money is coming out to as my address, as SBF's address. It's been noted by other people that it is SBF's address.
00:29:46.598 - 00:29:53.190, Speaker A: And now SBF is saying it's not me. And I don't know, maybe it's not him, but can you really trust him anymore?
00:29:53.270 - 00:29:58.810, Speaker B: Like, damn, that was my comment. I was just basically yeah, but what if you're lying?
00:29:59.310 - 00:30:01.920, Speaker A: Which at this point, there's no defense for that.
00:30:02.850 - 00:30:21.106, Speaker B: I have no idea. But remember last we left him before. At least I broke for the holidays. He was out on bail, so he's still out, maybe on a house arrest. I don't know if that's the case anymore, but clearly he has access to Twitter now, so not in jail any longer. We'll see if that changes this year.
00:30:21.208 - 00:30:41.522, Speaker A: And I think this meme really just summarizes everything. It's the they don't know meme, of course, but this time it has the curly hair of SBF as the guy in the corner and the curly hair SBF guy in the corner says, they don't know it's not me moving the funds. And then the people dancing are like, you docked the address, you dumb. So, yeah, summarizes.
00:30:41.666 - 00:30:44.786, Speaker B: He's also pleading not guilty to criminal charges.
00:30:44.818 - 00:30:45.218, Speaker A: Really?
00:30:45.324 - 00:31:12.500, Speaker B: So he's had his day in court so far, and when the judge asked, what do you plead, Sam Bankman Freed, he said, not guilty. I'm innocent of all the charges. Why do you think so? I know there's been some conspiracy about this, that, again, this idea that maybe he has some get out of jail free card. He has some politician, maybe the WEF's involved, somebody's involved, like the global elites to get him off the hook. What do you think about this?
00:31:12.950 - 00:31:51.262, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think there's the very simple take, and I think then there's the more nuanced. Let's read into this take, and I'll let you take that conversation. The first one is that the plea deal that he got was so bad that he was like, it wasn't a good plea deal at all. So he's like, Damn it, I'll just fight this. Right? Because he is so incredibly guilty that they basically gave him zero compromises on his plea deal. And so he decided that because the plea deal was so bad, I'll just fight it because that's a lose lose scenario. I think that is a pretty simple explanation, but I know that there's another explanation that you've got that you want to talk about.
00:31:51.396 - 00:32:33.678, Speaker B: Well, this is an interesting opinion piece that I read in CoinDesk. But basically the idea that maybe Sam Bankman Fried actually is so deluded that he thinks he's innocent. He thinks that he is the know, it's often said that nobody ever sees themselves as the villain. And I think that's the case with Sam Bankman Freed. I mean, he might legitimately think that he is innocent of at least some of these charges. I don't know what kind of moral framework he operates under. It's been incredibly confusing for me to see over the last six months or longer, but he may be really deluded enough to think that he's got a chance to fight this.
00:32:33.678 - 00:33:25.326, Speaker B: And that would be consistent with all of his interviews and the press tour he was going on before he actually got put in jail. Still, though, David, I would have thought some nights in prison in the Bahamas would have woken him up to the reality that he's in deep and he's not going to get out of this with an interview and an awe Shucks and saying I'm sorry ten more times that these are serious charges laid against him and he doesn't really have a way out. There's mounting evidence. I mean, his two partners in this, caroline and who's the other? But they've effectively ratted him out. They are effectively telling everything and divulging everything and I would imagine behind closed doors blaming him. So I don't know if he gets out of this, but he might just be deluded enough to think he can try.
00:33:25.508 - 00:34:07.962, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I'm always happy to try and put on armchair psychologist David, but, like, some sort of prince syndrome might be in effect here by his Harvard highly educated elite parents treating him like a prince and telling him, and this is a quote from the article sam Bakemansfried self image, in other words, is both of a gifted and good person. We are watching that clash with the reality of his behavior, that of a conniving, stimulant, addicted screw up. And they also talk about the disposition of his parents. We saw signs during the hearings in the Bahamas that his parents are struggling in similar ways to reconcile their idea of their son with the reality of his actions. Barbara Freed, Sam's mother, was seen laughing at descriptions of her son as a criminal. Wow. Yeah.
00:34:08.096 - 00:34:20.240, Speaker B: That is delusional. I don't know what to make of that. Again, we'll have to see how this turns out. But what's the probability that Sam goes to jail this year? Do you think that's a slam going to happen?
00:34:21.730 - 00:34:26.480, Speaker A: I think it would be rational to bet my net worth. Yeah, your net worth.
00:34:27.010 - 00:34:30.498, Speaker B: It would not be rational because there's no upside. David, you don't have to do that.
00:34:30.584 - 00:34:31.122, Speaker A: What do you mean?
00:34:31.176 - 00:34:34.722, Speaker B: I guess, well, bet it like double if I'm right.
00:34:34.776 - 00:34:37.906, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a double or nothing. Yeah, if I'm right, my net worth doubles. Yeah.
00:34:37.928 - 00:34:38.878, Speaker B: I don't know. I wouldn't do that.
00:34:38.904 - 00:34:39.526, Speaker A: You wouldn't do that?
00:34:39.548 - 00:34:40.694, Speaker B: I definitely wouldn't do that.
00:34:40.812 - 00:34:43.478, Speaker A: I think that's a rational bet. I think so.
00:34:43.644 - 00:34:47.960, Speaker B: Well, I would say I'm 90% certain is how I'd phrase it.
00:34:48.490 - 00:34:49.990, Speaker A: Will you put 90%?
00:34:50.060 - 00:35:05.546, Speaker B: No, I'm not going to put any money. This is like betting on ripple or doing something like this. I don't do that. Either down or up. I don't bet against it. Who knows what could happen? The world is a very strange place. Let's talk about the Winklevosses versus Barry Silbert.
00:35:05.546 - 00:35:12.458, Speaker B: Talking about a strange place that we're in. They put out an open letter on Twitter this week. What does this say from Cameron Winklevoss?
00:35:12.554 - 00:35:54.410, Speaker A: Yeah, it's basically a damnation of Barry Silbert and digital currency group and how it is up to Barry to make things right again, that Barry has the power to make things right again, and he's not doing that. And so I'll read one specific paragraph. The idea in your head that you can quietly hide in your ivory tower and that this was all just will just magically go away, or that this is someone else's problem is pure fantasy. To be clear, this mess is entirely of your own making. This is Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to Barry Silvert digital currency group, of which you are the founder and CEO, owes Genesis $1.67 billion. That is the money that Genesis owns to Gemini earned customers and other creditors.
00:35:54.410 - 00:36:38.890, Speaker A: You took this money, the money of school teachers to fuel groody yeah, right? To fuel greedy share buybacks, illiquid venture investments and Kamikaze Grayscale net asset value trades that ballooned the fee generating AUM of your trust, all at the expense of creditors and all for your own personal gain. It's now time for you to take the responsibility and to do the right thing. Wow. Pretty damning. And that actually kind of paints a picture that is pretty similar to what was going on with FTX, right? Like taking in customer deposits, doing illiquid venture capital bets and share buybacks and all. That's kind of what SBF did, perhaps in a much more above board fashion. But this is what the Gemini twins are charging Barry Silbert with.
00:36:38.890 - 00:37:05.122, Speaker A: Barry Silbert, who's been very quiet on Twitter lately, woke up from his hibernation, if you will, and responded and said, DCG did not borrow $1.67 billion from Genesis. DCG has never missed an interest payment to Genesis and is current on all of its loans. Outstanding. DCG delivered to Genesis and your advisors a proposal on December 9 and has not received any response. And then Cameron Winklevoss responds on Twitter. There you go again.
00:37:05.122 - 00:37:15.046, Speaker A: Stop trying to pretend that you and DCG are innocent bystanders and have nothing to do with creating this mess. Is completely disingenuous and basically the fight. That's basically the fight. Yeah.
00:37:15.148 - 00:37:16.482, Speaker B: Sparring back and forth.
00:37:16.546 - 00:37:16.822, Speaker A: Right.
00:37:16.876 - 00:37:39.066, Speaker B: And this is Cameron Winklevoss really turning up the heat on Barry and making this public and disparaging him quite openly. So I don't know what this is. Negotiation tactic. They're obviously talking behind closed doors as well. At least their legal arms are. But this still doesn't look like it's close to getting resolved. And I do feel for everyone who has money in earn accounts.
00:37:39.066 - 00:37:54.898, Speaker B: Right. I don't know that we're any closer to seeing those deposits freed up with this ongoing dispute. It's crazy to me that all this takes place publicly, too, over Twitter. What a weird time we're living in.
00:37:54.984 - 00:38:21.994, Speaker A: At least we get to talk about it. And the last update on the DCG Genesis case that we have actually happened right before we started recording. So we are still waiting for further details, but a tweet out that seems to be corroborated and accepted. Update DCG Genesis is under active investigation by the SEC. Sources confirmed that there are multiple whistleblowers that have come forward. So this is just breaking as we are recording this. We're probably going to hear about this in further detail, perhaps Friday and throughout all of next week.
00:38:21.994 - 00:38:24.398, Speaker A: And I guess we'll have to recover that on the next weekly roll up.
00:38:24.484 - 00:38:37.410, Speaker B: This is still some mess carryover from last year spilling into 2023. So hopefully this gets taken care of soon. David there's some bad news, though, for Celsius depositors. Why don't you break it to us? Yes.
00:38:37.480 - 00:39:02.458, Speaker A: So, in the Celsius Bankruptcy Court proceedings, it has been ruled that if you are a customer who deposited money into Celsius, that is not your money and it belongs to Celsius at the moment of deposit. And so you are a creditor, not a customer. And so that you have to, as a former customer of Celsius, line up in bankruptcy court just like everyone else.
00:39:02.544 - 00:39:06.490, Speaker B: And you're last in line behind other creditors as well, unfortunately, right?
00:39:06.560 - 00:39:23.046, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So this is another stark reminder that not your keys, not your crypto. If you have to read the fine print in order to understand if you are an owner of your own deposits or not, you should probably consider yourself not the owner of your deposits.
00:39:23.178 - 00:39:51.398, Speaker B: This is from Martin Glenn, who is the bankruptcy judge here. He said, as explained below, the court concludes, based on Celsius's unambiguous terms of service did you read those? And subject to any reserve defenses, that when cryptocurrency assets were deposited in earn accounts, the cryptocurrency assets became Celsius's property. David once people hit that deposit button, it was no longer their money.
00:39:51.564 - 00:39:53.430, Speaker A: According to terms of service?
00:39:53.580 - 00:40:05.002, Speaker B: Yes, according to terms of service. They gave it to Alex. They entrusted Alex Machinsky with it, and of course, he was off gambling with it in all sorts of ways. How brutal is that?
00:40:05.136 - 00:40:15.140, Speaker A: And remember, of course, Alex is warning to us all on his T shirt. If we could put that image up, Luke, on the screen, banks are not your friend. Thank you, Alex, for letting us know.
00:40:15.750 - 00:40:17.090, Speaker B: What a reminder.
00:40:17.830 - 00:40:18.606, Speaker A: Pretty brutal.
00:40:18.638 - 00:40:20.798, Speaker B: So my Celsius deposit never coming back, huh?
00:40:20.814 - 00:40:21.950, Speaker A: David sorry, brother.
00:40:22.030 - 00:40:26.994, Speaker B: Sorry about that. Well, what is the Attorney General of New York doing about it?
00:40:27.032 - 00:41:16.674, Speaker A: Yeah, this also came out just a few hours ago. So New York Attorney General tweets out, I'm suing the former CEO of cryptocurrency platform Celsius Network for defrauding investors out of billions of dollars. Alex Machinsky lied to people about the risk of investing in Celsius, hid it from deteriorating financial condition, and failed to register in New York. So the NYAG going after Alex Machinsky, which I definitely think is like, probably prosecute him, I'm worried about overreach and overflow into the crypto world says, like, hey, let's regulate crypto as a result of this. Let's place it on the table. We should regulate and criminalize fraudsters who do bad things. And if they happen to use crypto to do that, that is an adjacent fact.
00:41:16.674 - 00:41:21.170, Speaker A: It's not crypto that is about this. I would like to place that on the table.
00:41:21.250 - 00:41:35.530, Speaker B: Yeah, look I agree. I'm glad that Attorney General James is taking this action. It's fantastic. But I do get worried when the last line of her tweet is, we will continue to protect people from the risks of investing in cryptocurrency.
00:41:35.950 - 00:41:39.274, Speaker A: Ryan, the risks of investing in cryptocurrency are why I'm here.
00:41:39.392 - 00:42:02.910, Speaker B: Yes, and you also can't protect people from them without being how do you do? Yeah, so I'm just worried about that last line. What it should say, ideally, is, continue to protect people from the risks of centralized banks. Banks? Banks providing cryptocurrency services. Trust where we need protection.
00:42:02.990 - 00:42:03.620, Speaker A: Yes.
00:42:03.990 - 00:42:10.870, Speaker B: In that area where we don't have public information, that area where we give up our private keys, we need protection there.
00:42:11.020 - 00:42:13.778, Speaker A: If there's small print, we need protection.
00:42:13.874 - 00:42:17.574, Speaker B: If there's a terms of service, we need some help. Yeah, all right.
00:42:17.612 - 00:42:17.910, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:42:17.980 - 00:42:21.954, Speaker B: Right, so what do we got coming up next, David? I think we're getting into prediction Zone.
00:42:22.082 - 00:42:43.854, Speaker A: Yeah, this is going to be super fun. We're going to talk about our predictions for 2023. We're going to talk about other people's predictions for 2023. And, of course, the rest of the news as well. A Bitcoin core Dev has all of their bitcoin stolen in a self custodial fumble. Love to talk about that. As well as the rest of the news, some Cuba news, some NFT news, as Zombie Punk got stolen and a bunch of other cool stuff.
00:42:43.854 - 00:43:17.782, Speaker A: So all of this and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors to help you. Go, Bankless.

00:44:41.820 - 00:44:48.198, Speaker B: We'll get to ours, but first, let's start with Eric Wall. David, let's read these one by one. You got the first one from Eric Wall. He's got a bunch of them here.
00:44:48.284 - 00:44:55.514, Speaker A: Number one, finance and Tether survives. I agree that. They've already survived all these years. They're going to survive again. What's number two?
00:44:55.552 - 00:45:04.702, Speaker B: Also agree? Yeah, I agree with that. Number two is Sam Bankman freed goes to prison for ten plus years. Yes, we already said I agree with that.
00:45:04.756 - 00:45:05.710, Speaker A: Betting my net worth.
00:45:05.780 - 00:45:10.174, Speaker B: Yeah. David, he's really going for that one. What's number three?
00:45:10.212 - 00:45:18.020, Speaker A: I am now susceptible to a huge flight risk from Sam Bankman Fried. Number three, bitcoin's $15.4 thousand. Was the bottom. Agree?
00:45:18.790 - 00:45:21.010, Speaker B: You agree how you guys call in a bottom?
00:45:21.080 - 00:45:23.246, Speaker A: Yes. Come on, Ryan.
00:45:23.358 - 00:45:24.980, Speaker B: I'm not going to agree with that.
00:45:26.710 - 00:45:30.022, Speaker A: Dirty all right, Ryan's out for that one.
00:45:30.076 - 00:45:31.942, Speaker B: Number four, I'm not going to bet my net worth.
00:45:31.996 - 00:45:38.246, Speaker A: David, number four, noster interest fizzles out. Elon resigns. What's Noster? I don't know what Noster is.
00:45:38.268 - 00:45:38.614, Speaker B: Don't know.
00:45:38.652 - 00:45:39.366, Speaker A: Okay, skip that one.
00:45:39.388 - 00:45:41.650, Speaker B: Elon resigns, though. Do you think that will happen?
00:45:41.740 - 00:45:44.220, Speaker A: Resigns from what, twitter? I guess so, yeah.
00:45:44.670 - 00:45:47.098, Speaker B: He was unclear, so he's got three shots at it.
00:45:47.184 - 00:45:47.898, Speaker A: I don't know what's going on.
00:45:47.904 - 00:45:52.922, Speaker B: How many companies in Elon? Okay, ethereum enables withdrawals. That's a big yes. That's happening.
00:45:52.976 - 00:45:53.934, Speaker A: Big yes. Big yes.
00:45:53.972 - 00:45:55.918, Speaker B: You're right. Eric, go six.
00:45:56.004 - 00:46:09.730, Speaker A: You should like the ones that you agree with. Number six, the most interesting thing in crypto continues to be AI LLMs GPT and stable diffusion. So Eric's saying that crypto is going to be super boring and we're all going to be talking about AI stuff throughout 2023.
00:46:09.800 - 00:46:12.962, Speaker B: No, downvote, downvote. I don't know.
00:46:13.016 - 00:46:15.218, Speaker A: Actually, man, AI is pretty interesting.
00:46:15.384 - 00:46:21.622, Speaker B: We're going to be talking about crypto. It's not going to be the most interesting thing in crypto. Come on. That would be a super boring year.
00:46:21.756 - 00:46:28.166, Speaker A: Totally. I'm not a slam dunk. No on that one or yes on that one. Okay, moving on.
00:46:28.268 - 00:46:29.800, Speaker B: I will bet my net worth.
00:46:30.430 - 00:46:32.940, Speaker A: Salana, $8. Was the bottom. Agree?
00:46:33.790 - 00:46:35.434, Speaker B: I disagree. I don't think so.
00:46:35.472 - 00:46:47.578, Speaker A: I don't agree so much as Ether or bitcoin on that one, but yes, I do agree. ETH BTC touches zero. Nine. Yeah, I agree. I definitely agree. By the way, the flipping.
00:46:47.674 - 00:46:48.800, Speaker B: Where are we right now?
00:46:50.050 - 00:46:55.920, Speaker A: 72.9, I think, would be a high. It would be a high.
00:46:56.450 - 00:47:01.586, Speaker B: It's a good call. I'm going with a yes on that. Mount Gox coins are finally redistributed. I have no idea.
00:47:01.608 - 00:47:03.140, Speaker A: I don't have an opinion on that one.
00:47:03.590 - 00:47:08.230, Speaker B: How about this one? NFT slump stops, returns 1 billion monthly.
00:47:08.890 - 00:47:15.720, Speaker A: Yes. So he is calling the bottom on NFT volume. I don't have a strong opinion on that one.
00:47:16.570 - 00:47:17.286, Speaker B: Neither do I.
00:47:17.308 - 00:47:18.326, Speaker A: Don't have a strong opinion on that one.
00:47:18.348 - 00:47:21.734, Speaker B: It's going to be a good year for NFTs, but not a crazy year in my opinion.
00:47:21.862 - 00:47:34.330, Speaker A: Bitcoin pumps above $30,000. I think ODS are that volatility will take it above $30,000 and then it could return to below $20,000 agreed. In the same year. So I agree with that one.
00:47:34.480 - 00:47:40.494, Speaker B: That's the thing is I don't think we've hit lows yet, but I also think we'll be over some point at some point.
00:47:40.612 - 00:47:49.940, Speaker A: Twelve months is a long time. Ethereum 80% OFAC compliance was the top. Agree. Big agree of compliant blocks are down only from here on out.
00:47:50.390 - 00:47:54.178, Speaker B: The SEC brings a case against. Hex drops below a cent.
00:47:54.344 - 00:47:57.778, Speaker A: What do you think? At least one of those two things will happen? Yes.
00:47:57.944 - 00:48:00.210, Speaker B: Okay, I'll go with one of those two things.
00:48:00.360 - 00:48:03.734, Speaker A: Do you know what the price of hex is right now, Ryan? I bet you don't even know.
00:48:03.772 - 00:48:06.040, Speaker B: It's not a thing that's burnt in my memory at all.
00:48:06.410 - 00:48:13.450, Speaker A: I don't care about 1.7 cents. Last I checked, it's at 1.9 cents right now.
00:48:13.600 - 00:48:15.050, Speaker B: 1.9 cents.
00:48:15.470 - 00:48:17.654, Speaker A: He wants a 50% drop in Hex.
00:48:17.782 - 00:48:27.166, Speaker B: There could be SEC brings a case and Hex explodes to $10. Who knows? Trump NFT floor revisits all time high. This is not something I have an opinion on.
00:48:27.188 - 00:48:28.720, Speaker A: David, opinion on that one.
00:48:29.090 - 00:48:32.890, Speaker B: Celestia launches above 1 billion, fully diluted valuation.
00:48:33.050 - 00:48:38.286, Speaker A: If Celestia does launch, it will certainly be above a $1 billion fully diluted valuation.
00:48:38.478 - 00:48:39.106, Speaker B: How about this?
00:48:39.128 - 00:48:58.680, Speaker A: 116. Taproot adoption doubles and hits 3%. Okay, I'm not sure if this is a real prediction. This is actually Eric Wall just being mean about taproot and bitcoiners. He's just saying that Taproot adoption doubles and that means it's going to hit 3%. He's just being mean in that one. No new Bitcoin soft fork agree.
00:48:59.050 - 00:49:06.700, Speaker B: Yeah, that's probably a pretty easy one. Look at this one's. Hard, though. 18. Cardano finally drops out of the top ten. I'm not sure I could say that.
00:49:08.510 - 00:49:28.722, Speaker A: It's at number nine right now, Ryan, and it's got polygon on its heels at number ten. But the next biggest thing that I believe in that follows after that is Lido, and that's at number twelve. And so the Lido market cap right now is $6 billion.
00:49:28.856 - 00:49:39.362, Speaker B: I think this is hard to define because of course, it's going to fall out of the top ten at least once next year. Easy slam dunk. But does he mean for a sustained period of time? You know what I mean? Or fall permanently?
00:49:39.506 - 00:49:42.870, Speaker A: I think he's implying it stays out of the top ten.
00:49:43.020 - 00:49:47.526, Speaker B: That's what I think he's implying. I don't think that's going to happen.
00:49:47.548 - 00:49:53.478, Speaker A: There's not cardano contenders. Yeah, cardano's got $9 billion valuation.
00:49:53.574 - 00:50:00.682, Speaker B: Somebody'd have to replace Cardano right now. And it's like right now a lot of these top ten are trading on meme power. Who has the meme power to replace it?
00:50:00.736 - 00:50:09.882, Speaker A: Yeah, we would need another stablecoin to make its way to the top ten. That could happen. A stablecoin die could pump could knock Cardano out anyways.
00:50:10.026 - 00:50:16.162, Speaker B: Die. That'd be big. Risk zero changes the game for ZK roll ups. Enables smart conte with that risk zero.
00:50:16.296 - 00:50:23.662, Speaker A: Risk zero. It's an EVM parallelization. I think startup Ashley Shap was explaining it to me in ECC.
00:50:23.806 - 00:50:25.590, Speaker B: This must be something Eric invested in.
00:50:25.660 - 00:50:26.280, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:27.690 - 00:50:29.110, Speaker B: Sorry, Eric. Maybe not.
00:50:29.180 - 00:50:35.160, Speaker A: Ethereum layer two TVL reaches above $10 billion. I want to say yes to that.
00:50:35.610 - 00:50:36.326, Speaker B: Definitely yes.
00:50:36.348 - 00:50:37.254, Speaker A: I want to say yes to that.
00:50:37.292 - 00:50:38.134, Speaker B: No, I'm a hell yes.
00:50:38.172 - 00:50:39.014, Speaker A: We have a long way to go.
00:50:39.052 - 00:50:39.654, Speaker B: Seven right now.
00:50:39.692 - 00:50:41.594, Speaker A: No, we're at four. We're at four right now.
00:50:41.632 - 00:50:45.642, Speaker B: Four? Okay. Well, we've been near before. We've been close to seven.
00:50:45.696 - 00:50:48.780, Speaker A: That's why I remember that. I think it can hit 10 billion. Yeah.
00:50:49.150 - 00:50:53.334, Speaker B: Lightning Network public channel capacity stays below ten k. So he's bearish on lightning?
00:50:53.382 - 00:51:07.090, Speaker A: Yes, he's always been yes. Oh, wow. Coming in at 22, Larry and Frank leave the block and start their own competitor. Wow, that is a hot prediction at this point. This has to just be meme predictions.
00:51:08.310 - 00:51:10.338, Speaker B: I mean, I think they could.
00:51:10.424 - 00:51:20.406, Speaker A: I think they could. They seem to really care about their jobs and care about the block. But there was that drama. At the end of the year, this.
00:51:20.428 - 00:51:24.678, Speaker B: Turns out to be decent call. Both Lido and Coin will ten x at least.
00:51:24.844 - 00:51:31.690, Speaker A: Yeah, and he agrees with this is also Djen Spartans bags is Lido and Coinbase.
00:51:32.590 - 00:51:33.834, Speaker B: What's this number? 24.
00:51:33.872 - 00:51:55.870, Speaker A: David, I think we are man, we're really getting into the bottom of the barrel. Predictions from Eric Kobe tweets comments JFC more than eight times with 1000 likes each, probably suzu. And Kyle Davis Davies miraculously become influential. Bitcoin maximalists. I could totally see, honestly. Yeah. Vitalik graduates from crypto after Ethereum's migration to proof of stake.
00:51:55.870 - 00:52:12.502, Speaker A: Vitalik will feel like he owes both it to Ethereum and himself to step back slightly. Probably by taking up a few non crypto responsibilities like AI or charity. I don't know if it's 2023 that Vitalik does something like this, but I can totally see, like yeah, I could totally see this.
00:52:12.556 - 00:52:33.706, Speaker B: Yeah, not quite yet, in my opinion, but I think this last part taking up a few non crypto responsibilities. I could totally see that. But graduating from crypto is too strong, I don't think. So rehypothecation of ETH, stake becomes cool. It's called restaking and liquid staking. We'll see a lot more of this. Yeah, of course that will happen.
00:52:33.706 - 00:52:35.522, Speaker B: Nova Grass doesn't get any new tattoos.
00:52:35.526 - 00:52:45.360, Speaker A: Yes, he does not get tattoos. Or at least he doesn't tweet about it. 29. Doe Kwan is caught. I don't know. He's in Serbia. He's like in the place that you can't catch him in.
00:52:46.710 - 00:52:49.060, Speaker B: He can catch anybody anywhere, don't you think?
00:52:49.750 - 00:52:51.618, Speaker A: Who's coming after him? I don't know.
00:52:51.624 - 00:52:53.998, Speaker B: If anyone know he's not going to get caught.
00:52:54.174 - 00:53:00.230, Speaker A: I'm saying I'm not red notice, man. Oh, that's right. All I'm saying is I'm not betting my net worth on it.
00:53:00.380 - 00:53:06.082, Speaker B: All right, last one a bit late, but Luke Dash Jr. Loses his bitcoin.
00:53:06.226 - 00:53:08.520, Speaker A: This is how you knock about that later. Yeah.
00:53:09.130 - 00:53:26.350, Speaker B: All right. Well, what are the bankless predictions, David? I think we're maybe less spicy with some of those. But first, before we get to the 2022 predictions, we should get to our 2023 predictions. We should get to last year's predictions and give a report card. Here how'd we do in our layup predictions for last year.
00:53:26.500 - 00:53:32.480, Speaker A: So, Ryan, you and I, this time last year were bullish, and it was also the top.
00:53:33.890 - 00:53:35.954, Speaker B: Sounds like you're justifying something.
00:53:36.152 - 00:53:57.906, Speaker A: I'm just saying we were bullish when it was the top. And so all of our bullish predictions are so crypto crosses new all time highs. That did not happen. These are our layup predictions. And so these were the ones that we all kind of felt were true as a company. We all kind of came together and it's like, all right, what are the easy ones? We didn't do so great. Crypto crosses new all time highs.
00:53:57.906 - 00:54:11.230, Speaker A: Did not get that one. ETH two merge happens. That totally happened. Total crypto market cap reaches $5 trillion. We only hit 3 trillion. So we did not get that one bitcoin. Gets adopted by another nation state.
00:54:11.230 - 00:54:15.120, Speaker A: We got that one, but I will say just barely. Car. What's? Car.
00:54:18.610 - 00:54:22.362, Speaker B: It's a country in Africa. So this is Central African Republic.
00:54:22.426 - 00:54:22.750, Speaker A: Okay.
00:54:22.820 - 00:54:23.486, Speaker B: Adopted it.
00:54:23.508 - 00:54:29.698, Speaker A: In June, Ethereum becomes a trillion dollar network. We didn't get there. We only got to about zero point 56.
00:54:29.784 - 00:54:30.574, Speaker B: Half a trillion.
00:54:30.622 - 00:54:31.294, Speaker A: Half a trillion.
00:54:31.342 - 00:54:31.554, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:31.592 - 00:54:51.258, Speaker A: Layer two reaches $25 billion in total locked value. We only got to seven oof NFT sales hit $30 billion, which totally happened. It hit $30 billion. By April 1, D five protocol will reach the top ten in market cap. We are almost there. But it did not happen.
00:54:51.424 - 00:54:52.620, Speaker B: Wait, with what?
00:54:53.310 - 00:54:55.498, Speaker A: Lido. Oh, okay.
00:54:55.664 - 00:54:57.498, Speaker B: Fair. That did almost happen.
00:54:57.584 - 00:55:05.520, Speaker A: Yeah. And Dows will make an eight figure purchase for an in real life item. I don't really think that happened.
00:55:05.890 - 00:55:22.114, Speaker B: No, it didn't happen. But we're giving ourselves again, we're grading this report card, David, so we can be nice to ourselves. So we're giving ourselves partial credit for this because Ukraine Dow legitimately bought, obviously, tons of military gear, and it was almost eight figures. It was something like $8 million. Right.
00:55:22.152 - 00:55:26.306, Speaker A: But the item that was bought was an NFT of A. Yeah.
00:55:26.408 - 00:55:28.242, Speaker B: Partial credit. All right. Partial credit.
00:55:28.296 - 00:55:34.950, Speaker A: Wow. We're really being lenient here. And then the last one, of course, Michael Saylor buys more bitcoin. That was just a free space. He totally.
00:55:35.690 - 00:55:39.334, Speaker B: That was very easy. All right, Ryan. Predictions. I did worse than is.
00:55:39.372 - 00:55:43.702, Speaker A: Okay, now we're getting into Ryan's specific predictions here's. Ryan's predictions.
00:55:43.846 - 00:55:52.794, Speaker B: Also, I said crypto would be above 7 trillion and it only reached 3 trillion, so I was overly bullish. I said ETH would get to ten k. And by the way, that's what all of this was based.
00:55:52.832 - 00:55:53.742, Speaker A: That was on the bull market.
00:55:53.796 - 00:56:18.450, Speaker B: Yeah, look, I mean the basis was I thought we would do another ten X from last all time high, which was in the 1000 zone, and we didn't. We only hit 4.5K. Doesn't mean ten X isn't happening. It means it didn't happen in 2022 and probably won't in 2023. Layer twos, enter the top ten. I think that's a yes, if you count polygon, which I do. Bridges to billions.
00:56:18.450 - 00:56:24.982, Speaker B: So across and hop issue tokens bridges. I was more bullish on bridges going into 2022.
00:56:25.116 - 00:56:27.330, Speaker A: Cross layer two bridges specifically.
00:56:27.490 - 00:56:43.470, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Bitcoin to only hit sixty three k. This should actually be an X. I don't know why that's a check. Web three gets social. We had some launches, Farcaster lens diesel. It's still too early for web3 to really succeed on.
00:56:43.540 - 00:56:44.718, Speaker A: We're punting on that one.
00:56:44.804 - 00:56:48.126, Speaker B: David I said DeFi would return. It definitely did not return.
00:56:48.308 - 00:56:48.702, Speaker A: Okay.
00:56:48.756 - 00:56:56.942, Speaker B: And yet David, it did serve us when CFI failed, and that's a big plus. I thought there'd be some crypto banks that would IPO.
00:56:57.006 - 00:57:01.220, Speaker A: Nope, we almost got that one with circle and then the SEC said no.
00:57:01.670 - 00:57:17.890, Speaker B: So there you go. Blocked by the SEC. Dows get weirder. I'll count Ukraine as kind of a weird dow know, fighting a war for a dow. That's kind of interesting. NFTs add extensions. What I meant is that they would expand into other media properties.
00:57:17.890 - 00:57:39.854, Speaker B: Board Ape Yacht Club definitely did that. I thought GameFi would build a niche. It didn't. Way too early. Overall, my grade is a C minus, and I think this is because I expected the bull cycle to have about 50% more upside than it did. But by April, the fed was tightening. And then after April, just everything unwound as the tide was coming out.
00:57:39.854 - 00:57:43.070, Speaker B: And apparently no one had shorts on in crypto.
00:57:43.890 - 00:57:48.190, Speaker A: You didn't expect everyone to be completely immature and irresponsible.
00:57:48.350 - 00:58:00.740, Speaker B: Well, I didn't. And I think some of these predictions just don't take into account macro. Right. Because we kind of ignore it, because who knows what's going to happen with macro. So that's what messed me up this year. I'm being more cautious. David sure.
00:58:00.740 - 00:58:05.250, Speaker B: I think there's going to be a lot of ups and downs in crypto, but we're going to finish above 2 trillion.
00:58:05.330 - 00:58:07.170, Speaker A: That is more than a two X, brother.
00:58:07.330 - 00:58:26.058, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's ahead, but there'll be ups and downs. ETH withdrawals will be enabled. That's probably an easy one. But I also am hopeful for proto Dank Sharding in 2023. Now that's going to be hard to hit. If it happens, it'll be down to the wire. I think ETH will spike down to three digits.
00:58:26.058 - 00:58:35.150, Speaker B: Sorry, David. If it does, that will give us one last final generational buying opportunity, because I don't think we're going back to three digits again.
00:58:35.220 - 00:58:35.774, Speaker A: It's not happening.
00:58:35.812 - 00:58:53.954, Speaker B: I can't tell you for sure if that's going to happen, but I think it is. I'll err on that side. Ethereum outperforms bitcoin. But we don't get a flipping next year. A crypto law almost gets through Congress. It won't be the end of the world, it'll just be something watered down. I am super bullish on layer two still, David.
00:58:53.954 - 00:59:09.834, Speaker B: This is probably the biggest call, the biggest reach here. I think layer twos reach 25 billion. Eric Wall called for 10 billion. I'm seeing 25 billion in TVL. All right, that's bullish I just carried over. I copied and pasted from last year. Right.
00:59:09.834 - 00:59:29.250, Speaker B: It's going to happen. And if it doesn't happen next year, I'll just copy and paste and it'll happen in 2024. DFI rebuilds back to TVL of 125,000,000,000. We'd have a ways to go there. I think that's like a four or five X or something like that. So those are some of my predictions. What do you got? Do your report card first.
00:59:29.320 - 00:59:39.734, Speaker A: All right, here's my report card. I led with the bear market never comes. I don't think there's a phrase I could have phrased that by and not been more wrong, David. So that was wrong.
00:59:39.772 - 00:59:41.430, Speaker B: So you were a super cycler.
00:59:43.210 - 00:59:55.258, Speaker A: Dude. We had just broken off into all time highs. We had just hit all time highs and the momentum was continuing. I had the east to ten K mindslide just like everyone else. I was dishing out that koolaid, but.
00:59:55.264 - 00:59:57.146, Speaker B: You said it this way, which is different.
00:59:57.248 - 01:00:21.698, Speaker A: The bear market never comes. The bear market definitely comes. My next comment was crypto newbies care less about centralization worries. And I'm claiming victory on that one because what did we learn? Celsius FTX like exchanges, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But I'm also betting on the complete opposite for 2023, so I'm going to take the victory on that one. The merch happened. Got that one right.
01:00:21.698 - 01:00:27.950, Speaker A: ETH competitors try to fix their monetary supply schedules. I have not seen any lick of that whatsoever.
01:00:28.030 - 01:00:29.414, Speaker B: All of these still not.
01:00:29.532 - 01:01:03.614, Speaker A: Still not yeah. I'm claiming all of these ETH competitors still have currently their heads buried in the sand about the oversupply of block space and therefore oversupply of token issuance schedules. Solid fee markets arise on an ETH competing chain. That did happen for a moment on avalanche and then it went back to zero. My next prediction was optimism and Arbitrum develop into thriving metropolises, and I think that happened definitely big time. And I also thought that EVM equivalence will push optimism into dominance. Didn't happen in 2022, but I'm still holding out for this one.
01:01:03.614 - 01:01:32.538, Speaker A: I think EVM equivalence is the long game and optimism has been pioneering that NFT flipping loses steam definitely did. Yeah, definitely did. Retail ran out of money, so it became less profitable for everyone. I made a claim that Rye receives adoption tailwinds. This was during inflation, big inflation moments. And so I said, as a result of inflation, rye will receive adoption tailwinds. I will say that Rye certainly received mindshare adoption, but that did not translate into real adoption at all.
01:01:32.538 - 01:01:33.018, Speaker A: No.
01:01:33.104 - 01:01:35.114, Speaker B: Unfortunate. Because it's a really cool project.
01:01:35.232 - 01:02:01.490, Speaker A: Yeah. Board apes Flips Punks I predicted that. And I also linked to a video because why did Board apes flip Punks? Because security like properties did. I just trigger a bunch of board apes. Then go watch the video that's linked. In the release that we're talking about right now, web Three will become adopted as a household name. That kind of happened, but not really in a way that I wanted it to.
01:02:01.640 - 01:02:04.002, Speaker B: Yeah, it's definitely a household name.
01:02:04.056 - 01:02:23.500, Speaker A: And then the last three predictions I made, the bankless meme picks up speed. That happened because of FTX. So thanks for that. Politicians rise to defend Web Three Protocols. Tom, Emmer and Pat Toomey shout out to you guys for helping me be right on that one. And then Bankless keeps delivering. This was one I was in control over.
01:02:23.950 - 01:02:25.162, Speaker B: That's a free space.
01:02:25.296 - 01:02:33.594, Speaker A: That's a good one. And we got a lot of things coming out more. So I was given a grade by our newsletter editor, a B.
01:02:33.792 - 01:02:39.230, Speaker B: That's good, David. Some good predictions there. So what do you have in mind for this year? What's your 2023 predictions?
01:02:39.730 - 01:03:03.942, Speaker A: My first and foremost prediction centers around Ethereum Scaling Factor, and this is this metric that is being pioneered by layer two beat ethereum's current Scaling factor is 2.4. As in all of layer twos are doing 2.4 times the amount of transactions of the ethereum layer one. I think we are going to see that number increase to five. So there will be five times the number of transactions on ethereum layer twos as the ethereum layer one.
01:03:04.076 - 01:03:07.398, Speaker B: I think that's safe. I definitely think that's happening.
01:03:07.564 - 01:03:32.560, Speaker A: At least one generalized ZKE EVM will open up its playground for users. So this is ZK Sync. This is scroll. But I do think the StarkNet ecosystem will maintain its lead ahead of the rest of the Zkevms collectible. NFT communities will increasingly look like belagi's network stake thesis. And the only ones that are going to make it through this bear market will survive by injecting utility into their assets. That's my hot take there.
01:03:32.560 - 01:03:43.842, Speaker A: Ethereum DeFi blue chips will outperform alt layer one tokens and layer two tokens by the way, for that matter, because Ethereum DFI has already been in a bear market one year ahead of everyone.
01:03:43.896 - 01:03:49.254, Speaker B: Wow, that's maybe your boldest prediction yet because we've had two back to back 80% down years.
01:03:49.372 - 01:04:25.226, Speaker A: Well, maybe we have an 80% down year in blue chips and DFI actually has an up year in that. Dows still will not have their shit together figured out probably most Dows will continue to operate at a loss in a this is fine while the room is burning manner. One or a few Dows will attempt to focus on their PNL and that will eventually come to be reflected in their token price. Whether that happens by the end of 2023, hard to say. I always like to say. Ryan on Bankless, there's always a bull market somewhere and I think this one will be signed in with Ethereum. This will be a current reoccurring topic throughout 2023 as we see more websites with.
01:04:25.268 - 01:04:27.790, Speaker B: How do we measure that, though? There's not really like a token.
01:04:27.870 - 01:05:03.322, Speaker A: You just think number of instances of logins with private keys, logins instances with private keys. And then the last three here bitcoin maxis will continue to become more and more insane and disconnected from reality. Corey Clipston specifically will spearhead this effort. Nice job. Dual encroachment from the CFTC and the SEC will push crypto into its only safe place, the intangible land of decentralization. Aka they're coming for us and the only way out is through decentralization. And then lastly, Richard Hart will still be here.
01:05:03.322 - 01:05:18.218, Speaker A: He'll find a new scam to promote after Pulse chain wears off. And also, Ryan, did you know that his last name was Shuler? I have no that is Richard Hart's real last name. Doesn't Google okay, yeah, it doesn't have the same ring as Hart.
01:05:18.314 - 01:05:40.646, Speaker B: No, Hart's a great last name if you're trying to pump a Ponzi scheme. So that's good, David. We'll see how that plays out then. Man so those are the 2023 predictions for you. Bankless gets some of these things right, directionally, I think we are right when we call for specifics. Not so much not so great, but directionally. And eventually some of these predictions will happen.
01:05:40.748 - 01:05:44.140, Speaker A: The longer we're here, the more right we are. That's right.
01:05:44.590 - 01:05:48.266, Speaker B: Optimism. This week, a bunch of people are forking it. What does this mean?
01:05:48.368 - 01:06:19.234, Speaker A: Yeah, so this is a tweet from an optimism person. Another day, another startup planning to fork optimism. The op stack narrative is very strong. From my startup data sample, it's becoming the go to repo for startups to deploy their own roll up. And so this is actually a continuation of the thesis that I said that EVM equivalents will help optimism with its slower start. And for those, I made this video called The Op Stack, which explains the Op Stack and the philosophy behind this prediction. It came out the day that FTX went under.
01:06:19.234 - 01:06:28.040, Speaker A: So there's this super awesome video that is super informative that got drowned out by the FTX debacle. So if you want to go down the Op Stack rabbit hole, definitely watch this video.
01:06:28.810 - 01:06:47.546, Speaker B: We got some NFT stuff too. So a zombie punk was just sold for what looks like, to me anyway, a lot of money. But maybe this is down from what it was worth at some point in time. $1.3 million for this punk. You're looking at it right here. What's the significance of this sale, David?
01:06:47.658 - 01:07:06.702, Speaker A: It's just one of the biggest NFT sales in a very long time. I accidentally said when we led into sponsors that a Zombie Punk got stolen. No, a Zombie Punk got sold, but it was a steal. Coming in at a 1155 ETH price tag, we got a Zombie punk. And so that, in my mind, is very cheap. That is a good purchase.
01:07:06.766 - 01:07:09.410, Speaker B: And are they up on their ETH from that sale?
01:07:10.230 - 01:07:13.318, Speaker A: The owner click that link and we'll be able to find out what it.
01:07:13.324 - 01:07:14.374, Speaker B: Was last bought for.
01:07:14.412 - 01:07:29.046, Speaker A: Yeah. So if you scroll down to previous sales okay. It was last sold, Ryan, for 500 ETH in May of 2021. So they are up 660 ETH on that trade.
01:07:29.158 - 01:07:56.658, Speaker B: That's the way to be up denominated in ETH. You denominate neith during the bear market. That's the only way to do it. This was an article I noticed I don't know if you saw this, but from PC Gamer, it got a lot of traction on Reddit, and the title of the article is good Job, Internet. You bullied NFTs out of mainstream games. And I saw so many threads on Reddit this week about, yeah, I'm glad they're gone hate NFTs, glad they're the worst. They're kind of a scourge on gaming.
01:07:56.658 - 01:08:30.000, Speaker B: And I was just reflecting on how just negative the world has turned on NFTs, particularly NFTs in games. This was a meme I also picked out from Reddit, which was whose opinion Matters the Least? And it picks on all of these tribes, furries Weebs Influencers, Discord Mobs, and then Crypto Bros, too, and NFT artists. And look who's in the crypto bro picture. It's Vitalik. Wow. Vitalik is the least crypto bro person like I know. I guess if that's what you think a crypto bro actually is.
01:08:30.000 - 01:08:33.802, Speaker B: Anyway, I was just reflecting on this, Ryan.
01:08:33.866 - 01:08:40.750, Speaker A: I'm going to go ahead and guess that any representative in any one of these quadrants are probably saying the same thing about their quadrant.
01:08:40.830 - 01:09:04.650, Speaker B: That's probably true, right? We just don't know. And I was just reflecting on I remember the early stages of the Internet, and there was this new idea. This is like kind of the birth of Wikipedia and reviews, Amazon reviews and Yelp and all of these things. Web two. It's like wisdom of the crowds. You remember that phrase, wisdom of the crowds? Well, Internet mobs are kind of dumb. Stupidity of the crowds.
01:09:04.650 - 01:09:32.050, Speaker B: And so this is just another example of the Internet, I think, not getting it and not seeing the potential of these things and people making comments on things they actually don't know about. And, yeah, I think the Internet is completely wrong about NFTs. It's just like being mad about a file format like JPEGs or Gifs. Maybe you don't like how they've been used, but how can you be mad about NFTs as a property rights mechanism.
01:09:32.630 - 01:09:55.942, Speaker A: I think it's actually pretty easy to push back on that one because the NFTs in their current form are not doing the things, Ryan, that you imagine that they will do in their heads in the future. And so the Internet is currently pushing back on NFTs as they stand today because we as an industry have not learned how to actually produce an NFT that is actually desirable towards mainstream.
01:09:56.006 - 01:10:18.850, Speaker B: So your take is, well, we haven't actually deserved their respect. Exactly correct. And you also say that about drawing boards, the crypto bro scape too, because that's also being scapegoated right now. The crypto, a bunch of scammers, that sort of thing. Right. Do you think that crypto deserves this too, this kind of mockery? Or do you think a broad brush.
01:10:19.190 - 01:10:48.906, Speaker A: To talk about this meme at a high level whose opinion matters least, like NFT artists, Andrew Tate fans, crypto, bros, Weebs, discord mods influencers, these are all like, communities of people that have members of them that believe in what they're saying and doing, for better or worse. Right. And you could also put in a CrossFit person here or a vegan or somebody who has principles that they stand on and are annoying on the Internet about it. And so this is just an amalgamation of all of those people.
01:10:49.008 - 01:11:02.062, Speaker B: That's a good take. That's a good take. Anyway. Yeah. The Internet still doesn't like NFTs. Maybe we deserve it, maybe we don't. But I think this warrants further investigations, probably some upside opportunities, while everyone else is ignoring it.
01:11:02.062 - 01:11:05.518, Speaker B: David, what's this story about the bitcoin core developer losing all his bitcoin?
01:11:05.614 - 01:11:28.600, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's this bitcoin OG core developer Luke Dash Jr. Who tweeted out that he lost over his bitcoins over 200 bitcoins in a hack. He had a PGP, pretty good privacy. If you have been listening to our four bitcoin series, you would know what that is. He says his PGP was compromised and he had all of his bitcoin stolen. He says he has no idea how.
01:11:28.600 - 01:11:50.554, Speaker A: And there's two kind of main takes that I've seen as a response to this. It's what the hell is a bitcoin core dev holding on PGP keys onto a hot computer that is exposed to the Internet? That's bad OpSec. And then the other take is like, ha, nice boating accident, bro. No one really knows.
01:11:50.682 - 01:11:57.940, Speaker B: There's also another take, which is like, if a bitcoin core developer can lose their private keys, what hope is there for Normies? What do you think about that take?
01:11:59.910 - 01:12:20.518, Speaker A: I mean, I've definitely at times held private keys in insecure ways, but I've always logged that in my head and then like, okay, I need to get rid of those private keys. I don't know. It's a personal responsibility thing more than it is. Like, if this one guy can't do it, none of us can. And then also the solution to that is always innovation, innovation, innovation. Bitcoin doesn't have account abstraction.
01:12:20.614 - 01:12:33.450, Speaker B: No, I'm super bullish on the future. Smart contract wallets to make UX easy. And yeah, I think we'll build them. What about this, David? OpenSea blocking Cuban artists from the platform due to US. Sanctions. What do you make of this?
01:12:33.520 - 01:12:54.802, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the headlines, basically the news. OpenSea had to deplatform some Cuban artists because of sanctions. It's a sad day. A lot of people are mad at Openc for this, but at the end of the day, they want customers. They want every customer under the sun. Why can't they do this? Because of regulation. This is the design choice that Openc has chosen, like a Web 2.5
01:12:54.802 - 01:13:03.286, Speaker A: thing, which centralized front end in the front and just uses ethereum rails in the back. And so this is a result of that. So sad day.
01:13:03.388 - 01:13:26.122, Speaker B: Yeah. It's unfortunate, but as long as these sorts of prohibitions don't happen on the protocol layer, that's where they matter most. Right. So NFTs can still be deployed within Cuba or wherever you are in the world, and you can access it. Just can't access openc. Unfortunately. All right, for the first time in 2023, we're going to remind you that this is the year you should be getting a job in crypto.
01:13:26.186 - 01:13:27.386, Speaker A: We're not, David.
01:13:27.578 - 01:13:45.602, Speaker B: We're not stopping. We've got some jobs. I'm going to read them on the bankless job boards. As usual, it's bankless palette.com jobs. Uniswap Labs has a senior software engineer. They're looking for Alchemy, a backend engineer, webacy software engineer, Webacy, also a QA analyst, dimension, a crypto native content marketer, and more.
01:13:45.602 - 01:13:53.270, Speaker B: You guys can find that at the bankless Jobs site. That's bankless palette.com slash jobs. All right, David, what do we got coming up next?
01:13:53.340 - 01:14:21.806, Speaker A: We got to get to some questions from the nation. We used to ask the Twitter we used to ask Twitter, what questions do you have? But we have changed that up, and now we are asking the bankless inner circle. What questions do you want us to cover on the bankless weekly roll up? And so we got three questions that we're pulling out out of the inner circle. And this is a perk for the bankless premium subscribers. If you are a premium subscriber and you are not in the bankless inner circle, you should definitely go there. We've been having a ton of fun there lately. And this is where we are now asking the questions for the weekly roll up.
01:14:21.806 - 01:14:36.194, Speaker A: So this is a place where me and Ryan and the rest of the bankless team hang out. This is where the token report that we talked about earlier from Ben Giovi gets talked about and discussed, and you guys can ask all of us questions and more here's. Ryan's got a little bit of the inner circle up on the screen.
01:14:36.232 - 01:15:01.754, Speaker B: I'm sharing it on screen. This is kind of like I think of this as like a watering hole for the bankless community. You know how you always say, David, it's the bear market, so go find a bear market, buddy. This is where you guys find a bear market, buddy. All right. David I met on Twitter, and then that just quickly transitioned into Discord. Discord is a fantastic tool for meeting friends in crypto, especially if you don't go outside like me, or you don't go to conferences or you can't get out there.
01:15:01.754 - 01:15:21.518, Speaker B: You want to meet some people before you go to the conference? This is the place to do that. So there are something like 15,000 close to 20,000 people on the Bankless journey in the Inner Circle Discord. And look at these channels. We talk about general stuff NFTs. We talk about the podcast. We talk about token ratings. There's off topic areas.
01:15:21.518 - 01:15:58.026, Speaker B: David, you and I jumped in and did an AMA in here not too long ago. We've done a few of those as well. So there's a section in the Inner Circle Discord with a question we're going to answer in just a minute from Hashira. Is there a layer two that is IBC compatible? This is Cosmos standard IBC, or would it be possible to build one? Such an L two would remove the need for multisig bridges between different ecosystems and would greatly benefit the entire crypto universe. We are asked questions like this. We answer questions like that in the Inner Circle. So it's a great place to meet the Bankless community and level up on the crypto journey.
01:15:58.026 - 01:16:03.130, Speaker B: And David, how do people become Inner Circle members and go premium?
01:16:03.210 - 01:16:19.266, Speaker A: Sure, there is a link in the show notes for you to go. Click that button, and it'll take you to where you can sign up for Bankless premium, and then you can ask some of these questions here. We're also in the middle of planning our ETH Denver in real life event for the bankless inner circle. It's going to be our first one. We're super stoked for that. Shall we get into the questions? Ryan?
01:16:19.378 - 01:16:28.682, Speaker B: Yeah. So why don't we start with that first question that was just asked? So is there a layer two that is IBC compatible and would it be possible to build one? What's the answer to that question? David? Yeah.
01:16:28.736 - 01:17:11.170, Speaker A: Sadly, this is where the lines are drawn between what Brian and I call different countries. IBC is the rules of the Cosmos ecosystem. The EVM are the rules for the ethereum ecosystem. And sadly, you cannot cross those lines without having to change languages. And what that means is that we cannot cross lines with our assets either without having to have a trusted intermediary in the process facilitate that service. So there is no way to build an IBC layer two, because if you are building a layer two on ethereum, you are specifically creating a very formalized relationship with the ethereum layer one. And you cannot have two layer ones that you consider equal.
01:17:11.170 - 01:17:25.082, Speaker A: You have to pick a single layer one to adhere to the rules towards. So if you are building a layer two on Ethereum, you cannot build an IBC compatible, a Cosmos compatible app chain as your Ethereum layer two. It just doesn't work like that, I'm sad to say.
01:17:25.216 - 01:17:29.066, Speaker B: Is it possible that it will in the future? I mean, is there research on going about this?
01:17:29.088 - 01:18:04.758, Speaker A: I don't think that's possible. I do not think that is a possible thing to do. So this kind of goes back to why you and I are kind of maximalist in the sense of there's going to be a very low number of ecosystems because all of these cross layer one communication bridges are just fundamentally insecure. And so it makes sense from a security perspective for there to be a fewer number of chains that all adhere to the same rules. And that's why Cosmos actually fits inside of a lot of the bankless philosophy that we've been talking about and why the multi, multi layer one thesis just does not work.
01:18:04.924 - 01:18:42.046, Speaker B: Yeah. What's interesting about Cosmos, if you want, like, we did an episode with Zaki and Sonny from Cosmos about this very thing and they talk about this idea of mesh security, which is sort of interesting, where a set of app chains can kind of share the same security in some way. That starts to simulate a little bit what Ethereum is doing. Of course, Ethereum is just saying with its layer two ecosystem, hey, everything is secured by and settles on layer one. So you don't have to worry about that problem of diluting your security when you transition from one chain to the other. With IBC.
01:18:42.158 - 01:19:22.426, Speaker A: This question is from PD. In the inner circle on the return of the bull, ETH becomes significantly deflationary. And at the time a significant amount of ETH is staked, scarcity could be an issue. While good for price, could it be damaging for the system? Is there a mechanism in 1559 to control the level of deflation? And so this is the concern that the ultrasound economics of ether are so good and so strong that ether becomes so scarce that its price is so high that we just don't want to use it inside of DeFi. We don't want to interact with gas. It's just overly deflationary. And this is actually a question that I asked Justin Drake directly.
01:19:22.426 - 01:19:54.342, Speaker A: And so if you want to hear this answer from Justin Drake, there is an interview I did with him on YouTube about this very thing at DevCon. Basically, first and foremost, there is a limit as to how much ether we can burn. As ether goes up in price, you burn less. And so it doesn't just burn straight to zero supply. The more you burn, the harder it becomes to burn more. So the lower supply of ether there is, the more resistance there is to further burn. And so this is why people like Justin Drake thinks that we kind of asymptote somewhere between like 60 and 90 million supply of ether.
01:19:54.342 - 01:20:33.480, Speaker A: And so there will always be enough ether to go around. And then the other thing is like Justin Drake in his answer, delineates between what he calls collateral money and debt money. And collateral money is like ether. Bear assets, bear instruments, and you want collateral money to always go up in price and then you want debt money like dollars to always go down in price. That's kind of how our economy works out because then no one ever gets liquidated if their collateral goes up and their denominated value goes down. And so this is actually the foundations of a very robust economy and there aren't the concerns that there's just not enough ether to go around. Doesn't really actually play out in economic terms.
01:20:33.930 - 01:21:07.298, Speaker B: Yeah, another way to term that is collateral money is like store of value money and debt money is more what you want for a medium of exchange. We don't actually think that ether is going to make a good medium of exchange. Right? Something like a stablecoin is a much better medium of exchange. Something like dai, for instance, or even rye can be a much better medium of exchange than ether. But as ether accrues value and gets more valuable, then it becomes a better collateral money. There's more economic bandwidth. We haven't talked about that concept in a while, but that applies here too.
01:21:07.298 - 01:21:36.300, Speaker B: All right, last question for you, David. This is from cell. Norokos asks he's thinking about or they're thinking about ETH Denver for the first time this year. What's the best way to make the most of it? And this is from a non technical person. So, going to the ETH Denver, that is a conference in February, of course, in the Ethereum community, but really welcomes all ecosystems. If you're non technical, what's the way to make the most out of that type of an experience?
01:21:36.830 - 01:22:07.442, Speaker A: There's a bunch of different answers that I've got for YSL No Rocos. And since you're in the inner Circle discord, I hope to see you at the meetup that we're going to host. So the bankless HQ meetup where you'll be able to meet other members. Generally, people in the bankless community are non technical, so that's a great place to start. But also, I'm also a huge advocate of non technical people joining hackathons, which seems to initially be like, what? That's weird. That's the opposite of what I want to do, let me tell you. Technical people need nontechnical people to explain their shit.
01:22:07.442 - 01:22:49.710, Speaker A: And so if you can market something or promote something or write a presentation and present things that technical devs aren't very good at presenting, there is always a supply gut for nontechnical people joining hackathons to be like the marketers, the promoters to actually do the pitch. And that can really make or break a lot of hackathon projects. So that's definitely a very strong way to get involved there as well. And then overall Denver, east Denver has developed into a more and more and more nontechnical conference, even though it is a hackathon first and foremost. The first East Denver I did in 2018, I just went to every single booth one by one by one, and I was like, hey, what are you guys doing? Hey, what are you guys doing?
01:22:49.780 - 01:22:50.814, Speaker B: You talk to people.
01:22:50.932 - 01:23:18.618, Speaker A: You just talk to people and then you meet other people who are listening to your questions. Because some people are just really shy and they have questions, but they're too shy to answer to ask them, so they'll listen to you ask questions for people at the booth. And if you're asking good questions, people will pick up on that. And so booths are conversation starters. And so that's what I recommend. If you are a non technical person going to ETH Denver, go to the Inner Circle meetup, sign up for the hackathon as a non technical person and.
01:23:18.704 - 01:23:23.114, Speaker B: Talk to people at the booths and talk to everyone. That's probably good advice, right? Yeah.
01:23:23.152 - 01:23:24.320, Speaker A: Come say hi to me.
01:23:25.010 - 01:23:30.394, Speaker B: All right, takes of the week. We got the first one. What are we looking at? From Taha Zaffer.
01:23:30.442 - 01:23:39.758, Speaker A: Taha Zafar. So this is a meme. This is a very old meme. And it's funny to see this resurface. And it's basically a picture of two Legos. One is ether. One is Bitcoin.
01:23:39.758 - 01:24:01.020, Speaker A: And Ether actually has the little Lego dimples that let other Legos latch onto them. And BTC is just completely smooth. And so it's just a funny illustration. I think this meme actually came from the money Legos meme, which I created way back when. I don't know if I can pat myself in the back on that one, but yeah. So this is the money Legos meme, except Bitcoins without the composability part.
01:24:01.550 - 01:24:04.502, Speaker B: Why remind people of this? This Tweet got a lot of traction.
01:24:04.566 - 01:24:09.194, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think people have seen this meme in a very long time. Yeah.
01:24:09.392 - 01:24:12.320, Speaker B: So they're like, oh, this is new. What a great way to articulate it.
01:24:13.090 - 01:24:15.790, Speaker A: This is an old meme. Yeah, this is interesting.
01:24:15.860 - 01:24:55.354, Speaker B: From Domathy. So he says this this is about the Ossification in particular of Ethereum. I think the question is about when is Ethereum going to ossify? So when are all of the changes going to be in the roadmap fully complete and the code is not touched anymore? Domathy says Ossification is a bitcoin meme. In my opinion, the Ethereum equivalent should be homeostasis. The chain self regulates to keep its core properties intact forever through cryptographic means first, then crypto economic means, then through the social layer as a last resort. Really interesting. Really good take.
01:24:55.354 - 01:25:02.938, Speaker B: I think Ossification is out. Homeostasis should be the goal. What's your take on this?
01:25:03.024 - 01:25:24.334, Speaker A: I just thought that this was a really elegant way of differentiating the end game of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin loves to talk about how Ossified it is. And from the ethereum perspective. We consider that, like, fragile. And also, they did it too soon. The homeostasis balance of ethereum. Whenever I hear a biology word in crypto economics, Ryan, you know, I get super excited.
01:25:24.334 - 01:25:51.146, Speaker A: Homeostasis just means imbalance and self regulating. And if something is deviated from a particular set point, then it naturally and organically returns to a homeostatic balance. I just really, really like that. And then also the order of operations of first fix things with cryptography, and if that doesn't work, then do it with crypto economics. And if that doesn't work, then you have to go to the social layer in order to fix something that breaks.
01:25:51.338 - 01:26:09.502, Speaker B: Well, a perfect example of this to me is like, let's say quantum computers come out, and both bitcoin and ethereum need to be quantum resistant. If you're Ossified and the code hasn't changed, how do you become quantum resistant? Well, you really can't. You have to break the obfuscation principle.
01:26:09.566 - 01:26:10.180, Speaker A: Right.
01:26:10.550 - 01:26:47.774, Speaker B: But if you're going for homeostasis, then you acknowledge that the principle of both bitcoin and ethereum is for it to be secure, and obviously that means quantum resistant. And so you upgrade the protocol as necessary to adapt to that new reality. Now, nothing fundamentally has changed about the core values of the system. You're just updating the cryptography, but you can't say it's Ossified if you're still making code changes. And of course, we're going to need to be making code changes for both bitcoin and ethereum moving forward, and I think Ethereum acknowledges that. I really like this mental model homeostasis. I'm going to start using that.
01:26:47.774 - 01:26:51.934, Speaker B: Thank you. Domathy 100%. Here's another take. David, you say this one.
01:26:51.972 - 01:27:08.574, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is a take from Ryan Sean Adams. Let's be clear on one thing. David and I are not journalists. We just like, talking about crypto stuff. Ryan, when you tweeted out this meme, this tweet, I definitely saw the same tweet that you did right before that caused oh, really? Yeah. That inspired you to write this.
01:27:08.632 - 01:27:09.510, Speaker B: What was it?
01:27:09.660 - 01:27:16.134, Speaker A: It was the person who was in our Twitter was like, why doesn't Ryan and David talk about polkadot at some point?
01:27:16.172 - 01:27:18.606, Speaker B: It's like it just doesn't interest journalism.
01:27:18.738 - 01:27:21.510, Speaker A: It's bad journalism. You guys aren't doing your jobs.
01:27:21.670 - 01:27:22.330, Speaker B: Yes.
01:27:22.480 - 01:27:44.270, Speaker A: Who defines what my job is? No one does. And Ryan and I just talk about stuff that we like, and that's like, as people sometimes read into, there's this grand conspiracy as like, we're not covering chainlink and we're not covering polkadot, and we're not covering my favorite ecosystem. What's the conspiracy here?
01:27:44.340 - 01:27:47.226, Speaker B: It could be because we just haven't gotten there, guys, because we're busy.
01:27:47.258 - 01:27:48.118, Speaker A: Yeah, we're super busy.
01:27:48.154 - 01:27:50.210, Speaker B: It could also be just like, we're not interested in the moment.
01:27:50.280 - 01:27:50.946, Speaker A: Right.
01:27:51.128 - 01:28:14.758, Speaker B: But it could also be like this idea. I think of a journalist as something different. It's almost like, in a way, David, a true journalist is doing something even more sacred than you and I are doing what I would say is, what are we? We're just like investors on the crypto journey and the Bankless journey. We care deeply about these values. We're going to talk about them. We're excited by the technology, by what's going on. We're excited about the social movement.
01:28:14.758 - 01:28:35.698, Speaker B: What a journalist does is something different. They need to be getting at kind of like the ultimate facts and truth of circumstances. So even in these roll ups, we're doing our best when we report on things or we talk about things to uncover the truth. But we're not doing like, deep journalistic investigation on the thing.
01:28:35.784 - 01:28:37.106, Speaker A: Just giving our takes.
01:28:37.288 - 01:28:57.382, Speaker B: We're giving our takes. Right. But I have a ton of respect for real journalists and I would love to have more real journalists who are doing the deep work in this space to uncover truth, even if it's uncomfortable, and talk about that truth. It's just not what you and I are doing.
01:28:57.436 - 01:28:58.502, Speaker A: It's not what we do.
01:28:58.636 - 01:29:17.662, Speaker B: I just tweeted this out just to kind of make that clear. I hope that's clear to you Bankless listeners. We try our best on here. We're pursuing what we think is interesting in 2023. It would be a different standard if we started calling ourselves journalists. And I never will. I don't think you ever will either.
01:29:17.662 - 01:29:19.502, Speaker B: It's just not a thing that we are.
01:29:19.556 - 01:29:37.810, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the wrong mental model to consider what Bankless is. Bankless is a thesis driven media company. We have biases and attitudes about the way that we want the future to be. And those biases and attitudes and theses all are enveloped under what we call the Bankless movement.
01:29:38.630 - 01:29:45.638, Speaker B: Absolutely. Well, on that note, David, this is not journalism, of course. This is not the news. But why don't you tell me what you're bullish on?
01:29:45.804 - 01:30:14.910, Speaker A: One of my theses, Ryan, is the flipping. And so I'm bullish on the flipping. One of your 2023 predictions was that the flipping is not going to happen this year. I'm not necessarily going to predict that it is, but I definitely think it's on the table more than what people think that it is. Okay. I think ether versus bitcoin can go up way faster than what people expect because of proof. We are in proof of stake with EIP 1559.
01:30:14.910 - 01:30:30.978, Speaker A: We are in a new paradigm of ether price action. And so the previous coupled relationship that we had with bitcoin from proof of work, I think, is much more broken. And so I tweeted out this tweet. The lappening is going to be ten times easier than the flipping. What's?
01:30:30.994 - 01:30:33.990, Speaker B: The lappening, David. Oh, I'm so glad you asked your private meme.
01:30:34.890 - 01:31:12.174, Speaker A: The flipping is when ether flips bitcoin and market cap, as in with ether as an ecosystem. Ether market cap is worth more than bitcoin. The lappening is when ether is worth two X. What bitcoin is, and what I'm saying here is that it's taken a ton of work to even come remotely close to the flipping. We're like less than 50% of the way there. Although I do think we're closer than we perceive it to be. What I'm saying is, once we do flip bitcoin, when we get to two X bitcoin, which is the lappening, the lappening is when we go two X, the market cap of bitcoin, that is going to be ten times easier than getting to the flipping.
01:31:12.174 - 01:31:16.610, Speaker A: Because once you flip bitcoin, it's so easy just to do it again and again and again.
01:31:16.680 - 01:31:25.506, Speaker B: Can I ask you, why do you care about this for someone thinking like, oh, is this just David's Bag bias? He has much more ETH than he has bitcoin. I don't even know if he has any bitcoin.
01:31:25.538 - 01:31:25.986, Speaker A: Zero bitcoin.
01:31:26.018 - 01:31:27.394, Speaker B: So of course he's talking about ETH.
01:31:27.442 - 01:31:27.846, Speaker A: Right?
01:31:27.948 - 01:31:30.486, Speaker B: Does this matter beyond your bags?
01:31:30.518 - 01:32:07.102, Speaker A: David so this goes back kind of why we made Bankless in the first place is we had theses and ideas about how crypto economics works and we didn't feel like the rest of the crypto world had heard these theses and no one was broadcasting them. And the whole ETH is Money thesis is largely where Bankless started back in 2018. 2019, when you and I were first getting to know each other. The whole ETH is Money thing was a very contrarian bet. And so we came together over that shared frustration. It's like, why don't people understand Ether? Like this protocol also DeFi data. Also DeFi, yeah.
01:32:07.102 - 01:32:46.000, Speaker A: And so the Ether is the best crypto asset of all time, if not the best asset in the world ever is one of our foundational theses that has pioneered our own thinking in this space. And as a result of my belief on that, I have purchased a bunch of Ether because that aligns with my thesis and beliefs about how the future of crypto will be. And so my claim is that the crypto economics of Ethereum is just ten hundred times more sound than bitcoins. And I expect that to show up in the price sooner or later, especially after the merge and proof of stake and EIP 1559.
01:32:46.610 - 01:32:51.678, Speaker B: So this is a bet based on a thesis. How about this? What are we looking at? This tweet?
01:32:51.694 - 01:33:01.438, Speaker A: David right, okay, so there's two charts here and we're looking at the first one. This left chart is how bullish. If you believe in the flipping thesis, this is roughly about how bullish you are.
01:33:01.544 - 01:33:03.538, Speaker B: Ether flips bitcoin, bitcoin ratio.
01:33:03.634 - 01:33:31.022, Speaker A: This is the ETH bit to bitcoin ratio chart and I've drawn a green line at the end to indicate where I believe that we are going. We are currently at zero 74. And I think this is what people who believe in the flipping think that we're going to do, is like, oh, we're going to flip in bitcoin at like, zero. And that will take somewhere between one and three, four more years to get that done. And so that's what this chart shows. This is what the typical flipping error believes. Here's what I believe, Ryan, which is.
01:33:31.076 - 01:33:33.822, Speaker B: What have you done here? Shortened the time range here?
01:33:33.876 - 01:33:59.960, Speaker A: No, I've actually increased the time range. And so this arrow goes all the way out to 2030. But where people think the flipping happens at 00:15 yo, keep going, guys. Because once Ether flips bitcoin, there's no reason why it can't keep going after that. It doesn't stop after flipping bitcoin, we flipped bitcoin a second time and a third time and a fourth time, and it definitely takes time, by the way.
01:34:00.810 - 01:34:06.310, Speaker B: When you put it. The ratio the other way that this could play out is bitcoin collapses.
01:34:06.390 - 01:34:08.954, Speaker A: Sure. It could go down versus Ether for sure.
01:34:08.992 - 01:34:12.682, Speaker B: Do you think that's a possibility? I don't think that worries some people.
01:34:12.736 - 01:34:16.026, Speaker A: I don't think bitcoin collapses. I just think it has a cap on growth.
01:34:16.058 - 01:34:17.390, Speaker B: Stagnant yeah, okay.
01:34:17.460 - 01:34:41.190, Speaker A: Proof of work is fundamentally a cap on growth because as your price of your proof of work token goes up, so does the net average sell pressure. And so the arrow at this point, where it's pointing to Ryan, is at 0.7 ETH to BTC. So that is Ether being worth ten times more than it is right now, in bitcoin terms. So that's five bitcoins. So I'm saying by 2030, Ether is five bitcoins.
01:34:41.690 - 01:34:51.566, Speaker B: You're creating content again about this, too. I watched this video. It's like a 13 minutes video on our other bankless YouTube feed. Did you know we have a bankless YouTube feed?
01:34:51.618 - 01:34:52.678, Speaker A: Two bankless YouTube feed.
01:34:52.694 - 01:35:02.486, Speaker B: This is the bankless podcast that you're listening to, but there's a bankless short video feed. And this is a 13 minutes video about ETH season. Got me bullish, David.
01:35:02.518 - 01:35:03.382, Speaker A: That's my job.
01:35:03.536 - 01:35:10.666, Speaker B: It's fantastic. All right, so, David's, bullish on ETH. That's what I'm bullish on relative to, huh?
01:35:10.698 - 01:35:12.506, Speaker A: Yeah, that's exactly right. What are you bullish on, Ryan?
01:35:12.618 - 01:35:38.614, Speaker B: I'm just being a user again. I get to be a user again this year. Everyone was obsessed with speculation last year, and I'm really excited about using some new tools in crypto. I feel like I have more time to do this. I feel like the builders are continuing to build and the whole narrative is less about speculation, it's more about try new things. This is crypto. It feels very much like 2019 to me, 2020 to me, where we're just, like, trying a whole bunch of things.
01:35:38.614 - 01:36:10.930, Speaker B: So some cool things that I tried recently is I mentioned the Kepler wallet. That is a wallet like MetaMask for exploring the cosmos ecosystem, all the app chains. I recommend that that's a really cool place to start. Also, this, David, I don't know if you've seen this browser extension. It's called fire. But you know that problem that you have where in MetaMask you don't really know when you're clicking on buttons? What is actually happening here? Well, Fire is kind of another extension that explains exactly what's going on. So look at this.
01:36:10.930 - 01:36:24.674, Speaker B: I am transferring this NFT to this particular address. It's explaining in human terms what I'm actually doing. A really useful extension that you can add on top of MetaMask to sort of explain the transaction before you click approve.
01:36:24.722 - 01:36:26.514, Speaker A: So it's an extension for an extension?
01:36:26.642 - 01:36:40.486, Speaker B: It's an extension for an extension, and very useful one at that. Even recently, I was going back through uniswap, and now with uniswap, there's a Fiat on ramp. On top of uniswap, there's NFTs. You can just trade NFTs on uniswap.
01:36:40.678 - 01:36:43.610, Speaker A: Yeah, most people don't realize you can trade NFTs on uniswap.
01:36:43.690 - 01:37:14.520, Speaker B: I almost haven't realized it because I've been so busy not actually getting to use these apps. So, anyway, I just high level here. Everything's great in terms of the tools that are available versus the last bear market, and yet people are down in the dumps. But I think it's a great time to be a user. So ignore price, start using some more apps. This is what we do during the bear market, is we level up on these sorts of things, and as always, there's rewards on the other side. So I'm bullish about being a user again and having that opportunity.
01:37:14.520 - 01:37:20.434, Speaker B: Yeah, I hope you get some time to do that, too. Try some things out this year, David.
01:37:20.482 - 01:37:25.334, Speaker A: Yeah, I have to take a break from making content. Usually I just ask other people's experiences.
01:37:25.462 - 01:37:28.874, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. All right, what do we got? Meme of the Week this year?
01:37:28.912 - 01:37:51.570, Speaker A: Meme of the week. Meme of the week. Okay, so we have a picture of SBF in a nice suit and a backpack. And I'm not going to bother to try and sing this, but you can hear it in the background. Making my way downtown? Scamming fast made luna crash, I'm homebound. I don't know how the song goes, but you can hear it right now, and just like, it's so perfect. Hearing this music, looking at this picture is so great.
01:37:51.640 - 01:38:03.346, Speaker B: There we go, guys. Your first roll up of 2023. Hope you enjoyed it. Hope you enjoyed the Meme of the Week. We're excited to bring 51 more to you in the coming year. Risks and disclaimers, as always. Got to let you know that crypto is risky.
01:38:03.346 - 01:38:15.160, Speaker B: So is DFI. So is ETH. You could definitely lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us once again for another year on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
01:38:15.160 - 01:38:55.730, Speaker B: When I was a bun but a butter? But I never? But never mind. Never, but never, never put it but do boom bow.
