00:00:00.250 - 00:00:34.500, Speaker A: What exactly is Arbitrum doing? Right? The major theme is that, like, this is a super collaborative and largely kind of community driven sort of effort. They're focusing on the right things, growing organically. There are so many different sort of game changers that have come out of this. You know, I think from a technology perspective, you know, I think the other part of that is everyone who's come here to build on top of the Arbitrum network for us, all the games, a network is kind of dead without, you know, DApps and protocols and things that are coming here. And so I think there is that sort of flywheel network effect that is coming out from just having a thriving sort of ecosystem that is growing and building together.
