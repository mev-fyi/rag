00:00:06.890 - 00:00:27.014, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone, to this fantastic episode. We are super excited to bring Justin Blau, who just set a record setting NFT sale. If you don't know what NFTs are, how they can empower creator communities, creator economies, and disrupt the entire music industry, this is the episode to watch. David, tee up this episode for us. Yeah.
00:00:27.052 - 00:01:17.390, Speaker B: Justin Blau has been experimenting in the world of crypto for years now, and one of those experiments landed really, really well, selling over $12 million in these NFT things. We get into what that process was like and what these NFT things are with Justin. And I think the biggest takeaway that I got out of this episode was how Justin thinks these NFT tokens on Ethereum represent tools of emotional connection between an artist and their fans and how this feedback loop can be established between these two groups of people, the value creators and the value consumers. That really just disintermediates a lot of the legacy platforms that we note as the platforms that historically have allowed artists to distribute their art. But now things are changing because of this new revolution in NFTs.
00:01:17.550 - 00:01:42.294, Speaker A: Guys, before we bring you this episode, want to give a special shout out to the sponsors that made this conversation possible. Gemini, check them out. Ave Monolith and Quenza exchanged by synthetic. Thank you to these sponsors for making this episode possible. Okay, let's get into the conversation with Blau. All right, bankless nation. We are here with Justin Blau, more commonly known as the artist Blau.
00:01:42.294 - 00:02:09.526, Speaker A: He just had the largest NFT sale in history, in human history. Human recorded history, that is. He sold 33 NFTs in the collection, one for more than 3.6 million, a total of almost $12 million. Blau's got a fantastic history in crypto. He also, I found this interesting, studied finance in school, and now he's bringing some of that experience into his music career. I'd call him more than electronic music producer now.
00:02:09.526 - 00:02:16.534, Speaker A: He's become almost a crypto entrepreneur. Justin Blau, welcome to the bankless podcast, man. We're really excited to have you.
00:02:16.652 - 00:02:22.842, Speaker C: Thanks for having me. I've heard such great things. I've actually listened to a couple of episodes in the past, and it's just an honor to be here.
00:02:22.976 - 00:02:49.060, Speaker A: Dude, we are excited. You know what? We got to start here because you have made some history. This is NFT history, and we're just getting set up for a killer crazy 2021 here. Before we started recording, you were almost like on tech support with a bunch of your friends. Almost like Ethereum tech support, guiding them through the process of setting up nfts. But you just sold 12 million worth of NFTs. How momentous is this? How does it feel?
00:02:49.510 - 00:03:27.978, Speaker C: It feels amazing. And as someone who's been invested in the distributed ledger tech space since 2014, 2015, 12 million is such a huge number, and everyone's going to be attracted to that number. But I'm way more excited about the statement that we made to the legacy entertainment world. That is really what I'm excited about. If we had done 1 million, 3 million, that's cool. But the fact that we basically trumped, and this is statistically true, we basically trumped any single album deal raise from any major label ever with this sale is pretty incredible. And it didn't even have a grant of rights.
00:03:27.978 - 00:04:23.086, Speaker C: So I think the number one record deal ever was Michael Jackson, and I think it was a $250,000,000 record deal, but for many, many albums, right? So the fact that we sold one album only as collectible editions of that album for close to $12 million breaks a lot of records in a lot of ways. And to me, that's the statement that I was most excited to make. Not the fact that it was $12 million, but the fact that the music industry is ripe for disruption. An industry that has taken over 88% of its revenue and profit from the artists. Right. Artists statistically only receive about 12% of all the money generated in the music business. This is an insane statistic, right? And so when I was first introduced to blockchain technology and its potential for disinterior intermediation, it was so obvious to me that the industry that I knew and love could so easily be destroyed, or at least the legacy model of which could be destroyed by this nascent, amazing technology.
00:04:23.086 - 00:05:21.234, Speaker C: And so I started exploring that in 2017 more deeply, but was just genuinely enthralled by this idea of frictionless value transfer and permissionless value transfer 24/7 with the original concept of bitcoin, that to me, was unbelievable. Having studied finance in college, I studied economics and derivatives, index and equity derivatives, those were my focuses in college. And so everything that applies in the distributed ledger world made a lot of sense for me to think about how this technology would apply to my passion, which is music. And I tried to bridge both of my most passionate interests over the past six years, and it kind of all came together for this particular NFT auction. People say that he did it in 48 hours, when the reality it was maybe more like seven years of studying and four years of execution to get to where we were last weekend. So, yeah, that's kind of the is.
00:05:21.272 - 00:05:50.846, Speaker A: We'Re going to touch on so many of those themes. And it appears like David and I, as we were taking a look at what you've done in this space that you've just tried a series of experiments, right. And you've kind of refined each of those experiments and those evolutions. We're going to go through some of that history. We also want to talk about the statement that is being made to the existing music industry, what that statement is. But let's go back to, I guess not last weekend, but the weekend before during the auction, because this was kind of an interesting auction. So set the scene for us.
00:05:50.846 - 00:06:14.770, Speaker A: Right. So auction starts on Thursday. This is for 33 or so NFT goods related to the album. It was targeted to end on Sunday. Right. But you had this mechanism in here. This is a fascinating mechanism that during the last 3 minutes of the auction process, the bid would reset.
00:06:14.770 - 00:06:27.686, Speaker A: So if someone bid during the last 3 minutes, it would just reset. And as I understand it, blout, this happened like 40 different times toward the end. So you're sitting there and, I don't know, it was ticking up.
00:06:27.708 - 00:06:30.326, Speaker C: You'd already raised like half hours of extra.
00:06:30.508 - 00:06:32.342, Speaker B: Yes. So set the scene.
00:06:32.486 - 00:06:39.690, Speaker A: Tell us about that. What was that like? What did you expect going in? What were those final minutes and I guess hours like of this auction?
00:06:40.130 - 00:07:32.810, Speaker C: So little quick background. I studied macro microeconomics and game theory probability analysis in college. My professor, Glenn McDonald, is the reason why he actually told my parents that I should drop out to pursue a career in music, because at the time, some of my stuff was going viral on YouTube. So my economics professor had convinced my parents to let me drop out. But I was always a huge kind of math nerd, which applies to music in the sense that when I'm programming sounds for electronic music, it does require a lot of background mathematical knowledge, programming knowledge and stuff like that. I'm not a software developer or engineer whatsoever, but there is some overlap, at least in math and mathematics and music. So one of the things that I was noticing in the NFT space is that it's actually like most of the sales were economically inefficient.
00:07:32.810 - 00:08:32.266, Speaker C: And so I wanted to create this little nash equilibrium experiment, applying the knowledge that I have of game theory to my auction, where you basically capture everyone's highest willingness to pay for what they receive at different levels of rarity. And we assigned a certain rarities to different songs. On my album, the most popular it was, the more rare it would be, and the higher your position in the ranking, the more likely it would be for you to get rare assets versus less rare assets. So position number 33 likely received all more common assets, whereas position number one received all eleven songs and position number two unfortunately only got seven of the eleven songs, but received a majority of them at the highest rarity level. And I kind of built a lot of these mechanics on previous really historic NFT sales. I love the rarity mechanic, that hash masks and that axes and that punks with attributes. I was always a fan of how they created these gamification mechanics and I wanted to apply that through the lens of music with this auction.
00:08:32.266 - 00:09:14.986, Speaker C: Of course, none of these tools existed on an existing NFT platform, so we had to build it ourselves. And the risk that kind of followed that was I had to bring my audience to my website. There wasn't a built in audience for this auction and I was very surprised that we actually had over 2000 registered bidders for the auction. We only had a total of a little over 300 bids because I think as the price floor went up, a lot of people were a little bit more nervous. The price floor after the first day, I think was already at five or six grand. So some of those registered bidders were unfortunately weeded out of the process. But the one thing that we did that was great is that anyone who even just placed a bid received a loyal t Nft so they still got something for free, which is great and they didn't get charged.
00:09:14.986 - 00:09:59.334, Speaker C: And if you actually deposited crypto to bid in the first place and you didn't make it into the top 33, the origin protocol team actually gave away. I think it was 300 ogn or maybe 1000 Ogn. I don't know exactly what the number was just for your participation in the process. So of course we started out this auction, there's a vinyl NFT. Tier one gets to make a one of one song with me, tier two gets to make a mix with me that would be tokenized, and the final tier just gets the music and the actual physical vinyl if they choose to redeem their vinyl NFT, there's a lot of complicated mechanics that are all available on the website. We don't need to go into the depth of that. What I'm actually most excited about is some of the extras that we're going to announce.
00:09:59.334 - 00:10:39.660, Speaker C: I should have announced last week, but I've been so busy that I haven't had a chance. So the top 33 collectors will all be receiving open editions from me in the future for free. Anything that we do as an open edition a lot of them will be receiving those to the wallet address of their choice that we will mint for them for free. And the rest of the world, of course, would have to buy them at market prices. We're also allowing the top six collectors to receive an all access pass to any blouse show of their choice. That, of course, is going to be tradable as an NFT in the future. So the top six collectors, if you guys want, maybe scroll to the top and hit view rankings, and I can kind of walk you through what each ranking looks like.
00:10:39.660 - 00:11:43.822, Speaker C: So bidder 65, whose identity is still unknown but whom we have email contact with, will be able to make a custom one of one song with me and actually provide creative direction for me to create that song. That's like kind of their mega prize that they get in position one. They also get all eleven song NFTs and the platinum vinyl NFT. Anyone in tier two will get to make a tokenized mix with me, so they get to kind of tell me songs that they like that I can include in a mix that I will tokenize for them. They also receive seven of the eleven song nfts and receive that in rarity accordance with their position. The silver tier receives a silver NFT that's redeemable for a real vinyl, and then they also receive three of the song tokens that are assigned by rarity based on their position. And as you can see, as we go down the list, according to proper nash equilibrium economics, the bottom bids are very close to each other, whereas the higher bids start to spread out a bit more.
00:11:43.822 - 00:12:31.434, Speaker C: And what people don't know yet that we'll be telling them soon, is any airdropped edition that we send them will be additioned in their ranking accordingly. So zero XB one would receive addition number four of a future blow open edition that I release, and he will receive that into perpetuity. So there's going to be a lot of really cool, interesting mechanics and gamification that we add as we go here. The all access passes will be applied from positions one through six, so they'll receive an NFT that they can use to get backstage at any blouse show, including festivals. There are some festivals that only allow us to get two to four all access passes. And for those festivals, based on your ranking, you get first priority or first right of refusal. Right? So like for ultra music festival, we only get so many passes we won't get six.
00:12:31.434 - 00:12:55.982, Speaker C: And bidder 65 or eight. Eight. Eight might have a better shot at. They have first right of refusal on those passes before zero XP, one right click, save and silence. So those all access passes will be airdropped to the addresses that hold those vinyl tokens. Later, if they trade the vinyl tokens, they won't get access to these open editions or these all access passes in the future. Right? So there is quite an incentive for them to hold on to these vinyl tokens.
00:12:55.982 - 00:13:26.510, Speaker C: And finally, I'm going to be throwing a private party in LA where all three of these collectors will be invited. We will also invite all the other bidders in the auction to this private party. But of course the 33 will be on stage with me during the event and we plan on doing that in LA once the world opens up. Just to celebrate such an awesome event and to celebrate what changed the music industry for good. I'm lucky to be in touch with a lot of these collectors, which is really nice. I'm in close touch with whale shark. He's been a supporter of mine for a long time.
00:13:26.510 - 00:14:07.494, Speaker C: I've been chatting with eight, eight, eight I've been chatting with as we go down the list, I don't know right click save or silence or master seed. But illustrator is a very close friend of mine. And illustrator actually built this auction mechanic into a smart contract on chain and we're probably going to name it the Blau auction. So it's basically just a game theory influenced Nash equilibrium style auction where the top n number of bids receive something in different tiers of rarity. Ito is I'm also in touch with ito on Twitter who is the man and he's been so supportive of the space and helping new artists. Seed phrase Danny is also an incredible dude. Like a lot of think flexible.
00:14:07.494 - 00:14:35.906, Speaker C: I've been in touch with on Twitter. J Han is an amazing art collector who has a robust collection of real art in Hong Kong. Ben is someone who I befriended recently just after around the time of the auction. And all these people are going to have a direct line to me. They'll have my phone number and forever. They are forever my family because they help me change history. And we're just really excited that this was so successful and we took a big risk doing it off platform, but we did it.
00:14:35.906 - 00:14:47.640, Speaker C: Also shout out to Pablo and Gabby and Ari Steinberg, who's my childhood friend. I can't believe that my childhood friend ended up he was the only credit card bid at the end, which is really funny. He was the only credit.
00:14:48.010 - 00:15:40.162, Speaker B: This is so cool. And I think why this is so fantastically cool is exemplified in where you just ended, where you said all of these people have a direct line to me, the creator or the bidder. Number one, they get to collaborate with me and direct my art, my creations, and also, you know, all these people because of the direct connection that they have between their Ethereum address and the auction. Right? There's two through lines here that I see here that are really fantastic. One is that your biggest and best fans have a way of expressing their biggest and bestness. Fans, right. All of a sudden there is something that differentiates a listener on Spotify who is your biggest and best fan, versus a listener on Spotify who stumbled across one of your songs on the radio mechanism.
00:15:40.162 - 00:16:06.450, Speaker B: So that differentiation is so, so cool. And then the other differentiation that I see is that you actually see these people, you know their names. You actually can get in contact with the quote unquote listeners or your fans, which you can't really do if I was listening to your music yesterday, but you would have no way of engaging with me through Spotify or through any other streaming platform. And so both of these things together seems to be so incredibly powerful.
00:16:06.790 - 00:16:57.034, Speaker C: 100%. So this is the most important aspect of NFTs for any artist is the fact that social platforms and centralized platforms have been rehypothecating the data that I generate for the past decade. What I mean by that is the same way a bank rehypothecates its reserve funds, or the funds that it's not required to keep on reserve. These centralized platforms of entertainment rehypothecate the data that we don't even own as creators and sell that data to advertising agencies and at different rates. It's super wrong, right? So the number one use case for NFTs, aside from monetization, is actually data I've generated over a billion streams across YouTube, Apple Music, and Spotify. I have no idea who those listeners are. Same thing with tickets.
00:16:57.034 - 00:17:42.810, Speaker C: I've sold millions of tickets over the past decade. I don't know who any of those people are. I have zero data on any of those people. The only time I get data is if a fan purchases merchandise, which is a select few number of fans for them to collect. A digital asset that has off chain functionality is interesting in and of itself. And so the way I see the future of NFTs is as both tickets, as access passes, as unlockable for exclusive content. We're building a web3 wallet that if you just sign a signature on Metamask or Portis, which I'm a huge fan of, and we can talk about Portis in a second if you just sign a message, you'll be able to access content on my website, and you'll be able to listen to a bunch of unreleased music just by owning an NFT.
00:17:42.810 - 00:18:48.982, Speaker C: And only you will be able to do that. Now people are like, well, theoretically, couldn't you just rip the music? Yes, but why would someone who spent $60,000 be incentivized to ripping the music and sharing it with other people? I don't think so. And if they choose to, then that's their choice. And so there's really an incredible opportunity that I've been thinking about for four years in bridging the gap between fan and artist, and there are very few ways to do that when there's a centralized intermediary in between. And what we did with origin protocol, it's a centralized back end, it's centralized wallet back end, because we wanted to accept credit cards, we wanted to keep it simple for fans. But my opinion is that fans will gradually start to move to a decentralized ecosystem as they discover its merits and as they discover its benefits. But there's been this huge disconnect in the history of blockchain tech, which since 2008, since the bitcoin white paper, obviously cryptography predates that, but since the bitcoin white paper, there's always been this disconnect between the mainstream and cryptocurrencies because of austrian economics, because the idea of dollars and cents is the only thing we've ever known when it comes to money.
00:18:48.982 - 00:19:40.470, Speaker C: But when you bring NFTs into the picture, it creates something that's a little bit more tangible than owning one bitcoin for someone, right? Like, they don't understand that because it's just not something they've been trained in. But they do understand what it means to collect their favorite images. They do understand what it means to collect their favorite music because people used to collect vinyl records back in the day. And if the record store sold out of the vinyl trade for crazy numbers in the aftermarket, right, elenium, who's a good artist friend of mine who's going to be doing a drop very soon of his own that I'm helping coach him on, some of his vinyls from his first album are trade for $2,000 on eBay because he only did a limited run of them. So this idea of collecting and this idea of digitally native art is certainly not new. The idea of virtual goods is not new. It's just that now we have a ledger to prove provenance and ownership that is transparent and immutable.
00:19:40.470 - 00:20:27.602, Speaker C: And this is 1000% where the entire world is going to go. We have gas costs as a problem. We have challenges and barriers that we need to overcome. But with matic and other l two technologies, optimism with other blockchains that are now pursuing NFTs in a huge way with cross chain technology and cross chain transfers, that I think will be a really essential part of the ecosystem in the future, we're starting to see a world where this stuff can exist in a way that consumers understand. We're finally getting there. And when we do, consumers and people who consume entertainment will realize that everything they've known in the past is just not right. It's already happening.
00:20:27.602 - 00:21:01.262, Speaker C: My fans are figuring it out. They're saying to themselves, I want to support my favorite artist in a decentralized way, in a direct way, because they'll see more benefit from it. Artists care about, or fans care about the artists that they listen to. I have a very deep relationship with the musicians, the music that I listen to, it's a relationship that's more than a third of a cent on Spotify. It's value that's been emotionally almost impossible to capture in history. And now you've created this mechanism to capture that value. And that's why we're really only seeing the beginning of this market.
00:21:01.262 - 00:21:33.660, Speaker C: I mean, my favorite statistic is two quick things, and then I'll let you guys ask some more questions. Before January of 2021, the NFT sales market was about 160,000,000 of volume. So, like, from 2008, the beginning of bitcoin, to January 2021, there was 160,000,000 of sales volume. In February alone, we topped 300 million. It's exponential. The traditional art market does about 65 million per year. The traditional music record sales market does about 40 million per year.
00:21:33.660 - 00:21:49.742, Speaker C: What do you think the size is of this thing? It's in the hundreds of billions. Hundreds of billions. And yet cryptocurrency as a whole, the total market cap is just barely over 1 trillion. Right. I don't know what it is today. 1.51.3, something like that.
00:21:49.796 - 00:21:50.734, Speaker B: 1.1 or two?
00:21:50.772 - 00:22:17.830, Speaker C: Yeah, one or two. Okay, so if you think about how big the market is for content, oh, my God, it's massive. So here's the next thing. People are like, well, when is this bubble going to burst? These prices are ridiculous. How is there space for everyone? How is there space for everyone on Instagram? How many musicians do you know that can't make money? How many photographers do you know that can't make money? How many performers do you know, that don't get paid. It's the same as anything else.
00:22:17.980 - 00:22:19.414, Speaker B: Yet they still create.
00:22:19.612 - 00:23:00.134, Speaker C: Yet they still create. There will be those who rise to the top and those who maybe make some memes and try to sell them for some money. So just like anything else, there will be value ascribed to the leaders, and there might not be as much value ascribed to some newcomers. That being said, we've lowered the barrier to entry to an insane low level where I know this young girl named Aaron, who's 14 years old, who makes AI fashion designs, who's sold $20,000 worth of her art, and she's 14. I also know this kid Justin, who's 16 years old, who's done $75,000 of his art sales just because his shit is fucking awesome. And I want to put it on the screen back there. I have screens all over my house.
00:23:00.134 - 00:23:25.840, Speaker C: These aren't turned on because I'm actually doing a firmware update. But I think all this stuff is really important. And finally, one other thing I want to mention that I'd love to have you guys ask some more questions, is, for those of you who don't understand NFTs or are looking to explore it, I like to give this example. The Mona Lisa is a priceless piece of art. But did you know that you can buy an exact replica on Amazon for $53?
00:23:26.610 - 00:23:28.062, Speaker B: I've assumed, yes.
00:23:28.196 - 00:23:31.866, Speaker C: Do you want that $53 replica from Amazon?
00:23:31.978 - 00:23:33.154, Speaker B: No, I do not.
00:23:33.192 - 00:23:36.900, Speaker C: Would you want the real one? Absolutely.
00:23:38.630 - 00:23:40.686, Speaker A: Why wouldn't you want the real one, Dave?
00:23:40.878 - 00:23:42.274, Speaker B: Not at cost.
00:23:42.472 - 00:23:51.346, Speaker C: Well, no, I mean, like, if someone said to you, right, not at cost. Of course. Assuming you had infinite money, would you want the $53 R1.01?
00:23:51.368 - 00:23:51.938, Speaker B: Right?
00:23:52.104 - 00:23:52.830, Speaker A: There we go.
00:23:52.920 - 00:24:26.234, Speaker C: The reality is, and the same goes for a charizard. Like, do you want a real holographic charizard, or do you want to hire a company to print you a fake one? No one wants a 50 cent fake holographic charizard, but it looks exactly the same. So who's to say that there's not emotional value ascribed to something being authentic? There is. It's existed in so many other areas of the world, in the physical world. It's even existed in the digital world, in gaming, and with the Instagram verification checkmark. This idea of digital scarcity is not new. It's just the first time we're seeing it applied to art, and the possibilities are limitless.
00:24:26.234 - 00:24:27.626, Speaker C: With that, I'll end my rant.
00:24:27.738 - 00:25:13.950, Speaker B: Hey, guys, I know it's annoying, but I got to stop the video. There is so much left in this conversation, so don't go anywhere. Justin takes us through all the various intermediaries that restrict his access between him and his fans and his audience, and he goes through and talks about each one and about the merits of each one as an intermediary and evaluates them based on how much value they extract versus how much value they give back to the artist. And then we talk about how this tool of the focal point of a token between a fan base and Blau, or a content creator, how this token can be the connection point that really disintermediates some of these legacy institutions. It was really interesting and I really enjoyed Blau's perspective. Don't go anywhere. We got to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible.
00:25:13.950 - 00:25:55.390, Speaker B: Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens, and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you.
00:25:55.390 - 00:26:49.390, Speaker B: Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset. When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH, so whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of ETH bonus back to me. At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com. Gobankless Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, Legos, yield and composability all in one application.
00:26:49.390 - 00:27:38.366, Speaker B: On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's V two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them. Check out the power of ave@ave.com. That's aave.com.
00:27:38.468 - 00:28:14.666, Speaker A: This is so cool. Look, Justin, you've just unpacked so much for us to get into some more. We'll get back to this phrase, I think, authenticity. I want to talk about the music industry because when we were in the intro, you said, look, $12 million NFT sale. This is a statement to the music industry, right? A statement to the music industry. I don't think I realized until you said what you just said how disconnected artists are music artists are from their fan base and how disconnected the fan base is from the musicians themselves. I don't know that I was fully aware of that.
00:28:14.666 - 00:29:14.640, Speaker A: And you were talking about these 33 bidders, you were talking about all of the additional things that you were planning to provide them, right? So it's this new bridge, this new connectivity layer. But I guess when we go through the history of the music industry, there was a time when record labels kind of dominated, right? And then came Napster, then came Spotify, then came YouTube. But that whole layer right, now this, but that whole web two layer just became a set of rent seeking intermediaries and still created this bridge, this chasm between creator and fan, right? So web two and everything that the Internet has, it provided a lot of distribution for musicians work and for creators work, but it installed a new set of technical middlemen, essentially. Whereas with this, this is like direct to consumer, right?
00:29:15.170 - 00:29:39.842, Speaker C: Exactly. It's direct to consumer. And the tools are still very primitive. We need to develop more tools that make it easier for fans to interact with this stuff. But it's coming, right, like we've all known this moment was coming. It was just a matter of time. And that's why I've remained independent my whole career waiting for this moment.
00:29:39.842 - 00:29:42.998, Speaker C: I wanted to own my rights. I didn't want someone else to own them.
00:29:43.084 - 00:29:53.820, Speaker A: So what's the statement that this is making to the music industry? And maybe it's not just the music industry, maybe it's like the Spotify's and the Pandoras and all the rent seeking intermediaries it's making a statement to.
00:29:55.150 - 00:30:35.560, Speaker C: And Spotify actually is know there are different levels of bad guys who are intermediaries. And I would love to walk through that with you and then I'd love to walk, let's walk through who are the bad guys and why, what statement this makes to the bad guys and then where I really see this going, which we haven't even talked about yet, which is what I'm really excited about as it applies to music. So let's talk about agencies and managers first. They are the least bad guys. I know that sounds crazy. People are like, why do you need an agency? Artists shouldn't negotiate on their own behalf. No one should.
00:30:35.560 - 00:31:15.438, Speaker C: An artist is meant to have an emotional relationship with fans and with their audiences. And managers and agents actually serve a really important role in guiding a young new artist to success. I would not have been able to accomplish what I accomplished without my management team. They flew in from New York and one was in New York and one was in New Mexico. The day after it happened, they flew to Vegas and we were doing team meetings all week. Just like, how do we deal with the next steps? And if I didn't have that support system, there's no way I could have accomplished what we accomplished. And I think managers are the least rent seeking, even though they do take commission.
00:31:15.438 - 00:31:52.330, Speaker C: Their commission is well earned because they provide a team. It's almost like if you think about the first four hires at a startup, your first four employees are your team. They get equity in the company, right? And they are incentivized to be on your side of success. And the same applies for management. Like management is incentivized, they receive commission, but that is their incentivization to represent the artist to everyone else in the world who wants to talk to the artist. And it's so important. And I actually think there's going to be a whole new wave of digital artists that don't have management.
00:31:52.330 - 00:32:41.994, Speaker C: And I actually think digital artists need management because they're going to have to deal with taxes, they have to deal with business management. An artist should just be an artist, right? An artist shouldn't have to worry about all those things. So in the levels of rent seeking middlemen, managers are the least culprits of the existing system. I think they will always need to exist, and I think they're the most important variable. And I think that digital artists will need managers to represent them in negotiation and to represent finances. And for an artist to maintain that creative, like, I need my management team. In fact, one of my managers had to fly back to New Mexico to get a vaccine shot, and she's actually coming back today, like, just to be here all week with me, guiding me through all these opportunities and helping filter what's important and what isn't.
00:32:41.994 - 00:33:42.366, Speaker C: So managers are super important. If you're a digital artist that's listening to this, find a great manager, you will need them, because otherwise you will be flailing in the wind as you try to journey through this insane world. And I am working on, more specifically, joining a management team that is focused on low commission structure, very reasonable commission structure to provide many services for new digital artists, because I think they need those services desperately. I mean, fiosis is 18 and has made millions of dollars and has to understand how to pay taxes. And I'm very glad that they found a great manager. And my manager's name is Andrew, but fuchsia is now working with Sean Mendez's manager, another Andrew, who is going to guide them on all the complicated stuff that an artist shouldn't have to think about. So management agents typically negotiate deals outside of the scope of the internal day to day of an artist.
00:33:42.366 - 00:34:26.862, Speaker C: So my management team only negotiates deals on my behalf that are like music related and brand related. But my agency represents me to the world of live music. And my agent found me when I was 19 years old in Nashville. And I've been with the same agent to this day, Hunter Williams. He had his own private agency, and then CAA actually purchased that private agency, and so he became a member of CAA, and he and I have worked together for ten years, and he's one of my best friends and he commissions me at a very reasonable rate, but adds so much value to my career. So agents, I also think as long as they are acting in the best interest of their clients, there's a lot of value to having. Maybe not for a digital artist, to have an agent like someone who's just making visuals, I think they probably only need a manager.
00:34:26.862 - 00:34:54.250, Speaker C: But for a musician, my agent represents me to the entire world from a live performance standpoint and is able to negotiate those deals. Help me with production of the show, the staging, the performance. It's hard for a creative to conquer all those things. So agencies are typically heavily criticized, but when the commission is reasonable, they shouldn't be. They add a lot of value. Let's keep going down the list of who doesn't add value. Record labels.
00:34:54.250 - 00:35:32.230, Speaker C: Record labels are. Well, actually, before we get to record labels, we'll go to Spotify. Spotify, Facebook, Instagram are actually at the middle of the list because while they rehypothecate data and basically monetize content without the artists really seeing much benefit, they have improved an artist's payouts to an extent. So YouTube has increased my revenue substantially, because when people use a song on YouTube, I do get a royalty for that. And without YouTube, I wouldn't even be able to monetize my music in that way. So they do pay out royalties. Spotify, the same, because I own over 80% of my master recording rights.
00:35:32.230 - 00:35:51.014, Speaker C: Prior to the world of Spotify, no one was buying music. They were stealing it. Now they pay 999 a month to get access to all of it. It's actually better. So my revenue in 2015 for music was like ten grand. In last year was maybe 500,000. So that's only because, though I own my own masters.
00:35:51.014 - 00:36:21.414, Speaker C: When you own your own music, the payouts from these streaming platforms are actually significant, but their mistake is that they don't share the data. Right. So while they've improved the actual monetization of content, they kind of steal the data, which is something that I'm not a fan of. And maybe there's a platform like Audius, who I'm an advisor to, that provides that data to artists. And I think that those services are going to grow in popularity and artists are going to gravitate towards those platforms, because artists should control their own markets and their own data, and that's what.
00:36:21.452 - 00:36:25.462, Speaker B: Allows you to communicate with your fans. That data is that missing link.
00:36:25.596 - 00:36:56.286, Speaker C: Exactly. Like, I can't communicate with my Spotify listeners, but I can communicate with my audience listeners. At least in the future, I will be able to. Just messaging. Right? Like, even being able to send everyone a message that's not filtered by an algorithm is really powerful, let alone, like, being able to talk to them on a discord server. Right? So I would say managers, agents, platforms, worst actors, record labels, absolute worst. Not indie record labels.
00:36:56.286 - 00:37:26.794, Speaker C: There are some indie record labels that cut very fair deals, that provide immense value to artists that otherwise don't have the capital to even get started. But traditionally, record labels really only provide two resources, liquidity for someone to pursue their dream, right? Capital and distribution. Because they have a marketing arm, they have a team, they can get the music out there in 2021. You don't really need any of those things. Your distribution is the Internet. Your capital can be raised from your fans. And we'll get there in a second.
00:37:26.794 - 00:37:43.150, Speaker C: That's what I'm quite excited about. So there are some record labels, like Monster Cat, Mike Darlington, who's a really good friend of mine. They do shit right. They cut fair deals, they help artists that have little to no following who have good music. They help them get started. They're an incubator. They're like YC.
00:37:43.150 - 00:38:11.850, Speaker C: Like, imagine a record label as a. Like, that's cool, right? That makes sense. But the major labels that give these advances that are recoupable against royalties. So regular record label will say, here's a million dollars, we're taking 80% of your music. And by the way, after we don't pay you until our million dollar loan is recouped, and then we get 80% of everything after that. Who the fuck would cut that deal? I wouldn't. It's fucking crazy.
00:38:11.850 - 00:38:36.610, Speaker C: But artists have been trained to do it because otherwise they don't get the distribution. Come on, that has to end. And it's going to end, I'm telling you. And that's what I wanted to prove. So Spotify still has a place in the world. Instagram, Facebook, they will always have a place in the world. Centralized platforms are necessary, but the record labels, the ones that are predatory, they're fucked.
00:38:36.610 - 00:39:22.554, Speaker C: We're coming for them. And my next thing that I'm excited about is enabling fans to actually fund music, to invest in music, to invest in master recording rights. So imagine a record deal, but with your own fans, where they can participate in the upside of the music. Now that's a security. It's a security. But who's to say that if it's done compliantly, that can't happen in the next six months? And that's the project that I'm most excited about, to let fans invest in my album and get what we would call an SNFT, a non fungible security token, but labeled as an SNft where it represents their contribution, their financial contribution to the album and accrues royalties. It just has to be compliant.
00:39:22.554 - 00:39:57.994, Speaker C: It's not that hard to make it compliant. Reg cf reg d reg s non transferable for a year. And after it is transferable, having a compliant platform that collects KYC, AML. This stuff is not hard. It's just expensive to execute. The legal fees are insane to execute, all the paperwork to be compliant. So my goal after showing how these collectibles work, creating value in art, is actually to give participants an equity stake in the IP of my art.
00:39:57.994 - 00:40:41.522, Speaker C: And that is where this is going. This is just step one. And this has been my dream for ten years. But then when I learned about distributed ledger tech, it gave me the idea of like, okay, my dream for ten years has been, how do I go direct a fan and give them a stake in what I do? Blockchain technology is like, oh shit, this is the way to do it. Five years later, we fucking do it. And the next ten years of my life are going to be dedicated to figuring out how to create products for artists that don't require high legal costs, that are totally regulatorily compliant, that enable them to raise capital from fans instead of a record label and reward fans for investing in their creativity early on. And that is my vision for the future.
00:40:41.522 - 00:40:43.260, Speaker C: And now I can shut up.
00:40:43.710 - 00:41:36.390, Speaker B: Okay, so there's so much to talk about, and everything at the end of the day goes back to the power behind tokens and what tokens offer. And tokens can offer anything to anyone so long as you can code such a thing. And for what we are seeing with creatives like you, digital artists, musicians, they are using the power of tokens, specifically the ERC 721 standard, to produce an NFT that all of a sudden those fans really want. But what you're talking about after we went down the list of middlemen who do or do not add value or on some spectrum of costing, and then returning value to what is ultimately the value of the creator, what you're saying is that the record labels are the worst ratio of value returned versus value extorted or value captured.
00:41:36.470 - 00:41:37.942, Speaker C: And not all record labels.
00:41:38.086 - 00:41:40.220, Speaker B: Not all record labels, right?
00:41:41.230 - 00:42:18.714, Speaker C: There are record labels that do add immense value, there's no doubt, right? But there are also the big guys that it took two, and I don't even give. Like, at this point in my life, I have a lot of friends that work at universal Music that are good people, but fuck universal music, right, as a whole, right? Like, there are people that are good people that work for these legacy companies, and I don't want to tarnish their names because they're great and they're doing great things. And a lot of them believe in this, they'll probably jump ship at some point. But the fact that it takes three years to pay someone. I mean, come on, right? It's just wrong.
00:42:18.832 - 00:42:21.530, Speaker A: Wow. We feel the same way about banks.
00:42:23.950 - 00:42:53.090, Speaker C: Me too. I mean, quick story. I had to send a wire for a real estate investment with bank of America five years ago, right around the time that I was introduced to bitcoin. A little bit after, and because someone didn't have high enough authorization at the branch, it took a week to send it this big financial wire. But it's my fucking money. Why should it take a week? It makes no sense, right? So bankless.
00:42:55.830 - 00:42:57.330, Speaker A: David, you're muted.
00:42:57.750 - 00:43:57.490, Speaker B: Thank you. And so I want to go back to what we were talking earlier about NFTs as a way for direct creator to fan engagement and the powers that go with it. But it's that investable layer where you're talking about with a security NFT, a security token, which the conversation of securities has totally plagued the crypto industry. But that's also largely because the products that these security tokens represented were also just terrible products. And that's completely different when we start talking about music and art because the product is much more legitimate. But I think the cool thing about a security token NFT is we are establishing the meaning, the emotional relationship between artist and consumer. But with a security token NFT, we are turning that into a loop where the artist creates the value, the fans consume that value, but the fans can also create more value by ascribing a secondary market value to that security token NFT.
00:43:57.490 - 00:44:35.330, Speaker B: And so all of a sudden your fans go from a consumer to a producer because your fans are like, well, I just bought into this security token NfT which represents future cash flows of a blau album. And I think Blau is the hottest shit on the world and his music is going to dominate and I think he's underappreciated. So I'm going to purchase his security token NFT because I want that cash flow, because I do believe there's upside. And then I'm going to go and shout from the rooftops, yo, everyone go listen to this music. And this feedback loop of incentive mechanisms because of the power of tokens, I think has a lot of dormant power under it. Can you talk about that?
00:44:35.400 - 00:45:07.706, Speaker C: I mean, everything you just said, you just described my vision completely. And by the way, this can be done with fungible tokens too. Like fungible tokens can represent shares in something, or it can be done, the actual technical back end can be done in a couple of ways. You have a fungible token that's limited, that there's no inflation on that represents a share of IP. That's like a simple way to do it. But what I like about the security NFT is it helps you tier loyalty of fans. So let's say I want to raise a million dollars for my next album.
00:45:07.706 - 00:46:04.446, Speaker C: You get a certain type of NFT if you make 100,000 plus contribution. And that NFT has other functionality outside of just the cash flows that exist, and it can also be traded. So let's say you spend $100,000, you get like the platinum NFT for my next album, right? Maybe that also gets you backstage access and all these other things and also entitles you to cash flows pro rata based on your investment. So that's one way to look at it. The other way to look at it is you just own a number of fungible tokens that represent, that are more like a dow token that's wrapped in one NFT that represents the whole album. There's lots of ways to structure it from a financial engineering standpoint. We particularly like this idea of an snft because it makes more sense to consumers than fungible tokens.
00:46:04.446 - 00:47:06.770, Speaker C: Like this idea of having one of something is really complex to people. And so just having one thing that is tangible to me is just an easier way. Like you can do it both ways, do it with a fungible token or a non fungible token. But having something that says you contributed $100,000, that NFT has that metadata and thus accrues royalties because of the metadata in that NFT that represents your pro rata share, that to me is just easier for a fan to understand than a fungible token, right? And so then they can get access to a discord server because they got the platinum one because they contributed over 100,000. Now someone might have contributed 130,000. They still have the same style security NFT, but the metadata shows that they get a larger pro ratatic share of the royalties, right? So each SNFD would theoretically have other metadata associated with it that represents the share of the total investment that fans have made. So this is just like it can be done in a lot of ways.
00:47:06.770 - 00:47:37.898, Speaker C: Like the idea of an NFT representing 100% of the rights of the song and then wrapping that in a Dow token is interesting. Like a Dow record label is interesting. There's so many interesting things. The issue is regulatory compliance. If I were to do that on my own, compliantly, there's infinite possibilities of how it can happen on the back end. The issue is less like the technical back end and more like, how do we make sense of this to fans. That's my number one goal.
00:47:37.898 - 00:48:17.882, Speaker C: Because in the history of crypto, which is still, what only, what is it, 14 years now, the history of crypto, we have not seen this kind of mass market movement to the decentralized world, to the decentralized ecosystem. And so we have a responsibility now, as people who believed in this stuff for a while, to build the tools that make it easier for people to use. And guess what? Some of those tools are going to be centralized the way coinbase is necessary. And that's okay. We need an on ramp to transition people from the fiat world to this new world. It can't just expect everyone to believe in this shit. All of us have to buy bitcoin at some point or accept bitcoin as payment at some point.
00:48:17.882 - 00:48:34.974, Speaker C: We had to do that conversion. And so we can't ignore that. That conversion needs to exist. Right. I don't think there's an alternative. So we need to kind of balance our heavy focus on decentralization with the centralized world to find that bridge. And I think NFTs are that bridge.
00:48:34.974 - 00:48:38.610, Speaker C: I'm excited to be an active participant in that ecosystem.
00:48:39.350 - 00:49:36.718, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. So it's super cool, right? So one thing that you said earlier is basically the record labels are the ones who traditionally provided capital, but now in this new crypto world, you can get capital directly for your fans. So, like, the record labels, they're done, right? This is totally disintermediates them. But I want to get back to some of the subtlety of what you're saying, right? So basically, if I'm a super fan and I love Blau, right, and I want access to his materials, I want access to his collectibles, but I also want upside into the things that you're doing in the future, Justin. Right. I can buy a collectible, an ERC 721, a nifty and kind of get that upside, right? So it's similar to a beeple piece of artwork in the early stages of beeple, before he makes it totally mainstream, his art might be worth less than in later stages after he becomes like the new Mona Lisa, essentially.
00:49:36.814 - 00:49:39.622, Speaker C: So you can never sell my beeple, I'll tell you that.
00:49:39.676 - 00:49:42.198, Speaker A: Never sell your beeple. Right. Hold for life.
00:49:42.284 - 00:49:45.014, Speaker C: $969 could have gotten 170.
00:49:45.132 - 00:50:27.494, Speaker A: No, but here's what's weird to me, is existing regulatory and security law, right? So it's fine for anybody in the US to buy a collectible and then to resell that anybody can do it. I could do it. You could do it. My kids could do it. Totally legal, right? But where somehow things get weird in the US with securities law is if it has a cash flow attached to it, then it becomes this thing called a security. And then we have all of these specific laws where you have to be an accredited investor, so you have to have a million dollars net worth or you have to have a certain amount in salary per year in order to even invest in this thing, right?
00:50:27.692 - 00:51:10.002, Speaker C: And people complain about wealth inequality, yet, yes, they've changed Reg cf from 1 million to 5 million. And most people probably shouldn't be raising more than 5 million for their creativity. I probably don't think so. I do think that that change in Reg CF should be helpful. But accreditation laws are literally the reason why the wealth gap is so large. More than taxation, more than any other reason, the opportunities are not provided to lesser, lower class individuals who they're stuck because they don't even see the investment opportunities. So for me, the two most important things to change to create a better wealth balance in the world.
00:51:10.002 - 00:52:08.642, Speaker C: Number one, accreditation laws are fucking dumb and need to go away completely. Although there needs to be a line, right? We need to then educate the masses on financial literacy. And the fact that primary education in the United States doesn't have a focus on financial literacy is insane. Why should we learn about the Boston Tea party when kids don't even know what compound interest is? Let's just be fucking insane. It's insane that we don't teach younger generations about how to pay their taxes, but we teach them about a historical event decades, centuries ago. Like, what the fuck, right? A more financially literate population will invest with financial literacy and with an educated mindset, not always in a speculative mindset, and thus create more value because they give new entrepreneurs the opportunity to create tools to create more value. And it creates this positive feedback loop.
00:52:08.642 - 00:52:38.880, Speaker C: So why not give the public more? I envision a world where I've got two choices. Got Starbucks and in Las Vegas I have madhouse coffee shop, privately owned, open 24 hours. I go to madhouse, it's an extra 5 minutes away. I love the coffee. It's better. I want to check out with my coffee and invest a dollar every day. Add a dollar to invest in that company, in that local business.
00:52:38.880 - 00:53:15.420, Speaker C: Why can't I do that? I should be able to do that, right? Like, it's so obvious. That's where crypto comes in, right? The legacy payments world of visa and sending wires and all this shit. It's so inefficient. If I have a little digital wallet I check out. Do you want to invest in? How much do you want to invest? Was your experience great? Click a freaking button. You can look up the agreement later on what you're actually signing, how much shares you're getting, what the valuation is, right? You should be able to see those things. But we need to teach the next generation to look at those things.
00:53:15.420 - 00:53:49.670, Speaker C: People need that kind of financial literacy to continue to create value in our universe. And we saw it happen in tech, right? The tech boom changed our lives in an insane way. Just the fact that clubhouse exists, the fact that we can zoom and have a conversation across the world. The same thing will apply to investing in all other types of companies. But we don't want that investment to know exclusive to the already rich. We want that to be available to the mainstream. And Robinhood.
00:53:49.670 - 00:53:55.720, Speaker C: There's some problems with Robinhood, but it is taking steps in the right direction. Enabling access.
00:53:56.410 - 00:54:39.606, Speaker B: Would you believe that there is a connection between the disintermediation of things and then the people becoming more educated? Because that means the disintermediation means that then the power is back into the hands of the users, and therefore the responsibility is back in the hands of the users. And that just kind of promotes learning and engagement. All right, guys, one last break in the action. We've saved the best parts of the interview for last. We bring up the conversation of art synthesis. When so many different artists are so good at their specific type of cultural creation type of art. Blau, for instance, is a musician, but there are other types of artists that are doing different things, 3D rendering 3d art.
00:54:39.606 - 00:55:20.878, Speaker B: We bring up the conversation of what's it like to collaborate, not just with other musicians, but with other artists of different skills and where the future of art is going. When we integrate all of these different things into some sort of digital expression medium that we are seeing in NFTs, I think it's probably the best part of the conversation. Don't go anywhere. We got to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. If you want to live a bankless life, you need to get a monolith. Defi Visa card. Monolith is both a one two punch of an Ethereum smart contract wallet, as well as an accompanying Visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your Ethereum wallet wherever Visa is accepted.
00:55:20.878 - 00:56:09.698, Speaker B: It's really a fantastic tool that lets you use Ethereum for what it does best, which is holding and managing your financial assets, but also keeps you connected to the rest of the world's payment rails. Monolith also offers on ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of Defi, so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if ever you need to, and your deposited money goes straight into your non custodial wallet. So your money is never held by a centralized intermediary. Because your monolith wallet is native to ethereum, monolith helps you transcend both the legacy and the crypto worlds. Because the money that you hold in your monolith wallet has the power of Defi behind it. Swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in defi is at your fingertips. But with monolith, so are the groceries at your grocery store or the coffee at your coffee shop.
00:56:09.698 - 00:56:48.074, Speaker B: Go to monolith XYz to sign up and get your monolith visa card today. Synthetix is Ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol. What does that mean? Synthetix is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets, which are assets that are priced via an oracle. Rather than bids or asks, traders can use the quinta exchange, which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics. Traders on quinta can trade synthetic tokens like SBTC s oil or SDFI. Because quinta is powered by synthetics, traders experience zero slippage on their trades. No, I didn't mean low slippage.
00:56:48.074 - 00:57:19.490, Speaker B: I meant no slippage, because that is the power of the synthetics platform. No slippage on your trades. You can also easily short assets with isints, which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset. Synthetics isn't just for traders. Developers can build on Synthetix to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets. Or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects. If you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform not found in the legacy world, check out Quinta IO.
00:57:19.490 - 00:58:19.530, Speaker B: If you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral, go to wwW synthetics IO, where you can stake your SNX or ETH and earn fees from synthetix. Justin I want to turn the conversation back to NFTs and specifically the art side of NFTs. And this is a theory that I have on NFTs, specifically the revolution in art that they offer. And in just the music world, people will get hyped on a collaboration between their two favorite artists, oh, Rac and Blau doing a collab together. But Rac and blau are both musicians, right? And so you guys are taking turns, or like, if it's a rapper, you guys are taking turns rapping or taking turns making music or whatever. But in this new NFT world, what I'm seeing is possible collaboration between different artists in their expertise. And so we have blau, the musician, paired with Beeple, the digital artist.
00:58:20.430 - 00:58:22.518, Speaker C: Climb Sunday is my partner in.
00:58:22.624 - 00:58:35.570, Speaker B: Yeah. So talk about how this new revolution in digital art can be not just two people of the same medium, but different media, but different artists of different mediums coming together to create something new. Talk about that.
00:58:35.720 - 00:59:04.294, Speaker C: 100%. And this is a great place to end the conversation as well. Art is always about experience. And as an artist, I create an audio experience for people. But experience is broken down by the senses. It's visual, it's scent, it's smell, it's touch, it's all these things. It's 3d, right? Art has been kind of homogenized in different lanes.
00:59:04.294 - 00:59:40.306, Speaker C: You have visual art, you have music, right? You have live performance. There's no reason why more experiential worlds can exist. When you combine all art forms, it's like so obvious, right? But it just hasn't been done that much. So when you combine visual art and audio, you get a deeper experience than just seeing one or listening to the other. And that is so powerful in itself. That's why slime Sunday and I, we have our next drop on Nifty Gateway coming up this Friday. And it's all unreleased music from me and unreleased visual content from Mike.
00:59:40.306 - 01:00:13.706, Speaker C: He actually has been working on a music video for this drop since last November. So there's a full length music video. When you start combining that with the physical world and you create real world experiences that mix visuals and audio, now you're adding another dimension of both touch and aura. And the future of that is just so insane. I mean, that's why I love experiences like EDC. You just get this hyperdrive of sense and you get this appeal to all of your senses. And one of the best conversations I've.
01:00:13.738 - 01:00:14.320, Speaker A: Had.
01:00:16.130 - 01:00:39.334, Speaker C: In the past week, there have been a lot of celebrities that have reached out that want to do this. But I'll tell you, the best combo I've had was with Pascal Ritella, the creator of insomniac events. And he was like, I don't want to rush this. I'm not looking for the cash grab. He didn't say, I'm not looking for the cash grab. He's like, I don't care about the money. I want to reward the fans that have been buying tickets to my shit, for the past ten years.
01:00:39.334 - 01:01:02.090, Speaker C: How do I get them a free nft? And what can that NFT do? These are the questions that Pascal is asking me. And I'm like, dude, you are thinking about this the right way. At your festival. You can create a scavenger hunt. Let's say you go to see an art exhibit. You can get a proof of memory from that art exhibit, right? You can get proof of memory of a set that you watch by scanning a QR code. It goes right to your wallet.
01:01:02.090 - 01:01:51.440, Speaker C: There's an infinite number of possibilities that exist when you bridge the live experiential world with the digital world. And that call with Pascal was my favorite of all because EDC has a special place in my heart. It was like, I've obviously played four times. We'll be playing a fifth when it happens this year, if it happens this year or next. Bridging those worlds and creating experiences that are the most memorable for people, the experiences they remember when they die. And having more than just a photo of that experience, having something that explores more dimensions than just a photo or a video is so powerful. And I think that's like, from the art standpoint where we will see this thing going, just hyper experiential digital art that explores all mediums, not just one.
01:01:51.440 - 01:01:59.060, Speaker C: And I'm just excited for it. Guys, thank you so much for having me. I hope I answered most of the questions. And let's definitely do this again.
01:01:59.590 - 01:02:08.598, Speaker A: It's been a blast. Blau, thank you so much. We appreciate it. Super excited to see what you're dropping next. Any hints on what's next for you here?
01:02:08.684 - 01:02:43.600, Speaker C: Yeah, so we've got nifty Gateway on this coming Friday, March twelveth Slime Sunday. And I did a complete music video, and we also have three open edition pieces that are visualizers that he designed with full length unreleased music that I've been working on for four months. We've literally been working on this for four months. And we actually thought that the album drop was going to be like the warm up for this one. So it's going to be tough to talk album drop, but this one has taken us a lot of time. We're really excited about it. I'm happy to share, give you guys a little sneak peek in the chat of what's coming out.
01:02:43.600 - 01:03:01.734, Speaker C: And it's going to be dropping this Friday with our alias. Our alias is called SSX Blau. It's just slime Sunday Times Blau. And I think you guys will enjoy the assets, and I think everyone else will be taken into a different world with some of this content. We spent a lot of time on it.
01:03:01.852 - 01:03:05.282, Speaker A: Wow. This link that you're sending, can we share this with the audience?
01:03:05.426 - 01:03:06.262, Speaker C: No, not yet.
01:03:06.316 - 01:03:20.362, Speaker A: Private okay, bankless nation, we'll have to keep it private for now, but this is coming and the artists are coming to the space. It sounds like Blau. Is there going to be a stampede of new creators and artists coming to the NFT space as a result of what's going on here?
01:03:20.416 - 01:03:49.022, Speaker C: You heard it first, but Rob Gronkowski, who's a good friend of mine, is launching his first NFTs tomorrow on OpenSea. Really excited to be helping him with that. Halsey is going to be doing some really cool stuff. Elenium is going to be doing some really cool stuff. I know Calvin Harris is going to be doing cool like everyone, and I haven't signed any NDAs, so no one can punish me. But everyone is coming and it's up to the community to decide what feels authentic and what doesn't. And there's going to be a lot of inauthentic shit.
01:03:49.022 - 01:04:03.206, Speaker C: Let's just be real. But there are also a lot of people like disclosure, who made a song on Twitch and tokenized it to Zora right after he made it for his fans. I mean, there's infinite possibilities here and I'm just excited for the artists to explore new creative mediums.
01:04:03.398 - 01:04:14.954, Speaker A: Wow, thanks so much. This has been awesome. Bankless nation, of course, risks and disclaimers. Everything we talked about can be risky. ETH is risky. Crypto is risky. So is Defi.
01:04:14.954 - 01:04:25.522, Speaker A: NFTs can be speculative assets as well. You could lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless podcast. Thanks so much.
01:04:25.656 - 01:04:26.740, Speaker C: Thank you guys.
