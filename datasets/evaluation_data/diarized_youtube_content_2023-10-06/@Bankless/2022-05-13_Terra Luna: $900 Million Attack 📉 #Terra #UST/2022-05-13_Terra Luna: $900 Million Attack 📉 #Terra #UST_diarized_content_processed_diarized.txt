00:00:00.160 - 00:00:36.181, Speaker A: The Terra ecosystem is definitely leaning into this was a multilevel economic hitman attack. While it does appear that there is one well capitalized entity that maneuvered this trade or this attack, it really doesn't matter. It's an attack if you're in a victim, but it's really just a trade. The entity that borrowed $100,000 of Bitcoin, sold it into the market, bought a bunch of us to kill the peg. They made out with roughly $900 million of profit. And so this was a rational actor who saw an opportunity in the market to walk away with $900 million while also causing the collapse of the whole entire ecosyste system. It's beside the point as to whether it's a coordinated attack or a trade.
00:00:36.181 - 00:00:39.525, Speaker A: All that matters is that if it can be attacked, it will be attacked.
