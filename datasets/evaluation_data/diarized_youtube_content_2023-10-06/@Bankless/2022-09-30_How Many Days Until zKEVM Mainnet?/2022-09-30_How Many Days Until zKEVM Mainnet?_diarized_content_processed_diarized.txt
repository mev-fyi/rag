00:00:00.090 - 00:00:09.182, Speaker A: You guys are getting close to Mainnet and by Mainet, I'm talking about a ZK EvM on Mainet. Can you give us the countdown? How many days out are we and are you going to hit that date?
00:00:09.236 - 00:00:26.454, Speaker B: Yeah, we said 100 days a while ago. And as soon as we said it was 100 days to Mainet, I think everybody in the company threw up because we're so worried about hitting it. But we're 31 days away right now, and I think we're going to hit it one month. Things are looking, I would say, more than a non zero chance that we'll hit it.
00:00:26.492 - 00:00:30.370, Speaker A: More than a non zero chance. But there's also a chance that you won't. Then I assume.
00:00:30.450 - 00:00:31.718, Speaker B: I think we're looking pretty good.
00:00:31.804 - 00:00:33.060, Speaker A: Think we're looking pretty good. All right.
