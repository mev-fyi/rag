00:05:24.560 - 00:06:52.604, Speaker A: If you are looking for a mobile wallet to hold and access your crypto, you need to go to Argent XYZ and download their smart contract wallet app right onto your Android or iOS device. Argent is the most secure way to hold money on your device while still being able to access defi services that we all know and love. On Ethereum through Argent, you have one tap access to the beloved Defi apps like Compound Uniswap Ave, and you can even invest directly into some yield generating assets right from your argent wallet. Crucial to maintaining security over your assets is Argent's guardian service, which allows you to use a friend to make sure that you can always restore access to your funds in case you were to ever lose your phone or for your device to break. You can also use a local hardware wallet to ensure that you can always restore access to your funds yourself. One of Argent's newest features is their ability to route trades through ten decentralized exchanges, including Uniswap and Kyber, to make sure that you are always getting the best trade on your assets. Similarly, pushing the fold on what we can do in Ethereum and DFI, Argent has replicated some of the legacy financial services that you would expect from your bank, but put it directly into the hands of the user, such as send limits and whitelisted accounts, ensuring that if anyone were to be able to access your funds in your argent wallet, they could only send up to a certain amount and only be able to send them to approved addresses, which is creating one of the most safe environments to hold your assets in.
00:06:52.604 - 00:07:29.532, Speaker A: Which is why people have put millions and millions of dollars into the Argent wallet that they use on their device. In order to see the argent wallet in action, go to Argent link slash bankless and download the argent wallet on iOS or Android today. We're also brought to you by monolith. Monolith is your cool new Defi account, your defi savings account, your defi checking account. Except the cool thing about the Monolith DeFi account is that it gets software updates, right? You actually get to increase the usefulness of this over time. So here are some of the features. Monolith is a smart contract wallet with a lot of the features that you would expect.
00:07:29.532 - 00:08:07.984, Speaker A: If you've come to know Defi and what it is, you can add money to it. You can put that money to work in compound and accessing yield, and you can also swap through uniswap. What's cool with monolith is that they will send you a very sexy monolith visa card that connects to your monolith smart contract wallet on Ethereum. So it's a really awesome tool to live a bankless life with a savings account that gets software updates. So this is something that you're never going to find out in the real world, but you can still do real world things with real money, like buy your groceries. So that's just fantastic. Coming soon to monolith.
00:08:07.984 - 00:08:28.780, Speaker A: Actually, already here to monolith is now you can buy die and get it sent to your wallet directly. Right? So it's also being an on ramp, so you don't have to go through your centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini or wherever. You can just go straight from your bank account right into your monolith checking account smart contract wallet. So check them out at Monolith XYZ.
00:08:30.320 - 00:08:53.520, Speaker B: Hello, bankless nation. Welcome to another community. Ask me anything. This is an AMA. This is your opportunity to ask some of the most interesting projects, some of the most interesting people in crypto questions that you have always wanted answered. So to ask a question, type it into YouTube. If you are a bankless member, you can type it into the inner circle discord.
00:08:53.520 - 00:09:18.764, Speaker B: And we will prioritize those things. David and I, throughout this conversation will do our best to field your questions to our two guests today. And with that, I want to introduce our guests today. This is part of the team at Zapper. So Zapper is a defi interface. It is kind of a bankless bank interface, and you can do tons of things with it. It's a fantastic tool.
00:09:18.764 - 00:09:27.244, Speaker B: We recommend it all the time. I have Seb Audet, who is the founder of Zapper, and I have Travis Blaine, but you probably know him as Defi dad.
00:09:27.292 - 00:09:28.480, Speaker A: We just call him dad.
00:09:28.980 - 00:09:30.508, Speaker B: Dave calls him dad.
00:09:30.684 - 00:09:32.244, Speaker A: I'm not quite comfortable with that yet.
00:09:32.282 - 00:09:43.350, Speaker B: But Defi dad's okay with me. And he is the coo of Zapper, huge contributor to the defi space as well. Gentlemen, how are you doing today? Welcome.
00:09:43.880 - 00:09:48.824, Speaker C: Thank you. Thank you, Ryan. That was a pretty good intro. Yeah, we're doing pretty good.
00:09:49.022 - 00:09:49.768, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:09:49.934 - 00:10:01.630, Speaker D: Thanks for having us, guys. Yeah, Ryan just makes everything sound exciting. We were talking a few minutes and then the cameras turn on. It's like, hey, everybody, welcome to the.
00:10:02.560 - 00:10:26.230, Speaker B: My kids say I have a podcast voice, and it's totally different. So whatever. All right, let's start with this question. So we're going to field some questions for the community, but I think we just want to get a base. So there are people out there that haven't used zapper yet. Believe it or not, even people in the bankless community may have not used zapper yet. Gentlemen, what does Zapper do?
00:10:27.560 - 00:11:12.400, Speaker C: Yeah, so zapper helps you understand your portfolio first. So say you do a ton of different investments in know you're playing with a bunch of different protocols. Zapper helps you bring all that information and put it in one interface. So that's the first thing. Then the second part is actually being able to manage your funds. So we help people go into uniswap pools, balancer pools, and reduce the friction around doing those transactions. So instead of doing a couple of transactions to enter a uniswap pool, you could do it with one transaction on Zapper, which we call a zap.
00:11:12.740 - 00:11:36.170, Speaker B: It's brilliant, like using zap as a verb, which means you get to do something really cool. In Defi, you zap into something. And I guess, Travis, I would love your perspective on this. So what is the end game for Zapper? What are you guys trying to do? Is this like an interface for all things defi? All the money verbs, as we call them, on?
00:11:36.620 - 00:12:24.068, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what it is. I think the high level mission is to make Defi easy for everyone. And so, by the way, too, I don't know if we're able to share screens. I feel like, yes, we are share a screen, if anyone's ever not seen it. But, yeah, the goal is to allow you to track your defi portfolio and then to be able to have the same access as others who might be more sophisticated in Defi and be able to navigate all the different platforms and all the different strategies. By creating a zap, we, in many cases, consolidate could be, like three to seven transactions into one or two. And so it saves them time, it saves them money, it saves them effort.
00:12:24.068 - 00:12:50.604, Speaker D: But I think more than anything, it's like really doing what a lot of fintech has done, where you take away all of the friction points. Robinhood is incredible because you can go on and you can trade with nothing to stop you from putting in as much money as you want into whatever stocks, and there's no fees. And I think similarly, we're just trying to enable that sort of access through Defi.
00:12:50.732 - 00:13:05.096, Speaker B: And important to note, you guys never take custody of assets, right? So it's basically bring your own wallet, bring your own private keys, plug it in, and you get this entire interface. You could plug into metamask, you can plug in your ledger, account, wallet, connect whatever you're using. Right?
00:13:05.278 - 00:13:14.280, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. We don't custody any users funds. We're just this way to plug into Defi. So super cool.
00:13:14.350 - 00:14:07.710, Speaker D: I've got my screen up here. Can you see? Yes. Want to earn yield or do some yield farming? And then you can see here even a breakdown of different platforms that I would have money in here. So, like, I have some money, some stable coins in Barnbridge that's earning me bond. And so that $3,000 of value here is staked there. The other side of the coin, though, is to be able to use a zap. And so this is where I could look for a liquidity pool, let's say USDC.
00:14:07.710 - 00:15:06.110, Speaker D: I've got the one here for uniswap. And I can just add liquidity by using one of the tokens that's actually in the pool, like USDC or ether. But I can also use the most liquid stable coins and tokens in Defi, like dai tether link wrapped bitcoin. And so at the end of the day, what's happening here is if I were to go in with, let's say, tether, Zapper will swap out my tether, it'll split it 50 50 into USDC and ether. And so this is a lot of manual work that all of us had gotten used to over the last few years that's been consolidated now into an automated money software. And then the last piece of the puzzle is just the fact that we offer a Dex aggregator. This is what matcha is by Zerox, that Dex aggregator, their API is what powers this exchange.
00:15:06.110 - 00:15:17.750, Speaker D: So if you like matcha, if you feel like you're getting the best rates and the least amount of slippage there, you can actually trade within Zapper now using the power of the Zero X API.
00:15:18.650 - 00:15:42.286, Speaker A: So, dad and Seb, Zapper is a previous sponsor of the Bankless podcast. So I guess, full disclosure there, but the way that I described it in the ad read was like the 2017 bull market was characterized by pulling out your blockfolio and just refreshing it all day, all day, every single day. And that was fun times.
00:15:42.468 - 00:15:45.486, Speaker D: Has that changed? I've been doing that for three years now.
00:15:45.588 - 00:16:41.060, Speaker A: Yeah, but now I just go to Zapper and I just hit refresh, refresh, refresh. And the difference between blockfolio and Zapper is that zapper, you load up your wallets, and with blockfolio, you have to manually input your trades, your assets, especially with things like rebasing tokens that doesn't even work in blockfolio these days. And so Zapper, it's going directly to the source of what the data is. And the best part about it is you can have multiple wallets, right? And so I think this next bull market is just going to be characterized by just like refreshing Zapper over and over and over again. But that's just like only one half of the product. The other half of the product is what you were just explaining, dad, where you were saying you can access defi things in a more efficient route. When you put those two pieces of zapper together, is that the whole product or is there other stuff as well?
00:16:42.550 - 00:17:32.786, Speaker C: So like we see Zapper. There's two aspects, right? There's the UI aspect, so there's the, you know, the interface that everyone sees. But the other side of the product that isn't as well known is what's powering all these possibilities through those transactions. So it's the UX part, right? And that's a part of the product that we're working to gear towards more developer audience. So basically could help us build out new zaps. So yeah, right now, the more well known of the product is the zapper fi that everyone sees. But there's also another part which is in our docs where people could actually play with zaps and build out new variations of them.
00:17:32.968 - 00:18:31.560, Speaker B: So cool. It's almost like a netscape for seeing and being able to do something with all of the money legos that are being built out on Defi right there. So that's an early Internet analogy. I also want to talk about another kind of early Internet analogy, which is how you guys built Zapper. What's the story there? Because you think about if somebody wants to start a fintech company on the traditional banking stack, it is really damn hard, right? Like all of these APIs you have to plug into all of these kind of regulatory requirements, all of these relationships you have to have. I think that's different when you're building on Ethereum, when you're building on DeFi. Because seb, correct me if I'm wrong, you guys started as a hackathon project, right? Can you tell us the story of how Zapper was actually built?
00:18:32.170 - 00:19:10.658, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So Zapper's story is kind of like interesting. One where it came from two small side projects that got together. So the first part was Defi zap, which was really the transactional aspect. So you would go on the website and be able to enter a pool with one input. The other side was Defi snap, which was this pretty much what you see on Zapper today when you land on the front page, is being able to just track all your assets. So I came from the Defi snap side.
00:19:10.658 - 00:19:48.382, Speaker C: So perhaps I could tell a bit more of that side of the story. So, yeah, during fall, that's where I really started to look into DeFi, do a little bit of investments here and there. And at one point, it was just really hard to track my own assets. So, yeah, I had this crazy spreadsheet going, and it was becoming really hard to maintain. At one point, it was almost like, okay, well, building a web app that would do this would be easier to just maintain my spreadsheet. So, yeah, that's where I started Defi snap. And originally, it was just a very small use case.
00:19:48.382 - 00:20:06.660, Speaker C: It was just synthetics and uniswap, because those were the two projects I was using the most. So it was just something I built for myself, and then just published a link on the synthetics discord in January, and from there, it really just had this crazy snowball effect.
00:20:07.110 - 00:20:10.070, Speaker B: Was that January of this year? January 2020?
00:20:10.220 - 00:20:10.630, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:10.700 - 00:20:14.326, Speaker B: Wow. Okay. I didn't realize it was that new. Wow.
00:20:14.428 - 00:20:46.622, Speaker C: No, yeah, it's crazy. Last year, to this day, I had another job working at Shakepe in Canada. So, yeah, it's crazy how fast all of this happened. And I think the, you know, in May 1, we merged. So that was the official day that Zapper was founded. And it was kind of like being at the right place at the right time, because we never saw yield farming exploding. I guess nobody really saw it.
00:20:46.622 - 00:21:02.946, Speaker C: And Zapper was in a perfect place in the market to leverage that, because we helped people go into pools and stake those assets. So we were just like the yield farmers product. And from there, that's kind of like where we got all this crazy traction.
00:21:03.058 - 00:21:26.854, Speaker B: Less than a year, small team built it, didn't need to ask anyone's permission, and it's already as powerful as it is now. I think that's the story here, Seb. I think this is a perfect time to ask the first community question. I'm going to ask this. This is from an anonymous source. It's not from David or I. So let's talk about Defi zap plus defi snap.
00:21:26.854 - 00:21:34.702, Speaker B: So, Seb, you were a main coder there, and then noter was the other coder. Who's the better coder between you guys? Is Seb better or is noder better?
00:21:34.756 - 00:21:52.146, Speaker C: Oh, my. Well, so Nodar doesn't code. He codes a bit. From the defi zap side, there's Nodar and Suhail. Suhail is a magician with smart contracts. So Suhail is definitely better than me on the smart contract. Nodar is more like this financial engineer.
00:21:52.146 - 00:22:05.594, Speaker C: He has these really good ideas around building these new zaps, and I'm more of, like, the front end, so I can't say who's the best coder per se. We all have kind of our own.
00:22:05.712 - 00:22:14.300, Speaker B: Expertise, and you definitely have one of the best educators in the space. Defi dad. That's fantastic pickup. Defi dad, when did you join the team?
00:22:14.830 - 00:23:05.102, Speaker D: Gosh, I only joined, I think it was, what, end of August or mid August? So I had been using Zapper forever, like all of us. And by forever, I mean for six months or whenever it. But I used D five zaps back in November when Nodar and Suhail had launched around. It was like November 2019. And at that point, we were all so excited because DFI was gaining traction and we were headed towards a billion in total value locked. And then along comes this idea of zaps, which to me was like, whoa, okay, so I no longer have to explain all these steps for one of my friends to get into a liquidity pool. I can just send them a link and just say, just follow this and deposit your money, and it'll do all the hard stuff for you.
00:23:05.102 - 00:23:50.620, Speaker D: Splitting your tokens and creating the liquidity provision. So then when they combined forces, being able to track your portfolio plus zaps, it was like, all right, now this is becoming like a hub for both newbies and sophisticated users. And then, yeah, I feel just really lucky. You guys know, I was working at consensus. I mostly focused on the ethereal summit, and I was spending all of my time creating tutorials and trying to educate on DeFi. So it made a lot of sense to work on a platform that is like an on ramp for DeFi users. So, yeah, been since August, and it's been really fun.
00:23:50.620 - 00:23:53.820, Speaker D: I have a tough time shutting off from work right now.
00:23:55.310 - 00:24:06.014, Speaker A: And for all those people that have watched my ether triple point asset talk at ethereal, you can thank DFI dad for that one. He's the one that got me up on that stage. So tip of the hat for that.
00:24:06.132 - 00:24:37.974, Speaker D: You know what's interesting, David? Go back to ethereal in Tel Aviv in 2019. So this was in the fall, it was, I think, September, and we had a stage dedicated to DFI. We called it the stage. Now, granted, DFI already had, like, a pretty awesome community, maybe like a few thousand that were paying close attention, a few hundred that were really hyper involved. And, man, I had so much pushback from so many people. Like, why are you dedicating all this time to this topic?
00:24:38.102 - 00:24:39.820, Speaker A: What's this DeFi thing.
00:24:42.190 - 00:25:21.286, Speaker D: Talk on ether as a triple point asset? We had a bunch of folks like pull together was really new as well. And Kyber network was very well established actually. Also our brothers from Xerion, they were there as well, talking about all the cool stuff they do tracking DFI portfolios. So it was only a year ago, but it's nuts how so much of this now has become accepted truth to all of us that DFI is here for the long run and that 15 billion in total value locked is nothing compared to where we're going.
00:25:21.388 - 00:25:34.170, Speaker A: Yeah, that's where I met Layton from pool together. And that's where I met Tom from Delphi. And so that was the hot stage. So dad, you've been leading the charge with making sure that DeFi is in everyone's.
00:25:35.070 - 00:25:41.230, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, so much. Anyway, we've had a great year. It's been really exciting year.
00:25:41.300 - 00:26:32.670, Speaker A: I do want to go back to what Seb was talking about with. So there's the world of building smart contracts, right? But Nodar is the financial engineer and that's almost like a coder in of themselves. In the DeFi world, you can't just have somebody who's good at solidity, you have to instruct them. Okay, what are we going to do with all of this financial money Legos? You need literally an engineer to put all the Legos together and construct them in a particular way. And what I see going on in the background of Zapper is that you have these financial engineers who I guess is Nodar. And I'm sure there's others as well who are learning how to construct these money Legos into actual structures that you turn into products on Zapper. Seb, can you talk about the side of financial engineering and how important that is to zapper?
00:26:33.090 - 00:27:39.300, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's a super important side because when building a smart contract, you could be a smart contract ninja and know all the solidity tricks. But if you're missing all the financial context, then you can't really build a useful smart contract within the application of Defi. So there's a whole side of building the smart contract, which is the whole financial context. And that's definitely something that's very hard to do as a lot of the exploits or hacks we've seen. They're not all smart contract bugs. A lot of them are smart contracts that didn't think of all the economic context that was going around that smart contract, which is super important to keep in mind when building. So yeah, that's a side that we're definitely very focused on, because you can't just focus strictly on the code itself and not think of all these different moving.
00:27:39.300 - 00:28:01.420, Speaker C: Know, I've read a lot about, I think Kane or another synthetics team was talking about how their process for developing new smart contract changed as more synthetics pieces got not swallowed necessarily, but plugged into other protocols. So that's a whole new side of things that you have to factor in.
00:28:01.870 - 00:28:15.118, Speaker B: Got a question that I want to throw in that is fairly well upvoted in discord and on YouTube from corpy. So do you guys plan to have a token? And if they answer that question, why.
00:28:15.124 - 00:28:16.320, Speaker A: Is the answer yes?
00:28:17.590 - 00:28:25.220, Speaker B: Well, let's assume that there's some optionality here. If the answer is yes, what would the token be used for? Is the question.
00:28:26.230 - 00:29:21.206, Speaker C: Yeah, so, I mean, that's always a tricky question to answer. We kind of reposition that whole question into thinking, what do we see Zapper being long term? And we see Zapper as being this community owned project. And the way we kind of tackle it is we don't see ZApPer well, the core team being able to build all the zaps, add all the new protocol integrations, like, we're seeing DeFi explode, and it's hard for us to be able to track everything and add things. We also don't want to be in a position where we kind of decide which protocol to add. We don't want to be some sort of defi referee either. So moving forward, we're trying to figure out what the best model is to achieve that long term vision. And if a token is the way we go there, then yeah, that's something we'll look into doing for sure.
00:29:21.388 - 00:29:35.660, Speaker B: Let's throw in another reader question here. So this is a question about your plans to expand beyond eth to other blockchains. Any thoughts on that?
00:29:38.510 - 00:29:44.160, Speaker D: Yeah, where does that fit into the product roadmap? Definitely something we about for sure.
00:29:45.730 - 00:29:53.550, Speaker B: Maybe also include L2 in that. I suppose that's part of an ETH offshoot, but it is, in a way, it's another kind of blockchain.
00:29:54.610 - 00:30:37.146, Speaker C: Yeah, I think right now we're definitely focused on Ethereum. That's where we believe most of the Defi activity will come from. But we're also like, if we see a lot of activity going on, other know, we definitely want to put aside our own beliefs in Defi and focus on our users. We basically want to help users participate in decentralized finance. And if Defi is going to be a multi chain thing, then we'll definitely want to support people across chains. So far, we don't see that much. Not necessarily traction, but users asking us to integrate other chains.
00:30:37.146 - 00:30:40.398, Speaker C: But that's something we're always keeping in mind.
00:30:40.564 - 00:31:00.758, Speaker B: Is there anything of those chains, like, anything kind of on your radar? A little bit like maybe in the cosmos ecosystem or in the Polkadot ecosystem that you haven't put to the front, but you're just monitoring and seeing how they emerge. Any interesting projects or ecosystems that you think are out there?
00:31:00.844 - 00:31:30.654, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I mean, Polkadot, there's a few side chains that are parachain. Sorry. That are looking to integrate the evm. So it'd be really interfaceable with Ethereum, which I find super interesting. So when that is actually launched, we could see some traction there. Other projects, I mean, we do see traction from binance smart chain. We haven't really researched on it.
00:31:30.654 - 00:31:46.178, Speaker C: We don't have any opinion so far on that. But we do see some Defi projects, specifically in Asia, tackling that market. So it's definitely worth it for us to take a look and see if there's possibilities there as well.
00:31:46.264 - 00:32:18.666, Speaker B: Can I ask you about. So it's something I've struggled with. Neither of you guys can answer here. At what point does a base chain get to the point where we can no longer really call it Defi? Right. So if Coinbase had an EVM on a Coinbase maintained ledger. Right, and anyone could develop on it, maybe you don't require Coinbase's permission. Is that Defi? Is the binance chain.
00:32:18.666 - 00:32:56.438, Speaker B: DeFi, if it has hand selected validators from binance, is Polkadot defi if it has governance in the hands of a small set of individuals. It's something that I personally struggle with the definition of DeFi, which is why I think David and I have talked about before, we like the term open finance a little bit better because it sort of embraces all of them. And sometimes when we. And we go with the meme. DeFi, right, Defi. Defi, of course. But it's not always decentralized.
00:32:56.438 - 00:32:58.380, Speaker B: How do you guys think about that?
00:33:00.110 - 00:34:01.594, Speaker D: I can chime in here. I recognize that DFI has become somewhat of a marketing term. But when I try to classify, like what is DFI? I think about, am I 100% in control of my funds? Ideally, there should not be an admin key that can put my funds at risk. But then what I just said, I've clearly been forgiving with projects that are in the spectrum of moving towards being truly decentralized and getting rid of some of those admin keys. Gosh, what else there? I think about, of course, there being no middlemen, just the usual stuff like only interacting with smart contracts. And it's hard to ignore the fact that there's just all the momentum is on Ethereum right now. But I think we as a team have been, we definitely have a philosophy on the team of trying to be open to new ideas and curious about what's being built on other chains.
00:34:01.594 - 00:34:39.494, Speaker D: And I think you guys have called them out already. We've definitely been thinking and watching, I guess like a Polkadot cosmos. Binance smart chain. I think binance smart chain comes up the most. Know, we have a lot of zapper users in China and other parts of Asia, so we really try to listen to do every Friday we do like an open forum and folks can just ask Defi questions or give us feedback. So that's some of the feedback we've gotten. I will say this, probably the lowest hanging fruit for us to integrate another chain is bitcoin.
00:34:39.494 - 00:35:15.842, Speaker D: We could show the balance of bitcoin in a zapper portfolio, hopefully in the future. We've actually gotten a lot of good feedback from our community saying, yes, I would love to see bitcoin, just whatever I've got in a wallet, because frankly, you can't do anything else with bitcoin. You can just see it in that wallet if it's on the bitcoin blockchain. So that would be really, I think, interesting. And I'm hoping that that's something that we can implement sooner versus I think the more challenging endeavor of incorporating other smart contract blockchain.
00:35:15.906 - 00:35:21.690, Speaker B: And that would be native bitcoin on the bitcoin blockchain rather than something like a wrapped BTC.
00:35:22.750 - 00:36:03.046, Speaker D: That's right. That's what we're talking about. I don't think that we're looking at this now, but I've definitely thought before maybe in the future for folks that are using a centralized finance service, something like a blockfi, if they've got, let's say, bitcoin there, maybe that's something we'll do. But I think the key takeaway here is there is so much to support right now just in DeFi. It's so overwhelming. And I think I have a fresh perspective as someone also who's not a developer. I like look at what Seb and the team does.
00:36:03.046 - 00:36:26.800, Speaker D: The team is composed of seven engineers, and then two of us are not engineers. And I mean, it's just overwhelming. I don't know when Seb or the other sleep. It feels like we're always having to support a new yield farming pool, a new token. So, yeah, it's definitely exciting times.
00:36:27.170 - 00:37:35.870, Speaker A: And Ryan, the way that you presented this question is like, well, is polkadot Defi is like binance chain Defi? Well, also we have that same question natively on Ethereum, right? Like, are NFTs defi? Because who makes the legitimacy of an NFT? Right, realty tokenized real estate on Ethereum is that defi? You can use it as collateral, but the house is secured by a company. Right? So there's this big spectrum of things, of questions about how do we even answer this question? How do we even ask the question to begin with? And when the question turns to like, okay, the assumptions that I'm making, that if it's close to Defi and because of the power of Ethereum, Ethereum can figure out how to latch onto it, right? Like Ethereum. The way that Anthony Suzano keeps on presenting Ethereum is as this economic nexus, right? And Zapper is looking at the heart of that nexus and kind of growing out from there. It's like, okay, here's a token that everyone uses. Here's an app that everyone uses. Let's integrate that. And because of the power of Ethereum has the ability to grow its arms, grow its tentacles into every single other chain via bridges.
00:37:35.870 - 00:38:28.580, Speaker A: I think it's reasonable to assume that at some point in the future it's going to be able to. You can query Ethereum to get a bitcoin balance on the bitcoin blockchain. Right? And so you can actually go through Ethereum to binance chain, to the coinbase, roll up to insert your bridge here. And you can use Ethereum as that economics hub to reach out to other blockchains and query data and create a zap around other blockchains that integrate with other blockchains, as Ethereum becomes able to integrate with other blockchains. Because what zapper really needs is data about other chains, and what Ethereum needs is data about other chains. And so if these teams that are working on building out these bridges do their job correctly, to me, it seems to be that zapper could just follow in the bridges that are built. I'm not very technical, but Seb, did that resonate with you? Does that sound about right?
00:38:28.950 - 00:38:48.780, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it does in a sense that that's kind of like, what kind of is happening with zapperware? It started from a few tokens and then they got wrapped and then they are put in the pool and then that pool is put somewhere else and it's just spreading growing up from there. Right, exactly.
00:38:49.630 - 00:39:28.438, Speaker B: I think you guys are going to be quite busy with L2 as well when that comes up on ethereum. All right, I want to get to another YouTube question that goes off a little bit of what you're saying. And the comment is, first, I love Zapper, but only a tiny fraction of my assets are visible on there. Wish there was a way to add my own assets and farms. Maybe there is and I just don't know. So I think that goes to what you were saying earlier. Defi dad is like, you guys are just trying to keep up with everything that's going on and add features for all of the money laggers that are happening, but there's going to be some that you haven't quite got to yet.
00:39:28.438 - 00:39:35.420, Speaker B: And is there any customization ability for users coming down the pike? How do you think about that use case?
00:39:36.350 - 00:40:03.842, Speaker C: Yeah, we're actually starting to implement a process where users will be able to add their own tokens. As for farms, it's always a bit tricky because we don't want to add stuff that could potentially be dangerous or not vetted. Like we've seen so many rug pulls and we're always very careful with the things we add.
00:40:03.976 - 00:40:11.798, Speaker B: Support for on Zapper, like Steph, like something like sushi. When it came out, did you add it right away or did you not?
00:40:11.964 - 00:40:45.578, Speaker C: So we added the ability to view your balances, but transacting, we didn't add it yet. So that's kind of like there's two sides. One is just being able to view their balance. So on that side we're much less strict on whatever we add. On the transaction side, we don't want people putting money into something that might be rug pulled in the future. So we're very careful with what we had. Like for yield farming, most of the contracts were all the same.
00:40:45.578 - 00:41:04.600, Speaker C: There were reused smart contracts. So a lot of these farms, they were safe to add because we knew those smart contracts and they were very tested. A lot of money came through them. So, yeah, we felt safe to add those.
00:41:05.050 - 00:41:16.620, Speaker A: So we got another question from Callum from the YouTube. Thanks, Callum, for the question. What are your thoughts on the infuria outage and how did this affect zapper? Any thoughts on solutions to these kinds of issues?
00:41:18.110 - 00:42:20.830, Speaker C: Yeah, we did have a bit of downtime because of the infuria outage, but right now we have a strategy where we use multiple node as a service providers. So the first is infira and then we've been using as a fallback pocket, which is a decentralized node infrastructure protocol. And in the future we see much more of that being brought forward as a solution. Now, the thing is, these decentralized protocols aren't at the point where it's say, as fast or reliable as an inferior, like from Zapper's standpoint, our goal is to have balances load as fast as possible. So that always factors in the decision to choose the right infrastructure. So right now, yeah, our strategy is we have some fallbacks to different nodes, but long term we do want to align with more of a decentralized node infrastructure.
00:42:21.250 - 00:42:44.600, Speaker B: Yeah. So I guess a follow up on that, there's been a lot of, I guess, fud out there about defi being centralized on infuria. What's your take on that in general? Are there many node providers out there that folks like your team can use, or is it a legitimate problem?
00:42:45.210 - 00:43:30.790, Speaker C: I think it used to be much more of a problem, but right now I think there's a lot of options out there. There's infuria, there's alchemy, there's quicknode. It's also much easier to run your own node, and there's more decentralized projects popping. And potentially this infuria outage will just create more market pressure into creating these decentralized products. So I really don't see it as big of a problem as it used to. It is something we have to look into because, yeah, a lot of products went down during the inferior outage, but, yeah, hopefully it does create this market pressure.
00:43:32.730 - 00:43:33.570, Speaker A: Go ahead, dad.
00:43:33.650 - 00:43:57.582, Speaker D: Right. There's always room for improvement. And I think that was a bit of a scary thing yesterday. I actually, fortunately wasn't awake. I woke up and it had already been resolved. But I think that goes back to, what's the term that I've heard you guys use it on your podcast, like antifragile. Antifragility, yeah, fragility, yeah.
00:43:57.582 - 00:44:12.434, Speaker D: And so anything that doesn't kill us makes us stronger. And I do feel like that was yet another thing that is not something to brush under the rug, but also, at the same time, we're still here.
00:44:12.632 - 00:44:28.546, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess for folks that don't know about it, just real quick. Right, so infura provides a lot of node services, Ethereum node services to applications, but also wallets. Right. And they are a consensus project, famously.
00:44:28.578 - 00:44:34.374, Speaker A: An attack vector from bitcoiners who are like, oh, ethereums don't run their own nodes. Then that's blah, blah, blah, blah.
00:44:34.422 - 00:44:53.790, Speaker B: Right. And metamask runs on it. And they had an outage because they were using an old version of an Ethereum client, geth, essentially. How long was that outage? Just a couple of hours. And it sort of sent defi into some tumult yesterday. So anyway, that's the GLDR on that.
00:44:53.940 - 00:45:02.500, Speaker D: That also too, like, those criticisms normally come from people who push you to put your crypto on Kraken block buy.
00:45:05.110 - 00:45:06.050, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:45:06.200 - 00:45:28.858, Speaker D: Critical of all the experimentation, and yet there's just so many folks that are so reliant upon that centralized exchange infrastructure, and I just don't get it. We should all be pushing for these new innovations. And thank God for the Ethereum community continually pushing the envelope on this.
00:45:29.024 - 00:46:04.902, Speaker A: So we have another question. I want to ask questions about Ethereum staking in phase zero. But first I want to get to this question from YouTube is another idea. Totally dgen, perhaps. But would you allow devs to create strategies as zaps? Perhaps you can have a list which the zapper team deems as safe and which ones are, like, wild. And that kind of makes me think of how the dune analytics boards have community generated boards that you can go and check out. And that's a great way to just put the ball in the community's court and saying, here's a dune analytics board that I use.
00:46:04.902 - 00:46:06.502, Speaker A: Maybe you kind of find it useful, too.
00:46:06.556 - 00:46:06.774, Speaker B: Maybe.
00:46:06.812 - 00:46:11.900, Speaker A: Is that something that you guys were thinking about? Like, here's a zap that I use, and maybe you can also use it as well.
00:46:13.470 - 00:46:26.060, Speaker D: That's such a cool idea. And we're aligned with trying to make it easier for folks to build zaps. And then in some way or another, I guess you could maybe rank them like you were saying.
00:46:27.710 - 00:46:37.330, Speaker B: And by the way, have you guys ever used that program? If this, then that, it kind of reminds me of that idea, right? Like where you have these modules, you just kind of string them together. Go ahead, zeb.
00:46:37.830 - 00:47:13.820, Speaker C: No, yeah, that's a great idea. And something we're really looking into building is zaps have a bunch of different blocks that are consistent across all our zaps, and people could just use pick and choose from those and create a new zap. And then potentially the community could create all the community generated zaps and rank them. There could be like a safety metric or you could see the volume that went through. So, yeah, that's definitely something we're looking into.
00:47:14.590 - 00:47:24.080, Speaker A: Okay, so with phase zero and the beacon chain up and running and the deposit contract here, is there anything coming out of the zapper camp to kind of help facilitate this.
00:47:26.950 - 00:47:56.842, Speaker C: So, so far there aren't any plans. Our roadmap is filled with new protocol integrations, these low hanging fruits. But if it's something that's heavily requested by users, we'll definitely look into it. Our roadmap basically changes all the time. Sometimes I don't even know what I'm going to work on the next week or even like just tomorrow. Right. Something can happen and be okay.
00:47:56.842 - 00:48:02.890, Speaker C: Let's add this one then. So, yeah, we always keep a pulse on what our users are asking.
00:48:03.040 - 00:48:54.966, Speaker D: I think that's a week ago. Whenever the deposit contract launched, I think someone on the team was looking into how could we potentially in the future show, like, let's say you deposit into the beacon chain contract. The talk was, could we show that and support that? So I think as Seb was saying, we're normally just reacting as quickly as possible, but this seems like a pretty big deal. I mean, I would anticipate what the first deadline is December 1, and then the other one is the 24 December. Yeah. If folks are interested or just want to voice their support of that, which I'm sure there's unending support for this. You can hop into our discord group if you just go to Zapper Fi.
00:48:54.966 - 00:49:04.320, Speaker D: There's a link to go there also too. Don't be afraid to. I'm going to regret this. Don't be afraid to dm me on Twitter or discord. We always pass that along.
00:49:04.850 - 00:49:10.910, Speaker C: And just to clarify, you can see your staked balances in the staking contract.
00:49:10.990 - 00:49:11.620, Speaker D: Nice.
00:49:12.390 - 00:49:13.300, Speaker A: What else?
00:49:13.830 - 00:49:15.154, Speaker D: I didn't know that either.
00:49:15.272 - 00:49:19.282, Speaker C: Yeah, so there's so many things going on. Yeah, we have that.
00:49:19.336 - 00:49:21.874, Speaker D: Okay. Good job, team.
00:49:21.992 - 00:49:31.450, Speaker A: Is there anything about the e two roadmap that you guys are thinking about and that's impacting the development of Zapper? How does Eth two impact what you guys are doing at Zapper?
00:49:32.270 - 00:49:58.100, Speaker C: Yeah, that's such a good question. And honestly, I don't have any immediate ideas about how we'll do it. It's very nebulous. I think a lot of devs, and as we move more towards that, we'll definitely look into how Zapper interfaces with eth two.
00:49:59.030 - 00:50:56.130, Speaker B: So this is a question from Jag Tapper, who is asking what the long term game plan of roadmap is for. Zapper says zapping is super convenient, but I'm sure you've got more ideas in mind. I feel like we've been talking about a lot of those ideas. So take that question and also reframe it a little bit. We've been talking about Zapper as almost like a netscape, right, to all of these money legos. And there was this moment in the early Internet, people call it the netscape moment, right, where Netscape came out and people used it and they saw, wow, there's this entirely new digital world that's opening before us, and Netscape was sort of the browser into that. When do you think is Defi going to ever have its netscape moment? And if it does, how is Zapper going to be involved? What's it going to require to take Defi mainstream?
00:50:57.510 - 00:51:17.450, Speaker D: Hey, guys, by the way, I've got to hop over to yield tv. I just wanted to quickly say thank you. Seb's going to keep going here, and Seb's the person you need to talk with more. He's got all the answers. But just thank you so much. This was really fun, and I always appreciate just what you guys are doing at bankless. It's the Lord's work in Defi.
00:51:17.950 - 00:51:19.526, Speaker B: Thanks, Defi, dad.
00:51:19.718 - 00:51:20.794, Speaker D: I'll catch you guys.
00:51:20.912 - 00:51:21.450, Speaker B: See you later.
00:51:21.520 - 00:51:22.890, Speaker A: Thanks for being here, dad.
00:51:25.250 - 00:52:21.194, Speaker C: Yeah, Ryan, that's such an interesting question, because it's hard to say if Defi is going to have a netscape moment like this. Oh, my God, this is amazing. What we've seen so far is there's these moments in DeFi where, like the yield farming craze, that was like a huge moment for Defi where a lot of people came in and obviously some left, but a lot of them stayed. And what will that next big thing for DeFi be? Will it be like this netscape type moment? I talk a lot about Defi to my friends and see how Defi can tap into the market, which is exterior to crypto. Because if you just look at Defi, right, it's still digging within the crypto market. I don't see often people completely out of context of crypto hopping directly into Defi.
00:52:21.242 - 00:52:22.494, Speaker B: It's all crypto native still.
00:52:22.532 - 00:52:31.394, Speaker C: Right, exactly. So do you refer as that netscape moment where it goes outside of the crypto native space?
00:52:31.512 - 00:52:41.480, Speaker B: Yeah, a bit more. I think that's the idea, that there's this one moment where the world just becomes captured by Defi and crypto and floods in.
00:52:42.010 - 00:53:10.126, Speaker C: Yeah, man, that's such a good question. I think we still have ways to go to have non crypto people. I think crypto still needs to be more perhaps just in the back of people's minds. I think the current economic situation has brought a lot of that, but I kind of lost my train of thought there.
00:53:10.148 - 00:53:31.000, Speaker B: But yeah, it's getting to the point, though, with Zapper that normies can use this. Friends able, your non crypto friends, are they able to use Zapper, but you're saying they just don't have the use cases that would just draw them into it at this point in time? Or is the UX still a little too difficult?
00:53:31.530 - 00:54:28.662, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's a lot on the information side. Everyone can click around the buttons on Zapper, but if the information makes absolutely no sense of them, they're not going to go through. There's a lot of context to bring and a lot of financial education because you look at a lot of people using Defi. A lot of them have a good background or some sort of background in finance. But as Defi is being easier and easier to use, more of this is being abstracted away. And I see it in two ways. One is, will defi just reduce the information asymmetry and the asymmetry and opportunity and more people will use it? Or will a lot of defi just be completely abstracted away? Kind of more like a really easy to use banking app where you put money and then it earns yield for you.
00:54:28.662 - 00:55:07.198, Speaker C: So it's going to be interesting what ways it's going to play in. Like at Zapper, our thesis is always like, we're not focusing on the market outside of Zapper. We see Defi as this circle that keeps expanding and where we want to be is at the edges because that's where we acquire new users and new customers. And we're focused on that ever expanding circle and looking to add features just at the edges of that circle. And eventually we see that blowing into much more mainstream audience.
00:55:07.374 - 00:55:23.574, Speaker B: Reminds me a lot of our conversation with Andre from wire and protocol and how he said, I don't have a long term plan, I'm just building the next great feature and that's going to keep me busy. And as long as I'm doing that, we're making progress. So it sounds similar. Maybe we're all in that camp.
00:55:23.772 - 00:55:41.120, Speaker A: Well, how can you have a long term plan in Defi, in crypto, right? No one saw yield farming coming, and there's going to be something new in two months. And no one's going to see that coming either. It just feels like that. Wallace and Gromit gif where I think Gromit is on the train and he's just throwing the tracks in front of him, right?
00:55:43.410 - 00:55:46.750, Speaker C: Yeah, that's definitely a day at the office at Zapper?
00:55:47.650 - 00:56:00.178, Speaker A: Well, I mean, being able to be nimble and move quickly is really advantageous. And that's definitely what we see coming out of the Zapper camp. Seb, are you guys hiring? How can people help lay the tracks for Zapper?
00:56:00.354 - 00:56:23.130, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we're always open to get new people on board that believe in Defi and our vision of Zapper, of making defi easy to use. So, yeah, we always have positions open, whatever the position. We kind of have the philosophy where you come into Zapper and you create your own role and. Yeah, very open, very cool.
00:56:23.200 - 00:56:32.510, Speaker A: And so last question just to wrap this up. How can the bankless nation help? Like, what can Zapper do for the bankless nation? And what can the bankless nation do for Zapper?
00:56:32.850 - 00:56:54.470, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, happy to get any type of feedback. If there's things that Zapper is missing or types of functionalities, happy to get any feedback. You can hop in our discord. We're pretty active there, and we have a really fast development cycle. So happy to build anything that the bankless nation requests.
00:56:55.930 - 00:57:16.222, Speaker A: All right, pretty cool, seb, thank you for being here. And also thanks to DFI dad who had to hop off. So, yeah, guys, check them out. Zapper phi, load up your wallets. See what it shows you. I always like to tell a story of, like, when I loaded up my zapper wallet, I found like $25 of liquidity in uniswap that forgot that I had been supplying. And so I was like, oh, nice.
00:57:16.222 - 00:57:23.278, Speaker A: I found some, found some money in a pocket that I didn't know I had. So that's always a fun time. So, seb, thanks for being here.
00:57:23.444 - 00:57:26.874, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you very much. It was great. Thank you, David. Thank you, Ryan.
00:57:27.002 - 00:57:28.480, Speaker B: Appreciate it. Take care.
00:57:28.930 - 00:57:30.810, Speaker C: All right, bye, guys. Bye.
