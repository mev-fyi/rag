00:00:00.330 - 00:00:10.000, Speaker A: The sky is starting to clear. Like we all, the trash has already floated up to the surface and we've already started to start doing a lot of that cleaning. I'm feeling pretty good.
00:00:12.050 - 00:00:35.670, Speaker B: Bankless nation, it is the second week of July. I hope you are enjoying your Friday morning because it's time for the weekly roll up. I said it this time, not you, David, but how you doing, man? On the second week of July, crypto still being kind of crazy. We're getting some liquidations, we're getting some bankruptcies, some consolidation on the market. How are you feeling about pretty, pretty good, I'd say.
00:00:35.820 - 00:00:56.174, Speaker A: Successful sepoilia Testnet merge, two of three testnets ready to go. Is Gorley next? And like, meanwhile, the blockfi story has, I think, concluded. That story is over. We're going to recap the conclusion of that story. Voyager goes bust. But we already knew that. The final death of three arrows capital, we kind of already knew that, too.
00:00:56.174 - 00:01:12.018, Speaker A: And also Reddit and Facebook doing nFT things and no one really noticed it. And so, Ryan, we're also a little bit great. We're actually more than a little bit green right now. Again, positive news on the merge. No more contagion. I feel pretty good.
00:01:12.104 - 00:01:16.738, Speaker B: Things are getting cleaned up together.
00:01:16.824 - 00:01:27.090, Speaker A: The sky is starting to clear. All the trash has already floated up to the surface, and we've already started to start doing a lot of that cleaning. I'm feeling pretty good. How are you feeling?
00:01:27.170 - 00:02:06.254, Speaker B: Yeah, you know what? I think that the contagion might be over at least this first pass unless we get another big leg down. Right. So I'm always cautious to say that, but we've had a lot of crypto banks go under and that's been the story. And we're going to continue talking about it this week as well as everything that else that is going on in crypto, including macro stuff. As always, if you guys enjoy these weekly roll ups and bankless in general, make sure you like and subscribe. All right. On the podcast, that means making sure you're subscribed on YouTube, hitting that click subscribe button, and also giving us comments, throwing comments our way, and five stars reviews.
00:02:06.254 - 00:02:07.490, Speaker B: We always appreciate that.
00:02:07.560 - 00:02:10.230, Speaker A: David, have we told them to get their morning coffee yet?
00:02:10.380 - 00:02:12.050, Speaker B: Yeah, get your morning coffee.
00:02:12.130 - 00:02:12.882, Speaker A: Get your morning coffee.
00:02:12.946 - 00:02:15.410, Speaker B: Second cup. You probably already drank your first cup.
00:02:15.490 - 00:02:17.206, Speaker A: This would be a two cup roll up.
00:02:17.308 - 00:02:29.482, Speaker B: Let's talk about Juno, though. David, this is a crypto bank that we actually do like and we do recommend because it is an easy way to bridge onto L2. What is Juno doing for us.
00:02:29.616 - 00:02:44.234, Speaker A: Oh, my gosh. So much the coolest thing about Juno, it's a normal checking account. It's a know fun fact. I actually do have a bank account. That's how I pay rent. So we all need our checking accounts. It's the place that the money goes before you buy ether or bitcoin.
00:02:44.234 - 00:03:06.662, Speaker A: But with Juno, you can get from your checking account to a L2 on ethereum directly goes checking account to L2 immediately, in seconds. So that's kind of crazy. Free withdrawals. And so you don't have to deal with layer one gas fees, you don't have to deal with the bridge wait times. So that's already crazy. It's optimism. Arbitrum, I think, what else is there?
00:03:06.716 - 00:03:07.730, Speaker B: Polygon.
00:03:07.890 - 00:03:23.926, Speaker A: And then the DK roll ups are coming out soon. DK sync and starware. And then you can also trade crypto with zero fees. We like zero fees. We like crypto assets. And then if you so choose, you can get 6% on your USDC and 3% on your bitcoin and ether.
00:03:24.038 - 00:03:41.618, Speaker B: What I also love is they'll convert your paycheck. You can get your direct deposits into this, and they'll convert your paycheck into crypto. And then you can immediately withdraw that to L2. And some people are saying, well, you guys are bankless. Well, we still also live in the real world. I still have a Wells Fargo account. Sadly, I haven't been able to get rid of that.
00:03:41.618 - 00:04:14.138, Speaker B: But I do also have a Juno account because that is a Defi friendly crypto bank. Doesn't mean you have to keep all of your funds on Juno, right? Keep the minimum necessary in the banking system. But these fast withdrawals to L2 and all of this crypto native and defi native support is super useful. So go ahead and get your Juno account. There's a link in the show notes. Also, if you go to bankless cc Capitalj for Juno, you will be able to get that link and earn $10 when you deposit. David, let's talk about markets, man.
00:04:14.138 - 00:04:17.546, Speaker B: What are the markets doing? We actually have sunshine.
00:04:17.578 - 00:04:28.978, Speaker A: It's a green week. A little bit of sunshine. Yeah. So bitcoin started the week at $20,000. We are currently at $20,730, about 3.5% in the green. Ryan, 3.5%
00:04:28.978 - 00:04:30.594, Speaker A: above twenty k is a good day.
00:04:30.632 - 00:04:33.618, Speaker B: All right, how about Eth price? That's up even more.
00:04:33.704 - 00:04:46.646, Speaker A: Yeah. Are you ready for this one, Ryan? Ether started the week at $1,030. We are currently at one $215 that is 18%. That is 18% green. That's a big green week.
00:04:46.668 - 00:04:48.550, Speaker B: What is this? Are people bullish suddenly?
00:04:49.290 - 00:04:51.158, Speaker A: I didn't know that that was allowed in this market.
00:04:51.244 - 00:04:55.882, Speaker B: Well, let's look at the ratio, because that's also bullish. That must have gone up with the numbers you just quoted me.
00:04:55.936 - 00:05:03.262, Speaker A: Yes, up 8%. We are currently at 00:58, where we were down to 00:54 53 earlier this week.
00:05:03.316 - 00:05:09.520, Speaker B: You still believe this is a reliable bull market, bear market indicator. So it's a little bit bullish on the week.
00:05:10.050 - 00:05:27.470, Speaker A: It's a lagging indicator, not a leading indicator, but it's been up since June. The bottom was like June 10 or June Twelveth or something. So it's been slowly grinding up ever since June Twelveth, which was like, when this contagion started. So I guess a month of contagion in the rear view mirror, which is bullish.
00:05:27.550 - 00:05:50.954, Speaker B: Important to note, though, in these bear markets, there's always these fakeouts. Right? So what will happen? This happened in 2018. How many times did that happen? Where we'd go for a steep drop and then we'd recover and everyone's like, oh, here's the Ray of hope. There's the sunshine. Maybe we're out of it, and then boom, we get hit by another major drop. Happened a lot, and I had no.
00:05:50.992 - 00:05:58.478, Speaker A: Idea what the hell I was doing in 2008. Yeah, you're the elder millennial here.
00:05:58.564 - 00:06:24.562, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, man, I remember, and I thought a few times, I was like, okay, this has got to be it. This has got to be the end. We're still on our road to recovery, although I will say that the feeling is a little bit different this time. David, I feel like a lot of people have already capitulated to the fact that we are dead in a bear market, and we. You might be in a bear market for years at this point in time. And that, to me, is a good signal because we didn't see that in the first mega drops of 2018.
00:06:24.562 - 00:06:42.942, Speaker B: People were still in denial, and they spent more of this phase in denial in that, like, oh, maybe the bull market's not over. Maybe we'll just recover and things will shoot back up. Maybe this is another big dip. But what is the cryptocurrency chart telling us from a global perspective? How much value in crypto right now?
00:06:42.996 - 00:06:49.642, Speaker A: Yeah, total crypto market cap up from 934,000,000,000 to 976,000,000,000.
00:06:49.786 - 00:07:00.126, Speaker B: That's going up, too. Yeah. The sentiment, though, from a macro perspective, doesn't feel so great in an economic update. Here's a tweet. Could you read this one out, David?
00:07:00.238 - 00:07:20.680, Speaker A: Yeah. 58% of americans now living paycheck to paycheck. Consumer confidence lowest since 1950. Stock market having its worst year since 1970. Mortgage demand lowest since 2001. Credit card debt up 20% in one month. And then they followed these metrics up with the recession is just getting started.
00:07:20.680 - 00:07:51.842, Speaker A: This is where I always go back and forth. It's like, okay, these are all like lagging indicators, right? These are telling us, you know, the zeitgeist saw the times. Everyone feels bad because the stock market's down, no one's buying homes, everyone feels priced out of homes. Not only are homes still pretty highly priced, but the mortgages are really, really high. And you can see this choice, the economic conditions showing up in impacting consumers because they're having to load up on credit card debt. Credit card debt up 20% in one month. But these are all as a result of the last three months.
00:07:51.842 - 00:07:56.726, Speaker A: And I don't think they are indicative of the future three months, but they could be.
00:07:56.828 - 00:08:24.974, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a good marker of sentiment and I do think some of these data points are probably like selected. Right? So, for instance, this stock market having its worst year since 1970. Well, at the beginning of January, stock market was like close to all time highs. Right. So there's some data sampling here that is definitely skewing towards the bearish side. But definitely this r word, I'm seeing that everywhere now. The recession, recession, recession is just getting started.
00:08:24.974 - 00:08:41.326, Speaker B: And I feel like sentiment from an economic perspective has shifted towards everyone's now expecting a recession, even though that hasn't formally hit yet. But what's the US dollar doing? Because us dollar is still strong. It's looking good. In fact, it is pumping.
00:08:41.438 - 00:09:07.606, Speaker A: Yeah. For the first time ever, I think there's parity between the euro and the dollar at the moment. Not the first time ever, but first time as far as I can remember. Yeah. So the headline here, euro tumbles to a 20 year low, putting parity with a dollar in sight. The Dixie, the DXY, which is a chart that we don't have up, but it's the basket. It basically measures dollar strength versus a basket of other currencies, is continuing to increase.
00:09:07.606 - 00:09:59.354, Speaker A: And I think this is relevant to the dollar milkshake theory, if people are familiar with that. We had Bret Johnson on the podcast forever ago to talk about what the dollar milkshake theory is. Basically, it's the general theory that in economic hardship conditions, there's a flight to dollars, which is what you would expect in a downturn, people just flight of dollars, but also because there's so much debt pent up in the system that when it comes time to pay the debts, basically there's a squeeze on the dollar supply because everyone's trying to get their hands on dollars to pay back their debts. And so in bear markets, as we've seen in crypto, everyone, when numbers go down, people have to pay back their debts. This is why there's a discount on staked ETH, because people sell staked ETH for ether because they need that liquidity. People are just selling assets for dollars because they need liquidity. And therefore the dollar is really, really strong right now.
00:09:59.354 - 00:10:19.986, Speaker A: Sadly, this is also an indication of a future recession, because as dollar strength goes up, corporate profits go down like real rates go down, et cetera, et cetera. And so it slows growth. High dollar value slows growth, and that triggers a recession. In addition to all the other things that trigger recessions, the basic idea is.
00:10:20.008 - 00:10:47.818, Speaker B: The dollar drinks every other fiat currency's milkshake. That's why it's called the dollar milkshake theory. And we're seeing the euro at its lowest level since 2002. And yen is down even worse to its lowest level since 2001, which is pretty crazy. Another sign of recession, it feels like, is oil. So remember, we were very concerned about oil. Economists were very concerned about the price of oil shooting up for all sorts of different reasons, of course.
00:10:47.818 - 00:11:13.362, Speaker B: War in Ukraine, other reasons as well. Now oil has just tumbled as much as 10%. I don't know about you, David, but around me, gas prices were just down on the week. Down like gallon or something like that gallon. And it's incredible how fast that is happening. But of course, oil demand being down is another sign of recession. It could be a sign of waning inflation, too.
00:11:13.362 - 00:11:19.158, Speaker B: We don't know because inflation itself is also a lagging indicator. What are your thoughts on this?
00:11:19.244 - 00:12:08.662, Speaker A: Yeah, so this is a mixed data signal, right? Oil prices are down because people are buying less. Oil because people are buying less in general because of the quote unquote recession that we are currently in. Still debated whether we're in a recession or not. So demand for oil is down, but that's good because we need prices to go down because oil price goes down means food prices go down, which means inflation comes down, which is literally the only way out of this recession is if we get inflation to come down. So like mixed signal here. And it's kind of the signal that you want to see, we want to see oil prices come down as a result of killing demand. And so it kind of sucks that we're having to quell inflation by having a recession, but that's kind of the bargain that we made when we printed a bunch of stimmy checks two years ago.
00:12:08.716 - 00:12:53.410, Speaker B: This is definitely the bargain that Jerome Powell and the central bank explicitly wants to make. If you want more info on that, go tune into our Jim Bianco episode that we did a couple of weeks ago where he's basically like, the Fed has one big stick and it has to beat inflation over the head with it. And that stick is called recession. That stick is called making everyone feel bad so that they don't spend as much money and decreasing demand. That's the stick that we're getting beaten over the head with. So this is expected, as you'd say, a few interesting crypto numbers in the midst of all of this is. David, did you know that USDC, Circle's USDC is now on track to topple Tether USDT? I thought this would happen a couple of years ago because just circle is a regulatory.
00:12:53.410 - 00:13:02.982, Speaker B: From an assurances perspective, it's a more transparent dollar coin than tether. Looks like it's happening now.
00:13:03.036 - 00:13:51.046, Speaker A: I actually think it makes sense that tether took such a long time to dethrone. Hasn't been dethroned yet. But the regulatory gray area that tether lives in actually is one of the reasons why it's got adopted by so many people outside of the United States. But as soon as the United States takes a leadership position, which is being helped by regulatory, once the regulatory arm comes in and we all start to have regulatory fears, people go from tether to mean the writing has been on the wall for a while. Eventually crypto was going to become big enough where regulatory reasons are concerned. So you would naturally see that flow out of tether and into USDC, which is what happened, by the way, like tether has seen a decrease in total supply, but USDC's market cap has grown by 8.27% since May.
00:13:51.046 - 00:14:11.866, Speaker A: Highest level ever hit of total USD supply. 55.9 billion was hit on July 2. In contrast, UST suffered a 19% drop in total market cap and is currently at 66.14 billion. So USDC at basically 56 billion and tether at 66 billion. So not far away, you know what.
00:14:11.888 - 00:14:44.066, Speaker B: All the crypto bulls that I know, even if they're exiting some of their positions, their core crypto holding positions, unless they need the money to go pay bills, they're not exiting to fiat to like dollars in a bank account. They're exiting to something like USDT or USDC or DAi. Right to these stablecoins. So it's always interesting to me in these bear market cycles, you do tend to see stablecoin grow. Stablecoins appreciate in terms of total market cap because that's where people are parking. Their money isn't USDC.
00:14:44.178 - 00:15:02.814, Speaker A: Like if you own buy USDC and put it in your Ethereum wallet, which is, by the way, Ethereum is called an account based ledger system as opposed to bitcoin's Utxo unspent transaction output system. Anyways, when you buy USDC and put it in your Ethereum wallet, your Ethereum account, aren't you just using it? Isn't that like a proxy for a bank account?
00:15:02.932 - 00:15:04.670, Speaker B: Because USDC.
00:15:05.810 - 00:15:15.018, Speaker A: Yeah, USDC is one massive bank account. And then all USD account owners on Ethereum are one micro bank account. It's just another proxy for it. It is kind of cool, but it's.
00:15:15.034 - 00:15:40.086, Speaker B: On better rails, right? So I could send you as much as I want at any point in time. There's no banking hours. I don't have to go show up with my id to my bank in order to wire you funds. I can send it to any eTh. Like, it's still like, USDC and stablecoins are still a crypto superpower. Guys, this is still a use case the world hasn't woken up to. It's so much better than trying to wire money in the stupid traditional banking system.
00:15:40.268 - 00:15:53.420, Speaker A: Ryan, I had to send a $10,000 wire to this angel investment this week, and no one knows where it went. It's just lost. I have to go call my bank. They have to go call their bank. And they're like, all right, where'd this money go?
00:15:53.950 - 00:15:56.014, Speaker B: Do you know of any mistake that was made?
00:15:56.132 - 00:16:04.320, Speaker A: I have no clue. I have to go find that out. But it's just like, how do we just lose money? Where'd it go?
00:16:04.850 - 00:16:06.190, Speaker B: There's no tracking.
00:16:06.610 - 00:16:17.454, Speaker A: I can send a 10,000 USDC transfer on Ethereum and I can watch it penned in real time, and it's wherever it's going, the fact that it just disappears. And then he's like, oh, we lost it. This is ridiculous.
00:16:17.502 - 00:16:47.610, Speaker B: It's funny. It's like, to be honest, David, even ignoring all the hassle, which is a massive hassle, show up in a bank, present your id, do the wire thing. The cost, five days it takes to get something internationally. Ignore all of that. Okay, just like I am now more nervous to transfer a wire from one place to another than I am to send a crypto transaction. It used to be reversed to me, that's another minor flipping. I used to be terrified to send crypto.
00:16:47.610 - 00:16:51.950, Speaker B: Like double check. Let me send the test transaction. Let me check this ten times.
00:16:52.020 - 00:16:54.560, Speaker A: Now I'll send one dollars. Then I'll send $10.
00:16:55.430 - 00:17:20.662, Speaker B: Now I still obviously check everything and make sure user experience has gotten a little bit better. And the fact that I can see it instantly, if you're wiring money, who knows where it's going? That is way more risky in my mind. That's been interesting flip that's happened in the last two or three years for me personally. Rocket pool. Two hundred k e staked. That's a big milestone, too. Another crypto number we are looking at.
00:17:20.662 - 00:17:28.778, Speaker B: And then also Ens is still on its hair. What's happening with Ens? They just released their June stats. That is a bright spot in the NFT market.
00:17:28.944 - 00:17:56.850, Speaker A: Yeah. So Ens June numbers, 122,000 new ETH registrations, $3.3 million in protocol revenue, all going to the Dow. That's 2500 ETH in revenue, 25,000 new ETH accounts with at least one new ens name. So that's 25,000 Ethereum wallets with a new Ens name. And Ryan, that was just June. We're one week into July and you can see that tiny little bar chart down in the bottom right corner.
00:17:56.850 - 00:18:12.214, Speaker A: So far, seven days into July, we are basically where all of June was. So the last seven days, we still have three more weeks. So the July numbers finish. We're basically on par. The first week of July is basically on par with all of June.
00:18:12.262 - 00:18:14.346, Speaker B: David, anyone playing this game?
00:18:14.448 - 00:18:40.866, Speaker A: Oh, I know, yes. There have been a lot of my crypto friends that I've been trying to, I tried to get them into defi summer, I tried to get them into nfTs. They did get into nfts and then got burned. Sorry about that. But then of their own accord, of their own accord without me kicking them in the butt, they're all playing the EnS game. And so they've registered a ton of ens names. They're sitting on a lot of them.
00:18:40.866 - 00:18:45.854, Speaker A: Yeah, they're playing it. And so people have found a new market to play in NFT games.
00:18:45.902 - 00:19:09.530, Speaker B: Look, this has an analog, right? Domain names are valuable. Coms are valuable, nets are valuable. They weren't. And you could just see this, obviously they're going to be valuable in crypto and for various know, anyway, dows, nfTs. Every single piece of property will want to have its own Eth name. That is the bullcase for all of this. I don't play in the speculation, though, David.
00:19:09.530 - 00:19:17.338, Speaker B: We collect a few things here and there. We got bankless Eth. I got my initials, a few other things, but I'm not playing these games.
00:19:17.434 - 00:19:20.602, Speaker A: Yeah, you saw David, Eth got bought for 32 eth.
00:19:20.666 - 00:19:21.870, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Really?
00:19:22.020 - 00:19:24.222, Speaker A: Recently? Yeah. This last week. Yeah.
00:19:24.276 - 00:19:31.550, Speaker B: I wonder what Ryan eth goes for. Do you think it's worth more than 30? I think David's got to be worth more. There's more David's.
00:19:31.630 - 00:19:32.722, Speaker A: Yeah, there's better.
00:19:32.776 - 00:19:33.410, Speaker B: David.
00:19:34.390 - 00:19:36.100, Speaker A: Good take, Ryan. Good take.
00:19:37.030 - 00:19:57.370, Speaker B: All right, guys, we got so much more to cover the contagion that has spread. Maybe this is the last week that we'll have to talk about that. But another CFI bank going bust. This is the conclusion of Voyager, and we'll talk about that. Also, blockfi gets their bailout. Some good news there, and crypto banks are consolidating. We're going to talk about the big winners and what that means.
00:19:57.370 - 00:20:06.506, Speaker B: We will get back to all of these things, but first we want to tell you about these fantastic sponsors to help provide some tools to help you go bankless.
00:20:06.698 - 00:20:46.006, Speaker A: Rocket pool is your friendly, decentralized Ethereum staking protocol. You can stake your ETh with Rocket pool and get our eth in return, allowing you to stake your ETH and use it in DFI at the same time. You can get 4% on your Eth by staking it with Rocket pool, but you can get even more by running a node. Rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes. Running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node, and you only need 16 eth to get started. Why would you do this? You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled e, so your API is boosted. So if you're bullish east staking, you can increase your API and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network, which currently has over a thousand independent validators.
00:20:46.006 - 00:21:12.094, Speaker A: It's yield farming, but with Ethereum nodes you can get started@rocketpool.net and also join the Rocketpool community in their discord. You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there. Makerdao is the OG Defi protocol, the first defi protocol to ever exist, even before we called it defi Makerdao produces Dai, the industry's most battle tested and resilient stablecoin. Using Maker.

00:21:41.782 - 00:22:09.266, Speaker B: All right, guys, we are back talking about the first big item this week that you need to know about, which is Voyager. A crypto bank, a CFI lending service and borrowing service went bust. We've been talking about that. They had exposures to three arrows capital. Here's how this resolved. You know, though, David, I feel like all of these Centralized CFI lending services are kind of coming out of the woodwork a little bit like ones that I didn't really know much about. And I don't know about you, but I didn't know much about Voyager.
00:22:09.266 - 00:22:10.946, Speaker B: Did you know anything about Voyager alt.
00:22:10.978 - 00:22:12.498, Speaker A: Alt crypto banks?
00:22:12.674 - 00:22:28.410, Speaker B: Yeah, right. I know the block fives and the Nexos and Celsius and such. I was not covered like following Voyager. I was just taking a scan at their website. Look, award winning crypto app, 100 digital assets. Look how nice this looks. Looks like a nice fintech platform.
00:22:28.410 - 00:22:36.400, Speaker B: I get my debit card. Looks nice. Safe and secure. I can go take a look at the products here behind this.
00:22:37.490 - 00:22:39.870, Speaker A: Don't forget to click on the token tab, Brian.
00:22:40.210 - 00:22:51.650, Speaker B: Token tab. Let's talk about the products. Get started in under three minutes. Look at these annualized rewards here. All very nice. They do have a token. The Voyager.
00:22:51.650 - 00:22:55.694, Speaker B: Right, the Voyager token. Meet the Voyager token.
00:22:55.742 - 00:22:58.786, Speaker A: Boost your crypto yield with the Voyager token. All right.
00:22:58.888 - 00:23:00.570, Speaker B: Crypto banks like their loyalty.
00:23:00.670 - 00:23:01.398, Speaker A: Where do I buy?
00:23:01.484 - 00:23:08.370, Speaker B: Stake it, of course, because why not? You go to the about section and take a look at the team. Oh, look, these guys look competent.
00:23:08.450 - 00:23:10.726, Speaker A: Look at those suits. They all wear ties, Ryan. They all wear ties.
00:23:10.758 - 00:23:28.474, Speaker B: Biggest red flag in the competent, though. Okay. This gentleman who's the CEO is a brokerage and market structure veteran who founded Lightspeed Financial. Previously, he worked as the CEO at e trade professional Trading. My God, this is great. This looks like a fintech platform meets crypto.
00:23:28.522 - 00:23:30.080, Speaker A: It's got the LinkedIn button.
00:23:30.450 - 00:23:36.754, Speaker B: Yeah. They must keep my money secure. It must be safe to deposit and earn, like, 89% interest.
00:23:36.872 - 00:23:37.538, Speaker A: Wow.
00:23:37.704 - 00:23:38.690, Speaker B: Yeah. Look at this, man.
00:23:38.760 - 00:23:40.542, Speaker A: 8% on apecoin.
00:23:40.686 - 00:23:50.994, Speaker B: 8% on apecoin. Dear God. 9% on USDC. Look at these tiers. All looks very standard. All looks very fantastic. Nice and shrink wrapped.
00:23:50.994 - 00:23:54.278, Speaker B: And by the way, Voyager is a publicly traded company.
00:23:54.444 - 00:23:55.206, Speaker A: I forgot about that.
00:23:55.228 - 00:24:03.606, Speaker B: This is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, so you've got that air of legitimacy, too. But why don't you take us through what happened with Voyager?
00:24:03.718 - 00:24:45.746, Speaker A: Yeah. So, like, on the theme of the last few weeks, we have to go back a few weeks because these things happen over longer than seven days. On June 14, Voyager releases an update on their asset and risk management policies, which I'm going to pull out a few quotes to read from. As a public company, Voyager operates with a consistently high level of transparency, providing regular quarterly financial statements detailing the company's financial position and financial statements to closer surrounding risk management practices and counterparty exposure. Voyager differentiates itself through a straightforward, low risk approach to lending and asset management by working with a select group of reputable counterparties. Reputable counterparties, which. Low risk.
00:24:45.746 - 00:25:19.890, Speaker A: Which are all vetted through extensive due diligence by its risk committees. Voyager holds a strong position in the crypto industry. Not only were we among the first to go public and provide full balance transparency, our leadership also has deep financial expertise across the sector and has led companies through multiple market cycles, says Steve Elrich, Elrich chief executive officer and co founder of Voyager. The company is well capitalized and in a good position to weather this market cycle and protect customer assets. This sounds great, David, and this sounds so good.
00:25:19.960 - 00:25:21.140, Speaker B: What could go wrong?
00:25:21.510 - 00:25:49.334, Speaker A: It's Voyager's goal to continue to build secure products and services, as well as build trust and leadership in the cryptocurrency industry. Okay, reminder, that was June 14. That was about three weeks ago. June 22. Let's go forward. June 22, the news breaks. Voyager Digital stock plunges after disclosing over $660,000,000 of exposure in an uncollateralized loan to three Arrows capital, an unsecured loan.
00:25:49.334 - 00:26:00.654, Speaker A: And so this balance included 350,000,000 of dollars of USDC and 15,250 BTC loaned to three Arrows capital. So that news got released on June 22.
00:26:00.772 - 00:26:09.870, Speaker B: That's pretty unique, too. That uncollateralized loan piece of it. Right. Like Blockfly ran into trouble, but their loans were completely collateralized to 3 hours capital.
00:26:09.950 - 00:26:31.334, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so July 6, and here's the news of this week. Voyager goes bankrupt. And so they have filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy. And so, again, a few quotes I'm going to pull out. Crypto lender and broker Voyager Digital has filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy, estimating that it has more than 100,000 creditors. That's retail.
00:26:31.334 - 00:27:21.626, Speaker A: The single largest creditor is Alameda Research, with unsecured loans of $75 million. Voyager Digital is a publicly traded company listed on Toronto Stock Exchange. The company has also issued VGX token, allowing users to earn boosted rewards, high referral bonuses, and better pricing on trades. On June 22, the company announced that its exposure to three O's capital listed the assets that I just mentioned a second ago. And on July 2, Singapore based three O's capital filed for chapter 15 bankruptcy, which allows the company to shield us assets and block creditors like Voyager Digital from filing lawsuits. And so on a July 6 press release, Voyager announces that it's commenced a voluntary chapter eleven bankruptcy to provide maximum values for stakeholders under this plan, which is subject to change and requires court approval. Customers with their crypto account.
00:27:21.626 - 00:27:59.240, Speaker A: So if you're a retail investor. Investor. If you're a retail depositor into Voyager, customers with their crypto in their account will receive an exchange of a combination of the crypto in their account as much as they can get back from Voyager. Proceeds from the three arrows capital recovery, which could be zero common shares in a newly reorganized company, and more Voyager tokens. So, common shares in a newly reorganized company in order to pay back the debts that Voyager owes their retail customer. They're basically like giving them equity for a new company. It's like a future ious, like, sorry, we don't have any money to give you, but we can print equity and give that to you instead.
00:27:59.240 - 00:28:40.462, Speaker A: And so the current state of Voyager is that they have about $110,000,000 of cash and crypto assets on hand. Remember, they gave Fiar's capital $660,000,000, and they said that they will provide liquidity to support day to day operations, such, since they're going to pay their employees. And then moving on to the last quote that I'll read, Voyager has approximately 1.3 billion of crypto assets on its platform, plus claims against three arrows capital for more than 650,000,000. They have assets. They have, like, I would say, like, 50% to two thirds solvency, but they're missing, like, a big chunk. Missing a big chunk.
00:28:40.526 - 00:28:58.166, Speaker B: So the big picture story here is crypto market goes down and then press release to reassure everyone in Voyager. Look, we have our risk processes covered. We're solvent. Everything's fine. We're a responsible company. Hey, look, we're publicly traded depositors. Don't worry about it.
00:28:58.166 - 00:29:43.734, Speaker B: And, of course, if you're a crypto bank in this situation, you kind of have to say these things to project confidence so that you don't get a bank run. All right. Behind the scenes, they had a number of uncollateralized loans to, like, alameda Group, also 3 hours capital. These loans were not low risk at all, particularly the one to three errors capital that went completely bust. And now if you are a depositor into Voyager. So, retail investor, you were looking at the website earlier, David, with those attractive returns, and look at the sleek interface, and you got the mobile experience, and it's an easy one button click to deposit. Well, what do you get as a result? You ain't getting your money back.
00:29:43.734 - 00:30:36.498, Speaker B: What you're getting instead is whatever crypto assets are maybe remaining some percentage of 100% that you deposited the proceeds from, some sort of 3 hours capital recovery. 3 hours capital owes them 650,000,000. Will they get any of that back? Who knows? Maybe Suzu's yacht is for sale. Maybe you get a portion from that, I don't know, common shares in a newly reorganized company, whatever that's worth. And Voyager tokens, that's what you get. I don't know if you remember back in, was it, like, 2016? I'm going back in my past year, there was Bitfinex, which had a major hack, Bitfinex, and they lost funds as a result. So they lost depositors money, and they did something similar where they kind of spun out a token and gave that to some of their depositors.
00:30:36.498 - 00:31:06.702, Speaker B: It's funny, last cycle, some crypto banks went bust because they actually got hacked, lost funds. This goes all the way back to mount Gox this cycle. What's happening is some of these crypto banks, these centralized lending providers, were completely irresponsible with their clients funds and lost it that way. But it's kind of funny how it's playing out in a similar way that, hey, you get tokens. You knew equity. It actually worked out for some of the Bitfinex depositors in that over time, their tokens were actually worth more.
00:31:06.836 - 00:31:12.226, Speaker A: Bitfinex did pay their customers back. They made their customers whole. It took a number of years, but they got there.
00:31:12.328 - 00:31:25.702, Speaker B: Yes. This could have a happy ish ending, I suppose. Really depends on what Voyager and the management team does from here, and if they're able to unbury themselves and add more value to this equity. Not a good place to be if you're a depositor, though.
00:31:25.836 - 00:32:07.086, Speaker A: Absolutely not. And, of course, because this is contagion, we're bleeding right over into the story of three arrows capital. Three arrows capital has formally filed bankruptcy. So this story is slowly coming to a close, although it will definitely take a while to play out because there's going to be a fight in court. Three Zero's capital has petitioned the British Virgin Isles court for bankruptcy. And the reason why you would want to do this is, well, because you have to, first off. But also, they say that without the relief requested herein, this is in their filing, creditors may pursue a value destructive race to the courthouse to exercise rights in a manner that would enhance their own position visa vis other similarly situated creditors.
00:32:07.086 - 00:32:54.718, Speaker A: Basically, three O's capital owes a bunch of money to a bunch of people. And all of these people, all these entities, are racing to seize three O's capital assets the fastest so that they could get their money back before other people get the. There's like $10 billion owed and there's like $1 billion of assets left, and everyone's trying to get that $1 billion of assets left. And so because of this race, it would create capital destruction. It would force liquidation at unfavorable rates, et cetera, et cetera. And so they are filing for bankruptcy to preserve as much capital as possible, knowing full well it's ultimately going to get liquidated, but they will just want to liquidate it for the most amount of value possible so that they can make their creditors as whole as possible. But the point I want to make is that this is a lesson that when markets break, things revert back to lawyers and courts.
00:32:54.718 - 00:33:24.826, Speaker A: This is what we saw in 2008. There is still to this day, Ryan, fallout from 2008, going through court proceedings because of the mess, the absolute spaghetti mess of the credit default swap era of the 2008. And so this is exactly what's happening to 3 hours capital. And when markets break, ultimately, we have to have lawyers say, like, okay, these people are owed this and these people are owed that. And so this is an example of when things we don't want to have happen.
00:33:24.928 - 00:33:58.486, Speaker B: Do you know, I want to put one asterisk on that, which is like, that's true in traditional finance and, like markets. That does not have to be true in DeFi, right? Number one, DeFi held up better. Number two, the code is the liquidator and the settlement engine. The code is the court in the ethereum world. In the DeFi world, the code is actually the law. And so you wouldn't see that if you're liquidating a maker eth collateral loan. First of all, that should happen in an orderly way.
00:33:58.486 - 00:34:30.850, Speaker B: Second of all, it'll all be settled on chain, completely transparently. We don't have to go to the court system. That's where things get very expensive and inefficient. Going back to the court system and having lawyers in nation states try to arbitrate all of this stuff. And that is exactly what we're trying to avoid with Defi, which again, we'll say has held up very well through this liquidation cycle. I think Layton Cusack has a take on that later that we'll get to. But one other question I have in my mind, David, is look, these are all 3 hours capital's NFT holdings.
00:34:30.850 - 00:34:41.350, Speaker B: Look, man, look at all the art blocks that they purchased. Autoglyphs, sport ape yachts, crummy swiggnals. What's going to happen to these things? And you know what? This reminds me.
00:34:41.420 - 00:34:42.482, Speaker A: Crypto punks.
00:34:42.626 - 00:34:43.398, Speaker B: Do you know what?
00:34:43.484 - 00:34:57.414, Speaker A: Hang on for the listeners out there. We're looking at a pie chart. And so all of three arrows Capital's NFT holdings, through their starry night fund, I'm pretty sure we got 40.7% of their NFT holdings are crypto punks. Ow, my bags.
00:34:57.542 - 00:34:59.222, Speaker B: It's going to be liquidated, brother.
00:34:59.366 - 00:35:15.898, Speaker A: Art blocks curated is 33.5% of their holdings. They got some pegs, which I don't know what that is. Mutant ape yacht clubs. They got a few autoglyphs, some other things they're all going to liquidate. So many crypto punks.
00:35:15.994 - 00:35:24.338, Speaker B: All this stuff looks good on the way up. It doesn't look so good on the way down. I'm reminded by this. To me, this was like peak NFT season. Do you remember this tweet from Suzu? Right?
00:35:24.424 - 00:35:26.434, Speaker A: They spent so much money on that.
00:35:26.472 - 00:35:29.238, Speaker B: Are we looking at an art blocks? NFT? Is that what this?
00:35:29.324 - 00:35:30.946, Speaker A: That is a ringer. That is an art block.
00:35:30.978 - 00:35:52.446, Speaker B: It's a ringer, which was peak NFT season. This was a tweet from Suzu from August 27, almost a year ago. The thesis, we like the goose. It's because this random generated NFT art looks like a goose. And I like it, too. But now that pie chart, David, is being liquidated. I don't know that I like it.
00:35:52.446 - 00:36:02.394, Speaker B: For like $10 million or whatever was paid for this thing at the time. So that's what's happening with 3 hours capital, a few other contagion.
00:36:02.442 - 00:36:16.274, Speaker A: Hang on, hang on, hang on. I'm going to go find out how much that goose was sold for. You know where I found out where. Metaversal. Thanks, William. Hey, Ryan, you want to know how much that goose was sold for?
00:36:16.312 - 00:36:18.086, Speaker B: I'm super curious. Can I guess, though?
00:36:18.188 - 00:36:18.840, Speaker A: Sure.
00:36:19.850 - 00:36:24.134, Speaker B: I said 10 million just now. I'm going to guess, actually, 15 million. Boost that up.
00:36:24.332 - 00:36:29.740, Speaker A: 5.66,000,800 ether. That's a deal.
00:36:30.510 - 00:36:31.900, Speaker B: Is it worth now?
00:36:32.270 - 00:36:41.690, Speaker A: I don't think very much. I'm going to go with, like, under half a million dollars. Bought for 5.5 million. 5.6 under half a million dollars.
00:36:41.760 - 00:36:51.582, Speaker B: Do you know one thing? If it's Susie's personal funds, but now that you know, kind of the history of 3 hours capital, and this is like some retail money went into this, right?
00:36:51.636 - 00:37:06.054, Speaker A: Yes. If you deposited your money into voyagers, you helped 3 hours capital buy the goose. Did you know you were doing that? They borrowed your money and bought nFts with it, and now those Nfts are down.
00:37:06.092 - 00:37:32.206, Speaker B: Bad things got silly, man. Things got very silly. But some consolidation is happening in the crypto banking system, at least the strong crypto banks, the ones that have survived the binances of the world. We talked to CZ last Friday. He said he's looking at buying things. Sandbank. Benfried from FTX will talk about what he's doing with the blockfi deal, but also Nexo, which is a centralized lending and borrowing platform.
00:37:32.206 - 00:37:45.380, Speaker B: A CFI crypto bank has come out of this stronger and is now in the process of potentially acquiring crypto lender vault. This is another one I haven't heard of. I haven't heard of vault, but it looks like.
00:37:47.270 - 00:37:48.674, Speaker A: All crypto banks are coming.
00:37:48.712 - 00:38:20.700, Speaker B: Out of the woodworks, so we're seeing this consolidation. I think Nexo is going to come out of this stronger. I think FTX is going to come out of this stronger. Binance is going to come out of this stronger. Anyone who wasn't irresponsible during the bear market, if you weren't irresponsible, or during the bull market, if you weren't irresponsible during the bull market, if you have some cash on reserve, if you didn't go margin long, if you didn't bet everything, 100% of your net worth, you're going to come out of this stronger as well. And that is the lesson that we learn every single bull market, don't we?
00:38:21.230 - 00:38:25.680, Speaker A: If I had my money in Nexo, I'd be like, oh, thanks, guys. That'd be.
00:38:26.290 - 00:38:27.840, Speaker B: It's a crapshoot, though.
00:38:28.530 - 00:38:43.618, Speaker A: You don't know until. You don't know until after it's too late. And so it's like, all right, you want to get your yield, you're going to use a CFI lender. You got Celsius, you got Nexo. I don't know. Name some other ones for me. You got all these ones.
00:38:43.618 - 00:38:48.938, Speaker A: It's just like, place your bets. No, Voyager was a crypto exchange. They weren't even a lender. Oh, they were a lender.
00:38:48.974 - 00:38:49.846, Speaker B: They were. They did that.
00:38:49.948 - 00:38:55.078, Speaker A: Yeah, you're right. But it's know, place your bets. Which one of these is responsible and which one's not.
00:38:55.164 - 00:39:12.202, Speaker B: The marketing all sounds the same. The website, the executives that they hire all wear suits and ties and look very official. So you have no idea until something like this happens. That's pretty rough. It's a pretty rough existence. What happened to the blockfly story, though?
00:39:12.256 - 00:39:56.502, Speaker A: We keep on reporting on this contagion every single week, because again, as soon as things goes to court, it takes a long time to play out. But at least one part of this story we are going to formally wrap up, probably, which is the blockfly side of these things. FTX and its blockfi have reached a deal for up to, but not at $240,000,000. So they are acquiring blockfly. All of blockfly. Right, like all of it, for up to $240,000,000, which also gives blockfly a $400 million revolving credit facility, basically a loan to allow for liquidity for their users. And so this $240,000,000 valuation depends on startups, on Blockfly's performance triggers.
00:39:56.502 - 00:40:36.230, Speaker A: So they need to hit certain milestones, and if they don't hit certain milestones, then that valuation goes down. What? These details are undisclosed, but there's rumors that the lowest end of this thing is a $25 million valuation. And so here's a statement or a quote from this blockworks article. Although Prince, Zach Prince, the CEO at block five, did not disclose the lower end of the acquisition, CNBC reported that the deal was pegged at $25 million. Prince denied CNBC's reporting, which he dubbed unfounded, which, I mean, is kind of par for the course for these CFI banks that say trying to preserve.
00:40:36.970 - 00:40:41.690, Speaker B: And maybe it is, maybe it's not. We don't know. But, you know, FTX is getting a great deal on this.
00:40:41.760 - 00:40:42.380, Speaker A: Right?
00:40:42.750 - 00:41:12.260, Speaker B: They are in the driver's seat. They set the terms of the negotiation like Darth Vader style, coming in here and being like, hey, this is what we're going to do for you. Do you know what's great about this, though, David, is in this blockfi situation, because there's gradients of how irresponsible or even responsible that CFI lenders actually were. Right. So you have Nexo, which is still left standing. They probably did an okay job, as evidenced. We don't know all the details, but as evidenced by the fact that they're still standing in their building.
00:41:12.260 - 00:41:29.266, Speaker B: FTX did a fine job managing risk. Binance did a fine job managing risk. It seems Celsius on the other side did a terrible job managing risk. The only one worse that we've seen so far is probably Voyager, which was just handing out unsecured loans.
00:41:29.378 - 00:41:31.254, Speaker A: Well, okay, three zero's capital was the.
00:41:31.372 - 00:41:32.230, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:41:32.300 - 00:41:32.678, Speaker A: Of.
00:41:32.764 - 00:41:39.546, Speaker B: Yeah. On the other side of things. But they were like not accepting deposits directly from retail even though they were behind.
00:41:39.648 - 00:41:58.606, Speaker A: No, they were accepting deposits from retail aggregators. Retail aggregators gave money to 3 hours capital. Again, we said this in the last roll up, 3 hours capital was the contagion that 7% that you saw on Voyager, 3 hours capital. Whatever percent you saw on Celsius, 3 hours capital.
00:41:58.638 - 00:42:09.620, Speaker B: Well, except Celsius was doing some other things. Remember, Celsius was like they were in staking assets. They were like betting in these weird speculative, defi things. They were off the.
00:42:10.330 - 00:42:12.818, Speaker A: I guess it was both three years capital and Celsius.
00:42:12.914 - 00:42:32.074, Speaker B: But Blockfi, okay, they were kind of in the middle. They did some things that were irresponsible, I'm sure that they regret doing. But in this case, depositors funds are going to be safe. FTX has bailed them out. It's looking good. If you have your funds in Blockfi, you should be able to get all of your money back. They never had to pause anything.
00:42:32.074 - 00:42:52.910, Speaker B: So there's kind of gradients, right. We see like really bad case scenarios. We see decent risk management coming out of this, stronger on the other side, and we see situations like blockfi, which are kind of in the middle. They definitely failed, but not completely. This is the last. Maybe hope this won't be the last time we hear about Celsius. But what happened this week with Celsius, David?
00:42:52.990 - 00:43:20.362, Speaker A: Yeah, so Celsius famously has this maker Dao vault. They have a bunch of WBTC inside and they pulled out a bunch of Dai. As of very recently, they have fully paid off their entire debt, so they no longer have debt in their vault. Well, it sounds like a good thing. Basically, my interpretation is they are waving the white flag and say, we have had enough, we are out. We are liquidating at whatever.
00:43:20.416 - 00:43:22.246, Speaker B: So they're selling all this we're selling.
00:43:22.278 - 00:44:08.134, Speaker A: And so Hal press says it does indeed look like Celsius is prepared to sell about $500 million worth of BTC that was tweeted out just a couple of hours ago from the time of recording. And so it's basically like a change of pace where Celsius previously was like agro leverage yield farming. Now they are being hyper conservative at suboptimal prices. And so because of this change in demeanor, my opinion is that they and other people are saying, like, well, they're kind of going to close up shop and this is what they're doing. That's just speculation. But the idea is the change of we were going to try and have this business of leverage yield farming, but now we're just going to pay back all debt possible and just liquidate whatever assets we have is like, to me, they're just waving the white flag.
00:44:08.182 - 00:44:38.366, Speaker B: And so this is a tweet from light crypto that's cel squeezing on vault repayment is comical when considering that this is likely a move in preparation for bankruptcy filing. I think sell is the Celsius token, right? Correct. And so they're talking about price action here. It all begs the question of what in the world is the sell loyalty coin actually worth? Right? What is the voyager loyalty coin that depositors are getting? What is that worth in this world? The truth is, nobody actually knows.
00:44:38.478 - 00:45:07.870, Speaker A: It's not equity. Whatever that whatever it is, it's not equity. Anyways, that is all of the contagion once again, there'll probably be more things to talk about next week, but at least some of these stories are coming to a close. Coming up next in the show, we're going to have to burn through these because we took a really long time on the market section and contagion section, like I would imagine we would. But NFTs on Facebook, crazy that that's not the biggest news of the week. Reddit also deploying NFTs on polygon. Also crazy news.
00:45:07.870 - 00:45:36.626, Speaker A: There's crypto phone wars to talk about. There's people getting into the hardware game and also merge updates, like actually big news but contagious. If it bleeds, it leads, Ryan. If it bleeds, it leads. So we're going to get to all of that news right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Arbitrum is an ethereum L2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs. Some of the coolest new NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home, while DFI protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage.
00:45:36.626 - 00:46:22.838, Speaker A: You can now bridge straight into Arbitrum from more than ten different exchanges, including finance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com. Once on Arbitrum, you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees, allowing you to explore new frontiers of the crypto universe. New to Arbitrum for a limited time, you can get arbitram nfTs, designed by the famous artists Ratwell and Sugoy for joining the Arbitrum odyssey. The Odyssey is an eight week long event where you complete on chain activities and receive a free NFT as a reward. Find out more by visiting the discord at Discord GG Arbitrum. You can also bridge your assets to Arbitrum at Bridge Arbitrum IO and access all of Arbitrum's apps at Portal Arbitrum one in order to experience Defi and NFTs the way it was always meant to be, fast, cheap, secure and fiction free. There is a brand new staking feature in the Ledger live app today.
00:46:22.838 - 00:47:20.214, Speaker A: We all like staking the assets that we're bullish on, and now you can stake seven different coins inside the Ledger live app Cosmos, Polkadot tron algorithm, Tezos Solana, and of course, Ethereum. With Ledger Live, you can take money from your bank account, buy your most bullish crypto asset, and stake that asset to its network all inside the Ledger Live app through a partnership with Figment, Ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with, and ledger is running its own validating node, offering a convenient way to participate in network validation, and it even comes with slashing insurance. Ledger Live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world. So go download Ledger live. If you have a ledger already, you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets. The merge we have successfully merged Sepoya, the second of three testnets has finally completed that went through a couple of days ago, and it was successful. There were a few hiccups here and there, but they were not related to the merge.
00:47:20.214 - 00:47:44.394, Speaker A: And so the general consensus is that this is good news. And whatever the hiccups were, they were unrelated to actual merge progress. So here's Terrence Eth, who I believe works at prismatic. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's true. And he says merge transition itself was a success. 25% to 30% of the validators went online shortly after the merge. The offline validators were due to wrong configurations.
00:47:44.394 - 00:48:08.998, Speaker A: Since then, the offline parties have updated their configurations and validators are up so there are no client bugs and the hiccups will not delay the merge. And so, cool. Good news. We are at 95% participation rate. So that's like a 95% success rate, which is pretty damn good. The numbers that you don't want to see are 66% or below. I'd say, like anything above, like 92 and a half percent ish feels pretty damn good.
00:48:08.998 - 00:48:11.430, Speaker A: 95% is pretty good. 95% pretty good.
00:48:11.500 - 00:48:17.578, Speaker B: David, what's the next one? Remind us. So these are dress rehearsals, right? We've got two down. Is it one left?
00:48:17.664 - 00:48:41.198, Speaker A: One left? The Gorely testnet, the last test net. And this is the one where like, oh, this one makes it real. And so the state of the aftermath of the Gorely testnet, whether it's positive or negative, will become extremely indicative of the actual merge. If it's a bad result, then we might kick the testnet, the merge, back one or two months. If it's a good result, like. Yo. Like, late August, early September.
00:48:41.374 - 00:48:42.978, Speaker B: We say it. Stop.
00:48:43.144 - 00:48:48.626, Speaker A: Late August, early September. I didn't say dates. I said late August, early September.
00:48:48.738 - 00:48:50.520, Speaker B: Date range, my friend.
00:48:51.210 - 00:49:07.674, Speaker A: Anyways, when the Gorely merge happens, TBD on the actual date has to be a date decided. The date will probably be decided. When's the next all core devs call? A week from today. We are live close. We are live streaming this with the East Stakers group. Oh, we are. Do you not know that? Oh, yeah.
00:49:07.674 - 00:49:14.474, Speaker A: When is that? Well, Ryan, in about seven days, the all core devs call will determine when the Gorely testnet is.
00:49:14.512 - 00:49:16.298, Speaker B: I should listen these roll ups more closely.
00:49:16.394 - 00:49:31.138, Speaker A: Yeah, if it's not decided, then it'll be decided at a later all core devs call. But when the Gorely testnet does merge, we will be live streaming it with the East Acres group and a bunch of other people. Maybe we'll invite hell press on because. Good timing then. And that's when we get to see.
00:49:31.224 - 00:49:32.674, Speaker B: Let's definitely have hell press back.
00:49:32.712 - 00:49:33.362, Speaker A: Yeah, let's see that.
00:49:33.416 - 00:49:34.754, Speaker B: I want to see if he's buying in yet.
00:49:34.792 - 00:49:35.138, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:35.224 - 00:49:37.342, Speaker B: What's happening? If he's still trying to bet on the merch.
00:49:37.406 - 00:49:41.478, Speaker A: I got dinner with hell press not too long ago. I got a bunch of alpha I haven't told you yet.
00:49:41.644 - 00:49:52.218, Speaker B: All right, I want to hear that too, after the show. Yeah, we'll leave it to a debrief. David, on the premium podcast heat. Guys, let's talk about some news that went.
00:49:52.304 - 00:49:55.622, Speaker A: We're totally going to do that. Help press Alpha leak on the premium.
00:49:55.686 - 00:50:15.360, Speaker B: Dude. No, we'll open that up to everyone. Facebook is testing ethereum and Polygon NFTs on its profile. Facebook. This is the company now called Meta, but Facebook is the platform with 2 billion users worldwide. They're getting into nfts and no one noticed this week what's happening here.
00:50:16.230 - 00:50:42.006, Speaker A: We already reported on the Instagram integration of nfts and it's more or less the same thing, but for Facebook. So users will have a digital collectible tab on their Facebook profiles where they can showcase their nfts. And users will be able to connect their wallets to their Facebook profiles and they'll be able to turn their nfts into Facebook posts which can be reacted to, liked on, commented on. It's basically just like kind of basic NFT integration into. So, like, that's awesome.
00:50:42.108 - 00:50:46.186, Speaker B: Facebook's now you can buy an NFT for your mom, right, for Mother's Day.
00:50:46.288 - 00:50:55.086, Speaker A: And make a post about it. Yeah, but the thing is, who's left on Facebook? It's like our crazy aunts and parents and stuff.
00:50:55.268 - 00:50:57.120, Speaker B: When's the last time I logged into?
00:50:57.890 - 00:50:58.622, Speaker A: Forever ago.
00:50:58.676 - 00:51:01.422, Speaker B: Dude, you're heavy Instagram, though.
00:51:01.476 - 00:51:08.020, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm pretty heavy on Instagram. Don't follow me. Please don't follow me. I deny every single request. Not you.
00:51:13.510 - 00:51:14.782, Speaker B: Now you've got me curious.
00:51:14.846 - 00:51:20.214, Speaker A: Yeah, no, you can follow me. I get a bunch of Instagram follow requests and I delete every single one, so don't try it.
00:51:20.332 - 00:51:22.520, Speaker B: Nfts on Facebook, though. That's a big.
00:51:23.530 - 00:51:32.530, Speaker A: I mean, is it, though? Because now all of our aunts are going to reach out to us and be like, son, can you help me set up my crypto wallet so I can share these nfts?
00:51:32.610 - 00:51:37.942, Speaker B: Dude, why are you making fun of that? I'm so happy to help all my aunts and uncles and everyone who wants to.
00:51:37.996 - 00:51:38.326, Speaker A: Good luck.
00:51:38.348 - 00:51:38.934, Speaker B: I will help you.
00:51:38.972 - 00:51:42.240, Speaker A: Good luck. Good luck with that. Know, let me know how that goes.
00:51:42.850 - 00:51:44.442, Speaker B: Don't follow David on Instagram.
00:51:44.586 - 00:51:45.882, Speaker A: Don't follow me on Instagram.
00:51:46.026 - 00:51:48.734, Speaker B: Crypto phone wars. Did you see that this week?
00:51:48.772 - 00:51:49.118, Speaker A: I did see.
00:51:49.124 - 00:51:55.562, Speaker B: Oh, by the way, we forgot to look at this. These are what the NFTs for those looking on Facebook, this is what they're going to look like in Facebook.
00:51:55.626 - 00:52:00.942, Speaker A: See, they're just normal pictures, but they just have, like, the digital collectible hexagon checkmark.
00:52:01.086 - 00:52:01.442, Speaker B: Yes.
00:52:01.496 - 00:52:02.114, Speaker A: The only thing.
00:52:02.152 - 00:52:04.526, Speaker B: Hey, these aren't just jpegs, okay? This is property rights.
00:52:04.558 - 00:52:07.138, Speaker A: These are verified. Verified jpegs.
00:52:07.234 - 00:52:39.710, Speaker B: You know what? It's cooking up, heating up, though, is the crypto phone wars, okay? Salana just released a flagship Android phone. I think they bought this company. It's called Sega the thesis here from Anatoly, the founder of Salana. Almost 7 billion people use smartphones around the world, and more than 100 million people hold digital crypto assets. Both of these will continue to grow. So Salana should own its own in house phone company in order to deploy this. So far, David, sales not looking too good.
00:52:39.710 - 00:53:13.226, Speaker B: You'd actually see this on chain sales. Presales have been about 2.5 thousand k preorders, which kind of begs the question of, like, does a blockchain really need to have its own phone? I know Anatolia has a history of, like, Qualcomm. He's very close to this, so maybe he feels differently. But I got to tell you, this would feel really weird if the Ethereum foundation was like, and now we have a phone, the Ethereum phone. We bought some know, startup company. It feels very feel.
00:53:13.226 - 00:53:29.358, Speaker B: I'm not going to say it. I'm going to say it. It feels a little EOS David, to me. Remember that they were off buying, like, voice. Yeah. And social networks and all these things, because they didn't know what else to do with their capital and they had so much of it. Maybe there's a justification for this.
00:53:29.358 - 00:53:37.230, Speaker B: Maybe I'm wrong. I got to be honest, though. I don't really get it. It seems like a massive distraction to a blockchain network.
00:53:37.390 - 00:53:47.894, Speaker A: The answer here is, what is the unique properties of the hardware of the Solana phone versus a normal phone? Because that's the only reason why you would get into the hardware game.
00:53:48.012 - 00:53:49.142, Speaker B: A hardware game? Yeah.
00:53:49.196 - 00:54:12.842, Speaker A: Solana, Ethereum, blockchains. These things are software. So you want software in your phone. What is the different. Like, we can have a secure enclave to have verifiably, basically, a built in hardware wallet in your phone, which is separated and compartmentalized from the rest of the phone. That's the only hardware thing I can really think of that would be different. That would enable a blockchain phone.
00:54:12.842 - 00:54:15.078, Speaker A: Other than that, it's only software.
00:54:15.254 - 00:54:18.894, Speaker B: Blockchain phones have been tried. They've never done well. They've never done well.
00:54:18.932 - 00:54:19.486, Speaker A: They've never done well.
00:54:19.508 - 00:54:33.342, Speaker B: Now, this is a different strategy. It's interesting. It's the same week. That's why we call it the wars, because there's sides to this. So Polygon is taking a different approach to the mobile phone wars. Here's what he says. Mass adoption of web3 will happen on mobile.
00:54:33.342 - 00:55:03.600, Speaker B: Polygon is prepared for it. Our strategy is not to make our own devices interesting contrast. Instead, we will integrate with existing manufacturers. Today we are proud to announce our first major integration. This is the HTC desire, which is going to be a metaverse phone with Ethereum and Polygon support. So the difference in strategy here is they are not getting into the hardware game, they're not acquiring anything, they're partnering with existing phone manufacturers and phone builders. And to me this makes a bit more sense.
00:55:03.600 - 00:55:08.240, Speaker B: But I guess we'll have to see these strategies play out and it could be proven wrong.
00:55:08.850 - 00:55:12.382, Speaker A: Ryan, one does not just make a phone, it's just not.
00:55:12.436 - 00:55:16.338, Speaker B: What you do is the Boromir meme. One does not just make a phone.
00:55:16.424 - 00:55:32.120, Speaker A: Yeah, that's exactly right. That's hard. That's an extremely saturated market. You're going up against HTC, you're going up against Apple. You don't have a competitive advantage just because you also have a blockchain ecosystem. That blockchain ecosystem does nothing for you. So it makes sense.
00:55:32.120 - 00:56:06.466, Speaker A: Polygon should do what Polygon does best, which is build software, and they should partner with somebody that does hardware really, really good, like HTC. So a few more details. HTC preloaded its 4.6 inch phone with applications from its metaverse arm, Viviverse, offering users what is called a rich metaverse experience without a VR headset. With Viviverse apps and Vivi wallets built into the phone, users can create virtual avatars, manage crypto assets including non fungible tokens and cryptocurrencies on Ethereum and Polygon, the company said in a press release. That seems to make much more common sense to me.
00:56:06.568 - 00:56:10.226, Speaker B: Hey, bankless nation, are David and I missing something? Tell us.
00:56:10.248 - 00:56:12.542, Speaker A: I mean, we're a good idea. I am not a hardware expert.
00:56:12.606 - 00:56:13.042, Speaker B: Tell us.
00:56:13.096 - 00:56:16.002, Speaker A: Actually, I have built a computer before. I know something.
00:56:16.136 - 00:56:21.910, Speaker B: Look, YouTube commenters will tell us if we're wrong. David, even if we're right, they'll still say we're wrong.
00:56:21.980 - 00:56:24.038, Speaker A: The alpha is always in the YouTube comments, isn't it?
00:56:24.124 - 00:56:29.974, Speaker B: Talk about this. This is a quick thing, but I think worth talking about immutable with a fiat off ramp. What's this? Right?
00:56:30.012 - 00:56:59.746, Speaker A: Okay, so immutable tweets out, major update. Eth off ramp is now available to any developer building on an immutable x power platform. Developers can enable their users to sell L2 ether and have their proceeds deposited directly into their bank account. Okay, so you know how we talked about Juno going from your checking account straight to a L2? This is the opposite. So if you have ether on immutable, you can go from immutable to your bank account. Why would you want this? Well, imagine you're somebody who does not care about crypto, but you do have this crypto game that you really want to play.
00:56:59.848 - 00:57:03.122, Speaker B: I can't imagine that I can't get in that headspace, sir, but go on.
00:57:03.176 - 00:57:44.020, Speaker A: And you keep on playing this crypto game and you've acquire a bunch of assets and you're like, oh, these assets that I've acquired are like, I can get like $200 into my bank account. Now you can, with the sample of your fingers, go from the gaming assets that you just acquired, sell them on of some marketplace which immutable already has built. That's already done, turn that into L2 ether and then send that money straight into your bank account. So that is a user acquisition strategy, it's an integration strategy, it's an onboarding strategy, and it's also a Trojan horse, Ryan, for a bankless life, because first you come in, you play a bunch of games, make a bunch of assets, sell a bunch of eTH, put your money back in the bank account, and then you're like, well, wait a second, but what about all that defi stuff? And then all of a sudden you're a bankless person.
00:57:44.790 - 00:58:20.102, Speaker B: This crypto thing becomes really real when people start earning money in it, right? So you're earning these crazy expensive gaming items, and then you can convert that to go pay your rent, pay your mortgage, buy something. That's when all of this becomes real. If Facebook wasn't enough, Reddit 400,000, over 400,000 Monthly Active Users, is launching an NFT Marketplace on Polygon. They're using Polygon for that. Pretty big deal to me. They're starting very small, David, though they're starting with one NFT Community, a small set of avatars. But I don't know if you've ever seen this in Reddit.
00:58:20.102 - 00:58:56.166, Speaker B: There's the ability to create your own avatar. And so they are going to, right now, this is not fully NFT enabled, but it's going to be such that you can select a collectible that is an NFT and set that as your avatars. They're going to be selling these nfts as well. And they're going to be partnering with artists, a 50 50 revenue split on transaction sales. So anytime a piece of art is sold on OpenC, then the artist gets 50% of the Transaction sales on that. So kind of a unique new model that Reddit is now experimenting and I'm curious to see where this goes.
00:58:56.348 - 00:59:33.506, Speaker A: That is kind of the NFT adoption that we were really looking for. Rather than NFT artists going straight to the blockchain or straight to some front end, they're just going to more obfuscated platforms, abstracted platforms like Reddit. And just like ultimately things settle down back to the blockchain. But so much of the blockchain is hidden the way it should be anyways in the first, like, if you think the future of NFTs are people like going to Opensea and buying NFTs, that's not the future of NFTs. It's like aggregators like Reddit who use Polygon and NFT minting in the back end and then just display the thing on the front end.
00:59:33.608 - 00:59:39.362, Speaker B: Yeah, you can buy these things with a credit card. It's like $25 in a credit Card. Done. Exactly. Don't even know you're on a blockchain.
00:59:39.426 - 00:59:43.318, Speaker A: 100%. So that is just user acquisition right then and there.
00:59:43.484 - 00:59:50.218, Speaker B: Talk to me about more NFT stuff in the Moonbirds world. Is Moonbirds mooning again? Is that a thing?
00:59:50.304 - 01:00:22.574, Speaker A: Yeah, apparently the Moonbird floor went up and so somebody asked why and somebody responded with a picture of a trademark, a trademark filing system. So there's a lot of text here. So I read what they are filing a trademark for. It's called Moonbird Ravens. It's basically an online NFT marketplace, the issuance of possible of currency. So like maybe like a Moonbird ERC 20 airdrop. There's also online art gallery services that are part of this spec for their trademark.
01:00:22.574 - 01:00:42.434, Speaker A: They want to create a virtual environment in the name of an online community for registered users to collaborate, share and comment on digital media and also with social networking services. So moonbirds filed a patent called Moonbird Ravens that does all of these things. So basically they're making a metaverse. So incoming moonbirds token and Moonbird metaverse.
01:00:42.482 - 01:00:54.126, Speaker B: Cool. There you go. Kevin Rose has been busy. We'll have to bring him back and see what he's up to. Also, do you remember that axie story, the bridge hack? What happened there? Some details broke about what actually happened. It's kind of a crazy story. Yeah.
01:00:54.148 - 01:01:26.054, Speaker A: So no one really knew how the bridge got exploited. We just knew that it did get exploited. Apparently, we found out. And so one of the axe people that was in charge of running the bridge nodes applied for a job that involved him downloading a PDF, and so that PDF had corrupted code in it, and that corrode. And so this guy was specifically targeted by the Lazarus group, by the way, the Lazarus group is that north korean hacking group. So this axie engineer was targeted by.
01:01:26.092 - 01:01:28.694, Speaker B: North Korea from applying to an external job.
01:01:28.732 - 01:01:53.438, Speaker A: Right, applying to an external job. And this job application had him download a PDF, and that PDF had corrupted code in it. Weird code magic that was able to expose the private keys to the validator and allowed for North Korea to drain the Axie infinity bridge. Ryan. I knew that a docx file could have bad, like, malicious code in it. I did not know that a PDF could have malicious code in it. That is news to me.
01:01:53.438 - 01:01:57.786, Speaker A: What file format is safe? Are there any safe file format still safe?
01:01:57.818 - 01:01:58.166, Speaker B: David.
01:01:58.218 - 01:01:58.686, Speaker A: Jpegs.
01:01:58.718 - 01:02:10.374, Speaker B: All your NFDs and jpegs are still safe? 100% gifts are safe. Beyond that, I can't tell. You. Don't download any gifts are safe. Stop using the Internet, sir. You have to do. It's serious, though.
01:02:10.374 - 01:02:22.778, Speaker B: I mean, this is a $540,000,000 hack, and an individual being targeted in this way is a pretty sophisticated attack. It still kind of boggles my mind. I mean, people in crypto have to.
01:02:22.784 - 01:03:11.762, Speaker A: Be very careful, right? And anyways, speaking of being careful and how crypto people need to do more of that uprise again, a crypto bank or a crypto investment fund, I don't even know. But some entity called Uprise lost 99% of clients funds. Did you know what it was for, Ryan? By shorting Luna during the price crash. And so what did they do? They shorted Luna at $30 with 100 x leverage, and then Luna hit $32 before going to zero, and they got liquidated. This is the lesson in fractals, where if you take 100 x leverage, your time frame goes from long to extremely short. And so it doesn't matter if you are in a 99.99% downtrend.
01:03:11.762 - 01:03:42.206, Speaker A: If you take 100 x leverage, you're taking a micro slice of that price chart, and that thing could go up, like, a ridiculous amount. So what was Luna at the height? It was something like, I don't know, like a $250. If it goes from $250 down to $30, that's like, down like 85, 90%. If it goes up $3, that's up 10%. And if you take 100 x leverage, you get liquidated at that level. That is ridiculous. Imagine losing your entire business by shorting Luna with 100 x leverage.
01:03:42.318 - 01:03:58.710, Speaker B: So dumb. It's so dumb. It's embarrassingly stupid. Uprise took custody crypto assets from customers and traded them in cryptocurrency futures market. And this is what they were doing with it. They say that they have an AI enabled trading technology that's supposed to.
01:03:58.860 - 01:04:00.426, Speaker A: AI enabled. Oh, boy.
01:04:00.528 - 01:04:32.820, Speaker B: With leverage, crypto trading. Wow. And you're going to go short Luna in this type of a market? Some of the mistakes that were made by so called professionals this cycle are completely embarrassing. It's hard for me to wrap my head around it, honestly. It's been. The most surprising thing about this downturn is how dumb the so called professionals have been. Not all of them, but enough of them where you're like, what is this your first time in crypto? Do you know nothing?
01:04:33.190 - 01:04:35.374, Speaker A: You're not a professional, you're just taking leverage.
01:04:35.502 - 01:05:01.142, Speaker B: I guess. I mean, maybe it's just the excess of greed because some of these are smart. Don't. I fundamentally don't understand how these mistakes were made unless you use some explanation of kind of greed and ego. It's going to be something we'll study in the weeks to come, in the months to come. Got to touch this quickly, too. Recently, last week, the EU finalized some new crypto legislation.
01:05:01.142 - 01:05:36.146, Speaker B: I'm going to read you some key points from a thread put together from the policy leader at Ledger, which of course, Ledger, the hardware wallet. They are based in France, so they've been tracking this thing closely, and the TLDR of this legislation is called mica. It doubles down on the failed notion of leading in regulation. This is Seth who's saying this from ledger rather than prioritizing innovation, but it could have been worse. So it fails in a lot of ways. It doesn't prioritize innovation, it prioritizes regulation. But also, David, it could have been worse.
01:05:36.146 - 01:06:06.110, Speaker B: Okay, here are some of the things that were good and some of the things that were bad on nfts, it was good. They were fully out of scope of this round of regulation. So that's a good thing. So is Defi, another good thing. But parliament failed to ban proof of work, blockchains and assets directly. While they didn't ban it directly, they snuck in a potential backdoor to ban it later. So within two years, the Commission must report on mandatory minimum sustainability standards for consensus mechanisms.
01:06:06.110 - 01:06:35.834, Speaker B: So leaving the door open to completely ban proof of work, which is not awesome. Also, stablecoin regulation was particularly heavy handed and requires a physical presence in the EU. Not completely clear what that means, but I wonder if this means in some way. If you are issuing a stablecoin in the EU, you actually have to be jurisdictionally located in the EU. So there's some complications around that. So all in all, a big step. It's not done yet.
01:06:35.834 - 01:06:55.920, Speaker B: There's going to be a second level of legislation, some review clauses, some more agency reports. And I know those crypto companies that are based in Europe will continue fighting for this. So not great. Could have been worse, though. I guess that's what we should expect from legislators and regulators at this stage in the game.
01:06:56.230 - 01:07:34.874, Speaker A: Also going to be one of those things that we continually report on going into the future. Something actually really cool pivoting here. Really cool release out of the L2 aztec network. Aztec Connect finally got launched on Mainnet. For those that don't know Aztec connect, it's kind of like a private VPN for your layer one dFI stuff. So you go to the aztec connect, L2, you put your money there, and then via that L2, that L2 will interact and engage with layer one DFI apps on your behalf in like this privacy wrapper. So it's like when you're on the aztec L2, you get to go do stuff in DFI, but you still exist on the L2 and it's private.
01:07:34.874 - 01:08:05.814, Speaker A: And they use complicated cryptography magic stuff to make that happen. Basically what gets to happen is that you get to do confidential defi staking, vault entry lending and swaps, all private. You get significant gas cost reductions because there's this beautiful symbiosis between privacy and scalability. And you also get to have private treasury management. So like, daos get to manage their treasuries without disclosing what they're doing. You can also do like private NFT purchases and private trading and all that stuff. And so that's pretty cool.
01:08:05.814 - 01:08:12.986, Speaker A: That is a release. You can go and play around with that. And Aztec has not released a token, so maybe you would want to go play around with that.
01:08:13.008 - 01:08:21.594, Speaker B: Do you remember last market cycle? We're talking about privacy tokens and Zcash and Monero and all of these things. Is this essentially embedding that as an app into ethereum?
01:08:21.642 - 01:08:31.934, Speaker A: So I've always said privacy is an app, not an asset. I don't understand privacy tokens. I do understand privacy apps. That makes much more sense.
01:08:32.052 - 01:08:46.770, Speaker B: This is really cool. And I think it's really bullish for privacy. And hopefully this continues to pick up steam. David, we got some bankers that are leaving their banks and going into crypto. What's this? And do you think this is going to be a trend?
01:08:46.850 - 01:09:00.374, Speaker A: Yeah. Quick headline. Three execs leave Morgan this week to join crypto firms. So the brain drain out of Tradfi and into defi continues. So bankers going bankless. What we love to see, if you.
01:09:00.412 - 01:09:02.026, Speaker B: Are a banker and you want a.
01:09:02.048 - 01:09:03.898, Speaker A: Job in crypto, come on over to.
01:09:03.904 - 01:09:24.238, Speaker B: The bankless jobs board. All right? Get a job in crypto. Even if you're not a banker, even if you have no financial skills, there's lots of things that are required. You can go take a look at the bankless job boards. I'm going to read a few out for you right now. The first is from Steakfish, a smart contract software engineer. A backend full stack software engineer as well.
01:09:24.238 - 01:09:26.026, Speaker B: Blockchain marketer from steakfish.
01:09:26.058 - 01:09:27.246, Speaker A: It's not technical.
01:09:27.358 - 01:09:50.602, Speaker B: Steakfish front end software engineer DevOps engineer Steakfish trying to hire everybody right now. Alliance Dow wants a CTO, a software engineer, a senior software engineer and an executive assistant. Non technical otterspace wants a solidity engineer. Abstract ventures, a front end engineer. Boolean Labs founder and CEO, blockchain capital research engineer I could go on. We got uniswap up here.
01:09:50.656 - 01:10:05.210, Speaker A: Is that the alpha? Ooh, look at that alpha. Go. Let's go back up, go back up. Senior mobile engineer iOS Uniswap Labs oh, that is some alpha. That's some Alpha uniswap. What are you up to, guys?
01:10:05.280 - 01:10:27.074, Speaker B: Of course you can find all of this, David and I will remind you every single roll up, but you can find out for yourself on bankless palette.com slash jobs. Make sure you add your email address so you get these to you in your inbox every day. David, we got some hot stuff next, including questions from the nation. As usual, some hot takes. Make sure you like and subscribe if you are enjoying this roll up. We will be right back.
01:10:27.074 - 01:10:30.310, Speaker B: But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:10:30.460 - 01:11:07.470, Speaker A: The L2 era is upon us. Ethereum's L2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need L2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a L2 life. Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge. With across, you don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across's bridges are powered by UmA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens between L2s and Ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across v two has just launched. Their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency, L2 to L2 transfers and a brand new chain with Polygon, all while prioritizing high security and low fees.
01:11:07.470 - 01:11:41.994, Speaker A: You can be a part of across its story by joining their discord and using across for all of your L2 transferring needs. So go to across to quickly and securely bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum or Boba networks, the Brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 Internet with over 60 million monthly active users. And inside the brave browser you'll find the brave wallet, the secure, multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser. Web three is freedom from big tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy. But there's a weak point in web3. Your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed. But the brave wallet is different.
01:11:41.994 - 01:12:12.102, Speaker A: No extensions are required, which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets. Brave Wallet is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains including Ethereum and Salana. You can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp. And of course you can store, send and swap your crypto assets, manage your nfts and connect to other wallets and defi apps. So whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro, it's time to ditch those risky extensions and it's time to switch to the brave wallet. Download brave@brave.com slash bankless and click the wallet icon to get started.
01:12:12.156 - 01:12:32.534, Speaker B: Alright guys, we are back. Time for the questions from the nation. Of course we tweet this out every week. You can ask your question by replying to the tweet. Follow at bankless hq hi David and Ryan, this is from Claudia Eve. I would like to ask about a post merge situation. If I understand it correctly, those who stake on the merge should take a part at transaction fees of transaction fees.
01:12:32.534 - 01:12:37.182, Speaker B: But which part of the fees will it be? Base fee or tips? David, you got the answer for this one.
01:12:37.236 - 01:13:01.874, Speaker A: Yeah, so all transaction fees when you pay on Ethereum are split into two parts, the base fee and the tip. The base fee fluctuates with a percentage of these things fluctuates, but there seems to be an equilibrium about 90 to ten. Base fee to tip. So 90% of that transaction fee goes to the base fee, 10% goes to the tip. The base fee is burnt. That is the EIp 1559 burn. So the majority of ether is burnt.
01:13:01.874 - 01:13:06.438, Speaker A: That is like the stock buyback. That's the ultrasound in ultrasound money.
01:13:06.524 - 01:13:08.226, Speaker B: So everyone gets that if you hold eth.
01:13:08.258 - 01:13:38.974, Speaker A: In a way, if you hold eth, you gain exposure to that burn. Only if you stake eth do you get that extra 10% tips. And you can see in the name, it is a tip that is paid to stakers to prioritize their transaction over other transactions. So the base fee is where transactions used to be before EIP 1559, it used to be only tips. And we just called that the gas fee. Now, the gas fees are both the base fee burn and now the tip. And so the tip has been reduced down to 10%, and that goes directly to validators.
01:13:38.974 - 01:13:45.614, Speaker A: And the more you tip, the higher in the queue that you get. And so all validators get that 10% tip.
01:13:45.742 - 01:14:10.006, Speaker B: And just a reminder for other staking revenue sources. So one is definitely that tip portion. That's the transaction fee portion. Another is, of course, block rewards that a staker receives. And a third source of revenue is maximum extractable value mev, which you also receive as a staker and a validator. So three revenue sources there. David, here's another question from discovercrypto eth.
01:14:10.006 - 01:14:24.542, Speaker B: I know how valuable l two s are to the eth ecosystem. Once complete data sharding happens on ethereum way down the line, and transactions are fast and cheap on l one, what use will we have for things like optimism and arbitrum? David, what you got?
01:14:24.596 - 01:15:16.002, Speaker A: Okay, so the Asker discovercrypto eth, thank you for the question. The way that you're phrasing this is that and transactions are fast and cheap on the layer be with data sharding, they're going to be faster and cheaper, but they will not necessarily be super fast and super cheap. So it doesn't really matter what the state of transactions are on the layer one, that L2s will always be orders of magnitude faster and cheaper than whatever the layer one is. Think of L2s as an exponent of scale. And so if the layer one is x, then the L2s are like to the power of two or to the power of three. And so even if we do like a two x, a three x of the layer one throughput, it doesn't matter because that two x turns into two x squared with L2s. I don't know if you were following the math analogy, but I think it makes sense to me.
01:15:16.002 - 01:15:52.734, Speaker A: It doesn't matter how fast we can get transactions and how cheap we can get transactions on the layer one. Layer twos will always be an exponentially increased order of magnitude faster and cheaper than whatever the layer one is. And also, while the layer one will get faster and will have more total space, I don't think it'll necessarily get cheaper. And so we will always need L2s to have, if we ever want zero fee transactions, it's going to be on L2s and layer threes, and then layer one is going to be kind of expensive, probably all the time. While it will have more total data, it'll probably be pretty expensive, and it'll probably be prohibitively expensive for most people.
01:15:52.852 - 01:16:19.270, Speaker B: Yeah. So to double down on that and be super explicit, transaction fees on layer one are probably never going down. That's not part of Ethereum's scalability strategy. It is scaling on L2. And this is why we've encouraged people to start investigating these L2s, like arbitram, optimism, immutable, and others, because that's going to be your crypto home. That's where you go. Bankless is on these L2s migrate, leave from layer one.
01:16:19.270 - 01:16:40.442, Speaker B: We put out a couple of episodes about this, the great L2 migration that you can check if you want to learn a bit more about this. But I don't think transaction fees are going to go down long term on Mainet, so we should all be migrating to L2s. David, let's do some hot takes of the week. Here's a first one from Layton. What's he saying here?
01:16:40.496 - 01:17:12.098, Speaker A: Layton Qsack, the guy that created all the poolies that we know and love. He says the only lenders Celsius has paid back Aave makerdao compound. And he continues, smart contracts have a higher liquidation preference than any paper agreement. DeFi protects you from Celsius. What he's saying here is that the agreements, the parameters for your loans in DeFi are steeper. They're steeper if they're aave, if they're maker down, if they're compound. And this is the cost of decentralization, you pay higher liquidation penalties, you have to post higher collateral bonds.
01:17:12.098 - 01:17:24.722, Speaker A: And so what he's saying is the automation of DeFi and the smart contract nature of DeFi requires higher level of security, therefore higher level of retail protections. Ryan, protections built into the.
01:17:24.876 - 01:18:11.260, Speaker B: Remember you said markets go bad, it's all arbitrated in court systems, right? Well, not the case with Defi, as we made the point earlier. Right? So Celsius can't get out of these collateralized loans in maker and compound in AavE. They just can't, because it's written in code, and all of their collateral will be completely dissolved. And so they have to pay them back. And so if you're in, Defi puts you at the top of the stack in terms of liquidation preferences. And that's a great place to be. I think, once again, I can't say enough, David, that one of the big outcomes of this whole crypto meltdown that we've seen recently is just like seeing how well DeFi performed, especially relative to CFI, it held up strong.
01:18:11.260 - 01:18:42.766, Speaker B: And I think that is incredibly bullish. And people will realize that on the other side of this bear market, that, hey, at the end of the day, it was the smart contracts that saved us and the centralized lending providers did not. And look at how well they held up for all of the risk and the smart contract risk and all of these other things. They were the ones that actually preserved retail capital, investor capital during the crypto meltdown. So that's a bullish thing. David, what's this take from Vitalik?
01:18:42.878 - 01:19:21.226, Speaker A: I had to screenshot this tweet because it was actually deleted by Rudy Giuliani. So Vitalik is retweeting a Rudy Giuliani tweet, and Vitalik says, claim the crypto space is weird and dumb and we should go back to mainstream institutions which are ruled by adults and then reality. And this is where he was retweeting the Rudy Giuliani tweets. Great products at reasonable prices. Use code Rudy for additional savings. And we are looking at a picture of new sandals. But we have some bad, terrible croc knockoff looking sandals.
01:19:21.226 - 01:19:40.642, Speaker A: Regular price, 79. 98. Actual price, 49. 98 at mypillow.com promo code Rudy with like, a star spangled banner, like fireworks. 4 July savings. Rudy Giuliani is tweeting out a discount code to some knockoff looking sandals.
01:19:40.642 - 01:19:42.178, Speaker A: This is insane.
01:19:42.354 - 01:20:03.830, Speaker B: Yes, David, these are the adults ruling our political system right now. And, yeah, I guess I'm fine with all the crypto weirdness in this context. Okay, here's a tweet from Vance Spencer. We don't need any new narratives. We are like, 0.1% of the way through the current narratives. We do need the grifters and low effort projects to capitulate.
01:20:03.830 - 01:20:28.338, Speaker B: Once a wave of those announcements hit, we are close anyway. How old are you, son? I like the way this ends. I don't know why it ends that way, but here's his point. Once a wave of those announcements hit, we are close, David. We've just seen a wave of those announcements. That's why it's kind of feeling like we're close. And then Vance's other point is like, hey, let's get the whole self sovereign money thing.
01:20:28.338 - 01:20:56.670, Speaker B: Use case. Like, there's still a lot to do on that. Let's get the whole bankless DFI money system down. Let's get nfts in the metaverse to be true. Property rights for things that matter and people will use in their everyday life. Like, we have enough narratives in crypto to blow this thing up to like $100 trillion in total addressable market size. And so we're just a fraction of the way there.
01:20:56.670 - 01:20:57.838, Speaker B: I think it's a great point.
01:20:57.924 - 01:21:31.526, Speaker A: Remember how we were talking about at the beginning of the episode, how, like, I lost this wire transfer and the Ux UI of USDT transfers on Ethereum? It's just like orders magnitude. That's the whole 1% of the way. When we stop doing wire transfers, then we can actually get somewhere. The whole paradigm of instant and permissionless liquidity in uniswap still underappreciated. Boomer defi. And this is why I think he ended it on like, how old are you, son? Boomer DFI? Like, DFI 1.0. That stuff is still crazy.
01:21:31.526 - 01:21:43.418, Speaker A: To most of the world. That stuff is still brand new paradigms. And so Van Spencer is like, yo, guys, I know crypto moves really fast. We cycle from narrative to narrative to narrative. But remember, the first narratives are also still really good.
01:21:43.504 - 01:21:51.950, Speaker B: This might be why he's bullish on some of the DFI blue chips, as he told us last time. David, some advice for what to do during a bear market from Nader. Do you want to read these out?
01:21:52.020 - 01:22:06.366, Speaker A: Yeah. He says, top three things to do during a bear market. One, meet people that stick around. Two, learn about the technology to gain conviction. Three, build something you are passionate about, man, I could have written this tweet. This is a great tweet. This is a great tweet.
01:22:06.398 - 01:22:12.166, Speaker B: That's why we included it in the roll up. Absolutely great advice from Nader there. All Right, David, what are you bullish about this week? Man?
01:22:12.268 - 01:22:30.860, Speaker A: I'm pretty bullish on ECC, which is happening in two weeks. So a week from tomorrow, we're flying out to France. ECC, I can't believe it's been one year. As in it's only been one year. But ECC was like the first conference I went to when conference season, 2021, conference season really started.
01:22:32.270 - 01:22:34.046, Speaker B: It's also the last for a while, right?
01:22:34.068 - 01:22:51.970, Speaker A: Yeah, it is the last for a while. And so it was the first post Covid conference. It was the conference I got my first Covid at. But now Covid's largely over. Everyone's going back. It's like Stannie's going to be there, there's going to be a rave. Makerdao is going to throw their divinity.
01:22:51.970 - 01:23:12.470, Speaker A: So many good talks. A lot of the things that were talked about at ECC last year became kind of like the cultural meta that was discussed in the next year. Nfts were big. Also non financial use. Cases of the blockchain were a very big thing. Vitalik spawned that off. You know what that turned into, Ryan? Soul bound nfts.
01:23:12.470 - 01:23:26.286, Speaker A: And so six months, eight months later, that turned into a big part of the meme, the cultural meme at the time. So I'm just going to go here and see what are people focused on next. And so I remember it's a pretty smart group, too.
01:23:26.308 - 01:23:28.270, Speaker B: It's super smart IQ conference, right?
01:23:28.340 - 01:23:29.514, Speaker A: Yeah, high IQ conference.
01:23:29.562 - 01:23:31.040, Speaker B: Should I intimidate people?
01:23:31.970 - 01:24:00.634, Speaker A: Mean. So tickets are already sold out, I'm pretty sure. But so many people are going anyways for all the peripheral events and this is pretty common for. So, like, if you're around or just want to go to Paris, you can go to ECC, try and bum a ticket off of someone. But if you can't, just go to all the peripheral events, because that's what I'll be doing. There's a ton of peripheral parties, but also actual side conferences and side talks. So I'm going to be doing some sort of content there, whether it's like in person interviews or just writing about it.
01:24:00.634 - 01:24:06.794, Speaker A: Idk. But yeah, I'm bullish on ECC. Great conference. Looking forward to going back.
01:24:06.912 - 01:24:09.910, Speaker B: That's awesome, man. It's their fifth. These are conference ogs.
01:24:09.990 - 01:24:13.014, Speaker A: ECC, by the way, stands for Ethereum community conference.
01:24:13.142 - 01:24:18.590, Speaker B: Oh, cool. Yeah, I feel like I knew that and then I forgot it. And thanks for dragging my memory. Awesome, man.
01:24:18.740 - 01:24:20.542, Speaker A: All right, Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:24:20.676 - 01:24:47.510, Speaker B: I'm not going to say mine because you made fun of it. Okay, David, I'm going to say a different one. Mine originally was, I'm bullish about the future, guys. And I had this thing where optimism know so important and how builders build for optimism. I was inspired by Josh Rosenthal when we were going over this, David laughed out loud when he heard I was bullish on the future. So I'm not going to say that, but I will tell you, I am bullish on David.
01:24:48.010 - 01:24:49.698, Speaker A: Tell me why you're going on.
01:24:49.884 - 01:25:17.170, Speaker B: The future of NFTs say that the stuff that's going on with, like, Reddit and Polygon is incredible. How quickly the narrative and sentiment has shifted on nfts. Now everyone's like, I guess the popular narrative. Not everyone, not people who are deep in crypto, like, NFts were a scam. They're only jpegs. We're like, back to that again. And we've just swung so far to the other end of the pendulum.
01:25:17.170 - 01:25:46.762, Speaker B: A lot of NFTs will fail. Many will go down 99% in value, but there will be a new generation of these nft property rights, these ERc 720 ones, and we'll have a resurgence the next bull market. And look for these signs. When you see the social media companies of the world continuing to build, continuing to add into these things, you can see it start to happen, some of the foundation being laid. So I'm bullish on nfts. I'm also bullish on the future.
01:25:46.896 - 01:26:00.234, Speaker A: Yeah, I bet you are. The problem with being bullish on nfts is that you can be bullish on nfts as a sector, but it's hard to inject that into, like, I'm bullish on this one particular NFT. You know what that makes me bullish on, Ryan?
01:26:00.362 - 01:26:00.750, Speaker B: What?
01:26:00.820 - 01:26:11.774, Speaker A: Block space. Because people rotate through nfts all the time, but there's only one block space. Well, there are L2 block spaces, but it all collapses down to Ethereum block space, Chris.
01:26:11.822 - 01:26:17.890, Speaker B: That makes. But blockspace is the commodity of the crypto age of the next couple of decades for sure.
01:26:17.960 - 01:26:19.834, Speaker A: You know what's a good proxy for blockspace, Ryan?
01:26:19.902 - 01:26:21.794, Speaker B: I do. It's that eth you're holding.
01:26:21.842 - 01:26:23.126, Speaker A: It's that eth. Yeah.
01:26:23.308 - 01:26:26.786, Speaker B: David, I like your plant, by the way. First, roll up with the new plant.
01:26:26.898 - 01:26:28.934, Speaker A: They can't see it, but I'll bring it in here. Here we go.
01:26:28.972 - 01:26:31.034, Speaker B: Yeah. What is it? Does it have a name?
01:26:31.152 - 01:26:33.670, Speaker A: It's a dracina. It's a dracina naganera.
01:26:33.830 - 01:26:36.170, Speaker B: Here it is. What's special about this plant?
01:26:37.070 - 01:26:39.514, Speaker A: It's easy to keep alive when I go travel away.
01:26:39.632 - 01:26:47.582, Speaker B: It looks great. It's got some purple hues, it's got some green. Really impressed. I'm looking forward to seeing your menagerie grow behind you.
01:26:47.716 - 01:26:53.562, Speaker A: This slowly turns into, this is not the plant corner. This is strictly the studio corner.
01:26:53.706 - 01:26:54.426, Speaker B: We're going to have plants.
01:26:54.458 - 01:27:06.834, Speaker A: Okay, well, a few plants, but mainly studio. Since we're on the topics of things that we're bullish on. I don't know if I've told you this. I told you I was going to do it. I don't know if I've told you I've done it, but I bought 10,000 thousand dollars worth of studio equipment yesterday. Ryan.
01:27:06.882 - 01:27:09.526, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Wow. So we're doing this?
01:27:09.628 - 01:27:10.534, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, we're doing it.
01:27:10.572 - 01:27:19.014, Speaker B: Bankruptcy studio is happening. It's official. And look, guys, we're doing this during the bear market. That's how much we believe. How much we believe. David, you want to get to the meme of the week?
01:27:19.052 - 01:27:43.214, Speaker A: Meme of the week? Let's do it. Okay, this is a picture out of Kobe, and it's one of these ones that progresses, and it starts with Q one, 2021. And this is Jerome Powell saying quantitative easing won't cause inflation. And then we go into Q two, 2021, and, okay, now we're some inflation, but it's transitory. Now we're at Q three, 2021. Okay, high inflation, but we're peaking. Q four, 2021.
01:27:43.214 - 01:27:57.794, Speaker A: Okay, inflation might not be transitory, but job market wage growth very strong. And then Q one, 2022. Need to hike aggressively to curb inflation, but no worries. Economy very strong and soft landing possible. Q two, 2022. We are here, by the way. Q two, 2022.
01:27:57.794 - 01:28:06.982, Speaker A: Negative growth in q one, but no recession risk. Q three, 2022. So this is now predicting the future. Okay, recession coming, but you won't lose your home. Q four, 2022.
01:28:07.116 - 01:28:07.462, Speaker B: Okay.
01:28:07.516 - 01:28:14.250, Speaker A: You might lose your home, but you won't starve to death. Q one, 2023. You may die, but you'll go to heaven.
01:28:16.270 - 01:28:17.222, Speaker B: I love this meme.
01:28:17.286 - 01:28:28.506, Speaker A: Super dark. And this is an explicit part of the agenda for the podcast that we're about to go record with Lynn Alden. Oh, God. In ten minutes or in 1 hour and ten minutes? Let me check our schedule.
01:28:28.538 - 01:28:30.586, Speaker B: No, ten minutes, man. We got to be. Oh, fuck.
01:28:30.618 - 01:28:36.462, Speaker A: Ten minutes. Okay. In ten minutes, we are literally going to go ask Lyn Alden about this question. That podcast is coming out this coming.
01:28:36.516 - 01:28:56.566, Speaker B: Monday or next Monday, so we're not in Q two. David, you know, July is Q three. So we're at this phase where it's, okay, recession coming, but you will not lose your home. And then the next phase is, okay, maybe you'll lose your home, but you won't starve to death, and then you actually die. That's the question we have for Lyn Alden. Are we all going to die? Are we going to be okay? Is macro going to be fine?
01:28:56.668 - 01:28:58.962, Speaker A: Am I dumb for being bearish or bullish.
01:28:59.106 - 01:29:12.474, Speaker B: Does this guy have any idea what he's doing? Are the central banks driving us completely off a cliff? Anyway, stay tuned for the macro content. For bankless. As always, got to end with. None of this has been financial advice.
01:29:12.602 - 01:29:13.818, Speaker A: You might die.
01:29:13.994 - 01:29:19.534, Speaker B: You might die. You could definitely lose what you put in. You get dysentery on the journey, but.
01:29:19.572 - 01:29:20.814, Speaker A: We'Re right there with you.
01:29:20.932 - 01:29:26.798, Speaker B: And of course, crypto is not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
01:29:26.884 - 01:29:28.460, Speaker A: If we all die, we all die together.
