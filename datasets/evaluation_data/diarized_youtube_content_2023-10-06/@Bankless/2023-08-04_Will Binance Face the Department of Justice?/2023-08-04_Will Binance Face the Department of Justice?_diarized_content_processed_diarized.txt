00:00:00.170 - 00:00:06.000, Speaker A: Binance could face fraud charges from the Department of justice. But what is the Department of justice waiting for?
00:00:08.210 - 00:00:12.814, Speaker B: Bankless Nation. Happy first Friday of August. David, what time is it?
00:00:12.852 - 00:00:25.606, Speaker A: Oh, Ryan, it's the Bankless Friday weekly roll up, where we cover the entire weekly news in Crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere into this bullish frontier. I'm claiming it's bullish this week. It's a very bullish week to me.
00:00:25.628 - 00:00:33.094, Speaker B: I think it's a bullish. David came down from the mountains bullish. Okay. What was the elevation of matterhorn, and how did that go?
00:00:33.212 - 00:00:37.842, Speaker A: The elevation of matterhorn was 14,690ft.
00:00:37.986 - 00:00:39.014, Speaker B: Okay. Mark that number.
00:00:39.052 - 00:00:45.350, Speaker A: Bankless, you can't necessarily judge a mountain by its elevation. Matterhorn is very steep.
00:00:45.510 - 00:00:52.046, Speaker B: Yeah, but that elevation is high, though, right? That elevation is high as far as mountains go.
00:00:52.068 - 00:00:58.334, Speaker A: I mean, high is high is relative. I wouldn't call it super high. Like Everest is 26,000ft or something like that.
00:00:58.532 - 00:00:59.134, Speaker B: Okay.
00:00:59.252 - 00:01:04.494, Speaker A: Yeah, I was definitely, like, feeling the altitude, that's for sure.
00:01:04.612 - 00:01:14.706, Speaker B: Did you see my comment? That's going to be the elevation of matterhorn is going to be the top price of ether during the next bull cycle. So give us that number again. 14,000. What?
00:01:14.808 - 00:01:16.594, Speaker A: 14,690.
00:01:16.712 - 00:01:18.494, Speaker B: There it is. It has been prophesied.
00:01:18.542 - 00:01:28.946, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm looking forward to as ether pumps through this next bull market. It's like, oh, it passed my summit at Baker. Oh, it passed my summit at Pollock's. Oh, it passed my summit at Renier.
00:01:29.058 - 00:01:33.682, Speaker B: You need to tweet that every single time it does. That's great. Well, it's great to have you back, Danklist.
00:01:33.746 - 00:01:34.934, Speaker A: It's really good to be back.
00:01:35.052 - 00:01:40.586, Speaker B: I'm you dankless, David. And bankless is bankless. It's great to have you back, David.
00:01:40.618 - 00:01:50.318, Speaker A: It's not the first time the word Dankless has been uttered. I'm very excited to be back. It's a very good time to be back. It's a very good week to be in crypto. I was a very entertaining week. Good things happened. Some bad things happened.
00:01:50.318 - 00:01:54.686, Speaker A: More good things than bad things, I would say. And like I said, I'm feeling pretty bullish. I don't know about you all right?
00:01:54.708 - 00:02:12.242, Speaker B: No, I'm feeling bullish, too. Although there were some bad things that happened this week, starting with the Curve exploit, which we got to talk about, that led to a cascade of events across all of DeFi. Everyone's talking about the CRV token right now. We did an entire episode on that. I think we got to get the recap in today's roll up. David, what else we covering?
00:02:12.306 - 00:02:50.866, Speaker A: What else we got? The base launch date is announced. We're about to drop the base, and a meme coin frenzy has already happened on base, so it's already had its meme coin frenzy cycle, or at least the first of perhaps future cycles. Richard Hart is sued by the SEC for fraud and issuing unregistered securities. Man, like I never thought I'd see the day, but here we are. So we're going to talk about all of that and why some people are thinking that the Department of justice is not far behind. And then also, Binance is in the hot seat. Speaking of the Department of justice investigation for fraud, are they too big to fail? Does that matter for Binance? What else we got? Ryan we got some birthdays, don't we?
00:02:50.968 - 00:03:12.858, Speaker B: We got a birthday to celebrate in the episode. I'm not going to tell you what birthday we're about to celebrate, but it's a big one, it's an important one. So stay tuned in the show, guys, for that. David while we're here, we got to shout out our friends and sponsors over at Stator, a new staking protocol that is also decentralized, which is very exciting. David, what's going on with Stator? What do they want the Bankless Nation to know?
00:03:12.944 - 00:03:37.470, Speaker A: Brand new staking as a service protocol on the scene with as low as four ether for your bond. So if you want to run a node with Stator, not just stake with Stator, but run your node with Stator, because it's a permissionless protocol, you can do this. You only have to stake for ETH. It's one of the lowest capital requirements that I've seen. They also are issuing SD token, the native token of the protocol, to people who stake. So if this peaks you, there is a link in the show notes to get started. Staking with stator.
00:03:37.470 - 00:03:39.710, Speaker A: Staking with Stator kind of rolls off the tongue.
00:03:39.790 - 00:03:47.762, Speaker B: All right, let's go see what's cracking. Oh, thanks, Kraken, for these fantastic charts. What's bitcoin price on the week?
00:03:47.816 - 00:03:49.780, Speaker A: When did you think of that one?
00:03:50.550 - 00:03:55.010, Speaker B: Not going to lie. It was a while ago. I've been waiting for that. Been waiting for you to come down the mountains.
00:03:55.090 - 00:04:07.142, Speaker A: Oh, my God. I'm glad you did. Bitcoin started the week at 29,400, down 0.3% to 29,330. Bitcoin lost a whopping $70. So that is flatter than flat.
00:04:07.206 - 00:04:11.498, Speaker B: I would say that's pancake flat right there. How about ETH Price?
00:04:11.584 - 00:04:13.594, Speaker A: ETH price a little bit, actually.
00:04:13.632 - 00:04:14.554, Speaker B: Down bump.
00:04:14.602 - 00:04:25.600, Speaker A: Yeah. Down 18,075. Down one and a half percent to 1840. I didn't say 18,000. We're not there yet. That's later. 1875 down to 1840.
00:04:26.130 - 00:04:30.370, Speaker B: 18,000 would be past your Matterhorn peak there. You got to climb a higher mountain for that to happen.
00:04:30.440 - 00:04:33.890, Speaker A: That's exactly right. That's a great excuse to go climb another mountain.
00:04:35.750 - 00:04:49.074, Speaker B: Man I'm not going to lie, a little bit worried for you on this one. You're posting about, like, snow conditions and whether you should do it or not. I think we're good for now. How about the ratio? ETH bitcoin ratio?
00:04:49.122 - 00:04:54.986, Speaker A: Yeah. Down about one and a half percent. So zero 62. It stayed in the low point sixes for a while now.
00:04:55.088 - 00:04:58.602, Speaker B: Can I zoom out here for a second? It's been kind of flat summer, hasn't it?
00:04:58.656 - 00:05:06.654, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been flat since the start of the last bull market. It's been flat for a very long time. It's been like two years now.
00:05:06.852 - 00:05:08.634, Speaker B: I'm looking back in June.
00:05:08.762 - 00:05:12.430, Speaker A: This is what ether does. It is a stablecoin, and then it goes vertical.
00:05:14.530 - 00:05:21.950, Speaker B: All right, well, it's great. We found our stablecoin finally, the decentralized stablecoin we've been waiting for. How about the crypto market cap, David?
00:05:22.030 - 00:05:24.830, Speaker A: 1.2 trillion. Over 1.2 trillion.
00:05:24.990 - 00:05:25.394, Speaker B: All right.
00:05:25.432 - 00:05:32.790, Speaker A: Hey, man, the total crypto market cap, I mean, it goes up, it goes down, but it's been on an upward trend for seven months in a row now.
00:05:32.940 - 00:05:33.350, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:33.420 - 00:05:34.962, Speaker A: Ever since FTX.
00:05:35.106 - 00:05:47.130, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, not too bad to be above a trillion, as we say. David, let's talk about all of that ETH. What it's doing? What is it doing? It's getting staked. This is crazy to me. Look at these numbers. Can you read them out?
00:05:47.200 - 00:06:07.810, Speaker A: I mean, this isn't new news. It's just the news is that there's more of it happening. 25 million ether staked is the threshold that we have recently passed. 22 and a half million is actively staking with 2.5 million over 10% is actively queued up to waiting to get in. Waiting to get in.
00:06:07.960 - 00:06:23.286, Speaker B: Wow. Yeah, I think there's, like, a 30 to 40 day wait time now. Like, if you're in the queue in order to get in the staking club, you got to wait 40 days, which is pretty incredible. Yeah, man. A lot of interest there. But what happens when more ETH is staked? That means yield goes down.
00:06:23.388 - 00:06:24.022, Speaker A: You'll go down.
00:06:24.076 - 00:06:32.070, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Is that okay? Are we happy with that? I don't care. Do we goes down? Yeah. I don't know. It's part of the game. Part of the game.
00:06:32.140 - 00:06:38.534, Speaker A: I mean, you all can all please unstake, and I will gladly take your take the issuance.
00:06:38.582 - 00:07:06.626, Speaker B: Steve will take all the mev. Let's talk about another type of yield, and that is interest payments. Interest payments are the fastest growing US federal expense. Did you know what is this chart that we're looking on? They're about to pass $1 trillion. I'm, of course, talking about how much the US government has to pay in interest on its debt, because yep, the US government is in a lot of debt. Look at this chart right now. What are we looking at?
00:07:06.728 - 00:07:30.646, Speaker A: We are looking at the chart of government debt. It looks like a shitcoin parabola. That's how I would describe this. So in 1991, we were looking at maybe $4 trillion of government debt. It had already started to increase pretty fast at that point for the decades prior. Moving up to, like, 2005, we're at a doubling of 8 trillion in debt. Moving into 2012, we're at 16 trillion.
00:07:30.646 - 00:07:46.500, Speaker A: So another doubling, 2019, 22 trillion of debt to where we are now at $32 trillion in debt. And that makes, according to this tweet, about $1 trillion in interest payments that the government has to make this year.
00:07:47.670 - 00:07:53.166, Speaker B: This is more than the US spends on defense. Yes. And you know, the US spends a lot on military.
00:07:53.278 - 00:07:57.090, Speaker A: That sounds like spiraling debt. That sounds like spiraling debt.
00:07:57.250 - 00:08:15.242, Speaker B: Well, related to this, Fitch fitch is a ratings agency, so they rate various debts of different kind. Fitch downgraded the US debt rating, basically, their credit worthiness to AA plus from AA, and that apparently one grading lower.
00:08:15.376 - 00:08:24.366, Speaker A: Than AAA isa plus. These ratings, I think, could do it with a redo, but whatever crypto can't fix that yet.
00:08:24.388 - 00:08:51.490, Speaker B: David, their statement was why. So why did they downgrade the US. A few reasons. Three, primarily fiscal deterioration over the next three years. Okay? That means they expect the legislators and Congress and the president to continue spending. Number two, a growing general debt burden we just saw it $32 trillion. Number three, erosion of governance related to its peers.
00:08:51.490 - 00:08:56.614, Speaker B: So the US. Having an inability to actually govern itself.
00:08:56.812 - 00:09:13.758, Speaker A: Some of the comments that they gave are pretty funny. The US. Government lacks a medium term fiscal framework. I think that's related to the governance issue. Like, we can't govern our own spending. The budgeting process is extremely complicated. They cited us.
00:09:13.758 - 00:09:22.062, Speaker A: Politicians don't really know what's going on with their own budget. Quote, you're too confusing to even be a proper government.
00:09:22.196 - 00:09:23.422, Speaker B: Wait, who said that?
00:09:23.556 - 00:09:37.110, Speaker A: Okay, I'm quoting Kyla Scanlon, who's quoting so we're hearing this through the grapevine a little bit, but then also they cited the rising costs of Social Security and Medicare. We got an old population just like, shout out to Kyla and her humor boomers are booming.
00:09:38.650 - 00:09:59.046, Speaker B: Very true. Luke Rahman has a take here. The US. Cannot mathematically sustain their debt and deficits without sustained negative real rates. That's a problem when you raise rates. So don't tell me the downgrade doesn't make sense. Tell me which suckers at the card table collectively have a big enough balance sheet to hold 32 trillion in debt at negative real rates.
00:09:59.046 - 00:10:04.034, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a question. I don't know who's buying bonds, David. Do you? Who's buying bonds? You buying any bonds?
00:10:04.102 - 00:10:04.814, Speaker A: Not me.
00:10:04.932 - 00:10:07.002, Speaker B: I'm buying ether. The Internet bond?
00:10:07.066 - 00:10:22.420, Speaker A: Yeah, the bonds that are both giving you real yields and also capital appreciation. Yeah, I remember talking last week, we were talking about, like, the Fed, because the Fed raised interest rates last week. A quarter quarter, 25 bips, if you will. Percent.
00:10:23.350 - 00:10:26.580, Speaker B: I like the cut of your jib, David. Finance terms.
00:10:29.210 - 00:11:10.286, Speaker A: But the comment I made is like, man, I haven't thought about macro or interest rates. We haven't talked about the Fed pivoting in forever now. It's like the markets a kind of have written off how big of a deal these interest rates are anymore, because they are also slowing down and getting smaller, but also inflation is coming down. But also all of the points that people have originally made is like, sure, we can jack up interest rates to combat inflation, but the Fed has a date with destiny, and that destiny is to print money at some point in time. And so I think there's a decent possibility that the markets have written off the pivot. We've forgotten about it. But at some point in time, the money printer must resume.
00:11:10.286 - 00:11:17.060, Speaker A: And whether that's one year, three years, five years, ten years, I don't know. But I think the market has written that off.
00:11:17.590 - 00:11:57.330, Speaker B: David, you're starting to sound a little bit like radio to me. Yeah, I guess you're bullish crypto. You're bearish government debt. Do you remember, I think it was a couple of roll ups ago where I asked this question about all this Fed tightening. Interest rates raised from basically close to 0% all the way to above 5%, right? And I remember being told at that time, and a lot of the prognosticators were saying, that will absolutely devastate everything. Like, that will be a catastrophe, widespread job loss, like stock market will go down, all of these bad things would happen. And so I was told the Fed tightening would nuke everything.
00:11:57.330 - 00:12:08.998, Speaker B: And the question is, why didn't it? Guess what? I think Ray Dalio is a listener to the bankless podcast because he heard that question maybe and wrote his entire post about that this week.
00:12:09.084 - 00:12:09.634, Speaker A: Thanks, Ray.
00:12:09.682 - 00:12:58.550, Speaker B: He answered the question, and I think he did a good job answering it. Here's the take from Ray Dalio on why there was a big government engineering shift in wealth from, one, the public sector, the central government and central bank, and number two, the holders of government bonds, to the private sector, which are households and businesses. This made the private sector relatively insensitive to the Fed's very rapid tightening to a more normal monetary policy. And as a result of this coordinated government maneuver, the household sector's balance sheets and income statements are in good shape while the governments are in bad shape. So that's why unemployment is low. Feels like the private sector is doing okay. The stock market is almost all time high because you know who took all the bullets for us? The US.
00:12:58.550 - 00:13:28.570, Speaker B: Balance sheet. That $32 trillion that we were looking at over there. And Bondholders, that was the take. He simplifies it a little bit more simply. Central banks took on a lot more debt, so their balance sheets deteriorated, and the central banks printed a lot more money, which caused inflation to rise and bought a lot of the debt to get money into the hands of the private sector, which now, as a result, is in relatively good shape financially. So, yeah, bondholders took a haircut. The government's balance sheet took all the bullets.
00:13:28.570 - 00:14:12.266, Speaker B: The private sector is doing okay. Wealth inequality increased even more. And that begs the question of what's the next phase of all of this? And I think the answer, according to Ray Dalio, is more money printing, as you're saying, but a different type of money printing. We already did the QE thing. We already did the buying bonds thing. The next step, according to Ray Dalio's, long term cycles and his planning is basically like helicopter money directly to the people to decrease wealth inequality. All sorts of government programs, fiscal and central bank programs kind of become the same, and we're just printing money and giving it to the people.
00:14:12.266 - 00:14:13.518, Speaker B: That's kind of the next step.
00:14:13.604 - 00:14:17.006, Speaker A: Why do the people get the money? What's the motivation there?
00:14:17.108 - 00:14:24.542, Speaker B: Well, because look at things like the stock market's at an all time high, right? But also wealth inequality has increased in the US.
00:14:24.596 - 00:14:37.874, Speaker A: But don't the people need to grab their pitchforks in order to induce the motivation in order to get the helicopter money? Yes, david right. We're not going to be like, hey, we've decided to give a distribution to the people, like, no, I mean, look out there.
00:14:37.912 - 00:14:42.498, Speaker B: Are you seeing pitchforks? Because I see pitchforks. They might be a little bit in the distance.
00:14:42.674 - 00:14:43.714, Speaker A: I'm not seeing pitchforks.
00:14:43.762 - 00:14:49.286, Speaker B: So much anger, like, politically. I mean, look at our political climate. I think so much of yeah, I.
00:14:49.308 - 00:14:57.542, Speaker A: See there's a number of step, a gap in that happening. And then also helicopter money. I don't see those things. Like having a smooth directional null.
00:14:57.606 - 00:15:42.934, Speaker B: I don't think it'll be smooth, but I think that there is increasing anger. I blame social media for some of these things, blame the Internet for some of these things. I think a lot of the anger just in general, answer the question of why is everyone angry all of the time? Is due to wealth inequality, due to shrinking pie, due to lack of economic opportunities. Again, the top 10%, the top 1% are doing fairly well in this type of environment, but a lot of people are left behind. The whole rural versus urban thing, that's another lens on this. Not to get into politics, but 2024 in the US. Political is going to be real rocky for many reasons.
00:15:42.934 - 00:15:47.562, Speaker B: For lots of reasons. But one of them, I think, is part of the wealth inequality story.
00:15:47.696 - 00:16:03.134, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think one of the big things that people were looking for is a depreciation of house prices, housing prices, and that has not happened. If you bought at the real estate at the top of the market in 2021, you're doing just fine. You're doing great.
00:16:03.252 - 00:16:21.238, Speaker B: Student debt is another example. That whole large conversation. I mean, there's many areas where this is spilling over into political but let's move on. Let's talk about Tether for a second. Did you know, David, that Tether now holds more UST? Bills than Australia? It's pretty crazy.
00:16:21.324 - 00:16:28.360, Speaker A: All righty, then. Okay. I mean, I don't know how many T bills Australia holds less than Tether. Yeah.
00:16:29.370 - 00:16:56.386, Speaker B: So Tether, David, has $72 billion worth of T bills, and apparently this is larger than the nation state of Australia. So there's a comment from Collins Belton about this. Wow. If true, Tether is apparently holding more T bills than Australia and also the UAE and many other countries at this point, regardless of whether you believe on their history. I think it's hard to see the US. Government railroading these guys easily anymore. What does that mean?
00:16:56.568 - 00:16:58.878, Speaker A: Who's? The USG. And what's railroading?
00:16:59.054 - 00:17:01.380, Speaker B: USG's. Government. He's saying the US. Government.
00:17:02.070 - 00:17:03.150, Speaker A: What's railroading?
00:17:03.230 - 00:17:10.120, Speaker B: I think what he's saying is basically like, the US. Government is not going to shut Tether down, is not going to completely.
00:17:11.850 - 00:17:13.186, Speaker A: Too big to fail.
00:17:13.378 - 00:17:34.350, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's what he's saying. Basically, when something like this gets too big, the government doesn't kill it because that would be painful for everyone involved. Instead of killing it, they just legitimize it in some way. And so Collins is making the point that this seems to be what could be happening with Tether. I mean, they got a lot more T bills than most countries.
00:17:35.090 - 00:17:49.460, Speaker A: I'm not sure how I feel about that. That's probably bullish for crypto assets because it reduces the systemic risk of Tether. But then crypto just made another bank that's too big to fail. I'm not sure how to feel about this.
00:17:49.910 - 00:17:50.642, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:17:50.696 - 00:17:53.954, Speaker A: I don't know how to take I'm going to take the bullish side. I'm bullish because of it.
00:17:53.992 - 00:17:59.206, Speaker B: All right, it's bull week, so when in doubt, you choose bullish. David, what do we have coming up next?
00:17:59.308 - 00:18:23.862, Speaker A: Coming up next, curve exploit and its founders. Megaloan sends DeFi into a hot seat base, surpasses Arbitrum in daily transactions. And it's not even live yet. And a protocol has celebrated its 8th birthday. Starting to throw a little bit of breadcrumbs your way? We'll figure out who or what it is. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. We're going to hear what's Kraken from Kraken.

Today, introducing Polygon 20, the value layer for the Internet. For too long, the limitations of blockchains have held back app development and stifled user adoption. The Internet allows anyone to create and exchange information.
00:19:13.966 - 00:19:54.294, Speaker A: What's missing is a value layer that lets anyone exchange, store and program value. That's where Polygon 20 comes in. Polygon Labs has unveiled a series of innovations that will radically alter the polygon ecosystem and web3 as a whole by leveraging groundbreaking ZK innovations such as Polygon ZKE EVM the next iteration of the best in class planky two proving system and a first of its kind ZK powered interoperability layer. Polygon 20 will give users and devs unlimited scalability and unified liquidity. Right now, there is a polygon improvement proposal regarding a potential ZK powered upgrade of polygon proof of stake. If approved, polygon proof of stake would become a layer two ZKE EVM validium. So make your voice heard on this proposal.
00:19:54.294 - 00:20:00.806, Speaker A: By joining the polygon discord today, you have a chance to help the polygon community give the internet the value layer it deserves.
00:20:00.918 - 00:20:07.854, Speaker B: Curve Finance was hacked this week, and it sent shockwaves across all of DFI and crypto. David, what happened here?
00:20:07.972 - 00:21:16.262, Speaker A: Yeah, so, there was a vulnerability in the coding language Viper that Curve used for some of its pools. So this is actually pretty damn deep in the tech stack. And so I don't think it was anything in the way that Curve pools were built, but because they use Viper and because Viper forgot to have these re entrance checks in their code base, as a result, it allowed for a reenter and c attack, which is a pretty known attack. It's actually how the Dow hack got drained back in 2016. And so Curve had a reentrancy attack thanks to I guess thanks to the coding language Viper that forgot to have reentrancy checks in it, $70 million was drained from four Curve pools the Pindle ETH pool, the Metronome ETH pool, alchemy's ETH pool, and then the Curve ETH liquidity pool. About $20 million was actually recovered by white hat hackers and mevbots. Interestingly enough, which is an interesting little side quest of this story, but the big story is that because of the Curve ETH pool, $5.1
00:21:16.262 - 00:22:01.874, Speaker A: million of Curve tokens, 7.2 million Curve tokens was drained and then taken into the exploiter's wallet. Now, that's one thing that's bad, because this exploiter gets $7.2 million. The reason why this goes from a bad story about Curve to a bad story about DFI is because the Curve founder, Michael Igorov had taken out about $110,000,000 of stablecoin loans against his 460,000,000 Curve tokens, which was almost $300 million at the pre exploit price. Then, once you put $7 million of Curve tokens into the hands of an exploiter, people start to react to that, because that is we are just one button press away from dumping $5.1 million of Curve tokens into the market.
00:22:01.874 - 00:22:40.890, Speaker A: So people start to withdraw liquidity. People who are providing liquidity to Curve across DFI, either in stablecoin pairs with Curve or ETH pairs with Curve, they start to yank their liquidity because they don't want to get dumped on. So liquidity starts to dry up around Curve. And so that makes the liquidity profile around Curve very precarious. And especially when Michael has $110,000,000 of collateral of borrowed stable coins against his Curve collateral, he is under duress. His positions are under duress. And if that Curve exploiter decided to liquidate his Curve, they would cause a cascading liquidations if Michael was not able to bolster up his positions.
00:22:40.890 - 00:23:17.322, Speaker A: He has since sold about $16 million of Curve to pay back some of his loans, but he still has 90 something million dollars in loans to pay back across DFI protocols. Now here's all of the DFI protocols that Michael has put Curve tokens into and borrowed Stablecoins from Ave V Two is the biggest one coming in at 300 million. Curve tokens, which is 34% of the circulating supply of CRV. Abracadabra has 51 million. FRAX Lens had 41 million. Inverse Finance had 25 million. Dake dow had 3 million.
00:23:17.322 - 00:23:36.138, Speaker A: Silo had 2 million. This guy put Curve across DFI and then borrowed Stablecoins, like I said, 110,000,000 stablecoins. And so all of these are in precarious positions. If Curve goes down to the price of, I think, $0.34, it's currently at $0.38 last I checked. But if everyone said $0.34,
00:23:36.138 - 00:23:38.718, Speaker A: he would be liquidated and that would cause $0.38.
00:23:38.814 - 00:23:40.100, Speaker B: Did it get that low?
00:23:40.950 - 00:24:13.580, Speaker A: It did. Flash crash that low, but not to the point of it actually being liquidated in D Five protocols. So we're still good here for now. Curve price is currently at $0.58, which is where it was 24 hours ago as well. So he's looking good for now, but it's still not a good place to be. Why? What did this man do with the $110,000,000 that he borrowed from all these D Five protocols? Well, just a few months ago, he happened to have bought a $40 million mansion and also a second one.
00:24:13.580 - 00:24:23.666, Speaker A: So he's got 2 million, like, multimillion dollar mansions in Melbourne, Australia, that he bought. One of them he bought just a few months ago. I don't know about the other one.
00:24:23.768 - 00:24:36.094, Speaker B: Seems like it could be related to the stablecoin borrowing, but seems like we don't know for sure. Let's say that's a question, I suppose.
00:24:36.222 - 00:25:02.298, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's actually a ton more in this story. And we did a 45 minutes, an hour long episode yesterday that got released. So we are just kind of giving the highest level of recaps. So if you want to catch up on this and go dive down into this, there's a fantastic article that Bankless, the bankless newsletter team put together, shout out Jack. And then also we use that article to inform a podcast that we put out yesterday. And so we have just given you the high level recap.
00:25:02.298 - 00:25:06.190, Speaker A: The story goes very deep, but that's it right there.
00:25:06.260 - 00:25:14.986, Speaker B: I mean, the TLDR is we're going to be okay. This is not systemic beyond right now. The CRV token. Yes, CRV token.
00:25:15.098 - 00:25:22.210, Speaker A: And also, if you are a D Five protocol governor, then who has CRV as collateral? You need to pay attention, but other than that, you're fine.
00:25:22.360 - 00:25:42.826, Speaker B: Some cool things going on in the layer two world. This is, after all, layer two summer. It's been layer two summer for about two years now, but it's definitely layer two summer now. The base Mainet has just been announced that the launch date for that. That date is you ready for it, David? August 9. Okay. This is next week, the next roll up.
00:25:42.826 - 00:25:50.538, Speaker B: You hear Base Mainet will be launched. There's already been some activity on Base Mainet as well. Should we talk about that?
00:25:50.624 - 00:26:09.858, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. So Base has been open for developers to go build stuff. And some developers have definitely built stuff, and some people have just went on and minted tokens and meme coins and started trading them. And so this has been like the news of Base in this last week or so. This Bald token was launched on July 30. So just like four days ago.
00:26:09.944 - 00:26:11.426, Speaker B: It's literally called bald. Right?
00:26:11.448 - 00:26:27.478, Speaker A: It's called bald. It's called bald. Why is it called bald? Because there's a meme that Bald founders are bullish. I'm pretty sure that was Djenis. Barton that started that. And so this is Brian Armstrong's chain. It's not actually but associated with coinbase, therefore associated with Brian Armstrong, who is a Bald man.
00:26:27.478 - 00:26:55.230, Speaker A: Who is a bullish Bald man. So the Bald token was made, and so that launched on July 30. When all tokens are minted, they all start at a valuation of zero. And that went to $50 million in market cap in just under a day with over $100 million of trading volume. Now, this is a pre main net base. One of the reasons why this just rocketed to $50 million in market cap is because you can't actually leave base. You can only go on base.
00:26:55.230 - 00:27:08.966, Speaker A: You can't go out of base. There's no off ramp. There is now since an off ramp. But while this thing was pumping, there was no way to get off of Base. And so Bald token just created $50 million out of thin air. And you know what happened next?
00:27:08.988 - 00:27:11.158, Speaker B: Ryan, tell me.
00:27:11.324 - 00:27:52.450, Speaker A: It was a rug. And so, as soon as it hit $50 million, the Bald deployer yanked over 1000 ether of liquidity, and others removed 6800 ether of liquidity. And another person released 1800 ether of liquidity. So over about 10,000 ether was joint of liquidity. And this thing goes from $50 million down to below $10 million. The valuation of Bald, not that it matters or you should care, but if you are curious, the valuation of Bald is about eleven to $12 million as of now, after falling about 90%. And so a short little token meme coin mania in base, but the founders removed about $32 million.
00:27:52.600 - 00:28:00.790, Speaker B: Now, we've seen meme coins before. I mean that we've seen a lot of meme coins. Of course. This is the first on base, and it was certainly the largest last week.
00:28:00.860 - 00:28:04.086, Speaker A: Congrats base. You got your first meme coin, and.
00:28:04.108 - 00:28:34.878, Speaker B: You were just talking about the liquidity being drained. There's more to that, because the person, the individual who removed the liquidity, seems to be the founder of Bald, the instantiator of the meme coin. And this individual, the founder, was. Actually the lead rug puller here and withdrew $32 million of ETH liquidity. So it was basically a founder rug meme coin that happened on the base blockchain.
00:28:34.974 - 00:28:37.534, Speaker A: Do you get to call yourself a founder if you just founded a meme coin?
00:28:37.582 - 00:28:42.370, Speaker B: Yeah, I shouldn't have said founder. What is that scammer?
00:28:44.230 - 00:28:46.100, Speaker A: Is it a scam? Because.
00:28:47.830 - 00:28:49.314, Speaker B: What is a scam anymore?
00:28:49.442 - 00:28:56.290, Speaker A: You're rugging liquidity. But I'm assuming they never brought, like, advertise. Here's what I'm going to do with this base token.
00:28:56.370 - 00:29:28.270, Speaker B: It's gross. I don't know what it is we use for it, but we'll call it gross, that's for sure. But there's some conspiracy theories going on about this, on who is the minter, the scammer in chief behind Bald. So there's a lot of this conversation going on in crypto Twitter. This is one account, Hype, saying, to summarize thousands of ETH between FTX and Bald, the Bald deployer was the first voter on all Sushi proposals. Listen to these clues. The Bald deployer tweets the same sentence structure as Who SBF.
00:29:28.430 - 00:29:29.140, Speaker A: What?
00:29:29.990 - 00:29:55.306, Speaker B: First time we've used those initials in a while. The Bald deployer was the biggest dYdX farmer. The Bald deployer's dYdX post sounds a lot like SBF in terms of sentence structure. The on chain activity lines up with court dates and bail of Who SBF. We know SBF was doing stuff through VPN recently, okay? A lot of the Sleuthers are doing Sleuth stuff, okay? And there is a Charlie meme of.
00:29:55.328 - 00:29:59.190, Speaker A: All the people, all the lines going across, all the different clues.
00:29:59.350 - 00:30:52.046, Speaker B: This is total crypto Twitter conspiracy theory. But there is the possibility, at least crypto Twitter was considering the possibility that the rugger in chief was actually our friend SBF. And can you imagine, David, that one of the biggest frauds in history. Just, like, hypothetically imagine, okay, Charlie conspiracy theory gets out on bail from his parents basement, launches a $30 million rug on one of his biggest competitors, chains called Bald, and he thought no one would notice. Like, if that's the case, that's what happened. Now, I personally don't think that's the case after the sleuths on crypto Twitter have kind of batted this around. But I will say it does seem like the individual who deployed this has some ties to Alimated Research, which is.
00:30:52.148 - 00:30:53.886, Speaker A: That is a fact. That is a known fact.
00:30:53.988 - 00:31:03.406, Speaker B: That is a fact, and is absolutely crazy here. This is another take. Somebody who's been doing some sleuthing. What does this say?
00:31:03.508 - 00:31:35.420, Speaker A: Yeah, they say Igor says, all right, I've been sitting on this news all day, but let's look at the Bald base Bald Twitter account, which is the account that issued the base token deployer address. This is definitely someone from Alameda, but I don't think we can safely say that it is FBS. This is definitely someone from Alameda, but we cannot safely say that is SBF, even though he's a psycho, is what this person says. And so yeah, so if you just sleuth around and you go back to the originating address. It's associated with Alameda research. So Scammers going to scam what they do.
00:31:35.790 - 00:31:40.700, Speaker B: And they say that Sam has no access to a laptop or a limited access.
00:31:41.070 - 00:31:56.238, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know the details of it, but it's like he can access the New York Times and government approved websites. I bet you he cannot be issuing contract addresses on Ethereum. I bet. That is not allowed.
00:31:56.334 - 00:32:00.510, Speaker B: So they say. But the conspiracy theory lives on on crypto Twitter.
00:32:00.670 - 00:32:48.466, Speaker A: Anyways, as a result of all this, Bald has made Base surpass arbitram again. Before Base is launched, Bald transactions surpass Arbitrum transactions in daily transaction volume, 5.3 million transactions settled in one day. Which, interestingly enough, Ryan has made Base profitable. So the layer two base sequencer has accrued 700,000 profit dollars of profit in just three days, which is about $85 million on an annual basis. Now, this is straight alpha for Coin price, in my opinion. Do you think Wall Street analysts understand how to value that thing? It's not even on main net and Base Coinbase, whoever is validating Base, I think 15% of these profits goes to the optimism collective, actually.
00:32:48.466 - 00:32:56.578, Speaker A: But on an $85 million annual basis pre main net launch, that's what Coinbase would get.
00:32:56.664 - 00:33:42.834, Speaker B: I doubt Wall Street is considering this, although Coinbase does have an earnings report that's coming out shortly, so maybe we'll see something in that. Go take a look at that. I don't think Wall Street's considering it, although and so you're saying this could be a bull case. Although you could also make this a bear case because the driver of all of this profit was a scammy meme Coin. And it's possible that US regulators point to Coinbase and say, ah, so this is your crypto chain that you say is going to revolutionize finance in the world and the very first big hit on it and a driver of your profit is a scammy meme Coin rug pull. Right. So I don't know bearish or bullish on this initial use case here, I.
00:33:42.872 - 00:33:44.926, Speaker A: Choose to interpret the bullish scenario.
00:33:45.118 - 00:33:46.366, Speaker B: It's that kind of huh.
00:33:46.398 - 00:34:10.254, Speaker A: Although it is that kind of, you know, base is a permissionless chain. And just in case anyone was confused, you do not need to go through KYC to get on Base. You can go to the Base layer two through the ethereum layer one without doing any sort of KYC. Anthony Cesano had a really good take this week about this. Funniest thing about this launch of Base is that it's only meant to be for developers. The official public launch is scheduled for early August. That's august guess.
00:34:10.254 - 00:34:20.894, Speaker A: 9th. But Dgens are so starved for volatility that they aped. Anyways. Amazing. See, bullish appetite trading. Appetite is on the table. People want to buy tokens right now.
00:34:21.012 - 00:34:30.642, Speaker B: For this crap, though. It's like casino stuff. I hate it. I hate it. Hey, we're going to get there.
00:34:30.696 - 00:34:31.218, Speaker A: Tokens are going.
00:34:31.224 - 00:34:39.400, Speaker B: Token david, at some point, the high utility, good for the world use cases will crowd out and buy the block space.
00:34:40.170 - 00:34:45.174, Speaker A: The dumb use cases come first. The better use cases are harder and therefore come second.
00:34:45.292 - 00:34:47.638, Speaker B: Yeah, say that again. So I believe it.
00:34:47.804 - 00:34:57.402, Speaker A: The dumb, stupid, easy use cases come first. The harder public goods, good for humanity bullish use cases are harder to do, but they come second.
00:34:57.536 - 00:35:08.638, Speaker B: Oh, well, speaking of that, I've got another story for you. Richard Hart. Do you remember that? A dumb, stupid meme coin token called Hex? What happened with that this week?
00:35:08.724 - 00:35:40.694, Speaker A: Not just hex. Yeah. So the SEC has sued Richard Hart over Hex, Pulse Chain and Pulse X, alleging that he raised over a billion dollars across three different unregistered securities since beginning in 2019. He also defrauded investors by using investor funds for personal goods. I think there's plenty of evidence for that on crypto Twitter. He just flashes that around. The lawsuit says that Hart continually touted these investments as a pathway to grandiose wealth for investors, claiming that Hex, for example, was built to be the highest appreciating asset that has ever existed in the history of man.
00:35:40.694 - 00:36:27.190, Speaker A: Although Hart claimed these investments were for the vague purpose of supporting free speech, he did not disclose that he used millions of dollars of Pulse Chain investor funds to buy luxury goods for himself. As a result of this suit, hex, Pulse Chain and Pulse X have all dropped a lot. I got a chart tab if you want to open up that one. Hex went from one penny to half a penny down 50%, which is pretty bad. Pulse Chain went from zero, zero one dollars, so one 10th of one penny down to six hundredths of one penny. This is really annoying because the denomination on these are so low, because that's part of the strategy here. And then Pulse X goes from I'm sorry about this three down to we should do these in market cap negative.
00:36:27.190 - 00:36:52.030, Speaker A: It's also hard to see the market cap on these things just because of the way that these yeah, but anyways, Hex is down 50%. Pulse chain is down 40%. Pulse X is down 40%, which is pretty bad. I put these two charts together. I've layered on the Hex chart, on top of the Terra Luna chart, and also scaled it up to market cap. Did you know that at its very peak, hex was double the market cap of Terra Luna?
00:36:52.530 - 00:36:53.534, Speaker B: Wait, what?
00:36:53.652 - 00:36:53.934, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:53.972 - 00:36:57.534, Speaker B: It was worth $80 billion at the peak of Hex.
00:36:57.662 - 00:37:02.354, Speaker A: It was a top ten token, bro. At the peak of Hex, wasn't it was yes.
00:37:02.472 - 00:37:04.530, Speaker B: What is wrong with this industry?
00:37:05.110 - 00:37:17.880, Speaker A: Dude, this is what we've been doing, man. What? It's not great. Hex $80,000,000,000.02 X the valuation of Luna before Luna went to zero.
00:37:19.790 - 00:37:36.570, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, man. Okay, this is another part of the story. David uniswap, at least on the user interface side, delisted the Hex tokens the official Uniswap user interface basically delisted it. Now, does that mean that Uniswap the protocol has also delisted Hex?
00:37:36.650 - 00:37:56.258, Speaker A: No, it does not. It does not mean that. Why did specifically the front end so Uniswap.com does not let you the front end website that you find in your browser does not let you buy or sell Hex anymore. Uniswap protocol does not know about the Uniswap.com front end. Those are different pieces of technology.
00:37:56.258 - 00:38:19.754, Speaker A: There's many different ways to access the Uniswap protocol. So hex is still trading on Uniswap. No token can be, has ever be, or will ever be delisted from Uniswap the protocol. But the Uniswap Labs company who operates the Uniswap.com front end has not has disabled the ability to buy or sell or interacts with Hex in any particular way, which I think is just completely fine.
00:38:19.872 - 00:38:34.400, Speaker B: Can I ask you, as I'm as I was thinking about Hex, right? So there's no question in my mind this was sort of a self promotional meme coin for this individual, richard Hart. His real name is Richard Schuyler, by the way.
00:38:36.210 - 00:38:39.490, Speaker A: Richard Schuyler, I think sure, it's not as cool as Richard Hart.
00:38:40.630 - 00:39:26.738, Speaker B: I mean, he used this to personally get wealthy. I remember David, you know, as part of the kind of the ledger leak, all sorts of addresses were leaked, these sorts of things, I actually received a physical mailing from Hex and Pulsechain promoting their token. I don't know that this came from Richard Schuyler or who this came from, but like on Twitter, everything, it was very clearly a pump and dump memetic scam coin promoted by an individual. Right. So it's incredibly distasteful, not what this industry should represent. We could go on about it. I think the question in my mind is what is the actual difference between Hex and XRP, though? All right, so here's the problem.
00:39:26.738 - 00:39:51.658, Speaker B: I worry with the SEC. I cannot defend this individual, this project cannot defend it at all. But if you give the SEC an inch, they'll take a mile. And I expect they will make similar arguments that they made in the XRP case, in the Hex case. And who is willing to defend Richard? Who's willing to defend Hex? Who's willing to defend pulsechain. I'm certainly not. Right.
00:39:51.658 - 00:40:19.602, Speaker B: But is it a security? Is the asset itself a security? Is baldcoin a security? Are all of the dog coins a security? I don't think they are. So I'm not entirely excited that the SEC is coming for a token. I'm sort of excited about the outcome know, hey, we get another kind of scammer off the that's great, that's great. But what about the precedent? What's your reaction to that? What do you think about this?
00:40:19.736 - 00:41:19.974, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the point that you are making is that XRP and Hex, it can be claimed that they serve very similar purposes, which is to enrich the issuing entity. The major difference between ripple is that they actually had some intent of doing interbank settlement transfers, as scammy as one might think Ripple is, they actually had some intent of building something. And one might say that Richard, well, he did build a chain. He raised a billion dollars, and maybe he spent $1 million actually building the thing that he promised to, but the intent is just so different. Also, I don't think ever ripple directly touted financial gain about XRP. And if you the lawsuit says Hart continually touted these investments as a pathway to grandiose wealth for investors, claiming that hex was built to be the highest appreciating asset that has ever existed in the history of man. I don't think Ripple ever did that.
00:41:20.092 - 00:41:27.670, Speaker B: I guess what I'm saying is I don't know that this passes the Howie test any more than XRP does.
00:41:27.740 - 00:41:37.740, Speaker A: Yeah. If we went through the litigation process, I think what you're saying is like yeah, you would find similar the reasons why XRP is not a security might be similar to the reason why hex is not a.
00:41:39.550 - 00:41:43.862, Speaker B: Founders is so subjective, or the intent of the issuers is so subjective.
00:41:43.926 - 00:42:04.610, Speaker A: And then you're saying like, okay, while we can't support Richard Hart and I would like to see him punished, is this the method that we want to see that happening? And I think you're calling into question that. And I'm happy just to take this isn't the appropriate way of using Occam's Razor, but just taking the simple approach of saying, like, I don't give a fuck, I want the man in jail.
00:42:05.430 - 00:42:24.230, Speaker B: I just worry about the precedent that sets in general. It's like Gary Gensler stacks it up as a win. What an easy target. It's kind of the same thing they did with SBF, basically, which is like, of course SBF was a scammer and no one could defend. And like, then they go and they present, they see Exhibit A. This is what crypto is. Here's your God, here's your hero.
00:42:24.230 - 00:42:55.302, Speaker B: His name is Sam Bankman Fried, and he perpetrated one of the largest scams in history. That's all crypto is. And they win their cases that way and they chip away at us. So that's what I'm worried about the kind of the credible neutrality is. But what's weird is now it sounds like I'm defending Richard Skyler and hex and Pulse chain, and I'm not doing Richard SEC. I am not doing that at all. To be just I worry about the precedent this sets, but it might not just be the SEC bringing a case against him.
00:42:55.302 - 00:42:56.918, Speaker B: What's this piece of the story?
00:42:57.004 - 00:43:49.734, Speaker A: Okay, so this is now speculation, but Martin Screlli was engaging with Eric Wall. And Eric Wall is he's been interestingly, a part of the whole hex ecosystem, not as a promoter, as one of the guys trying to take it down and help prove the fraud to the hexagons, even though they don't want to see it. Anyways, Martin Screlly is replying to Eric Wall and Martin Screlly is the guy who went to jail for jacking up, I think, like, EpiPen costs. Remember him? And now he's in crypto. And so he goes if you look at page 90 of the sentencing guidelines, he is already at 40 points, which, if you look up the sentencing chart in the same PDF, is recommended life sentence with all the victims. It's a rough situation if he gets cuffed. So this is talking about the Department of justice, and so Martin Screlly is saying that he might rack up enough whatever these points are, rack up enough points.
00:43:49.734 - 00:43:59.078, Speaker A: And Martin Screlly would be very familiar with this as somebody who he racked up, he said 39 points, and if you get to 40 points, the sentencing chart can put you in jail for life.
00:43:59.164 - 00:44:01.906, Speaker B: What are these points? Is this like, fraud?
00:44:02.098 - 00:44:11.318, Speaker A: I think I'm not sure. I've never racked up any points. I've never been charged by the Department of justice misappropriation.
00:44:11.414 - 00:44:30.786, Speaker B: Yes, it's a different set of causes, and these things seem more relevant to the individual in question, at least in my opinion, rather than the SEC making a determination as to whether some particular meme coin is a security or not. I just don't want them to do that. But I do want our justice system to catch Scammers. Right. That would be nice.
00:44:30.888 - 00:45:08.090, Speaker A: So I asked Martin Screlly, what do you think the ODS are that the Department of justice picks this up, and he goes, 99%. If they have the goods on misappropriation, which I seem that they likely do. And he goes, it's likely that he cops. He settles to ten to 15 years in jail. If he goes to trial, 25 to 30 years is easily on the table. So I'm trusting Martin Screlly is not something that I would do. But he's got experience in this matter, having gone through this, and so he's saying that it's likely that eventually we will find Department of justice charges upon Richard Hart.
00:45:08.250 - 00:45:13.434, Speaker B: Meanwhile, David in another court. Do you remember Kyle Davies? The three errors? Capital co founder.
00:45:13.482 - 00:45:14.590, Speaker A: How could I forget?
00:45:15.090 - 00:45:27.854, Speaker B: Well, he said he apparently renounced his U. S. Citizenship, and so as a result of doing that, I'm no longer an American citizen. U. S. Courts have no jurisdiction over him. Is that how that works, David?
00:45:27.902 - 00:45:31.110, Speaker A: Can you do that? Can I just say I'm not a citizen?
00:45:32.010 - 00:45:35.762, Speaker B: If you break a law and you just I was never a citizen.
00:45:35.826 - 00:45:48.134, Speaker A: I actually listened to it. There's an old Planet Money episode about this. I used to love Planet money. It hasn't gotten so great lately, but they did an episode on people who just declared independence from citizenship so they wouldn't have to pay taxes.
00:45:48.262 - 00:45:48.698, Speaker B: Really?
00:45:48.784 - 00:46:00.560, Speaker A: Yeah. There's been like, a handful of court cases about this who people just say, I'm not a citizen anymore. And they're also living inside of the United States when they do this. And there's been a whole series of legal efforts about this. You can't do it.
00:46:01.330 - 00:46:02.334, Speaker B: It doesn't work that way.
00:46:02.372 - 00:46:28.280, Speaker A: It doesn't work like that. No, not at mean, he's just trying to abscond from participating in bankruptcy and all these things that he has to do. He is currently in Dubai, I believe, which is a non extradition country. But yeah, basically, Kyle Davies is saying that the United States courts can no longer tell him what to do because he declares to no longer be a citizen of the United States, which again, the United States says, you can't do that.
00:46:29.770 - 00:46:41.382, Speaker B: Well, certainly racking them up this year. David, you have a tweet here. Doe Kwan. Jailed in Montenegro, awaiting extradition. Alex Machinsky, charged by the Department of justice. Check. SBF, house arrest awaiting trial.
00:46:41.382 - 00:46:54.714, Speaker B: Check. Three Arrows Capital, permanently exiled from the US and all extradition countries. We'll see. Check. Richard Hart, sued by the SEC. Speculation of indictment. Why are you putting this checklist together, David?
00:46:54.842 - 00:47:18.790, Speaker A: This goes back to our permission to be bullish. Weekly roll up. Was that last week's? Permission to be bullish, man, we're cleaning up the industry. Like Richard Hart, sued by the SEC. I will say, fingers crossed that the Department of justice is not far 3 hours capital. They're not in jail, but they are quarantined as far away from the United States as possible. And all United States allied know the west.
00:47:18.790 - 00:47:33.206, Speaker A: They could go to jail. I will give like a two thirds a majority checkbox. But there's still left to be things to be done there. Same thing with SBF. He's under house arrest. He's awaiting trial. I'm assuming he's going to go to jail if I want to place faith in society.
00:47:33.206 - 00:47:41.998, Speaker A: Alex Mcinski, charged by the Department of justice. Doe Kwan is in Montenegro waiting extradition to the United States. Who else is there? We got him.
00:47:42.164 - 00:48:20.486, Speaker B: We got them all. You know, another question here is, does this act as a deterrent for the next cycle when a new scammer thinks there's easy prey out there in crypto? And I'm going to launch my token, I'm going to do my fraud, I'm going to do it this way. When they look back and they see, well, the previous cycle, look what happened to the scammers in chief last time justice was served. Does it act as a deterrent? Because if so, that is also bullish moving forward. It means hopefully we have less scammers entering the space, because works like the real world. Right. If you commit fraud and it's egregious, then justice will be served.
00:48:20.486 - 00:48:23.450, Speaker B: And I think that is bullish as well. Yeah.
00:48:23.520 - 00:48:27.646, Speaker A: Richard Hart got away for all of his shenanigans for way too long. Do you know there's a documentary being.
00:48:27.668 - 00:48:29.434, Speaker B: Made by him about Richard Hart?
00:48:29.482 - 00:48:30.682, Speaker A: About Richard Hart. About Hex?
00:48:30.746 - 00:48:31.118, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:31.204 - 00:48:36.706, Speaker A: August 4 and fifth. Wow, that's in two days. Oh, my God. The timing of this is great.
00:48:36.888 - 00:48:44.382, Speaker B: The documentary industry has to love this. Like Hollywood's got to love what happened in crypto. Know the last few years. So much material.
00:48:44.446 - 00:48:58.278, Speaker A: There are so many stories that are some of the craziest, sitcom y stories, ones that crypto Twitter does know about, ones that they don't, that I wish all of them could come to light, but there's too many of them.
00:48:58.444 - 00:49:03.818, Speaker B: We'll get a few, though. I think we'll get a few. David. Speaking of great content, what's coming up next?
00:49:03.904 - 00:49:23.066, Speaker A: Coming up next, ETH is getting an ETF. At least a futures ETF. Perhaps Binance could face fraud charges from the Department of justice. But what is the Department of justice waiting for? We'll talk about that two protocol birthdays this week. These birthdays keep on changing. Something turns eight, something else turns two. The world coin debate continues.
00:49:23.066 - 00:49:34.950, Speaker A: Some angles that we might have missed that we're going to cover. And also, $750,000,000 magically appears in Bitcoin Buy Pressure. Where'd it come from? I don't know, but we're going to get to all these stories and more. But first, a moment to talk about our fantastic sponsors that make this show possible.

Binance could face fraud charges from the Department of justice. The US DOJ officials are considering fraud charges against Binance, but they're concerned about the cost to consumers, according to people familiar with the matter reported by Semaphore.com. Federal prosecutors worry that if they indict Binance, it could cause a run on the exchange similar to the one that befelled the now bankrupt platform FTX, causing customers to lose money and potentially spurring a panic in the crypto market. Binance and its co founder CZ are already facing charges, of course, from the SEC, in addition to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. So the Department of justice wants to charge Binance with fraud, but they're not going to out of fear that it will cause an FTX style run on the bank, which is interesting.
00:52:05.510 - 00:52:08.850, Speaker B: Do you want to interpret that as bullish this week? David?
00:52:09.010 - 00:52:46.706, Speaker A: Okay, so either CZ and Binance are completely solvent, there's probably fraud, but there could be completely solvent. And they're not getting charged by the DOJ because the DOJ doesn't understand how to tell the difference between FTX and Finance, or Finance does have a hole in its balance sheet and the Department of justice does know something. And so this is a real concern. I'm going to cautiously go with the former because I kind of am grouping Finance and Tether FUD as the same thing. Like I've heard 10,000 tethers fuds. I've heard about 5000 finance fuds. But that is the news.
00:52:46.888 - 00:52:57.546, Speaker B: Yeah, who knows? It's always been our take. It's really hard to speculate, you just don't know. I guess my speculation, though, is there's no way this is as bad as SBF.
00:52:57.598 - 00:52:59.960, Speaker A: If there's something no way, there's no way.
00:53:00.410 - 00:53:08.540, Speaker B: But there might be something here. We don't know yet. But CZ's response, as usual, is what? Four? What does that mean? He tweeted this out four.
00:53:09.070 - 00:53:15.290, Speaker A: The morning of four is his shorthand for ignore FUD, fake news and attacks.
00:53:15.630 - 00:53:19.962, Speaker B: So nothing going on here. Just four. What would you expect him to say? Right?
00:53:20.016 - 00:53:21.980, Speaker A: Yeah. No matter what. Four.
00:53:22.850 - 00:53:35.638, Speaker B: David, did you know this though? China is actually Finance's largest market by far. 20% of their trading happens in China. And I thought crypto was illegal in China, but apparently it's the largest market for Finance.
00:53:35.754 - 00:53:48.758, Speaker A: You know, what I don't know is how does China feel about Binance? How does the Chinese government, what is their stance towards Binance? Do they care about it? Do they not care about it? Do they think it's good, think it's bad? I don't know the answer to that question.
00:53:48.924 - 00:54:14.254, Speaker B: I don't know the answer either. Although didn't Binance originate in China and then had to move friendly jurisdiction so it can't be super friendly? They're not in great terms, but this is crazy. Do you know, even if Finance totally pulled out of the US and Europe as a result of this, they'd still be the largest crypto platform in the world in terms of trading volume. That's how big Asia is.
00:54:14.292 - 00:54:24.186, Speaker A: It's pretty hard to state how big finance is. Finance is like 70% to 80% of all crypto trading volume. And coinbase is not 15. Maybe it is 15 ish.
00:54:24.378 - 00:54:32.322, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll watch that. We'll have to see how that evolves. David, it's birthday time. We've been teasing the entire episode. Whose birthday was it this week?
00:54:32.376 - 00:54:52.262, Speaker A: It's Ethereum's birthday. Ethereum turned eight. Ethereum turned eight on July 30. It's when the first proof of work block got minted by Ethereum in 2015. It's been a crazy, crazy journey. Here's left Terrace on the day of the and I'm pretty sure that's vitalik. On the day of the first block of Ethereum.
00:54:52.262 - 00:55:16.002, Speaker A: Yeah. Wow. Eight years. You know what's crazy? I remember coming into crypto and this is something I tell all newcomers into crypto. I came into crypto in 2017, two years, two and a half, two years after Ethereum got started. And I felt so late, so incredibly late. And now we're eight years into Ethereum, and people coming in, probably in 2021, probably feel the same.
00:55:16.002 - 00:55:18.286, Speaker A: Crypto has a way of making you feel late.
00:55:18.398 - 00:55:19.570, Speaker B: Eight years, man.
00:55:19.720 - 00:55:20.178, Speaker A: Look.
00:55:20.264 - 00:55:23.426, Speaker B: That's what, like, second grade? That's still pretty young.
00:55:23.528 - 00:55:26.578, Speaker A: Like just an eight year old. Yeah, it's very young. Yeah.
00:55:26.744 - 00:55:43.354, Speaker B: $400 billion in secured value. You add up all of the tokens, 3.6 billion in annualized profits thanks. Ultrasound money for that. And a total of 17.8 million blocks of uncensorable digital property. That's not too bad for an eight year old.
00:55:43.392 - 00:55:47.180, Speaker A: Not bad? It's not even better than me at eight years old, that's for sure.
00:55:47.790 - 00:55:53.934, Speaker B: Happy birthday, Ethereum. And maybe to celebrate, something's going on in the ether futures ETF race. What's this?
00:55:53.972 - 00:56:15.746, Speaker A: Yeah. So here's what Ether gets for turning eight. It gets an ETF futures. And so a handful of companies bitwise, van Eck, Pro shares, grayscale Volatility shares have all submitted an ETF futures for Ether. Six of them all at once. Interestingly enough, that's actually when you think.
00:56:15.768 - 00:56:18.582, Speaker B: About, know, eight years time to get here, that's not too bad.
00:56:18.636 - 00:56:19.222, Speaker A: Not too bad.
00:56:19.276 - 00:56:33.226, Speaker B: Like all the way from just a project in a white paper, somebody's head all the way to the CME regulated futures for a new type of digital commodity. That's pretty amazing. How much is Ether market cap right now?
00:56:33.248 - 00:56:36.380, Speaker A: 150,000,000,000, I think it's like 200 something.
00:56:37.150 - 00:56:40.502, Speaker B: It's like top top 50 assets worldwide.
00:56:40.566 - 00:56:43.660, Speaker A: Yeah. $220,000,000,000 market cap.
00:56:44.030 - 00:56:54.682, Speaker B: There you go. Doing great. That ETF might happen before the Bitcoin ETF, which might be interesting. Now. This is not a spot ETF. This is a futures ETF. And Bitcoin already has one of those, but this would be the first time.
00:56:54.682 - 00:57:12.466, Speaker B: So that's kind of cool news. And David, as usual, the Canadians are ahead. While Americans are fumbling around with the futures ETF for ETH, powerful Canadians will start staking ETH in their spot ETH ETF later this month. This is. Djed Spartan. Canadians already have a spot. ETH.
00:57:12.466 - 00:57:16.662, Speaker B: ETF. So what is America waiting for? Wow. I think that's the question.
00:57:16.716 - 00:57:18.874, Speaker A: I love how it's staked. That's so good.
00:57:18.992 - 00:57:19.274, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:19.312 - 00:57:30.940, Speaker A: So the ETF isn't ether, it's staked ether. Because, of course, it would be so much east staked. They're going to nuke our yields, bro.
00:57:31.630 - 00:57:39.760, Speaker B: They're totally going to goddamn Canadians. David that wasn't the only birthday, though. We also have to celebrate another baby birthday, a two year old.
00:57:40.370 - 00:58:04.918, Speaker A: Coming up. Coming up up this week is not yet. So we are on the cusp of EIP 1559 turning two. This was August, early. The first week of August 2021 is when ether started being burned for the very first time. As of now, as of two years, $10 billion of ether has been burned, which is just nuts. $9.6
00:58:04.918 - 00:58:09.826, Speaker A: thousand of ether burned every single minute for two years in a row.
00:58:10.018 - 00:58:21.450, Speaker B: David somebody brought this to our attention. So that is EIP 1559. So that's a different type of burn on kind of transaction fees. What would happen if we started burning mev?
00:58:22.030 - 00:58:27.066, Speaker A: Oh, you mean as in what is going to happen in the future when we put mev burn into the protocol?
00:58:27.178 - 00:58:31.534, Speaker B: I mean, that's a likely future trajectory. What are we looking at here?
00:58:31.572 - 00:58:36.030, Speaker A: We're looking at a chart of ether burn with and without Mev burn.
00:58:36.610 - 00:58:42.146, Speaker B: With mev burn, we would be what? Very deflationary this looks like.
00:58:42.248 - 00:59:03.042, Speaker A: So without Me V burn, we have been at net deflationary by negative 00:28 5%. With mev burn, we would have been negative half a percent. So we would be twice as deflationary with mev burn than we currently are. Almost twice. Almost twice.
00:59:03.186 - 00:59:05.494, Speaker B: Man, the furnace just keeps getting bigger.
00:59:05.622 - 00:59:14.000, Speaker A: Love it. And, Ryan, it's still a bear market. The bull market's ahead of us. Imagine the burn then.
00:59:15.090 - 00:59:32.766, Speaker B: This is a release from MetaMask. Attention, stakers. You can now stake your matic with MetaMask portfolio. Check it out. We talk a lot about MetaMask portfolio. MetaMask is actually a bankless sponsor, but this is really cool to see their user interface in the portfolio app. And you can actually stake your matic.
00:59:32.766 - 00:59:41.558, Speaker B: Tokens, you can stake Ether as well, but adding another verb to the MetaMask portfolio. Stake to stake. Yeah.
00:59:41.644 - 01:00:12.960, Speaker A: Okay. So this, I think, is a this is cool because MetaMask portfolio we're going to talk about with what I'm bullish on, and it has to do with setting up my battle station, my bull market battle station, which you should, too. Teaser. But MetaMask is now making it easy to stake for a layer two network. Do you think it stops at polygon? No, it doesn't just stop at polygon. All layer two networks, once they decentralize, once they become permissionlessly validated, you're going to be able to see that stake button. Am I allowed to do this? Yes.
01:00:12.960 - 01:00:38.200, Speaker A: Tomorrow, I don't think the announcement is out, but today Offchain Labs is announcing shared sequencing permissionless validation of Arbitrum. So you're going to be able to stake your ARB token and validate the Arbitrum chain. So Arbitrum stake optimism, stake ZkSync, stake any layer two that gets to the point of decentralizing the sequencer and allows for permissionless, validation. There's going to be a stake button, probably.
01:00:39.950 - 01:00:43.322, Speaker B: There definitely should be. And why stake for yield. Right?
01:00:43.376 - 01:00:57.070, Speaker A: For the yield bro. Yeah. Stake your ether for the layer one. Stake your layer two tokens for the layer two. Everyone pick your layer two that you think is going to get the most yield and press the stake button that's probably coming to MetaMask portfolio eventually.
01:00:57.730 - 01:01:12.210, Speaker B: So much cool stuff going on. This is another cool thing going on. This is an EIP that almost escaped my attention. EIP 6968. This is Kevin Owaki writing this. 68690.
01:01:12.360 - 01:01:15.060, Speaker A: Sorry. I was waiting for you to get that one.
01:01:17.210 - 01:01:19.010, Speaker B: Cut me not getting that joke.
01:01:19.090 - 01:01:21.800, Speaker A: No, don't do that. Keep it in. Keep it in.
01:01:23.690 - 01:01:42.334, Speaker B: Enables ecosystem chains. What is an ecosystem chain? It's a chain with contract secured revenue, CSR. That means the contract deployers can earn sequencer fees when their contracts consume gas. Okay, break this down for the layman. What is this EIP proposing? Yeah.
01:01:42.372 - 01:01:50.570, Speaker A: So this is remember Kanto? Remember the Kanto chain that had a brief moment of yeah, but no slam.
01:01:50.650 - 01:01:52.186, Speaker B: Don't slam David.
01:01:52.378 - 01:02:16.006, Speaker A: So Kanto couldn't help yourself. Kanto was all about a chain because of CSR contract secured revenue. So if you built a chain, a contract on Kanto, you would get fees at any time. As a developer, you would get fees anytime that somebody use your contract is like a sustainability mechanism. So this has, like, all things, anything that's been put into a chain is now an EIP for ethereum. This is the way that it goes. This is never mind.
01:02:16.006 - 01:02:38.058, Speaker A: EIP 6968 is contract secured revenue for layer two. So this is meant to be for layer two specifically. And so any layer two can accept its EIP to create a contract secured revenue primitive on top of their layer two. And so it's an incentive to get devs. It pays devs. Like, if you are a dev and you make a contract on a layer two and people use your contract, you get money. So it's a financing mechanism.
01:02:38.154 - 01:03:03.538, Speaker B: It's so huge. I think this is massive. I think it's incredibly bullish. So what this means is basically like, if you create a kind of like a public good, you don't have a monetization mechanism. Like, let's say you create a very cool stablecoin on a layer two that starts to accrue a lot of value, a lot of transactions around it. You actually get paid sequencer fees in order to do that. It's a whole new business model, I think, on top of layer twos.
01:03:03.538 - 01:03:04.854, Speaker B: And that's what's exciting here. Yeah.
01:03:04.892 - 01:03:49.454, Speaker A: There's been a lot of debate about contract secured revenues and the economic models behind it, and whether they're good or sustainable or not. We haven't seen them actually meaningfully get adoption. And perhaps there's good reasons for that. Maybe we haven't seen enough experimentation, but now we are seeing this experimentation move to the layer twos. Speaking of moving to layer twos, the temperature check for cello, this is the temp check that of the cello. Layer one, the governance checks like, hey, do we want to move to a layer 01:02? Hundred percent to zero? Okay, not completely. 00:50 6 million to 632 call that 100 to zero is officially going to be a layer two.
01:03:49.454 - 01:03:50.120, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:50.730 - 01:04:06.218, Speaker B: We spent a lot of time last week talking about World coins. I think there's just a couple of things to tie off. The first is this tweet thread from Eric wall. It's actually almost like a Twitter post these days. It's pretty long, so we probably can't read all of it, david but what's the TLDR here?
01:04:06.304 - 01:04:39.378, Speaker A: Eric Wall does a fantastic job just unpacking technical subjects for laymen. And so it's simply too long. It's almost 1000 words, I'd say, so I can't read it. It would take five to ten minutes, but there's a link in the show notes to go read this tweet thread. I think if you want to understand the strengths and weaknesses of WorldCoin and specifically where those weaknesses are and why this thing might not work, this Tweet thread is for you. He just unpacks all the nuances. Very, very if I feel actually complete on the coin conversation because of this Tweet thread.
01:04:39.378 - 01:04:41.990, Speaker A: This is just such a weird awkward photo of Sam Altman.
01:04:42.570 - 01:04:46.582, Speaker B: This is a mid journey photo, David. There's no way this is real. There's just no way.
01:04:46.636 - 01:05:07.050, Speaker A: It's gotta be. It's gotta be. Yeah, you're right. A human would not know not to post. Like so that's so that's the call to action. If you want to read this Tweet thread, I highly recommend it. Also this week I saw a tweet here that Ryan's got pulled up from Martin Coppelman, who's also a creator of a different decentralized identity protocol.
01:05:07.050 - 01:05:54.702, Speaker A: And so he was retweeting this tweet that did some address analysis from WorldCoin addresses. So they've detected in this tweet, in this image, three different clusters of WorldCoin addresses that all appear to converge down to one address. And so it looks like 130 individual addresses actually are just three people socket. Exactly. So it has been civil attacked. And so if you read the Eric Well Twitter thread, X thread, basically the TLDR is like, yeah, every single WorldCoin account is 100% verifiable a unique pair of eyeballs. That doesn't mean that it is in the hands of a unique person.
01:05:54.702 - 01:06:12.020, Speaker A: And this is what we are seeing here today. So the whole premise of WorldCoin, and even anyone giving legitimacy to WorldCoin, which included me, is based on the fact that they can actually produce civil resistance. And if they can't do it, then this thing is worth zero.
01:06:14.150 - 01:06:20.360, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the base requirement for decentralized identity is you have to be civil resistant. If you're not, then the solution just doesn't work.
01:06:21.210 - 01:06:49.760, Speaker A: Just because you can prove unique eyeballs does not mean you can prove unique humans. And so this is the weakness that seems to be appearing with the world coin with the world Coin thing. Finance received a deposit address of a bunch of WorldCoin tokens from 150 different wallets within 48 hours after launch. Profiting about $10,000. So this is hey, that UBI WorldCoin distribution. Somebody is farming that. Many people are farming that, and they're profiting from it, which breaks the whole system.
01:06:50.130 - 01:07:03.374, Speaker B: You got to fix that if you're going to do this. Well, MicroStrategy david they're continuing to buy Bitcoin. MicroStrategy is about to pump another, what, $750,000,000 into Bitcoin.
01:07:03.502 - 01:07:11.286, Speaker A: Dude, thin air, man. They're minting MicroStrategy shares out of thin air just to buy bitcoin. And it's working.
01:07:11.468 - 01:07:41.198, Speaker B: I totally knew this would work. Sailor is channeling demand for Bitcoin ETF into demand for MicroStrategy shares. He's printing infinite MicroStrategy shares and buying finite bitcoin. Central banks and governments should take note. Maybe they're the next ones to do this is kind of the point I was looking at, like an old ETrade account I have, and there's a boomer. There's a crypto section in ETrade. And you know what they recommend because you can't actually buy a spot ETF, of course, the Grayscale products, that kind of thing.
01:07:41.198 - 01:07:52.180, Speaker B: Also, MicroStrategy crypto exposure in your E trade account. Then buy MicroStrategy stock. And they're not wrong. But it's so messed up.
01:07:53.830 - 01:08:30.318, Speaker A: I'm just going to chalk that up to TradFi failings. Last bit of news here from DCG says it's close to reaching an agreement on its Genesis Chapter Eleven bankruptcy. So, in a letter to investors, DCG says, after a month of tireless negotiations led by DCG leadership, we are close to reaching an agreement in principle to resolve the claims in the Grayscale Chapter Eleven cases. So we expect to bring these cases to a close soon. So maybe the Grayscale excuse me, the DCG story is coming to a close here, which is just around the mark the time for the bull market to start. So that makes sense.
01:08:30.404 - 01:08:32.474, Speaker B: Yeah. And getting that story closed would be bullish.
01:08:32.602 - 01:08:34.106, Speaker A: David damn straight.
01:08:34.138 - 01:08:53.922, Speaker B: We got some bullish questions coming at us. Number one will op tokens accrue value. How does base fit in? That's a question from a bankless listener. Also, are L two S as safe as ethereum? We'll get into that. And there's also a pretty hot Vitalik take this week on the state of crypto right now, and it's bullish. Of course, the theme of this episode.
01:08:53.986 - 01:08:55.842, Speaker A: Would Vitalik say that it's bullish?
01:08:55.986 - 01:09:04.746, Speaker B: I don't know. I'm putting words in his mouth. But, guys, we will be right back with all of that just after we thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:09:04.848 - 01:10:08.298, Speaker A: Mantle, formerly known as Bitdao, is the first Dowled Web Three ecosystem, all built on top of Mantle's first core product, the Mantle Network, a brand new high performance ethereum layer Two built using the Op stack, but uses Eigen layer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer One. Not only does this reduce Mantle network's gas fees by 80%, but it also reduces gas fee volatility, providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications. The Mantle Treasury is one of the biggest Dow owned Treasuries, which is seeding an ecosystem of projects from all around the Web Three space for Mantle. Mantle already has subcommunities from around web Three onboarded like Game Seven for Web Three gaming and buybit for TVL and Liquidity and Onram. So if you want to build on the Mantle network, mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone based funding to promising projects that help expand, secure and decentralize Mantle. If you want to get started working with the first Dowled Layer Two ecosystem, check out Mantle at Mantle XYZ and follow them on Twitter at Zero xmantle. Hiring people worldwide, paying them in crypto, providing them access to benefits it all's so complex.
01:10:08.298 - 01:10:46.410, Speaker A: But it doesn't have to be complying with labor laws, payroll rules, tax obligations, and crypto regulations. In every country that you employ, someone is difficult, time consuming, manual and costly, and it's drawing more and more attention from regulators and governments. But there is good news. Toku is here. Toku is the first employment and compensation platform for the crypto industry that makes this easy. Toku helps you hire employees or contractors and pay them in fiat or crypto, legally compliantly and with all the taxes handled in over 100 different jurisdictions. So whether you're an early stage company with just a team of two, or you're an enterprise with 200, toku has a solution that meets your needs.
01:10:46.410 - 01:10:59.374, Speaker A: Toku is already working with the leading companies in the Space Protocol Labs, Hadera, Gitcoin and many more. So transform your employment and token payroll operations with Toku. You can reach out to Toku@toku.com Bankless or click the link in the Show.
01:10:59.412 - 01:11:15.762, Speaker B: Notes question from Keifu. I think I've heard of value accrual to Op from the main Op chain via Fees and Mev, but will there be any value accrual from other Op chains like Base to the Op Token itself? How is a layer two token like Op going to accrue Value?
01:11:15.816 - 01:11:42.982, Speaker A: David yeah, so this is a really good question. I think from the early days of Base main net launch, they said that they committed that they a want to be a part of the Op collective because they used the Op stack chain to create Base. And being a part of the Op Collective means that you need to contribute some of your sequencer fees of your layer Two towards the Op Collective to help finance the retroactive public goods funding effort. Basically put the money in the Op collective.
01:11:43.046 - 01:11:44.822, Speaker B: It's like a tax on revenue kind of thing.
01:11:44.896 - 01:12:18.226, Speaker A: I think the number is 15%. Ten to 15% I think is right. Like I said earlier in the episode. We are doing an episode with Ben Jones and Jesse from Base about the law of Chains, which is how this standard is going to be set. And if you are an Op stock chain and you want to be a part of this super chain, you must abide by the law of chains, which assures some level of block space, quality and assurances. And also what does it mean to be a part of the Op collective? And that's probably where a certain number again, I think the number is 15%, but it's probably up to governance anyways.
01:12:18.338 - 01:12:20.946, Speaker B: That's kind of cool. It's like a confederation of chains.
01:12:21.058 - 01:12:23.106, Speaker A: It's a union. Yeah, it's a union of chains.
01:12:23.218 - 01:12:27.218, Speaker B: You can choose to be a part of it or not, but if you do choose to be a part of it, you have to pay your taxes.
01:12:27.314 - 01:12:57.220, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly right. So 15% of base revenue that we were talking about earlier goes to the optimism collective, the Zora chain 15% WorldCoin. If that is a thing that lasts 15%, I think, again, do your own research. If the 15% is the correct number, I will ask Ben and Jesse what that number is when we do the episode with them. But I think that number is public somewhere that was announced way back when with the base chain. Anyways, we will get those details. So that's how this works.
01:12:57.220 - 01:13:08.610, Speaker A: This is the model for the Op stack chains. If you want to be a part of the superchain, if you want the composability, if you want the network effects of optimism, you got to pay the tax to the optimism collective.
01:13:08.690 - 01:13:29.438, Speaker B: Here's a question from kiwidog four. Once we have ZK roll ups with permissionless sequencers and trustless bridges, will L2 S have basically the same security guarantees as L One? This has also been a Twitter debate recently that I've heard. So the question of will layer twos have the same security guarantees as their Layer One? What's your take?
01:13:29.444 - 01:14:17.022, Speaker A: I think the operative word is will Layer twos have basically the same security guarantees as layer One? And yes, basically they will. There will always be some nuances, there will always be some smart contract risks because Layer twos are smart contracts, but with permissionless sequencers, trustless bridges, all of the things that decentralize layer two chains also with some time, some lindy, layer Twos will give you basically the same security guarantees as layer ones. And that is why we are doing the Layer two roadmap. That's why Ethereum is a roll up centric roadmap because we have found ways to make scalable chains have the same security guarantees as the layer ones. It's always been part of the vision. And so I don't even necessarily think ZK Roll Ups will have a monopoly on this. It's just they have a little bit faster path there.
01:14:17.022 - 01:14:29.966, Speaker A: Optimistic roll ups will also have the same security guarantees. But that is the layer two vision. The Layer One and the layer twos, those lines blur once we get to permissionless, sequencers, trustless provisions, et cetera, et cetera.
01:14:29.998 - 01:14:54.166, Speaker B: Yeah, so a couple thoughts on that or follow up. addending what you just said. It's important to realize none of the chains are there today. All right, so you can see this on layer two beats what I have in front of us. A lot of them are at stage zero, doesn't offer that full decentralization or stage one, which is kind of training wheels they need to get to stage two. And that's where everything is. Permissionless.
01:14:54.166 - 01:15:25.650, Speaker B: All the sequencers are completely whitelisted, upgrades are handled correctly. Those are the caveats. And we're certainly not there yet with layer twos. The other thing I'll say is there is this dependency on the trustless bridge from ethereum to A. Layer two on that working. So there's some smart contract code there, of course, and smart contract code can have bugs, so there's that dependency as well. But for all intents and purposes, it's almost the same security guarantees as the layer two.
01:15:25.650 - 01:15:32.050, Speaker B: Once we get to this stage two level across these roll ups.
01:15:32.210 - 01:15:37.222, Speaker A: Remember when layer two only had layer two b, only had like four or five layer twos on them?
01:15:37.356 - 01:15:38.326, Speaker B: Those are the days.
01:15:38.428 - 01:15:38.886, Speaker A: Scroll down.
01:15:38.908 - 01:15:39.514, Speaker B: How far is it?
01:15:39.552 - 01:15:44.566, Speaker A: Oh my God, it keeps on going. 2929-2929. Layer twos.
01:15:44.598 - 01:15:46.010, Speaker B: We just question started, David.
01:15:46.910 - 01:15:54.080, Speaker A: Once ether hits all time highs, how many layer twos are going to be on layer two B? Question for you.
01:15:54.770 - 01:16:00.750, Speaker B: Make a prediction. Ether all time highs. You mean the summit amount? What's all time highs? You're talking about this cycle?
01:16:01.570 - 01:16:13.890, Speaker A: $4,900 for ether once ether breaks all time highs. Matterhorn elevations hitting the matterhorn. Yeah. How many layer twos will be on layer two beat?
01:16:16.150 - 01:16:31.660, Speaker B: I'm going to guess 900. Sorry, that's my matterhorn number. Oh, that's your matterhorn. Okay, maybe all time high. I'll say 300. Okay, back.
01:16:34.270 - 01:16:40.022, Speaker A: I was going to go with 100, but that seems a little low. Can I get a range?
01:16:40.086 - 01:16:41.242, Speaker B: I'm more bullish than you.
01:16:41.296 - 01:16:45.838, Speaker A: 100 to 150. Layer twos on layer two beat. When ether breaks all time high.
01:16:45.924 - 01:16:51.854, Speaker B: All right, it's on. The BET's on. David. Some takes this week. This one from Vance Spencer. What's he saying?
01:16:51.972 - 01:17:17.938, Speaker A: Vance Spencer says it's important to internalize blue chip DFI or anything was a meme last cycle. Nobody was generating sustainable cash flows and to be honest, the industry was a shit show. Yeah, kind of was launching a successful protocol and 15 VCs funded forks would come in with tokens and vampire attack. You. This cycle is different. Real sustainable cash flows with paths to scale, large markets. All competitors now dead or thoroughly discouraged.
01:17:17.938 - 01:17:55.140, Speaker A: No VC money to fund. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th place consolidation, blue chippery. I think what Vance is saying is we're off of the shitcoin roller coaster and we are focusing on quality and fees. That was one of my big takeaways from ECC is like the maturation and verticalization of so many DFI protocols. And this is the take that Cain Warwick gave me, ECC 2022 a year ago. We are in now a bull market for fees. I mean, it turns out we were going through a bear market, actually, but ethereum people, we're always just like a couple of years ahead of the curve, and our takes are just a couple of years too early.
01:17:55.140 - 01:18:03.110, Speaker A: But we're witnessing layers, protocols that capture cash, fees, basically revenue.
01:18:03.690 - 01:18:08.322, Speaker B: Now, they don't flow to the governance token yet, though, right? Like, Uniswap doesn't have its fee switch.
01:18:08.466 - 01:18:10.538, Speaker A: Well, it has a fee switch. It's just not on.
01:18:10.624 - 01:18:13.100, Speaker B: It's not on. Yeah, turn it on.
01:18:13.870 - 01:18:41.618, Speaker A: He continues, and Vance says, we figured out where aggregation points are and who the long term incumbents in DeFi will be. We figured out some protocols are features and likely to be rolled into larger incumbents. Exactly what I was saying. If you squint a little bit, you can see the fang of DeFi is assembling. The fang of DeFi, which Vance is saying is smell. S-M-E-L-L-I don't actually know if he's actually articulated which ones they are. S is probably what they start with, though.
01:18:41.618 - 01:18:51.654, Speaker A: Yeah. S is synthetics. M is maker. I don't know what E is for people. L is Lido. And the other one, the second L is I don't know.
01:18:51.772 - 01:18:55.334, Speaker B: Well, for people who aren't familiar with Fang, though, these are the tech companies, right?
01:18:55.372 - 01:18:59.046, Speaker A: Like, we got Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google.
01:18:59.228 - 01:18:59.766, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:18:59.868 - 01:19:03.370, Speaker A: Does Netflix still belong to Be There? I don't know if Netflix belongs to Be There anymore.
01:19:04.030 - 01:19:12.060, Speaker B: Is the other a alphabet or is that Apple question? Anyway, it's up for debate. Maybe it's well, who else would the.
01:19:12.590 - 01:19:16.670, Speaker A: Apple it's Apple and oh, yeah. Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google.
01:19:16.820 - 01:19:27.294, Speaker B: We figured it out live. Look at that. Look at us, David. This is a tweet from my co host. Here a take for the week, maybe. Can you feel it? The bull market started. I feel it, David.
01:19:27.342 - 01:19:33.214, Speaker A: I'm hitting like, I'm hitting retweet the comments. Not everyone feels it in the comments.
01:19:33.262 - 01:19:33.986, Speaker B: Oh, really? Yeah.
01:19:34.008 - 01:19:35.714, Speaker A: Not everyone feels it. I feel it.
01:19:35.832 - 01:19:40.820, Speaker B: Anthony feels it. No, he says the bull market never left.
01:19:43.690 - 01:19:45.846, Speaker A: It doesn't count when you say you're bullish every single day.
01:19:45.948 - 01:19:50.220, Speaker B: Can you feel it? The crab market keeps crabing. That's a reply. Maybe it's just a crab market.
01:19:51.070 - 01:19:53.500, Speaker A: We have doubled in market cap over the last seven months.
01:19:54.110 - 01:19:54.940, Speaker B: All right.
01:19:56.670 - 01:19:57.962, Speaker A: I'm claiming the bull market.
01:19:58.016 - 01:19:59.798, Speaker B: Has started is what I'm going to matterhorn.
01:19:59.894 - 01:20:01.258, Speaker A: I think you can feel it, yeah.
01:20:01.344 - 01:20:03.130, Speaker B: What are you bullish on this week, David?
01:20:03.550 - 01:20:16.114, Speaker A: Well, what I was bullish on last week was that, hey, I'm just bullish, which is also what I'm bullish on this week. I'm just bullish. But I will tell you, I'm doing something about it now. I'm setting up my battle station, my bull market. Battle station. And so what does that mean?
01:20:16.232 - 01:20:18.370, Speaker B: Yeah. What does that mean? That sounds awesome.
01:20:18.520 - 01:20:54.538, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, I bought a cheap little computer to do all my signing, which is not my work computer. So I'm taking my signing and having a cheap little computer that is my crypto signing computer. I recommend this for anyone who downloads files or works on their computers like me. And so I'm getting a dedicated signing computer and also just setting up all of the websites and infrastructure that once was a skill which got rusty in the bear market because appetites for tokens are gone in the bear market. So this is like Dexscreener.com for people that want to stay ahead of the game on DEXes.
01:20:54.538 - 01:21:49.694, Speaker A: And just making sure that you have your situation prepped to make moves and make moves quickly during the bull market. Because if you want to make money in the bull market, you need to be pressing buttons. You need to be pressing send transaction, you need to be approving transactions, you need to be doing things. And so I think it would behoove everyone to get their wallets in order, make sure that they're I've had problems with my web browser attachments, my extensions, getting those fixed, making sure that you are moments away from making a move if you need to make a move, and just setting up your setup so you can know the state of your things. Perhaps MetaMask portfolios for you sponsor. But just like setting up your Battle Station, making sure that you're ready to go and collecting data and being able to purview the DeFi landscape. Because I'm saying we are in the first out of a nine inning game and here we are.
01:21:49.812 - 01:22:06.034, Speaker B: That's cool. David, the crypto battle Station is a great idea. Bull market battle Station is a great idea. I will also say, and just to take know the traditional Ryan Boring type approach here is you also don't have to do that.
01:22:06.072 - 01:22:09.526, Speaker A: This is a game that you choose to enter. You do not have to play the.
01:22:09.548 - 01:22:30.826, Speaker B: Game that you can just choose to play if you're kind of like just tired right now. Is dollar cost average in I'll just counter this with the point of like the game that David's playing. I know because I know David, he's not playing with his entire stack. So he's got a portion kind of set aside. Right. He's playing this game.
01:22:30.848 - 01:22:38.478, Speaker A: Right, david, the Staking stack, that is a different game. One could play the Staking game, which is a different game to play.
01:22:38.644 - 01:23:15.658, Speaker B: Yes. And I just want to so that you don't hear from what David just said, all right, I got my bull market, Battle station, I'm going all in with all of my assets on whatever kind of pumping, whatever I'm feeling good about in this bull cycle, I'm going to make it all back. This bull cycle. I will just say I think that boredom has stolen more money from crypto investors than Sam Begman freed the worst mistakes I've made in crypto have been because I was bored and I wanted to click buttons when I shouldn't have. Sometimes you have to click those buttons. Sometimes you have to be cautious and can just dollar cost average it. So the way to manage this in your mind is just partition things.
01:23:15.744 - 01:23:16.380, Speaker A: Yes.
01:23:17.230 - 01:23:29.790, Speaker B: Have your Staking game that you're playing, your accumulation game, your kind of like maybe your ETH game, and then have another game on the side that you play and separate those interests, separate those accounts and separate them in your mind too.
01:23:29.860 - 01:23:51.186, Speaker A: I think it is worth noting that there are different games to play. The game that I'm talking about, I'm setting up my bull market. Battle Station is the game that there was two main two, yeah, two big victories that I had in terms of financial gain during last bull market. One was WiFi at like $2,000 and Loot at two. Ether. Yeah. Oh, you sold loot?
01:23:51.218 - 01:23:52.054, Speaker B: That was a good idea.
01:23:52.172 - 01:24:13.146, Speaker A: I did sell loot. Not at the perfect top, but I definitely made money. I definitely made money on Loot. And WiFi wasn't so fast, but it was still pretty fast and you needed to be ready and understand things and make your move. Loot was extremely fast. And that's the game that I'm talking about is the phenomenon comes and you press buy early and you just ride it and it's kind of a gamble. Loot was absolutely a gamble.
01:24:13.146 - 01:24:16.554, Speaker A: Like it was a fucking text on a JPEG. But that's the game that I'm referencing.
01:24:16.602 - 01:24:18.026, Speaker B: And it did not work out long term.
01:24:18.058 - 01:24:39.586, Speaker A: It did not work out long term. It worked out for the short term. For people who sold. There's other games to play. There is the self staking at home optimization game where Ethereum yield is not homogeneous. You, if you play the game well, can increase your yields just by staking. And so you're not like perusing Twitter.
01:24:39.586 - 01:24:56.022, Speaker A: You're not making gambles, you are just refining your system. I can't play that game nearly as well because I leave and go away from home, and so I can't play that game nearly as well. But that is a very valid game to play as well. So figure out what game you want to play and then set up your Battle Station for that.
01:24:56.156 - 01:25:24.802, Speaker B: Another way to say that, and this is kind of classic bankless, is as you enter crypto, choose your character. Start like your Diablo account, some RPG you're going to play, what are you going to be? A necromancer barbarian. What are you going to be? Right, Amazon. All right, well, so David is doing this hybrid character class of like, Settler Trader, but he has a separation of those things and you have to choose your character class. You can't jump from character class to character class or you'll get beat up in this market. There you go.
01:25:24.856 - 01:25:28.854, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, so I've got my battle station. Set up. Ryan, what are you bullish on? What's your battle station look like?
01:25:28.892 - 01:26:04.110, Speaker B: You know what? Well, it's not exactly a battle station, David, but I will tell you what I'm bullish on this week. I am bullish on founders that stayed, the founders, the protocol, the DeFi founders in particular that did not orphan their projects early. I feel like that happened with a lot of DeFi projects as they got orphaned. Kind of the founders left, the parents left before they could grow into functional adults. But there are a number of founders who stayed, and I'm very bullish on those founders, and as a result, I'm bullish on those projects too. Synthetix Kane is one. He kind of left, but now he's back a little bit.
01:26:04.260 - 01:26:08.882, Speaker A: He left with good reason to decentralize the protocol, and then he came back also with good reason.
01:26:09.016 - 01:26:29.218, Speaker B: Yes. Aave is another Astani uniswap. Hayden Adams is still there. There's a whole list that this Twitter thread pumped out. DeFi dad talks about the founder of Curve, the founder of FRAX, the founder of Instadap, the founders of Balancer, liquidity Nexus. All of these founders stayed. And I just want to give a big shout out to the founders who stayed.
01:26:29.218 - 01:26:49.582, Speaker B: They are settlers, not tourists. And, yeah, I think we have the potential to build the fangs of DFI, as Vance was saying, and it's going to be done not over one cycle, but over multiple cycles. And so big shout out to all of the founders who have just dug deep and had the grit to actually stay through these cycles. I think the results will show for themselves.
01:26:49.716 - 01:27:19.798, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. And also I will also say that maker Dow, not just Rune, not just Rune Christensen, but there's a number of very early MakerDAO OGS who are still working on MakerDAO and then also have gone off to found other projects. And so not to say that, hey, you must stick with your first project and your first baby until the end of time. Just staying in Crypto bankless was not my first job, so sticking around generally is always the way to wealth and success.
01:27:19.964 - 01:27:25.180, Speaker B: I totally agree. You know what, David? We missed the vitalik take. We did miss we promised that. We teased it okay.
01:27:25.550 - 01:27:57.880, Speaker A: This isn't a tweet. This is just what we were talking to Vitalik about privately, where he says, I feel like cryptoculture might actually be the best that it's ever been in 2023. People's biggest complaints, amazingly, seems to be that, quote, there's too much focus on infrastructure, which, from the point of view of almost any other sociopolitical system in the world today, sounds like not a complaint, but a success story. It's honestly really heartening to hear Vitalik say that cryptoculture is in the best place that it's been because cryptoculture has not always been so great.
01:28:01.850 - 01:28:17.770, Speaker B: We spent some of this episode talking about the Bald Token and Richard Schuyler. So, yeah, it feels good when vitalik says it. What do you think about this point? That it's actually I'll use the words bullish. Vitalik wouldn't use these words. The focus on infrastructure is actually bullish, though.
01:28:17.840 - 01:28:37.746, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I think he's saying that he's comparing this from socioculturally. He's saying, like, yeah, this is compared to governments and cities and organization planners like crypto. We're complaining that everyone's building infrastructure where the rest of the world generally has failing infrastructure. At least the United States says, can.
01:28:37.768 - 01:28:38.782, Speaker B: We get more infrastructure?
01:28:38.846 - 01:28:51.390, Speaker A: Right? And so I think even if we're, like, over indexing on infrastructure, good, because crypto is supposed to last for generations upon generations. That's a good thing that we're over indexing on infrastructure. So, bullish.
01:28:51.550 - 01:28:52.566, Speaker B: You ready for meme of the week?
01:28:52.588 - 01:28:53.926, Speaker A: David, I am ready for meme of the week.
01:28:53.948 - 01:28:59.030, Speaker B: Yeah, here it is. I think this is you when you came back down from the mountain. What are we looking at?
01:28:59.100 - 01:29:25.490, Speaker A: Okay, so this is Pseudo Theos from the scroll team. So this is the meme of the guy coming back into the room with pizza boxes, and the quote is me taking a day off of crypto. This is how I felt because I left to climb the Matterhorn Sunday morning, and then I came back and all of this was happening. Viper's zero day bug curve exploit ave stables depegging base, one way bridges into ball tokens. This all happened into, like, not even in 24 hours. This is 12 hours. All of that happened.
01:29:25.490 - 01:29:26.734, Speaker A: That was insane.
01:29:26.862 - 01:29:44.966, Speaker B: He comes back in the apartment with pizza boxes, and it's just absolutely chaos there's fight. That's what it feels like to be in crypto for sure. That's why you can't take a day off. We hope you don't take a week off the weekly roll up, because our job is to absorb all of this chaos and then relay the signal to.
01:29:44.988 - 01:29:47.000, Speaker A: You, our mental health. Hope you enjoyed it.
01:29:48.010 - 01:29:59.426, Speaker B: Written disclaimers got to end with this. Of course, none of this has been financial advice. Crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.
01:29:59.426 - 01:29:59.860, Speaker B: Thanks a lot.
