00:00:00.090 - 00:00:17.262, Speaker A: There's just the bridge risk. People understate the bridge risk, and events like this kind of highlight what a mistake it is to understate the bridge risk. Bankless nation. Happy first week of August, David, it's Friday morning. What time is it?
00:00:17.316 - 00:00:29.474, Speaker B: Oh, Ryan. It's a Friday bankless weekly roll up time where we cover the entire week of news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere into the frontier nonetheless.
00:00:29.602 - 00:00:43.100, Speaker A: Into the frontier. That's right. And I got to remind you, enjoy this roll up with a cup of coffee. David, you said you got a coffee upgrade earlier this week, and I forgot to ask you about it. So how's coffee at the apartment in New York?
00:00:43.470 - 00:00:47.626, Speaker B: Coffee is a tough thing. I was making my coffee with an aeropress, which I love.
00:00:47.808 - 00:00:50.102, Speaker A: That is good. But really consuming.
00:00:50.166 - 00:01:05.120, Speaker B: It's a little time consuming. It's a little laborious. It's really meant for camping or just like, things when you're in a pinch. So I got a chemx, which is definitely, like a standard. It's not nothing special, but just like that drip chemx. Yeah, it's a pour over. Yeah.
00:01:05.120 - 00:01:16.290, Speaker B: More suited to the particular ground that I have and the kettle that I have. So definitely got an upgrade, but still lots of work to be done on my coffee setup. So looking forward to that.
00:01:16.360 - 00:01:30.922, Speaker A: I'm glad you're in better shape, and I know it's a continuous improvement. Just, Dave's got to remind you, just like all things or becomes a beverage. All right, we're not talking about coffee today. We're talking about crypto. And a lot happened, as usual. What's the first thing we're going to cover today?
00:01:31.056 - 00:01:56.510, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a bad week for crypto this week. Some exploits, another bridge hack. So reset the clock on that 10 days since our last accident, Nomad was hacked for almost $200 million on a smart contract exploit. So we'll go into how that happened because it's very unique, actually. First of its kind of a hack. And so we'll talk about that and kind of what it means for the whole multilayer one thesis.
00:01:56.670 - 00:02:20.358, Speaker A: Speaking of hacks, all right, almost 10,000 salana wallets were just randomly drained this week as well. That's not supposed to happen. And a lot of the week was spent with people trying to figure out how in the world this happened. So we're going to talk a little bit about that and the conclusion of what happened with this wallet hack, pretty alarming. What's the other thing we're going to cover.
00:02:20.444 - 00:02:48.798, Speaker B: And lastly, there's just been a bunch of hubbub, a bunch of drama about the ETH POW chain, the ETH proof of work chain that is probably going to come out of the fork once we merge. We're going to leave a proof of work chain behind. And so some people are descending upon that proof of work chain as a shelling point. Are you listener about to get some free Eth Pow pow eth? Please. Well, personally, I wouldn't get your hopes up. We'll talk about that.
00:02:48.884 - 00:03:26.810, Speaker A: I don't know. I'm a little more bullish on it, so we'll definitely talk about that. And of course, if you like the weekly roll up, you like bankless content, make sure you like subscribe, rate and review. If you are listening to this on a podcast channel, on Spotify especially, you can now get this in video format, which is always better in video, seeing faces along with the words, David, before we get into it, got to relay a quick message from our friends and sponsors at Ford. Did you know in 2021, that was just last year? Speaking of hacks, we were talking about hacks in the intro. There's $2.3 billion in crypto web, three related hacks.
00:03:26.810 - 00:03:31.214, Speaker A: And Forda has something to help with this. What is Forda doing?
00:03:31.252 - 00:04:37.750, Speaker B: David Forda is a live smart contract monitoring service. And so what they do is they monitor the mempool. And so there's plenty of things that you need to do as a smart contract dev, like go through audits, do formal verification, but there's still plenty of stuff you can also do while your smart contracts are live in the wild, live in production, and there are types of transactions that can be detected that are incoming, that are known to be like malicious, like they drain treasuries, they hack bridges, they mess with your governance or whatever. And so Forda, there's that video game that way back when in the 90s, like this meteor game where the meteors were coming in and they would got to shoot them before they hit the earth, right? So they would zap the incoming meteors. This is what Forda does for incoming malicious transactions. And so you can identify a set of transactions that if they do this, then you know they're malicious and Forda will zap them before they get into your smart contract. And so there's over 36 billion in TVL monitored by Forda's decentralized network, including protocols and applications like DydX, compound balancer maker Lido Yuma.
00:04:37.750 - 00:04:51.854, Speaker B: Not nomad. Not nomad. Maybe they could use Forda yeah. There's a link in the show notes. If you are interested in learning more about getting a smart contract, exploit Zapper on your squad.
00:04:52.002 - 00:05:02.922, Speaker A: One thing I know is you don't want to find out that your smart contract has been hacked on Twitter. You want to receive some alert and have a defense system set up. So Forda monitoring is there for that.
00:05:02.976 - 00:05:07.338, Speaker B: And, of course, Forda. Thank you for sponsoring this message, Ryan. Shall we get into markets?
00:05:07.434 - 00:05:10.666, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it. What's bitcoin showing us this week? I'm going to show some charts.
00:05:10.778 - 00:05:26.034, Speaker B: Yeah, got some new charts on the screen. Bitcoin. We are down a whopping, .9% which I would consider flat. I would consider that flat on the week. Started the week at $23,100, ending the week at $22,900. Flat on the week.
00:05:26.034 - 00:05:26.626, Speaker B: Flat on the week.
00:05:26.648 - 00:05:31.430, Speaker A: Just flat on the week. Okay. Neither up nor down. Just tepid. Just flat. How about eth? Same thing?
00:05:31.500 - 00:05:41.386, Speaker B: Yeah. Start of the week at 1640, ending the week at 1620, down 1.5%. Again, I would just consider that flat. That is a flat week.
00:05:41.488 - 00:05:45.578, Speaker A: All right, David, how about the ETH bitcoin ratio? What's that looking like on the week?
00:05:45.664 - 00:05:52.702, Speaker B: Yeah, super flat on the week. Down half of a percent at 0707. So, nothing.
00:05:52.836 - 00:05:55.630, Speaker A: Nothing. Market's still deciding. Bitcoin or ETH?
00:05:55.970 - 00:06:01.866, Speaker B: Bitcoin. Eth. Blue chips are flat. Tokens. Ryan, up bigly. We'll talk about that later in the show. But tokens.
00:06:01.866 - 00:06:02.714, Speaker B: Wait, tokens?
00:06:02.762 - 00:06:03.594, Speaker A: Like Defi tokens.
00:06:03.642 - 00:06:04.394, Speaker B: Defi tokens.
00:06:04.442 - 00:06:05.662, Speaker A: Yeah, they're on the move.
00:06:05.716 - 00:06:09.986, Speaker B: Yeah, they're on the move. We will cover that in what I am bullish on at the very end.
00:06:10.008 - 00:06:11.890, Speaker A: Is it time to bring our DPI chart back?
00:06:11.960 - 00:06:17.880, Speaker B: Oh, God. I'm not ready for that. Not just specific tokens, please.
00:06:18.410 - 00:06:24.086, Speaker A: How about global cryptocurrency market cap? Are we at a trillion yet?
00:06:24.268 - 00:06:37.782, Speaker B: Yeah, we've been at a trillion for a while. We ended last week at 1.114 trillion. We are at 1.11 trillion. So down $30 billion again, if it's less than one terra of downwards, that's flat.
00:06:37.926 - 00:06:43.110, Speaker A: Less than one terra. Wow. Too soon, David. Gas markets.
00:06:43.190 - 00:06:43.718, Speaker B: Gas markets.
00:06:43.734 - 00:06:53.082, Speaker A: Gas markets in real life, kind of suck. Price of the pump, but price at the ethereum pump still kind of good. Is this nine gwe this week? Did it hit as low as nine gwe?
00:06:53.146 - 00:07:00.580, Speaker B: Yeah. You can scroll down to get that chart a little bit. Yeah. So last week it was. Keep going down every single time you miss this. There we go. Okay.
00:07:00.580 - 00:07:18.598, Speaker B: Green chart. And green top, right? Yeah. So we'll start here. The average total transaction gas distribution, the peak was at nine gwe this week, down one guay from last week, seven. Ryan is the number we got to beat to be deflationary in the merge, and we are at nine.
00:07:18.764 - 00:07:45.940, Speaker A: That's too close for comfort. All right. That would be so disappointing. But let's take a look at bitcoin and ETH from all time high perspective. Bitcoin down 65% from all time high this week. ETH down 64%. And the difference between ETH and bitcoin from their respective bottoms is ETH is up 76% from its bottom and bitcoin is only up 26%.
00:07:45.940 - 00:07:58.050, Speaker A: So ETH took a harder crash, harder dip than bitcoin, but it has recovered much faster. And now it's kind of neck and neck on the percent. Down from all time high. What do you make of this?
00:07:58.120 - 00:08:14.918, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, this is definitely the merge trade. It's very infrequently that I feel like we can confidently say what is making the market do the things that it's doing, but right now, I have some of the most confidence I've ever had that this is the merge trade. This is what this. Yeah, absolutely. Merge is bullish.
00:08:15.094 - 00:08:23.962, Speaker A: Let's look at the other percentage tokens down from all time high. So besides bitcoin and ETH, how about binance chain? What's that looking like?
00:08:24.016 - 00:08:39.426, Speaker B: Yeah. BNB always does very, very well. Honestly. One of the reasons is because it's one of the few tokens that actually has cash flows embedded in it. It's kind of got this manual EIP 1559, buyback and burn, because that's what finance does with its revenues. It buys BNB and burn it.
00:08:39.448 - 00:08:46.702, Speaker A: It's a massive exchange, which is a cash cow in bull markets and bear markets. It's still a cash cow, and that's still sort of backing the finance chain.
00:08:46.766 - 00:08:47.426, Speaker B: Always has, or.
00:08:47.448 - 00:08:48.426, Speaker A: Sorry, BNB chain.
00:08:48.478 - 00:08:59.194, Speaker B: BnB chain. Yeah. So it's down 56% compared to bitcoin. And ether is down 66%. So definitely better than those two. XRP down 88%. Cardano down 83%.
00:08:59.194 - 00:09:11.418, Speaker B: Salana down 85%. Polka dot down 85%. Dogecoin down 91%. Polygon down 69%. Nice. Avalanche down 84%. Uniswap only down 28%.
00:09:11.504 - 00:09:11.802, Speaker A: Wow.
00:09:11.856 - 00:09:15.318, Speaker B: Uni only down 28%. That's pretty good. That's pretty.
00:09:15.424 - 00:09:39.662, Speaker A: I got to admit, David, I look at this chart and I see a little bit like nature's healing. Yeah. I mean, this makes more sense to me. Than the bull market. Doesn't make complete sense to me, but it's still more reasonable than things in the bull market. Let's talk a little bit more about the bullish eth narrative. It's kind of going mainstream, you know? Joe Weisenthal, right, from Bloomberg, big time.
00:09:39.736 - 00:09:40.262, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:40.396 - 00:10:14.786, Speaker A: He has a podcast I listen to occasionally, also has a newsletter, and in his newsletter this week, joe Weisenthal, who's never really been an ETH bull at any point in time, any of my reading of his, he just wrote why ETH is taking over the narrative and why bitcoin's narrative is busted. And yeah, I think this is starting to escape into mainstream. Is probably the takeaway here that ETH, like surpassing bitcoin on the narrative front is a real thing that's happening right now.
00:10:14.888 - 00:10:46.570, Speaker B: Yeah. And there's two reasons for this. I think if you're inside of the crypto industry, if you are bullish ETH over bitcoin, then it's because of ether being deflationary post merge. But if you're outside of the crypto industry, you think that Ethereum is going to be in a better place than bitcoin because of the ESG green energy narrative. So it's kind of pick your reason, but we got two of them as to why people are trending in favor of east lately. Ryan, really quickly, I just talked about how Uniswap was only down like 28%, 29%. That didn't feel right.
00:10:46.570 - 00:10:55.342, Speaker B: It's actually down 70. It's down 80%. I just checked on trading view. Yeah, it's actually down 80%. The Maxari chart, I don't know where that came from.
00:10:55.396 - 00:11:09.586, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for that correction. Yeah. But to your point and the two reasons to be bullish, when you're inside of the space, you're kind of bullish because of the structural sell pressure. That just decreases, in my mind, the.
00:11:09.608 - 00:11:12.706, Speaker B: Correct reason for being bullish, I think.
00:11:12.728 - 00:11:43.802, Speaker A: So the narrative side, we knew proof of stake, we knew proof of work was going away and Ethereum was becoming ESGs kind of forever. But I think this is less well known, but this has a greater, more immediate impact. What is the chart that we're looking at on the change in theoretical annual structural sell pressure with the massive issuance reduction, all the proof of work issuance, it's like 4.1%, something like this. It goes away completely the day of the merge. What are we looking at in this chart?
00:11:43.866 - 00:12:34.234, Speaker B: Yeah, so we are looking at a bar chart that's titled reduction in theoretical annual structural cell pressure. And what that means is that some bigger chains have gone through changes in monetary policy throughout their history. Ether used to be issued five ether per block at genesis. That got reduced down to three in 2017, and then it got reduced down to two in 2019 to where it is now. Other blockchains have also done similar things, like the bitcoin happening. Famously, there was a 2016 bitcoin happening, a 2020 bitcoin happening, and the sizes of these bars are a function of how much sell pressure is getting reduced. So when bitcoin goes through a habiting, you take how much bitcoin would have been issued in a year, multiply that by the USD price, and then take away how much is not being issued as a result of the habiting.
00:12:34.234 - 00:13:22.246, Speaker B: And so the 2020 bitcoin havening reduced $3 billion in theoretical annual sell pressure. That got reduced from the habiting. The ether reduction from three ETH to two ETH in the proof of work, mining reward in 2019 removed 500 million in yearly annual sell pressure. But reminder, that's when Ether was like one or $200. And so if you multiply that by ten or 20 to get where we are now, that would control for that. On the very far left, we have two upcoming changes. We have the bitcoin happening in 2024, which if you again multiply the amount of bitcoin being issued versus its current price, where it is now at $23,000, bitcoin will receive almost a $4 billion reduction in annual sell pressure.
00:13:22.246 - 00:13:30.622, Speaker B: This is why bitcoiners love the happening, right? We've reduced sell pressure. This is why the happening celebrated like scarcity coming in, and it's scheduled every four years.
00:13:30.676 - 00:13:31.982, Speaker A: You know it's coming, right?
00:13:32.116 - 00:14:07.130, Speaker B: And then in the ETH merge, the ETH merge, which is upcoming very, very quickly, is going to be a theoretical reduction in $7.5 billion of annual sell pressure. And so almost double the annual reduction in annual sell pressure from ETH to bitcoin, which is also saying something when it's double a reduction in us dollar sell pressure. But the difference in market cap between bitcoin and Ethereum is about 2.5 x. So the bitcoin market cap is 440,000,000,000. The Ethereum market cap is 195,000,000,000, call it 200.
00:14:07.130 - 00:14:27.490, Speaker B: And so the bitcoin market cap is 2.5 times larger than Ethereum's. But the Ethereum US dollar sell pressure reduction is twice as big as bitcoin's. And so this is why this is so incredibly bullish it's such an outsized reduction in sell pressure versus the much smaller Ethereum market cap.
00:14:27.640 - 00:14:43.538, Speaker A: Yeah. Another way to say this too is in a post merge world, Ethereum is going to have to find in order to stay flat, in order for prices not to explode upwards, Ethereum is going to have to find $7.5 billion in new sellers.
00:14:43.634 - 00:14:44.278, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:44.444 - 00:14:46.194, Speaker A: And if it doesn't, won't be finding.
00:14:46.242 - 00:14:48.854, Speaker B: It here, Ryan, if it doesn't find.
00:14:48.892 - 00:14:52.022, Speaker A: Those new sellers, has no choice but to go up.
00:14:52.076 - 00:14:53.090, Speaker B: Has no choice but to go.
00:14:53.100 - 00:15:02.720, Speaker A: That's why the economics of the merge are so interesting and so attractive. And I think why the market is starting maybe to price this in, though I don't think they've fully priced it in.
00:15:03.730 - 00:15:06.554, Speaker B: Of course, the merge is literally like checkmate sellers.
00:15:06.682 - 00:15:39.702, Speaker A: I just don't why would you sell? There's two times you can buy or sell eth, right? One is before the merge and the other is after. Right? I'm definitely a buyer before the merge. I think it's a historic opportunity anyway, not financial advice. Okay. But the second reason, the reason maybe mainstream thinks this is interesting as well, is the whole ESG narrative. So this is the energy reduction narrative. When Ethereum transitions to proof of stake and gets rid of all of the energy inefficient mining that happens.
00:15:39.702 - 00:15:41.254, Speaker A: What tweet are we looking at here, David?
00:15:41.302 - 00:16:02.810, Speaker B: Yeah, so we're looking at just a chart of Google searches for ESG over time. And it's like a hockey. It's on the beginnings of a hockey stage. Hockey stick. It looks like popularity of Google searches for ESG over time. I don't really know what this x axis is. Maybe it's arbitrary, but we are roughly three times higher than we were in 2020, if that is any sort of indication.
00:16:02.810 - 00:16:49.690, Speaker B: So we're extrapolating here and saying just like ESG as a concept, which is just like in sustainable investing, both in ecological standpoint, but also like a political and governance standpoint. And so implying that ESG is in vogue and so a reduction in energy usage by a leading blockchain will be a very popular move with people because ESG is in vogue now. Personally, I don't really enjoy the ESG. I think it's just adding a political element to investing, but that is just a political take, I guess. I think there's better ways to optimize for investments, but it's what the people want, and the people want things that are green, and that's what Ethereum is doing when it goes to the merge.
00:16:49.770 - 00:17:15.302, Speaker A: You definitely have to track it as a narrative. And the bottom line here, as the tweet said, is bitcoin has decided to ignore the ESG issue entirely, whereas Ethereum is unlatching itself from proof of work. And that's the narrative going forward. And I think people are buying into that narrative as well. David. People are also buying into Ens. We just got the July 2022 stats, and ENS is an NFT that just is doing very well in this bear market.
00:17:15.302 - 00:17:17.302, Speaker A: What are we looking at for the high level stats here?
00:17:17.356 - 00:17:52.270, Speaker B: Yeah, let's go through some of the numbers. 378,000 new ETH registrations, bringing the new total to 1.86 million ens names that have been minted. That's $6.8 million in protocol revenue going to the Dow. That's 5400 EtH in revenue with 48,000 new ETH accounts, new Ethereum addresses that have at least one ens name in it, and greater, and I never have understood this last metric, greater than 99% of openc domain volume. Does that mean ENS is dominating openc volume by 99% domains?
00:17:52.350 - 00:17:56.900, Speaker A: There are other domains besides youths and ens. There are cryptos or also.
00:17:57.350 - 00:18:06.102, Speaker B: Okay, so it's market share like Ens. Well, that makes sense. Yeah. The domain space is like a monopoly game, so that makes sense. ENS definitely has won that game.
00:18:06.156 - 00:18:09.654, Speaker A: It's kind of feeling like it's the right at least.
00:18:09.772 - 00:18:10.438, Speaker B: Yes.
00:18:10.604 - 00:18:18.794, Speaker A: Yeah, this is really interesting. And all of that protocol revenue goes to the Dow. Yeah. 6.8 million. Protocol revenue. That was 6.8
00:18:18.794 - 00:18:19.770, Speaker A: million for the month.
00:18:19.840 - 00:18:21.710, Speaker B: Just one for the month. For the month. Yeah.
00:18:21.780 - 00:18:23.914, Speaker A: What? Yeah, that's a cash cow.
00:18:23.962 - 00:18:27.498, Speaker B: Right? And I can't imagine the Dow has all that many expenses.
00:18:27.594 - 00:18:32.026, Speaker A: Okay, what is the token price of ENS?
00:18:32.218 - 00:18:33.520, Speaker B: That's a good question.
00:18:34.050 - 00:18:37.838, Speaker A: How's that doing? Remember the ENS token? You got some airdrop, a lot of.
00:18:37.844 - 00:18:42.270, Speaker B: People, which I couldn't claim because my argent wallet lost my private keys. My argent.
00:18:42.770 - 00:18:46.146, Speaker A: It's off the bottoms here. Still climbing.
00:18:46.178 - 00:18:46.662, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:46.796 - 00:18:47.878, Speaker A: Bottom around nine.
00:18:47.964 - 00:18:50.134, Speaker B: The ENS is a good buy.
00:18:50.332 - 00:18:51.398, Speaker A: Double from the bottom.
00:18:51.484 - 00:19:10.518, Speaker B: Yeah, but I mean, if you go to cryptofees info, just talking about the Dapps Uniswap. $1.5 million in revenue in one day. Ave, $0.6 million of revenue in one day. GMX, which is an app that's spitting out ETH to its token holders .2 million sushi swap.
00:19:10.518 - 00:19:23.486, Speaker B: 1.16 million. Ens coming in in 1234. Coming in fifth at zero. $15 million per day. $150,000 per day in revenue, still three.
00:19:23.508 - 00:19:24.990, Speaker A: Times more than Salana.
00:19:26.450 - 00:19:37.862, Speaker B: It's not a fair comparison because Salana is like, explicitly like, we won't collect any fees, we will not have economic sustainability. And that's how we'll just onboard everyone. By collecting zero money.
00:19:37.996 - 00:19:42.920, Speaker A: Yes, but I think it's more of a fair comparison than people actually think.
00:19:43.690 - 00:19:44.982, Speaker B: People should think this.
00:19:45.036 - 00:19:51.686, Speaker A: Yes. We actually get into this conversation with, I was going to say polynaia polenia.
00:19:51.878 - 00:19:52.534, Speaker B: Polenia.
00:19:52.582 - 00:19:57.242, Speaker A: Yeah. So David and I did an anon interview with Polenia last week.
00:19:57.296 - 00:20:03.950, Speaker B: We talked a lot about previously known as the Anon, previously known as Polynaya. Turns out we have not been pronouncing that name correctly at all.
00:20:04.020 - 00:20:24.260, Speaker A: Anyway, it's not coming out this Monday, but the next Monday, we talk all about alternative layer ones versus Ethereum and L2s and where the value accrual is going to lie. And anyway, don't miss that episode is all I'm saying. We get into this discussion around fees and how it impacts valuation. David, what else we got here?
00:20:24.710 - 00:20:38.214, Speaker B: Speaking of EnS names, Openc bought OpenC EtH for $165,000. Wow. Yeah. So nice payday for whoever minted openc eth. Congratulations. Oh, that's basically 100 eth. Hold on.
00:20:38.252 - 00:20:43.366, Speaker A: I'm glad we got bankless EtH back in the day. David, before this, could you imagine how.
00:20:43.388 - 00:20:46.294, Speaker B: Much we'd be gouged if we hadn't gotten bankless Eth?
00:20:46.342 - 00:20:47.802, Speaker A: Be so sad. I don't know if I'd do it.
00:20:47.856 - 00:20:50.582, Speaker B: What do we pay for that? We pay like $2,000 for that. Like, goodbye.
00:20:50.646 - 00:20:56.746, Speaker A: We paid Eth for it, so you have to translate that into ETH terms. Maybe it's worse than that. Who knows?
00:20:56.778 - 00:20:57.534, Speaker B: But Ethan's down.
00:20:57.572 - 00:20:59.120, Speaker A: I don't know. No, we're probably.
00:20:59.890 - 00:21:12.130, Speaker B: I'm going to go find this out right now. Ryan, we bought bankless ETH August 2, 2020 for 5.15 e. That's more than $2,000. Sad.
00:21:12.550 - 00:21:13.502, Speaker A: That's very steep.
00:21:13.566 - 00:21:20.600, Speaker B: What is that right now? Yeah. That's like $8,000. Yeah. 5.15.
00:21:21.370 - 00:21:22.870, Speaker A: Yeah. Under 10,000.
00:21:22.940 - 00:21:26.498, Speaker B: 8250. Yeah. I mean, a steal over the long term.
00:21:26.594 - 00:21:30.582, Speaker A: Yeah, over the long run, I mean, we would have had to pay a lot more for it now.
00:21:30.636 - 00:21:31.782, Speaker B: An egregious amount.
00:21:31.916 - 00:21:39.946, Speaker A: And by the way, we caught this when somebody let it expire. So somebody had purchased it and they let it expire. We came in and sniped it. The bid process.
00:21:40.128 - 00:21:43.600, Speaker B: Wait, how did we. If it expired, why did we pay 5.15.
00:21:46.290 - 00:21:55.440, Speaker A: There was like this bid process that they had in place with some expired domains where it started very steep and then over the next 30 days it descended in price.
00:21:55.970 - 00:21:57.406, Speaker B: But anyone could buy it.
00:21:57.508 - 00:21:59.554, Speaker A: Anyone could buy it. But we bought it right away.
00:21:59.592 - 00:22:00.242, Speaker B: Oh yeah.
00:22:00.376 - 00:22:34.042, Speaker A: So we bought it kind of at the top of that because we're not taking the risk. Anyway, guys, coming up next we're going to talk more about the hack season that seems to be happening. It's sort of a bad week for hacks across crypto, especially if you are using the bridges to some of these other ecosystems. A 200 million dollar hack and then this Salana private key hack. Going to talk about that. And then also, David, you're going to tell us whether proof of work eth a fork of ethereum, if that's a real thing, or fake news. And I'm still hoping for my eth forked tokens that I could sell for more eth.
00:22:34.106 - 00:22:35.550, Speaker B: Don't hold your breath.
00:22:35.890 - 00:22:41.120, Speaker A: We'll see guys. We'll be right back. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:22:41.490 - 00:23:34.026, Speaker B: Makerdao is the OG Defi protocol, the first defi protocol to ever exist, even before we called it defi, Makerdao produces Dai, the industry's most battle tested and resilient stablecoin using Maker, you don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity. Instead, you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mint dai directly. With Maker, the power to mint new money is in your hands. And there's something new in the Makerdao ecosystem. Every time a new maker vault is opened, the owner can claim a poem which contributes funds to one tree planted, an organization with ongoing global reforestation efforts, creating a world where digital participation and the health of our environment can live side by side. Soon, maker will be present on all chains and L2s, bringing the biggest and best DFI credit facility to everywhere there is dFi today you can mint Dai on Oasis app, DeFi Saver, or other defi protocols that you use. So follow maker on Twitter at makerdao and learn from the oldest and most resilient dow in existence.
00:23:34.026 - 00:24:13.478, Speaker B: Rocket pool is your friendly, decentralized Ethereum staking protocol. You can stake your eth with rocket pool and get our eth in return, allowing you to stake your eth and use it in DFI at the same time. You can get 4% on your eth by staking it with rocket pool, but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes. Running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16 eth to get started. Why would you do this? You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled EtH. So your API is boosted. So if you're bullish east staking, you can increase your APY and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network which currently has over 1000 independent validators.
00:24:13.478 - 00:24:22.174, Speaker B: It's yield farming, but with Ethereum nodes you can get started@rocketpool.net and also join the rocket pool community in their discord. You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there.
00:24:22.372 - 00:24:36.130, Speaker A: All right guys, we are back with another big bridge hack. This time a bridge called Nomad was drained of nearly $200 million in an exploit. This was a code type exploit, so a technical exploit. David, do you want to tell us what happened?
00:24:36.280 - 00:24:44.546, Speaker B: Yeah. So cross train bridge, Nomad. It goes to a number of different ecosystems. Avalanche. Ethereum. Evmos. Evmos.
00:24:44.658 - 00:24:45.554, Speaker A: Cosmos chain.
00:24:45.602 - 00:25:04.858, Speaker B: Cosmos. Right. Milk, Omada and moonbeam. And so like you said, it was a smart contract exploit as opposed to like an economic or oracle attack. We lost almost $200 million. And the person that really unpacked this the best is Sam C. Sun, who put a thread together.
00:25:04.858 - 00:25:41.446, Speaker B: And so we'll go ahead and read out the thread because it's not too long. So Sam says Nomad just got drained for over 150,000,000 in one of the most chaotic hacks that web3 has ever seen. How did this happen exactly? And what was the root cause? Allow me to take you behind the scenes. Please do, Sam. And so he says it all started when somebody, a Twitter Telegram account, shared another Telegram account, Twitter account's tweet in an ethereum security telegram channel. Although I had no idea what was going on at the time, the sheer volume of assets leaving the bridge was clearly a bad sign. And he shows a tweet of 100 WBTC leaving the Nomad bridge like transaction after transaction after transaction.
00:25:41.446 - 00:26:05.422, Speaker B: So 100 WBTC, 100 WBTC. And somebody says, nomad Bridge getting rugged looks very, very sus. Sam says, my first thought was that there was some misconfiguration for the token's decimals. After all, it seemed that the bridge was running a send one WBTC get 100 WBTC back promotion. And then here he's showing a tweet where somebody was sending in literally zero one BTC. But hundreds of WBTC were going out.
00:26:05.476 - 00:26:06.830, Speaker A: That's a bad promotion.
00:26:08.710 - 00:26:39.622, Speaker B: Sam says. However, after some painful manual digging on the Moonbeam network, I confirmed that while the Moonbeam transaction did bridge out zero one BTC, somehow the Ethereum transaction bridged in WBTC. Further, the transaction bridge in the WBTC didn't actually prove anything. It's simply called process. Like a function process directly. Suffice to say, being able to process a message without proving it first is extremely not good. And so what they mean is by proving it, is that there's a thing called approver.
00:26:39.622 - 00:27:13.094, Speaker B: Maybe this is what we're talking about. But basically anybody can send a message to a bridge, but the message needs to be correct. And that's part of the functionality of the bridge. At this point, there were two possibilities. Either the proof had been submitted separately in an earlier block, or there was something extremely wrong in the replica contract. However, there was absolutely no indication that anything had been proven recently. Again, this is like terminology about how contracts need to be receiving messages that are correct to whatever degree that the smart contract in that bridge deems something correct.
00:27:13.094 - 00:27:40.762, Speaker B: It's like kind of up to how the bridge is constructed. But a correct message would be something that is coming from one chain to another and a proof is generated that is correct. Or so Sam continues and says there's only one possibility left. There was a fatal flaw in the replica contract. But how? A quick look suggests that the message submitted must belong to an acceptable route. Otherwise the check on line 185 would fail. Fortunately, there is an easy way to sanding to check this assumption.
00:27:40.762 - 00:28:08.214, Speaker B: I knew that the root of the message which had not been proven would be zero x because message brackets underscore message hash bracket would be uninitialized. All I had to do was check whether the contract would accept that as a root. And then the next one is oops. That's the only thing the tweet says. It says oops. And basically Sam just put in as an address and it comes back true. Meaning that every single thing will come back true.
00:28:08.214 - 00:28:14.380, Speaker B: Meaning that the bridge is like an open vault. Everything is true. The contract returns everything true.
00:28:14.910 - 00:28:20.230, Speaker A: So that means anyone could go, anyone function and pull funds out more or less of the bridge.
00:28:20.310 - 00:28:48.830, Speaker B: Yeah. And so Sam says, it turns out during a routine upgrade that the nomad team initialized the trusted route to be zero x. To be clear, using zero values as an initialization values is a common practice. Unfortunately, in this case, it had the tiny side effect of auto proving every message. So every possible message was approved, as in, like, hey, can you send me 100 WPTC? Approved. Approved. And so Sam says and finishes.
00:28:48.830 - 00:29:29.778, Speaker B: This is why the hack was so chaotic. You didn't need to know about solidity or Merkel trees or anything like that. All you had to do was find a transaction that worked, find and replace the other person's address with yours, and then rebroadcast it. So not every single transaction works. You have to have a certain hash, but it's just, you need to find a transaction that starts with zero x, and you can go find that by going to a previous bridge transaction and then copying that transaction and just replacing it with your outbound address and then sending that. And so TldR a routine upgrade marked the zero hash as a valid route, which had the effect of allowing messages to be spoofed on. Nomad attackers abused this to copy and paste transactions and quickly drained the bridge in a frenzied free for all.
00:29:29.778 - 00:29:42.934, Speaker B: So once one person realized it, everyone realized it. That the gates to the vault were open. There was an open vault, and all the money was just, like, sitting there. Somebody realized it. And then as soon as one person realized it, everyone realized it.
00:29:42.972 - 00:30:06.060, Speaker A: That's the analogy. Right? So this nomad bridge had code that essentially vaulted off massive amounts of money, hundreds of millions of dollars in value here. So, like, close to $200 million. And then they issued an update to this vault, and the doors swung wide open, and they didn't even realize it.
00:30:07.010 - 00:30:16.314, Speaker B: No one realized it for 43 days. So this vault has been open for 43 days in a row, and it's only two or three days ago that somebody was like, hey, there's money there.
00:30:16.372 - 00:30:16.930, Speaker A: There's money.
00:30:17.000 - 00:30:19.170, Speaker B: No one stopping me from going and getting it.
00:30:19.240 - 00:30:30.902, Speaker A: And so they went, and the first couple people grabbed the money, and then an entire crowd assembled to go pick up the money from the vault and stuff it under their trench coats and run home with it.
00:30:30.956 - 00:30:31.522, Speaker B: Yep.
00:30:31.666 - 00:30:34.546, Speaker A: Wow. Are these white hats, David?
00:30:34.658 - 00:31:00.830, Speaker B: Yeah. So not everyone who's doing this is evil. Of course. There are a number of people that just went and grabbed the money, because if they didn't grab the money, then somebody malicious would grab the money. So if you're a person saying, well, that money is free, everyone's taking it, I'll be a good person, and I'll take the money and I'll return it before someone else does, before an evildoer does it. And so it's kind of like a little bit like game theory. If you know that you are going to return the money, then you can safely go get the money and return it to the people later.
00:31:00.830 - 00:31:14.290, Speaker B: So somebody who made a transaction to go get this money and knew what they were doing, they write in the message field in their transaction saying, I'm returning this money. FBI. Please calm down. No, I didn't plan to seal it. And yes, I know this address is stopped.
00:31:15.750 - 00:31:17.940, Speaker A: That's amazing. Just leaving a message.
00:31:18.310 - 00:31:29.690, Speaker B: My hands are up. My hands are up. Like, don't shoot. Don't shoot. David, that was a super funny tweet where somebody says, accidentally exploited the Nomad bridge for $17,000. We'll return the funds.
00:31:31.390 - 00:31:33.526, Speaker A: Did you see this clip of, like, the monkeys?
00:31:33.638 - 00:31:45.870, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is a tweet from Haskell trade saying the nomad hack explained, and here's just, like, a plastic bin of a bunch of bread, and then there's, like, 100 monkeys coming in there, all grabbing the bread out of the basket.
00:31:46.370 - 00:32:05.694, Speaker A: I mean, this is kind of of the $190,000,000. Apparently, 9 million has been returned. So there's $9 million worth of white hacks that are actually doing the right thing and returning these funds. But that's quite a gap, man. That's like 180,000,000 that has not been returned.
00:32:05.742 - 00:32:09.422, Speaker B: And what's that? 5% was captured by white hat hackers?
00:32:09.566 - 00:32:10.306, Speaker A: Yes.
00:32:10.488 - 00:32:11.414, Speaker B: It's not zero.
00:32:11.532 - 00:32:21.698, Speaker A: I mean, the big question is, do you remember the wormhole hack that happened? Man, it feels like another lifetime ago, but honestly, it wasn't that long ago, but that got a bailout from jump capital.
00:32:21.794 - 00:32:24.250, Speaker B: The question is, wasn't a billion dollar bailout?
00:32:24.910 - 00:32:35.790, Speaker A: Yes, something like that. It was a lot of money. I can't remember it. I don't know if it was quite a billion, but I don't know if the deep pockets are coming to rescue the bridge this time. What do you think?
00:32:35.860 - 00:32:41.294, Speaker B: Right. Well, there's also a lot less money in the ecosystem now. $320,000,000 is what it was.
00:32:41.412 - 00:32:44.800, Speaker A: 320,000,000? Yeah, pretty big one.
00:32:45.330 - 00:32:52.290, Speaker B: Plenty of people have hundreds of millions of dollars in the top of the market. Fewer people have hundreds of million dollars in this current state of the market.
00:32:52.360 - 00:32:56.370, Speaker A: I mean, I think Nomad has recently been funded as well by VC.
00:32:56.710 - 00:32:59.842, Speaker B: Yeah, but not for 190,000,000. They raise, like, 22 million.
00:32:59.976 - 00:33:02.886, Speaker A: Not even close. Not even close. So what are you going to do?
00:33:02.908 - 00:33:05.478, Speaker B: And that's their operating money. They have to pay employees with that.
00:33:05.564 - 00:33:17.046, Speaker A: What's also interesting is this was a bridge to many kind of. Of the alternative layer, one ecosystem. So, as you said, avalanche the cosmos. Milk. Amida milk.
00:33:17.078 - 00:33:17.926, Speaker B: Amada milk.
00:33:17.958 - 00:33:18.778, Speaker A: Omada is.
00:33:18.864 - 00:33:19.702, Speaker B: That's Cardano.
00:33:19.766 - 00:33:23.726, Speaker A: It's Cardano. And what's moonbeam? Do you know what moonbeam is?
00:33:23.748 - 00:33:25.646, Speaker B: Moonbeam? I do not know what moonbeam is.
00:33:25.748 - 00:33:27.200, Speaker A: Yeah, neither do I.
00:33:27.570 - 00:33:32.910, Speaker B: So what do you think? Very powerful dragon type attack from Pokemon.
00:33:33.350 - 00:33:38.786, Speaker A: Really? Okay. Your Pokemon lore exceeds mine, my friend. All right.
00:33:38.888 - 00:33:42.782, Speaker B: It's a polka dot platform. The question, such an ass. Polka dot.
00:33:42.846 - 00:34:41.378, Speaker A: Yeah, nothing to do with Pokemon. So the question is, are all bridges susceptible to this? So like banklets, we're very excited about L2s, obviously, which also have bridges. Arbitrum, the ZK EVMs, you've heard us talk about these before, and they also have bridges, to David's point, these bridges are not susceptible to economic attack, which is one category of attack and probably less susceptible to oracle attack. We haven't delved into that in all the details, but is susceptible to similar kinds of technical attack, as we saw with Nomad. So does that worry you that like, hey, anytime we bridge from mainet Ethereum, there's some smart contract risk here on any of these L2 ecosystems, you think that'll be an inhibitor to scale?
00:34:41.554 - 00:35:28.662, Speaker B: Yeah. So L2s are bridges that have less attack surface area. Like you said, you can't do an economic attack on a L2 bridge, and you also cannot do an oracle attack on a L2 bridge if that bridge has an oracle. But smart contracts are smart contracts, and bridges are smart contracts. And so a L2 bridge to optimism, Zksync, arbitrum, these are all have bridges that all have smart contracts, and those smart contracts can be exploited. There is one major difference for optimistic roll ups, in that optimistic roll ups have a seven day withdraw window. And so if you have a bunch of ether on optimism or arbitrum, and then you exploit that bridge, it's going to take you seven days to get back to the Ethereum layer one.
00:35:28.662 - 00:36:35.562, Speaker B: But I guess that's only true if that smart contract exploit happens on the L2 side, because that ether does exist on the Ethereum layer one inside the bridge contract. So if the Ethereum layer one bridge contract is exploited, I guess you could just get it out immediately. So smart contract risk is always going to be smart contract risk. The spicy hot take that I'll have is that if you are building a L2 on Ethereum, one of the core reasons why you would choose to do a L2 on Ethereum rather than alternative layer one is that you believe in, you prioritize security utmost. Like if you are doing your own blockchain, your own layer one blockchain, you have to build your security from scratch, and you're going to be inherently less secure than the Ethereum layer one because that's what the Ethereum layer one has optimized for. So if you are a L2, you are prioritizing security that is in your culture as a team. So if you are a team that prioritizes security in your culture, you're likely also doing a much higher effort on securing your bridge and your bridge smart contracts than you would if you are a team that doesn't prioritize security as much, and teams that don't prioritize security don't build roll ups, they build alternative layer ones.
00:36:35.562 - 00:36:37.740, Speaker B: Is that a fair take? I feel like that's a fair take.
00:36:38.110 - 00:37:24.122, Speaker A: I think that's a fair take. But also at the same time, it's nice to say, right, but I don't know, it's kind of verify, don't trust. Sure, it's not great to be in the position of having to trust the expertise and the skill level and the security profile of devs of a particular bridge. So yeah, I would say I am moderately worried about this, and it's not something that we should take lightly. The good news, I think, with all of these bridges in the roll up ecosystem is they're upgradable. So we haven't removed the upgrade button from any of them. So if something goes wrong, a patch could go in quickly.
00:37:24.122 - 00:38:03.478, Speaker A: But yeah, I think there is some risk, and we should be real about that. When people are bridging to even L2 ecosystems, they have this risk. Now, I think that risk will decrease massively over time. There was a time, David, where I was too freaked out to put any funds inside of a multisig, like the gnosis multisig wallet, for instance. And do you remember there was a gnosis multisig wallet, kind of a v one, and then they created a v two, and you sort of reset the clock back to zero when a new upgrade is kind of issued. And now I'm not. Gnosis multisig holds tens of billions of dollars at this point.
00:38:03.478 - 00:38:35.758, Speaker A: It's been around for years, has a very strong Lindy, and I think the only way around kind of the bridge hack concern is you have to have bridges that have been in place without being touched for a long period of time, securing massive amounts of money, and this is going to take time. So I don't know. I'm not putting all of my funds on a L2 as a result of this, because it's still in the early phases. Do you think that's a fair take?
00:38:35.844 - 00:39:17.258, Speaker B: I definitely think that's a fair take. And just I think we should definitely take some time on this topic because bridges has been a huge theme of the last twelve months. This is a Bartech thread from L2 beat. Layer two beat is doing a fantastic job just putting in risk frameworks and helping to define the risks of bridges and L2s. So Bartech puts this thread together and he says, with the recent hack of Nomad, I think it's time to reflect more broadly on bridge security, as by now they have become far more the most critical piece of blockchain infrastructure. Here are some things to consider. Externally validated bridges, as in bridges that require a kind of multisig to process messages, can obviously be drained by the key owners and the keys might be compromised.
00:39:17.258 - 00:39:41.922, Speaker B: But the smart contract there is very simple to implement, audit and independently verify, as in there's a trade off here. Your smart contract is more simple because you've exported a bunch of risk to the multi sig, and sometimes especially in the beginning stages of a bridge. I would definitely advocate for this model. Let's just remove all the complexity and just trust the founders. Trust the multi sig for the beginning stage.
00:39:42.066 - 00:39:45.842, Speaker A: This is similar to the Polygon bridge to the proof of stake chain.
00:39:45.986 - 00:40:22.046, Speaker B: Granted, polygon has an extra layer of defense because it has Ethereum side matic staking, which is a very meaningful difference than like your typical side chain or cross layer one bridge. Bartek continues and says there is downside. Of course, with that bridge, you need to trust the off chain code, which is completely opaque. Who knows what's going on there? Shout out Ronan bridge with the Axie network. Bartek says Nomad is way more complex and it fell due to an obscure bug in a smart contract code, not an architectural flaw compared to Nomad. Optimistic rollups are still more complex compared to optimistic rollups. ZK rollups are insanely complex.
00:40:22.046 - 00:40:44.538, Speaker B: You do the math. It makes sense to let the bridge code ossify with time before you move bigger funds. But after the upgrade, the ossification timer is reset to zero as the upgrade may introduce a critical bug. As it happened with Nomad, this is what happened. They upgraded their bridge contract. It was fine previously, right? And so, yeah, it was fine. And they're like, okay, cool, let's up the security.
00:40:44.538 - 00:41:00.874, Speaker B: Let's up the hands off nature of this bridge. And that upgrade was the thing that introduced the risk. Whoops. Bartek says Nomad is also permissionless. Anyone could process messages and bridge, the bridge could not be stopped. No central actor to trust, which like yay, we like that in a bankless world. But also, ooh, scary.
00:41:00.874 - 00:41:27.058, Speaker B: In the early days, this removed power from Nomad team, but also left them helpless watching the bridge being drained. As noted many times before, this base critically needs a solution for design that is trustless and secure against critical bugs. At the same time, seven day delay windows in optimistic rollups gives an honest actor, an honest operator, plenty of time to stop withdrawals. Hence it makes it virtually impossible for an attacker to exploit the bug and its smart contract.
00:41:27.234 - 00:41:29.030, Speaker A: So the operator could pause things.
00:41:29.100 - 00:41:41.446, Speaker B: Operator could pause things. And I actually think that that actually does protect against ether deposits on the layer one from being revoked or exploited from the bridge contract because that contract has a seven day window on it. On the Ethereum.
00:41:41.478 - 00:41:45.514, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. That actually makes me feel better about optimistic roll ups.
00:41:45.562 - 00:42:05.758, Speaker B: Yeah. Therefore it may be. And so what he's saying here is there's a balance here with the seven day window, we can make things trustless and smart contract based without it being a multi sig. But you also have, if it comes down to it, like an operator can step in and do something inside of that seven days. Famously, this is what saved Ethereum during the Dow hack.
00:42:05.854 - 00:42:21.170, Speaker A: Right? And same with the upgrade ability. While that is like a knock against, it's more centralized for optimistic roll up team to have upgrade ability. The fact that they have that sort of makes the funds more secure if you have some trust in them to be an honest actor.
00:42:21.250 - 00:42:53.170, Speaker B: Yeah. Last few tweets from Bartek. Hence it makes it virtually impossible for an attacker to exploit the bug in a smart contract because of that seven day window. ZK rollups, if they contain the bug, might not be so lucky as there is no delay window there. Fun fact about ZK rollups, you can go in and out of ZK rollups instantaneously, but then you lose that seven day window protection. Bartech continues and says therefore it may be good to have a delay for big withdrawals and a cap on fast withdrawals to limit the potential damage. This is the approach that Makerdao is taking with its teleport for canonical multi chain dai.
00:42:53.170 - 00:43:23.898, Speaker B: Makerdao is making wormholes for dais across L2s. So this is relevant there. Bartek says if the fast withdrawal infrastructure is breached, Makerdao, not Dai users, will take the loss but up to a predefined limit. It's a risk that the Dow may be willing to take the risk is no different than issuing a bad loan. If this is one bad loan out of a thousand good loans, this is okay. You can be even more fancy and have more complex risk framework taking advantage of architectural properties of a given L2 to which you want to bridge to check out this proposal if you want to dive deeper. And then last couple of tweets.
00:43:23.898 - 00:44:06.758, Speaker B: One prominent project that limits deposits is starknet. Openly admitting to still being alpha is one thing, but users typically ignore that deposit limits keep Starknet's TVL artificially low, but this is good and responsible. We still need to look for the perfect bridge design and the cost of mistakes for the whole space is massive. In the meantime, users should be reasonable with how much funds they are moving out from the blaze layer. I just want to go back to my culture statement. Bartek previous at Makerdao, which is one of the dows that has been optimized for security since before this whole multi chain world. Makerdao has been so risk focused in its culture, and so that has now extended to Bartech and what they're doing at L2 beat and all their risk frameworks for L2s.
00:44:06.758 - 00:44:43.634, Speaker B: And now all these L2s are also focusing on the L2 beat risk framework coming from this very conservative L2 beat team that's optimized for security the most. I will ask you, if you consider yourself a citizen, to be a citizen of a different layer one chain, whether it's avalanche, Salana, pick your chain. Is there a culture of security in those chains that resembles the culture of security that happens on Ethereum? Because this is the thing that has saved Ethereum from all of these bridges, from all of these exploits that you see happening elsewhere. There's a reason why so much exploits is happening external to Ethereum.
00:44:43.762 - 00:44:45.346, Speaker A: Only the paranoids survive.
00:44:45.458 - 00:44:55.830, Speaker B: Only the paranoids survive. That's a great way to put it. So this culture of security is why so fewer exploits happen inside of the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:44:55.990 - 00:44:59.114, Speaker A: But also knock on wood there, David, you know what I mean?
00:44:59.152 - 00:45:17.710, Speaker B: Gladly, knock on wood. We can also compartmentalize out parts of the Ethereum app layer, like Wonderland, for example. Very risk taking. There's many defi apps on Ethereum that are very not risk adverse, but it's different from being risk averse on the app layer versus risk averse on the protocol layer.
00:45:17.790 - 00:45:41.610, Speaker A: You definitely want to prioritize projects that you definitely want to lean into projects that prioritize security over speed, right? In this case, and there are many shortcuts. Kyle, on the speed front of things Mr. Kyle Somani. But we're dealing with a lot of money. This reminds me to what we always end bankless, with, which this is the frontier. You could lose what you put in. It's not for everyone.
00:45:41.610 - 00:46:21.766, Speaker A: The frontier has kind of moved from main net Ethereum into the L2 space into the side chain space. So now in order to bridge funds to a side chain, you know what, David? I need to receive a bit more return on my investment because it's a bit more risky over there than on Mainnet. So these are all considerations as you're thinking about your journey, your bankless journey, and your journey into crypto. I'm confident, though, over time, these kind of like technical challenges, the code will become trusted, cemented, ossified, and that's really going to save us. Kind of similar to a gnosis safe. I was skeptical of that in the early days. Now I'm not.
00:46:21.766 - 00:47:20.102, Speaker A: I'm fine putting a lot into inside of gnosis safe. But I do think this is back to kind of a sad prediction that we made bankless made the beginning of 2022 that there will be more of these monster bridge hacks. So this is what we said. There will be some monster bridge hacks in 2022. We're starting to see them that will make people question their multi l one chain thesis. And here's also what I mean, because over time, you can get rid of and reduce the risk, the technical risk and the code risk, but you cannot reduce the economic risk and the oracle attack risk. Okay? And unless you're on a L2, unless you're doing some level of a roll up strategy in the side chain strategy where you've got networks of sidechains, you will always have the economic risk of bridges, you will always have the oracle attack risk of bridges.
00:47:20.102 - 00:47:49.486, Speaker A: And that ain't going away. And so this is a reason why I am much more bullish on kind of the ethereum roadmap pooled security vision than on kind of like, there will be many chains and there's no real settlement platform or shared security between. Because. Because there's just the bridge risk. People understate the bridge risk, and events like this kind of highlight what a mistake it is to understate the bridge risk. Anything else on this story, David?
00:47:49.598 - 00:48:30.190, Speaker B: Yeah, just to finally tie it, like this industry is built on top of settlement assurances, which is basically property rights. Are you in a bankless paradigm where you own your own assets and no one can revoke those assets from you? That is what this industry is built on. Everything is built on strong settlement assurances. And so by the same way, same vogue, that the strongest, most secure layer one will always end up winning out. The most secure and strongest bridges will also be winning out. And this is why bridges that have the least amount of risk surface area will win over the bridges that have more surface area. And those bridges are always going to be roll up cryptographic bridges.
00:48:30.930 - 00:48:39.538, Speaker A: There's your bridge occasion there. I think we've covered that thoroughly. Let's talk about the mysterious Salana wallet hack too.
00:48:39.624 - 00:48:42.094, Speaker B: That was unrelated to bridges, however, unrelated to bridges.
00:48:42.142 - 00:49:11.340, Speaker A: But it was crazy. This week, it's something, there's like 5000 wallets upwards, maybe closer to 10,000 wallets. Basically, salana wallets. People looked inside of their wallet and they were like, oh my God, my money is no longer there. How could this happen? And I'm not talking about centralized exchange wallets, I'm talking about sort of, you have the private key to your wallet, it's in phantom or some sort of metamask, for instance. And then all of a Sudden the funds are withdrawn. How could this even happen?
00:49:12.350 - 00:49:19.114, Speaker B: A lot of Solana users, for those that don't use Solana, it's like they opened up their metamask and there was no money there anymore.
00:49:19.162 - 00:49:44.898, Speaker A: Yes, it was all gone. And so big question of how does this happen and how did it happen? Because there's kind of like a Sherlock Holmes. The entire community, Ethereum, Salana, the entire crypto community was trying to figure out how this mass wallet drain actually happened. Fortunately, not a lot of money, but it was like $6 million or something like this. But a lot of wallets were affected. Do you want to tell us the story here, David?
00:49:44.994 - 00:50:07.034, Speaker B: Yeah. So here's the tweet thread. I'll just explain it better than I can. It says $6 million of Sol and USDC have been stolen from over 8000 salana wallets. The hacker used private keys to drain user funds in what has been one of the craziest and most mysterious hacks in recent times. It all started when a few people noticed that some unusual outflows were happening from phantom wallets on Salana. Phantom, I think, is the most popular wallet on Solana.
00:50:07.034 - 00:50:28.798, Speaker B: Numerous reports started to pop across Twitter and discord of users having fun drains from their wallets. Phantom Wallet was quick to issue a statement saying that they do not believe that this is a phantom specific issue. Interesting, interesting. And so developer and auditor x Fubar found zero. Xfubar found that the attacker was stealing both Sol and USD tokens. From people's slope and phantom wallet. Slope, another wallet.
00:50:28.798 - 00:50:46.054, Speaker B: In the Solana ecosystem, the most logical thing to do like this is to revoke any access to any dapps, as in like, undo all permissions. But Avalanche co founder Emmon asserted that it's likely that the attack acquired access to private keys. How did they do that? How'd they get the hands on 8000 different private keys?
00:50:46.102 - 00:50:47.050, Speaker A: Not supposed to happen.
00:50:47.120 - 00:51:20.706, Speaker B: Not supposed to happen. And so this means that the only way to protect your assets is to move them onto a hardware wallet or onto a centralized exchange. So this was a hot wallet exploit. Salana finally responded after hours of speculation that stated that over 7767 wallets had been affected by the exploit so far. But what was soon made matters worse was that RPC nodes started pinging as offline. This indicated that the Solana network was down, causing more panic across Twitter. It was theorized that the nodes were being purposely ddossed by developers in order to slow down the hackers.
00:51:20.706 - 00:51:42.090, Speaker B: This backfired as it caused additional confusion. Oof. Supposedly, the DDoS attack was aimed at the hacker, which subsequently resulted in an RPC nodes failing. Oh God, what a mess. Okay, keep going. The most concerning part is the lack of clarity surrounding the root cause of the issue. Even Solana co founder Anatole couldn't offer verdict.
00:51:42.090 - 00:52:07.810, Speaker B: Despite alluding to iOS imported wallets being the key target, he and other key Solana figures surveyed their audience for data, trying to get to the bottom of the exploit, almost attempting to conduct an on the go post modem. This indicates to me that we are dealing with a highly complex exploit. As of now, the issue is still being investigated. Solana's latest update says that they continue to investigate the root cause, and it does not appear to be a bug within Solana core code.
00:52:07.960 - 00:52:18.178, Speaker A: We do know the root cause, though. Now, I think this tweet thread kind of trails off at a time when we didn't know the root cause. Do you have any information on the root cause, David?
00:52:18.274 - 00:52:30.620, Speaker B: So in a different tweet, zero xfubar, who is apparently really good at deducing stuff like this, says it looks like the slope wallet sent plain text seed phrases to external integration partners. I'm sorry, what?
00:52:32.030 - 00:52:34.640, Speaker A: It's not mysterious at all, just like another new.
00:52:35.250 - 00:53:06.886, Speaker B: Okay, so that's like if metamask, it gives you your seed phrase and it makes you copy it down. That's like if metamask was sending that same seed phrase to infuria, and infura was just like logging that. And so that's absolutely crazy. Compromised phantom wallets came from seed phrases, imports used in slope. Compromised eth wallets were also from seed phrase reuse. So I guess some Ethereum wallets were even compromised for people that generated their wallet using slope. This is not a blockchain or a randomness issue.
00:53:06.886 - 00:53:22.460, Speaker B: This is a terribly irresponsible service provider issue. Fubar. Then later issues a correction saying the slope wallet did not send seed phrases to external partners, but may have logged them in their own centralized servers. Okay, well then they're the external partner. Apologies for getting a bit ahead of myself.
00:53:22.990 - 00:53:32.960, Speaker A: Whether they sent it to a third party or not, the fact that they were logging seed phrases in the database, anywhere in plain text where it could be hacked, that is a massive problem.
00:53:33.410 - 00:53:36.734, Speaker B: That is terrible. Don't like other people's seed phrases.
00:53:36.862 - 00:54:04.860, Speaker A: Nothing mysterious here. It's just a really bad wallet provider, basically, with really bad wallet provider. I mean, people were worried that there was like a blockchain issue, a randomness issue, just like quantum computers hacked people's private keys, something like this. It was so mysterious and it turns out it was just average everyday sharing private keys via plain text. And that's what screwed it over. So mystery solved, I guess. David, do you have any private key advice for us, though?
00:54:05.390 - 00:54:52.314, Speaker B: I do have one, but actually before I do that, I would like to actually just shill the Coinbase app. I'm not logged in because I don't have a Coinbase account, but they have a multiparty computation wallet. So you can go and use your Coinbase app as like a centralized exchange, as everyone does, but you can also go and trade specifically on uniswap or do stuff on Makerdao or pull together, because Coinbase has a multiparty computation wallet built into their app. So not only is it like a centralized custodian with exchange built in like we know, but it's also a self sovereign wallet with multiparty computation, meaning that they have a shard of your private key. Your phone also has a shard of your private key, so they can restore your private key, but they don't have your private key. That's crazy. So like Coinbase doesn't, doesn't get enough credit for that.
00:54:52.314 - 00:55:03.030, Speaker B: And so Coinbase app, and this is not even Coinbase wallet, this is the Coinbase consumer app. So I want to go find out more about that wall because that is a really cool feature.
00:55:03.110 - 00:55:07.066, Speaker A: We talked about it on a roll up. Remember they came out with it at the permissionless conference.
00:55:07.098 - 00:55:11.630, Speaker B: Yeah, I didn't realize they had already rolled it out to the main core consumer app.
00:55:11.700 - 00:55:31.940, Speaker A: Yeah, it's great, it's great. There are some pieces of the design that are a bit more centralized than, say, smart contract wallet, but it's like this nice place in the middle where it's a cool compromise. And as you said, they're getting it out to users right away. It's much better than a completely custodied centralized wallet provider. But anyway, what do you do?
00:55:32.250 - 00:55:56.320, Speaker B: Wait, before that though, we had a guest on who is like, they were explaining, maybe it was Mark Cuban. Yeah, it was Mark Cuban. He was talking to his friends and I downloaded Coinbase and I couldn't find the defi tab. There's now literally a defi tab in the Coinbase app, and you can do defi things. And from the user perspective, they get private keys, but they don't even know it and they can't lose them. It's great, it's great. Anyways, so here's what I say.
00:55:56.320 - 00:56:23.320, Speaker B: This isn't the best advice, but it definitely works. It's a little bit of a brute force method. I say, every six months or so, I generate a new set of private keys and I rotate my wallets, and this removes all buildup of smart contract approval risk. And so I generate my own private keys using my ledger. And then every six months ago, I just take my assets and I plop them into the new address. There are ways to achieve these same results. If you're worried about approval risk, you can just manually unapprove things.
00:56:24.410 - 00:56:31.318, Speaker A: But also this approval risk is another thing to worry about. It's not at play in either of these two hacks. It's just yet another thing you have to worry about.
00:56:31.404 - 00:56:51.162, Speaker B: Yes, if you approve a contract that sets permissions to all, that contract can do whatever you want with all of your money, but you can manually revoke those so you can get security that way. But this also removes any sort of accidental Internet exposure to my private keys. There's been one times I have a piece of paper, I don't have it with me, keep it elsewhere.
00:56:51.226 - 00:56:53.822, Speaker A: Careful, opsex. Or I have a piece of paper.
00:56:53.876 - 00:57:32.074, Speaker B: With every previous seed phrase that I've ever used, ever. Whether I've generated it with metamask, whether I've generated it with ledger, it's got all my historical private keys on it, and it's somewhere in the world. I'm not going to say where. It's not with me, it's not where I live. The reason why I keep that is for airdrops right? Sometimes some airdrop happens and I'm like, fuck, I have to go type in all of these old seed phrases to go check out which one of these addresses is relevant to the airdrop, and I type them into metamask. And so what was previously a ledger seed phrase becomes like a metamask seed phrase, making it a hot wallet. Hang on.
00:57:32.074 - 00:57:53.074, Speaker B: I'm basically like putting all of my previous ledger seed phrases into my metamask, making it exposed to the Internet. And so what I do is then I generate a new set of private keys and then in the appropriate way, not released to the Internet, and then I find a new address and I send all my assets to that brand new address. And so it's always like a rotation of just like, you can't find me, can't catch me, can't catch me.
00:57:53.112 - 00:57:57.720, Speaker A: I do not do any of those things. But I'm not sure if your method is better than what I do.
00:57:58.090 - 00:57:59.078, Speaker B: What do you do?
00:57:59.164 - 00:58:01.750, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I'm not going to disclose that. David.
00:58:03.370 - 00:58:11.222, Speaker B: This is the beautiful thing about this is I can tell about my private key management because it doesn't matter, because it's always changing.
00:58:11.366 - 00:58:45.198, Speaker A: Yeah. So I do think we should have an episode that is just all about best practices for OpSeC and private key management on the bankless journey. It's not somebody that needs to disclose what they're doing, but it's like, what are the best practices? Ten best practices, different methods, practical, real world. Because this stuff's hard, as we call it, the bankless journey for a reason. And bad things can happen to you, like bridge hacks, like oracle attacks, like economic attacks. You have to be careful what you use. And suddenly one day, if you use the wrong wallet, all your money gets stolen.
00:58:45.198 - 00:58:58.402, Speaker A: This is not easy stuff. The rewards are great on the other side, as we always say, with kind of going bankless, but so are the risks. The risks are great as well. Anyway, that's your strategy? That's David's strategy.
00:58:58.466 - 00:59:03.378, Speaker B: It's a nuclear of a strategy. There's definitely other ways to achieve the same ends, but it's what I do.
00:59:03.404 - 00:59:16.220, Speaker A: It's interesting. Yeah, it's definitely cool. All right, are we going to get any tokens, David? Last thing, are we going to get any tokens from a new ETH proof of work chain, do you think? Some free forked eth before the.
00:59:17.310 - 00:59:51.586, Speaker B: No. You will mean yes, you will have ether proof of work. No, it will be worth pennies. There's a bunch of people on Twitter talking about, oh, the proof of work chain, the proof of work chain. We're going to fork Ethereum and get all this extra tokens and extra no you're not. What's going to happen is that some people are already writing transactions right now that are going to be sent in that very first or second block on the Ethereum proof of work chain that sells all of their tokens for ether and uniswap. It removes all of their ether from compound and maker.
00:59:51.586 - 01:00:17.774, Speaker B: Basically, there's going to be a massive run on the bank, except the bank is proof of work ether. So every single token is going to go to zero. And there's actually a thread that we should read. So let's go to the thread by lemonscape and this is Mark Zeller from Ave and goes a short thread about ETH proof of work and what is quite likely to happen overnight with a fork. A carbon copy of the full Ethereum ecosystem appears you have ten eth. Well, you also have ten EtH proof of work. You have a position in Ave.
01:00:17.774 - 01:00:42.540, Speaker B: Now you have that same position on proof of work Ave. So let's begin with the big simple consequences. EtH proof of work means no proof of stake. So staked ETH is now worth zero because it'll never be redeemable because it's on the staked ETH chain on ave proof of work, that means there's a one point billion dollar hole in the book because Ave accounts for the value of staked ETH. But the proof of work, staked ETH goes to zero on maker proof of work, that's $100 million of die backed by zero.
01:00:42.910 - 01:00:44.266, Speaker A: Absolute mayhem, by the way.
01:00:44.288 - 01:01:07.314, Speaker B: That's absolute mayhem. Yeah. All of a sudden, all the collateral and all the lending apps goes to zero. You can't have any fiat backed stablecoin doubling the supply, obviously overnight. So USDC and USDT proof of work supply goes to zero. So also collateral in Makerdao and elsewhere, Circle and tether can perhaps later support ETH proof of work, but the only way is to issue new ERC 20 tokens and forget the old ones. That's an additional $1.7
01:01:07.314 - 01:01:42.554, Speaker B: billion hole in ave proofs of work. That also means that 73% of makerdao collateral overnight is worth zero. So sorry to say, but this means that die proof of work and MKR proof of work are now also worth zero, because MKR needs to get minted to cover debts in the makerdao system. But when your debt is billions of dollars and that brand new MKR token on the proof of work chain is already worth zero. So you have to inflate your token that's already worth zero by infinity, making it worth zero even more. And so just massive holes in collateral, because none of these tokens are worth anything on the proof of work chain.
01:01:42.602 - 01:01:49.098, Speaker A: Basically what's happening is the token ecosystem. The Defi app layer is going to be completely mayhem.
01:01:49.194 - 01:02:18.162, Speaker B: The application layer of the proof of work chain is dividing by zero. It is imploding on block number one. And so this also happens for, like, uniswap sushi swap all your private protocols. All tokens become worth zero because there's nothing there. And so if all the tokens are worth zero, what happens? And this is where the whole run on the bank metaphor comes from. The agenda for yes. Conclusion, defi proof of work is dead on arrival.
01:02:18.162 - 01:02:34.518, Speaker B: And so here's what Lemonsgate says. The agenda for EtH proof of work shills amm liquidity will still be around because there will be, like, uni versus eth pairs on the proof of work chain. But if you have any uni tokens, you're just going to remove them all and buy as much eth pow as possible. You have staked eth tokens.
01:02:34.614 - 01:02:38.238, Speaker A: Ethpow is the new ether. It's kind of the leftover ether, yes.
01:02:38.404 - 01:03:17.910, Speaker B: Unofficially, it's just what people are calling it. So do you have any staked eth tokens? Because those are worth zero. So you go to curve the proof of work curve, and you dump those for ethpow until amms are full of tokens and empty of proof of work ether. So all tokens are being immediately sold for ether, proof of work ether, because it's the only token that has any feasible semblance of having any value whatsoever. The plan is to collect as many eth proof of work tokens as possible while shilling it on Twitter as, like, the one true eth, because that's what people do. That's what opportunists do. And then they wait for tier C, centralized exchange listings like Poloniax, deposit it there, and then try and dump it on victims trying to buy this shill.
01:03:17.910 - 01:03:49.522, Speaker B: That's the plan. Everyone knows it. People have been talking about this for years. We've known this is going to be a thing for years. And so if you are a listener who's like, oh, yeah, I get, like, proof of work ether, I get some extra ether. Are you going to be the bot that writes these transactions? Because there's going to be a war on the first and second block of the proof of work ethereum chain to do all of these things, and it's all going to be over in two blocks. Are you, the listener, capable of fighting that fight and getting your transaction in first ahead of the bots? Because if you are not, then you are not getting anything.
01:03:49.522 - 01:03:51.014, Speaker B: That's the end of story.
01:03:51.212 - 01:03:53.494, Speaker A: I still think so, yes. That is one.
01:03:53.532 - 01:03:54.102, Speaker B: Get out of here.
01:03:54.156 - 01:03:55.430, Speaker A: Brian, what do you think?
01:03:55.500 - 01:03:56.454, Speaker B: What do you still think?
01:03:56.572 - 01:04:58.630, Speaker A: I still think that what could happen is some narrative spinner rises, know the Craig Wright of pow eth, the Roger ver, some religious figure, pow Jesus rises up and says, I will bring you a new narrative for this asset class. This is the true, and like, we've just seen this happen so many times. David? Yeah, there have been a lot of bitcoin forks previously. Most of them have completely failed, but a few of them have had some actual multi month, multi year shelf lives. And those are the ones that are led by kind of some benevolent dictator cult know, sort of religious figure that ultimately I don't know about in Roger Vera's case, but Craig Wright's case, very clearly manipulating the community and trying to kind of like exit exit scam exit dump them. I know it's more complicated than a bitcoin fork because Ethereum has this massive defi app layer, but as you said, that's going to sort itself out. It's going to be completely drained.
01:04:58.630 - 01:05:23.746, Speaker A: It's all going to go to Ethpow. There could be a figure that rises up and says, I'm going to take this narrative, I'm going to push it forward. I'm going to create a developer roadmap. I'm going to gather some funding. I'm going to get the help of ethpow miners, and the narrative could have a shelf life longer than a week, maybe multiple months. Again, I really don't care in either case. If that happens, then maybe there's some EtH POW I can later sell.
01:05:23.746 - 01:05:43.740, Speaker A: And that's a great thing. But all I would say is, I think that is also a possibility. It's a possibility this thing fades out in like a day or a week. It's also a possibility because we've seen it before. Some cult leader rises and brings a narrative to this chain and gives it some level of life because we've also seen that before.
01:05:44.670 - 01:05:47.110, Speaker B: Is that going to be you, Ryan? You're going to be that cult leader?
01:05:47.270 - 01:05:55.360, Speaker A: It's not from work, Ryan. It's not me. I mean, I do not have that will and no interest in doing that.
01:05:56.130 - 01:06:24.066, Speaker B: So there's a video that I like that I think resembles what's going to happen in blocks one and two of the proof of work chain. And here's a video of a San Diego Fire 4 July where they accidentally had like a computer exploit computer bug. And instead of having a 45 minutes fireworks show, every single firework just went off at once. So we had like 45 minutes worth of fireworks all going down in like 30 seconds. And that's basically what's going to happen to this proof of work app layer.
01:06:24.098 - 01:06:27.206, Speaker A: You think it's just going to be short, very short show, and then it's over.
01:06:27.308 - 01:06:27.574, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:06:27.612 - 01:06:28.986, Speaker A: David, what's coming up next?
01:06:29.088 - 01:06:52.366, Speaker B: All right, coming up next, sailor stepping down as CEO of microstrategy. To do what? To do what? Perhaps to buy more bitcoin, probably. And also Tiffany's selling cryptopunk jewelry. I have a cryptopunk. Will I be getting a Tiffany's cryptopunk necklace? Stay tuned to find out. But I think you already know. But if you don't stick around to find out, we'll be right back.
01:06:52.366 - 01:07:26.662, Speaker B: Right after we talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Arbitrum is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs. Some of the coolest new NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home, while DFI protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage. You can now bridge straight into arbitram from more than ten different exchanges, including finance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com. Once on Arbitrum, you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees, allowing you to explore new frontiers of the crypto universe. New to Arbitrum. For a limited time, you can get arbitram nfts, designed by the famous artists Ratwell and Sugoy for joining the Arbitrum Odyssey.
01:07:26.662 - 01:08:08.114, Speaker B: The Odyssey is an eight week long event where you complete on chain activities and receive a free NFT as a reward. Find out more by visiting the discord at Discord GG Arbitrum. You can also bridge your assets to Arbitrum at Bridge Arbitrum IO and access all of Arbitrum's apps at Portal Arbitrum one in order to experience DFI and NFTs the way it was always meant to be, fast, cheap, secure, and fiction free, the L2 era is upon us. Ethereum's L2 ecosystem is growing every day, and we need L2 bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live. A L2 life across is the fastest, cheapest, and most secure crosschain bridge with across. You don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously.
01:08:08.114 - 01:08:39.998, Speaker B: Across's bridges are powered by UmA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens between L2s and Ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across v two has just launched. Their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency, L2 to L2 transfers and a brand new chain with Polygon, all while prioritizing high security and low fees. You can be a part of across this story by joining their discord and using across for all of your L2 transferring needs. So go to across to quickly and securely bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, polygon, arbitram or Boba networks.
01:08:40.094 - 01:09:17.630, Speaker A: Alright, guys, we're back. And speaking of bridge compromises, again, Aave seems to be stepping back from its multi chain strategy. And why? Because of some of these bridge compromises that have been happening. So ave stepping back from Phantom, I believe, which is sort of an EVM fork chain. Mark Zeller we were just talking about said this. Yeah, lemonscape. The rationale is, after the Harmony bridge event, the recent Nomad bridge exploit, the Ave community should consider the risk benefits of keeping an active Ave V three market on Phantom, as this network is dependent on any swap multichain bridge.
01:09:17.630 - 01:09:42.850, Speaker A: Zeller actually in the tweet thread as well, he said he was wrong. He said, hey, I was wrong to be so aggressive on kind of the multichain strategy. And yeah, that was just really interesting to hear from him. It's like not wrong in a big way, but maybe a bit more aggressive during the bull market. And now seeing that, hey, some of these risks are real. And by the way, kudos to anyone who ever admits they're wrong in crypto.
01:09:42.930 - 01:09:44.710, Speaker B: Certainly because that is a rare event.
01:09:44.780 - 01:09:45.750, Speaker A: In and of itself.
01:09:45.900 - 01:10:11.854, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, basically this is a classic cost benefit calculation. How much fees is Ave generating on Phantom and how much is that risk of that multi chain Bridge and Aave governance? This isn't a formal thing. This is a governance proposal. But the proposal saying, hey, the cost of rewards is just not there. So let's just trim phantom. I mean, makes sense in a bear market where some chains don't really make it so phantom not doing so hot. All right, moving on.
01:10:11.854 - 01:10:40.482, Speaker B: Sushiswap. New head chef is asking for one third of all the tokens that are paid to the staff, which is a very contentious proposal. But there's a DaO debate with sushiswap about how well compensated the sushiswap head chef should be. I kind of think that sushiswap needs some sort of highly competent, highly centralized leader to kind of steward this ship, especially as we're seeing things kind of like drift off in the bear market. But sushi swap going through some governance debates right now.
01:10:40.556 - 01:10:44.602, Speaker A: That's like executive compensation debate in Daos right now. That's kind of interesting.
01:10:44.736 - 01:11:17.054, Speaker B: Here's a great thread out of optimism about optimism bedrock, which is optimism bedrock coming soon, TM. And when it does, it will change the roll up game forever. It will lay the protocol's foundation for years to come and serve as the model for roll up architecture. Its name is Bedrock for good reason. There are a few awesome things that this bedrock architecture does for optimism. It reduces the l one to l two, deposit time by four x, and it also slashes the cost of data submission by 20%, making fees 20% cheaper. But those are all really cool things that all the users can understand.
01:11:17.054 - 01:11:52.810, Speaker B: But really, the really bullish thing is this third thing cuts the difference with guess down to a slim 500 lines of code. And so Kevin Filtchner, who is on the optimism team, he puts this tweet together and goes. Optimism's bedrock design is the most advanced roll up architecture ever built. It's not a competition. Bedrock is close to theoretically optimal on every front. Optimal transaction fees, optimal diff difference, optimal networking, optimal block production. And what they are mean by optimal is related to this 500 fee difference between optimism, bedrock and geth.
01:11:52.810 - 01:12:46.066, Speaker B: They're trying to get as close to Ethereum equivalents as possible. And so when we talk about bridge risk and all these smart contract risks, when you reduce the lines of code down to something like Geth, which has been tried and true in Ethereum for eight years and running now, then you have stronger assurances that there's less and less attack surface area. And so when I see these words like theoretically optimal on every front, I get really hot and bothered, Ryan, because I love things that are theoretically optimal. And so the fewer lines between Geth and a L2, the more secure you can feel about using these L2s. And the other thing I'll say about this is when you have something that is closer and closer and closer to Geth, the software that we've already been using Ethereum for years, bedrock can become like a foundation for a thousand roll ups to bloom. Because it's not that complicated. It's so simple, it's so close to this infrastructure that we've already had.
01:12:46.066 - 01:12:54.194, Speaker B: So the fork ability of bedrock to allow 1000 secure L2s to bloom is like off the charts. So I'm just super bullish about that.
01:12:54.312 - 01:13:04.514, Speaker A: Yeah. I am glad that optimistic roll ups are innovating. And of course, Arbitrum's nitro is coming up too. So it's like bedrock versus nitro. And they're both kind of competing for attention.
01:13:04.562 - 01:13:10.166, Speaker B: And nitro also something that is trying to emulate guest as well. These are the same design structures.
01:13:10.278 - 01:13:20.958, Speaker A: Yeah, very similar design structures and patterns. And I'm just happy to see them wearing it out for users. David, did you know the theorem chain is seven years old? Happy birthday.
01:13:20.964 - 01:13:30.698, Speaker B: Happy birthday. Happy birthday to ethereum. Yay. Here's a picture of Vitalik and his dad, unrelated, actually, from ethereum's birthday.
01:13:30.794 - 01:13:36.026, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely related. Father, son. Sure, yeah. Great to see them on something's birthday.
01:13:36.138 - 01:13:54.630, Speaker B: Moving some bitcoin stuff. Yeah. Michael Saylor leaves the CEO role to assume executive chairman role. So Michael Saylor, no longer the CEO of microstrategy, has stepped down, while a different individual stepped into the CEO of microstrategy, which makes sense.
01:13:54.780 - 01:14:04.586, Speaker A: I mean, he's become so interested in bitcoin, he's much less interested in. Microstrategy is a business analytics company, kind of software for business dashboards, things that.
01:14:04.608 - 01:14:06.154, Speaker B: Are unrelated to bitcoin. Yeah.
01:14:06.272 - 01:14:26.318, Speaker A: So he's very interested in bitcoin. He has, like 70% voting majority over microstrategy. So basically he governs microstrategy now. Has decided to step down to pursue bitcoin initiatives to buy more bitcoin. I guess that's what he's doing. There's a take from Naseem Taleb here. What is he saying?
01:14:26.404 - 01:14:42.854, Speaker B: Yeah. Naseem Taleb, who's famously anti bitcoin, says, how much of the 120,000 bitcoin will they have to sell? Another nail in the coffin to the will never sell. I actually don't think there's any precedent. No. Actually, they're leaning into buying bitcoin, not trying to sell, but it's just microstrategy. Microstrategy, yeah.
01:14:42.892 - 01:14:49.890, Speaker A: You don't think sailor was kind of, like, asked to leave or something and go focus on bitcoin, if that's what he's so interested in?
01:14:49.980 - 01:15:04.842, Speaker B: I think that is what happened. They're like, sailor, like, this microstrategy company still needs to do its microstrategy things. You become like, the chairman of buying Bitcoin CEO. Yeah, but no, Nicholas just wants a grave dance, even though there's no grave to dance on.
01:15:04.896 - 01:15:05.226, Speaker A: We'll see.
01:15:05.248 - 01:15:06.070, Speaker B: Anyway, I don't know.
01:15:06.160 - 01:15:31.640, Speaker A: They might sell more bitcoin as a result of this, but hopefully not in the bear. Still, I still contend, I think Microstrategy's bitcoin buys are going to pay off for them and these kind of tweets will not hold up well because bitcoin is going to go up in price as to the bottom line, to me. And just people are impatient and they always like to point when things are down and say, oh, it'll never work out. And then they never come back and correct themselves. But Tiffany's, what are they doing in the NFT space?
01:15:32.090 - 01:15:56.526, Speaker B: They are doing NF tiffs, NF Tiffany's, I guess. Releasing on August 5. Is that tomorrow? Yeah, that is tomorrow. 250, I believe. Tiffany's cryptopunk NFT necklaces, jeweled necklaces are being released at the low, low price of 30 e. 250 limited edition cryptopunk necklaces being sold for $51,000 at the.
01:15:56.548 - 01:15:59.470, Speaker A: Price of 30 e. What's a cryptopunk necklace?
01:16:00.050 - 01:16:02.640, Speaker B: Yeah. So here's the video. It'll play out.
01:16:05.170 - 01:16:06.962, Speaker A: Wait, how much is this? What are we looking at?
01:16:07.016 - 01:16:08.420, Speaker B: $51,000.
01:16:09.110 - 01:16:11.986, Speaker A: So, like a bunch of. Just an NFT. So you can't have.
01:16:12.008 - 01:16:14.302, Speaker B: No, it's a real necklace. It's a real necklace.
01:16:14.366 - 01:16:15.538, Speaker A: It's a real necklace.
01:16:15.634 - 01:16:18.470, Speaker B: Oh, this is a real necklace. Real diamonds, real rubies.
01:16:18.890 - 01:16:21.000, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a real NFT part.
01:16:22.970 - 01:16:31.814, Speaker B: You can't mint any cryptopunk. You can have Tiffany's necklace of your crypto punk for 30 e. Is this.
01:16:31.852 - 01:16:34.694, Speaker A: Something that is wanted? Like, what's the market for this, David?
01:16:34.822 - 01:16:47.134, Speaker B: Well, there's only 250 of them. And it's one of these things where if you are somebody who's going to buy one of these things, you're going to confuse all the other people who are like, why the hell are you buying it? It only takes 250 people to be like, yeah, fine, I'll buy one of those.
01:16:47.252 - 01:16:48.720, Speaker A: $50,000.
01:16:49.170 - 01:17:03.070, Speaker B: Here's a take from Aubrey Strobel. Imagine your boyfriend gives you a Tiffany box and you open it up and it's a crypto punk. I'm sure that they would just love that. That would be so great for them. I'm sure they would just be overjoyed.
01:17:03.150 - 01:17:09.810, Speaker A: There's someone out there, though, that's going to buy one and be happy to receive. 1 may just have to find that special someone, David.
01:17:09.890 - 01:17:12.646, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. All right, keep on looking.
01:17:12.828 - 01:17:18.834, Speaker A: Magic Eden. Oh, my God. They changed their twitter handle to magic Ethan. First of all, what is magic Eden?
01:17:18.882 - 01:17:30.300, Speaker B: And it's a Solana NFT platform. It's like the open sea of Solana. What are they doing? They are now becoming the magic Eden of Ethereum. So they are integrating Ethereum into their NFT platform.
01:17:31.070 - 01:17:35.734, Speaker A: Seems like wise expansion strategy. Yep. What do we got? Shaq.
01:17:35.782 - 01:18:03.400, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. So this is like, of course, I'm sure triggered some of the Solani Maxis out there. I was like, oh, you guys are abandoning Solana to go into Ethereum, even though they are just trying to make the best NFT platform that exists. And Shaq replies to the tweet, Shaquille O'Neill replies to the suite and says, and people wonder why I took Dot soul out of my name. I didn't even know Shaq had dot soul in his name. Ryan commenting saying, but you didn't add dot eth 1700 likes on that.
01:18:03.400 - 01:18:08.546, Speaker B: Shaq wearing what it looks like some sort of like ape as his profile picture.
01:18:08.578 - 01:18:12.534, Speaker A: What do you think he's saying? This is not clear to me. Why did he take soul out of his name?
01:18:12.572 - 01:18:27.040, Speaker B: Is it because you can scroll down and there will be a little bit more of a conversation? He says, there's no point in picking a side anymore. Everyone needs to stop tearing, bring each other down. And then Evan van Ness says, no one needs to tear Solana down. It's always down.
01:18:29.410 - 01:18:33.898, Speaker A: Bird culture in crypto, Twitter is great. What's rainbow doing? The wallet. NFT wallet.
01:18:33.914 - 01:18:52.594, Speaker B: Yeah. Speaking more NFT stuff now supporting NFTs on Mainnet, polygon, arbitrum and optimism for some reason saying, thank you, treasure Dow for the gift. I wonder. Oh, they got a little, some small. The treasure Dow is an ecosystem. NFT ecosystem on arbitrum. Anyways, NFTs on rainbow wallet.
01:18:52.722 - 01:19:03.670, Speaker A: That's cool. Optimistic. NFTs arbitram. NFTs on Rainbow Wallet. And what do we got here? Aspect Starknet. Mainnet. Is this NFTs for Starknet?
01:19:03.750 - 01:19:12.466, Speaker B: Yeah, NFTs on Starknet. The generalized ZK roll up platform out of starkware. So cool. That means super cheap nfTs.
01:19:12.518 - 01:19:31.986, Speaker A: Super cheap, super fast regulation. Let's talk about this really quick. So Robin Hood was just fined $30 million from the New York state Department of Financial Services NYDFs. And why were they charged for this? It looks like some sort of money laundering issue. What did they do?
01:19:32.088 - 01:19:54.182, Speaker B: Yeah, they said the NYDFs charged Robinhood because they were inadequately staffed, didn't have sufficient resources to address risks, and failed timely transaction from a manual transaction monitoring system to one that was adequate for its user size. And transaction volume basically not adequately monitoring like AML and money laundering shenanigans.
01:19:54.326 - 01:20:20.302, Speaker A: I have no takes on this kind of know. New York State Department's always a know crypto unfriendly, I would say. So I wouldn't be surprised if they're blowing a big small thing out of proportion. But also, I do not know. But this is cool. David. A senate bill that would hand bitcoin and ether oversight to the commodities regulator, the CFTC basically institute by law and say that ether and bitcoin are commodities.
01:20:20.302 - 01:20:42.218, Speaker A: It's kind of reigning. Gary Gensler and the SEC back. I know the SEC has never given us a super straight take on whether ether is a commodity or a security or how they view it. They've been a bit more clear on bitcoin as being a commodity, but we sort of need this legislation. It's a bit of reigning in from the SEC to at least say these two assets we know clearly are commodities, right?
01:20:42.304 - 01:21:01.230, Speaker B: And this follows from, I think, Hester purse and a few others takes of saying, like, good crypto regulation is ultimately going to come from Congress, not these three letter agencies that we do not elect. And so if Congress could go ahead and please approve this one, that would be great. Gary Gensler. Nina. Nina, boo boo. Get your hands off our commodities.
01:21:02.210 - 01:21:10.450, Speaker A: And yet I gotta give credit where it's due. The SEC this week charged a group called forsage.
01:21:11.110 - 01:21:12.174, Speaker B: Forsage. Forsage.
01:21:12.222 - 01:21:26.774, Speaker A: Forsage. Forsage. I don't know forsage. This was a 300 billion dollar crypto Ponzi scheme. And I vaguely remember this. It was just blatantly a ponzi kind of bit connect level stuff. And this is the sort of thing that we want the SEC to do.
01:21:26.774 - 01:21:48.590, Speaker A: It's like there's so many bad guys and clear scams in the crypto space. Please help us go catch them. Go after them. Give us clarity. Give the good actors in the space sandbox a playground and go chase after the clear scammers because there's enough of that work to go do. And this is an example of them doing that, doing the right thing, going after a clear Ponzi scheme. Well done.
01:21:48.590 - 01:21:56.306, Speaker A: Thank you, Gary. You did something great. David, can you believe this is still an insult to injury, what's happening here.
01:21:56.408 - 01:22:05.826, Speaker B: Celsius admits customer emails linked in third party data breach. So not only did you lose your money, but you also lost your privacy with Celsius. Two for one punch.
01:22:05.938 - 01:22:06.774, Speaker A: Thanks, guys.
01:22:06.892 - 01:22:25.866, Speaker B: Babel Finance, $280,000,000 loss. Babel Finance is a CFI crypto lender. We've seen them before, lost $280,000,000 in customer funds doing trading. They were trying to trade their way into profit, but they traded their way into losses with their customers funds with their customers fund.
01:22:25.888 - 01:22:39.454, Speaker A: Another CFI company more popular in Asia. David, some good news on the releases front. Coinbase prime is now offering Ethereum staking to institutions in the US. More staking heating up. What is the swell network here?
01:22:39.492 - 01:23:17.894, Speaker B: David yeah, swell Network is also part of the Ethereum staking world, Lido, rocket pool, stakewise, a few others, but also swell network soon. This is kind of a hotly anticipated staking as a service like Dao, kind of like Lido, but also a little bit like rocket pool. Mainnet release candidate is now live, which means that they are only one step away from Mainnet. Go live. So I'm very excited for swell. Also, we know that GameStop has been working with immutable, but now that relationship is formally intertwined with the GameStop wallet. And so the GameStop NFT ecosystem and the immutable L2 system are now integrated.
01:23:17.894 - 01:23:26.430, Speaker B: And so you can only imagine that the immutable x L2 is going to be facilitating the marketplace for GameStop. Getting a little bit closer to that here.
01:23:26.580 - 01:23:33.534, Speaker A: I think the wallet has been based on loop ring, so it looks like they're using multiple L2s as their strategy. Not just loop ring, but also both.
01:23:33.572 - 01:23:34.706, Speaker B: ZK roll ups, though.
01:23:34.808 - 01:23:42.050, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. David on the raises front variant fund, this is a fund from Jesse.
01:23:42.870 - 01:23:45.406, Speaker B: Who else is on the Jesse Walden Legion?
01:23:45.518 - 01:24:07.450, Speaker A: Yes, Legion, of course. $450,000,000 to support the leading founders in web3. This is kind of the creator economy type of investment, and they just raised $450,000,000. So impressive raise. Gary Vee from v friends just closed around with a 16 z crypto. So this is a $50 million round, I believe.
01:24:07.520 - 01:24:08.330, Speaker B: That's a lot of money.
01:24:08.400 - 01:24:20.218, Speaker A: That's a lot for Gary Vee's NFT project. Yeah, kind of impressive valuations happening during the bear market still too. So I guess there's money, there's raises. What does that mean for jobs, David?
01:24:20.314 - 01:24:24.122, Speaker B: That there are jobs? If there's money and there's raises, then there are jobs.
01:24:24.266 - 01:24:33.774, Speaker A: What are we talking about here? Let me read a few out. The first from boardroom Labs, they're looking for a software engineer over Dow governance, Manticore Games, a manager of crypto marketing.
01:24:33.822 - 01:24:34.750, Speaker B: That's not technical.
01:24:34.910 - 01:24:49.814, Speaker A: We're looking for thread. You can write a good Twitter thread. Yeah, like as we are but apparently we don't have time to write enough threads. Vertex protocol. A marketing coordinator that's not technical. Bankless. We're looking for a UX UI designer.
01:24:49.814 - 01:24:52.534, Speaker A: Bankless. Also, we need a senior newsletter engineer.
01:24:52.582 - 01:24:54.102, Speaker B: Job in crypto streams.
01:24:54.166 - 01:25:00.934, Speaker A: A financial analyst. Steakfish smart contract software engineer. Also a backend software engineer. Also a blockchain marketer.
01:25:00.982 - 01:25:01.574, Speaker B: Non technical.
01:25:01.622 - 01:25:08.026, Speaker A: Also a DevOps engineer. And the bankless academy is hiring a product manager. There's a ton more jobs here. You can go find them at the bank.
01:25:08.058 - 01:25:19.810, Speaker B: Wait, there's a head of marketing at Pleaser Dow. I just want to shout that one out. Also got to be a very, very cool job. $100 to $200,000 salary. Head of marketing at Pleaser Dow. Come join the Dow.
01:25:20.230 - 01:25:29.346, Speaker A: A Willy Wonka pleaser Dow is the people's Louvre. And the 21st century and a Willy Wonka factory combined, it's very attractive.
01:25:29.378 - 01:25:31.250, Speaker B: Only in crypto. Only in crypto.
01:25:31.330 - 01:25:49.580, Speaker A: All right, when we get back, some questions from the bankless nation. What's the safest token to dollar cost average into over the next twelve months? Also, the best advice for actually getting a job in crypto and some hot takes from crypto, Twitter. As usual, we'll get right to those things. But first, we want to tell you about the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:25:49.950 - 01:26:30.102, Speaker B: There is a brand new staking feature in the ledger live app. Today, we all like staking the assets that we're bullish on, and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app, Cosmos, Polkadot Tron algorithm, Tezos Solana, and of course, Ethereum. With Ledger Live, you can take money from your bank account, buy your most bullish crypto asset, and stake that asset to its network all inside the Ledger Live app, through a partnership with Figment Ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with. And Ledger is running its own validating node, offering a convenient way to participate in network validation. And it even comes with slashing insurance. Ledger Live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world. So go download Ledger Live.
01:26:30.102 - 01:27:07.806, Speaker B: If you have a ledger already, you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets the Brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 Internet with over 60 million monthly active users. And inside the Brave browser, you'll find the Brave wallet, the secure, multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser. Web three is freedom from big tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy. But there's a weak point in web3. Your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed. But the brave wallet is different, no extensions are required, which gives Brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets. Brave Wallet is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains including Ethereum and Salana.
01:27:07.806 - 01:27:26.870, Speaker B: You can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp. And of course you can store, send and swap your crypto assets, manage your NFTs, and connect to other wallets and defi apps. So whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro, it's time to ditch those risky extensions and it's time to switch to the brave wallet. Download Brave@brave.com slash bankless and click the wallet icon to get started.
01:27:26.940 - 01:27:57.774, Speaker A: Alright guys, we are back. And just a reminder, if you have a question for Dave to read out on the roll up, make sure you follow bankless hq on Twitter. Every Wednesday tweet goes out and asks for those questions. Here's the first question from Madge 80 E if you had to monthly dollar cost average into one asset for the next twelve months, what would it be? Except eth? I'm thinking RPL. That's the rocket pool token and Uni of course. Got to say, none of this is financial advice. Asking David's personal opinion from an entertainment perspective.
01:27:57.774 - 01:27:58.590, Speaker A: Entertaining myself.
01:27:58.680 - 01:28:01.734, Speaker B: Entertaining answer, yes, I want the real.
01:28:01.772 - 01:28:07.026, Speaker A: Answer, but also it's fine if it's entertaining. David, I actually genuinely want to know what would you buy besides eth?
01:28:07.058 - 01:28:43.250, Speaker B: Right know, I think Madge is to something with uni. I think that is, if we're not talking about ether and we're not counting staked ether, which I'm assuming we're not, then the uni token definitely comes next. And the reason why it's, I feel like very arguably the safest is because it's generating the most fees. And so that I feel like is a great definition of safety. Like right now, Uniswap generated one point million dollars today in 24 hours fees. And there's already discussions on the Uniswap governance forum about turning on the fee switch. So we're getting there.
01:28:43.250 - 01:29:24.382, Speaker B: And so if we're going to define what is the best asset for the next twelve months to buy, it's the one with fees. The ones that come after that, like Ave GMX, also surprisingly up there. And so tokens with fees are bullish. And so there's probably some analysis to be done about how much fees is the protocol generating compared to how big that market cap is with a controlling function of how much percentage can that protocol capture as a result of those fees. Some analysis to be done there. Rocket pool, great token because the merge trade. But is the merge trade going to last for twelve months? I'm not sure, but Uniswap fees will definitely last for twelve months.
01:29:24.516 - 01:29:56.618, Speaker A: Yeah, I kind of agree. So it's like I'm going to ignore bitcoin because I actually think I would still prioritize dFI tokens right now over bitcoin. And maybe that's for the first time ever. Generally my answer is Ethan, bitcoin. Those are the assets to dollar cost average into. But if you're going to ask my personal opinion, it would probably be some of those blue chip defi assets. I like Uni and Ave know they're going to be around very strong, although I also like a lot of the strong L2 projects that have tokens right now.
01:29:56.618 - 01:30:31.202, Speaker A: I feel like that's a decent bet and I would pick those over the alternative layer one bet, even though like, oh God, yeah, Salon is going to survive. Obviously cosmos, they are all going to survive, but I still feel like L2 is being underappreciated. So you got matic token, you got op some of those things as well. I would consider dollar cost averaging into some of those as well. But this isn't necessarily the question that's like what's the asset that you're going to make the most money on over the next twelve months? This is more the one that you're going to kind of buy and hold. Yeah. From a risk reward perspective.
01:30:31.202 - 01:30:31.814, Speaker A: Good question.
01:30:31.852 - 01:30:59.278, Speaker B: I do think that even RPL and Lido and stakewise are all benefiting from the merge trade. I think General DFI tokens that like Uniswap and synthetics are also going to benefit from. Just like the beta of the merge, like ether goes up staking as a service, tokens goes up. But then Ethereum apps are also going to go up. It's going to be like an Ethereum rotation. So I think the beta is in heavily favorite of the Ethereum ecosystem at the moment.
01:30:59.364 - 01:31:19.750, Speaker A: Yeah, I would say that too. And I do like some of those staking tokens as well. I'd start to classify them as close to blue chip. All right, here's another question, David, from Patrick Dudley. What advice would you give a college student looking to get a job in crypto after they graduate? I'm going to my senior year at SDSU and really want to pursue a career in crypto. Yeah, definitely.
01:31:19.820 - 01:31:47.466, Speaker B: The unequivocally best advice for getting a job in crypto. If you want to get a job, the formula is as simple as this. Write really good threads on Twitter. People are doing this. If you want to get a job at a fund, funds will notice you on Twitter. If you want to get a job at bankless, we are literally hiring a tweet thread, or people that can write threads and get like a thousand likes and just generate a following and capture attention on Twitter. If you can do that, you will be handed a job on a silver platter.
01:31:47.498 - 01:31:54.994, Speaker A: Okay. So for people who aren't on Twitter, though, what does it take to actually write a thread? David, what does a thread do on Twitter? Right.
01:31:55.032 - 01:32:34.018, Speaker B: So it distills information down. And the reason why Twitter is what it is in this crypto space is that it forces big ideas to be condensed and collapsed and concentrated down into a very short, single tweet, 280 characters. And so what you are doing when you are writing a tweet thread is you are learning how to communicate and explain things with extremely small packages. And so that's just good, efficient communication. So it's basically like a litmus test for can you communicate very, very well if you can thread well? You can communicate well if you can communicate well, that's like the meta skill. And so people are judging other people's abilities to do good work by their ability to write threads.
01:32:34.134 - 01:32:49.154, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm going to. Plus one that also forces you to go digest some complicated information and break it down atomically. So you have to really understand it if you're going to publish a thread. And then, of course, because Twitter is a social network, it's basically your online resume. You can tweet people and be like.
01:32:49.192 - 01:32:51.470, Speaker B: Yeah, get off of LinkedIn, get onto Twitter.
01:32:51.550 - 01:33:09.186, Speaker A: Totally. That's where crypto is. That's where you get noticed. I've seen so many people launch their careers by doing that, is becoming threatened, and you start to write in other areas, or you get hired by VC company or whatever your main skill set is. That's a way to launch.
01:33:09.298 - 01:33:20.570, Speaker B: Both me and like launched our public personas on Twitter. And then we found each other on Twitter, and then we started bankless on Twitter, and now we're hiring tweet Twitter.
01:33:21.310 - 01:33:41.822, Speaker A: There's just such serendipity to it. You got to be part of it. You can't ignore Twitter right now. All right, David, let's get to some takes. First from is, I'm going to read it out from Bellaji Srinavasan, actually, podcast episode coming with him on Monday. That is a do not miss episode. We talk about concepts like this, but here's what he's tweeting.
01:33:41.822 - 01:34:04.182, Speaker A: The realigning from red versus blue to orange versus green, decentralized network versus centralized state, internationalists and capitalists versus nationalists and socialists, the cloud versus the land, and bitcoin versus the dollar. And he's showing that political compass square. Maybe you can describe this image for us, what we're seeing here, David.
01:34:04.246 - 01:34:47.826, Speaker B: Yeah, the political compass is on the left you have the left. On the right, you have the right. So liberals on the left, conservatives on the right politically, but top to down, you have authoritarianism versus libertarianism. And so we've always said on bankless, bankless isn't a left or right movement, but it is an individual versus authoritarian movement. So we lean down towards the libertarian side of things. Although we do appreciate structure, it's definitely like prioritizing the individual over the state. And so what bloggy is saying is that what is previously like a red versus blue, left versus right phenomenon is slowly turning into a 99% versus 1%, which he's resembling as bitcoin versus the dollar.
01:34:47.826 - 01:35:14.638, Speaker B: The dollar being the state, bitcoin being the people. And so I think that makes sense, especially as we've been putting this into a context of the end of a cycle of nation state power where the nation state is no longer concerned about, do we want to be conservative or do we want to be progressive? We are now just like, all right, who's capturing all the value? Is it the individual or is it the incumbents? And so instead of left versus right, Belaji saying it's top versus down.
01:35:14.724 - 01:35:34.566, Speaker A: Yeah. And this goes into his idea, a book he recently come up with that we talk about at length, is a book called the network State. And he's really pinning this as it's kind of the authoritarian nation state versus the people's network state. Anyway, really fascinating conversation with him. Stay tuned for that on Monday. David, a tweet from Sassel, Anthony Sasana. What's he saying?
01:35:34.668 - 01:35:53.500, Speaker B: Yeah, first he says, first L2s won't work and are useless technology. And now it's if L2s get big enough, it will become its own layer one and abandon ethereum. If this is the first time you've heard this take, it means you need to get on Twitter. And Sazwell finishes saying, when you see the goalposts move like this, it means the critics never actually knew what they were talking about in the first place.
01:35:54.270 - 01:36:26.454, Speaker A: Do you know what this also means? I think the rotators are rotating into L2, or they're getting ready to, and that's why they're seeding this as the next kind of narrative. I think the alt one trade is somewhat dormant right now, somewhat over for the time being. And now the l two narrative trade is on. So what do you have to do? You have to prop up L2s and their value accrual mechanisms from a narrative perspective and put down eth in order to get that trade going. So I think they'll probably be effective. And I'm starting to see some of the rotators rotate in.
01:36:26.572 - 01:36:28.114, Speaker B: Of course, rotators going to rotate.
01:36:28.162 - 01:36:35.978, Speaker A: Always going to miss Suzu in 3 hours. Capital. The alternate rotators. Not going to happen this cycle, though. This is a Vitalik tweet. What's he saying?
01:36:36.064 - 01:36:51.882, Speaker B: Yeah, Vitalik says call out scammers. You get hate in the moment, but time vindicates you, even if you're some CEO with quote, reputation and need for, quote, professionalism. Do it anyways and be savage. People look up to you and your warning will be taken seriously.
01:36:51.946 - 01:36:53.754, Speaker A: Is this Vitalik speaking? Be savage.
01:36:53.802 - 01:37:19.398, Speaker B: This is Vitalik? Yeah, be savage. So Vitalik called out the force age people, the people that just got charged with the Sec forever, and then he got attacked, probably. I think this is a chinese community, chinese project, maybe, I don't know, which is why I didn't really hear about it. But he said he's alluding to how he got attacked by the force age community. Probably. But now they're being charged with running a Ponzi scheme. So who's laughing in the end?
01:37:19.484 - 01:37:26.570, Speaker A: He said this about forsage back in 2020. Please leave and don't pollute the ethereum ecosystem in the future. Thank you.
01:37:26.720 - 01:37:27.660, Speaker B: Thank you.
01:37:28.190 - 01:37:40.938, Speaker A: Very metallic thing to say. What do you think about this? Is it incumbent on the community to call out scammers more often? One thing I struggle with about this, David, is sometimes the term scammer gets overused.
01:37:41.034 - 01:37:41.534, Speaker B: Right.
01:37:41.652 - 01:38:14.940, Speaker A: I think in this case it was very clearly a scammer. So maybe when something is very clearly kind of black in the black category and there's no gray about it, that's the time to pile on. But it was not clear to me, for example, if we start putting like Luna and terra into that category, whether Luna and terra was a complete scam. At the time, I thought it was like a flawed mechanic and a very risky, broken thing to invest into, and I didn't think it would work long term. But I can't necessarily call that a scam. I don't think that Vitalik is talking about that category of things, is he?
01:38:15.870 - 01:38:42.218, Speaker B: I think so. It was definitely one of the things that I learned out of 2020 is that my intuitions are better than I thought they were. And so I got into that fight with Danny Sesta from Wonderland, and then his army descended on me and made me put my tail between my legs because of Twitter drama. And then he blew up. And if I had a little bit more confidence and conviction, it's like, yo, this is not right. I maybe would have said something. Same thing with Doe.
01:38:42.218 - 01:39:00.626, Speaker B: Kwan just repeated it. It's like, got attacked by do. Kwan's like, damn, their army's really loud. I don't really want to pick my head up. And then boom, they blow up. And if I had a little bit more of just like, I don't really give a fuck about you, I'm going to be proven right in the long term, then I think I would have gotten more credit than we did. Even though we did call out terror.
01:39:00.626 - 01:39:03.306, Speaker B: I think decently, I think we could have done it right.
01:39:03.328 - 01:39:29.870, Speaker A: So maybe David's going to lean into that a little bit more. I'm still probably going to veer a bit more conservative. I think Vitalik's right for calling out something like this, but sometimes I am not. Like the mechanic does actually work in the long run. Anyway, I think there's time for me, at least me personally, like a period of skepticism before I start using the s word. But then there are things that are very clearly scammed. For example, Celsius.
01:39:29.870 - 01:39:38.354, Speaker A: Some people are saying Celsius was a scam. I just didn't have enough information to know whether it was or right. But like, it turns out it was. I don't know, stuff like that. There's a lot in the gray area.
01:39:38.392 - 01:39:42.338, Speaker B: Celsius is a scam. I thought. Celsius is egregiously mismanaged.
01:39:42.514 - 01:39:49.170, Speaker A: I think that verges on scam of like, Alex Machinsky calling himself a defi bank and then calling himself.
01:39:49.250 - 01:39:53.260, Speaker B: Yeah, right. Yes. Calling himself Defi and not a banker. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.
01:39:54.110 - 01:40:07.674, Speaker A: All right, take from me, I say this. It's true. People don't care about decentralization. There's a lot of talk about that this week. A lot of talk about people not caring about decentralization. And I said, it's true. People don't care about decentralization.
01:40:07.674 - 01:40:27.190, Speaker A: People don't care about decentralization until they get Mount Gox or Suzu or Doe Kwan or machinskied. They don't care because they're new and haven't been screwed yet. Eventually, people care about decentralization. When I got into crypto very beginning, I didn't care very much about decentralization. You know what I cared about, David? Number go up.
01:40:27.260 - 01:40:28.166, Speaker B: Number go.
01:40:28.348 - 01:41:00.350, Speaker A: Like I cared about other things, this idea of know sovereign money. But I didn't understand the intricacies of why decentralization matters until I started to see things in the crypto space, read about the Mount Gox, see kind of the centralization vectors. And I do think people start to care about it over time, but they don't start with that position as their default. They have to kind of learn it sometimes by being in crypto for a period of time, of course, as one does. What's my take? What's yours?
01:41:00.930 - 01:41:14.018, Speaker B: This is my take last week, but here's my take. The best thing that could ever happen to crypto, a fees driven bull market, aka a sustainable and rational bull market. Is that like, too much to ask? Is a rational bull market?
01:41:14.184 - 01:41:15.966, Speaker A: Why is that more rational?
01:41:16.158 - 01:41:29.878, Speaker B: Because if it's fees driven, it means it's revenue driven. I mean, if it's revenue driven, this is how we've been measuring assets since the beginning of time, is fundamentals. It's asking for a fundamentals driven bull market. Can we have one of those, please?
01:41:29.964 - 01:41:31.638, Speaker A: Real people are paying for the service?
01:41:31.724 - 01:41:31.926, Speaker B: Yes.
01:41:31.948 - 01:41:38.298, Speaker A: And it's actually providing real profit, not based on speculation. Owners of the asset. Yeah, that would be pretty healthy. That would feel pretty good.
01:41:38.384 - 01:41:43.690, Speaker B: I would like that. You think we're going to get it? Can I have this, please? Is it that crazy?
01:41:43.760 - 01:41:47.582, Speaker A: David only wants one thing for Christmas driven bull market.
01:41:47.716 - 01:41:51.070, Speaker B: Some people think it's cringe, Ryan, that we read out our own tweets as takes of the.
01:41:51.220 - 01:41:51.870, Speaker A: Really?
01:41:52.020 - 01:41:56.286, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, maybe some people think it's whatever we do is should I should read.
01:41:56.308 - 01:41:58.126, Speaker A: Out your tweets and. You read out my tweets?
01:41:58.318 - 01:41:59.586, Speaker B: That's what we usually do. Yeah.
01:41:59.608 - 01:42:02.722, Speaker A: And they're called takes of the week. So we have takes sometimes.
01:42:02.856 - 01:42:04.850, Speaker B: Yeah. I feel like we have good takes.
01:42:04.920 - 01:42:09.266, Speaker A: Sorry for the cringe, guys. Ootie, I'm sorry for the cringe, David.
01:42:09.378 - 01:42:10.898, Speaker B: People don't know that metaphor.
01:42:10.994 - 01:42:12.678, Speaker A: What are you excited about this week?
01:42:12.844 - 01:42:30.842, Speaker B: I'm excited for tokens, Ryan. There's a bunch of tokens that, this is my coin gecko watch list. And so these are the tokens I'm currently looking at. And there's a bunch of them that are up bigly stakewise, up 107% in seven days. Optimism up 90%. Euler up 69%. Nice yearn up 51%.
01:42:30.842 - 01:42:51.090, Speaker B: Again, about fees. GMX up 42%. I don't own any of that, but perhaps I should look into how much fees it's making, because it's making a bunch of fees. Rocket pool and lido both up 32 and 37%. Immutable x a L2, up 30%. Uniswap, up 10%. I just feel like it's east maxi token season right now, and it's just making feel really good.
01:42:51.090 - 01:43:07.640, Speaker B: And there's like almost an oxymoron about EtH maxi token season, because if you're an EtH maxi, then you only buy Eth. But that's not exactly true, because if you're an ETH maxi, quote unquote, then you also must believe in the tokens in the ecosystem. So when I see all of these tokens that are heavily aligned with the Ethereum protocol going up, I'm like, nice.
01:43:09.050 - 01:43:17.546, Speaker A: How much of these would you sell eth for in order to get in, though? That's the harder part, right? Fiat's easy, but which of these are going to continue to go up in ethnominated terms?
01:43:17.648 - 01:43:18.362, Speaker B: It's always hard.
01:43:18.416 - 01:43:19.354, Speaker A: That's the hard part.
01:43:19.472 - 01:43:21.082, Speaker B: It's always hard. I don't know.
01:43:21.216 - 01:43:23.690, Speaker A: Ever. I get to that point, I'm like, I don't want to sell my eth.
01:43:24.450 - 01:43:25.982, Speaker B: Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:43:26.116 - 01:44:10.326, Speaker A: I am bullish on the Ethereum roadmap. So we obviously have, like, if you zoom out, we have the merge coming up, right? That's an economic upgrade. So we get 90% issuance reduction, more security. We talked about that. Our discussion with polenia around EIP 4844 this past week made me excited about kind of the next upgrade of Ethereum. So first we have an economic upgrade with the merge, but hopefully, fingers crossed, the hard fork after that we'll get something like EIP 4844, which makes roll ups 1000 x cheaper. Potentially when you add all of the roll up compression techniques with EIP 4844, you get 1000 x cheaper roll ups.
01:44:10.326 - 01:44:48.070, Speaker A: This, according to Polenia, that's big. So we got, first an economic upgrade. Yeah, and then we got a scalability upgrade. And then, David, we just had a conversation with Stefan from flashbots this week about meV. That's maximum extractable value mitigations, and that is kicking in right after the merge. It's a long story, but flashbots has a project called MeV Boost that all validators will use. That also generates more returns for anyone who uses it as a staker but I'm actually really excited about the mev protection that's going to be baked into Ethereum at the protocol level as well.
01:44:48.070 - 01:45:13.870, Speaker A: This is called protocol builder separation PBS, and that is coming sometime after EIP 4844 in the future. All this to say, I've probably never been more excited about the Ethereum roadmap. And the reason I'm most excited is because I feel like we finally got our shit together on it actually defined. There was a while where, honestly, Ethereum didn't have it together from a road very long perspective.
01:45:14.850 - 01:45:16.910, Speaker B: Late 2019 was when it finally came together.
01:45:16.980 - 01:45:39.954, Speaker A: Yeah, we didn't have kind of, the monetary policy was like, I don't know, we'll wait for proof of stake. We have that figured out with a merge, scalability, I don't know, plasma state channels. What's it going to be? No. Now we have a path roll up centric roadmap, EIP 4844. That's within sight. How are we going to solve this mev problem? Mev boost PBS. The roadmap is looking good these days.
01:45:39.954 - 01:45:41.226, Speaker A: I'm pretty bullish on it.
01:45:41.328 - 01:46:19.266, Speaker B: Yeah, it's looking good. And it also makes fundamental sense, kind of like going back to Kelvin Finchner was saying about the theoretical maximum. There are things about the Ethereum roadmap, the design philosophy, that is just like the theoretical best way to execute on that idea. And I don't have enough time to go into that right now, but I'll tease an article that I think is coming out next week, which is what you're alluding to, which is about the blockchain supply chain, as in how a block becomes produced on Ethereum and where the value goes in that supply chain and how it ultimately always converges down to eth stakers. I think we are bullish on the same thing, brother.
01:46:19.378 - 01:46:22.566, Speaker A: All right, what's the meme of the week? This week, what are we looking at?
01:46:22.668 - 01:46:33.414, Speaker B: Meme of the week. Meme of the week is a Top gun poster, Top Gun maverick. But instead we got Nancy Pelosi in this f 18 zooming her way to Taiwan.
01:46:33.542 - 01:46:37.306, Speaker A: Why? For people who haven't been watching the news, what's the context for this?
01:46:37.408 - 01:47:15.910, Speaker B: Yeah, Nancy Pelosi went to Taiwan of her own accord, interestingly, after her husband bought a bunch of calls in Taiwan semiconductor businesses right before a bill went to Congress. So that's a different story. But then Nancy Pelosi, of her own accord, not as a part of her job as secretary of state or whatever she is, speaker of the house, decides to go to Taiwan and thoroughly pisses off China, who is now, now as a result, doing military exercises in that region as well. So Nancy Pelosi just going rogue, top gun, maverick style, getting herself into Taiwan and pissing off the two biggest superpowers, or one of the biggest superpowers in the world. Nice job.
01:47:16.060 - 01:47:33.562, Speaker A: Well, the 2020s geopolitical tension, that's going to be fun. I feel like we need to, guys, as always, it's been great to have you. Of course crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone.
