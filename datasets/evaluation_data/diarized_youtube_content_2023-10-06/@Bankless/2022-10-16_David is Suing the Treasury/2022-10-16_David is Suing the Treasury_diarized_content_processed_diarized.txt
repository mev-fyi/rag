00:00:00.090 - 00:00:43.300, Speaker A: I'm suing Janet Yellen and treasury because I received the dusting from tornado cash to David Hoffman ETH I don't know who sent it to me and so as a result of that because somebody has sent it to my public address which I couldn't prevent them from doing that I had to file a report with OfAC saying hey somebody did this to me had to take time out of my day and then every single year for the rest of my life I have to do it again still have this illegal money. I still control it. I'm not a criminal. And the thing is Ryan if somebody sends me ETH from tornado cash again I have to do that again every single time and so I'll file two reports and I'll file three reports the treasury as a result of their in my mind illegal listing of a smart contract I have to spend my life my time doing this stupid bureaucracy stuff that I don't think I should have to do and so this is an injury and.
