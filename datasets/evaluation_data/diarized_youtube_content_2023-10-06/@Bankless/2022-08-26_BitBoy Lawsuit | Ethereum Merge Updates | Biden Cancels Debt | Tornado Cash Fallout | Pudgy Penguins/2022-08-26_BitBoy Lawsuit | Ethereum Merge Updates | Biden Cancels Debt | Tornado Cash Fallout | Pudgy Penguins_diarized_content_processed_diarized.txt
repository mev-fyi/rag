00:00:00.170 - 00:00:13.034, Speaker A: Some bad things happening, but also some good things happening. Happy Friday morning to you. It is the fourth Friday of August, and David, the special time. What time is it, Ryan?
00:00:13.082 - 00:00:25.862, Speaker B: It's the Friday bankless weekly roll up where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere into the frontier every single week nonetheless. With a cup coffee, of course.
00:00:25.916 - 00:00:36.120, Speaker A: Yeah. I hope you are enjoying your cup of coffee. By the way, David, did you get a cup of coffee when you went in the mountains last week? You were in the mountains? What'd you take with you? Did you enjoy any coffee or any.
00:00:36.730 - 00:00:43.082, Speaker B: We had coffee, but then we ran out of water, so we had to skip the coffee and walk out of there.
00:00:43.136 - 00:00:49.594, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess you need water. Is coffee higher on Maslow's higher key of needs, or is it lower?
00:00:49.792 - 00:00:54.970, Speaker B: It definitely makes you lose water. So if you're short on water, you got to skip the coffee.
00:00:55.050 - 00:00:55.982, Speaker A: How was the trip, though?
00:00:56.036 - 00:01:11.166, Speaker B: Oh, dude, it's super good, man. We were 5005 and a half thousand feet up. But we're like, the zero is. We started like 3000, but we're in Washington, so basically really close to sea level. You can see the ocean from the top of the mountain. It was great, man. It was great.
00:01:11.268 - 00:01:15.926, Speaker A: You also had cell service. I heard checking in mean, we were.
00:01:15.948 - 00:01:29.414, Speaker B: So high on the mountain that we had sightlines with Victoria, British Columbia. And so we actually were able to get service. And so when I wake up on Sunday, I just look at my phone to check out the time, and I have, like, a widget on my front screen that shows me the ether price every single.
00:01:29.452 - 00:01:30.810, Speaker A: You're checking prices?
00:01:32.350 - 00:01:35.674, Speaker B: I can't not check prices. It's on my home screen. Like, it's the first thing.
00:01:35.712 - 00:01:37.546, Speaker A: You can delete it from your home screen.
00:01:37.728 - 00:01:39.610, Speaker B: No, I can't.
00:01:39.950 - 00:01:41.990, Speaker A: Okay. Hard coded into the OS.
00:01:42.070 - 00:01:47.886, Speaker B: And so I wake up on Sunday morning, I'm like, sweet. We're down like 10%. Like, big ass red candle. Excuse my language. Sorry.
00:01:47.988 - 00:01:57.066, Speaker A: Yeah, you knew it. It was right after the roll up, too, when prices were up. And then we had a crash. But you also saw some strange activity while you were.
00:01:57.188 - 00:01:57.970, Speaker B: Dude, okay.
00:01:58.040 - 00:02:01.794, Speaker A: I don't know. This sounds a little conspiracy theory to me, so convince me.
00:02:01.992 - 00:02:11.446, Speaker B: This is what we were worried about. Okay, so it is 946. It's dark out. We're on the top of the mountain, and we're watching a shooting star. Here or there. There's a shooting star. There's a shooting star.
00:02:11.446 - 00:02:31.014, Speaker B: It's nice. Super cute. And then we see this very slow line in the sky. I'm like, wow, that is the slowest moving shooting star I've ever seen. And then it just doesn't go away. Like, shooting stars go away, like a second or less. This thing, we saw it for 90 seconds, maybe a little bit longer, and it was just like, this long line, and it had this weird trajectory.
00:02:31.014 - 00:02:59.058, Speaker B: It was like, first it was coming down across the horizon like a shooting star, but then it changed direction and started moving toward us. And then it went right over us, and it was this line of light. And as it got closer and closer, it turned from a line to, like, a series of dots. And then it looked like we were, like, right below. You know how those planes, like, trail, you know, marry me, Susan, or something? Yeah, it was like that. But lights. But who has ever seen those with lights on, Case?
00:02:59.144 - 00:03:02.966, Speaker A: So what are you guys thinking? Like, there has to be a group of five of you. I know one of them.
00:03:02.988 - 00:03:12.886, Speaker B: You were UFO believer. I feel like a very sane, grounded individual, and I'm like, I don't have an explanation for what this is. It can't be a plane.
00:03:12.918 - 00:03:13.946, Speaker A: Do you think it's possible?
00:03:14.128 - 00:03:34.302, Speaker B: I don't know. It is, by definition, an unidentified flying object because we didn't know how to identify it. And so we were all like, dude, there's no explanation for what this thing possibly is. Like, 30 to 40 dots in a row flying at a uniform. There was no sound, no propeller engine, no jet sound. Didn't make any goddamn sense. And so we had service.
00:03:34.302 - 00:03:53.190, Speaker B: So we started pulling up Twitter, and we typed in, like, UFO, Olympic Peninsula, Washington. And, like, 50 other people's videos and photos of the same exact thing all showed up, and people freaking out, like, what the hell is this? What the hell is this? And then we saw. People also saw it in Albany, New York and Minnesota. And we're like, what the hell is going on?
00:03:53.260 - 00:03:55.670, Speaker A: That's weird. This is in the middle of the night.
00:03:55.820 - 00:04:16.158, Speaker B: 09:46 p.m. 09:46 p.m. Because I have the video, like, tagged. And then because we're eventually figuring it out. And it's like, apparently it's. Starlink launched, like, 58 new Starlink satellites. And when they launched them, apparently they launched them like ducks in a row, and they start very close together, but over time, they spread out.
00:04:16.158 - 00:04:37.880, Speaker B: But it took us forever to get there. And also, that's what they say, allegedly. It's a very coincidental cover up story. And then the next thing that happens is that we see again exactly 24 hours and two minutes later, when we go back to the cabin and we're sitting out on the beach by the campfire and we see it again. We see it again. It was one of the most, like.
00:04:38.250 - 00:04:41.046, Speaker A: Just Elon Musk messing around with.
00:04:41.148 - 00:04:43.910, Speaker B: Not aliens, rich people playing rich people games, I guess.
00:04:43.980 - 00:04:54.170, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess so. But you know what? This is not going to become a UFO truth or podcast, I hope, David, unless you are. What's the probability? Now, you think this was a UFO versus.
00:04:56.030 - 00:05:10.810, Speaker B: Expect? So when we were up there, we were like, okay, we're going to get back to civilization tomorrow, and either aliens are going to be here, or we're going to have a rational explanation for this, and aliens are not here. And no one has. Else has said it's not starlink. So I'm going with Starlink.
00:05:10.890 - 00:05:34.338, Speaker A: All right, well, bankless listener, if you've heard this story, you have other information for David to feed his alternative ideas, then please send it over to us. But we're going to get to crypto right now. First thing on the menu. Yeah, you remember crypto, the other big conspiracy theory out there, the tornado chill. Tornado cash just got a little bit colder. Some bad things happening, but also some good things happening. Maybe a page has turned.
00:05:34.338 - 00:05:37.586, Speaker A: Some people are fighting back. We're going to talk about that. David, what else we covering?
00:05:37.698 - 00:06:11.746, Speaker B: Tribdao is shutting down. There's a proposal from the tribedao team to shut down and call it a day, much to the consternation of the tribe community. So we're going to cover that and how the proposal actually looks like to wind the thing down. And then Bitboy. Do you know Bitboy is Crypto's biggest YouTuber account. Filed a lawsuit against another YouTuber who made a video of him talking about him being a scammy pump and dumper. And then Bitboy files a lawsuit citing defamation and destroying Bitboy's business.
00:06:11.746 - 00:06:32.474, Speaker B: And then all of Crypto Twitter. Ryan shows up to defend this other YouTuber who's not a crypto YouTuber who made this video about Bitboy. So we're going to cover all of that drama. And Kobe, who just yeeted $100,000 to help defend this innocent crypto YouTuber. High drama. High drama in crypto Twitter this week.
00:06:32.672 - 00:06:53.706, Speaker A: Awesome. I think we also have some merge updates, of course, some coming up from the Ethereum foundation, too. So a date is definitely being proposed. Speaking of dates that are proposed, there's a date of a conference that's coming up. Our friends and sponsors, Smartcon. This is a conference by Chainlink. This is a crypto web3 conference.
00:06:53.706 - 00:07:05.794, Speaker A: Look at these speakers, David. This conference is absolutely stacked. I've attended virtually the past couple of years. This time it's in person. It's physical. So, you know, I won't be there because it's a physical conference. But everyone else should go.
00:07:05.794 - 00:07:09.314, Speaker A: I'm the weird one, because who do we got? Let's go into this conference, David.
00:07:09.362 - 00:07:32.234, Speaker B: Yeah, we got Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google. We have Sergey Nazros, of course, founder of Chainlink Biology, recently had him on the podcast SBF. Ed Felton from Arbitrums. Donnie from Ave Emmon from Avalanche. Anatoli from Solana Kane from Synthetix. And so this is the first time that Smartcon is actually in real life. And so previously, it's been in virtual every single year.
00:07:32.234 - 00:07:43.086, Speaker B: But this is in real life. There is a link in the show notes to get a ticket if you so choose to go, and also a code, bankless, to get a hefty discount. If you also want a hefty discount, which why wouldn't you?
00:07:43.268 - 00:07:54.974, Speaker A: Hefty discount. This is for you, for the bankless community. Just type in bankless and get that discount. A gift from the folks at Smartcon. Thank you for that. All right, David, let's get to the markets today. Bitcoin.
00:07:54.974 - 00:07:56.718, Speaker A: I'm seeing some red candles.
00:07:56.814 - 00:08:18.074, Speaker B: I'm seeing some down right after we recorded the weekly roll up last week. So, like, when bankless listeners opened up the weekly roll up Friday morning, like, all of our numbers, everything was bad. It was all bad. It happened, like, Friday. Yeah. And so let's see. Bitcoin started the week at 23 and a half, $1,000, ending the week at $21.6
00:08:18.074 - 00:08:22.214, Speaker B: thousand. Down 8.2% on the week. Oof. Oof.
00:08:22.262 - 00:08:26.874, Speaker A: That doesn't feel good. Down almost double digits. And ether, I think, is down double digits.
00:08:26.922 - 00:08:34.866, Speaker B: Down double digits. Yeah. Started the week at 1920, ending the week at one, $700. Where we are now down 11.4% on the week.
00:08:34.968 - 00:08:38.850, Speaker A: David, what happened to my merge trade, man, last week?
00:08:38.920 - 00:08:43.330, Speaker B: No, it's fine. We're back 14 days. We're back 14 days.
00:08:43.400 - 00:08:54.998, Speaker A: Just back in time 14 days. Not a big deal. That's what happens when you're zoomed too closely to this. But how about the ETH bitcoin ratio? Because that's a tell for whether we're in merge season or not.
00:08:55.084 - 00:09:26.554, Speaker B: Yeah. Where it started last week at 0795, down to 0876. So down 1%. But if you look at the chart like you zoom in. It was basically zero eight, went all the way down to zero 73 and then recovered to where it is now at zero 78 seven. So went down a lot and then recovered a lot. And so to me, that pressure, that buy pressure to keep the ETH BTC ratio at its local highs, I think is the merge trade.
00:09:26.602 - 00:09:27.982, Speaker A: That's kind of strange. Like what happened.
00:09:28.036 - 00:09:29.246, Speaker B: Merge strength. Merge strength.
00:09:29.278 - 00:09:33.182, Speaker A: What happened here? Why did this happen on Friday, last Friday, this big candle?
00:09:33.246 - 00:09:34.898, Speaker B: I don't know. I don't know. Market's going to.
00:09:34.904 - 00:09:35.570, Speaker A: Market happens.
00:09:35.640 - 00:09:37.618, Speaker B: Market crypto does go down.
00:09:37.704 - 00:09:44.934, Speaker A: Did you know sometimes on a daily, hourly, minute by minute basis, David goes up and down is what they tell me.
00:09:44.972 - 00:09:47.506, Speaker B: Sometimes it goes, why do you. For an entire year, I'm back to David.
00:09:47.538 - 00:09:54.250, Speaker A: Why do we even do numbers every week? How about the total crypto market cap? While we're doing numbers, what is that.
00:09:54.320 - 00:10:07.390, Speaker B: Looking like down from where it was last week, 1.16 billion trillion to where it is now at 1.86 trillion. So down, what is that .8 trillion on the week?
00:10:07.540 - 00:10:30.518, Speaker A: Do you know, David, I remember a time when total crypto market cap was $10 billion. Some people remember way sooner than that, but I remember the days like 2016, when Ethereum was like 500 million to a billion and bitcoin was just the big behemoth. So zooming out, this feels a whole lot better. Like $1 trillion.
00:10:30.604 - 00:10:34.950, Speaker B: What a success for crypto, where 90% of these listeners weren't here.
00:10:35.020 - 00:10:41.222, Speaker A: Ryan, sorry, but look at these things. I don't know. We're back to crypto price.
00:10:41.356 - 00:10:48.266, Speaker B: I came in in June of 2017, and the total crypto market cap was $80 billion. Wow. See?
00:10:48.368 - 00:10:51.802, Speaker A: How silly is that? Now you're at a trillion. Wow, what a success.
00:10:51.936 - 00:10:52.282, Speaker B: Wow.
00:10:52.336 - 00:10:53.590, Speaker A: It's been very successful.
00:10:53.670 - 00:10:54.250, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:54.400 - 00:10:58.750, Speaker A: And June of 2017 was kind of, like, pretty frothy at that time.
00:10:58.820 - 00:11:07.206, Speaker B: We were well into the bull market. Yeah. I was a 2017 top buyer. Certainly that top buyer badge with pride.
00:11:07.258 - 00:11:13.134, Speaker A: I think we all were. We've all bought some tops around here. That's how you learn in crypto. But talk about passage.
00:11:13.182 - 00:11:13.682, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:13.816 - 00:11:32.774, Speaker A: You want to talk gov stuff a little bit? Just a little bit, because some stuff happening. Biden just okayed a sweeping student loan relief plan as midterms near. That's a key word. As midterms near. Of course, right before November. But also, what's happening here looks like some debt forgiveness.
00:11:32.902 - 00:11:46.154, Speaker B: Yeah. $10,000 of student debt is being forgiven for anyone who receives less than $125,000. A year. So if you make $125,000 a year or less, you have 10,000 less dollars of student debt.
00:11:46.202 - 00:11:49.280, Speaker A: If you had it just been eliminated, it's got gone.
00:11:49.650 - 00:12:16.790, Speaker B: They deleted the zero or the $10,000. If you had a Pell grant, you got up to $20,000 of student debt for low and middle come borrowers who had a Pell grant. So cool. A lot of people have student debt. So add like multiply $10,000 by the number of people who make less than $120,000, $25,000 a year and who have student debt. That's a large number. I think there's that calculation in this article, but it's a pretty good number.
00:12:16.860 - 00:12:31.034, Speaker A: It's funny you just said cool. Some people think cool, and a lot of people who have student debt are like, this is cool, and some people who don't, but they're just supportive of debt relief. Also think this is cool. Some other people don't think it's very cool as well.
00:12:31.072 - 00:12:31.660, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:32.510 - 00:13:08.514, Speaker A: This does remind me a lot of the PPP loans, though, which were loans for businesses. Some small businesses got the funds. A lot of large businesses got the funds that were eventually forgiven during COVID It kind of reminds me of that, and it strikes me that some of the people who got the money are generally in favor of this, and the people who didn't get the money aren't right. And so weird how that works. It just feels very much like different constituencies are finding their way to hook into the money printer. Right. And whether that's a good or bad thing, that's kind of beyond the scope of this podcast to consider.
00:13:08.514 - 00:13:41.038, Speaker A: But what we are looking at is the money printer continues to go, you know, whether it's red or blue, one politician gets in control and rewards their constituency, then another gets in control, rewards theirs through tax cuts or debt relief or stimulus checks or that sort of thing, I feel very much like, David, we're kind of losing the credible neutrality of the money printer through this process, though, and that is certainly a contrast with crypto. David, you've got a meme here. I think this is the classic trolley problem. What are we looking at here?
00:13:41.124 - 00:14:24.942, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's two fights on this debate. Some people of sad that they paid back their student loans, and then the student loan gets canceled, and they're like, well, f, I shouldn't have paid it back, I should have waited, just get it canceled. So there's like, I thought a funny trolley meme here, trolley problem. And so the trolley problem of course, traditionally, there's one person on one track, five people on the other track. If you do nothing, if you don't divert the trolley, the trolley is going to kill five people. And so if you do something, if you divert the trolley by switching the lever, then it only kills one person. It's a moral question as to do you take the action, you, as a person with agency, do you take the action to divert the trolley to kill one person rather than five people? In my mind, you absolutely do that.
00:14:24.942 - 00:14:29.874, Speaker B: Even though you then become, like a murderer, technically, you also save five people. It's like net beneficial anyway.
00:14:29.912 - 00:14:30.654, Speaker A: Utilitarian.
00:14:30.702 - 00:14:52.934, Speaker B: Utilitarian, yeah, this trolley. But there's also, there's like an infinity number of renditions of the trolley problem. So this one, the trolley has already killed ten people. And if you divert the trolley, it won't kill five people. It will instead kill zero people. And then the person who's, like, in control of this lever says, but if I divert the trolley now, that would be unfair to the people that it's already killed. I thought it was funny.
00:14:52.934 - 00:14:54.278, Speaker B: I thought it was funny meme.
00:14:54.374 - 00:15:06.846, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I get it. This is kind of the argument. But you bring up an interesting question, David, about your ethics. I'm curious here. So have you ever played that trolley problem game where it's like 30 different renditions of the trolley problem?
00:15:06.948 - 00:15:11.086, Speaker B: Yeah. And they start off relatively easy, but then they get more and more hard?
00:15:11.188 - 00:15:30.440, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. So there's some that are very, very difficult. So you got a baby on one side, and then five people over 85 on the other side. And do you flip the switch? Is it baby, or do you let the trolley go kill 585 year old people? What do you decide in that case?
00:15:30.810 - 00:15:32.342, Speaker B: Am I on the stands here?
00:15:32.396 - 00:15:40.074, Speaker A: Yes, I'm curious. As my business partner and co host, I need to know your moral ethics, David, we haven't discussed this yet.
00:15:40.192 - 00:15:49.114, Speaker B: Big utilitarian over here. So the way that I would do this if I was to do this, how old are these people? 80 years old?
00:15:49.312 - 00:15:50.300, Speaker A: 85.
00:15:50.750 - 00:16:14.510, Speaker B: So I don't know what the stats are, but the way I would come to determine this is that if you are 85 years old, what is your expected remaining years to live? And so if your expected remaining years to live is like eight, multiply that by five and you get 40. And then you take the expected remaining years to live of the baby. And if it's greater than 40, then you kill the old people and save the baby.
00:16:14.590 - 00:16:24.694, Speaker A: Okay, let me modify that. What if one of these 85 year old people are Nobel Prize winning scientists on the cusp of curing cancer? What then?
00:16:24.732 - 00:16:31.794, Speaker B: Oh, if you know they're on the cusp of curing cancer, then you absolutely kill the goddamn baby, because that baby hasn't done anything. He's sick.
00:16:31.922 - 00:16:32.790, Speaker A: I can't.
00:16:33.790 - 00:16:40.170, Speaker B: If you cure cancer, you recreate David. There's billions of years of life.
00:16:40.240 - 00:16:40.858, Speaker A: These problems.
00:16:40.944 - 00:16:43.626, Speaker B: All right, kill the baby, Ryan. Kill the baby.
00:16:43.738 - 00:16:44.350, Speaker A: My God.
00:16:44.420 - 00:16:45.086, Speaker B: Do it.
00:16:45.188 - 00:16:51.086, Speaker A: We're about to get sued by bitboy or all sorts of different agencies here.
00:16:51.108 - 00:17:04.980, Speaker B: Okay, my favorite one, which I think is the one that. Okay, most answers I answered with consensus, but the one that I didn't answer with consensus was, do you kill one human or five sentient robots? What do you do?
00:17:05.750 - 00:17:08.020, Speaker A: Well, I've got to represent the AI side.
00:17:11.450 - 00:17:15.446, Speaker B: Well, okay, that's good, because I also represented the AI side.
00:17:15.548 - 00:17:17.906, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Can we get back to crypto?
00:17:18.098 - 00:17:20.402, Speaker B: Sentience is sentience. Who am I to judge?
00:17:20.466 - 00:17:29.420, Speaker A: You know, at some point in time, I guess maybe AIs will be making these decisions for us. That reminds me of our episode with Dimitri that's coming up.
00:17:29.870 - 00:17:36.240, Speaker B: Will the future AIs of the world please let it be known that if the trolley problem kills AI, that I choose to save you.
00:17:37.330 - 00:17:44.142, Speaker A: Is that Rocco's balask? Right? Yeah. Roku's basilisk. Anyway, let's move on.
00:17:44.196 - 00:17:45.306, Speaker B: Deep cuts so far on this roll.
00:17:45.338 - 00:17:54.606, Speaker A: Deep cuts on this roll up. Maybe this will make the cut. Maybe. You'll never hear this. We'll see. Did you know, though? Okay, so we're just talking about Biden. More money printing.
00:17:54.606 - 00:18:16.294, Speaker A: Of course. More debt forgiveness. That is what it is. Here is a tweet from Jacob Franick, who says a fed study finds that 60% of all uS inflation over 2019 to 2021 was due to what? A demand for goods, thanks to fiscal stimulus and other aggregate demand factors.
00:18:16.422 - 00:18:18.614, Speaker B: Ryan, what is student loan forgiveness?
00:18:18.742 - 00:18:20.294, Speaker A: This is fiscal stimulus.
00:18:20.342 - 00:18:23.870, Speaker B: Is that fiscal stimulus? Is that increasing everyone's net worth by $10,000?
00:18:23.940 - 00:18:48.406, Speaker A: It puts more money in people's pockets, more perceived money. They're more willing to spend on other things, including meme stocks, because they're probably millennials. And also crypto. Right. Which is kind of an interesting byproduct. But there's a direct link between the money printing and fiscal stimulus, of course, and inflation, which is a problem, David, because the US is in the process. The Fed is in the process of trying to get inflation under control.
00:18:48.406 - 00:19:15.066, Speaker A: This is a chart from Pantera Capital, and this is showing the real ten year treasury yield. Okay, so if you buy a treasury bond for ten years. Your real rate of return right now, that's the return of the bond minus inflation, is negative 6%. Sorry, right. Negative 6%. David, would you buy this bond earning negative 6% per year right now?
00:19:15.088 - 00:19:29.934, Speaker B: Okay, so, yeah, I feel like there's two rational ways to say yes to that question. If I am bearish on the stock market, and I think the stock market is going to go down more than 6%, then, yes, I would buy bonds.
00:19:30.062 - 00:19:31.502, Speaker A: Rather than have it in stocks.
00:19:31.566 - 00:19:37.460, Speaker B: Rather than have it in stocks, yes. What was the other one? I can't remember.
00:19:38.950 - 00:19:43.398, Speaker A: The other one is maybe you're the Fed and you have to buy bonds to keep the entire. Because that's what's happening.
00:19:43.484 - 00:19:44.674, Speaker B: That's the other rational outcome.
00:19:44.722 - 00:20:11.194, Speaker A: Yeah. What's actually happening is they're kind of running out of buyers. Right. Because a lot of people are like, this is not a great deal with inflation running so hot, and they're buying alternative assets. So the Fed has been buying a lot of bonds historically, of course. Anyway, it's a real quandary, and I think there's a juxtaposition between debt forgiveness, inflation, and also the real return on sovereign bonds. And you contrast that with crypto, and this is the market we find ourselves in right now, David.
00:20:11.194 - 00:20:13.854, Speaker A: There's also some energy price things going on. What's this?
00:20:13.972 - 00:20:52.798, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a graph of the cost of a megawatt hour in euro terms in Germany. I haven't been paying too much to the macro markets except for a tweet here and there talking about commodities markets, which are looking bad, and energy markets, which are looking worse. So just let it be known, we don't have time to go into it. And I'm also just not an expert, but energy in Europe is really expensive right now. Going to the start of the year, say, let's just pick an arbitrary point, is like January 2022, the cost of a euro megawatt hour was about, like 80 to €100. For a megawatt hour, we are currently up to 313. So it's three x since the start of the year.
00:20:52.798 - 00:20:55.822, Speaker B: So energy cost, Europe going up, that's bad.
00:20:55.956 - 00:21:18.360, Speaker A: And it's going up relative to euros in particular, which is kind of bad, because Europe is the next exporter, net exporter of energy. So they don't have energy kind of backing their currency the way rubles do. More on that in the Luke Roman episode, which I think is a fantastic episode on that. That we did. But, David, we're talking about money printing, SBF and FTX. Is definitely printing some money back.
00:21:19.930 - 00:21:21.698, Speaker B: It's not printing money if it's revenue.
00:21:21.794 - 00:21:28.390, Speaker A: I guess so. All right, so some leaked financial data. How much was FTX making last year.
00:21:28.540 - 00:21:57.310, Speaker B: In 2021st off before we get to last year in 2020, FTX was making just a measly below $90 million. Just below $90 million in 2020. In 2021, they were making over a billion dollars of revenue. So from under 90 million to over a billion in revenue. Some insane profit margins. Profitable with 27% operating margins. And then not only did they make just a ton of money in 2021, but they also made a ton of strategic acquisitions.
00:21:57.310 - 00:22:10.390, Speaker B: And so they have just like Sam Bankman Freed and FTX just won the bull market, made a bunch of money, bought a bunch of businesses at a very cheap discounts because all of those businesses were distressed. So FTX really just won the bull market for sure.
00:22:10.460 - 00:22:30.202, Speaker A: Yeah, they definitely did. And that's what they're doing buying these distressed assets right now. David, this is interesting. I think we wanted to include this here because it seems like a L2 season might be afoot, some more competition for alternative L1s, at least on the NFT side. This is a stat from immutable X. What's immutable X doing?
00:22:30.336 - 00:22:57.626, Speaker B: Immutable has passed Alana in daily NFT sales volume in dollar terms. Now it is the only chain, it's the second chain with the most volume behind the Ethereum layer one. And this kind of just makes sense. Like immutable is a NFT optimized platform. It's built for NFTs and for trading NFTs and also with super cheap fees, kind of like Salana. So perhaps eating into Salana's market share. But also Salana overall is down in NFT trading volume.
00:22:57.626 - 00:23:11.554, Speaker B: It was between like three and $5 million in daily NFT trading volume back in June. Now it's down to $1 million of daily NFT trading volume, where IMX has now gone to like one and a quarter million dollars in trading volume.
00:23:11.602 - 00:23:24.046, Speaker A: This is one thing we predicted. Not sure if we're right on this thesis, but alternative layer ones will find themselves competing more with L2s, Ethereum L2s, than Ethereum directly. Maybe that's starting to play out now.
00:23:24.148 - 00:23:40.162, Speaker B: It's also just a big plus one to the modular Ethereum thesis, where specific chains that are custom built to do and perform specific activities are going to be better at those activities than monolithic chains who have to have trade offs because they want to do everything at once.
00:23:40.296 - 00:24:14.922, Speaker A: Right? And here's a plus one to the bankless thesis. So maybe we've learned something this cycle as we always learn things. Did you know that even in the midst of a bear market, crypto hardware wallets are up bigly? Okay, so ledger says their sales recently blew up since the house Celsius hacked by 4.5 x 4.5 x Trezor and Safepal also up hefty sales figures. People are withdrawing their funds from centralized exchanges. They're taking sovereignty of their own crypto, taking their own keys.
00:24:14.922 - 00:24:28.830, Speaker A: They're going bankless and they're buying hardware wallets. And that's on the back of centralized exchange failure. This is a good thing, I think we are learning our lesson and we are getting more people to go bankless. I'm kind of bullish on this, actually, David.
00:24:28.910 - 00:24:43.922, Speaker B: Of course. I mean, this is how the crypto industry learns. We learn through pain. So when something bad happens, when everyone gets like a punch to the stomach, they're like, I didn't like that. What can I do to not have that happen to me again? And hardware wallets are definitely a solution.
00:24:44.066 - 00:24:50.618, Speaker A: Absolutely. Get more resilient as time goes on. David. Got a lot more to cover in the next section. What are we going to talk about?
00:24:50.704 - 00:25:26.846, Speaker B: Oh, my God, so much. First, coming up next is the freezing, the chilling effect of the tornado cash. But we also got some thawers on the horizon, people trying to stop the freezing and thaw things. Am I drawing out this metaphor too much? I don't know. Probably. But in addition to that, the tribe dow trying to unwind, trying to shut down proposal from the tribedao team to just call it a day with tribe and the community backlash as a result of that. And also, Bitboy Sue's a YouTuber, but the entire crypto community, the entire crypto Twitter community shows up to defend that YouTuber.
00:25:26.846 - 00:25:59.022, Speaker B: So we'll get into that drama, which is some juicy drama and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that help you go bankless. Rocket pool is your friendly, decentralized Ethereum staking protocol. You can stake your ETH with rocket pool and get our ETH in return, allowing you to stake your ETH and use it in DFI at the same time. You can get 4% on your ETH by staking it with rocket pool, but you can get even more by running a node. Rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes. Running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node. And you only need 16 ETH to get started.
00:25:59.022 - 00:26:26.802, Speaker B: Why would you do this? You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled E. So your API is boosted. So if you're bullish east staking, you can increase your API and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network, which currently has over a thousand independent validators. It's yield farming, but with Ethereum nodes, you can get started@rocketpool.net and also join the Rocketpool community in their discord. You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there. Lens Protocol is an open source tech stack for building decentralized social media applications.
00:26:26.802 - 00:26:43.354, Speaker B: It is the new era for social media. We all have toxic relationships with our web. Two apps. We want to break up with them, but we can't. These applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made. We need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us. Lens isn't a social media app.
00:26:43.354 - 00:27:05.506, Speaker B: It's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps bloom. Lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user. In crypto, we say, not your keys, not your crypto. And on lens, we say, not your keys, not your profile. With Lens, your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use. And instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app, lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media.
00:27:05.608 - 00:27:29.434, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back. More on tornado cash. So more on the OFAC sanctions. Of course, as you know, OFAC sanctioned for the very first time smart contracts on Ethereum, the tornado cash smart contracts. The last couple of weeks, we've been dealing with and talking about the fallout from that. Here, one of the follow up items, this is in the negative section. There's also some positive things we're going to talk about.
00:27:29.434 - 00:27:32.118, Speaker A: But what is this first headline we're looking at? David?
00:27:32.214 - 00:28:27.402, Speaker B: So post merge, all of the Ethereum clients are going to have this thing called MeV boost kind of plugged into it, like a little bit of a sidecar that's produced by flashbots. And this is something that is first an accessory to the Ethereum protocol, but then later becomes integrated into the Ethereum protocol. Basically, it's the precursor to proposer builder separation, and it allows Ethereum stakers to just receive pre created blocks from MeV boost from these people called block builders who are building blocks, which are kind of a computationally intensive thing to do. And then these block builders just propose these blocks to proposers, e stakers. Proposers or e stakers. And then e stakers take these blocks, and then they just like, oh, I'll take that bid associated with that block, and I'll propose that this service is going to be created by this thing called MeV Boost. But sadly, flashbots is a US centralized entity, and they stated that they plan on complying with OFAC regulations because they don't want to go to jail.
00:28:27.402 - 00:29:14.606, Speaker B: Like, relatively rational. And so, as a result of that, that's one of the big conversations that trigger this Ethereum censorship conversation, saying, oh, well, if flashbots is going to maintain OFAC compliance, we're almost doing censorship at the protocol level. And as a result of that, Flashbots has accelerated the open sourcing of Meb boost and their relayers so that more people can participate to remove some of that censorship. But the point here is that flashbots, as a centralized, regulated entity, is not going to go toe to toe with OFAC, and they will be complying with OFAC. I actually wouldn't necessarily classify this as a tornado cash chilling effect. I would actually straight up saying they would otherwise be in violations, and so you can't really blame them. I wouldn't say no.
00:29:14.606 - 00:29:19.038, Speaker B: Flashbots, people, you got to go to jail for us. But it's also stuff we don't like.
00:29:19.204 - 00:29:45.362, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And there's two things for this. One, if you still have more questions on me, vboost or flashbots, go to the episode that we released earlier this week on Flashbots. You'll understand all of that. We actually recorded that episode before all the tornado cash stuff happened, so we weren't able to ask the censorship resistance questions. But if you're wondering how this affects Ethereum's long term protocol censorship resistance, listen to our episode coming out with Justin Drake this Monday.
00:29:45.426 - 00:29:46.722, Speaker B: New Drake dropping.
00:29:46.866 - 00:30:08.810, Speaker A: It's so good. Okay, this is our episode. I think we called it ethereum uncensored. And he classifies this problem, the problem of flashbots and block builder censorship as a form of weak censorship attack. Weak censor attack. And so he goes through the difference between weak and strong and shows what the mitigators are. Anyway, fantastic episode.
00:30:08.810 - 00:30:24.882, Speaker A: If you're worried like I am, when you read a headline and you're like, flashbots is blacklisting wallets, what does this mean? Got to do your research. Listen to both those episodes coming out on bankless. We could talk a lot more about that, but there's more FTX this is.
00:30:24.936 - 00:30:31.334, Speaker B: Actually tornado cash chilling effect, as in this did not need to happen. No one is forcing FTX to do this.
00:30:31.452 - 00:30:51.610, Speaker A: So there's a L2, similar to tornado cash in terms of the tech stack it uses, but also different, more advanced in some ways. We talked about a lot. It's called aztec. And FTX actually froze a user account. Who sent coins to Aztec's zk money. Aztec, of course, was not on any ofax sanctions list. Does use similar technology.
00:30:51.610 - 00:31:03.578, Speaker A: It preserves your privacy on chain only in L2. And then now here's a crypto exchange saying wallets can no longer, our users can no longer withdraw to Aztec.
00:31:03.674 - 00:31:04.270, Speaker B: Big problem.
00:31:04.340 - 00:31:06.682, Speaker A: Flashing red light. What do you think about this, David?
00:31:06.826 - 00:31:40.374, Speaker B: Yeah, this is like an unforced error, I would say. If we're going to be in crypto, can we live by crypto values, which is to not censor like a minimum viable censorship that doesn't make operators of FTX and others go to jail. And so aztec, you can go and use Aztec right now. You're not violating any laws. You are free to do so. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm pretty sure that's true. And so the fact that we are banning people that are using Aztec before just because it is privacy services is like against the ethos of crypto.
00:31:40.374 - 00:31:42.782, Speaker B: We didn't need to do this. This is bad.
00:31:42.916 - 00:31:59.570, Speaker A: Yeah, this is part of the chilling effect. Aztec also responding by implementing some practical deterrence and measuring their effectiveness. This is a tweet from Aztec. And I understand why they're putting this out there. They want to say that they're doing something, but I don't like it. David, look at this.
00:31:59.640 - 00:32:01.234, Speaker B: I don't like that they have to do it.
00:32:01.272 - 00:32:28.186, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't like that they have to do it or they feel like they have to do it. This is all part of the chilling effect. They're doing some IP specific deposit rate limiting. They're looking at people's IP addresses and trying to rate limit how much you can deposit, nothing else. This has a throttling effect to how many people use Aztec and the scale of what Aztec could be. This is a throttling effect for privacy, for everyone in the world. A massive problem.
00:32:28.288 - 00:32:55.998, Speaker B: And let it be known that if you are North Korea or a highly motivated actor, you can get around all of these things except for the system wide daily asset deposit caps, which they mean, like, you know, no more than 1000 ether can go into asset on a daily basis. Other than that, it actually just makes it have more friction for individual people like you and me. And it's annoying for somebody like North Korea, but it's not going to stop them in the slightest.
00:32:56.094 - 00:33:00.360, Speaker A: David, have you seen that meme of, like, there's a guy and there's like a.
00:33:02.650 - 00:33:08.614, Speaker B: Six inch wide or the 6ft long barrier that has no barriers on either side, and it's like banning North Korea. Yeah.
00:33:08.652 - 00:33:22.614, Speaker A: And so it's like North Korea is obviously just going to route around all of this as they usually would. So the only group that you're punishing are law abiding, privacy seeking individuals, which is a big problem. But let's keep not Asic's fault.
00:33:22.742 - 00:33:25.450, Speaker B: That is Ofac's fault. That's ofa's fault.
00:33:26.030 - 00:33:42.206, Speaker A: Yeah, I get that. It depends. I think there's a spectrum of how much you react to the chilling effect. Right. Look, people can't code from jail. We can't do the bankless podcast in an orange. Gotta.
00:33:42.206 - 00:33:56.930, Speaker A: We gotta stay out of jail in order to continue this stuff. And yet we don't have to be over compliers either. And so I'm not sure what the line is here, but there is a line here. Anyway, the fight continues. But what is happening with uniswap labs?
00:33:57.010 - 00:34:21.054, Speaker B: Yeah. More wallets are being banned from TRM labs, which the uniswap front end and other front ends used to block banned addresses. So 253 crypto wallet addresses over the last month have been banned. They have been claimed to belong to criminals and hackers or interfere with US government sanctions. So d five front end is getting harder to use for, well, 253 addresses, but.
00:34:21.092 - 00:34:51.158, Speaker A: Sad. And Jake Trevinsky says he doesn't blame organizations for doing this at this point in time, again, because of the chilling effect. If you want more of the mitigators for front end kind of bands, then listen to that Justin Drake episode. He walks through all the ways we can solve this as a community. But also, David, the developer, Alex Perzef, who was arrested by authorities in the Netherlands, is still in jail.
00:34:51.254 - 00:34:51.610, Speaker B: Right?
00:34:51.680 - 00:35:06.586, Speaker A: Okay. He's been in jail now, I think, for 1213 days. And a judge just ruled that he will spend the next 90 days in jail as well. Until there's a hearing, no charges have been laid. No charges. We don't know why.
00:35:06.608 - 00:35:09.950, Speaker B: How are you supposed to hire a legal defense if you don't have charges?
00:35:10.370 - 00:35:11.402, Speaker A: It's unbelievable.
00:35:11.466 - 00:35:13.570, Speaker B: How do you go to court without charges?
00:35:14.550 - 00:35:34.374, Speaker A: His lawyers apparently tried to make bail and bail was denied. Again, no charges. Right. It's just like, where's the due process? I don't know. I don't know what's going on. Anyway, some people are protesting this, as they should be. There's some ways to get involved, too.
00:35:34.374 - 00:35:51.814, Speaker A: So some people are literally protesting in is. This is my tweet. A judge just ruled that Alex must stay in jail. Alexey must stay in jail. Alex wrote some open source privacy code, a public good. A few bad guys used his code, so they put him in a cage. Who's next? Vitalik, Tim Berners Lee.
00:35:51.814 - 00:36:18.294, Speaker A: We're gonna arrest the crater of TCPIP and the Internet. So I think we need to get loud as a community, and there are ways to do that. There's a website called Setalixfree NL, where you can join a, sign a petition, join a telegram group, donate in various places, and start to speak out, because we at least need to know what he's being charged for. If they don't have a charge, they need to let the guy free because it looks like they're just putting him in jail for writing code.
00:36:18.412 - 00:36:18.742, Speaker B: Right?
00:36:18.796 - 00:36:22.466, Speaker A: How is that permissible in any free, open, democratic society?
00:36:22.578 - 00:36:29.622, Speaker B: Yeah, there better be a real good reason why that guy's in jail. Otherwise it's completely ridiculous and also scary.
00:36:29.686 - 00:36:33.770, Speaker A: So protests happening as well. But, David, there's also some good news.
00:36:33.920 - 00:36:35.126, Speaker B: Coming to the rescue.
00:36:35.238 - 00:36:36.362, Speaker A: Okay, what's a thought?
00:36:36.496 - 00:37:00.350, Speaker B: Imagine people with flamethrowers just like flamethrowing. The tornado cash chilling effect. That's what's going on here. So Representative Tom Emmer, who we've had on the podcast, tweets out. I sent a letter to Secretary Yellen regarding the unprecedented sanctioning of tornado cash. The growing of adoption of decentralized technology will certainly raise new challenges for OFAC. Nonetheless, technology is neutral, and the expectation of privacy is normal.
00:37:00.430 - 00:37:01.730, Speaker A: Oh, wow. I like that line.
00:37:01.800 - 00:37:26.618, Speaker B: Expectation of privacy is normal. Thank you. Thank you. And then this is what this guy Ryan Sean Adams says, thank you for standing up to privacy. Representative Tom Emmer. But he is not the only tornado cash flamethrower of the chilling effect. Matthew Green, who we've also had on the podcast, he says on Twitter, I made a GitHub organization to republish a fork of tornado cash repositories that were banned following the treasury's sanction order of the other week.
00:37:26.618 - 00:37:42.110, Speaker B: So there's tornado cache code back up on GitHub, a new GitHub repository with tornado cache, because all that is is open source code. Matthew Green, nice job. Third tornado cache flamethrower anti chilling effect. Thar person.
00:37:42.180 - 00:37:45.182, Speaker A: Tether, Tether, Tether. That's unexpected.
00:37:45.246 - 00:37:58.280, Speaker B: Yeah, Tether. Tether holds firm on a decision to not freeze tornado cash addresses, awaits law enforcement instructions. So basically saying, hey, guys, we're not going to freeze those, but come talk. We'll come talk.
00:37:58.650 - 00:38:06.738, Speaker A: Send us a reason. Give us a court order. They're not falling victim to the over compliance trap.
00:38:06.834 - 00:38:18.742, Speaker B: I will say, though, Tether has blacklisted, I think like ten to 50 times more addresses than USDC has. But granted it's been around longer and it's had a higher market cap longer than USDC.
00:38:18.806 - 00:39:12.570, Speaker A: So some asterisks there, definitely. Ultimately, David, as we get into the Justin Drake episode, our greatest defense is the layer zero, right? And if there is some sort of censored version OFAC sanctioned version of Ethereum versus an uncensorable original Ethereum, which one of the core devs going to support? Which one is the Ethereum community going to actually develop software for and actually want to use? This is a quote directly from the last core devs call from one of the core devs of Ethereum. He says this, if we allow censorship of user transactions on the network, then we basically failed. This is the hill that I'm willing to die on. If we start allowing users to be censored on Ethereum, then this whole thing doesn't make sense. And I will be leaving the ecosystem. Who's going to work on your OFAC sanctioned Ethereum version?
00:39:12.650 - 00:39:13.162, Speaker B: Chills.
00:39:13.226 - 00:39:16.046, Speaker A: It's not going to be the core devs of Ethereum, that's for sure.
00:39:16.148 - 00:39:35.630, Speaker B: Right? Yeah, that's a really good point. If OFAC wants an OFAC compliant version of Ethereum, they need to build all of that infrastructure from themselves because no Ethereum core devs are going to be like, okay, yeah, we'll just build OFAC compliance into our censorship resistant blockchain. Ethereum.
00:39:35.710 - 00:39:43.270, Speaker A: Gov, baby, let's go. Let's do it. Build your own blockchain if you want to sanction one. China's doing it. Why can't the US do it?
00:39:43.340 - 00:39:51.926, Speaker B: Yeah, go do it. Nice job. This is Marius on the Geth team. Geth. I mean, probably the most important piece of Ethereum infrastructure that exists.
00:39:52.038 - 00:39:57.898, Speaker A: Bullish. Bullish, I think bullish. Layer zero. David, let's move on to the next story. What are we talking about here?
00:39:57.984 - 00:40:40.526, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is the Faye fallout of the Faye dow. And so the title of this article here is that the Faye community is up in arms over the dissolution plan. And so asiding technical, financial and future regulatory risks, the team behind Faye says it's ready to call it quits. They make a proposal to the Dow. But that proposal would only partially repay $80 million of the Rari hack, which is now the Rari Fay Ferrari. Remember that whole thing? So Rari got hacked, $80 million, and there's plenty of funds to pay back these hack victims in full. But according to this proposal, this proposal pays back the tribe token holders.
00:40:40.526 - 00:41:20.438, Speaker B: Hence, this is the tribe team and only pay back the hack victims partially. At the peak of the bull market, the Faye market cap, the Faye stablecoin, was over $800 million. Now it's just $140,000,000. A comment from Sam Kazmani, founder of Frac, says it's a new low for DFI. So an important part of this story is that back in May, holders of the tribe token, the entity's governance token, all voted to make the community whole after the Rari hack by repaying the bad debt on behalf of the hacker. But the specifics would to be hammered out later. But then when the specifics were actually hammered out, the team with the majority owners of the tribe token, the actual centralized team voted no.
00:41:20.438 - 00:41:46.782, Speaker B: And the team said that, well, the original vote was non binding since it didn't take place on chain. Oof. Big lame, big lame. Okay, so going into the actual details of the proposal for the wind down of the faydao, which is coming out of the Faye team, there's three phases. A consolidation phase, a fuse hack repayment phase, and then a final redemption phase. Basically, consolidation is just like a liquidity phase. It's like let's just sell all the assets and get as much as liquidity as possible.
00:41:46.782 - 00:42:20.162, Speaker B: The current account ownership, asset ownerships of the fay Dow, the tribe Dow 50,000 staked ETH, 22,000 ETH. That 22,000 ETH is going to be converted into die using balancer. That 50,000 staked ETH, because it's illiquid, is going to be distributed to tribe token holders pro rada because they can't sell that. So they're just going to distribute the staked ether. There's 18.7 million L USD from the liquidity protocol is going to be converted to die using periodic trades on balancer or curve. And then, so that will be retained by the Dow temporarily.
00:42:20.162 - 00:42:51.394, Speaker B: And then they have some other assets, 1.5 million in ve bal, which is going to be traded OTC for Faye tribe or bow, 1.5 ohm traded OTC for Faye tribe or die. And then there's some liquidity fox tokens and index tokens, which I mean, very small amounts. After a lot of that staked ether gets distributed to the tribe token holders, you have phase two, which is the few hack repayments. Which of the remaining assets in the. Any of the assets that could be converted to die, that 22,000 ether and also that 18.7
00:42:51.394 - 00:43:13.578, Speaker B: million l USD that will be used to whatever is left will be paid back to the fuse hackers. And then there's the final repayment, which all Faye becomes wrapped die. So if you are a Faye holder, you basically become a Dai holder. Tribe becomes redeemable for a pro radic claim on all the remaining assets after setting aside Dai for backing Faye. And then that's basically it.
00:43:13.664 - 00:43:42.942, Speaker A: Well, what kind of sucks about this is it feels like it's. At least with blockfi, depositors didn't get a haircut, right. Equity holders got a haircut. And it seems like in this case, the people who are depositing into Rari, in this case, which was later merged into Faye, which is like what you were talking about, Faye and tribe is where this is all coming from. They are not getting protected. They're getting protected after all of the tribe equity holders.
00:43:43.006 - 00:43:46.820, Speaker B: Yeah, the tribe equity holders are like, I choose to pay myself.
00:43:47.270 - 00:43:48.114, Speaker A: Yes.
00:43:48.312 - 00:43:49.866, Speaker B: And not the hack victims.
00:43:49.918 - 00:43:52.934, Speaker A: Oh, and there was a governance proposal that said that we should.
00:43:52.972 - 00:43:54.786, Speaker B: We should pay victims, but it's.
00:43:54.818 - 00:44:15.870, Speaker A: Oh, that one doesn't count. No, that was a fake. Just. I'm with Sam. This is just kind of shit. Look, I don't know all of the details of this, so I hazard to talk too much about it, but in general, this doesn't strike me as a good thing or a good precedent or the right thing. This goes back to our episode with Hasu.
00:44:15.870 - 00:44:27.874, Speaker A: Investor protection rights kind of suck. And so do depositor rights. And so it's very much like, caveat empty. It's like, buyer beware when you're doing this kind of stuff.
00:44:27.992 - 00:44:54.220, Speaker B: This is something that, when we take this to Tradfi, tradfi is better than Defi. On this particular scenario, traditional equity holders rights, Defi failed here because we don't. Exactly. Yeah, this is something that, when we show to Gary Gensler, Gary Gensler's like, oh, this is great. This is good for me. I get to regulate this more. Yeah, this makes Gary Gensler right.
00:44:55.390 - 00:45:11.850, Speaker A: He's wrong because he wants to fix it the Gary Gensler way, which is like, make these things. There's also. It gives him more ammo, for sure. But. So I'm disappointed with that. Not with the wind down and them choosing to quit. But I'm disappointed with them not helping the fuse hack repayments.
00:45:11.850 - 00:45:31.270, Speaker A: But I'm more disappointed macroly in the class of 2021. David D five builders, and I'm not throwing everyone under this bus, but there have been a lot of them, and there have been a lot of DFI builders that I feel like have abandoned their projects just like orphan them. Things got a little tough, right?
00:45:31.420 - 00:45:33.106, Speaker B: Going got tough and they folded.
00:45:33.138 - 00:46:22.918, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel a little bit like DeFi grandpa over here saying back in my day, ruin Christian region and make Dow didn't quit when the going got tough. But that's a bit how I feel. And I just want to say, rather than calling out some of the DeFi projects that did abandon founders that did abandon their projects, I just want to give a shout out to all the DeFi founders that didn't. Even when the going got tough, and there are a lot of them, I created a thread where the community kind of tagged a lot of people here, and that gave me some hope that, you know what, a lot of Defi founders stayed with their projects, did not choose to abandon. I mean, ultimately, I don't understand why DeFi founders are taking this shortcut, reputational shortcut, when we're at the very first stages of a multi decade industry of like, you're going to abandon your project. People are going to remember that. I know I'm going to remember.
00:46:22.918 - 00:46:32.300, Speaker A: Bankless community will remember. And it might make it a little bit hard to reenter after you've done something like this. That's all I'll say. Defi grants over.
00:46:33.150 - 00:46:48.990, Speaker B: The sad part is that ether is such a lucratively bullish asset that if you exit into ether, you still get so much upside. So I think that's where a large minority incentive comes from. It's like, oh, if, like, abandon my project, I'll have enough ether to stake for life.
00:46:49.060 - 00:46:58.418, Speaker A: It's the same story, David, we saw this in the ICOs, right? A whole bunch of them just kind of did an ICO and they half asked their project, but then they kept all the ETH. Right.
00:46:58.504 - 00:47:12.726, Speaker B: But also I would, yeah, it's people that take money too early, right? That's another problem of Defi, is like, we fund people with way too much money way too soon, and they're like, wait, but I just made all the money. That was the point. I'm done here.
00:47:12.828 - 00:47:32.842, Speaker A: I know we got to work on that for sure, David. Next thing, though, is the bitboy story. Okay, so I don't watch Bitboy at all. I've never seen a bitboy. I've heard of him by reputation. So let me just say that. Could you give some people some context for who Bitboy is? I get the sense that there is a whole nother world of crypto YouTube out there.
00:47:32.842 - 00:47:36.638, Speaker A: We are barely YouTubers, by the way, if you're watching this on YouTube, we.
00:47:36.644 - 00:47:39.162, Speaker B: Are podcasters who put our stuff on YouTube.
00:47:39.226 - 00:47:51.620, Speaker A: We try our best. All right? We're not YouTube optimized yet, although we're getting better. Right, David? But anyway, Bitboy was purely crypto YouTube. And what was he all about? What was his.
00:47:52.230 - 00:48:09.698, Speaker B: I mean, he's got an insane following. I think he's got something like over a million followers. I called him. Well, I participated in some of this drama. I commented on Dejan Spartan's tweet thread, calling him, like, the Alex Jones of Crypto. And maybe we can get the editor to actually play that clip. Just a small showcase of who he is.
00:48:09.698 - 00:48:22.286, Speaker B: He's got this insane setup, just like a media studio office thing, kind of like how Alex Jones does, and then makes some just like, very ridiculous statements about crypto, like the one we're about to play right here.
00:48:22.388 - 00:48:31.018, Speaker A: I want to be very clear on this. The US government is 100% behind the crash of UST.
00:48:31.114 - 00:48:38.530, Speaker B: Anyways, very bombastic, dude. And also totally and completely known for just, like, dumping on his followers.
00:48:38.950 - 00:48:41.010, Speaker A: What do you mean dumping on his followers?
00:48:41.910 - 00:48:48.034, Speaker B: Signing deals, receiving tokens, pumping the tokens, and then selling the tokens. That's just the general pattern. Right?
00:48:48.072 - 00:48:48.322, Speaker A: Okay.
00:48:48.376 - 00:49:17.406, Speaker B: And I don't know this because I watch him personally. I know this because that's what everyone in my sphere comments on. And so it's to the point of, like, why would I ever go watch bitboy? Yeah. Anyways, so that's the start of the story. So here is a thread from a Twitter handle tagged atozi atozy. And he puts out this thread that says, I wish I didn't have to make this thread, but I'm being sued by YouTuber Bitboy crypto for a video I made roughly nine months ago covering how he promoted a project named Pamp. P a m p.
00:49:17.406 - 00:49:37.326, Speaker B: It's called pamp. Yeah. Last night, a third server, like, somebody who, like, I listened to this guy's YouTube video. He got served three different times, and the third person finally actually showed up with a real lawsuit, according to his house. Yeah. The first two were just, like, drafts of lawsuits. The third one was the actual lawsuit.
00:49:37.326 - 00:50:07.726, Speaker B: And so this crypto YouTuber, he made this YouTube video about Bitboy. It was like a journalist, like, yo, this guy dumps on his followers, he promotes, makes promotions, and then these tokens rug. And so this whole Pam token pumped, and then it went to zero after Bitboy covered it. And I think this is just like one of many, many things that Bitboy has covered. And so Ben Armstrong, aka Bitboy, says, erling Mensheng Jr. Which is a Tozi, posted a video on YouTube entitled this YouTuber scams his fans. Bitboy crypto in November 2021.
00:50:07.726 - 00:50:38.598, Speaker B: I'm reading out the details of the Bitboy filed lawsuit right now. The lawsuit claims a laundry list of offenses in that video, including defamation, infliction of emotional distress, torturous interference with business relations or potential business relations, violation of the Uniform Deceptive Practices act, and violation of the Fair Business Practices act. And so this is bitboy suing Atosi for these things. And all Satoshi did was talk about how Bitboy pumped this token and then dumped the token, and token went to.
00:50:38.604 - 00:50:41.026, Speaker A: Zero, which you can see on chain.
00:50:41.138 - 00:50:41.866, Speaker B: You can see it all.
00:50:41.888 - 00:50:44.358, Speaker A: It's back totally audited, not speculation.
00:50:44.454 - 00:50:56.480, Speaker B: And so this atozy person, he's just such a normal YouTuber, so he doesn't have the money to fight this lawsuit. So this is Bitboy, who makes bajillions of dollars pumping and dumping tokens. Again, allegedly. I'm pretty sure it's true, though.
00:50:57.410 - 00:51:00.560, Speaker A: David's I'm not going to showing up at our house.
00:51:01.490 - 00:51:28.886, Speaker B: You're going to see a GoFundMe for another bitboy lawsuit anyways. Bitboy coming in hard with paying a ton of lawyers to slam this guy with a bunch of lawsuits that he can't afford. So this crypto YouTuber, Atosi, spins up this gofundme with a $50,000 goal to defend him from Bitboy's lawsuit. And this is when it gets into crypto Twitter. And crypto Twitter doesn't like bitboy. No one likes Bitboy except for YouTubers or YouTube consumers who probably don't know better. And so crypto condom, excuse the name.
00:51:28.886 - 00:51:55.922, Speaker B: This is actually like a crypto community member who's pretty good. I will be donating to Atosi's legal fees relating to Bitboy's lawsuit. If you have the means, I encourage everyone else to donate, too. Scammers like Bitboy are a net negative to the space and should not be supported. If we don't police ourselves, no one else will. And so this is when this gofundme starts to actually gain some traction. And then coming up next, Kobe tweets out I'll send $100,000 later or something.
00:51:55.922 - 00:52:21.518, Speaker B: Win at PC. And then that gets 8000 likes. And then Toby follows up a little bit later, says, sent. And yes, Kobe actually did send $100,000 to this non crypto YouTuber. Normal crypto YouTubers, just like Ethereum address, I'm assuming. Ethereum address. And so what happens next, Ryan, is that bitboy drops the lawsuit.
00:52:21.518 - 00:52:35.334, Speaker B: And so this is autism capital saying hearing bitboy succumbs to social pressure and announced he's dropping the lawsuit. Can anyone verify? And then the next tweet says, yes, indeed. And so here's the clip that Bitboy said where he's on his own YouTube channel saying, I'm dropping the lawsuit.
00:52:35.382 - 00:52:40.506, Speaker A: Okay, where we're at is at this point, it has become public. It's become an absolute default.
00:52:40.538 - 00:52:42.638, Speaker B: We know Kobe gave him $100,000, so.
00:52:42.804 - 00:52:49.554, Speaker A: Hopefully that money will go to good use. But yeah, so we are going to drop lawsuit 100%. And I'm sorry this became public.
00:52:49.752 - 00:52:52.482, Speaker B: Ryan, you want to know my favorite quote from this little clip here?
00:52:52.536 - 00:52:53.538, Speaker A: Yeah, give it to me.
00:52:53.624 - 00:52:58.354, Speaker B: Where Bitboy says, I'm sorry this became public, is what he said.
00:52:58.472 - 00:53:00.260, Speaker A: I'm sorry I was found out.
00:53:00.970 - 00:53:05.682, Speaker B: I was found out to do frivolous lawsuits to allow myself to continue to dump on my followers.
00:53:05.746 - 00:53:26.974, Speaker A: Okay. But yeah, David, here's one thing that doesn't connect to me. This feels know victims keep going back to their abuser. Why does this person have YouTube views? Why does he have followers? Why do people subject themselves to, like.
00:53:27.092 - 00:53:49.598, Speaker B: Look at the production value of what? Right, like, fantastic production value. No wonder he has a million views. He's optimized the YouTube algorithm. He's played the game. He's got his ads everywhere. He's got his topics that he's run down. And this kind of goes back to the heart of crypto, I think, where there are some projects that you have these open source developers that just care about code, they don't know how to market.
00:53:49.598 - 00:54:22.154, Speaker B: And then you have other projects which market themselves to the very end, and that's the product, and they forget about the actual code development. This is the same thing. This is bitboy hyper marketing, optimized, knows crypto to enough extent to when people like, oh, I would like to know about crypto, I'll go to the most number one followed crypto YouTube channel, because clearly that's the best channel. And then they listen to bitboy, crypto, who's like, pamp. Token is going to pamp. It's in the name and then he's paid a promotion for that. And then token goes to zero, and he makes a bunch of money and then wash and repeat.
00:54:22.154 - 00:54:31.022, Speaker B: Because people these days have amnesia. They forget everything. I would say, why do people go back to their abusive relationship? Is because people have amnesia, Ryan. They forget.
00:54:31.166 - 00:54:48.790, Speaker A: Yeah, I've, you know, once commented that crypto, Twitter, crypto in general, has the memory of the, like, we just constantly forget things. But is this also a lesson that if bankless ever gets, if we ever get our stuff together and we increase our production value, people better be scared.
00:54:50.490 - 00:54:54.220, Speaker B: Okay, well, we do plan on increasing our YouTube production value.
00:54:54.910 - 00:55:00.540, Speaker A: He's looking back at his studio that he's just built, and he's like, uhoh, what did I just say?
00:55:02.270 - 00:55:03.598, Speaker B: I think you can do both.
00:55:03.684 - 00:55:04.766, Speaker A: It just takes longer.
00:55:04.868 - 00:55:07.082, Speaker B: You just got to not take shortcuts.
00:55:07.146 - 00:55:08.250, Speaker A: Don't take shortcuts.
00:55:08.330 - 00:55:19.198, Speaker B: Plus, the bankless community is intelligent. If we ever started pumping and dumping tokens, it would be over so fast, it wouldn't even take a half a second to like, oh, bankless went evil.
00:55:19.374 - 00:55:21.986, Speaker A: They wouldn't allow us to do that. They wouldn't let us do that.
00:55:22.088 - 00:55:23.490, Speaker B: We would go to zero so fast.
00:55:23.560 - 00:55:26.346, Speaker A: Man, what a story, though. That's crazy, Dan.
00:55:26.478 - 00:55:52.138, Speaker B: My favorite part about this, since they dropped a lawsuit, Atosi made $200,000 and he says, once I have it confirmed, it's officially pulled, I will be refunding everyone who donated. And then Kobe says, use my money, my $100,000 to pay for the gas fees for a lot of people, the individual donators. But then also, Kobe follows up and says, keep some for a vacation. To smiley face.
00:55:52.304 - 00:55:53.030, Speaker A: Kobe.
00:55:53.190 - 00:55:54.862, Speaker B: Kobe, well done.
00:55:54.916 - 00:55:55.374, Speaker A: Hey, look.
00:55:55.412 - 00:55:55.998, Speaker B: Well done.
00:55:56.084 - 00:56:16.546, Speaker A: Both of these lessons, right? It's like the last lesson is like, don't take shortcuts. This lesson is don't take shortcuts. Also, I love this concept of we can also police ourselves at the social layer, too. We need to do much more of that in crypto. Call these things out. So good job, a toesy YouTuber. Man, I am so not connected with crypto YouTube, though.
00:56:16.546 - 00:56:21.142, Speaker A: This just shows me that I'm just living in a different world. David, what do we got coming up next?
00:56:21.276 - 00:56:41.382, Speaker B: Oh, my God, so much. Okay, merge updates. We got some merge updates for you all. Of course, uniswap is getting a brain cue. That part of the wizard of Oz where the scarecrow says, if I only had a brain. There's a meme on that later. Between Nike and Adidas made $200 million in total NFT revenue.
00:56:41.382 - 00:57:17.826, Speaker B: But one of them made a lot more than the other. So we'll get into which ₩1 the NFT game in 2021. All of that and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible.

00:58:03.702 - 00:58:33.722, Speaker B: Crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world, but Crypto killer apps need Zksync as a platform to build on first. It's generally accepted that zero knowledge rollups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology. And Zksync is leading the charge into the final frontier of crypto economics. So if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof foundation which gives your users the best UX possible, check out Zksync's website at zksync IO. And yes, there's also going to be a token, so give them a follow on Twitter too at zksync.
00:58:33.866 - 00:58:50.514, Speaker A: Alright guys, we are back with another merge update. This is a date. Now it's an official date, not just a tweet on Twitter. It's a tweet from Tim Baco and the ethereum foundation. So Tim Baco says ethereum's transition to proof of stake is happening. Client releases are out. Update your node.
00:58:50.514 - 00:59:10.554, Speaker A: That's a thing you have to do if you're running a node. By the way, first part of the merge, Bellatrix, happens on September 6, and then the full transition ETA, September 15. Not even a date range, not even the 15th to the 16th. September 15. Mark your calendar, David, is that the official date, September 15, that is.
00:59:10.592 - 00:59:37.938, Speaker B: Well, no, because it's still an official TTD number. Total terminal difficulty. So there is no official date that TTD number can hop around, but it's an official TTD number which says the same thing. There's no new TTD number. The only thing that's new this week is that we have new client software that instantiates that TTD number into the clients. And so as soon as you update your clients, that TTD number goes into your client and then it's hands off from there that the Bellatrix activates. And then later is the merge.
00:59:37.938 - 00:59:56.300, Speaker B: The current estimated merge time right now is 06:20 a.m. Eastern time, Thursday, September 15. This number has been hopping around. It used to be like 08:00 a.m. Then it hopped around to like 04:00 a.m. And now it's at 06:20 a.m. But it's looking like Thursday early morning eastern time.
00:59:56.300 - 01:00:06.602, Speaker B: Pacific people and also eastern people. You're probably going to be in bed, but this number will continue to hop around. But zeroing in on Thursday morning, September 15.
01:00:06.746 - 01:00:15.834, Speaker A: This link in the show notes is a script that actually calculates it based on the current hash rate. So you can always get the update on that, even though you know bankless is going to update you on a weekly basis.
01:00:15.882 - 01:00:17.246, Speaker B: Yeah, we're going to talk about everything.
01:00:17.348 - 01:00:39.570, Speaker A: Going to happen until it actually happens. Because as Dune analytics says, the merge is coming. Here are the top dashboards to follow the action. Anything here we should pick out? I guess maybe a link for people and a resource for people if they want to follow the merge. There are a ton of dashboards from dune analytics where they can see the intricate details of all of the numbers that make up the merge. So anything here to point out, David?
01:00:39.650 - 01:00:48.826, Speaker B: Yeah, all six of these dashboards are fantastic. It's just a nice little command station to sing the merge. I don't really have anyone, particularly this favorite, but just as a resource, these.
01:00:48.848 - 01:00:59.470, Speaker A: Are available to know the bigger question, I think, is there was this rag of a publication, a terrible newsletter. Terrible, terrible newsletter that published an article.
01:00:59.810 - 01:01:01.914, Speaker B: Why would you ever publish this title?
01:01:02.042 - 01:01:25.160, Speaker A: Is the merge overhyped? Who published this? People who are not seeing on YouTube. This is bankless. Okay? This is a bankless article. We had our friend Jordy Alexander. Do you remember Jordy Alexander? So he came at a time when everyone was just so frothy, bullish about Terra Luna, and he took the bear case.
01:01:26.090 - 01:01:31.846, Speaker B: Very difficult at the time, difficult position to take the bear case for Terra Luna at its peak.
01:01:31.958 - 01:01:56.798, Speaker A: When was this? April. Did we do this? March, April? Something like this. Like about a month before the terra collapse, essentially. And Jordy took the position that, I know everyone's bullish on this thing, but there are a few tail risk events you really should look at, and I think they're fairly high probability. A month later, it's completely beat up. And by the way, a lot of people coming out of that debate thought Jordy lost the debate.
01:01:56.894 - 01:02:06.242, Speaker B: Yes, they were more, yeah, Jose, the other guy, just absolutely sweeped the floor with him. But then if you go back to the YouTube comments, they're all like, oh, like now.
01:02:06.296 - 01:02:07.460, Speaker A: Oh, really? Yeah.
01:02:08.250 - 01:02:30.122, Speaker B: If you see the chart of viewers on that video, it's the normal curve. And then Tara collapses and it gets another huge bump because people went back and watched it. And so the four month old YouTube comments are like, jordy got railed by Jose. And then the three month old YouTube comments are like, oh, jordy was right. Oh, Jordy got it right.
01:02:30.176 - 01:02:40.526, Speaker A: Wow. Jordy was right. But here's this case. We asked Jordy to write an ETH Bear article for us. ETH merge Bear article. Because David and I couldn't bring ourselves to write that. All right.
01:02:40.526 - 01:03:06.674, Speaker A: Because we don't actually. But fantastic article. And I think anytime we have a thesis on something or bullish on something, we'd love to get kind of the counter to that. Or the Steelman case or why not? And I think Jordy puts in a fantastic steel man case. So a few things. By the way, this is full of fantastic memes throughout the article, but let me try to summarize some of his high level takes and get your reaction to this. David as an ETH bull.
01:03:06.674 - 01:03:20.282, Speaker A: Right. So one thing he says is that, yeah, there's these three dragons to the triple happening to the ETH merge bullishness. One is reduced issuance. He says, yes, I understand that. That's pretty bullish. I get it. The second is EIP 15.
01:03:20.282 - 01:03:44.034, Speaker A: Five nine, burn. And the third is locked staked ETH. Okay, so he's good with the reduced issuance, but he says burn has been down pretty bad. Okay. Like, look at burn over time. So it's because blockspace is in much lower demand than it was during defi summer, and then later NFT, like the whole NFT boom. And then if you look at, like this past summer, David, we're not even.
01:03:44.072 - 01:03:46.602, Speaker B: Deflationary at this point, deflationary.
01:03:46.686 - 01:04:24.670, Speaker A: And so what's with your ultrasound money, merge money if it's not even deflationary? That's what Jordy's saying. And there's not an indication, he says, that a positive catalyst ahead that will actually bring this block space demand back. Maybe it goes to alternative layer ones, maybe it goes to L2s that don't consume as much block space revenue. So there's that. And then he also chips into the ETH staking rate, and he says it's actually a lot lower than a lot of people are saying. So he calculates the ETH staking rate at steady state in 2023 to be closer to like 1% to 2% yield.
01:04:26.050 - 01:04:27.666, Speaker B: In real terms, is what he's saying.
01:04:27.768 - 01:04:59.434, Speaker A: In real terms, yes. You stake your ETH, and maybe you're getting like three or 4%, but then you have to subtract the issuance of ETH, which is maybe one and a half percent. So you're left with like one to 2% real yield. And he's like, no one's going to be super excited about that. And he's calculating this based on a whole bunch of more people will stake, right? And so the yield goes down, and so maybe you'll get like 20 to 30 million ETH staked in the network. And I can't remember what it is right now, David, but it's like 15 million ETH. I can't even remember.
01:04:59.434 - 01:05:12.138, Speaker A: I shouldn't even say that, but it's a lot less now. And so these are some of his bare thesis cases for why the merge won't really matter. What was your take when you read the high level of this article?
01:05:12.314 - 01:05:34.200, Speaker B: My high level article was that Jordy is making an argument against an outdated bull case, outdated stats, and so he's taking like May 2021 or November 2021 gas price gas markets, and he's making his argument that it's not bullish against that. And I mean, we have since then.
01:05:34.730 - 01:05:35.800, Speaker A: Look at this.
01:05:36.810 - 01:06:02.938, Speaker B: Sorry to the podcast listeners who don't see this. I'm not going to explain this one. And so he's making like yes, there was previously more bullish parts of the Ethereum economy. Gas prices used to be a lot higher. Therefore, the Ethereum burn used to be a lot more, and it's no longer the case. Since then, we've adjusted the numbers, the yield numbers. If we had May 2021 gas prices, we were looking at a 15% yield on staking ether.
01:06:02.938 - 01:06:36.806, Speaker B: And we used to say that on the weekly roll up, because that used to be the data, but that is no longer the data. And now we've adjusted down to where it is now at like 5.2% without MeV and maybe, perhaps maybe six plus percent with MEV. But Jordy is taking a slice of data that was in the bull. So that's the gas market thing. Now, I will say that the ETH supply reduction was always going to be more significant than the ether burn. Simply, just like when you compare those things, there's less ether issued.
01:06:36.838 - 01:06:40.582, Speaker A: That's the main thing. Bulls are bullish on how it's the supply reduction.
01:06:40.646 - 01:07:19.880, Speaker B: Right? And so even if you take the most bearish gas fees, which is at like seven or 8%, that goes from zero point 43% ether issuance down to 0.2%. So the burn just lowers it by a measly 0.2%. But it's cutting the issuance down by 50% because it already is so low. And so this bullcase is still strong. And if you go and compare it to bitcoin issuance at like 1.5% or Salana issuance and avalanche issuance at like six and 7%, it's still fundamentally bullish. It's just not ultra uber mega bullish that it would have been if we had merged during, like, DFI summer, for example.
01:07:19.880 - 01:07:21.450, Speaker B: That's a gas market thing.
01:07:21.520 - 01:07:54.094, Speaker A: Did you see this argument, too? It's like one side staked. ETH will be locked off the market. Yeah, you're super happy about this, but then you realize the unlock will hang over us for over a year. This is because everyone is essentially depositing if they're staking, and it's one way, but then there will be this big unlocking event maybe a year from now, and all of that 1520, 30 million worth of ETH is suddenly unlocked. And his argument is the market's going to price that in ahead of time, too. And that makes the case less bullish and maybe bearish.
01:07:54.222 - 01:08:21.398, Speaker B: Sure, the market will price it in, but we need to make sure. Are all the unlockers going to be sellers? Because I don't think necessarily so. Typically we use this word unlock or investing unlocks for angel investors or seed investors that got in at valuations one 10th or one 100th and so of the supply of the asset. So of course they're going to sell. It doesn't matter what price that it's at. They're going to sell because they're up so much. That's not the case with ether.
01:08:21.398 - 01:08:55.266, Speaker B: The average ether deposit price, I think, is like 700 or $800. So the average person is up a two x. And so, yeah, maybe. Obviously, some people have had their stuff like illiquid for so long that they're going to sell, but I don't really think it's going to turn this into this systemic sell event when the APYs go up too, by the way, up from 4% up to like five, six, maybe 7% if MEV is really strong. I don't really think they're like, we use this term unlocked to be like, oh, investors. Unlocks are totally going to dump. That's not true with ether stakers.
01:08:55.266 - 01:09:30.418, Speaker B: Ether stakers are fundamentally bullish. That's the whole point of proof of stake, is that you reward ether holders who want to be long term holders. And so the people that stake their ether, back when ether price was like $300 to $700, they're the people who are like, yeah, I'm fine with having my ether be illiquid for two years, three years, an unknown amount of time. They're fundamentally the most bullish ether owners there are because they take the illiquidity of it and they don't care about that. So they're not likely to be sellers. So I don't really think it's fair to say that all of these, finally we get this big unlocking and everyone runs for the exit so they can dump their tokens. I don't see that happening.
01:09:30.584 - 01:09:33.294, Speaker A: Well, anyway, I think we could have an entire episode.
01:09:33.422 - 01:09:34.706, Speaker B: No, I'm not done. We got one more point.
01:09:34.728 - 01:09:35.282, Speaker A: You're not done.
01:09:35.336 - 01:10:14.450, Speaker B: We got one more point. And so his last argument is that the yields go down to a super low amount. Can you go to that part in the article that if we have something like 30,000 ether staked? And Ryan, I pulled this up, right now there's 14,000 ether staked. If we get something like 30,000 ether staked, the issuance of Ethereum goes up, because as more people stake, the more ether is issued to reward those people. The yield, the per validator yield goes down, but total ether issuance goes up. And so that's his argument that, well, we have increasing actual ether inflation and decreasing yields for stakers. And so the yields are actually going to be way lower than people expect.
01:10:14.450 - 01:10:25.730, Speaker B: But he's missing the part that the way to get to like 30,000 plus ether staked is 16,000 million ether comes off the market and begins staking.
01:10:26.550 - 01:10:28.786, Speaker A: 16 million ether, 16 million ether comes.
01:10:28.808 - 01:10:41.250, Speaker B: Off the market and begins staking. And so he skipped over the bullish part of that, which is that a bunch of ether gets locked up. So you can't forget that bull side. And that is my complete rebuttal of the bear case for the merge.
01:10:41.330 - 01:10:50.540, Speaker A: It's not complete. Come on. It's sounding like David wants to get on a podcast with Jordy and really hash this out and have a debate. But I also remember what happened to the last guy who did that.
01:10:51.310 - 01:10:55.630, Speaker B: Maybe the last guy was defending Terra and I'm defending Ethereum.
01:10:56.130 - 01:11:20.838, Speaker A: I do think if there's demand in bankless nation, if you guys are excited about this, let us know. Maybe we'll have a Hal press plus David plus Jordy plus another bear debate on this. Maybe we'll get check matey in the scene or something. Anyway, a lot of discussion about this, and I think it's really fun to look at both sides of the argument. David, let's get to this. Uniswap has a brain. That's what you've been saying in the tease to this.
01:11:20.838 - 01:11:23.266, Speaker A: What do you mean by this? How is uniswap getting a brain?
01:11:23.378 - 01:11:54.170, Speaker B: Uniswap uni governance voted overwhelmingly at 86 million to 770. So like, call it 99.9% yes to create the Uniswap foundation. We've talked about this, the precursors for this. There was a governance proposal and also a sentiment check. But now formal vote token snapshot vote has gone through overwhelmingly in support of creating the Uniswap foundation. So what does this mean? What are the details of this? The blog post says there is work to do to help uniswap reach its full potential.
01:11:54.170 - 01:12:32.438, Speaker B: The governance process has too much friction, the ecosystem is too difficult to navigate, and the UGP Uniswap governance process in its current form is not able to fund the most ambitious and impactful projects. We want to change that. Today we are excited to propose the creation of the Uniswap foundation, which has the submission to support the decentralized growth and sustainability of the Uniswap protocol and its supporting ecosystem and community. Today we are thrilled to propose the creation of the Uniswap foundation. And then some details. Scope, team, budget and governance participation scope. The UF, the first foundation of a major protocol to go through the community governance process, will support the protocol's decentralized growth, reinvigorate governance, and serve as a protocol advocate.
01:12:32.438 - 01:13:03.254, Speaker B: The team behind this is going to be Devin Walsh, who will serve as executive director, and Ken Ang, who will serve as head of operations. They also have a team of twelve behind them. They've got some budget requests as well. $14 million of operating budget to cover a team for three years, and $60 million expanded Uniswap grants program budget to cover three plus years. So they are requesting a total of $74 million from the Uniswap Dow, which will be broken up into two disbursements. A first disbursement of $20 million. And lastly in governance participation, also requesting 2.5
01:13:03.254 - 01:13:20.826, Speaker B: million uni to participate in governance, primarily through delegation, through usage of a new smart contract privilege called the franchiser. And this uni will be revocable by the Dow at any time and cannot be used for any purposes outside of governance. So uniswap getting the foundation. Nice.
01:13:20.928 - 01:13:35.410, Speaker A: Okay, so one question I have on that, David, is the $74 million that's going to fund the Uniswap foundation, where is that coming from? I would imagine it's got to be like uni token sales at some level from the Dow, maybe?
01:13:35.560 - 01:13:40.946, Speaker B: Yeah. If not already, then future know. I don't know.
01:13:41.048 - 01:14:14.218, Speaker A: That's one interesting thing to check into. But am I also understanding that? So we have three pieces here. We have the protocol. Right. Uniswap itself, which is not a legal entity or anything else, it's smart contract code. And then we have Uniswap Labs, which is the thing Hayden and team are doing that is venture backed, that is continuing to buy companies and create tools for the Uniswap ecosystem. And then now we also have this uniswap foundation, and their job will be to kind of steward the protocol itself a bit more and I guess grow it.
01:14:14.218 - 01:14:15.598, Speaker A: Is that the model here?
01:14:15.684 - 01:14:22.938, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. Right. And I've looked into the governance proposal. It's all coming out of the uni token. Yes. So this is all funded by the uni token.
01:14:23.114 - 01:14:39.270, Speaker A: So this will create some sell pressure, I think, in uni in the short run. Now, they're doing this in chunks, like first distribution of 20 million and then kind of the remaining. But also, you could say bullish on uniswap getting a brain. If this foundation, that's the bullish.
01:14:40.250 - 01:15:25.842, Speaker B: Who cares about $20 million of sell pressure? That's a blip uni token is actually pretty illiquid. The point is that Uniswap can be just more organized. If you listen to our podcast episode with Hazu, these dows need direction and centralization. Centralization is not a bad word and the foundation can do this. In addition to the two, to Ken Eng and Devin Walsh, we also have some advisors. Jesse Walden from variant Julia Rosenberg from Orca Protocol, Alexis Galba from open and Hart Lambert from Uma. And then they also have already talked about some proposals that they're trying to get done, which is building uniswap in the Cairo language for Starknet and other things that I think the uniswap without a brain just might not have been able to get done.
01:15:25.842 - 01:15:30.994, Speaker B: So I think that is the reason why we should be bullish here, is that execution, execution matters.
01:15:31.042 - 01:15:41.610, Speaker A: And if you're curious to why it doesn't have a brain, why Uniswap Labs is not necessarily that full brain. I think the Hasu podcast is the answer to your question. But here's a nice meme, the scarecrow.
01:15:42.590 - 01:15:49.750, Speaker B: Scarecrow from wizard of the Oz. There's that one song where the scarecrow's cut only had a brain, but this one's if I only had a foundation.
01:15:49.830 - 01:16:09.378, Speaker A: This is every doubt, by the way, dancing around like a scarecrow. Okay, this is cool. This is a tweet from blockworks. But did you know, David, this is another chart from Dune Analytics. Nike and Adidas had NFTs last year. Nike revenue was $185,000,000.
01:16:09.544 - 01:16:10.366, Speaker B: Damn.
01:16:10.478 - 01:16:21.686, Speaker A: Adidas was 11 million, but in total. So Nike absolutely swamped the floor with adidas. But think about how much money that is for Nike from NFTs. What do you think the cost of these NFTs were?
01:16:21.788 - 01:16:26.630, Speaker B: Very little, 3 million. And right, I bet you the biggest cost was legal, 10 million.
01:16:26.700 - 01:16:34.970, Speaker A: Yeah, but think about these profit margins. So if you think that large corporations are just going to pass this by.
01:16:35.040 - 01:16:36.700, Speaker B: Pass up this free money.
01:16:38.430 - 01:16:39.126, Speaker A: You don't.
01:16:39.158 - 01:16:46.826, Speaker B: Understand how secondary trading volume of Nike, NFTs, $1.3 billion of secondary trading volume.
01:16:46.938 - 01:16:47.454, Speaker A: Crazy.
01:16:47.572 - 01:16:49.278, Speaker B: You know they have royalties on that.
01:16:49.444 - 01:16:55.250, Speaker A: Look at these other brands, too. Dolce and Cabana are here. Tiffany's here. Gucci here. Adidas here. Budweiser here. Time magazine here.
01:16:55.250 - 01:16:59.220, Speaker A: NFT. Nice. NFTs are just a fad, never coming back.
01:16:59.590 - 01:17:10.920, Speaker B: Okay, so look at that data. There's two columns there. Primary sales revenue, $93 million for Nike. $92 million in royalties off of that secondary volume. Crazy.
01:17:11.690 - 01:17:24.102, Speaker A: Yeah. More companies are going to join this and NFT market will be back, I'm sure. But in the short run, we are seeing some resurgence in some of the other classic non corporate NFTs. Pudgy penguins.
01:17:24.166 - 01:17:31.718, Speaker B: Pudgy penguins pump 83% as meta and Nanson executives join advisory board. Ryan.
01:17:31.814 - 01:17:33.302, Speaker A: Meta Facebook.
01:17:33.446 - 01:17:35.914, Speaker B: Yeah. Right. You want to hear a funny story, Ryan?
01:17:35.962 - 01:17:36.318, Speaker A: Yes.
01:17:36.404 - 01:17:40.878, Speaker B: You know when we were talking about how I was moving wallets a while ago?
01:17:40.964 - 01:17:41.406, Speaker A: Yes.
01:17:41.508 - 01:17:50.050, Speaker B: Well, I'm also slowly doing that for my NFT wallet and just like getting rid of all these NFTs that I thought were dead. And so I sold my pudgies, literally two days.
01:17:50.120 - 01:17:50.734, Speaker A: No, you didn't.
01:17:50.782 - 01:18:01.906, Speaker B: Before, this was, it was like perfectly ironic. It's like I sell these things just because I don't really know what's happening with these things. These are just some JPEG.
01:18:01.938 - 01:18:03.830, Speaker A: I would assume they're dead, too.
01:18:03.980 - 01:18:12.154, Speaker B: Yeah. And then literally out of nowhere, that has the biggest research interest of all time. It was like literally the pico bottom. It was fantastic. It was great.
01:18:12.192 - 01:18:17.580, Speaker A: Why you listen to bankless for your NFT alpha every single week? Because Dave and I know what we're doing.
01:18:18.670 - 01:18:20.086, Speaker B: We know what we're doing with the JPeGs.
01:18:20.118 - 01:18:38.334, Speaker A: Do you know, we do know a little bit about Defi. And this is kind of a blend of Defi plus NFTs, this thing called Bendao, which is basically like, I think of it as maker. It's like collateralized loans backed by NFTs. But there was kind of a crisis last week with Bendow. What happened? Yeah.
01:18:38.372 - 01:19:02.138, Speaker B: So bendow NFT liquidity protocol. Of course, you can put your NFTs into Bendow and borrow ETH against them. Some of the top NFT profile collections in there, Azukis board, ape, yacht clubs, clone X, cryptopunks, doodles, mutant apes and space doodles. And the thing is that once upon a time, Bendow had about 18,000 ETH earlier last weekend, and that went down to 15, not 15,015.
01:19:02.224 - 01:19:02.662, Speaker A: Yikes.
01:19:02.726 - 01:19:53.462, Speaker B: 15 ETH. It's currently back up to 4500 as of a couple of days ago. But basically what happened was that all of the ETH, you lend your ETH to bendow and then you get a yield on that ETH, very strong yield. And then that bendow lends out that east to people that collateralize their NFTs. You could get an 80% yield on your ether because they were in such a short supply of ether, because all these NFT collateralization people were borrowing were borrowed up. All the ETH they used, all the bandwidth it's like if compound utilization, if compound has like $100,000 of USDC in it, and then there's $98,000, 98% of that USDC is utilized, they're going to jack up the interest rates to incentivize people to pay back their ether. So what's going on here is they jacked up the interest rates or yields paid to ether lenders.
01:19:53.462 - 01:20:33.026, Speaker B: And they also, what they did in order to fix this, just like credit crunch they had, is that they passed emergency parameters to progressively lower the liquidation threshold from 95% to a new baseline of 70% incoming on September 20. So it's going to go from where it is now at 95% to where it will be in the future at 75% or 70%. Basically like making liquidations more likely to happen. Increasing, it's like increasing the interest rates. The bendao, if it's like a makerdao, they're increasing the interest rates and making more strict capital requirements for NFT lenders so that they can pay back their loans and get ether back into the coffers. I will say this is not a failure. This is actually quite the opposite.
01:20:33.026 - 01:20:51.002, Speaker B: I would say this is a big success. It was so successful that all the borrowers used up all the ether and they just had to jack up the interest rates. The first time maker Dow had to go through a cycle die was trading below a peg, and they had to jack up interest rates from like 0.5% to almost 20%.
01:20:51.056 - 01:20:52.698, Speaker A: I remember feel like this is the.
01:20:52.704 - 01:20:59.262, Speaker B: Same thing with Bendow. It's like, yo, everyone's using the protocol. We ran out of credit. We need to jack up interest rates so we can get more.
01:20:59.316 - 01:21:05.930, Speaker A: Yeah, but they almost went insolvent in the process, right? So they bent, they didn't break, but.
01:21:06.100 - 01:21:15.762, Speaker B: I wouldn't call it insolvency. They just had more loans outstanding than they could issue. They couldn't issue any more loans. They didn't have enough money in the system.
01:21:15.896 - 01:21:24.694, Speaker A: There is a great explanation, if you want all the details from William Pister, who does know a thing or two about NFTs in metaversal. And you can read through that.
01:21:24.812 - 01:21:27.202, Speaker B: Ryan was joking earlier, we don't know shit about NFTs.
01:21:27.266 - 01:22:05.010, Speaker A: I think one of the things, though, David, is that Ben Dow has definitely learned through this episode is that NFTs are not quite as liquid as maybe they thought they were. So it's one thing if you're selling ETH as collateral in a maker type auction, because you have to liquidate. It's another thing, when you've got like 50 board apes and you're trying to find buyers for those things, of course that's what makes them non fungible and lower liquidity profile in them. Right now, David Gensler's back. What's he saying now? He wrote a op ed in the Wall Street Journal. I read part of this. It was also paywalled.
01:22:05.010 - 01:22:31.810, Speaker A: Maybe there are a few choice tweets or choice quotes we can take out of it. But basically his take is there's no reason to treat the crypto market differently from the rest of the capital markets just because it uses a different technology. The fax machine and the Internet are the same thing. That was my paraphrase. That's not his paraphrase, that end part. But I feel like that's kind of what he's saying. What are your thoughts on this, David?
01:22:31.910 - 01:23:10.582, Speaker B: He also made a video on this, and basically he's saying like, oh, yeah, crypto markets, traditional equities markets, they're the same thing. Therefore, we should regulate both of them, which is a hot take. But also just like you're trying to have your cake and eat it, too. It's like you're saying you want to regulate the crypto markets, and therefore we should treat crypto markets like the traditional equities markets. But then you're also not treating us fairly. And this is what Kobe said when he followed up and says, sounds good, spot ETF then. Because if Gensler says, okay, we're going to treat the crypto markets like we treat the traditional equities markets, that means we get spot ETFs.
01:23:10.582 - 01:23:22.694, Speaker B: That's what that means. And so he says, the SEC, according to Gary Gensler, should regulate the crypto markets just like they regulate the traditional equities markets. But then he also doesn't want to treat us normally.
01:23:22.742 - 01:23:24.362, Speaker A: So there's a double standard at play.
01:23:24.416 - 01:23:25.758, Speaker B: Yeah, huge double standard.
01:23:25.844 - 01:23:29.710, Speaker A: There's a double standard. But he also doesn't understand that this is a much different technology.
01:23:29.780 - 01:23:30.782, Speaker B: Literally not like that.
01:23:30.836 - 01:23:44.110, Speaker A: It's kind of like covering your eyes and plugging your ears and just kind of ignoring the differences between crypto and the traditional equities markets, of which the differences are also vast. These are two different technologies. It's fax machine versus Internet.
01:23:44.270 - 01:23:49.670, Speaker B: And I would definitely say that Gary Gensler is playing this narrative game. He knows they're not the same.
01:23:49.740 - 01:23:52.790, Speaker A: He used to teach classes at MIT about blockchain.
01:23:53.530 - 01:24:03.994, Speaker B: He's doing a PR stunt saying, hey, the SEC is going to regulate the crypto markets because they're the same as equities markets. There's no new magic here. The SEC is going to regulate these things.
01:24:04.032 - 01:24:25.902, Speaker A: It's just not hard. We can have a nuanced conversation about what pieces are the same because there are parts that are the same as the equities markets. Some of these things are different. Let's have a nuanced conversation about that and let's get some clarity. Mark Cuban had a tweet, take two. He says to Gary Gensler, who says there's no reason to treat the crypto market differently. Just come in and talk to me.
01:24:25.902 - 01:25:02.586, Speaker A: Mark Cuban says, come in and talk to who set up an appointment. How you using calendly these days? Since you understand crypto lending and finances, why don't you just publish bright line guidelines you would like to see and open it up for comments? We don't want regulation legislation by Wall Street Journal op ed. All we're asking for at some clear treat us the same guidelines or even treat us the same and don't have a double standard. Very confusing here. But seriously, Gary, come on the podcast. I think the best way of clearing all this up is to engage with the crypto community. That's what you should be doing.
01:25:02.586 - 01:25:15.220, Speaker A: We'd love to have you on bankless. Sincerely, we've had Hester purse on, we've had other CFTC regulators on. We would love to have Gary Gensler on. Pretty friendly. We could talk about this, give us your perspective. David, you have a take.
01:25:15.830 - 01:25:42.950, Speaker B: The thing is, people outside of the crypto industry have noticed Gary's lack of popularity. And so this also an article that came out in Forbes, I believe. Yeah, Forbes was titled Gary Gensler, colon resign from a writer called Roslyn Layton from the international tech policy. Not a crypto person. But Gary Gensler is losing the public support, like left and right. And so Gary Gensler like got to win hearts and minds. And you can do that by coming on bankless.
01:25:43.030 - 01:25:57.150, Speaker A: Yeah. We don't want you to resign until you tell us what you really think about crypto and we can have a good conversation first. Come on, bankless. All right, David, do you know Coinbase's Ens integration is finally out in the wild? What does this mean?
01:25:57.300 - 01:26:40.246, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is in the Coinbase wallet, I'm pretty sure not the normal Coinbase consumer app. But if you are a Coinbase wallet user, you get an ens name built into that wallet. So this is a user who's got debanked CB id. Interestingly, Ryan, not ETH. Did that catch your attention? There's no ETH, but it is actually an Ens integration. And so from the article it says, on a technical level, both CB ID and ETH can be used on multiple networks. We determined that most users associate ETH Ids solely with Ethereum, and so Coinbase chose Cb iD because they want to make it easier for people to understand that a username is not tied to Ethereum and can be used on multiple networks.
01:26:40.246 - 01:27:00.690, Speaker B: However, did you know, Ryan, that your ETH name can work in bitcoin wallets and litecoin wallets and dogecoin wallets by run by the ENS standard? And so Coinbase wallet is just kind of making that a little bit more formal. Cb id saying, hey, this can work for your Ethereum address, but it can also work for your bitcoin address. It can also work for your.
01:27:00.760 - 01:27:03.774, Speaker A: What's happening here? Coinbase is just giving these to all of its users?
01:27:03.822 - 01:27:07.742, Speaker B: Yeah, basically. And all of its users who are using the Coinbase wallet.
01:27:07.806 - 01:27:15.062, Speaker A: Users are becoming decentralized. Either claim your current username or decline and get a random 20 character username. So you get your own ens name.
01:27:15.116 - 01:27:16.774, Speaker B: You get one by default. Yeah, that's cool.
01:27:16.812 - 01:27:20.954, Speaker A: What is this extension, though? Cb ID. What is this?
01:27:21.152 - 01:27:23.866, Speaker B: I think it just means identification identifier. Yeah, but.
01:27:23.888 - 01:27:26.140, Speaker A: I know, but how are they getting a.
01:27:27.710 - 01:27:31.690, Speaker B: Guess this has something to do with DNS.
01:27:32.110 - 01:27:35.770, Speaker A: There's a DNS ID? Like a, like a.
01:27:35.930 - 01:27:56.280, Speaker B: So another fun fact of ENS is that it's actually DNS compliant. It also operates with the traditional DNS system. And I think, I don't know the details beyond this, but like the ID is a DNS thing. Actually, Ryan, go and type in this into your URL. It worked.
01:27:57.930 - 01:27:59.046, Speaker A: It took you back here.
01:27:59.148 - 01:28:00.760, Speaker B: You already had the web page pulled up.
01:28:01.530 - 01:28:03.560, Speaker A: You just sent me back to the same site.
01:28:04.010 - 01:28:12.940, Speaker B: But it worked. I think this also works. No, this doesn't work with David Hoffman ETH, does it?
01:28:13.630 - 01:28:15.180, Speaker A: Debang, find out.
01:28:18.190 - 01:28:23.578, Speaker B: No, it doesn't work with David Hoffman ETH. The id name is a DNS name.
01:28:23.744 - 01:28:25.514, Speaker A: That's why you have every browser.
01:28:25.642 - 01:28:27.434, Speaker B: Exactly. It works in your browser.
01:28:27.482 - 01:28:34.198, Speaker A: Yeah, but that's not completely decentralized because there's still some DNS linkage there, I suppose.
01:28:34.394 - 01:28:34.898, Speaker B: Whatever.
01:28:34.984 - 01:28:36.882, Speaker A: Okay, cool. That's cool.
01:28:36.936 - 01:28:37.458, Speaker B: Getting better.
01:28:37.544 - 01:28:41.102, Speaker A: Swell. What is swell? Are they another staking provider?
01:28:41.246 - 01:29:00.210, Speaker B: Yeah, staking as a service provider. Basically. Swell is a hybrid between rocket pool and lido. So they have a permissioned validator set which allows for capital efficiency, but they also have a permissionless validator set. Which allows for permissionlessness. And so they had a testnet launch not too long ago. Now they have a guarded launch coming soon.
01:29:00.210 - 01:29:05.430, Speaker B: And so swell network is coming out. New staking as a service protocol. We got to love that competition.
01:29:05.510 - 01:29:14.062, Speaker A: That's awesome. Also more competition, of course, in L2 world. So just a reminder now, I think there are five days. Is it five or four days?
01:29:14.196 - 01:29:14.702, Speaker B: Five days.
01:29:14.756 - 01:29:32.082, Speaker A: Okay, five days till Arbitrum releases Nitro, which is the next release of Arbitrum. And of course, the TLDR is this is faster, cheaper transactions for you if you are an arbitrum user. Awesome to see L2s upgrading as well. David, speaking of upgrades, you have an opportunity to upgrade your job right now.
01:29:32.136 - 01:29:33.010, Speaker B: Upgrade your job.
01:29:33.080 - 01:29:37.038, Speaker A: Okay, this is our reminder to you to what, David?
01:29:37.214 - 01:29:40.758, Speaker B: Get a job in crypto because it's the most fun place to have a job.
01:29:40.844 - 01:29:41.430, Speaker A: Absolutely.
01:29:41.580 - 01:29:42.354, Speaker B: That's the rule.
01:29:42.402 - 01:30:03.398, Speaker A: What could be more fun? Number one jobs. I'm going to read some out for you. Masari, looking for a software engineer. Two software engineers, one for media, one for market data. Dydx backend, software engineer, steakfish, a business partner HR business partner, steakfish, a backend full stack. Software engineer, steakfish, front end software engineer, steakfish DevOps. Engineer, bankless.
01:30:03.398 - 01:30:23.234, Speaker A: We need somebody to run our podcast, edit them, media operations boardroom labs. Software engineer, Dow governance Mandacore labs manager of crypto marketing. Bank needs a thread or and a senior newsletter editor and marketing coordinator at Vertex Protocol. Lots more. Bankless academy needs a product manager. You can find out more, of course. Look at all these.
01:30:23.234 - 01:30:26.018, Speaker A: I'm scrolling through them for all the people that job boards, for all the.
01:30:26.024 - 01:30:28.474, Speaker B: People that watch the YouTube. I'm aware of my dancing. It's extremely cringe.
01:30:28.542 - 01:30:31.638, Speaker A: No one's ever said anything that I've seen. David must be great.
01:30:31.804 - 01:30:32.982, Speaker B: I can feel it.
01:30:33.116 - 01:30:34.760, Speaker A: All right, what's going on next?
01:30:35.450 - 01:31:10.846, Speaker B: Coming up next, we got questions from the nation. Which L2 are you most bullish on and why? And also, how can you explain the merge to normies? And also, of course, some hot takes from crypto, Twitter, the meme of the week. And also, a fantastic moment of Zen coming out from Gabriel Haynes. It's about Bitboy Ryan. So all that coming up and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. Juno is bringing crypto friendly banking straight into your checking account. With Juno, you can send money from your Juno checking account straight onto a L2 like Polygon optimism, arbitrum and they have Zksync and Starknet.

Bankless the Brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 Internet with over 60 million monthly active users.
01:31:42.326 - 01:32:09.534, Speaker B: And inside the brave browser, you'll find the brave wallet, the secure, multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser. Web three is freedom from big tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy. But there's a weak point in web3. Your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed. But the brave wallet is different. No extensions are required, which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets. Brave wallet is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains, including Ethereum and Salana.
01:32:09.534 - 01:32:28.522, Speaker B: You can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp. And of course, you can store, send and swap your crypto assets, manage your NFTs, and connect to other wallets and DFI apps. So whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro, it's time to ditch those risky extensions and it's time to switch to the brave wallet. Download Brave@brave.com slash bankless and click the wallet icon to get started.
01:32:28.576 - 01:32:54.206, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back, starting with the questions for the nation, of course. A reminder, if you have a question for Dave and myself, follow bankless on Twitter. That's bankless HQ on Twitter. We tweet it out. You can reply to the thread, get your question answered. The first one is from two commas ETH. How do I summarize and explain the importance of the merge and its implications to my normie friends who ask me about it? It's a good question from two commas ETH.
01:32:54.206 - 01:33:01.170, Speaker A: Explain it like I'm five. David, how do you explain the merge to someone who doesn't know anything about crypto? Doesn't really care about crypto.
01:33:01.250 - 01:33:17.286, Speaker B: God, these are all so hard. All right, I'm going to go for it. Okay. Ethereum. It's the number two blockchain behind bitcoin. It's the thing that created Defi and smart contracts and allows us to do things like decentralized finance stuff, borrowing and lending, trading, et cetera. So that's a big blockchain.
01:33:17.286 - 01:33:46.430, Speaker B: It's got the majority of all economic activity inside of crypto created NFTs. It's that blockchain. It's the big blockchain. It's proof of work, which is that thing that consumes a lot of electricity, which a lot of people in the outside world don't like. And it's always been proof of work, but it's always wanted to go to this thing called proof of stake. Proof of work works by if you lie to the blockchain, you basically burn electricity for no reason. And proof of stake works that if you lie to the blockchain, you lose your ether.
01:33:46.430 - 01:34:22.090, Speaker B: Ether, the native currency of Ethereum. How proof of stake works is that you stake your ether to the promise that you're not going to lie to the blockchain. And if you do lie to the blockchain, by trying to add in a false transaction, an invalid transaction, you get your ether slashed. So it's kind of like proof of work in that you just lose money, but you lose money a lot faster and a lot more quickly and a lot more money in proof of stake. So generally, the crypto world is like, this is just a better, more efficient way to secure a blockchain. We don't have to consume electricity. We also don't have to have bitcoin be sold because of proof of work, because of all this electricity consumption, because there's no electricity consumption.
01:34:22.090 - 01:34:32.420, Speaker B: You don't have to issue as much ether to pay for that electricity consumption. And these stakers don't have to sell their ether, so it makes ether really bullish. End. How is that?
01:34:33.270 - 01:34:53.226, Speaker A: Pretty good, I think. It's hard to explain. Honestly, what I go back to is just like, buy $100 on Coinbase worth of ETH and then ask me questions as you're curious about it. So it's just like, I feel like, but what if? Not really point.
01:34:53.248 - 01:34:55.340, Speaker B: What if this is the question they're asking you about?
01:34:55.790 - 01:35:19.522, Speaker A: Then I get them to listen to bankless and you explain your thing. I think it's like that sometimes people aren't interested until they have some skin in the game. They actually have financial. I wasn't really interested as interested in crypto until I owned some bitcoin. And then I was like, oh, this is cool. Why are the numbers going up? And why are they going down? What does this all mean? That's why I actually advocate don't dump your entire net worth in here. But if you want to get into crypto, buy some first.
01:35:19.576 - 01:35:19.954, Speaker B: Do it.
01:35:19.992 - 01:35:29.234, Speaker A: Step one, buy some. Do it. Not financial advice. All right, that was the first question. Let's get to the second. When the merge occurs. This is from Eddie Coates.
01:35:29.234 - 01:35:41.670, Speaker A: When the merge occurs, what, if anything, will ETH holders have to do? Will it automatically convert or will holders need to sell out of the old and buy into the V two? Thanks guys. Bankless podcast is lit.
01:35:43.370 - 01:35:49.886, Speaker B: Rockhorns will you have to do anything as an ether holder? No.
01:35:50.028 - 01:35:52.414, Speaker A: I'm so glad. I'm so glad. The answer is no.
01:35:52.452 - 01:36:06.174, Speaker B: The answer is no. You don't have to do anything. You're going to have ether in your wallet and then you're still going to have ether in your wallet. You will actually not notice a thing. The merge is kind of like a software update. When you plug your phone in and then it just updates while you're sleeping, it's going to be like that.
01:36:06.212 - 01:36:38.230, Speaker A: You're not going to notice it, not going to notice. And updates like this have happened many times in Ethereum's history and you probably haven't noticed. If you've been here for one of them, it'll just be like one of those. If everything goes well, it should go well. But there's nothing you should have to do. Last question from SatkC ETH ask the question which L2 scaling solution are you most bullish about and why? Any list of few Starknet Zksync Polygon scroll can't help but notice. David all of these have a similar theme and they are zk EVMs.
01:36:38.230 - 01:36:41.774, Speaker A: Which L2 scaling solution are you most bullish about is the question and.
01:36:41.812 - 01:37:13.862, Speaker B: Why I am most bullish on yes, they're all great. Okay, I'll give you different reasons why you should be bullish on every single one. Starknet apparently after listening to a podcast which I'm about to talk in a sec, this Cairo coding language and this overall the developer support and building out Cairo and accepting updates from developers has been great. So the developer user experience for Starknet has been just a lot of adoption. Developers love it.
01:37:13.916 - 01:37:15.478, Speaker A: They've been treating along in a lot.
01:37:15.484 - 01:37:45.562, Speaker B: Of and like definitely their BD skills are really strong. I think they were the first to market. So Starknet can't not be bullish. ZK sync Alex and team have been around Ethereum from the beginning. They're also doing an EVM compatible strategy with their ZK roll up. They just exude the values of Ethereum. And we've just see adoption of things that exude the values of ethereum.
01:37:45.562 - 01:38:07.638, Speaker B: Uniswap, I would put in this category. And so they just have fundamental ethereum alignment at their tailwinds. They've been around for a while. They're like friends with all the other developers in the space. They're just very well connected. And then, okay, let's go to Polygon. Polygon also has their proof of stake chain, which is not a ZK roll up, but the most bullish thing possible.
01:38:07.638 - 01:38:36.814, Speaker B: I don't know if this is possible, but if it is possible, it's really bullish. Is that their current proof of stake chain just rolls into their ZK roll up, if that's possible. Really, really cool scroll. The most bullish thing about scroll is that it's got EVM equivalents. They are going for the very hard task of EVM equivalents, which is if you can deploy your thing on the ethereum layer one, you can also deploy your thing onto the optimism L2, without changing a goddamn thing. And you can also deploy it to scroll, which is a Zke evm without changing a goddamn thing. Also really bullish.
01:38:36.862 - 01:38:42.210, Speaker A: Super strong engineering team, though. It's a harder problem. Right? It's like all of these have different strengths.
01:38:42.950 - 01:38:48.706, Speaker B: They're all different flavors. So I like many different flavors. They're all bullish.
01:38:48.898 - 01:38:56.790, Speaker A: This question is like asking which of your kids is your favorite. I can't answer that question. They're all special.
01:38:56.940 - 01:39:01.074, Speaker B: I feel like you can't answer that question out loud. No, it's true.
01:39:01.132 - 01:39:12.570, Speaker A: Okay. I have three kids, and I love them all equally. Kids, if you're listening, you guys are fantastic. All of you equally. So are starknet, zkasing, polygon, and Scroll. David takes the week.
01:39:12.640 - 01:39:13.820, Speaker B: Let's get into it.
01:39:14.190 - 01:39:27.422, Speaker A: First take here from you. Yeah. You want to read your own tweet? No, I'll read your tweet. Okay. It's better that way. From David Hoffman. My favorite version of the future is the one where global forex markets are traded on a unicorn theme venue.
01:39:27.422 - 01:39:31.122, Speaker A: This is uniswap. I imagine you think that's real.
01:39:31.256 - 01:39:50.246, Speaker B: I feel like that is actually the most likely version of the future is when global forex markets are held on Uniswap. And just like Hayden and his friend Carl and Vitalik, they just like unicorns. And so they made it a unicorn theme. And then butterfly flaps its wings, and all of a sudden, global forex markets are like, on this uniswap traded or unicorn traded venue.
01:39:50.358 - 01:39:57.690, Speaker A: I still contend that Uniswap will be the largest exchange in the world sometime in the next ten years.
01:39:57.760 - 01:39:58.474, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right.
01:39:58.512 - 01:40:05.898, Speaker A: I think that is undoubtedly true, but we'll see. And that'll be funny when it is. Also, you have a podcast that you want us to tune into.
01:40:05.984 - 01:40:36.642, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't really know where to fit this into the roll up, but here's my hot take. This podcast that I listened to was really, really good. This is into the bytecode from Cena. Great podcast, very technical, but also does a great job of breaking it down for the listener. And so this is Julian from Argent, Argent and smart contract wallet. And they talked about just a number of things like built why smart contract wallets need to be the future why smart contract wallets and zk rollups go really well together. Account abstraction and overall the developer experience of Starquare and ZK sync.
01:40:36.642 - 01:40:46.746, Speaker B: And so this is where I got that take, that the Starquare team is just doing a great job just making their developers feel good. So my hot take is that this was a good podcast and you should listen to it.
01:40:46.848 - 01:40:54.134, Speaker A: I've been waiting for Argent to get its legs under itself again because I feel like we haven't yet seen the promise of smart contract wallets.
01:40:54.182 - 01:40:54.606, Speaker B: Oh God, no.
01:40:54.628 - 01:41:16.210, Speaker A: And I'm hoping that L2s bring that, but we still haven't seen it yet. And there's just such promise, such potential there. It's a little bit like L2s where there's promise and potential, but we just haven't fully seen it realized. Last take here. This is a poll take. Actually, I'm showing the poll results here, but let me give you the A, B and C. This is from Eric Wall.
01:41:16.210 - 01:41:37.386, Speaker A: A, option A, the merge will happen as planned in September. Vote on that if you think it will happen as planned. B, it will happen, but something big will go wrong, like proof of work. Miners will refuse to mine the last block. A major client consensus split, something chaotic. That's option B or C, it won't happen, it'll get postponed. All right.
01:41:37.386 - 01:41:51.146, Speaker A: Before I clicked my answer, which is A, I thought that basically A would be the vast majority. I thought we'd get like 80 or 90%. But it turns out what? What are the results here, David?
01:41:51.338 - 01:42:20.374, Speaker B: It is a that got the most votes. 52% of respondents said, a, it's going to happen as planned in September without any problems. 15% of people said, show me the results. So 15% of people are automatically off the table. 15% of people said, b, it will happen, but something will go wrong. And then 18% of people said it's not going to happen, it's going to get postponed. So if you add B and C together, what do you get? You get something like 33%.
01:42:20.374 - 01:42:45.810, Speaker B: 34% of people think that it's either going to get postponed or go wrong, and 52% think it's going to happen. Fine. Okay. So I've accounted for a 95% success rate in my head, and this is accounting for something like a 66% success rate. And so that discrepancy, if I'm right, means the merge is not priced in. That's my takeaway.
01:42:46.230 - 01:43:05.926, Speaker A: That is an interesting takeaway. It's interesting that 18% think it'll be postponed. Bitcoin, bitcoiners, it's already been pushed as an update. It's happening. It's going to happen. At this point, you don't even really have C as an option. That's just kind of like, I don't know, I guess if the world a.
01:43:05.948 - 01:43:10.086, Speaker B: Little bit too late for C, we kind of have the client software, and.
01:43:10.108 - 01:43:29.278, Speaker A: Yet we have almost 20% of people again in this Twitter poll. But I think it's decently representative of crypto Twitter sentiment, saying that it's not going to happen, it get postponed, and it's like, we have a date and the software has been updated, and we're just waiting for that date to be activated at this point anyway. I do think that there's some alpha there for us. David, what are you bullish on this week, man?
01:43:29.444 - 01:44:10.406, Speaker B: I am bullish on, you know that high value production studio that we were talking, the Bitboy studio? You created the Bitboy studio. Well, as Bitboy exits, I hope to enter and I'm going to turn into the new bitboy. Oh, I'm kidding. We are thinking about, not totally sure on this, but splitting the bankless YouTube into bankless podcasts, which is our long form interview formats, weekly roll ups, Monday podcasts, live streams, the podcasts that you know and love, but then also short form bankless, 20 minutes long, like a little bit more. Just like newbie optimized content. Your boy's got a teleprompter right behind the screen. I got scripts.
01:44:10.406 - 01:44:37.494, Speaker B: And so we're trying to make, trying to expand bankless into new audiences because there's a lot of people out there that when they come to YouTube, they go, oh, bitboy. He's got all the best information he wants. We're trying to steal the bitboy audience, and instead of feeding them candy and tokens, that go to zero. We feed them junk food. We feed them the veggies with some junk food with some merge. With some merge candy. Yeah.
01:44:37.494 - 01:44:41.394, Speaker B: Not high fructose corn syrup, but strawberries and raspberries.
01:44:41.522 - 01:44:42.178, Speaker A: Organic.
01:44:42.274 - 01:44:59.094, Speaker B: Organic. Yeah, organic junk food. Anyways, that is what I'm bullish on. Ryan, there's a bankless productions, bankless studio something, and that's actually aside from, like, this Joe Rogan Lex Friedman type studio I've got behind me, which gets finalized and finished tomorrow, and then we're off to the races.
01:44:59.222 - 01:45:06.000, Speaker A: All right. Bankless becomes bitboy. That's going to be the new bitboy is bankless. Wow.
01:45:06.690 - 01:45:08.110, Speaker B: Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:45:08.180 - 01:45:59.550, Speaker A: David, you were laughing about this before I hit record, but let me tell you why I'm bullish on the Constitution. Here's specifically why. All right, that doesn't sound like it's overly patriotic, because I'm reasonably patriotic, but I'm not a super patriotic person. But I'm really into social protocols. And the constitution happens to be a pretty big one and a pretty important one, and a pretty good one, particularly this thing called the Bill of Rights. And you know where I got excited about it was when we were recording with Jake Trevinsky and basically the takeaways, all of the OFAC sanctions and developer getting arrested and restrictions on privacy that we're feeling right now. What's super interesting is 250 years ago, the framers of the constitution, in creating the Bill of Rights already thought through these things, right? Like, we have these protections problem.
01:45:59.550 - 01:46:30.758, Speaker A: It's a solved problem, and it's actually enshrined in the protocol that governs our country. It's like sometimes we get overly afraid of, like, ofac, for example. It's like, what if we do this thing and they put me in prison? They're the ones doing the thing that's illegal. They're the ones that are doing the thing that is against the constitution that's unlawful. Of course, we have to prove these cases in court over time. But, like, talk about the First Amendment in the Bill of rights, freedom of speech, press, protest, this is code. All right? We've precedent, legal precedent.
01:46:30.758 - 01:46:54.990, Speaker A: That code is protected as a first amendment right, just like speech is the Fourth Amendment. No unreasonable search and seizure. This is privacy. If you live in America, you have the constitutional right to privacy. Number five, due process. That means the government can't come and seize your property without due process, without a court saying it's okay, without proving that you did something wrong. Okay, digital rights.
01:46:54.990 - 01:47:24.106, Speaker A: The government can't come and seize your ETH in the US. That is unconstitutional. All of these things. And I think it's a bit on the legal front, it's a little bit back to getting back to the original protocol of the US, right. This is why, actually, I think that some people are like, the US is too far gone. It's turned into a surveillance state, all of these things. I think that may be true over the past, like 40 to 50 years, we'veered into that.
01:47:24.106 - 01:48:13.306, Speaker A: But if we can have a generation of people and a group of people who take us back to our roots, right, and kind of like the actual social contract this entire country is founded upon, then we can resurface and find our digital rights once again. Sounds like I'm running for a political platform. I'm really not. But crypto is a political movement, isn't it? And I want to make sure that we protect these things. And I am into fighting the fight in the US because I think this is a decent place to fight the fight for digital freedom and for cryptocurrency, because it's like baked into the social contract, baked into the narrative of the US. So why not do it here? And that's what I intend to do more and more. Of course, it's going to be the Jake Trevinsky's of the world and the coin centers of the world doing it.
01:48:13.306 - 01:48:16.940, Speaker A: But we're going to help through our platform and education to continue that fight.
01:48:17.630 - 01:48:20.970, Speaker B: Ryan is bullish on the Bill of Rights.
01:48:21.310 - 01:48:24.702, Speaker A: Yes, I am on to lighter matter.
01:48:24.836 - 01:48:29.440, Speaker B: How do I get exposure to that? We're going to buy the Bill of rights before the.
01:48:30.130 - 01:48:35.038, Speaker A: Didn't we try that? Didn't we try that? No, we tried to buy the constitution. All right, what are we looking at? Meme of the week.
01:48:35.204 - 01:49:02.198, Speaker B: Meme of the week, we have a guy doing, like, the prey squat, and he's looking at one of those, like, what do you call those? A stack of rocks that are all bounced on each other. And we have, like, Vitalik and inflation. And then on top of that is a recession, and on top of that is Putin and a fed pivot bounce. On top of that is a stock pump bounce. On top of that is SBF Arthur Hayes, medium post. The ETH foundation, not selling. Djen spartan bullish tweets, jump capital not selling.
01:49:02.198 - 01:49:08.922, Speaker B: And then the ETH merge pump. And we are praying that the aligned rocks here allow us to have a bull market.
01:49:09.056 - 01:49:24.174, Speaker A: These rocks are built like a Jenga castle, too. It does not look good. A lot of things have to go right in order for the ETH merge pump to happen is what this meme is communicating. There you go. David. What are people in store for for the moment of Zen if they're watching on YouTube, right.
01:49:24.212 - 01:49:37.282, Speaker B: Okay, so this is Gabriel Haynes. He's the guy that's just always rapping and dancing. There's a rap from Gabriel and a song from his wife. And so that is coming up in this moment of Zen right after we get through Ryan's classic disclaimer course.
01:49:37.336 - 01:49:47.286, Speaker A: Guys, crypto is risky. Got to tell you, none of this was financial advice, but we are headed west. This isn't for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
01:49:47.388 - 01:49:49.578, Speaker B: I don't care about you, big boy.
01:49:49.744 - 01:49:51.274, Speaker A: No, not at all.
01:49:51.312 - 01:49:52.970, Speaker B: Not even €1.
01:49:56.830 - 01:50:00.714, Speaker A: You got something else to show? So let's all hear the bit boy.
01:50:00.832 - 01:50:04.782, Speaker B: Show bit boy, my friend. Look like you shilling to the end.
01:50:04.836 - 01:50:09.802, Speaker A: Pumping tokens left and right. Gucci suit a little tight, looking like a turkish delight.
01:50:09.866 - 01:50:11.482, Speaker B: You got too much stress.
01:50:11.546 - 01:50:26.100, Speaker A: You got a six bench press. You could have been a masterclass, but you got your head up your ass. You dish now lots. Like a hot potato. Your face is looking all red, like a red tomato. Your mouth is full. Caviar that shows the world the boy that you are.
