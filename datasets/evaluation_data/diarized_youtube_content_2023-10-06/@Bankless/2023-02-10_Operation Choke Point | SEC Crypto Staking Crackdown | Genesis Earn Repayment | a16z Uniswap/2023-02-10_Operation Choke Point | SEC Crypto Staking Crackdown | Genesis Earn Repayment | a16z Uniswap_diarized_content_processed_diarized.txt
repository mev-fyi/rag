00:00:00.650 - 00:00:09.840, Speaker A: In bad news, though, operation Chokepoint promises to take crypto Bankless, but in the bearish way, perhaps crypto's biggest regulatory threat ever.
00:00:12.370 - 00:00:16.542, Speaker B: Bankless Nation. It is the second Friday of February. David, what time is it?
00:00:16.596 - 00:00:34.134, Speaker A: Ryan it's the Friday Bankless weekly roll up, where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, especially this week, an insane amount of shipping, some extra large FUD, and we're going to cover it all on this roll up here and now with, of course, coffee, as always.
00:00:34.172 - 00:00:45.242, Speaker B: Yep, in my ember mug, too, so it's nice and piping hot. David, you are back and your voice still hasn't fully recovered, although it's better than it was. So, like, how many days of recovery and what happened to you?
00:00:45.296 - 00:01:24.598, Speaker A: Yeah, my voice is slowly coming back after going to the Starquare Sessions in Tel Aviv, Israel, and doing nine interviews, which the Bankless Nation will notice that the first four of is on their podcast feed. So you can go ahead and listen to those. If you just can't make it out to conferences, don't worry, because Bankless has your back. I bring out an entire podcast studio with me, including three microphones, and I interview everyone who's founder, builder, developer of that particular ecosystem. This conference in choice was the StarkNet World, and sometimes I put my voice on the line, too, to get that done. And that's why you're going to be hearing a little bit raspy of a voice on this weekly roll up this week.
00:01:24.684 - 00:01:37.514, Speaker B: Big sacrifices to make this happen. Many Gothams died for this information. A little Star Wars reference for you, David. I always thought you'd just go to the conferences for me, man. But I guess it is about the listeners, too. Seriously. I appreciate that.
00:01:37.514 - 00:02:00.834, Speaker B: That's one of the great things about people don't know the partnership between David and myself. It's just like a Yang Yang type thing where he does all sorts of stuff that like, ah, I don't want to go to a conference. David's like, I absolutely want to go to all the conferences, and so it's a really good fit. And David's like, I don't want to do accounting and bookkeeping and that sort of thing. And I'm like, oh, that's fine for me. I enjoy it in a weird way.
00:02:01.032 - 00:02:01.726, Speaker A: Weird.
00:02:01.838 - 00:02:05.058, Speaker B: That's what makes partnership work anyway.
00:02:05.144 - 00:02:25.082, Speaker A: Just like the disposition of who I am at a conference is like, I just want to talk with as many people as possible, but I also hate small talk and receiving pitches. And so in order to defend myself from getting pitched by everyone all the time, I schedule out interviews, longer form interviews, and I'm like, oh, I'm sorry, I'm interviewing people, but not the small talk.
00:02:25.136 - 00:02:33.850, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm like that too. You know what's funny is I know you've characterized yourself as an introvert, but I think somebody met you at a conference. I don't think they'd see an introvert.
00:02:33.930 - 00:02:44.494, Speaker A: Yeah, everyone is surprised. Like, I say, oh, yeah, I'm kind of introverted. And everyone's like, what? No, you're not. And actually, I have had to actually rethink that because there are true introverts.
00:02:44.542 - 00:02:46.594, Speaker B: That just really yeah, there are people.
00:02:46.632 - 00:02:58.898, Speaker A: Who are more introverted than me. But also, coming into crypto, I have discovered that it has created a more extroverted outgoing person in me. That is something I've noticed.
00:02:58.994 - 00:03:04.710, Speaker B: Look, come for the money, but stay for the personality improvement or the psychological changes.
00:03:04.780 - 00:03:21.578, Speaker A: This also happens to be the subject of my talk at Shelling Point in Denver. If you want to talk about the way that permissionless self sovereign protocols change the psychological disposition of the societies that organize around them, if that talk interests you, definitely go to Shelling Point.
00:03:21.664 - 00:03:26.080, Speaker B: David's been waiting years to apply his psych degree to crypto, and then the moment has come.
00:03:26.450 - 00:03:27.598, Speaker A: Six years in the making.
00:03:27.684 - 00:03:44.510, Speaker B: This is great. Well, it's super unlike Bankless to shill its own content on the show, but you can tell we got a lot of hot content coming at you. David and I've been looking at our podcast schedule, too. I mean, we're recording three podcasts over the next, like, three days, three working days with some real big names.
00:03:44.670 - 00:03:51.602, Speaker A: Oh, my God. I think it's some of the hottest content lined up over the next, like, ten days that I think Eric Howell.
00:03:51.746 - 00:03:58.274, Speaker B: This is in crypto ethics. We're talking about that Eliser AI gigabrain.
00:03:58.322 - 00:04:02.326, Speaker A: We're talking about AI. And this isn't just Bankless following the AI trend.
00:04:02.518 - 00:04:12.742, Speaker B: Yeah, this is not about AI, tokens. This is real AI. This guy's like a big brain. It's incredible, these choosing to come on and then Annie Jacobson.
00:04:12.806 - 00:04:13.322, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:04:13.376 - 00:04:13.802, Speaker B: That's coming.
00:04:13.856 - 00:04:17.294, Speaker A: So excited for the Annie Jacobson. Can I take a moment to shill it really quick?
00:04:17.332 - 00:04:24.800, Speaker B: Well, okay, but here's my take on it. She's going to tell us if we have to hide from our government, if the government is coming after people in crypto, right?
00:04:25.570 - 00:05:07.066, Speaker A: I wouldn't say that. That's the most accurate way of the theme of the content, the Annie Jacobson content. Annie Jacobson is an author who does not really know much or care about crypto and doesn't need to in order to talk about what we're going to talk about. She's written books like The Pentagon's Brain, which is an exploration into how the Pentagon thinks and how it's organized. And this subject matter is there are many intelligence agencies in the United States that the CIA, the Pentagon, et cetera. And there also throughout history has been a number of countercultural dissident movements, and there have been ways that these intelligence agencies have engaged with these countercultural dissident movements.
00:05:07.098 - 00:05:07.850, Speaker B: Infiltrated.
00:05:07.930 - 00:05:33.270, Speaker A: Infiltrated, yes, perhaps is the correct word. And so, while annie doesn't have any specific knowledge about how the CIA might have been chosen to engage with crypto, the idea is that we can talk about all of the different strategies that they have infiltrated other movements, and it's up to the listener to connect the dots and extrapolate this into the CIA might have infiltrated the crypto world.
00:05:33.340 - 00:05:42.790, Speaker B: The question is, how well do you really know your crypto podcast co host? Like, how well do you really know that person? That's the question I intend to ask Annie.
00:05:42.870 - 00:05:46.890, Speaker A: Okay, I'll jump to the conclusion of that episode.
00:05:47.390 - 00:05:48.938, Speaker B: We don't know the conclusion yet.
00:05:49.024 - 00:06:25.490, Speaker A: Well, we haven't recorded the punchline, I'm pretty sure. Okay, so Annie Jacobson spoke at the A 16 Z Founder Summit, which is Retreat, which is how she came onto my radar. And the conclusion is, like, yo, if you are in the social networks of crypto, the VC networks, the media networks, the likelihood that someone is a plant is like that's. Looking back throughout history as how this has happened throughout other dissident movements is likely. And so I look at myself and I'm like, oh, I moved to New York to be a part of the crypto socialite crew. I have one of the most extensive media networks in all of crypto.
00:06:25.570 - 00:06:27.894, Speaker B: Chances are, you know, the CIA really.
00:06:27.932 - 00:06:29.270, Speaker A: Wants to be my friend.
00:06:29.420 - 00:06:33.690, Speaker B: Well, maybe they probably already are, then. Yeah, if they've wanted, then there's someone.
00:06:33.760 - 00:06:41.580, Speaker A: Who'S my friend, who I probably have already invited over to my apartment, who's probably listening to this and is like, oh, fuck, they're onto me.
00:06:42.350 - 00:06:52.922, Speaker B: Thanks, David. Paranoia increases ten X. You guys appreciate that. That was like a whole eight minutes of Shilling Bankless content. I'm sorry. We got to get to the roll up content today. All right is biden.
00:06:52.922 - 00:06:59.982, Speaker B: Operation choke point. This Operation Choke Point we're going to talk about is it coming to kill crypto? We'll talk about that. What else we got? David?
00:07:00.046 - 00:07:23.466, Speaker A: DCG and Gemini hug it out. Maybe we'll get some of our money back. Perhaps a successful resolution. And so if you have money and Gemini earn, stay tuned to find out how much money that you may get in return. And also, Ryan, you've noticed this? I've noticed this. It is absolutely ship season. So many teams have shipped very cool things, very big updates in the last recent week.
00:07:23.466 - 00:07:41.360, Speaker A: So we're going to cover it all. Fundamentals are up big. Also, a 16 Z is a DFI governance cartel. The manhunt for Doequan NFTs on Bitcoin continue their exponential growth ARC's audacious Bitcoin price targets. This roll up is absolutely jam packed. I'm really excited for this one, so stay tuned for this all.
00:07:41.730 - 00:08:10.086, Speaker B: You know what else I'm really excited about is more tools to help us learn about crypto and Go Bankless. Here's one of the best tools I have seen this year. It's called MetaMask learn. You're seeing on the screen says, welcome to MetaMask learn. This is like courseware to help you learn crypto. You can click here, you could say Start Course, and you can get on the journey. Lesson one what is web? Three maybe you're skipping all the early Bankless podcasts and you want a quick recap, this is a great way to do it.
00:08:10.086 - 00:08:14.234, Speaker B: David, what else is in this courseware in this MetaMask Learn app?
00:08:14.352 - 00:08:48.626, Speaker A: Well, you'll also be given an interactive and engaging way to learn how to open up a MetaMask wallet. So if you're family or non crypto friends or curious, this is a place for you to send them. MetaMask obviously teaches you how to set up MetaMask and what's going on when you write down these 24 words, but also just has some very important D five paradigms, like digital identity, what self custody is and why it's amazing. NFTs and creators decentralized finance. So if you want to onboard yourself or not have to onboard your friends, you can send them to learn MetaMask. IO.
00:08:48.738 - 00:08:53.030, Speaker B: Really cool. This is really the next step to Go Bankless. Step one is you open up your crypto.
00:08:53.690 - 00:08:54.760, Speaker A: Your what?
00:08:56.010 - 00:09:12.058, Speaker B: Step one is you open up your Kraken account and deposit some funds. You transfer that to Fiat, and then you open up a MetaMask wallet. That's step two. All right, David, let's get to markets. I think we got some happy news this week. Yet again, it's only happy news. What is Bitcoin doing on the week?
00:09:12.144 - 00:09:16.922, Speaker A: It's not happy, Ryan. I don't know what you're talking about. We're down 5.4%. Bitcoin.
00:09:16.986 - 00:09:17.822, Speaker B: Where have I been?
00:09:17.876 - 00:09:27.570, Speaker A: Yeah, where have you been? Nice. Wait, was yesterday happy? No, it's not been, like, super sad, but it's been a down week. We started the week at $23,800.
00:09:27.640 - 00:09:28.286, Speaker B: So embarrassing.
00:09:28.318 - 00:09:28.802, Speaker A: Guys, down.
00:09:28.856 - 00:09:36.706, Speaker B: David puts these numbers in before the roll up, and clearly I don't even read them. And I am so Zen this year, I'm not even checking prices.
00:09:36.818 - 00:09:47.206, Speaker A: Yeah, only being down 5.4% is apparently not down enough to be on Ryan's radar. Bitcoin currently coming in at $22,500.
00:09:47.388 - 00:09:52.774, Speaker B: Oh, sad. Sorry for that. Wrecked you guys. How about ETH? Is that down too? David?
00:09:52.822 - 00:10:02.800, Speaker A: Don't tell me. Less down, but still down. Yeah. Starting the week at 1675. 1675 down 3.2% to 1620.
00:10:03.810 - 00:10:04.174, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:04.212 - 00:10:42.762, Speaker A: So down on the week not overly bad, especially with, like so we're going to talk about this banking FUD, this Operation choke Point, and we're only down this much. I'm kind of really optimistic about this. And so very rarely in the Bankless weekly roll up will we give a forward looking market take. But I saw this here, and this is from crypto trader Hornhairs. Three weeks of compression and higher lows on the ETH price chart. And so you can just see this triangle wedge forming. And he is claiming that the resistance, the one $700 resistance, which we talked about last week, is perhaps fading away.
00:10:42.762 - 00:11:03.370, Speaker A: And when that resistance finally gets chewed through, we go up and to the right. Now, this is the ether price we're looking at, but this is probably also true for overall market indicators. I think there are more bullish indicators in the market than there are bearish indicators in the market. And that is despite all of this banking FUD that we'll talk about so shortly.
00:11:03.450 - 00:11:05.322, Speaker B: Did we just do ta on bankless?
00:11:05.386 - 00:11:12.194, Speaker A: We just did Ta. We have done this, like, twice before in all of Bankless weekly roll of history, and now we have done this a third time.
00:11:12.232 - 00:11:18.414, Speaker B: Let me click away. I mean, you said we don't do price predictions, but we actually do they're just, like, really long term.
00:11:18.462 - 00:11:21.570, Speaker A: Yeah, right. They're like the ten plus year price predictions.
00:11:21.650 - 00:11:27.606, Speaker B: ETH is going to ten K. ETH absolutely going to ten K. How about ETH bitcoin ratio? What's that looking like?
00:11:27.708 - 00:11:33.498, Speaker A: Yeah, up a little bit on the week. We are up 2.3% on the week. We're at zero point 72.
00:11:33.664 - 00:11:40.090, Speaker B: David look at these charts from Kraken that we're showing. It's really futures here. Yeah.
00:11:40.160 - 00:12:06.098, Speaker A: So the URL for this pro Kraken.com app trade ETHC, you can actually just delete BTC and type in USD if you want. You can type in trading pairs in the mean you have it also pulled up in the fantastic modular UI UX that Kraken has. You can look at multiple charts at once. They're tabs. They're tabs, but you can also drag and drop them and make them modular so you can pull them out if you want to.
00:12:06.104 - 00:12:07.826, Speaker B: Look, we got tabs in tabs right.
00:12:07.848 - 00:12:21.078, Speaker A: Now, tabs inside of tabs. But you can also intuitively change the like, I don't know if other people do this when they navigate crypto, but just like, if you want to type in any ticker, you can do it straight through the URL to get what you want. I think it's great.
00:12:21.164 - 00:12:24.474, Speaker B: Can I do the sole BTC ratio? What's that looking like?
00:12:24.592 - 00:12:28.822, Speaker A: See, let's see if they got it. Sole BTC. Boom. There it is. Straight from the URL.
00:12:28.886 - 00:12:31.370, Speaker B: That's pretty amazing. Big screen. Love this stuff.
00:12:31.440 - 00:12:35.082, Speaker A: Yeah. Good job. Good job, Catherine. Look at that. Look at that. You're a trader now, Ryan.
00:12:35.146 - 00:12:36.046, Speaker B: Look at this.
00:12:36.228 - 00:12:40.142, Speaker A: Kraken is turning a trader out on Ryan. Wow. Never thought it possible.
00:12:40.196 - 00:12:49.806, Speaker B: Maybe behind me. Live updates all the time so I can keep track of freaking prices. Apparently, I don't do that. Clearly. Global crypto market cap. Are we above a trillion, David?
00:12:49.918 - 00:12:52.914, Speaker A: $1.1 trillion. Slightly down on the week.
00:12:52.952 - 00:13:05.270, Speaker B: That's all I need to know. Okay, let's talk about some market stuff going on. One is ultrasound. Money just keeps getting more and more ultrasound. ETH is at all time lows in terms of deflation.
00:13:05.770 - 00:13:07.314, Speaker A: Post merge all time lows?
00:13:07.362 - 00:13:13.290, Speaker B: Yes. Post merge, all time lows. Ever since the burn started? No, ever since the merge happened.
00:13:13.360 - 00:13:22.380, Speaker A: Yeah. I kind of consider all ether supply metrics before the merge. Kind of irrelevant now because we are so close.
00:13:23.170 - 00:13:26.874, Speaker B: Is that a good take, David? Maybe there's maybe there's only two dates in crypto.
00:13:26.922 - 00:13:35.410, Speaker A: There's BM and there's a merge, at least in ethereum. If you want to be an ETH maxi about it, you can say for all of crypto, but at least in ethereum.
00:13:36.070 - 00:13:36.786, Speaker B: Kind of like it.
00:13:36.808 - 00:13:47.358, Speaker A: Yeah. So all ethereum monetary policy kind of resets at the merge and now we are at all time lows p. M. Post merge.
00:13:47.454 - 00:13:50.818, Speaker B: Okay, so how much have we burnt? 14,000 ETH.
00:13:50.914 - 00:13:56.418, Speaker A: 14,000 ETH since the merge. 20,000 each since the top of the supply.
00:13:56.514 - 00:13:56.834, Speaker B: Jeez.
00:13:56.882 - 00:14:08.022, Speaker A: So the top of the supply. When the ETH supply peak happened, and not too long after the merge, it was at a little over 6000 ether plus positive 6000 ether. We are now at negative 4400 ETH.
00:14:08.086 - 00:14:24.362, Speaker B: When the burn starts, it just keeps going. David, I think that's what your take is here, actually. Let me read it. I'll try in your voice. The 24 hours record for ETH burn was set on November eigth, the day FTX went insolvent. That's a fun fact. 3600 ETH was burnt.
00:14:24.362 - 00:14:44.066, Speaker B: Fire emoji today we burnt 1800 ETH. 3600 ETH was burnt during crypto's. Worst crisis ever. And now we're burning 1800 ETH on a Wednesday. That is on a Wednesday, folks. Just a typical Wednesday for ETH. And we're burning 1800 ETH.
00:14:44.066 - 00:14:45.670, Speaker B: Ethereum. Ether.
00:14:46.250 - 00:14:52.042, Speaker A: We're burning over 30 day period. We're burning like an average of like twelve to 1300 ether per day.
00:14:52.096 - 00:14:55.562, Speaker B: David, that must mean block space is in high demand. What are we looking at here?
00:14:55.616 - 00:15:25.586, Speaker A: In demand? That is an equivalent statement. Ether burn means block space demand. And this is Hildabi, who's just got great gas analytics. He's pointing to a couple of events here. The ethereum merge, the FTX bank run, and the floor of gas prices is up. Only we haven't seen below 15 guay gas prices in months now. And this is to me, Ryan, gas prices could go down, they could go back down to where it was, they could level out.
00:15:25.586 - 00:15:31.880, Speaker A: But a crescendo wing floor of gas prices is what a bull market would start with.
00:15:32.250 - 00:15:45.130, Speaker B: Isn't this okay? Do you remember like 18 months ago when this was like the most bearish indicator ever? Gas price on ETH was going up, therefore bearish for ethereum. Do you remember this?
00:15:45.200 - 00:15:48.374, Speaker A: Yeah. You mean 2021 with the triggering of all layer one season?
00:15:48.422 - 00:16:07.040, Speaker B: Yeah. This was like, I don't know, was it December of last of 2021 or that was kind of the peak of this, I think, was a Suzu tweet where he criticized ethereum for sitting around watching circle jerking circle. Is that what we're doing?
00:16:07.490 - 00:16:09.230, Speaker A: We are currently doing this, yes.
00:16:09.300 - 00:16:21.014, Speaker B: Okay, so are you happy about this? Are you sad about I? High gas fees are bad for ETH, aren't they? Or are they good? I'm confused. Tell me. Tell me what to think.
00:16:21.132 - 00:17:21.990, Speaker A: I will take Su Zu's point when he tweeted that and say that if all the ethereum proponents who were talking about how awesome the burn was were perhaps not being sensitive to how much ethereum gas costs were costing people that weren't able to buy ether at a cheaper price, of which it was cheaper, not like four or five, six months prior. So I'll take that point because at that time, layer twos of round ethereum were not nearly as mature or developed or as cheap as they are today. Today, layer twos are in production with blossoming DFI and NFT ecosystems. There's not much you can do on an ethereum layer one that you can't also do on ethereum layer two. So now when we circle jerk about the ETH burn, there is also a way for all users to experience sub ten cent gas fees and do all of the crypto ethereum things that they would like to do on any of the layer twos that they choose. So now I declare that it is once again appropriate for the ETH maxis to circle jerk about the burn.
00:17:22.150 - 00:17:48.190, Speaker B: Okay, thank you for telling me that, David. Thanks for the clarification. You have permission, because I needed that permission. Basically saying is, look, the cost of living in Manhattan is going up once again, but why don't you live in the suburbs? There's tons of cheap housing and affordable things to do in crypto on the layer two ecosystem, david, this is the daily median gas price. Is this another view of the same thing from Hildabi?
00:17:48.270 - 00:17:55.602, Speaker A: That's exactly right. Just gas. Gas has definitely hit a floor, a bottom in the September 2022 and has been up only since then.
00:17:55.736 - 00:18:02.050, Speaker B: Do you know what? Ethereum block space ain't the only block space that's selling and going up. Let's talk about bitcoin.
00:18:02.130 - 00:18:41.326, Speaker A: Bitcoin block space, the Ordinal effect in demand. We love this. So this is bitcoin block space going all the way back to January of 2022 into February of 2023, where we are now. And you can see bitcoin block space breaking all time highs in terms of actually how much size they are. And so the ordinals effect have increased the total size of bitcoin, the average mean of bitcoin block space, to highs that it has not yet seen before. Which means, of course, Ryan, that more people are paying for bitcoin blocksbase. And as we have been saying, blocks based demand is bullish.
00:18:41.326 - 00:18:49.400, Speaker A: And so congrats bitcoin. This is one of the strongest properties I've seen out of bitcoin in a very long time. This is great.
00:18:49.850 - 00:19:08.060, Speaker B: What this is. This is a marker of sustainability of the bitcoin network. Of course, this is how it pays for defense in the future. And security in the future is through blocks based fees. So those blocks have to be worth something. Okay, we talked about what's happening, but why is it happening?
00:19:08.430 - 00:19:33.266, Speaker A: So Ordinals, which we did a show with Eric Wall and Casey Rotemore, who is the creator of Ordinals. Eric Wall, I tap him in as my bitcoin technical co host. He's my bitcoin, my bitcoin. I tap him in when I need help explaining bitcoin stuff. So him and I talked to Casey, who is the guy who created Ordinals, and this is what we're looking at this chart, which is absolutely exponential as soon as Ordinals has come into the.
00:19:33.288 - 00:19:37.682, Speaker B: Mainstream, which is the NFT. It's the thing that allows NFTs on bitcoin.
00:19:37.746 - 00:20:13.326, Speaker A: Exactly, yeah. And it's actually pretty simple how it works. Basically, the bitcoin UTX model, unspent transaction output is basically ethereum has an account model, as in you have your Ethereum address and you put all of your tokens in there. Bitcoin has a UTXO model, which is that every single bitcoin is actually like a unique denomination, like 13.7. Bitcoins is like a bill that's like $27.42, like a unique bill that's for bitcoin. What Ordinals does is they make a bill out of one satoshi, which is the smallest denomination, and then just append data to that.
00:20:13.326 - 00:20:21.458, Speaker A: And that's what an NFT is on bitcoin. And the minting of bitcoin NFTs, ordinals on bitcoin is just going exponential. It has not slowed down.
00:20:21.624 - 00:20:24.580, Speaker B: Did you ask them, why didn't somebody think of this years ago?
00:20:26.070 - 00:20:31.350, Speaker A: They needed both SegWit and taproot. So it was specifically a taproot thing. That's right.
00:20:31.500 - 00:20:32.770, Speaker B: Which is relatively recent.
00:20:32.850 - 00:21:01.726, Speaker A: But also at the same time, bitcoiner culture isn't really one to enjoy a lot of non BTC use cases of bitcoin. And so this is why this is controversy. Luke Dash Jr is a bitcoin core. Dev is like people have lied and tricked the code in order to make this happen, which I think is one of the worst takes I've ever heard. You can't trick code. That's not how it works. But anyways, ordinals brand new demand for bitcoin block space really cool.
00:21:01.748 - 00:21:13.090, Speaker B: All right, so bullish bitcoin. But how bullish are you, David? If you want to be Kathy Wood bullish, that is. Kathy Wood of Arc Invest. Her bullcase right now is $1.48 million.
00:21:13.240 - 00:21:16.914, Speaker A: Per bitcoin in 2030.
00:21:17.112 - 00:21:35.530, Speaker B: By 2030, I should say, yeah. It's not happening this year, according to Kathy the bear case. Want to hear that most bearish possibility, Kathy Wood thinks, could happen for bitcoin? Two hundred and fifty eight K per bitcoin, actually. I could see the bear case playing out. What do you think about these numbers, though, David?
00:21:36.030 - 00:22:02.622, Speaker A: I gave my takes. I think that bull case is extremely bullish. While bitcoin perhaps might be able to tick that amount, I do not think it will ever be able to sustain a $1 million price. And the reasoning behind that is this math that is on the screen here. Bitcoin at $1.5 million in 2030 means that it's issuing $2.33 million every ten minutes in block rewards.
00:22:02.622 - 00:22:35.262, Speaker A: New bitcoin being minted every ten minutes is going to be worth $2.33 million. When bitcoin hit its 2021 peak, it was issuing $400,000 per block. And so Kathy Wood's bullish bitcoin prediction would imply that bitcoin would be issuing $2.33 million every ten minutes. And that is why bitcoin can't sustain a $1 million price tag, because no bull market could ever sustain $2 million of flows out of bitcoin miners because they have to sell bitcoin miners have to sell. So that $2.33
00:22:35.262 - 00:23:06.514, Speaker A: million of issuance per block every ten minutes comes out to $330,000,000 a day of issuance for miners, which not all of it is sold immediately, but ultimately generally becomes sold, like 90, 95% over time, ultimately becomes sold. How will any asset be able to sustain itself under $300 million a day of net sell pressure? I don't think Bitcoin can ever sustain a $1 million price tag because of this math.
00:23:06.642 - 00:23:09.734, Speaker B: Well, eventually that block subsidy will drop to zero, though.
00:23:09.852 - 00:23:12.460, Speaker A: Yeah, but then so does the security, and that's a different issue.
00:23:12.830 - 00:23:55.398, Speaker B: Yeah, I think bankless listeners, hopefully you're seeing the way that bankless, David and I at least think about these assets. It's very much about how much yeah, it's about flows and it's about how much of block space the product that blockchains create are you selling versus what if there's a cost of the sale through issuance and through other kind of transaction fees. So that is bitcoin. What about this other leg up, which we've seen, which is these AI tokens? Here's a headline from CoinDesk. The AI token search traffic spikes as crypto traders seek exposure. What in the world are AI tokens, David? And should I buy some?
00:23:55.484 - 00:24:26.786, Speaker A: There are a certain class of tokens that are at various levels of relevancy to the world of AI. Most of them are not very related to AI. People are looking for it. How do I get exposure to AI? And so they're going and buying AI crypto tokens. The level of how much AI is actually integrated into these assets and actually meaningfully giving AI exposure to these assets is extremely suspect. Which brings me to my take, which.
00:24:26.808 - 00:24:31.566, Speaker B: Are some of these tokens, though, like SingularityNET Syscoin fetch AI.
00:24:31.678 - 00:24:38.070, Speaker A: Dny brain Chain is a 2017 ICO Darling token, which I have not heard since then.
00:24:38.140 - 00:24:57.542, Speaker B: I mean, we're looking at seven days of about 160% for singularity net. You're saying there's a narrative which is chat GTP is really cool and so is crypto, and now these AI tokens are kind of taking that narrative. Are you saying it's basically a narrative trade?
00:24:57.606 - 00:25:09.022, Speaker A: It's basically a meme trade because this is a tweet that I put out. And I didn't really expect this tweet to get over 1000 likes. I just put this out there, but I guess it ticked the right nerve with certain people.
00:25:09.076 - 00:25:09.694, Speaker B: Give you one, too.
00:25:09.732 - 00:25:26.606, Speaker A: Thank you. Let's make something clear, is what I say. There is no material integration between AI and crypto. You cannot put AI into a blockchain. You cannot make a token that has AI in it. That doesn't make any sense. So I make the claim that AI tokens are meme tokens.
00:25:26.606 - 00:25:43.350, Speaker A: It is just a narrative trade. It's just a meme trade. Not too dissimilar from Deutsche cone. There are ways, like Numerai is a token that legitimately does use real AI to achieve its end goals. But it's the end goal that you should want exposure to, not the fact that it just uses AI.
00:25:43.690 - 00:25:48.166, Speaker B: Does that make sense? It totally makes sense. Are you saying this is a dumb market? This is a meme trade?
00:25:48.198 - 00:25:50.278, Speaker A: There is no such thing as it's a meme trade.
00:25:50.454 - 00:25:52.502, Speaker B: Chat GPT on the blockchain.
00:25:52.566 - 00:25:54.614, Speaker A: Yeah, there's no Chat GBT on the blockchain.
00:25:54.742 - 00:25:55.130, Speaker B: Okay.
00:25:55.200 - 00:26:00.414, Speaker A: Chat not saying GBT train though or chain would at a certain value.
00:26:00.452 - 00:26:23.234, Speaker B: We're going to see that. I'm sure we're going to see that this cycle. You know what is kind of cool, though, is a bright spot in the market too, is NFT phi. It's processing record number of loans. So are people lending and borrowing against their NFTs now, I know that was an idea that we started talking about about two years ago and now we're actually seeing it in the numbers. 18,000 ETH Borrowed in January. That's a lot of ETH, David.
00:26:23.282 - 00:26:50.138, Speaker A: That's a lot of ETH. $444,000,000 in monthly volume in January from NFT lending. So this is using your NFTs as collateral to borrow. Ben Dow had volumes of $36 million. 4400 loans were made in January, which is almost double the previous peak. So NFT lending coming into the world, the numbers are up bigly.
00:26:50.234 - 00:27:03.730, Speaker B: I got to say, David, despite the detractors, NFTs are still pretty strong during this bear market. And we're seeing an actual NFT phi. The usage of NFTs, it hasn't collapsed the way some people thought it would. NFTs are doing pretty well.
00:27:03.800 - 00:27:38.234, Speaker A: Well, there's a huge amount of capital, quote unquote, that's like locked up. Okay? So there's a big difference between something like the United States and the legal system that we have in the United States and like third world countries and the legal system. There a lot of people in third world countries or countries with inadequate legal systems can't use their house as collateral. They can't get a mortgage on their house just because they don't have assurances the legal system isn't set up. America does have that. And so people can use the value of their house to access capital. And this has been a huge boon of wealth for America.
00:27:38.234 - 00:28:11.430, Speaker A: That's why one of the reasons why America is so great is because our legal system allows us to tap into capital. This is the same effect I'm applying this to NFTs. Previous to now, the capital that's locked up in value of your NFT, your 100 Ether Crypto Punk or your 100 Ether Board Ape, you can't access that capital without selling it. With NFT phi, you can access that capital without selling it. And so there is a wealth effect that is generated for all of the NFT holders because they are able to use smart contracts to tap into the capital of their assets.
00:28:11.590 - 00:28:23.366, Speaker B: And outside importantly, this is outside the bounds of a nation state. So it doesn't matter where, you know, another way to describe what you talked about is kind of legal assurances settlement.
00:28:23.398 - 00:28:24.154, Speaker A: Assurances settlement.
00:28:24.202 - 00:28:32.510, Speaker B: Assurances effectively what legal assurances are. And Ethereum gives us stronger settlement assurances too. David, we got a lot more to cover. What's coming up next.
00:28:32.580 - 00:28:37.202, Speaker A: Coming up next, did you have money in Gemini Earn? Because you might be getting your money back.
00:28:37.256 - 00:28:37.954, Speaker B: Stay tuned.
00:28:38.072 - 00:28:56.290, Speaker A: Yeah, Ryan, some good news. So, ryan, stay tuned. I will tell you exactly how much you might be getting back. In. Bad news though, operation Chokepoint promises to take crypto bankless but in the bearish way. Perhaps crypto's biggest regulatory threat ever. And the manhunt is on for Doe Kwan.
00:28:56.290 - 00:29:16.202, Speaker A: Meanwhile, Kyle Davies is ignoring the subpoena for the Three Arrows Capital lawsuit. Bad boys, bad Boys on the scene.

00:31:11.864 - 00:31:22.374, Speaker B: David, is the Biden administration coming after crypto? What is Operation Chokepoint and what is happening? What's been the stir this week as we've learned more about what the administration's doing?
00:31:22.492 - 00:31:57.886, Speaker A: Yeah, operation Chokepoint is something in history not to do with crypto that really just talks about how government institutions, government administrations, can use the banking sector to de bank industries that they find unappetizing. So Nick Carter is tweeting out, I don't want to raise the alarm, I don't want to sound alarmed, but since the turn of the year, a new Operation Choke Point type operation has been targeting the crypto space in the US. It is a well coordinated effort to marginalize the industry and cut off its connectivity to the banking system. And it's working.
00:31:58.068 - 00:32:15.302, Speaker B: The original Operation Choke Point was like an Obama era thing, 2012 and 2013. And it was like targeted towards all the kind of gambling, all the poker websites got kind of shut down almost.
00:32:15.356 - 00:32:20.790, Speaker A: Overnight, which is why they started to use Bitcoin. That was a big impetus of Bitcoin adoption.
00:32:20.870 - 00:32:45.662, Speaker B: And then it was expanded later into other nefarious industries, the marijuana industry and others like it. So now what Nick Carter is saying is basically there's going to be an Operation Choke .20 indeed, it's already begun and this time in the target sites is the crypto industry. And he's brought some evidence to the table too. So what are some facts that he mentions that are relevant to this case?
00:32:45.796 - 00:33:29.146, Speaker A: Yeah, so he wrote this fantastic blog post and just I'll read some of the excerpts here to give the summary. He begins, what began as a trickle is now a flood. And by the way, all of these events have happened in the last two months or so. The US. Government is using the banking sector to organize a sophisticated, widespread crackdown against the crypto industry and the administration's efforts are no secret. They've expressed plainly in memos, regulatory guidance and blog posts. However, the breadth of this plan, spanning virtually every financial regulator as well as its highly coordinated nature, has even most of these steely eyed crypto veterans, nervous that the crypto businesses might end up completely unbanked stablecoins, may be stranded and unable to manage flows in and out of crypto and exchanges might be shut off from the banking system entirely.
00:33:29.146 - 00:34:19.130, Speaker A: The Biden administration is now executing what appears to be a coordinated plan that spans multiple agencies to discourage banks from dealing with crypto firms. It applies both to traditional banks who would serve crypto clients and crypto first firms aiming to get bank charters. This effort includes the administration itself, influential members of Congress, the Fed, the FDIC, the OOC, and the DOJ. So there's intergovernmental agency coordination here. So then Nick goes on to list off some of the events that have shown this effort. On December 7, Signature, which is an active bank serving crypto clients, announces its intent to have deposits ascribed to crypto clients, which basically means they'll give customers their money back and shut down their accounts, drawing its crypto deposits down from 23 billion at the peak to just under 10 billion as it's exited stablecoin businesses.
00:34:19.210 - 00:34:24.458, Speaker B: I've had this happen to me by the way. They just send you a Dear John letter and say, cutting you a check. See you later.
00:34:24.564 - 00:34:47.894, Speaker A: Yes. No due process. On January 3, the Fed, the FDIC and the OCC releases a joint statement on the risks to banks engaging with crypto. Not explicitly banning banks ability to hold crypto or deal with crypto clients, but strongly discouraging them from doing so on a safety and soundness basis. January 9 silvergate Stock, which is probably crypto's biggest bank, one of the only.
00:34:47.932 - 00:34:50.978, Speaker B: Banks in the only bank, the exchanges and such.
00:34:51.084 - 00:35:33.842, Speaker A: Yeah. The stock falls to a low of $11.55 on bank run and insolvency fears after having traded as high as $160 in March of 2022. January 27 the Federal Reserve denies crypto bank Custodia's two year application to become a member of the Federal Reserve System, citing safety and soundness risks. Safety and soundness is a reoccurring theme here. 27 January again, the National Economic Council releases a policy statement not explicitly banning banks from serving crypto clients, but strongly discouraging banks from transacting with crypto assets directly or maintaining exposure to crypto depositors. February 2 department of Justice Fraud Unit announces investigation into Silvergate over their relationship with FTX and Alameda.
00:35:33.842 - 00:36:21.254, Speaker A: February 6 binance suspends USD bank transfers for all retail clients. January 27. The Fed issues a policy statement which discourages banks from holding crypto assets or issuing stablecoins and broadens their authority to cover non FDIC insured state chartered banks. On February 7, that same statement I just talked about is entered into the Federal Register, turning the policy statement into a final rule with no congressional review or public notice or comment, period. And lastly, there's more. I'm just pulling out the big ones. As February Eigth Protego and Paxos applications to follow Anchorage and obtain full approval to become National Trust banks are outstanding past the 18th month deadline and appear likely to be imminently denied by the OCC.
00:36:21.254 - 00:36:30.460, Speaker A: So hopefully this gives you just a flavor of how broad and coordinated and intentionful this effort to debank the crypto industry has become.
00:36:30.990 - 00:37:21.290, Speaker B: You can tell why it's called Operation Choke point is because the banking sector that the state largely controls, the US largely controls, and the executive branch can apply pressure to is choking off the crypto industry. Nick says this too in some banks taking deposits from crypto clients, issuing stablecoins, engaging in crypto custody, or seeking to hold crypto as principle have faced nothing short of an onslaught from regulators in recent weeks. Time and again, using the expression safety and soundness, there it is again. They've made it clear that for a bank touching public blockchains in any way, it should be considered unacceptably risky. Do not touch a blockchain banking industry or we will come after you. That is the message that the executive branch is sending right now.
00:37:21.440 - 00:37:27.434, Speaker A: Yeah, the whole strongly discouraging them is basically just like, don't do that.
00:37:27.552 - 00:37:29.158, Speaker B: You want to get investigated.
00:37:29.334 - 00:37:47.022, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. It's like not a threat. That's also a threat. Jake Shravinsky, who is a lawyer that both Ryan and I trust very much great, great guy. He tweets out this is accurate. Talking about Nick's take. Without new legislation from Congress, federal agencies lack the authority to comprehensively regulate crypto markets.
00:37:47.022 - 00:37:55.182, Speaker A: So their fallback position is to weaponize control over the banking system, to mandate discrimination against crypto companies. This must stop.
00:37:55.336 - 00:38:00.946, Speaker B: That's what it is. It's mandated discrimination, isn't it? Against crypto, against the industry.
00:38:01.138 - 00:38:25.178, Speaker A: This is Senator Bill Hagerty who tweets out regulators, singling out business activities should alarm all Americans. It doesn't matter if it's crypto assets, firearms, or any other lawful business. Using banking regulators to advance political agendas should not be tolerated. Yes, thank you, Senator Bill Hagerty. Appreciate the take. That's great. I'm glad you're a senator.
00:38:25.274 - 00:39:19.390, Speaker B: Look, I think this is Apolitical, right? If it wasn't the Biden administration, then maybe it would be the Trump administration. And obviously people in crypto bankless would come down just as hard on that industry. This is about using the banking system to undemocratically control certain industries and to restrict us from the ability to freely transact with our money. That I think is a breach of American values, of our constitutionally granted liberties, and cannot be tolerated. And it's seeping in. It's not a declared policy, but we can see the effects in the last few months. And I do think David, look, SBF didn't do us any favors, did he? All of this kind of gave those who maybe already wanted to come after crypto an excuse to come do it.
00:39:19.390 - 00:39:35.734, Speaker B: Yes. No one can stand in our way. Now, crypto is clearly a scam. We have perfect cover in order to execute this Operation Choke Point, all we have to do is say SBF, the name FTX, and we'll get whatever we want. That's what seems to be happening.
00:39:35.852 - 00:40:14.686, Speaker A: Yeah, there's absolutely no coincidence that this started right after FTX and the powers that be were just asking for an excuse to do some of this stuff. And also this should hit really close to home because what we're doing in crypto is building systems that intentionally cannot do this. This is what we are trying to prevent. Freedom to transact, no political control over money and economics. So this isn't just like, oh, they're coming for crypto. This is exactly what crypto is standing up to remove the powers of. And it was your take last week, Ryan, that I really, really liked.
00:40:14.686 - 00:40:21.934, Speaker A: Separate government from money, separate finance from political powers.
00:40:22.062 - 00:40:48.070, Speaker B: Thanks for that, James Madison. I got to give credit to that guy. I think he has important things to say on the subject. Yeah, so also this is sort of related, sort of unrelated, but it seems like local bitcoins is closing down. That's certainly a shame. Local bitcoins was a way for you to exchange bitcoins using the Internet as kind of a facilitator, but actually meeting up in person and doing kind of a swap in person. It was completely decentralized.
00:40:48.150 - 00:40:50.666, Speaker A: Craigslist for bitcoin peer to peer, right.
00:40:50.848 - 00:40:53.718, Speaker B: In the analog way, it's like trading.
00:40:53.814 - 00:41:14.754, Speaker A: Cash for crypto, and you would meet up and somebody would give you cash and they would swap for crypto. So you would have to meet with this person. You could have a third party custody person if you wanted to have that as well. But you can kind of get why governments don't want this, but also it's cash and we should be able to trade cash.
00:41:14.872 - 00:41:21.014, Speaker B: Well, I don't know if this is not related. This is just local bitcoins, I think, had to close a while ago.
00:41:21.212 - 00:41:34.490, Speaker A: A long time ago, there was government regulation specifically going after local bitcoins, maybe over two years ago. So local bitcoins has been in the crosshairs of regulation before.
00:41:34.640 - 00:42:09.446, Speaker B: Not only local bitcoins, it might be institutions that provide staking in the US. This just happened before. We recorded this the day before our recording from Brian Armstrong. We're hearing rumors that the SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the US for retail customers. I hope that's not the case, as I believe it would be a terrible path for the US if that was allowed to happen. Brian goes on talking about how it will drive staking offshore will not help the US on its path towards becoming a more innovative economy. It will set us back all of these things.
00:42:09.446 - 00:43:10.054, Speaker B: Again, the SEC is another branch of the know, so this would fit into the whole narrative of Operation Choke Point. This is still a rumor, Brian Armstrong says, but the fact that he tweeted it means that he wanted to make a statement. He wanted to get the news out there. David can you imagine if Gary Gensler and the SEC came after staking in the US retail staking? So that almost implies that if you're wealthy, you can stake. So it's basically like another discrimination, discrimination against the, you know, you're pleb you're too poor to stake. Institutions can it also remains to be seen if this would extend outside of kind of the institutional staking of a coinbase, for example, or a centralized exchange. And would it extend to, like a rocket pool? David would it extend to Elido? Would it extend to a home validator that you're running? Can you imagine that? What a breach of our liberties that would be?
00:43:10.172 - 00:43:13.702, Speaker A: If that allowed to make money at home, you must do it through an institution.
00:43:13.766 - 00:43:31.294, Speaker B: Give me A-I-I don't even know. This is again, it's rumor, and I feel like some of this is obviously Twitter is kind of optimized for maximum FUD. It's probably not as bad as it all sounds, but it's clear something is going on here and we need to brace ourselves. We need to be ready for it.
00:43:31.412 - 00:43:57.350, Speaker A: Yeah. When Brian tweets out something like this, when he starts a tweet thread and the thread says, we're hearing rumors that the SEC would like to get rid of crypto. Staking the like Coinbase lawyers are connected. This isn't Brian. Just like, oh, I heard a rumor. This is Coinbase's lawyers who absolutely know something, who's like Brian. We need to use your messaging and platform and twitter account to broadcast this to the rest of the industry.
00:43:57.350 - 00:44:03.034, Speaker A: We're hearing rumors. The rumors are substantial. I can almost guarantee you that this.
00:44:03.072 - 00:44:12.806, Speaker B: Is definitely the US's loss. And people are saying, well, this is the end of crypto. And the US. Can choke off crypto. It actually can't choke off crypto. It can choke off the US. The US.
00:44:12.806 - 00:44:16.638, Speaker B: Can't kill crypto, but the US. Can kill the US. If it wants to.
00:44:16.724 - 00:44:27.902, Speaker A: The age old line is you cannot ban bitcoin. You can only ban your citizens from accessing bitcoin. There's a difference there. You are just doing a disservice to your own citizens.
00:44:27.966 - 00:44:31.634, Speaker B: There's more from Gensler this week. I can't believe this headline. You want to read it out?
00:44:31.752 - 00:44:57.530, Speaker A: Yeah. So you think this stops at Staking. Ryan Gensler states that NFTs are a gateway token appearing before the students of George Washington high school, SEC jerry Gensler called NFTs a gateway token during his speech about the dangers of crypto. The talk was a one stop shop on a campaign called just say no to crypto bro, which designed to warn younger generations about cryptocurrency.
00:44:58.830 - 00:45:00.374, Speaker B: You didn't give me that time, David.
00:45:00.422 - 00:45:01.354, Speaker A: No, I didn't get you that.
00:45:01.392 - 00:45:06.382, Speaker B: I read this on the agenda ahead of time. So what's this from? This is not true.
00:45:06.516 - 00:45:28.318, Speaker A: This is not true. Although if you believed it, you would be remiss because other things that Gary Gensler have said has been like this this is a rug. So if you believed that without noticing that this was a rug, congratulations. You got rugged. This is a product out of the bankless dow. The rug is basically the onion of crypto. You can go to therug mirror XYZ.
00:45:28.318 - 00:45:35.702, Speaker A: Last week we just started doing this. Last week was the second time we did it. Ryan got rugged and he's the one who pulls up the links in the first place.
00:45:35.756 - 00:45:36.230, Speaker B: I know.
00:45:36.300 - 00:45:44.790, Speaker A: Imagine that. He makes it even better. And so there is a bunch of other headlines. Check them out. They're really great. There's a link in the show notes. You can also collect this rug.
00:45:44.790 - 00:45:46.774, Speaker A: This is a collectible rug. You can collect this rug.
00:45:46.822 - 00:45:58.202, Speaker B: Remember, kids? Just saying, I thought this was great. I thought this was awesome. Good one. Genesis versus DCG. David, am I going to get my money from Gemini earn? How much? How soon? Give me the deeds.
00:45:58.346 - 00:46:37.338, Speaker A: The is not completely locked in stone, but people have done some math. They've done some napkin math and come up with a number of about 80% under the current proposal. Genesis creditors expected to receive 80% recovery under the current proposal. This decrypt article states that Genesis Global revealed their new restructuring plan between Genesis and Digital Currency Group, their conglomerate, which enables creditors to get their money back. So where are all the funds coming from? How is DCG and Genesis coming up with the funds to make Genesis creditors whole? Well, first off, Genesis of course, has some funds. They didn't go to zero. They have some funds to start with.
00:46:37.338 - 00:47:03.794, Speaker A: In addition to the funds that Genesis has, DCG is also selling Genesis Global Trading, and so they will generate some money for that. In addition to that, DCG is also exchanging its existing notes amounting to $1.1 billion for stock and refinancing $1 billion of loan. So it's getting money that way. And they are also moving to sell blocks of shares in the trust that they have. So they have a Litecoin trust. They have a Bitcoin cash trust.
00:47:03.794 - 00:47:39.626, Speaker A: They have an ethereum classic trust. I don't know why they have an ethereum classic trust. They also have a digital large fund cap. And so they hold their own assets in their trust. And so they are selling their trust funds on the open market at a large discount, by the way. And so people are buying these trust assets for very significant discounts of the net present value in the actual trust. And with all of this selling and an additional Ryan $100 million from Gemini to make its own Earn customers whole again to pay for the fault of Genesis, all of that is coming up to about $0.80
00:47:39.626 - 00:47:54.914, Speaker A: on the dollar. So this is the napkin math that has been calculated. If you are a Genesis creditor and that includes Gemini Earned customers, you are perhaps going to get $0.80 on the dollar. Probably not soon, but maybe hopefully this year.
00:47:54.952 - 00:48:03.062, Speaker B: Do you know what? Look, this feels like a very adult thing to do. Everyone took risk. Everyone gets a little bit of a haircut. All right?
00:48:03.196 - 00:48:04.358, Speaker A: DC, including customers.
00:48:04.444 - 00:48:15.434, Speaker B: Including customers. I use Gemini Earn. It was risky before I deposited. I knew I was getting into I feel like I should get a haircut for this. Sure. Not 100% haircut, please.
00:48:15.552 - 00:48:18.486, Speaker A: Crypto God, how do you feel about that? 20% haircut?
00:48:18.678 - 00:48:45.290, Speaker B: Fine. I'm not going to say I deserved it, but it wasn't a bankless thing to do. The reason I've used some of these centralized exchanges is just to kind of test them and compare them versus DeFi. It's not a large amount of money for me. I think for some people, the lesson will be much more painful because they had a large portion of their funds inside of these accounts. They weren't using them in the way I was using them. And that does feel a little lopsided and unfair.
00:48:45.290 - 00:49:03.078, Speaker B: But still, what happened was DCG is taking a big haircut, which they should. Gemini is acknowledging some culpability and contributing to this and depositors take a haircut much different than what's going to happen with Celsius and Blockfly. I don't know if you're going to get anything from Celsius.
00:49:03.254 - 00:49:05.206, Speaker A: No, because Alex mishinsky. Totally rugged.
00:49:05.238 - 00:49:36.306, Speaker B: You Blockfly, you might get something. I don't think we're going to get anything close to 80% from either of those cases. So it's unfortunate, but I'm glad that both the Winkle Vosses and Barry Silbert could kind of come to terms on this and figure this out. There's a lot of back and forth publicly on Twitter before this happened, but this seems to be a reasonably good outcome for depositors. So, look, this was the last domino to fall, and it feels like now it's fully fallen. We dealt with 2022. Can we safely say that now?
00:49:36.328 - 00:49:55.574, Speaker A: David well, now we have to deal with all the regulatory blowback, but the crypto side of things coming to a close. I'll just say that the Winklevy twins and Gemini kind of get a lot of flak, but, I mean, they don't have to put up $100 million, but they are anyways, and so I just want to give them some quick props.
00:49:55.702 - 00:50:07.214, Speaker B: Yeah, that's good. It was also probably a good business decision. I mean, they didn't come out of this looking clean, so that's maybe the cynical view of it, but, yeah, it's good. Good outcome. David, what do we got coming up next?
00:50:07.332 - 00:50:13.390, Speaker A: Coming up next, Arbitrum enables devs to BYOL what's? BYOL Ryan.
00:50:13.810 - 00:50:15.662, Speaker B: Does that stand for bring your own language?
00:50:15.726 - 00:50:20.642, Speaker A: David no, it doesn't. You just made that up. But that is what's happening.
00:50:20.776 - 00:50:22.546, Speaker B: I wanted to say it. Guys, thank you.
00:50:22.648 - 00:50:43.340, Speaker A: Exactly. Lido V two brings Lido's path towards decentralization maker. Dow releases a financial performance report. We're talking about the A 16 Z governance cartel as well as a number of other really cool stuff. Stay tuned for all of that very cool stuff and more. But first, a moment to talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that makes the show possible.
00:50:43.790 - 00:50:53.802, Speaker C: Uniswap is the largest on chain marketplace for self custody digital assets. Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange, but you know this because you've been listening to Bankless.
00:50:53.866 - 00:50:56.042, Speaker A: But did you know that the Uniswap.
00:50:56.106 - 00:50:59.146, Speaker C: Web app has a shiny new Fiat Onramp?
00:50:59.178 - 00:51:00.746, Speaker A: Now, you could go directly from Fiat.
00:51:00.778 - 00:51:40.650, Speaker C: In your bank to tokens in DFI inside of Uniswap. Not only that, but Polygon, Arbitrum and optimism layer two, S, are supported right out of the gate, but that's just DFI. Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, letting you find more listings for the best prices across the NFT world. With Uniswap, you can sweep floors on multiple NFTs and Uniswap's universal router will optimize your gas fees for you. Uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across Ethereum, and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor. So go to app Uniswap.org today to buy, sell or swap tokens and NFTs.
00:51:40.650 - 00:52:02.622, Speaker C: The phantom wallet is coming to Ethereum. The number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved UX to Ethereum and Polygon. If you haven't used Phantom before, you've been missing out. Phantom was one of the first wallets to pioneer Solana. Staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar Staking features for Ethereum and Polygon. But that's just staking. Phantom is also the best home for your NFTs.
00:52:02.622 - 00:52:34.374, Speaker C: Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your NFT experience, pin your favorites, hide the Uglies, remove the spam, and also manage your NFT sale listings from inside the wallet. Phantom is of course a MultiChain wallet, but it makes chain management easy, displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or phishing websites. Phantom has already saved over 20,000 users from getting scammed or hacked. So get on the Phantom Waitlist and be one of the first to access the MultiChain beta. There's a link in the show notes. Or you can go to Phantom app.
00:52:34.512 - 00:52:54.098, Speaker B: Waitlist to get access in late February BYOL David. I'm going to say it again bring your own language. That's what Arbitrum is doing. At least that's what I interpreted. Can you talk about this big development upgrade? I know some of the folks from Prismatic Labs now part of the Arbitrum ecosystem, are very excited about it. But what's happening in Arbitrum world?
00:52:54.184 - 00:53:51.246, Speaker A: So Arbitrum is announcing Stylus, which is what they are calling a next gen programming environment upgrade for the Arbitrum chains Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. What is stylus? Stylus uses WebAssembly to prove all kind of programming languages and run smart contracts on Arbitrum using languages like Rust, C, C Plus Plus haskell Python the move programming languages from Aptos and Sui. Well, now using Stylus, you can use that on Arbitrum. So the idea here is both Arbitrum and optimism have gone after what we call EVM equivalents, but that is really optimizing for solidity. What Stylus is, is perhaps like a sidecar these attachments plugins that uses WebAssembly and WebAssembly lets you use any programming language, which is why Ryan has created this term bring your own language, which has never been stuttered before in the history of ever. And so this is why Arbitrum is calling this EVM Plus, as in EVM Plus literally every other programming.
00:53:51.278 - 00:53:53.430, Speaker B: It's pretty awesome. This has never been done before.
00:53:53.500 - 00:53:56.678, Speaker A: This is a very big deal. This is awesome.
00:53:56.764 - 00:54:22.320, Speaker B: If you're not a developer and you don't know the haskell in Python and C and everything that David mentioned, this is a really big deal. Ethereum's been trying to do this for a long time. It compiles all down to the EVM, but you can bring your own language the third time I got that in, so it's pretty cool. I don't know if I'll be able to do it with like I've got a little bit of HTML experience from your MySpace days. Yeah. You think I can? Thanks. That's how old I am.
00:54:23.170 - 00:54:25.594, Speaker A: Where do you think I learned HTML? It's from MySpace.
00:54:25.642 - 00:54:26.374, Speaker B: On MySpace?
00:54:26.442 - 00:54:26.674, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:26.712 - 00:54:29.598, Speaker B: I remember we were talking about GeoCities one time, though, and you're like, What's GeoCities?
00:54:29.614 - 00:54:31.380, Speaker A: I don't know what GeoCities okay?
00:54:32.230 - 00:54:37.620, Speaker B: The Internet. OGS listening. Know what GeoCities was? Take my word for it.
00:54:38.070 - 00:54:44.162, Speaker A: Yeah. This is how you can date Ryan and date David. That's the line that I came into GeoCities.
00:54:44.226 - 00:54:59.334, Speaker B: David got in during the MySpace days and yeah, well, here we are. Now there's more going on in the dev ecosystem. That is good news though, too. Tell me about Starkware. They're open sourcing their prover technology. That sounds like some geeks speak. Please, Bankless.
00:54:59.334 - 00:55:00.482, Speaker B: Explain it to me, David.
00:55:00.566 - 00:55:33.110, Speaker A: So ZK rollups. Which is what starquare is require provers. Optimistic rollups require fraud proofs, ZK Rollups require provers. And Starquare has announced their plan to open source their prover, which will allow individuals to review the code, detect bugs, transparency, all this stuff. This is one of the critical steps for the decentralization of our layer two S. However, it's kind of the step that is the most esoteric. And if more people didn't know about the prover, that would be kind of okay because it's kind of niche, but it's still important nonetheless.
00:55:33.110 - 00:55:49.098, Speaker A: Notably, they did not actually announce when they would do this. They said that they would open source this at the time that they needed to decentralize Darknet. But they still a good step. It's kind of an announcement of an announcement. They announced that they're committing to it, which I think we actually kind of.
00:55:49.104 - 00:56:08.002, Speaker B: Assumed anyways, David, this was really cool. MakerDAO, they released a financial performance report on the Protocol. All right? And this is all an IPFS. This is so cool because it reminds me of just like, you know how you look up a ten k or quarterly earnings report for your favorite stock? At least I used to do that back in the day.
00:56:08.056 - 00:56:09.410, Speaker A: It's my favorite activity.
00:56:09.750 - 00:56:35.834, Speaker B: Is it really? This is the equivalent, but it's so cool. Look at these key financial results for the Maker Protocol. This is all on chain revenue that they're able to kind of generate these reports from and then put it on IPFS. These are unstoppable organizations. That's what a dow is. It's an unstoppable I'll put an air quotes corporation on ethereum doesn't have a jurisdiction. I could go on about this, but what do you think was cool about it?
00:56:35.952 - 00:57:15.894, Speaker A: For the podcast listeners who aren't looking at the screen, what we're looking at on screen is a financial statement report that looks exactly like what a boomer would love to see. This is speaking boomer talk, TradFi talk. This is a financial statement report for the Maker Protocol, again, hosted on IPFS, which is pretty damn cool. And it is organized with just like in the way that an Excel sheet and year ending year over year, all of. These terms net operating earnings, total operating expenses, total net revenues, blah, blah, blah, blah. All of these things that would make TradFi able to understand what's going on.
00:57:15.932 - 00:57:44.354, Speaker B: Here, by the way, bankless listeners. And for all the baby boomers listening right now, when David says the term boomer, sometimes he's using that as a term of endearment. And that was at least half the time I'd say, yeah, David calls me a boomer when I do something because you're getting excited or I talk about taxes or I talk about things that adult boomer things. And so I hope you took that as a compliment. I'm doing some intergenerational translation here.
00:57:44.392 - 00:57:52.866, Speaker A: Yeah. Maturity. It's like people that require mature reports about what's going on in DFI would adult things. Adult things. Yes.
00:57:52.968 - 00:57:54.594, Speaker B: All right, what do we got?
00:57:54.712 - 00:57:58.834, Speaker A: Boomer things and adult things are mostly not all, but mostly synonymous.
00:57:58.962 - 00:58:13.450, Speaker B: Here we go. A 16 z. They voted against a proposal to deploy the latest Uniswap iteration on the BNB chain, flexing their token governance power. A lot of people were upset about this. Can you tell us about the controversy and some of the takes here?
00:58:13.520 - 00:58:36.898, Speaker A: Yeah, so people are gearing this up as a VC versus VC governance war. So it's a 16 Z versus jump crypto. A 16 Z backs. And this has to do with the bridge that connects the Uni vote between the Wormhole Bridge. The Wormhole Bridge. So, like, Wormhole is backed by Jump. A 16 Z backs, layer zero.
00:58:36.984 - 00:58:43.874, Speaker B: But there was a proposal to put Uniswap on BNB, and then there was some controversy over what bridge that they would use.
00:58:43.912 - 00:59:25.870, Speaker A: Is this right? Well, this is what people are assuming is being fought over. So A 16 Z wants Uniswap to use the layer zero bridge, which is their product that they invested in. Jump wants Uniswap to use the Wormhole Bridge, which is what Jump invested in. And so now these EVCS are fighting over this. I don't think Jump crypto voted with their tokens, but it was the Wormhole Bridge that was used in this proposal, which A 16 Z used its governance power to veto. And so the debate about which bridge to use is partly about security, because we all know the dangers of layer one cross layer one bridges. A 16 Z used 15 million of their Uni tokens to vote against the Wormhole Bridge for the Uniswap V Three deployment.
00:59:26.710 - 00:59:31.826, Speaker B: Do you have a take on this? Some people are outraged, calling this an A 16 Z cartel. What's your take?
00:59:31.928 - 00:59:55.018, Speaker A: Yeah, so I'll give my take at the end. This is Steven's Tweet Doge tosi from the block, and a quote from the community that he's quoting says, if A 16 Z goes against the community vote and tries to tank it, I'd be shocked. That would be truly abhorrent. I don't think that they would go that far. And then he follows up with narrator they went that far. That far. Because that's what they did.
00:59:55.018 - 01:00:37.586, Speaker A: However, there is Eddie Lazarin, who I believe is at A 16 Z who tweets out this, seeing many false claims about A 16 Z's crypto's voting power in Uniswap foundation governance. Let me clear it up. A 16 Z, we delegate 40 million votes to outside groups with no conditions on how they vote. We vote with 15 million tokens, less than half of what we've delegated to others. So A 16 Z has given their governance power of the majority of their tokens to others and they say that they don't have any influence over their vote. And so the A 16 Z used 15 million of their Uni tokens to vote on the proposal that they wanted and that swayed the vote. And the thing is, they were the only ones that really voted for the no to reject.
01:00:37.586 - 01:00:41.574, Speaker A: Almost everyone else voted yes, which is why this is controversial.
01:00:41.702 - 01:00:46.586, Speaker B: But I mean, the vast majority of voters just tokens didn't vote at all. We should specify that.
01:00:46.688 - 01:00:59.520, Speaker A: Very good point. Like a minority of total voters. Do I feel like this is a VC cartel? Not really. I'm kind of like man about this whole thing. What's your take?
01:00:59.890 - 01:01:05.474, Speaker B: My take is similar. I think it's token voting. Clear on what that means, right?
01:01:05.512 - 01:01:05.810, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:05.880 - 01:01:27.282, Speaker B: The protocol states that those with the majority of tokens win the vote is literally what it says. I think people need to realize that some of the decentralization and the token voting around these protocols is like actually not pure decentralization. The most decentralized part of Uniswap is the code that runs uniswap.
01:01:27.346 - 01:01:27.670, Speaker A: Right.
01:01:27.740 - 01:02:05.858, Speaker B: That's it. After that, you have varying degrees of decentralization or centralization. This token vote is very similar to the governance mechanism for publicly traded companies or for any pool of capital that has kind of some sort of shareholder vote. So I've never exalted the idea of token vote in my mind and thought that this was somehow some panacea and somehow more decentralized than shareholder voting models. I've always thought that look, it's just the shareholder voting model that we've ported into crypto. We're not making that part of things any more decentralized. Am I mad?
01:02:05.874 - 01:02:14.918, Speaker A: That decentralization. That's really the issue here. It's that A 16 Z went against the community. But why? They are the community.
01:02:15.004 - 01:02:15.974, Speaker B: They are the community.
01:02:16.092 - 01:03:04.946, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the deal. And also, just to give the pro side of the A 16 Z argument, just one more line is like yo, let's not discount how cautious and conservative that we should be when it comes to which cross chain layer one bridge that we should support. And if a 16 Z who has the resources and manpower and technical capacities to vet the security of cross chain bridges feel that the Wormhole Bridge is insecure which has already been hacked once by the way. Not to say that their bridge layer zero can't be hacked but if that's what their expert opinion is they have the resources in the world much more than the community, the retail of the world to actually vet that bridge. And so I think we should actually appreciate some of their abilities to do due diligence beyond retail.
01:03:04.978 - 01:03:47.538, Speaker B: I think we should consider it for sure. And for those who are saying, oh, look at Ryan and David, are now a 16 Z apologists. No, that's not what we're saying. VC Apologists the ultimate remedy for this is the ability to go fork the uniswap code and spin up your own uniswap. The decentralization of Uniswap is that a 16 Z, no matter how hard they ever tried, cannot shut down the code and turn the thing off or ban you from using uniswap. That is the decentralization that makes uniswap actually bankless. And so, governance layer aside, I think there are far more ways to preserve the decentralization of protocols that are built on crypto versus the real world.
01:03:47.538 - 01:03:51.750, Speaker B: David, what's going on in the NFT world? I see a Tweet here from Lincoln Park. What are we looking at?
01:03:51.820 - 01:04:25.850, Speaker A: Yeah, they have a new music video, Lost, which is getting a ton of attention and hype. The reason why it's relevant is that the beloved artist people, Pleaser the artist that created the uniswap v three X times Y equals K NFT movie, which created pleaser. Dow, which has already also done so much stuff people, Pleaser. The artist created the directed the music video for Lost for Lincoln Park. Congrats. People Pleaser is a dear friend of mine. I think she's becoming probably one of the iconic NFT artists of this space.
01:04:25.850 - 01:04:38.070, Speaker A: The fact that she's working with Lincoln Park, I think, is fantastic. You know what else she's done? Ryan before she came into the world of crypto, she did the cinematic shorts for Diablo Four.
01:04:38.220 - 01:04:38.918, Speaker B: No way.
01:04:39.004 - 01:04:39.640, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:04:41.050 - 01:04:44.086, Speaker B: Diablo has some epic cinematics that's amazing.
01:04:44.188 - 01:04:45.814, Speaker A: Yeah, she does killer work.
01:04:45.852 - 01:04:49.410, Speaker B: Is there an NFT related to this at all? Sorry, is this going to be an NFT?
01:04:49.570 - 01:04:51.418, Speaker A: I actually can I buy this, actually?
01:04:51.504 - 01:04:52.886, Speaker B: Oh, this is all about People, pleaser.
01:04:52.918 - 01:04:55.018, Speaker A: This is all about People, pleaser. Okay.
01:04:55.184 - 01:04:55.818, Speaker B: All right.
01:04:55.904 - 01:05:26.354, Speaker A: So I don't believe that there is an NFT, but it's People, Pleaser and also her startup, Shibuya, who's kind of like a choose your own adventure type of production studio. So their community does have tokens NFTs, and using those tokens, you can choose the outcome of what this production company will make their story like. So Shibuya is also part of this music video for Lincoln Park. So just an overall success for People Pleaser and Shibuya a crypto DeFi NFT native team. So that's how it's related.
01:05:26.482 - 01:05:52.282, Speaker B: David so Coffeezilla is somebody who exposes scammers and has been doing a lot of scam exposing in the crypto space lately. This is a tweet from Coffeezilla. Just earlier this week, we just tricked Dylan Danis into promoting a fake NFT project. We paid him $1,000 to post. He didn't disclose it. Was an ad and posted copy that literally spells out S-K-A-M. That's not how scam.
01:05:52.346 - 01:05:53.850, Speaker A: That's not how you spell scam.
01:05:54.010 - 01:06:03.114, Speaker B: How do you spell Scam? David. You spell it with A-K-S-C-A-M. That is Scam. The word scam.
01:06:03.162 - 01:06:19.478, Speaker A: David so he's promoting. He got again, coffeezilla told Dylan, Dan says, hey, we'll pay you $1,000 to promote this. It's our NFT project. It's called sours. Candies are moonbound scam. And then Dylan just tweets this out. Check this out.
01:06:19.478 - 01:06:48.350, Speaker A: Sours NFT kennis are moonbound hashtag, not financial advice. And then soursnft.com. What this man did not do, Ryan, if you scroll down, is that he did not go to the website. So Coffeezilla follows up and says, the entire project is fake. And if you mint it, it takes you to the website devoted to all the scams that he has done in the past. He being Dylan Danis, the guy that's tweeting this out. So the website, Dylan Danis, some MMA fighter, not related, not relevant.
01:06:48.350 - 01:07:07.302, Speaker A: They made a website that is of all of these scams that Dylan Danis has promoted, and then they paid him to promote this Token Mint. And the Token Mint website was actually this website that was about how all of Dylan Danis has promoted scams. So the guy didn't even check the link.
01:07:07.436 - 01:07:08.022, Speaker B: Wow.
01:07:08.156 - 01:07:12.566, Speaker A: And he did it for $1,000, right? $1,000.
01:07:12.668 - 01:07:15.334, Speaker B: How much would you sell your reputation integrity for?
01:07:15.372 - 01:07:20.610, Speaker A: David at least $2,000. Guy's low Pauling himself.
01:07:20.690 - 01:07:27.030, Speaker B: I mean, what do you think of this kind of like honeypot activity by people like Coffeezilla, like, baiting the influencers?
01:07:27.110 - 01:07:27.994, Speaker A: I think it's awesome.
01:07:28.112 - 01:07:28.954, Speaker B: Do it more.
01:07:29.072 - 01:07:30.620, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, yeah, please.
01:07:31.870 - 01:07:39.726, Speaker B: I will say this is maybe a good time to shill our disclosures. Bankless.com slash disclosures. I actually think we do a pretty good job of this.
01:07:39.748 - 01:07:48.110, Speaker A: David which is I think we have the best disclosures in the crypto industry. I don't know of anyone who has more strict disclosures than we impose on ourselves.
01:07:48.190 - 01:07:50.306, Speaker B: If you see somebody that's better, send.
01:07:50.328 - 01:07:54.786, Speaker A: Them to us because we'll beat them. Yeah, we'll change it. We will.
01:07:54.808 - 01:07:55.540, Speaker B: One up.
01:07:55.910 - 01:07:57.086, Speaker A: We'll up the ante.
01:07:57.198 - 01:08:24.400, Speaker B: Anyway. You can see all the sponsors for bankless individual investments that we have, investments of people on our team, disclosures of Bankless, LLC. Anyway, it's all there. And I think this is really important to hold people who have influence in society to this type of a standard. And we don't have kind of the regulations or the ad police. I don't necessarily want that either, but I do want disclosure to be a social norm across all of crypto. I think that's really important.
01:08:24.400 - 01:08:32.650, Speaker B: David FTX, tell us about the bad boys. So let's start with SBF and then get to Doequan. What's happening with SBF?
01:08:32.810 - 01:08:58.118, Speaker A: This is just FTX debtors want their political donations back. So FTX debtors are sending confidential notes? Apparently not. That confidential because we heard about them. To the recipients of donations from FTX as lawyers review $93 million in political contributions as part of the bankruptcy case. So they are sending out all of the political figures or entities or whatever I love to saying them, hey, that money that FTX donated to you, you.
01:08:58.124 - 01:08:58.886, Speaker B: Should give it back.
01:08:58.988 - 01:08:59.670, Speaker A: Give it back?
01:08:59.740 - 01:09:01.050, Speaker B: Yeah, because it wasn't his.
01:09:01.200 - 01:09:17.966, Speaker A: Politicians who received contributions linked to FTX should return the money by February 20. Eigth some political groups have already taken steps to return the money. The Democratic National Committee and Senate and House Campaign committees have set aside a million dollars in cash and to return to bankruptcy. Lawyers as well as others as well.
01:09:17.988 - 01:09:20.414, Speaker B: There is justice in the world, David. This is good news.
01:09:20.532 - 01:09:33.698, Speaker A: Oh, and this is also if you don't do this, that just means that FTX is going to go to court to claw back the fund. So this is like volunteer to do this now or we take you to court to claw it back. So this is like do this the.
01:09:33.704 - 01:09:34.578, Speaker B: Easy way is a hard way.
01:09:34.664 - 01:09:35.714, Speaker A: Exactly. That's exactly right.
01:09:35.752 - 01:09:57.706, Speaker B: Yeah. There was a rumor going on earlier this week, speaking of FTX, that the Super Bowl was going to ban cryptocurrency TV commercials. Now, I don't think that's true. That said, David, I don't expect to see many, if any, crypto commercials this year. And that was such a contrast. I remember last year at this time, this exact roll up last year, we were excited about anticipating it was an.
01:09:57.728 - 01:09:58.794, Speaker A: Article about it, right?
01:09:58.832 - 01:10:10.080, Speaker B: And just after it. And in fact, I hate to say this now, it sounds terrible, but you got to give FTX credit. At least whoever did their ads, they actually had the best ads they had last year.
01:10:10.610 - 01:10:14.170, Speaker A: It's on brand. For the scam to have the best one. They're all marketing.
01:10:14.330 - 01:10:25.906, Speaker B: I mean, it was such a well done scam. Wasn't like SBF pulled that part of it off anyway. But there's coinbase. There was who else? There was etoro. There's a whole bunch of them last year.
01:10:25.928 - 01:10:45.980, Speaker A: None of that budweiser had shout outs to crypto projects. They had the nouns goggles, which was the most what would I call tasteful and just well researched way of putting crypto into your I don't think we're it's a way that wouldn't offend normies because they don't know what those goggles the noggles were the nouns goggles. But all the crypto people knew.
01:10:46.430 - 01:11:07.310, Speaker B: This is for those in the US. If you're watching the Super Bowl this weekend, if you notice a Super Bowl commercial about crypto, then Tweet Bankless want to hear about them. If you see anything subtle the Super Bowl is this weekend, isn't it? Look, neither of us know, which maybe tells you something. Maybe it's another fact check. It's sometime in February.
01:11:07.470 - 01:11:11.522, Speaker A: Oh, it is. Oh, my God. It's the twelveTH. Yeah. That's your party plan.
01:11:11.656 - 01:11:15.762, Speaker B: I had no fucking big sports fans over here.
01:11:15.816 - 01:11:41.354, Speaker A: No idea. Do you know where dope but the rumor was it was that crypto ads in the Super Bowl are banned. They're not banned. Two companies, they just don't have any money. Yeah, all the money fell through. So two other companies were on the 1 YD line. They said, quote from the article, before the collapse of FTX, and then that created the NFL motivated to look elsewhere for their at.
01:11:41.354 - 01:11:44.622, Speaker A: And so it's not banned. It's just like all the deals fell through.
01:11:44.756 - 01:11:50.122, Speaker B: Can we find this guy, though? Doe Kwan? We talked about SBF, where's he unknown.
01:11:50.186 - 01:12:07.878, Speaker A: And that is what Korean officials are who they're looking for him. So Korean officials traveled to Serbia, to the far reaches of Serbia last week to help seek out Doe Kwan, who is a fugitive. So a long time ago, an arrest warrant. Yeah, dude, he's still tweeting, man.
01:12:08.044 - 01:12:16.166, Speaker B: They can't somehow track an IP address and figure out I don't know, man, are they trying? How hard are they trying?
01:12:16.268 - 01:12:35.850, Speaker A: There's an international red notice out for his arrest, which means that, like, yo, all governments who are anything, if you find this guy, arrest him. So people are going as far as Serbia to find like, there's only a matter of time we're going to get this guy. Doe kwan's going to jail.
01:12:35.930 - 01:12:41.994, Speaker B: Yeah, real small world. Hard to hide. Kyle Davies is also hiding. David, what's this headline?
01:12:42.122 - 01:13:17.914, Speaker A: Yeah, so a few weeks ago, we covered the Twitter subpoena because Kyle Davies was also still tweeting. And so since they couldn't find the man, they just tweeted out his subpoena because they knew that he was still tweeting. And so a quote from this article, a quote from one of the attorneys says, he is without question aware of the subpoena, having been tagged in 41 replies and 64 retweets. One of those was mine. And has once again chosen to ignore his duties to Three Arrows Capital. Says Russell Crumpler and Christopher Farmer seeing the bankruptcy training firm. Yeah, cool.
01:13:17.952 - 01:13:25.910, Speaker B: Kind. Davies was taking interviews, like, at least a couple months ago. Remember, he's raising to build an excuse.
01:13:25.990 - 01:13:43.218, Speaker A: I mean, he's just doing this blatantly. It's like, hey, all of the charges that I'm probably guilty for, I'm not going to answer to. Meanwhile, I'm going to stay in Dubai and raise for my new fund. Did I share my DMs with him?
01:13:43.224 - 01:13:43.554, Speaker B: With you?
01:13:43.592 - 01:13:52.886, Speaker A: He messaged me. Dude, I'm going to pull up my DMs right now on my phone. Hold on. Kyle Davies. When did he message me? Monday, January 30. Hey, David. Hope you're well.
01:13:52.886 - 01:14:02.762, Speaker A: Sue and I are launching open exchange soon. It would be great to get your feedback if you're free this week. What does Kyle Davies expect from me? Dude, I am not your friend.
01:14:02.816 - 01:14:09.558, Speaker B: I hope you told him you were free and then respond, well, it's not too late.
01:14:09.654 - 01:14:22.430, Speaker A: Go ahead, I'd be curious. Okay, so I was joking with a few friends. I was like, yeah, I'll do this, but I'm also bringing on five of my friends and we're going to roast you as you talk, but I don't think he'd be interested.
01:14:22.500 - 01:14:50.538, Speaker B: Yeah, that's not probably not appealing to him right now. I think he wants to pitch his company. Meanwhile, this is going on. Consensus is fighting to get staking tax free. Essentially, they're backing a lawsuit against the IRS over taxing staked crypto. And here's the argument. It's basically some appellates are arguing the position that staking rewards should not be considered taxable income because there's no employer that's doubling them out.
01:14:50.538 - 01:15:23.134, Speaker B: It's a protocol, it's not employer, it's just code. They should instead be considered effectively self generated or created property. And there actually is some precedent for this. David it's similar to a farmer who grows crops. Staking rewards are created by the protocol to incentivize participating in providing security for the protocol. So created property is not taxed until sale. Right now, the tax treatment of a staked income most people assume of staked ether or any asset most people assume is just as income.
01:15:23.134 - 01:15:54.266, Speaker B: So you receive it as income and it's taxable income the same way a salary might be in your job. Well, this argument that's happening in the court system right now is that it should be treated more like growing crops. And when you grow more crops, that's not a tax event. It remains to be seen whether this holds up in court, but that would be incredible if it did. That would mean all of the staked revenue that people receive is not actually taxable at the time they receive.
01:15:54.298 - 01:15:55.150, Speaker A: I love those words.
01:15:55.220 - 01:16:00.014, Speaker B: Yeah, just when you sell. Just when you sell. Yeah, we'll see. I'm rooting for them.
01:16:00.132 - 01:16:01.486, Speaker A: That makes too much sense.
01:16:01.588 - 01:16:04.334, Speaker B: David it's ship season. What are we shipping season? What do we got?
01:16:04.372 - 01:16:37.078, Speaker A: Oh, my God. So much. Lido V two path towards decentralization. A new architecture for Lido that is supposed to be the architecture that allows for Lido to accept anyone to be a validator in the Lido system. It is a big step is one of the biggest steps that Lido has needed to take for a long time to open up Lido to more permissionless validation. So anyone, not just a permission set of validators can join the Lido dao. This is also where technologies like DVT come into play and this is also how Lido can become more modular and composable.
01:16:37.078 - 01:16:38.860, Speaker A: So that is really cool.
01:16:39.950 - 01:16:41.126, Speaker B: A bit more like rocket pool.
01:16:41.158 - 01:17:09.618, Speaker A: Yeah, in that direction. So this is much more similar to stakewise's design philosophy, but overall the same ethos is applied here. So we like this. This is more decentralization from what has previously been by some hardliners in the community fixes Lido's two centralized nature. So there's that. Ave Go gho is their stablecoin is now on the Gorli testnet. So another decentralized stablecoin is coming to play to follow after makers die.
01:17:09.618 - 01:17:53.022, Speaker A: Curve stablecoin is also coming soon. There's elements hyperdrive element is an interest rate vehicle inside of DeFi totally permissionless. It has previously been plagued by having to pick a very specific term and having to fragment liquidity across all their different pools. Hyperdrive is fitting into this theme that I've been noticing, Ryan, where a lot of these DeFi apps that have to segment liquidity and pick different terms like live refinance compiles into this camp. They have found a way to put and pool all liquidity together and allow for any term length for any sort of market. And so just much a better, stronger evolution of what Element is trying to do. Congratulations to Element.
01:17:53.022 - 01:18:29.866, Speaker A: There is Infinity Pools, which Dan Elitzer, who is I got one of these gigabrains when it comes to just like crypto economic on the app layer protocols. So Infinity Pools is out there and Dan Elitzer says this is by far one of the most interesting things I've seen. Built on top of UNEV three, any asset, unlimited leverage, no oracles, no liquidations, no counterparty risk. Nailing the UX will be tricky, he says, but this design is a very cool breakthrough in what I thought was not possible in DFI. I have not yet looked into Infinity Pools, but I definitely want to because Dan said something like this. I pay attention. Mean Finance.
01:18:29.866 - 01:18:56.006, Speaker A: Mean Finance is a dollar cost averaging tool in DeFi. So dollar cost averaging without a bank have introduced their Meta aggregator. So you know all the DEXes, Ryan, uniswap sushi swap, et cetera. Well, they have Dex aggregators, right? Like matcha and one inch. Well mean Finance is a dex aggregator. Aggregator? So it's recursing one more time if you want to connect to MetaMask and try this out.
01:18:56.028 - 01:19:05.770, Speaker B: Yeah, go for I just connect my MetaMask wallet here, let me do that. Connect. And this will allow me to dollar cost average in to crypto positions.
01:19:06.510 - 01:19:15.270, Speaker A: So that is the invest tab over there on the left. But you can also swap now with Mean Finances dex aggregator. Aggregator.
01:19:15.350 - 01:19:24.640, Speaker B: This is awesome. And this is in our opinion, the most foolproof way to build positions in crypto is to dollar cost average over time.
01:19:25.570 - 01:19:38.994, Speaker A: Yeah, I believe Mean Finance is on multiple networks, including polygon. I think it's fantastic. So rare. No, we're not done yet with the ship season. So rare. Partners with the Premier League, which I think is a big deal. Football fans check me on this.
01:19:38.994 - 01:19:57.354, Speaker A: Premier League sounds pretty so from the article football fans from around the world can now collect, buy, sell and trade officially licensed digital cards featuring every player from across the Premier League's 20 clubs. I'm assuming this is like the Premier League of football. I'm assuming this is a big deal.
01:19:57.392 - 01:20:00.950, Speaker B: For football for I think it is a big deal, David. I definitely do.
01:20:01.120 - 01:20:03.440, Speaker A: I am striking out on my sports stuff.
01:20:04.610 - 01:20:15.166, Speaker B: The tech behind this is Starkware, right? ZK technology behind this, which is the thing that you and I geek over about the football the sports stuff is kind of lost on us as it.
01:20:15.188 - 01:20:16.180, Speaker A: Wants to an end.
01:20:17.830 - 01:20:37.490, Speaker B: David with all this shipping going on, that means there's been a lot of building. And to build, we need people in crypto. The bankless jobs board is popping.

And for just under $21 a month, it probably pays for itself with just one AirDrop. So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get. That's ear NiFi. And make sure you never lose another AirDrop.
01:23:36.630 - 01:24:05.110, Speaker B: Guys, we're back. Questions from the nation. Here's one from Pharo ETH in the bankless. Citizen discord. As Zke EVMs rapidly grow to new ecosystems on top of Ethereum, could you outline the major selling points for most prominent projects like StarkNet ZKsync? You said as David, you've recently been to Israel for StarkNet. So tell us about the major selling points of StarkNet, of ZKsync, maybe even of scroll, if you're feeling extra ambitious.
01:24:05.190 - 01:24:58.554, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's really just there's a few areas, a few frontiers of innovation that is specifically being hosted by the ZK rollups. Specifically why ZK rollups? Because all the optimistic rollups out there, optimism, Arbitrum are trying to be EVM equivalent, EVM Ethereum equivalent, which means there are certain things that are not enabled. Ethereum does not have this thing called account abstraction enabled, which prevents all of our optimistic rollups to have what we call smart contract wallets, which are something I'm going to explain in the next question. But the frontier of account abstraction and smart contract wallets are absolutely happening on ZK rollups. And so we'll talk about smart contract wallets in a second, but eventually everyone's going to have a smart contract wallet and that is starting on the ZK rollups. Argent Bankless listeners might be familiar with also braavos as well. There's some other smart contract wallets that are out there that's a big one.
01:24:58.554 - 01:25:47.414, Speaker A: Massive, massive field of innovation and opportunity there. There's also the world of onchain gaming. We all know that the term web3 gaming, and this is generally known as like gaming, but with assets that's different and much smaller in my mind, of an opportunity than on chain gaming, which is where all of the logic goes. On chain? Why not? You can put more. Composable components of your game on chain and allow that metaverse, if you will, to be organically built. And so this is a very limited example, but say like your chess moves go on chain, like knight to F three, great move that can be composed upon for whatever goddamn reason that you can think of. And so just use your imaginations.
01:25:47.414 - 01:26:04.878, Speaker A: Your physical location in Minecraft is stored on chain. And that can trigger if this, then that statements. And so more stuff on chain produces games that we can't even think about. And it's the ZK roll up technology that the insane levels of compression that ZK rollups have enable stuff like this to happen.
01:26:04.964 - 01:26:35.686, Speaker B: So you get more compression versus optimistic roll ups. So that's what separates ZK versus optimistic rollups. Now, we have ZK EVMs, but the difference between Starkware versus something like scroll, my high level take on it is we have like four main ZK EVM types of ecosystems. One is the Starkware ecosystem. Another is ZK EVM from Matter labs. Another is what Polygon is doing with Hermes that they acquired. And the fourth is scroll.
01:26:35.686 - 01:27:04.770, Speaker B: Now, I think on the far side of the spectrum, the most EVM equivalent, I'd probably put scroll. And the least EVM equivalent that is mirrors the Ethereum mainnet virtual machine environment. You could just port code from here to here is probably StarkNet. They use even a different language. They use Cairo rather than solidity. And then ZK, sync and polygon. Yeah, it's somewhere in between.
01:27:04.770 - 01:27:36.590, Speaker B: That's sort of how I think about them. But from a high level, if you're just sort of a user, you don't see a lot of the trade offs here. I think a lot of the trade offs are going to come from actually developers and the builders. And it will remain to be seen which of these Zke EVMs really hit product market fit and really nail it and what communities they attract. And it's still super early to call any winners or to even understand which of these Zke EVMs, what niches they're going to exist in and dominate in.
01:27:36.660 - 01:27:53.022, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's right. And I think they're all going to find product market fit in their own particular ways. Each one, like optimism and Arbitrum, are differentiating and what's being built on top of them. And I think they're all viable. They're just optimizing for different things. And along with their relevant BD teams.
01:27:53.086 - 01:28:07.158, Speaker B: At this stage, use them all. Try them out, see what you like. Here's another question from Killjoy from the Bankless member discord as well. Hey, guys, I've heard you mention account abstraction. There you go. David. Teen, you up a lot, but I'm wondering if you can explain it in more detail.
01:28:07.158 - 01:28:26.686, Speaker B: I'm not sure how to grasp what it unlocks in Ethereum that can't already be done with tools like Gnosisafe. Gnosisafe, of course, is a multi SIG wallet. Fantastic wallet. We use it at Bankless all of the time. Everyone uses this. What's different? Why is account abstraction better? You mentioned smart contract wallets. Is that part of the puzzle here?
01:28:26.788 - 01:28:53.350, Speaker A: Yeah. So you said Nosasafe is a multi SIG wallet. Technically, it's actually a smart contract wallet. And what that smart contract does, Ryan, is enable multi sigs. So it's like a semantics, but important. It is a smart contract wallet, and that smart contract is meant to be a multi SIG wallet. Account abstraction is this term that is one of these terrible words that we come up with in crypto and doesn't really help anyone understand it.
01:28:53.350 - 01:29:45.586, Speaker A: But account abstraction enables smart contract wallets on the Ethereum layer. One more natively Nosasafe, has kind of had to brute force it, in a way. And so what is a smart contract wallet? What is account abstraction? Like I said, account abstraction enables smart contract wallets to exist. And it is perhaps like an EIP or technical standard that needs to be embedded in the actual protocol of a blockchain in order for native smart contract wallets to exist. So, like I said earlier, externally owned accounts, which are like public addresses, public accounts, public wallets that are externally owned, externally being like a private key, which is external to the Ethereum protocol. Again, another terrible phrase, another terrible word that this crypto came up with. But to apply a metaphor here to get you to understand what the hell I'm talking about, if Bitcoin is to externally owned accounts, ethereum is to smart contract wallets.
01:29:45.586 - 01:29:52.418, Speaker A: Currently an externally owned account is a dumb input output only, very primitive wallet.
01:29:52.594 - 01:29:58.778, Speaker B: And let's just be clear, whenever you're saying externally owned account, that is probably the ETH address that you have today.
01:29:58.864 - 01:30:04.618, Speaker A: Probably. Do you use a MetaMask? Do you use a ledger? Do you use a trezor? Do you use coinbase wallet?
01:30:04.634 - 01:30:05.534, Speaker B: Do you have a private key?
01:30:05.572 - 01:30:06.890, Speaker A: Do you have a private phrase?
01:30:06.970 - 01:30:12.590, Speaker B: These types of things, that means these are all externally owned accounts, right? And that's what you're saying?
01:30:12.660 - 01:30:12.894, Speaker A: Yes.
01:30:12.932 - 01:30:13.230, Speaker B: Okay.
01:30:13.300 - 01:30:36.546, Speaker A: And so Ethereum is smart contract wallets. Bitcoin is like externally owned accounts. So that's why this is kind of so hard to explain, because a smart contract wallet is like a smart contract. It's a Turing Complete wallet where your ledger or MetaMask is just signs, messages. A smart contract wallet can do anything. And so you can input any bit of code that you want. You can input rules.
01:30:36.546 - 01:30:55.710, Speaker A: You can make it expressive. And so the UX upgrades that smart contract wallets will bring to crypto are going to eliminate so much of what makes crypto wallets difficult and unintuitive. And account abstraction unlocks the ability to have smart contract wallets enshrined into the protocol rather than having to be built on top of.
01:30:55.780 - 01:31:43.902, Speaker B: Do you know how I would explain account abstraction in just, like, the dumbest possible way is like, you guys know how hard it is to use crypto wallets, even good ones, like MetaMask, for instance, or ledger, it's still really hard to use them. Account abstraction will make a crypto wallet like Venmo as smooth as a Venmo. Or maybe if you're in Europe, like a Revolute, like the fintech apps where you just log in, you get your Face ID, you unlock it, you can set limits, you can transfer out, you're not paying outrageously high gas fees and clicking Sign Transaction. Sign Transaction. Oh, my God, did I just send to the wrong account? It will smooth all of that out and make crypto wallets look like fintech. That is the bottom line. And we can't unlock account abstraction on Ethereum main net today.
01:31:43.902 - 01:31:51.482, Speaker B: Right. We need an EIP needs to be implemented first. But we can start in the layer two environment.
01:31:51.546 - 01:31:51.774, Speaker A: Correct.
01:31:51.812 - 01:32:06.290, Speaker B: And that's what you're saying is ZK roll ups are really doubling down, tripling down on account abstraction wallet. If you've ever used Argent, for instance, on where's that deployed, is that ZK sync right now?
01:32:06.360 - 01:32:35.886, Speaker A: So Argent has two. They have Argent, which is the Ethereum Main net smart contract wallet, which as soon as Ethereum left its one GUI gas fee paradigm, it was in 2019, it just broke so bad because we don't have account abstraction on the layer one. So while they've been maintaining their Argent wallet at the layer one, they've really been focusing on what they are calling Argent X, which is their ZK roll up smart contract wallet, which is dominated by on the Sarknet layer two.
01:32:36.068 - 01:32:43.194, Speaker B: Yeah. And that's going to be more what the experience will be for the everyday users. This is how we mainstream crypto.
01:32:43.242 - 01:33:05.094, Speaker A: Right? I don't have this Tweet in here, but I tweeted this out like, you are not using your imagination big enough to understand how big of a deal smart contract wallets are. It is a zero to one moment in wallets. Ethereum was like, okay, let's put software into our tokens, software into our money. That's what an ERC 20 token is like. Asset plus software. That's what smart contracts are. That makes it so cool.
01:33:05.094 - 01:33:19.994, Speaker A: That's why we love it. We have not yet had that zero to one moment for our wallets. Our wallets are still like just simple bitcoin input outputs. We are not having the bitcoin to Ethereum moment about our wallets yet in the Ethereum world.
01:33:20.112 - 01:33:40.354, Speaker B: Yep, that's right. Huge improvements coming and getting closer. David, some takes of the week. I'll read yours. All blockchains are illegitimate. In their early days, they have unknown founder alignment, poor token distribution, highest risk of bugs and exploits, unknown economic sustainability. Legitimacy is only gained by proof and time.
01:33:40.354 - 01:33:43.394, Speaker B: David, you saying a new chain has to earn it?
01:33:43.512 - 01:33:47.366, Speaker A: New chain has to earn it. Yeah. And actually, I have a follow on Tweet if you want to keep on going.
01:33:47.468 - 01:34:05.846, Speaker B: I'll go. This is why incumbent blockchain communities haze the newer ones, don't trust them until they prove they're here for the long term bitcoiners. Haze the ethereums. Ethereums haze the solanians. Did I say that right? So on and so forth. It's not maximalist behavior, it's a healthy immune response.
01:34:05.958 - 01:34:09.420, Speaker A: How do you feel about that take? Some people said that that was a pretty spicy take.
01:34:10.190 - 01:34:38.262, Speaker B: I completely agree. I 100% agree with it. The social layer is an immune system. If your social layer of your chain doesn't have an immune system, what happens? Imagine if your body didn't have an immune system, David. You had no white blood cells get eaten alive. You get eaten alive by viruses, by malignant cells, by cancers. All of those types try to enter the social layer in crypto, like Scammers and Grifters, so you have to have some resistance against them.
01:34:38.262 - 01:34:49.306, Speaker B: That said, David, I think protocols like Bitcoin, projects like Bitcoin can develop an unhealthy immune system, call it immune system disorder, where the white blood cells just attack everything.
01:34:49.408 - 01:34:50.182, Speaker A: Autoimmunity.
01:34:50.246 - 01:34:55.994, Speaker B: Yeah, and that's a big problem. An autoimmune disorder? Is that what you meant here?
01:34:56.192 - 01:35:26.678, Speaker A: I wasn't talking about the autoimmunity. But yes, the natural like all blockchains are illegitimate on day one, and they slowly become legitimate over time. And I'll kind of give, like, if you are a single cycle blockchain, you have not yet earned your stripes. You only earn your stripes by coming out of the inevitable bear market that you're going to go through and proving to the crypto world that you are able to make it through a bear market. Because if you haven't made it through a bear market, you're not legitimate in.
01:35:26.684 - 01:35:29.366, Speaker B: My mind, David, you know, I apply this to people now too.
01:35:29.468 - 01:35:31.240, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good take.
01:35:33.850 - 01:35:40.374, Speaker B: Does this sound bad? Like, I don't trust people who haven't been through a cycle in crypto who.
01:35:40.412 - 01:36:05.706, Speaker A: Didn'T make it through one single cycle in crypto in their last cycle. 3 hours capital, made all their money starting in 2019 and 2020 and then reaped it all, like just harvested so much in 2021 and then came crashing down in 2022. FTX was not here last cycle came crashing down in 2022. Terra Luna, a single cycle blockchain did not it crashed in April of 2022. It didn't even make it halfway.
01:36:05.818 - 01:36:16.130, Speaker B: Don't trust the single cyclers. Single cycle. And not to say that if you're a single cycler, you're sharing that and you're like, well, they're elitist. No, you can become you have to stay here for a while.
01:36:16.200 - 01:36:17.982, Speaker A: You have to prove your stripes.
01:36:18.126 - 01:36:29.026, Speaker B: Proof in time. Legitimacy is only gained by proof and time. That's what you said here. I apply that to people too. I apply that to projects, I apply it to exchanges. It's why we like working with Kraken. It's why we like other exchanges, like Coinbase.
01:36:29.058 - 01:36:34.038, Speaker A: How many cycles has Kraken been long? Literally all of them, every single cycle.
01:36:34.134 - 01:36:42.794, Speaker B: They haven't gone insolvent yet. I mean, that's like Lindy effect, so I agree with that take David and just I would apply it to people too.
01:36:42.912 - 01:36:44.826, Speaker A: All right, I guess we're just reading our own tweets.
01:36:44.858 - 01:36:52.954, Speaker B: Speaking of people, this section has become read our own tweets. Well, why don't you read it? So it's not that this guy ryan.
01:36:53.002 - 01:37:05.730, Speaker A: Sean Adams tweets out. Not everyone's opinion on crypto is valuable. A lot of smart people in other areas have absolutely no idea what they're talking about when it comes to crypto. Don't listen to them. Man are we doing elitist takes this week or what?
01:37:05.800 - 01:37:36.158, Speaker B: David I got fooled by this in my early days. I thought, if you're an expert in something, then you must know what you're talking about with crypto. It took me a while, honestly, in my crypto journey to start trusting my own instincts and my own opinions. But I've definitely come to that place. I hope I don't overcorrect and be like, I know freaking and, like, there's there's obviously that failure. I mean, I was looking at this last week right after the last roll up. Charlie Munger, notable investor, I've admired this guy.
01:37:36.158 - 01:38:13.942, Speaker B: His investment takes. He's like a Warren Buffett type, wrote an opinion commentary why America should ban crypto. It isn't currency. It's a gambling contract with a nearly 100% edge for the house. He goes on, Charlie talks about the government of China, the Communist government of China actually doing the right thing in banning cryptocurrencies because they wisely concluded that they would provide more harm than benefit. He thinks the Chinese Communist leaders had splendid common sense. He says, Obviously the US should now enact new federal laws that prevents crypto from he's calling for a ban on crypto.
01:38:13.942 - 01:38:46.446, Speaker B: And do you know what, David? This guy's opinion doesn't matter at all. Just because he's an expert in other domains, maybe in stocks, maybe that sort of investing that he knows about. He knows nothing about what we're trying to do here and about the crypto movement or about these assets. He knows absolutely nothing about it. And so if you're hearing his opinion, you're going like, well, what does Charlie Munger think? Or some notable economist with a Nobel Prize, Warren Buffett.
01:38:46.478 - 01:38:48.706, Speaker A: It's like bitcoin is trash.
01:38:48.818 - 01:39:06.700, Speaker B: Have they used uniswap? Have they looked into the fundamentals behind DeFi protocols? Do they understand why ethereum is worth greater than $0? Do they understand why Bitcoin is worth greater than $0? If they don't if they can't answer those questions, don't listen to them.
01:39:07.790 - 01:39:17.406, Speaker A: Have they been through a crypto cycle? No, they haven't even started. Yeah. My first introduction to this was John Feffer. You know John Feffer, right?
01:39:17.428 - 01:39:18.426, Speaker B: I remember john Feffer.
01:39:18.458 - 01:39:27.450, Speaker A: Yeah. He wrote this paper about how ethereum ether the velocity of ether is too high to be treated as a currency because it's all gas.
01:39:27.530 - 01:39:28.578, Speaker B: We never accrue value.
01:39:28.664 - 01:39:51.370, Speaker A: Never would accrue value. And when I read that, I took that personally. And that is one of the main motivations when I was reading that paper, to develop the triple point asset thesis, which is one of the earliest bankless thesis about how Ether knows it not just this velocity gas coin. It is actually the world's greatest monetary asset that humans have ever produced.
01:39:51.950 - 01:39:57.034, Speaker B: Same here. But if you remember reading that paper, he was very persuasive, wasn't he?
01:39:57.232 - 01:40:01.098, Speaker A: Oh, no, I thought I didn't believe it at all. I was like, this doesn't make any sense.
01:40:01.184 - 01:40:14.718, Speaker B: It didn't make sense to me. But also I was like, but he's a seasoned investor. Yes, and listen to these arguments. Listen, like the white paper and the language surrounding it and the expertise and the credentialism flowing out of it.
01:40:14.804 - 01:40:31.814, Speaker A: Dude, this is where I personally got over, like impostor syndrome, where I was like, this doesn't make any sense. I'm going to write a thesis that counterargues this. And I'm just a no one, but I have differing ideas and I think I'm right. And then I think I have been proven right.
01:40:31.932 - 01:40:41.386, Speaker B: Yeah, well, guess the only reason you've actually earned some legitimacy, David, is proof and time. Because legitimacy is only gained it by proof and time.
01:40:41.488 - 01:40:42.298, Speaker A: Thank you, sir.
01:40:42.384 - 01:40:43.994, Speaker B: So it takes some time.
01:40:44.192 - 01:40:46.326, Speaker A: Do you know the Planck principle?
01:40:46.438 - 01:40:47.850, Speaker B: What's? The plank principle.
01:40:48.350 - 01:40:54.590, Speaker A: It's really savage. It's paraphrases. A society progresses one funeral at a time.
01:40:54.740 - 01:41:03.474, Speaker B: Well, this is very much true of science. Isn't this what people say about science? Right? Science is clinging to old ideas and new generation has to totally disrupt it.
01:41:03.512 - 01:41:16.578, Speaker A: Yeah, like Munger, Buffett, all of these very old, older than boomer era people are like, crypto is bad. Well, yeah, you also missed the tech boom Warren Buffett, so I'm not listening to you.
01:41:16.664 - 01:41:20.934, Speaker B: Yeah, well, someday we will be there, David. And when that day comes, no longer.
01:41:20.972 - 01:41:25.062, Speaker A: Listen to us, there will be some younger generation talking about how dumb we are.
01:41:25.116 - 01:41:33.514, Speaker B: I'm hoping. I'm trying to preserve this open mindedness as I get older, maybe preserve some of that wisdom. David, what makes you bullish this week?
01:41:33.712 - 01:42:12.038, Speaker A: Well, we went through all of what was going on in ship season, and I had this take last week. Markets are being resistant to bad news. And even though we are down on the week, we are down to 1620 Ether price and $22,000 bitcoin price, we're still up pretty damn good on the year. We started the year at like eleven or one $200 Ether. And we had this bad, bad choke point news, which does threaten very much how this crypto world works. We've only dumped a little bit, dumped two and a half percent since that news came out. So I'm calling that still resistant to bad news.
01:42:12.038 - 01:42:52.466, Speaker A: And I think, Ryan, if crypto prices and tokens bounce back from this and go back into the Ta that I was talking about at the very beginning, which we don't usually do, and we go back up to the high 16 hundreds, maybe one seven hundreds, that is the market shrugging off bad news and being very perceptive to bullish news. So that makes me bullish. If we can shrug this off. That's so awesome. And 2023 shipping so far has been like an order of magnitude greater than what we saw in 2019. And so just what is being built right now, the fundamentals that D Five protocols are going through is so bullish, man. This is what 2019 felt like.
01:42:52.466 - 01:43:04.022, Speaker A: It's like you are watching the fundamentals grow at an accelerating pace around you. Meanwhile, just like everyone else that's not in crypto is not paying attention anymore. That's what I'm bullish on.
01:43:04.076 - 01:43:10.626, Speaker B: I agree. I would say I probably got nothing to add to that because that was also my take.
01:43:10.668 - 01:43:13.466, Speaker A: It's ship season. I have the ability to rug your.
01:43:13.568 - 01:43:37.010, Speaker B: I know, because you go first. But yeah, we're in this bear market. But it's hard not to get bullish when you see the ship season, when you see all the shipping. And you're right, this does smell like 2019, except ten X. All the building that was going on in 2019. This is just so much bigger, right? The Arbitrum multi language support compiled the EVM. This is so big for developers, the.
01:43:37.080 - 01:43:47.390, Speaker A: Optimist sorry we didn't say this earlier, but when Arbitrum develops stylus like their EVM equivalent, that extends to the rest of Ethereum, I know other people can take this and run with it's.
01:43:47.390 - 01:44:01.526, Speaker B: Not just Arbitrum optimistic, like the Op stack with bedrock that's coming too. That's going to launch. Dude, all of this stuff is happening now for builders. And we've got Zke EVMs right around the corner.
01:44:01.638 - 01:44:06.678, Speaker A: The apps are shipping was so bullish. Everything's so bullish.
01:44:06.854 - 01:44:24.062, Speaker B: I mean, the building right and it's not reflecting in price right now, but it is a little bit. So I don't know about your earlier take. I don't know if I read the Ta right. It could go up, it could go down, who knows? But it's build season, man, and it's huge. We've come so far.
01:44:24.116 - 01:44:24.702, Speaker A: Feels great.
01:44:24.756 - 01:44:25.522, Speaker B: That's it. All right.
01:44:25.576 - 01:44:50.874, Speaker A: Meme of the Week before meme of the Week. I remember Luke, the editor who's editing this right now, gave us when it was officially the bear market. Like, this was after three Zero's capital collapsed. Luke was like, you and Ryan are like giddy about the bear market. You guys are so excited. And it's because of moments of the shipping that has happened in the last, like, since 2023 started. It's because stuff like this happens.
01:44:50.874 - 01:44:59.626, Speaker A: Like, progress happens. And this signal about progress is so clear because the noise is all gone. We don't have looking forward to we.
01:44:59.648 - 01:45:11.230, Speaker B: Don'T have to wave our hands around and be like, stop, ignore this. Look at this. It's just very clear now, I think we'll go months into this and we'll be like, oh, I'm hungry for a bull market.
01:45:11.380 - 01:45:14.670, Speaker A: Can the tokens move? That's partially why tokens are moving, though.
01:45:14.740 - 01:45:22.658, Speaker B: I know. That's why. It's just like, this is happening so quickly. I don't feel like we've embraced enough pain yet. But anyway, we'll see meme of the week. David, what are we looking at here?
01:45:22.744 - 01:45:38.230, Speaker A: Meme of the week. We actually got two memes of the week. So this is some guy who's doing his one phone call out of jail and somebody in the background saying, hey, man, what are you in for? And the guy who's given the phone call says, I staked ETH with Rocket Pole and now I have life sentences with no parole.
01:45:39.290 - 01:45:40.042, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
01:45:40.096 - 01:45:41.622, Speaker A: It's funny, but it's also scary.
01:45:41.686 - 01:45:42.138, Speaker B: I know.
01:45:42.224 - 01:45:55.950, Speaker A: Second meme. This was Ryan's meme. Nice job, Ryan. This is bitcoiners. When they discover NFTs and what we are looking at is what looks like a retirement home. And I think I'm pretty sure this is physical therapy. This is like physical therapy.
01:45:55.950 - 01:46:02.878, Speaker A: Gamified physical therapy. So they're playing all these fun games, but they're just like just puttering along.
01:46:03.044 - 01:46:11.246, Speaker B: Do you know what? Honestly, I've never seen some elements of the bitcoin community so happy with NFTs. Like other elements. They love it. Rage.
01:46:11.358 - 01:46:13.378, Speaker A: Everyone loves NFTs they do.
01:46:13.464 - 01:46:25.698, Speaker B: They do. That's why this video reminded me of the good parts of the bitcoin community. That's it. That's the show today. Thanks for hanging with us. Extra long one, but I hope you enjoyed it. A lot of news to download during ship season.
01:46:25.698 - 01:46:36.950, Speaker B: Risks and disclaimers. Got to let you know, crypto is risky, so is DeFi. So is ethereum. So is bitcoin. All this stuff is you definitely lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier.
01:46:36.950 - 01:46:41.578, Speaker B: It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
