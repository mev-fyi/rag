00:00:00.170 - 00:00:47.654, Speaker A: And they're saying, why can't everyone in Crypto be compliant like us? They don't even have a product that anyone's using or works. And meanwhile, David, you have Kraken, you have Coinbase, actual companies demanded by the market. Actual companies have been in the space servicing people in the crypto industry and protecting investors, giving them exposure to this asset class for over a decade. American based companies, pristine reputations, and the SEC is busy sending them Wells notices, and somehow this guy gets in front of Congress. It just seems a little OD, doesn't it? Bankless Nation. It is the third Friday of June, and it's Friday morning. I said that twice.
00:00:47.654 - 00:00:48.794, Speaker A: David, what time is it?
00:00:48.832 - 00:00:58.126, Speaker B: It's bankless Friday weekly roll up. Ryan. We're doing the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, which is why I'm on my third coffee. How are you doing?
00:00:58.228 - 00:01:07.154, Speaker A: I drank a pot this morning, so I haven't gone to the second pot yet. Just a pot can be a different size. This is probably like a pot is.
00:01:07.192 - 00:01:26.546, Speaker B: Unequivocally a large that's a lot of copy. All right, topics of the week, uniswap V Four. We actually have some crypto news this week. So we got Uniswap V Four announced this week and why I'm calling it the Hook Centric Roadmap. Hook centric roadmap. Yes, david forcing it. I am forcing the topic.
00:01:26.578 - 00:01:27.334, Speaker A: All right?
00:01:27.532 - 00:01:54.122, Speaker B: And while I'm very, very happy that all this crypto news has happened, in addition to Uniswap, we have Eigen Layer going live. We have the Polygon Roadmap update, we have BlackRock that wants a bitcoin ETF. These are all give me more great news. And half of this goddamn weekly roll up is going to be dedicated to the SEC shenanigans, which I'm sad to say, but they were extra shenanigan y this week. Shenanigan. E is putting it lightly.
00:01:54.186 - 00:02:19.914, Speaker A: We love you, SEC. I don't know what's going on, man, but it seemed like the SEC may have put a Fed plant in front of Congress. All right, that sounds like conspiracy tinfoil hat stuff, but we're going to drop the details on that and you guys can decide for yourself what is going on. Also, the Heinman emails were released. This is the Ripple case. It kind of exposes the SEC was sort of two faced with respect to its stance on whether ETH is a security or not.
00:02:20.032 - 00:02:33.878, Speaker B: It really undermines the SEC's current words with the SEC's previous words. The court ordered the SEC to not edit or change anything about its historical statements out of fear that it might do that.
00:02:33.984 - 00:02:39.054, Speaker A: The fact that you have to say that as the court right, right. Wow. Okay. We got some shenanigans to deal with.
00:02:39.092 - 00:02:57.262, Speaker B: But lots of shenanigans. And also, Warren Davidson is fed up with the SEC's shenanigans, and he has proposed the SEC Stabilization Act, aka hashtag Fire Gary Gensler, and completely rebuild the SEC. That was his hashtag fire. Gary Gensler.
00:02:57.326 - 00:03:02.262, Speaker A: Fire Gary Gensler. Wow. It sounds like something you would tweet out, David, not me, of course.
00:03:02.316 - 00:03:05.522, Speaker B: I've tweeted out a little bit worse than that. I still want Gary in the agenda.
00:03:05.586 - 00:03:07.090, Speaker A: I still want Gary on this podcast.
00:03:07.170 - 00:03:09.438, Speaker B: Okay, he's not coming on this podcast.
00:03:09.474 - 00:03:15.382, Speaker A: I would welcome him, though, and I know you would, too. We would have a productive conversation. Gary Gensler, if you're listening, come on the podcast.
00:03:15.446 - 00:03:21.162, Speaker B: We would talk a little bit, have a productive word for him to hear. I don't know if we'd get them back.
00:03:21.216 - 00:03:56.534, Speaker A: Anyways, speaking of productive, you know what's really productive is having a smart contract with good security, making sure it's audited. Our friends and sponsors at Cypherin want to let you know that they are some world class smart contract auditors. Okay? So if you're building a protocol, cyphern wants to make sure your code is secure and using the most modern tooling and best practices available. You know Patrick from the Cypher team, he's a YouTube content creator, too, where he talks about solidity blockchain development and smart contracts. This is a lot of views on this content. All right.
00:03:56.572 - 00:04:28.222, Speaker B: Yeah, he's been doing this for apparently, like, five, three years every year. He's released a course every single year with a combined 5 million views, which, I mean 5 million views. Isn't that's crazy? That 5 million views of onboarding solidity devs into web3. That's a lot of onboarding work. And so, not only can Cypher audit your smart contract, it can also teach you how to be a good, secure, solidity dev. Because if you have 27 hours, this bear market, because I'm sure you do that's why we call it the boar market. You can go from zero to 60 using Cypher.
00:04:28.366 - 00:04:32.990, Speaker A: There you go. Well, speaking of education, why don't you educate us on the crypto markets today, David?
00:04:33.150 - 00:04:35.102, Speaker B: It's a bad start with Bitcoin.
00:04:35.246 - 00:04:36.030, Speaker A: Bad lesson.
00:04:36.110 - 00:04:52.682, Speaker B: Yes, things go down. Everything things go down. The color is red, blood in the streets. Bitcoin started the week at $26,700, down six and a half percent, down to $25,000. Bitcoin down 6.5% is not great. That's not great.
00:04:52.736 - 00:04:53.558, Speaker A: I've seen worse.
00:04:53.654 - 00:05:00.300, Speaker B: Ether down almost double now. That starting the week at 1850, ending the week at 1650.
00:05:00.750 - 00:05:02.618, Speaker A: I do not like double digit is.
00:05:02.624 - 00:05:03.274, Speaker B: Where we are right now.
00:05:03.312 - 00:05:05.598, Speaker A: Double digit percentage down feels bad.
00:05:05.684 - 00:05:14.434, Speaker B: Not great. Not great. Yeah. The ratio, of course, takes a beating. Down 5.5%. That would say a lot for the ratio. Tell me, why is the ratio down?
00:05:14.472 - 00:05:18.500, Speaker A: No, why are we dropping? Like, what happened this week?
00:05:19.110 - 00:05:53.690, Speaker B: I totally think that this price action could have totally happened in a vacuum. We were talking about that mid bear market high that we have recently been to. That kind of matches where we were in 2019, if you're into that kind of voodoo stuff. And then also at the same time, Gary Gensler told us that basically crypto assets three through 15 on the crypto market cap are all securities. And so I think that has also set in as well. The mood is bad, and then things become real. When the price dropped.
00:05:53.690 - 00:06:23.702, Speaker B: I remember talking to you about this. Remember in March of 2020, early March, everyone was talking about COVID but no one was taking it seriously. And then the COVID dump day happened and like, the Trad market dumped. Crypto markets dumped, and then everyone started taking COVID extremely seriously after the markets reacted. I think that's kind of what's happening with the crypto securities is like, for the first couple days, it was like, oh, Gary, just sue in Coinbase and Binance. And now we're like, we're going to fight back. We're going to fight back.
00:06:23.702 - 00:06:28.438, Speaker B: Yeah. And now I'm like, oh, shit, this is going to be bad. I think that's what that was.
00:06:28.524 - 00:06:50.398, Speaker A: I mean, it could take a while for the US. To turn course on this. This is doing some damage, I would say, in crypto right now. So I think you might be right about that. It's the market sort of realizing, coming to terms with the fact that the US regulatory environment might look ugly for some time. We're still above a trillion, though, in terms of market cap.
00:06:50.484 - 00:06:53.090, Speaker B: So there's that 1.5.
00:06:53.240 - 00:07:12.822, Speaker A: David, should we go down market a little bit and take a look at the other assets besides bitcoin and ether? So this is one of my favorite. It's not a chart exactly, but kind of like a metric to look at percent down from all time high, just to recap where we are, just to.
00:07:12.876 - 00:07:15.926, Speaker B: Really just be masochistic, just because we.
00:07:15.948 - 00:07:30.138, Speaker A: Want to hate ourselves this week for just a second. And we'll bring some hope near the end of this episode. Bitcoin price down from all time high, about 64%. Ether price down 66%. By the way, those on themselves, not too bad.
00:07:30.224 - 00:07:35.338, Speaker B: Those could be worse. And they have been worse, which is insane to say. 66 not that bad.
00:07:35.424 - 00:07:51.220, Speaker A: It's not that bad. I mean, this just feels like a flesh wound to me. But then we go down market and we look at some of the non ETH, non bitcoin tokens. XRP down 85%. Interestingly, up 30% on, I believe, I don't know, the day or something.
00:07:51.830 - 00:07:52.818, Speaker B: To year to date.
00:07:52.904 - 00:08:09.782, Speaker A: Year to date. Okay, that's year to date. So up on the year, which is interesting, but down 85%. Cardano down 91%. Dogecoin down 91%. Salana down 94%. Polka dot down 92% there's definitely some pain down market.
00:08:09.782 - 00:08:23.454, Speaker A: You even get to some of the D Five blue chips, uniswap down 90%. Wow. Still a lot of pain, a lot of blood in this market, particularly when you get outside of bitcoin and ether. Yeah.
00:08:23.492 - 00:08:35.902, Speaker B: The altcoin market cap has been absolutely pummeled. Holding our alts in a bear market has proved to be very dangerous, and that was before Gary deemed them to be securities. So here we are.
00:08:36.036 - 00:08:36.858, Speaker A: Thanks, Gary.
00:08:36.954 - 00:08:44.446, Speaker B: Thanks, Gary. Thanks, Gary. I've so know something we actually haven't talked about in a while that was in this news in the markets news this week. Ryan.
00:08:44.478 - 00:08:45.298, Speaker A: What's that?
00:08:45.464 - 00:08:51.442, Speaker B: Remember the word inflation? Oh, yeah. Remember the word raising or lowering or pausing interest rates?
00:08:51.506 - 00:08:51.878, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:51.964 - 00:08:53.350, Speaker B: Something happened this week. What happened?
00:08:53.420 - 00:09:03.190, Speaker A: The Fed had a announcement, basically. So the FOMC had their meeting, of course, where they tell us what they're going to do with interest rates. And you know what they did, David?
00:09:03.350 - 00:09:04.058, Speaker B: Tell me.
00:09:04.144 - 00:09:06.070, Speaker A: Nothing. They decided to skip.
00:09:06.150 - 00:09:09.626, Speaker B: But that's news. That's news that they decided to do nothing.
00:09:09.728 - 00:09:39.758, Speaker A: That is actually big news, that they decided to do nothing. This is kind of a skip the rate hike type of announcement, wait and see approach. They're holding at 5%. And the reason that's notable, that this breather is notable is this is the first time they haven't raised of the last ten times. So we've had ten consecutive increases that stretch all the way back to March 2022 when the Fed basically capitulated. At that point in time, they said.
00:09:39.864 - 00:09:41.842, Speaker B: Yeah, inflation, inflation is not transient.
00:09:41.906 - 00:10:14.782, Speaker A: It's a thing, it's not transient. It's getting out of hand. They had the previous summer, in summer of 2021, been saying don't worry about inflation, it's transient, don't worry about it. They had been kind of late to the game to start increasing rates, but then they did and they did so ten times, all the way up to 5%. And here we are, they're taking a break this particular time. And why? It's because the Fed says inflation appears to be easing and they want to assess whether they've already raised enough. And I will say inflation is at about 4% at this point in time.
00:10:14.782 - 00:10:16.498, Speaker A: So it's definitely off of the high.
00:10:16.584 - 00:10:18.018, Speaker B: Seems low, actually.
00:10:18.184 - 00:10:23.886, Speaker A: That's a low number, things considered. Look at this chart, david, what are you seeing in this chart here? This is CPI.
00:10:24.078 - 00:10:57.358, Speaker B: Yeah, I am seeing a chart come down to what was previously considered high, but in recent terms can now be considered very low. In 2022, inflation got up to 9%. In previous years, 2017, it gets to 3%. In late 2018, it gets to 3% again, it almost gets back to 3% at the start of 2020. And now we're down to 4%. And so it feels like we are in range of historic levels and we are down from 9%. So it looks good.
00:10:57.524 - 00:11:31.782, Speaker A: It is a trailing indicator, so let's remember that. Okay, this is all kind of past data, so we're not looking at kind of the current month inflation, but yeah, annualized at 4%, not too bad. Now keep in mind the Fed's target is 2%. So the Fed is basically saying, yeah, it's a wait and see, but right now for this time, but we expect to continue raising rates later in the year. And I think the market kind of believes that. What's interesting about this is the stock market equities risk on type assets they don't really know. I feel like they're in this undecided territory.
00:11:31.782 - 00:11:47.934, Speaker A: Is it like a bull? Is it a bear? We don't know. And so on this news, you'd think a pause would be good news for stocks. Stocks traded like a little up, but basically flat. I think the market is trying to figure out what's going to happen next and hasn't quite decided on that yet.
00:11:48.052 - 00:12:13.190, Speaker B: I wonder if the Trad markets forgot. I mean, I'm just speaking for myself. I've completely forgot about this whole inflation interest rate phenomenon for the last quarter. This is once again like, oh yeah. Have you forgotten about the bank? Do you remember those? I do remember those. That was almost a quarter ago, it seems like, but yeah, SEC has just completely dominated that. I wonder if the trades are hanging on tooth and nail to inflation like we once were.
00:12:13.190 - 00:12:15.830, Speaker B: It just doesn't feel like people care anymore.
00:12:16.330 - 00:12:16.838, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:16.924 - 00:12:18.102, Speaker B: Am I being naive here?
00:12:18.156 - 00:12:29.340, Speaker A: I don't know. We've got a lot of interesting indicators in the economy right now. So we've got inflation that's about 4%. Unemployment actually isn't so bad right now. 3.7% at this point in time. Right.
00:12:29.340 - 00:12:41.310, Speaker A: We haven't seen kind of the unemployment that you might see if we're creeping toward a recession. That said, there's just some weirdness in the market. I mean, go ask a millennial about.
00:12:41.380 - 00:12:43.054, Speaker B: Who'S trying to buy a house, how.
00:12:43.092 - 00:12:56.462, Speaker A: They feel about the current economy. Not too good. And so there's a lot of weirdness going on and I think the market's just trying to figure out where this is going. So that's the fed David, what do we got to talk about in the rest of this episode?
00:12:56.606 - 00:13:23.446, Speaker B: Oh my God. So we're going to probably have to prepare the bankless nation for like 30 plus minutes of SEC shenanigans. It's a lot of shenanigans. There's a lot of shenanigans. Like we said, there's the Hinman emails. There's this Walmart SBF person that SEC loves to parade in front of Congress, allegedly. So who the hell is Aaron Kaplan in Prometheum? And then the SEC also wants 120 days to respond to Coinbase.
00:13:23.446 - 00:13:51.810, Speaker B: We got the responses from Polygon and Salana about being a security or not. Surprise, they don't think they're a security. All of these things and more, including the SEC Stabilization Act, where we're going to try and fire you, Gary Gensler, all of this and more. But first, a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible, especially Kraken, our preferred exchange for 2023, the one that you see all the beautiful charts for while we go through the prices.

00:14:23.812 - 00:14:24.350, Speaker A: Today.
00:14:24.500 - 00:15:06.234, Speaker B: Mantle is a brand new high performance ethereum L2 network built differently from the other L2s you may be familiar with. Mantle is a modular L2 built on the Op stack, but uses eigen layer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer one. Not only does this reduce Mantle's gas fees by 80% compared to other L2 s, but it also reduces gas fee volatility. Mantle has a decentralized sequencer set, eliminating the risk of downtime and censorship on the network. And because Mantle implements multiparty computation nodes, layer one settlement execution is shortened from seven days to as low as just one or two. Mantle is the first L2 built by a dow and is backed by one of the biggest dow treasuries in the world. Bitdao.
00:15:06.234 - 00:15:22.894, Speaker B: Mantle already has subcommunities from around web3 onboarded to help the growth of Mantle, like Game Seven for Web Three gaming or Dao for the world of DSI and Bybit for TVL Liquidity and Onramps. Check out Mantle at Mantle XYZ and follow them on Twitter at zero xmantle.
00:15:23.022 - 00:15:44.042, Speaker A: Alright guys, the SEC shenanigans. We're going to go through them. The first one one of the most bizarre things I've seen in crypto. It's kind of inexplicable and not exactly sure what is going on, but let's go through some facts. This is, I guess, a take from me of what it looks like. I'm not saying this is what it is because we don't know if it's a good summary. This is what it looks like.
00:15:44.042 - 00:16:15.154, Speaker A: I think Gensler and Warren's anti crypto army may have actually rubber stamped a shitty ATS quasi Scam alt one in order to hold up to Congress as an example of a compliant crypto exchange, but the work quality here is 2017 era ICO Scam laughable. That's what I tweeted and I said this has got to be rock bottom. David, this Tweet thread from Matt Walsh gets into the story. It's almost an investigative journalist type story. And what I mean, if this is true, if this is what it looks like, I think this is rock bottom.
00:16:15.272 - 00:16:19.234, Speaker B: For the not be a real story.
00:16:19.352 - 00:16:25.110, Speaker A: All right, let's get into it. So this is Matt Walsh in the Tweet thread. Do you want to kick this off for us?
00:16:25.260 - 00:17:22.226, Speaker B: Yeah. So Matt Walsh, I remember him actually talking about this on his on the Brink podcast that he does with Nick Carter every last week. So he was talking about how weird this was last week, and then apparently since then, it's gotten even weirder, which is how he starts this Tweet thread. He goes, has anyone actually looked into this beyond bizarre? Last month, in the midst of the SEC bringing cases on Coinbase and Gemini and giving the stiff arm to Robinhood and others, prometheum gets approval for a first of its kind special purpose broker dealer for Digital Asset securities. Then Prometheum CEO somehow gets a seat in front of Congress yesterday and starts reading off pre written notes, clearly coordinated narratives with Democratic members of Congress or the SEC. And so if you click into this, we won't play this clip because it's like a long clip, but there is a section where a Democratic member of Congress, Ms. Velazquez, is asking questions that you like.
00:17:22.226 - 00:17:53.406, Speaker B: This is pretty common, I think, where staffers will underhand questions to the Congressman or woman. This Congresswoman clearly does not understand the question. She is just reading the question. And you can tell because crypto people know when you are not talking crypto language. That's very obvious. And so she has this scripted question, which she asks Adam, the CEO of Prometheum, and then as soon as the question ends, he looks down at his notes and gives a very scripted answer. Let's just play the whole thing is scripted here's.
00:17:53.438 - 00:17:55.714, Speaker A: The answer from Aaron System is the.
00:17:55.752 - 00:18:24.510, Speaker B: Separation of banking and commercial activity. The Republican led stablecoin legislation we are discussing here today seems to fail to recognize this separation for stablecoin issuers. This would allow noncommercial businesses to own a stablecoin issuer. Can you explain the harm to both consumers and perhaps financial stability that could arise from failing to clearly define this separation?
00:18:25.250 - 00:18:50.386, Speaker C: Consolidation of consumer and banking activities? Can reading from his notes, conflicts of interest and potential systemic risk. Essentially, potential systemic a lack of strong frameworks for properly regulatory oversight for the entities involved, particularly when they're commingling consumer and I know these words activities presents additional levels of conflict and potential exposure to the underlying customers, either on the.
00:18:50.408 - 00:18:52.058, Speaker D: Consumer side or thank you, Mr. Cavill.
00:18:52.094 - 00:19:00.982, Speaker B: Gentlewoman man. God, that is so cringe. And it just sounds like it's like Gary Gensler's son giving these words.
00:19:01.036 - 00:19:03.714, Speaker A: It's definitely part of the Gary Gensler fan club.
00:19:03.762 - 00:19:04.354, Speaker B: Dump speech.
00:19:04.402 - 00:19:10.542, Speaker A: Yes, dump speech. And there's some interesting conflicts of interest here. You should go on with Matt Walsh's thread here.
00:19:10.676 - 00:19:46.998, Speaker B: Okay, so Matt Wallace goes, as Rodrigo points out, rodrigo does legal and policy at Paradigm. This ATS will absolutely not work unless the projects first register the tokens with the SEC. And there are no tokens currently registered with the SEC because the regime is not viable for public blockchain. So you know how Gary Gensler is always like, some projects have come in and registered. Why not the rest of the industry? Some have done it all bad actors, and some people have come in and registered right it's totally possible because some people have done it. Apparently it's this prometheum thing. Come in and done it.
00:19:46.998 - 00:20:21.746, Speaker B: Right. And so Prometheum is like, okay, now that Gary Gensler and the SEC has deemed Solana and Matic and Filecoin and XRP to be securities, great. We have this alt layer one ATS Blockchain Exchange for you to trade your crypto securities on in a compliant manner. The point is that Solana, Polygon, they don't want to trade on these platforms because they are decentralized global crypto networks. And they can't do that because that is against the whole entire point of the whole entire thing.
00:20:21.768 - 00:20:46.982, Speaker A: We're doing an ATS. So what is an ATS? This was kind of an idea that was very much popularized in 2017. It's interesting, we'll get to this part of the story, but this Prometheum thing seems like a 2017 era, like almost ICO token launch. It's certainly a narrative and it has its roots there, which we'll get to in a second. But could you define what an ATS is for people who haven't ever heard that term?
00:20:47.126 - 00:21:27.030, Speaker B: Yeah, so this actually goes back to the world that I was in in 2018. I worked for a security token company. So we were trying to figure out how to issue security tokens. How do you do that? You do your token issuance and trading on an ATS, an alternative trading system, which is a thing that exists before Crypto, inside of crypto. And then once everyone realized that the ICO mania was actually selling on registered securities, every ICO agency stopped and started pivoting to a security token company because we were selling on registered securities. And so there became this rush, this gold rush towards ATSs. So, like T Zero was one of these startups.
00:21:27.030 - 00:21:32.858, Speaker B: I can't remember all of them. I wrote blog posts about this. There was like five or six startups. I had to do market research.
00:21:32.944 - 00:21:34.778, Speaker A: No product market fit for any of these.
00:21:34.864 - 00:21:39.114, Speaker B: No, right. Because everyone wanted to issue their tokens in a decentralized public way.
00:21:39.152 - 00:21:41.854, Speaker A: But also because an ATS system, right.
00:21:42.052 - 00:21:44.922, Speaker B: It's walled garden. It's KYC.
00:21:45.066 - 00:22:06.674, Speaker A: Not only KYC. Also it's accredited investor law. So if it's not a publicly traded company, that would be trading the S P or Nasdaq. Right. If it's kind of like some sort of private placement, then you have accredited investor. It's basically you have to have over a million dollars net worth in order to actually access this stuff and use it. It's just a very small niche market that nobody wants.
00:22:06.674 - 00:22:08.898, Speaker A: Nobody's going to use it's. The reason it's never taken on, no.
00:22:08.904 - 00:22:09.894, Speaker B: One in crypto wants this.
00:22:09.932 - 00:22:38.858, Speaker A: But here's this guy who's like I came in with, Gary Gensler, I met in his office, like, he's inviting everyone and I get my ATS license and we are a compliant exchange. And the rest of Crypto is non compliant. You should just do what I did. And it seems like it is a plant. It seems like it really does. It seems like this guy works for the Fed in some capacity or has some hidden incentive here because this project is so bizarre.
00:22:39.034 - 00:22:43.294, Speaker B: This guy looks like a can we go to the Laura Shin clip and play that clip?
00:22:43.342 - 00:22:43.506, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:43.528 - 00:22:47.490, Speaker B: Okay. This guy looks like an oiled slicked back suit.
00:22:48.710 - 00:22:51.374, Speaker A: This is from a podcast that Laurishan.
00:22:51.422 - 00:22:52.014, Speaker B: Laurish.
00:22:52.142 - 00:22:53.230, Speaker A: Aaron Kaplan.
00:22:53.310 - 00:23:20.534, Speaker C: I believe that since the ICO in 2015, ethereum has been an investment contract and there is no legal precedent where a security, meaning an investment contract that therefore is a security morphs into a non security. There's been sort of ideas of sufficiently decentralized posited out there, but they're not really based in legal precedent. So once a security, always a security under know legal precedent.
00:23:20.582 - 00:23:21.558, Speaker B: Legal precedent.
00:23:21.654 - 00:23:36.146, Speaker C: And as such, while we're not announcing anything at this current time, here it is. As Chairman Gensler has noted, and I'll sound like a broken record, the overwhelming majority of digital assets, basically everything besides for Bitcoin, is an investment contract and therefore security.
00:23:36.248 - 00:23:39.470, Speaker B: The whole point about crypto is that it is unprecedented.
00:23:39.630 - 00:24:12.614, Speaker A: I think that applying laws from 1933 and 1934, before the stapler was invented, to this new asset class in digital assets to cryptocurrency is unworkable. It doesn't work. And Aaron Kaplan is not admitting that. So basically, the things he said with Laura Shin on her podcast, he reiterated the exact same thing in front of Congress. He said gensler is right. Basically, the SEC is right. Crypto securities laws are already clear.
00:24:12.614 - 00:24:30.382, Speaker A: We don't need new laws. Everything but Bitcoin is a security. It's possible to be a compliant exchange. Just look at Prometheum and all the success that we've had being a compliant know, if it was just that, that would be weird enough. It doesn't end there, though, David.
00:24:30.526 - 00:24:33.406, Speaker B: That is one half of the story. That is the tip of the iceberg.
00:24:33.438 - 00:24:43.574, Speaker A: Okay, so it gets even more interesting. Remember you were talking about the 2017 narrative around the gold is very short.
00:24:43.612 - 00:24:46.466, Speaker B: Lived gold rush for ATS crypto ATSs.
00:24:46.658 - 00:25:26.338, Speaker A: Apparently Prometheum actually got their start right there in 2017. They got their Reg A plus license. They aim to raise $50 million there. So that's where Prometheum actually started. The reason it sounds like a 2017 ICO kind of scam narrative because it kind of was a little bit they were stacked, though, when it came to kind of former insiders government insiders, people from the New York Stock Exchange, people from FINRA, people from the Cboes, they're very plugged in. Oh, their COO from the SEC, that's quite interesting. And then what happened, David, is they went dormant for a period of time.
00:25:26.338 - 00:25:59.040, Speaker A: Okay? So they went silent for years until about even though they had this was their roadmap, is what they were planning to do. They had a Genesis block and everything. This was a court of blockchain ATS, of course. So you start in 2017. By 2019, you have your genesis block issued with your fantastic ATS system. All right, so they go quiet for a few years, and now they're suddenly back on the scene. It also turns out, David, they are funded by some very interesting companies.
00:25:59.040 - 00:26:02.510, Speaker A: What does this tweet from Adam Cochrane say?
00:26:02.580 - 00:26:22.694, Speaker B: Now, this is where Matt Walsh and Adam Cochrane turn into investigative journalists, and there's just a lot to unpack here. I'm not the one to do it, but I'll just summarize some of their findings. Their fundraise was done with this affiliate from China called Wang Zhang. Wang Zhang I'm sorry. I don't know how to pronounce this. A purported CCP affiliate. Okay, great.
00:26:22.694 - 00:27:00.814, Speaker B: So the ties to China, they raised $48 million without a product, hired former SEC and FINRA people. They paid $1.5 million to this thing called Network One Financial securities, which has a very dubious compliance record for people who care about these things. But the point is, the big thing about Network One Financial do you remember when Long Island Iced Tea, those beloved, like, iced teas, shout out D Five Dave, who always wears this shirt? In 2017, they changed their stock ticker and company name to Long Island Blockchain.
00:27:00.942 - 00:27:02.514, Speaker A: Just to pump the stock price.
00:27:02.632 - 00:27:05.742, Speaker B: Yeah. So that was actually done by Network One Financial.
00:27:05.806 - 00:27:06.798, Speaker A: Oh, interesting.
00:27:06.984 - 00:27:37.386, Speaker B: Yeah, the iced tea company. And then they also had another offering that was another blockchain pivot that the SEC charged for fraud. So being connected to these people, not great. And if you scroll up, you'll see, again, for people who care about compliance stuff, they have 23 disclosure events of things that just aren't great, like marks on their record. So it's just not pretty. There's not a cool so that's what's.
00:27:37.418 - 00:28:28.346, Speaker A: So weird about this, is suddenly they're just back and now in front of Congress. Back in front of Congress, and they're saying, we just got this ATS license, and they're simping for the SEC, and they're saying, why can't everyone in Crypto be compliant like us? They don't even have a product that anyone's using or works. And meanwhile, David, you have Kraken, you have Coinbase, actual companies demanded by the market. Companies have been in the space servicing people in the crypto industry and protecting investors, giving them exposure to this asset class for over a decade. American based companies, pristine reputations, and the SEC is busy sending them Wells notices, and somehow this guy gets in front of Congress. It just seems a little OD, doesn't.
00:28:28.458 - 00:28:57.270, Speaker B: Really it's just weird. It's just very weird. Adam Cochrane, I think, summed it up nicely with these three possible answers to why the hell this is happening. One, these are plants who have been given a sweet regulatory deal in exchange for engaging in the way the SEC wanted them to, just like how Gary was working with SPF. So there's precedent for that conclusion. Two, these guys are using their SEC and FINRA connections to push an agenda to get certain assets deemed. Securities for them to be the only approved player to capture the market bold.
00:28:57.270 - 00:29:07.154, Speaker B: And three, these guys are grifters who have been raising money from scratchy sources and for years have been twisting and will continue to grift. So aka they're grifters.
00:29:07.282 - 00:29:46.354, Speaker A: So either grifters I think it's all three of them, or plants and maybe it's some combination of all three. Very weird. Again, who knows, maybe the SEC, maybe Gensler had absolutely nothing to do with this. It just seems like something that the Elizabeth Warren anti crypto army is behind. I don't know why, it just seems weird. And on top of that, that is the first of a series of shenanigans that we've uncovered this week. Shenanigan number two, more hypocrisy talk about Hinman's emails.
00:29:46.354 - 00:29:47.878, Speaker A: David, what are we looking at here?
00:29:47.964 - 00:30:26.850, Speaker B: So this came out of the Ripple case. So Ripple has been in a fight with the SEC for a very long time. The SEC deemed Ripple to be a security forever ago. Exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken delisted Ripple because they're like, all right, we don't want to fight that fight. So Ripple has been having their own fight with the SEC as a part of that fight. A bunch of documents get released from the SEC that came from a famous speech that Bill Hinman in June of 2018 came and said, where he said Ether at the time of sale was perhaps a security. But in its current shape and form, when it is being traded on DEXes or being traded on Coinbase or Finance or wherever is not a security, then.
00:30:26.920 - 00:30:28.478, Speaker A: And who is Bill Hinman? Remind me.
00:30:28.504 - 00:31:02.638, Speaker B: Bill Hinman was a director of the SEC. He was an SEC official at the time in 2018. So this is an SEC person making this statement. Gary Gensler and the current SEC administration have said that Bill Hinman's statements were his actions as an individual, just his own personal opinions. His own personal opinions doesn't reflect the opinions of the SEC. And Bill Hinman said like perhaps the investment contract of Ether at the pre sale, perhaps that wasn't a security. But Ether as it currently stands being traded in the public market is not a security.
00:31:02.638 - 00:31:04.282, Speaker B: And so that was a statement from Bill Hinman.
00:31:04.346 - 00:31:05.850, Speaker A: Can I read his exact statement?
00:31:05.930 - 00:31:06.814, Speaker B: Sure, yeah.
00:31:06.932 - 00:31:40.294, Speaker A: Hinman said this and putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, again, this is 2018, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. That is the exact statement. So the crypto industry was very excited saying, hey, the SEC's finally given us clarity here's a very clear pre written script saying Ether is not a security in a speech from a senior SEC official. And you're saying what Gary Gensler and the SEC have since said is, oh no, that was just his personal opinion.
00:31:40.422 - 00:32:13.906, Speaker B: Exactly. And all of this is not from the documents from the Ripple case. Here's what was revealed from the Ripple case. So here's an email of SEC officials working together to come to consensus about what Bill Hinman ought to say. And so Bill Hinman put forth in the emails, put forth his speech that he will give, and he asked for comments from other SEC officials. And they say, as written, the language remains vague as to whether ETH is a security. If you want to make an affirmative statement that is not a security, the language could be stronger.
00:32:13.906 - 00:32:30.234, Speaker B: As in, just say it. If you don't want to take an affirmative stance, we suggest using language similar to what you use for Bitcoin. Read the disclosure regime to make it more consistent. And that's what one person said. Here's what a second person said. We thought you were going to say that you don't believe ETH is a security. We think that that message is a helpful message.
00:32:30.234 - 00:32:53.954, Speaker B: This statement, on the other hand, appears to likely create more confusion about the status of ETH. To the extent that you don't say ETH is not a security, please consider confirming the policy rationale to the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws, as you did with respect to Bitcoin earlier in the paragraph, basically saying, hey, Bill, what do you want to do? Do you want to say that ETH is not a security? Because just say it. And then Bill then later made this speech and then just said it.
00:32:53.992 - 00:32:54.770, Speaker A: Just said it.
00:32:54.840 - 00:33:22.414, Speaker B: And then in an email, him in responded and said the language around Ether would be used if we are all in agreement. So he's like, okay, so guys, we're agreeing to say that ETH isn't a security here. And then he made the speech which said that Ether wasn't a security. And now these Ripple docs are revealed to show that makes it really hard for Gary Gensler and the current SEC administration to say that Bill Hinman was acting of his own accord because there's emails of the SEC saying like, hey, we're all in agreement about what we're going to say here, right?
00:33:22.452 - 00:33:43.554, Speaker A: David? This just makes it so obvious that the SEC, the current leadership, the SEC changed its mind, right? Changed things around, had previously said Ether was not a security in 2018 and now want to retract that and take that back. Very clear.
00:33:43.592 - 00:34:18.000, Speaker B: So this is why in the court, the judge for the Ripple case was like, hey, the SEC is not allowed to edit its previous statements. It's not like changing on the record. The SEC is not allowed to go say, but what we really meant was this. And so the court is sealing Bill Hyman's statements as real statements that the SEC cannot say. Like, that's not what we meant. Seems fair, right? So they are not allowed to go basically no takes backseat is how I was. The court said no takes back seas on the Bill Hinman thing.
00:34:18.000 - 00:34:21.786, Speaker B: That's a great summary, actually. No takes backseas.
00:34:21.978 - 00:34:49.130, Speaker A: This is Nick Carter saying when this came out, the day has barely started and already a big setback for the SEC. They argued that Hindman was just a loose cannon going off in his own clear now that he got sign off from the highest levels. Great news. Overall, it comes to a court system holding our regulators responsible. That is a good thing. All right, so that's the second shenanigan that they find themselves in. Oh, and XRP is up on the news.
00:34:49.280 - 00:34:59.180, Speaker B: Interestingly, XRP is the only coin in the top 20 that was green because XRP is like, oh, you guys are all getting sued as securities too. Welcome.
00:35:00.510 - 00:35:07.406, Speaker A: Oh, wow. All right, no clarity. Here we go. Last thing real quick, what are they doing with this Coinbase thing?
00:35:07.508 - 00:35:45.942, Speaker B: Not quite the last thing. We got more shenanigans. So this is shenanigans number three. The SEC wants 120 days to respond to Coinbase's petition. So one, here is Paul Greywall's summary of the SEC's filing to the response last week in the Third Circuit Court. This has been the fight for clarity that Coinbase is like, hey, can a court please make the SEC tell us whether they're going to make rules or not? And the SEC response to that was like, we want 120 days. And so Paul just summarizes four main points here, saying that the SEC repeats the fallacy, that they haven't made any decision on new crypto rules.
00:35:45.942 - 00:36:17.522, Speaker B: Two, they refuse to commit to any deadline despite the court's explicit order. Three, instead of and three, they three, instead they anticipate in making a recommendation in 120 days. And four, they ignore the clear statements of the chair that confirm that they have no intent to issue new rules and instead conflate the evidence of a decision. Those statements provide with an argument that the statements are themselves a decision. Blah, blah, blah, blah. They're just throwing I summarized this and basically the SEC just told us to go F ourselves.
00:36:17.586 - 00:36:51.454, Speaker A: Yeah, this is called stonewalling. They're not going to do sorry, like, they're just not going to play ball with Coinbase, not going to provide any clarity to the industry. And David, two weeks ago, do you remember in those complaints filed with courts against Binance and Coinbase, they just called a whole bunch of crypto assets securities, including tokens like Matic, which is the token behind Polygon, tokens like Sol, which is the token behind Solana. And the token projects themselves have fired back. They are responding. What are we looking at here?
00:36:51.572 - 00:37:13.526, Speaker B: So this is a statement from Polygon. We also have a statement from Solana. Both of them basically say the same thing is like they disagree with the characterization of them as a security polygon said that they sold polygon outside of the US. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Solana will say the same thing. Here's a quote from the Solana article that I really like here's from a solana developer in a hacker house in New York City. Actually, I bet this is the one that's not too far away from me.
00:37:13.526 - 00:37:48.498, Speaker B: The hacker said, I don't think any developers give a shit. Seoul being a security doesn't really affect anyone building on top of Solana, which is just great cypherpunk fashion. The terrible thing, Ryan, is that Solana Polygon filecoin, all these tokens that were deemed to be securities are not defendants. They are collateral damage, where the defendants are Binance and Coinbase. And so they don't even get to have a seat in the court in the hearing, really, because they are not the defendant. They are just being charged with being a security as, like, collateral damage inside of the suit between Coinbase and Binance and the SEC.
00:37:48.664 - 00:37:53.038, Speaker A: But can they be deemed a security without fighting that out with these projects in court?
00:37:53.214 - 00:37:56.274, Speaker B: I don't know, but that's yeah, well.
00:37:56.392 - 00:38:08.518, Speaker A: Let me ask you what you think about that. So the Salana hacker house guy said, I don't think developers give a shit. Okay? That's true. However, look, Sola is down 94%. I meant, like, there's FTX, there's all sorts of other reasons why I say.
00:38:08.524 - 00:38:11.274, Speaker B: It'S all this, but it also has an insane 2021.
00:38:11.312 - 00:38:36.510, Speaker A: Yeah, but this sure didn't help. Okay, and so it does impact the economic security of these alternative layer ones, right? I mean, if all of these tokens are deemed securities in the US. But here's the thing. I think the rest of the world will continue to march on. Gary Gensler is not the emperor of the world. And while he has some networks are bigger than Gary Robinhood, though. Delisting.
00:38:36.510 - 00:38:42.210, Speaker A: So, boo, cardano, polygon, you're the only.
00:38:42.280 - 00:38:45.874, Speaker B: Ones delisting, robin Hood. It's unfortunate you're the only ones doing this.
00:38:45.912 - 00:38:46.894, Speaker A: It's unfortunate.
00:38:47.022 - 00:38:47.726, Speaker B: Very unfortunate.
00:38:47.758 - 00:38:57.170, Speaker A: It would be nice if they joined the battle and fought the good fight, like Kraken, Coinbase and others are doing, because we need all the ammo that we can get. Here's a tweet from Ryan Selkis.
00:38:57.330 - 00:39:09.514, Speaker B: This is what SEC protection looks like. And he basically he's showing the Mazari chart that we were showing up earlier where everything down blood. Yeah. This is when the tokens dumped. So yeah, it's not great. It's not great.
00:39:09.552 - 00:39:14.950, Speaker A: He says, Aren't you grateful your tax dollars go to Gary Gensler, who already made $100 million.
00:39:14.960 - 00:39:18.334, Speaker B: I hate the fact that I pay his salary. I hate that. I hate that.
00:39:18.372 - 00:39:21.198, Speaker A: So he can pull up the ladder behind himself and screw you.
00:39:21.364 - 00:39:28.574, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, so we have two more sections of SEC shenanigans. Can we play the clip of Gary Gensler in 2018?
00:39:28.622 - 00:39:31.986, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, this is a great clip. Here we go. This is Gary Gen.
00:39:32.168 - 00:39:46.390, Speaker B: I love 2018. Gary, by the way, over 70% of the crypto market is Bitcoin, Ether Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash. Why did I name those four? They're not securities.
00:39:47.630 - 00:39:51.420, Speaker A: Wait, let's play that back. Let's play that back.
00:39:52.430 - 00:39:54.570, Speaker B: Those four, they're not securities.
00:39:56.030 - 00:39:57.558, Speaker A: Gary Gensler.
00:39:57.734 - 00:40:01.934, Speaker B: I love 2018. Gary Gensler. Sure that's the same guy?
00:40:02.132 - 00:40:04.958, Speaker A: Looks like him. Could be deep fake, David. I don't know.
00:40:05.044 - 00:40:08.080, Speaker B: Yeah, you can't trust these states.
00:40:08.770 - 00:40:19.682, Speaker A: My, how things have changed, though. This is your take me earlier, I want Gary Gensler out of office, me now I want Gary Gensler in prison. Well, he's not going to come on the podcast now.
00:40:19.736 - 00:40:23.390, Speaker B: David, thanks a lot. I have spoken.
00:40:23.550 - 00:40:25.140, Speaker A: Why do you feel this way?
00:40:26.570 - 00:41:13.122, Speaker B: Because, Gary, it's one thing to be an incompetent regulator, but Gary has shown to be competent and to have positions and stances in 2018. And he has shown to understand crypto networks. He has shown to be a competent, functioning person who deeply understands this crypto industry. And now he is, as far as I can tell, exclusively playing the political game of climbing up ladders of power. And it is a single player PvE game that Gary is playing inside of a world of people, of humans. Gary, we live in a society, you do not get to treat the rest of humans as your environment that you are Pveing. But that is what he is doing.
00:41:13.176 - 00:41:17.698, Speaker A: But you said something stronger. You said you want Gary Gensler in prison. All right.
00:41:17.784 - 00:41:46.126, Speaker B: He is using the authority of a public office to elevate himself and tear down an entire industry of hundreds of thousands of people. He is misusing the authority given to him by his role for his own self gain. There's some law, there's probably some law out there. Find it. We can find it. He is doing something against the people. This is Gary Gensler versus The People.
00:41:46.228 - 00:42:20.986, Speaker A: I think what you're reacting to here and of like, before someone gets prosecuted or there's criminal charges, there has to be evidence of criminality, right? So just because you don't like somebody, it doesn't mean like, I don't like this guy. Go to prison, you're going to prison. I think that if you looked hard, there would be evidence of corruption here. And I think that's what you are reacting to so strongly. It's not just an abdication of responsibility, of shirking your duties and playing a self interested games. Lots of people do that. CEOs do that.
00:42:20.986 - 00:42:36.480, Speaker A: There's tons of psychopaths in corporations and government. I think that there is actual corruption that could be going on here. And if we find evidence of that, that is a reason to hashtag fire Gary Gensler. That's where we're going next.
00:42:37.490 - 00:42:39.866, Speaker B: I will settle for a firing of Gary Gensler.
00:42:39.898 - 00:42:48.494, Speaker A: This is Warren Davidson here. Today I filed the SEC Stabilization Act. SEC Stabilization this is not stablecoins here. We're trying to stabilize.
00:42:48.622 - 00:42:48.914, Speaker B: Why?
00:42:48.952 - 00:43:12.298, Speaker A: Because it's gotten volatile, I guess. Today I filed the SEC Stabilization Act to restructure the SEC and hashtag fire Gary Kensler, he put it in hashtags because, you know, he wants it to right, right. Here he goes. U. S. Capital markets must be protected from Tyrannical Chairman, including the current one. It's time for real reform and to fire Gary Gensler as chair of the SEC.
00:43:12.298 - 00:43:24.990, Speaker A: Warren Davidson is a crypto friendly congressman, I believe. I often see his name associated with Tom Emmer, who we've had on the podcast before, who I believe is saying something similar.
00:43:25.060 - 00:43:33.758, Speaker B: Him and Tom Emmer have co written that very progressive, productive crypto bill that Jake Stravinsky and other crypto lawyers are like. Big thumbs up.
00:43:33.844 - 00:43:35.998, Speaker A: Which one's that? Did you guys talk about that last?
00:43:36.084 - 00:43:39.122, Speaker B: How the digital asset market structure ah, right.
00:43:39.176 - 00:43:48.142, Speaker A: And now they've got a second bill to fire Gary Gensler. Do you think this is actually, like, going to get legs? I don't know how bills like these work. Or is this just if the Republicans.
00:43:48.206 - 00:43:51.478, Speaker B: Win the 2024 election, then big time.
00:43:51.564 - 00:43:56.086, Speaker A: Yeah, but I mean, Gary is out anyway in 2025.
00:43:56.188 - 00:43:56.806, Speaker B: Yeah, you're right.
00:43:56.828 - 00:44:08.918, Speaker A: He is out. Yeah. Okay. That's the SEC. We're done with the SEC shenanigans for this week. Anyway, my question to you is, do we have to start worrying about the CFTC?
00:44:09.094 - 00:44:33.038, Speaker B: All right, quickly, before we get there, here's a very quick this is why this is a Democrat versus Republican issue. Yeah, this is a great tweet from Nick Tomeno. The biden administration's crypto timeline. First, Sam Bankman Fried is the second largest donor to Biden's presidential campaign. Second biden. Appoints Gary Gensler as Chairman of the SEC. Third, Gary Gensler hosts meetings with SBF and FTX with no action letter discussed.
00:44:33.038 - 00:44:53.146, Speaker B: Next, after winning favor with the SEC, FTX is exposed as the largest fraud in history by the crypto community. And last, the SEC attacks sound legal businesses that have been attempting to work in good faith with regulators for over a decade. Coinbase and kraken. I sent this tweet to my very Democrat family and I got Crickets back.
00:44:53.248 - 00:45:20.038, Speaker A: Well, the problem is, look, I don't think that corruption is a right versus left, democrat versus Republican issue. It's just corruption. And that's what this smells like and that's what it looks like. And wherever it is, it doesn't matter what side of the political spectrum you're on. You should be in favor of getting corruption out of government. It's certainly looking like it. Can we turn to the CFTC for a corruption free regulation? Are they friends of crypto?
00:45:20.074 - 00:45:58.362, Speaker B: Also not great. Okay, so this is the CFTC versus Uki Dao. This is something that a lot of the legal minds in the crypto space have been paying attention to as the thing to pay attention to, because what is being judged over here, what is being ruled, is the liability of Dao members of actions of the Dao. So Ukidao formerly called BZX, I think it was BZX, it was exploited. And so there is, I think, a class action lawsuit against Ukidao. This is all directionally correct. And so it's a suit over whether the Dao members can take responsibility over the damage caused by a Dao.
00:45:58.362 - 00:46:05.774, Speaker B: The CFTC has won that court case. The court has deemed CFTC to have won, which is bad, which is terrible.
00:46:05.822 - 00:46:30.906, Speaker A: We don't like to be like if this kind of precedent continues, if you have a token in a particular Dow governance token and something happens, the Dow does something in which you could potentially be legally liable in the same way an equity holder or partner is. If this was some sort of corporate entity or a business entity in the US.
00:46:31.088 - 00:47:00.354, Speaker B: It's basically the worst possible ruling for DAOs. Why are we not completely freaking out about this? So Lexnode, who's another crypto lawyer, says that this is a default judgment. Oki. Dao didn't offend itself, so the CFTC won without needing to prove its theories. So that is very limited precedence legal precedent. So that is why we're not freaking out about this. But if this could have been much worse, the Ukidao has to pay $645,000 ukidao members.
00:47:00.354 - 00:47:13.510, Speaker B: Basically, this is the CFTC calling a bluff on decentralization theater, specifically around Ukidao. But the worry is that this would happen again and the next one would fight have more legal precedent. Yeah.
00:47:13.580 - 00:47:20.790, Speaker A: It is important to know here that no Ukidao members were held personally responsible, liable for anything in this particular.
00:47:20.860 - 00:47:25.114, Speaker B: So it's a very mixed bag reaction. But the Ukidao story is now closed, I guess. Yeah.
00:47:25.152 - 00:47:44.526, Speaker A: The idea that a token holder has kind of like risk, basically that torches, I think, tokens in the US, like DAOs in the US in particular. And it's interesting because token holders don't have the legal rights on the benefit side of things, they just have the downside. Right.
00:47:44.628 - 00:47:46.982, Speaker B: No investor protections, only investor liability.
00:47:47.066 - 00:47:52.866, Speaker A: It's a backdoor way to kind of like torch the asset class and really cause some harm here. Wow.
00:47:52.968 - 00:48:03.174, Speaker B: God, Ryan, I hate that. We are 49 minutes into this recording and it's all SEC CFD. I hate that.
00:48:03.212 - 00:48:11.782, Speaker A: You know what? It's been that kind of year, though. It is a regulatory war year. But we got some great things coming up next, which is more build market material. Uniswap.
00:48:11.846 - 00:48:12.170, Speaker B: God.
00:48:12.240 - 00:48:14.806, Speaker A: Version four, getting ready to ship.

00:50:40.490 - 00:50:47.626, Speaker B: Bankless Nation we got the fourth Uniswap, the Uniswap with the hook centric roadmap for Uniswap. That's what I'm calling.
00:50:47.728 - 00:50:48.940, Speaker A: Try to make that happen.
00:50:49.470 - 00:50:50.886, Speaker B: I think it's a great meme.
00:50:50.918 - 00:50:51.646, Speaker A: It's pretty good.
00:50:51.748 - 00:50:56.954, Speaker B: You get it right? Like ethereum's roll up centric roadmap, uniswap's hook centric roadmap.
00:50:57.002 - 00:50:59.280, Speaker A: Tell people what hooks are so they understand.
00:50:59.890 - 00:51:39.318, Speaker B: So we'll start with Uniswap V three and why we needed a V four in the first place. So the idea behind Uniswap V three was that V three had certain features embedded into V three, into uniswap V three pools. One of them was like an oracle, for example. And so every single uniswap pool, whether it's like Ether USD or Ether Die, it came with an oracle in every single uniswap exchange. So anytime you ever swapped on a uniswap V three pool contract, you would update that oracle. And that would cost gas. And so that is an opinionated feature that is costing money for swappers for perhaps a feature that not very many people are using, especially on the long tail of uniswap pools.
00:51:39.318 - 00:52:09.270, Speaker B: And so that is an example of a feature that's placed into uniswap V three that you cannot pull out. Uniswap V four is a massively reduced feature eliminated base protocol with instead of features hooks. Hook. What are hooks? Hooks are just expressive ways to input new code into a uniswap V Four pool contract. And so what does a hook do? It can do anything. That's kind of the point. It's kind of like a smart contract.
00:52:09.270 - 00:52:16.258, Speaker B: Not a fully expressive smart contract, but still very expressive way to make widgets.
00:52:16.354 - 00:52:21.766, Speaker A: For Uniswap almost like a smart pool. Right, or like smart pool. Yes, smart.
00:52:21.798 - 00:52:25.898, Speaker B: Smart feature, smart widget. It's not fully Turing complete, but it's most of the way there.
00:52:25.984 - 00:52:51.074, Speaker A: The other reason I like hook centric roadmap, and compare that to roll up centric roadmap, which Ethereum mapped to, is because this is like ethereum in the way that the roll up centric roadmap for Ethereum made ethereum modular. We've talked very much about modular ethereum. This is modular uniswap. This is the reason they're doing hooks, so that the primitive can focus on kind of the base layer type stuff.
00:52:51.112 - 00:52:53.966, Speaker B: The primitive can be primitive, and it's much more expressive.
00:52:53.998 - 00:53:09.278, Speaker A: You can build all sorts of other things on top of it, just in the same way that the beacon chain and ethereum really focused on the consensus layer, the core stuff that only ethereum could do. And it was like outsourced execution to the rollups. And that's what Uniswap is doing with these hooks.
00:53:09.474 - 00:53:33.886, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right. So what can you do with hooks? It's really your oyster. You can make a transaction that does Dcang over blocks for a year's long worth of time. You can put back in that oracle that I was talking about. You can do anything. I think there's going to be, like, two classes of hooks. There's going to be hooks that almost everyone uses because they're just so good and useful that most uniswap pools use them.
00:53:33.886 - 00:53:47.662, Speaker B: And then there's going to be completely customary custom hooks that maybe just one uniswap pool wants for one specific purpose. So it's kind of like having a generalized optimistic roll up or an app roll app or app chain, except for app hooks.
00:53:47.726 - 00:53:47.954, Speaker A: Right.
00:53:47.992 - 00:53:48.514, Speaker B: Does that make sense?
00:53:48.552 - 00:54:02.330, Speaker A: Yeah, it does. Now, we should say this isn't live now. Correct. A lot of the code is out there, but it's on GitHub. And Uniswap is doing a different approach with respect to the launch of V Four. V Three was just like, boom, it's here. Launched on main net.
00:54:02.330 - 00:54:23.120, Speaker A: V Four is like, hey, here's what we're doing. Go take a look at our code, go read our white paper, give us some commentary, and we'll roll this out in the months ahead. I don't know. Do you think Hayden we had Hayden Adams on the podcast earlier this week. Do you think that V Four is going to release by the end of this year? Do you think it's that soon, or could it take a little bit longer?
00:54:23.490 - 00:54:52.566, Speaker B: It's going to take so it's got a dependency. It needs this thing called transient storage from EIP 1153. Okay, so what does transient storage do does. I have to explain one more feature, which is called the singleton construction. This is a design term in computer science. A singleton contract is just a single contract that hosts all of the logic as opposed to many different contracts for every single pool. So uniswap, v three and v two were all done with unique contracts.
00:54:52.566 - 00:55:17.746, Speaker B: So when you spun up every single token on Uniswap, V Two and V Three has its own Uniswap contract address with a singleton contract Design. Uniswap is one single contract address that pools exchange. Pools are inside of that one contract. So instead of one contract per token, it's one global contract, a singleton contract. And so what does that do? That reduces minting new pools the cost to mint new pools by 99%.
00:55:17.768 - 00:55:19.426, Speaker A: 99%?
00:55:19.608 - 00:55:46.026, Speaker B: Yeah. So new pools cost 99% less to mint. I mean, that's a one time fee. So it's just like the long tail of crypto assets get cheaper uniswap pools. But then, importantly, it makes this thing called flash accounting. So if every single Uniswap pool is under one single contract, it makes order routing between all of the Uniswap pools extremely efficient. And then this Flash accounting thing is what they need transient storage from EIP 1153 to do.
00:55:46.026 - 00:56:00.778, Speaker B: And so when we rebalance all of the pools because everyone is doing all these trades all at once, the transient storage allows for flash accounting so that all the Uniswap pools can all settle without making a big footprint on the ethereum layer.
00:56:00.794 - 00:56:00.926, Speaker A: One.
00:56:00.948 - 00:56:01.466, Speaker B: Why are you smiling?
00:56:01.498 - 00:56:12.510, Speaker A: I'm just smiling because imagine a crypto. Noob, just listening to what we just said. There there's so many words there that they're like transient storage and flash. What did you just say? Flash.
00:56:12.670 - 00:56:13.406, Speaker B: Flash accounting.
00:56:13.438 - 00:56:21.574, Speaker A: Flash accounting. All of these things. Give us the really explain it like I'm Five kind of version of this, too. Okay.
00:56:21.612 - 00:56:57.458, Speaker B: How to explain uniswap? Like, two main there's two main things apps, which are the hooks. So Uniswap has apps now, and they're going to be developed by the open source world. It's free and permissionless to build apps for Uniswap. So Uniswap is going to have apps, flash accounting. It doesn't cost anything to trade across multiple Uniswap pools at once, and it used to. And so the complexity and gas costs and fees of trading throughout the Uniswap universe is almost zero. All right, that's good.
00:56:57.458 - 00:56:58.098, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:58.184 - 00:57:01.314, Speaker A: More pools, better pools, more liquidity. That's what we're getting. Better.
00:57:01.352 - 00:57:16.546, Speaker B: D five. Overall, it's a huge emphasis on gas reduction. So gas reduction is a huge theme in V Four and also expressivity. So I have two big questions, Ryan, that we want to bring up. Here's the discord. This was from Scotty. Scotty from the Bankless Nation discord.
00:57:16.546 - 00:57:33.178, Speaker B: What's up, Scotty? Ryan, and David, do you see Uniswap V Four as a boon or a consolidation? I love the architecture and the composability. However, the hook concept could turn any competing AMM into a. Uniswap surf by reducing their product to a hook that feeds the uniswap engine.
00:57:33.264 - 00:57:34.074, Speaker A: Smart question.
00:57:34.192 - 00:57:38.558, Speaker B: It's a very smart question. I actually went into the discord. I was like, Yo, bro, that's a really great question.
00:57:38.644 - 00:57:41.326, Speaker A: Scotty, you should be continued questions here, not us.
00:57:41.508 - 00:58:04.454, Speaker B: Scotty continues and says the comparison to Ethereum is apt. Thank you, Scotty. Roll a hook centric roadmap for Uniswap. Put that one in your brain. It's now a meme, but breaks down because Hayden and company own the fee switch after V Four when all competing AMMS collapse into hooks and Uniswap has captured most on chain liquidity. What do you expect, v Five or V Six or the fee switch to look like? Does this centralize or decentralize Uniswap in your mind? Do you have an answer?
00:58:04.492 - 00:58:07.974, Speaker A: Because I go for it. You start with this one.
00:58:08.092 - 00:58:09.682, Speaker B: All right. First let me drink some more.
00:58:09.836 - 00:58:13.050, Speaker A: He's preparing his answer. Scotty, get ready for it.
00:58:13.200 - 00:58:24.654, Speaker B: I think Scotty is just like, he's got the bead. He's on the ball right now. Okay, so do you see uniswap before as a boon or a consolidation? The answer is both. And I want to put this into.
00:58:24.852 - 00:58:28.670, Speaker A: Alt Layer One terms because I think consolidation of what? Of liquidity.
00:58:29.730 - 00:58:41.234, Speaker B: I think Scotty is saying all of these alternative AMMS that have different design structures and patterns are now made obsolete because they can just become a hook onto E Four is going to eat.
00:58:41.272 - 00:58:44.686, Speaker A: Those in the same way, I think that roll ups kind of eat roll.
00:58:44.718 - 00:58:55.474, Speaker B: Up centric roadmaps, eat up all the layer One. It's the same pattern. So why would you spin up a lot? Here's the words of the ETH Maxi, right? Why would you spin up an alternative Layer One just make a roll up on Ethereum?
00:58:55.522 - 00:58:55.926, Speaker A: Why?
00:58:56.028 - 00:59:35.066, Speaker B: Why would you make another AMM with different logic or just make it a hook on top of Uniswap? And so it's both a boon and a consolidation, I think, as an Ethereum biased person, that the roll up centric roadmap to Ethereum is a boon for many, many networks because they do not have to be burdened with having to deal with the complexity of the decentralized nature of the Layer One. Hooks on Uniswap do not have to deal with getting new liquidity, becoming a completely resistant, hardened protocol. Like, you just hook into Uniswap and you have all the liquidity. It's going to be easier to get your logic built into liquidity if you just make a hook on top of Uniswap.
00:59:35.198 - 00:59:36.134, Speaker A: Yeah, you know what?
00:59:36.172 - 00:59:37.640, Speaker B: I think the patterns are so strong.
00:59:38.810 - 01:00:14.914, Speaker A: I'm much less worried about kind of consolidation and network effect and one particular thing, owning 90% of Mark share, that sort of thing. If it's a credibly neutral, public good primitive. Right? And I'm not saying that Uniswap is as much that as Ethereum is, because it's not. All right? There's, like a uniswap labs type entity. There's other things. There's Uni token governance there's kind of fee switch they have not quite open source licensing. It's like a four year thing.
01:00:14.914 - 01:00:38.294, Speaker A: Then it becomes open source. But it's pretty close, and maybe as close as we've seen of any DeFi protocol. There's things like curve that are very close to the bare metal, too, and I love those things. I'm less worried about kind of consolidation of kind of uniswap, as long as it preserves those core properties of decentralization. Yeah.
01:00:38.332 - 01:01:11.538, Speaker B: And I think a lot of those core properties about uniswap are like, that's not an option. They don't have the turn on centralization switch on uniswap. They just have turn on the fee switch. And so, yeah, if you want to be kind of cynical about it, I think the idea of what did Scotty say, that Hayden and company have the fee switch, I think that's a little bit of a cynical well, like, tokens start somewhere. Hayden invented the protocol. He invented it in a way that you cannot make it centralized. Like yeah, he has a lot of uni tokens, but it's also one of.
01:01:11.544 - 01:01:15.300, Speaker A: The biggest areas anyone can spin up a pool, right?
01:01:15.690 - 01:01:16.102, Speaker B: Yes.
01:01:16.156 - 01:01:18.790, Speaker A: And the fee switch is configured based on the pool.
01:01:22.490 - 01:01:24.022, Speaker B: I don't know about that one.
01:01:24.076 - 01:01:25.558, Speaker A: Got more to learn about this.
01:01:25.724 - 01:01:54.266, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Another question from Spartansolution. ETH uniswap v Four announces Hooks this week. One of the hooks discussed in the podcast was the ability to enable trades using TWAP for buying and selling tokens. Would this hook be something someone can use to DCA into a token on uniswap? Yes, and that is actually the exact point of what that app was talking about. You can use a hook to do DCA into uniswap, and it's actually just one transaction, and you can set the logic, and you only have to buy $1 cost averaging.
01:01:54.298 - 01:02:00.802, Speaker A: That's what DCA is. If you want to put a little bit of your paycheck every two weeks into crypto, you can do that.
01:02:00.936 - 01:02:01.778, Speaker B: That's exactly right.
01:02:01.784 - 01:02:01.906, Speaker A: Okay.
01:02:01.928 - 01:02:24.858, Speaker B: If you want to listen to the podcast with Hayden, we had an hour long hour and ten minutes with Hayden. I'm talking all about it. So that podcast is well, it's already in your podcast feed here's, Hayden. Okay, are you ready? Eigen layer, Iecan layer, main net launch. All right, eigen layer is on, chain is on main net. So there are three milestones to the Eigen layer main net. We are at milestone number one, so we are off.
01:02:24.858 - 01:02:50.018, Speaker B: What is milestone number one? This is when 3200 of each of the following staked ETH tokens are allowed to be deposited into Eigen layer. That's lido rocket pool and coinbase wrap, staked ether. So SC, ETH, R ETH, CBE 3200. And each of them can be deposited into eigen layer. They all got filled up within hours of main net launch. And so now it's all full.
01:02:50.104 - 01:02:51.666, Speaker A: So you can't do anything right now.
01:02:51.768 - 01:03:11.306, Speaker B: Now you can't do anything because it's too late. They already did it. They're going to open up that more. It's like very guarded, slow launch, very protected, very secure. So that's phase one. So I guess milestone one is already done. Milestone two is when operators join the network and these are the people who do the actual validation tasks of restaked networks, aka doing the work.
01:03:11.306 - 01:03:29.066, Speaker B: So that's what's coming up next. And then in milestone three is when we launch actual services. So these are the actual Eigen networks. Some of them are already being worked on. Some of them are just theoretical, but totally up to the free market to build that's Eigen layer. Data availability espresso, which is shared sequencing, witness chain omni.
01:03:29.098 - 01:03:44.702, Speaker A: That's going to be so cool. I can't wait. It's going to be an explosion. This is his biggest roll ups. And we talked about this two weeks ago. We had our episode with Sriram about restaking. Basically, you take your ETH, you stake it, you stake again, stake it again, another network.
01:03:44.702 - 01:04:06.970, Speaker A: And that transmutes some of the economic security of Ethereum's validator set into the new thing that you want to bootstrap, an oracle, an app, a chain, whatever you can think of. It's such a fantastic concept and the fact that this is coming out already is very exciting. I remember when we first learned about roll ups, we had to wait for like three years.
01:04:07.120 - 01:04:09.882, Speaker B: Oh my God, way too long. Way too long.
01:04:09.936 - 01:04:10.502, Speaker A: Restaking.
01:04:10.566 - 01:04:16.946, Speaker B: That is actually a really good point. The inception of knowing about Eigen layer to it going to Mainnet. I learned about it in October of 2000.
01:04:16.948 - 01:04:18.378, Speaker A: And why didn't we think of this earlier?
01:04:18.474 - 01:04:22.254, Speaker B: Sriram, why didn't we think about yeah, why didn't we think about Rest?
01:04:22.292 - 01:04:25.802, Speaker A: I guess we have to have Staking first. And that happened relatively recently.
01:04:25.946 - 01:04:26.574, Speaker B: That is true.
01:04:26.612 - 01:04:27.620, Speaker A: All right, that is true.
01:04:28.070 - 01:04:42.898, Speaker B: Well, the other thing is like, okay, so yeah, we waited forever for roll ups and now we finally have them. People were building their Eigen layer restaking components before Mainnet was even around. There's infrastructure ready to go to be using Eigen layer.
01:04:42.914 - 01:05:02.186, Speaker A: Data availability polygon just an announcement as well. So our vision for Polygon is simple. To build a value layer of the Internet, they're doing an announcement where they're kind of starting with a series of announcements, I would say. So what is ahead of us for the next month or so? A few things.
01:05:02.208 - 01:05:05.498, Speaker B: We have an announcement of four announcements.
01:05:05.594 - 01:05:06.240, Speaker A: Yes.
01:05:06.770 - 01:05:26.882, Speaker B: Okay, so the week of June 20 or excuse me, the week of June 19 is when they are going to be talking about the future of the Polygon proof of stake chain. I'm going to guess that it's going to become a ZK roll up. I'm just making that prediction. The week of June 26. The next week is the architecture and stack of Polygon. There's a bunch of other networks. Maybe they get tied together.
01:05:26.882 - 01:05:42.986, Speaker B: Then. July 10, the Utility and evolution of the native Matic token. And then the week of July 17, the transition to greater community governance and protocol in the treasury sounds like a very holistic large move by Polygon. All in all. So this kind of feels like the.
01:05:43.008 - 01:06:07.090, Speaker A: Big the biggest one I'm excited about is any idea of the Polygon proof of stake chain turning into a ZK roll up, a ZK EVM. That would be absolutely amazing. That would be like promises made, promises kept type of moment and would just cement roll ups as cement. Ethereum's roll up centric Roadmap is hey, it works. We had a big kind of like sidechain type thing convert.
01:06:07.750 - 01:06:14.740, Speaker B: Interesting that the branding on this Tweet. Our vision for Polygon is simple to build the value layer of the that.
01:06:15.110 - 01:06:18.030, Speaker A: Does that trigger you? Do you think they should mention Ethereum?
01:06:18.190 - 01:06:19.586, Speaker B: I mean, Ethereum is the internet.
01:06:19.618 - 01:06:35.510, Speaker A: I saw lots of people getting upset at this saying like Polygon is kind of disaligned or like the marketing, that kind of thing. I'm not seeing it yet, but it's a take out there. I will get to this like the current mood and the vibe.
01:06:35.670 - 01:06:36.860, Speaker B: Save that for later.
01:06:37.710 - 01:06:38.154, Speaker A: All right.
01:06:38.192 - 01:07:05.650, Speaker B: What's optimism last layer, two thing optimism bedrock got released last week and so now we are able to check out some of the data on the gas fees. So if you open up that doom board that comes up next. So we can just see that gas fees on Bedrock are like one third, one half reduced versus the legacy. Optimism. Just lovely to see. This is all before EIP 4844. So when you reduce Optimism gas fees by more than half before 4844 gosh.
01:07:06.470 - 01:07:18.790, Speaker A: Gas fees getting low. David over to NFT stuff Kraken out of beta kraken NFT new gateway to buying, selling and learning about NFTs. What is this about from Kraken?
01:07:19.210 - 01:07:45.794, Speaker B: So they have their new NFT platform that is launched, buying, holding, selling and learning about NFTs. They say they're integrated with Polygon. You also can trade Reddit collectible avatars reddit is having its blackout moment. But you can still trade snooze on polygon using Kraken. Cool. So you can also pay with whatever you can buy and sell NFTs using your credit card or crypto, which is interesting. And then also they have their F one car.
01:07:45.794 - 01:08:02.962, Speaker B: So if you want to get your NFT, perhaps if I do this my crypto dick butt on the Kraken F one car, you can put your NFTs into the Kraken NFT platform. So congrats on Kraken for getting their NFT platform out of the gate. And of course, disclosure Kraken is also a sponsor of the podcast.
01:08:03.026 - 01:08:31.550, Speaker A: Also should mention, because we talked about Uniswap earlier, that Uniswap is also a sponsor of the Bankless podcast, as you've probably noticed and I'm an advisor to Matic and David and I are both advisors for Optimism. We've mentioned all of these projects. So want to keep disclosures always front and center with you guys as always bankless.com slash disclosures. You can find out what we are doing in crypto at any given time. David, this is pretty big news. BlackRock filing a bitcoin ETF soon.
01:08:31.700 - 01:08:46.526, Speaker B: Close to, close to, but that would be huge. But the reason why yes, BlackRock like biggest asset manager on the face of the it's real hard for Gary Gensler to ignore, aren't they? Yeah.
01:08:46.568 - 01:08:46.966, Speaker A: Right?
01:08:47.068 - 01:09:04.700, Speaker B: Yeah. And so there's two partners here. Both CoinDesk and Kraken have been partnered with this. So Kraken is providing the pricing data and Coinbase is being the custodian. So Coinbase will store the Bitcoin, kraken will provide the pricing and Blackhelrock will provide the ETF, and Gary Gensler will approve it.
01:09:05.230 - 01:09:11.270, Speaker A: Will he? Right, gary, who's stronger? Which influence is stronger? Is it kind of the big asset manager institution?
01:09:11.350 - 01:09:12.266, Speaker B: Really good question.
01:09:12.368 - 01:09:26.834, Speaker A: It is. I mean, this will be fun to watch that squirming happen. Very exciting, though we certainly need a Bitcoin ETF. David, hong Kong is putting pressure on three major banks to take on crypto exchanges as is.
01:09:26.872 - 01:09:54.074, Speaker B: So I'm so jealous. Let me read this to you. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is putting pressure on HSBC Standard Charter and bank of China to take on crypto exchanges as clients. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is putting pressure on its own banks, saying, quote, due diligence on potential customers should not create undue burden, particularly those for setting up office in Hong Kong to look for opportunities here.
01:09:54.112 - 01:09:54.586, Speaker A: Imagine that.
01:09:54.608 - 01:09:55.686, Speaker B: I am so jealous.
01:09:55.798 - 01:09:56.858, Speaker A: Imagine that.
01:09:57.024 - 01:09:59.238, Speaker B: Imagine if you had I think it's.
01:09:59.254 - 01:10:05.950, Speaker A: A matter of, honestly, the US. Zigs and Hong Kong Zags. I think that's what's happening. And China is going the opposite direction right now. First.
01:10:06.020 - 01:10:10.926, Speaker B: So Hong Kong, china kind of the same. Also not, though. This isn't mainland China. This is Hong Kong.
01:10:10.948 - 01:10:15.780, Speaker A: Yeah. Hong Kong is kind of like the financial innovation center, I would say, of China now.
01:10:16.230 - 01:10:29.682, Speaker B: But bank of China issues $28 million in a digital structured note on Ethereum, also out of Hong Kong. So there's a $28 million digital structured note. I don't know what that means. On Ethereum issued by Hong Kong.
01:10:29.826 - 01:10:33.926, Speaker A: That's pretty cool. That is interesting. Why are they doing that? That's interesting.
01:10:34.028 - 01:10:34.726, Speaker B: That's interesting.
01:10:34.828 - 01:10:36.018, Speaker A: David, there are some releases.
01:10:36.114 - 01:10:40.646, Speaker B: First, Chinese financial institution to issue a tokenized security in Hong Kong.
01:10:40.838 - 01:10:41.674, Speaker A: Big deal.
01:10:41.792 - 01:10:46.538, Speaker B: Using public permissionless rails to issue securities. You can totally do that as long.
01:10:46.544 - 01:10:48.890, Speaker A: As you traded on an ATS from Aaron Cap.
01:10:48.960 - 01:10:51.270, Speaker B: No ATS, just uniswap.
01:10:51.350 - 01:10:56.410, Speaker A: This is a release this week. Tell me about this. Tyco. Alpha three testnet is live. What is tyco?
01:10:56.570 - 01:11:21.046, Speaker B: Tyco is another L2 on Ethereum. It is a ZK EVM. It is of all the L2 ZK EVMs that are out there, ZK, sync era, polygon, scroll and then Tyco. Tyco is the furthest behind the newest on the sea. Also sitting shoulder to shoulder with the rest of them as the social categorization, all of all that. So they are now on testnet. So congrats to Matthew Pinestone and the team.
01:11:21.148 - 01:11:25.282, Speaker A: Very cool. Good people, Matthew's, from that formerly loop ring, right? And GameStop.
01:11:25.346 - 01:11:26.834, Speaker B: Formerly loop ring, formerly GameStop.
01:11:26.882 - 01:11:48.766, Speaker A: Yeah. Lens just beefed up a raise. Today we are excited to announce our $15 million funding round to accelerate the adoption of the next generation of Internet powered by Human Connection, the People powered Social layer. This is a lens protocol. Very cool. Dabbling in web3 social for sure. And, I don't know, hopefully taking some market share from the Twitters of the world.
01:11:48.766 - 01:11:49.438, Speaker A: Yes.
01:11:49.524 - 01:12:23.542, Speaker B: Yeah. Should be easy these days. David, we got a very special job this week. I'm going to dance in a second, but first, I'm going to show this job senior Analyst Token Hunter.

This is cyclical along with the market maintain thesis focus a dose of Stoicism and they'll call it luck. Great take.
01:15:40.380 - 01:15:47.980, Speaker A: That is a great take. Here's another take from David Hoffman the current meta of crypto just feels so weird right now.
01:15:48.590 - 01:15:57.120, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a little bit downstream of the conversation that we just had. It's like I can't really put a pin on it. It just feels weird to be in crypto at this present moment.
01:15:57.570 - 01:16:49.594, Speaker A: I think crypto feels a little lost is one thing. I'd say crypto, Twitter at least is more grumpy than usual, a bit more reactionary. Everything gets put under the microscope. It seems hard for us still to separate our friends from our enemies. Maybe we're just reeling from the trauma of 2022 where some people in crypto turned out to be kind of enemies of the values of this space. I feel like we're more divided than we should be, or we could be again in the face of kind of a common set of challenges. We have challenges not just from regulatory, which are immense, but also in terms of a shared voice, like a shared message showing the world what crypto can actually the value it can actually deliver.
01:16:49.594 - 01:17:00.370, Speaker A: Prices are down too, so I think people get, like, grumpy when that happens. I'm not sure. It's kind of a weird vibe right now. What do you think? How would you describe it?
01:17:00.520 - 01:17:27.414, Speaker B: I think it's also because we're seeing a crescendoing in building, but also an even faster crescendoing of FUD and, like, real FUD, like Gary Gensler, SEC FUD. And I don't know how people I don't think people are figuring out how to come to terms with it. I think we see parts of the crypto community come together. Like, I'm doing my best to try and come together with the Solana community. I'm really trying here. And then other parts just seem to be falling off. It's like crypto feels like I'm trying to hold water in my hands right now.
01:17:27.414 - 01:17:42.382, Speaker B: And it's been that way for, like, a year. I don't know what to do about it. I don't know what's, like, crypto hasn't been faced with these challenges before. I think you said this earlier. 2021. The class of 2021 and the class of 2017 just aren't, like, vibing very well.
01:17:42.436 - 01:17:53.618, Speaker A: I think it's a generational gap there. I think there is yeah, I don't know definitely some of that. I have a solution for you, but it's in the What I'm bullish on section. But I'll start with asking you the question, what are you bullish on this week?
01:17:53.704 - 01:18:18.726, Speaker B: Okay, I'm bullish on crypto lawyers. I think our lawyers in this industry are absolute just chats and chat. Just I think they're just savage. I think they're some of the coolest lawyers. I don't know the full spectrum of industry lawyers, but I think freedom lawyers, freedom fighter lawyers. Paul from coinbase. Jake and Amanda.
01:18:18.726 - 01:18:42.754, Speaker B: I don't know if you listen to that episode, Ryan, but it was awesome. Yes, I think we have some of the most savage lawyers that are out there who are like lawyers, but also just like freedom fighters, like technological freedom fighters. I never thought that we would have cipher punk lawyers, yet here we are like lawyers that embody cypherpunk values. Shout out to all the crypto lawyers out there.
01:18:42.792 - 01:18:46.178, Speaker A: That's a good one. I appreciate the lawyers. That's what I'm bullish on them, too.
01:18:46.264 - 01:18:49.710, Speaker B: Thank you for sticking around, because if you guys didn't stick around, we'd really be in trouble.
01:18:49.870 - 01:18:50.580, Speaker A: True.
01:18:50.890 - 01:18:52.342, Speaker B: Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:18:52.476 - 01:19:11.262, Speaker A: This is kind of an answer to, like, if crypto is feeling weird, here's what you should do. And it's what I'm bullish on. Grab a bear market buddy. Do you know who taught me that? My bear market buddy. You. I've been feeling like, honestly, guys, if you're listening to this, I guess you are. Crypto is hard enough.
01:19:11.262 - 01:19:20.480, Speaker A: It's really hard. You got the volatility. It's mentally exhausting. You have kind of constant attacks. Your relatives think you're crazy. You're down bad right now.
01:19:21.170 - 01:19:22.094, Speaker B: Gaslighting you.
01:19:22.132 - 01:19:39.390, Speaker A: Yeah. And then for me personally, you also throw a media on top of that. And what that means is also social media for me. And social media is notorious. It's toxic, it's hard. It's hard out there. And so I feel like sometimes every single week, I feel, like, under attack by somebody.
01:19:39.390 - 01:19:45.574, Speaker A: It's just something happens and you're just like, I didn't mean for that. I didn't mean to say it in that way.
01:19:45.772 - 01:19:48.630, Speaker B: This is not the event that I wanted to be handed, right?
01:19:48.700 - 01:20:15.342, Speaker A: And as someone in crypto and also a content creator, and I'll speak to the content creation part of this for a minute, it's very difficult to separate two things. Who are the good faith critics and who are the bad faith critics? All right? Because the bad faith critics, you want to separate them and just cast them aside. You don't need to listen to them. This is just the hater crowd. I mean, they're doing it to grow their influence. They'll be happy to spread information. It's just bad faith attacks on you.
01:20:15.342 - 01:20:39.494, Speaker A: But if you throw out all of the critics, then you also throw out the good faith critics, too. And in there, you have people who disagree, right? They're good faith critics. They disagree. Well, that's a great chance for you to engage and to learn something from them. And then you have people who misunderstand your perspective. Well, that's a good opportunity for you to learn how to communicate better. So you clarify things, right? That's good faith, too.
01:20:39.494 - 01:20:54.758, Speaker A: You want that. And then there's some people who genuinely understand you. They just think you're wrong and you did something wrong. And these are helpers. They sort of help you improve. And you absolutely want to listen to that last group of people. They're the ones that hold you accountable.
01:20:54.758 - 01:21:23.890, Speaker A: Probably like the questionnaire from earlier, asking us about disclosures, that sort of thing. So you always want to listen to your helpers. But what's really difficult to do, David, I think in bear markets, when everyone's feeling grumpy and you have these types of reactions, is like, listen to any critics. It's, like, hard for me because the bad faith and the good faith are all mixed together. So it all sounds like noise. And my solution there, the only one I found is bear market buddy. All right, you need a counsel.
01:21:23.970 - 01:21:24.882, Speaker B: Pass it back and forth.
01:21:24.946 - 01:21:52.240, Speaker A: You need a group. You need people who are going to call you on your BS, right? And also listen to your decisions. A group of people you can also be a little bit, like, crazy with, right? And so that, for me, is The Secret through getting through 2018. 2019. That for me, is actually The Secret right now. I can tell you honestly, David, I wouldn't be doing this podcast without you. There's no chance I could not run this thing.
01:21:52.240 - 01:22:10.806, Speaker A: It's just impossible. And so I just want to extrapolate that to anyone else who's listening is don't travel alone. Okay. Never do that. Go find some friends. Go find some people who are on the crypto journey that believe similar things that are here for the right reasons. Now is the time to find them because it is a settler's market.
01:22:10.806 - 01:22:21.226, Speaker A: The tourists are out. I don't know where they are, but they're gone. It's a settler's market. So find your bear market buddies and just hang on. Could be months, maybe.
01:22:21.328 - 01:22:24.026, Speaker B: Hopefully it's just months, years, I don't know.
01:22:24.128 - 01:22:31.626, Speaker A: We don't know. But settlers don't care. They're going to be here. And that's what I'm bullish on. You want to get to the meme of the week?
01:22:31.728 - 01:22:33.214, Speaker B: Meme of the week. Let's do it. All right.
01:22:33.252 - 01:22:34.880, Speaker A: Here we go. What are we looking at?
01:22:38.770 - 01:22:46.180, Speaker B: We got Gary gensler as a shark and man, those eyes are really far apart. And the innocent little lady swimming on top of him.
01:22:46.550 - 01:22:49.682, Speaker A: Security jaws poster. There we go.
01:22:49.736 - 01:23:05.878, Speaker B: We also, like I said, have a moment of zen from coco the CornHub is a bankless dow members singer. It's so good. It's so good. I cherish every single one of these. I doubt that they're still going to be available, but these are a mint on manifold. I believe there's 150. I definitely minted one.
01:23:05.878 - 01:23:10.006, Speaker B: So yeah, we're going to go here from that moment as in as soon as Ryan tells you about risks and disclaimers about going away.
01:23:10.028 - 01:23:22.906, Speaker A: Yeah. Get ready for it. This is elcoco ETH. It's the bear it's called. This will get you in the mood for a good bear market where we are right now in the settlers market, risks and disclaimers, of course. Got to let you know, ETH bitcoin. These assets are all risky.
01:23:22.906 - 01:23:31.200, Speaker A: So is crypto. You could definitely lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
01:23:35.250 - 01:23:54.802, Speaker D: It's the bear, it's the bear. It's finally hair. I swear I'm so happy because it's the bear now the crypto bear is one to fair. He'll eat your soul if you don't take care. When the tide goes out, he smells the air. And if you're not wearing clothes, you'll be a souvenir of the bear. But it's the bear.
01:23:54.802 - 01:24:20.986, Speaker D: It's finally hair. I swear. I'm so full of chair because it's the bear. But no one's scared because we're all out of fear and you can say LSD and a platypus appears and friends are made that'll last for years and it's easier to find your dream career. And it's also when normies think we're weak and they mount their attacks. Escape in Critiques it's funny they still don't see it clear we get stronger when times are more severe because it's the beer. It's the beer.
01:24:20.986 - 01:24:52.742, Speaker D: It's finally here. Well I swear I'm so foolish here cause it's the beer. Well the bar is when. You find out who you are. If you're here for the bow usually won't go far and it flushes out anything subpar and the noise dies down. So you could pre par for the next Bull Run whenever it comes because you've got your scars and you're no longer dumb and you're down so far that you've become numb. But it's not about the money.
01:24:52.742 - 01:25:01.440, Speaker D: When you've lived among the bar with the bar it's finally hard when I swire I'm so full of char because it's the mark.
