00:00:07.930 - 00:00:20.970, Speaker A: Bankless nation. Happy third week of October. Or, David, should I say October? We're talking all time highs right now. This has been all time high week. How you doing? You got a big smile on your face. You must be happy. You're in your spongeBob sweat sweater.
00:00:20.970 - 00:00:21.902, Speaker A: Something's going right.
00:00:21.956 - 00:00:23.470, Speaker B: High fashion Fridays.
00:00:23.970 - 00:00:24.982, Speaker A: This is awesome.
00:00:25.076 - 00:00:50.394, Speaker B: Yeah. Gosh, there's so many awesome things happened this week. Like you said, all time highs for bitcoin. We got the bitcoin ETF as well. Lots to unpack there. Also, a dow takes the mysterious, unreleased famous Wu Tang album from the cold hands of a hedge fund villain and is now making it accessible for the rest of the world. TBD on that as well.
00:00:50.394 - 00:00:59.502, Speaker B: And also draftkings and Polygon, a $40 billion public company now on Polygon. Whoa. That's pretty cool. So much to talk about.
00:00:59.636 - 00:01:21.258, Speaker A: Yeah, we got some details on the coinbase NFT platform as well. We're going to cover so much going on, David. Hard to fit it in, but we manage somehow. Sometimes it's an hour and a half, sometimes it's 2 hours. We jam packed this episode with everything that you need to know in crypto this week, so we'll attempt to do that once again. You think we're going to be successful?
00:01:21.374 - 00:01:27.638, Speaker B: We're going to try and go real fast. So let's go ahead and get right into it, Ryan. But first we got some announcements. Want to take us through them.
00:01:27.724 - 00:01:57.330, Speaker A: The first is pool together has just rolled out their v four. They wanted bankless audience to know about it. And this is like my number one, when somebody asks me what's the first thing I should use in DFI, I always refer to them to pull together. It's either uniswap or pull together. But I do this because this is a no loss lottery, right? So they can't get angry at me if they lose anything. Because they won't lose something by depositing their funds into pool together. You put USDC in.
00:01:57.330 - 00:02:25.382, Speaker A: It's fun, easy to use user interface. Just connect, metamask and boom, you're in a lotto where you can only win. There's no loss in the principle, they generate the earnings based on prizes that are pushed out to the platform and based on the yield the assets are earning. So it's like another way to save. It's like a high interest lotto savings account, actually. And their v four has even more prizes. Also, it's whale proof.
00:02:25.382 - 00:02:55.666, Speaker A: It's really friendly for the smaller minnows, only depositing smaller amounts of money there's near zero transaction fees too, because the hack is you can now deposit into pulled together using polygon and not have to pay ETH gas fees. And they're launching with a million dollars in prizes. So really cool to see this. I've won the lotto before. I don't know if you've ever won the lotto in pulled together, but it's like a magic feeling. You go and you check and you're like, oh, my God, I won this week. Isn't that awesome?
00:02:55.768 - 00:03:08.334, Speaker B: Yeah. If you ever wanted to check the box of winning the lottery, pulled together might be the best way that you can add that to your instagram bio or maybe your tinder bio. Just let the people know that you won the lottery.
00:03:08.402 - 00:03:28.714, Speaker A: You should not tell anyone you win the lottery. If you win the lottery, it's a recipe for too many acquaintances calling you up and wanting things. Anyway, guys, check that out. That's at bankless cc slash pool together and jump in the pool with us, David. All right, all time high week. You ready to get to markets?
00:03:28.762 - 00:03:49.778, Speaker B: Let's absolutely do it. It is all time high week for bitcoin. We crossed the previous all time high of $63,500, setting a new all time high of $67,100, taking a little bit of a tumble back down to $63,200, but still broke the all time highs.
00:03:49.954 - 00:03:55.250, Speaker A: That's big, man. That's big. So last previous all time high, if I recall correctly, was sometime in April.
00:03:55.330 - 00:03:58.838, Speaker B: April 13, 191 days ago.
00:03:59.004 - 00:04:30.942, Speaker A: So bitcoin holders, through this whole bull run, they've had to be very patient because they've watched all of these other assets pump since April. In particular, we had this alt layer one summer. We had sort of a DFI 20 kind of resurgence as well. And bitcoin holders, if you are a bitcoin holder, you've been waiting patiently for this time to come. The big news was going to be the ETF, right? And here it is. It happened this week, and that's why we're seeing the bitcoin pump. Does that explain all of this, David.
00:04:31.086 - 00:05:00.910, Speaker B: I think that a broader question that I want to ask is, like, we went through all time high where we are now, 191 days ago, 27 weeks ago. Then we went through, like, this period where bitcoin just got slammered with FUd after FUd after slammered. China Fud, energy fud, ESG, Fud, like regulation Fud. And it took a beating. It went all the way. How low did it get? Like 29,026, 7000 or something before returning back to. Back to all time highs.
00:05:00.910 - 00:05:23.646, Speaker B: And so, pretty crazy, right? And what is it, 27 weeks, half of a year? There's always the conversation about bitcoin goes in cycles. Was that a mini cycle? Was that a full cycle? Does it even matter as a cycle to talk about? Did we just go through a full seasonality cycle? I don't really know. Important story is we are back at all time highs.
00:05:23.758 - 00:05:54.126, Speaker A: Yeah. I guess what that means as well is bitcoin is rising up the ranks in terms of global currency. So it just passed the swiss franc in terms of value. Total value. Bitcoin, total outstanding supply is more valuable than total outstanding swiss franc. So it's the 13th largest world currency by market cap at this point in time. Unbelievable, right? What are we, twelve years, 13 years into this experiment at the same time? That makes it feel so low?
00:05:54.228 - 00:05:54.734, Speaker B: I feel like.
00:05:54.772 - 00:05:55.182, Speaker A: Does it?
00:05:55.236 - 00:05:59.546, Speaker B: That's it. Like, bitcoin's only beyond. Only number 13.
00:05:59.738 - 00:06:11.886, Speaker A: Friends, we are early. We're still early. Right. It's going to be moving up these charts. Let's talk about something else that is moving up the charts, and that is the price of Eth this week. So Eth had a good week. Not quite ready to call the all time high, though, David.
00:06:11.886 - 00:06:22.774, Speaker A: We wanted to so much, but we're not there. We just touched it, right? Like, barely touched it. Almost got there, but not quite. What is eth right now? And what was the previous all time high?
00:06:22.812 - 00:06:49.182, Speaker B: Yeah, currently clocking in at $4,100. We started the week at $3,800, and the previous all time high was $75, higher than what is being reported on Coinbase. It always changes depending on which exchange you're looking at. Previous high was 4375 ish dollars. And so. Oh, look, we actually got closer than I thought, so we missed it by 20 ish dollars, give or take. But interestingly, ether was up 14.5%
00:06:49.182 - 00:06:56.334, Speaker B: on the week, whereas bitcoin was only up 11% on the week. On the week that bitcoin had the ETF announcement, which is kind of. Kind of interesting.
00:06:56.532 - 00:07:30.394, Speaker A: Good news for bitcoin is good news for ETH as well. Right? So people are just asking like, well, if bitcoin's going with an ETF, then when ETH ETF, it's got to be happening. And it is rising up the charts as well. We don't have a global currency chart open, but we do have this. Ethereum is now larger than all of the world's global banks. Okay, so it just passed in terms of market JP Morgan in market cap. I've been watching this for a while just because, look, this is bankless and Ethereum is kind of the bankless money platform for the world.
00:07:30.394 - 00:07:40.686, Speaker A: And now it just passed the largest bank in the world. I don't know that they know this is going on, but it's happening. It's picking them off one by one. Yeah.
00:07:40.708 - 00:07:55.774, Speaker B: Do they understand that Ethereum is actually a banking competitor to them? It's pretty cool that Ethereum is bigger than the world's largest bank, but I think the bigger land milestone is when Ethereum is bigger than all of the banks combined. That, I think is the real time to celebrate.
00:07:55.902 - 00:08:06.870, Speaker A: Well, let's talk about the bitcoin to ETH chart, shall we? So bitcoin and ETH always in this tug of war and in this tension. What are we looking at on the bitcoin to ETH ratio this week?
00:08:06.940 - 00:08:09.322, Speaker B: Yeah, it was flat on the week.
00:08:09.456 - 00:08:10.442, Speaker A: A little bit up.
00:08:10.496 - 00:08:38.306, Speaker B: Started at zero 64, currently at zero 65. But it's also looking at that pattern, you see that again, lower, higher lows getting painted over the course of the last roughly 200 ish days or so. Again, interesting to see ether, especially in the last two days, really run up against bitcoin after the news of the bitcoin ETF. So interesting dynamics, the ether bitcoin ratio. Really putting up a fight.
00:08:38.408 - 00:08:55.478, Speaker A: Do you know what I tweeted out this morning? Because I genuinely feel this way. I have not been previously at the point of saying the flipping of ether exceeding bitcoin market cap is inevitable. But now I feel like I'm at that point.
00:08:55.644 - 00:08:56.226, Speaker B: What changed?
00:08:56.258 - 00:09:21.022, Speaker A: It's going to happen. Well, I mean, I had a high confidence interval probably at the beginning of the year that that would happen. Call it 80%. What changed is ETH became ultrasound money. That narrative stuck. EIP 15, five nine, where we're burning ETh every single week, every single block, every single day, every single week. Okay? The ETH as an Internet bond has taken hold.
00:09:21.022 - 00:09:57.834, Speaker A: Talking to institutional investors in the way we have, they're all buying ETH, okay? It's being recognized as a reserve asset. Now we have the merge coming, and I have incredibly high confidence that that is going to be shipped. Last year at this time, none of the things I mentioned had happened. All right? That's where I was like 80% confident that ETH would flip in bitcoin. Now I'm like closer to 100%. I think it is inevitable. Now we've just seen probably the most bullish thing that bitcoin has in store, short of another country maybe adopting bitcoin in some way, which is the ETF, right.
00:09:57.834 - 00:10:15.570, Speaker A: That's kind of the news that everyone is waiting for, and it's up, but it's not up that much compared to ETH. So I'm kind of ready to state that. I know you've been more bullish. You're always like, yeah, it's going to happen 100%. And now I'm feeling like very close to 100% as well.
00:10:15.640 - 00:11:07.266, Speaker B: I think there's some things to unpack here. First off, I actually think that this ETF is not the ETF that should make you bullish because it's a futures based ETF. And we'll unpack that what that means later in the episode, but as opposed to a spot based ETF, where actually demand of the ETF actually creates buying pressure on the spot markets. And so there's something to unpack there. Also, this is just the beginning of the bitcoin ETF story. And overall, I think really meaningful bitcoin price appreciation is going to happen when the bridge of the ETF actually translates towards more and more companies actually putting bitcoin exposure on their balance sheets. And so while it's just like the first week of the bitcoin ETF, a lot of institutions are not yet moving their money to do that, but they definitely will in the future.
00:11:07.266 - 00:11:16.466, Speaker B: And so my take here is that bitcoin didn't react so strongly to this ETF other than breaking all time highs, still pretty strong.
00:11:16.568 - 00:11:18.530, Speaker A: That's good. In and of itself, it's good, but.
00:11:18.600 - 00:12:23.934, Speaker B: There'S just speculation as like, all right, when does this meaningfully actually change the fundamentals of bitcoin? Is it like right now, or is it in the future when these institutions actually come and start using this product? And I will also say I'm also very bullish on the merge, but I think there's going to be a similar game being played as does ether really move up against bitcoin right before the merge, or really, is it going to happen maybe up to a year or two years down the line after the lack of issuance from proof of stake actually does show up in the market because remember, where bitcoin has institutions putting it on its balance sheet, ether has just like, not issuing any ether and actually being ultrasound money. Ethereum. Because of the concept of ultrasound money, the combination of burning transaction fees and minimizing the amount of ether issuance counts as, like, we get as many grayscales as bitcoin has every single year, like recycle. So it's almost like Ethereum flipping bitcoin. It is definitely like on a timer, because Ethereum as a protocol just gets to generate its own grayscales, like putting ether on the balance sheet. Anyways, there's a lot of dynamics to unpack with the flipping.
00:12:24.002 - 00:12:51.458, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. And I'm not going to call a timeline on it, I'm just calling a probability of flipping has gone way up. Whether that happens before the merge, after the merge, sometime in the next three to five years, I'm not sure. I just think it's going to happen. More bitcoin ETF discussion, too. We should have that when we get to news because I feel like the big thing is actually the narrative is actually the US government saying, okay, guys, you can have your bitcoin ETF now. We won't stop you from having that.
00:12:51.458 - 00:13:05.078, Speaker A: Anyway, let's talk about another all time high, David, which is something we've been waiting for for the entire year. And that is DFI pulse, the total locked value in DFI. What did we just hit, David? The magic number, $100 billion.
00:13:05.164 - 00:13:20.074, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure we said it was going to happen last week. We definitely did. And now we said we wanted it to happen. We said we wanted to happen. Yeah. Clocking in at $100 billion locked in DFI. And then the DPi, the Mod has $345.
00:13:20.074 - 00:13:25.194, Speaker B: So the DFI token is not following the amount of value locked inside of their applications.
00:13:25.322 - 00:13:32.282, Speaker A: Look at this. Where were we? Let's see, 2020 this time last year. Look at this, David.
00:13:32.426 - 00:13:35.602, Speaker B: 22,000,000,005 x in a year.
00:13:35.736 - 00:13:53.254, Speaker A: Yeah. And that was right after D five summer. It's pretty impressive. And if you go back before DFI summer, nothing. Do you remember when we talked to like cute little numbers, Vance Spencer from framework and like, total locked value is like, I don't know, 5 billion or something. Yeah.
00:13:53.292 - 00:13:57.880, Speaker B: Didn't he make some insane prediction about how there's going to be a hundred billion dollars locked in?
00:13:58.650 - 00:14:00.038, Speaker A: We asked him for the run.
00:14:00.124 - 00:14:08.314, Speaker B: Yeah. And we were like, wow, Vance, are you allowed to be that bullish? Is that legal? Is that a legal amount of bullishness? Yeah.
00:14:08.432 - 00:14:25.982, Speaker A: Turns out he got pumping everything. Stop pumping everything, Vance. But he called it and we're not stopping here. I mean, doesn't look like the bull run is showing any signs of stopping. Speaking of which, let's talk about DPI. This is the top DFI tokens. What are we looking at on the week?
00:14:26.036 - 00:14:37.374, Speaker B: We don't have to talk too much about it? It's a very flat number. It started the week at like roughly $340. It went up to 365, and now we're back at $345. So flat ish.
00:14:37.502 - 00:14:44.134, Speaker A: It's funny. Like, some DFI 20 tokens, so called, are making a run, but the blue chip DFI tokens are not.
00:14:44.172 - 00:15:03.706, Speaker B: Right now, that's a really good important point. I think we might be actually able to make the claim that the DPI is actually not tracking all of DFI because there's a lot of new protocols that have done extremely well recently. Rari capital, Olympus, Dow, that aren't included in the DPi. Can you double check and make sure that's true? Can you scroll down and look at the holdings?
00:15:03.818 - 00:15:08.638, Speaker A: Oh, I'm pretty sure that's true because many of these tokens are, like, too young, basically.
00:15:08.724 - 00:15:13.630, Speaker B: Yeah, too young. Yeah. So younger DFI is outpacing older DFI.
00:15:13.790 - 00:15:18.114, Speaker A: Yeah, catch up, old man. Come on, let's talk about.
00:15:18.232 - 00:15:31.314, Speaker B: We don't have to. The east DPI ratio is getting slaughtered at zero 80. Oh, my God. I'm moving my flow of my bottom call from 00:13 to 00:13 don't make calls anymore.
00:15:31.362 - 00:15:48.762, Speaker A: Dude, stop calling the bottom, okay? There is no bottom right here. Well, look, ETH is just looking really strong, particularly against these blue chip DFI tokens. And I don't know when that's going to change. I think it will eventually, but it's not looking that way right now.
00:15:48.816 - 00:15:59.120, Speaker B: In the traditional stock market, we're used to indexes going up against the dollar. But I guess in DeFi, we see indexes going down versus ether just because ETH is ultrasound money.
00:15:59.970 - 00:16:26.630, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I think to be fair, what you have to actually do in crypto is something like ETH should be your denominator. For me personally, it's my denominator. It's not actually us dollars and it's not bitcoin. I know some crypto folks denominate everything in bitcoin. I don't personally, I denominate in ETH. And so when I'm making an investment outside of ether, I ask myself, do I expect this investment to appreciate versus ETH, not against dollars.
00:16:26.630 - 00:16:49.742, Speaker A: Dollars is easy, man. It's easy. Come on. But can you actually appreciate and realize gains versus ETH is the question? And DFI did for a long time. It hasn't recently. Let's talk about the way you can't lose, though, which is you buy all three, you buy bitcoin, you buy ETH, and you buy DPi. In equal 30, 30, 30.
00:16:49.742 - 00:16:55.934, Speaker A: Sorry. A third, a third, a third split. This is the bankless bed index. What are we looking at on the week?
00:16:55.972 - 00:17:07.202, Speaker B: David started the week at $155, hit a high, a new all time high at $186, in line with all time high season, currently clocking in at $174.
00:17:07.336 - 00:17:22.966, Speaker A: Oh, that's nice. Hitting all so bitcoin, all time high, total locked value in DFI. All time high bed index, all time high. And just like 20, I don't know, $22 off ETH all time high. So we're doing it. Oh, another all time high. Layer two beat.
00:17:22.966 - 00:17:34.030, Speaker A: The total locked value in DFI is also all time high in this October season. This all time high week. What are we looking at in total locked value in L2?
00:17:34.100 - 00:17:57.074, Speaker B: Clocking in at $4 billion. So nice to see that four number there. I think this is just going to be another following the total locked in DFI marching up to $100 billion. So some of the leaders this week, arbitram, DyDX, optimism, all individually up about 8%. Loopering, clocking in at plus 15% at 130,000,000. Nice job.
00:17:57.192 - 00:18:17.674, Speaker A: Arbitrum got 60% dominance right now. DyDX coming in second place with 22%. But this is so early, like, this is not even the first inning of the game here. But this is a chart to watch over the next twelve months for sure, as things shake out. Token terminal. Let's talk about this man. This is a story of EIP 15 five nine.
00:18:17.674 - 00:18:28.558, Speaker A: Another reason I'm bullish. ETH and bullish on the flipping. Look at this. Users of Ethereum have paid $1 billion in transaction fees over the past 30 days.
00:18:28.644 - 00:18:39.246, Speaker B: Okay, so think about that. Ethereum, as a protocol, has received $1 billion worth of revenue. If you look at Ethereum, like a business that has sustainable economics.
00:18:39.358 - 00:18:40.610, Speaker A: Ethereum billion a month.
00:18:40.680 - 00:18:42.482, Speaker B: Billion a month. A billion a month.
00:18:42.616 - 00:19:03.206, Speaker A: Not too bad. And here's the part that where EIP 15 five nine comes in, people used to say, well, so that's all going to miners. Well, no, it's not. 83%. Almost 83% of that was burned. That's almost a billion dollars. 824,000,000 was actually burnt and returned to ETH holders.
00:19:03.206 - 00:19:11.930, Speaker A: So remember, this is as if every time Apple sells an iPhone, a portion of its stock is burnt.
00:19:12.590 - 00:19:14.442, Speaker B: Percent of the value of an iPhone gets burnt.
00:19:14.506 - 00:19:43.910, Speaker A: 83%, right. What is that worth? Even from a ignore the ultrasound money case, I suppose, or the reserve currency monetary premium case, just from a discounted cash flow. If you're viewing this as ether as you would a stock, it is supremely undervalued, even at this valuation, and it's just crazy to see. So look, we got room to run, David. That's what I think. Go ahead.
00:19:43.980 - 00:20:01.694, Speaker B: Yeah. Last time that ETh hit these current prices, here's a nice little summary tweet. Last time ETh hit 4k, EIP 15559 was not live. Ether issuance was roughly 57% higher. 2.3 billion. Ether were not.
00:20:01.694 - 00:20:21.250, Speaker B: Burnt optimism and arbitrum were not launched. NFT volume had not done like an insane forex. And then ETH staked in 2.0 was literally half the amount it is right now. And total locked value in DFI was 20% lower. So nice summary of where we were just about 27 weeks ago in Ethereum land.
00:20:21.400 - 00:20:48.458, Speaker A: Almost 3 trillion. That's the total value of all of crypto. And do you remember when Vitalik asked this in 2017? That question of have we earned it? Right, we're almost at a trillion dollars back then. Have we earned it? And his answer was implicitly, no. This time I feel like not all of crypto, but I'm talking specifically about ether, maybe some other assets as well. The question of have we earned it, I feel like is a resounding yes. Right.
00:20:48.458 - 00:21:15.890, Speaker A: Just look at the cash flows that blocks based demand is generating right now, and look at all of the development and the path forward, and it feels like this is the beginning once again of a bull run. And not like, oh, maybe we're kind of the midpoint, I suppose, but it's not over yet. In my opinion, none of this is financial advice. Of course, let's talk about polygon as well, because they're hitting some big numbers. What's this number?
00:21:16.040 - 00:21:27.350, Speaker B: 100 million unique active addresses on polygon. So congratulations on the Polygon team. And with one of the big stories coming out later in the roll up, it's going to be obvious as to why Polygon has done so well.
00:21:27.500 - 00:21:36.762, Speaker A: It's relieving some traffic from the main chain, which is great as well. Look, Elon Musk once again summed it up, the meme master, I guess. What are we looking at here?
00:21:36.816 - 00:21:57.970, Speaker B: Yeah, Elon Musk. The markets were so hot this week that Elon Musk tweeted out this meme of just a guy and a girl. Obviously a couple of guys, like, hugging the shit, excuse me, hugging his girlfriend really, really hard. And they are together watching a tv on the wall where bitcoin is priced at $69,000 and ether is priced at $4,200. So, Elon Musk, the meme lord. Nice job.
00:21:58.120 - 00:22:14.566, Speaker A: Just a romantic night. What are you doing? You're not watching Netflix. You're just watching the price of bitcoin and eth go up. It's been one of those weeks, guys. We will be right back with some of the hot releases of the week and after that news. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:22:14.668 - 00:23:07.398, Speaker B: Matcha, everyone's favorite deck segregator, has just launched an open beta for gasless trading. So if you're trading more than $5,000 in common ETH and wrapped bitcoin pairs, then your gas fees on Matcha are free. And that's why you should be using matcha. Matcha routes your orders across all the various DFI exchanges on Ethereum Polygon finance smart chain and gives you the best possible price without any trading fees or unnecessary slippage. Matcha has smart order routing that splits your orders across multiple liquidity sources. If Matcha sees that, it gets you better pricing trading on Matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me into a single and easy to use platform and has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and getting a bad price. Matcha also allows you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defi trades and they will go through automatically while you're away.
00:23:07.398 - 00:23:47.714, Speaker B: So when you're making a trade, head over to Matcha XYz slash bankless. Connect your wallet and start getting some of the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets. Alchemyx is one of the coolest new defi apps on the scene. It introduces self paying loans, allowing you to spend and save at the same time. Deposit the DAI stablecoin into the Alchemyx vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates. Borrow up to 50% of the total amount of your deposited die in the form of Al USD stablecoin. Here's the craziest part, the loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated.
00:23:47.714 - 00:24:27.570, Speaker B: Unlock your assets potential in the ultimate DFI savings account, and brand new to alkmix is the eth vault, where you can deposit eth into the application. Borrow al eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time. V two is rapidly approaching, which will allow for even more collateral types, plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from. Harness the power of Alchemyx at Alchemyx F I that's A-L-C-H-E-M-I-X-F-I follow alchemyx on Twitter at alchemyx Fi and join the discord to keep up to date with Alchemyx V two and to get involved in governance.
00:24:27.990 - 00:24:45.170, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back after all time high week. Still in all time high week. Now we're talking about releases. This is the reason that we are getting to all time highs. So much is being built on top of Ethereum, on top of DFI, on top of all the protocols we talk about. Let's talk about future swap. Future swap is a perpetuals protocol.
00:24:45.170 - 00:24:48.390, Speaker A: They just went live on Mainnet. David, what's going on here?
00:24:48.460 - 00:25:00.570, Speaker B: Yeah, fun fact, this is a nice piece of ethereum trivia, but actually started off with the yield farming model before compound actually introduced it to the world. It was so successful that they had to shut down their contracts because so much money flooded in.
00:25:00.640 - 00:25:03.114, Speaker A: They were worried, right? They were worried too early.
00:25:03.232 - 00:25:21.746, Speaker B: Yeah, too much money came too fast into undity contracts. But that was a long time ago. We are now into the v four of future swap. So if you are a perpetuals trader and you want allegedly ten times more liquid markets with 30 times more capital efficiency and is fully composable, including exotic assets like nfts, future swap might be.
00:25:21.768 - 00:25:33.206, Speaker A: For you, exotic assets like nfts. I'm actually going to leverage trading punks that was available. Yeah, very cool. This is cool too. Ens just keeps getting better. That is, of course, eth. You know it well.
00:25:33.206 - 00:25:55.406, Speaker A: But if you have metamask and you type in a ETH domain name like in your browser window, as long as you have that metamask extension in your browser window and you put a slash at the end of it, it'll just load. So if you go to Vitalik eth, you have metamask slash, then what pops up? It's the decentralized version of Vitalik's website. I'm going to try this right now.
00:25:55.428 - 00:25:59.198, Speaker B: Yeah, let's do this. Actually, this works. Mine didn't work.
00:25:59.284 - 00:26:12.110, Speaker A: Look at this metamask. You're swearing ens. You might not be logged in. I don't know. And then boom. Where are we? This is an ipfs link to Vitalik's website, which is not loading. Laugh out loud.
00:26:12.270 - 00:26:13.700, Speaker B: Well, we're getting there.
00:26:14.150 - 00:26:22.470, Speaker A: I tried it earlier this week and it worked. But I think the redirect works for whatever reason, the link is down on. Oh, here it is. It was just slow, just a little slow.
00:26:22.810 - 00:26:27.734, Speaker B: IPFS is slower, decentralization is slow. That's how it works.
00:26:27.852 - 00:26:40.954, Speaker A: So permanent. So permanent. Very cool to see that. Addresses just keep getting better. This is really cool to see, too. David, have you ever tried to use a state website? Right? Try to register an LLC or C Corp or something like that.
00:26:40.992 - 00:26:42.394, Speaker B: Not if I can avoid it, no.
00:26:42.512 - 00:27:08.418, Speaker A: Try to pay your taxes or something. Anyway, these state websites are absolutely terrible. It's like they were developed in 2003 and then just, like, left. They probably have something on staff called, like a webmaster who just maintains the website. I mean, they're absolutely terrible. Every single state is like that. Anyway, one thing that's cool is the Wyoming website, state website, where you register a business, has just gotten updated.
00:27:08.418 - 00:27:49.220, Speaker A: It's gotten updated. And you see this one, you can register an LLC, you can register a nonprofit, you can register a corporation. What's this? You can also register a Dow, a decentralized autonomous organization. Hit that nice start now button with the hover. And it's very cool. Like Wyoming law now allows this bridge between dows and llcs and entities that are state recognized. And because, of course, the state of Wyoming recognizes a DAO, then that means the entire federal government of the United States recognizes a.
00:27:49.220 - 00:28:02.280, Speaker A: I haven't tried this, haven't done this. I know there are some things that are lacking from this kind of DAO registration, but just the fact that you can do this is a huge, massive step forward.
00:28:02.890 - 00:28:16.422, Speaker B: This always reminds me that crypto is this nebulous organism from space with a bunch of tentacles, and it's just like grabbing onto the real world in every single way possible. And now it's found its way to the real world via daos.
00:28:16.566 - 00:28:20.746, Speaker A: The crypto octopus has you in its tentacles. Wyoming. That's what's going on.
00:28:20.928 - 00:28:22.682, Speaker B: You are now part of the hive mind.
00:28:22.816 - 00:28:35.422, Speaker A: Yeah, connects as well. So this is a bridge protocol. We're really excited about these, but they just released an explorer, so you can kind of visualize this. David, this is loading up right now. But what are we looking at here in the connects dashboard?
00:28:35.486 - 00:29:11.926, Speaker B: Yeah, I think cross chain, cross l two volume transfers, like cross transfers of USDC ether, USDT Maddox. All these tokens is going to be really fun to watch because this economy is transparent and connects has done a fantastic job making a dashboard of all of these metrics. So you can view the cross chain l two world volume number of transactions, which chains are going to, what assets are being transferred, how much total liquidity there is, how much total volume has been transferred. So congratulations to Kinex for also cross chaining $100 million since going live with their protocol.
00:29:12.118 - 00:29:29.746, Speaker A: Yeah, that's huge guys. Okay, those have been the releases. Let's talk a bit about some of the raises this week. And I think the theme, David, is money is just rushing into this space. It's piling in. And it's not just piling in one area, right. It's not just like the protocols or the layer one level or the blockchain level.
00:29:29.746 - 00:30:06.714, Speaker A: It's saturating all of these different areas, areas we didn't even have a couple of years ago during the last bull cycle. So we got like at the protocol layer, investments are flying, the DFI layer investments are flying, new funds are being created, massive, like hundreds of millions of dollars. We've got crypto banks that are continuing to raise, we've got nfts, we've got even mining. There are all of these different pools of capital that are raising right now and maybe we should touch on a few. The first is from oball, so they just raised $6.15 million. And I think of this as it's making staking more decentralized.
00:30:06.714 - 00:30:15.566, Speaker A: There's some cool tech behind this, some cool crypto magic I would say. But that's at the protocol layer. And really cool to see this race.
00:30:15.678 - 00:30:58.282, Speaker B: Very deep down in the protocol layer. And the technology here is a shared secret validators, which allows you to split a validator key among multiple parties. Kind of like sharing the password for running a validating node with 32 ether in it. And this is really, really important for organizations like Lido that have not yet fully figured out how to protocolize the whole validator network that they have. And this is a very important puzzle piece for actually turning that into a completely trustless organization. Oh, the oval team actually got a grant from Lido $100,000 to help develop this technology. And this is something that we can also see rocket pool using and also overall just makes it easier to spin up a decentralized validating network.
00:30:58.282 - 00:31:02.974, Speaker B: So pretty cool innovation here. Congratulations to Colin Myers. He's been in this world for a while.
00:31:03.092 - 00:31:22.934, Speaker A: Yeah, he's definitely been in staking for a while. Polynomial is another a. I believe the characterization of like it's a one inch. It's an aggregator for all of the various DFI option protocols that are happening right now. They just raised $1.1 million to build out this one inch style marketplace. Kind of cool.
00:31:22.934 - 00:31:23.650, Speaker A: Any comments?
00:31:23.730 - 00:31:45.280, Speaker B: The options ecosystem on Ethereum is definitely like it needs to get built out. So it's really nice seeing these aggregators getting added into the whole options marketplace. I mean, options are very basic financial contract. Ethereum, it makes a ton of sense to have them on. Ethereum hasn't really seen the adoption that we've wanted to see it yet, but maybe it's something like an aggregator that is really what needed to happen to make this done.
00:31:45.970 - 00:32:25.034, Speaker A: The next one is element doing a big boy raise. Okay, so $32 million in a series A round led by polychain and a 16 z. But the valuation here is $320,000,000 for DFI protocol. And what these guys are doing is they're sort of splitting the principal in an interest rate and they're making it so that you can essentially get like a fixed rate. All of the DeFi loans you get from compound or aave, they're all variable rate. And element is changing it so that many of these things can be a fixed rate. But that's a big valuation and pretty impressive that they're able to command that.
00:32:25.034 - 00:32:29.930, Speaker A: Another ex consensus individual, I believe, behind this. Super exciting to see.
00:32:30.000 - 00:32:43.494, Speaker B: Yeah, we've had them on the show before. An old state of the nation. If you want to go find out more about element. Also really pioneering into a brand new governance model, which has gotten a lot of praise from people that I really like in this industry, like Mariana Conti.
00:32:43.642 - 00:33:13.386, Speaker A: I should mention that David and I are investors in all three of those protocols. Actually, we believe in them that much also. David, Polygon, they're getting a bitwise invest fund, so that is happening. Bitwise, of course, is the largest indexing, I suppose they're centralized, of course, but now they're launching a Polygon fund primarily to invest in polygon ecosystem of applications. What's happening here, basically it's just a.
00:33:13.408 - 00:33:48.466, Speaker B: Wrapper around the matic token and then making it available for institutional investors who want to invest in the. I mean, there's a ton of hype around Matic. There's a ton of growing adoption of matic. And so matic token in the same way that ether is a great tool to get exposure to basically everything that happens on Ethereum. Matic is simultaneously a great token to get exposure to everything that happens on matic. And now you can get that exposure. If you are a legacy tradfi boomer investor and just want bitwise to do all the hard work for you, there's actually going to be just like.
00:33:48.466 - 00:33:49.454, Speaker B: It's a great bridge.
00:33:49.582 - 00:34:14.382, Speaker A: It's better to do that than nothing, right? The worst thing you could do is just sit out of these markets for sure. So if you can't do a metamask then do this is what I say. Okay, so also some funds, David. So the first is variant. That's a fund we've been pretty excited about. We've had Jesse from variant on the podcast before. They just launched another $110,000,000 fund.
00:34:14.382 - 00:34:22.958, Speaker A: I think this is either their second or their third. They've also added some new talent whom we've also had on the podcast. Lee Jin, talk about that.
00:34:23.124 - 00:34:46.710, Speaker B: We actually had both of them on the podcast on a panel at the same time talking about the ownership economy. Also on that panel was Cooper Turley, who was an advisor for the invariant fund. So now all these three friends are just now running a fund together, focusing on building out the creator owner economy. And so they have always been bullish on this industry. So congratulations to the variant fund just becoming an absolute giant.
00:34:47.390 - 00:35:12.682, Speaker A: Galaxy Digital Interactive is also raising 325,000,000 as well. David, any comments on this? Another fund, a 16 z polychain, continues to raise all of multicoin as well. There's so many, we can't even list them all, but everyone is raised. All of these funds are raising money, and they're doing that on the back of these massive successes. And he takes on this Galaxy race.
00:35:12.746 - 00:35:29.734, Speaker B: Yeah, Galaxy is, of course, Mike Novogratz fund, who has been as bullish as anyone on this base and also been here for a while beating the same drum. We're big fans of Mike Novogratz. If anyone knows him and can get him on the show, please connect us. We've been trying. Anyways, moving on.
00:35:29.852 - 00:35:45.610, Speaker A: Answer our emails, Mike. Just do that. The crypto banks are raising, too. Look at this, David. $420,000,000. And this is a memetic number. $420,690,000 from 69 investors.
00:35:45.610 - 00:36:15.154, Speaker A: This is FTX raising at a $25 billion valuation. So SBF just continues to grow. Pretty Incredible raises here. Not surprising that FTX is now worth 25 billion. So, like, Coinbase is, I don't know, 60 billion ish, 70. Yeah, I don't know what finance is. I heard rumor that finance was trying to raise at one point in time earlier this year at $300 billion, which seems a little bit rich, but, like, big money.
00:36:15.154 - 00:36:19.798, Speaker A: I mean, these are some of the largest banks in the world now, and they're crypto banks. Pretty crazy.
00:36:19.884 - 00:36:42.202, Speaker B: How funny was it that we were last week talking about how Sam self reportedly doesn't really believe in crypto and he just has the most nihilistic number of a raise for his company at $420,690,000 from 69 investors? He's in the right industry to do that. But come on, you have ftx behind you. Can you take the thing seriously, please?
00:36:42.336 - 00:37:02.882, Speaker A: It's memes all the way down, David, you know this. So, yeah, good for them on that raise. The crypto banks continue to raise and they're all in a competition to raise funds and increase their value. Of course, there's so many raises, David, you and I can't even keep up. Look, candy digital just raised a casual, no clue who these are. It's an NFT startup. Okay, so look at this line.
00:37:02.882 - 00:37:23.100, Speaker A: NFT startup, candy Digital raises $100 million in a series A round. Okay, so it's a group we've not heard of, it's a startup, and they're raising $100 million at a $1.5 billion valuation like a unicorn, insta unicorn by their series a. How is this happening?
00:37:23.710 - 00:37:52.660, Speaker B: Softbank, I think, might be the answer there. They're involved. But yeah, one thing to take away from this is the NFT industry is so incredibly large that things are happening that even the crypto community isn't being aware of. This is like part of the NFT world that's just invisible to us because it's so many people that just are not connected to us. Or the other take is that damn things are getting real frothy. People are raising way too much, way too early. Maybe both are true.
00:37:53.030 - 00:38:17.190, Speaker A: Both might be true. Peyton Manning was in on this one, if not some of the crypto natives that we kind of know. But that's what's going on. Like, NFTs are going mainstream. The last raise we'll mention here as a category is the mining category, and this is a mining company called Stronghold. They just raised $127,000,000 in an IPO. Absolutely insane.
00:38:17.190 - 00:38:49.814, Speaker A: Astounding. Look, man, how much did we just cover? And I bet we covered like ten to 15% of the raises that happened this week. But it's happening across like funds, crypto banks, NFT market, DFI, base level protocols, mining companies. It's happening not just in crypto. There are all of these subcategories that now have multi unicorn level companies inside of them, wrapped around them. That's how big crypto has gotten in the last 18 months or so.
00:38:49.932 - 00:38:52.360, Speaker B: And that's just the ones that we know about.
00:38:52.810 - 00:38:59.474, Speaker A: Exactly. One thing we do know, of course, is this is the weekly reminder for you to get a job in crypto.
00:38:59.522 - 00:39:00.438, Speaker B: Get a job.
00:39:00.604 - 00:39:14.798, Speaker A: Get a job. Crypto. Guys, I know some people listen when we say this, David, because not a week goes by that I don't hear from somebody who's like, oh, I listened to what you said. I actually got a job in crypto. Thank you very much for that.
00:39:14.964 - 00:39:16.522, Speaker B: Thank you for the kick in the butt.
00:39:16.666 - 00:39:33.902, Speaker A: Kick in the butt. Sometimes that's what you need, right? Or an opportunity to explore. And we have the bankless jobs board where you can explore some of the opportunities that bankless has listed. I'll mention a few. A CTO from. Thank you. Thank you, David.
00:39:33.902 - 00:40:07.194, Speaker A: General counsel at Smartdefi Finance and operations guru at Smart DeFi as well. Senior backend engineer. You can also be a blockchain CTO at Merit, a community manager at Argon, a founding blockchain engineer at highlight, and a senior software engineer at popcorn or community lead course. A senior front end web developer is open as well. That's not even like a fraction of all of the job opportunities that we have on this board. Some people from the Ethereum foundation, they're hiring a team lead. Some people from Gauntlet, we've had them on the podcast.
00:40:07.194 - 00:40:26.866, Speaker A: Everybody is on this board. Go check out the board. Go scroll if there's a job that fits your skill set and description, something that piques your interest, and then go hit the subscribe button so you see updates and we don't have to remind you. Every week you actually get an email when a new job launches that you might be interested in, you can just.
00:40:26.888 - 00:40:36.306, Speaker B: Get these automated reminders to get a job. No one comes into crypto gets a job in crypto, and he's like, I regret. Just like, just let that be known.
00:40:36.418 - 00:40:45.354, Speaker A: It does not happen. Has not happened. Never met a single person. Impossible. Absolutely. Okay, guys, now let's get to the main event news items. David, let's start here, man.
00:40:45.354 - 00:41:05.250, Speaker A: Bitcoin ETF. This is history. It's been eight years in the making. All right. The Winklevoss twins, all the way back in 2013, they started this. They first applied for a bitcoin ETF in 2013, hoping that the market was ready to get some retail exposure to etfs. Didn't happen.
00:41:05.250 - 00:41:15.654, Speaker A: Year after year after year. Didn't happen. Eight years later, it finally happened. Okay, so walk us through this, David. What's going on with this new bitcoin ETF? What is it?
00:41:15.692 - 00:41:30.242, Speaker B: Yeah, the pro shares bito futures based bitcoin ETF using the CME for the price reference rate. And so congratulations. We finally got the bitcoin ETF. Yay.
00:41:30.386 - 00:41:31.730, Speaker A: How happy are you about that?
00:41:31.740 - 00:41:46.350, Speaker B: There's a big asterisk. There's a big difference between a futures based ETF and a spot based ETF. And while we are happy that we have a bitcoin ETF, the game is not up. It's just the start, because.
00:41:46.420 - 00:41:47.646, Speaker A: Okay, what's the difference?
00:41:47.828 - 00:42:07.506, Speaker B: Okay, so bitcoin futures offered by the CME, they have monthly contracts that end at the end of every single month. The last day of the month or the last trading day of the month. I think that's how it works. And so there's one for October that'll be up in like ten ish days. There's one for. What's the month that comes after November? December, January. For the next six months.
00:42:07.506 - 00:43:07.446, Speaker B: It's a rolling six months. And then there's also the next December and then also the December after that. So you can pick which date do you want to make your bet about the future price of bitcoin. Sounds good, right? And there was recently a report that was submitted to the SEC saying that the onshore CME futures markets are actually driving the price discovery of bitcoin over the spot markets, which I'm a little bit confused about, but I'll take it on faith, because people who write that reports know way more than me. The problem with this as an ETF model is that the way that the ETF works is that it tracks the price of the next coming futures exchange. So if it was like November 2, right, the ETF would be tracking the futures price of the next month, and it would be rolling into every single. As the contracts, the futures contracts settle because it settles once a month, every month, it rolls into the next futures month.
00:43:07.446 - 00:43:55.842, Speaker B: And so there's this thing called Contango, where there's actually a discrepancy between the bitcoin futures price of month one to month two. So, like, say, for example, the bitcoin futures of month one is clocking in at $60,000. And then the next month, people futures traders have predicted that it's going to be $62,000. The ETF will sell all of the $60,000 valuations of bitcoin into $62,000 valuations of bitcoin, and they will actually lose shares along the way. Of course, this can actually happen in reverse. So in theory, it cancels out over time. But really what this does is this allows a bunch of middlemen and traders who want to take advantage of this arbitrage opportunity to just kind of milk out just the leakage of value out of this ETF.
00:43:55.842 - 00:44:06.234, Speaker B: Right. So do you know how to trade around terms like Contango? Is that something that you know how to do, because if not, other people do and other people are taking advantage of.
00:44:06.272 - 00:44:49.786, Speaker A: But you basically, all you have to do is the value of an ETF is that it's in a brokerage, right? So it's in somebody's Schwab account, their fidelity account. They don't have to open up coinbase, they just buy it with all their other stocks and they buy the ETF. But what you're saying is, because it's a futures ETF and not a spot ETF, it's less capital efficient for them to do so, and it's more expensive for them to do so versus a spot ETF. Right. The best thing you can do, of course, is get over the hump, go open an account at Gemini or Coinbase and just buy spot market and let them custody it and then graduate into going bankless. That's the best thing you can do. But if you're locked into a retirement account, an ETF is the second best.
00:44:49.786 - 00:45:04.254, Speaker A: The problem is this ETF is a futures based ETF. It's not a spot based ETF. And so it's more expensive for you. You're actually losing money versus buying bitcoin in a spot market on something like Coinbase. Is that right?
00:45:04.292 - 00:45:56.506, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right. So if you are interested in just buying and holding BTC bitcoin on your traditional brokerage, this is actually just not. You're going to lose money over time than if you had just bought actual bitcoin. And so that actually just puts people that actually compliantly can't go actually buy bitcoin at a disadvantage because they have to pay all these fees, all these traders, their arbitrage opportunities, where they could have just done a spot driven market. And the very important difference about a spot driven market is that when people buy a spot driven market ETF, that ETF goes out and buys bitcoin and puts it on the balance sheet, right? There's actually bitcoin there. And so actual ETF demand is actual bitcoin demand. And so this whole futures based ETF, if it has a ton of demand, it might not actually translate to actual bitcoin demand, or at least it will, but it won't be immediate.
00:45:56.538 - 00:45:57.454, Speaker A: In a roundabout way.
00:45:57.492 - 00:46:18.870, Speaker B: In a very roundabout way. And really, that roundaboutness puts money into the hands of intermediaries and scalpers. And when it comes to the SEC, who approved this, by the way, what is their job? Their job is to protect investors. And so they are just shoveling investors into the place that they just get scalped. Like, what the hell, dude?
00:46:20.170 - 00:46:58.894, Speaker A: It's not the best ETF. Absolutely right. I mean, the thing that they could have done is just approved a spot bitcoin ETF. I guess the argument is that this is a step in that direction and this is a more gated, regulator friendly type approval because they know all of the intermediaries, all of the incumbents that are doing this. So I guess it's a big deal that they did approve it, right. That is a step in and of itself that the government came and said, okay, fine, you can have your bitcoin ETF after eight years of retail asking for it. The question is how long will it take them to get to a spot ETF, which is much more.
00:46:58.894 - 00:47:01.714, Speaker A: Are we going to have to wait another eight years? God, I hope not.
00:47:01.752 - 00:47:06.594, Speaker B: Are they going to use this as like a defense? Like, we already gave you your ETF. Why do you need another one?
00:47:06.712 - 00:47:37.360, Speaker A: Also, I really want an ETH ETF. I mean, if we have bitcoin ETF, then where's our ETH ETF? That should be coming down the pike, too. So it's kind of like it's good news, but it's also a little bit like, come on, we could do better, can't we? I hope this is just the first step. One thing that sec tweeted out shortly before approving this, this is the week before, I guess is a reminder. Before investing in a fund that holds bitcoin futures contracts, make sure you carefully wear way the potential risks and benefits.
00:47:38.930 - 00:47:42.222, Speaker B: This is the tweet that tipped everyone off. Like, oh my gosh, there's an ETF coming.
00:47:42.276 - 00:47:57.670, Speaker A: Yay. I just think that there are some hidden risks and hidden costs that this type of structure doesn't actually tell you about. And it would be nice if those were acknowledged as well in this kind of a warning.
00:47:58.090 - 00:48:11.798, Speaker B: I think in summary, we can zoom out and say, oh, the ETF that got approved is the one. That is exactly what the incumbents and the current institutions would want the most and benefits them the most. Shocker. Weird.
00:48:11.894 - 00:48:36.450, Speaker A: But this makes sense because regulators know the incumbents. They know how to regulate them. They know how to put the stranglehold on them if they need to. And all of these new entrants are outside of their control, right? So they feel much less comfortable. So who are they going to let do it? They're going to let kind of their friends, the existing organizations whom they already regulate, do mean. But we want spot. We want spot.
00:48:36.870 - 00:49:01.346, Speaker B: We want spot. We want spot. Grayscale wants right. So Grayscale has made a big ETF push, filing to turn their GBTC fund into a BTC. And the ticker name filed for ticker name, BTC ETF. And so they are taking this opportunity to. They took opportunity by the horns and they are now making a very political move, saying like, hey, give us a spot market.
00:49:01.346 - 00:49:04.134, Speaker B: Give us a spot market. So more power to Grayscale.
00:49:04.262 - 00:49:31.666, Speaker A: Well, it's interesting. It puts regulators in this position where they're kind of kingmaking, right? It's like, we're going to approve these etfs, but not these etfs. Right? And so what's the set of criteria by which they'll approve someone's ETF? And I think that's where Grayscale is like, hey, people are buying our trust anyway. We have massive amounts of bitcoin inside of this thing. Why not just make this an ETF? Let's make it official. All right, David, second news item of the day is the Coinbase NFT platform. We talked about it.
00:49:31.666 - 00:50:05.870, Speaker A: We mentioned it last time that it was coming. That was the news last week. The news this week is that we have more details on this. Let me rattle a few more details coming out because this could be absolutely massive, I think, in the NFT space, as far as mainstreaming nfts, even that much more, the Coinbase NFT platform will be open, so it's not going to be an invite only platform. Okay. We do know that. We also know that the Coinbase NFT platform will rely on decentralized storage solutions like ipfs rather than centralized service.
00:50:05.870 - 00:50:32.998, Speaker A: So clap, clap, clap. More decentralized, better. You can mint nfts on Coinbase and sell them anywhere else. Okay, so they're not going to do this weird lock in that maybe some other platforms do, maybe a flow, I don't know, list any non Coinbase NFTs as well. So they're opening this thing up. Another smart move, I think you will be able to use different currencies and different wallet solutions. They're not going to lock you into the Coinbase proprietary wallet App Store experience.
00:50:32.998 - 00:50:49.930, Speaker A: Thank God. Also, Coinbase NFT is going to start with support for Ethereum. Good move. Also plans to support minting in markets across other chains as well. Look, that's all good news. This makes them a bit more like Opensea, I think.
00:50:50.000 - 00:50:54.486, Speaker B: Custodial Opensea. That's basically what it is, a custodial opensea.
00:50:54.518 - 00:51:18.174, Speaker A: And I don't know, I think you'll have the option to do it custodially or noncustodially it sounds like as well, I think a lot of this minting is going to happen directly on Ethereum. I don't know. The Coinbase wallet is non custody as well, so I don't know about custody versus non custody. They'll definitely have a fiat bridge, as we talked about last week, which will give them an advantage too, even if they're non custodial.
00:51:18.222 - 00:51:34.250, Speaker B: It's really the custodial nature of this that is the actual value add. Right. Because we actually don't have a custodial NFT platform and there's just going to be so many more people who are ready to want to get into NFTs but don't really care about crypto. And look, Coinbase is a solution for them.
00:51:34.320 - 00:51:51.390, Speaker A: I think the value add is just making this easy. Right? They provided the easy button for bitcoin. You'd buy it back in 2013, 2014, and they did that for ETH. Now they're doing that for NFTs, which is a good move. And they're also mainstreaming it. So this is a breaking announcement last week.
00:51:51.460 - 00:51:51.886, Speaker B: Huge.
00:51:51.988 - 00:52:31.226, Speaker A: Okay. Coinbase is now partnering with the NBA women's NBA league as well, like all of the subsidiary NBA. And I believe, David, though, correct me if I'm wrong, this is like a brand marketing ip type relationship, right? So Coinbase NFT platform, NBA partnership, means they can license NBA's ip, right? So they could create their own, I guess, version of NBA topshots or maybe whatever else the NBA and Coinbase have in store. This almost went under the radar last week, I guess. Well, maybe this is like 10,000 likes, but this is huge, don't you think?
00:52:31.248 - 00:52:55.678, Speaker B: It's a very big deal. Yeah. Just collecting the IP from these massive, massive ecosystems which are basically all based on IP. Anyways, really nice victory. Really nice w on Coinbase and wherever Coinbase puts these NFTs, and I think they'll be able to just let the user deploy the NFTs on whatever chain they want, maybe. So, yeah. Anything and everything crypto related from the NBA is now Coinbase.
00:52:55.774 - 00:53:06.438, Speaker A: So congrats, big w. This is one up on, you know, put FTX's name on some stadium recently. Right? Where was that?
00:53:06.524 - 00:53:07.586, Speaker B: Miami. Miami Stadium.
00:53:07.618 - 00:53:09.270, Speaker A: Miami. Okay. That's right. That's right.
00:53:09.340 - 00:53:11.746, Speaker B: And also all the umpires of the MLB.
00:53:11.938 - 00:53:16.474, Speaker A: Let's talk about this Wu Tang clan forever. Wu Tang forever. What happened here?
00:53:16.512 - 00:53:16.934, Speaker B: Wutang.
00:53:16.982 - 00:53:19.798, Speaker A: Wu Tang and pleaser dow. Match made in heaven.
00:53:19.894 - 00:53:40.462, Speaker B: The story here is there's a famous mysterious Wu Tang album of which there is only one of. There's one CD and it got sold, I think, for, it got auctioned off for $2 million as kind of like a middleman towards a middle finger towards the middlemen of the music industry. This was before blockchain. This was before crypto.
00:53:40.526 - 00:53:42.930, Speaker A: So what year are we talking? 90?
00:53:43.000 - 00:54:06.230, Speaker B: I can't remember, like 96, something like that. I don't know. So yeah, they auctioned off their one of, one album that they produced. The Wutang produced an album. Yeah, that was it. Yeah. And this guy, Martin Screlli, who's this hedge fund manager who everyone might remember for going to jail in 2017 for securities fraud.
00:54:06.230 - 00:54:38.482, Speaker B: And he's the guy that jacked up the price of an epipen from like sixteen cents to seven hundred and fifty dollars. He's literally this hedge fund insurance guy, like villain, supervillain, hated by the Internet. And he has all these douchebag videos of him listening to the Wutang album. And he's like, I'm going to destroy this just because I can. And then he also says, some reporter asked him, hey, are you ever going to let anyone else listen to the Wu Tang album? And the guy with like this anger in his face goes, absolutely not.
00:54:38.616 - 00:54:39.330, Speaker A: No way.
00:54:39.400 - 00:54:41.240, Speaker B: Yeah, the guy's just a really mean.
00:54:41.690 - 00:54:43.314, Speaker A: He'S just being a cartoon villain.
00:54:43.362 - 00:55:00.394, Speaker B: He's just being a little. That's great. He's a cartoon villain. He's also in jail now for securities fraud. He'll be in jail for 2024. And because he had to pay off his debts for this fine that he got for securities fraud, he had to auction off the Wutang album. And so pleaser Dow bought it.
00:55:00.394 - 00:55:31.030, Speaker B: Pleaser Dow bought the Wutang album. And so there's Jamis right there, who's chief pleasing officer over at Pleaserdao taking a photo of the one of one famous Wu Tang album that has never been released to the public. And Jamis, I know, and Pleaserdao has a ton of plans as to what to do with this. Here's a picture of them and a bunch of other pleaserdao members as well. Dude, this story is such an amazing story. So congratulations to Jamis. Congratulations to pleaserdao, of which I'm a member.
00:55:33.130 - 00:55:37.238, Speaker A: I think it's so cool. Here's your take as well. What's the juxtaposition here?
00:55:37.324 - 00:55:58.126, Speaker B: Yeah, so this story got onto the front page of the Rolling Stone. And rich, who used to work at Makerdao, an old friend of mine said this might be the first time I've ever read a trad media crypto story that wasn't dripping in sarcasm or ending with a smug and alarmist hot take. This is a significant shift, talking about the tone of the Rolling Stone article. And so I follow.
00:55:58.228 - 00:56:04.190, Speaker A: I guess it's like because crypto are the heroes in the crypto people, this dude's hand.
00:56:04.260 - 00:56:16.530, Speaker B: And so here's my take on this. I said, the juxtaposition of a dow of homies buying a rare cultural artifact from the hands of a scumbag hedge fund manager is exactly the kind of positive pr that crypto needs.
00:56:16.680 - 00:56:21.894, Speaker A: Oh, more of that energy, please. That's cool. This is how it started, how it's going, right?
00:56:21.932 - 00:56:41.354, Speaker B: So here's the story of pleaser Dow, where Layton from pool together tweets out, anyone want to create a quick dow to bid on this? This being people pleasers? Uniswap v three x times y equals k. Uniswap animation. And so Layton just tweeted this out. A bunch of people said, yes, I do. They all hopped into a Dow. They pooled their funds. There's a great story.
00:56:41.354 - 00:57:10.642, Speaker B: We ran it on bankless forever ago about it. And that started off Pleaser Dow, which it was a Dow that was created to buy people pleasers art. And then Pleaserdao went from just a dao of people that wanted to buy that one thing into a dao of people that wanted to buy all the cultural artifacts. So Edward Snowden nfts are in there. The doge NFT is in there. We had Jamis on a state of the nation to talk about this. Now a physical asset, the Wu Tang one of one mysterious album, is now property of Pleaser Dao.
00:57:10.642 - 00:58:01.990, Speaker B: And I know that there are plans in the Pleaser Dao world to actually open this up. So let me actually read out something that Jamis said in the Rolling Stones article. Pleaserdao has grand but loosely articulated ambitions to make the album more available to the public, perhaps through listening parties or gallery style exhibitions, or even to expand ownership of the album to fans, although how that would work would remain up in the air. We believe that we can do something incredible with this piece, said Jamis, to enable it to be shared and ideally owned in part by fans and anyone in the world. Again, think of the juxtaposition behind the hedge fund manager who's like, I'm going to destroy this so no one can listen to it, because I can, because my brand is being an, because I'm rich, because I'm rich. And then this dow buys it and we're like, hey, we're going to allow everyone to listen to this thing. It's perfect.
00:58:01.990 - 00:58:03.142, Speaker B: It's such a perfect story.
00:58:03.196 - 00:58:19.660, Speaker A: I hope it's good. After all this album, we don't even know, but I guess we get to find out. That's really cool, man. Very cool. And exactly the kind of press I think crypto needs at this point in time. Let's go to the next one.
00:58:20.830 - 00:58:22.670, Speaker B: Every one of these have been big.
00:58:22.820 - 00:58:56.566, Speaker A: This is really big in and of itself. Polygon and draftkings have just entered into a strategic partnership. So DraftKings is a $40 billion publicly traded company for, like, sports betting, I believe. I've never used it. This is kind of outside of my area, but I believe they are going to include some of their ip and licensing, like NFT type forms. They're going to start deploying that on Polygon. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the sports betting payment networks shifted to Polygon over time.
00:58:56.566 - 00:59:25.554, Speaker A: They're not just announcing this partnership, but they're also becoming validators on the Polygon network, which is pretty cool. And look, a sidechain is a great way to get started in crypto. Like low gas fees. The Polygon team is pretty good with the onboarding process. It's all EVM. So if you ever want to go to mainnet, you can quite easily. But major company in a different space that we haven't seen, which is sports betting, now coming to crypto, it's pretty cool in and of itself.
00:59:25.752 - 00:59:57.862, Speaker B: I really think the DraftKings potentially becoming a validator to the Polygon network is really something to unpack, because we all know that something like Polygon, it's going to take a decent amount of capital to run a validating node. They got to be like, pretty beefy computers. And so it's nice to pair a beefy computer with a $40 billion company that has things at stake on the Polygon network to lose. Right. Their own business. And so that seems to be a really smart strategic alignment between incentives. So really, congratulations on the partnership.
00:59:57.862 - 01:00:05.246, Speaker B: Polygon, well deserved. And, I mean, gambling and speculation is what draftking is all about.
01:00:05.348 - 01:00:06.586, Speaker A: Yeah, that's in our wheelhouse.
01:00:06.698 - 01:00:08.334, Speaker B: We know about some of that.
01:00:08.532 - 01:00:11.454, Speaker A: That's kind of what me, of course, I just.
01:00:11.652 - 01:00:13.200, Speaker B: Other people. Yeah, I don't.
01:00:13.590 - 01:00:44.550, Speaker A: Yes, I've known some people in crypto who have speculated a time or two. Let me say that that's cool. This is also cool, again, almost equally big news. I thought so. Do you remember in 2018, 2019, Facebook was creating its own Ethereum killer sort of thing, a blockchain. It was going to have a smart contract system. They were launching something at the time that was called Libra, which was going to be kind of the bitcoin and ETH killer on their entire new blockchain.
01:00:44.550 - 01:01:02.986, Speaker A: They came out with a whole virtual machine that's comparison to the EVM, and a whole scripting language rather than solidity. They had flow and they were just going to eat Ethereum's lunch with this new Facebook chain that was going to own the entire world and bring crypto.
01:01:03.098 - 01:01:10.190, Speaker B: They were also inventing their own currency. That was before Libra was, or the currency was going to be a dollar coin, but instead a basket of currencies.
01:01:10.270 - 01:01:34.314, Speaker A: Exactly. And I remember at this, David, like, the market was in the doldrums. This is before Defi really took off. Everyone was like, oh, no, they're going to come and destroy Ethereum and bitcoin. And Facebook's going to be the new champion. They'll have co opted this amazing technology. Okay, what just happened is the Novi wallet from Facebook, which is their wallet, that is the user interface for this whole thing.
01:01:34.314 - 01:01:40.166, Speaker A: They just deployed their first stablecoin. They announced they're going to deploy their first stablecoin. David, guess what it is.
01:01:40.208 - 01:01:42.266, Speaker B: Man on Ethereum.
01:01:42.458 - 01:01:45.050, Speaker A: It's an ERC 20 coin on Ethereum.
01:01:45.130 - 01:01:50.750, Speaker B: Weird how that works. Don't fight Ethereum, just succumb.
01:01:52.370 - 01:02:37.674, Speaker A: That's what they did. Right? So it's an ERC 20 on Ethereum. This is not USDC, it's a stablecoin put out there by Paxos, basically, but using Ethereum as the settlement network and essentially resigning themselves to an app on top of it rather than be the base layer protocol. And the reason is quite simple, something that we've predicted for a while, which is just the protocol sync thesis, right? Facebook simply does not have the credible neutrality to be a base layer system for the world, for identity, for money, for finance. How do we know this? They can't even get their own country to accept them. Okay? Like every time Zuckerberg goes in front, know, Congress gets chewed apart.
01:02:37.722 - 01:02:40.174, Speaker B: It's just like Zuckerberg punching bag time.
01:02:40.372 - 01:03:06.742, Speaker A: And the reason is, maybe some of that's deserved, maybe some of that's not. I tend to happen. I tend to believe that much of that is deserved. But there's also politicians scoring points. I get that whole world, too. But of course they can't be a credibly neutral base settlement platform for crypto, right? Of course they can't be Ethereum on the other hand, is not owned by any single individual. It is a public good for the world.
01:03:06.742 - 01:03:33.470, Speaker A: And of course they would use it for their stablecoin, their money system. Anyway, it's just for me, that was kind of full circle and really interesting to see. Web three or web two can't even compete with web3. Now they are using protocols like Ethereum as their base settlement layer. It was inevitable. Just people didn't see it in 2018 2019. Now it's becoming super obvious.
01:03:33.620 - 01:03:59.670, Speaker B: I think the credible neutrality is definitely an angle, but I think another angle is that building out Ethereum type infrastructure like nodes, evms, it's hard. That's not a trivial thing. And it's not like Facebook doesn't have the technical talent. Like Facebook has a lot of technical talent. But think about the culture of that technical talent. It's building Facebook products for Facebook ownership, not open source software for global human. Right.
01:03:59.740 - 01:04:00.066, Speaker A: Totally.
01:04:00.098 - 01:04:06.854, Speaker B: So, like, while maybe they do have the technical talent, do they have the technical ethos? No, they do not. They have the Zuck ethos.
01:04:06.982 - 01:04:22.590, Speaker A: They do. And do you remember they rug pulled all of their game developers? Remember Facebook released this open API, a whole bunch know game developers built on top of it, and then they would sort of extort some of these games. Right? What was the one, the farm game. Do you remember this?
01:04:22.660 - 01:04:24.654, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. All the. Yeah, yeah.
01:04:24.692 - 01:04:39.718, Speaker A: Okay. Farmville. Something like this. I never played this. But anyway, Facebook would basically go to the game developers and be like, hey, you're going to do what we say. Like, maybe we want to buy your company, else we'll just shut off our API. Yeah, sorry.
01:04:39.804 - 01:04:40.760, Speaker B: Rug pull.
01:04:42.090 - 01:05:00.434, Speaker A: We are the masters. This is like our platform. If you don't like it, see you later. Right. No wonder no one's trusting them to do this kind of thing. They've done this in the. Yeah, but here's the interesting thing, David, is regulators, I find this just hilarious, are already throwing punches, are already fighting.
01:05:00.434 - 01:05:33.350, Speaker A: Elizabeth Warren hates it. She's pissed. It just went live with this announcement and not hours later, but they get a statement from Elizabeth Warren, some other folks in Congress who are like, we got to stop this. We don't want this to happen. It's funny to me because I don't know if I'm saying Elizabeth Warren, but it's kind of a whole group in Washington. She just happens to be the most outspoken, I think, and kind of like the recognized leader of them right now. I don't know if they hate Facebook or crypto more.
01:05:33.350 - 01:05:34.806, Speaker A: Right? What do you think?
01:05:34.908 - 01:05:43.420, Speaker B: I think it's amazing when Facebook and crypto collide and Elizabeth Warren just like, wakes right up out of bed and be like, something's wrong and I don't like it.
01:05:43.950 - 01:05:53.642, Speaker A: Well, what's funny is we actually would say, elizabeth Warren, that crypto is the solution to your Facebook problem.
01:05:53.776 - 01:05:59.742, Speaker B: Yeah. You don't like Elizabeth Warren just thinks that crypto is what Facebook is trying to make their own cryptos ecosystem into.
01:05:59.796 - 01:06:00.430, Speaker A: I don't know.
01:06:00.500 - 01:06:00.974, Speaker B: Maybe.
01:06:01.092 - 01:06:14.770, Speaker A: I just really don't know. I want some of these people to come on bankless. I want them to engage in the crypto community so we could talk about them. You don't like web two, you don't like big tech. You don't like Silicon Valley. Cool. Make it easier for web3 to thrive so we can destroy them.
01:06:14.770 - 01:06:23.746, Speaker A: Okay. Disruptive innovation and put the power back in the hands of the peoples. And this what we all want. I hope so. I think we've got some solutions for that tribe.
01:06:23.778 - 01:06:26.040, Speaker B: They just don't realize that you thought about these things.
01:06:27.610 - 01:06:42.586, Speaker A: We have a plan that's going to work. We think it's called crypto. David. This is a funny story, too. This is still, I guess now we're moving to nft stuff. But there was a massive bid for a crypto punk. You've got a crypto punk beside you.
01:06:42.586 - 01:06:48.846, Speaker A: I've heard of these things. Okay, so what was this bid? Why was it historic? And what happened with his story?
01:06:48.948 - 01:07:28.550, Speaker B: Yeah, so this guy Richard. Richard with an e instead of an a, he tweets out, my punk is not for sale. I don't care what anyone offers. There's, there's that line that everything is for sale for the right price. Right? And so the owner of Poapt XYZ, his name's Patricio, he's not a secret, does the most chad thing ever and offers the largest bid ever for a cryptopunk. So if Richard had accepted this bid, it would have been the largest crypto punk sale ever, clocking in at eth. So the guy just says, like, oh, what do you mean? Like, you're never going to sell your punk.
01:07:28.550 - 01:07:33.114, Speaker B: What about $10 million? And Richard, can I ask you. No.
01:07:33.232 - 01:07:33.610, Speaker A: Okay.
01:07:33.680 - 01:07:34.474, Speaker B: Says no.
01:07:34.592 - 01:07:36.922, Speaker A: What's so special about this cryptopunk, Dave?
01:07:37.066 - 01:07:48.194, Speaker B: It's not the punk. It's got 3d glasses, so that's kind of cool. But that's not the point. It's not the point. The punk is like a medium, a mid to floor punk. It's not special. It's just that Richard likes it.
01:07:48.194 - 01:07:57.638, Speaker B: He's the guy that owns the punk. Right. There's probably a valuation on my punk, and I probably value it two to four times higher than the fair market value.
01:07:57.724 - 01:08:04.102, Speaker A: Just two to four. So if I offered you two to four times more than what it's valued, you'd sell it to me?
01:08:04.156 - 01:08:04.760, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:08:05.370 - 01:08:09.720, Speaker A: You would? Yeah. I'm not doing that. We're not doing that right now.
01:08:10.890 - 01:08:18.486, Speaker B: If you offer me two to four times higher than the market price for it, of which I also determine, then, yeah, I tell you, my punk.
01:08:18.598 - 01:08:21.722, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Okay, so you're not. Never sell. You're not like this guy Richard.
01:08:21.786 - 01:08:23.914, Speaker B: Well, anyway, what happened into a different punk.
01:08:24.042 - 01:08:26.814, Speaker A: Okay, what happened with this story?
01:08:26.852 - 01:08:32.670, Speaker B: Yeah, so Richard, he doesn't accept the $10 million offer for his punk. God.
01:08:32.740 - 01:08:35.406, Speaker A: He refuses JPeg. Dude, tell him.
01:08:35.508 - 01:08:51.320, Speaker B: Okay, so I was talking to my friend about this, and I was like, the reason why he's doing it is because it's cool to deny the offer, right? It's cool to say no to $10 million, is it? Well, his counterargument was like, well, you know what's also cool? Accepting $10 million.
01:08:51.690 - 01:08:56.040, Speaker A: I just sold a JpEG for $10 million in 2021.
01:08:56.570 - 01:09:09.786, Speaker B: Yeah. Follow up tweet coming out of Richard. I think two days later, he tweets out, diamond hands are not my girlfriend's best friend. So he probably told his girlfriend that he declined a $10 million offer.
01:09:09.888 - 01:09:10.634, Speaker A: What?
01:09:10.832 - 01:09:21.066, Speaker B: There's some degree of. Maybe she just started screaming at him or said, why would you do that? Some scale of just, like, what the hell happened? But yeah, that's incredible.
01:09:21.178 - 01:09:36.306, Speaker A: All right, well, now we know David has a price for his crypto punk. But the thing you should have said, david, I think, is use that reverse psychology. You should have told me you're never going to sell it like this guy Richard. Then I would have valued it higher. Then I would have really wanted it. Somebody listening to this would have really wanted it.
01:09:36.328 - 01:09:39.800, Speaker B: Yeah, Ryan, if you wanted a punk by now, you would have gotten one. You're still stuck with your.
01:09:40.250 - 01:09:55.900, Speaker A: It's stuck with it. My turtle and I are friends, okay? We're having back here. It's just going really slow, that's all. It's not as fast as punks, okay? It's going to take a while to catch on. Look, this is another big thing. It's another big news event.
01:09:56.670 - 01:09:58.426, Speaker B: This could have been news events so far.
01:09:58.528 - 01:10:21.822, Speaker A: All right, so what's this one? So here's, I think, the headline Steam. This is valve entertainment. They are banning nfts, crypto games on the Steam platform, which I think is the largest gaming platform in the community, and then one of their competitors has something different to say. Why don't you talk about why are they banning crypto games?
01:10:21.886 - 01:10:40.982, Speaker B: Yeah, they had a game that they actually removed from their platform. I can't remember the name of the game, but they were on Steam. They had a blockchain integration. They were connected into Ethereum. They had nfts in their game. And then they got kicked off of the platform because Steam has now a policy of no nfts, no financial assets inside of games.
01:10:41.046 - 01:10:43.446, Speaker A: Is this because all crypto is a scam, David?
01:10:43.478 - 01:10:46.598, Speaker B: Or is this because it's maybe cannibalizing.
01:10:46.614 - 01:10:48.010, Speaker A: Their business model or something?
01:10:48.080 - 01:11:07.906, Speaker B: Maybe they don't know if I have a gracious angle on it. Maybe they just don't know the regulations around it. So they kicked them off before, and now they're going to go do their due diligence and they're going to come back and like, okay, we did the due diligence, we can now accept it. Maybe. Or maybe they are just like, oh, yeah, blockchain. That's that whole scam thing. Like, no, kick them off.
01:11:07.906 - 01:11:11.886, Speaker B: Get them out of here. Yeah. Okay. Who knows? Who knows? Okay, boomer, the story is unfolding.
01:11:11.918 - 01:11:12.258, Speaker A: Okay.
01:11:12.344 - 01:11:12.594, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:11:12.632 - 01:11:16.886, Speaker A: All right, got it. So then what did their competitor say? So epic had something to.
01:11:17.068 - 01:11:29.734, Speaker B: Yeah, an alternative gaming platform. Epic says, we love nfts and financial assets inside of games. Come build your financial asset games on our platform. And so that story is going to unfold and it's going to be interesting to watch.
01:11:29.852 - 01:12:02.146, Speaker A: Look, this is the game theory of it, though. This happens at the nation state level, right? So, like, China, the US, neither of them, like crypto. China bans crypto. Us says, oh, we love crypto now. Right? I'm not saying it's happening exactly that way, but that is like what happens when you have multiple parties who don't have unlimited power. They can't unilaterally ban something. And if they ban it just locally to their own economy, then they give all of their competitors a massive advantage and it just forces them into a situation where they have to end up capitulating and accepting this.
01:12:02.146 - 01:12:27.450, Speaker A: The only question is, how long will it take steam to do that? Will they go through a year of pain? Two years of pain? Will they go and they try to build their own blockchain network? That is the Steam blockchain. Will they waste all of this time and money or will they just get on board with what's happening? In crypto and these open finance protocols, that's up for Steam and for Gabe. Where's half life three? That's all I want to know.
01:12:27.520 - 01:12:32.166, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe they're doing some digital assets in half life three. Who knows?
01:12:32.198 - 01:12:33.806, Speaker A: Oh, you think so? You think that's happening?
01:12:33.908 - 01:12:34.880, Speaker B: They are not.
01:12:35.890 - 01:12:43.706, Speaker A: Oh, David, let's talk about this while we're talking. NFTs Ross Ulbrich, what is he doing from jail? From a jail cell with NFTs Ross.
01:12:43.738 - 01:13:20.886, Speaker B: Ulbricht, the renowned dread pirate Roberts from the Silk Road, the very peaceful libertarian who believed in what he was doing and got sent to jail for, I think, two lifetimes for running an illegal marketplace using bitcoin, all back in 2013. He's been in jail ever since, but he has this Twitter account that his mom runs, real Ross U. Ross Ulbricht. And he says, we are auctioning off some of my art as an NFT. The proceeds will go towards charities that help prisoners and their families and towards helping me regain my freedom. One project we envision is to help kids travel to visit their mom and dads in prison. So cool.
01:13:20.886 - 01:13:26.186, Speaker B: Ross Ulbrich, getting into NFTs from jail. Yeah, very free Ross. Free Ross.
01:13:26.378 - 01:14:10.102, Speaker A: Also not a bitcoin maximist, I guess, using these other, I don't think, ever. Okay, Andrew Yang, what's he up to, man? Okay, so we had him on the podcast. We made this joke toward the end, right? Because he started talking about, hey, I really think this podcast is a historic occasion because it's the first time that Andrew Yang has been on a crypto podcast, been on bankless. And also, it's sort of the first time where we've had a politician with some name presence. Just do like the crypto handshake. Give crypto the handshake and be like, hey, guys, I support crypto, and I'm going to let the world know that publicly. And anyway, we had this joke and we said, hey, if this is a momentous occasion, what we should do is create an NFT.
01:14:10.102 - 01:14:34.194, Speaker A: And we threw that back to the community and said, hey, community, if anyone wants to create an NFT at the end of this show, go do it. And somebody did it. Actually, this is crypto wife. I believe she's known, and she makes all sorts of memes for bankless, for the community. She's a fantastic artist, and she created this meme for Andrew Yang. So take us from there, David. Then what happened?
01:14:34.312 - 01:15:00.934, Speaker B: Yeah, we also got Andrew Yang, andrewyang Eth. We teamed up with Brantley Milligan, got into a zoom with Andrew connected him with his first ens name, andrewyang eth. So Andrewyang Eth actually minted this NFT. And this NFT auction actually just closed about 30 minutes ago and it sold for 6.9 e. So staying true to the memes, I guess we're not taking things seriously today. $28,000 to the forward party.
01:15:00.934 - 01:15:13.358, Speaker B: So really, like a nice gracious gesture to the crypto world saying, hey, I'm here, I'm in it. Like, I'm doing these things. I got Andrew Yang Eth minted my NFT donating to the forward party. So really pretty cool.
01:15:13.524 - 01:15:31.378, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm glad that somebody did that. Somebody stepped that up. And seven eth is not 6.9 e, excuse me, is not a small figure. So $28,000 and somebody gets this fantastic NFT. So more politicians will be coming to crypto. Crypto will be coming to politics.
01:15:31.378 - 01:15:34.054, Speaker A: This is going to happen. And I think this is just the.
01:15:34.092 - 01:16:03.242, Speaker B: Start of all of this for the listeners out there. The NFT just has a bunch of tip of the hats towards the greater crypto world. Andrew Yang has chrome laser eyes, rainbow laser eyes, which I think is a nice touch. He's got an ethereum and a bitcoin lapel pin. And then there's a bunch of NFT profile picture icons out there. There's a cool cat, there's a pudgy penguin, there's a crypto punk. And then we also have a bunch of the crypto media platforms out there, the defiant bankless daily guay.
01:16:03.242 - 01:16:10.290, Speaker B: And then we also have tips of the hat to Gitcoin and coin center. And so a lot of crypto thing is being represented.
01:16:10.630 - 01:16:44.766, Speaker A: Absolutely. And people sometimes wonder how crypto is moving this fast. Like, how does it accomplish so much? Right now we have politicians who are incented to come to crypto because they get votes, maybe they get fundraising, this sort of thing. So do our media publications, David, this is the Economist, and they are auctioning off the magazine cover. And this is actually a fantastic article. It's called down the rabbit hole, the promise and perils of decentralized finance. The first article, the Economist, I've ever read that actually portrayed a pretty accurate picture of what Defi is, and now they're auctioning that off.
01:16:44.766 - 01:17:32.902, Speaker A: What's really interesting about it is we've said this before, it applies to all of our listeners. Crypto literally pays you to learn about crypto, okay? It pays politicians to advocate for crypto. It pays media companies to put crypto as the title, as the heading of their magazine cover. Okay. Crypto has a built in incentive mechanism to spread itself, to propagate itself. It's almost like a life form. It's almost like an advanced intelligence that is working through the meme layer of humanity and propagating itself and spreading itself and has the ability to self replicate and produce its own energy out of human resources.
01:17:32.902 - 01:17:49.650, Speaker A: That's what's happening and that's what I think is the story. It's like, oh, cool, the economists release an NFT. Well, they release an NFT. They're going to make money on that. Other magazines will follow, they'll produce more articles about crypto and it will escape into mainstream. That's really what's happening here, which I think is super cool.
01:17:49.720 - 01:18:13.930, Speaker B: I think another illustration for what you're saying is that water flows downstream and crypto is downstream. Therefore water, which is society is going to flow downstream to crypto. Now that we've discovered crypto, the natural incentives of everything is society just likes crypto. Again, the most bullish thing about crypto is to be understood. Once you understand it, you are trapped. It's a virus. It sucks you in.
01:18:13.930 - 01:18:23.358, Speaker B: The economist, it caught the crypto virus. It's all in. It's going to spread the crypto virus to all of its neighboring magazine companies and then it's going to go from there.
01:18:23.524 - 01:18:33.450, Speaker A: Absolutely. A lot of readers of the economists too, like in the traditional world, institutional world, Jack Dorsey, he definitely has the crypto bug, but I wouldn't actually say specific strain.
01:18:33.610 - 01:18:34.974, Speaker B: Specific strain of the crypto bug.
01:18:35.022 - 01:18:55.858, Speaker A: Yeah, just bitcoin. Right. He's immune from all other crypto talk, I think. But square is considering building a bitcoin mining system. He says that's based on custom silicon and open source for individuals and businesses worldwide. He has this Twitter thread about what Square is doing. And I think the net of this is basically like, hey, proof of work is centralized.
01:18:55.858 - 01:19:19.934, Speaker A: I want to make it a bit more open source in efforts to make it less centralized. We're going to create some hardware in square to do this and some specifications for hardware to do this. So a noble effort, I think. I guess. I don't know though, it's still proof of work, right?
01:19:20.052 - 01:19:26.546, Speaker B: Is it square's core competency, which is payments of money, or is it something else?
01:19:26.728 - 01:20:14.110, Speaker A: It's funny to me just because I feel like Jack gets bitcoin and then he just makes it a point just to fixate on bitcoin. When is square going to capitulate? Square is being like valve and being like the steam platform, right? I'm just like, guys, we have this whole defi thing, and if you're not careful, some other enterprising fintech, maybe it's payPal, maybe it's even visa, I don't know. They're going to come and eat your lunch. If you're just obsessing about bitcoin mining when there's this whole other experiment going on, which is Defi and Ethereum and proof of stake, you could do bitcoin, but why not also do these other things? I guess to be fair with Twitter, they are doing more with nfts. But is square missing the boat?
01:20:14.450 - 01:20:47.014, Speaker B: Not yet. The NFT thing actually is not live. You know what is live? Bitcoin tipping. And also, what do you think the Twitter populace wants more verified nfts or bitcoin tipping? Like I said this last time, and also at the same time, we said this like two or three roll ups ago, the total volume transferred of ether and stablecoins is dwarfing all other value ever traded in the crypto world. And square, you know, what square is doing building bitcoin mining machines is so nonsensical. Square, you're a payments company. There's this brand new payments ecosystem.
01:20:47.014 - 01:20:53.002, Speaker B: You can build a roll up for your payments and hook into defi. Why aren't you doing this? Why are you focused on bitcoin mining?
01:20:53.066 - 01:21:26.710, Speaker A: It makes no sense. I'm not even worried about it, David, because they'll just find out later and be late to the party and it'll. Guess some people have to be dragged along kicking and screaming. Speaking of which, Facebook, I don't know if they're being dragged along kicking and streaming. They're actually trying to lead the metaverse. They've just hired 10,000 workers in Europe to build up the metaverse. They're actually talking about David renaming their company as well.
01:21:26.710 - 01:21:42.826, Speaker A: Okay, so they haven't announced the name yet, but they announced their intent to rename Facebook. Must be because all of the negative pr that they've gotten recently, and I would guess it would be something metaverse related. You have any thoughts on new names for Facebook? Anything good?
01:21:42.848 - 01:22:01.230, Speaker B: Coming to such a. No, I don't. And it's like such a duct tape fix when, you know what really needs a reorganized rebrand is the complete internal structure and business model of Facebook. You can't just slap on a new name. It's like, oh, yeah, all those. Jesus.
01:22:01.390 - 01:22:27.766, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, so I asked this question to Twitter. I was like, what should the new Facebook name be? I came up with the term zucktherium, which I thought was somewhat clever. Other people said, socialverse, faceverse, zuckerverse, or my own personal favorite board, ants. Politics club. That's a new name for Facebook. So maybe some ideas there for Zuck and crew.
01:22:27.766 - 01:22:40.926, Speaker A: As you're thinking about this rebrand, David, let's talk about this coinbase. They just released a digital asset policy, kind of an alternative policy to all of the bad ones that seem to be floating around governments. What are they saying in this policy?
01:22:41.028 - 01:23:01.222, Speaker B: Yeah, it's basically like a skeleton of a proposed. They're proposing this be the way that policy happens. And it's very logical, very clear, very straightforward, makes a ton of sense. I like all of it. Basically, there are two big things. There's more details in here, but there are two big things, is regulate digital assets under a different framework than all the previous assets of the world.
01:23:01.276 - 01:23:03.494, Speaker A: Oh, not the ones from the 1940s.
01:23:03.692 - 01:23:30.958, Speaker B: Not the ones that we decided with pen and paper. Like, digital assets need a digital asset framework. So let's make that. That's their big thing. And then their other big thing is designate one regulating body for digital asset markets. Allocate one, and make crypto czar, a crypto czar, a crypto regulator, not the SEC, not the CFTC, not the treasury, not the IRS. Make the crypto regulatory body, which just makes a ton of sense.
01:23:30.958 - 01:23:37.200, Speaker B: Just pick one. Just point to someone and pick one and tell them that they're the regulator, so that we can just know that.
01:23:37.570 - 01:23:44.130, Speaker A: Can we do the third thing, which is make sure that the new cryptos are. Is actually good? Remember we talked about that guy in the White House?
01:23:44.280 - 01:23:45.940, Speaker B: Pick your battle, Brian. How much?
01:23:47.030 - 01:23:49.538, Speaker A: Okay, pick any two of the three asks.
01:23:49.554 - 01:23:52.466, Speaker B: Just allow us to focus our lobbying to one direction.
01:23:52.578 - 01:23:56.022, Speaker A: We'll start there. Start there. Good suggestions by Coinbase, to be honest.
01:23:56.156 - 01:23:59.146, Speaker B: There'S a lot more in here, so there's a link in the show notes if you want to read more.
01:23:59.248 - 01:24:14.960, Speaker A: Yeah. Meanwhile, I think there's an attack kind of going on from regulators versus these CFI centralized crypto bank lending companies. They're coming after in particular, I believe, Celsius Network and also named as maybe.
01:24:16.450 - 01:24:46.450, Speaker B: The reason why we know that they're going after this. That actually wasn't public information. The office of the attorney general of New York released these documents that had redacted like names, so there was privacy retained. But you know what? They forgot to redact the file name of the documents that they are showing. So we have in the top left corner of each document, Microsoft Word, Celsius, letter, and then also Microsoft Word, nexo letter. They just forgot. After doing all the redaction, they just forgot to clear out the names.
01:24:46.450 - 01:24:49.282, Speaker B: These are the people that are regulating digital assets, folks.
01:24:49.426 - 01:25:00.314, Speaker A: There, you, you know, you got to watch those document names. They'll get you every time. You also have to watch on calendars, David, make sure who you're sharing your calendar with. Like, some information could get leaked. You ever done that?
01:25:00.432 - 01:25:02.060, Speaker B: I did not know that was a thing.
01:25:02.850 - 01:25:16.706, Speaker A: From experience. Careful what you put on your. I mean, I think the attack has kind of begun. A lot of these companies have raised some war chests. I'd say recall. I seem to recall a recent Celsius raise. There's so many.
01:25:16.706 - 01:25:43.626, Speaker A: But, like, blockfi did recently as well. And so these companies are going to fight this. This is only in New York. The question is, does the contagion spread? Do other states join in this? My guess is you'll have some states, maybe like a state of Texas, certainly Wyoming, that will say, fine, New York doesn't want it, we'll take it. Right. And that is the beautiful thing about, again, this game theory playing out and crypto winning in the end. So all this short term stuff is fun.
01:25:43.626 - 01:26:09.202, Speaker A: Also, I will say there are some things regulators could do to help us with these CFI companies. Right? Because this is not deFi. We can't right click open source and understand exactly where our interest rate is coming from on Celsius or blockfire. Nexo. Right. We can do that in DeFi, but it's not defi. So where there's a trusted intermediary, there is some role for regulators to play.
01:26:09.202 - 01:26:15.166, Speaker A: So let's be fair on that. Let's just not shut things down without providing clarity.
01:26:15.358 - 01:26:38.038, Speaker B: It's a great pairing. If centralized intermediary, then regulation, because that's what we need to be regulated. Right? So those two things go hand in hand. What we get frustrated about is when there is no central intermediary, there's just this application. And some people, we pretend there is, but we pretend there is, and therefore we try and regulate it. That's where things get iffy.
01:26:38.214 - 01:27:12.566, Speaker A: Help us. Cryptozar, we know you're out there. Hopefully, maybe a bankless listener is going to be the future. Cryptozar. Well, in Australia, they're doing some things right, though it seems like at least there's, I believe this was a report that the australian parliament has issued, and they called for an overhaul of basically their regulatory clarity with respect to crypto. They called for new laws to govern Daos to centralized, autonomous organizations. An overhaul of capital gains tax in Defi, a tax discount when crypto miners are using renewable energy.
01:27:12.566 - 01:27:40.366, Speaker A: I don't know if these ideas will actually be implemented, but this is what it looks like, folks. It's not that hard. Right. The crypto industry is asking for some very simple things. Clarity above all, but also some friendlier treatment of this industry as a whole. Like, make it a home in your country. Make the industry feel like you are welcoming it as you welcome the Internet as a new technological innovation, all the people that support it.
01:27:40.366 - 01:27:47.790, Speaker A: Hopefully, Australia is heading in that direction and providing an example to other western countries. It's just very sensible.
01:27:49.510 - 01:27:53.618, Speaker B: Agreed. I want that for myself. You want that in the United States?
01:27:53.704 - 01:27:55.230, Speaker A: Do you want to move to Australia?
01:27:55.390 - 01:27:56.578, Speaker B: You know, not really.
01:27:56.664 - 01:28:02.918, Speaker A: Time zones are, you know, great place with time zones. Right? Poor Anthony Sasana all the way over there.
01:28:03.084 - 01:28:05.926, Speaker B: He's out of lockdown as of today. So congratulations to him.
01:28:06.028 - 01:28:13.146, Speaker A: That's great. That's good news. Hey, talk about this. This is happening in the financial sector in New York. What's this showing this picture? Yeah.
01:28:13.168 - 01:28:45.170, Speaker B: So not the first time that this has happened, but definitely the biggest statue to get dropped in. In front of the NYSE. There's this famous bull in front of the New York Stock Exchange. Once upon a time, I think, after the 2008 crisis, there was that five, six, seven year old statue of a girl who's, like, very defiantly putting her hands up on her hips against the bull. Kind of a statement against the 1% versus 99%. Now, there is this massive ape that got dropped right in front of this bowl. So we have this bull and this ape just staring each other down.
01:28:45.170 - 01:29:25.354, Speaker B: And in addition to that, a ton of bananas got thrown around the bowl. And so this was done. This is a tip of the hat to, for those that remember Harambe, the gorilla that unfortunately had a young child fall into its pit. And the gorilla was like playing with a child, hanging out with a child. Very, very fearful parents, as this gorilla could absolutely just rip this child apart with one hand. And so Harambe was shot dead by the caretakers so that the child wouldn't be killed and there wouldn't be a bunch of court lawsuits. And then this harambe ape got just martyred by the Internet, and then now a beloved Internet icon.
01:29:25.354 - 01:29:41.414, Speaker B: And so this artist came and made a harambe statue and dropped it in front of Wall street. But there was no connection to Wall street bets or ape culture. But it's one of those things, like, not no official connection, but it's one of those things. Like, they knew. They knew. There's now a massive ape in front of the stock market.
01:29:41.532 - 01:29:52.150, Speaker A: Just feel like this has just nailed the zeitgeist of this new era that we've entered into. Right? Like, the stock market is neither bull nor bear. It's ape now.
01:29:52.300 - 01:29:52.950, Speaker B: Right?
01:29:53.100 - 01:29:56.970, Speaker A: And Rombe, like, he was killed by the institutions, wasn't he?
01:29:57.040 - 01:29:57.418, Speaker B: Right.
01:29:57.504 - 01:29:58.730, Speaker A: Not doing anything wrong.
01:29:58.800 - 01:29:59.082, Speaker B: Right.
01:29:59.136 - 01:29:59.450, Speaker A: Okay.
01:29:59.520 - 01:30:00.298, Speaker B: Just being.
01:30:00.464 - 01:30:20.194, Speaker A: Playing with a. I mean, and inside of a zoo. What's the metaphor there? Like, captured be in a cage and just, like, trying to live his life. I don't know. There's metaphors on metaphors. And the fact that this is a stare down between the bull and the ape, I think, wow, this is how we're entering the 2020s, folks. This is what it is.
01:30:20.194 - 01:30:21.214, Speaker A: This is the new era.
01:30:21.262 - 01:30:21.902, Speaker B: Ape culture.
01:30:21.966 - 01:30:22.580, Speaker A: Perfect.
01:30:23.350 - 01:30:35.666, Speaker B: I keep on seeing, saying that crypto is moving closer to society, and society is moving closer to crypto. Well, if there's a goddamn ape in front of the stock market, that's a clear sign that society and crypto are coming closer and closer.
01:30:35.778 - 01:30:41.194, Speaker A: And it's not like we're advocating, like, ape culture and degeneracy here. Right?
01:30:41.392 - 01:30:43.494, Speaker B: It's what the monetary policy is incentivizing.
01:30:43.542 - 01:31:05.274, Speaker A: You've made a mockery of your markets, of your markets. You've made a mockery of it. Central banks, people in charge, institutions. And so how can you expect us to take it seriously? Right? Like the whole meme stock phenomenon, the whole GME phenomenon. We could go on, but this is brilliant. I love this art. Anyway, let's go through some quick hits, David.
01:31:05.402 - 01:31:05.806, Speaker B: Very quick.
01:31:05.828 - 01:31:23.538, Speaker A: Here we go. Okay. The CbOe acquires Eris X. So this is the cboe expanding. Eris X was a crypto derivatives market. Now they're getting a little bit bigger. This is all very legal, crypto spot trading and derivatives.
01:31:23.538 - 01:31:27.634, Speaker A: And I guess the CBOE is continuing to expand through these acquisitions.
01:31:27.762 - 01:31:44.798, Speaker B: Next up, we have society generale. We talked about them. They're the third largest bank in France that recently submitted a governance proposal to Makerdao. They are shopping for a crypto custodian. So if you are a crypto custodian and you want to be bought by a big bank, society general, you might find love there.
01:31:44.964 - 01:32:12.866, Speaker A: Yeah, find love there. Wow. It's like classified ads, I guess, for custodians. BlackRock CEO says there's huge opportunities in digital currency, particularly in this article, he meant kind of stablecoins, other things, non threatening things. But he's kind of in the Jamie Dimon camp of saying bitcoin is useless. There's actually a quote in this article from Jamie diamond that reminded me of where Jamie Dimon comments on bitcoin. This is of course the JP Morgan CEO.
01:32:12.866 - 01:32:28.266, Speaker A: He says, this makes no difference to me. I don't think you should smoke cigarettes either. But our clients are adults. They disagree. That's what makes markets. I love that he compares owning bitcoin to smoking cigarettes. My God, one of those things gives you cancer, the other just gives you more money.
01:32:28.448 - 01:32:31.950, Speaker B: Jamie diamond capitulating to the market, I guess.
01:32:32.020 - 01:32:32.894, Speaker A: All right, what's next?
01:32:32.932 - 01:32:42.480, Speaker B: David Uniswap hires a former Obama spokesperson as head of communications and regulatory. Conversations around DFI swirl in DC. Interesting.
01:32:42.930 - 01:33:00.886, Speaker A: Uniswap getting political as well. DFI getting political. Axi is now a top 500 website in the US. Site ranked 476. Axi definitely going mainstream also with that global appeal. Guys, we will be right back with the takes of the week. These are some hot takes and of course the meme of the week.
01:33:00.886 - 01:33:05.366, Speaker A: You won't want to miss it. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:33:05.468 - 01:33:46.578, Speaker B: Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and NFts. And now it's live and has over 100 projects deployed. Gas fees on Ethereum l one suck too many people want to use Ethereum and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us. And that's why teams like Arbitrum have been hard at work developing L2 solutions that makes transactions on Ethereum cheap and instant. Arbitrum increases Ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude, at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying. When interacting with arbitrum, you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into Ethereum's level of security and decentralization. This is why people are calling this Ethereum's broadband moment, where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security.
01:33:46.578 - 01:34:22.458, Speaker B: If you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better user experience, go to developers offchainlabs.com to get started building on Arbitrum. And if you're a user, keep an eye out for your favorite DFI apps being built on Arbitrum. Many DFI applications on the Ethereum L1 are migrating over to L2 s like Arbitrum, and some are even skipping over the layer ones entirely and deploying directly on L2. There's so many apps coming online to Arbitrum. So go to bridge Arbitrum IO now and start bridging over your ETh or any of the tokens listed and start having the Defi or NFT experience that you've always wanted. Living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys.
01:34:22.458 - 01:35:02.246, Speaker B: Not your keys, not your crypto. That's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet, which makes proper private key management a breeze. But the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet. Ledger is the combination of the Ledger hardware wallet and the Ledger Live app. And if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite defi apps all in one spot, Ledger Live is where you want to be. Not only does Ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app, but it also hooks into all of the defi apps and services that you're used to using Ledger Live. You can stake your Ethan Lido, swap on dexes like Paraswap, or display your nfts with Rainbow.
01:35:02.246 - 01:35:30.450, Speaker B: You can also use wallet Connect inside of Ledger Live to connect to all the other Defi apps that keep coming online. Defi never stops growing and the Ledger live app grows alongside with it. So click the link in the show notes to see all of the defi apps that Ledger Live has. And stay tuned as more apps come online. And if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet, what are you even waiting for? Go to Ledger.com, grab a ledger, download Ledger live, and get all of your defi apps all in one space.
01:35:30.600 - 01:35:43.450, Speaker A: Alright, guys, we are back with the takes of the week. The first one from Medvan. He says this today's nfts are the cave paintings of the metaverse. I like that analogy. Cave paintings of the metaverse very early on.
01:35:43.520 - 01:35:48.602, Speaker B: Yeah. You think jpegs or, excuse me, nfts of the future are just going to be jpegs? Think again. Think again.
01:35:48.656 - 01:36:08.306, Speaker A: All right. These are just this cave painting times we're going to evolve from here. Medvan with another take. I bought my first bitcoin on Coinbase in 2013. Many will buy their first NFT on it too. This goes back to the story we're talking about. This is a mainstream moment, I think, for NFTs and Coinbase is going to be right there helping to onboard the world.
01:36:08.408 - 01:36:10.340, Speaker B: Matt, two for two with great takes.
01:36:11.030 - 01:36:15.774, Speaker A: Good job, Matt. Good week. Another NFT take. Why don't you read this one, David, from Adam Sachs?
01:36:15.822 - 01:36:25.960, Speaker B: Yeah, this is great. Adam Sachs says, look, nfts are a scam. But websites that get you to post your hard work for free in exchange for hearts and likes, that's the real stuff.
01:36:26.890 - 01:36:43.760, Speaker A: It's amazing what a great way to describe all of social media. We do all of this stuff for free, I suppose. We don't even own the property. On top of it, we're just renting. You ever think about that, David? Like your Twitter account is not your Twitter account. Rented something you're borrowing from.
01:36:44.210 - 01:36:48.446, Speaker B: I'm making more and more valuable, although I don't have ownership over it.
01:36:48.548 - 01:36:49.582, Speaker A: No equity, sir.
01:36:49.636 - 01:36:50.942, Speaker B: It's not even my Twitter account.
01:36:50.996 - 01:36:56.686, Speaker A: You're just a renter and web two. Social media are our landlords, our surfs.
01:36:56.718 - 01:36:57.250, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:36:57.400 - 01:37:04.542, Speaker A: Let's talk about this. Dow to Dow is going to be the new b to b. This is anon intern not going to make it. Dow to Dow.
01:37:04.606 - 01:37:25.510, Speaker B: I can't hear like one time of a Dow spinning up without them being like, okay, here's our token swap targets. Like, I want to do a token swap at this Dow and that Dow and that Dow. And it just makes this mesh network of Dow alignment incentives that makes it very hard to rip. Right. When bridges are built and they're built sturdily, it's hard to rip that ecosystem.
01:37:25.670 - 01:37:49.134, Speaker A: Yeah, it is. Yeah. Every Dow launches with five or ten different partnerships, basically, or that's the very first thing you do. And dows can't really work well with non digital organizations either. That just doesn't work. So talking about a new Dow economy, b to b, by the way, for folks that aren't familiar, stands for business to business, which is a whole like industry subsector, of course. And now it's going to be dow to Dow.
01:37:49.134 - 01:37:56.610, Speaker A: These are the new capital formation entities. David, here's a take from you. I'm going to read this one.
01:37:56.760 - 01:37:58.246, Speaker B: Read the first, read first.
01:37:58.348 - 01:38:02.354, Speaker A: Oh, really? I have to do? Okay. This is from David Greider.
01:38:02.482 - 01:38:04.118, Speaker B: We had him on the podcast once before.
01:38:04.204 - 01:38:40.130, Speaker A: That's right, David. Hey, David, I hope you're listening. David says, what is the total addressable market for crypto? What if the total dressable market for crypto rather isn't digital gold or the Internet sector? What if it's all government spending? So he's saying, what if the total addressable market size is different? We always talk about like 8 trillion in gold? That's what bitcoin is going to be worth. Or we compare it to the Internet and he's saying, what if it's all government spending? And then you replied. And you said, I think Tam for crypto is just everything, to be honest. So what do you mean by this?
01:38:40.280 - 01:38:59.922, Speaker B: Yeah, everyone loves to play that game. It's like, oh, yeah, here's bitcoin's valuation, it should be at least gold. Here's Ethereum's valuation, it should at least be all the fang stocks. Like, here's how much the government's in debt. Bitcoin should. Dude, the total addressable market for crypto is every financial asset that exists. We are going to consume everything.
01:38:59.922 - 01:39:18.400, Speaker B: We are literally a better financial asset platform exchange network than anything that's ever come before it. So if you don't think any valuable asset isn't going to find a token on Ethereum to embody it, you're wrong. The total addressable market for crypto is everything that has value.
01:39:19.010 - 01:39:32.338, Speaker A: Are you going to limit that just to the earth, David? Or would you expand that to the solar system, to the Galaxy, to the multiverse? Are we talking the total addressable market size of all of the possible universes in existence? Is that how big this is?
01:39:32.504 - 01:39:38.018, Speaker B: I'm not an expert on interplanetary block production and propagation. I don't know.
01:39:38.184 - 01:39:40.230, Speaker A: We run up against some speed of light issues.
01:39:40.300 - 01:39:53.450, Speaker B: I think it's eight minutes to get to the moon. I don't know how fast an Ethereum block can get there, actually make a network work. But once we solve that problem. Yes, once we solve that problem, yeah. Then the value of the sun will be a token on Ethereum.
01:39:54.110 - 01:40:00.650, Speaker A: Watch for David's next piece on the total addressable Ethereum as the settlement layer for the multiverse.
01:40:01.310 - 01:40:03.322, Speaker B: Interplanetary settlement layer.
01:40:03.466 - 01:40:16.014, Speaker A: Absolutely. This is Ryan Selkis'tweet. I love this one. He says we need A-U-S. Regulatory agency that will protect investors from the other us regulatory agencies. A little snarky kind of fun, but.
01:40:16.052 - 01:40:22.674, Speaker B: Going back to how we want just a cryptos are just centralize all the regulatory energy into one place so we can just all focus there.
01:40:22.712 - 01:40:26.466, Speaker A: I mean, that's what Coinbase says. But what if we don't like the person? What if we don't like the guy who's doing that?
01:40:26.488 - 01:40:37.570, Speaker B: Then we can all yell at him collectively rather than having to split our energies between Warren, Yellen, Gensler, like, no, just make one person that we get to be the person to yell at, apply pressure.
01:40:37.650 - 01:40:52.380, Speaker A: But ideally it's that number three, it's somebody who's good. Back to that. Hopefully we'll see where we get. Okay, those guys, those are the takes for the week. Or do we have another? No. Next we have memes. But before we do, what are you excited about, David? What are you excited about?
01:40:52.750 - 01:41:11.838, Speaker B: I think that this whole Wu Tang album thing, I think is just such a great microcosm of what I want to see happen moving forward. I want to see daos make a bunch of PR statements, PR moves that get picked up and reported on that are in direct opposition, in direct contrast.
01:41:12.014 - 01:41:12.814, Speaker A: Positive.
01:41:12.942 - 01:41:15.570, Speaker B: Yeah, positive contrast to the rest of the world. Right?
01:41:15.640 - 01:41:22.754, Speaker A: Like the opposite of the parasite guy. That's an analogy in that. Like the parasite guy who jacked up the price of epipens.
01:41:22.802 - 01:41:23.350, Speaker B: Right, exactly.
01:41:23.420 - 01:41:27.698, Speaker A: Terrible PR for Wall street, for hedge fund managers and big finance.
01:41:27.794 - 01:41:28.678, Speaker B: People hate them.
01:41:28.764 - 01:41:30.994, Speaker A: You want the opposite of that to happen, right?
01:41:31.052 - 01:42:09.734, Speaker B: Like, no, I want a dow to distribute ownership of this prize cultural artifact that is like a meme about how it's a walled garden and break down those walls and share it with everyone. Share the culture, share the value. This is how I think crypto is going to mainstream itself in terms of cultural acceptance, is that we fix all of the problems that society has, story by story. There's a meme that we ran about a number of roll ups ago. It was like a broken existential crisis about the future of the world. There was a big crack in the asshole, and there was a bandaid spanning the crack, and the bandaid was labeled a dow with the homies. Right.
01:42:09.734 - 01:42:37.262, Speaker B: We have the answers, and we just need these stories to propagate through the rest of the world to show the world that, hey, we can fix stuff here in crypto. Crypto is here to help you live your life. And I think this is the first story of many I kind of see specifically with pleaserdao, but also with these cultural artifacts. It's like crypto is building this arc, and daos are going to buy up all the cultural icons, all the cultural stories, and get them on the arc to make them part of the digital world. I think that's going to be kind of cool.
01:42:37.316 - 01:43:06.450, Speaker A: Do you know what's so interesting about that? Hope. And that aspiration, though, is it depends so much on the layer zero, which is the people layer, okay? Right. Because some people can be assholes, right? And some people are not. Some people are good people. They see pie expanding things. They are altruistic, right? And so our layer zero has to be awesome. It can't be full of, like, wall street assholes.
01:43:06.450 - 01:43:12.202, Speaker A: I'm not saying all Wall street people are assholes. I'm saying that there are many assholes on wall.
01:43:12.256 - 01:43:13.322, Speaker B: Select for them.
01:43:13.456 - 01:44:04.522, Speaker A: Okay, so how do we prevent that because there are a lot of parasitic individuals who've come to crypto and are looking to scam individuals, we see very much this countervailing force of individuals who are here for the long term, but it's not a given. I mean, crypto could become at the layer zero, just as toxic as organizations and entities that have atrified in the real world. And that's why our layer zero is incredibly important to protect. We have to create a culture of doing good for the world if we want this industry to be successful and sustaining for generations. And it's not a given, we actively have to make that choice, I think. Yeah, what's your thought?
01:44:04.656 - 01:44:55.494, Speaker B: I have a ton of thoughts on that. And this is actually kind of like one of the subjects of one of the articles I'm trying to write. We have this open, public, transparent ledger and that transparency because everyone can see everyone else doing stuff, that transparency, in my mind, actually incentivizes open, collaborative, transparent nature in the society that around these things, right? Because we incentivize collaboration on chain money legos, we incentivize collaboration off chain in the layer zero. And so there's this culture, at least in the Ethereum world, there's this culture of everyone checking on everyone else to make sure that everyone else is being good. A society around Ethereum is a collaborative society. And when somebody does something wrong that we don't like, everyone acknowledges that and knows that. And it's a social checking system, social collateral, social clout.
01:44:55.494 - 01:45:09.406, Speaker B: And we have this society that is trying to guide people into this positive sun, some collaborative, honorable society around Ethereum. And I think the nature of a transparent blockchain actually incentivizes that.
01:45:09.588 - 01:45:21.618, Speaker A: Well, to the extent we are able to do that, I think we will create a lasting movement that is good for the world. So let's hope. And that's definitely why we're here, for sure. And I know many bankless listeners are here for those reasons as well.
01:45:21.704 - 01:45:24.098, Speaker B: Absolutely. Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:45:24.184 - 01:45:27.910, Speaker A: I'm just going to say all time high man. Feeling good. What a great week, right?
01:45:27.980 - 01:45:29.126, Speaker B: It was a great week.
01:45:29.228 - 01:45:59.390, Speaker A: It was a great week. I feel like this time eth has earned it, right? I felt in 2017 like something was off. It felt very bubbly, like there wasn't a lot of substance behind what was going on, right? There was definitely something. There was a vision and a promise and a hope, but there wasn't substance. This time we have substance. The 2021 bull run has been just phenomenal. I think it's going to continue in the future.
01:45:59.390 - 01:46:59.682, Speaker A: One of the last things I'll say and what I'm excited about this week is actually after our conversation that we recorded this week with Eric Peters. New podcast, by the way, comes out on Monday for podcast listeners. This is with a guy who made the largest institutional purchase of bitcoin and ether in 2020. So this is kind of a traditional hedge fund, and he really set all of my worries about regulators and nation state destroying crypto to rest. So tune into that episode to hear exactly why. But just with a very pragmatic approach, I think from time to time in my crypto journey, I've always been worried, you know, are the regulators going to come squash this thing? Is the nation state going to disallow it? Are they going to ban it? And Eric doesn't think that's very likely. In fact, he thinks that there are a number of escape hatches that prevent that from being the case.
01:46:59.682 - 01:47:16.082, Speaker A: So I guess what I'm saying is I'm feeling good all time high. Everyone. Enjoy the bull run. It's going to be fine. It's going to be fun. We'll probably get more regulatory FUD, other sorts of FUD that's coming in the future. That's fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
01:47:16.082 - 01:47:28.538, Speaker A: Don't worry about this. Think about the long term. In the long run, I've never been more bullish, and I've never felt more that crypto is completely inevitable. So that's what I'm excited about this week, man.
01:47:28.624 - 01:47:40.062, Speaker B: Yeah. This will be the second time I reviews the water flows downstream metaphor. The regulators are just trying to stop water flowing downstream. Eventually, water finds its way around the dam. It'll get around it.
01:47:40.196 - 01:47:46.546, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. All right, David, meme of the week time. We got two hot ones this week, two hot memes. Let's do this one.
01:47:46.568 - 01:47:48.190, Speaker B: I love. Spoil our listeners.
01:47:48.350 - 01:47:52.962, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I feel spoiled by this meme. Why don't you talk about it?
01:47:53.016 - 01:48:22.810, Speaker B: Okay, so this meme went around the whole world. I had like three of my friends show me this meme on Instagram. That's how I know it's a big deal because all my normie friends sent it to me. So this is Frodo leaning over Gollum's shoulder while Gollum sits at a computer looking at a picture of the Ring, the Lord of the Rings ring. And Frodo says to Gollum, you can't own the precious physically, but you can pay to have your name listed as its owner in an online distributed database.
01:48:24.270 - 01:48:25.420, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
01:48:26.530 - 01:48:30.154, Speaker B: It's definitely a knock on nfts but I think it's in jovial jest.
01:48:30.282 - 01:48:34.430, Speaker A: It's totally hilarious. And Gullum's got this incredulous look on his face.
01:48:34.580 - 01:48:38.530, Speaker B: He just doesn't quite get it, but he's doing it anyways and doesn't know why.
01:48:38.600 - 01:48:40.322, Speaker A: Do you have a Gullum voice? I want you to do this.
01:48:40.376 - 01:48:41.890, Speaker B: I do not have a Gullum voice.
01:48:44.310 - 01:48:53.080, Speaker A: I'm not going to show my Gullum voice. I do have one, but that's for another podcast. Wow. Not a crypto podcast run by Ryan. Next time, maybe.
01:48:53.690 - 01:48:55.910, Speaker B: All right, meme number two. Meme number two.
01:48:55.980 - 01:48:57.414, Speaker A: Yeah. What's this? What are we looking at?
01:48:57.452 - 01:49:23.642, Speaker B: Okay, so this is that meme that's going around where there's like an iconic figure and it ends in like, or really long. I don't get why, but this one is the tax optimizer and there's a bunch of just like things. Attribute characteristics of the tax optimizer. Prefers selling at a loss. No taxable gains. Thinks the tax rate is 100%. Did you hold that for twelve months? For long term gains.
01:49:23.642 - 01:49:43.894, Speaker B: Only takes profits to pay taxes. Always says the words just wait for taxes. Wants to set you up with their accountant. You should have seen the taxes I paid in 2017. You know that's a taxable event, right? Just a bunch of behaviors that there are certain people out there. You guys might know one, he's on this podcast right now.
01:49:44.012 - 01:50:11.198, Speaker A: Okay, come on, man. I am feeling attacked right now, okay. By the tax optimizer meme, because this guy looks a lot like me, number one. And these attributes sound super familiar in the way I think sometimes. But yeah, look, I think these memes are hilarious because they kind of characterize individuals and like the tendency to go overboard on something. Right. In a playful, fun way.
01:50:11.198 - 01:50:43.770, Speaker A: And I have definitely fallen prey to being like, the tax optimizer. But there's another trap, I think, which is like the crypto dude that never thinks about taxes and doesn't even factor that into any equation whatsoever. Right? And I'm always like, to that person, I want to say, like, oh, are you not going to live in your country anymore? Are you going to be a fugitive in the nation that you see then? If you don't want those things, don't piss off the IRS. Pay your taxes, right?
01:50:43.840 - 01:50:44.554, Speaker B: Certainly.
01:50:44.752 - 01:51:00.160, Speaker A: But there is truth in that you can't let it affect the way you trade and make decisions. And if you over index on that and just care about taxes and optimizing those things, you're going to miss out on opportunities when I've made mistakes. I've probably done that before.
01:51:00.930 - 01:51:22.518, Speaker B: I do have to say, I'm definitely on the opposite side of the spectrum than Ryan is. And that is why I pay someone else to care about my taxes for me. So if you are the opposite of what Ryan is, but you also don't want to go to jail, and you know that you're somebody that is not a tax optimizer, go find someone and pay them to care for you. That's my alpha there.
01:51:22.604 - 01:51:41.446, Speaker A: In the words of the tax optimizer, then, David, I want to set you up with my accountant. Can I help with that? It is me. Guys, none of this has been tax advice. God knows it wasn't financial advice, either. Eth is risky. Bitcoin is risky. All of Defi is risky.
01:51:41.446 - 01:51:49.258, Speaker A: You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But thanks for joining us on the bankless journey.
01:51:49.354 - 01:52:31.464, Speaker B: And if you're on the YouTube, here's a five minute video about Jamis going and discovering the Wu Tang album and listening to it. Here we go. Acquisition of the Wutang album.
01:52:31.512 - 01:52:33.144, Speaker A: Well, he has beef.
01:52:33.192 - 01:52:35.004, Speaker B: You know he does this.
01:52:35.042 - 01:52:37.392, Speaker A: Shao, I'm gonna erase all your.
01:52:37.526 - 01:52:39.088, Speaker B: This album right here.
01:52:39.254 - 01:53:45.940, Speaker C: Right here. This is like the OG NFT, right? The original fight against the middlemen who are rent seeking and crypto is the same ethos. Wu Tang Clan was prescient in understanding that. Man. Jamis, you want me to give you a top five?
01:53:46.010 - 01:53:48.410, Speaker B: Give me a top five. Boogie baggage. Okay.
01:53:51.980 - 01:54:36.130, Speaker C: It's the only CD that exists, right? The only version of this. If one thing goes wrong, that's it. I am very lucky to be here right now doing this. That's incredible. Did it take care? There would be.
01:55:01.620 - 01:55:03.120, Speaker A: It's from the original.
01:55:04.980 - 01:55:30.810, Speaker C: We have these little watch gears down here. Let's go. God, it's not scary at all. Okay, it. Hear that? What's that?
01:55:31.260 - 01:55:33.850, Speaker B: The disc moving around, I guess, while it reads it.
01:55:36.620 - 01:56:05.090, Speaker C: It's making me nervous. Could just be reading it in DLC, I think, which is definitely fucking the shit up right now. All right, we're going to try this over time. Please work.
01:56:14.500 - 01:56:15.992, Speaker B: That's more like it.
01:56:16.166 - 01:56:55.780, Speaker C: There's. Oh, my God. This is so good. Let's go. Congratulations. Wait to see what the world's gonna say. One chapter closes, another one opens.
01:56:56.440 - 01:56:56.948, Speaker B: Exactly.
01:56:57.034 - 01:57:18.490, Speaker C: You guys were sipping on that champagne. Yeah, maybe a little bit. Pleaserdad's mission is always in flex. There is no definitive methodology that we apply to each acquisition. We're going to looking for iconic pieces that resonate with Internet history, with culture, with the populace at large across the entire world.
