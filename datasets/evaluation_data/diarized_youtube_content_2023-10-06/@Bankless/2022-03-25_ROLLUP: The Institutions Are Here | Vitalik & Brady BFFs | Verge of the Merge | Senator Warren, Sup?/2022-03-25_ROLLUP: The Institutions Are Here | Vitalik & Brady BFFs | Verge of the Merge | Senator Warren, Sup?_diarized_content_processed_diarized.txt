00:00:00.170 - 00:00:02.938, Speaker A: Whoa, wait, who said that the metaverse is rendered at the periphery?
00:00:02.954 - 00:00:04.190, Speaker B: Did we say that? That's my line.
00:00:04.260 - 00:00:05.502, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great line.
00:00:05.556 - 00:00:07.210, Speaker B: That's a David Hoffman original, brother.
00:00:07.290 - 00:00:07.678, Speaker A: Wow.
00:00:07.764 - 00:00:08.654, Speaker B: Yeah, you like that one?
00:00:08.692 - 00:00:21.322, Speaker A: Great. No, I love that one. That's a man. Yeah. We should start a podcast. Hey, bankless nation. Happy fourth week of March, David.
00:00:21.322 - 00:00:22.766, Speaker A: It's Friday morning. What time is it?
00:00:22.788 - 00:00:31.014, Speaker B: Oh, it's the bankless Friday weekly rollup, Ryan, where we cover the entire week in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor. This week's pretty tame. It's pretty.
00:00:31.052 - 00:00:31.446, Speaker A: Okay.
00:00:31.548 - 00:00:37.590, Speaker B: It's going to be fun, though. There's a lot of interesting things going on, Ryan, there's some hot headlines. So tell us what's going down this week.
00:00:37.660 - 00:00:43.434, Speaker A: Yeah, usually you're more intimidated by the length this agenda, but this week maybe feels manageable, David, is that what you're telling us?
00:00:43.472 - 00:00:47.878, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a five out of ten on the crazy scale, which is modest for crypto.
00:00:48.054 - 00:00:56.334, Speaker A: Five out of ten. All right. Okay, so here's what we're going to talk about. Yuga labs. The apes bought the punks. Well, actually, that happened last week. Okay.
00:00:56.334 - 00:01:14.066, Speaker A: But this week they just got $450,000,000 in funding. What are they going to do with this? They're going to build a real metaverse. A real metaverse. And a 16 z is in on this, of course. And we have the deck. We have the slide deck. We know exactly what they are planning to do.
00:01:14.066 - 00:01:23.990, Speaker A: So we're going to comments on that. Also, Vitalik Butyrin made the COVID of Time magazine. This led to a lot of hilarious Twitter threads, I think.
00:01:24.060 - 00:01:25.554, Speaker B: Hilarious Twitter threads.
00:01:25.602 - 00:01:46.042, Speaker A: Yeah, we're going to talk about that. Also, GameStop released their first NFT marketplace that's out. It's built on loop ring. And the loop ring community is absolutely stoked about this. Couldn't be more excited. Number going up a little bit, so we'll talk about that, too. And of course, more of our weekly cringe out of Elizabeth Warren.
00:01:46.042 - 00:02:04.450, Speaker A: She's proposing new things in Congress, anti crypto things, shadowy supercoder things. So of know we got to comment on that because this sort of stuff can't happen in a free western liberal democracy where property rights should count for something. So we're going to talk about that, too.
00:02:04.520 - 00:02:09.606, Speaker B: The consistency of cringe out of Elizabeth Warren is just every single week at this point.
00:02:09.708 - 00:02:11.762, Speaker A: But also, Elizabeth, come on the podcast.
00:02:11.826 - 00:02:14.786, Speaker B: Because we're friendly and we don't bite.
00:02:14.978 - 00:02:31.850, Speaker A: It's true. David, before we get in, we got to talk about the permissionless conference that is coming up. We are on the road to permissionless right now. This is going to be the Defi conference of the year. Not just defi. Also in the metaverse. Also, we're going to talk about institutional stuff as well.
00:02:31.850 - 00:02:35.822, Speaker A: A lot of people are going to be there. Who are some of the speakers you're most looking forward to seeing?
00:02:35.876 - 00:02:56.654, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Some of my best friends out there. Justin Drake. We're going to be talking about Etha's ultrasound money, of course, on the verge of the merge because this is happening. Is that a panel title working? We're working to the verge of the merge, Ryan, because the permission list is in two months. Two months. You have two months to get your ticket, and in two months, we will be on the cusp of the merge.
00:02:56.654 - 00:03:08.914, Speaker B: I mean, excuse me, pardon me. The verge of the merge. So Justin Drake is going to be talking all about that, of course. Chris Dixon from the famous web3 mental models podcast you guys know all about. Chris. Nick Carter is going to talk about stablecoins. Eric.
00:03:08.914 - 00:03:37.294, Speaker B: Peter, it's Eric Peters, who's been on the podcast before, is going to talk about some changing world order type content, I'm guessing. And then we also got Jiho from Axie Infinity, Jake Shravinsky. For all the legal minds out there, Ryan Selkis Stannie from Ave. It's going to be, I think, the hottest event of the summer. And this is, of course, where Ryan and I will meet for the very first time. So it's going to be a fun time. Bankless books their Airbnb.
00:03:37.294 - 00:03:44.020, Speaker B: So bankless has an Airbnb. There's going to be the bankless party. It's going to be sick as a lot. It's going to be very sick. Excuse me.
00:03:46.150 - 00:04:12.534, Speaker A: Palm Beach, Florida, too. The dates are May 17 through 19th. And David said you have two months to get these tickets. You kind of do, but also you kind of don't because number one, they're probably going to sell out in the coming weeks. And number two, they just get more expensive over time. All right, so there was a time you could purchase these tickets for like $15. I don't want to tell people that, but the price has gone up a lot since then and it will continue to go up until the date of the conference.
00:04:12.534 - 00:04:17.182, Speaker A: So book now, of course, if you have a bankless premium membership, you get a discount on this.
00:04:17.236 - 00:04:23.130, Speaker B: Big discount, not a little discount, is it? 20, 20%, 30%, 30%, 30%, 30%.
00:04:23.220 - 00:04:25.794, Speaker A: A generous, a healthy discount for your.
00:04:25.832 - 00:04:27.438, Speaker B: Whole entire premium membership.
00:04:27.534 - 00:04:50.666, Speaker A: It really does. No brainers there. Also another no brainer. Connect your wallet to xerion. Xerion is like the best. When I first discovered Xerion getting into crypto, right? It's just like, oh, my God, I can bring my assets to the interface rather than being locked inside of the interface, like with a Wells Fargo account. And they were adding features all of the time.
00:04:50.666 - 00:05:22.706, Speaker A: Some of my favorite features that they've added recently is like multichain support, ethereum, optimism. So l two s, avalanches, alternative l ones, they also have phantom support. They just added Salana support. So this is like their first non EVM chain. So you know how you have your assets scattered all over the crypto universe here? You can organize that. You can track them all in one single mission control center user interface for your defi antics. Also, David, there's some bridging capability here.
00:05:22.808 - 00:05:23.490, Speaker B: Bridge.
00:05:23.910 - 00:05:27.142, Speaker A: I know you like to bridge. What can you do here?
00:05:27.196 - 00:06:05.662, Speaker B: Yeah, so we're going to be in a multi chain world, whether with multi layer one, multi layer two, it's going to happen. And you shouldn't have to go to the optimism website or the arbitrum website to go and use their portals. You should just go to Xerion because they got it all for you. Imagine just like a triple monitor, five monitor setup, and you have, like, all, this is what Xerion does. It's your battle station for the multi chain world, and it makes it extremely easy to bridge to all the other layer twos. One of the fun stories I like to tell about why people should load up their address to something like Xerion. Like the first time I did it, Ryan, you discovered things.
00:06:05.716 - 00:06:05.850, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:05.860 - 00:06:21.830, Speaker B: You know how sometimes you discover $20 in your pocket? Yeah. Xerion will tell you everything about the state of the tokens that you have. So there's a decent chance you have tokens that you aren't even aware of. So go check your pants pockets by loading up your address into Xerion.
00:06:22.570 - 00:06:26.726, Speaker A: All that change in the cushions of your couch, shake all that out. Go find it.
00:06:26.748 - 00:06:27.814, Speaker B: Go turn it into.
00:06:28.012 - 00:06:45.230, Speaker A: I honestly, I found some nfts this way, too, because they have an NFT viewer. These are not my nfts, but I was like, oh, I own some. Okay, nfts. And they're actually worth something, which is kind of cool to know, especially nfts aren't worth as much as they were maybe a month or two ago.
00:06:45.300 - 00:06:50.398, Speaker B: And then what happened next was Ryan pulled out his tax document and started up true too.
00:06:50.484 - 00:07:03.266, Speaker A: True story. Anyway, guys, go check that out. Go connect your wallets to Xerion and get this all in one place. Of course, we will include a link in the show notes because that's what we do for you. Market time. David, bitcoin, what do you got happy.
00:07:03.288 - 00:07:21.218, Speaker B: Say about happy bitcoin? Happy bitcoin. Happy crypto prices this week. Yeah, bitcoin started the week at $41,000, ending the week right where it is right now at $44,000, up 7% on the week. A little bit of chop from a to b, but here we are at $44,000. The bulls are bullish.
00:07:21.314 - 00:07:33.306, Speaker A: I thought we were down only. How are we doing this? This is like, know it's rising above some of these local peaks. The last, like early March peak. Is this a pre war conflict peak here?
00:07:33.328 - 00:07:39.498, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly are. We are starting to get higher than where we were pre russian invasion of Ukraine.
00:07:39.674 - 00:07:42.206, Speaker A: That is crazy. And how about Eth? What's that looking like?
00:07:42.308 - 00:07:56.306, Speaker B: Same. Yeah, started the week at 2800. That was the low. And we are currently just below 3100. Basically call it $3,100. We got up to $3,120 right before recording. Dipped a little bit down right below it.
00:07:56.306 - 00:08:04.630, Speaker B: But again, chop between the a to the b at the start of the week, to the end of the week. But overall, when you zoom out and look at it smoothly, it is a lineup.
00:08:05.690 - 00:08:22.670, Speaker A: I think I've told you before that that three k number is really important to me. Anytime it's above three k, it's a good day. Right? It feels bullish. Feels like we're the pull of the bear market. So, wow. Up on the week. And is this on any news or anything, David, like, why are we going up?
00:08:22.820 - 00:08:42.834, Speaker B: There's a bunch of reasons I could hypothesize about, but I don't really have any strong conviction about any of them. So I think the trade, if you're a trader putting on your trade or hat is just an overall mean, like, Ryan, zoom out to the four month time frame or something like that. Three months?
00:08:42.872 - 00:08:43.602, Speaker A: Yeah, do that.
00:08:43.656 - 00:09:17.790, Speaker B: Yeah. So I guess the mean reversion trade has actually started to already kind of play out going from 2600 to like, 3200, but there's also the mean reversion trade of going from like 3000 back to 4000. And so two different trade time frames for trades on the menu. But sometimes people are like, well, the sellers just got exhausted and there's not enough sellers to keep on making price go down. And even though macro is still super bearish crypto. Whenever crypto disassociates from macro, it's usually to the bullish side. And I think that's perhaps what's going on.
00:09:17.940 - 00:09:36.830, Speaker A: Yeah, at some point, I'm definitely far from calling this sort of thing right. I still believe we're very much in kind of like a crab market season sideways action. But at some point, prices get high enough, it does break the back of the bear market and the bear market fears, I don't know what price point that is for ETh.
00:09:36.910 - 00:09:40.918, Speaker B: Certainly higher than 3100. Yeah, certainly still have room to go.
00:09:41.004 - 00:09:44.482, Speaker A: Do you think it's all time high? Like, what are we all time high for? Eth?
00:09:44.546 - 00:10:23.262, Speaker B: I mean. Okay, so we can definitely look at some trends. Right, 4600. But also can you make that window go away? The 3300 number is kind of aware we were hanging around 3300 between August and September of 2021. We were hanging around 3300 at the start of 2022 before we broke it down. So I would say breaking 3300 and getting into the area between 3000 304,000 is like, starts to feel that's the healing window. And then it's just absolutely confirmed by the time we get above 4000, obviously, because bullishness begets bullishness.
00:10:23.262 - 00:11:00.910, Speaker B: But there's very little price action above 4000. We haven't spent a lot of time, only a couple of months of time above 4000. And so above 4000 is price discovery. And so if you're not into the trade by then, you've kind of missed out on it a lot. But that's when you can kind of start to ask yourself, like, well, there's not really much information here about what happens next. Therefore, you have permission to be bullish about price discovery once again, especially because it's not going to just zoom from 3000 to 4000 and it's not going to do it in one month. It's done it before it could do it, but it's probably not.
00:11:00.910 - 00:11:14.478, Speaker B: But you start to look out at the two, three, four month time horizons, and that's when the merge happens. So once again, the alignment between the timing of the merge and the shape of the charts is interesting, and we will actually be able to see that. Ryan, when we look at the ETH.
00:11:14.494 - 00:11:36.566, Speaker A: BTC ratio, I think that's where we're going next. But I got to say, this is kind of not supposed to happen that way. Right. According to the sentiment that I'm feeling like, it's like the sentiment is we're in kind of this crab market and we're still destined to go down. But it seems like we're kind of starting to reverse those trends, and we'll see if that continues. But what's the ratio?
00:11:36.598 - 00:12:11.570, Speaker B: Sentiment doesn't cause market action. It generally follows it. Okay, so this is the long term view of the ETH BTC ratio, back when things got really, really crazy in 2017, 2018. And then we had the 2018 to 2020 bear market. And now you can see this channel that we're forming. And the ETH BTC ratio. We were talking about how, for, like, there was three to four months of straight downwards price action, both in dollar terms and in ETH BTC terms, starting in November, December of 2021, to basically, like, three weeks ago, and we bounced off the bottom of that trendline.
00:12:11.570 - 00:12:28.730, Speaker B: And kind of the self fulfilling prophecy meme is that you bounce from trendline to trendline. And so we go from zero, 7.65, where we at the bottom, to, like, something like 95, which is really bullish.
00:12:29.310 - 00:12:31.610, Speaker A: What's our flipping watch number for this?
00:12:31.680 - 00:12:48.020, Speaker B: Oh, I know that. 1.158. Ryan, I do have it memorized. Yeah. So we need basically a doubling, a little bit more than a doubling of the EtH price with the current bitcoin price thing to flip it. Yeah, it's pretty high. It's pretty high up there.
00:12:48.390 - 00:12:49.218, Speaker A: Never been there.
00:12:49.304 - 00:12:57.702, Speaker B: Never. No, we have not. The spikes on the very far left, this is coinbase. The spikes on the very far left are noise. You don't see that on any other chart. Fun fact.
00:12:57.836 - 00:13:09.734, Speaker A: He got it. Okay, cool. That's somebody who observes his ratio right there. Bankless bed index. A third, a third, a third. Bitcoin, ETH and DPi. What are we doing there? Yeah.
00:13:09.772 - 00:13:13.558, Speaker B: Start of the week at 97 ended the week where we are now at 113.
00:13:13.654 - 00:13:13.866, Speaker A: Wow.
00:13:13.888 - 00:13:21.706, Speaker B: That's higher than when I wrote it down a couple of minutes ago. We are up roughly eight and a half percent bullish overall. Bullish on the market.
00:13:21.888 - 00:13:49.190, Speaker A: I will take that. Let's talk about these outflows. It's really cool when we see big outflows. I think you can track it all on chain. This is into the block doing it. The largest outflows in 2022 so far, over 180K ETH was withdrawn from centralized exchanges in a single day. The last time such a magnitude of ETH left exchanges was in October 2021, preceding a 15% price increase within ten days.
00:13:49.190 - 00:14:08.506, Speaker A: Also of note, 190K ETH was also deposited into Lido's staking ETH contract into the lido staking pool. What's happening here? Are people, like, withdrawing their ETH to stake it. Is this like merge hype catching up with the actions of the market now? Is this what we're seeing?
00:14:08.608 - 00:14:32.850, Speaker B: Well, I mean, this happened at around the same time that we saw a very large increase in the validator queue. The queue to get into estaking. For those that don't know, you can't just go and send your EtH to a smart contract and begin staking. You have to enter and exit out of a queue. And that queue is just meant to stabilize the security around the proof of stake chain. Right. Like, we want to make sure that this security of the chain doesn't go up and down too fast.
00:14:32.850 - 00:14:39.506, Speaker B: So they have like a bottleneck. You got to wait to get in and out. The wait to get in, I think, is a, by the way, you can't.
00:14:39.538 - 00:14:46.582, Speaker A: Get out right now just for everything. So it's a one way ticket now, but there will be a way out and we'll also have a queue out.
00:14:46.636 - 00:14:57.180, Speaker B: Yes. You tell me that there were significant outflows out of exchanges and there's significant ETH queuing for the validator. Like, well, I mean, I know how to interpret data.
00:14:59.390 - 00:15:01.494, Speaker A: Do you know how to interpret bullish data, David?
00:15:01.542 - 00:15:24.366, Speaker B: I think so. I think so, yeah. That's like the other reason why this is always bullish. We always like to see, for a number of reasons, why ether leaving exchanges. Same with bitcoin. Bitcoin leaving exchanges going into either, like, private keys, self custody addresses, or smart contracts. One is bullish just because a lot of price discovery happens on centralized exchanges.
00:15:24.366 - 00:16:19.778, Speaker B: Centralized exchanges determine what the price is. So any new buying demand goes onto centralized exchanges first. And so any new demand for ether is now that there's 180,000 less ether on centralized exchanges, a dollar worth of ETH purchase means a lot more to the price just because things are a lot more sensitive when there's a lot less ether on secondary markets, there's a lot less volume. And so that's the bullish side of things. There's also the philosophical side of things is we have 180,000 more ether that's bankless or bankless ether. There's people using smart contracts, people using DFI, people moving their ether out of centralized exchanges, which definitely seems to fit the narrative, the trend of the last two months or so of nation states looking over at crypto and being like, I don't like what you guys are doing. And so then what we do, we withdraw our ether?
00:16:19.954 - 00:16:28.918, Speaker A: We're going to sanction you? Yeah, that's the name of the show, is bankless so just went bankless. More assets, more bankless. It's awesome.
00:16:29.004 - 00:16:31.514, Speaker B: Bankless. This is the world we're here to build.
00:16:31.632 - 00:16:42.134, Speaker A: Decentralization. Absolutely. Let's talk about the world do Kwan is here to build. We talked about this a little bit. You like these segues? They're getting better, Dave.
00:16:42.182 - 00:16:42.826, Speaker B: Yeah, they are getting better.
00:16:42.848 - 00:17:06.710, Speaker A: Do Kwan reveals a plan to increase usts. That's the stablecoin on the Luna network. The terra network, I should say. Bitcoin reserve. Just jack that up to $3 billion. So last week we talked about Doequan saying, hey, eventually I want at least $10 billion worth of bitcoin backing UST. So Ust is like an algorithmic stablecoin.
00:17:06.710 - 00:17:38.650, Speaker A: Primarily, it's backed by Luna, the value of Luna, and we've seen a lot of algo stablecoins. Not to be like the old geezers on the podcast, but you and I have seen a lot of algorithmic stablecoins rise and fall in our day. Many of them, right. And I've always thought of them as interesting experiments. Right. And maybe we can get one right at some point in time, but haven't yet. There's always been sort of a crash in cataclysm.
00:17:38.650 - 00:17:58.546, Speaker A: I think Doe is wanting to mitigate that a little bit by adding multiple collaterals to his algorithmic stablecoin, not just Luna, but also bitcoin. So increasing to 3 billion bitcoin, that is going to be backing this. What are your thoughts here, David?
00:17:58.738 - 00:18:15.190, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it makes sense, right? Multi collateral backed stablecoins. I've heard this one before. Makerdao is this model. I'm currently in a little bit of a Twitter tussle with Doe Kwan, because he made this tweet saying, by my hand, die, the Dai stablecoin will die. Like have a death.
00:18:15.270 - 00:18:16.442, Speaker A: Wait, what did he say?
00:18:16.576 - 00:18:24.000, Speaker B: He said, by my hand, dai will die. As in, like, he wants to kill die. He wants to outcompete die. And I'm like.
00:18:25.730 - 00:18:27.502, Speaker A: I know the musk shit, man.
00:18:27.556 - 00:18:50.582, Speaker B: Right? It's some Icarus level stuff, dude. What he's really saying is MKR price is going to go down while Luna Price is going to go up. But, dude, you can't kill die. It's like one of the most battle tested, decentralized stablecoins of all time. Sure, we can, elders, we can talk. Yeah. Plus, you're just recreating the maker down model in a different way.
00:18:50.716 - 00:19:04.970, Speaker A: Anyways, there's more steps in some ways, right? There's more custody. Although maker and Dai to be fair. Has a lot of centralized stablecoin backing it at this point in time, certainly. But go on, say more.
00:19:05.040 - 00:19:16.750, Speaker B: Okay, so I tweeted after to his response, my money's on Dai. As in like, no do Kwan, you're not going to kill Dai. And so on Twitter, he gives me this, let's see if I can. No, that's not.
00:19:16.900 - 00:19:17.930, Speaker A: Is that Nick Cage?
00:19:18.010 - 00:19:51.130, Speaker B: Yeah, it's Nick Cage. Oh, really? And then does the empty brain meme just making fun of me. And it's just always funny when I see l one founders engaging in just kind of degenerate Twitter antics. Anyways, I have dms out to do Quan to do an AMA on bankless, all about what he's up to with Terra and all this. So all of the Luna shills that are in my dms trying to get me to get Doe Kwan on bankless, go to him, tell him, because he has the invite. He has the invite.
00:19:51.550 - 00:19:55.500, Speaker A: Dms inbound. Doe, we'd love to have you on the show. Want to talk a little bit more.
00:19:57.150 - 00:19:58.934, Speaker B: Hear about your plan to kill die.
00:19:58.982 - 00:20:33.622, Speaker A: I'd love to hear also what's going on here. We've got, I guess, a burn watch we should talk a little bit about. So 6 billion ETH has been burnt to date. $6 billion worth of ETH has been burnt. We're not even a year into EIP 15. Five, nine, David, we got 6 billion ETH burnt. But also the burn rate right now, as of when we are talking about this, this week in the last couple of weeks has plunged to a seven month low.
00:20:33.622 - 00:21:00.154, Speaker A: That is why because gas fees are low, because blocks based demand has decreased, so transactions are cheaper. A byproduct of that is we actually burn less ETH, even though we're burning less ETH, though we're still burning a lot. This is ultrasound money again, where you can simulate the burn on the one day, for instance, in a post merge world. When's the merge going to happen? Is it June, David?
00:21:00.202 - 00:21:00.846, Speaker B: June to August, maybe.
00:21:00.868 - 00:21:22.630, Speaker A: We'll talk about that. June to August, we'll talk about that. We would be still burning 0.9% of total eth supply per year. So that would be deflationary. That would be ultrasound Eth in this scenario, post in a post merge world. So still a lot of ETH being burnt, but not as much as before.
00:21:22.700 - 00:21:42.506, Speaker B: What are your thoughts here, Ryan? If the amount of ether that was burnt was a token on coin market cap or coin gecko, it would come in 24th, right ahead of bitcoin cash it would be the 24th highest market cap token, the amount of ether that's burnt. So there's your fun fact for the day.
00:21:42.608 - 00:21:57.246, Speaker A: Oh, that is a fun fact. We haven't talked about the burn in at least, like, three or four shows, so we got to bring it back because it happens. I bet we have on a weekly basis. Don't fact check us. Don't fact check us. Pinkless nation. Okay.
00:21:57.246 - 00:22:05.954, Speaker A: Mabel finance. They just originated $1 billion worth of loans. This is a protocol for DeFi services for institutions, which is kind of cool.
00:22:05.992 - 00:22:07.554, Speaker B: Because I think that fixed money markets.
00:22:07.602 - 00:22:07.814, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:07.852 - 00:22:09.414, Speaker B: Aggregation of loans. Yeah.
00:22:09.532 - 00:22:21.882, Speaker A: And that's a theme of today's episode, which is like, hey, the institutions, they're not coming. They're already here. And this is them here in DeFi. So what is maple finance again? Can you refresh us?
00:22:21.936 - 00:22:40.862, Speaker B: Yeah. Fixed money market, it aggregates a bunch of loans and simplifies it, and it just makes life easier for institutions who are trying to get yield in DFI. Maple finance has been grinding for years. I remember talking to them back in my realty days. 2019 to 2020, Australia. Australia based. Australia based.
00:22:40.862 - 00:22:50.434, Speaker B: Yeah. So definitely, like, true to the good ethos, true builders of good DFI products. So just tip of the hat to maple finance. Congratulations for breaking $1 billion.
00:22:50.552 - 00:22:54.606, Speaker A: Look at this. Congratulations on this tie. Sid Powell from Maple Finance.
00:22:54.638 - 00:22:58.500, Speaker B: Hey, that's what happens when you have to deal with institutions. You wear two.
00:22:59.750 - 00:23:13.850, Speaker A: That's just for the headshot, right? All right, guys, we will be back with the releases of the week, and, of course, the hot news of the week. We're going to get to Vitalik on the COVID of Time and some other things. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:23:14.000 - 00:23:50.738, Speaker B: Living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys, and that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet. And brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the Ledger Nanos Plus, a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet. With more memory and a larger screen, the Nanos plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions. And the paired Ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your NFT. What you see is what you sign. The Nanos plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things. So go to the Ledger website to check out the features of the new Ledger Nanos plus and join the waitlist to get yours.
00:23:50.738 - 00:24:16.522, Speaker B: And don't forget about the crypto life card. Also powered by Ledger. The CL card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app, right next to all the defi apps and services that you're already used to doing, like swapping tokens and staking. So if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet, go to ledger.com, grab a ledger and take control over your crypto. If you're going bankless, you need Metamask. This is your tool to unlock the world of defi without giving up custody over your private keys.
00:24:16.522 - 00:24:58.106, Speaker B: Metamask is both a secure in browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet. You can now trade tokens on any Dex or aggregator. Metamask swap gathers real time pricing information across all the DeFi exchanges, allowing you to select your best price while getting all the metamask benefits of self custody, lower gas costs, and increased transaction success rates. Metamask also has a fantastic mobile wallet that I use when I'm out and about which I use to collect poaps, nfts and do all my DFI things while I'm away from home. If you haven't downloaded Metamask, you got to try it out. Web three wouldn't be the same without it. Download metamask for desktop and mobile at Metamask IO and load up your treasure ledger, lattice or Keystone hardware wallets so that they too can get into the world of web3.
00:24:58.106 - 00:25:47.126, Speaker B: Polygon is Ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date. With millions of monthly users and all of the biggest DFI apps, the Polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of defi activity. Transactions on Polygon are quick and cheap, allowing users the freedom to achieve their DeFi goals, all while being economically anchored to Ethereum. But Polygon isn't just the proof of stake sidechain. The Polygon team is building a suite of scaling solutions, including Polygon, Hermes, maiden, nightfall, and Xero, all with different design choices in order to be optimized for all possible crypto use cases. If you're a developer who wants to build on the Polygon ecosystem, go to the link in the show notes to check out their fantastic documentation. And if you're a user who just wants to experience fast and cheap defi, you can bridge over your eth or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on Polygon.
00:25:47.238 - 00:26:18.002, Speaker A: All right guys, we are back with the releases of the week. Got to start with this release. This made some waves loopring's LRC, their LRC token is up. And that's because there was a beta release of GameStop's NFT marketplaces built on loop ring that was just released. This is a little bit what it looks like. You can connect your wallet, you can add funds to loop rings, layer two here, Gamestop plus Ethereum, layer two. That seems like a good marriage.
00:26:18.002 - 00:26:26.854, Speaker A: Now, we also, I think, heard about immutable doing this with GameStop as well. So I'm a little bit confused because.
00:26:26.892 - 00:26:29.062, Speaker B: It feels like we're getting some mixed messages here.
00:26:29.116 - 00:26:34.700, Speaker A: Yeah, GameStop's definitely on layer two, but they're dating two different layer twos right now, it seems.
00:26:35.310 - 00:27:12.242, Speaker B: Well, actually, when you do the whole login with your wallet, there is actually no loopering, or actually, for that matter, immutable branding login. So what layer two is this? There's the formal relationship between GameStop and Immutable X, and they have that 100 million dollar fund. But then, okay, so the backstory here is that there is a former loopering business developer. We had him on the show, Matt Feinstein. Great, great guy, great guy, fantastic. But got poached by GameStop to start building out their NFT ecosystem. So loopering business developer went to GameStop.
00:27:12.242 - 00:27:37.054, Speaker B: I'm sure Matt, with knowing loopering in and out, connected GameStop to loop ring, and that's the connection there. But then GameStop, I think, elected to go with immutable, which I mean, makes sense because immutable x is a validium, which is off chain data, but on chain transactions, on chain assets. So it's super fast, super cheap. Loop ring is more, costs you nothing.
00:27:37.092 - 00:27:38.542, Speaker A: To mint things costs you nothing.
00:27:38.596 - 00:28:05.254, Speaker B: Well, it costs the network something, but it costs you the user. Nothing pays for it. Mutable just pays for it. Which makes sense because with loopering you still have like 30 cent transaction fees and everything's on chain. So it's actually better for very high value transactions. I would feel more comfortable having my crypto punk on loop ring than I would on immutable, but for gaming, makes less sense. And so there's no reason why they have to pick one NFT marketplace, one NFT platform.
00:28:05.254 - 00:28:17.862, Speaker B: But the mixed messaging here is a little bit confusing. So what are they actually doing with loop ring? I don't know. It's also interesting that loop ring is tweeting about this and not necessarily GameStop.
00:28:18.006 - 00:28:39.586, Speaker A: Yeah, I was just going to say that. But of course, anytime you tweet something about GameStop, it does quite well. It gets a lot of attention. Look at this and LRC price is up a little bit on this news, but maybe not a ton. I think the bigger spike with the price of the loop ring token actually happened. Like, look at this.
00:28:39.688 - 00:28:53.462, Speaker B: Back in November when the rumor started, rumors about the Matt Pinestone bridge loop ring relationship with GameStop happened. But then GameStop announced their relationship with immutable and then it kind of tanked back to the pre price, but now it's up just a little.
00:28:53.516 - 00:28:54.802, Speaker A: So got a little blip.
00:28:54.866 - 00:28:56.834, Speaker B: Yeah, market confused.
00:28:56.962 - 00:29:25.134, Speaker A: Market confused, but not super excited about that, which does maybe tell you something. Also, let's talk about this. A protocol called time swap just launched on the Polygon network. This is a fixed income lending and borrowing protocol for ERC 20s. It's built on polygon. I guess we've seen a lot of these lending and borrowing protocols. The special sauce here is no oracle somehow, so that makes it permissionless.
00:29:25.134 - 00:30:16.382, Speaker A: There's no governance apparatus. They're saying non liquidatable. They're also saying it's got fixed maturity, lending and borrowing, so you can kind of lock in the date at which these assets will mature. And of course, this is in defi, built on polygon. First, I guess my observation about this stuff, and I think we cover as many as we can and as many as we see, but so many launch that we're just not able to fit into the roll up every week. But one observation I've had is we're starting to see more innovation on the edges. And what I mean by that is the new protocols are being developed and launched, like the new weird stuff on layer twos and on sidechains first, not on Ethereum.
00:30:16.382 - 00:30:40.166, Speaker A: And once they prove themselves in kind of these more local jurisdictions, then maybe they make their way back to Ethereum and they kind of launch on main net. But the innovation is starting to happen at the edges. So I guess one message is like, be on the lookout for cool new projects on sidechains and layer twos. That's where the action is going to be. That's where the innovation is going to be in the future.
00:30:40.188 - 00:30:46.086, Speaker B: The alpha is always on the frontier. That's why we have the going west metaphor. It's the new frontier.
00:30:46.198 - 00:30:46.698, Speaker A: Oh my.
00:30:46.784 - 00:30:47.466, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:47.648 - 00:30:50.662, Speaker A: I mean, we were in Colorado, I guess now we're just headed.
00:30:50.726 - 00:30:53.498, Speaker B: We're headed west towards California, going to.
00:30:53.504 - 00:30:58.560, Speaker A: The more and more space.
00:30:59.090 - 00:31:39.642, Speaker B: And this makes sense, right? Because innovation needs to have cheap fees. If you're going to take risks, you need to have cheap fees. Because why would you take risks when you have to pay the fees of the Ethereum L one. So I think the process for this is that developers and the cost of innovation goes to zero on the layer two s. Developers are free to experiment, afraid to innovate, and then they are free to experiment and get their product market fit. And then if they do get it, it justifies returning back to Manhattan, back to the l one, and you can have your ceremony of just like, yo, we made it, guys. By deploying your contracts on the l one, because you have proven that there is sufficient demand to justify it on the layer two, the new frontier, l 222.
00:31:39.642 - 00:31:40.854, Speaker B: You like that one, Ryan?
00:31:40.982 - 00:31:59.330, Speaker A: I like it a lot, David. I don't know where you come up with this stuff, sir. It's just genius. Robinhood, they're coming up with some stuff, too. A new debit card that offers crypto rewards. Well, where have I seen that? Some of the quotes are interesting here. Of course, everyone's trying to get Gen Z now.
00:31:59.330 - 00:32:01.154, Speaker A: Sorry, millennials, you're no longer hot.
00:32:01.192 - 00:32:02.100, Speaker B: It's all about.
00:32:04.150 - 00:32:17.720, Speaker A: And the idea is to turn non crypto natives onto bitcoin. So basically, it's a debit card, because according to this article, Gen Z doesn't like credit cards. They just want debit cards. I don't know. That's what the article says, david. I don't know.
00:32:18.650 - 00:32:20.986, Speaker B: Decrypt the alpha for this. I'm not sure.
00:32:21.088 - 00:32:58.134, Speaker A: I don't know if that's true. But we do know they do like crypto. And so when you use your debit card, you can basically, if you're paying something and it's ninety cents, you can just round up to the dollar, and that 10% gets allocated to whatever you want, including crypto. You buy some eth with that. You buy some bitcoin with that little excess on your debit card. So I think the story here is like Robinhood becoming more crypto friendly and actually taking a page out of the crypto bank book. Right? Gemini does this already with their card, as does blockfi, as does, like, they're all going to do this.
00:32:58.134 - 00:33:05.190, Speaker A: And now fintech is coming to crypto for the new features, which is sort of interesting to me.
00:33:05.260 - 00:33:14.700, Speaker B: I will have to say that a crypto themed credit or debit card is like, okay, cool, you get the thumbs up, but there is no innovation points on that one.
00:33:16.510 - 00:33:22.358, Speaker A: It's probably table stakes. It's probably something you have to have to keep going. All right, man. You want to get to some raises?
00:33:22.454 - 00:33:25.118, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, let's go with this one. This one's awesome.
00:33:25.204 - 00:33:25.994, Speaker A: The mega race.
00:33:26.042 - 00:33:38.958, Speaker B: The mega race. Yes. Board Ape Yacht club creators, Yuga Labs raises $450,000,000. That is a large number. To build the first version of the Metaverse. These are my words. First version of the Metaverse.
00:33:38.958 - 00:34:02.554, Speaker B: But we talk about the metaverse a lot. Like, oh, nfTs. They are part of the metaverse. Digital land. They're part of the metaverse. Yuga Labs is on a race to build out the first fully fledged version of the metaverse. So complete with land, complete with NFTs being the board apes and all the other ip that labs owns, complete with people running around in their avatars doing board ape things.
00:34:02.554 - 00:34:31.426, Speaker B: They have the ape coin for the currency of that metaverse. So they are not doing just one part of the metaverse. They're doing the full entire metaverse. This funding round evaluates Yuga Labs at $4 billion, and using that kind of frame of reference for what Yuga Labs is building as a team that has been known to execute and execute very well. Remember when, Ryan, when board apes used to be considered, like, the poor man's punk, and now they're almost like, two x the floor price of punks, and.
00:34:31.448 - 00:34:33.394, Speaker A: How they just bought, like, punks last.
00:34:33.512 - 00:34:34.718, Speaker B: And they bought the punks.
00:34:34.814 - 00:34:35.682, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember that.
00:34:35.736 - 00:35:05.390, Speaker B: So people are looking at the ape coin drop at the current valuation of $13 billion, and being like, that is ridiculous. That's way too high. Usually airdrops happen. They have a spike of interest, but then they just basically bleed to zero. People in my mind are valuing this apecoin based on the value of a completely, fully fledged, first functional metaverse ever coming out of yuga Labs. And so that is the value. $13 billion.
00:35:05.390 - 00:35:17.262, Speaker B: That is absolutely insane. $13 billion airdrop. That makes the minting of a board ape perhaps one of the greatest investments of all time. I think it was 0.8 eth to mint an ape. So that's now, like, 100 eth.
00:35:17.326 - 00:35:19.726, Speaker A: Don't remind me. Okay, that's painful.
00:35:19.838 - 00:35:30.534, Speaker B: But then you also got the ape coin airdrop, Ryan, you also got probably. I think they got mutant apes airdropped as well. Maybe they had to mint those too. Yeah, minting an ape, one of the best investments of all time.
00:35:30.652 - 00:35:44.362, Speaker A: Dude. You know what? Maybe William Pister can do a metaversal post on that. You know what? I'd love to see the best NFT investments of all time. Like, compare the original, like, mint to this. But this is their slide deck, okay?
00:35:44.416 - 00:35:49.446, Speaker B: It's bullish. It's a pretty Chad deck. It's a Chad deck.
00:35:49.478 - 00:36:22.502, Speaker A: Well, when you've got a slide that just lists like twelve different celebrities and their names are Shaq, Post Malone, Snoop Dogg, Justin Bieber, Timberland, future, the Beebs name, Serena Williams, and they're all like apes, right? You've done something really well to kind of penetrate. And this is all about, I mean, there's so much in the slide deck, we'll include a link in the show, but, and we think like our conspiracy theory, right? It's like, I think you said this, that this was probably leaked to hype up what they're doing.
00:36:22.556 - 00:36:26.534, Speaker B: So people like bank the intentional leak. Yeah.
00:36:26.652 - 00:36:57.730, Speaker A: So this is basically like they're saying everyone's done crappy versions with the metaverse. No one else gets it. We have the brand and the ability to actually pull off a metaverse. The thing that Zuckerberg is talking about, that's the thing that we can build and we are going to build. And apecoin is the currency of this, the NFT early community. And all of our brands will be sort of the NFT layer and come hang with us. And this is going to be really awesome.
00:36:57.730 - 00:37:00.820, Speaker A: And now all we have to do is build it.
00:37:01.910 - 00:37:39.962, Speaker B: So if you want to hear more content about this, this news actually dropped while we were live streaming on the state of the nation on Tuesday about this exact topic. So you can go watch that state of the nation. It's about Yuga Labs buying the punks. But we also talk about what they're building. We had a number of builders on that show who were saying like, okay, yeah, Yuga Labs executed on the branding behind board apes, but building a metaverse, building digital land and all the other things that they're talking about, that's hard and that's something new. So sure, they have the ability to execute in one domain. Does that mean that it carries over to the ability to execute in like three other domains simultaneously?
00:37:40.106 - 00:38:16.134, Speaker A: TBD, I kind of agree with that take, which is like, you have one category of execution that you've absolutely crushed, and that is like narrative building, story building, branding, marketing, total points there. You total crushed it. But the metaverse, that is a different type of execution ability. Right. And the question is, can you now pull that off as well? And I guess we'll have to see. But they're definitely funded to do that. A 16 Z was involved in that funding round.
00:38:16.134 - 00:38:20.714, Speaker A: They did their profile pick of whatever board ape that they hold.
00:38:20.912 - 00:38:25.760, Speaker B: 3D glasses. Board ape with an astronaut suit. The astronaut suit is a nice touch.
00:38:26.130 - 00:38:29.790, Speaker A: You like this one? Yeah. They put it as their profile pick.
00:38:29.860 - 00:38:32.318, Speaker B: For a very short amount of time. That's one day.
00:38:32.404 - 00:38:57.400, Speaker A: The announcement day. That's all you get. Just one day. Okay, let's keep moving. FTX is backing a 500 million dollar crypto gaming platform on Terra. What's super interesting is these alt layer one ecosystems are also accruing their own funding funding rounds, too. And $500 million for a crypto gaming platform.
00:38:57.400 - 00:39:03.210, Speaker A: It just blows my mind, the money that is flowing into this space right now. Do you have any thoughts on this?
00:39:03.280 - 00:39:13.498, Speaker B: Yeah, no thoughts other than just that you would have no idea what the price action would be if it being down for the last four months based on the valuations that are being pulled in the private rounds.
00:39:13.594 - 00:39:32.980, Speaker A: Absolutely. Private rounds are not bearish. Yeah. Do you remember how the private rounds dried up in 2018 2019? People couldn't raise money. I remember talking to founders and they're like, it's really hard. We don't know if we're going to be able to survive. And this is not that type of bear market at all.
00:39:33.590 - 00:39:37.140, Speaker B: Thank you for printing all the money, Federal Reserve. Appreciate it.
00:39:38.790 - 00:39:43.442, Speaker A: All right. FDX, they just invested $100 million in an app, banking app called Dave.
00:39:43.506 - 00:39:46.902, Speaker B: Yeah, Ryan, I have a banking app that I sold for $100 million.
00:39:47.036 - 00:39:48.790, Speaker A: Is that yours, Dave?
00:39:49.370 - 00:39:51.106, Speaker B: Banking app called Dave.
00:39:51.298 - 00:39:58.282, Speaker A: They have Dave.com. I'm surprised that wasn't yours, Dave. Have you used this before?
00:39:58.336 - 00:40:00.842, Speaker B: I have not used this. This is the first time I've heard about this.
00:40:00.976 - 00:40:12.414, Speaker A: Okay. This is the first time David has heard about Dave. Anyway, this is an example, I think, of FTX. Like, I don't know what you'd call this, but going toward the tradfi side of things.
00:40:12.452 - 00:40:12.654, Speaker B: Right.
00:40:12.692 - 00:40:43.206, Speaker A: So FTX is obviously like a crypto exchange, a crypto bank, and now they are investing in tradfi, fintech companies, $100 million worth. So smart move. But this is all, like, we've had this thesis for a long time that crypto banks would just become basically neo banks. And this looks like what they're evolving into. Kind of see, cool to see crypto get involved a bit more in fintech. I don't know very much about Dave, but you should invite these guys to Dave Dow, David.
00:40:43.238 - 00:40:46.394, Speaker B: Oh, they're in Dave Dow just because.
00:40:46.432 - 00:40:49.750, Speaker A: Of the name worldcoin.
00:40:49.910 - 00:40:50.442, Speaker B: Oh, boy.
00:40:50.496 - 00:40:53.974, Speaker A: Okay. They just raised 100 million, dog. I feel like they just raised.
00:40:54.102 - 00:40:58.602, Speaker B: The last we heard about Worldcoin was because of their raise and their announcement.
00:40:58.746 - 00:41:10.414, Speaker A: Okay, so I wasn't making that up. They raised $100 million this time at a $3 billion token valuation. What is worldcoin for people who forgot about this thing. Okay, talk about a lot of raises.
00:41:10.542 - 00:41:55.678, Speaker B: There is a particular niche in crypto that has been tried a number of times, and that is the Sybil resistant token distribution, as in, can we distribute the same amount of tokens to everyone in the world? And so the attempt here is to make your token valuable by fairness, right? So if everyone has an equal amount, then that's super fair. And humans value fairness. Humans value legitimacy. Did a great podcast on this with Vitalik Feder entitled legitimacy. You should definitely listen to that if you haven't. And so this is an attempt for that. When they released the first time around, they got absolutely slaughtered on Twitter and in the public sphere because of how they actually went about trying to solve civil resistance.
00:41:55.678 - 00:42:36.766, Speaker B: And they did it with these super dystopian silver ball looking things that scans your iris, and it uses your iris and your fingerprints as like an anti civil mechanism. So it's the classic web two model of like, give us your data and we'll give you money. And so they got absolutely slaughtered on crypto Twitter. And they were funded by very big names like 3 hours capital a 16 z coinbase is now in this one coastal ventures. Right? They were in the news cycle, so we reached out to them to host them on state of the nation because it was hot in the news cycle. It's what we do. And they were afraid to come on.
00:42:36.766 - 00:42:49.982, Speaker B: We told them, like, you guys need to come on because you guys are getting slaughtered in the narrative. And if you ever want to justify or explain your project, you guys are welcome to use our platform to explain what you guys are up to. And they were too scared.
00:42:50.126 - 00:42:54.418, Speaker A: Do you think they backed out at the. Backed out, which surprised us.
00:42:54.584 - 00:42:58.758, Speaker B: Fun fact about that. You know what episode we did in lieu of that episode? Ryan, you remember?
00:42:58.924 - 00:42:59.398, Speaker A: No.
00:42:59.484 - 00:43:01.282, Speaker B: It was ultra scalable Ethereum.
00:43:01.426 - 00:43:02.070, Speaker A: Oh, really?
00:43:02.140 - 00:43:04.342, Speaker B: One of the most popular episodes of all time.
00:43:04.476 - 00:43:08.434, Speaker A: Oh, the one that we were just like, oh shit. Because we got rugged episode.
00:43:08.482 - 00:43:19.834, Speaker B: We got rugged. Yeah. They were like, yo, we don't want to come on anymore. We're not ready for the pr. And then I went back to the CEO and dmed him on Twitter. You're making a huge mistake. Bankless is one of the most fair platforms you'll ever get, ever.
00:43:19.834 - 00:43:30.366, Speaker B: And you're not going to get this opportunity again. And then he just didn't respond. And so instead we grounded out and produced the agenda for ultra scalable Ethereum. And it was one of the best episodes of all time.
00:43:30.388 - 00:43:54.786, Speaker A: I remember being very stressed with the cancellation there. We don't usually get cancellations. I don't think. Look, I am actually optimistic. I was cautiously optimistic about this. I think they may have gotten an unfair rap on Twitter in the crypto community. I wanted them to kind of explain themselves because they have made some really cool engineering decisions.
00:43:54.786 - 00:44:37.346, Speaker A: For example, they built this thing on a really interesting layer, two set of technology. So it's all, like, ultimately settled on ethereum. And I do think fair distribution this way is a monetary experiment that we've never been able to successfully try. So can we mitigate the privacy concerns that people have? I do think that they should spend some time with the crypto community and explain this. So I guess despite what we've just said and despite the previous invitation, I would still welcome these guys on at least somebody from their project to talk a little bit about worldcoin. But what they're in the news for is more funding, not necessarily, like, actual traction in progress. Right.
00:44:37.368 - 00:44:51.222, Speaker B: So we would know that there would be traction if people saw little silver balls in their neighborhood and we saw cues of people lining up to get their irises scanned. So bankless listeners, if you've seen that, tweet at us and let us know if you've seen that, because I certainly haven't.
00:44:51.366 - 00:45:11.774, Speaker A: Yes. And I will not be first in line for that one. Skip, that's a completely experiment. I'll just wait for it. At least come on the podcast first and we'll talk about it. This is kind of neat. This is under, I guess, the title of why work at a crypto fund when you can go start your own? Katie Hahn, she was at a 16 z.
00:45:11.774 - 00:45:31.910, Speaker A: She was a partner. She started her own fund recently. She just raised $1.5 billion for a web3 fund. Again, more money in the space, more people breaking off from the funds that they were in and starting their own. Here's another. This is a former polychain capital founder who just launched $125,000,000 fund.
00:45:31.910 - 00:46:12.420, Speaker A: Now, I guess the twist here is this fund is actually destined to become a Dow at some point in the future. Let me describe how that works. It says after the full 125,000,000 is invested, that's the initial fund amount, the fund will be dissolved, and Dow five will return the limited partnership capital to investors and convert the fund into a Dow, which, of course, is an online community that uses smart contracts, cryptocurrency, et cetera, et cetera. So that is the plan for this kind of a unique twist on things. Why join a fund when you could start your own? David, when bankless fund. Are we going to do a fund at some point?
00:46:13.030 - 00:46:19.000, Speaker B: I mean, we've talked about this. The answer is yes, if people are interested.
00:46:20.010 - 00:46:51.760, Speaker A: I have too much to do. Not anytime soon, guys. But, yeah, why start a fund when you can build your own? That is the question. And I think it's a question for everyone. Right. These crypto economic tools make it easier than ever to coordinate capital. So why not try some capital coordination experiments? If you're listening to bankless, if you're plugged into deFi, you're probably on the frontier and you're probably able to make some pretty good investment decisions, at least if you've been in this space for a little bit and have seen some cycles play out.
00:46:51.760 - 00:46:54.734, Speaker A: Let's see what Qualcomm does in the space.
00:46:54.772 - 00:46:58.498, Speaker B: Because this one's mine, Ryan, because Qualcomm is right around the corner from me.
00:46:58.584 - 00:46:59.534, Speaker A: They are in San Diego.
00:46:59.582 - 00:47:33.090, Speaker B: They're in San Diego. They drive by their office every now and then. 100 million dollar metaverse investment fund. And this is actually pretty interesting. And when I was reading this article, I was reminded of Kathy Wood's whole the future is nearer than we actually think. And there are like five megatrends in technology, one of them being blockchain, another one being basically kind of like AI chip. What Qualcomm is up to? So Qualcomm is putting $100 million into a metaverse fund to build out things like VR headsets and things that demand chips.
00:47:33.090 - 00:48:14.278, Speaker B: Because though they are investing in the metaverse because they think the metaverse will create net new demand for microchips, for silicon semiconductors, like the hardware side of the hardware side of the metaverse, right? And so this is the intersection of industries coming together to build out the future. And so, remindor, the metaverse is not just crypto. It is so many more other things. It is data centers and servers that can host persistent state of many, many different people from across the world, like significantly more massive mmorpgs. We need chips for that. It's headsets and immersive experiences. So these technologies are coming together, and Qualcomm is putting $100 million into that investment.
00:48:14.374 - 00:48:37.540, Speaker A: I do think crypto people forget about the hardware side of things. I mean, we are focused on the content, we're focused on the property to populate the metaverse and the people. But there's a lot of hardware and data center tech underneath all of this. This is another one, the teams behind the Mina protocol. I think that's how you say it? Mina protocol. They just raised 92 Mina. Okay?
00:48:38.070 - 00:48:39.486, Speaker B: I don't know the Mina protocol.
00:48:39.518 - 00:49:06.714, Speaker A: They just raised $92 million from Thera's capital, FTX, and others. This is a layer one chain, okay? And it is a privacy focused chain. I don't know very much about this, to be honest, David. I haven't gone down the rabbit hole on this one. I imagine it's probably proof of stake. I imagine it's using some advanced cryptography. I imagine it's also a smart contract platform.
00:49:06.714 - 00:49:11.606, Speaker A: Beyond that, I got to ask the question, do we have any more room for more layer one chains?
00:49:11.718 - 00:49:18.110, Speaker B: Well, we have room for more layer one investments, Ryan. We got lots of that. Lots of room for that.
00:49:18.180 - 00:49:25.634, Speaker A: At some point, it's got to become a bad investment, though, right? At some point. When does the window fully close on layer ones?
00:49:25.752 - 00:49:40.838, Speaker B: Well, okay, so privacy is hot right now because of the whole conversations of sanctions and nation states and crypto. And so privacy tools and privacy tooling is in vogue at the moment. So I think that kind of explains that a little bit.
00:49:40.924 - 00:49:57.206, Speaker A: I just always ask the question. You'd have to have a really good reason to build a layer one when you could also just build a layer two from an economics perspective. And sometimes I wonder if the reason to build a layer one is just investors will fund your project for a lot of money and you can sell tokens.
00:49:57.318 - 00:50:00.380, Speaker B: That's been the status quo for, like, almost five years now.
00:50:01.870 - 00:50:08.590, Speaker A: Let's talk about this paradigm. Just invested $8.75 million in ribbon finance. What's this about?
00:50:08.660 - 00:50:38.370, Speaker B: So in the tradfi world, we have these things called structured products, which is basically like, I think an analogy is like kind of like a yearns custom strategies. Like, you can load up yield strategies. So it's like a yield strategy defi product. We have these things in tradfi, but basically anything you can do in tradfi, you can do even better in Defi. So that's what ribbon is. Their project's declared mission is to create sustainable alpha for everyone. Financial products are bundled per specific investment strategies.
00:50:38.370 - 00:50:42.386, Speaker B: So they just raised $8.75 million from paradigm.
00:50:42.498 - 00:51:10.290, Speaker A: I think this is a cool d five protocol, and if people want to check it out, of course. Bankless wrote a tactic about this article, how to make money with ribbon finance. And William Peter describes it as a prepackaged and cross protocol DFI investment strategy. So if you want to learn how to use this thing, at the time we wrote it, APIs range from ten to 54% on this thing. So pretty good APIs. Go check out this article. We'll include a link in the show notes.
00:51:10.290 - 00:51:18.494, Speaker A: Dahlio Bridgewater investing in a crypto fund. Finally, Dalio is warming up a little bit to crypto.
00:51:18.542 - 00:51:19.394, Speaker B: Finally. Yeah.
00:51:19.512 - 00:51:20.840, Speaker A: What do you think about this?
00:51:21.850 - 00:51:38.074, Speaker B: It's so frustrating. I know you and I are both reading his book. I don't know if you've finished his book or not, Ryan, but it's impossible to read his book, which is titled like how principle. Principle for living in a changing world order. And the changing world order is something we talk on bankless about all the time.
00:51:38.192 - 00:51:39.114, Speaker A: He nails it.
00:51:39.232 - 00:52:40.094, Speaker B: The decline of the dollar, the decline of institutions. This is why we talk about how it's risky to not go into crypto, while Crypto is also risky itself. Things are risky and things are volatile and things are chaotic when we have changing world orders. And Ray Dalio is so tapped into this, what he's missing, and he talks about how the phoenix that rises from the ashes of, like, one broken world order moves into a new world order, and then the Phoenix rise from the ashes and we do it all over again. He talks about these new nations always work well when they have their own internal financial markets, their own internal equities markets, their own places of trade. And it's so frustrating when I'm hearing this and I'm like, oh, okay, so Ethereum, it's got its own uniswap, it's got its own DYDX, it's got its own money markets with compound and Aave. It's got all of the financial institutions that Ray Dalio says is critical for the arising of the new neo nation, the next step in the world.
00:52:40.094 - 00:52:45.950, Speaker B: And I'm like, ray, it's right in front of you. It's right in front of you. It's Ethereum, it's defi, it's crypto.
00:52:46.110 - 00:52:54.734, Speaker A: He literally goes. He's like, here's the history of Denmark, and Amsterdam is the first exchange. And then we got London, right? And that was another financial.
00:52:54.782 - 00:52:58.194, Speaker B: We invented the LLC. We have Daos now.
00:52:58.312 - 00:53:09.254, Speaker A: Exactly. And then it's New York. And then he's like, well, what's going to be next? The question is, what's the next nation state on the rise? Is it going to be China? Maybe? It's like Beijing is the next. I'm like, what about Ethereum?
00:53:09.302 - 00:53:10.358, Speaker B: It's Ethereum.
00:53:10.534 - 00:53:11.190, Speaker A: Ethereum.
00:53:11.270 - 00:53:14.090, Speaker B: It perfectly fits into the trajectory.
00:53:14.510 - 00:54:25.854, Speaker A: It really does. And I just don't think that's on his radar. The rise of what we would call this new institution, the digital nation, these new protocols, I think even if you believe that nation states will get a whole nother big cycle, like financial cycle, and be kind of the empire, then even in the most, I guess, bearish case for the bankless concept of a digital nation, crypto is still the new perfect bridge between the old paradigm and the new paradigm. So you at least want to be in crypto because you don't know what the future big new world order is going to be, and so you want to be in crypto in order to get across that bridge, because crypto is going to be essential for getting across the bridge and establishing a new world order. So we tend to think that, hey, the new world order will probably be based on crypto because it's the only credibly neutral institution to actually do the job in the digital era. Right. It's going to just slurp in all of the value, just like the Internet has slurped in all of our communication content.
00:54:25.854 - 00:54:40.454, Speaker A: But even if you don't believe that that's true, crypto is going to play a massive role as the bridge between old paradigm and new paradigm. Anyway, all that to say, ray's getting it, though. He's investing in crypto funds, so it's starting to happen.
00:54:40.572 - 00:54:52.730, Speaker B: There's a reason why we call it the bankless nation, and it's not just because it's a good name. It is a direct reference to exactly what Ray Dalio is talking about. We're building new nations in the sky, and they shall be bankless.
00:54:53.070 - 00:55:10.366, Speaker A: There you go, guys. If you want to get into the new nation, you got to get a job in crypto. That's what it takes. We got some fantastic jobs. We tell you every week to get a job in crypto. I think we just got a massive dump of new job postings on the bankless job boards. Check that out.
00:55:10.388 - 00:55:10.906, Speaker B: Ready to dance?
00:55:10.938 - 00:55:23.246, Speaker A: You ready to dance? Because I'm ready to read. All right, let's go. Yeah, I will. Blockchain engineer Dow Masari is hiring. That what a fantastic role. Software engineer for market data. Also at Masari.
00:55:23.246 - 00:55:35.266, Speaker A: Go check those roles out. Operations manager, Syndica. Senior product designer. Smart Defi, a senior go rust engineer at Syndica. A senior full stack engineer at Syndica. A senior software engineer. Airdrop Labs.
00:55:35.266 - 00:55:56.142, Speaker A: A product manager for crypto at Nori. A bankless. Web developer at bankless. An editor at bankless, as well a senior product engineer at the bankless academy. A senior product engineer at super rare. Got a bunch more positions open for Masari, you should take a look at gauntlet as well. David's done dancing, and I gotta take a sip of water because I've been reading a little bit.
00:55:56.276 - 00:56:17.506, Speaker B: I would like to emphasize the bankless web developer would be in charge of building out one of the coolest websites of all time. I shouldn't even call it a website. We need a better name for it. But if you want some alpha, you got to apply to be the bankless web dev. If you are a talented web dev who wants to lead bankless into the world of web3 and into the frontier, pay attention to that one.
00:56:17.608 - 00:56:28.758, Speaker A: Yeah. Why would you not get a job in crypto? Companies are still hiring like crazy. This is not like the last bear market. This is a ton of hiring going on. All right, man, well, let's get to news. Okay.
00:56:28.844 - 00:56:29.094, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:29.132 - 00:56:32.806, Speaker A: And let's get to Vitalik on the COVID of Time magazine. Look at this picture.
00:56:32.838 - 00:56:34.490, Speaker B: Looking like an absolute king.
00:56:35.230 - 00:56:37.094, Speaker A: Well, he's not a king. He's the prince of Crypto.
00:56:37.142 - 00:56:59.490, Speaker B: Excuse me. Excuse me. It's on the COVID of Time magazine. It says, the prince of Crypto has concerns on Vitalik's shirt. And then it says, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin fights to fix the world he created. And this isn't anything new. Vitalik in 2017 made similar sentiments on Twitter, saying, like, yo, if this whole industry just turns into, like, pump and dump ico ponzi schemes, like, I'm out of here.
00:56:59.490 - 00:57:25.900, Speaker B: And then the bear market happened, so he stayed. But now, once again, it's always a hotline. Vitalik's a very pragmatic, modest person. When he sees all the scams in crypto, he's like, yes, those are bad. I don't want Ethereum necessarily to be used for these things, but I understand the value of open, permissionless systems. But it's a really hot line for something like Tang magazine to be like, yo, the guy that invented crypto says it's bad.
00:57:27.070 - 00:58:00.594, Speaker A: You know what? That's a catchy look. We do it to you. We call it legit bait, okay? Which is like, you say something, but it has to have some legitimacy. And in the article, which was absolutely fantastic, I think everyone, if you got, like, 15 minutes, go read this article. Vitalik does put in place some of his criticisms about the current state of crypto, and many of these criticisms are always, well, recent, but they're also very valid. But, yeah, they put him on the type. But not everyone liked this image of Vitalik David.
00:58:00.594 - 00:58:10.410, Speaker A: So when this got out, of course, everyone in crypto was very excited to see. And like, if you've met Vitalik, I mean, this is pretty much what he dresses like and what he looks like.
00:58:10.480 - 00:58:13.514, Speaker B: This is tame Vitalik, but there's no.
00:58:13.552 - 00:58:20.202, Speaker A: Pretense in the guy. You're never going to catch him in a suit and tie and fully buttoned up.
00:58:20.336 - 00:58:22.590, Speaker B: Usually it's in a unicorn t shirt.
00:58:23.810 - 00:58:28.894, Speaker A: But I mean, some of the responses, some of the quote tweets on this.
00:58:29.012 - 00:58:47.830, Speaker B: Were absolutely like, yeah, pretty terrible because crypto has a bad. So here's a quote tweet from the time article. This guy looks like the clone of Tom Brady. Can you go back to the other one? This guy looks like the clone of Tom Brady keeps locked in his basement to periodically feed on to stay youthful.
00:58:48.330 - 00:58:49.400, Speaker A: My God.
00:58:50.570 - 00:59:10.474, Speaker B: There's a few others. This is if Tom Brady was on dog food. How is it possible to be this rich and still be ugly? Oh, my God. Get a hair transplant or a botox or a new wardrobe, something. Okay, this one, I want to dwell on this one. This is why I love italic, because he doesn't care about his image. He is a person.
00:59:10.474 - 00:59:30.642, Speaker B: He is him. And he shows up in ruffled hair that he didn't comb, and it's in a unicorn t shirt because he has no ego. And who do you want most to be the founder of your crypto project? To have someone with zero ego. We are missing l one founders with zero ego in this world.
00:59:30.696 - 00:59:34.766, Speaker A: In my opinion, there's not very many. There was satoshi. I think there's Vitalik.
00:59:34.798 - 00:59:36.258, Speaker B: And I don't know, I don't know.
00:59:36.344 - 00:59:38.402, Speaker A: There's another I can think of. Maybe Zuko.
00:59:38.466 - 00:59:40.726, Speaker B: Zuko is a pretty cool guy. Yeah.
00:59:40.828 - 01:00:02.934, Speaker A: A fantastic person as well. My wife actually sent me this one. It was like, oh, my God, everyone's being mean to Vitalik on the like, I could do something, but I did. I tweeted out. I was like, most of the comments here suck, and this is so true. Vitalik is one of the best human beings I know. He'll be remembered as a historical figure of monumental importance.
01:00:02.934 - 01:00:08.958, Speaker A: Petty people can't get past how he looks in this image. We don't deserve him. I 100% stand by that.
01:00:09.044 - 01:00:10.062, Speaker B: That's the right take.
01:00:10.196 - 01:00:40.426, Speaker A: One of the best humans I know. Not only that, I think Vitalik is going to be remembered across history like, he is going to be one of the most important people, I think of this century for his work in ethereum, but the other things he's going to do in life as well. And it's super petty that people just take this picture and use it to insult him. Pretty annoying, actually, to me, but we got a funny exchange out of it.
01:00:40.448 - 01:01:09.106, Speaker B: David, I'm reminded of the layer zero I did with Santi Siri from Argentina, and he called Vitalik while he walked around Argentina in his sandals, he called Vitalik like this monk figure. I think that's a very apt description of no like is not interested in material things, is mostly interested in making good things happen for the world. Very polite, very respectful, very grounded, very grounded individual.
01:01:09.288 - 01:01:29.320, Speaker A: Yeah, I know both of us have had the opportunity to interact with him on a number of occasions, and he's just a fantastic human being and represents the best of us and I think the best of this industry as well. But at least we got some fun out of this as well because there was some back and forth on the Tom Brady. Why don't you tell us what happened here?
01:01:30.490 - 01:01:55.946, Speaker B: Vitalik can take a joke. He can take a joke very, very well. He's been used to getting just berated in all different capacities ever since he's been in crypto. So he retweets all of these terrible comments on him on Twitter, and he goes, the quote, tweets on the new time article about me are truly amazing. These are barely even cherry picked. It's pretty much one piece of awesome after another. Highly recommend scrolling.
01:01:55.946 - 01:02:16.022, Speaker B: And then he follows up his own tweet saying, I don't even know who Tom Brady is. Had to ask people around me. My best guess is that he is the actor from. He, quote tweets like, four tweets, like, calling him Tom Brady. He's like anyone else. Looks like Vitalik. Looks like Tom Brady on meth, bro.
01:02:16.022 - 01:02:26.540, Speaker B: Looks like a dystopian Tom Brady. Tom Brady was a reverse Captain America super soldier serum. The prince of crypto kind of looks like Tom Brady. After two years of retirement and no weightlifting. No.
01:02:26.990 - 01:02:29.020, Speaker A: Okay. And then what happens?
01:02:29.950 - 01:02:53.454, Speaker B: Tom Brady retweets Vitalik's tweet saying, I don't know who Tom Brady is. And Tom Brady says, what's up, vitalik? You may not know me, but just wanted to say I'm a big fan of yours. Thank you for everything you've built in the world of crypto. Otherwise autograph wouldn't have been possible. His NFT platform. Hope I get to meet you someday. You're the goat, which is a tip of the hat to how everyone calls Tom Brady the Goat.
01:02:53.454 - 01:03:06.902, Speaker B: He's like one of the most Super Bowls by all time ever. So the goat of Super bowl of football is calling Vitalik Buterin the Goat. Also a slight shill of his autograph platform.
01:03:07.036 - 01:03:19.930, Speaker A: Yeah, but also real recognized, like one goat seeing another. It's really cool to see, and I love that the story came together that way. Anything else on this, David?
01:03:20.350 - 01:03:34.266, Speaker B: No, it was a good story. It was a good story. The last time we saw Vitalik engage with celebrities, it turned into a really funny video of Mila Kunis and Asin Kutcher and Vitalik in the living room. So I'm hopeful something like this happens with Tom Brady.
01:03:34.378 - 01:04:14.702, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. All right, man, let's move on to some other Ethereum stuff. While we're talking about Ethereum, and we got to just mentioned EIP 4844, I'm going to say that again because this is the first time we've talked about this Ethereum improvement proposal. That's what an EIP is on bankless EIP 4844. Remember the name, remember that number, okay? Because it is like 15, five, nine in that it is going to be of that level of significance, I think in the future. We don't talk about eips very often, but this thing is worth talking about now. We're not going to go in detail.
01:04:14.702 - 01:04:33.090, Speaker A: It's probably a bunch of future bankless articles and probably some shows that we'll put together for you in the future. And there's kind of no rush because it's still in the early stages of development. So we got a long time on this one. But David, could you sum up what EIP 4844 is going to do for us?
01:04:33.160 - 01:05:27.346, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a new type of data sharding structure which takes a leaf out of distributed systems like BitTorrent. It kind of copies a BitTorrent model, so on the website it'll read EIP 4844 introduces a new kind of transaction type to Ethereum, which accepts blobs of data to be persisted in the beacon node for a short period of time. These changes are forward compatible, not required for EVM execution, and small enough to keep disk use manageable. So it's basically allowing Ethereum's data layer to be a little bit more expressive and using distributed systems again like BitTorrent. We will get better and better at explaining these things as we come to understand them more. But the TLDR is that this is from Proto Lambda. Out of the optimism team, data blobs are the first milestone towards full Ethereum charting, enabling roll ups like optimism to grow 100 times in capacity.
01:05:27.346 - 01:05:46.874, Speaker B: That's already after roll ups like optimism have ten x in capacity coming from their own innovations. And so we were just previewing this very, very significant subject for something that's going to have a huge scalability increase, both to the Ethereum L one, and of course orders of magnitude more scalability to the Ethereum layer two s, and.
01:05:46.912 - 01:06:36.246, Speaker A: In particular this is going to scale out. Remember we've talked about on our modular blockchain show the three kind of layers of the stack here, the consensus layer, the data layer and the execution layer, and the Ethereum scalability roadmap. The execution layers is all roll ups, basically, and the consensus layer is the beacon chain. Of course, this is bringing massive scalability to the data layer, which roll ups, of course, need in order to scale. So what we get when this thing is deployed, and it's a much more simplified version than the full data sharding spec. So the hope is it can be deployed a little bit faster than the full data sharding spec, is roll up fees, as David said, up to 100 times faster. Like 100 times more space on roll ups.
01:06:36.246 - 01:07:11.090, Speaker A: So look at what you pay on arbitrum or optimism or any of the ZK roll ups you use, right? And it's going to be 99% less in terms of costs. So if you're paying like, you're going to be paying like fractions of a cent in the future for a transaction. So lots of cool stuff to unpack there. And we will unpack it in the future, just not on this particular episode. While we're talking about that, though, David, should we talk a little bit about the merge? Because some people brought to our attention.
01:07:11.170 - 01:07:14.230, Speaker B: That we should emphasize something. Yes.
01:07:14.300 - 01:07:16.306, Speaker A: Okay, what should we emphasize?
01:07:16.498 - 01:07:45.586, Speaker B: Last week we went through the superfizz's analysis on five different points that indicate that the merge is coming in June. And then we talked about how bullish the merge is and emphasize June, emphasize June, emphasize June. June is possible, but it's not fact, it's not canon. So the merge is coming perhaps sometime in Q three, sometime between June and August. But it could also come in 2024. It could come in 2025. It could come in 2030.
01:07:45.586 - 01:08:16.986, Speaker B: It'll be ready when it's ready. Bankless is not the oracle for when the merge comes. That's what the developers jobs for. So apologies if any of the ethereum developers felt any pressure by the narratives that bankless likes to beat the drum for if it came in June, that would be fantastic. People are hypothesizing that it'll be sometime between June and August, but June is not actually scheduled that's just estimation. So I just want to say that.
01:08:17.088 - 01:08:33.562, Speaker A: And I do think that people got a little bit skittish after there was a bug in the kiln test net, right. And they were just like, wow. Given that, know, the June date might not happen. Right. And so that's some of the feedback. Anyway, there's still a chance it happens in June.
01:08:33.626 - 01:08:34.606, Speaker B: Still a chance, of course.
01:08:34.708 - 01:08:42.546, Speaker A: But it could also be July. It could also be August. It could also be later. It's ready when it's ready. As David said, the best time for.
01:08:42.568 - 01:08:44.466, Speaker B: The merge is when it's time for.
01:08:44.488 - 01:08:47.006, Speaker A: The merge, which is this summer.
01:08:47.038 - 01:08:48.694, Speaker B: I don't even know if that makes sense.
01:08:48.892 - 01:09:19.130, Speaker A: I don't know either. But moving on, this summer, let's talk about NFT stuff. And first we got to talk about a pretty massive phishing scam, not because it's the biggest in dollar amounts, but because it seemed like it was targeted and very sophisticated. We've had Arthur Zero X on the show before. He is the founder of Defiance Capital, which is a d five firm. He just got $1.7 million worth of NFts yanked from his Ethereum wallet.
01:09:19.130 - 01:09:21.678, Speaker A: David, what happened here? And how did it happen?
01:09:21.764 - 01:10:19.330, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think somebody spun up like a shared Google Doc and sent it to his email. And it kind of looks like somebody was sharing a Google Doc, but when he opened it, that did things. And I'm noticing that that doc is a DocX file ducx, and that is the same file type that Hugh Karp had his nexus mutual tokens stolen from. And so be wary about people sending you files, basically, which makes it really hard because maybe we could talk to somebody technical about this. I don't know if this functionality is possible inside of a PDF, but a doc X File can have embedded data in it that can swap out your metamask to a clone of a metamask that looks like metamask, that does things that it shouldn't do. And so even people as sophisticated as Arthur Zero X got phished. And so it can happen to you, too.
01:10:19.330 - 01:10:38.294, Speaker B: If you want to have maximum security about how to not have this happen to you, the best way to do this is to work on one computer and sign transactions on a different computer and not to open up files on that second computer and keep that other computer relatively clean. And that's how you can protect yourself from this.
01:10:38.492 - 01:11:42.134, Speaker A: I think that is especially true. The other thing you should do is go read this article that William Peacer put together on Metaversal about this hack and how it happened and how you can protect yourself, because I think you were talking about the Hugh Carr pack, who's a Defi founder. The crazy thing about this is with Arthur as well, is he's likely stalked, likely targeted. Right. So if you have kind of a public reputation in Defi, I think you should be especially cautious of this type of hack, because not only was he targeted, he was likely targeted by a known group in crypto, the blue Norov group, it's called. And there's some speculation that this might be a group out of North Korea that's actually assembled to go attack some of these individuals in crypto and kind of, like, hunt them down, learn their patterns, and actually see where their vulnerabilities were. Because this email that got sent to Arthur was actually somebody from one of his portfolio accounts whom he trusted.
01:11:42.134 - 01:12:15.158, Speaker A: So they had inside knowledge of who Arthur might trust and the type of link he might click. Anyway, William concludes this article with a few other resources for you on self custody, operational security, tips on how to guard yourself, how to store bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. So go refresh yourself on that, especially if you're one of these public, high profile people who might be susceptible to a group like this.
01:12:15.244 - 01:12:40.574, Speaker B: Yeah. The same strategy was used with Hugh Karp where he clicked a document that just made sense for him to receive. It came out of the Nexus community call. And so somebody was like, okay, Hugh Karp, here's this document. It's part of the Nexus community call information that we were talking about. So somebody was using relevant information to Hugh Karp so that when he received this file, he's like, oh, this totally makes sense that I'm receiving this file. I will totally click on this.
01:12:40.692 - 01:12:50.054, Speaker A: Yes. This is why we also talk about cold storage so often. And the ledger keys that didn't protect Hugh Carp.
01:12:50.122 - 01:12:51.886, Speaker B: Hugh Carp got rugged from his ledger.
01:12:51.998 - 01:13:10.246, Speaker A: You're right. It can help with some things, but it doesn't help with this kind of phishing attack. The best thing you can do is just make sure you know exactly what you're signing. And sometimes that's tricky, too. But be vigilant. Plus, up your opsec if you can. Let's keep moving, Hollywood in our Hollywood section.
01:13:10.246 - 01:13:14.570, Speaker A: So Disney just released something called Pixar pals. What are these?
01:13:14.720 - 01:13:27.098, Speaker B: These are the most simple types of nfts you'll ever see. They are NFts of Pixar characters like Woody from Toy Story, buz from Toy Story. They are pictures of characters. You can buy them. The NFTs coming out of Disney.
01:13:27.274 - 01:13:37.986, Speaker A: Disney's getting in on NFT. So is the DC universe. Right? The creators of Batman, of course, Marvel's rival. So what are they doing in the NFT space?
01:13:38.168 - 01:13:45.166, Speaker B: Digital trading cards of their characters from the Marvel universe. You can buy them as nfts. Pretty simple. Open and shut.
01:13:45.358 - 01:13:59.602, Speaker A: They're at the very simple stages of nfts, right? Yeah. Got to imagine these are just, like, tests and prototypes, and it's going to get more complicated from here. Let's talk about the institutions a little bit, David. So check this out, man. This is Goldman Sachs.
01:13:59.666 - 01:14:02.210, Speaker B: Goldman Sachs. Shall I read it?
01:14:02.300 - 01:14:03.242, Speaker A: Say yeah, read it.
01:14:03.296 - 01:14:20.154, Speaker B: Big word. Digitalization, front and center with the subtitle from cryptocurrencies to the Metaverse. Explore the trends that are reshaping economies. That's it. Just the word. Digitalization. Cryptocurrencies, and metaverse now on the front page of Goldman Sachs.
01:14:20.282 - 01:14:33.506, Speaker A: So crypto making the front page of Goldman Sachs, as if it's like a pillar of their strategy moving forward. But are they going to get it right? This is Ben's take. He's actually from the bankless team. Why don't you talk about this?
01:14:33.608 - 01:14:58.626, Speaker B: Yeah. Ben Bankless, analyst, head of the GMI index, one of the methodologists says, per command f where you find something. This Goldman Sachs report on the metaverse and web3 does not include a single mention of either blockchain or ethereum. This is a perfect example of why Defi natives are going to eat their damn lunch. Well said, ben. That's what we love to hear. That's the right take, Chad.
01:14:58.626 - 01:15:10.266, Speaker B: Ben's best. Ben, like, if you don't know what's up, we're just going to learn how to eat you. This is the rise of the individual against the institution. If you don't know what Defi is and you're not reporting on it, we're just going to eat your lunch.
01:15:10.378 - 01:15:42.300, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we got, like, at least five years of knowledge on these guys, and they're just kind of getting into the space, and I bet they're going to not understand it for a while, but they could if they start consuming the right content and actually using these protocols and getting in the space. But I think that's kind of few. That's not the many who are going to go on that path. They just also, as well, announced the first OTC crypto trade. Of course, we talked about their partnership with Galaxy Digital last week. Apparently that partnership went forward and they're actually spending money on crypto right now.
01:15:42.990 - 01:15:43.786, Speaker B: That's that?
01:15:43.888 - 01:15:47.146, Speaker A: Let's talk about our friend Elizabeth Warren. What's she up to these days?
01:15:47.328 - 01:16:58.078, Speaker B: Being cringe? She introduced a new compliance bill for crypto on the wake of the whole sanctions conversation with Russia. And so it's using the russian narrative of we need to regulate crypto, because you can use crypto to get around sanctions, even though there is absolutely no evidence that's actually happening. But in addition to that, the bill goes beyond russian sanctions. An additional provision in the bill would authorize Finsen, the financial Crimes Enforcement Network, to force users to report transactions larger than $10,000 if they send them outside of the United States. So if you're a crypto person, you send $10,000 to somebody else that is outside of the United States, you have to report it. But that also begs the question, in what jurisdiction is a smart contract? If it exists on, like, does that smart contract? Is that outside of the United States? Like, it's on the Internet? Is the Internet outside of the United States? Not only that, but the bill also tries to attempt to regulate publishing code, which is a legal battle that we have already fought before. There's this line, that code is speech that came out of the cipher punks.
01:16:58.078 - 01:17:12.566, Speaker B: So basically, you are not allowed to put strings of characters together in a way that creates code and then publish that to ethereum if this bill goes through without it being regulated. So, Elizabeth, rein it in. Rein it in.
01:17:12.588 - 01:17:46.610, Speaker A: Yeah, we're disappointed. David and I are disappointed and continually disappointed. There's absolutely no reason for this. Like, number one, there's no evidence of russian oligarchs actually using crypto to launder money or evade sanctions or anything like that. But even if that was the case, what they actually want to do is basically put you in a database. They want all of your crypto wallets in a database so they have an id and they can match your ETh address, your crypto wallet address, to your identity. Right.
01:17:46.610 - 01:18:26.334, Speaker A: And that's what would happen if it was any ten K transaction that I sent from one place to another. I would have to actually make sure the government ids my wallet. It's absolutely crazy. Absolutely insane. This is, I guess, you know, the surveillance state trying to reach its tentacles into crypto. What I was super disappointed with is actually one of my senators in Virginia, Mark Warner, co signed this as well. So I sent some tweets his way that said, basically, this kind of financial surveillance is garbage and is what's going to make the next generation leave the US that I was sad to see him to support this.
01:18:26.334 - 01:18:43.842, Speaker A: So, as another reminder, tweet at your congress representatives, tweet at your senators, tweet at the people who are behind this bill, and get your opinion out there, because this sort of thing can't be pushed forward. It's unlikely that this will go through, is what I would say.
01:18:43.896 - 01:18:46.180, Speaker B: But the fact that they're even trying.
01:18:46.490 - 01:19:08.282, Speaker A: Yes, the fact that they're trying, and they're couching this in language as if this is being tough on Russia, when really it's just being tough on annoying citizens. No, it's an authoritarian anti speech provision that they're trying to push down our throat, using Russia as a justification for that and as a reason for doing that.
01:19:08.336 - 01:20:03.174, Speaker B: And if you want to get a taste on the. What's the right descriptor, the dishonest intentions of Elizabeth Warren, there's a clip of her asking somebody who's an expert in crypto about how somebody can use cross chain bridges to launder billions and dollars of russian oligarch money. And the guy attempts to answer the questions like, well, Elizabeth, Senator Warren, there's not enough liquidity in. She actually referenced the wormhole bridge between Salana and Ethereum. There's not enough liquidity to support $10 billion going from one chain to another. And she goes, I don't care about the liquidity. Can you obfuscate funds by going from one chain to another? Can you obfuscate funds by breaking it up into small little wallets and using tumblers and mixers to obfuscate transactions? And the man attempts to answer is like, Senator Warren, like, it's too much money.
01:20:03.174 - 01:20:10.080, Speaker B: The liquidity isn't there. And she goes, I don't care, but stop asking about the liquidity. Can you do this? And she just refused to listen to the.
01:20:10.930 - 01:20:34.194, Speaker A: They just, okay, so what I feel like is nation states and people like, politicians like Elizabeth Warren, they feel like, because everything's digital, that they should have a license to see it all. This is like, imagine if she put forward a bill that said, basically, if you keep any valuables, I need to know the physical locations of all your vaults. You have gold bars in your home. You have jewelry like you have any gold.
01:20:34.242 - 01:20:35.702, Speaker B: Which room? Which room is it in?
01:20:35.756 - 01:21:06.258, Speaker A: Which room in your house? The actual location. We need an identification system for your physical vaults. Right. If she proposed something like that, that's essentially what she's proposing here. But because it's digital, they think they have a right to inspect all of this and to have everything registered with the state. And it's absolutely ludicrous to me. And if this kind of thing goes forward in the US, crypto will be fine over the long run, but the US will get left behind.
01:21:06.344 - 01:21:06.738, Speaker B: Right?
01:21:06.824 - 01:21:09.140, Speaker A: And that's my big concern here.
01:21:10.070 - 01:21:20.790, Speaker B: It's like that Gif of the sword coming down and hitting the thing and a sword just shatters. That's what's going to happen if you keep on trying to swing the sword at crypto.
01:21:21.130 - 01:21:33.850, Speaker A: Absolutely. Well, let's keep moving. So FIFA World Cup. Crypto.com is a sponsor of this. It's like crypto is taking all the sports it can. Yeah, what's going on?
01:21:33.920 - 01:21:41.830, Speaker B: No, that's about it. Yeah. Crypto.com, in addition to crypto.com arena, is now a FIFA World cup sponsor for an undisclosed sum.
01:21:41.990 - 01:21:49.934, Speaker A: Wow, crypto's getting everywhere, guys. We'll be right back with the takes of the week. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:21:50.052 - 01:22:28.166, Speaker B: Bankless is proud to be sponsored by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. The Uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants. Do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the Uniswap ecosystem? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a unique grant@uniswapgrants.org
01:22:28.166 - 01:22:55.790, Speaker B: and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go. Thank you, Uniswap, for sponsoring bankless. The layer two era is upon us. Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day, and we need l two bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life. Across is the fastest and cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge. With across. You don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets back to the layer one assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously.
01:22:55.790 - 01:24:01.674, Speaker B: Across's bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer two back to Ethereum, across is critical. Ecosystem infrastructure and ownership is being handed over to the community. You can be a part of this story of across by joining the discord and becoming a cofounder and helping to design the fair, fair launch of across. If you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely, go to across to bridge your assets between ETH optimism, arbitrum or Boba networks. So you've got some money, but how are you going to use it? You want to spend money, but what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind? With inquiring minds, a new world awaits. Set yourself free with completely flexible self repaying loan technology supported on desktop and mobile. Seize the power of alchemyx, allowing you to spend and save at the same time.
01:24:01.674 - 01:24:16.190, Speaker B: Leverage your wealth without risk of liquidation. Take out a loan that repays itself by using yield from your deposit to pay off your balance. Your only debt is time. What was once inconceivable is now within your grasp.
01:24:23.890 - 01:24:27.922, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back with two David Hoffman takes in a row back to back.
01:24:27.976 - 01:24:28.562, Speaker B: My favorite time.
01:24:28.616 - 01:24:45.686, Speaker A: Great one. All right, I'll read this out. This cultural difference between Vitalik and the other co founders is such a crucial part of this industry. And you were talking about a cultural difference. This is a quote from Laura Shin's book Cryptopians. Should I read this last paragraph? Is this where the good part.
01:24:45.788 - 01:24:47.698, Speaker B: Yeah, it's that last paragraph for sure.
01:24:47.804 - 01:25:25.380, Speaker A: Okay. This is from the book cryptopians. As Ethereum's promise became apparent, people jockeyed for positions. Charles is Charles Hoskinson now Cardano, who had lobbied to be CEO. Do people know that he lobbied to be CEO in early Ethereum? Anyway, he casually asked Gavin over a game of chess to be his chief technology officer. CTo Gavin, who on Wednesday sent the first ether transaction from his laptop to Charles, asked Vitalik if that was cool. Vitalik, being less interested in a title or in ordering people around than in conducting research or learning Chinese, said sure and gave himself the title c three po.
01:25:25.380 - 01:25:31.960, Speaker A: We got a CTO, we got a CEO, and he wants to be c three po.
01:25:33.210 - 01:25:58.778, Speaker B: This is going back to the whole monk perception of Vitalik. The guy does not care about status. The guy does not care about material things. When everyone else is jockeying for position, Vitalik is just letting it go in the same way Satoshi let bitcoin go and go off into the world. Vitalik is like, oh, you're going to be CEO. Fine, I'll be c three po. And this is the culture that's been baked into Ethereum.
01:25:58.778 - 01:26:20.294, Speaker B: Not completely, but more than any other smart contract chain, that is really what makes me feel good about being part of Ethereum. This is the culture that I align with. Because if we're going to make a new financial world order, if we're going to make a new money for the whole entire globe, we can't have people like Charles Hoskinson, who's jockeying to be a CEO of the new monetary world order.
01:26:20.412 - 01:26:38.522, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. You know what? So people say Vitalik has too much power in Ethereum. So first of all, I disagree. But I do agree that Vitalik does have some power in Ethereum. But there's a difference, because the type of power Vitalik has isn't hard power. It's not top down authority power. It is soft power.
01:26:38.522 - 01:27:22.950, Speaker A: And the fantastic thing about soft power is soft power is it's like, it's a decentralized form of power, because it's only power if people actually follow him and actually believe what he's saying. It's not something that he can enforce on others. They have to consent. Yeah. They have to opt in to that, sort of like, yeah, and it's the kind of power a monk would have, or like a religious leader, or like the Dalai Lama or something like that. And I'm not trying to exalt him into like a religious leader, but there's an element of that type of leadership, of soft power that I think Vitalik wields very well. And that's the sort of leadership you need in a decentralized system, I've come to realize.
01:27:23.030 - 01:27:46.946, Speaker B: And it's just this charm in the, oh, you'll be CEO, I'll be c three po. It's that the charm of that is just what gets people to believe in this man. And not only that, but even after Vitalik was a billionaire, based on his ETH holdings, he was still staying in hostels, trying to spend the minimum amount of money just because that's what is down a hill for him. That's what's natural to him.
01:27:47.128 - 01:27:52.382, Speaker A: Yeah. Just a good person all around the second David Hoffman.
01:27:52.446 - 01:28:24.174, Speaker B: Second David Hoffman. Yeah. This is about music NFTs. And I was just kind of like thinking about, like, why do JPeg NFTs? Why are they so much more viral than music NFTs? And what is a music NFT anyways? So basically, the difference in my mind between JPEG NFTs and MP3 NFTs is that you can fully experience a JPeg basically instantaneously, because it's an image, you can receive it all at once. And music NFts take time to experience. Like, if we're talking about a song that's like three plus minutes. So, like, jpegs can be instantly viral, right? MP3 s take too much time.
01:28:24.174 - 01:28:45.406, Speaker B: And I follow that up with the next tweet, Ryan, where you can apply the same thought to profile picture nfts. Some NFT art is more viral than others. Like cryptopunks. Extremely obvious aesthetic. Same thing with board apes. Also why I'm bullish on mfers, right? Like, it's just so obvious what their vibe is. It's easy for these NFTs to live rent free in your brain.
01:28:45.406 - 01:29:01.190, Speaker B: Kind of like a meme, right? These are memes. It's harder. Songs definitely go viral, but pictures go viral on average way more than songs do, just because of how laborious it is to consume a whole entire song versus how laborious it is to just view an image.
01:29:01.350 - 01:29:25.106, Speaker A: Do you also think that there's an element of there was an existing hole for PFPs to fill in a way there's not for MP3 s? And here's what I mean. In all of my social media profiles, there's no place where I can set my profile song, right. That was like, maybe in the Myspace days people did that and people would.
01:29:25.208 - 01:29:26.786, Speaker B: Put it on mew anyways, right?
01:29:26.808 - 01:29:55.018, Speaker A: And people hate that, right? But for PFPS profile picks, I have so many places where I can just display my image. There's so much surface area in web two, and I wonder if that's an insight, too. It's like, in order to do really well, at least in this phase of the NFT game, the thing that will make the NFT category popular is does it have surface area in web two? Does it have like a ready made hole it could just plop in and fill?
01:29:55.104 - 01:29:55.354, Speaker B: Right.
01:29:55.392 - 01:29:56.714, Speaker A: I think that might be part of it, too.
01:29:56.752 - 01:30:00.874, Speaker B: And this is not to say that music NFTs aren't a thing. They are absolutely a thing.
01:30:00.992 - 01:30:01.866, Speaker A: This will be a different thing.
01:30:01.888 - 01:30:11.038, Speaker B: It'll be a different thing. It'll fill a different niche than the profile picture. NFt music NFTs aren't going to go viral in the same way that JPEG NFTs will.
01:30:11.124 - 01:30:36.838, Speaker A: Yeah, but we've got it all figured out, guys. That's how it's going to happen. This is a good take. I hear a lot of people saying this, that, hey, you guys talk about Etha's ultrasound money and deflationary. Like, isn't deflationary bad? Here's a hot take from Kevin Fitcher. I think deflationary systems are kind of whack, and it's frustrating that deflation is becoming core Ethereum meme. Thanks, bankless guys.
01:30:36.924 - 01:30:40.298, Speaker B: You can say that, but he's on the optimism team, by the way.
01:30:40.384 - 01:30:52.586, Speaker A: Okay. Deflation mainly really benefits the people who already have stacks to sit on. I thought this is a fantastic. And that's not the take. This is the take. This is the response from Polynaya. Do you want to read this, David? Yeah.
01:30:52.608 - 01:31:10.270, Speaker B: Poly Naya says ethereum is inflationary. Deflation is not a given. It is earned through surplus demand. The current gas price is 14 gwe. At this level, there is no deflation. If deflation is earned, it means that the network is undervalued. It's a self correcting system that minimizes deflation.
01:31:10.270 - 01:31:59.586, Speaker B: Okay, so kind of how like EIP 1559 throttles up or down based on demand. Polly and I is saying a similar dynamic is happening. There's a governor to the system, as in, if Ethereum has a ton of utility, if it's very, very useful, then the block space becomes very, very useful, and block space becomes very high in demand, and a lot of ether gets burned. If ethereum stops becoming useful, then there's less block space demand, therefore less ether is burned, and Ethereum starts to become inflationary, decreasing the value of ether, making it easier to transact on Ethereum. But as Ethereum becomes more useful, more ether is burned, making it deflationary. The whole it's earned concept, I think, is beautiful, and that's a fantastic take. Ethereum is only deflationary if it is earned by being useful to the world around it.
01:31:59.768 - 01:32:24.982, Speaker A: So the answer, if someone asks you, like, isn't a deflationary system like Ethereum bad? The answer is Ethereum is inflationary. If it's not selling any blocks, it's inflationary. But because it's in demand and selling so many blocks, it actually turns out that's deflationary. At some point in time, it's going to hit this nice equilibrium where those things kind of line up and then the whole network and block space and everything is kind of fairly valued.
01:32:25.126 - 01:32:27.098, Speaker B: The supply of ether is not going to zero.
01:32:27.264 - 01:32:41.290, Speaker A: It's not going to zero. Right. It's just going down a lot. Well, Justin Drake, we're talking ultrasound money case, like 100 million or so, right? Like under 100 million, right. That's probably the long term projection.
01:32:41.370 - 01:32:49.618, Speaker B: I bet the equilibrium of each supply is like somewhere between 85 and 100 million over the very long term. Like 50 plus years, I bet, too.
01:32:49.704 - 01:33:04.102, Speaker A: I bet. Let's talk about this. This is an Arthur Hayes piece, probably my favorite written piece of the week. Do you want to pull out some takes from this. The title of this is energy canceled. Yeah, energy canceled. What's Arthur Hayes'thesis here? What's he saying?
01:33:04.156 - 01:34:01.522, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is part of the whole macro conversation that's happening with oil and energy in Russia, but not just that and all over the world. And also the energy that is basically imbued into currencies and how currencies are basically a store of energy, basically. And when you expend that energy by inflating your currency, well, then you're deleting the last bits of energy that your currency has. Anyways, Arthur Hayes says the current petrodollar eurodollar monetary system ended last week, which is a huge statement with the confiscation of the russian central bank's fiat currency reserves by the US and the EU and the removal of certain russian banks from the swift network in a generation. Hence, when this hopefully sad episode of human history concludes, historians will point to 26 February 2022 as the date upon which the system ended and a new, currently unknown to us system sprouted. Also shout out to Ray Dalio and the changing world order. This is the same energy, same vibe.
01:34:01.522 - 01:34:03.394, Speaker B: Great take. What do you think about that, Ryan?
01:34:03.522 - 01:34:42.694, Speaker A: Yeah, he goes on. I mean, we've been saying that basically, too, is like this kind of could mark the end of us dollar monetary supremacy as being the reserve currency. But he says what's going to happen is energy will cost more, food will cost more as a result of the sanctions, and everyone's going to increase their military spending will further crowd out the civilian economy. And I said, because of the sanctions. I mean, why were the sanctions put in place? Because Putin decided to go invade Ukraine. Ultimately, that's the root cause. That's the reason why in this case.
01:34:42.694 - 01:35:29.382, Speaker A: But I do think it's going to cost the US. This is going to accelerate the paradigm shift that we're talking about earlier and that know talks about in his book to a new world order. Arthur's thesis in this article is basically, we'll have to go back to commodity money, like Bretton Woods v three, basically. So we had Bretton woods original v 219 46 us dollar would be the global reserve currency based, backed by gold. And then we had Bretton Woods v two, which is like when Nixon got us off the gold standard in the early 1970s, and that's been the regime right now. Breton Woods v three is something new, something different. Nation states will have to kind of go back to commodity backed money.
01:35:29.382 - 01:36:06.574, Speaker A: And Arthur's thesis is actually the nation state money just because of its history will probably be gold. So he actually ends this article being like, I'm bullish on gold, but I'm also super bullish and even more bullish on crypto. And for him, it's specifically bitcoin. But I would also lump ether in that category and say more bullish on ether than bitcoin. But those are words in Arthur's mouth anyway. Commodity money, like death of the US dollar as the reserve currency system, that future, I think, is accelerating. It still could take many years to play out.
01:36:06.574 - 01:36:48.480, Speaker A: It's not a transformation that's going to happen instantly, but this is another step in that direction and I think has accelerated things. Sanctions, the conflict in Ukraine and the global world response to that. I think one other piece that I maybe want to mention is he puts you in the shoes of China and he says, china is probably thinking deep and hard about the value of inside money claims in its FX reserves now that the G seven just seized Russia's. Right. So he's saying, are nation states going to store up their reserve currencies in the dollar with this kind of global distrust? Not a few.
01:36:48.850 - 01:36:55.134, Speaker B: Yeah. After watching the US just rugging in the entire country of Russia, China's like, well, I don't want to get rugged.
01:36:55.262 - 01:37:03.026, Speaker A: For sure, so it's going to be an interesting decade for sure. And I think this is just accelerating the regime change.
01:37:03.128 - 01:37:12.082, Speaker B: Yeah. Ryan, we have our closing statements at the end of the podcast. Crypto is risky. Defi is risky. Staying in the same spot. Also risky. Also risky.
01:37:12.146 - 01:37:19.062, Speaker A: You don't want to be caught in the same spot during a paradigm shift. Donald Glover, he's not getting caught in the same spot. What's his take here?
01:37:19.116 - 01:37:41.518, Speaker B: No, Donald Glover gets it. So he says, this is a quote about nfts. Nfts are going to be a thing, but not in the way that people think. They're going to be a. Like, it'll be way easier to not fake things online, and it's going to affect a lot of other stuff in a way that people won't understand for like another five years. Oh, yeah. Remember when we had all that corruption in this section and now it's gone because you basically can't lie about this.
01:37:41.518 - 01:37:54.482, Speaker B: That's probably what's going to happen. This is a live quote out of Donald Glover from South by Southwest. Very rare to see a hot and accurate take from a celebrity. Nice job, Donald. Nice job, Donald. We love it. We love it.
01:37:54.482 - 01:37:55.042, Speaker B: Yes.
01:37:55.176 - 01:38:07.622, Speaker A: I think this man's brilliant. I think he's a genius. Yeah. So I'm not super surprised that he gets nfts, but well articulated. Last take of the week. Another NFT take. David, what's this one from?
01:38:07.676 - 01:38:30.394, Speaker B: Jimmy E. Yeah. J one M-M-Y. Jimmy E. He was recently on the overpriced JPEGS podcast talking about a very similar subject. He goes, in the future, most nfts will be all data and no media. And I think we will look back on the current state of nfts with embedded photos that aren't actually embedded as like analog nfts nfts.
01:38:30.394 - 01:39:22.426, Speaker B: And so this is a little bit like the loot NFT vibe, where instead of having this point to a picture, instead all of the value of the NFT will be embedded inside of it. And we're actually starting to see this. While listening to, listening to this podcast, I learned that the cipher brokers NFT project, they have a bunch of SVG files, like all the properties of a profile picture, NFT, like the blue shirt, 3d sunglasses, beanie caps, like cypherpunk hair or whatever. All of these properties for the cipherpunks nfts are SVG files that are embedded into the Ethereum, into Ethereum on chain. And then what the project does is that it just takes all the different permutations and it layers on all the SVG files. And so every single thing about the NFT is on chain. And so completely trustless, completely decentralized, completely cypherpunk, super bullish on that whole entire concept.
01:39:22.426 - 01:39:30.434, Speaker B: And so the idea that we are going to point outwards for the data that our nfts represent is short term. Short term, yeah, that's a really good take.
01:39:30.472 - 01:40:33.206, Speaker A: And for people who aren't following what an SVG file is. Right. So that's basically like, it's a different type of image format, but it can be all distilled to a bunch of numbers, a bunch of data, basically. And that's different from like bitmap style images of which a gif is one and a JPEG is one, which can't really be distilled into data and can't be embedded on a chain. So with JPEG nfts, which have been this current era, this current generation of nfts, all you can really do on chain, excepting in cases like cryptopunks, where the image is really small enough and able to be fully embedded on chain, is like, you're generally putting a pointer out to an external bitmap image somewhere, right. With svgs, you can just put all of the data on chain and then, wow, the metaverse could fully manifest this particular object or image in any way it chooses to do so, because all of the data behind that image is on chain. So that's part of it.
01:40:33.206 - 01:40:47.110, Speaker A: I don't think Jimmy's saying, like, there's going to be no graphics on chain and it's all going to be like data, but it'll be more like vector style images rather than maybe like, bitmap style jpegs and gifs.
01:40:47.270 - 01:41:15.794, Speaker B: When we did our defining the Metaverse episode, Ryan, the Metaverse is rendered at the periphery, perfectly aligns with this data at the center, compressed, highly dense data at the center, and then it's rendered locally on your computers, because they're just given instructions on how to render it. So when Jimmy says the future of entities will be all data, the data is instructions on how to render the metaverse in your local computer, wherever you are in the world.
01:41:15.832 - 01:41:18.618, Speaker A: Wait, who said that the metaverse is rendered at the periphery?
01:41:18.654 - 01:41:19.862, Speaker B: Did we say that? That's my line.
01:41:19.916 - 01:41:21.174, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great line.
01:41:21.212 - 01:41:24.582, Speaker B: That's a David Hoffman original, brother. Wow. Yeah, you like that one?
01:41:24.716 - 01:41:33.786, Speaker A: No, I love that, man. We should start a podcast there. What are you excited about this week, man?
01:41:33.888 - 01:42:06.222, Speaker B: Oh, my God, Ryan. Okay, so I made this meme earlier this morning about, like, all right, what narrative am I trying to promote on Twitter? Do I want l two two or do I want the merge? And so the meme is the guy sweating. His face doesn't know which button to press. What, do I shill l two two, or do I shill the merge? Because the thing is, I think they're both happening around the same time. I think l two two, and the merge is going to happen towards end of q two, start of q three, mutual climax time. I think that's what's about to happen, right?
01:42:06.296 - 01:42:07.960, Speaker A: Wow. Very exciting year.
01:42:08.410 - 01:42:10.438, Speaker B: Of course somebody would be excited about that.
01:42:10.524 - 01:42:21.098, Speaker A: A new article by David Hoffman, mutual climax thesis. Wow. This is the type of content people subscribe to bankless for.
01:42:21.184 - 01:42:23.740, Speaker B: That's exactly right, Ryan. What are you excited about?
01:42:24.350 - 01:42:44.834, Speaker A: I don't think I can top that. Mine was going to be, the institutions are here. They're not just coming, but they're here. And that's also an unfortunate turn of phrase. Anyway, the institutions are here is the bottom line. So there was this phrase repeated over and over again in 2018. The institutions are coming.
01:42:44.834 - 01:43:06.326, Speaker A: The institutions are coming. There won't be a bear market was kind of the implication because big copium institutions would buy our bags. And that really never happened. No, the institutions were nowhere in 2018, 2019. Goldman Sachs is not talking about digitization on their homepage. They were not buying DFI. No one believed in it.
01:43:06.326 - 01:43:30.766, Speaker A: Ethereum was dead. Bitcoin was just hanging by a thread. But now they're here, okay, like this week, digitization on the Goldman Sachs homepage. They just announced their first trade. We talked about that earlier. Bridgewater, Ray, Dalio, massive fund, not only in terms of assets under managed, but in terms of institutional respect, right? This guy's like a global leader. They're doing crypto now.
01:43:30.766 - 01:43:33.890, Speaker A: Qualcomm, even their metaverse fund.
01:43:33.960 - 01:43:34.434, Speaker B: Right?
01:43:34.552 - 01:44:06.666, Speaker A: The institutions are here. They're not coming anywhere. They're here. And that is a shift. I don't know when it happened. It feels like I kind of thought in the days of 19, 2019, when I somewhat thought that, that meme could be true, that there would be, like, a big announcement and somebody would be like, yeah, we're here now, guys. Well, it's actually just happened without people knowing about it, and it's happening on a week by week basis, but they are quite obviously here.
01:44:06.666 - 01:44:31.266, Speaker A: What I think that means, David, is we kind of won. Crypto is not going anywhere at this point in time. The world's biggest institutions are behind it. That means nation states will eventually fall in line because of lobbying. Yes. And it'll be a slow trickle at times. Sometimes it'll feel like a stampede, but the institutions are already here.
01:44:31.266 - 01:44:39.782, Speaker A: And I feel like I've just realized that maybe in the last week or two, it's not as cool as yours. Okay. But it's what I had.
01:44:39.916 - 01:44:47.560, Speaker B: Hey, the institutions are here for the mutual that we are ever going to get.
01:44:48.650 - 01:44:53.190, Speaker A: All right, meme of the week, guys. What are we looking at here? David?
01:44:53.270 - 01:45:17.490, Speaker B: Yeah, this is, sorry for the podcast listeners. This one's not going to translate very well, but we're going to watch a short video of two high schoolers in a lunchroom having a break dance competition. So we have a guy who's decently good at break dancing. I'll give him a soft five out of ten going up against, like a kind of a white, skinny, nerdy kid who doesn't, you wouldn't expect to be good at break dancing, but he absolutely kills it. And then the caption is, three months later, he created Ethereum.
01:45:19.030 - 01:45:37.314, Speaker A: That's amazing. Yeah. Look, I just feel the vibes of this video. I don't know exactly why I like it, but there's something about it, right? Vitalik Buterin surprising everyone. That's what that means about, too. I think that's it. None of this has been financial advice.
01:45:37.314 - 01:45:47.830, Speaker A: It never is. ETH is risky. So is defi. So is bitcoin. You could definitely lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.
01:45:47.830 - 01:45:48.522, Speaker A: Thanks a lot.
