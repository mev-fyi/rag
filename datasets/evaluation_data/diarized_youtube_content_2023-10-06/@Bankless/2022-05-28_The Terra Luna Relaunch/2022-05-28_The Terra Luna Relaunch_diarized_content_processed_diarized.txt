00:00:00.160 - 00:00:15.593, Speaker A: It looks like Luna is rising from the Ashes. Terra 2.0. I guess I should say so. Luna is a token. Terra is the chain. Of course there's going to be a new Luna as well. And basically what they're doing is relaunching this blockchain network as a layer one without the Algo Stablecoin this time.
00:00:15.593 - 00:00:31.385, Speaker A: So there seems to be some acknowledgement. Hey, I think that was kind of a bad idea. And they are distributing Luna tokens to the Luna Classic. So I guess the old Luna Network is now called Luna Classic. Old chain Luna Classic new chain is currently called Luna. Okay. And they're giving it to a community pool first of all.
00:00:31.385 - 00:00:44.765, Speaker A: Then they're getting giving an allotment to the pre Attack Luna holders and then the post attack. Yeah. Oh my God. I can't believe I'm reading that out. And I didn't even notice that propaganda. But absolutely I refuse to call it an attack now that you said that.
