If that was so, why is it that no other animal except Homo sapiens trades? Because interest is not enough. You need trust in order to trade with somebody, you need to trust them.
00:00:17.073 - 00:00:45.705, Speaker A: Now, the biggest question in much of human history is how do you trust strangers? It's easy to trust your own band members, family, friends.

I don't know you personally, but because we both believe in the same spirit, I trust you. You look at the America, the US Dollar, what's written on it? In God we trust.
00:00:45.705 - 00:00:47.865, Speaker A: There is no dollar without some God.
