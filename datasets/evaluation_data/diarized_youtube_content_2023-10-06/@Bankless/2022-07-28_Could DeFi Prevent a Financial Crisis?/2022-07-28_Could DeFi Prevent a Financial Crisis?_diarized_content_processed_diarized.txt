00:00:00.170 - 00:00:31.382, Speaker A: Would DFI have been able to prevent something like a 2008 financial crisis? It certainly would have been mitigated. If you look at the traditional financial system, right? Like, the problem is it's kind of become addicted, right? It's like if you're addicted to drugs, and then you can't just migrate it all the DFI overnight because the market would die from withdrawal, basically. And so you look at the market like it's kind of addicted to loose monetary policy and low rates. If you look at finance today, the core base layer isn't always stable. 2008 was a great example of that. But once everything's on DFI, at least the core base layer will be stable. There will be stuff on top that blows up just like there was this year with the centralized companies built on top.
00:00:31.382 - 00:00:52.940, Speaker A: But at least the core of the financial system is, like, solid. And I think that would help prevent the problem Ben Bernanke talked about, right. It would have felt like the world would have ended if the government didn't bail people out in eight, versus if it were just a handful of banks on top of rails that were really solid, where everyone's kind of sharing the same sort of risks mechanisms, liquidation mechanisms, transparency that provides, I think, oh, eight would have been a much smaller, smaller event.
