00:00:07.930 - 00:00:12.478, Speaker A: Bankless nation. It is the first week of May. David Hoffman, what time is it?
00:00:12.564 - 00:00:26.534, Speaker B: It is roll up time, Ryan. We are rolling up the first week of May. The crypto industry moves so incredibly fast that we need to dedicate a whole entire episode to making sure that you can keep up with it. And so we are going through all the things that happened in the last.
00:00:26.572 - 00:00:46.346, Speaker A: Week of crypto markets, releases, news takes, what we're excited about ending with the meme of the week. Stay tuned for the meme of the week. It's a good one. We're going to try to jam pack the entire week of crypto into your Friday morning. Enjoy this with a cup of coffee. David, we've had a busy week, man. I heard a Dow launched it.
00:00:46.368 - 00:00:47.414, Speaker B: Did what? Dow?
00:00:47.462 - 00:00:49.094, Speaker A: Yes, a very important Dow.
00:00:49.142 - 00:00:50.220, Speaker B: Oh, tell me more.
00:00:50.670 - 00:00:53.578, Speaker A: It's called the bankless Dao and you should be a part of it.
00:00:53.744 - 00:00:56.042, Speaker B: I think I will. I think I like that dow.
00:00:56.186 - 00:00:59.150, Speaker A: You should be a part of the bankless movement, David.
00:01:00.050 - 00:01:02.442, Speaker B: How do I become a part of the bankless movement? Ryan?
00:01:02.586 - 00:01:28.714, Speaker A: Dude, we're going to get to all that, actually. So I think we have a section for bankless Dao when we talk about releases. I think we have a section when we talk about news. I think we have a section when we talk about what we're excited about because it has definitely been an exciting week. So if you haven't heard, bankless has launched a Dow basically through a genesis team. And it is going like gangbusters. I can't even keep up with the amount of activity that's going on.
00:01:28.714 - 00:01:33.478, Speaker A: Some exciting stuff brewing in the bankless community and the bankless movement.
00:01:33.574 - 00:02:03.314, Speaker B: Yeah. Inside the bankless Dow discord, it really just feels like a shaken snow globe. And everything is starting and it's chaotic and crazy and everyone's really excited and everyone's buzing. And we're starting to see the first little drifts of settlement as to people are finding their niches. People are self organizing, emergent organization. A lot of thoughts are going around as to how dows work nowadays, especially a media and culture Dow. We didn't actually do too much on chain stuff.
00:02:03.314 - 00:02:10.530, Speaker B: There's no smart contracts. We don't have a protocol. We have an organization of people. And that's something that is unique.
00:02:10.690 - 00:02:29.738, Speaker A: It's completely layer zero, completely people. And just like a shaken snow globe, it's pretty beautiful, like seeing all of it come together. All right, man. We'll talk about the Dow many times throughout this episode, but let's get to the markets first, David, that's what the people are here for. They want to know what the bitcoin price is right now. What is the bitcoin price?
00:02:29.824 - 00:02:43.818, Speaker B: Bitcoin price, $55,720 at the time of recording. Bitcoin, just hovering between 50 and $60,000 would be the range that I would call it at just a very long consolidation period for bitcoin.
00:02:43.994 - 00:02:52.478, Speaker A: So we're up on the week, but still, like, it's not hitting its bull highs as it was previously. What does that mean for ether?
00:02:52.574 - 00:03:24.858, Speaker B: Ether? Quite the opposite. Quite the opposite story. Ether has hit a new high, actually, of the day of recording at $3,600. It is currently at $3,460 at the time of recording. And it's really done a fantastic job of not dumping, which is absolutely crazy. Ether started the week as low as $2,700 and then went all the way up to $3,600. And a lot of people in my circles and the people I talked to were like, all right, this has got to be like, too steep, too fast, too steep, it's going to dump.
00:03:24.858 - 00:04:08.630, Speaker B: And then it continued to keep on going up. So I would call this precariously high. But if we want to call this a quote unquote new financial paradigm where people were underexposed to ether and now they are trying to snatch back what ether they could because they were underexposed to it, now realizing that perhaps this is actually going to be a new global store of value, then it kind of makes sense that people are fomoing into ether, not just individuals, but institutions. And there's been a lot of conversation this week, especially that this extra, basically insane buying volume and buying pressure for ether has been coming from institutions rotating into ether and understanding and accepting ether as a macro store of value asset.
00:04:08.790 - 00:04:48.598, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's the big story in markets this week, to be honest, David. And what's interesting about what you said is people who are worried about the price of ether, they'll point to bitcoin and say, well, can ether sustain this level of price and continue to grow while bitcoin is stagnant? Because that hasn't been the case previously. Except, David, if you flash back to 2017, when this was happening, from March 2017 on forward to most of the rest of the bull run, was ether. It was a story of ether outpacing bitcoin. Maybe we are repeating 2017 again. We've talked about this on bankless. We talked about it last year.
00:04:48.598 - 00:05:12.922, Speaker A: We even talked about it at the earliest episodes of, like, we think that 2021 is going to be somewhat of a repeat of 2017, and maybe that's what's going on. But you mentioned institutions. This is Ash. He works at a crypto hedge fund institution. This is a tweet thread. He put together about 14 reasons ETH is a higher upside treasury reserve asset. Interesting term.
00:05:12.922 - 00:05:19.538, Speaker A: Treasury reserve asset versus bitcoin. David, I think we should do all 14, but we got to be quick, man.
00:05:19.704 - 00:05:36.482, Speaker B: There's a lot in here. Yeah, I think before we get started, because, Ryan, I know you're going to take number one. The interesting thing to note is he's calling it a treasury reserve asset. That's basically what I was saying when I was saying macro store of value. Different words, same. But the important note is higher upside. Higher upside.
00:05:36.482 - 00:05:39.610, Speaker B: So keep that in your brain as we go through these. Ryan, you want to kick us off?
00:05:39.760 - 00:05:57.850, Speaker A: Yeah, man, let's do every other. Okay, so I'll do one. So ETH is a proven store of value, having appreciated 85,000% since inception five years ago. Six years ago in 2015, 85,000% since inception.
00:05:57.930 - 00:05:58.846, Speaker B: Proof of number go up.
00:05:58.868 - 00:06:00.910, Speaker A: Absolutely crazy. Yeah, do two for us.
00:06:00.980 - 00:06:22.726, Speaker B: Two. ETH is only 25% of the market of bitcoin. Bitcoin is $1 trillion versus ether $317,000,000,000. So there's that upside, right? Like, if you believe that ether is equivalent in bitcoin store of value nature, you would see ether being only 25% of what Bitcoin's market cap is.
00:06:22.908 - 00:06:39.130, Speaker A: ETH staked is now going up. ETH staked now exceeds $9 billion. So that is ETH locked in, staking. That is 3.26% of ETH supply and going up. If Justin Drake ultrasound money thesis pans out, that's number three.
00:06:39.280 - 00:06:56.370, Speaker B: Number four, scarcity is here. EIP 1559 effectively cancels out ETH inflation rate, which really puts ether as a macro store of value treasury reserve asset. It cancels out ETH's inflation rate of 4%. So EIP 1559, no inflation.
00:06:56.950 - 00:07:18.354, Speaker A: There you go, another ultrasound money theme, 22.5% of ETH. This is number five, supplies illiquid locked up in smart contracts. This is ETH being used as economic bandwidth. Another bankless theme for DFI. And ash says number will only go up over time as use cases accelerated. And we're certainly seeing DFI use cases accelerating.
00:07:18.354 - 00:07:19.570, Speaker A: What's number six, David?
00:07:19.650 - 00:07:35.630, Speaker B: Six whale wallets are growing. Wallets that hold more than 10,000 ether. Right. This is actually people, largely institutions, I would say, who are actually putting more and more ether into their treasury, into their balance sheets. So people with big money are buying more ether.
00:07:36.050 - 00:07:52.594, Speaker A: We report on this number seven every week, 66 billion in us dollars locked in DFI protocols. That is aggregate of everything that's locked in DFI protocols, and that's 66 billion already growing at a rate of 40% per month. Absolutely crazy.
00:07:52.792 - 00:08:17.286, Speaker B: Grayscale. At number eight, grayscale holds roughly 3% of all ether supply, which, quote, unquote, won't be sold anytime soon. And if you are a lazy institution and you don't want to set up the infrastructure for just more sophisticated holding ether, you just go to Grayscale, right? So that 3%, that's not just grayscale as an institution, that's other institutions using grayscale to access Ether and put it on the balance sheet won't be sold.
00:08:17.318 - 00:08:47.202, Speaker A: Because it can't be sold as well. The way Grayscale's product works. Number nine, Ethereum has over 2000 active monthly developers compared to bitcoin at 360. Development leads to more apps, more innovation, more disruption. Look, that developer score is only measuring Ethereum specific protocol libraries, so it doesn't even include all of the developers that are building DFI protocols on top of Ethereum. And Ethereum is still leading the charge there. What's number ten, David?
00:08:47.266 - 00:09:11.500, Speaker B: Number ten. ETH derivatives have gone from 50 million in April of 2020 to 3 billion total open interest institution adoption signal. Institutions love derivatives. They love options, and that is really how they elect to get exposure to assets like ether. And so not only are we seeing a maturing in the derivatives market, but we're seeing adoption of it, which means that institutions are using it.
00:09:11.810 - 00:09:24.574, Speaker A: This follows number ten. This is number eleven. ETH futures positions have seen a 20 x increase now sit at 7.5 billion in open interest. Another institutional adoption signal 1224 hours.
00:09:24.612 - 00:09:36.920, Speaker B: ETH options trading volume has gone from 1 million in May 2019 to exceed $1 billion in daily open interest. Again, same thing as before. This is what institutions use. Looks like they're using it.
00:09:37.450 - 00:09:43.750, Speaker A: Number 13. ETFs in Canada. Full stop. ETH ETFs in Canada. They're coming to the US soon, right?
00:09:43.820 - 00:10:03.550, Speaker B: That's the tweet. Number 14. ETH is starting to gain and decorrelate with bitcoin. And this will continue as developer activity rises and more use cases are created. That decorrelation from bitcoin is key to actually people understanding it to be a uniquely different and compelling macro store value asset.
00:10:03.890 - 00:10:20.894, Speaker A: Ash summarizes it with a price prediction. ETH currently range from 10,000. He says is inevitable. 100,000. Best case scenario, 100,000. Absolutely crazy numbers here. And he says there's more incentive to hold ETH than bitcoin due to Ethereum's growing use cases.
00:10:20.894 - 00:10:45.318, Speaker A: Again, Ash works at a crypto hedge fund. He's been listening to bankless for a while. I think he's tuned into the narrative here, and that is the narrative being presented to institutions right now. So if you're confused by why ETH price go up while bitcoin price stay flat, take a look at this thread. Relisten to the last 14 points we made. All right, David, let's go to the DFI token watch. DFI pulse index.
00:10:45.318 - 00:10:46.810, Speaker A: Where are we right now?
00:10:46.880 - 00:11:07.874, Speaker B: Yeah. DPI, currently priced at $560, hit an all time high of $584. Is that right? That's not right. No. The all time high was earlier this week at $610 or so, and currently took a little bit of a tumble from that high down to $560. But overall dollar price performance of DPi. Doing great.
00:11:07.874 - 00:11:08.706, Speaker B: Doing great.
00:11:08.808 - 00:11:15.214, Speaker A: Going up. Not as fast as ETH, though. Tell us the story. In our DPi slaughtered.
00:11:15.262 - 00:11:37.180, Speaker B: DPi being slaughtered on the ETH ratio. It had a valiant effort at 0.2. It had another valiant effort at zero, but it ultimately has fallen down to zero ether per DPi. And so DFI assets getting just absolutely demolished in ether terms, as you expect. Ether just went.
00:11:37.710 - 00:11:39.290, Speaker A: Are you happy, David?
00:11:40.270 - 00:11:40.826, Speaker B: Yes.
00:11:40.928 - 00:11:41.902, Speaker A: It was ETH's turn.
00:11:41.956 - 00:12:01.458, Speaker B: It was ETH turn. It has never been ETH's turn since literally December of 2017. It patiently waited its turn and ETH's moment. Right now, I'm eyeing the ETH to DPi trade. I'm eyeing it. It looks tempting. DPI is going to reverse at some point in time.
00:12:01.458 - 00:12:05.614, Speaker B: It's just a matter of at what point do you want to catch the falling knife?
00:12:05.742 - 00:12:12.530, Speaker A: You think we're going to have another defi summer, but we might have an ETh summer first is kind of the point, right? And it's hard to trade.
00:12:12.610 - 00:12:17.240, Speaker B: We've already had an ETH spring two seasons of ETH in a row. You would spoil me, sir.
00:12:18.010 - 00:12:46.418, Speaker A: We'll see how it plays out. All right, let's talk about stablecoin supply, because these are hitting new all time highs, too. The first stat we have is USDC, which is Coinbase circle. They hit 15 billion. So 15 billion on chain in USDC. Another follow up to that is tether actually hit on chain volumes of 1 trillion, the 1 trillion mark. For the first time, stablecoin adoption is just going up and to the right.
00:12:46.584 - 00:12:59.794, Speaker B: Yeah. And it just makes sense. All the times that Ryan and I talk about how terrible the banking ux UI is. Obviously stablecoins are going up and to the right. Congrats to Tesla. $1 trillion in a one year period. That's pretty phenomenal.
00:12:59.922 - 00:13:12.138, Speaker A: Guess what, man? I had to wire funds from, literally, from a Wells Fargo account this week, right? So had to schedule an appointment with the banker. Had to go there in person.
00:13:12.304 - 00:13:13.994, Speaker B: Appointment, right.
00:13:14.112 - 00:13:24.054, Speaker A: The banker asked all sorts of questions, where's the money going? Like, what's happening? All of this. And I was just like, oh, my God, this is a fax machine. You guys are so dead.
00:13:24.102 - 00:13:24.758, Speaker B: Wait, did.
00:13:24.864 - 00:13:28.334, Speaker A: You're operating a fax machine? And we have the Internet here.
00:13:28.452 - 00:13:33.140, Speaker B: Was it like, small talks, like, oh, where is your money going? Or was it like, please fill out this form.
00:13:34.070 - 00:13:41.698, Speaker A: It was a little bit like, oh, so where is the money going? And just weird questions that shouldn't be asked about money.
00:13:41.784 - 00:13:43.554, Speaker B: Marginally personal questions.
00:13:43.752 - 00:13:55.522, Speaker A: Yeah. And it was also, like, a nice person. Good conversation, I guess. But the fact that you have to show up in person to actually make that transaction. Schedule something with the banker.
00:13:55.586 - 00:13:55.958, Speaker B: Right?
00:13:56.044 - 00:13:59.190, Speaker A: Jeez. Friction. Friction. That could be done in 2 seconds.
00:13:59.930 - 00:14:08.054, Speaker B: My roommate, he was going to transfer me some money, and for some reason, we just did it in cash, because he's my roommate. Just handed it to me. I took real cash.
00:14:08.092 - 00:14:08.582, Speaker A: Paper dollars.
00:14:08.636 - 00:14:21.614, Speaker B: Paper dollars. Literally the worst form of cash. And so I took that to the bank, and I gave it private, though. I gave it to the. Well, not when I come to the bank with it. I gave it to that teller, and she was, oh, like, did you make a big sale? And I'm like, don't ask. Don't ask about that.
00:14:21.652 - 00:14:27.226, Speaker A: That's not your information. What are you, ethereum?
00:14:27.258 - 00:14:27.694, Speaker B: Doesn't ask.
00:14:27.732 - 00:14:45.346, Speaker A: Why do you? Doesn't ask. Exactly. All right, David, let's get to this while we're on markets, man. Doge is everyone. Many friends that I know, they'll text me about Doge price these days. Right. So what's going on? And why so sad?
00:14:45.538 - 00:14:50.886, Speaker B: Because we live in a goddamn meme culture. That's what's going on. Yeah. Deep, really.
00:14:50.988 - 00:14:52.618, Speaker A: But we love memes, don't we?
00:14:52.704 - 00:14:53.206, Speaker B: Good memes?
00:14:53.238 - 00:14:54.038, Speaker A: What's your problem with memes?
00:14:54.054 - 00:14:56.300, Speaker B: There are good memes and there are bad memes. Yeah.
00:14:56.670 - 00:15:00.170, Speaker A: Why is this a bad meme? It's the people's money. Right?
00:15:00.240 - 00:15:14.830, Speaker B: It's Doge. Yeah. God damn it, Elon. Look what you've done, Elon. The thing is we are doing our best to promote the real values that this industry has to offer and then doze just fucking yeets itself to the goddamn moon.
00:15:14.990 - 00:15:37.586, Speaker A: Joe Weisenthal, do you know him? Bloomberg commentary on finance has lots to say about crypto. Of course he says that. Okay, David Doge is no different than bitcoin. It's just a meme, buddy. It's a community that says it's going up, hold it as a store of value. It is money. It's no different than bitcoin.
00:15:37.586 - 00:15:38.726, Speaker A: What's your take on?
00:15:38.828 - 00:16:07.700, Speaker B: Yeah, like, the thing is, it's a funny meme, but bitcoin is a meme in the same as the US dollar is also a meme. It's just something that you have in your head and you ascribe value to it. When we talk about memes, we're just talking about narratives, right? The bitcoin narrative is serious. Bitcoin narrative is personal sovereignty with money. No money, printer power by the people, for the people. And Doge is like, haha, cute dog number. Go up.
00:16:07.700 - 00:16:25.510, Speaker B: The narrative behind the meme is important. The doge meme is very nihilist. I'm all one to say, like, fuck the system, but I want to fuck the system with a better system. Doge is like, you know what? Let's actually just burn everything because nothing matters anymore and let's pump it to the moon.
00:16:25.850 - 00:16:45.770, Speaker A: I think of it is, look, I feel like it's a low conviction meme. Like, it's a meme, but it's a low conviction. You're not going to get holders of last resort in Doge. They're here for the pump. They're going to be gone. And by the way, have you looked at Doge distribution near the awful? It's terrible, right? Yeah.
00:16:45.840 - 00:17:04.574, Speaker B: The reason why Doge makes outside news is because I bet you a much higher percentage of Doge is lost than bitcoin. Because why would you keep on holding on to your doge, right? You would just lose it. And so that's why it goes from one penny to $0.60 in under, like, three months. Because there's no supply. There's no supply.
00:17:04.622 - 00:17:23.338, Speaker A: I have a point there, Gary. Vee just said that he had some doge and he lost it because he didn't know what it was. Yeah, he just said that on the podcast earlier this week. Anyway, Doge, we'll get back to you when we get to the Elon SNL news. But for now, we want to tell you about the fantastic sponsors that made this episode possible bankless is proud to.
00:17:23.344 - 00:17:57.826, Speaker B: Be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on Ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while, and we'll say it again.
00:17:57.826 - 00:18:25.902, Speaker B: Daos have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap Dow no matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a Uni grant@unigrants.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
00:18:25.902 - 00:19:04.042, Speaker B: That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you Uniswap for sponsoring bankless Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange.

00:19:52.670 - 00:20:05.790, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back with the hot releases of the week. David, we have to start here. Let's start with the Unicorn man. Uniswap v three. You heard about it with our podcast with Hayden Adams. He finally came on, David. He told us about it.
00:20:05.790 - 00:20:11.530, Speaker A: And now it is here. May 5, it arrived. Talk about it. What launched mainet?
00:20:11.610 - 00:20:23.634, Speaker B: Yeah, uniswap v three finally here. And so there is now this, a little bit of a tug of war between uniswap v. Two and Uniswap v. Three. Right? Uniswap v. Three is not the simple transition that uniswap v. One to v two was.
00:20:23.634 - 00:20:59.854, Speaker B: Uniswap v three has much more dials, much more switches, much more things that need to be tinkered with and people need to learn how to use it. And so that's what's here today. And I actually think the really cool thing is right there. Ryan, tweet number four in this tweet thread is that if you guys remember, when you deposit liquidity into Uniswap, it's a specific band of price action, right? So you are only depositing for a very narrow band of price action or a wide band. It's up to you. But the point is it's unique to you and it's unique to what you chose. And so when you make a unique deposit in providing liquidity, you get an NFT back.
00:20:59.854 - 00:21:26.386, Speaker B: And the cool thing is they've actually made cool little gifts for the NFT. So I would imagine that you can see your nft lp deposit into uniswap b three on something like openc or any other NFt explorer. It's going to show up next to your bankless batch or any other nfts that you own. So that's kind of cool. Which is actually kind of really bridging the world of DFI to nfts because they're kind of two separate worlds and now they're getting a little closer.
00:21:26.498 - 00:21:41.070, Speaker A: It's kind of fun. Look, and that's an incentive to open up a pool. So kind of neat that way, too. David, let's go to the high level. I thought this tweet from Hayden was actually pretty good. He said it's been 24 hours since the launch of uniswap v three. And here are some stats.
00:21:41.070 - 00:22:11.970, Speaker A: V three's 24 hours volume was already 150,000,000. They've got 300 million total locked. And volume by efficiency, which is a really interesting score, is 50%. And he compares that to uniswap v two. And the bottom line is, in its first day, v three has already seen twice the volume that v two. Not v one, v two saw in its first month. So again, kind of, we're on this exponential curve of growth.
00:22:11.970 - 00:22:21.762, Speaker A: V three is like two x v two volume in its first month, and it's doing that in the first day. Pretty crazy volumes already coming out of uniswap v three.
00:22:21.916 - 00:22:38.890, Speaker B: Yeah, there were some complaints from people who are just trying to use uniswap v three that some things were broken, some things weren't working. And as you can see, there's a comment right below that Hayden's tweet saying, oof, it cost me $150 to provide liquidity. Providing liquidity. That transaction is just more intensive.
00:22:38.970 - 00:22:39.214, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:39.252 - 00:23:13.770, Speaker B: And so hopping in and out of liquidity pools is going to be more complex now that it's an NFT. There were a few other things that the migration from v two to v three wouldn't work with a ledger just for some developer coding reasons. That's over my head. But there is going to be transition friction, because like I said, this is not just like an upgraded v one to v two. This is a brand new amm system. And so the porting of v two to v three is going to have some friction. There's going to be some learning curve pains, but I think in the long term, it's going to all work out.
00:23:13.920 - 00:23:48.466, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Some things from the beginning, and I tweeted this out, like, hey, who's tried it? What's your experience so far with v three? And people mentioned some UI bugs. The analytics aren't quite working. There's an issue with connecting a hardware wallet to metamask and using it, an issue with the signature that is probably not resolved as you guys are listening to this. So some UI friction, but overall, man, that's not stopping the volume. You know what? We should unbox this ourselves. So I haven't spent much time here, David, myself, using this, and I'm going to pull up uniswap V three and actually see what's different about it.
00:23:48.466 - 00:23:50.738, Speaker A: So it looks like I've got the same swap interface.
00:23:50.834 - 00:23:52.710, Speaker B: Slightly different, but pretty much the same.
00:23:52.860 - 00:24:04.986, Speaker A: Yeah, looks really simple. It's kind of that Google level simplicity of the interface. And let's say I want to trade, let's say, a 10th of an eth for some dai. What am I doing here?
00:24:05.088 - 00:24:23.182, Speaker B: Yeah. See the Dai slippage? A decent amount of slippage in price movement. Yeah. Right. It's 24 hours old. I'm sure that's going to get worked out again. Liquidity providers are going to have to learn how to provide liquidity, and so I think people are being methodical and slow about that.
00:24:23.316 - 00:24:50.906, Speaker A: Look at this button, though. It says, get a better price on v two. So I guess you can get a better price on v two. A button pops up to show you that, because this is a lot of slippage. Almost a full percent slippage price movement for that action. But the big thing that V two was supposed to provide was sort of stablecoin to stablecoin trades in the way that curve does with very low slippage. So here's USDC to die, and the slippage is fairly low.
00:24:50.906 - 00:25:06.158, Speaker A: Looks like it might be a better price for 100 USDC to die than uniswap v two. The price impact is 0.2%, I should say. I wonder what happens if we scale this up.
00:25:06.244 - 00:25:21.986, Speaker B: Yeah, see, that's where it gets pretty cool. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. So you're already up to $1,000, and it only got a little bit more illiquid. Yeah. And so now we're up to $10,000, and it's actually just the same amount of illiquidity as one less zero. Right.
00:25:21.986 - 00:25:38.550, Speaker B: And so actually, now we're up to $100,000, and it's still zero point. 34%. And so it's actually not getting any more air. You keep adding zeros, it's actually not getting any more illiquid. And at some point, you have to max it out because you're going to just completely wipe a market maker from one.
00:25:38.620 - 00:25:41.930, Speaker A: It's starting to max out. $10 million trade.
00:25:42.350 - 00:25:47.450, Speaker B: $10 million trade. What's $1 million? How much slippage?
00:25:48.030 - 00:25:52.058, Speaker A: Let me count my zeros here. 123456.
00:25:52.144 - 00:26:02.090, Speaker B: Okay. $1 million gets you 0.4% in slippage on USDC to die. If you add in one more zero. Ryan. If you go to $10 million, it gets to be 3.5% slippage.
00:26:02.090 - 00:26:13.138, Speaker B: If you add one more zero. That's all of it. 90% slippage. That's all of it. Okay, so if anyone was interested in trading $10 million of USDC to get.
00:26:13.144 - 00:26:14.466, Speaker A: A better price on v two, you.
00:26:14.488 - 00:26:39.094, Speaker B: Might get a better price on v two. But overall, that is the power of Uniswap V three. Right. It historically was terrible for stablecoin transfers because it would put the same amount of liquidity across the full spectrum. But now liquidity providers like this is the easiest, most basic way to use v three in the upgraded fashion is only providing liquidity against a very narrow band of prices, which is particularly well suited to, like, priced assets.
00:26:39.142 - 00:26:54.090, Speaker A: It's super cool, dude. I'm going to look at liquidity here so I can create a new position. It looks like, what if I want to, or I can migrate v two liquidity, maybe I'll put a new position here. Is this me creating a whole new pair?
00:26:54.170 - 00:27:14.006, Speaker B: Yeah. Yes. Well, you would have to select a pair, but I think really just the adding liquidity page really illustrates all the different things about uniswap V three. Right. So it lets you select the three different fee tiers for the die east pair. Yeah, I think the 3.3%, that's the uniswap v two and v one.
00:27:14.006 - 00:27:42.554, Speaker B: Default fee is 0.3%, but you can pick different ones and there will be liquidity in each of these different pairs. But one of the fee tiers is going to become the shelling point for every single trading pair. And then you would set your price range. Right, and so you would pick where the band of price that you would want to supply to. So Ryan is providing die to EtH between 2991 to three. Yeah, it's got a little clunky interface.
00:27:42.554 - 00:27:48.514, Speaker B: Right. Overwrite all that and go back to 3004 thousand, 3000.
00:27:48.712 - 00:27:49.666, Speaker A: Keeps changing it on.
00:27:49.688 - 00:27:52.034, Speaker B: Yeah, it keeps changing. Yeah. Clunky little Ui stuff.
00:27:52.072 - 00:27:52.802, Speaker A: It's close, though.
00:27:52.856 - 00:27:54.660, Speaker B: It's very close. Very close.
00:27:55.910 - 00:28:13.514, Speaker A: That's the difference. If I want to provide a price range band for my liquidity, I couldn't do that in uniswap v two. I had to provide for the entire spectrum. But now I could set a spectrum of somewhere between $3,000 and $4,000 where I'm providing that liquidity. Right. That's the difference, yeah, exactly. Interesting.
00:28:13.514 - 00:28:35.358, Speaker A: All right, very cool. Let's take a look at how it's doing so far, I guess at the aggregate level. And I think this is where Uniswap analytics come in. So you took these screenshots, David? On the left we have v two. Screenshot from v two. On the right we have v three. What are we looking at the differences in terms of liquidity or total locked value, and also 24 hours volume here?
00:28:35.444 - 00:28:54.406, Speaker B: Well, obviously there's just no comparison. Right, because Uniswap v. Two is many years old and it has all of Unitswap's money. Basically, uniswap v. Three is very, very young, only 24 hours old. So people are still migrating liquidity over. But I think that for understanding the Ui, what's important to note is on the left side where we see uniswap v.
00:28:54.406 - 00:29:22.122, Speaker B: Two, we have liquidity. That's the name that they've bestowed upon all the money, all the value of all deposits into uniswap v. Two. On the right side we have TVL. And the reason why they've changed this wording from liquidity to TVL is that in uniswap v. Two, you deposit like $100 worth of ETH and 100 USDC into the USCC ETH pool, and that gets spread evenly across the whole entire trading pair.
00:29:22.186 - 00:29:23.294, Speaker A: So that's all liquidity.
00:29:23.342 - 00:29:42.200, Speaker B: It's all liquidity. Right. But on uniswap v. Three, you have to specify where you are putting the money. It's not all liquidity, it's TVL. So a slight change in jargon, but I think it's more accurate and more precise. Right, and then on the other side.
00:29:43.690 - 00:29:49.430, Speaker A: The point I'll underline here is you can get more liquidity for less TVL. That's the efficiency factor.
00:29:49.510 - 00:30:07.726, Speaker B: Yes, I forgot about that part. Right, so TVL is the same thing in uniswap v. Three as liquidity is in v. Two. But with TVl in uniswap v. Three, the same amount of TVL would actually, in theory, perhaps give way more liquidity. That's the whole point of uniswap v.
00:30:07.726 - 00:30:13.086, Speaker B: Three, is that your dollar goes further in liquidity terms in uniswap v. Three.
00:30:13.268 - 00:30:17.710, Speaker A: All right, very cool. So what's this second chart we're showing? Or this list, I guess.
00:30:17.780 - 00:30:41.806, Speaker B: Yeah, second chart again on the left it's uniswap v two, on the right is uniswap v. Three. And we're just looking at the different pools, right? So we have the Faye eth and Faye tribe, uniswap v. Two pools as the largest pools in uniswap v two. And then goes USCC eth. And then the other common pairs, WBTC, eth and etH, USDT and uni eth. And then on the right we have the uniswap v three pools.
00:30:41.806 - 00:31:00.718, Speaker B: And what's also added here is that each one, you see that 0.3% fee tier, that's something that's going to be new in uniswap v three, because you do see the one of die to USDC, which is a stable coin to stablecoin, and also USDC to USDT. And those are 0.5%, which makes sense.
00:31:00.884 - 00:31:01.642, Speaker A: Lower fees.
00:31:01.706 - 00:31:28.142, Speaker B: Lower fees for stablecoin pairs. Right? And so this is new in uniswap v three. And so these pools are going to be also. So not only is there a theoretical die USDC 5% uniswap pool, that's not theoretical. That's exactly what's there, but there's also a die USDC or di USDT, 0.3% and also 1%. But those are just illogical.
00:31:28.142 - 00:31:51.230, Speaker B: For stablecoin to stablecoin pairs, it might be more appropriate for more illiquid assets. Like Unisox, for example, would actually be a great 1% lp t fear. And so that's something that you need to pay attention to in v three, is that there are these same pools of the same assets, but they can be segregated by trading pair or trading fees.
00:31:51.570 - 00:32:37.534, Speaker A: What's kind of cool here is what we're seeing is, I think, what we expected to see, it's happening. It's still early, but a lot of the stablecoins are receiving a massive amount of seven day volume. Pretty interesting that stablecoin pairs are the one seeing a lot of adoption. And you'd kind of predict that from the way Uniswap V three is optimized for those types of curves. I do wonder, speaking of curves, what curve is thinking as a DFI protocol? Because many have said that V three was going to be sort of a curve killer in curve being a protocol optimized for stablecoin to stablecoin types of trades. And it looks like Uniswap V three is absorbing maybe some of that right now. We'll have to see how that plays out.
00:32:37.652 - 00:33:26.798, Speaker B: I think the last take to have here is that not only do we have up to three different liquidity pools in Uniswap v three with three different fee tiers, even though one of those fee tiers will be the dominant one, there will still be three, and then we still also have Uniswap V two. And so as a user, it's actually getting a little bit more complex to use Uniswap and Uniswap have done a great job making that very easy to navigate that complexity, because they have that button that says there's a different fee tier or different trading pair that's more illiquid or more liquid. But I still think the role of aggregators and index aggregators are going to play a very large role here because they're just going to obfuscate everything. And not only are they going to aggregate across all Uniswap trading pairs, but they're also going to do every single other decks. And so I really only think that aggregators are just going to be the place to access Uniswap v three.
00:33:26.964 - 00:33:38.320, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. We don't lose anything. Uniswap V two is still there. No one's lost anything. We are just gaining in DFI. All right, David, we focused on that release because it's such a big one. We just have a few others this week.
00:33:38.320 - 00:33:55.410, Speaker A: The first one is this launch me bit, an NFT. This is from the folk who created crypto punks. Right? So that's why this is getting such press and such adoption so early. So what is me bits?
00:33:55.490 - 00:34:17.146, Speaker B: Yeah, me bits is crypto punks 2.0, basically, except that where crypto punks were 2d pixels, me bits is 3d pixels. Right. So very much minecraft looking characters and the same basic rules apply. Like each one has different traits. There are many different traits. There's hair, different hairs, glasses, shirts, pants and shoes.
00:34:17.146 - 00:34:43.190, Speaker B: But also you can have multiple different kinds of traits inside of the same category. Right. So you could have like a mohawk that's red, a mohawk that's black. You can have round blue glasses, you can have star yellow glasses. And so it's really just cryptopunks 2.0. And there's been some criticisms of me bit. Some think that the prices for these things and the amount of revenue that larvae labs is going to make is going to be insane for this.
00:34:43.190 - 00:34:57.990, Speaker B: People are saying that this is kind of them making up for how they just never monetized crypto punks yet. Crypto punks are like billions of dollars in market cap. And so there's a little bit of controversy. But at the end of the day, the market decides and right now the market's kind of hot for me bits.
00:34:58.150 - 00:35:09.610, Speaker A: Yeah, it's the $80 million, David. They've sold me bits, NFTs. Some of them are selling for six figures already. And larva labs has banked $80 million, dude.
00:35:09.690 - 00:35:12.222, Speaker B: Yeah. Not something to scoff at.
00:35:12.356 - 00:35:34.610, Speaker A: That is not something to scoff at at all. 8th largest, I believe. NFT market. 8th most successful NFT market project of all time based on the secondary sales volumes as well so I don't know, what are your thoughts in general here? We've had this conversation a little bit, but is this bubble territory again for crypto, for nfTs?
00:35:34.690 - 00:35:53.150, Speaker B: Well, I think the reason why cryptopunks have done so well is that people get to buy them and then put them as their avatar. And that's kind of cool because you get to kind of brag about your crypto punks, but you also, in a very virtual world that is crypto Twitter and crypto discords and whatever.
00:35:53.220 - 00:35:54.042, Speaker A: Social signaling.
00:35:54.106 - 00:36:26.658, Speaker B: Social signaling, right. And what these things are crypto punks are, are avatars and so are me bits. Right. And so what larva Labs is really doing is they're really borrowing from their success on crypto punks, which they did not monetize. And using our episode with Vitalik, borrowing legitimacy from cryptopunks and bestowing a little bit, borrowing some and putting it into, you know, one worked out so well. Speculators are saying, well, the second one might work out pretty well, too. And so there's a lot of buying pressure for me bits.
00:36:26.658 - 00:36:35.958, Speaker B: And I think that I would separate this from the rest of the NFT market because this is something that just like crypto punks, very uniquely crypto.
00:36:36.134 - 00:36:42.510, Speaker A: Sir, you said Vitalik legitimacy episode. Quick plug coming Monday, guys. You have not heard it yet, but that's coming Monday.
00:36:45.090 - 00:36:47.642, Speaker B: Early release for bankless paid subscribers.
00:36:47.786 - 00:37:09.250, Speaker A: Absolutely. So if you are paid subscriber, you already have access to it. David, I'm going to come back to bankless Dow because I want to end there. But let's talk about this, which is super exciting. OKX is a crypto exchange. We call these crypto banks. They are now supporting direct deposits and withdrawals not just on Ethereum mainet, but to a roll up arbitram.
00:37:09.250 - 00:37:30.506, Speaker A: This is something that we had hoped would happen, predicted would happen. Crypto banks actually depositing user funds directly onto roll ups and layer two chains rather than Mainet. This is definitely the future. I feel like a whole bunch of other crypto exchanges will follow suit. And it's super bullish to me. Any takes here?
00:37:30.608 - 00:38:05.334, Speaker B: Yeah, the amount of surface area there is on l two s for just innovation and integrations is extremely large. And it's just going to be overall where people end up where they have their money and it's not on Ethereum. And then they want to go to Ethereum, but they don't want to pay gas prices. What do you do? You go to an l two first and there's no reason why you can't go to an l two first. I think l two s are actually going to become the dominant onboarding vehicle onto Ethereum. Ethereum, the center is actually going to, I think, become like the harder place to get to in the long term because people are just going to want to play around in l two s in the first place.
00:38:05.532 - 00:38:21.306, Speaker A: Difference between an l two and a side chain. Of course. An l two is secured by ethereum, by the asset price of ether, by the economic security of the main chain. A side chain is not that might have its own validator set. Absolutely. So it's bullish news there. Okay.
00:38:21.306 - 00:38:49.378, Speaker A: Speaking of l two s, I think a long awaited feature enhancement for crypto has been privacy. So all of this information is public on the blockchain. If I send you money from an ETH account, somebody knows what my address is, I send it to you. David, they know what your address is. They know exactly how much I sent you. But we are adding privacy to layer twos as well. This is aztec protocol with a private roll up now supporting ZKdi, not just eth.
00:38:49.378 - 00:38:51.574, Speaker A: Kind of cool. Get into this for us.
00:38:51.692 - 00:39:19.658, Speaker B: Yeah. So they launched Zke not too long ago, and again, now they are launching Zkdi, a hidden through line. Again, let's cite the Vitalik episode on legitimacy coming out, where he said that defi apps prefer Dai because of Dai's legitimacy as a stablecoin. So hold that in your brain until Monday when you listen to that episode. Cool. Not only do we have private ETH, but now we have private crypto dollars or die. So that's absolutely fantastic.
00:39:19.834 - 00:39:46.470, Speaker A: I keep going back to like, David, this is the vision for crypto since it was born. Right? Imagine if we had a non sovereign money that was peer to peer and completely private. Right? And now we do. Super cool. What's happening in crypto for those that are paying attention, again, this is not reaching CNN mainstream news yet, but the price of Doge is somehow. David, let's talk about the last release. Bankless Dow welcomes you.
00:39:46.470 - 00:40:07.022, Speaker A: The bankless Dow has officially released. Genesis team put out a post about this. Man, I'm super excited about all of the activity that we've seen in the bankless Dow since launch. It is like that snow Globe, as you said. What are you excited about? That's our last question. I can't ask you that. Don't answer what you're excited about.
00:40:07.022 - 00:40:11.742, Speaker A: Maybe talk about the distribution of it and how it launched. Yeah.
00:40:11.796 - 00:40:42.018, Speaker B: So we wanted to do this differently. And the bankless Dow is already a different dow. Kind of like I said at the beginning, we aren't yearn. We're not sushi swap. We don't have an on chain defi app. We have an off chain group of people who are interested in a shared common banner, the bankless banner. And we got Ryan and I in the bankless LLC side, and we got Lucas, and we got a couple other people.
00:40:42.018 - 00:41:26.760, Speaker B: And so many other people approach us and be like, yo, I would love to help out. How can I help? And I don't really want to be a manager. And I know you don't want to be a manager, Ryan. So bankless LLC doesn't have the surface area to onboard all the people that want to help. Yet bankless Dao as a digital organization, which the difference between discord and Slack, by the way, is they're the same apps, but one is open and one is closed, right? And so discord, where the bankless LLC is, is like the open slack, right. For a company, except it's not a company, it's a Dao. And so when I talked about the snow globe and the settling of people, people are finding their parts of the bankless dow that they want to contribute to.
00:41:26.760 - 00:41:39.610, Speaker B: And it's an open organization. Like, you can find your niche inside of the bankless Dow and contribute in ways that you think is interesting to you, and that's how the DAo grows.
00:41:41.550 - 00:42:10.034, Speaker A: We already did this kind of, in small ways. Right, David? So as you like, we're a very small team producing all of this content, but we've had people in France reach out and say, hey, we want to translate bankless and spread the mission in France. And it's like, yeah, go do. And, like, bankless France has been doing that for the past year, right, as an offshoot, bankless Russia. There are bankless chapters all over the world. There are even bankless clubs inside of universities now. And so we can't coordinate all of that activity.
00:42:10.034 - 00:42:40.890, Speaker A: The meme is really the coordination layer. Like, what's the bankless movement about? It's about going bankless, right? It's just like, that's all you need to know. And with that rallying cry now, others can get involved in the movement, but now we have a mechanism to coordinate some of that activity. That's the difference with bankless dow. So super exciting, man. And, like, the energy around this, the quality of people who have joined so far, like, I go through, everyone joins the bankless dow, and they introduce themselves in the intros channel. We've got, like, Harvard professors.
00:42:40.890 - 00:42:55.346, Speaker A: There's some talent and rocket scientists. I'm like, you listen to this podcast. What are you doing? But they do. And, yeah, I'm just excited to see what comes of this experiment. It really is an experiment. Yeah.
00:42:55.368 - 00:42:58.534, Speaker B: Let's talk about the Genesis proposal. Ryan, can you bring that up on the screen?
00:42:58.732 - 00:43:02.230, Speaker A: Okay, let me find where that is. I think that's the announcement. Yeah.
00:43:02.300 - 00:43:16.874, Speaker B: Yeah. This is something. Again, a different way to do a dow is that we distributed. The Genesis team distributed the bank token to a bunch of different people based on different criteria. Right. Like, if you were a bankless badge holder. Fun fact.
00:43:16.874 - 00:43:59.226, Speaker B: That's why we were telling you to get the bankless badge so often and a couple of other different vehicles. Did you donate to the Gitcoin? Did you buy a bap zero t shirt and a few other. So I got my airdrop, Ryan got his airdrop, but we didn't get any airdrops in outside of what other people got. Right. We got equivalent airdrops. And then we submitted the Genesis proposal, and that's where bankless LLC requests a distribution of bank from the bankless daO. And so bankless LLC is requesting permission from the bankless community to bestow upon us a portion of the bank tokens that we propose that we think is fair.
00:43:59.226 - 00:44:04.380, Speaker B: And so if you are a bank token holder, you can vote yes or vote no. It's up to.
00:44:06.110 - 00:44:48.970, Speaker A: Really, like, the vision for this is for bankless LLC to be one media node on the network, right, along with other media nodes. And so the Genesis proposal was really like a question. Like, here's what we think we can provide the bankless movement. Would you like us to continue doing that? Would you like us to coordinate our activity? So I think it's not only about bankless LLC getting more involved here. It's also a template for other organizations, other media nodes to get involved. So it's super exciting. And, dude, I had no idea what the people in the Dow would do.
00:44:48.970 - 00:45:30.286, Speaker A: Whether they would vote yes, whether they would vote no, whether they would fine tune the proposal, negotiate. It's all up for discussion, and it has been, and the vote doesn't close until tomorrow. So anyway, this is just a really exciting experiment, and I think that now we have an Internet scale organization that can live long past a set of five individuals that run bankless LLC. Right? So if something happened to, you know, this movement lives on as a media entity, and that's what's so cool about Ethereum and so cool about the structure.
00:45:30.398 - 00:45:53.814, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that's exactly. Again, it's things are a bigger tent under a DaO form. Right. Like, we could not fit enough people under Bankless LLC and to the point where it started to have its own spinoffs. And like you said, with bankless Russia, bankless France. But now everyone can find themselves under the bankless dow tent. Right? And just as you said, the bankless meme needs to be point.
00:45:53.814 - 00:46:07.140, Speaker B: The bankless meme is literally about being a bigger tent. It would be stupid if we kept it under the LLC. It can grow into its fullest potential in Dow form. And so, Ryan, are you familiar with Google's 20% time?
00:46:07.510 - 00:46:13.090, Speaker A: Yeah. That's where they encourage employees to spend 20% on a creative project. Right. Of some kind.
00:46:13.160 - 00:46:36.890, Speaker B: Exactly right. And so you and me, we need to help bootstrap this dow, right? We're part of it. And so I propose that Fridays are Dow days, right. Instead of working on bankless LLC, we work on bankless Dow. Obviously, we're basically in the bankless Dow discord Monday through Friday, plus weekends, too. But we're also juggling bankless LLC stuff. Perhaps on Fridays is only Dow day.
00:46:36.890 - 00:46:37.782, Speaker B: Friday is Dow.
00:46:37.846 - 00:47:12.738, Speaker A: Yeah, dude, that's a good idea. The other thing is all of the 20% hobby time that all of these professionals, outside of their work activity, they can pour their skills and talents into the bankless dow. And that's super exciting. I want to say one last thing and then we'll move to news. And that is this. If you are upset or disappointed that you weren't part of the original distribution, what I want to say is this is four days old. The entire purpose of future seasons of the bankless Dow is to invite more people into the bankless dow.
00:47:12.738 - 00:47:46.154, Speaker A: And so I think the community has lots of things planned. The best thing to do is continue to monitor, raise your hand, volunteer, do things for the movement, get noticed when grant proposal process comes available, apply for a grant. There's tons of ways to stay plugged in. This is just the first week. So anyway, just stay tuned for that. If you're excited about the bankless movement, want to help out again, this is for the builders of the bankless movement. This isn't necessarily for the consumers.
00:47:46.154 - 00:48:00.262, Speaker A: Right. If you are just listening to the bankless show, absorbing the content on your journey, you don't have to be involved in the bankless Dow at all. This is for the people that are building it. For those users. Anyway, that's it, man.
00:48:00.316 - 00:48:02.438, Speaker B: Should we get to news before you move on?
00:48:02.604 - 00:48:03.318, Speaker A: Can't stop.
00:48:03.404 - 00:48:34.546, Speaker B: Can't stop. I think that the world of dows and the new culture around digital organizations will benefit people that advocate for themselves. And so there are already proposals out there to include some missed people in the initial distribution, people that had a bankless badge, but some weird scenarios. And so the final distribution of bank is unknown because it's in the hands of the DAO. Right. The DAO will figure it out. And there have been some people, and I want to try and attempt to change the culture in the DAO already is.
00:48:34.546 - 00:49:02.490, Speaker B: There are some people who come into the Dow and they ping David and Ryan and like, hey, I think, like, it should be like, have no, we have no control. We literally don't have any governance over this thing above and beyond our airdrop. So advocate for yourself. Formulate a proposal, submit it to the Dow, and let the Dow decide. Because again, we can give our opinions about it, but that's all we can give is only our opinions.
00:49:02.910 - 00:49:19.790, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. It's very active, very cool thing. Definitely get plugged in. And advocate for yourself and advocate for the movement, too. Right. It's like, ask not what the Dow can do for you. Ask what you could do for the Dow is what I'll end with.
00:49:19.790 - 00:49:20.286, Speaker A: Here you go.
00:49:20.308 - 00:49:20.686, Speaker B: There we go.
00:49:20.708 - 00:49:20.878, Speaker A: All right.
00:49:20.884 - 00:49:23.146, Speaker B: Now we gave it, now we can end it.
00:49:23.188 - 00:49:49.154, Speaker A: That was a perfect ending. News, ethereum stuff. Let's talk about the first one. DFI is now funding DFI. Let me skip to that. Polygon launches 100 million dollar fund to support DFI adoption. This is Polygon, a successful side chain, layer two solution, getting a ton of defi adoption, and they're now launching an entire fund to build up defi infrastructure.
00:49:49.282 - 00:50:28.710, Speaker B: Yeah, and the Matic token, the token of Polygon, is definitely one of the outperformers in recent times. And so it's really good to see them recirculate some of that wealth back into DeFi. I'm reminded of Kevin Owaki's regenerative Finance Coindesk article, which has been a fantastic mental model of mine, where using one DeFi app makes that deFi app valuable, and then that deFi app invests into the rest of the ecosystem, and new DeFi apps are built, and then those deFi apps are built and those become valuable, and it just recirculates and recirculates and recirculates. And that's how you bootstrap a network and polygon, sticking true to the ethos of regenerative instead of degenerative. If you didn't get that regenerative finance.
00:50:29.370 - 00:50:54.414, Speaker A: Well said. Speaking of Polygon. Polygon is now top ten overall on d five pulse. So they've been added. They are now top ten with coming in starting at pretty impressive job 4 billion. Again, they are somewhere between a side chain and an l two solution. So not completely roll up dependent, but they are definitely culturally invested in the ethereum ecosystem and what it's doing there.
00:50:54.414 - 00:51:12.702, Speaker A: Let's look at this. So my wife actually sent me this homepage. It was the homepage of CNN and Vitalik was on it. And it was. Ethereum's 27 year old co creator is now the world's youngest crypto billionaire. Vitalik a billionaire? I don't think he cares though, David.
00:51:12.846 - 00:51:19.430, Speaker B: I'm willing to bet that he didn't even know. I bet this is news to him.
00:51:19.580 - 00:51:32.762, Speaker A: I just think this is probably one of the billionaires that cares least about having recorded like five or six podcasts with them. You feel like you get to know a person, spend a lot of time talking to them, doesn't care about this at all.
00:51:32.816 - 00:51:46.350, Speaker B: I remember reading Cammy Russo's book the infinite machine, and there was a section about how Vitalik would stay at the cheapest hostels while ether was over $1,000 in 2017.
00:51:46.850 - 00:52:14.086, Speaker A: Yeah, it's cool. But look, this is a milestone, I think for the community as well. Definitely ETH price appreciation is the reason why. Let's talk about this. Speaking of dows, the Maker foundation is returning all of their dev fund holdings to maker as a dao. Is this maker foundation like disintegrating, bowing out, bowing out, saying bye to the community?
00:52:14.188 - 00:52:48.942, Speaker B: Exactly. So the Maker foundation has a pretty large supply of MKR because that's where MKR got minted in the first place. And the Maker foundation, about a year ago committed to dissolving itself in the future as it was ready. And so this is the process of gradual decentralization. And I would like to give a shout out to all the bitcoiners that came on my other podcast, POV cryptopod, and talked about how gradual decentralization is not possible. This is gradual decentralization being completed, being finished. The Maker foundation is dead.
00:52:48.942 - 00:52:52.690, Speaker B: The Maker Dao is alive. The king is dead. Long live the king.
00:52:53.110 - 00:52:57.460, Speaker A: Is that a shout out when you call someone out like you were wrong?
00:52:58.070 - 00:53:02.614, Speaker B: Sure, call out, shout out, whatever. I could list names if you wanted me.
00:53:02.652 - 00:53:19.034, Speaker A: I got it. There you go. Next episode oh, save that for the debrief, David. That's where we named Defi. More disruptive to banks than bitcoin. Who says this? Not the bankless guys. Ing insurance is saying this.
00:53:19.034 - 00:53:39.380, Speaker A: This is a headline from a quote. They released a paper, lessons learned from decentralized finance. A few quotes here. DFI is an integral part of InG's digital asset vision. Wow. Researching DFI, they're spending a lot of time doing this. They're commenting that it has 76 billion locked up.
00:53:39.380 - 00:53:45.646, Speaker A: The best of both worlds is achieved if centralized and decentralized financial services cooperate.
00:53:45.678 - 00:53:46.622, Speaker B: DFI mullet.
00:53:46.766 - 00:53:47.166, Speaker A: Mullet.
00:53:47.198 - 00:53:50.098, Speaker B: DFI mullet. Oh, yes, I heard that one before.
00:53:50.264 - 00:53:54.902, Speaker A: DFI mullet in a corporate exec speak. Analyst speak.
00:53:55.036 - 00:54:39.538, Speaker B: Ryan, earlier I said that DeFi season is coming. Like, this is why. And again, while we have retail aping into things like Dogecoin, we have, in my opinion, from what I can tell in my analysis, we have institutions putting ether on the balance sheet and using ether as a store of value and also investigating DeFi assets. And so I would like to present the possibility that there are strictly different cohorts of buyers between why doge is pumping versus why ETH is pumping. And I think people are also settling in around. People were circling, the institutions were circling around ether, and then they just landed on it recently. Also, institutions are circling around DeFi assets like uni, like wifi, like Aave comp, whatever.
00:54:39.538 - 00:54:47.542, Speaker B: They are circling around DeFi assets, and there's going to be a DFI season that is institutionally driven. And I'm bullish for that, sir.
00:54:47.596 - 00:55:04.554, Speaker A: I accept that proposition. And I'm also bullish, sir. Well said. All right, let's talk about bankless Dow, already making its own news. Two days old, it's already giving 100k away to charity. I said we would inject bankless Dow in every single section of this conversation. Here we are doing it.
00:55:04.554 - 00:55:12.094, Speaker A: I don't know if it's in meme of the week, but here it is. David, what's going on? 100k? How is bankless Dow already donating to charity? What's going on here?
00:55:12.132 - 00:55:40.886, Speaker B: Yeah, if you click that snapshot link, we'll give a little bit of a backstory. So Udi Wertheimer, who famous troll, has publicly stated that he is interested in coming onto a podcast to articulate the vision of BNB as hypersound money, binance, coin, right? And CMS holdings, another famous Twitter account, said that UD should go on bankless. And then ud responded, saying that they're never going to invite me on. And that's true.
00:55:40.908 - 00:55:41.522, Speaker A: He was right.
00:55:41.596 - 00:56:00.346, Speaker B: Probably true. Right? But then CMS holdings said, what if I donate $100,000 to the charity of Bankless's choice and so, I mean, I kind of feel of a personal responsibility, Ryan, to say yes to that, I can't say no to donating $100,000 to charity.
00:56:00.458 - 00:56:05.622, Speaker A: An hour of our time. David, to have a conversation with UdI is definitely worth one hundred k to charity.
00:56:05.706 - 00:56:10.750, Speaker B: Yeah, he's a conversationalist. We can have a conversation.
00:56:10.830 - 00:56:11.570, Speaker A: It'll be fun.
00:56:11.640 - 00:56:12.114, Speaker B: It'll be fun.
00:56:12.152 - 00:56:13.922, Speaker A: I don't know if it'll be useful, but it'll be fun.
00:56:13.976 - 00:56:41.994, Speaker B: It'll be funny. Yeah. What we're doing is instead of bankless LLC saying where the money is going to go, we just handed the rights to that over to the Dow. So the Dow chooses where $100,000 goes. Right now, Gatecoin is in the lead, followed not too far behind by India. Covid relief followed not too far behind by coin center. Let's see, there's only, I think, five or 6% of total outstanding bank voting.
00:56:41.994 - 00:56:53.214, Speaker B: And so this current vote is completely swayable in any direction. I'm kind of bummed that bitcoin mining carbon offset isn't really in the lead, but fair enough. I'll give it to.
00:56:53.252 - 00:56:53.802, Speaker A: That was yours.
00:56:53.866 - 00:56:54.346, Speaker B: That was mine.
00:56:54.378 - 00:56:59.394, Speaker A: Well, you have like a .1% to vote on, sir, so you should do that.
00:56:59.512 - 00:57:11.314, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely should do that. But gitcoin in the lead. So maybe if this comes through, we're donating bankless Dow plus CMS holdings donating $100,000 to Gitcoin.
00:57:11.362 - 00:57:13.990, Speaker A: Cool. How silly is that? Dude, I don't understand.
00:57:14.140 - 00:57:21.574, Speaker B: Okay, dude, what if, though? BNB is actually hypersound money, man. And what if? I think we'll find out.
00:57:21.612 - 00:57:23.194, Speaker A: What if we're wrong? What if we're wrong?
00:57:23.232 - 00:57:24.090, Speaker B: And what if we're wrong?
00:57:24.160 - 00:57:27.002, Speaker A: To be continued. When's that podcast happening? We haven't scheduled it yet.
00:57:27.056 - 00:57:37.322, Speaker B: Well, first we have to come to a head. The bankless Dow needs to pick which charity to donate to. Then we'll forward that off to CMS, and then he'll donate. Schedule time, and then we'll schedule it with Ud.
00:57:37.386 - 00:57:54.974, Speaker A: Yes. Stay tuned, guys. To be continued. All right, ethereum is headed to ten k. Not again. The bankless guy is saying this, but somebody on CNBC saying this. Gary Tan, a famous venture capitalist, angel investor, saying this live on CNBC for the world to hear.
00:57:54.974 - 00:58:07.470, Speaker A: He said a few things. Eth going to ten k. He said ETH is ultrasound money. Wow, David, two months from the creation of ultrasound money. Genesis of ultrasound.
00:58:07.570 - 00:58:13.418, Speaker B: It wasn't the creation. The creation happened in September of 2020, but it was really started.
00:58:13.504 - 00:58:14.758, Speaker A: The articulation.
00:58:14.934 - 00:58:16.422, Speaker B: The heavy, heavy.
00:58:16.566 - 00:58:17.382, Speaker A: Justin Drake.
00:58:17.446 - 00:58:18.060, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:58:19.710 - 00:58:32.126, Speaker A: So, dude, look, we said before, social layer, meme layer, it propagates up here. It's propagating up to traditional finance. CNBC, Gary Tan, now sporting ultrasound money. Kind of fun.
00:58:32.228 - 00:58:32.910, Speaker B: Yep.
00:58:33.750 - 00:59:03.930, Speaker A: All right, let's talk bitcoin. This is a big one. This is bigger than bitcoin. We could have led with this. Us banks are allowing bitcoin trading in 2021, says Ny Dig execs. Ny dig? Is that how you say that? Ny dig? I'm not sure, but new digital investment group has inked a partnership with fintech Fidelity. Fidelity has been in crypto for a long time, since like 2015, 2016, doing a lot in the space.
00:59:03.930 - 00:59:51.802, Speaker A: That's Fidelity, the investment company. And now Ny Dig is going to be signing on a whole bunch of banks, I believe, to be able to actually buy and sell crypto assets. In particular is David. I think this is the banks wanting a piece of this, the banks not knowing how to custody crypto assets, not knowing what to do with it, and this agency, NYdig, helping out with that, with a partnership with Fidelity. So pretty soon, look, this is something we predicted. When Coinbase goes public, all of the other banks are going to look at their financial statements. The SEC, they're going to look at all those financial statements and start salivating and being like, oh, my God, this is possible.
00:59:51.802 - 01:00:03.646, Speaker A: Where's our cut? And this is them coming back and trying to get their cut of crypto. And so you'll basically have the ability to buy and sell crypto at your local bank. That's what this leads to.
01:00:03.748 - 01:00:38.546, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a typo in this article where they say, new digital investment group is actually New York digital Investment group. The way that this works is that Nydig takes care of the trading and custody, and they just have APIs to apparently hundreds of banks. And so all this is, from what I can tell, an API integration. If you want to hear a better explanation of this, listen to NLW's podcast with somebody actually from Nidig, explain this. But apparently, very simple integration, where they just put in an API, and then all of a sudden, next to your USD balance in your bank account, you have a bitcoin balance.
01:00:38.738 - 01:01:00.570, Speaker A: That's so hard for me to fathom, to even picture that world. But that's what's going, and it's because of the profit incentive for banks to get aboard this. All right, let's talk more about profit incentives. Nfts. There's a profit incentive in nfts as well. We had Gary Vee on the podcast. He's doing some stuff with nfts, and he's just launched vfriends, which is his take on nfts.
01:01:00.570 - 01:01:38.042, Speaker A: There's some cool features here, I think, that we covered in our episode with him earlier in the week. But I guess a few takeaways. One, I think this onboards more people to Ethereum wallets. So in order to get these nfts, you have to have an ETH address. So it's crypto native from that perspective, which I like. You're also buying these nfts with ETH, which is kind of cool, too. So again, onboarding more people, this is not necessarily something for me, not necessarily something for you, but it is something that his community is interested in, and we'll see how this goes after he launches it.
01:01:38.096 - 01:02:15.606, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think that's really actually the big takeaway with Gary Vee and his nfts with crypto punks or Euler beats or all the other more general. Like anyone who's interested in nfts can start to speculate on the cool NFT. These Gary Vee nfts are really just for Gary Vee and his fans. It's kind of more of, not formally but informally, a closed ecosystem. Because if you don't care about Gary Vee, then you're not going to care about his nfts. But if you do care about Gary Vee, then you probably are really going to be interested in his nfts. And these nfts aren't just like some weird drawing that you saw on screen.
01:02:15.606 - 01:02:34.458, Speaker B: It's not just some thing that Gary drew. They're actually redeemable for some sort of time with Gary. And so they're like hangout with Gary collateralized nfts, right? Like dinner deer. He just drew a random picture of a deer. Now it's an NFT. And if you buy this NFT, you get to have dinner with Gary. And Gary has a massive fan base.
01:02:34.458 - 01:03:01.894, Speaker B: And if you are not in that fan base and you probably don't care, but if you are in that fan base, then you are probably downloading metamask, loading it up with ether, and then buying a dinner deer. NfT credit tip of the hat to Gary. Could have done this on Salana, could have done this on some other chain. No, he did it on an ethereum l one with ether, not with fiat on top shots. He's doing it right. He's doing it right.
01:03:01.932 - 01:03:12.394, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. And if you think this is stupid, that's okay. It's not for you. My wife thinks crypto punks are stupid and I'm never going to explain why they're actually valuable to her.
01:03:12.432 - 01:03:12.634, Speaker B: Right.
01:03:12.672 - 01:03:42.482, Speaker A: It's just not for your community, not for your culture. But the fact that you could do these for your community is pretty cool. David, let's go on. More NFT news. Coinbase is partnering with Sotheby's, which is, I believe, a large art auction group to announce a collaboration with Coinbase commerce so that people at Sotheby's can buy a banksy image with crypto. So bitcoin and ether can be used to buy Banksy. Right now, bitcoin and ether's money.
01:03:42.482 - 01:03:59.746, Speaker A: Wow, real world Banksy. You can use it for that now. I guess it's becoming more money like. David, this is cool too. Upshot has just announced that they've raised $7.3 million. I think of upshot, what they're trying to do is be sort of the zillow for nfts, where they give you like a price estimate for all of these NFts.
01:03:59.746 - 01:04:06.474, Speaker A: There's actually an opportunity for bankless badge holders here that we can get to. But what's your take on what upshot is trying to do?
01:04:06.592 - 01:04:41.330, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's kind of like I'm going to kind of butcher this explanation, but then I'm going to get back to how it's actually accurate. So think of like swiping left or swiping right on nfts, or kind of like hot or not, right. So you're presented with two nfts and you just pick the one that you like the most. And this is an NFT appraisal platform. And so with more and more data, everyone remembers in the social dilemma of the social network, where Mark Zuckerberg did that hot or not thing with college students on campus. Very controversial. Good thing nfts don't have emotions.
01:04:41.330 - 01:05:27.898, Speaker B: And so you can just pick your favorite NFT. And with more and more and more data of more and more and more people's inputs, we can actually come to some sort of emergent pricing or emergent appraisal for the value of nfts. And so as an appraiser, you are incentivized to pick the same NFT that everyone else is going to pick. And you have to do a little bit of due diligence, not only looking at it and seeing if you like it or not, but looking at how much supply there is, previous trade history, who made it. And so it's a two sided marketplace. People who want to earn money appraising nfts and people who want to pay to have their NFT appraised. And then there's also a wisdom of the crowds mechanism where if you pick the other things that other people pick, then you get rewarded, outsized.
01:05:27.898 - 01:05:41.420, Speaker B: And at the end of the day, art is just valued as how much other people value it. And so this is a pretty cool NFT appraisal platform again already. Beta access available to bankless badge holders and bankless badge holders only.
01:05:41.950 - 01:06:01.406, Speaker A: Yeah. So if you have a badge right now, you can log on to app upshot IO. If you connect your badge with metamask, you should be able to access the interface and become an appraiser and start earning for appraising these nfts. Super cool protocol. Excited to see where that goes. David. We'll end the NFT section on this.
01:06:01.406 - 01:06:09.906, Speaker A: Crypto punks is now being valued at $1 billion USDC. Is this triple comic club or what, man?
01:06:10.008 - 01:06:12.066, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead.
01:06:12.248 - 01:06:22.566, Speaker A: Yeah, dude, an NFT that is worth $3 billion in NFT market. That blows my mind. Does it feel frothy though?
01:06:22.668 - 01:06:36.666, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's inflated in the same way I was talking about how the doge market cap is inflated because so many people have lost doge, so many people have lost crypto punks, right? And so I think over 50% and it could be even higher than that.
01:06:36.768 - 01:06:39.242, Speaker A: Has to be heartbreaking, right? Imagine that.
01:06:39.296 - 01:06:54.530, Speaker B: There's a lot of wallets that just because they were free to claim. And so back in 2016 when they were released where gas was like below one guay, people would be like, oh, I'll take 1000 crypto punks and then I'll throw away my wallet and that's where we are today.
01:06:54.680 - 01:06:59.902, Speaker A: And then it turned into the value of a house. Right, sorry, that's sad.
01:06:59.966 - 01:07:02.660, Speaker B: A more than reasonably sized house, I might add.
01:07:03.430 - 01:07:18.774, Speaker A: Crazy. All right, let's get to a few others before we leave. Goldman Sachs is leading a $15 million series b into a round for coin metrics. Coin metrics is super cool. Great data site for crypto. Doing fantastic work. Our friend Nick Carter over there.
01:07:18.774 - 01:07:28.410, Speaker A: And this is Goldman Sachs leading the round. So like, big financial institutions getting involved in crypto. Really cool, really bullish. Anything more you want to say there?
01:07:28.480 - 01:07:46.820, Speaker B: Yeah, top tier data analytics platform with a seed round from a top tier. I mean, I'm not going to say nice things about a bank, but as far as banks got programmed, like really high up there in tier status. And so tip of the hat for coin metrics. And this illustrates just the value of good data in this place.
01:07:47.270 - 01:08:12.790, Speaker A: I'm going to blaze through these because this is all the same theme, which is traditional bank uptick of crypto. Here's another one. S and P, Dow Jones famous index. Of course, they're launching a bitcoin and ethereum indices in 2017. This would have been huge news this week. It barely is a blip on Crypto's radar, but it is huge news. PayPal has held exploratory talks about launching a stablecoin.
01:08:12.790 - 01:08:22.270, Speaker A: Dude, the rumor mill keeps swirling. PayPal is absolutely doing something in the stablecoin space. So is visa. I wouldn't be surprised if they come up with something this year.
01:08:22.340 - 01:08:27.582, Speaker B: PayPal has the largest Defi mullet, or at least it will have the largest defi mullet. That's my.
01:08:27.636 - 01:08:42.862, Speaker A: The largest, dankest, nastiest, greasiest defi mullet imaginable. That's what David's predicting. All right, here's something else, David. Galaxy Digital is acquiring bitco. Bitco, of course, is a very large crypto custodian.
01:08:42.926 - 01:08:46.418, Speaker B: Galaxy Digital premier crypto custodian, definitely.
01:08:46.504 - 01:09:04.730, Speaker A: They are one of the go to's. Besides, like Coinbase and a few others, they're definitely the go to. Galaxy Digital is a large crypto fund of sorts. They're acquiring them for $1.2 billion. I'm not sure what Galaxy's intentions are, but it feels like they're planning to maybe flip them to another acquirer. That's what I would guess, but have no idea what their intents are.
01:09:04.730 - 01:09:20.414, Speaker A: Interesting activity nonetheless. Let's get to the next. This, look, we'll park on this for just a second because we talked about it in the markets. Elon Musk had an SNL appearance Saturday Night Live. Of course. Did he say something about Dogecoin? He must have.
01:09:20.452 - 01:09:26.894, Speaker B: Wait, no, he's going to have a Saturday Night Live appearance on Saturday because it's live, right? It hasn't already happened yet.
01:09:26.932 - 01:09:28.130, Speaker A: Of course. Yeah, of course.
01:09:28.200 - 01:09:33.614, Speaker B: And so he's been shilling how he is the doge father and he's going to shill the doge father.
01:09:33.662 - 01:09:34.754, Speaker A: Is that really what he says?
01:09:34.792 - 01:09:35.906, Speaker B: That's what he's been saying.
01:09:36.008 - 01:09:37.886, Speaker A: I don't have time in my life right now for Elon.
01:09:37.998 - 01:09:38.850, Speaker B: I haven't been.
01:09:39.000 - 01:09:39.362, Speaker A: Sorry.
01:09:39.416 - 01:09:43.026, Speaker B: What you could be doing. I mean, he bought bitcoin and put it on the balance sheet for Tesla.
01:09:43.058 - 01:09:46.850, Speaker A: So I guess, dude, he's launching rockets and making space age cars.
01:09:46.930 - 01:09:49.690, Speaker B: Anyone making a farce out of my industry, Brian.
01:09:50.910 - 01:09:53.114, Speaker A: Okay, well, I'm sorry.
01:09:53.232 - 01:10:00.006, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, he's a big memester, and he's apparently going to be shilling doge really hard on SNL this Saturday.
01:10:00.038 - 01:10:02.462, Speaker A: How do people know? Oh, because Elon said he would.
01:10:02.516 - 01:10:10.110, Speaker B: Because Elon's been tweeting about it. Because that's where the dogefather meme came from. Why? I don't know. He's a meme lord.
01:10:11.090 - 01:10:28.254, Speaker A: So what I don't understand is a lot of people who text me asking about dogecoin say things like, yeah, elon's involved in this. Elon thinks it's a big deal, and that therefore gives it legitimacy, which is why I worry. Again, low confidence meme, low conviction meme is why I worry about dogecoin.
01:10:28.302 - 01:10:32.178, Speaker B: Should we send bank tokens? So Elon's part of the bank Dow.
01:10:32.274 - 01:10:46.282, Speaker A: We should send Elon the bankless podcast, and he should listen to it to understand this industry a bit more. I know Elon, very smart dude, understands a lot of things, but I don't know why he's doing this.
01:10:46.336 - 01:10:47.846, Speaker B: Yeah, come on, Elon.
01:10:47.878 - 01:10:55.134, Speaker A: All right, David. A 16 z is raising another fund, as much as $1 billion, for a new crypto fund. What's your comment here?
01:10:55.252 - 01:11:12.100, Speaker B: Yeah, a 16 z always pioneering the charge into crypto. $1 billion going into this industry. Is that going into crypto assets? Is that going into seed investments? Probably a little bit of everything. But overall, our industry is about to get $1 billion better.
01:11:12.630 - 01:11:20.582, Speaker A: All right, how finny would be 65 earlier this week. Rest in peace. How finny 65th birthday. What do you want to say about this?
01:11:20.716 - 01:11:27.890, Speaker B: Possibly Satoshi would have died in 2014 due to ALS, a true cipher punk. Happy birthday, halfinny.
01:11:28.050 - 01:11:37.162, Speaker A: Yeah, super cool, David. We're going to get to takes in just a minute. And don't forget the meme of the week. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:11:37.296 - 01:12:13.446, Speaker B: Synthetix is Ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol. What does that mean? Synthetix is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets, which are assets that are priced via an oracle. Rather than bids or asks, traders can use the Quinta exchange, which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics. Traders on quinta can trade synthetic tokens like SBTC s oil or SDFI. Because quinta is powered by synthetix, traders experience zero slippage on their trades. No, I didn't mean low slippage. I meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform.
01:12:13.446 - 01:12:50.690, Speaker B: No slippage on your trades. You can also easily short assets with ISins, which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset. Synthetix isn't just for traders. Developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets. Or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects. If you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform not found in the legacy world, check out Quinta IO. If you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral, go to wwW synthetics IO, where you can stake your SNX or ETH and earn fees from synthetix.
01:12:51.670 - 01:13:13.270, Speaker A: Metamask is your go to wallet for the bankless journey. If you're going bankless, you need metamask, period. Browser and mobile get them both. This is your tool to unlock the world of defi. Here's my favorite part. Now you can swap tokens directly in metamask with a single swipe. This has got to be the easiest way to trade Ethereum tokens.
01:13:13.270 - 01:13:41.278, Speaker A: Choose a token, you own a token to exchange it with. Get your quotes. If you like what you see, you hit swap. That's it. What makes swap so useful is what happens behind the scenes. It compares dexs, aggregators and market makers to find you the best price with the lowest network fee and the least slippage. This means you can swap a wider range of tokens, and swaps can even automatically split up your trade to give you access to better liquidity.
01:13:41.278 - 01:14:01.450, Speaker A: You don't even have to think about it. Try it out. Download metamask for desktop or mobile now at Metamask IO and start swapping. All right, guys, we are back with some hot takes for the week. Let's go to the first David Ethereum is green. What's the take behind this?
01:14:01.520 - 01:14:38.630, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is a post made by status app that talking all about how exactly green Ethereum is. And I think I'm going to lead with the punchline, actually, and say that if you want to be green, you don't turn your energy consumption into renewable resources, you consume less. I mean, you can do both. You can do both. But consuming less is actually the greenest path forward. Rather than just reorganizing how you consume resources, if you can just stop consuming resources, you don't actually have to find renewable resources to consume. You can just stop consuming resources at all.
01:14:38.630 - 01:14:53.580, Speaker B: And so what status is showing in this blog post is that ethereum is green because it actually just doesn't consume anything. And so under a proof of stake paradigm, it is 99% more efficient in energy consumption than proof of work.
01:14:53.950 - 01:15:06.366, Speaker A: Dude, I just feel like this is checkmate to the proof of work argument, basically, right? Or the environmental impact of proof of work. It's basically like, yeah, the answer is we turn it off.
01:15:06.468 - 01:15:06.926, Speaker B: Right?
01:15:07.028 - 01:15:50.618, Speaker A: We stop doing it. It's not this convoluted answer of how much energy is bitcoin or ethereum proof of work using and how much of that is renewable versus non renewable, and how much of it is, like, net new innovation versus not. The answer is we just turn it off. And even if you don't care about any of this, that is a better narrative to go mainstream with. And a better narrative when your friend asks you about crypto's environmental impact, or the media announces you about how much energy crypto is using on a given day, you just have to say, like, none. Zero. Anyway, we talked about this before, but I just feel like that's a checkmate answer.
01:15:50.618 - 01:15:57.694, Speaker A: And Ethereum, to be fair, can't say that yet until the merge, right? Nine months from now, twelve months from now.
01:15:57.732 - 01:16:23.266, Speaker B: And I see the same. I saw like three headlines this week. Bentley is committing to produce only electric cars by 2030. X car manufacturer committing to only electric cars by x date. The move towards electric feels like also the move towards proof of stake. Like, proof of stake is just like the most efficient, green, minimally consumptive thing. And proof of work feels like a gas guzzler.
01:16:23.266 - 01:16:43.630, Speaker B: It feels like a Hummer. It feels like a tank. And that's kind of the same ethos of protecting bitcoin is like, well, we will just pile on armor after armor after armor. Whereas proof of stake is like, we'll just be really agile and lean. And I think the society, instead of wanting a big, hunking gas guzzler, they want something agile and lean.
01:16:44.130 - 01:17:09.302, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. All right, let's talk about the next article or take from the week. And this is a take by Charlie Munger, successful Berkshire Hathaway investor. He and Warren Buffett, of course, very rich individuals. Great investment advice, too, both these guys. But bitcoin success is disgusting is what Charlie Munger said this week. He's got some other lines here.
01:17:09.302 - 01:17:45.586, Speaker A: Of course, I hate the bitcoin success, Munger said. I don't welcome a currency that's so useful to kidnappers and extortionists and so forth. Nor do I like shuffling out a few extra billions and billions of dollars to somebody who just invented a new financial product out of thin air. Peak, peak, coke, okay, I'm going to keep reading this because it's great. I think I should say modestly that I think the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization. David Hoffman is what we're doing contrary to the interests of civilization, my friend.
01:17:45.688 - 01:18:00.920, Speaker B: No, I don't feel that contrary to Charlie Munger and his idea of his civilization. It's just he's very aware that bitcoin is popping his bubble and no one else's. And he sounds really insecure about who he is and his position in the world.
01:18:01.370 - 01:18:36.034, Speaker A: Yeah, it sounds pretty angry about it. And here's the bottom line. I don't think crypto is for Munger. He's not going to have to deal with the problems that younger generations are dealing with as a result of Charlie Munger's success. Again, fantastic investor, but has done it on the know, the whole fiat money printer pumping stock prices and all of these things. Of course he's made great decisions from an investment perspective, but he's also benefited from the status quo banking system. Right.
01:18:36.034 - 01:18:40.706, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's not for him, is what I would say, too, when we.
01:18:40.728 - 01:18:48.710, Speaker B: Talk about the creative destruction that this industry brings. This is the part that is the destruction part. Goodbye, Charlie.
01:18:50.570 - 01:18:51.320, Speaker A: Yes.
01:18:52.330 - 01:18:55.222, Speaker B: Was that the actual take? I don't know.
01:18:55.276 - 01:19:08.486, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know if that was the actual take, but there's something there for sure. All right, David, let's do this take, man. Really good. Eva Balin at $3. It was just a joke. Talking about Ether here. At $30, it was a good hobby.
01:19:08.486 - 01:19:17.182, Speaker A: At 300, it was a group of builders. At 3000, it's what? It's a revolution. Talking about the price of ether. Really cool take here.
01:19:17.236 - 01:19:29.554, Speaker B: Yeah, there's just something to say that we can talk about the revolution, but until it actually shows up in the market value of these assets, then it's only talk when it's here in the number, you can say that the revolution's finally here.
01:19:29.752 - 01:19:51.382, Speaker A: It's showing up eth price go up is economic strength, is economic security, is legitimacy. David, let's go to our friend Rob Payone, who we had on the podcast. This guy recruits for positions in crypto, for jobs in crypto. He helps people find a job in crypto. Do you want to read this takeout and then give your comments?
01:19:51.446 - 01:20:10.650, Speaker B: Yeah, he wrote entirely long nine tweet, long thread. So the whole thing is worth reading, but I'm just going to read number nine. It actually goes to ten. He goes long thread short. If you love the crypto industry and you want a job here? Go for it. Is there career risk? Yes. But everything in life has risk.
01:20:10.650 - 01:20:47.930, Speaker B: Sitting in a cubicle at a big bank or big four, droning away for the next 20 years is also a risk. If you want it, go get it. Hell yeah, Bobby. And I remember in 2018, after I went to East Denver, which was, like, the impetus for me to get into this industry, I flew home and reflected on the plane ride home, and it's like, well, am I seriously about to go home and study for the gre so I could get into school? What's the point? Am I seriously going to miss this? Whatever the hell this. I don't even know what this is, but I'm seriously going to miss it. Absolutely not. I am not risking missing ethereum over the next three years.
01:20:47.930 - 01:21:05.066, Speaker B: Right? I'm not waiting for the next bull market if this one's ending. And then you know what I did. Ryan, what'd you do? I used a bunch of defi apps. I used uniswap. Then I got the uni airdrop. So I didn't miss out on that risk. I learned how to use all these things, started a podcast.
01:21:05.066 - 01:21:10.530, Speaker B: I would have, thank God I didn't risk not doing all of those things, because it pays to be in DFI.
01:21:11.350 - 01:21:24.600, Speaker A: David's profile shot, if you know this. They found out on April 1, though, when we published the joke post the prank, his profile shot is still him standing in front of a Wells Fargo for a job interview. Am I right about that?
01:21:25.530 - 01:21:29.158, Speaker B: One of my first days on the job, but it was actually at a crypto job.
01:21:29.324 - 01:21:51.786, Speaker A: Oh, my God. That's funny, though. Yeah, I think, great bit of advice here. Drop out of university and join a. Like, I'm only half kidding about that. We talked about this on the Josh Rosenthal episode, which, by the way, I listened to a second time this week because it was so good. That's the crypto renaissance episode.
01:21:51.786 - 01:22:32.170, Speaker A: And he talks about this, and in his action items, where he kind of summed up the last thousand years of history, he said, the place you don't want to be at this juncture in history is a part of the old institutional guard because that's not going to accelerate the path. So you can't trust the path in the career opportunities that the existing institutions have set out for you. Right. You have to find something new. You have to start exploring this new frontier, and you have to position yourself for the change that is coming about. And I think that's good advice being echoed by Rob in this thread here.
01:22:32.240 - 01:22:36.414, Speaker B: Absolutely. Inside of a revolution. The risk is staying the same.
01:22:36.612 - 01:22:39.822, Speaker A: All right, David, it's time. What are you excited about this week, my friend?
01:22:39.876 - 01:22:41.760, Speaker B: You ready to see it? Because it's a show and tell.
01:22:42.290 - 01:22:43.614, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm ready to see it.
01:22:43.652 - 01:22:45.982, Speaker B: Here we go. Look at this piece of uniswap.
01:22:46.046 - 01:22:47.042, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
01:22:47.176 - 01:22:47.522, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:22:47.576 - 01:22:47.986, Speaker A: Wow.
01:22:48.088 - 01:23:00.210, Speaker B: Check that out. Okay, so if I can uniswap, uniswap, zoom this in even more, you can actually start to see some pretty cool stuff in there. There's a little bit of Easter eggs going on here, and I think. I hope this isn't a mirror image.
01:23:00.290 - 01:23:00.534, Speaker A: Okay.
01:23:00.572 - 01:23:05.510, Speaker B: But here Eth is money is right there.
01:23:05.580 - 01:23:05.958, Speaker A: What?
01:23:06.044 - 01:23:06.680, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:23:07.790 - 01:23:10.358, Speaker A: Wait, I'm going to see that. Can you bring that closer?
01:23:10.534 - 01:23:11.820, Speaker B: It's kind of hard.
01:23:12.190 - 01:23:13.098, Speaker A: I see it.
01:23:13.184 - 01:23:18.010, Speaker B: Yeah, I see it. Here's welcome. Here's welcome.
01:23:18.080 - 01:23:18.602, Speaker A: Wow.
01:23:18.736 - 01:23:24.974, Speaker B: If you stare closer, you can see over there is better together. Better together.
01:23:25.172 - 01:23:25.630, Speaker A: Wow.
01:23:25.700 - 01:23:45.042, Speaker B: And so there's just a bunch of really positive, ethereum focused words written all over this uniswap logo, but in different languages. Many different languages. There's Hindi in there, there's Arabic, there's English, and there's welcome. Bienvenido. Etha's money.
01:23:45.176 - 01:23:46.242, Speaker A: Where did you find this?
01:23:46.296 - 01:24:06.310, Speaker B: Yeah, so I met up with this guy in Twitter, dms, usama, kayat. I hope I pronounced that name right. I probably didn't. And I saw him post something similar, and I was, yo, like, can I have that? And then he said, no, I want to make you a better one. So he made me a better one, commissioned it, and then he sent it to me. And so now I'm going to get it framed and put it up on my wall.
01:24:06.460 - 01:24:11.962, Speaker A: That is awesome. Is this an NFT, or is this, like, just old school traditional art? No, nft.
01:24:12.026 - 01:24:14.586, Speaker B: Traditional art. Pre NFt. NfTs.
01:24:14.778 - 01:24:23.994, Speaker A: That's awesome. But it is representative of crypto culture, crypto meme culture, and uniswap. Man, good week to get that, too. Did you receive it on uniswap launch.
01:24:24.042 - 01:24:27.282, Speaker B: Day, or is it a couple days before? I've had it for a couple of days now. Yeah.
01:24:27.416 - 01:24:29.282, Speaker A: That is awesome, man. Very cool.
01:24:29.336 - 01:24:32.660, Speaker B: So thank you so much. You saw really, really cool present.
01:24:33.110 - 01:24:34.674, Speaker A: Bunch of creators in this community.
01:24:34.792 - 01:24:37.060, Speaker B: Absolutely. Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:24:37.510 - 01:24:39.022, Speaker A: I got to say, bankless dao.
01:24:39.086 - 01:24:40.040, Speaker B: One more time.
01:24:40.410 - 01:25:19.700, Speaker A: Just one more time. I told you we'd fit it in every section. I think we've talked about it at length, but just to see the amount of experimentation, the community kind of rally around the movement gives me hope that we have started something here that is much bigger than ourselves and that can continue to carry crypto forward under its value set, which is like, this is a technology about coordination. This is a technology about self sovereignty. This is a technology that's going to make the world a better place. And if those values are instilled in any way in this movement, it's just the most exciting thing ever. It's like, that's my answer for every single week after this.
01:25:19.700 - 01:25:25.490, Speaker A: If I could give the same answer and it was still interesting, but there you go. That's what I'm excited about.
01:25:25.560 - 01:25:33.958, Speaker B: Yeah. What I'm optimistic about is I think we also have found the right people. The right people have found their way into the bankless Dow, and we'll continue to.
01:25:34.044 - 01:25:41.642, Speaker A: David, let's get to you. Meme of the week. All right, this is one from our friend Chris Berninski. Okay, explain this one.
01:25:41.776 - 01:25:49.514, Speaker B: So this is the classic boyfriend looking back at a girl in a red dress while his girlfriend is upset at him for doing so.
01:25:49.552 - 01:25:50.250, Speaker A: You know the one.
01:25:50.320 - 01:26:10.210, Speaker B: You know the one. The boyfriend is the institutions. The upset girlfriend is BTC, and the girl in the red dress is Eth. Our eth Maxis hats are definitely on on this episode, but it's also reflected in reality in the markets. And so, yeah, awesome meme, Chris. You know how to meme for sure.
01:26:10.360 - 01:26:23.826, Speaker A: Yeah. Well done. Not just a fantastic investor and explainer, he actually wrote one of the books that got me really excited about crypto. Crypto assets. Fantastic book. I think still holds up in a lot of ways. I hope he writes a second edition.
01:26:23.826 - 01:26:39.338, Speaker A: And now he's talented at meming. Some people get all the gifts. He's got everything, man. Chris Rininsky, hopefully we'll have you back on the podcast again. That episode that we did last summer with him was fantastic as well. David, anything else before we sign off for the week?
01:26:39.504 - 01:26:41.210, Speaker B: Long live bankless Dow.
01:26:41.790 - 01:26:51.962, Speaker A: There you go, guys. Eth is risky. Bitcoin is risky. Defi is risky. You could lose what you put in. But if you're hanging here, you are on the journey with us. This is the bankless journey.
