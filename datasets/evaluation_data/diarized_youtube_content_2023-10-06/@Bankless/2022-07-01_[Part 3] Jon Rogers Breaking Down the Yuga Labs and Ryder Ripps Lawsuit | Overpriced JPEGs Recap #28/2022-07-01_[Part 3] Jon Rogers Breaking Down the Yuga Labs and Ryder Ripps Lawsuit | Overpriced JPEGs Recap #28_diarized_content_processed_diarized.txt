00:00:05.210 - 00:00:30.562, Speaker A: Everyone, GM. GM. Welcome back to the second part of the second part of the two part series. I don't know, I've fully lost track of what we're doing here. I guess this is part three. Welcome back. This is an episode where John and I just break down what is happening with Yuga Labs right now and their lawsuit against Ryder rips and and the Rider Ape Rips board, Ape Yacht Club and the accusations going around about them being Nazis.
00:00:30.562 - 00:00:39.138, Speaker A: And we give all of our thoughts. I get a little heated, so forgive me and let me know what you think on Twitter. I'm sure I know lots of you have comments.
00:00:39.234 - 00:01:14.626, Speaker B: There is a brand new staking feature in the Ledger live app today.

So check it out at Metamask.
00:02:00.094 - 00:02:32.380, Speaker A: IO buyphencrypto the Yuga Labs saga, there's maybe three things to talk about here. There is other side, actually, they made this big other side announcement. So if we're talking about Yuga labs, I feel like we have to just address the fact that on, I believe it's July 16, July 19. They've said that the first look at the other side metaverse game, I guess that they're building out is going to be revealed. They said, like the journey will begin. The first part of the journey begins. So they're moving ahead.
00:02:32.380 - 00:03:03.640, Speaker A: Want to just start with that? I don't think too much has to be said there. Then the other two pieces are this, you know, Philly on board Ape Nazi Club, YouTube video and those allegations, and then the lawsuit which is connected to those allegations, though actually also somewhat separate. So I know you are going to do a phenomenal job really talking us through this lawsuit. I would like to give my two cent on this YouTube video. Do you want to kick us off or do you want me to rant to you about this?
00:03:04.330 - 00:04:00.454, Speaker C: You know, I'll kick us off because I know you have a lot of thoughts on the YouTube video specifically. We are very much guilty of burying the lead when it comes to Yuga. In the last recap podcast we did, it was the big news coming in beginning the week, timed perfectly on the Sunday night before the event began. So what happened was a YouTuber going by the handle of Fillian posted a video essentially documenting all of the ways in which Yuga Labs'board apes could be inspired by or dog whistling. And that's the key word here, is dog whistling to white supremacist groups, Aryan Brotherhood type groups. And all of the research was based on a website that Ryder Rips had created called Gordon Goner. I think it was gordongoner.com.
00:04:00.454 - 00:04:39.606, Speaker C: Even though Fillian does claim, and Ryder Rips has tweeted this out, that there's no affiliation between the two whatsoever. It's just one created the research, quote unquote, research, and the other created a documentary inspired by that research. It kind of started NFT NYC off with some explosive allegations. And I'll kind of wrap this, my part of this up is saying that when I first watched it, and this was coming right off of the scandal, and I'll call it a scandal, of what happened with the announcement of Nathan to become the brand lead for crypto punks. So what happened is Yuka Labs had.
00:04:39.628 - 00:04:43.026, Speaker A: Announced that they were going to bring on Noah Davis.
00:04:43.138 - 00:05:01.910, Speaker C: Noah Davis, sorry. Thank you for correcting me on that. So there was an insider trading. We talked about that in our recap episode. So they had that scandal, and right on the heels of that, this documentary gets posted. So it was kind of a bad week for Yuga to begin with. My initial take because I was already in a bad mindset around Yuga.
00:05:01.910 - 00:05:27.158, Speaker C: When I saw it was like, wow, they really got something here. They got them. And as I spent some more time sitting with it and thinking about it, a lot of holes began to kind of come in my mind about what is this? It's really stretching a lot of similarities, a lot of innuendo. So I began to really doubt it at that point. But I was not in the best yuga mindset when the week began, when this hit. So what was your take on it?
00:05:27.324 - 00:06:18.318, Speaker A: I think this is such horseshit. I think you set this up well, because it's alleging their Aryan Brotherhood and Nazi and white supremacist. And the point is they are pulling from the canon of all evil things to say that board apes has a similarity to that. And I think that there was an input magazine article that covered this, actually, from a month ago or a couple months ago, not even in this most recent Phillyon episode. And they interviewed somebody who's with the Anti Defamation League, the ADL, which is a know, anti anti Semitism group and tracks hate groups. And really this is what they do professionally, is to monitor these things. And he put it really well.
00:06:18.318 - 00:06:44.746, Speaker A: The guy they interviewed in this article, I'm going to pull this quote up. He said, if you're an extremist, you have a set ideology. You don't dabble in different kinds. And that's the thing that's so strange is they're just like, oh, well, they're referencing this random number that means something to this hate group. And they reference this thing that could be the year that somebody was in a Nazi prison. So I'm like, I've gone crazy. And I watched the video and was like, this seems ridiculous to me.
00:06:44.746 - 00:07:21.186, Speaker A: And like, complete horseshit. And then I rewatched the video and took notes on every allegation they made. And every time it's like, they're like, oh, they use gwenon and makaka or whatever, like, they use two monkeys. And these monkeys get brought up in four chan. And you're like, if you google any monkey, if you search four chan for any monkey name, it's used in a racist way. They don't think about, it's like the number. They use the number, I forget the number 14 or there's 1818 in the board ape thing.
00:07:21.186 - 00:08:00.950, Speaker A: And you're like, there are so many numbers that actually, I was looking up, what are the numbers that have racist symbolism and it's like 88 and it's 14 and it's 311, and it's 37 again, you could find this for so many things. And the Kawabunga. I mean, the most ridiculous one to me was they were like, one of the founder's girlfriends had Kawabunga in her Instagram handle, and this was one of the ones that yuga labs addressed directly. She's Mexican American, and she likes Mutant Ninja turtles. Like, kawabunga is just an expression that people use. And, I mean, there was even one. The anti defamation league guy was like, I literally had to google this reference.
00:08:00.950 - 00:08:17.718, Speaker A: Which one was it? There was, like, some reference that they were like, this is a common. Oh, the Kaliyuga. The surfing. The Kaliyuga. They were like, yeah, that's, like, this common alt right thing. And the ADL guy was like, I have studied white supremacy for 27 years, and I had to look this up. This is not, like, a super common reference.
00:08:17.718 - 00:08:46.500, Speaker A: They were like, ape hands is a reference to some french king who would chop off the hands of congolese Belgium. And I'm like, Belgium? And then you Google, I searched ape hands in four chan. Nothing like that comes up. This is like some crowdfunded knowledge pool. Again. They're drawing on the canon of all evil things that have ever happened. So you have some person out there who happens to know that ape hands were, what, Belgians chopped off congolese hands, and it's like, that's what they're referencing here.
00:08:46.500 - 00:09:22.602, Speaker A: I honestly find the thing completely absurd. Now, here's the only compelling pieces of evidence, in my opinion. I think it's been a big miss on Ugolab's part that they haven't just come out and denounced white supremacy, and, like, that just feels like an unforced error. I don't believe they're white supremacists or Nazis at all. I don't believe they've taken inspiration from white supremacists or Nazis at all. They've come out with their own statement calling it absurd in a couple of different ways and kind of debunking some of this, but I do think it's, like, just denounce it. I don't need you to apologize, because I don't think they have anything to apologize for, and I don't need that headline like, they apologize for their accidentally racist imagery.
00:09:22.602 - 00:09:59.610, Speaker A: But I would like them to just be like, we absolutely denounce Nazism and white supremacy in all ways, and not doing that feels weird. And I also think some of their traits are cringey and weird and probably just in and of themselves shouldn't exist. And I don't know to what extent to put that at the feet of the founders and to what extent to put that at the feet of designers because they worked with design partners to create these traits. Now, of course, they had final say, but clearly there are some traits like the japanese head band and some of the fez, like some of these things I think are the prussian hat.
00:10:00.510 - 00:10:14.526, Speaker C: I have a couple of things there. First of all, Fillian, who created this video, this video starts off with, you don't know four chan. I know four chan. Trust me on this, because I know four chan and you don't. This is true. And. No, yes, you're right.
00:10:14.526 - 00:10:53.162, Speaker C: I don't know four chan. I've not been on four chan. I don't care to ever be on four chan. But just because you've been on it doesn't mean that you're the expert on kind of this kind of content in that space. And there's a lot of other people who monitor that site and watch this. So they would have spoken up the other part about this about, I want to go back to your point about the comment, the response from the Yuga Labs team, and Daniel Tenor, who goes by the handle of swambat on Twitter, had a good tweet thread about how should they respond? And coincidentally, he published his tweet thread, like, hours before you actually did. And we came back with, was really two things.
00:10:53.162 - 00:11:13.890, Speaker C: One was they should make a strong statement. Renouncing it. Now, normally with something like this, you would say, we're not even going to justify this with a response. But I do think they needed to create a very strongly worded short. Can only even be one paragraph statement of just, we absolutely denounce this. We resent it. We would never do that, period.
00:11:13.890 - 00:11:26.920, Speaker C: So they did make their quite. It was written by Wiley Arano. It wasn't quite as strong as what I would have liked. It was a bit more of a, let's go through the points that they've raised, and we're going to go through and give you evidence to refute all of them.
00:11:27.290 - 00:11:37.050, Speaker A: But they didn't refute all of them. They didn't do a comprehensive refutation, which is why I was like, I thought their statement was a little weak.
00:11:38.430 - 00:11:48.350, Speaker C: Yeah, they need that one paragraph. Just, we absolutely denounce it. And then once they have that paragraph out there, they can always refer to it in the future. Just saying, you know what, we've talked about this. Here's our statement.
00:11:49.170 - 00:12:19.302, Speaker A: Absolutely. I agree. I totally agree that that was a miss. Again, as somebody who completely, in absolutely no way thinks that any of this is even a little bit legitimate. Also, if you want the other conspiracy theory, Ryder rips did post somewhat recently that he said, you can read my senior thesis from 2008 if you like. It's about how in the future, people will only respond to lowest common denominator, clickbait, because they won't read or look into anything. So anyone will be able to get famous online by just marketing garbage like this.
00:12:19.302 - 00:12:47.618, Speaker A: And he was responding to a racist thing. But the irony is that almost feels like his playbook is people aren't going to look deeper at the flimsiness of his allegations. So all they're going to see are the headline and you're going to be able to manufacture. I'm like, I think he's the troll. They're using four CHAN tactics. This is a big troll on their part that they know is bullshit, that they're perpetrating for fame. And because this is his playbook, he does this kind of viral online marketing stuff.
00:12:47.618 - 00:12:50.610, Speaker A: So that's my conspiracy theory. Back at you, Ryder.
00:12:51.350 - 00:13:45.058, Speaker C: Well, it's a good segue because I guess the question is, what was Ryder rips doing in terms of the creating the source content that inspired this video and what was his goal and accomplishment? Was he trolling them? Was he looking to make just a bigger statement about culture? Was this a scam? These questions are out there. And part of this is going to come out in a process because Yuga has filed a lawsuit against Ryder rips. Jeremy Kayan, I think is how you pronounce his name. Also known as Polly Zero X on Twitter and ten John Doe's who have not yet been identified. And they responded, and they responded with a left hand, right hand kind of punch. I like their response. I think they should legally protect themselves.
00:13:45.058 - 00:13:54.002, Speaker C: And now to be clear, just to start setting this next part up, they're not suing about the content of that video or of the website that inspired the video. They're suing.
00:13:54.066 - 00:14:02.780, Speaker A: They're not suing over allegations of racism and Nazism. They're not suing like, they're not claiming libel. Obviously, they think it's lies. It's not about that.
00:14:03.390 - 00:14:32.100, Speaker C: Exactly. They're suing about trademarks. And so what Ryder rips did, and his team, they created a collection identical to the board, ape yacht club. So the apes, ape three, five, six, whatever. And they minted a collection of five of the 10,000 that were identical in every way. They outright copied it. Now, this is where we're going to get into some of the semantics here because it's important and really going to be an important case.
00:14:32.100 - 00:14:59.610, Speaker C: So a number of people incoming. This is going to be a groundbreaking case in NFTs if it goes to court. And I fully agree. I'm really excited to see how this plays out because it is potentially going to set precedent for the space and we're going to learn a lot through this process. So if it does get to be. I can already see supermassive from the defiant broadcasting live from the federal courthouse in LA, NFT court TV style.
00:14:59.950 - 00:15:07.310, Speaker A: I will be there right next to him. I embrace the opportunity to become a courtroom reporter.
00:15:08.210 - 00:15:17.294, Speaker C: I'm ready for you and I will be like the live. I'll be there with you and we'll live podcast after each day of court. Kind of like Elizabeth Holmes when she was on trial.
00:15:17.342 - 00:15:21.166, Speaker A: That's what I was going to say. Yeah, the dropout and bad blood.
00:15:21.198 - 00:15:26.740, Speaker C: Yeah, we could publish a book. We could get the series on Hulu about the board ape rider rips thing.
00:15:27.350 - 00:15:39.560, Speaker A: Let's do it. Who is after this? Neil Strauss is writing a book about board apes. He came up in the Philly on video. Yeah, we'll offline. Continue.
00:15:41.050 - 00:16:23.110, Speaker C: So they're setting this up for a trademark violation because what Ryder rips did is he copied 5000 of the apes and minted them under the Rider Rips board Ape yacht club collection title on OpeNC and other marketplaces and he got 5000 of them done. They were each minted one by one, quote by hand. And that's going to come important in a second. And eventually they were taken down. I'm assuming Yuga Labs put in complaints to the marketplaces and these were taken down. But the suit is about trademark violations about the copying of the collection and crimes or misdeeds that are attributed to the copying of that. And so there's a lot there.
00:16:23.110 - 00:16:59.780, Speaker C: So let's begin if we want to talk about kind of who Yuga Labs is engaging. So they've hired a law firm out of San Francisco, Mountain View called Fenwick and west. They're definitely a big, high profile, tech oriented law firm. They hired. The lead attorney is Eric Ball, who has represented Peloton, Twitter, Uber, Intel, Google, Facebook and many others. And his quote unquote, is trademark litigation partner. So probably a boring area of law, but a very interesting area of law in our case here is trademark litigation, which tells you that they do intend to litigate this case.
00:16:59.780 - 00:17:20.666, Speaker C: And the case is being filed in the district in central California which covers the Los Angeles region. It's probably why they hired a California law firm. And this is a federal trial because of interstate commerce matters. So it's being set in the federal system, legal system.
00:17:20.848 - 00:17:36.094, Speaker A: You mentioned these ten John Doe's. They're filing it against Jeremy, who is Ryder Rips's partner, essentially in this. Explain to us. We don't know who specifically by name these ten John Doe's are, but why they're defendants in this case.
00:17:36.212 - 00:17:57.362, Speaker C: Correct. And they're broken into two groups, Doe's one through five and Doe's six through ten. And there's a distinction between the two groups. Doze one through five are other partners in the project. Help to set it up, help to create the collections, help to manage it. They don't know who those identities are yet. And I wonder if one through five isn't the exact number.
00:17:57.362 - 00:18:38.306, Speaker C: If it's just a placeholder number, it could be one through three or one through ten. But there's that first group of does who were active participants with Ryder and Jeremy. The other do's, six through ten are individuals who purchased NFTs through the collection, through the Riderips collection, and then promoted their NFTs as being authentic board ape Yugalabs NFTs. So it's essentially false kind of stealing of their brand and their credibility for their own use and purposes. So that's why there's two distinctions. And in the court case, there's eleven causes of action. So the lawyers for Yuga are representing that.
00:18:38.306 - 00:18:54.610, Speaker C: There's been eleven different examples of misdeeds here. And Doe's six through ten are not named in all eleven. They're only named in like three or four of them, whereas Doe's one through five, Jeremy and Ryder are named in all of the eleven cases for action.

00:20:36.306 - 00:20:44.454, Speaker A: And so what is Yuga asking for here? What are they hoping to achieve from this lawsuit? By what they're hoping is by jury.
00:20:44.502 - 00:21:04.894, Speaker C: Yes. So they are asking for a jury trial. And that tells me that they want the public visuals of this. They want the attention, they want to make a statement. They wouldn't hire this law firm, this attorney, go to this trouble unless they intend to see it through. Which is why a lot of people online were saying, oh, this is a joke. They'll never see it through, and I don't see it that way.
00:21:04.894 - 00:21:32.282, Speaker C: I think if they've gone to this level, they intend to go to see it in court. They want their day in court, they want this all brought out, and they want to end this from ever happening again. If you stand up to a bully, I'll just say, if you don't stand up to a bully when they're in your face, they're going to come back again. So this is now standing up to who people they perceive as bullying them. And what they're asking for is a number of things. They're asking for a court order against Ryder rips and defendants to stop. Just stop.
00:21:32.282 - 00:21:59.614, Speaker C: You can't do anything with anything. Board, ape, period. It's an all stop. Second they want the destruction of all infringing matter. And that's kind of an interesting one, because how do you destroy a digital piece of art? You could delete the collection off of Opensea, which they've already done. So how is that done? And there has to be a written report as to how they did it that accompanies that step. Third, they want the withdrawal of all applications for trademarks.
00:21:59.614 - 00:22:29.194, Speaker C: So that sounds like Ryder rips has made applications for Ryder rips board eight yacht club trademarks. So they want those withdrawn. Fourth, they want a judgment, a financial judgment in the amount of Yuga's damages to be determined in court, what those actual damages are, plus all of Ryder Rip's profits, plus Yuga's legal fees and costs. And finally, they want a judgment for enhanced impunitive damages. So they want a punishment judgment as well.
00:22:29.232 - 00:22:33.482, Speaker A: They want money. They want money to punish them for having done this in the first place.
00:22:33.536 - 00:22:48.370, Speaker C: I was going to say this is a multi million dollar lawsuit. We already know that Ryder Rips made several million dollars on this. A and the legal fees are going to be astronomical for this kind of a law firm to represent them. So this is going to be a huge judgment if they win it.
00:22:48.440 - 00:23:27.374, Speaker A: This is so much bigger than just this case. And I think it's interesting that it's this case because it's gotten so high profile because of the salacious nature of the accusations and the kind of horrendousness of the accusations. But what we're really talking about here is, can you copy an NFT? And the people in the Ryder Rips camp seem to have this rallying cry, which is you can't copy an NFT because of the providence piece and because of the blockchain piece. And you can go. And they each have a unique identifier. That's what makes them non fungible. And so they are claiming you cannot copy an NFT because of that.
00:23:27.374 - 00:24:05.850, Speaker A: And that's a fundamental property of the blockchain, semantically speaking. Of course, they're right. And of course, the fact that you can't copy an NFT is why the right click save. People don't have an argument. Because fundamentally, taking a picture of the Mona Lisa doesn't mean you have the Mona Lisa. But on a regulatory level, I completely support projects being able to go after projects like this that are copying their works. I mean, you're seeing this problem with artists, right, where people are minting other artists work and then pushing them out as if they were the artist's work.
00:24:05.850 - 00:24:52.230, Speaker A: And I'm very in support of artists being able to protect what is theirs, not because you can't technically go and see the distinction and see the difference, but because we need to get rid of spam and scam in this space and there are going to be newcomers who are going to come in and see the wrong board ape and purchase it and think it's real and get confused and riders saying, oh, we've taken every precaution. So you're not confused? You don't think this is a real board ape, blah blah blah blah blah. I'm not buying it. I think as a precedent you absolutely need to be able to protect your intellectual property if you're a project that creates distinct art. And I love the providence piece of the blockchain. I think that's why this makes them collectible. I still think you should be allowed to sue and go after folks who copy your work.
00:24:52.380 - 00:25:39.266, Speaker C: Yeah. The way I see it is their argument is that because the code behind every NFT is unique in the token, that copying an NFT might look, the artwork might look the same, but the code in the token is different because there can only be one token. And so it's saying what matters here? Is it the token, the uniqueness of the token, or is it the uniqueness of the visual that represents the token? And I have a feeling they're on a losing side of this argument in the current court system. And Jeremy has put out some tweets about we're fighting for the art, we're trying to change copyright law. You don't change copyright law with a lawsuit. Legislation changes copyright law and judicial judgments change copyright law based on that legislation. So you're not going to be winning.
00:25:39.298 - 00:25:41.210, Speaker A: Yeah, lawsuits go on precedent.
00:25:41.870 - 00:25:56.430, Speaker C: Exactly. So you're on the losing side of that argument. It doesn't mean that it's not worth fighting for if it's important. But you should be talking to your congress lady or your congressman, not eucalyptus attorneys, to try to get copyright law changed.
00:25:56.770 - 00:26:55.678, Speaker A: This is not a legal opinion here that I'm about to provide, but it's about what are you fundamentally right if you're not fundamentally an art first project? Right? Like if what you are is a protocol and it's about the smart contract and the code, then sure, I'm open to that concept. But if you're talking about something that is first and foremost about the visual and not about the smart contract code, I just don't buy that. And I think Ryder Rips is full of shit. And look, I get his career has been about pushing boundaries, but I think these are areas that the space will benefit from some more web two style regulation. I really do. I love the ethos of web3. And this, to me, does not infringe upon decentralization on any of the ways that it really fundamentally matters.
00:26:55.678 - 00:27:56.262, Speaker A: And what it does. If this whole space is about empowering creators, this is a tool that's going to be in the arsenal of creators to keep them empowered. Right? This is good for the creator class that we are so concerned with here in this space because it gives them instruments to protect themselves from people trying to profit off of their work. So I look forward to this. Is there a piece we should be talking about or thinking about here? When it comes to the fact that individual board ape holders have rights over their apes, and it's not just yuga labs can initiate this, but the holders have rights as well. I know Jim McNeil has already made a joke about seemingly that he is going to sue Ryder rips, because Ryder Rips'profile picture is literally Jimmy's ape. So what should we be thinking about when it comes to that?
00:27:56.316 - 00:28:33.838, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up. In fact, I did not know that Rip's PFP is Jimmy's ape. That's is. This is one of the things that makes this fascinating is that we have, for the first time, art that the owners have some commercial rights in. Jimmy is creating, what's the band called again? Kinship. He's leveraging the commercial interest in his apes and creating a product, creating an entertainment product with that. And so this is the first time that this is Yuga suing on behalf of their own behalf, but not on behalf of their owners.
00:28:33.838 - 00:29:38.246, Speaker C: But the question is, can Jimmy sue or could any board ape owner sue for lost economic opportunity around their ape because of the actions that Ryder Rips took? I have to believe the answer is yes. I believe that this damaged or could have damaged the economic opportunities for those individual ape owners feature. So the folks I do some advising with, they launched their IP marketplace a few weeks ago, which is now actively putting deals together for ape owners and world of women and commercial partners. And do those deals have less value, less potential as a result of this? And I believe the answer is yes. At the very least, they can make a claim that the Yuga brands have been diminished in some way and makes their apes a little bit less valuable. With this halo kind of this cloud of controversy hanging over their heads. And if this turns out that Ryder is found liable in the Yuga suit, could there be a class action on behalf of those 5000 apes that were minted by Ryder for the diminished economic opportunity.
00:29:38.246 - 00:29:40.200, Speaker C: And I think the answer is yes.
00:29:42.570 - 00:30:05.818, Speaker A: This is a dumb question I'm about to ask, but that's we're about here is getting to the truth. What rights does Yuga have over these individual apes that allows them to sue Ryder as opposed to the individual holders being the ones to sue Ryder?
00:30:05.914 - 00:30:10.682, Speaker C: They're not suing about the individual apes that were minted by Ryder.
00:30:10.746 - 00:30:11.466, Speaker A: Trademark.
00:30:11.578 - 00:30:20.766, Speaker C: It's the trademarks. So they're suing for the misuse and quote unquote tortious interference of their trademarks.
00:30:20.958 - 00:30:27.046, Speaker A: And what are literally, it's literally Yuga lab or board, ape Yacht Club, the name.
00:30:27.228 - 00:30:48.474, Speaker C: This is where it gets a little bit messy. So Yuga has multiple trademark applications pending. They've actually not yet been granted any trademarks officially yet. But the applications are pending. They've been pending for over a year. That's not unusual. It takes a long time for the trademark office to process.
00:30:48.474 - 00:31:12.020, Speaker C: One or two of them have been sent back with follow up questions. That also is not unusual. I've had to submit a lot of trademarks and had those back and forth with the trademark office. I do believe trademarks are still enforceable while they are in the application process. It just, if their application is rejected, then you can't make a claim that you own that trademark. But I believe that they're still enforceable. So Yuga is within their rights to do this.
00:31:12.020 - 00:31:56.722, Speaker C: The other thing that's interesting about the trademarks that Yuga has, which are specifically around the skull with the kind of the black circular, the 18 teeth, I think around the BAYC tag. And then they have multiple versions of that. So it's around their brands and their logos is where this suit is coming and that's kind of where they're basing it. What's interesting about what Yuga's filed for trademark applications is that you can tell that they came into this when they created the collection without much of a trademark strategy because they filed their first trademark application a month after the minting. So this is like May of last year. They minted, I think, in April. So like a month later.
00:31:56.776 - 00:32:26.774, Speaker A: Oh, April 30, Hitler's death date, which they brought up as if that meant something. Don't get me started. They didn't mint on April 30. They minted before. And the New Yorker journalist apparently got that wrong and printed it as being April 30. And then in the Phillyon video, Philly on phrases it like they made a point to tell the New Yorker that their mint was on April 30, which is complete editorializing because he has no idea if board Apes actively told them to call it April 30 or not. And board apes is claiming, no, we didn't tell her it was April 30.
00:32:26.774 - 00:32:31.686, Speaker A: She just made a mistake. So anyway, but just, sorry not to derail.
00:32:31.878 - 00:32:35.550, Speaker C: You're still stuck on the video, Carly. I'm moving on to deep down the rabbit hole.
00:32:35.970 - 00:32:42.526, Speaker A: I've watched so many hours of this video. I literally have, like point by point dissected it, which I'm not going to bore people with. Continue, please, John.
00:32:42.628 - 00:33:21.274, Speaker C: So I was saying that they didn't seem to have much of a strategy. This is one of the curiosities that came out of the suit, which is the filing, which they didn't seem to have much of a strategy around trademarks, because they have submitted trademark applications on maybe seven or eight different dates in the last 18 months. And I believe each time they've gone back with new trademark applications, it's been to add categories of, oh, digital downloads, oh, digital games. So I think they have to keep going back to add new categories. So they're probably keeping their trademark lawyer pretty happy right now. So that was one of the curiosities that came out of this. Is that how they've approached their trademark applications? But those applications are valid.
00:33:21.274 - 00:33:24.720, Speaker C: They are pending, and that's what this suit is about. Those.
00:33:27.490 - 00:33:46.302, Speaker A: Ugalabs is suing them about the trademarks. And so could we see like a class action lawsuit comprised of a whole bunch of holders who are suing Ryder for commercial use of those apes specifically? That's what you alluded to earlier. The answer seems to be yes. And could that be like a class action? Like they all join together because they're all aggrieved similarly?
00:33:46.446 - 00:34:15.790, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, there's two different groups here. There's the group of the 5000 that were minted out of the 10,000. So that's one group that has a certain kind of claim. Then there's the whole group of 10,000 who could be part of a class that say, hey, we had economic interest in these NFts and because of what you've done with these accusations, our economic interest is diminished. We don't have as much opportunity to monetize these characters. And so we're together.
00:34:15.790 - 00:34:32.734, Speaker C: We want you to pay us to compensate us for that. So I think there are potential for class actions. I'm not a lawyer. If I were in this group, I'd be trying to rally people to join me I'd be one of the people that'd be like, yeah, we're going to sue them. And I'd be trying to rally some of the folks to join me.
00:34:32.772 - 00:34:33.034, Speaker A: Totally.
00:34:33.082 - 00:34:34.960, Speaker C: At least get some advice on that.
00:34:35.290 - 00:35:14.106, Speaker A: If I were an apolder, I would similarly be doing that. Well, what's interesting, you know, I can get all riled up about this. You know, fundamentally, I recognize it's, it's a distraction, and it's somewhat meaningless in the sense that it doesn't seem to have affected the price of board apes at all. Now, they've, of course, fallen quite precipitously in the bear market generally, but this video had absolutely no impact on them. And you have this just incredibly lame rallying cry at the end of the Phillyon video that's very like, let's go show these guys and stop listing your board ape at a good price. And the ape price is fine. The other side metaverse land parcels are through the roof because of the announcement that they're going to do some sort of other side thing.
00:35:14.106 - 00:35:58.206, Speaker A: So I will close with this and then give your closing statement. What I seem to be seeing on Twitter, again, I think the prevailing sentiment is that this is dumb, but I do see people who seem to be like, there's something fishy here. And again, I think if you really dig into each of these accusations individually, there's just so many alternatives available for any of the one individual accusations. And they're so scattershot, these accusations. They're so non coherent with one another. Again, they're just like randomly evil dudes who just cherry pick weird, random things that have evally been done in history to make references to. It's nonsensical, in my opinion, if you really dig in.
00:35:58.206 - 00:36:59.394, Speaker A: But I understand the discomfort people feel a, because obviously these are very serious accusations, and we don't want anything that feels even remotely like this in this space, if you're a good person. And I also think Yuga Labs is so private and so kind of mysterious and such a black box. And I do think that Nicole Munoz, if I'm pronouncing that, like, does come across, like, a little awkward and a little off in the interview she gave, which I actually do not see as an indictment of her. I see it as, like, she's a little bit awkward and people read into. So I'm sympathetic to people who feel that way, and I would say it feels like a boo Radley situation or something. Don't jump to the conclusion that someone is bad or that there's something kind of evil or nefarious going on just because there's something kind of quiet or mysterious or misunderstood about this group, which I share. I share a feeling of sort of like, who and what is Yuga labs? And I've been critical of them before.
00:36:59.394 - 00:37:21.670, Speaker A: I don't think they've executed at the level of praise and untouchableness that they sometimes get. Like, I actually think they've executed well, but that they're, like, not. I think doodles has executed much better, actually. So I understand that feeling. But I would really say don't leap to the conclusion that that makes them neo Nazis, because I really reject that.
00:37:21.820 - 00:38:16.106, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll wrap my kind of final statement by saying, know, I mentioned that when I first watched this because I was in a bad spot in terms of my feelings towards Yuga when it came out that I was immediately like, wow, they got something here where I've kind of ended up with, this is, no, this is not true. There's nothing valid here. If there's any criticism or things that could be said about it from the yuga's perspective is that perhaps they didn't understand some of the semiotics around the art that they were creating and certainly didn't take the care that maybe they should have to really understand what they had created better. But I'll put that to just being kind of new in the space in terms of launching collections and naivety and maybe perhaps just a little bit of just not doing the full due diligence that they should have. But I don't believe that there's any ability to do it. I don't believe that any of them are secretly dog whistling to four chan neo dotsy types. It's not true.
00:38:16.208 - 00:38:50.514, Speaker A: All right, well, that concludes our Yuga Labs special, breaking down at least what we know so far about this lawsuit, about the rider Rips board ape yacht club scandal in the first place. I'm going to be closely tracking this. I think this is precedent setting. I think it's fascinating. It is interesting to me, like, tabloids are interesting in that dark sort of watching a car crash kind of a way. And it's also interesting for me from a substantive, how will this space play out from a legal and regulatory perspective? So thank you for tuning in. John, thank you so much, as always, for all of your amazing insight.
00:38:50.514 - 00:38:53.014, Speaker A: And until next time, thanks for having me.
00:38:53.052 - 00:38:53.800, Speaker C: Take care.
