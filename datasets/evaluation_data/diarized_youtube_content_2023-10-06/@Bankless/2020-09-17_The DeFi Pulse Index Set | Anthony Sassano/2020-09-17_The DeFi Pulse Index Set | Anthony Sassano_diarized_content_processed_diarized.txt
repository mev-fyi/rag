00:00:08.450 - 00:00:40.410, Speaker A: This episode of Bankless is brought to you by Ave. Ave is a great place to borrow and lend digital assets. On Ethereum, you can deposit your preferred asset of choice in order to borrow a different asset, which is particularly good for yield farming if you want to deposit your ether instead of selling it. So you can borrow Dai or USDC to yield farm with. One of the cool things about Ave is that it offers you two various interest rates, a variable one that changes as the market does, or a stable one that gets fixed in for the long term. Check them out@aave.com we're also brought to you by monolith.
00:00:40.410 - 00:01:27.886, Speaker A: Monolith is a really important tool to help you go bankless, but still let you buy your groceries at your local grocery store. Monolith will ship you a very sexy Visa card that you can use wherever Visa is accepted, which is basically the whole world. But instead of using the dollars in your bank account, it uses the Dai in your monolith smart contract wallet. Check them out at Monolith XYZ and get your monolith visa card today. You know that random string of characters that you have to pass to your friends and family to show them what your Ethereum address is and they just don't get it. Unstoppable domains fixes that problem. With unstoppable domains, you get a human readable name so you can tell them to instead of paying you at zero x 1743 Q four, you can just tell them hey, pay me at Davidhoffman XYZ or Davidhoffman Z-I-L.
00:01:27.886 - 00:02:06.586, Speaker A: You don't have to ever worry about sending the wrong address because it's human readable. And this works for not just Ethereum, but for bitcoin, for litecoin, for any blockchain that works with unstoppable domains. You can even tell bitcoiners to send you bitcoin to Davidhoffman eth. They even allow you to set up uncensorable websites that are always accessible, even if the chinese nation state doesn't want them to be. Check them out@unstoppabledomains.com if you're still using blockfolio to check up on your portfolio, you're behind the times. Check out Zapper fi because Zapper looks directly on chain to tell you exactly how much of which assets you own.
00:02:06.586 - 00:02:31.810, Speaker A: Not only does it know which assets you own, but it also knows where they are. So if you are providing liquidity to Uniswap or you've deposited them to compound or to Aave, Zapper knows and it will give you a comprehensive report of your entire Defi portfolio. Not only that, but you can even make transactions through Zapper that allow you to invest in various Defi protocols, like balancer or Uniswap or curve. Check them out at Zapper fi.
00:02:32.470 - 00:02:45.110, Speaker B: All right, guys, we are here with Anthony Cesano of set protocol. Set just released a very awesome new index. It's the product that we all have wanted from set. Anthony, welcome to meet the nation.
00:02:45.690 - 00:02:49.718, Speaker C: Hey, David, thanks for having me. Really excited to, I guess, talk about this new product.
00:02:49.884 - 00:02:50.214, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:50.252 - 00:02:53.930, Speaker B: So where did this come from? How long has this been stewing?
00:02:54.590 - 00:03:29.698, Speaker C: It's been stewing for a few weeks now, probably a couple of months at this point. Basically came from Defi pulse coming to us and saying, we want to do like a Defi index. We think your infrastructure is the perfect match, so let's build it. And we worked on it over the last couple of months together in collaboration with them. We launched it a couple of days ago, and it's basically an index of ten DFI tokens on Ethereum. And there's like a methodology behind it and everything of what gets included and what's eligible to be included. And it rebalances every so often.
00:03:29.698 - 00:04:04.702, Speaker C: I think it's like once a month at the moment. And it's kind of like managed by us at this point. But, yeah, we basically created it as a way to give cheap and easy exposure for people to all these dFI tokens. Because if you were to do all the trades yourself for all of the ten tokens on Ethereum right now, you'd have to, one, approve all the tokens. When you go to like, Uniswap, for example, then you would have to trade them all, and then you'd have to manage a position yourself and everything. So this literally, one Uniswap trade or one trade on token sets which goes through Uniswap, will give you access to all of these tokens. And the rebalancing is also handled automatically for you.
00:04:04.702 - 00:04:05.134, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:05.172 - 00:04:06.194, Speaker A: So there seems to be a pretty.
00:04:06.232 - 00:04:24.680, Speaker B: Strong theme lately of products that just make access to returns just automated in some specific way. And that seems to be what this is doing as well. Let's talk about how the index is constructed. So how did you guys pick which tokens go where and how to weight each one and how that adjusts over time, too.
00:04:25.530 - 00:05:05.090, Speaker C: Yeah, so it's basically market cap weighted, like, I guess like a normal index would be. So last time I checked, Wifi was number one, lend was number two. So they obviously got very high market caps. And you go down the list and the market caps get smaller. So obviously these weights will change over time. And then once it's kind of like, rebalanced, they'll go back to their original weights based on not, sorry, not the original weights, but they'll go back to the weights based on their market caps in relation to each other. In terms of how we pick what gets included, there's actually a pretty rigorous methodology that we published in our blog post that people can go check out that basically goes through each step.
00:05:05.090 - 00:05:44.190, Speaker C: There's a lot of things like the token must be on ethereum, of course. The token must be part of a legitimate project. It can't just be a random food ponzi or something like that. Right? The token must have more than 5% of its supply in circulation as well, for example. That's why something like CRV isn't in there, because that still has a very small supply, very small circulating supply. So, yeah, there's a bunch of different things that tokens have to meet before they can go in there, though I believe there are exceptions to that as well. There's actually a condition in there that a token must be alive for 180 days, but Wifi is in there, and Wifi hasn't been live for that long.
00:05:44.190 - 00:06:00.566, Speaker C: But we included Wifi, obviously, because it's in a high demand token. It's very popular within the community and all that sort of stuff. So tokens like uni that just came out today could be included way before that 180 days comes through. It just depends on demand, for example.
00:06:00.748 - 00:06:15.180, Speaker B: Absolutely. And so there's ten tokens in the index. And so I'm familiar with balancer, which has a cap at eight tokens. Do you guys have some sort of technical cap, or are you guys free to kind of add as many tokens as possible?
00:06:16.030 - 00:06:47.074, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't believe there's a technical cap, actually, on our end. We can basically include as many as we want in there. I think at a point it gets to diminishing returns. If you have 100 tokens in there, you can only really have, like, 1% weighted. It depends on the market cap, but the weightings become so small. Right, yeah, exactly. And the 100 tokens, 100 dFI tokens, you might have some micro cap that really pumps really hard and then takes up a lot of the index.
00:06:47.074 - 00:06:51.874, Speaker C: So, yeah, there's no technical limitation, but obviously there's, like, a logical limitation.
00:06:52.002 - 00:06:59.270, Speaker B: Right. And so who decides which tokens get added and or removed from the index?
00:07:00.330 - 00:07:44.120, Speaker C: Yeah. So currently that is kind of managed by set and Defi pulse, where we will deliberate on that and kind of like see what we want to include and what we want to exclude. Obviously, it's only been out for a couple of days, so we haven't done any of that yet. We haven't made any decisions around that yet, but yeah, so it's basically, I guess for people familiar with the social trading sets on token sets now, it's basically like that where set and defi pulse are the social trader, or like the manager of the Defi pulse index and decide on that eventually. It'd be cool to see this kind of turned over to the community in some way, or to get the community more involved in this in some way. But we thought for practicality, while it was still young, we would just manage it on our end.
00:07:44.810 - 00:07:54.060, Speaker B: So how does this token actually come to be? It's a token that holds ten tokens inside of it. Who created that? And is gas expensive to do all that?
00:07:54.830 - 00:08:38.898, Speaker C: Yeah, so I guess the way it works for users at the moment is that when they're buying the set through token sets, as I mentioned, they're going through Uniswap. So they're just buying the token itself through basically a normal uniswap trade, but using our interface to do so. If you want to actually create the set, like mint it yourself, you can actually do that as well. But you have to bring all ten tokens yourself, right. And you have to approve them. And as I mentioned at the start, you have to do all the expensive transactions. So to actually create it, I believe at current gas prices, it's definitely hundreds of dollars to create this, whereas a simple uniswap trade, even at the prices today, like of really high gas prices, I think it's about $30 or $40, depending on the congestion.
00:08:38.898 - 00:09:13.250, Speaker C: It's a lot less than that on a normal day, right. It's like $15, $10 or something. And then you can also redeem as well. So if you have a DPI or DFI pulse index token that you bought off Uniswap, you can go to our contracts, the set protocol contracts, and redeem it for the underlying, basically. So it's always backed up by the underlying. Which also brings me to the point of how does the price of the underlying keep in check with the price on uniswap? Right. And there is a spread there, and that's where the arbitrage is coming.
00:09:13.250 - 00:09:36.874, Speaker C: So there's an arbitrage bot set up to kind of like capture that spread. Defi pulse open source, their version of it. So anyone can do this. So if the Uniswap price gets too ahead of the actual value of all the tokens in the set itself, you can do an arbitrage between that and then profit off the spread. So that's how it's basically kept in check between the two.
00:09:36.992 - 00:10:08.100, Speaker B: That's super interesting, because I would imagine that there actually is some sort of premium associated with the index token because of people are lazy and they'll pay extra to be lazy and just to buy it on Uniswap, but then also gas, right. If it saves them on gas, they will just go ahead and pay for that premium on Uniswap. Even if it exists, they'll pay for it anyways and continue to add to that premium. So for somebody who can maintain gas efficiency and can run a bot pretty well, I feel like it's a pretty advantageous profit opportunity there.
00:10:08.890 - 00:10:29.626, Speaker C: Yeah, there definitely is. And it's also affected by larger orders. Right. On uniswap, when someone does a really large order and it might incur some slippage of like a few percent, we warn about this on token sets, but obviously you can override that. On uniswap, you can override it as well if your slippage is going to be high, if you really want to get in. Right. And then that creates like an arbitrage opportunity.
00:10:29.626 - 00:10:35.434, Speaker C: So yeah, savy traders and savvy people can take advantage of this. Totally.
00:10:35.562 - 00:10:48.420, Speaker B: So this token, it can be a token that just lives in your wallet to invest in. But as we all know, DeFi is composable. Is there any sort of vision or plans to get this integrated into the various applications that we all know and love?
00:10:49.030 - 00:11:17.222, Speaker C: Yeah. So that's like a big vision we have actually with this. One of the core things that we wanted to do since kind of creating it, is that we want to get it integrated into basically everything across deFi. So all the things where you can stake your deFi tokens to earn more of these other protocol token, we want the defi pulse index to be on that. Right. We want you to be able to stake your defi pulse index and earn these other tokens. We want it added to avair and compound.
00:11:17.222 - 00:11:35.634, Speaker C: We want you to be able to use it as collateral. Right, because it is a pretty good collateral. Like you have all these diversified defi tokens in there. So yeah, we want that to happen. We want all the integration partners, all the wallets to have it in there. We want exchanges to list it. Right.
00:11:35.634 - 00:11:51.890, Speaker C: And for their users and basically be know one click. Access to know index products are pretty simple when you really think about it, and it's all about the marketing and the integrations. Right. And we want DeFi pulse index to be the DeFi index.
00:11:51.970 - 00:12:09.050, Speaker B: Right. Okay, so with all this demand for binance lists it, Coinbase lists it, there's plenty of demand on uniswap. Where does the supply come from when the demand is so great? When there is that arbitrage opportunity, how does supply actually meet demand?
00:12:10.110 - 00:12:50.118, Speaker C: Yeah, so as I mentioned, savvy traders and people that know how to do this will actually mint more of the DeFi pulse index set directly from our smart contracts using the underlying tokens. Then they'll go and sell that on Uniswap or sell that on another exchange in order to capture that spread. Right. Make a little bit of money, but also bolster the liquidity, which makes the market a lot more liquid and gives better prices to users as well. So that's how I guess it would scale over time. Liquidity is the biggest thing in kind of like DeFi and something that every project wants to get. And that's why we see so many people incentivizing liquidity as well.
00:12:50.118 - 00:13:06.046, Speaker C: So we believe currently the incentive of being able to capture that arbitrage spread and earn a little bit of money there is enough to motivate people, and we've actually seen on chain people doing this already. So it obviously is enough for certain groups of people. Yeah.
00:13:06.068 - 00:13:16.740, Speaker B: So are you guys just being laissez fair about this and being like, hey, free market, go and go, supply, meet demand? Or have you guys tried to bootstrap some market makers in order to make this happen?
00:13:17.510 - 00:14:02.302, Speaker C: Yeah, so we initially seeded it ourselves to make sure that it had initial liquidity there. We work with some liquidity partners and also the projects that they have their token in the index to seed this thing as well, to make sure that there was liquidity there. We monitor it closely too. We kind of like run bots as well, but we try to encourage the free market as much as possible as that's what we've done previously with our other sets. So with our other sets, anyone can participate in the rebalances of them. And we have like a market maker network that does that because we didn't want to be responsible for that. We wanted it to be a purely free market driven, where we could rely on the market to do this so that it's more decentralized than just relying on our team.
00:14:02.302 - 00:14:09.266, Speaker C: So that's the same approach we're taking with the Defi pulse index. And, yeah, as I said, we're seeing some really awesome traction so far.
00:14:09.448 - 00:14:30.170, Speaker B: Fantastic. So I would imagine that I think this product is going to be absolutely successful. I can't imagine why it wouldn't be. So are you guys going to make more indices? I think there's room for the. Maybe you guys are keeping the vegetables out of this particular index, but maybe you can make an index specifically for vegetables, like what's coming down the pipeline with future indices.
00:14:31.070 - 00:14:50.894, Speaker C: Yeah. So I guess the indexes are part of the v two rollout that we're currently going through. So there's three main phases to that. There's support for indexes and multi asset support. So we traditionally only supported two assets. Now we support more than two assets inside sets. Phase two is yield farming products, which we're coming out with very soon.
00:14:50.894 - 00:15:23.882, Speaker C: It's going to be really exciting. And then phase three is improvements for managers or social traders, as they're known. And this is when we can kind of bring in more people to build more sets. Right. We want it to be open so that kind of people can build sets doing anything they want. And they could have like a food ponzi set if they wanted to. But the difference is that we won't list everything on the token sets website because the token sets website is our interface into set protocol, whereas someone else could build on set protocol's contracts and set up their own interface and do it that way.
00:15:23.882 - 00:15:56.594, Speaker C: Right. But we do have plans for other indices that we want to do ourselves. But firstly, we're going to do that yield farming products because we think that they are definitely in higher demand than maybe other index products are. And then the improvements for traders and for managers in general and yeah, then I think once that phases out, we're going to see kind of an explosion of people building out these things and making all sorts of different products that I think everyone across Ethereum can take advantage of.
00:15:56.712 - 00:16:44.530, Speaker B: So build your own index, right? So you guys are famous for your guys, a social trader where you can kind of be your own trader, right. And then other people who aren't good traders, like perhaps myself, can follow other people who are good traders. I was initially a trader just to kind of play with it and off the bat, but then I realized, like, you know what, I'm a buy and hold kind of guy. I kind of just left my trader set just all in ETH, right, because I'm a massive eth maxi. But now I feel like this product for who I am. And for what I like to do, I think a build your own index is a little bit more aligned with how I see things. And so I have my normie friends who ask me like, oh, what token should I buy? Maybe I'll just go make my own index and I'll tell them to go buy my own index token.
00:16:45.430 - 00:17:13.434, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And that's kind of what we see as well. And what we see as a vision, too, is that there is plenty of people that are not in this ecosystem yet, and they don't want to have to spend every day in it like we do. Right? They're not like, as dedicated. It's like any kind of community. A lot of people, for instance, buy, like, gaming consoles because they don't want to buy a gaming pc because it's harder, right? It takes more involvement, it's more passion driven. It's the same thing with this.
00:17:13.434 - 00:17:55.194, Speaker C: People don't want to study all the defi tokens. They don't want to buy them themselves. They don't want to go through the hoops. They just want one click access to a Defi token index. And an index is a familiar product to them as well, right? It's something that they can get behind, because in Ethereum especially, we have, like, a tendency to have so much jargon that people just get super confused really quickly. So that's what's always excited me about set and why I love working here is because we have the opportunity to bring these products that we all know and love to a wider audience that I don't think many other projects right now in Ethereum can actually target because they're still so early. But I think set brings those products to the masses, basically.
00:17:55.392 - 00:18:26.900, Speaker B: So, Anthony, are you ready for a bunch of tokens that you guys excluded to come knocking on your door? Like, hey, will you let us into the index? Let us into the index, please. Because being in the S and P 500 is a big deal. Like, companies fight tooth and nail to get into the S and P 500 because it's legitimizing and it also provides demand, right? If you're in the S and P 500, more funds can buy your token. Have you guys thought about this angle coming from various parts of other teams with tokens or even other VC hedge funds that just want to buy the set?
00:18:27.670 - 00:18:54.518, Speaker C: Yeah, we thought about this a lot and we figured it was a positive thing, right, because that'll signal demand to us to what tokens people want included. And today I've already gotten multiple messages from people saying, when is uni going to be in the index. Right. And the cool thing is that we don't actually have to necessarily remove anything from the index. We can just add uni, for example. We don't have to remove another token if there is enough demand, which obviously there is because it's Uniswap's token. Right.
00:18:54.518 - 00:19:27.080, Speaker C: But yeah, we expect other teams to come and say, can we be in the index? Or whatever? But as I said, we have that methodology that we want to try and stick by. If we see demand from users, especially like broad demand from users, that signals that those users will actually buy the product. If we include the token, then it makes more sense for us to do that. But we definitely want to keep it a kind of like, not exclusive club. But we want people to want to be in the index. Right. We want it to be like a premium product that people are banging at the door to get into.
00:19:27.080 - 00:19:35.830, Speaker C: From, I guess, a marketing perspective, that's really awesome as well and gets us growing and gets us integrated with more platforms.
00:19:35.990 - 00:19:48.560, Speaker B: Fantastic. And the greatest thing I think about this is that as Defi gets better, as Defi matures, as better assets come to defi, the set index will likewise follow in that.
00:19:51.890 - 00:20:09.270, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, as I said, uni came out today. There's going to be other tokens that come out soon that people are going to be going crazy for. So, yeah, if we can grow the defi pulse index to a size where everyone wants to be in it, but only some tokens can be in it based on the methodology, I think that's pretty successful.
00:20:10.010 - 00:20:13.240, Speaker B: Okay, so now that you guys have this index, what comes next?
00:20:14.010 - 00:20:34.406, Speaker C: Yeah, so I guess, as I mentioned, yield farming products come next. We've been teasing these for a while. We have some really exciting things in the works right now. It's going to be coming sooner than people think. We don't want to wait too long to release these things. The space moves really fast. There are other solutions out there already and we want to offer something unique to users.
00:20:34.406 - 00:20:57.486, Speaker C: So I'm personally very excited about it. As a heavy yield farmer myself, I would use these products. We always ask internally, is this a product that we would buy or use? If it's a yes, we'll build it. Basically yes from the majority of the team, I guess. And that's how we kind of have thought about our products to date. So, yeah, keep an eye out for that. And as I mentioned, after that, we're going to be bringing tons of improvements to managers.
00:20:57.486 - 00:21:24.430, Speaker C: We're actually restructuring it. So we're actually just going to be calling them portfolios now. So for example, a social trader can come along and set up a portfolio. We're going to just call them managers from now on. But they can set up a portfolio and then they can basically take in capital and do whatever they want with that capital across all of Ethereum. So if you want to go lend it out and borrow against it, you can do that. If you want to go use uniswap to trade between tokens, like as a social trader for one of your strategies, you can do that.
00:21:24.430 - 00:21:53.414, Speaker C: You're no longer limited to our own infrastructure, which has been what it has been in the past. You can also farm all these different tokens. You can have a set that's like a super risky one or like a portfolio that's super risky. You can basically say this is super high risk, only enter this if you're prepared to lose all your money or whatever and things like that, so that you can chase the latest kind of food farms if you want to, for example. Right. We want to enable this. We want to be safe about it.
00:21:53.414 - 00:22:14.958, Speaker C: We don't want to promote these things to people who maybe aren't aware of the risks as well. So there's a fine line there. But that's on the token set side. On the set protocol, smart contract side anyone can build on, it's permissionless. We're not going to be stopping anyone from doing that. So that's how we kind of like envision the protocol going. We want to decentralize the protocol out.
00:22:14.958 - 00:22:38.770, Speaker C: We want to make sure that people can build on us because we're obviously big believers in the whole vision of Ethereum and the movement and community plays like a massive part in that. If you look at any of the other protocols that have embraced community, they're the biggest ones, right? Because having an open protocol that people can build on and people can get involved in just makes the whole process a lot, a lot faster and you can get products out a lot quicker.
00:22:38.930 - 00:22:46.710, Speaker B: Well, Anthony, when that product comes out of set, I look forward to bringing you back on the meet the nation. So thank you for coming to meet the nation.
00:22:47.130 - 00:22:48.850, Speaker C: Yes, thank you for having me. Cheers.
