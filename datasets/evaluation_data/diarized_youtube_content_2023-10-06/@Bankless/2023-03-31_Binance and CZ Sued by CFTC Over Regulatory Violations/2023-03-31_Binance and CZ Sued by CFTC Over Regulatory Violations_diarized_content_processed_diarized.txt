00:00:00.250 - 00:00:05.966, Speaker A: Gary Gensler to the principal's office. Can we get Gary Gensler to the principal's office?
00:00:06.068 - 00:00:09.498, Speaker B: Wait, I thought he was the principal. You can bring him to another office. There's.
00:00:09.514 - 00:00:14.990, Speaker A: There's the principal's principal, which he is now going to. Yeah. So he has been summoned.
00:00:16.930 - 00:00:22.362, Speaker B: Bankless Nation. It is the last Friday of March. It's time for what is it, David?
00:00:22.506 - 00:00:41.046, Speaker A: The Bankless Friday weekly roll up, where we cover the higher weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor. This week is a medium week. Not so bad. So everyone can take a breather. Medium. Still a lot happened, though, so yet we persevere nonetheless, regardless of whether it was a big week or a medium week in crypto. And here we are.
00:00:41.068 - 00:00:54.790, Speaker B: Yeah, you have to keep going, right? Because you never know which roll up might be the last roll up. You just never know. Life is uncertain. David, a few topics of the week, though. Oh, I got to start here. You're not in your usual place, though. No, different background.
00:00:54.790 - 00:00:55.622, Speaker B: Different background.
00:00:55.686 - 00:01:02.270, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm currently in Montenegro, which is not ever a spot that I ever thought I'd be, to be honest.
00:01:02.340 - 00:01:10.258, Speaker B: Wait a second, wait a second. Isn't that the place do Kwan was just found late last week, a Friday of last week, and you are there, too.
00:01:10.344 - 00:01:20.840, Speaker A: I was at the same airport that Do Kwan was at, like, five days ahead of me. Yeah, I'm on the hunt for Do Kwan. That's what I'm doing.
00:01:22.170 - 00:01:36.186, Speaker B: People don't know right now whether you're joking or what's going on, but we'll just let the mystery continue. We got some topics of the week. Number one, there is a CFTC versus Binance battle. Binance getting busted by the CFTC. We're going to dig into that. What else?
00:01:36.208 - 00:01:53.422, Speaker A: David zkevm continues. We got two of them this week. Last week we had one. This week we have they're doubling every week. Yeah, every week. So far, they have been doubling every single week for two weeks in a row. And then lastly, Gary Gensler to the principal's office.
00:01:53.422 - 00:01:56.706, Speaker A: Can we get Gary Gensler to the principal's office?
00:01:56.808 - 00:02:00.130, Speaker B: Wait, I thought he was the principal. You can bring him to another office.
00:02:00.280 - 00:02:12.390, Speaker A: There's the principal's. Principal, which he is now going to. Yeah. So he has been summoned to testify are these the right words in court about his actions against the crypto community?
00:02:12.540 - 00:02:14.210, Speaker B: In court? Is it in court?
00:02:14.370 - 00:02:30.550, Speaker A: No, not in court. Not in court. In front of the people, which is Congress Gary Gensler to face Congress grilling over crypto policy. Gary Gensler will testify before the House Financial Services Committee. Okay, so Gary Gensler is testifying in front of the House about his treatment of us. There we go. Those are the details.
00:02:30.710 - 00:02:34.398, Speaker B: I'm here for a good gensler grilling. I'm here for it. Let's do it.
00:02:34.484 - 00:02:37.678, Speaker A: Product market fit. Exactly what I want.
00:02:37.844 - 00:02:49.858, Speaker B: Speaking of product market fit, we got to talk about our friends over at infura because they have an API, NFT API that I think has some product market fit. David, tell us about it. This one's for the devs, isn't it?
00:02:49.944 - 00:02:58.198, Speaker A: Yeah, this is for the devs. So this is an SDK for an API for your NFT. DAP, if you will. So whether you and if you don't.
00:02:58.204 - 00:02:59.960, Speaker B: Know what that means, you're not a Dev.
00:03:00.730 - 00:03:36.434, Speaker A: So just absorb this knowledge through Osmosis I'll brute force it into your brain. So Infuria has got an SDK for you, the NFT builder out there, whether you are doing most of the things that NFT contracts do, selling an NFT, buying an NFT, minting an NFT. Infuria has got an SDK for you to make that easy for you. Three smart contract templates to allow you to write onto eight different blockchains and mint NFTs. Either ERC, 720 ones or one one five tokens to really expedite the building of your NFT. Process your NFT application. There is a link in the show notes for you to get started.
00:03:36.434 - 00:03:42.750, Speaker A: You can sign up an account with Infira to get started. Or you could just go to bankless CC slash Infira.
00:03:42.910 - 00:03:47.394, Speaker B: There it is. Will it help me shill an NFT? That's another verb that's often used.
00:03:47.432 - 00:03:52.194, Speaker A: Hey, we all start somewhere. But that's not in specifically the API.
00:03:52.322 - 00:03:59.770, Speaker B: Okay. Can't help you shell. Can help you do everything else, though. Click the link in the show notes. Guys, got to get to the markets. David, what is Bitcoin telling us on the week?
00:03:59.920 - 00:04:11.820, Speaker A: Bitcoin down half a percent, which I consider flat. So started the week at 28,000 ish currently or 28,700? Currently at 28,420.
00:04:13.230 - 00:04:17.082, Speaker B: Flat week for bitcoin on the week, I'll take a flat. How about ETH?
00:04:17.226 - 00:04:29.234, Speaker A: ETH down 2.3% on the week. Started the week at one $825. Currently at mean all this not bad considering right?
00:04:29.272 - 00:04:36.434, Speaker B: Not considering US dollar price on freight. Yeah, interesting. I think we'll get into that in a little bit. How about the ratio? What's that saying? On the week?
00:04:36.472 - 00:04:47.830, Speaker A: Also flat down 2%. So zero point 63. So I believe the third consecutive week of a down ratio price, bitcoin still has that strength. Bitcoin.
00:04:49.530 - 00:04:51.770, Speaker B: How about total crypto market cap?
00:04:51.840 - 00:04:55.530, Speaker A: We one point twenty three trillion dollars. One, two, three.
00:04:55.680 - 00:05:00.246, Speaker B: Not too bad. Look, I consider all of this a win in this economic environment.
00:05:00.358 - 00:05:00.790, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:00.880 - 00:05:01.470, Speaker B: Bear market.
00:05:01.540 - 00:05:27.326, Speaker A: Right. Just like hopefully this is not only narrative. Hopefully there was actually real new buyers of Bitcoin since the last banking crisis. The worst case scenario would be that it was just sidelined crypto traders who had a bunch of stable coins, who then decided to buy on the narrative that real buyers would be coming. That's what we don't want to be true. What we do want to be true is bankers were like Bitcoin.
00:05:27.518 - 00:05:32.914, Speaker B: Okay, I think that's probably still early. I think it's all still the same recycled buyers.
00:05:32.962 - 00:05:35.126, Speaker A: But that's how all of these things start.
00:05:35.308 - 00:05:52.098, Speaker B: I know that's still the bear case, but it doesn't mean that they're wrong right now. And you have to start somewhere. And you always start with that foundation of existing buyers who are like, I'm a little scared I'm going to stablecoins, and then they buy back in. I think this might be the story as to why. David. And this to me, looks like fundamentals. This is from Jim Bianco.
00:05:52.098 - 00:06:27.506, Speaker B: This is the Fed's updated balance sheet. You can see the numbers here. Now, two thirds of the quantitative tightening has been reversed. So over the course of starting in 2021, all the way to up till March, the Fed had been actually, sorry, from March of 2022 or so up till 2023, a full year, the Fed had been tightening. They had been destroying assets on the balance sheet, decreasing the balance sheet, I should say. And it went from like $9 trillion all the way to 8.35 trillion.
00:06:27.506 - 00:06:34.730, Speaker B: So they got $700 billion in decrease in the Fed balance sheet. And then what happened, David?
00:06:35.470 - 00:07:04.082, Speaker A: Then $500 billion came back inside of two weeks. So nice try, Fed. You guys really did your best. And Ryan, you said the Fed was able in the last year, again, the interest rate started March 2022. Now we are in March 2023, one year. So we had a good old try, a good old fashioned Fed try, college try, good old college try. We started at basically $9 trillion.
00:07:04.082 - 00:07:24.794, Speaker A: So when you said we shaved off $700 billion, we started from $9 trillion. So $700 billion is a lot of money. It's quite a lot of money. We started from $9 trillion. We got down to basically $8.3 trillion. And then in the last, it took us a year to go from 9 trillion to 8.3
00:07:24.794 - 00:07:31.942, Speaker A: trillion. And now it took us two weeks to go from 8.3 trillion to 8.7 trillion, 75 trillion.
00:07:32.086 - 00:07:33.558, Speaker B: David, this seems to be the big debate.
00:07:33.574 - 00:07:34.902, Speaker A: You had a good run, Fed.
00:07:35.046 - 00:08:14.858, Speaker B: Well, there's still some debate here. So a lot of people are still saying, including Ben Hunt, who we had on the podcast as part of kind of, are the banks insolvent? Is the dollar going to hyperinflate? Says this spike right here is just temporary. He always uses the analogy of, like, you inject liquidity right into the heart, right? This is kind of the wake up the patient kind of needle, and then it goes back down eventually, whereas bology, Arthur Hayes say this is permanent. And by the way, this spike, you ain't seen nothing yet. This is going to continue to increase. bology is like, in 90 days. This is going to be massive, whereas Arthur Hayes thinks it will take years.
00:08:14.858 - 00:08:23.990, Speaker B: Jim Bianco gave us a pretty recent take, I feel like was kind of in the middle. Wait and see. How would you summarize Jim Bianco's take from our episode earlier this week?
00:08:24.160 - 00:08:41.858, Speaker A: Jim Bianco is towards the Ben Hunt end of the spectrum. So I would say bology and arthur Hayes are actually pretty close to each other in terms of their position. Like, biology is saying 90 days until Bitcoin is $1 million, which is very fast. Arthur Hayes saying two years to a million dollars, which is still very fast.
00:08:42.024 - 00:08:46.230, Speaker B: Ben Hunt, two years, maybe a million is on the table in two years. Yeah.
00:08:46.300 - 00:09:18.158, Speaker A: Ben Hunt is like that's complete noise and ridiculousness and actually totally irresponsible. And Jim Bianco is less emotional, I'd say, than Ben Hunt is, but still directionally agrees with Ben Hunt saying that, yes. This line that we are looking at on the screen is extremely vertical. We just erased two years of rising interest rates. Think of all the pain in the market that we've had for the last year excuse me, year of interest rates. Think about the pain that we've had. And then we just erased all of that progress from the Fed's perspective inside of two weeks.
00:09:18.158 - 00:09:54.230, Speaker A: Jim Bianco says, okay, but this spike that we've had is not systemic. It doesn't mean the same amount of QE and liquidity injection that Stimmy checks do. And so this is much more contained, compartmentalized to just the banking sector, and it's not going to leak out to the actual bank accounts. Know, mom and Pop and Joe and Alice. Right. And so I think this is actually of those four interviews that we did, and damn, did we really try and get down to the bottom of this? And I feel like we did with Jim Bianco.
00:09:54.310 - 00:10:19.266, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel closure on this, honestly. I went in being like, let's get two sides of the story here. And what we ultimately ended up getting is like, four different perspectives, which is actually closer to reality. I mean, things are complicated. Real life is complicated. And so getting all of those four perspectives kind of, yeah, I feel closure on it. Anyway, this is another piece of the macro story here.
00:10:19.266 - 00:10:50.554, Speaker B: This is Elf saying the same thing. Macro elf, that is. It took 215 years for the US to reach 7 trillion in debt. This is he's zooming out here. Then it took only 27 months, March 2020 to June 2022, to add another 7,000,000,000,215 years to get to the first 7 trillion. David and then 27 months to get to the next 7 trillion. This is, of course, all of the outstanding debt from COVID This is the big jump right here in these 27 months.
00:10:50.554 - 00:11:01.722, Speaker B: This is the big story, I think, here of, like, if you zoom out a little bit, even past the two year mark, look how large and how fast the Fed balance sheet has actually grown.
00:11:01.866 - 00:11:11.426, Speaker A: Yeah. He also finishes that tweet saying, debt is not a bug of our credit based money system. It's actually a feature. What does he mean by that? I'm confused by that.
00:11:11.528 - 00:11:15.762, Speaker B: I think he's saying central banks are kind of designed to do this. This is what they do.
00:11:15.896 - 00:11:34.202, Speaker A: I mean, this is the nature of compound interest, right? So when you see an exponential curve like that, I don't think it should be totally foreign that this is happening. Because when you inflate a currency at 2% per year, this is actually the same shape of the chart that it would look like. This is certainly more than 2% per year, but this is what happens.
00:11:34.336 - 00:12:16.694, Speaker B: Did you listen to so Ben Hunt's strongest point to me is like, you can have a hard money bitcoin type of or ethereum type of monetary system because what you lose is credit. You lose the ability to pool social credit together. And that's what a fiat regime brings. And by the way, he would argue the last 150 years of economic prosperity, everything we enjoy in a modern economy is because we have that social credit, we have that trust. And so he really rejects the idea that we would kind of go back in time and reestablish things. So that's his take. And I think maybe Macroef was saying something similar.
00:12:16.694 - 00:12:41.290, Speaker B: Debt is not a bug of our credit based money system. It's a feature. Right? How else do you get credit, David, in kind of a hard money, hard asset regime? That's the question Ben Hunt posed. And I understand elements of that. And Jim Bianco kind of echoed that and he's like, hey, banks actually play. This is bankless, but banks play a function. Did you know the function that they play is not as a data, is not as a money warehouse? That's kind of stupid.
00:12:41.290 - 00:12:58.806, Speaker B: I mean, we can hold our own private keys. We don't have to warehouse our money inside of know, Wells Fargo. But the role that they do play is like small community credit creation. And that is a role that right now DeFi and cryptos is not fulfilling. And there is some role for banks in that world. So I understand that perspective too.
00:12:58.908 - 00:14:02.234, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the thought experiment to really understand this metaphor that Ben Hunt was saying was that, say we have a bitcoin standard. You could have a bank that have bitcoin that has bitcoin deposits, that operates on a fractional reserve system. So they take in ten bitcoins and then they lend out 100 bitcoins and then they charge interest rates to get that back. In theory, you could still get credit in a bitcoin system if you had just like a bitcoin bank that denominated in bitcoin and did the whole fractional reserve thing. That's technically still possible. The reason why the economics would still be different is that in the bitcoin banking system with a bitcoin standard, with bitcoin credit, you actually don't have a Federal Reserve which can mint bitcoins on the other side to backstop banks if something goes wrong. And so even in a bitcoin banking system, you still have much more credit risk because, again, if the bank goes insolvent, you have somebody who can print bitcoins on the other side, which allows for more credit at lower interest rates, therefore more investment in the future, therefore, ultimately, more debt on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to happen.
00:14:02.432 - 00:14:27.630, Speaker B: Yeah, this is my question. Look at this chart, David. So this central bank chart, how does this chart compete against this chart? Something like this. Crypto economics, by the way, for those directions not seen in podcast, just listening to this. So the Fed balance sheet is obviously spiking up, expanding at a precipitous rate. And I just pulled up ultrasound money, which is ethereum supply decreasing.
00:14:28.130 - 00:14:30.690, Speaker A: Those charts look inverted to each other.
00:14:30.760 - 00:14:45.078, Speaker B: So which do you want to hold? Do you want to hold Treasuries in the dollar or do you want to hold this thing? That's what I don't think central bankers have fully calculated that. Now, there is another option, a better option, and we do get to have both.
00:14:45.244 - 00:14:58.938, Speaker A: We want to, as individuals, hold ether because of its deflationary properties and its store of value over the long term. And as a society, we also want fiat so we can get a home loan, for example.
00:14:59.104 - 00:15:02.058, Speaker B: Both are good, both have their I.
00:15:02.064 - 00:15:03.262, Speaker A: Think you can totally have both.
00:15:03.316 - 00:15:04.654, Speaker B: Yeah, but I'm not holding this one.
00:15:04.692 - 00:15:13.086, Speaker A: I'm not holding dollars, though. I have a home loan. I have debt in dollars. I love debt in dollars.
00:15:13.188 - 00:15:24.178, Speaker B: Oh, don't you? Isn't it great? You ever look at your mortgage and you're just like, oh my God, that is just inflating away. That is getting less expensive over time.
00:15:24.264 - 00:15:24.562, Speaker A: Right?
00:15:24.616 - 00:15:25.390, Speaker B: Fantastic.
00:15:25.470 - 00:15:32.054, Speaker A: Meanwhile, we've got ether on the other side. That is a beautiful symbiosis for you. It is definitely for me.
00:15:32.092 - 00:15:53.286, Speaker B: I don't know what it does to society. I mean, this is what we're grappling with. This is Chris Berninski's take on this whole thing, David, which is he says this maybe this kind of sums up the discussion. We've had a number of people asking me what I think about in the context of the current banking crisis. Regulatory fights, bology's bet and so on. So here it goes. Current banking crisis is bullish for crypto.
00:15:53.286 - 00:16:25.190, Speaker B: Long run, short term, we're likely in the eye of the storm, so expect volatility. But the banking cris has been a monetary induced policy too much, too fast with rate hikes and will be solved by monetary policy. Fed and other central banks will drop rates, perhaps even this year, as the market is now anticipating, which will allow existing bonds to rally. And voila, banks that are currently struggling will have healthy balance sheets. Again, in quotes, this banking crisis is also more likely to cause disinflation than hyperinflation. In Chris's opinion, credit is drying up. That's interesting.
00:16:25.190 - 00:17:03.618, Speaker B: Btfp isn't the same as Stimmies. Stimmies went straight to consumer spending, whereas Btfp is shoring up bank balance sheets, which is likely to just sit there. But this inflation will give the Fed and the other central banks cover to lower rates and that will breathe air back into the fire of growth stocks and crypto, turning to regulation and crypto, and then he ends with this. As for biology's, bet, I don't take him literally, but more as directionally alerting. People in this distracted day and age, sometimes you need to do severe things to get people's attention. He's done that. But as I said earlier, I think disinflation from here is more likely than hyperinflation, at least for the coming years.
00:17:03.618 - 00:17:24.106, Speaker B: Really interesting take here is bology was kind of being intentionally MEMATIC about this and the bit signal, 90 days, million dollar bitcoin. Bet that was him intentionally kind of being hyperbolic about this.
00:17:24.208 - 00:17:27.082, Speaker A: He said he wasn't he said he wasn't doing that.
00:17:27.216 - 00:17:28.186, Speaker B: Yeah, I know.
00:17:28.288 - 00:17:32.458, Speaker A: He said on the podcast that this is not him doing a marketing stunt.
00:17:32.554 - 00:17:45.210, Speaker B: Yeah, well, so another reasonable take from Chris, and I guess we'll see. We are, what, 80 days left. 75 days left. Speaking of upcoming dates, what do we got happening pretty soon, David?
00:17:45.370 - 00:18:03.346, Speaker A: We got withdrawals happening pretty soon, Ryan. Ether withdrawals coming. The date is April. What's the date? If you scroll down, I can read it up because I don't have it memorized. April twelveTH. April twelveTH. And so LSD tokens are getting a nice little bump in their price because of the incoming Shanghai upgrade.
00:18:03.346 - 00:18:14.378, Speaker A: So this is when we can, as validators, withdraw our ether and ether just gets violently sold into the market and ether goes to zero. Crashes. Yeah, that's what happens next.
00:18:14.464 - 00:18:23.710, Speaker B: Well, what do you think is going to happen at withdraw? It's up or down? Price go up, number go down. What do you think? Flat. Flat? Yeah. Staking tokens going up first.
00:18:23.780 - 00:18:50.066, Speaker A: Flat. Maybe for a week, maybe for two weeks. And then people will realize that it was quite literally a bullish unlock in the sense that the stakers just aren't dumping their ether because stakers are inherently bullish ether. And then people will realize that everyone that hasn't bought ether in the last month because they're fearful of the staking withdrawal unlock are going to be like, oh, it's over and the stakers didn't sell. Well, I'll guess I'll buy back my ether.
00:18:50.178 - 00:18:55.670, Speaker B: And then David thinks the unlock will be bullish. It'll be flat bullish.
00:18:56.090 - 00:18:57.874, Speaker A: Flat for a week ish and then bullish.
00:18:57.922 - 00:19:02.934, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't have a strong opinion on that, so I'll just take yours. Sounds good. David. Tell me about Arbitrum.
00:19:02.982 - 00:19:07.930, Speaker A: Are you surprised that my conclusion is that it's bullish? Are you surprised about that opinion?
00:19:09.310 - 00:19:10.214, Speaker B: I'm not, David.
00:19:10.262 - 00:19:11.390, Speaker A: I'm not surprised.
00:19:13.250 - 00:19:16.926, Speaker B: Let's talk about Arbitrum, though. So they had a token launch. Was that last week?
00:19:17.028 - 00:19:23.630, Speaker A: Token went out the market last week before launched. Last week it was announced two weeks ago it was launched.
00:19:23.970 - 00:19:36.110, Speaker B: It's all blurring to me. Arbitrum total locked value jumped a nice $2 billion. You can see it in the charts on layer two beat. And there was also some reports of AirDrop farming. What is this? Tweet. David.
00:19:36.190 - 00:19:57.462, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is a tweet of what looks like just one device emulating what looks like hundreds of devices, and I can only assume processing transactions on Arbitrum. So this is what a modern day AirDrop farm looks like. I'm still yet to see an analysis, a report of the farmed nature of the ARB AirDrop.
00:19:57.606 - 00:20:04.080, Speaker B: Like 600,000 addresses, and we don't know what percentage of them might be farmed. Hopefully it's low. But you're worried that it might be?
00:20:04.530 - 00:20:31.414, Speaker A: I'm sure the efforts of the Arbitrum AirDrop curation like the criteria pruned away like 90% of at least 90% of the AirDrop farmers efforts. But 90% they need to have. Well, it is what it is. Ideally, they would prune away 100. Pruning away 100 is damn near impossible. How close to 100 did they get is the million dollar question. And I have yet to see an answer to that question.
00:20:31.414 - 00:20:34.840, Speaker A: How successful were AirDrop farmers? We do not know the answer to that.
00:20:35.770 - 00:20:43.926, Speaker B: Decentralized exchanges seem to be recently successful. This is Hayden Adams tweeting dex versus centralized exchange. I don't know to say sex.
00:20:44.038 - 00:20:45.446, Speaker A: You're not going to say sex?
00:20:45.638 - 00:20:53.546, Speaker B: Dex versus sex volume is at an all time high of 25% since the FTX collapse. Pretty incredible.
00:20:53.658 - 00:20:56.270, Speaker A: On the back of new all time high.
00:20:56.340 - 00:21:06.286, Speaker B: Decentralized exchanges are crushing it. This is a tweet about have you ever wondered, David, how much ETH is just lost forever as a I have, actually.
00:21:06.388 - 00:21:08.354, Speaker A: I actually wonder about that quite a lot.
00:21:08.472 - 00:21:12.066, Speaker B: Okay, well, this is Connor, and he's got the answer for you. You want to read this?
00:21:12.168 - 00:21:33.186, Speaker A: Thanks, Connor. Connor says, I've categorized thousands of instances of Ethereum typos, user errors, and buggy contracts. Thus far I've found 636,000 Ether, about $1.15 billion that is lost forever, and I'm assuming verifiably lost forever, which is about half a percent of the circulating supply.
00:21:33.378 - 00:21:34.346, Speaker B: That's a lot.
00:21:34.448 - 00:21:36.618, Speaker A: That's not a small amount. That's not a small amount.
00:21:36.704 - 00:21:40.250, Speaker B: And you could see where he came up with some of these numbers. The parity wallet bug alone.
00:21:41.950 - 00:21:43.190, Speaker A: That sucks.
00:21:43.350 - 00:21:46.190, Speaker B: Yeah, that's almost like 0.5% alone.
00:21:46.530 - 00:21:53.762, Speaker A: That's a good piece of Ethereum history lore that I bet you a lot of 2021 crypto people don't know too much about.
00:21:53.896 - 00:21:56.180, Speaker B: Oh, okay. Well, why don't you tell them?
00:21:57.030 - 00:22:38.270, Speaker A: Oh, God, it's such a crazy story, man. So there was this library of code. This is stretching my developer's technical ability to tell this story, but there was this library, code based library or something, and a junior dev on the Parity team was messing around with it and sent this very infamous message to, I think, inside the Parity slack that says something along the lines of, oops, I accidentally killed it. He accidentally deleted the code library or something, which basically froze the multi SIG for Parity. Parity was a consensus client that didn't how did they get all that Ether?
00:22:38.930 - 00:22:42.938, Speaker B: That wasn't an I thought this was the polka dot raise.
00:22:43.034 - 00:22:44.234, Speaker A: Was this the polka dot raise?
00:22:44.282 - 00:22:55.426, Speaker B: Yeah, right. My memory of this is this is a polka dot raise. They basically put it in a wallet, like a multi SIG type, early prototype, smart contract type wallet. And there was a bug in that.
00:22:55.448 - 00:22:59.050, Speaker A: Wasn'T diagnosis safe, it was their own custom made multi SIG.
00:22:59.150 - 00:23:06.786, Speaker B: Yes. And the bug caused a billion dollars worth of ETH now to be stranded there forever and locked forever.
00:23:06.978 - 00:23:09.900, Speaker A: Yeah. The message is, I think I killed it.
00:23:10.270 - 00:23:21.002, Speaker B: That is terrible. Unfortunate. But that means 0.5%, which isn't even included in the ultrasound money chart of ETH, is probably locked forever. And it's getting that's going to increase over time.
00:23:21.056 - 00:23:21.482, Speaker A: That much.
00:23:21.536 - 00:23:24.510, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, David, what do we have coming up next?
00:23:24.660 - 00:24:00.866, Speaker A: Coming up next, we got the big news of the week. Gary Gensler goes to the principal's office, which I'm sure everyone would love to talk about that, but first we're going to have to talk about Binance getting busted by the CFTC, and we'll give our takes about that. How serious of a deal that is. Zke EVMs an oiler update. SBF managed to get in trouble again, so we'll talk about that and more. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible, especially Kraken, our recommended crypto exchange. Because Kraken has been here for twelve years, and I can only assume they're going to be for at least twelve years more, if not the entire rest of crypto.
00:24:00.866 - 00:24:39.282, Speaker A: Which is why, if you are unsure about your centralized exchange, perhaps you should sign up with Kraken. There's a link in the show notes. Here we go. Kraken has been a leader in the crypto industry for the last twelve years. Dedicated to accelerating the global adoption of crypto, kraken puts an emphasis on security, transparency and client support, which is why over 9 million clients have come to love Kraken's products. Whether you're a beginner or a pro, the Kraken UX is simple, intuitive, and frictionless, making the Kraken app a great place for all to get involved and learn about crypto. For those with experience, the redesigned Kraken Pro app and Web experience is completely customizable to your trading needs, integrating key trading features into one seamless interface.
00:24:39.282 - 00:25:11.742, Speaker A: Kraken has a 24 7365 client support team that is globally recognized. Kraken support is available wherever, whenever you need them by phone, chat or email. And for all of you Nfters out there, the brand new Kraken NFT Beta platform gives you the best NFT trading experience possible. Rarity rankings, no gas fees, and the ability to buy an NFT straight with cash. Does your crypto exchange prioritize its customers the way that Kraken does? And if not, sign up with Kraken@kraken.com slash Bankless. How many total airdrops have you gotten? This last bull market had a ton of them.
00:25:11.742 - 00:25:36.870, Speaker A: Did you get them all? Maybe you missed one. So here's what you should do. Go to Earnify and plug in your Ethereum wallet. And Earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed Airdrops that you can get. And it also does Poaps and mintable NFTs any kind of money that your wallet can claim, earnify will tell you about it. And you should probably do it now because some Airdrops expire. And if you sign up for Earnify, they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new AirDrop for it to make sure that you never lose an AirDrop ever again.
00:25:36.870 - 00:25:55.322, Speaker A: You can also upgrade to Earnify premium to unlock access to Airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets. And for just under $21 a month, it probably pays for itself with just one AirDrop. So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get that's ear NiFi and make sure you never lose another AirDrop.
00:25:55.386 - 00:26:07.026, Speaker B: Binance gets Busted david, the CFTC sued Binance over what they say are regulatory violations. This is a press release from the CFTC. What is going on here?
00:26:07.128 - 00:27:10.280, Speaker A: Yeah, so the CFTC has filed a civil enforcement action charging CZ and three entities that operate the Binance platform with numerous violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and other CFTC regulations. So this complaint charges that Binance Holdings Limited, binance Holdings, Ie Limited, and Binance Services Holdings Limited together. Binance. Man, that's a lot of entities and that's not all of them operate the Binance centralized digital asset trading platform along with number of other corporate vehicles through an intentionally opaque common enterprise with CD at the helm as Binance's. Owner and Chief Executive Officer. The defendants allegedly chose to knowingly disregard applicable provisions of the Commodities Enforcement Act while engaging in a calculated strategy of regulatory arbitrage to their commercial benefit. Okay, let me summarize that TLDR CFTC is suing Binance and CZ on allegations that the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products inside the United States against federal law.
00:27:10.810 - 00:27:15.586, Speaker B: A crypto derivative is like a future or something. They didn't get the CFTC's blessing.
00:27:15.698 - 00:27:50.690, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah. Directed US customers to evade compliance controls through VPNs, poorly supervised its business, didn't implement KYC or AML processes, and also had a poor anti evasion program. And also they never registered as a compliant Futures Commission's merchant. And so, the CFTC, in continuing litigation against its defendants, the agency seeks disgorgement civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations.
00:27:51.510 - 00:27:57.874, Speaker B: This is interesting, David. This is not a charge of fraud. Seems like it's. Basically, you didn't follow the rules.
00:27:57.922 - 00:27:59.158, Speaker A: You did not follow the rules, you.
00:27:59.164 - 00:28:32.334, Speaker B: Didn'T file the paperwork and register for your derivatives products, and you didn't do the AML KYC stuff that is required by US financial law. The CFTC, this is not like an SBF, you're running a Ponzi scheme, the assets aren't backed type of charge. I don't even think it's the same type of charge that Bitfinex was charged with, which was some of this, but wasn't there also BitMEX BitMEX excuse. Me.
00:28:32.372 - 00:28:36.714, Speaker A: Well, BitMEX was charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act, which is a massive deal.
00:28:36.852 - 00:28:41.140, Speaker B: Right. So what does all this mean? What's your take on this?
00:28:41.590 - 00:29:10.038, Speaker A: Well, there's some other things in this report as well. So there's a link in the show notes to read the report. There are some pretty damning things. And so here's a link. There is a thread of we are looking at one tweet in a very long thread of a summary of this report. And so I'll read this one tweet to kind of indicate the more egregious side of things instead of just like, failing to do KYC and registering. So, reading from the report here internally, finance officers, employees, and agents have acknowledged that the finance platform has facilitated potentially illegal activities.
00:29:10.038 - 00:30:09.562, Speaker A: For example, in February 2019, after receiving information regarding Hamas transactions on finance, lim, a finance executive, explained to a colleague that tariffs usually send small sums, as large sums constitute money laundering. So they send small money through finance because they don't want to send large money, because large money triggers the flags. So the colleague replied, you can barely buy an AK 47 with $600. And with regard to certain finance customers, including customers from Russia, lim acknowledged that in a February 2022 chat, they, quote is like, come on, they are here for crime finance's. M-L-R-O-I don't know what that is. Agreed that we see the bad, but we close two eyes. And so the more direct charge that's being made here is binance was the host of a very significant amount of money laundering, and they just completely were aware of that and just looked the other way, maybe, perhaps, obviously totally willingly.
00:30:09.562 - 00:30:20.562, Speaker A: So that's the more damning charge that's going on here. Yeah, and I also don't think that's any surprise to anyone in the crypto industry without any evidence. I totally assume that that's what's going on.
00:30:20.696 - 00:30:55.230, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just interesting. I guess the posture here is, okay, CFTC understood, but at the same time they're going after Binance, they're also going after, not the CFTC, but US regulators. They're going after coinbase. I mean, we just talked about that last week, like shutting down Coinbase, staking the Wells notice to Coinbase from the SEC. And I know that Coinbase is much more thorough being US located on so, you know, I don't know. I understand it. I understand why the CFTC is doing this.
00:30:55.230 - 00:30:58.474, Speaker B: What is Binance's response to this complaint?
00:30:58.522 - 00:31:40.422, Speaker A: Yeah, so CZ made a response to the CFTC complaint. So I'll just read the first two sentences here. Today, the CFTC filed an unexpected and disappointing civil complaint. Despite our working cooperatively with the CFTC for over two years. Upon an initial review, the complaint appears to contain an incomplete recitation of facts, and we do not agree with the characterization of many of the issues alleged in the complaint. Basically, CEC is saying they're going to fight back. I'll assert again, and I'll say without evidence that with talking with me, he and my friends, and the chats that we have, everyone kind of assumes that CZ and Binance was allowing a bunch of money laundering to process through their change.
00:31:40.422 - 00:32:20.502, Speaker A: I know a friend perhaps that has logged into Binance while under a VPN, while Binance has not been allowing US customers and was still able to trade under on Binance. That is like an open thing that the industry has been doing, americans has been doing. We've all known that that's an easy and trivial thing to do. You just use a VPN, I'm just saying this is what my friend did, would use a VPN and then get in and get out. And that's been an open secret that the entire industry has known. So I don't think anyone is surprised that a bunch of illegal money laundering has been going through Binance. And so the fact that this is happening is no surprise to me and I think an inevitable conclusion today's.
00:32:20.502 - 00:32:42.878, Speaker A: Finally the day and the bullcase for this is that Binance pays a fine, they settle with the CFTC and maybe even gets the green light to they can argue some of the things like permanent dismantling or whatever, they can fight that in court. But hopefully this actually starts a conversation which makes Binance perhaps more jurisdictionally friendly with us.
00:32:42.964 - 00:33:49.738, Speaker B: It's very interesting to me because I guess because they have the power to do AML KYC checks and because they have sort of the big red button to ban someone or to allow them to stop logging in, that they're now responsible for that. Which is very interesting. And as a contrast to like a DeFi protocol right, which has no control over these things, the uniswap code base, it has no ability to differentiate the money, the identity, anything else. And I guess if you are this also, not only does it sort of push some of these centralized platforms to button up, which is what you were saying, pay the fee and then button up. I think that's probably the hopeful outcome that Binance would have. It also pushes things more towards decentralized protocols where no one has the ability to do the AML KYC ban someone push the button where it's kind of completely open and the CFTC can't go I guess maybe they can try to sanction code next, right. Which is what they did with CFTC.
00:33:49.774 - 00:33:51.622, Speaker A: Didn'T try, but the powers that be did.
00:33:51.676 - 00:33:54.438, Speaker B: Yeah, interesting stuff. Interesting stuff.
00:33:54.604 - 00:34:19.422, Speaker A: Okay, two more bits of news on this thread is that in the lawsuit, the CFTC versus Binance holding clearly states that Bitcoin, Ether and litecoin are all commodities. The implication of this is that perhaps on an alternative world, the SEC might have sued someone else saying that these things were securities, but the CFTC is saying they're commodities, which is like this is a proxy war between they just stuck that in there and the SEC. Yeah, right. Yeah.
00:34:19.476 - 00:34:22.222, Speaker B: You think Gary gensler read that and was like, just pissed off?
00:34:22.356 - 00:34:25.586, Speaker A: I'm sure he read it on twitter. Yeah, in his mentions. Yeah.
00:34:25.768 - 00:34:43.078, Speaker B: David, the war on crypto seems like it is continuing. There was an economic report from the president that came out last week and they had an entire chapter this is like 90 pages called digital assets relearning economic principles. It's kind of like, oh, do you.
00:34:43.084 - 00:34:45.410, Speaker A: Mean learning the world of money and finance?
00:34:45.570 - 00:35:00.730, Speaker B: No, relearning economic principles is what it was called. I read parts of this, not the entire thing, but it felt like 90 pages of just FUD being like, okay, so let me offer you an example.
00:35:00.800 - 00:35:02.026, Speaker A: Quote read this, did you?
00:35:02.128 - 00:35:03.642, Speaker B: I skimmed it to date.
00:35:03.696 - 00:35:04.214, Speaker A: Wow.
00:35:04.352 - 00:35:43.894, Speaker B: Cryptocurrencies don't offer any fundamental value, nor are they a better alternative to fiat money or more effective payment system. Instead their innovation has been mostly about creating artificial scarcity in order to support crypto assets prices. And of course, the conclusion, David, the report continues, is that the nation's financial infrastructure has the potential to offer these same benefits. They're basically like, yeah, that crypto thing is a scam. Ponzi's get rich quick. And what people should be using is our central bank digital currency, our existing financial system. There is no need for cryptocurrency.
00:35:43.894 - 00:35:53.450, Speaker B: It's just a bunch of grifters and scammers. And the real solution that they're looking for is of course the fedcoin, the central bank digital currency. That is the conclusion of this report.
00:35:53.600 - 00:36:02.880, Speaker A: Hey, man, water's wet, sky's blue. You and I are bullish ether. And the United States wants you to use the dollar. This is just what it is.
00:36:03.410 - 00:36:11.026, Speaker B: Look. Is it the United States? It's definitely the white house right now. I will say that maybe there are other factions of government, the powers that.
00:36:11.048 - 00:36:12.050, Speaker A: Be in the United States.
00:36:12.120 - 00:36:21.782, Speaker B: Yeah, this is Fred arisom 15%, he says of the annual white house report is devoted to crypto FUD. I have a question for you though.
00:36:21.836 - 00:36:24.006, Speaker A: Admirable that you even skimmed this thing.
00:36:24.108 - 00:37:04.450, Speaker B: I have a question for you though, David, which is something that's been on my mind lately the last two to three weeks as sort of the anti crypto and the pro crypto sides. Some of that argumentation has reached maybe a fever pitch, at least a local high. Do you think the US. Will ever make it illegal to own cryptocurrency? Like flat out ban you as a citizen, you must turn in your crypto kind of executive order 6102. You remember that where FDR banned gold. Basically you had to sell it back to the government. An individual American citizen could not own more than some amount of gold.
00:37:04.450 - 00:37:22.890, Speaker B: Basically melt down your jewelry, melt down your gold and sell it back to the feds. That's what actually happened in the early 1930s. And by the way, that law was in existence for like 40 years. Didn't get that reversed until the 1970s. Do you think that could happen with crypto?
00:37:23.230 - 00:37:24.842, Speaker A: No, absolutely not.
00:37:24.896 - 00:37:26.458, Speaker B: Why do you not think that?
00:37:26.544 - 00:37:29.500, Speaker A: Because we have a court of law, we will sue them.
00:37:30.030 - 00:37:37.450, Speaker B: It did happen in the United States in the 1930s and there were courts of laws. It's not like the 1930s didn't have courts of laws.
00:37:37.530 - 00:37:48.740, Speaker A: No executive. We're in a different society now. I happened to be outside of the United States, and if that law ever got passed, I would not be coming back.
00:37:50.870 - 00:38:09.218, Speaker B: Well, that's interesting. I haven't read much up on the kind of the 1930s. If similar gold hoarders made that choice. And by the way, that's what they were called, gold hoarders. This is sort of the vitriol, which is basically like, you're not a patriot, you're just hoarding. You're greedy.
00:38:09.314 - 00:38:15.014, Speaker A: You're defecting from the coordination. This is a public good. We need to all maintain our fiat currencies.
00:38:15.142 - 00:38:44.206, Speaker B: Exactly. Very anti kind of capitalist, anti. Sort of like do it for the public, do it for the social good. I guess what I'm seeing, David, is similar narrative sentiments starting Ben's Hunt pushback against bology, where he's know you're causing a bank run. bology by even saying this. And bology is saying, I'm just telling people to get to the lifeboats. Are you against lifeboats? If the ship isn't sinking, you have nothing to worry about, Ben.
00:38:44.206 - 00:39:07.386, Speaker B: And Ben is pointing at Balaji and saying, you're causing this. What about kind of the social good of keeping this system intact? We lose all of these things if everyone flees to the life wrap. I'm seeing the seeds of this this kind of idea of crypto hoarders. Crypto bros. I'm seeing it. So I don't know why you're so convinced this couldn't happen in the United States. I totally think it could.
00:39:07.386 - 00:39:16.814, Speaker B: I put a poll out, by the way, and I asked the question, will the US ever make it legal to own cryptocurrency? Followers on Twitter said no. 60%.
00:39:16.932 - 00:39:19.280, Speaker A: Yeah. This is surprisingly 40%.
00:39:19.970 - 00:39:26.578, Speaker B: 40. I just don't know why you think it's not possible. But you're just saying that society has is certainly possible.
00:39:26.664 - 00:39:41.878, Speaker A: But yes, it's a progression of society. It's a progression of technology. Things were more extreme back then. That was an extreme time in people's lives. Like pre internet times. Dude, we had, like, Nazism. That was an extreme time.
00:39:41.878 - 00:39:42.406, Speaker A: Right.
00:39:42.508 - 00:39:59.094, Speaker B: I think we are entering some pretty extreme not quite 1920s, 1930s level, like late 1920s. But things have gotten a lot more extreme than when I grew up in the think we've adapted as a society.
00:39:59.142 - 00:40:39.580, Speaker A: I think the Internet allows information to spread. It allows us to learn from history faster. I don't think it would be possible for us I'm reading a bit of history lately. I don't think it would be possible for us to have the 60 million deaths as a result of just like a mind virus of communism in Soviet Russia. Because if we had the Internet, I don't think that that would have been possible. I think when there's just imperfect information and just the way that the society worked back in those days, I think extreme circumstances were allowed to rise much more than in today's world.
00:40:39.950 - 00:41:03.162, Speaker B: Really? I totally think this is possible, this whole scenario. I totally think 60 million, 100 million deaths could happen in the 21st century. But that aside, let's talk about this specifically, which is the US could make it illegal to own cryptocurrency. I think the first step towards that wouldn't be just a flat out ban. It would be basically a choking off of fiat to crypto exchange.
00:41:03.226 - 00:41:04.080, Speaker A: There's other ways.
00:41:05.010 - 00:41:32.390, Speaker B: We're already seeing a little bit of that, David. We are one step down that path and the next step would be like, sure, you can buy crypto on an exchange or an ETF, but you can't withdraw to your like just take Coinbase, take Kraken. No more withdrawals to non. You can't that seems much more plausible to it's, basically. And then after that, the next step would be, if we ever get to this step, would be and by the way, bunch of crypto bro hoarders. Turn in your cryptocurrency.
00:41:32.470 - 00:41:35.338, Speaker A: Yeah, make it the legal version for sell.
00:41:35.424 - 00:41:38.940, Speaker B: You have to exchange it for this ETF version of it.
00:41:40.830 - 00:41:42.894, Speaker A: That seems slightly more plausible. I can see this.
00:41:42.932 - 00:42:19.174, Speaker B: I still think this is 10% probability, but if shit hits the fan yeah, I'm saying it depends on how dollars if central banks are actually threatened as they were in the 1930s, and then politicians and society sort of rallies around, yeah, we have to be in this together. It's like war times is bad times. You can't leave on the lifeboat. Right? Things get worse if everyone leaves on the lifeboat. I could see it happening, but maybe I'm being pessimistic here. Anyway, I wanted to have that conversation with you. I'm glad we had that.
00:42:19.292 - 00:42:22.860, Speaker A: Yeah. Now, I didn't know that I had to think about that, but now I do.
00:42:24.270 - 00:43:01.334, Speaker B: Let's take this to the courts. Crypto also has defenders, even outside of crypto. So, David, you said one of our recourses is the court system. Certainly the United States does have a court system. And this is a white paper courtesy of Cooper and Kirk, which is a law firm that is actually they previously sued the FDIC and the OCC and the Fed over Operation Chokepoint 10, which was the choking off of certain industries like marijuana industry from the banking system. And now they are alleging in this white paper that the US government is doing the same thing to crypto. What's the summary of this report?
00:43:01.532 - 00:43:56.390, Speaker A: Yeah, they sent a letter to US congress regarding the clandestine financial war against the cryptocurrency industry, urging Congress to hold agencies accountable and propose questions and steps to obtain answers. They are claiming that regulators are using regulatory tools and pressure tactics to prevent crypto integration to the financial system and that it's up to Congress to hold federal banking regulators accountable now. Ryan, I was not here during the time in which gold was made illegal, but I would imagine maybe there was stuff like this. Maybe I'm being naive, but this is an example of the pushback that comes very early and very hard by a very engaged community that perhaps I don't think we had way back then. And so this isn't any action. This is just a letter that is drafted by a law firm. But it is allowing the world, the people of the United States, to have foundation to stand on, to air their grievances.
00:43:56.730 - 00:44:13.534, Speaker B: Yep. It's basically executive branch is kind of forcing this. And we have two places we can go to fight it judicial, which is the court system, which is what they're attempting to do, and they're also calling on Congress to push back against it. Speaking of Congress, Gary Gensler, he's got to go in front of Congress. Is that what's happening?
00:44:13.652 - 00:44:24.010, Speaker A: Yeah. Gary Gensler to face Congress grilling over crypto policy is the headline. So Gary Gensler is going to testify before testify. Gary Gensler is going to testify.
00:44:24.170 - 00:44:26.078, Speaker B: Oh, man, she sound giddy.
00:44:26.254 - 00:45:01.270, Speaker A: Before the House Financial Services Committee, its chairman, Patrick McHenry, has confirmed that this is going to happen. This is going to happen on April 18, and he will face questions over his approach towards the crypto ecosystem. Gary is going into the hot seat. I'm sure he's going to prep for this. There's no way that he isn't cognizant and intentional about his strategy towards the crypto world. So I'm sure he's going to come with a pre prepared list of deflections, saying something like, he's already prepared list. I just look towards the Supreme Court for guidance.
00:45:01.270 - 00:45:05.454, Speaker A: I apply the rules of the securities laws that have been established before me.
00:45:05.492 - 00:45:09.246, Speaker B: I'm sure he's do you want to take a shot every time he says Howie test?
00:45:09.428 - 00:45:15.940, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, I mean, I don't want to die, but that's a fun game.
00:45:16.950 - 00:45:36.230, Speaker B: This is kind of interesting because I have observed this too. There does seem to be increased partisanship over crypto. I would not have said this two years ago that one party was more pro crypto than the other. It seemed sort of about even, and both were kind of like almost neutral on it. But that has started to change. What is this tweet that we've pulled up here?
00:45:36.300 - 00:46:16.622, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a tweet from Dennis Porter, who is a bitcoiner that we've actually had on bitlist before. And he tweets out pro crypto and pro bitcoin. Democrats are lining up to voice their opposition to their own party stance. Democrats are on the verge of driving away their own voters and losing support from this important new voter bloc. In my opinion, it could cost Democrats a 2024 election. And then there are screenshots of four crypto Twitter personas who are saying that they are perhaps reconsidering their previous Democratic base in support of the Republican party, if indeed the republican candidate was sufficiently pro crypto and I'm sure other facts and circumstances as well.
00:46:16.776 - 00:46:43.920, Speaker B: This is someone saying, I have never once voted for a Republican president but is considering this. This is also Chris Berninsky, whom we quoted earlier. Crypto is going to be an issue for voters in 2024 and already that is a sign of us winning. But I have also never seen the US government be so draconian. In fact, so long as it's not Trump, it may cause me to vote Republican for the first time in my life. This is very interesting. I know you have a weigh in on this too.
00:46:43.920 - 00:46:47.278, Speaker B: Okay, what's your take on this?
00:46:47.364 - 00:47:01.742, Speaker A: Yeah, so I am one of the four people that is being screenshotted and tweeted out by Dennis. And I said my entire family is Democrat. I was once considered myself a Democrat and now I kind of consider myself just politically agnostic.
00:47:01.886 - 00:47:02.670, Speaker B: Great party.
00:47:02.750 - 00:47:30.386, Speaker A: Great, great party. Yeah, that's a great way to put it. I was once a Bernie Bro. Because F hillary So I'm putting my political opinions out here. Sorry for that. I too would vote Republican for the first time given that it is the correct pro crypto candidate and also the Dems continued on the anti crypto war path. Since I'm here grandstanding about my political opinions, I also followed up this tweet with another tweet saying and that Republican would also have to be pro choice.
00:47:30.386 - 00:47:46.610, Speaker A: That's what I believe. And so for me, my personal political beliefs are that I'm almost a single issue voter for crypto. So long as that candidate is not an insane person, I will vote for the pro crypto candidate.
00:47:46.950 - 00:47:56.690, Speaker B: It's definitely making you question, right, previous political beliefs over this one thing and it could start to cost the Democrats. Is that a popular position in your family, David?
00:47:57.270 - 00:48:50.198, Speaker A: It is actually going back to Chris Berniski's tweet. I shared Chris Berniski's tweet in my family chat because my entire family is pretty thumbs up about Elizabeth Warren. And I just said, hey, guys, my entire industry thinks that Elizabeth Warren is super cringe and not treating us with respect and is actually doing the whole emperor's wearing no clothes thing because the way she talks about our industry is coming from a place of completely just misunderstanding and being uninformed about things. And it's making our entire industry not just question her stance and information about crypto, but basically her stance and information about any other industry. It's kind of like when you understand how the mainstream media reports on crypto and you're like, well, they just got that wrong. Is that how they report about everything? Because they're getting crypto wrong?
00:48:50.284 - 00:49:19.006, Speaker B: And so what about everything else? I think that's true, although I will say one thing is I think people are inherently skeptical of industry bias. Right? Sure. There's like big pharma, there's the gun lobby, all of these things, and big banking and big crypto that could be a thing. Crypto is not big crypto, but like crypto, bros, that sort of thing. To me this is less about an industry fighting for its ability to exist and survive. Although that's part of it. To me this goes far deeper than that.
00:49:19.006 - 00:49:26.420, Speaker B: This is like a basic American civil liberty to own freaking digital property, right?
00:49:27.750 - 00:49:30.290, Speaker A: Something that embodies American values.
00:49:31.350 - 00:50:21.166, Speaker B: This is deep the level of constitutional, this is freedom of speech, this is digital civil liberties. And to me this is not about one kind of party helping and getting donations from crypto or not or getting the crypto. This is just like why can't we all rally around this being like core to a Western classically liberal democracy that embodies human values and translates that for the digital age. That's what crypto is to me. I don't know if that's an effective argument on anyone in your family, but that's certainly what I believe and this is also increasingly what I think some politicians are giving voice to. So we had Tom Emmer on the podcast earlier this week, David, and I know, like you were on at the beginning, you had some internet connectivity and then you weren't able to fully established.
00:50:21.198 - 00:50:23.474, Speaker A: Here in Montenegro, dude, you should see.
00:50:23.512 - 00:50:25.010, Speaker B: How fired up he was.
00:50:25.080 - 00:50:27.060, Speaker A: I'm looking at the thumbnail, man.
00:50:27.910 - 00:51:06.686, Speaker B: Is this a thumbnail from the yes, that I think I saw that face. He is so fired up and we talked to him a year ago, so we talked to Tom Emmer a year ago and he's pro crypto. This time it was a different Tom Emmer, different politician. He clearly thinks that crypto is going to I don't know his motivation, but assume he's just kind of a politician going with the votes and that sort of thing. He clearly thinks that this is a cornerstone of his platform. And I think David, because he is the whip in the House, that is number two most powerful seat in the House of Representatives, I think this could become a platform for Republicans because the.
00:51:06.708 - 00:51:09.966, Speaker A: Democrats are letting them have it. For the Republicans, it's like this is.
00:51:09.988 - 00:51:23.190, Speaker B: Free real estate, basically and somebody's got to go get that cohort of votes and we have got a two party system so it's going to be either one party or the other. And by the way, the more one party embraces it, the more the other party has to be like, we're not those guys, right?
00:51:23.260 - 00:51:28.982, Speaker A: So that's just how they stand for that. We don't stand for that anyway.
00:51:29.116 - 00:51:41.162, Speaker B: I don't know how it's all going to unfold. It's really at its courts. It should be a bipartisan just American issue. But it does seem like the Republicans are kind of making this part of their platform. We'll see how that carries in 2024, right?
00:51:41.296 - 00:52:23.740, Speaker A: So when I was arguing with my sister is perhaps the leader of my family in the pro Warren side of things and she was like, yeah, you crypto bros, you think you don't need regulation? Like look what happened to crypto in the last year. And I'm like, are you serious? We are begging for regulation. And you're just touting what Elizabeth Warren is saying, she's trying to position us as these rogue, shadowy supercoders who don't want any regulation. And my response to her is like, no, you're doing the same thing that she is, which is misunderstanding and misrepresenting our industry and casting us off as these barbarians, crypto, like gunslingers, anarchists. Please regulate us. Please.
00:52:24.350 - 00:52:34.862, Speaker B: You're going to get clipped by this, by the way. Somebody's going to clip that. Please regulate us. David Hoffman. You were saying? Clarify before you get clipped on what you're actually saying.
00:52:34.996 - 00:53:02.802, Speaker A: If you can be regulated, if you are a centralized entity, if you are a bank, if somebody deposits trust into you, you are in need of regulation. If you are a decentralized protocol that is permissionless or also aspires to be permissionless and you need a path to become permissionless. I mean, regulation isn't just like clamping down the gates. It's also providing clarity and paths forward for crypto protocols to mature.
00:53:02.866 - 00:53:04.166, Speaker B: Paths forward, right, absolutely.
00:53:04.268 - 00:53:04.918, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:05.084 - 00:53:10.860, Speaker B: So internet, get the full clip. All right. Don't just clip David saying please regulate us.
00:53:11.550 - 00:53:16.870, Speaker A: Crypto bro, like screaming from bleeding from his eyeballs regulation.
00:53:16.950 - 00:53:17.718, Speaker B: Crying.
00:53:17.894 - 00:53:19.260, Speaker A: Crying. Yeah, right.
00:53:19.950 - 00:53:24.800, Speaker B: Well, you know what, Gary Gensler, you'll be happy to know, says David, the rules are already clear.
00:53:25.570 - 00:53:26.714, Speaker A: This is SEC's.
00:53:26.762 - 00:53:46.866, Speaker B: Gensler insisting clear rules for the crypto market already exist. But the regulator says the digital asset industry is rife with non compliance. You already have all of the rules in front of you. It's perfect clarity. I've already explained this to you in office hours with Gary. Your problem is you're just non compliant. That's what Gary says.
00:53:46.866 - 00:53:49.006, Speaker B: I can't wait to get thanks, Gary.
00:53:49.038 - 00:53:51.126, Speaker A: Meanwhile, looking forward for you testifying, by.
00:53:51.148 - 00:54:13.446, Speaker B: The way, in front of Emmer too. What's Emmer going to do? Get him, Tom. Okay, this is going on. In the meanwhile, David, this is just a contrast point. Maybe we'll end this section here. The freest country in the world, aka what America purports to be, is choking off crypto while Hong Kong is opening the floodgates. Did you see this? I am including a Bloomberg article.
00:54:13.446 - 00:54:54.006, Speaker B: Hong Kong regulators toast meetup to help crypto firms with banking. How you're just talking about like politicians filling the vacuum, free real estate, free space. Here is exactly what Hong Kong is doing coming out of Hong Kong. Can you believe this being like, okay, if New York City, the US government doesn't want to be part of this crypto revolution, doesn't want to be sort of a nexus for finance in this world, then we will be and I think it's straight embarrassing for the United States. And this is the take that Tom Emmer had, which I share. Is America just going to build its future on debt? Are we actually going to build something again, that's the question. And crypto is like a new generation of the Internet.
00:54:54.006 - 00:55:17.858, Speaker B: It's an invitation to go build things here. And what we're doing with these policies and all of the marvelous clarity Gary Gensler is giving us is driving builders offshore outside of the United States. You are not welcome here at Crypto Entrepreneur, and if we keep doing that, it's not going to be good for the United States. Crypto will be fine. It's just not going to be good for the US. Maybe we'll end it there. What do we got coming up next?
00:55:18.024 - 00:55:34.262, Speaker A: Oh, boy. That was a while, man. Okay, coming up next, two more DKE EVMs land on the Ethereum main net. We got some good news out of Euler. MakerDAO has a new path for Dai. SBF gets in trouble. Amazingly, the guy just can't stop can't stop him.
00:55:34.262 - 00:56:11.742, Speaker A: And then AI training I'm talking about AI now is getting called for a timeout. So all of this and more as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. Uniswap is the largest on chain marketplace for self custody digital assets. Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange, but you know this because you've been listening to Bankless. But did you know that the Uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat onramp? Now, you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in DFI inside of Uniswap. Not only that, but Polygon Arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate. But that's just DFI.
00:56:11.742 - 00:56:50.346, Speaker A: Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, letting you find more listings for the best prices across the NFT world. With Uniswap, you can sweep floors on multiple NFTs, and Uniswap's universal router will optimize your gas fees for you. Uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across Ethereum, and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor. So go to app Uniswap.org today to buy, sell, or swap tokens and NFTs. The phantom wallet is coming to Ethereum. The number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved UX to Ethereum and Polygon.
00:56:50.346 - 00:57:27.542, Speaker A: If you haven't used Phantom before, you've been missing out. Phantom was one of the first wallets to pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for Ethereum and Polygon. But that's just staking. Phantom is also the best home for your NFTs. Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your NFT experience, pin your favorites, hide your Uglies, burn the spam, and also manage your NFT sale listings from inside the wallet. Phantom is, of course, a MultiChain wallet, but it makes chain management easy, displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or phishing websites. Phantom has already saved over 20,000 users from getting scammed or hacked.
00:57:27.542 - 00:57:37.962, Speaker A: So get on the Phantom waitlist and be. One of the first to access the MultiChain beta. There's a link in the show notes, or you can go to Phantom app slash waitlist to get access in late February.
00:57:38.106 - 00:57:47.070, Speaker B: David, this week, the second Zke EVM just launched. So we doubled Zke EVM in two weeks. This is polygon's Zke EVM.
00:57:47.150 - 00:58:16.234, Speaker A: Tell us about polygon Zke EVM? Long awaited, just shipped to Mainnet. Ryan john Adams, my co host here, had a fantastic show with Jordy Belina and Mihalo from Polygon. Jordy, fun fact. Previously, I actually love this story because it was me. This is going to be a deep cut of a story. It was me, Mariano Conti, and Mihalo in ECC 2021. I had just come off out of my scooter accident, if you remember that.
00:58:16.352 - 00:58:17.562, Speaker B: Oh, black eye and everything?
00:58:17.616 - 00:58:22.134, Speaker A: Yeah, no, just a black eye. I didn't lose any. Yeah, no, just a black eye.
00:58:22.182 - 00:58:23.534, Speaker B: Did you chip a tooth or something?
00:58:23.572 - 00:58:29.006, Speaker A: You went to the yeah, I chipped a tiny little tooth and then it came back. Yeah, it grew back. Yeah.
00:58:29.188 - 00:58:29.920, Speaker B: Wow.
00:58:30.930 - 00:59:01.494, Speaker A: Anyways, so fast forward, like, four weeks into ECC. I still had a little, you know, a little bit of puffiness. Anyways, it was me, Mariano Conti, the guy that deployed multilateral Die and Maker in 2019. We were all just getting a beer towards the end of ECC, and Mihalo gets a phone call. He looks at it, steps immediately up and goes and answers it, and me and Mariano just continue having a beer. And then Mihalo comes back with a overjoyed facial expression. And we were like, Dude, what was that? And he was like, Dope.
00:59:01.494 - 00:59:03.178, Speaker A: Good news, man. Good news.
00:59:03.344 - 00:59:06.650, Speaker B: I can't tell you it was this.
00:59:06.720 - 00:59:27.742, Speaker A: It was this. It was the polygon acquisition of ZK Hermes. Of Hermes, which was Jordy Belina's project, which is the man that you see on the screen to the left. And fast forward to where we are today. This is the culmination of that phone call, of that partnership agreement. And now we have the Zke EVM live on Mainnet. And so that was what was launched.
00:59:27.742 - 00:59:30.034, Speaker A: When was that launched? On Tuesday. Tuesday of this week?
00:59:30.072 - 00:59:47.686, Speaker B: Yeah, on Tuesday. ETH as the gas token, matic as the payment to validators. We've got a full interview if you want to check that out. And the cool thing is how fast and furious these ZK EVMs are now coming. I feel like this is Crypto's broadband moment. This is Ethereum's broadband moment. At least.
00:59:47.686 - 00:59:52.394, Speaker B: David we just got our second, but here's Consensus coming out and introducing a third man.
00:59:52.432 - 00:59:53.638, Speaker A: They're multiplying.
00:59:53.814 - 01:00:11.854, Speaker B: Okay, Lena, it's called a developer. Ready ZK roll up. Powered by consensus. I haven't investigated this, but they're just coming out of the woodwork now. We got zke EVM. Suddenly, it's March 2023, and we got block space that you want block space.
01:00:11.892 - 01:00:15.200, Speaker A: We got block block space where Ether is selling block space.
01:00:16.070 - 01:00:38.998, Speaker B: Oh, my gosh. Speaking of block space, layer two beat all right. I love layer two beat. Layer two beat because they provide transparency to all of these roll ups that are coming to the market. And as we multiply our chains, it's hard to know what the decentralization and security guarantees are on each of these chains. Did you see this? They added this little kind of pie chart. What are we looking at here?
01:00:39.084 - 01:00:54.958, Speaker A: Yeah, so this is a five. Think of this like an orange slice for the podcast listener. So an orange slice with five slices, and each of these slices can be various colors. Gray, yellow, red, and I'm assuming green, maybe?
01:00:55.044 - 01:00:58.190, Speaker B: Actually, we don't see any green yet. We don't see any green yet.
01:00:58.260 - 01:01:00.526, Speaker A: Actually don't know if green is possible. Is green possible?
01:01:00.708 - 01:01:03.370, Speaker B: This is an orange slice of what the risk?
01:01:03.450 - 01:01:35.594, Speaker A: Security risk. So there's five different things that all roll ups need to be secure on. Data availability, where is the data stored? And can that data be rugged upgradability, validator failure, sequencer failure, and state validation? All roll ups need to improve on all five of these things. And so this pie chart that you can see, I actually am still confused as to whether or not sorry. There are only three colors. There is gray, yellow, and red. And okay, man, they should really make gray green.
01:01:35.594 - 01:01:43.774, Speaker A: Gray is green. Intuitively. Gray is green. Green doesn't gray is good. Gray is good. Yeah. So there's gray, yellow, and red.
01:01:43.774 - 01:01:52.206, Speaker A: And so you can see the characterization, a snapshot of what the security risks for every single layer two are and what they have to work.
01:01:52.308 - 01:01:55.454, Speaker B: Basically, you want your orange slices. You want the whole thing, the whole.
01:01:55.492 - 01:02:01.060, Speaker A: Circle, to be all gray, gray, gray. Bartech, come on. Can we get this in green?
01:02:01.670 - 01:02:04.354, Speaker B: And the closest is Arbitrum one, which.
01:02:04.392 - 01:02:07.460, Speaker A: Has two orange slices out of five.
01:02:08.330 - 01:02:24.454, Speaker B: Yes. You just said orange slices, but there's no orange color. Okay. David is actually talking about the orange, not yellow. I'm worried that people will see, like, man, color orange. We totally screwed this up, but we are not editing this out. All right? This is raw, unfiltered bankless material.
01:02:24.582 - 01:02:26.650, Speaker A: Two of the orange spices are orange.
01:02:28.670 - 01:02:37.070, Speaker B: All we're trying to say is go to layer twobeat.com if you want to check in on the risk associated with your layer two. That's probably all we needed to freaking say.
01:02:37.140 - 01:02:40.314, Speaker A: Next topic. Let's get it out of here. Euler.
01:02:40.362 - 01:02:49.774, Speaker B: Good news, David. Euler the exploiter returned 51,000 E, 51,000 ETH. 51k ETH.
01:02:49.822 - 01:02:59.214, Speaker A: And actually, even more than that, because there was another transaction that returned another 7000 ether. There was also another transaction that I've returned. Something like 20 million die.
01:02:59.342 - 01:03:01.222, Speaker B: They got 84% of their funds back.
01:03:01.276 - 01:03:12.026, Speaker A: 84% of oiler exploited funds are returned. That is, if you had told me that we were going to get 84% of funds back the day it was exploited, I was like, wow, that is unheard of.
01:03:12.128 - 01:03:29.118, Speaker B: Pretty good. Let me ask you here what are these criminals doing? I wasn't following this story. So you go, you hack something. You hack like, $150,000,000, and then you go and a week later, two weeks later, you return 84% of it. Who does this? What is happening here?
01:03:29.204 - 01:04:01.334, Speaker A: So there's two routes. So understanding that, my first take on the first exploit was like, man, this is totally North Korea, because they immediately went into tornado cash, implying that they had no intent on returning the funds. So follow up on this story, and I'll give my take after. This is in a series of messages written into the data of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The exploiter says, this Jacob here. I don't think what I will say will help me in any way, but I still want to say it. I fucked up.
01:04:01.334 - 01:04:17.562, Speaker A: I didn't want to, but I messed up with others monies, others jobs and others lives. I really fucked up. I'm sorry. I didn't mean all that. I really didn't fucking mean all that. Forgive me. And then in another transaction, he says, jacob, apparently the rest of the money will be returned ASAP.
01:04:17.562 - 01:04:48.822, Speaker A: I only look after my safety, and that is the reason for the delay. I'm sorry for any misunderstanding. Implying if we're taking this, if we're taking Jacob seriously, that we are going to be getting 100% back. Exploited funds, one of two things happened, maybe both. One, law enforcement found him and said, hey, man, you are going to jail if you don't return the funds right now. You are going to go to jail for like a big time. If you return the funds only right now, you will only go to jail for a little bit.
01:04:48.822 - 01:04:50.482, Speaker A: Something like that. Something along the lines.
01:04:50.546 - 01:04:51.174, Speaker B: That's how it works.
01:04:51.212 - 01:05:00.358, Speaker A: Yeah, that's how it works. Directionally correct. The other one is like he actually felt bad about all of the lives that he damaged, and so he returned it out of guilt.
01:05:00.454 - 01:05:03.098, Speaker B: But then he I'm going to go.
01:05:03.104 - 01:05:12.400, Speaker A: With option A, because assuming Jacob's his actual name, he was like, yo, the gig is up. You guys got me. Here's all the money back. And it's also me doing this.
01:05:12.850 - 01:05:27.782, Speaker B: I'm sorry. Here's your money. Worst robbers in history. Imagine going know, stealing something from a bank and then returning a week later and being like, hey, guys, I'm sorry. I was going through a rough patch. Yeah, here's the money.
01:05:27.836 - 01:05:29.330, Speaker A: I didn't think of the consequences.
01:05:29.410 - 01:05:35.426, Speaker B: I really didn't think about it. I'm sorry. So strange. Well, such is crypto.
01:05:35.458 - 01:05:36.342, Speaker A: And the good news.
01:05:36.396 - 01:05:43.258, Speaker B: Negotiations happen on chain maker. What's? A new era has begun. Chapter zero. What are we looking at here?
01:05:43.424 - 01:06:01.950, Speaker A: We are looking at a promotional graphic. If you turn on the sound, it doesn't say anything. It is just music. So I actually was trying to get the details of what this announcement means, and there wasn't too much there. I went into the governance forums. I opened up the links. I looked at what was being proposed.
01:06:01.950 - 01:06:31.366, Speaker A: Man, it's make a really bureaucratic. And so they are tweeting out. Chapter zero. A new era has begun. A governance proposal has passed that ratifies a new constitution which includes Formaker dow to one increasingly decentralized collateral that backs die. I think the big obvious low hanging fruit here is removing dependence on USDC but perhaps also for real world assets. Second, allowing Dai to free float relative to the dollar.
01:06:31.366 - 01:06:55.754, Speaker A: This was an original idea from MakerDAO that has kind of been pushed to the back burner for a very long time now, but now is returning questionable. Also questionable is the timeline on this. I don't know. How is that this year? Or are we just saying that we still want to do this? I don't know. And also improvements to the actual governance process of MakerDAO. And they also said that they are going to limit real world asset collateral. These are the notes that I have from Christy.
01:06:55.754 - 01:07:05.550, Speaker A: Thank you, Christy, who did more research than me. But man is finding out what this actual announcement is actually really confusing. If someone can summarize this for me, that'd be really appreciated.
01:07:05.630 - 01:07:31.578, Speaker B: My high level take on it was they want to go less in the direction of real world assets and more in the direction of crypto native assets because the real world is looking a little anti crypto these days. But probably that's not what they did. Ticketmaster is doing NFT stuff. This is cool. Okay, but I thought Ticketmaster was the villain since they jacked up those concerts and I resent them being associated with crypto. But you're telling me this is a.
01:07:31.584 - 01:08:32.698, Speaker A: Good thing if you accept it at face value, which maybe I'm overly optimistic and bullish on humanity, but I will. Ticketmaster has launched the ability for artists to offer token gated ticket sales, meaning that a sale can only be unlocked or accessed with a specific NFT. They've launched a token gated option for special access to concerts and event tickets for eligible NFT holders. And they also have a suite of artist driven tools offering many unique ticketing services, including Face Value Ticket Exchange, a program that limits transfer and locks in resale prices at face value. I don't know if that is done by a smart contract, but in theory it could verified Fan, a registration system that filters out scalpers and bot users who are looking to acquire tickets for the purpose of reselling. And Ticketmaster Requests, a service that eliminates the traditional on sale rush by allowing artists to sell tickets to high demand shows through a fulfillment and request model. During the purchasing process, Ticketmaster prompts a user to connect a wallet to verify ownership of an NFT.
01:08:32.698 - 01:08:49.910, Speaker A: After that, it's the same buying process. So token gated access to buying some NFTs along with some other equitable tools and services that in theory could all be smart contracts, but it wasn't stated whether they are or not? Is this a reformation of Ticketmaster?
01:08:50.410 - 01:09:14.110, Speaker B: I wouldn't go that far, David. But look, this is a pretty big deal, actually. Ticketmaster is absolutely massive. These tokens are minted on ethereum and accessible via MetaMask and Coinbase. This is onboarding more people to kind of NFTs. I think in any other news cycle or week or in a world where Ticketmaster was less hated at this specific moment of time, we probably would have led the episode with this. Probably.
01:09:14.110 - 01:09:25.022, Speaker B: This is actually huge news in terms of the thing that we care most about, which is, like, onboarding the world to crypto and web3 pretty big.
01:09:25.156 - 01:09:41.510, Speaker A: I think it's fair to be skeptical about Ticketmaster just by nature of what there are and their incentives. And also at the same time, it's also fair to accept that this maybe it's not Ticketmaster, but is coming like verifiable Tickets as tokens on ethereum by someone somewhere.
01:09:42.570 - 01:09:48.594, Speaker B: I bet you Gary thinks these are securities. Oh, do you want to ask him? Yeah, come on. Like a podcast.
01:09:48.642 - 01:09:50.642, Speaker A: Gary, we'll ask you this.
01:09:50.716 - 01:09:59.366, Speaker B: That's the only way we can find out. Come to office hours with David and Ryan. Gary MicroStrategy, they just bought more Bitcoin.
01:09:59.478 - 01:10:18.898, Speaker A: There you go. 6455 new Bitcoins to come to a total amount of Bitcoins of 138,955. They also paid off a loan that was collateralized by Bitcoin. We tried to unpack it, didn't really understand it. Something else happened. But anyways, Microsoft bought more bitcoin. It was a while.
01:10:18.898 - 01:10:20.670, Speaker A: It was a while since they bought another Bitcoin.
01:10:20.750 - 01:10:27.300, Speaker B: David, you didn't want me to include this link, but we had some discussion about it. Do you know how much.
01:10:29.350 - 01:10:32.294, Speaker A: For the record, bankless nailer I told him to not do this.
01:10:32.332 - 01:10:41.034, Speaker B: Let me finish. Let me finish. David. Okay. If MicroStrategy had purchased ETH rather than Bitcoin rather than $4 billion, do you know how much they would have?
01:10:41.072 - 01:10:43.946, Speaker A: David, I'm assuming more money.
01:10:44.128 - 01:10:46.634, Speaker B: $6.5 billion.
01:10:46.752 - 01:10:48.646, Speaker A: Almost double if they had bought.
01:10:48.678 - 01:11:00.106, Speaker B: Ethan said David wanted to strip this because I told Ryan to not and I was like, you know what? I am gassed today. You be breaks. Try to stop YouTube.
01:11:00.138 - 01:11:06.202, Speaker A: Viewers will notice that he typed in the URL instead of pulling it up.
01:11:06.356 - 01:11:22.594, Speaker B: This might get cut by your editors. I don't know if this will make it, but let's talk about this. The Nasdaq is launching Crypto Custody Service in Q two. The Nasdaq? What, are they abandoning stocks, David? Are they looking over their shoulder at the crypto walking and they're just totally.
01:11:22.642 - 01:11:36.826, Speaker A: Abandoning all stocks and equities going crypto only? That's the news. No, I'm kidding. They're first primarily providing custody services for Bitcoin and ethereum. This is the top of the rabbit hole of a long list of potential services that they could do.
01:11:36.848 - 01:11:42.334, Speaker B: It starts with custody. Kind of cool. Avalanche had an outage last week. What happened?
01:11:42.452 - 01:12:02.142, Speaker A: Avalanche, the C chain was out of order for about 50 minutes. Halted the block production, a bug related to blockchain validation. They released an update. This was the second time that this has happened in seven days, which triggered me to make a tweet that caused me to fight with a bunch of solana and avalanche people. And that was more or less my weekend.
01:12:02.286 - 01:12:05.060, Speaker B: And David's sorry about all of that, and he takes it all.
01:12:08.790 - 01:12:20.714, Speaker A: Are some tweets. There are some tweets that I could have phrased better. There are some tweets that I could have been more precise. Everything I said, I completely believe. I've never written a single tweet that I didn't believe in. There are a couple. One or two might be out there.
01:12:20.752 - 01:12:21.706, Speaker B: Except those ones.
01:12:21.808 - 01:12:23.018, Speaker A: Except those ones.
01:12:23.184 - 01:12:50.290, Speaker B: Except the ones that were deleted later. The US. Is charging SBF for bribing China. How much more trouble can this guy get in? Okay. What's happening now with Sam Bankman Freed? That is the SBF Sam Bankman Freed, he is charging with paying $40 million to Chinese officials as a bribe so that they would unfreeze his hedge funds accounts. That sounds like a crime, David.
01:12:50.950 - 01:12:59.240, Speaker A: Yes, well, they're frozen for a reason. But I guess it was China that froze them, and he paid them $40 million to unfreeze them.
01:12:59.850 - 01:13:30.798, Speaker B: All right. Okay. Well, now he's in trouble with two governments, I guess. This is some AI news, which we usually don't cover, but I think this is important. This is an open letter to pause all giant, large scale AI experiments. And I gotta think that this is maybe not inspired by the Bankless podcast with Eliezer, but certainly inspired by Eliezer himself and his caution and concerns about AI safety issues. Bankless listeners might know.
01:13:30.798 - 01:14:12.486, Speaker B: If you didn't listen to this episode early in the year, you catch an archive we had Eliezer Yudkowski on who basically told us we're all going to die because AIS, quite literally, quite literally going to become super intelligent. We're in the process of becoming super intelligent. There was no way to keep them aligned with humanity and our ethics and morality. And so that would result in the inevitable demise of human beings. The AIS would just basically sort our atoms and do something else with them. So it seems like that's not just him that's concerned about this. This is an entire open letter saying to stop, to pause all large scale AI experiments.
01:14:12.486 - 01:14:17.242, Speaker B: Like, stop chat. GPT four is what I'm reading in this article.
01:14:17.306 - 01:14:40.626, Speaker A: Give us no stop all AI innovation more powerful than Chat GBT Four. That's the difference. We're at Chat GBT four. Like armistice. Like, everyone pause. Everyone stop. So this is the Future of Life Institute, which is a nonprofit organization that works to reduce global, catastrophic and existential risk facing humanity, particularly from advanced artificial intelligence.
01:14:40.626 - 01:14:53.546, Speaker A: So this is a petition that you can go sign. It's already signed by Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Gary Marcus, Yosha Bengio, who I don't know, and others, if that is.
01:14:53.568 - 01:14:56.070, Speaker B: Something Yvonne Harari david Andrew Yang.
01:14:56.150 - 01:15:06.062, Speaker A: Oh, wow. Yeah. Wow. That's Max tegmark man. Oh, you need to read some books by Max Tegmark. Our mathematical universe. Have you read that also? Life 3.0.
01:15:06.062 - 01:15:10.190, Speaker A: Oh, great books. Great books, dude. Really like names.
01:15:12.610 - 01:15:15.040, Speaker B: Are you going to sign this, David? What's your take on this?
01:15:19.650 - 01:15:21.506, Speaker A: I don't I need I don't know.
01:15:21.528 - 01:15:22.434, Speaker B: Enough to sign this.
01:15:22.472 - 01:15:25.490, Speaker A: I don't know. I actually really had to consider that for a moment. I don't know.
01:15:25.640 - 01:15:31.826, Speaker B: And I'm worried that signing a letter is not going to do anything to stop it regardless.
01:15:31.858 - 01:15:55.726, Speaker A: Right. Because this is a Molok problem. Right. So, like, say nine people out of ten agree to sign the letter and pause, and one defects and one defects. Well, then that one gets the lead, right? Or one this is a classic moloch problem. Yeah. I will have to say that the Leaser podcast that we did, I've heard from multiple people that it had made waves in the AI community more than it had before.
01:15:55.726 - 01:16:08.098, Speaker A: And I think it was important that Ellie Azer did a non AI podcast for that to reach new audiences and permeate. I think this is not necessarily a coincidence that this letter is happening right now.
01:16:08.184 - 01:16:24.920, Speaker B: Look, we are not done exploring AI the AI safety problem. And I think the next stop for Banglas is to get the kind of the counterpoint to Elise or someone who's a bit more optimistic on AI. So we've got some guests lined up in this is what we do, April, so expect a deep dive there.
01:16:25.610 - 01:16:42.014, Speaker A: This will be a fun piece of trivia. The AI guest that we have recorded, I think we're recording with him next week or maybe the week after. No, couple of weeks. Yeah, week after. Spoke at East Denver 2018. So if you care to find out who that is, there is a little bit of trivia for you.
01:16:42.212 - 01:16:59.442, Speaker B: All right. Someone will find out. Dune integrates chat GPT four wow. Okay. Speaking of, is this the crypto plus AI, of course, conversation. This is Dune Analytics. Fantastic dashboard for coming up, almost viewing everything.
01:16:59.496 - 01:17:17.618, Speaker A: We use it so frequently on the roll up to show data. It's kind of a complicated dashboard to operate. I haven't really dove down how to spin up a board, but Data always uses it. Hildabi uses it. We've used Dune Analytics on the weekly roll up many, many times. It requires kind of a technical brain to operate.
01:17:17.714 - 01:17:50.818, Speaker B: This is what's so fascinating, though, about Chat GPT and why I think it's so hard to stop, because right now it's so damn useful. Could you imagine going to like, you and I don't know, SQL not very good with this. We can't construct our own boards. Wouldn't you love to be able to go to do an analytics and type in, like, give me the number of ETH addresses from date January to March. That staked ETH boom outputs an answer. That's what Chat GBD four can do. And it's going to consume all of this public available blockchain data anyway.
01:17:50.818 - 01:17:55.966, Speaker B: And so that's part of the moloch trap is how do you stop it? It's too useful to try to shut.
01:17:55.998 - 01:18:14.540, Speaker A: Down all the Dune board creators who do, like, selfless work and create boards for us to view, like, again, like people like Hildabi, people like Data. Always. There's a few others. We are now going to be thanking chat GPT Four and their services will no longer be leaded. Sorry, guys.
01:18:15.310 - 01:18:25.502, Speaker B: Well, look, the bullcase is for them is it allows people to operate on a higher order rather than constructing the dashboard. You just have to know what questions to ask, right?
01:18:25.556 - 01:18:27.962, Speaker A: Yeah. I said that facetiously because I thought it was funny.
01:18:28.026 - 01:18:48.146, Speaker B: Sorry, I'm taking things too seriously because it's the AI topic and it scares me. David well, that's cool. By the way, I am an investor in Dune Analytics and I don't think we mentioned this. You and I are both investors in L two beat. Got to mention this. Of course, all of our disclaimers are always@bankless.com disclaimers.
01:18:48.146 - 01:18:56.086, Speaker B: David MetaMask is integrating sign in with Ethereum. Much more natively these days. What's this news? Yeah.
01:18:56.108 - 01:19:18.542, Speaker A: So this is Spruce ID the Twitter account. Spruce is basically the studio behind sign in with Ethereum. So sign in with Ethereum is now being so everyone knows. They're know. Log in with Facebook, log in with Google. MetaMask is now having like a login, a sign in button and it is integrating with the sign in with Ethereum protocol. And so that is what is being announced here today.
01:19:18.542 - 01:19:20.522, Speaker A: Sign in with ethereum integrated with MetaMask.
01:19:20.586 - 01:19:23.642, Speaker B: David, I think we're going to see sign in with Ethereum on more websites.
01:19:23.706 - 01:19:27.182, Speaker A: Including, including our website right here.
01:19:27.316 - 01:19:36.278, Speaker B: Bankless.com has silently added the ability to connect with your ETH address. Look at me doing this. Connect your wallet. The real Bankless way to log in. All right.
01:19:36.364 - 01:19:39.398, Speaker A: MetaMask, our favorite wallet and sponsor ever.
01:19:39.564 - 01:19:43.138, Speaker B: Thank you. Connecting with an address. Boom.
01:19:43.234 - 01:19:48.754, Speaker A: Sadly, we don't see that part on screen. Sign in to verify identity. Let's fucking go. This is dope.
01:19:48.882 - 01:19:49.462, Speaker B: There we go.
01:19:49.516 - 01:19:53.818, Speaker A: We don't see the MetaMask because Zoom doesn't do the screen share for MetaMask. Sorry.
01:19:53.904 - 01:20:04.826, Speaker B: Right? And then I just signed in. So I linked my wallet with my bankless citizenship and now I don't have to log in. In order to access all Bankless citizen content.
01:20:05.008 - 01:20:43.674, Speaker A: You don't have to log in with your email and password. You do get to log in with your Ethereum address. So when we launched the Bankless website, it was unequivocally. One of the most positive responses about the website, like, everybody was positive except for one complaint, which was that they needed to log in with an email and password. Everything was unequivocally positive. And this one person was like, Bankless bad because signing in with an email address and first off, I'll remind you we're a newsletter. We need your email address and fast forward however many weeks ago we launched this website about a month ago.
01:20:43.674 - 01:20:45.094, Speaker A: Now we have signed with Ethereum.
01:20:45.222 - 01:20:47.580, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just actually, it was like two weeks.
01:20:49.470 - 01:20:52.302, Speaker A: Wait, when did we launch the website? Two weeks ago?
01:20:52.436 - 01:20:54.414, Speaker B: Yeah, two weeks, maybe two and a half.
01:20:54.452 - 01:20:56.538, Speaker A: Jesus, time is weird.
01:20:56.634 - 01:21:00.478, Speaker B: Zoom in. By the way, speaking of zoom in fast.
01:21:00.644 - 01:21:01.774, Speaker A: You like that?
01:21:01.972 - 01:21:16.260, Speaker B: Kraken Exchange just announced an official partnership with Williams Racing. What's cool about this is there's some way that Kraken has provided for you to get your NFT potentially on the back of a race car?
01:21:17.750 - 01:21:21.602, Speaker A: This is a partnership with Williams Racing of F One. So this is F One Motorsports.
01:21:21.666 - 01:21:22.690, Speaker B: It's not NASCAR.
01:21:22.770 - 01:21:37.626, Speaker A: Not NASCAR. European. Yes. So new horizons, new frontiers for Kraken, if you will. So they have a Kraken logo on a race car. So Kraken is getting a race car and they have real estate on this race car for your listener. You that's you.
01:21:37.626 - 01:21:43.330, Speaker A: Your NFT could be on the Kraken race car. How do you get your NFT?
01:21:43.510 - 01:21:52.960, Speaker B: Do not freaking put your dick butt on the back. Do not shame the crypto industry. I could don't I could do it. I'm asking you not to, though. Not to try.
01:21:53.330 - 01:21:55.114, Speaker A: How do you feel about an MFer?
01:21:55.242 - 01:21:58.854, Speaker B: He's totally going to try. I feel fine about an MFR.
01:21:58.922 - 01:22:00.414, Speaker A: Okay. But not a dick butt.
01:22:00.462 - 01:22:06.050, Speaker B: Honestly, whatever you want to do, dude. It's permissionless, all right? I can't stop you anyway. I won't even try.
01:22:06.200 - 01:22:20.534, Speaker A: So the details of how to get your NFT on this race car is in this link, in the show notes, you put your NFT. I'm assuming this is how this works. You put your NFT into the Kraken NFT platform and then probably sign up. I bet you that's how that works.
01:22:20.652 - 01:22:21.254, Speaker B: There you go.
01:22:21.292 - 01:22:23.242, Speaker A: Kraken, sponsor of Bankless. Thank you.
01:22:23.376 - 01:22:43.306, Speaker B: Also adding layer two support, which we always we love, that you can now send and receive your stable coins natively to Arbitrum. There you go. David. Some other layer two releases going on. Conduit is a crypto native infrastructure program that allows you to launch a roll up in just a few clicks.
01:22:43.498 - 01:22:48.414, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure we predicted this feature would be coming. Like, you can issue a token or the Op stack.
01:22:48.462 - 01:22:48.914, Speaker B: Yes.
01:22:49.032 - 01:23:09.506, Speaker A: So the whole idea a long, long time ago was that the Op stack is the, ERC, 20 token for roll ups. Here we have a startup that is executing on that idea. So that not only is this a release, it's also a raise announcement. So this is a startup that raised, I think, $7 million from Paradigm and they are one click Op stack deployment. Man, that is really, really cool.
01:23:09.628 - 01:23:10.650, Speaker B: I think it's really cool.
01:23:10.720 - 01:23:11.980, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really cool.
01:23:12.510 - 01:23:42.114, Speaker B: You know how it's very easy now to launch your own token? And that was revolutionary in 2016 with Ethereum. It's basically provided a platform for that. Now it's going to be just as easy to launch your own entire chain. So we're going to have an absolute explosion of chains when it's as easy to spin up a website, launch a Token as it is an entire chain. David we got tokens, we got chains. We also got jobs. David new jobs of the week and got to do a shout out for a very important role Bankless is hiring for.
01:23:42.114 - 01:23:43.058, Speaker B: What do we need here?
01:23:43.144 - 01:24:23.838, Speaker A: What we need is someone to edit this podcast that you are listening to right now. We are looking for a podcast, video editor, media operation. So if you are familiar with audio and video editing software, if you've ever edited a podcast before, if you've ever edited a video before, we are interested in talking to you, especially if you live in Est or European time zones, because a Bankless nation never stops producing content. So we quite literally need podcast editors across the globe because Ryan and I produce way too much content at all hours of the day. So that is the job. If you want to work directly with Me and Ryan to edit and produce podcasts, please click click in the show notes and apply.
01:24:24.004 - 01:24:46.514, Speaker B: We got 30, maybe 40 million downloads. I think on the podcast. We're trying to get to 100 million and then a billion. That could be a metric you help us reach here. Got some other jobs going on too. Rise is hiring a marketing manager, a sales development representative. Uniswap needs a senior product designer, an application security engineer, and a senior mobile engineer who's a React native.
01:24:46.514 - 01:24:53.530, Speaker B: You can find all of that and more at the Bankless job site, bankless palette.com slash Jobs. David what do we have coming up next?
01:24:53.600 - 01:25:18.706, Speaker A: Coming up next, we got the questions from the nation. We're going to talk about whether or not Ryan changed anything about our portfolio as bology scared us out of our pants. We'll talk about that as well as who was the first Zke EVM on Mainnet. And then we got some takes of the week and we got what we're bullish on. And then we got some Memes of the week. There's more than one meme this week, so stay tuned because both of them are very, very good. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible.
01:25:18.706 - 01:25:56.330, Speaker A: Learning about crypto is hard until now. Introducing MetaMask Learn, an open educational platform about crypto, Web Three, self custody, wallet management, and all the other topics needed to onboard people into this crazy world of crypto. MetaMask Learn is an interactive platform with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand, giving you actual practical experience for navigating Web three. The purpose of MetaMask Learn is to teach people the basics of self custody and wallet security in a safe environment. And while MetaMask Learn always takes the time to define Web Three specific vocabulary, it is still a jargon free. Experience for the crypto. Curious, user friendly, not scary.
01:25:56.330 - 01:26:53.118, Speaker A: MetaMask Learn is available in ten languages with more to be added soon, and it's meant to cater to a global Web Three audience. So are you tired of having to explain crypto concepts to your friends? Go to learn MetaMask IO and add MetaMask Learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of Web Three. Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web Three landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems, with a recent addition of Arbitrum nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling arbitram home. Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees. With arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro, it's also now ten times faster than before.
01:26:53.118 - 01:27:06.370, Speaker A: Visit Arbitrum IO where you can join the community, dive into the developer Docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum experience web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap and friction free.
01:27:06.440 - 01:27:25.334, Speaker B: We got the questions of the week this is a question from Big Wiggle 501 from the bankless Citizen Discord. After your chat with bology, does your portfolio remain the same or have you made any changes? I think this is a question to you and I. Did you make any changes after the 90 day bitcoin bet and our conversation.
01:27:25.382 - 01:27:30.880, Speaker A: With Balogy, I want Brian you to guess whether I changed anything.
01:27:31.730 - 01:27:41.182, Speaker B: No, David, you did not change a thing. Unless there is the slight probability that you just purchased some more ETH is my guess.
01:27:41.316 - 01:27:43.950, Speaker A: I would consider that not changing my strategy.
01:27:45.810 - 01:27:47.566, Speaker B: So you did, is that correct?
01:27:47.668 - 01:27:57.166, Speaker A: Yes. I will say, like, during the biology week, the bitcoin, the bit signal week, I was like, okay, maybe I should perhaps reconsider my position. Reconsider?
01:27:57.278 - 01:27:59.346, Speaker B: You don't have any bitcoin or you have a little bit of bitcoin.
01:27:59.378 - 01:28:06.342, Speaker A: What's your well, no, technically I'm short bitcoin because I have sold bitcoin for Ether to do my Ether long bet.
01:28:06.396 - 01:28:08.546, Speaker B: I think that's short bitcoin relative to ETH.
01:28:08.578 - 01:28:10.422, Speaker A: It's not relative to Ether, not to the dollar.
01:28:10.486 - 01:28:12.326, Speaker B: I don't think you would be short bitcoin.
01:28:12.438 - 01:28:17.690, Speaker A: I would never, ever be short any crypto asset, ever. God, are you insane?
01:28:18.350 - 01:28:20.090, Speaker B: Why would you I'm offended.
01:28:20.510 - 01:28:49.926, Speaker A: Remember the person that got liquidated shorting luna while it was crashing? Like, no way. No way. Anyways, so, no, I did not change anything. While I did need to take a moment and reflected and reconsidered, like, okay, biology is saying this. Arthur Hayes also saying this. Perhaps this is not the time to have a net short position against Ether versus bitcoin. I waited until next week to sleep on it and then reassess and I have decided that I will not do anything.
01:28:50.108 - 01:28:58.262, Speaker B: So you're still bullish on ETH relative to bitcoin. So you're still making a bet on the ratio then, too correct? Even doing more correct?
01:28:58.316 - 01:29:03.658, Speaker A: Well, like I said, that is an 18 plus month long position and I.
01:29:03.664 - 01:29:09.900, Speaker B: Don'T think anything's changed. My position has not changed either. I've been long bitcoin for a long time.
01:29:10.270 - 01:29:11.722, Speaker A: Brian actually does own bitcoin.
01:29:11.786 - 01:29:58.954, Speaker B: I do. I have not purchased bitcoin also in a long time and I will continue purchasing ETH. I think that everything that bology and Arthur say, I don't do this in my mind, but you can kind of substitute ether as an asset. I don't think that bology or Arthur fully understand or believe in the monetary premium virtues of ethereum in a high conviction way that you or I do. I think anything basically that benefits the monetary premium story of bitcoin actually doubly benefits. Maybe I shouldn't maybe claim kind of any sort of ratio, but even more so benefits the ethereum narrative over the long run.
01:29:58.992 - 01:30:22.674, Speaker A: So I haven't changed over the long run. Big emphasis on over the long run, because I actually will take Bology's side, and I do take Bology's side that the banking crisis puts the wind in the sails of the bitcoin narrative and also the long term ethereum fundamentals. But emphasis on long term, like, that doesn't hit until later. But Ryan, that is the long term perspective that you have that you take.
01:30:22.712 - 01:30:57.342, Speaker B: Yeah, it was more confirmation. Okay, well, this is what crypto people have been saying for a while, and it looks like this is happening, so I haven't changed a thing. But what also was really already way overweight crypto, so there's not much I could change. I can't get any more bullish. All right, this is a related question, though. If you're going to have an IRA for a 70 year old crypto friend 70, not seven year old, how would you diversify into ETH bitcoin? So someone was on the older side in that generation. What would you advise them of? 100%.
01:30:57.342 - 01:31:07.694, Speaker B: So there they have their pool of other assets and now they want to know, I've got some pool for crypto. What should I buy? Not financial advice, but your hypothetical.
01:31:07.742 - 01:31:12.722, Speaker A: If I was a financial advisor who would, in theory, therefore give financial advice.
01:31:12.856 - 01:31:15.250, Speaker B: Which I'm not, for entertainment only, then.
01:31:15.320 - 01:31:16.450, Speaker A: This wasn't for entertainment only.
01:31:16.520 - 01:31:16.706, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:31:16.728 - 01:31:34.474, Speaker A: So the 70 year old is an interesting detail because that implies end of life phase. And so the question is, how healthy is this 70 year old? Are they living like, five more years, 20 more years? Right. Well, I mean, at that point, you have to start to consider these things.
01:31:34.512 - 01:31:34.666, Speaker B: Right?
01:31:34.688 - 01:32:07.986, Speaker A: And so if we're thinking a five to ten year long time horizon, the shorter the time horizon, the more weight I would go to bitcoin. And if we are thinking that this is a 70 year old yoga person who still goes on runs, then I would start to shift more towards ether. So if we're thinking short term, I would go 50 50 bitcoin ether, because that is my bias towards ether. And then as soon as we start to hit like ten to 15 to 20 year long time horizons, I would start to go maybe if we're doing a 20 year long time horizon, I would go 80% ether, 20% bitcoin.
01:32:08.098 - 01:32:15.560, Speaker B: Yeah, that's similar to what I would say. And it's interesting you're not saying any other tokens. So it'd just be ETH and bitcoin, right?
01:32:17.690 - 01:32:19.746, Speaker A: If they want to hear my shitcoin.
01:32:19.778 - 01:32:23.234, Speaker B: Portfolio, I'm happy to my base happy.
01:32:23.292 - 01:32:25.994, Speaker A: To talk about that, actually.
01:32:26.032 - 01:32:59.046, Speaker B: I would do either 70 or 80% ETH and either 20 or 30% bitcoin. And I would do that ETH a portion of that nice staked ETH. I mean, if you are in your 70s, how nice is it to have some sort of fixed income asset as well? So you have the option to kind of sell it as it comes in or keep it. And that is something that ETH staking provides and is pretty unique. So I definitely overweight on ETH either 70% to 80%. But I would have some bitcoin. It wouldn't be 0% for a 70 year old.
01:32:59.228 - 01:32:59.926, Speaker A: I think that's right.
01:32:59.948 - 01:33:01.382, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay.
01:33:01.516 - 01:33:07.870, Speaker A: By the way, I say the term shitcoins like endearingly. I love my shitcoins. I don't think they're shitty.
01:33:07.890 - 01:33:09.110, Speaker B: I love term of endearment.
01:33:09.190 - 01:33:09.578, Speaker A: Yes.
01:33:09.664 - 01:33:17.062, Speaker B: This is a Rocket pollster question. Who really was the first ZK EVM to Mainnet. Who won? David?
01:33:17.206 - 01:33:43.534, Speaker A: Yeah, so I'll put a metaphor. You know, when I did this to my sibling, when a sibling licks something to claim something, that's kind of what happened with the Zke EVMs one. Just like stuck technicality. Yeah, exactly. ZK Sync was technically first beat Polygon by a few days. I will have to say ZK Sync has been around for since 2017. 2018.
01:33:43.534 - 01:34:02.778, Speaker A: We were processing Gitcoin transactions with ZK Sync. The first ZK Sync roll up, which was a ZK roll up, not a Zke EVM, but it was been around for a while. The fact that Polygon is anywhere close to that is like a huge tip of the hat to the Polygon engineering team for catching up to Zksync. But Zksync was technically first.
01:34:02.944 - 01:34:21.854, Speaker B: There you go. ZK Sync was first. My answer would be and does it matter? I mean, they were three or four days apart. We're getting zke EVMs every week now. I think we're know that probably won't matter in the grand scheme of things. David, let's do some takes of the week. You ready? We'll start with man.
01:34:21.892 - 01:34:35.426, Speaker A: This is okay. This is a take that triggered a bunch of fighting out. Well, actually it was this one and another one. Sometimes this is my take. Sometimes I feel bankless us. That's us. Right? Should victory lap more often.
01:34:35.426 - 01:35:08.394, Speaker A: We ignored Salana, Avalanche and Terra during the bull market in which we got our not friendly label as Blind ETH Maxis. The thing that happened next was Salana went down 80% versus ether. Avalanche went down 70% versus ether. Luna is basically at zero, more or less, for all the same reasons that they would be that this is unsustainable. This is just like the in what's in vogue at the moment. And we chose to not cave to external pressure and not cover something that we didn't really understand or believe in. And then meanwhile, we focus on layer twos.
01:35:08.394 - 01:35:52.638, Speaker A: And so our listeners disproportionately got the Op and Arbitrum airdrops compared to other media organizations because that's what we chose to focus on. And we also pounded the table about cross layer one bridge risk. So I can't take credit for, of course, all of this stuff, but I'm saying that our listeners leaned in towards layer two s more than alt layer ones and also leaned shied away from cross layer one bridge risk. And so we got a lot of shit in the second half of 2021 because that was not invoked. Layer two s were not cool during that time. You know what was cool? Alt layer ones. And you and I had conversations many times like, dude, are we out of touch with what's going on? And perhaps in that moment, maybe we were.
01:35:52.638 - 01:36:23.574, Speaker A: But this is when we decided that Bankless is making content for things that you and I believe in, not what other people want us to believe. And so that choice, I think, has been to the great benefit of our listeners so far. And all the choices that we've made about Bankless and the things we choose to talk about and how we talk about them, I would make again immediately. Bankless is not perfect, but neither is this industry. And I think if you can scroll down because I don't have my own Tweet menu, I only hope that we can continue this track record. And that was my take of the week.
01:36:23.692 - 01:37:04.578, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with that. And I got to play the role of making sure that we inject some humility into this too. 100% definitely doesn't mean that we're perfect. And maybe it's the Canadian in me, David, but I have a hard time tweeting a victory lap type tweet. So I'm glad you do that on behalf of Bankless, because if we don't do it, who else is going to? But I will say we're definitely not perfect. But I hope the listeners know that what you hear on Bankless is authentically, what we actually believe, and we try to stay as curious and open minded as possible. We're also not perfect at that.
01:37:04.578 - 01:37:43.278, Speaker B: We also have our biases. But I'm actually not against I think you want somebody in crypto to have biases, right? They just have to be biased towards the right things. Like, whenever possible, we try to be biased towards Bankless technologies and towards decentralization and towards things. And products we think are making the world better and are in it for the long term game. So I appreciate bias as long as it's not like it's long term oriented bias. And we do try to maintain that here. So we appreciate everyone kind of holding us accountable for these values.
01:37:43.278 - 01:38:16.886, Speaker B: I do think at times we've been maligned a little harshly, but yeah, we're going to keep bringing this platform to you guys. And you'll always know that when you come to bankless. This is what David and I authentically think, whether it's right or wrong. And maybe we'll be a little stubborn on some of our convictions. I think that's reinforced that a little in us finding the balance of conviction and yet being open minded is probably the sweet spot for all investors. Last thing I'll say on this is do not expect bankless to be journalists. Don't use the we are not journalists.
01:38:16.918 - 01:38:17.754, Speaker A: We don't like the J word.
01:38:17.792 - 01:38:32.974, Speaker B: We don't like we talk about news, but we are and always have been crypto investors that are on the journey going bankless and we're just sharing what we're learning here. So yeah, maybe turn that into what bankless is kind of take and message.
01:38:33.092 - 01:39:05.706, Speaker A: And we also attempt to wear our biases on our sleeves. It's not like we're hiding them and shoving them in the closet. I think we're pretty open and transparent about how we're biased. And then I also followed up this tweet with one small another follow on tweet saying, I'll be much happier to talk about Solana and avalanche ripluna next bull market after they've completed a full stress test cycle. Meanwhile, gearing up for another round of shit thrown at us during next year's next cycle's crop of new layer ones with a community of brand new people, new to the space.
01:39:05.888 - 01:39:20.080, Speaker B: It does happen every cycle, doesn't it, David? This is a David Friedberg Tweet. Cash is now a risk asset is a pretty big paradigm shift. Cash being a risk asset is a big paradigm shift. What's he saying here?
01:39:20.450 - 01:39:41.862, Speaker A: Basically this is talking about the bank insolvencies, right? So if you hold your money in a bank and that bank is at risk of going insolvent, your cash is now at risk. The other thing you could do is hold United States treasuries, but that's also at risk. And so nowhere is safe in your dollars. David Friedberg is a co host of the all in Podcast. For those that did not know Right, right.
01:39:41.916 - 01:39:42.278, Speaker B: Okay.
01:39:42.364 - 01:39:45.334, Speaker A: He's the sultan of science if you listen to it.
01:39:45.532 - 01:40:29.858, Speaker B: I also had a take on risk. I was thinking about risk this week and because there's something, you know, confused with when they teach you sort of portfolio theory and you go to kind of finance classes in your undergraduate or in business school, they always talk about this term called volatility. And the finance textbooks seem to equate volatility with risk like they're one and the same. If an asset or portfolio is volatile, that also means it's risky. I got to say, David, I as just an investor, practically have found that that is not true at all. And I think particularly when you look at crypto, this is an asset that is very volatile but surprisingly low risk. And I don't mean all crypto, by the way, because there are some very risky crypto assets.
01:40:29.858 - 01:40:56.922, Speaker B: But in particular I'm talking about something like bitcoin or ether. And so I tweeted this. I consider ETH a volatile asset. I do not consider it particularly risky. People often mistake volatility and risk. Another way to say that maybe is Ethan bitcoin feel more risky than they actually are for me because they can go down 80% big way, like 85% relative to the dollar. That means they're volatile.
01:40:56.922 - 01:41:08.286, Speaker B: But if you held, did you actually lose anything? And so going back to this tweet from David Friedberg, cash is now a risk asset, right? For me, treasuries are much more risky.
01:41:08.318 - 01:41:12.926, Speaker A: Than risk in the real way of it being risk, not volatility.
01:41:13.038 - 01:41:49.546, Speaker B: Yes, this is Fiscantes who tweeted and I think clarified the point that I'm making. Volatility becomes risk when, one, you used leverage, that's how volatility can increase risk. Or two, your time horizon is short or unpredictable. That's totally how volatility becomes risk. But volatility and risk are not the same thing. And people, I think, look at crypto as an asset class and confuse those two. The other thing is, number three is what I would add to Fiscanti's Tweet here is if you cannot stomach volatility, that also increases your risk.
01:41:49.546 - 01:42:29.994, Speaker B: If you have like a visceral emotional reaction to seeing your crypto portfolio appreciate five X and then go down 85%, or if you don't have convictions, another way to say this, you definitely increase the risk that you are going to hit the sell button. It becomes a much more risky asset. So I don't know if that makes sense to you, but this is, by the way, what they teach you in business school. They teach you that volatility and risk are one and the same thing. And in order to decrease risk, you want to decrease volatility. But it does nothing to reduce tail risk. And that paradigm on the world has not helped me become a better investor in the crypto asset space.
01:42:30.192 - 01:43:00.898, Speaker A: I think understanding that paradigm early on when I was getting into crypto and everyone was like, crypto could go to zero. It's super risky. But then you understand the fundamentals of crypto and it's like it actually cannot go to zero. A buyer steps in somewhere, right, it kind of can't. And all of a sudden you start to understand and unpack this difference. There's one thing about Fiscanti's tweet I want to change actually a little bit. Number one, if you use leverage, I want to change that to your measure of exposure.
01:43:00.898 - 01:43:36.698, Speaker A: So like say I have $100 if I have $1 of bitcoin and $99 that volatility of bitcoin is not a risk. If I have $100 of bitcoin in $0 and also I need to pay rent and put food on the table, then that volatility does become risk. And then you can also get into leverage, and you can leverage $100 into $150, and then that volatility becomes super risky. So it actually isn't a binary about whether you are or are not on leverage. It's a function of your exposure to the asset and your short term needs.
01:43:36.804 - 01:43:48.462, Speaker B: I think that's a great point and it's totally true. And I would also say that might come packaged in with the term leverage because in a way, what you're sort of doing is you're leveraging your future ability to pay rent.
01:43:48.526 - 01:43:48.946, Speaker A: Sure.
01:43:49.048 - 01:43:58.402, Speaker B: When you risk too much in crypto, right? I guess it's a form of leverage. But yeah, point is completely valid. All right, got to ask you the question. What are you bullish on this week? David?
01:43:58.546 - 01:44:28.462, Speaker A: Okay, so this is a different one this week. This is the Permissionless 2023 Twitter account, which its job is to promote the Permissionless 2023 conference, which I'm a huge fan of. I love promoting it. It is also Ryan, the best meme account in crypto Twitter that I have been able to find. It is extremely obvious that a zoomer runs this account, and they are making some memes that I have never seen before, and they are hilarious.
01:44:28.526 - 01:44:30.610, Speaker B: New territory, new friends, new territory.
01:44:32.470 - 01:45:09.230, Speaker A: And so it's super zoomer, and I chuckle at every single one. Also, there's a healthy amount of SpongeBob memes, which I'm a big fan of, but this is awesome, dude. Even the least funny memes here are better than most people's memes. And so what I'm bullish on is like, I'm just bullish on the memes and jokes that are coming out of this account. I will say I haven't seen this Twitter account do much else other than, one, promote permissionless and two, make memes about permissionless, why it exists. And I'm sorry, this is just product market fit. I just love it.
01:45:09.230 - 01:45:10.970, Speaker A: I just think it's so funny.
01:45:11.130 - 01:45:31.826, Speaker B: Well, David's so excited about the memes, which I also am. The conference is coming up and we're going to be there. I hope the bankless nation is going to be there. That's september 11 through 13th in Austin. Thousands of crypto folks there. It's talking about DFI, talking about NFTs, talking about crypto, regulatory, institutional, everything. It's a fantastic conference.
01:45:31.826 - 01:45:37.142, Speaker B: And by the way, if you are a bankless citizen, you get a discount, right? David? What is that?
01:45:37.196 - 01:45:58.960, Speaker A: 30%, which pays for a year's worth of your bankless membership. Also, ticket prices go up every two weeks. I think they're something in the $400. They go up by a percentage, by the way, which means it's exponential. So if you are now interested in getting permissionless ticket, you would behoove you to go get a ticket earlier and also pay the subscription while you're at it.
01:45:59.570 - 01:46:00.560, Speaker B: There you go.
01:46:01.090 - 01:46:02.670, Speaker A: Ryan, what are you bullish?
01:46:03.010 - 01:47:09.030, Speaker B: Look, I really enjoyed the Jim Bianco episode. It was my favorite episode that we put out this week, I think. And one thing that he said sort of stuck out to me, which we're beginning to see the beginning of crypto decorrelate become uncorrelated with the stock market, right? We have promised the world an alternative financial system, an alternative banking system. And if we are just acting like a risk on asset that is completely correlated with the stock market and it's just a magnified version of holding S and P 500, that's not the ticket. That is not an alternative banking system. And so what we're seeing is bank stocks down, crypto up. That is a good indicator that we are starting to build on this harder path, which is an alternative money system, an alternative financial system that's there for you when the central banks and the banking system fail.
01:47:09.030 - 01:47:22.186, Speaker B: And that's really as the existing system, as fault lines show more and more as that narrative propagates, as that truth propagates, crypto should be going up.
01:47:22.288 - 01:47:22.554, Speaker A: Right.
01:47:22.592 - 01:47:50.814, Speaker B: And it's too early to call it, but it's showing early signs of actually doing that. And that makes me bullish because that means maybe the market is a little bit smarter and that we're not just like a meme funded meme stock kind of market as that's the way it was acting in the end of 2021 and 2022. It feels much more real and substantive than ever before. So that's what's making me bullish.
01:47:50.942 - 01:48:24.702, Speaker A: Yeah, I think not only that, as in like, crypto now can express itself independently from the stock market. But the other big takeaway I had with Jim Bianco was that the economy, the health of the economy is now being expressed in the stock market, which also has not been true for a very long time. And so the fact that those were divergent is not a sign of health. And the fact that economic strength is now a requirement for the stock market to go up just makes me feel good because that means Main Street and Wall Street are being connected again. So another reason to be bullish about the trad world.
01:48:24.836 - 01:48:31.534, Speaker B: Yeah, there you go. Speaking of Jim Bianco too, he puts out some dank memes himself, the Bianca research.
01:48:31.652 - 01:48:33.902, Speaker A: He's giving the permissionless account to run for their money.
01:48:33.956 - 01:48:36.322, Speaker B: This is Janet Yellen. What are we looking at here?
01:48:36.456 - 01:48:51.858, Speaker A: So Jim bianco tweets out yellen. The banking system is sound and resilient. And this is a photoshop picture of Yellen, who's playing the slots at a casino. And let me tell you, it does not look Photoshopped. She looks like a lady who could be at the slot machines.
01:48:51.954 - 01:48:54.120, Speaker B: She looks like she's having a great time. I don't.
01:48:56.890 - 01:48:57.158, Speaker A: Know.
01:48:57.164 - 01:49:01.530, Speaker B: We also got another meme, second meme of the week from Fiscantes.
01:49:01.870 - 01:49:18.474, Speaker A: And this is a SpongeBob meme. So, you know, David included it. US. Government says, let's kill crypto by any means necessary, apart from total banning. Call it Operation Choke Point. And then crypto. And this is a picture of SpongeBob with, like, these pincer things that are squeezing SpongeBob made of a sponge around the neck.
01:49:18.474 - 01:49:32.046, Speaker A: And you can just see SpongeBob is just like, just chilling. He's loving it. He's just like yeah, he's slightly giggling because he's a like crypto is like a river. It just routes around. It's the biggest obstacle and continues.
01:49:32.158 - 01:49:50.326, Speaker B: I mean, the tighter they squeeze, though, the bigger crypto gets. This is the problem that centralized institutions are going to have with crypto, is like, squeeze me. You're proving our point. If you squeeze us, risk and disclaimers got to end with this. Of course crypto is risky. You know it is. You could lose what you put in.
01:49:50.326 - 01:50:18.010, Speaker B: But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot. None of this has been financial advice. Sam.
