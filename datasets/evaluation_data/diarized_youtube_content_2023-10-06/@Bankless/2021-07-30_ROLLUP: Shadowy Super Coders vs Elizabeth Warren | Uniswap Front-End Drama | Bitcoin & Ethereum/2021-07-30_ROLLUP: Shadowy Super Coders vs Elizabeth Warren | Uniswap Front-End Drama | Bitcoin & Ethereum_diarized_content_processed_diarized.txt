00:00:07.610 - 00:00:18.366, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation. This is the fourth week of July, and it is time Friday morning for your weekly roll up. David, I am super excited about this weekly roll up. We've got so much to unpack here.
00:00:18.548 - 00:00:46.780, Speaker B: We always do. And this is always, like I say, my favorite piece of crypto content to produce in this weekly roll up. Just like every other weekly roll up, we go through the markets. What is the market saying? Then we go through the releases, what got released in the last week of crypto. Then we go through the news cycle events, and then we go into some ecosystem takes who had some interesting opinions in the week of crypto. Then we go to what David and Ryan are excited about, and we finish things off with the meme of the week.
00:00:47.150 - 00:00:59.274, Speaker A: The meme of the week. Can't wait, man. This is going to be a great episode. David, before we get in, we've got some psas, man. Let's talk about the first public service announcement. You have Covid. Dude, I'm looking at your background.
00:00:59.274 - 00:01:01.454, Speaker A: It's looking like you have Covid right now.
00:01:01.572 - 00:01:40.150, Speaker B: I have the COVID Yeah, I got it at ECC in Paris. Took a negative test, which allowed me to get out of the country because you have to take a negative test. And so I got my negative result back. I'm like, oh, great. I made it through ECC without Covid, came back home, and then started having allergy symptoms, which were very normal for me in Seattle, so didn't really think anything of it. But then on Tuesday, I got really achy, so went and got a test, came back positive. Did my responsible thing of tweeting that out to make sure everyone knew that if they got in contact with me in ECC that I had Covid.
00:01:40.150 - 00:02:02.690, Speaker B: I don't know where I got it from. Obviously, there's a bunch of people around ECC who also got Covid, so I'm not the only one. But there's a very interesting theme of a bunch of people who all got vaccinated. I'm vaccinated. A bunch of people who got Covid were all vaccinated. And so we all have relatively mild symptoms. I'm not, like, dead or anything.
00:02:02.690 - 00:02:18.310, Speaker B: I'm still doing the weekly roll up as normal. I feel pretty achy, but it's just like a relatively normal cold. Then there's a bunch of people who also have all of these same symptoms, but when they got their negative, they got a test and it came back negative. So that's kind of weird.
00:02:18.970 - 00:02:20.414, Speaker A: That is super weird.
00:02:20.482 - 00:02:20.714, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:20.752 - 00:02:41.086, Speaker A: And I can attest to that, David, because we recorded podcasts the last two days. Well, you've also had Covid, and you've seemed like you're not feeling great, but still okay enough to do podcasting, still okay enough to do some work, that kind of thing. So it's not been as bad as some other cases. And you think that's because likely, your.
00:02:41.108 - 00:03:19.206, Speaker B: Vaccine mitigated that 100%. And one of the reasons why I wanted to put this PSA in there is because, well, now that I have my first hand experience with COVID and also having a vaccine and then also tweeting about it as, like, a public figure in the space, you actually realize how many people are out there who are like the never Vaxxer antivaxxer camp. And it is kind of sobering and frustrating. And so I cannot imagine what this would feel like without a vaccine. I'm generally really achy. Like, sitting in this chair is not even, like, a comfortable thing, and that's with the vaccine. I cannot imagine what it would be like without a vaccine.
00:03:19.206 - 00:04:01.820, Speaker B: And I want to go to all the. One of the ironic things about my market Monday, this post this week in bankless, was talking about the importance of being in person and how much I value being in person at these events. And then I come back with COVID But I totally intend on going to all the other in real life crypto events. And one of the reasons why we haven't been able to return to normal in society is because people are refusing to take the vaccine and or wear a mask when they should. And so in my mind, those people are getting in the way of having all these beautiful, awesome crypto ethereum events that I want to have. And so if you want to go to those events, you got to get a vaccine because you're making it bad for the rest of us.
00:04:02.350 - 00:04:18.942, Speaker A: There's your PSA, guys. All right, let's talk about another PSA. This is another conference that's coming up. You actually don't have to attend in person. Would be great if we had more conferences in person, but not all of those are practical. But this is called smartcon. We've been talking about it the last couple of weeks on the roll up.
00:04:18.942 - 00:04:46.582, Speaker A: This is sort of your last chance to sign up, guys. So if you're listening to this on Friday, go click the link in the show notes. The Smartcontractsummit IO. This is a free conference put on by the chain link, folks. Tons of DFI researchers, tons of DFI developers, tons of people with projects. David, you and I will be there with a panel on EIP 15 five nine, actually, and we just secured guests for that panel. Who's going to be on that panel with us?
00:04:46.636 - 00:05:10.746, Speaker B: Yeah, we got some guests that have not been on the bankless program yet. And then one who has, we have James Wang, who recently put out a report on Ethereum, talking about the combination of EIP one five nine and proof of stake. We brought on squish chaos, who coined the term the triple halving, and also to how Ethereum people should dream bigger dreams about what could be with regards to the value of ether under the ultrasound money paradigm.
00:05:10.778 - 00:05:11.838, Speaker A: More bullish than us.
00:05:11.924 - 00:05:27.090, Speaker B: More bullish than us. Wow, that's hard. And then familiar territory. DC investor coming in to fill up the panel. And so we got those three absolute rock stars joining us on an EIP 1559 and overall bullish ether panel.
00:05:27.510 - 00:05:39.066, Speaker A: So check that out, guys. Get some tickets. Come check out that panel. All of the other educational events. It's like a two to three day conference. And make sure you're there. David, PSA number three.
00:05:39.066 - 00:06:15.598, Speaker A: Next week is actually EIP 15 five nine week. This is the week EIP 15 five nine is scheduled to launch. It looks like we're all on track to launch. That could happen as early as August 4, but it might bleed into August 5. And that seems a bit more likely because it's based on an actual block block time, not a period of time. And there's something called the ice age, which is slowing down block time here lately. So it's difficult to pinpoint exactly when that will launch, but it's probably going to be between the fourth or the 5 August.
00:06:15.598 - 00:06:21.842, Speaker A: And what are we doing next week to celebrate EIP 15 five nine week? I know we have a ton of events scheduled.
00:06:21.906 - 00:06:49.066, Speaker B: Yeah, we have three different things that we are doing on Tuesday. We are doing our regular state of the nation, but it's also not a regular state of the nation. We are bringing on Tim Baco to help us moderate a EIP 1559. How would you call this? Like the most forefront expert panel? All star panel. Right. So we did our EIP 1559 episode with Hazu, which was absolutely great. And again, if you need to get up to speed with EIP 1559, go listen to that podcast episode.
00:06:49.066 - 00:07:41.434, Speaker B: It's titled EIP 1559 because it is the full entire subject matter of what EIP 1559 is, from zero to 100. Really great episode. Hazu is going to be there on that panel, but in joining him, there's also going to be Barnaby from the Ethereum Foundation, Matt Garnett from consensus mesh, and then Mika Zoltu, who's just a major EIP 1559 contributor. These are not your 101 201 level EIP 1559 people. This is the leading forefront experts as to what EIP 1559 is, along with Tim Baco, who's going to help us moderate to ask us some of the questions that Ryan and I aren't even smart enough to ask. And so this is going to be if you are trying to become God status in terms of EIp one five nine knowledge you got, who doesn't want that? Who doesn't want that God status? EIP 1559 panel. Hopefully I'm hyping it up appropriately.
00:07:41.434 - 00:08:18.054, Speaker B: And that is just one event. That's just the first event. That's on Tuesday, on Wednesday, which is, in theory maybe when EIP 1559 goes live, we are going to be teaming up with the boys over at Eth Hub, Eric Connor, Anthony Sazano for our livestream. Many of you have joined us for the proof of stake beacon chain kickoff livestream, which we did at I think like four in the morning. My roommate got very mad at me that day for having that live stream go and I woke him up. But we're doing it again for EIP 1559 as we get closer and closer. We will be live streaming that with the guys from Eth hub.
00:08:18.054 - 00:08:41.010, Speaker B: So join us for that. That'll be on the YouTube. And then, as we just discussed, Thursday the fifth is the smartcon panel with James Wang, Squish chaos and DC investor, all about Ethereum in a post EIP 1559 world. And overall, what's next for the role of ether as it relates to EIP 1559. So get stoked for EIP 1559 week. That is next week.
00:08:41.160 - 00:08:51.150, Speaker A: And a good way not to miss all of that, of course, is if you are watching this on YouTube, subscribe to this YouTube channel. All of this will be published there. So you could check that out. David, another PSA.
00:08:51.230 - 00:08:51.678, Speaker B: Another PSA.
00:08:51.694 - 00:09:10.534, Speaker A: We got a live stream that is happening tonight. So this is Friday when folks are watching that. That is a daily guay livestream. I don't know if you guys are celebrating the next PSA, which is, it's Ethereum's 6th birthday, as you guys are listening to this, as you guys are watching it or what, but tell us about that live stream tonight.
00:09:10.662 - 00:09:53.702, Speaker B: Yeah, Anthony and I, we try and do these every now and then, but it's been getting harder and harder and harder as Covid has gone further and further into know, people are going back and doing their daily lives. And so the Friday evening time has been harder to get a live stream scheduled. But since I'm in quarantine mode, Anthony, and so Anthony is in lockdown mode because Australia is like super duper locked down. We will be doing the bankless daily great stream tomorrow evening. Excuse me, Friday evening tonight for the listener. So if you guys are also in quarantine mode for whatever reason or just want to tune into me and Anthony, talk about what's going on in the world of Ethereum, tune into that. Which again, like Rand said, a significant part of it will be dedicated to the fact that it is Ethereum's 6th birthday today, Friday.
00:09:53.702 - 00:10:05.562, Speaker B: Ethereum, July 30. The first block ever for Ethereum was mined on July 30, 2015. And it is Ethereum's 6th birthday today. So happy birthday, Ethereum.
00:10:05.706 - 00:10:22.450, Speaker A: Happy birthday, Ethereum. Six years old, $250,000,000,000 network. Not too bad for a six year old. I can't believe it's still so young. Half the age of bitcoin at this point. We've come a long way, so definitely something to celebrate. Wow, guys, a lot of psas today.
00:10:22.520 - 00:10:23.854, Speaker B: Before we go any further, Ryan.
00:10:23.902 - 00:10:24.500, Speaker A: Yeah?
00:10:24.950 - 00:10:30.038, Speaker B: Here's an Ethereum birthday pop quiz trivia moment for you. What block are we on right now?
00:10:30.124 - 00:10:48.902, Speaker A: Dude, I don't know that. I don't measure things in block time. I'll never forget the time. When was it Vitalik who told us like a block time when we schedule a conversation or something? I don't speak in block time. So why don't you tell me? I'm going to fail this quiz.
00:10:49.046 - 00:10:54.494, Speaker B: Roughly 13 million block numbers. But it will be out tomorrow at the time of recording. Yeah.
00:10:54.612 - 00:11:01.754, Speaker A: 13 million. Okay, there you go. That's a lot of blocks every 6 seconds. Impressive. All right, David, do you want to get to markets?
00:11:01.802 - 00:11:02.798, Speaker B: Let's do it.
00:11:02.964 - 00:11:08.370, Speaker A: All right, markets. Where are we going? Where have we come from with bitcoin this week?
00:11:08.520 - 00:11:33.466, Speaker B: Bitcoin, we started the week at 32,000 and a half, 3500. And we hit the high of $41,000. And we are currently just below $40,000 at three. 9800. So bitcoin, pretty good week. Up and to the right for basically the whole entire week. Interestingly, there was this price drama going on and this rumor that Amazon would be accepting crypto and bitcoin as payment.
00:11:33.466 - 00:11:40.390, Speaker B: And that turned out to be a false rumor. But that rumor jacked up the price specifically on the 26th.
00:11:40.550 - 00:11:41.834, Speaker A: Is that what this huge spike is?
00:11:41.872 - 00:12:07.366, Speaker B: That's what that huge spike is. Yeah. So bitcoin on the 26th, it went from 35,000, and then just a few moments later, it was at 38 and a half thousand. And this actually caused a significant number of short liquidations. Usually you only see long liquidations come when people were over leveraged, and then the price goes down. But we actually saw short liquidations, which caused the price to jump up. So that's what happened in the last week of bitcoin price.
00:12:07.548 - 00:12:25.466, Speaker A: Yeah, that's funny. I tweeted out that it seemed like somebody told Jeff Bezos that Elon bought had. He's like. He's like fomoing in with billionaire stuff, but turned out none of that is true. I don't even know if Bezos is interested in crypto at all. I've never heard him, never heard a comment on it.
00:12:25.488 - 00:12:26.060, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:26.430 - 00:12:33.786, Speaker A: So I guess that remains true. So what's the story behind a whole bunch of the shorters who are liquidated with this price jump?
00:12:33.978 - 00:13:14.954, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say so. Crypto markets, they have momentum to them, significant momentum. And that's why bear markets can just be super prolonged, irregardless of strong fundamental positive catalysts, and vice versa, while bull markets can go on for way too long, even though prices get out way too far ahead of its key tips. Crypto markets have momentum, and I think people have been trying to position themselves using that frame of reference. Right. Oh, like ether capped out at 4000, bitcoin capped out at 60,000. And now we had that big wreckage moment where everyone got liquidated, and then now it went from time for number to go up into time for number to go down.
00:13:14.954 - 00:13:38.206, Speaker B: And I think a lot of people piled into the number go down trade, and too many people piled into that trade. And also, I think the four year cycles are broken, in my opinion. And so too many people got short too quickly, and they were betting on a down market, but instead they got a crab market. And in a crab market, things also go up, like, at least for the short term. And so a lot of hopping crab. Yeah, it's a hopping, hopping crab.
00:13:38.318 - 00:13:38.814, Speaker A: Jumps.
00:13:38.862 - 00:13:48.626, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember it was either last week or two weeks ago, Ryan, we were talking about how the market was crabs with bear arms to this week it's a crab with bullhorns.
00:13:48.818 - 00:14:04.134, Speaker A: Yeah. With strong legs, able to leap and jump and do all sorts of tricks. So 1 billion of bitcoin futures was liquidated in a twelve hour period of time. This is on July 26. That's what you're talking about. All right. What's the story with Eth.
00:14:04.134 - 00:14:11.258, Speaker A: So we are happy because we are above two k. That is a good sign. But where were we and where have we come this week?
00:14:11.344 - 00:14:35.374, Speaker B: Yeah, ether started at $2,300, hit a low of 22 at 50. The high for the week is 23 50, and the current price is $2,325. Pretty flat week for ETH if you keep on zooming out, Ryan. It didn't really do too much, not a lot of volatility in the last, like seven days or, you know, generally pretty flat with a slight up until the right trend.
00:14:35.422 - 00:14:46.998, Speaker A: I would say it kind of followed that bitcoin jump with the Amazon news and then sort know tracked similar to bitcoin. But let's talk about that. So how about the ratio? What are we looking at this week?
00:14:47.164 - 00:15:24.894, Speaker B: Yeah, the ratio is in this, what I would call a falling wedge pattern. Again, not a trader, but this is the pattern that I'm seeing. We are at kind of a low price of 00:58, a local low, still a historically high price. I would like to see that number come up above zero six, but still in that crab season territory. So nothing too significant to report here. There's generally a theme of people kind of piling into a bitcoin trade right now. Bitcoin tends to lead the market, and so while we are in crab season, people are kind of looking for bitcoin to be the first thing to break that crab season trend.
00:15:24.894 - 00:15:33.880, Speaker B: And so there's just a little bit of rumors going around of people just kind of rotating into bitcoin thinking that it's going to be the first mover to break out of the trade. We will see.
00:15:34.490 - 00:15:40.406, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. We'll see. How about DFI pulse? What is the total locked value of DFI this week?
00:15:40.508 - 00:16:01.246, Speaker B: Yeah, if I remember correctly, last week it was something like 56 or $57 billion. And we are up to $66 billion locked in DFI. So definitely broke out of a local trading or local, it's funny to call it trading range, but still kind of works. The chart, it's higher than it has been in the last like month or so. Coming in at $66.6 billion locked in.
00:16:01.268 - 00:16:12.178, Speaker A: DFI, more getting locked up. And then how about the DFI pulse index? So this is a measure, of course, of the health of DFI tokens. Where are we on the week?
00:16:12.344 - 00:16:28.614, Speaker B: Yeah, same story, slight up into the right trend. Coming in at just roughly $300 per dpi token higher than it was. I believe it was like 285 ish last week as well. So same story as ether not as up as much as bitcoin is, but still up and to the right.
00:16:28.812 - 00:16:54.686, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems like they're all kind of correlated together, too. Like DFI, bitcoin and ETH in this last week's moved and in the crab market in general, it's been sort of the case. How about the DPI to ETH chart? I know this is a ratio we've been tracking for a while to see if we are in the precipice of another Defi summer season hasn't come. We're in July, going into August, and we still haven't seen Defi Summer. Is the story continuing there?
00:16:54.788 - 00:17:17.320, Speaker B: Yeah, the Defi tokens are definitely not going to be the first ones to move, in my opinion. If people are waiting for bitcoin, people are going to be waiting for ether before they're waiting for DFI tokens. So coming in at zero eight five dpi per ETH, which is below my zero point 13 bottom call, but still in approximate area. So I'm still pretty happy about it.
00:17:17.790 - 00:17:22.038, Speaker A: Yeah. So has it been two weeks that we've been below David?
00:17:22.134 - 00:17:27.338, Speaker B: No, we were at. No, we're fine.
00:17:27.424 - 00:17:27.770, Speaker A: Okay.
00:17:27.840 - 00:17:28.282, Speaker B: We're fine.
00:17:28.336 - 00:17:49.774, Speaker A: We'll check next week. We'll be checking back on this. Bankless listeners, got to hold David accountable for his calls here. All right, let's talk about this. The bankless bed index. So this is a new index put together by the bankless dow, of which we are huge proponents of. Super exciting, because it is an opportunity to get a third bitcoin, a third eth, and a third defi.
00:17:49.774 - 00:18:20.700, Speaker A: So that's through the DPI index. So it's like an index within an index, but you just kind of buy it, set it, and forget it. Nice asset. I think we're going to be looking at this on a weekly basis. This is kind of a proxy, I guess, for crypto success in general for crypto monies and also DFI. And we are up on the week from, it looks like, what, 100 to about 115 on this. And we did make a promise, I think, or you did on Twitter, David, that somebody who.
00:18:20.700 - 00:18:24.786, Speaker A: What's going on here? Is this a pancake? Is this an Olympics pancake?
00:18:24.918 - 00:18:41.298, Speaker B: People make pancake art, right. And there's a lot of memory jokes with the whole bed index. Like, get in bed with bankless, get in breakfast in bed. Yeah. Eat all your three food groups. Bitcoin, ether, DPI. And so there was an Olympic pancake art made.
00:18:41.298 - 00:18:53.778, Speaker B: And then we tweeted out saying, if somebody makes this for the bed index. We'll feature it in the roll up. So here it is. Somebody's making the bankless. And this is also bankless dow. This is an index out of the Dow, bankless dow. The beta index pancake.
00:18:53.778 - 00:19:00.470, Speaker B: Here it is for all the viewers on the YouTube, so make sure you eat all your food groups and also your yummy pancakes as well.
00:19:00.620 - 00:19:07.306, Speaker A: Got the color scheme right, too, which is impressive. So not just the design, but the color. Who do we have to thank for that?
00:19:07.488 - 00:19:57.386, Speaker B: Looks like XofI three with the ultrasound money meme emojis in the Twitter handle. So thank you for that, Ryan. If you go back to the bed page, bankless listeners who are religious listeners of the weekly roll up, they will know that we go through bitcoin and then ether and then DPI. Well, what is the bed index other than bitcoin and ether and DPI? And so while we talk about bitcoin and ether and DPI separately, when we want to really summarize the market section, we're just going to turn to the bed index, and that is what it's for. And so while we'll talk about bitcoin was up this much, ether was up this much, and DPI was up this much. When we summarize it all together and show that the bed index was up 11% of the week, there is your weekly average defined by the bed index. And that's why the bed index is so cool.
00:19:57.386 - 00:20:03.902, Speaker B: It is literally all, like I said, the food groups of crypto assets. And I put out this tweet thread last.
00:20:03.956 - 00:20:05.200, Speaker A: There's only three food.
00:20:05.650 - 00:20:48.790, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right. Bitcoin, ether, and DPI cover everything. So I put out this tweet thread that kind of goes into why I think the bet index is going to be the best performing crypto asset index ever. And that's because it hits all of the major groups. It hits the crypto monies and the crypto finances, and it does it, in my opinion, in a 50 50 ratio. Right? So bitcoin and ether, these are crypto monies, and DPI is crypto finance. But ether itself is also an index of Ethereum itself, thanks to the power of EIP 1559, because EIP 1559, it links the Ethereum application layer, the Ethereum economy, to the value and scarcity of eth.
00:20:48.790 - 00:21:18.514, Speaker B: So as finance on Ethereum grows, Ethereum grows more scarce. This is the ultrasound money thesis. And so ether, the asset, which is why we all love it so much, is one part money, one part exposure to ethereum the economy. And so it's a little bit of both. It's 50% money, it's 50% finance, bitcoin is 100% money, and DPI is 100% finance. And so this is, in my mind, the most balanced perfected index of all time. And while you think it's such a simple index because it's only three tokens, bitcoin, ether, DPI.
00:21:18.514 - 00:21:49.374, Speaker B: DPI has 14 tokens inside of it. And while bitcoin and ether are forever and they're never going to change, DPI has the ability to update and iterate and evolve, as the Ethereum app layer does. And so you get the balance of monies that should not change, should not be tinkered with. And then finance, which always changes and always updates. And so it's both the long term hold and the flexible token that updates along with the growth of the industry. I just think it's super elegant, and that's why I'm super bullish on bet.
00:21:49.572 - 00:22:18.194, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a great mix here too, David, and largely super positive feedback. But some people have pinged me and been, you know, been listening to bankless. It's clear you guys are a bit more bullish eth than you are. Maybe bitcoin, though we are bullish both. And I would have loved to have seen maybe a ratio of 50% eth to some lower percentage of bitcoin. But you know what the response to that is? Buy some additional etH. Sure, you could buy bed and then buy some additional etH, or maybe bitcoin.
00:22:18.242 - 00:22:20.360, Speaker B: And then lp it and get those.
00:22:20.990 - 00:22:36.894, Speaker A: Exactly. You can lp it into uniswap. And so take advantage of the success of bed index trading transaction fees. So there's lots of ways to play this, guys. Really cool new primitive. I think that's been added to the stack. We'll be talking about that in the future too.
00:22:37.012 - 00:23:01.830, Speaker B: There's also a comment to be made there about the credible neutrality that is part of the bankless thesis. Bankless. We like credible neutrality. And that one third, one third, one third allows us to be unappinionated as to what's going to do well. And the indices are supposed to rebalance, right? So as one outperforms the other, the indices rebalances. And so that one third split between all three is a credibly neutral way to do this. And that's what the bankless thesis is all about.
00:23:01.980 - 00:23:32.426, Speaker A: The only thing I would have loved to see if there was some sort of completely trustless version of bitcoin on Ethereum which we don't have now, this uses wrapped BTC, which is still somewhat banked when you have bitco as a custodian. But perhaps in the future, I think this index could change. It could add staking assets of eTh. It could add different variations of bitcoin as well. David, let's talk about this. Axie continues to grow, man. Some people thought it was, like, just a blow off the top, but it is still crushing it.
00:23:32.426 - 00:23:53.894, Speaker A: In terms of market cap, let me switch to market cap, actually here. Almost 3 billion market cap for Axie Infinity. We're down a little bit on that. But is that really the story here is like, axie hasn't stopped. It's just continuing to pump in terms of price. Yeah.
00:23:53.932 - 00:24:14.350, Speaker B: For bankless listeners that watch the state of the nation with axe, that first peak, 1.5 billion. That's where we had Jiho on from state of the nation. And I kind of facetiously, behind the scenes, said, like, oh, yeah, this is when bankless is getting the axe guys on the show. This is probably a local top. I was completely wrong about that. There have been two more tots even after that show.
00:24:14.350 - 00:24:23.360, Speaker B: And so the just magnitude of this run by AXS has been absolutely insane and just has no signs of really stopping anytime soon.
00:24:24.130 - 00:24:58.218, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to zoom out more because let me check that. You want to check this date. So this date time in 2020 is when we first profiled, the first bankless article came out about Axio Infinity and how crypto games were going to be absolutely massive and how AXS was a really interesting asset and game in that space. At the time, market cap was under $10 million. Now here we are, 2.3 billion guys. It pays to stay attention in the.
00:24:58.224 - 00:25:01.040, Speaker B: Space, but did you buy any of it, Ryan, at the time?
00:25:02.610 - 00:25:15.226, Speaker A: I'm not talking about my bags, David. Show for bag. Talk about you, bitcoin. You'll never know. You don't know the full extent of my NFT collection. I'm not doxing.
00:25:15.258 - 00:25:17.940, Speaker B: Oh, is it you that I'm trying to get my crypto punk from?
00:25:19.270 - 00:25:36.626, Speaker A: No, I don't sell. I only buy. All right, so, guys, that is the axe story. Another cool story is layer two. Summer optimism. Optimistic rollups just launched with optimism launching uniswap on it. And this is their daily protocol revenue, David.
00:25:36.626 - 00:25:45.290, Speaker A: So they've cleared some days, verging on ten k in terms of daily revenue, which is really cool to see any takes here.
00:25:45.440 - 00:26:06.482, Speaker B: Yeah, the comment here is that. So it begins, this is just even more data for Ryan and I to talk about in the market section. It's lovely to see these l two s generate fees because that is crypto economic sustainability. And I expect there to be just be so much data about fees generated on l two from the economic activity that they host there.
00:26:06.616 - 00:26:11.700, Speaker A: You know what, I'm going to go to website while we're here. Cryptofees info. Let's take a quick look.
00:26:12.550 - 00:26:15.990, Speaker B: I don't know if David updated it that fast.
00:26:16.140 - 00:26:29.302, Speaker A: You know, it doesn't have it, but I'm just throwing this out there. Look, Cardano, $8,000. Yeah. The l one, $8,000 in one day fee. That is about the same that optimism.
00:26:29.366 - 00:26:32.410, Speaker B: Is doing right now in a beta.
00:26:32.830 - 00:27:00.610, Speaker A: Yeah, it's kind of out there. I don't know. Like Cardano doesn't have its smart contracts. This is not a section about is what we're talking about is the way you know that a blockchain has product market fit is if it has full blocks that people are paying for. That's how you know. So really good metric to see layer two doing that. I think it's going to catch some layer ones by surprise who actually don't have that demand.
00:27:00.610 - 00:27:29.110, Speaker A: Let's talk about this headline too, David. In the market section, more than one in ten americans invested in crypto this year. So it's 10%. I don't know if that's higher or lower than what you think, but what I found was really interesting is kind of who they are. Like the demographics, it's actually more women than traditional stocks. If you compare investing in cryptocurrency to traditional stocks, more investors of color, more lower income investors, less. Fewer college educated investors.
00:27:29.110 - 00:27:45.450, Speaker A: But the big one here for me was the average age of a crypto investor, 38 compared to 47 for stocks. They're definitely skewing younger, although 38 to me is like, that's a little older than I thought crypto might be. I guess it does skew in that direction though, right?
00:27:45.540 - 00:28:09.270, Speaker B: Yeah. If you actually pile into the data, you'll actually find that just like this. I remember when I was working at a startup before bankless, we were trying to get an average profile of the typical customer. And the average age, I think, was something like 48. If you actually look into the data of who uses these platforms and who crypto people are, it's actually a little bit older than what you would think, which is pretty crazy.
00:28:09.340 - 00:28:20.010, Speaker A: It's not just like 20 somethings and kids using this stuff. The average is 38. That feels about right. Maybe skew is a little bit younger for DFI, but probably not much to your point.
00:28:20.160 - 00:28:25.130, Speaker B: The data that the chart showed tells me a story about how crypto is more inclusive.
00:28:26.270 - 00:28:40.420, Speaker A: Yeah, I hope that's the case, and I hope it continues to be the case. I think we have a lot more work to do there, but I think it will continue to be the case. Guys, we're going to be back with the releases of the week, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:28:40.790 - 00:29:20.334, Speaker C: Living a bankless life requires taking control of your own private keys. Not your keys, not your crypto. That's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallets, which makes proper private key management a breeze. But the ledger ecosystem is more than just a secure hardware wallet. Ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the ledger live app. And if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite dapps all in one place, ledger is where you want to be. Not only does ledger let you buy crypto assets straight from the app, but it also hooks into decentralized exchange aggregators like Paraswap, which makes sure that you are getting the best prices on your trades without your assets ever leaving your control.
00:29:20.334 - 00:29:50.306, Speaker C: Defi never stops growing, and the ledger live app grows alongside with it. So click the link in the show notes to see all the defi apps that ledger live has. And stay tuned as more and more apps come online. And if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet, what are you even waiting for? Go to ledger.com, grab your ledger, download ledger live, and get all of your dapps all in one place. Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure.
00:29:50.306 - 00:30:17.666, Speaker C: Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on Ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a.
00:30:17.688 - 00:30:18.994, Speaker B: While and we'll say it again.
00:30:19.112 - 00:30:47.082, Speaker C: Dows have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow apply for a grant to uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap Dow? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a Uni grant@unigrants.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
00:30:47.082 - 00:30:48.746, Speaker C: That's exactly what we did to get.
00:30:48.768 - 00:30:50.582, Speaker B: Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless.
00:30:50.646 - 00:30:55.550, Speaker C: And you can do the same for your project. Thank you, Uniswap, for sponsoring bankless.
00:30:57.170 - 00:31:21.794, Speaker A: Hey guys, we are back talking about the releases of the week. David, we have to start here. This is a hot apparel drop. I'm super excited about this. I was so excited. Already bought some of this ultrasound summer set. Includes ultrasound summer t shirt, ultrasound summer shorts, these shorts, swim shorts, am I right? So you wear these in the pool, run around the sprinkler, do your slip and slide, whatever you're doing this summer.
00:31:21.794 - 00:31:38.954, Speaker A: Just in time for EIP 15. Five nine for this drop. And this was created by the bankless Dow and somebody in the bankless Dow, Sinjin, who is an incredibly talented designer. Yeah, man, I'm super excited about this drop. I bought mine. I don't know if you bought yours yet, but.
00:31:39.072 - 00:31:40.710, Speaker B: Oh, I bought two sets.
00:31:40.870 - 00:31:41.820, Speaker A: You did?
00:31:42.190 - 00:31:45.200, Speaker B: Well, I'm going to wear it so much, I'm going to wear one out.
00:31:45.650 - 00:31:53.214, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. You want to have one for a few, couple days of the week, right? Yeah, I guess.
00:31:53.412 - 00:32:06.178, Speaker B: Plus, if I ever get fat, I got a medium and I also got a large just in case. Oh, that's smart, right? Somebody on Twitter joked, just like, yeah, one for cutting season, one for bulking season. And you're goddamn right. That's exactly.
00:32:06.264 - 00:32:07.414, Speaker A: It's kind of true.
00:32:07.612 - 00:32:16.120, Speaker B: When you add the shorts and the trunks together, the price is $155.90. I wonder how that happened.
00:32:16.730 - 00:32:41.018, Speaker A: Perfect. Fantastic calculation. You know what also came with this too, David? Well, it didn't come with it, but it is also part of this drop is the bankless nation puzzle by Percy, which is just fantastic. A thousand pieces, I think. But yeah, just a great piece of think, you know, talks about all of the themes we talk about on can people pick, where can people pick this up? David?
00:32:41.114 - 00:33:08.050, Speaker B: Yeah, if you're on Twitter, just go to the bankless dow Twitter page. But you can also go to shop metafactory AI, and you'll be able to navigate your way there. You can also type in bankless. You will see all of the previously sold out stuff. Hopefully you got some of that stuff, too. This is going to be a seven day sale. And so if you do not buy in the next seven days from the time of recording, then, so that'll end, I believe, like next Wednesday.
00:33:08.050 - 00:33:31.834, Speaker B: If you do not buy it by Wednesday, that is it. That is it. That's all you got. And so you can buy as much as you want between now and then. That's why I bought two, because I knew I wouldn't be able to buy another one later. And so if you have seven days from the time, of course, really six days, if you're hearing this on Friday, to buy this drop. And that is always going to be true for all future drops.
00:33:31.834 - 00:33:52.534, Speaker B: And this is how a metafactory and bankless dow work. We like scarcity in the world of crypto. We like the prestige. We like the status of being some of the few people that have some of these really cool drops. And so you only have one opportunity. And if you are hearing this, you got to get it right now. And so there'll be a link in the show notes, or you can go to bankless Dow Twitter page.
00:33:52.534 - 00:33:55.366, Speaker B: It'll probably also be on the bankless Twitter page as well.
00:33:55.548 - 00:34:39.458, Speaker A: Crypto culture, you could wear, guys, that's what bankless dow is up to. All right, man, let's talk about this polygon doubling down on gaming. Good time to double down on crypto gaming. And nfTs. They just launched a hundred million dollar fund, I think, with Atari. Do you remember the old Atari system? They are back in action. They published some games, and they're partnering with Atari and creating this fund, I think, to continue funding and doubling down on this new play to earn crypto gaming model that we've seen be so successful with Axie and in particular David side chains and layer twos, where gas fees are low to nothing and block space is plentiful.
00:34:39.458 - 00:34:41.254, Speaker A: That's the place to do it.
00:34:41.452 - 00:35:14.626, Speaker B: Absolutely. You need that instant finality and those cheap transactions. Otherwise, just gaming is not a thing. And it's really advantageous for Polygon and their polytoken, which, or, excuse me, their matic token, which has done really well to start to turn themselves into a fund to invest on their own l two, their own side chain. And so that's exactly what they're doing. While it is kind of cool news that they are working with Atari, I do have information that fun fact. My first job in crypto was with an ICO advisory company back in 2018.
00:35:14.626 - 00:35:26.066, Speaker B: And Atari was one of our clients. The Atari name is actually kind of just a shell company. The name has just been passed around. So it's no longer the Atari of old. It's the same company, ogs from the.
00:35:26.088 - 00:35:27.730, Speaker A: 1970S who created the company.
00:35:27.800 - 00:35:50.640, Speaker B: Still the same system, but it's not filled by the people that made the OG game the brand that is. It's the brand. Right. And so, while it is exciting that Atari is working with people in crypto, they've been trying to do this for ages now. And so that, unfortunately, is not really the cool part of the news. The cool part of the news is that Polygon is investing with $100 million into gaming on top of Polygon. That's the news that you guys should take away.
00:35:50.640 - 00:36:04.122, Speaker B: Should take away with this from. And so, I love games. I play games all the time. I would love to play games with combinations of crypto assets. So I'm excited to see what comes out the end of this 100 million dollar gaming fund on Polygon.
00:36:04.266 - 00:36:20.582, Speaker A: Me too. I think it's going to be boom time. I mean, people have seen the success of Axie. Now we've got the funding taken care of, so it's all going to be a lot of experience playing out here in the future. All right, let's talk about this. David. Ave Arc, we've talked about it a few times.
00:36:20.582 - 00:36:43.482, Speaker A: I think in the theme of institutional defi compound, of course, released a treasury app targeted towards institutions, and now Ave is doing the same. They have released Ave arc. I know you were with Stani, actually last week talking a little bit about this, but what is it? And did Stani give any indication on when it's coming? David?
00:36:43.626 - 00:37:18.550, Speaker B: Yeah, just like you said, it's the Aave's version of Compound treasury called Ave Arc. Love the name, love the branding, and is just basically a fractal off of Aave itself. That is the permissioned fractal. Right. So it's built on top of the Aave protocol, or built, excuse me, not on top of, but in, adjacent to, also governed by the Aave token holders. So that's interesting. And it's just a KYC AML compliant version of AAve that allows some of these institutions to be more comfortable with who they are engaging with.
00:37:18.550 - 00:38:06.630, Speaker B: And so it's basically a protocolized version of AAve for institutions. And the main question that I asked Stani when I interviewed him at ECC is, why did you build this? Did you build this because you think you can entice institutions with it, or did you build this because institutions are asking for it? And Stani unequivocally said that it is the latter, it is because institutions have come to Ave and said, ave, we love what you're doing. We want some of these stuff, but we can't compliantly use it without this, this and this. And so Ave and went ahead and built this, this and this. And now there is Ave Arc, which is Ave for institutions. He said that they'll be launching sometime towards the end of this month, but it is currently the end of this month, so maybe it's now in the soon tm category.
00:38:07.050 - 00:38:18.570, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And shared liquidity with the rest of the Ave protocol, is that correct? So will this be a separate liquidity pool or does it share the rest liquidity with everything that's non Aml KYc?
00:38:20.750 - 00:38:35.140, Speaker B: I don't know for certain. So do your own research on this. I think it has to be separate liquidity because the liquidity has to come from KYC individuals. And if you are using AAve, you are not KYC. And so institutions can't touch you by that.
00:38:36.470 - 00:39:19.982, Speaker A: Think? Yeah, I definitely think there's a subtheme here in defi that we want to continue to explore this institutional access to defi. David, let's talk about this, though. A fractional is a way to take a piece of art that you have an NFT that you have, say, a crypto punk, and sell pieces of it. You could keep the majority, but you could sell, say, 5%, 10% of it, 50%, 60%, however much you want. You can fractionalize your nFts and sell it. If you are a buyer, you can also purchase a fractional NFT. I know we had the founder of this on the podcast earlier this week with an ask me anything to talk a bit about it, but it's a really cool story.
00:39:19.982 - 00:39:23.902, Speaker A: Do you want to give the TLDR of the rest of this what I didn't cover?
00:39:24.036 - 00:40:22.846, Speaker B: Yeah, there's two parts. One you covered, which is you put the ERC 721 into a contract, and then many, many ERC 20s come out of that allows you to get liquidity, allows you to do things you couldn't normally do. And then there's the other half of it, which is after you put the ERC 721 into the contract, and then you break it apart into thousands of different tokens. How do you get the thing to come back together? And so there is this reserve price sort of auction type mechanism that allows there to hot swap or atomically swap ether. Wherever the ERC 20 versions of this NFT are out and about, perhaps they're collateral in Ave. They can be collateral in Ave, but then these tokens can be sold and atomically swapped for ether, dictated by the price that it was sold at. And so this is how it can maintain collateral in these applications, because Ave or any application that needs collateral doesn't like it when collateral just gets yoinked from the protocol.
00:40:22.846 - 00:40:50.858, Speaker B: That would be terrible. That would be completely broken. But that's what needs to happen in order for these fractionalized tokens to come back together, back into a whole unit. But the way that fractional fixes this is that it yoinks the NFT collateral in Aave, but it replaces it with the sale proceeds, which are ether, which is already collateral in all these lending and borrowing applications. So really compelling application. I'm looking forward to seeing what the Defi builders can do with it.
00:40:51.024 - 00:41:11.090, Speaker A: Yeah, we use really technical terms on bankless, like yoinks. This is a really cool protocol, David. I was like stunned. And what I think that this does is it makes every single NFT that's out there more valuable. Why? Because you get a liquidity premium on it. Now you're not locked into. Yeah, exactly.
00:41:11.090 - 00:41:40.042, Speaker A: Now you're not just locked into a very expensive NFT, you can sell portions of it so it becomes much more liquid, like other ERC 20 tokens. Very cool. Primitive. I can't wait to find out what happens with this in the future. David, we should talk about this. I think this is a big piece of news. Finance is now allowing deposits and withdrawals to and from the polychain chain, the polygon chain, excuse me, which is super cool.
00:41:40.042 - 00:42:17.014, Speaker A: This is something we predicted would happen, right? Maybe the idea that the gateway to defi users won't actually be from exchange directly to Ethereum mainnet. It could start to be from exchange to sidechain or exchange to layer two. We might live our entire DFI lives in the future on layer twos, in fact, that are secured by Ethereum. So this is the start of this. And if Binance does it, you know coinbase is going to do it, Gemini is going to do it. You know, Kraken is going to do it. If they're doing it with Polygon, you know they're going to be doing it with layer twos, like optimism, ZK rollups that are coming in the future.
00:42:17.014 - 00:42:27.178, Speaker A: Arbitrum. This is just fantastic for the user experience and adoption of Ethereum's layer two ecosystem and sidechain ecosystem. So it's super cool to see.
00:42:27.344 - 00:42:54.786, Speaker B: Absolutely. Binance actually does have a stronger relationship with Matic and polygon than most other tokens, because matic actually did their ieo on Binance years and years ago. And so finance is really, really friendly to the Polygon network, and so that's probably why they got them out the door first. And this is just another story of overall l two development. Now, you don't have to go to Ethereum to get your money on polygon, so it's pretty cool. Congratulations, Mihalo and the Polygon team.
00:42:54.968 - 00:43:18.122, Speaker A: Yeah, very cool. All right, let's talk about this ether scan. Look, where would we be without ether scan? The most unappreciated project in the space. And I just mean, like, they don't get enough credit for everything that they do. This space, everyone uses Etherscan for something in their bankless defi journey. They've just added a really cool feature. What is this feature? Can you describe it, David? Right.
00:43:18.176 - 00:44:00.790, Speaker B: So if you've ever moved on your assets onto polygon, or optimism or any other layer two, you move your assets to your same address because your private keys are your private keys for your address, no matter what chain you're on. The fact that you're on a different chain doesn't change what address you use, which means that your address can be traced and tracked by Etherscan, no matter what chain you're on. And so your address is the same on matic, it's the same on optimism. It's the same on armbritrum as it all is on Ethereum and as it is on binance, smart chain, for that matter. Right? The whole thing about private public keys is actually agnostic from the blockchain. Your private keys work across all different chains. And so you can see what an address.
00:44:00.790 - 00:44:34.770, Speaker B: Now, this update from Etherscan is that you can go see what your address is doing on Ethereum, but then you can go and just click a button and see what that same address is doing on all the other chains because it's the same address. And so that's pretty cool. That's a nice little feature. So if people like, I remember when I started first using Polygon, I would go and send my money there, but there wasn't really a block explorer. I kind of felt like I was just feeling around in the dark. And now Etherscan has all of the infrastructure up and running for it, and now it's just got this easy button to see, okay, see what this address is up to on the other chains, which is a really nice feature.
00:44:35.110 - 00:45:15.954, Speaker A: This is all part of the story of, I think, ethereum and Defi rearchitecting towards a multi chain, more scalable world, not just the Ethereum main chain, which is super cool to see. This also follows that through line Rabi release announcement so Rabi is a browser extension wallet. So it's like metamask. It was put together by the folks at Dbank and their claim to fame is a smooth multi chain user experience. So you can use this across Ethereum, you can also use this across polygon and the other layer twos as well. And other layer twos as well. And I haven't used this yet.
00:45:15.954 - 00:45:52.666, Speaker A: David definitely a huge metamask fan. I love what they've done. Couldn't do anything in Defi without a combination of like metamask and maybe a ledger and some other tools in the space. But it's also good to see some competition in the browser extension wallet market. I know there's another segment of wallets I'm super bullish on, which is smart contract wallets as well, of the kind that argent is creating. But this category, aside from Metamask, doesn't really have a ton of competition on Ethereum. So competition breeds better user experience, better consumer choice, and it's a good thing.
00:45:52.666 - 00:46:02.206, Speaker A: And I'm hopeful they bring this. Like I said, I haven't tried this yet. I don't know if you have, but it's good to see some new entrants into the space. What's your take?
00:46:02.308 - 00:46:55.454, Speaker B: Yeah, I've got it downloaded and it seems to be very similar to a user experience as metamask, maybe with a little bit of an improvement on the UI, maybe. I haven't created an address yet, but I'll probably do that relatively soon. Just like you said, competition, really, really good for the consumer. The one hurdle that rabi is going to have to get over is that now all of our favorite apps ave compound, gnosis, safe, all the things that integrate with Metamask, they're also going to need to also integrate with Rabi. And so that is going to be the challenge for the Rabi team, is to promote their own integrations into all the other defi apps that we all know and love. Because while it's fantastic that there is a second browser extension wallet that we can all now use, it doesn't mean anything if we can't connect it to compound or Aave or all the other defi apps that we use. I also think that the hair, because Rabi stands for rabbit, means rabbit.
00:46:55.454 - 00:46:58.340, Speaker B: The hair versus the Fox meme is going to be kind of fun.
00:46:59.910 - 00:47:23.882, Speaker A: I didn't even catch that. Yeah, absolutely clever. Let's talk about this in the releases, lira, the Dow raised $3.3 million. This is an options protocol that's going to be native to l two. So options are the biggest financial options and derivatives the biggest financial markets in the world. And they've certainly caught on in crypto, but they've just been centralized up to this point.
00:47:23.882 - 00:48:11.178, Speaker A: So the bitmexes and Binance and the FTX, they have massive options, massive derivatives markets right now. But the DeFi markets aren't of comparable size. Right? Like uniswap almost surpassed coinbase for some days last year. It's getting to coinbase size in terms of trading volume. But the Defi derivative space and option space is just tiny compared to what's going on in centralized exchange. So everyone's asking, why haven't derivatives and options taken off in defi yet? And the reason I think that some companies are saying is basically because we haven't had cheap gas space. The computation required to create some of these products has not been available.
00:48:11.178 - 00:48:33.230, Speaker A: It's been too expensive up to now. And so that's what lira is doing. They're basically deploying, I think, on the optimism network. They'll probably do arbitram as well. And they're starting there. They're not even starting on main chain in order to make a product that is competitive. And we'll see what happens with this next generation of DFI options and derivatives products.
00:48:33.380 - 00:49:05.498, Speaker B: Yeah, I fully expect options to be a fully built out financial paradigm in DFI by the end of this year. And it's going to be on l two. Like you said, this couldn't even have worked out on the l one. This is not an l one product that could happen. You need scale, you need scalability to be able to make this work. And so now that we have l two, we are now going to see options. And so I'm excited to be able to finally tap into a very, very important financial primitive on Ethereum, directly on.
00:49:05.504 - 00:49:51.206, Speaker A: Ethereum security, other derivatives products to look out for in the d five space, of course, DYDX, which is fully migrated to a layer two, a Zk roll up layer two, and also take a look at perpetual protocol. They are on XDI as sort of their sidechain type experience. So it's all happening on layer twos and side chains up to this point. David, let's talk about this. The blockchain unicorn, another blockchain unicorn project, fireblocks just raised $310,000,000 backed by Sequoia Stripe Spark Capital, a bunch of vcs, including Thailand's oldest bank. I think we should have fireblocks on the podcast in the future because it's a really interesting story around institutional deFi. I think they're providing.
00:49:51.206 - 00:50:29.400, Speaker A: So they're providing like staking services. It seems to me like a bitgo that's a bit more forward thinking and forward leaning in terms of protocols that they're supporting. So it's meant for institutions who can't custody their own assets but want to get involved in staking DFI, some of these other things and seems like a big market. These vcs are anticipating a really large market for this. That's why fireblocks is getting the funding and gearing up to scale even more like $310,000,000. Dude. I mean, how do you even spend all of that? That's definitely like a bull market raise here.
00:50:29.400 - 00:50:59.466, Speaker A: So I think that's it as far as we have for raises. David, we should also talk about, you know, I've been getting pinged here a lot recently from folks in the bankless community who are like, hey, I just made the leap. I was in the traditional job. I just made the leap into crypto. It was partially because of the bankless program. If you are in bankless, if you're absorbing this content, chances are you might be looking for a job in crypto in the near future. We put together a jobs board just for that purpose.
00:50:59.466 - 00:51:19.926, Speaker A: There's close to 40 jobs on here. One was just posted this week is a senior product manager from Immutable Mutable X. These are the folks behind gods unchained. They're building some really cool gaming scalability technology. We've got a full stack engineer from pallet. Those are the folks, actually that helped create this job board. So thanks to pallet for that.
00:51:19.926 - 00:51:40.838, Speaker A: Senior solidity engineer from Quant Finance, chief investment officer, yield app, software engineer from Arbitrum, a senior designer from pool. Together, guys, there are a ton of opportunities right now in crypto. Now is the time to get plugged in, start looking, see where you can add value in this ecosystem and take the next step on the bankless journey.
00:51:40.934 - 00:52:05.746, Speaker B: And don't think that these jobs aren't for you. These jobs are for you, depending on your skill set, depending on what you can do. And also just the magic of working with other crypto people inside of crypto is completely different than just like consuming bankless podcasts for the rest of your life. Like, get a job in the industry and you'll get ahead even faster than listening to bankless, which is something to.
00:52:05.768 - 00:52:08.846, Speaker A: Say, yeah, you're telling us to get a job, huh, David?
00:52:08.878 - 00:52:10.070, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm telling you, get a job.
00:52:10.220 - 00:52:23.802, Speaker A: Get a job. Get a job, guys. All right, let's go to news man. A lot of news this week. We hopefully we'll have time to cover it all. The first is this. PayPal's crypto division wants to roll out a super app.
00:52:23.802 - 00:53:12.106, Speaker A: So not just PayPal's crypto division, but I think all of crypto wants to evolve their app into something that's a bit more complete, like a super app. This kind of reminds me of the conversation, the recording we just had with Richard Turin, who was talking about China's central bank digital currency and China's fintech infrastructure, where they have real super apps like Alipay and Wechat, where you're doing your social media and also all of your banking inside of one super app. It's your life. It's your whole thing, right? Like, I text you to pay you, and it's all inside of WeChat. It seems like PayPal is trying to get there. And maybe, just maybe, David, they're going to rely on some crypto features to help them get there, maybe not relying so much on the traditional banking system. I don't know.
00:53:12.106 - 00:53:14.378, Speaker A: That's a hope. We'll have to see. What's your take?
00:53:14.544 - 00:53:43.758, Speaker B: I have. I honestly have no idea what's coming. Those terms super f definitely jogs my mind into exactly what you just said. But the other place that my mind goes is that we were joking with Jim Bianco when he came on the podcast and all of his friends were like, all right, I downloaded coinbase. Where's the defi? And I think maybe PayPal is trying to make the defi page. It's like, oh, yeah, here's borrowing and lending. Maybe they do the obfuscation, as in they have compound Ave.
00:53:43.758 - 00:54:01.046, Speaker B: All these apps in the background, Uniswap, matcha, they're all in the background. And then PayPal just does all the interface. Like kind of like, maybe. Maybe it's like the instadap model is where they just kind of obfuscate everything. I'm not too sure what's going on. Maybe they're also doing identity. Who knows?
00:54:01.158 - 00:54:16.718, Speaker A: Well, here's the thing, David is like, from our conversation with Richard Turin, right? So the banks in China, and you guys will hear this podcast. It comes out not next week, but the week after. This is all about chinese central bank digital currency. It's a must. Listen to your episode, guys.
00:54:16.804 - 00:54:19.886, Speaker B: You're going to be hearing about us and me and Ryan talk about it in the future.
00:54:19.988 - 00:54:46.470, Speaker A: Yeah. It's going to blow your mind. Right. But in China, they basically allowed their fintech companies, their big tech companies, to eat the banks. Right. In the US, in western countries, we didn't do. So, like, if PayPal wants to build a super app with social media and also the super advanced banking and payment infrastructure, I don't see how they're going to be able to do it.
00:54:46.470 - 00:55:11.630, Speaker A: The closest they can get is not with a traditional banking system, but they almost have to build on crypto rails. Right. So your point? Maybe they're thinking about an instant app. I have no idea if they're thinking about that. I have no idea if they're there yet, if they understand DFI enough to start to do that, but they're almost going to be forced to in the future because they can't build a super app on traditional banking infrastructure from the 1970s, can they?
00:55:11.700 - 00:55:23.138, Speaker B: Right. Yeah, you're absolutely right. They cannot do some of the banking stuff that they want to do, but they can do defi. Right. They can grow the Defi mullet. And so maybe that's kind of. Maybe the super app.
00:55:23.138 - 00:55:58.478, Speaker B: Maybe the super app branding, marketing isn't for you and me, Ryan. Maybe it's for the legacy people who don't know what DeFi is. And then PayPal, and this has always been the promise of the Defi mullet from day one, is PayPal can hook into uniswap, hook into compound, hook into maker, hook into whatever, and then they can just present that as their own finance product in the front end, like, oh, hey, here's PayPal's exchange feature. Here's PayPal's low interest loans. They don't have to advertise it as ave or compound. They can advertise it as PayPal. There's nothing wrong with that.
00:55:58.644 - 00:56:02.734, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. How do you get a 4% savings account? Don't worry about that.
00:56:02.772 - 00:56:05.470, Speaker B: Don't ask. PayPal's brand new product.
00:56:05.620 - 00:56:29.526, Speaker A: Yeah, and we'll insure it and it'll be fine consumer. Exactly. Yeah, I think that could be the case. All right, let's talk about this. This is maybe partially why bitcoin price Eth price went up and then kind of fell back down. Amazon jobs just released a digital currency and blockchain product lead job description. So they're trying to hire someone for digital currency and blockchain products.
00:56:29.526 - 00:56:31.080, Speaker A: I wonder what this means.
00:56:31.930 - 00:56:46.398, Speaker B: I can only think that it means that crypto is taking over the world and now it's finally trying to take over Amazon. So if you are in the local Seattle area, go ahead and apply to Amazon for getting this job. And also Amazon come post this on the bankless jobs board.
00:56:46.564 - 00:56:49.978, Speaker A: Oh, definitely. They should. You're in Seattle, David.
00:56:50.074 - 00:56:52.798, Speaker B: Currently in Seattle. Only temporarily while I'm in quarantine. Yeah.
00:56:52.884 - 00:56:55.598, Speaker A: All right. You would apply for this. I'm sure this would be you.
00:56:55.604 - 00:56:57.060, Speaker B: I think I could be a product lead.
00:56:58.070 - 00:57:01.938, Speaker A: I think you'd do anything. I believe in you, David. You could do anything.
00:57:02.024 - 00:57:02.354, Speaker B: All right.
00:57:02.392 - 00:57:02.962, Speaker A: Definitely be.
00:57:03.016 - 00:57:08.550, Speaker B: We're going to get somebody else for the next week's bankless weekly roll up. See me at Amazon.
00:57:09.370 - 00:57:17.330, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about this Jack. Jack Dorsey, the ETH troll. I don't know, man. What's up with this tweet?
00:57:17.410 - 00:57:44.266, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's the Olympics. And so all the three letter country codes now have flags associated with them. And Jack decided to tweet out hashtag ETh for Ethiopia with the ethiopian flag. But granted, there are many, many countries that have the flag with them. And Jack decided to tweet out specifically hashtag ETH, which everyone kind of interpreted as a troll to the Ethereum community.
00:57:44.308 - 00:57:45.602, Speaker A: Because Jack, we all know what it means.
00:57:45.656 - 00:58:18.502, Speaker B: We all know what it means. Jack, he's known bitcoin, maxi Twitter. If you do hashtag BTC, you get the bitcoin logo or dollar sign. BNB, you get the binance coin logo. And if you do the dollar sign eth, you don't get anything. And to some degree, the Ethereum people don't really want it, but it definitely shows Jack's colors as very much a non eth person who's trying to troll eth. And I kind of got upset about this because, and you're not supposed to get upset about this because you don't want to feed the trolls.
00:58:18.502 - 00:58:45.490, Speaker B: But what did upset me is that I am a big proponent of mindfulness. And maybe that's ironic that I just said I got upset about it, but I'm a big proponent of mindfulness, and so is Jack. And so is Jack. Yet he is so goddamn biased about bitcoin versus ether, and he just wanted to troll the entire Ethereum community. And so it bugs me that a guy who's a proponent of mindfulness is also just unable to get out of his own maximalist shell.
00:58:46.390 - 00:59:25.140, Speaker A: Yeah, I do think that's going on now. You could interpret this troll as, like, just a light hearted jab. I like this sports team, you like that sports team. And I'm just going to be like, just a jab at you. Although I will say, look, man, Jack has just come out recently talking about building Defi, right? Jack's version of Defi at square. On what? On his, his value system that he purports is very much like open source, protocol centric decentralization, right? That's what he preaches. And then we have this whole defi ecosystem that we've built out in Ethereum and Jack totally ignores it.
00:59:25.140 - 00:59:40.454, Speaker A: I just don't understand why at this point. But one explanation is like, all in know, maximalism. But let's talk about the cool story here, which I think that's only the first part. But what did the Ethereum community do as a reaction to this?
00:59:40.572 - 00:59:51.850, Speaker B: Oh, they just completely owned it. They were like, oh, yeah, I guess we're friends with Ethiopia now. Like, oh, Ethiopia is eth. We're eth. Ethereum now. Best friends with Ethiopia.
00:59:53.230 - 01:00:12.554, Speaker A: So yeah, you saw all these great memes of ethiopian flag and Ethereum together and ethiopian foods and all sorts of things. Anyway, it was just a fun meme, I think, for the Internet. And good thing to do if you are being trolled in this way is don't fight back, just own it. It's a lesson for everyone on the Internet.
01:00:12.682 - 01:00:25.540, Speaker B: And even coin Gecko got in on the fund. So if you go to Ether or Ethereum on coin gecko, it now has the ethiopian flag on it. And then this tweet got 4.6 thousand likes. How many likes did Jack tweets get?
01:00:26.230 - 01:00:27.202, Speaker A: A bit more there.
01:00:27.256 - 01:00:29.442, Speaker B: Oh, 28,000. All right, well, he's the founder of Twitter.
01:00:29.506 - 01:00:31.398, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, 28,000.
01:00:31.564 - 01:00:33.026, Speaker B: Home field territory.
01:00:33.218 - 01:01:22.662, Speaker A: Yeah, he's got a lot of followers, I'd say. All right, let's talk about this, David, because this was alarming, I think to some in the crypto space. Token access on app, uniswap.org, that is the front end of the website that is officially hosted by the Uniswap Labs team. They delisted, at least in the application layer, some assets, particularly synthetic type assets, the types of assets that centralized exchanges have been delisting, like the synthetic Tesla and the synthetic stocks and this sort of thing. And this appears, and I think they say explicitly in the post, this is as a result of increased regulatory scrutiny on the space. So a whole bunch of people in crypto, of course, bitcoin maximus jumped on this and said, uniswap is never decentralized in the first place.
01:01:22.662 - 01:01:41.758, Speaker A: And other folks who have not been in the space as long also started saying, hey, this is really concerning what happened to this permissionless open decentralization thing. If Uniswap can just delist, you know, what actually happened here? What's the real story here?
01:01:41.844 - 01:02:11.650, Speaker B: Okay, so there's two uniswaps. There's Uniswap the protocol, and then there's the Uniswap application front end that Uniswap Labs operates, and the Uniswap labs has an exchange. Think they have their own exchange. Think it's like it's a binance. It's a coinbase, it's a Gemini. It's a uniswap. And that Uniswap, instead of having their own order book on their centralized data layer database, instead, like all the other ones I just listed, instead they just tap into Uniswap the protocol.
01:02:11.650 - 01:02:29.926, Speaker B: And so Uniswap, the front end run by Uniswap labs, taps into Uniswap the protocol. Uniswap the protocol. And this is not about that at all. Nothing changed about Uniswap the protocol. Uniswap labs, their front end. You can no longer get these synthetic assets to appear. That's what they mean by delisting.
01:02:29.926 - 01:03:02.754, Speaker B: But the tokens themselves still have liquidity, still are assets on the Uniswap exchange, and you can go to the Uniswap protocol and trade them as you see fit. That has not changed at all. And so treating Uniswap labs front end as an exchange, they want to not get involved with any regulators whatsoever. They're just a front end. And so they compliantly delisted all of these synthetic assets so that they wouldn't have to deal with any regulation issues. It's not even what they're trying to do anyways. They don't even make money from providing a front end to the Uniswap protocol.
01:03:02.754 - 01:03:27.710, Speaker B: Now, just like you said, two cohorts of people I noticed made a bunch of noise about this. The bitcoin maxis, or the people who generally just don't want Ethereum to succeed. And so they said, oh, yeah, Uniswap's always been completely centralized, completely censorable. We knew it all along. And to me, they are just broadcasting how incredibly naive and biased they are because they're just showing.
01:03:28.050 - 01:03:43.278, Speaker A: I got called scammer. People dug up. I'm sure you did. Uniswap daily, I get called scammer. But specifically in this event, bitcoiner maximalists were very angry, and they felt like this was a chink in Ethereum's defi armor.
01:03:43.374 - 01:04:10.886, Speaker B: They're refusing to learn why we're so excited about this whole defi thing in the first place. It's so incredibly ironic. They come to you and they say, ryan, you're a scammer. You said Uniswap was decentralized. And if they are telling you that you're a scammer because of this, they're the scammer because they're trying to create a false narrative about to try and get them to buy bitcoin. And it's like, oh, yeah, Defi could have never worked. Yeah, it gets so frustrating.
01:04:11.078 - 01:04:12.602, Speaker A: All right, so that's the one group, right?
01:04:12.656 - 01:04:40.006, Speaker B: That's the one group. And then there's the newer people who come into the space and say, oh, Uniswap delisted tokens. I thought the whole thing about this was censorship resistance. And you're totally right, and it absolutely is. And that's why it's important to understand the difference between the front end and the back end. And the back end is a censorship resistant protocol built on Ethereum doing all the things that Ethereum is supposed to let them do. And the crazy thing is, the most frustrating thing is we've done this before, like we did this two years ago.
01:04:40.006 - 01:04:47.410, Speaker B: This is the same story. And so, Ryan, you wrote this in December 9, 2019, titled Unstoppable Liquidity.
01:04:47.490 - 01:04:49.206, Speaker A: Tell us why you scamming people.
01:04:49.308 - 01:04:52.790, Speaker B: I was just scamming people left and right. Why did you write this article?
01:04:52.870 - 01:05:25.038, Speaker A: I wanted to scam everyone. No, it was because a similar incident happened in 2019 where there was a regulatory scare around. I think it's OFAC countries. So these are countries on basically, like, the international ban list or like, the US's ban list. So Iran, North Korea, some other countries that the US has legal trade embargoes against. And so what happened was Uniswap was unavailable. The official Uniswap site became unavailable to specific countries.
01:05:25.038 - 01:06:03.210, Speaker A: Right. It was like, kind of like, if you have an IP address coming from Iran, you can't access the official uniswap interface. Right. And so what did that mean at the time in 2019? Well, it actually does the opposite of everything the critics are proclaiming because it actually demonstrated how unstoppable the Uniswap protocol is. Because within minutes, this is what happened in 2019, and it's what happened in 2021. Last week, within minutes, all of these other new Uniswap interfaces surfaced. Right? So anyone can build a Uniswap interface.
01:06:03.210 - 01:06:28.882, Speaker A: They could just fork the Uniswap interface code as well and deploy it somewhere else they don't even have to deploy it on Amazon servers or centralized servers. You can even deploy it in something like ipfs. If you don't want a.com domain name, that's also kind of a centralized domain name. You can host it on Ens or some sort of decentralized domain name service. And so this is what you found in 2019. You had uniswapexchange eth.
01:06:28.882 - 01:07:05.682, Speaker A: You had uniswapexchange EtH link, totally uncensoral, accessible anywhere in the world. All the assets listed, it's because all of the good stuff, the logic, the liquidity, the assets, everything, that's all on chain, that's all uncensored, unstoppable on native Ethereum. And so the interface isn't even the thing here. And this is exactly what happened. You can access Uniswap and all of those synthetics that were delisted on the official app in any of these other third party websites. And anyone can spin these up. You can even run it yourself.
01:07:05.682 - 01:07:14.280, Speaker A: David, if you want to get super geeky, you can download the git code repositories and just run the interface on your local machine and trade that way.
01:07:14.650 - 01:07:48.094, Speaker B: And this is what it means to be an antifragile, decentralized system. If you cut off the head, then ten more show up. Like, I don't even go to uniswap to trade my assets. I go to matcha or any other number of uniswap front ends. And so if you just go somewhere else, it's just an interface, it's just the front end. And so, Ryan, I'm looking forward to doing this again in 2023 when something happens. And then the bitcoin maxis once again throw up their arms and be like, oh, yeah, we knew Ethereum was centralized.
01:07:48.094 - 01:07:49.358, Speaker B: Like, oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.
01:07:49.454 - 01:07:58.502, Speaker A: Here's the other thing. I don't know why people, what's your solution? If you're a bitcoiner, like, God bless you, what's your solution to this problem?
01:07:58.556 - 01:08:02.518, Speaker B: Right? You guys don't even have a uniswap, right?
01:08:02.684 - 01:08:03.762, Speaker A: Go to Coinbase.
01:08:03.826 - 01:08:04.054, Speaker B: Right?
01:08:04.092 - 01:08:09.798, Speaker A: I guess the solution is don't trade any other assets. There's only bitcoin. But that's not a satisfactory answer. That's not.
01:08:09.804 - 01:08:12.066, Speaker B: What if you're a bitcoiner? Bitcoin.
01:08:12.098 - 01:08:37.166, Speaker A: Massey. Excuse me. All right, let's talk about this. This is super exciting. I feel like this still went under the Radar even though it was big News last week. Is Reddit's Community Point System is scaling on Ethereum using Arbitrum. So Layer two Technology, and that's just huge because Reddit has been talking about a Community point scaling system, like tokenizing how Reddit has subreddits.
01:08:37.166 - 01:09:19.550, Speaker A: David, all sorts of different subreddits out there. Each subreddit can have a notion of community points that are rewarded for different behaviors in the Subreddit. And they created like a pilot Project of this and they just knew that Ethereum main net wouldn't scale. Anyway, they've finally come up with their scalability Solution for achieving this project, and it's on Arbitrum. And thing about Reddit is 450,000,000 active Monthly users. That's insane. I mean, we have probably 1 million, maybe 2 million people in DFI right now, right? This is potentially adding 450,000,000, like a total Dressable market when you include social media into the DFI ecosystem of the future.
01:09:19.550 - 01:10:00.698, Speaker A: And they're doing it on Ethereum's layer two. And the reason they selected layer two specifically for Ethereum is decentralization. That's what they said in their post. So this is the protocol sync thesis at work, right, where organizations don't want to build on finance chain that's controlled by CZ. They want to build on something that is credibly neutral at the base layer. And it's really cool that Reddit is seeing that. And I think this is going to be a big story of how Web two social media starts to interact more and more with Web three, DFI and this Internet of Value that's being built out right now.
01:10:00.784 - 01:10:27.446, Speaker B: Yeah, that last take that you just had, how Reddit is going from a Web two to a DFI world. This is Reddit getting a huge upgrade in stepping into the world of Web three. And there's a decent amount. Web three is kind of largely undefined. No one really knows what it is. Everyone has their own kind of definition for it. But I think as soon as you integrate financial assets with community engagement like hubs, which is what Reddit is, then we start to drift into the world of web3.
01:10:27.446 - 01:11:00.890, Speaker B: Incentivize communities, incentivize participation, incentivize content curation. And think of the magnitude of how many users Reddit has and how many they're all going to be introduced to Ethereum, maybe not directly. And kind of the point in the long term bullishness of Ethereum is that it actually just is an invisible operating system in the background that no one really thinks about anymore. And this is kind of disinstantiation of that. Reddit is going to use optimism. Optimism is so fast and instant that it just feels like a normal website. Yet it's secured by Ethereum.
01:11:00.890 - 01:11:22.198, Speaker B: And now Reddit's like millions and millions of users are now touching Ethereum, at least with maybe a couple degrees of separation. First, there's Reddit built on top of optimism, which is built on top of Ethereum, but it comes back. All roads lead back to Ethereum at the end of the day. And so Ethereum is about to touch so many more lives, and that's going to be really cool to see.
01:11:22.364 - 01:11:37.178, Speaker A: They're going to figure this out. David, there's like 30,000 different subreddits, right? What is a subreddit? It's a community, isn't it? Right? Like 30,000 subreddits. All of these could potentially become dows, right? If you have sort of some, if.
01:11:37.184 - 01:11:40.342, Speaker B: You expand the definition of a dow, it could just become a subreddit.
01:11:40.486 - 01:12:12.870, Speaker A: Who knows? I just have no idea what the experimentation is coming, but it is coming. And I think this is made possible by some of the layer two tech. Super cool to see. David, let's talk about EIP 15 five nine for just a minute, because this is like an embarrassing take by CNBC. I'm glad they're talking about ETH and EIP 15 five nine on CNBC, but they still don't really know what they're talking about. So this is Michael Wong with the tweet from Brian Kelly on CNBC. What happened here?
01:12:13.020 - 01:12:15.990, Speaker B: Yeah, let's just go ahead and play this video for the listener.
01:12:17.290 - 01:12:47.614, Speaker A: It's an upgrade. It's called EIP 1559 for those tech savvy folks that want to look at it. But basically what it does is it switches the algorithm from a proof of work to a proof of stake, so it uses less electricity to mine. But the more important thing is they're actually changing their monetary policy. So Ethereum actually could be a deflationary currency. And in terms of cryptocurrencies, deflationary in terms of cap supply is generally good. Yeah.
01:12:47.652 - 01:13:31.840, Speaker B: So Brian Kelly thinks EIP 1559 means proof of stake. I mean, I remember when I was trying to learn about crypto and Ethereum and I was making statements like this. And so to some degree, maybe Brian is just like learning. But also if you're learning, don't present this on, like, become a little bit more educated. And then also the Ethereum classic on the Ethereum classic graph on the screen while talking about Ethereum. It's frustrating to some degree, I'm just not convinced that our legacy media institutions are actually ever going to do it for us. And so there's always been the conversation of, when are the institutions coming? Versus, oh, are we just going to make our own new institutions? And this is evidence for the fact that, oh, we're just going to make our own new ones.
01:13:32.610 - 01:14:15.050, Speaker A: That's a great take, and I definitely think it's the second in all sorts of categories, not just media, but definitely media as well. David, let's talk about this. Bitco and index co op have partnered up, which is super cool. We just had index co op on the state of the nation earlier this week, and we're talking about institutional defi now. They have teamed up with BICO. It seems like BICO provides crypto custody service, because a lot of these institutions, David, they can't hold their own private keys in an institutional structure, right? So they can't have millions and millions of dollars on metamask or, like, somebody's ledger or something like that. So they have to use custodians like Bitgo.
01:14:15.050 - 01:14:45.458, Speaker A: And now I think what's happening is Bitgo is providing access to all the index co op products. So that's the bed index. That's DPI, that's their metaverse investment product, that's ETH, FLI, it's all of their products. Exposing that to institutions, that's a super big move, because, of course, there's a lot of money flowing out there in retail, but there's even more on the institutional side. And giving them access to these defi products is kind of neat.
01:14:45.634 - 01:14:57.980, Speaker B: Yeah. Especially with the bed index, which is really meant to be a buy and hold. Having that go straight into, like, custody cold storage. Really, really useful. Institutions buy the bed, get into bed with that.
01:14:58.430 - 01:15:00.502, Speaker A: You think we have institutions listening?
01:15:00.646 - 01:15:04.942, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Well, members of institutions, absolutely.
01:15:05.076 - 01:15:34.082, Speaker A: All right. Nft stuff, David. Shopify is allowing merchants to sell nfts directly through their store. They are using the flow blockchain to do that, to sell nfts directly to customers. So we have a Shopify store. Right? And this is where you could sell merch, this sort of thing. You spin up a Shopify store, and I guess now they've just integrated an extension to allow flow nfts to be sold on top of Shopify.
01:15:34.082 - 01:15:38.038, Speaker A: This is mainstreaming nfts. What other takes are there here?
01:15:38.204 - 01:16:18.280, Speaker B: Yeah, flow nfts are not actually nfts. They're fraudulent, illegitimate nfts, because flow isn't actually a crypto economic system. It's a centralized database. But it's a foot in the door for nfts to become integrated to the rest of the world. Shopify owes no homage to flow, and as soon as it wakes up and realizes that nfts on flow are illegitimate, then maybe they will wake up and maybe they just need the scale. And so maybe we should introduce them to immutable, because immutable is a starkware l two that is specific built for nfts. And so if they need nfts on a scale platform, they should be talking to the guys over at immutable x, not the guys over.
01:16:18.970 - 01:16:25.074, Speaker A: I want to hear what you said, though. This is strong language. Think nfts on flow are, you'd say, illegitimate?
01:16:25.122 - 01:16:25.334, Speaker B: Yes.
01:16:25.372 - 01:16:26.182, Speaker A: What do you mean by that?
01:16:26.236 - 01:17:31.338, Speaker B: So, nfts and tokens and the whole concept of the metaverse is defined by user ownership, which means that any NFT that is not deployed on a decentralized, permissionless blockchain is not an NFT. It is something else that they have sold to you as this scarce asset that they're never going to reproduce. But do you actually own it? If they can either shut down the blockchain or censor your ability to touch it and just overall dictate control over what assets that you own. It's kind of like if you were to go into a game like Fortnite or any other game, Hearthstone, and you purchase items in the game, but then they can just revoke your account or cut you off or revoke your items. Are they really nfts? No, nfts are synonymous with maximal settlement. Assurances about ownership over the asset and flow does not give you that in the same way that any centralized database, anything new.
01:17:31.504 - 01:17:39.440, Speaker A: David, what about nfts on a side chain, something like XDI or even something like polygon, right? Are they nfts or are they not?
01:17:44.530 - 01:18:15.606, Speaker B: They can become tokens on Ethereum, right? So if you have a token on XDI or on Polygon, it is a token also on Ethereum. And so you can make that trust assumption as the user to put your tokens on Polygon. And that's your choice. You are taking that choice. So even if you go and you mint that token on polygon, you have the ability to go back to Ethereum, and then you always get your maximum settlement assurances. Flow is a completely different blockchain. You can't go from flow to ethereum, so you can never access the maximum security of Ethereum.
01:18:15.798 - 01:19:09.574, Speaker A: So what I think the flow people would say is they are a layer one blockchain. And they have some trade offs with Ethereum on the decentralization spectrum, and they're not as decentralized as Ethereum, but they would say this may be a case they would make or somebody would make, but you don't have to be maximally decentralized for nfts, for instance. The use case doesn't require that. Or maybe you might say flow is a property rights system, but it doesn't provide as strong security guarantees as something like Ethereum. But it does provide some security guarantees that are not quite fortnite level centralization database. Like, there's a spectrum there. And maybe they're not all the way left to Ethereum, but they're also not all the way right to Fortnite.
01:19:09.574 - 01:19:16.398, Speaker A: They're kind of somewhere in between. Don't know how far in between, but somewhere in between. What's your take on that?
01:19:16.484 - 01:19:53.510, Speaker B: Yeah, the place, that spectrum that you're talking about, the place where it should be expressed, is at the layer twos of Ethereum. If you want to compromise on decentralization, you go to an l two, where you actually don't have to compromise on it. That's the whole point of the l two. So optimism and arbitrum, they have speed and low latency because of the innovations in optimistic roll ups or Zk roll ups, if you're talking about Zk sync. And so I know, denied because we have better solutions as l two s on Ethereum, where you don't have to make those compromises.
01:19:53.670 - 01:20:39.954, Speaker A: How about, let's say there's a bridge from flow to Ethereum, right? So there's a bridge from flow to Ethereum. And so flow just becomes like the l two, if you will. Not an l two, sorry. Like a side chain with that bridge, that connection back to Ethereum. So they get people in the NFT world, they get them excited about, it's not maybe a pure real NFT, but then it has the ability to bridge across to something like Ethereum. What's your take? It's like, I'll separate something because I think part of what you'reacting to is some marketing around flow and quite frankly, other layer ones that says we're just as decentralized as Ethereum. And you have the exact same assurances, trust assurances, settlement guarantees as Ethereum.
01:20:39.954 - 01:21:05.214, Speaker A: And that's a lie. And I think partially what you'reacting to is that I just see a world where this brings in a whole bunch of new users into the ecosystem, and it's kind of like you have to start with Gemini and Coinbase first. Before you get into defi, maybe you start with flow first. Maybe flow is just actually a side chain to something like Ethereum. Thoughts on that?
01:21:05.332 - 01:21:54.458, Speaker B: It's important as to where the token lives. Where does the NfT live? So if you have an NFT on flow, and you can bridge it over to Ethereum, if that NfT still lives on flow, then you still have compromised trust assurances. If once you get that NFT over to Ethereum, and then that token then lives on Ethereum, then we're good. Then it's an NFT, because then you have the assurances that Ethereum, it's all about assurances. It's all about user sovereignty. And if an NFT on flow, if flow accidentally had a hiccup in the blockchain, or they just went away because of regulation, do you still have your asset? And in my mind, if it's on flow, the answer is no. And if you move that token from flow to Ethereum, but all the data still lives on flow, right? Where Ethereum is checking flow as to whether the NFT exists or not, then it's still compromised.
01:21:54.458 - 01:22:17.510, Speaker B: Ethereum needs to check Ethereum to see whether that NfT is real or not. And so it's a matter of where does that NfT live? And in order to be a legitimate NFT, it has to live on whatever is maximally decentralized, maximally censorship resistant, maximally permissionless, and whatever is the most maximal is the most legitimate place to issue nfts. And that place is Ethereum.
01:22:18.010 - 01:22:20.326, Speaker A: There you go, guys. I didn't know we were going to have that conversation.
01:22:20.358 - 01:22:21.718, Speaker B: There was a full episode.
01:22:21.814 - 01:22:48.066, Speaker A: We did mini episode within a roll up. All right, David, let's talk about this. This is still an NFT world. Stoner cats. Mila Kunis, she has a new animated NFT show, cats again, shutting down the Ethereum blockchain. I don't was I was actually trying to mint one of these just because I thought it'd be fun and I couldn't get my transaction through. I didn't make it because there was such high demand for this.
01:22:48.066 - 01:22:53.218, Speaker A: I think there are a lot of reasons for this, but tell us about the story and what happened earlier this week.
01:22:53.304 - 01:23:17.126, Speaker B: Yeah. Mila Kunis, Ashen Kutcher, Vitalik Buterin, and a few other big names out of the Hollywood space. All they produce, like these animated short videos. And if you want to watch these, you have to own a stoner cat. And Stoner cat, I think there's like 13,000 of them or something. Generative cats. Pretty typical NFT project, except for the fact that it's backed by these big, big name celebrities.
01:23:17.126 - 01:23:48.146, Speaker B: Two people out of that was one of my favorite shows. And gas spiked to like 600 Gwe because everyone was aping in all at the same time. The sale was delayed by 24 hours because they had a bug in getting the sale contract out the door. So they delayed it by 24 hours. And then because everyone was aping in at all at the same time, there was so many failed transactions. So there was something like, I think like over $100,000 in cumulative burnt.
01:23:48.258 - 01:23:56.600, Speaker A: I saw a report where it was like $750,000 David, of 750 failed transactions. Yeah, 750k.
01:23:57.530 - 01:24:18.958, Speaker B: That's a large number of literally burnt money that went straight to the miners. So the miners are really happy. That kind of makes me concerned about the genesis of this NFT event because it had a bug for one day, so they kicked the sale out of day, and then a lot of people got burnt trying to buy these things. So, like, not really starting off with a good impression, but, I mean, we'll see.
01:24:19.044 - 01:24:21.422, Speaker A: We now have insane demand, though, right?
01:24:21.556 - 01:24:22.286, Speaker B: Sorry.
01:24:22.468 - 01:24:26.786, Speaker A: Like, insane demand. Insane. That's a story in itself.
01:24:26.968 - 01:24:37.010, Speaker B: That was one of two NFT drops that had insane demand. They were not even covering the second one. But that day there were two events, two NFT drops that spiked gas like 600 Gwe.
01:24:37.350 - 01:24:44.118, Speaker A: I was just like, can we start doing NFT launches on layer two, please? When could we start doing that? Right? Let's just do that, right?
01:24:44.204 - 01:24:46.920, Speaker B: Listen to bankless. Come on, Mila. Listen to bank list.
01:24:47.850 - 01:25:03.238, Speaker A: Come on, bankless. We'd love to talk to you, Mila. Coca Cola creates its first collection of brand inspired nfts. Coca Cola, like that is an american classic brand. That's a Warren Buffett stock. Now they're doing nfts. Probably not Buffett approved.
01:25:03.334 - 01:25:04.154, Speaker B: Probably not.
01:25:04.272 - 01:25:06.762, Speaker A: What's the big deal about this? Is it just Coca Cola?
01:25:06.826 - 01:25:23.474, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just Coca Cola. Coca Cola is now making nfts on Ethereum, picking the right blockchain. So that's. I mean, when Coca Cola, like one of America's biggest brands ever, issues nfts, it's really legitimizing of the infrastructure. So cool. We just got a little bit more legitimate today, guys.
01:25:23.672 - 01:25:48.774, Speaker A: Also, the auction is donated to the Special Olympics International. So kind of cool that they're doing that as well. David, people pleaser, man. You remember you had people pleaser on the podcast, wrote an article about her uniswap art. Now her digital art is on the front page of Fortune magazine. This is the digital version. And it's really bringing crypto culture, I think, into mainstream acceptance.
01:25:48.774 - 01:25:51.766, Speaker A: I see crypto punk. I see some other things. Unicorns and such.
01:25:51.808 - 01:26:08.834, Speaker B: Oh, hang on. That's not just a normal crypto punk. That's Santiago Santos. That's his crypto punk. We also got the banteg bunny right here. We got crypto dog as well. I think that's loomdart that you can't see with the pepe with the orange cap.
01:26:08.834 - 01:26:18.946, Speaker B: We got tetronode on the DJ station. We got the Kobe bitcoin glasses. And there's going to be a few other people. Maybe that's chain link God. Maybe. Is that who that is?
01:26:18.968 - 01:26:19.982, Speaker A: It's a green frog.
01:26:20.126 - 01:26:36.902, Speaker B: I know that. Then we got the people pleaser stars on the wall. Yeah, there's just a bunch of little Easter eggs here. Oh, look, there's the fractional logo from even earlier in the show. There's a ledger right there. Compound logo, because shout out Robert Leshner. So, yeah, there's a bunch of little hidden gems.
01:26:36.902 - 01:26:45.610, Speaker B: And so we have actual crypto, Twitter, cryptoculture people on the front page of Fortune magazine. So nice job and congrats to people pleaser.
01:26:45.770 - 01:27:06.190, Speaker A: That's super cool, guys. Not too much bitcoin stuff, but I think all of the bitcoin information is probably tied up in the regulatory discussion that we want to have. There's a lot of regulatory discussion in Washington this week. So let's start with this Elizabeth Warren. She called crypto coders shadowy supercoders.
01:27:06.270 - 01:27:11.078, Speaker B: Shadowy supercoders. You would think of us, like, just.
01:27:11.164 - 01:27:25.558, Speaker A: I was like, why do you have to make it sound so cool? Elizabeth Warren. You're just going to get more people to do it. Shadowy supercoders. So did you see some crypto companies, David, they started, like, changing their job post descriptions to shadowy Supercoder.
01:27:25.654 - 01:27:30.358, Speaker B: No, this is perfect cryptoculture. Just taking lemons and turning it into lemonade.
01:27:30.534 - 01:27:50.850, Speaker A: Can I read her quote here? I'm going to read her quote. Instead of leaving our financial system at the whims of giant banks, crypto puts the system at the whims of some shadowy, faceless group of supercoders and miners, which doesn't sound better to me. She's making the case against crypto in this hearing. A lot of that this week.
01:27:50.920 - 01:27:54.222, Speaker B: And then all of crypto, Twitter turned it into one gigantic meme.
01:27:54.366 - 01:28:18.790, Speaker A: Yeah, she also sent this letter to Janet Yellen. So treasury secretary. And I won't read the whole letter. Obviously it will be available for you in the show notes, but I wanted to highlight this risks from decentralized finance. She also tweeted this letter out and she called it defi refers to a fast growing and highly opaque corner of the cryptocurrency.
01:28:18.870 - 01:28:21.942, Speaker B: If I had my soundboard, I'd be hitting the buzzer right now, sir.
01:28:22.016 - 01:28:48.758, Speaker A: Highly opaque. This whole thing is called open finance. The traditional banking system is highly opaque. That's why we have open finance. That's why we are building a new system. She says given the participants in project developers may remain anonymous, Defi could present severe financial stability risks. So making the case that crypto could destabilize the traditional financial markets and wreck everything.
01:28:48.758 - 01:29:21.886, Speaker A: I'm just kind of like, who's asking for this? I don't understand if this is a narrative that some politicians are grabbing on and anti crypto. I don't know. There must be some contingent of the population just likes it, just likes hearing about this because it's not actually going to deliver any results for the things the american people care about. To be anti crypto in this way. I do not understand it. And it's also coming from a very misinformed view. Right? I mean, we just had index co op on.
01:29:21.886 - 01:29:40.722, Speaker A: They have their entire financial statement. Everything they do, it's on chain visible, live update, transparent. This is not opaque. Live updating like a ten k every 6 seconds. You get a ten k report. You could query it from anywhere. This is a regulator's dream.
01:29:40.722 - 01:29:55.500, Speaker A: I don't understand. They should want to build the entire american financial system on open finance. They have access to see everything. And individual investors have access to see everything. I don't understand, David, what's going on?
01:29:55.870 - 01:30:29.726, Speaker B: It's just so easy to just refute all of this. And if you scroll up just a little bit so I can see the rest of that paragraph, it just shows Elizabeth Warren's cards, right? An opaque financial market which leads to stability risks. We have the most volatile crypto assets of all time and everything works regardless of that. We are built for stability. It's the whole point of over collateralization. We are built for transparency. And so this is how you know that.
01:30:29.726 - 01:31:12.638, Speaker B: Elizabeth Warren doesn't give a flying f about what is true about this industry, but she's trying to paint it into an image. She's trying to give it a branding which it does not have and is completely and fundamentally the opposite of what is actually true. And all of my family loves Liv Warren. I didn't vote for her I was a Bernie bro, and then I was a yang guy, but she would have been third, except every time she opens her mouth about a crypto, it's just dead wrong. And so I finally feel resonance with these ultra libertarians who just get frustrated about politicians coming into their industry, tinkering around about shit they don't know about, like, get out of my industry. You don't know. I know more than you, Elizabeth Warren.
01:31:12.638 - 01:31:16.820, Speaker B: I know more than you. Get out. Stop. Sorry.
01:31:17.270 - 01:32:02.290, Speaker A: We have some more takes on that, by the way, because I think regulatory is definitely, like, there's a lot of fud over the past few weeks about this. So some more takes in the takes section. But before we get there, some other news for the week. The White House says crypto tax enforcement will help pay for this new massive bipartisan infrastructure bill. David, the biggest infrastructure bill in, I mean, the, the biggest ever that's been proposed in the world. There's a lot of support for this in Congress, and crypto tax enforcement could pay for a portion of it. But unfortunately, do you know what this means? It means they are potentially slipping in some reporting obligations into this infrastructure tax bill.
01:32:02.290 - 01:32:40.766, Speaker A: So reporting obligations above and beyond what we have today. So if you sell crypto in the US, of course, that is a capital gain. And you have to treat that as you would any know, stock, bond, real estate, whatever it may be. Right? They want to go above and beyond this. And potentially the wording of the legislation right now. Again, this is not passed. This is like draft legislation still is that even wallets, David, might have to report out the tax obligations of wallet users, potentially even maybe DeFi exchanges would need to report this stuff out.
01:32:40.766 - 01:32:43.770, Speaker A: Some of this is the way it's worded. It's not even practical.
01:32:43.850 - 01:32:45.470, Speaker B: It's not nonsensical.
01:32:45.630 - 01:33:06.978, Speaker A: It's nonsensical. No one can do it. But there's definitely a target to pay for this infrastructure build. And they think they could raise $28 billion from the crypto industry with some of this. It's not even the taxes that are so much the issue. It's the nonsensical reporting, the methodology. Nonsensical reporting obligations.
01:33:06.978 - 01:33:11.318, Speaker A: I thought Anthony had a good take here. Explain this meme.
01:33:11.494 - 01:33:22.300, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. So it's the classic Scooby doo who's under the mask meme. And so first panel we have, I don't know who this guy's name is, but the blonde guy.
01:33:23.070 - 01:33:23.894, Speaker A: Oh, no.
01:33:24.032 - 01:33:36.094, Speaker B: Yeah, the preppy blonde guy. He's about to rip the mask off, and before he does it's, labeled infrastructure bill, and then he rips the mask off and under it is insane. Crypto regulations implying that's how it's going to get paid for it.
01:33:36.132 - 01:33:37.306, Speaker A: That's not what we wanted.
01:33:37.428 - 01:34:04.374, Speaker B: Regulators. Elizabeth Warren, I know you're listening to this podcast. If you want to tax this industry and actually want to get the money out of it, you have to do it in ways that make sense. Otherwise, you're actually going to get even less taxes because you're just going to piss people off about how you can't. The way that you are asking them to report and be taxed is nonsensical. And so you're going to incentivize people to avoid doing the things you want them to do. You've got to make it easy for people to pay their taxes.
01:34:04.374 - 01:34:05.962, Speaker B: You got to do it the right way.
01:34:06.096 - 01:34:18.254, Speaker A: Totally agree. Totally agree. Thank God we have some people in Washington, like coin center, who are pushing back in this. So the coin center is like, I'd call them just a crypto lobby group. And this is how we all like them.
01:34:18.292 - 01:34:20.240, Speaker B: Everyone likes them. We're friends with each other.
01:34:20.610 - 01:34:57.130, Speaker A: This is how the billmaking process works in Washington. It's basically like there'll be a section that pertains to a certain industry, and the industry will get that section, and they'll essentially advise legislators on how to change things, how to edit it, how to make it more, I guess, palatable for the industry. Right. This is what lobbying really is. And so coin center is up in the mix, and they are trying to make sure that nonsensical crypto tax regulations don't get embedded in the bowels of this bill, because this is an infrastructure bill. Okay. You could either support that or not.
01:34:57.130 - 01:35:25.454, Speaker A: But it's an infrastructure bill. It does not have anything to do with reporting requirements for crypto, or it shouldn't, and it certainly shouldn't create nonsensical obligations. So we have folks like Jerry Britto from coin center pushing back on this, and thank God we do. All right, David, we're going to burn through the rest of these really quick. The first is the finance squeeze is ongoing. So FTX and finance just removed their highest leverage ability. They used to have like, 100 x leverage.
01:35:25.454 - 01:35:47.050, Speaker A: You could get on these exchanges to a maximum of 20 x. Feels very much like they are trying to get on the good side of regulators with this move. Finance is also decreasing the daily withdrawal limits. So, used to be KyC? Yeah, you could withdraw two bitcoin, up to two bitcoin. Now it's like 0.6 bitcoin per day.
01:35:47.120 - 01:36:01.310, Speaker B: And they didn't even give a two week notice, which they usually did, which, you know, is how, you know, regulators are constricting on them. And to me, this means finance is largely dead. That's kind of why finance was used in the first place, as an anti exchange.
01:36:01.650 - 01:36:04.318, Speaker A: Yes. And they're definitely a bank now, right?
01:36:04.404 - 01:36:09.698, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, 100% head in that direction. End of an era, definitely.
01:36:09.864 - 01:36:38.714, Speaker A: Binance, us IPO. This also seems to be like another defensive posture. Binance is shrinking their non KYC withdrawal limits, as we mentioned, and maybe it's because they want to ipo in the US, which would be interesting. Also this, David, in China, there's a regulatory squeeze. Huobi, which was the largest chinese exchange, as far as I know, they just dissolved all their chinese entities. So they're no longer a chinese company. I don't know where they're going.
01:36:38.714 - 01:36:48.522, Speaker A: But this is as a result of the chinese regulatory squeeze. So again, that theme back again. Do you want to talk about this? What's Robinhood doing? David?
01:36:48.586 - 01:37:05.522, Speaker B: Robinhood is trying to get into maybe DeFi, like all the DeFi products and services that we know, borrowing, lending and swapping. Robinhood is trying to get into that. Not too many details, but they said they are eyeing crypto lending and staking services. So. Cool. Ahead of its ipo as well.
01:37:05.656 - 01:37:31.594, Speaker A: Yeah, ahead of their ipo. I think they expect this to be a revenue generator for them. Speaking of ipos, blockfi is also pursuing plans to go public even as regulators close in. So we mentioned that last week, regulators kind of closing in New Jersey called blockfi interest accounts, a security. Now they're planning to go to IPO, maybe in a defensive posture in some way. I'm not sure exactly why. Let's talk about this last one, David.
01:37:31.594 - 01:37:37.646, Speaker A: Goldman Sachs, they just applied for a DeFi ETF. Goldman Sachs, they're getting into DFI. Good news.
01:37:37.748 - 01:37:49.150, Speaker B: Yeah. Let's find out what's in it. Oh, wait, absolutely nothing. There's zero crypto tokens in this DFI ETF. And so fail. Big fail.
01:37:49.310 - 01:37:55.598, Speaker A: What is in it? I heard that the largest asset, like 7% of the ETF was actually Nokia.
01:37:55.774 - 01:38:28.046, Speaker B: Followed by Facebook and then Google. It's basically they tasked some intern with finding any traditional equities company that has any sort of surface area to crypto and blockchain and Ethereum. And the intern did it, and he still effed it up. And then now Goldman Sachs is marketing this defi product. In the same week, that index co op and bankless Dow launches the bet index, in my opinion, going to be the best performing crypto index of all time. Goldman Sachs just completely flops with this Defi ETF. Who do you think is going to build out the future?
01:38:28.228 - 01:38:38.274, Speaker A: To be fair, one thing I will say is they're actually using this Defi index right here from a company called Sol Active, I suppose. And these are the companies we mentioned.
01:38:38.312 - 01:38:40.498, Speaker B: They could change who it's from. They fucked up.
01:38:40.584 - 01:38:58.886, Speaker A: They'll maybe change it, they'll maybe change it, though they might not go to market with this. They made it somewhat vague in their SEC filing, so I will say that. But yeah, absolutely embarrassing if they go to market with that. Guys, we're going to be back with the takes of the week. And don't forget the meme of the week right after our sponsors when you.
01:38:58.908 - 01:39:12.898, Speaker C: Shop for plane tickets, you probably use kayak, Expedia or Google to compare ticket prices. So why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto? When you make your trades, you want to make sure that you are getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas.
01:39:12.934 - 01:39:14.490, Speaker B: Costs that you could have otherwise avoided.
01:39:14.570 - 01:39:54.678, Speaker C: That's why you should be using matcha. Matcha routes your orders across all the various Defi exchanges on Ethereum, polygon, binance, smart chain, and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commission. Matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources. If matcha sees that, it gets you better pricing. Trading on Matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me into a single easy to use platform and that has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and accidentally getting a bad price. Matcha also allows you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defi trades and they will go through automatically while you're away. New to matcha is an integrated fiat onramp.
01:39:54.678 - 01:40:30.150, Speaker C: You can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity. When you're making a trade, head over to matcha XYZ slash bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity. When you trade your crypto assets. Arbitrum is an Ethereum scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use DFi. If you've been using Ethereum for the past twelve months, you've probably noticed the high gas fees and the slow confirmation times that have been plaguing DFI. Too many people want to use Ethereum, and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us. That's where arbitrum comes in.
01:40:30.150 - 01:41:15.406, Speaker C: Arbitrum is a layer two to Ethereum, which means arbitrum can increase Ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying. When interacting with arbitrum, you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into Ethereum's level of security and decentralization. This is why people are calling this Ethereum's broadband moment, where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security. If you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and make an overall better experience for your users, go to developer offchainlabs.com to get started. Building on arbitrum if you're a user, keep an eye out for your favorite DFI apps. Building on Arbitrum Arbitrum has been working with over 300 teams, including Ethereum's top infrastructure projects, and will be opening up to all users shortly.
01:41:15.406 - 01:41:28.710, Speaker C: There are so many apps coming online to Arbitrum, so you may want to pack your bags in preparation for the great migration to the arbitrum layer two to keep up to speed with Arbitrum, follow them on Twitter at arbitram and join their discord.
01:41:29.450 - 01:41:45.214, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back with some of the hot takes of the week. David, let's start here. This was from a comment Mark Zuckerberg made. Facebook, he says, is becoming a metaverse company. That's interesting in and of itself. But what's this take from? Claire Silver? Yeah.
01:41:45.252 - 01:42:14.850, Speaker B: In 2014, Facebook acquires Oculus VR. In 2020, Facebook released a beta for Facebook Horizon, a world creation system for Oculus. And in 2021, Facebook says they are transitioning into a metaverse company. Now, the word metaverse, I think, is it depends on who you ask. They'll define it differently. I think metaverse in this context is being more closely associated with ready player one type of a world. But that very world is very much synonymous with owning assets and digital assets.
01:42:14.850 - 01:42:31.310, Speaker B: And so it's very proximate to a lot of the NFT conversations that we have in this industry. And so there's a take here, it's like, how do we want our metaverse to be constructed? Do we want it constructed on open source, permissionless software, or do we want it constructed by Mark Zuckerberg?
01:42:32.130 - 01:43:15.798, Speaker A: Well, I know you've seen ready player one, right? There are all of these tokens, money, collectibles in ready player one items, all of these things. And so they have to be registered somewhere because they're digital property with real value. And so you only have, like, I guess maybe three places that you could register. This one with some sort of a digital version of a nation state or two, it's the property of the companies like Facebook. Is the property management system essentially the property registry or it's a credibly neutral, permissionless system. Right. I don't think the nation state is going to come up with a digital property rights system on the Internet.
01:43:15.798 - 01:43:46.398, Speaker A: Facebook certainly would and can. But do we want them to? My God, Zuckerberg already knows everything about, like, do we want him holding the keys to all of the assets? All the digital assets, the world that dystopic? It does. I think those are the choices, though. Good take. All right, let's go to this one. Defi regulation. This is from Rune Christensen on the topic we were just talking about earlier this week in the news section.
01:43:46.398 - 01:43:48.134, Speaker A: Why don't you take this, David? Yeah.
01:43:48.172 - 01:44:01.334, Speaker B: He says if the US bans or seriously interferes with the innovation happening in DeFi, it will be an own goal. Ten times worse than China cracking down on Didi, which paralyzed innovation. Do you know what Didi is?
01:44:01.452 - 01:44:02.614, Speaker A: I don't, actually.
01:44:02.812 - 01:44:36.982, Speaker B: Okay. Room continues. DeFi today is the most rapidly innovating sector in tech, and most of that innovation is US centric. What Roon is basically saying is that DeFi is like the last bastion of permissionless innovation for the US financial system. In stark contrast with what's going on with the chinese bank digital currency. I'm going to write an article about this because my brain's been chewing on it, but there's a conversation to be had about how many just light years ahead. The chinese CBDC is ahead of anything the US is doing, or even understands itself to be doing.
01:44:36.982 - 01:44:46.738, Speaker B: While China marches ahead with this super innovative new product, and so is DeFi, the United States is just floundering status quo.
01:44:46.754 - 01:44:47.800, Speaker A: It's doing nothing.
01:44:48.410 - 01:45:08.206, Speaker B: It's not even doing nothing. It's going backwards, like hindering its biggest ally. And that is why rune is calling this bad innovation or bad regulation around Defi could be the United States own goal. They need DeFi to combat the chinese bank's digital currency, yet they are trying to tax it in these weird, nonsensical ways.
01:45:08.388 - 01:45:44.730, Speaker A: It's absolutely insane. And I couldn't agree more with this take, David. And you absolutely should write that article because it maddens me. The US has a real shot here and free open permissionless systems have a real shot here to pull ahead and like roots, right? A lot of this has been built in the US. There's a hotbed for Defi innovation. And if the US regulators and those in government start to strangle like choke out this industry, what are they doing? Squandered opportunity, missed opportunity, just completely know. Basically our generation, future generations.
01:45:44.730 - 01:46:02.960, Speaker A: So I totally agree, David. Crypto economies are booming right now. Crypto gaming economies, I should say. And this is a take from token terminal that only crypto enables in game economies. So revenue for Axie Infinity was 1.2 billion. That's annualized for the last 30 days.
01:46:02.960 - 01:46:21.266, Speaker A: Remember candy crush, 1.2 billion. That was first realized in 2020. So the users for AXi are 600,000 users. For candy crushed are 237,000,000. Revenue per user. For Axi is 2000 per user.
01:46:21.266 - 01:46:25.046, Speaker A: Revenue per user. For candy crush, $4.4.
01:46:25.148 - 01:46:30.774, Speaker B: You know where the difference in those numbers comes from is because the axe users gets that revenue.
01:46:30.822 - 01:46:34.246, Speaker A: Where the revenue GDP economies have GDP.
01:46:34.358 - 01:46:38.250, Speaker B: Exactly right. Where a candy crush, that just goes to the corporate holdings.
01:46:38.750 - 01:47:03.246, Speaker A: Yeah, it's super cool. I can't wait to see what's going to happen in crypto gaming in the future. David, this is take from Anthony Sasano. ETH is digital oil. And then he listed table with the market cap of all of these commodities. The bottom line is if ETH price were the same market cap of oil, ETH price would be $932,000, which is quite impressive.
01:47:03.438 - 01:47:26.010, Speaker B: I just overall enjoy the comparison of ether to other commodities. One of three ways to value Ether is as of a commodity. And even that's only one of three ways. It's still so incredibly undervalued compared to other commodities, at least in Ethereum's current form. We got a long way to go before ether starts to get up there with the rest of the commodities.
01:47:26.430 - 01:47:46.442, Speaker A: Yeah, I like that take, and I don't want to take it too seriously because that's probably just the take is what you said. But I also think that ether is more the money and block space. Ethereum block space is more the commodity. So I get the analogy. But also EtH is not oil. ETH is money. Ethereum block space is oil.
01:47:46.506 - 01:47:50.034, Speaker B: But the value of block space is instantiated in ether, though.
01:47:50.152 - 01:47:53.506, Speaker A: All right, David, it's that time, man. What are you excited about this week?
01:47:53.608 - 01:48:18.246, Speaker B: Hey, I'm like trying to make lemons out of lemonade. I guess I've said that three times in the show, but like, hey, I got coronavirus but I got the coronavirus after I got the vaccine. And so once I come out of this, and once I come out of quarantine, I'm going to have the vaccine and the antibodies. I'm basically going to be Superman. And so once I'm done, once with my quarantine time, I'm going to be stoked to travel the world to the real life and travel the world even more protected.
01:48:18.438 - 01:48:19.370, Speaker A: There you go. Yeah.
01:48:19.440 - 01:48:26.926, Speaker B: Specifically in that order is the right order to do things. First the vaccine and then getting the antibodies. I don't recommend the alternative order.
01:48:27.108 - 01:48:30.398, Speaker A: I'm just glad you're feeling okay. Yeah. They could have been brutal. Yeah.
01:48:30.484 - 01:48:31.822, Speaker B: Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:48:31.956 - 01:48:34.318, Speaker A: I'm excited about EIP 15 five nine.
01:48:34.404 - 01:48:34.826, Speaker B: Shocker.
01:48:34.858 - 01:48:53.698, Speaker A: Look, we are a week away. Look, by the time people are listening to this, we'll be like six days away from EIP 15 five nine. Maybe five days away from EIP 15 five nine. And it's finally happening. So we are burning ETH. We are entering the ultrasound money era. This is the first part of that era where we start to burn eth.
01:48:53.698 - 01:49:27.358, Speaker A: The one thing I've thought was missing from Ethereum this entire time was not like the community, not like the product market fit. We've had all of those things. It's been monetary policy, issuance policy of Ethereum. What does the issuance policy look like in the future? That is the one thing, in my opinion, David, that has prevented Ethereum and ETH asset from gaining Mindshare as a store of value. Popular mindshare as a store of value. Well, now that's getting fixed, now it's getting changed. We're going to have a monetary policy that creates ultrasound money out of ETH, the asset.
01:49:27.358 - 01:49:42.482, Speaker A: And the first step of that is EIP 15 five nine. So look, ultrasound summer. It's kicking off this summer. Then we get the merge, which drops proof of work, issuance. We get an issuance reduction of like 4%. And it's all coming together, but it's finally happening. That's why I'm excited.
01:49:42.482 - 01:50:00.522, Speaker A: EIP 15, five nine is the biggest ethereum event, certainly since staking and the beacon chain launched, but it's different than that. I'm not going to say it's bigger than that, but it is almost as important, maybe just as important as that, I would say, yeah.
01:50:00.576 - 01:50:10.430, Speaker B: And to rally off of that, I'm also excited for all the cool numbers and metrics and just data we get to look at due to EIP 1559.
01:50:10.500 - 01:50:11.150, Speaker A: Burn data.
01:50:11.220 - 01:50:33.414, Speaker B: Yeah, burn data. Yeah. I wrote about this forever ago, the last final puzzle piece to Ethereum's monetary policy. Not only do we get eth burn rate, we get the eth burn to issue ratio. Just so many new metrics unlock for us to be able to talk about and digest. And the more things like that, the more real it becomes. And so that's what I'm excited about.
01:50:33.414 - 01:50:35.414, Speaker B: About what you're excited about.
01:50:35.612 - 01:50:40.890, Speaker A: All right, man, I know we're both excited about that. All right, let's talk about this meme of the week. Meme of the week.
01:50:40.960 - 01:50:48.010, Speaker B: David, I actually don't know the movie this came out of chief culturist Hillary Duff. Well, yeah, but what's the movie?
01:50:48.750 - 01:50:50.906, Speaker A: I don't know where she's a twin, I think.
01:50:50.928 - 01:51:17.182, Speaker B: I don't know. The chief culturist, Michael Wong over at bankless, he understands things way beyond even we do at sometimes. But this is Hilary Duff holding hands with, I think, who is also Hillary Duff. And it's Ethereum holding hands with Ethiopia. Because Ethereum is an inclusive community and if we get branded with Ethiopia as Ethiopia, we're going to run with it. So Ethereum, best friends with Ethiopia, handshake Ethiopia.
01:51:17.246 - 01:51:26.258, Speaker A: Awesome. Guys. Of course, none of this has been financial advice. Crypto is risky. Defi and ETH are risky as well. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west.
01:51:26.258 - 01:51:30.942, Speaker A: This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But thanks for joining us on the bankless journey.
