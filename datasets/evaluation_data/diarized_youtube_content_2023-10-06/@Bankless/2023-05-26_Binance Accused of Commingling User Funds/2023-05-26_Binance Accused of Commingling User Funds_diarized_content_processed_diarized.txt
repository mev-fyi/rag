00:00:00.170 - 00:00:13.950, Speaker A: Binance accused of commingling customer funds. I'm sure CZ would call this FUD bankless nation. It is the fourth Friday of May. The last Friday of May. David, what time is it?
00:00:14.020 - 00:00:26.438, Speaker B: It's the bankless Friday weekly roll up where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is actually not that ambitious this week. I would actually call this a slow week, which really I don't think I've ever said that week. Slow weekend news.
00:00:26.524 - 00:00:29.346, Speaker A: Yeah, that's why we have some weird takes in the take section.
00:00:29.378 - 00:00:31.282, Speaker B: Yeah, that's why the take kind of weird.
00:00:31.346 - 00:00:39.638, Speaker A: Yeah, just a sleepy market, maybe. I mean, we called this the Boar Market before. Is that what we're in for more? The Boar Market?
00:00:39.724 - 00:00:40.022, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:40.076 - 00:00:41.586, Speaker A: It's going to be a boring roll up, David.
00:00:41.618 - 00:00:49.100, Speaker B: Is that what you're going to be? A boring no, it's going to be extremely exciting. Stay tuned for every single second of it and don't go away.
00:00:49.550 - 00:00:58.894, Speaker A: Let's talk about the topics of the week. So, continuation of ledger. Ledger recover. They're actually capitulating on that. They're postponing it. So we'll talk about that. What else we got?
00:00:59.012 - 00:01:17.014, Speaker B: DCG has missed its payment deadline to its own subsidiary, Genesis. So we'll talk about what that means. They're not paying themselves. Yeah, they're not paying themselves. They failed to pay themselves $630,000,000. So what is the fallout of that? We will cover that as well. Tornado cash.
00:01:17.014 - 00:01:36.122, Speaker B: Did you hear about this, Ryan? Tornado cash got hijacked. I did a governance attack over tornado cash. It's kind of funny just because it's tornado cash. So it's gotten hijacked from the nation state, and now also two people are hijacking it. And then what else are we going to talk about?
00:01:36.176 - 00:01:43.162, Speaker A: We got this Fed report that came out. Okay. The Federal Reserve. Did you know one in ten Americans use cryptocurrency? Who's telling us that?
00:01:43.216 - 00:01:44.102, Speaker B: The Fed.
00:01:44.246 - 00:02:00.802, Speaker A: We got to get into this report. There's a ton of really cool stats coming out of that. And also, Binance was accused this week of commingling customer funds and company revenue. Got some more info on Doe Kwan as well, and some of the bad boys of crypto finishing that up. So look, man, it's still a good roll up.
00:02:00.856 - 00:02:06.678, Speaker B: It's still a it'll also be my last roll up here in Montenegro, right? This will be the very last one.
00:02:06.764 - 00:02:08.962, Speaker A: Are you going to miss it? So long, Montenegro.
00:02:09.026 - 00:02:16.200, Speaker B: So long, Montenegro. Yeah. Will I miss it? My experience here has been great. I want to go home.
00:02:17.290 - 00:02:22.278, Speaker A: Well, you've been away from your home for, like, months now, right? Eight weeks. Month? Two. Eight weeks.
00:02:22.444 - 00:02:25.100, Speaker B: The longest I roll from home since college.
00:02:25.630 - 00:02:36.118, Speaker A: I only measure time in roll ups. There's 52 roll ups a year. David's been gone in Montenegro for eight roll ups. You're coming home the next roll up in New York City. That's very exciting.
00:02:36.214 - 00:03:14.118, Speaker B: You're going to be some good old brick in the background. Anyways, gotta talk to our friends and sponsors at consensus who want to let you know that there is this new tool out on the mallet market called Diligence Fuzzing to level up your smart contract security. So this is a tool in addition to your regular security audit. Audits fuzzing is a tool that developers who this ad is targeted towards would probably already know about. You throw a bunch of numbers at your parameters, and if any number comes back and it's a bad number, diligence Fuzzing from Consensus will figure that out for you. So there is a link in the show notes to go get your contracts. Fuzzed.
00:03:14.214 - 00:03:18.186, Speaker A: David, I'm sure all the devs really enjoyed that super technical description of what.
00:03:18.208 - 00:03:21.174, Speaker B: Fuzzing is because they totally need it. But do you know what?
00:03:21.232 - 00:03:43.794, Speaker A: It was not inaccurate. I think that's exactly what Fuzzing actually is, and this is a free tool from consensus. I hope more solidity devs take Fuzzing seriously, because we can very serious subject. Yeah, we can't have more smart contract hacks, okay? Not in 2023. DFI can't take another hit like this. We've been down bad guys. Let's fuzz all our contracts so this doesn't happen.
00:03:43.794 - 00:03:49.000, Speaker A: All right? Get to the markets, shall we? Okay. Bitcoin price on the week. What are we looking at?
00:03:49.610 - 00:03:55.670, Speaker B: We can count it as not a flat week if we really want to. Bitcoin is down 1%.
00:03:55.820 - 00:03:56.770, Speaker A: Better than flat.
00:03:56.850 - 00:04:01.340, Speaker B: Start of the week at 26,600. Ending the week at 26,300.
00:04:02.350 - 00:04:14.142, Speaker A: Okay. Below 30K still feels bearish to me. Just like below two k ETH still feels bearish season. And this was bitcoin Miami was last week. Was it? Wait, was it last week, or did it just finish this week?
00:04:14.196 - 00:04:15.840, Speaker B: It was last weekend. Yeah.
00:04:16.210 - 00:04:28.018, Speaker A: This is a time to really rally the troops, isn't it? I mean, haven't we seen previously bitcoin Miami weeks, a little bit of a push up, a little bit of a spike? Or is that just all chart noise? Am I making things up?
00:04:28.184 - 00:04:38.682, Speaker B: I think last year it dumped. Yeah, conferences tend to dump ETH conferences. Bitcoin conferences. It's a pattern.
00:04:38.766 - 00:04:43.350, Speaker A: People get together and they're like, oh, man, this is who I'm surrounded.
00:04:44.090 - 00:04:49.270, Speaker B: We just we just throw super dumb exorbitant parties, and we have to sell our assets to pay for them.
00:04:49.340 - 00:04:52.746, Speaker A: Oh, you think that's know all these.
00:04:52.768 - 00:04:54.554, Speaker B: Events that all the VCs throw? Yeah.
00:04:54.592 - 00:05:09.754, Speaker A: Well, it's interesting. Bitcoin Miami. I didn't hear much about it. The only thing I heard was kind of the contention and the conflict between the ordinals the taproot wizards or something, and the laserize, which is sort of the subtribes of this if you're in bitcoiner circles.
00:05:09.882 - 00:05:14.814, Speaker B: But I think that's also mostly online too. Yeah, I think that's totally the actual conference.
00:05:14.862 - 00:05:15.460, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:17.270 - 00:05:35.686, Speaker B: The things I heard from the bitcoin conference was that Eric Wall and Udi Wertheimer is going up against the Cyber Hornets, which was mostly an online phenomenon. And then also Ron DeSantis's. No, wait. No, not Ron DeSantis. Who's? The Kennedy. Robert Kennedy speech. Those are the two things.
00:05:35.868 - 00:05:49.306, Speaker A: Okay. And yeah, we're going to talk about Ron DeSantis a little bit later. It seems like there's a little bit of red versus blue on the crypto thing. It's becoming more partisan. But that's not in the market section numbers. All right. ETH price.
00:05:49.408 - 00:05:58.986, Speaker B: Sadly, I would count this as flat. We started the week at 18 and ten, 1810, ending the week at 1750. We're down 0.8%. Okay. Sorry, Ryan. It's flat.
00:05:59.018 - 00:06:01.390, Speaker A: Ratio time. Ratio time. Is that flat too?
00:06:01.460 - 00:06:03.966, Speaker B: It's up a little bit. Up a tiny little bit.
00:06:04.068 - 00:06:09.518, Speaker A: You know what? Any flat week, I'm going to be sad from now on because I just like so boring.
00:06:09.694 - 00:06:11.390, Speaker B: Would you prefer down apathy?
00:06:11.470 - 00:06:17.310, Speaker A: Yes. Make up your mind. Market. We going up or down? Stop with this tepid.
00:06:17.470 - 00:06:19.498, Speaker B: Do something. I'm bored.
00:06:19.614 - 00:06:24.422, Speaker A: Can't stand it. Spew it out of my mouth. Thanks, but okay.
00:06:24.476 - 00:06:54.978, Speaker B: Something that is still up only is Lido had. Now that Lido, the largest decentralized staking as a service protocol has withdrawn enabled withdrawals, we are able to see the final of Esaking open up its gate to withdrawals. And so now this is like complete. There's no one left to enable withdrawals yet. We are at all time high of staked ETH. 21 million. We crossed 20 million staked ETH this last week.
00:06:54.978 - 00:07:28.246, Speaker B: So the acceleration of further ETH stake into the beacon chain continues, has continued to accelerate. Not $2 million of there are 2 million Ether units waiting to get into the beacon chain in the validation queue. It would take you, Ryan, if you deposited 32 Ether to be a staker, it would take you almost 1000 hours. I don't even know how many days that is. 967 hours to get into the beacon chain.
00:07:28.278 - 00:07:29.610, Speaker A: How many roll ups is that?
00:07:29.760 - 00:07:41.418, Speaker B: 967. About four roll ups. Because these things are forever. Because we keep on doing these rants. 40 days. It would take you 40 days to get into the beacon chain.
00:07:41.514 - 00:07:46.062, Speaker A: That's a long time. I mean, 40 days, that's a lifetime almost.
00:07:46.116 - 00:07:48.010, Speaker B: Yeah. It would take you two minutes to exit.
00:07:48.090 - 00:07:51.614, Speaker A: So how are people getting in? They just wait, I guess I have to be patient.
00:07:51.742 - 00:07:55.186, Speaker B: Or you could just buy staked ETH. I bet you there's a premium on staked ETH right now.
00:07:55.288 - 00:08:13.126, Speaker A: When does it stop, David? We're going to go from 20 to 22 to 25 to 30 million. That's what it stops. And this what Justin Drake said recently, he's like I think it'll probably be like 30 million ish where we stop. Plus or -15% something like that momentum.
00:08:13.158 - 00:08:18.698, Speaker B: Is very strong the fact. That we are like doubling the rate of growth post withdrawals is awesome.
00:08:18.864 - 00:08:33.582, Speaker A: It's going to stop. This is not an up only chart, though. There is some equilibrium. This is some equilibrium that will be reached. And yeah, I mean, we don't want to see this chart go up only, but for now it's good, good news. For now. We skipped a number.
00:08:33.582 - 00:08:42.546, Speaker A: David crypto market cap. 1.15 trillion. There, I said it for completeness. What chart are we looking at with Lido? Yeah.
00:08:42.568 - 00:08:54.834, Speaker B: So this is Lido withdrawals after one week. Okay, so a whopping 450,000 Ether got withdrawn from Lido. And I'm saying, whopping jokingly? Because do you know how much Ether.
00:08:54.882 - 00:09:10.202, Speaker A: Is actually in Lido, Ryan, of 20 million? 21 million Ether. I'm going to say, what's Lido have like 30% of that? Something close, you're on target. 7 million. Something like this.
00:09:10.256 - 00:09:27.470, Speaker B: Wow. Nice job. 6.7 million is how much Ether is deposited in slido. So 470,000 ether got withdrawn. 430,000 of that was Celsius. 40,000 Ether was withdrawn just by, like, general users.
00:09:27.550 - 00:09:33.198, Speaker A: Oh, Celsius. I remember those guys. What are they doing with it? Paying down some debts.
00:09:33.374 - 00:09:53.094, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they're refunding some depositors. Yeah, they are liquidating it. Yeah. So Lido, I would say, has held up in terms of the snow globe effect. I mean, they lost half a million Ether of their 6.6 million, and most of that was Celsius. Rocket pool took the largest share of 7700 Ether.
00:09:53.094 - 00:09:54.060, Speaker B: Not that much.
00:09:55.070 - 00:10:02.670, Speaker A: Yeah, not that much. So what is happening with all this Lido? It's not being restaked, it's just going back to kind of Celsius?
00:10:03.490 - 00:10:12.046, Speaker B: I don't know. I'm assuming whoever is doing the Celsius bankruptcy is liquidating the Ether. They're selling it for dollars, right?
00:10:12.228 - 00:10:25.380, Speaker A: Yeah. I would assume. By the way, some of this ETH is probably mine. Tiny fraction. I love banks. I love them. Looking forward to never getting that back.
00:10:26.710 - 00:10:30.114, Speaker B: They're going to sell your Ether for you and give you back USDC.
00:10:30.242 - 00:10:39.786, Speaker A: I mean, to be fair, though, to Celsius, this is probably the most rational place they actually stored their ETH because they put it in all sorts of.
00:10:39.808 - 00:10:47.690, Speaker B: Other yeah, they bought a bitcoin mining operation. Stupidest thing to do with customer funds.
00:10:48.350 - 00:10:53.294, Speaker A: Oh, man, those are the days. I hope we never do that again. Like crypto in general.
00:10:53.412 - 00:10:54.800, Speaker B: Knock on wood, please.
00:10:55.170 - 00:11:35.622, Speaker A: Okay, let's talk about the bigger picture markets. All right? Because the R word that is recession was bandied about this week in Germany, a German economy entered recession as inflation hurts consumers. That is the title here. So the German economy is officially in recession under the economist definition of that word, which is multiple quarters of negative GDP. So we're there yet? We're there already in Germany. Is this only a matter of time before recession sweeps through other areas of Europe comes to the United States? Do you have any takes on that, David?
00:11:35.766 - 00:12:02.686, Speaker B: Well, I think the people paying attention to macro all understood that recession is coming globally. It's just a matter of how fast and how hard and for how long. The idea of being announced that we are entering a recession kind of just seems illogical. Market downturn. We need an arbitrary definition of what a recession is in order to be able to announce that we are in one. But, yes, we are entering a phase of slower growth.
00:12:02.798 - 00:12:37.550, Speaker A: Well, there we are, slower growth. And this is not just slower growth, it's negative growth. That is the economist definition of recession. Meanwhile, this to me was the chart of the week. This is from Genevieve, a chart on buying versus renting in America. And there's two lines on this chart all the way from the 1970s. This yellow line is the cost to buy in terms of monthly fees, how much does it cost if you are in a house, let's say, or in an apartment and you own that piece of property, versus the cost to rent? That is this blue, I guess, turquoise type line here.
00:12:37.550 - 00:13:09.910, Speaker A: And it's interesting how the lines are sort of correlated in that they go up together. But there are these periods of time where the cost to buy far outstrips the cost to rent. And I think these periods of time sort of resemble bubbles, housing price bubbles, for example. So we see this one in 2006. So the yellow line shoots far above the blue line. So the cost to buy is much more expensive than the cost to rent. Now, look at things today.
00:13:09.980 - 00:13:10.614, Speaker B: David, right?
00:13:10.652 - 00:13:54.326, Speaker A: And this happens since COVID we've got a yellow line that has far outstripped the blue line. That means the cost to buy, right now, 2700 per month is the average cost per month for a mortgage versus the cost to rent is 1850. Why is this happening? I mean, to me, this just looks like asset price inflation, particularly in the housing market. Particularly in the property market. And I know this is hitting younger people, disproportionately people are in their 20s, in their early 30s, never purchased any property, never bought a home. And they're like, I never will be able to do this thing. And you're asking for 10% down, 20% down.
00:13:54.326 - 00:14:06.998, Speaker A: In order for me to also buy this property, I can't afford it. I'm just going to be renting for the rest of my life. That's how it seems to many people in the economy. I think this has a psychological impact too. Do you have any thoughts on this chart?
00:14:07.094 - 00:14:30.222, Speaker B: Yeah, it's hard for podcast listeners to, I think, really appreciate this. Visual the cost of byline deviated away from the cost of rent line like three times in this chart. Once in the 1980s during the mortgage rate inflation of the early 1980s, then a second time in the housing bubble of 2006. And now a third time. And this third time is the most recent time. Where we are now is like three times higher than the other two bubbles. The other two bubbles are about the same size.
00:14:30.222 - 00:14:50.194, Speaker B: This one's like three times higher. The other thing that's important to note is that even though this cost of is accelerating way beyond the cost of rent, the cost of rent is also at an accelerating rate, too. Both are up and so it just is a graph of like man, the cost of living sucks right now. It is hard to be alive. Being alive is expensive.
00:14:50.322 - 00:15:23.922, Speaker A: It's getting more and more expensive and wages aren't rising commensurate as well. Also this week, David, one of the most interesting reports I've seen in a while came out and you actually put this to the agenda, so why don't you introduce this? Did you know, bankless listener, that one in ten Americans uses cryptocurrency, either holds or transacts in cryptocurrency? Was that report put out by Coinbase? By. Kraken by? I don't know. The Ethereum Foundation? No. The Federal Reserve. This is a report from the Federal Reserve. David, what are we looking at here?
00:15:24.056 - 00:15:48.810, Speaker B: So we're looking at a graph of just different metrics and stats about the American population and their relationship with crypto. So here are some important stats. In 2021, this used to be 12%. 12% of people use crypto in any single way in 2023. Now we are down or 2022, we are down to 10%. So we lost 2% of all Americans, which actually is not so bad in the bear market. Most people are sticking around.
00:15:48.810 - 00:16:25.250, Speaker B: And then there was another poll why are people using crypto? 21% both said to send money faster and also because the business or person preferred it. 20% of people said because of privacy. Some other interesting stats white US citizens actually are the least likely to be crypto users. So black, Hispanic, Asian, all coming in with much stronger numbers than white people, which is interesting. Males use crypto twice as much as females. No, that's not a surprise whatsoever, but I think the punchline is really what you said, one in ten Americans.
00:16:25.410 - 00:16:57.474, Speaker A: That's actually huge. And by the way, when they track usage, this is surprising to me. So as you would expect, the predominant use case is bought or held as an investment and that was 11% in 2021. It's 8% now, so that's decreased. But the other use case is used to buy something or make a payment. That's 2%, not insignificant. 2% of Americans are using this to buy or make a payment or sending money to friends or family and that has not decreased in 2022, which is very interesting.
00:16:57.474 - 00:17:35.418, Speaker A: But if you're the Fed and you're looking at these numbers, David, and you're like, oh, interesting. By the way, this report was not a report on crypto. The report is economic well being of US households in 2022 and they have to include crypto now. Why? Because it's tied into economic well being, it's tied into payments, it's tied into assets. And if you're the Fed and you're looking at this report, you're looking at the numbers and you're like oh wow, 10%. One in ten Americans are using crypto. This is no longer an insignificant portion of the population that is using an alternative to the banking system that you set up and propagate.
00:17:35.418 - 00:17:56.306, Speaker A: No wonder this is starting to enter national discourse and political discourse. Like it's an important issue when you have 10% of Americans using something other than the US banking system. I think the banks, of which the most prominent is the Fed, the central banker of central bankers have to take notice and that's what they're doing here.
00:17:56.488 - 00:18:24.174, Speaker B: And there's also important to note, the investment use case is outstripping the utility use case. And that's natural, right? The reason why there's more investors is because investors try and predict the future. And so actual utility of these things is going to lag investors here in Montenegro, in this crypto community that I've been living within the last two years, there's people from Africa, crypto people from Africa and the users of crypto in Africa, like 2% in America? No, like 20, 30%.
00:18:24.292 - 00:18:25.262, Speaker A: Are you kidding me?
00:18:25.316 - 00:18:57.270, Speaker B: Yeah. And so it makes sense, like in crypto where we're well financialized and well banked that oh yeah, only 2%, but entire continents where we don't really consider, we don't talk about utility in Africa because it's not like in the moment of crypto Twitter, like crypto, Twitter doesn't really care about that. But utility is off the charts and usage is off the charts. And so only in America, I think, do you see investors actually like tripling the rate of actual users and you can actually see this in the stats set.
00:18:57.420 - 00:19:03.020, Speaker A: And by the way, David, did you know that Bankless is the number one podcast in Tunisia right now?
00:19:03.390 - 00:19:05.626, Speaker B: Number one podcast, number one business and.
00:19:05.648 - 00:19:30.738, Speaker A: Investing podcast or number one, number one business and investing. It might be across all categories too now. It's probably not across all categories. It's probably too much like number one in business and investing. I mean, Bankless has a pretty cool African community right now and there's like a Bankless Africa that's really taken this over. So that is amazing to see. I mean, that is at the end of the day why we're here.
00:19:30.738 - 00:19:40.230, Speaker A: Be really interesting to see a similar economic well being report in other emerging market areas as well. And what the percentages look like there? I haven't seen that yet.
00:19:40.380 - 00:20:00.990, Speaker B: Brian Armstrong had a take about this report and this report is coming in during the lack of scalability in the crypto ecosystem. And so he tweets out early days. Once layer two really gets going, it will be going like from dial up to broadband. So imagine how much utility we can get when we can get people onto a low fee environment.
00:20:02.290 - 00:20:21.598, Speaker A: Great. Take something else that I feel like is bullish for crypto is this whole AI thing. But before we get to that story, can you tell us about Nvidia shares spiked 26% on huge forecast beat driven by AI chip demand. Why'd you pull this into the market section today, David?
00:20:21.694 - 00:21:05.522, Speaker B: Well, mainly because it's a slow week in crypto, Ryan, but also I thought this was particularly interesting. Anyways. Okay, so Nvidia reports 4.3 billion in sales versus expected 3.9. Where did that come from? It come from demand for its GPU chips, from cloud vendors, as well as the very large consumer internet companies which like to use Nvidia trips to chain and deploy generative AI applications like OpenAI's chat GBT. Okay, so AI is starting to impact equities the demand for AI growth of AI, specifically Nvidia. The other important thing, Ryan, I think that was useful and the kind of the punchline of this thing, the market cap of Nvidia as a company went from 755,000,000,000 to 973,000,000,000 in one day.
00:21:05.522 - 00:21:13.202, Speaker B: This last yesterday. It's almost basically a trillion dollar market cap. It grew one Ethereum in market cap.
00:21:13.336 - 00:21:15.230, Speaker A: It's incredible. One Ethereum.
00:21:15.310 - 00:21:16.270, Speaker B: One Ethereum.
00:21:16.430 - 00:21:20.886, Speaker A: $220,000,000,000 or something like that. That's what Ethereum is right now.
00:21:20.988 - 00:21:35.050, Speaker B: Yeah, which is so dumb because all of these AI things that Nvidia is going to help train and all the open chat GBT, what money do you think these companies, these AI bots, are going to use? It's going to use ether.
00:21:36.430 - 00:21:52.954, Speaker A: I think that's what the opportunity is. So, like, Nvidia sells GPUs and of course, AI models are massive consumers of GPUs. By the way, is the gamer community upset about this? I know they were mad at crypto mining for a while because we were the poor gamers.
00:21:53.082 - 00:22:01.346, Speaker B: Like all the Ethereum miners suck up all their chips. Finally, Ethereum went to proof of stake. It's been eight years since I can.
00:22:01.368 - 00:22:02.706, Speaker A: Afford my video, been able to get.
00:22:02.728 - 00:22:09.602, Speaker B: A GPU, and then all of a sudden we have this AI revolution. It's like, oh, no, this is going to be way more profitable than your game. Oh, poor gamers.
00:22:09.666 - 00:22:33.034, Speaker A: Well, I think the tie in here with crypto is blockspace. Really hasn't had its AI demand moment. Yeah, all right, GPUs have we're starting to see it here. And look at this. A 26% increase in Ethereum, a 200 billion dollar increase in real world stock price as a result. I think once the AIS start to demand block space, we're going to see something similar. And we're still a ways ahead of that.
00:22:33.034 - 00:22:41.214, Speaker A: I feel like we're maybe a couple of years ahead of that, but I think that is coming as well and will mirror what we're seeing in GPUs. David, what do we have coming up next?
00:22:41.332 - 00:23:06.434, Speaker B: Coming up next, ledger postpones its recover. How, why did that happen? We'll talk about that.

So after all of the Ledger controversy, ledger has decided to delay the release of its recover product.
00:25:41.706 - 00:26:07.874, Speaker B: So why did they do this? They heard all the community backlash. They say in this announcement, we'll release Ledger recover product as soon as this firmware part of the code will be published. So this is a way for people to actually verify the firmware before people install it onto the ledger, to make sure that it only does the things that it will say that it does when people install it. Interesting take. Interesting response, Ryan. What do you think about this?
00:26:07.992 - 00:27:12.610, Speaker A: I mean, my question is happy ending, question mark, I guess, is this kind of a happy ending? So if you guys missed the last two weeks of this, there's been this massive controversy over this product that Ledger added, called Ledger Recover, that essentially enables, with your permission, you have to click some buttons on your ledger, but it enables the firmware with a ledger software update and an opt in service called Recover. Allows them to basically take out your seed phrase, send it to multiple parties, and store it there so that recover users. Ledger recover users, which, again, is an opt in service, but it still can be activated. Allows quicker recovery. And so, of course, hardcore crypto users, anyone who cares very deeply about self sovereignty and keeping their private keys and the thing that they were sold in the hardware wallet was very concerned about that. It's like, what, this company can actually extract the seed phrase, my private keys outside of the hardware wallet. Like, isn't this the purpose of the hardware wallet? And now so here's, ledger.
00:27:12.610 - 00:28:02.838, Speaker A: There was massive controversy last week and it spilled certainly over into this week. Now here's Ledger coming out and saying, hey, we're just going to delay that feature, like we got it wrong. And they're also saying that they're going to open source most of their operating system, starting with Ledger Recover to make it fully auditable. I hope they open source the firmware as well, or as much of that as possible. I think this pressure, the reason I said happy ending, question mark is because it seems like this pressure is actually increasing the motivation for Ledger to open source elements of its tech stack. And I think that additional transparency and accountability is only a good thing for crypto and for this space. Without this controversy, would that have happened? I mean, probably not.
00:28:02.838 - 00:28:07.366, Speaker A: So maybe this is turning into a happy ending here. What do you think about that take?
00:28:07.468 - 00:28:45.806, Speaker B: Yeah, what I learned from having Charles, the CTO of Ledger on the podcast is that really there is no other way to have maximum the assurances that the crypto industry wants from its hardware wallets. You can't have that unless all of the updates and all of the software part of the hardware wallet are open source and verifiable by the public. Without that, there's always going to be some trust. And Ledger has stated that this has always been a part of their roadmap. So this actually technically isn't new. The new thing is that they are saying that they are accelerating this and they are also not releasing the recovered product until they have completed some open source milestones as well. So that's news.
00:28:45.928 - 00:28:59.626, Speaker A: I think that's good. All right, David, we got DCG missing a payment to themselves, I think digital currency group of is what's going on? What happened this week? And why is this subject relevant? So this.
00:28:59.648 - 00:29:52.374, Speaker B: Goes back to the Genesis gemini Earn Grayscale and DCG Mess. And so Genesis had a hole in its balance sheet because it had a bunch of money lent out to Three Arrows Capital who got liquidated. And then that led to the insolvency or the inability for Gemini earned customers to get their money back. DCG filled the hole in Genesis's balance sheet by just writing them a loan. And so DCG but DCG needed to make a payment to Genesis, a $630,000,000 loan to Genesis to fill the hole in the balance sheet. DCG did not pay that when that came due last week. And so what does this mean? This is ultimately going to would be the money to go and pay back Gemini earned customers and anyone else who is a creditor of Genesis and so Gemini.
00:29:52.374 - 00:30:30.120, Speaker B: This is why this is a post on Gemini's website, because this would also otherwise be their money. There's a handful of groups, the Unsecured Creditors committee, the ad hoc group of creditors in Gemini are considering whether to provide forbearance to DCG to avoid a DCG default forbearance I had to look this up. Special agreement between a lender and a borrower to delay a foreclosure. And so that is kind of the news this week overall. I kind of was going through this news, Ryan. I was like, okay, other than Gemini Earn customers who are waiting to get their money back, what does this have to do with how is this going to impact the crypto markets? And I'm kind of.
00:30:33.130 - 00:30:47.494, Speaker A: I mean, I feel like all of this is known. We know that DCG is not in good there's there's not really new information here. Is this like some kind of slow motion bankruptcy of DCG?
00:30:47.542 - 00:30:48.806, Speaker B: It's a slow motion sort of slow.
00:30:48.838 - 00:31:00.510, Speaker A: Motion insolvency that was going on. That was kind of my base prediction, though, right? I think that's what people expected would happen. Guess what, David? I had some money in Gemini Earn as well.
00:31:00.580 - 00:31:04.720, Speaker B: Because you love banks. That's why you had money there.
00:31:05.490 - 00:31:40.262, Speaker A: Again, not very much bankless listeners, but I tried all of the things at one point in time and I think that's the big question is there's something like $800 million, $900 million was in Gemini Earn and this is retail money primarily. And the folks who have that money had that money in Gemini. Urn are just wondering whether they're going to get it back. And I don't think that this story provides any closure to them. It's certainly not comforting to know that DCG didn't pay another $630,000,000 on the scheduled time. So not great news from that perspective.
00:31:40.406 - 00:31:58.818, Speaker B: Yeah. So if you guys want to dive down into this detail a little bit more. Rom, former bankless podcast guest, we've had him on recently, twice now. Put a great Twitter thread together. I'll summarize it pretty quickly. Basically, he says DCG needs forbearance they missed the $630,000,000 in payments. DCG does have great assets but they have a financing problem.
00:31:58.818 - 00:32:46.446, Speaker B: Bills are due today, but the cash flow that they have comes over the next few years. Also, there's this additional pressure coming from the inevitability of a Bitcoin ETF. A Bitcoin ETF will come whether Gary Gensler approves one, maybe not, but the next chair will. At some point in time, there will be a Bitcoin ETF, and that will really reduce all of Grayscales, the main cash cow of DCG, their ability to take fees, because Grayscale is charging 200 bips, where an effective ETF from some market competitive thing would more likely be 30 bips. And so fees going into Grayscale would basically go to zero. And so that's DCG's last remaining big asset. And Rom said he'd done a bit of the math.
00:32:46.446 - 00:33:07.526, Speaker B: There's just not enough time for Grayscale to generate cash to pay off the $1.7 billion of debt that DCG 1.7 billion. Yes, it's a lot, David. Yes. And so the idea here is Grayscale is a cash cow, that time is running short. As soon as there's a Bitcoin ETF, then the fees are just not going to cut it.
00:33:07.526 - 00:33:11.046, Speaker B: And so DCG is like time is not on DCG's side here.
00:33:11.068 - 00:33:27.166, Speaker A: I feel like everyone's just hoping for another crypto bull market to just paper these things mistakes. Right? If Bitcoin goes to 100K, then DCG can afford this. All right, what do we got? Tornado cash was hacked. What does that even mean?
00:33:27.348 - 00:33:58.294, Speaker B: Okay, so a malicious tornado Dow governance proposal was proposed, and then that malicious proposal actually got 700,000 votes because there was a sneaky part of that proposal that was not no one saw it. No one saw the potential exploit, a potential bug. And so this proposer got this proposal to go through, which ultimately allowed a malicious exploiter through governance control, allowed the attacker to basically take over the Dow.
00:33:58.342 - 00:34:02.422, Speaker A: Wait, what's the proposer of this governance proposal? Was that the hacker?
00:34:02.486 - 00:34:20.106, Speaker B: That was the hacker? I would imagine so, yes. Malicious governance proposal. I'm assuming the governance proposal allowed the attacker to grant themselves 1.2 million fake votes after it got 0.7 million legit votes.
00:34:20.138 - 00:34:55.386, Speaker A: And then so what does that mean? Recap on tornado cash. Okay, so it is a privacy protocol, of course, that US. Citizens cannot use. Thank you, OFAC but it's a privacy protocol, kind of a mixer you put your ETH in if you want to sort of anonymize it, and you can get it out. And of course, we've talked about this a lot, but there's a governance component to this protocol, and there's a token called torn T-O-R-N. That is the governance token behind this protocol. Is that the part that was hacked? The governance protocol itself, not the smart contracts with all of the mixed ETH in it.
00:34:55.386 - 00:34:56.650, Speaker A: Am I correct about this?
00:34:56.720 - 00:35:27.570, Speaker B: That is correct, yes. So the actual pools are not affected because they are completely cut off from exploitation by the governance. Tornado cash governance has no governance over the pools. They are their own self sovereign smart contracts on ethereum. And so the individual pools are intact. So what the attacker can do is withdraw all the locked votes and drain all of the tokens in the governance contracts. So there's some funds, treasury funds, and then also some torn tokens, and so those got exploited.
00:35:27.570 - 00:35:33.560, Speaker B: Now basically, the torn token is going to zero. And that's basically the story.
00:35:35.450 - 00:35:37.320, Speaker A: Does this kill? Tornado cash.
00:35:38.650 - 00:36:02.480, Speaker B: Yes. One of the functions of Tornado Cash governance was the relayers, which is how people actually achieved privacy. So, like, when you withdrew your ether from Tornado Cash, you need to process that as a transaction. Who pays for the gas fees? If you pay for the gas fees, then you actually just DOX yourself again. So it makes it pointless. So a relayer would process that transaction for you. And that was up to governance, I think.
00:36:02.480 - 00:36:09.060, Speaker B: Yeah. Anyways, governance over tornado Cash is dead. Pools are still intact. TBD on really what happens next?
00:36:09.910 - 00:36:18.658, Speaker A: And who was the attacker? Like, the CIA attacking it. I mean, there's reports that this was the North Korean group. What are they called again? Lazarus.
00:36:18.834 - 00:36:22.614, Speaker B: Why would they attack tornado cash, though? Because they love tornado cash.
00:36:22.812 - 00:36:26.338, Speaker A: I don't know. Who knows what's going on? Psyops.
00:36:26.514 - 00:36:54.090, Speaker B: It's an interesting case study in exploitative governance attacks, which is a thing that we've known about. And now security hole isn't mean. It's it's also why. But we did know that Tornado Cash privacy pools were cut off from this. And so that's been the way that they've been designed. Other systems like this are designed like Uniswap governance. If Uniswap governance got exploited, the funds in Uniswap would be completely safe because of the same principle.
00:36:54.250 - 00:37:02.180, Speaker A: Yeah, but it does some funky things. I don't know. You can't govern the thing anymore. You can't upgrade it. All sorts of bad things happen.
00:37:02.550 - 00:37:19.858, Speaker B: It's just especially weird when Tornado Cash governance philosophy was supposed to be very and is very, very separate from the actual product. Same thing with Uniswap. It's like, oh, governance got exploited. Oh, no, we can't govern Tornado Cash anymore. All the torrent token, that's maximally ungovernable.
00:37:20.034 - 00:37:56.422, Speaker A: I think what's really fascinating about this is that's a story, but it's like, who is the attacker, the identity of the attacker, what the motivations are there? This is one of the most interesting set of smart contracts on ethereum, given kind of the geopolitical confrontation about it. So only set of smart contracts on the ofax sanction list. All right. Binance accused of commingling customer funds. So mixing customer funds and company revenue together. That's a story that came out of Reuters this week, a special report. I'm sure CZ would call this FUD, David, but what are the details of this story?
00:37:56.556 - 00:38:27.610, Speaker B: So the accusation, the details are that Binance commingled customer funds and also profits and company money into the same accounts. Interestingly. At Silvergate Bank, I did not know Binance had an account at Silvergate. This was before it collapsed, of course. So customer dollars flowed into Silvergate and then also profits, and also customer company money also flowed into the same account at Silvergate. So big accounting? No, no. Best case scenario is that it's just a big accounting.
00:38:27.610 - 00:38:36.174, Speaker B: No, I think one of the reasons why this is news is, like, the last time that we saw Commingled customer funds, it was FTX, because and the.
00:38:36.212 - 00:38:41.598, Speaker A: Last founder CEO said, oh, that's just FUD as well. Remember that guy? His name is SBF.
00:38:41.694 - 00:39:10.134, Speaker B: Yeah. So if you look into the story, you'll see, like, customer flows. Customer funds flowed into Silvergate, and then that went into a firm in the Skelliest called Key Vision, which was controlled by Binance, by CZ. But basically, this is the story. Commingle customer funds, they found no evidence that client money was taken. But the idea is, in the FTX story, it's like, yeah, customers money wasn't taken or stolen. They was just liquidated because they were trading.
00:39:10.134 - 00:39:16.174, Speaker B: So no one really knows. Now it's a black box. And so it doesn't really do anything to help the narrative of Binance as a big black box.
00:39:16.292 - 00:39:49.580, Speaker A: It certainly doesn't. It's more of a black box. I hate that we're in the position of, like, we have to actually kind of trust CZ. And of course, CZ is saying four to this, right? It's more FUD, basically. And if you don't know what four means, we actually recorded an episode with CZ where he kind of explains that that's coming out Monday, and you can get his takes on this and some other things. But I guess what do we know? Finance is still standing after the 2022 and 2023 bank runs. All right, so they didn't go under.
00:39:50.510 - 00:39:56.662, Speaker B: They processed $17 billion of withdrawals in the week that people tried to do the run on Finance.
00:39:56.806 - 00:40:22.814, Speaker A: Right? So they may be doing something. We have no idea. They weren't doing it to the extent that Sandbank been freed was, and FTX was right. I do wish we had better proof of reserves in place. And that's a question we asked CZ. He kind of said that wasn't the full answer. But we need better proof of reserves for the crypto exchanges.
00:40:22.814 - 00:40:45.418, Speaker A: We need better audits, we need better records. I don't know how much you can trust a Binance. My answer to this is you got to use multiple crypto exchanges. That's always the way. And you don't keep your funds on a crypto exchange. Guys, public bathroom, go in, do your business, get out. That's what you should be doing.
00:40:45.418 - 00:41:31.500, Speaker A: And so you're not put in this place of having to trust a crypto bank, at least at an individual level. At the same time, David, I don't know if all of the critics are right on. Like, there is this notion that Binance and CZ are just as corrupt as another SBF. Certainly that's a popular notion in the US. But then we have Operation Choke Point. How difficult is it to actually get a bank account in the United States? Maybe there are some reasons, not necessarily for commingling funds that's probably always unjustifiable, but maybe there are some reasons that the backend looks messy. It's because it's very difficult to come into the light and actually get a regulated bank account in the United States.
00:41:31.500 - 00:42:21.354, Speaker A: So I don't really know who to trust in this situation. And I hate that we are in this position in crypto and there's certainly some blame on the CZ side, the binance side of things to go around, but there's absolutely some blame on the US regulatory apparatus side and they haven't made this easy. They've just pushed more into the dark. I mean, we have Wells notices going to Coinbase, who has been domiciled in the US from the very beginning and has been kind of the student in the front of the class, straight A's student, always saying, yes teacher, I'll do whatever you need, like being very regulatory compliant. And they are having trouble with the current administration, the current regulatory apparatus in the US. If they can't do it, I mean, we got a real problem. So that's my take.
00:42:21.354 - 00:42:32.094, Speaker A: It's not necessarily satisfying right now because I don't know who to trust and who not. There's not sort of a very clear binary about this, but that's all I got. What do you think?
00:42:32.212 - 00:43:15.318, Speaker B: Yeah, we talked about this in the podcast. Like binance and tether are these two very large systemic components of the crypto industry that are just FUD magnets. Everyone wants to FUD them and anytime I see the next tether FUD scroll across my Twitter feed, I just keep on scrolling because it's been that way ever since I've gotten to crypto. There's always been tether FUD and now it's starting to be like, oh, now there's binance FUD, binance FUD, binance FUD, binance FUD. And the only reason why I know to scroll past tether FUD is because it's always happened and nothing's ever come to pass. And it's starting to be that way with binance too. But the only reason why I keep on scrolling is because every other time it's always passed.
00:43:15.318 - 00:43:21.546, Speaker B: That's the only reason I've got. Not that I know anything, it's just like oh, let me ask, never came.
00:43:21.568 - 00:43:27.194, Speaker A: To be do you trust tether enough to store your stablecoins in tether or do you choose a different stablecoin?
00:43:27.322 - 00:43:30.718, Speaker B: I've never held tether for more than a day or whatever.
00:43:30.804 - 00:44:04.858, Speaker A: And why is that? Is it because you don't trust them? To the extent you trust other stablecoins, there's better options? Yeah, that's the way I've always felt. That's also the way I feel about centralized exchange choices. I think there's still where we are in this industry in this stage is to be a crypto user. You are in the Wild West, in the journey west. You can't trust anybody. You have to be educated about this stuff, and you have to make discerning choices. So if it smells bad, even if it's not entirely bad, you don't know.
00:44:04.858 - 00:44:25.230, Speaker A: Just don't put your eggs in that basket or just only put a few eggs in that basket. Speaking as a former Celsius user, and I had very little in that right? And it was just kind of to test, and very intentionally so, because bad stuff can happen in crypto.
00:44:29.350 - 00:44:58.102, Speaker B: It's FUD week. All right, moving on. Coming up next in the rest of the news base on Mainnet soon, TM pudgy penguins on Amazon got Toys NFT Toys on Amazon actually following through with his roadmap. That's pretty cool. And then also, could restaking mess up Ethereum new Vitalik article just drops about his concerns about restaking, which Ryan and I will unpack. So all of that news and more. But first, I want to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible, especially MetaMask.
00:44:58.102 - 00:45:43.118, Speaker B: If we have used any weird jargon that is esoteric and niche and needs explaining and we forgot to explain it, then MetaMask Learn is for you. Let's go hear from them. Learning about crypto is hard until now. Introducing MetaMask Learn, an open educational platform about crypto, Web Three, self custody, wallet management, and all the other topics needed to onboard people into this crazy world of crypto. MetaMask Learn is an interactive platform, with each lesson offering a simulation for the task at hand, giving you actual practical experience for navigating web3. The purpose of MetaMask Learn is to teach people the basics of self custody and wallet security in a safe environment. And while MetaMask Learn always takes the time to define web Three specific vocabulary, it is still a jargon free experience for the CryptoCurious.
00:45:43.118 - 00:46:29.314, Speaker B: User friendly, not scary, MetaMask Learn is available in ten languages, with more to be added soon, and it's meant to cater to a global Web Three audience. So are you tired of having to explain crypto concepts to your friends? Go to learn MetaMask. IO and add MetaMask Learn to your guides to get onboarded into the world of Web three. Mantle is a brand new high performance ethereum layer two network built differently from the other layer two s you may be familiar with. Mantle is a modular layer two built on the Op stack, but uses eigen layer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer one. Not only does this reduce Mantle's gas fees by 80% compared to other layer two s, but it also reduces gas fee volatility. Mantle has a decentralized sequencer set, eliminating the risk of downtime and censorship on the network.
00:46:29.314 - 00:47:21.774, Speaker B: And because Mantle implements multiparty computation nodes, layer one settlement execution is shortened from seven days to as low as just one or two. Mantle is the first layer two built by a dow and is backed by one of the biggest dow treasuries in the world, bitdao. Mantle already has subcommunities from around web Three onboarded to help the growth of Mantle, like Game Seven for Web Three gaming or Dao for the world of DSI and Bybit for TVL Liquidity and Onramps. Check out Mantle at mantle XYZ and follow them on Twitter at Zero xmantle. Apple the web Two mafia starting to actually give some green lights to some crypto apps. So we got two reports, but one out of Step In and one out of Axio Infinity that their in app. Crypto features that involve trading or buying or selling of crypto assets got approved and are not paying the 30% fee.
00:47:21.922 - 00:47:22.522, Speaker A: What?
00:47:22.656 - 00:47:23.418, Speaker B: Pretty cool.
00:47:23.504 - 00:47:26.150, Speaker A: I wonder if they had to kiss the ring to the mob boss.
00:47:26.310 - 00:47:55.118, Speaker B: I don't know. So Step In announced the integration of Apple Pay as the first blockchain game. Users can buy, sell, and trade Step In NFT sneakers in the app and pay for them with debit and credit cards linked to Apple Pay. And so you can purchase Spark Credits, which I think is an internal currency to Step In. And then spark credits is one USDC. And so USDC is in this app that is approved by Apple and then also similarly, Axio Infinity has also gotten its app approved.
00:47:55.214 - 00:48:20.970, Speaker A: Finally, after years of them trying this, Axio Infinity game launches on the Apple App Store in key markets. I guess maybe there's a thawing going on in the Cold War between crypto Web Three and Apple, at least hints of this. I hope it continues. Apple has been a massive gatekeeper. I mean, uniswap the wallet couldn't even get approved for the longest of times. This seems like good news to me.
00:48:21.040 - 00:48:40.158, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that Apple's got a lot of users. It makes absolutely zero sense for them to charge 30% on every single blockchain integration. And so it was either no blockchain at all in the Apple iOS Store ever, or they let loose. And so finally, maybe there's a turning of the tides.
00:48:40.254 - 00:48:45.410, Speaker A: Maybe I'd like to see more of that before we can say it's a trend, but good signs.
00:48:45.990 - 00:49:22.270, Speaker B: Base main net Coinbase's base layer two built on the Op stack is coming to mainnet soon. TM there is a set of criteria that will unlock the main net launch. A successful hard fork of their testnet, another successful infrastructure review with Op Labs. Op mainnet must upgrade to bedrock, which is also soon TM we talked about that last week. And then completion of audits with no critical issues and some testnet stability. Once all these things happen, then we're going to see the base main net launch and the testnet's been up and running. And so all of these applications that have been building on the testnet, they're just going to be ready to go.
00:49:22.270 - 00:49:27.140, Speaker B: So the theme park that is being built is going to have rides on day one.
00:49:28.710 - 00:49:45.160, Speaker A: Let's just remind bankless listeners as well, this is the first time a major centralized exchange has launched a layer two. The very first time history being made here. I think we even asked CZ. About that. Hey, CZ. You're going to turn the BNB chain into a roll up.
00:49:46.010 - 00:49:49.250, Speaker B: You remember what he well, no, we should tease it.
00:49:49.340 - 00:49:51.254, Speaker A: The answer, guys, is coming on Monday.
00:49:51.302 - 00:50:02.000, Speaker B: When we release the podcast, I'm going to tease it. He did say the BNB team has thought about layer twos on Binance chain. I'm like that's. Not what I asked. Easy.
00:50:04.610 - 00:50:19.154, Speaker A: Well, you can hear that answer coming up on Monday. David, some cool stuff in the NFT world. At least I think so. Pudgy penguins smashes their Amazon debut. Are we looking at a commercial here for Pudgy Penguin Toys? Yeah.
00:50:19.192 - 00:50:21.822, Speaker B: Pudgy penguin, stuffed animals.
00:50:21.966 - 00:50:23.074, Speaker A: Is Teddy playing? Should I?
00:50:23.112 - 00:50:25.670, Speaker B: Teddy bears. But Teddy Penguin kind of weird.
00:50:27.050 - 00:50:31.830, Speaker A: Julie, it's time to go. Oh, that's them on the floor.
00:50:33.290 - 00:50:38.230, Speaker B: It's a big Toy Story looking commercial right now. Oh, it is. Oh, they're waking up alive.
00:50:39.850 - 00:50:49.738, Speaker A: So cute. All right, hangers Kirsta's. Clear. My back was starting to okay, this.
00:50:49.744 - 00:50:51.440, Speaker B: Is the Toy Story rip off.
00:50:52.530 - 00:50:59.626, Speaker A: Has anyone seen my hat? What's that sound? We don't have to watch more. David, do you have a penguin?
00:50:59.658 - 00:51:00.510, Speaker B: I'm curious.
00:51:01.810 - 00:51:03.200, Speaker A: The kids coming back.
00:51:07.490 - 00:51:11.890, Speaker B: Oh, she only took one of the NFTs. Well, clearly she's got a favorite.
00:51:12.230 - 00:51:17.000, Speaker A: Coast is clear. That's the highest market value.
00:51:19.130 - 00:51:30.342, Speaker B: All right, well, here are the stats. $500,000 of Pudgy Penguin stuffed animals were sold in the first week. In the first two days. 20,000.
00:51:30.396 - 00:51:31.366, Speaker A: That seems good.
00:51:31.468 - 00:51:51.120, Speaker B: That seems like it's. Yeah, because, like, NFT market caps aren't that high. They're in the tens of millions of dollars. Maybe Pedgy penguins is over 100. I don't know. 20,000 individual stuffed animal Peggy penguins were sold dominated the charts of Amazon sales, beating brands like Disney, Transformers, Pokemon, Barbie, and Legos. Pretty crazy.
00:51:51.120 - 00:51:53.618, Speaker B: Who's buying all these things?
00:51:53.784 - 00:51:55.940, Speaker A: Is it kids? Are we turning kids?
00:51:56.310 - 00:51:58.500, Speaker B: Is it kids or is it us?
00:52:00.150 - 00:52:08.138, Speaker A: I don't know what's more concerning, I guess. Stuffed animals. There's nothing wrong with stuffed animals if you're a grown adult.
00:52:08.334 - 00:52:29.786, Speaker B: 20,000 individual toys sold. Well, there's only 10,000 Pudgies, so even if every single NFT owner bought two, that's how that would come out to be. All right, congrats to the Pudgy team for executing on the road. Mom NESH up. Yeah, it'd be pretty crazy to see, like, a new toy enter the children's world. And it actually started as, like, a degenerate NFT part project in the bull market.
00:52:29.968 - 00:52:39.760, Speaker A: Crazy, but not like that wouldn't surprise me at all. Yeah, I mean, there's something that would. Okay, yeah, that seems about right. I could totally see that happening.
00:52:40.930 - 00:53:00.598, Speaker B: Okay. All right, moving on. Doe Kwan, our favorite person who's just down the street from me in Montenegro, is back in jail. His bail got revoked. He was freed on bail for a really low number, like, $450,000. And then a judge has revoked that, and now he's back in Montenegro, in jail. That's the story.
00:53:00.764 - 00:53:04.034, Speaker A: Okay. Sorry, doe. No interview on bankless.
00:53:04.082 - 00:53:05.494, Speaker B: No interview. Yeah.
00:53:05.692 - 00:53:41.026, Speaker A: David, did you read this article? It's entitled. Don't overload ethereum's consensus from Vitalik. Buterin and he was really talking about restaking here, which has been a theme we've been talking about a lot on Bankless. And I think the subtext of this theme, these are not the words Vitalik used, but it's basically could restaking hurt Ethereum? Could it kill ethereum? Could it really damage the protocol? And what's kind of your TLDR of his post? Of course, Vitalik does a great job putting it in his own words. But if you were to kind of synthesize this for us, what would you say? He's trying to communicate in this post.
00:53:41.208 - 00:54:17.434, Speaker B: So, just to briefly explain, resaking restaking is when you take your ETH staked, you have staked your ETH to the Ethereum main chain. restaking allows you to take that same ETH that's already staked to Ethereum and then also sign up for additional slashing conditions for a separate and new network. And so say there is an Oracle network that would also like your collateral as a bond to make sure that you correctly report the price. You can restake your Ether to that new Oracle network and then you can get fees from that Oracle network. And then if you lie to that Oracle network, your Ether that's also staked to the Ethereum beacon chain will also be slashed in theory.
00:54:17.482 - 00:54:18.494, Speaker A: So what's the problem?
00:54:18.612 - 00:55:25.410, Speaker B: In theory, you could actually layer this resaking on over and over and over again for juiced up yields. And then people are like, oh wait, that's a lot of slashing conditions. Is that harming the security of Ethereum? And Vitalik is like, no, that doesn't necessarily harm Ethereum, unless whatever these new networks are, if one of them starts to be systemically important at the social layer, and so at the hardware layer and the objectivity layer, there is no restaking and resaking and restaking the layering on of new networks. That doesn't intrinsically threaten Ethereum consensus. What it would do is something like the 2016 Dow hack, where if one of these networks has a lot of restake and something bad happens on that network that's separate from Ethereum, then because that Net One network got so large and it had so much restaked ETH to it that it became systemically important at the cultural level. And then that restaking chain that got exploited would then ask for a rollback or a hard fork of ethereum. That is dangerous.
00:55:26.230 - 00:56:19.270, Speaker A: 2016 is a perfect analog to this, right? So is 2008 banking crisis. I mean, the the intrinsic problem is too big to fail when something becomes too big to fail. And so the stakeholders at the social layer all agree, well, this has become too big to fail. And if it fails, there'll be such social cost to a particular set of stakeholders that we politically care about that we need to bail them out and then they go about that bailout process that's when things have this really negative externality in being too big to fail. And Vitalik is saying, I am concerned, unless we kind of guard at the social layer around this, that that could happen with restaking. And so you designers of restaking, make sure you're doing it correctly. Make sure you're doing it well.
00:56:19.270 - 00:56:59.234, Speaker A: Make sure you're doing it without introducing this hazard into the social layer of Ethereum. And if it becomes too big to fail and there's the prospect, the mention of some sort of a bailout, that's when things move from yellow to orange to closer to red. I think that's what he was communicating in the post, at least to me. And you could see all sorts of possible designs. And it's not just, you know what? It's not just staking that could do this. I could also see if you had a layer two that got kind of too big to fail or something. Let's say layer two too big to fail had, I don't know, layer 220.
00:56:59.272 - 00:57:00.498, Speaker B: Percent broke or something.
00:57:00.584 - 00:57:03.282, Speaker A: Yeah, 20% of Ether on it.
00:57:03.416 - 00:57:19.880, Speaker B: If Arbitrum Bridge broke and all of the Ether that's deposited to Arbitrum somehow was not able to be withdrawn from Arbitrum in some weird way that we didn't expect, would we roll back the chain? It would really hurt to not roll back the chain. And I don't think the Ethereum community would do it.
00:57:20.810 - 00:57:23.498, Speaker A: You think they wouldn't do it and.
00:57:23.664 - 00:57:26.060, Speaker B: It would hurt to not do it. I agree.
00:57:26.430 - 00:58:03.110, Speaker A: And also, because of fork choice rules, there would be a significant faction that actually want to fork ETH in that situation. I would expect. I think it would be a contentious thing. I think there'd be a battle. I think it could be somewhat like the Dow in that you'd have a group who says, yeah, no rollbacks, never. And then if it was big enough, and if you don't think that would qualify Arbitrarium Bridge, just imagine something bigger than David, like more more ETH, more substantial to the ETH validators or whoever's kind of making the political decisions of Ethereum. You could see a world where that could happen.
00:58:03.110 - 00:58:23.754, Speaker A: What's interesting, though, about it is let's say there was some event like that and it did happen and there was a fork. Right? It's always interesting with a fork is ETH holders always end up with double the assets, don't they? I guess, unless there's some sort of hold. And I think that's have you collected.
00:58:23.802 - 00:58:26.110, Speaker B: Your Ether proof of work, Tokens Ryan?
00:58:26.450 - 00:59:06.778, Speaker A: No, I mean, but that's just not a serious, legitimate fork. Right. I certainly collected my Ethereum Classic and then I had the choice whether I wanted to continue Ethereum Classic or whether I wanted to sell it. And I think I, along with the majority of the Ethereum community, sold Ethereum Classic and doubled down on regular old Ethereum. And anyway, what I'm saying is that's actually, like the ultimate remedy. For governance is if things got too contentious, if there was some sort of too big to fail type event and there was a fork, then all the stakeholders have to decide. It's very messy, that's not like what we want to happen.
00:59:06.778 - 00:59:35.910, Speaker A: But I'm just pushing it that to the logical conclusion and it's still not the end of the world, I guess, is what I'm saying. Speaking of forks, there seems to be a bipartisan fork here recently. This is Ron DeSantis. He announced his candidacy as a Republican presidential candidate and he says this you've got every right to do bitcoin. To do bitcoin. I love that. The only reason these people in Washington don't like it is because they don't control it.
00:59:35.910 - 01:00:05.438, Speaker A: Let them do bitcoin, says Ron DeSantis. That's interesting how there's been a growing set of Republicans that have taken the posture of being anti CDBC and pro crypto. Meanwhile, it seems like the Democratic establishment not all of them, of course. In fact, we've had Democratic members of Congress on Bankless in the last couple of weeks. But there is a contingent of establishment, I think Democrats, maybe Elizabeth Warren and her ilk, who are the Biden administration against?
01:00:05.524 - 01:00:06.542, Speaker B: Biden and friends.
01:00:06.676 - 01:00:27.470, Speaker A: I would say the Biden administration is one of them. This is Joe Biden. When he speaks about crypto, he says things like this, and this is him last week. I'm not going to agree to a deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders while putting food assistance at risk. Of course, I personally don't want to put food assistance at risk, but incorporating.
01:00:27.550 - 01:00:28.218, Speaker B: I'm a big fan.
01:00:28.254 - 01:01:07.426, Speaker A: Crypto traders with wealthy tax cheats is some political grouping that I don't appreciate and I don't like. So I'm wondering if this partisan divide will kind of increase. It does seem like if one party doubles down on an issue and Ron DeSantis is kind of making this part of his presidential announcement, you've got every right to do bitcoin, he says. Then the other party has to just be like, oh, they're doing this, so we're going to do the exact opposite. I just worry about that. I don't even know if they've thought about this from a fundamentals base principles perspective. I don't even know if Ron DeSantis does.
01:01:07.426 - 01:01:24.162, Speaker A: I don't even know if he cares. He's just like, oh, here's a crypto. Cohort they have some money, they have some influence. I can get behind this issue, maybe. And so I'm going to be pro crypto. And then Democrats see the pro crypto Republican and they're like, they're pro crypto. We're going to be anti crypto.
01:01:24.162 - 01:01:36.314, Speaker A: And no one actually has a conversation about this and looks at the base principles of the things that we all care about or all have in common. That's my bear case for this, David. I don't know if you see that.
01:01:36.352 - 01:02:06.454, Speaker B: But yeah, your bear case is that political theater. It's just political theater. One of the cool things about crypto is that when you deeply understand crypto and you go down the crypto rabbit hole and you go navigate the dark forest of crypto and you come out the other side understanding how so much more of the world works. And then you see the politics be like, oh, there's this new important thing. And then the left and the right, the red and the blue people just like squabble over it. Now, regardless of the fundamentals, they don't give a shit about our industry. There's like, oh, now we fight over this thing.
01:02:06.454 - 01:02:20.858, Speaker B: Who wants that? Oh, my God. Yeah, I do like the idea of Ron DeSantis saying let them do bitcoin using bitcoin as an idea, not an actual noun. Like, let them do bitcoin using.
01:02:20.944 - 01:02:22.666, Speaker A: How intentional do you think that was?
01:02:22.768 - 01:02:26.570, Speaker B: I don't think very intentional. Okay. I don't think very intentional.
01:02:27.390 - 01:03:00.758, Speaker A: Wow. Well, crypto is still continuing to build, david, we've got some releases this week, the first from Matcha. Let's just show the interface. This is really cool. And of course I can log in with MetaMask as I already have, but Matcha of course, is a decentralized exchange aggregation service. And in the background, do you know, like, decentralized exchange market share? David, we haven't shown this on the roll up in a while, but market share of Dex volume to centralized exchange volume centralized exchanges are losing market share to decentralized exchanges recently and that's been huge. But look at this.
01:03:00.758 - 01:03:07.714, Speaker A: This is Matcha, the new user interface. The really cool thing about it is the search token search functionality.
01:03:07.842 - 01:03:13.178, Speaker B: I have never seen you on well functioning token search in a UI before.
01:03:13.344 - 01:03:48.330, Speaker A: What do you want to buy some ARB? Boom, it's there. And Matcha, of course, is a decentralized exchange aggregator, so it's going to find you the best liquidity across all of it. Anyway, all I'm saying is the user experience. Here's what I'm saying. We have 10% of Americans that hold crypto are using crypto today and the UX has been historically kind of bad. What happens when the UX gets five X better and ten X better? Cool things are going to happen and we're on the cusp of that. And you can see that when you see releases like Matcha that are happening pretty quietly in the background.
01:03:48.330 - 01:03:48.838, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:48.924 - 01:04:08.362, Speaker B: This isn't just a front end UI upgrade, though. They also have some protocol upgrades, faster trade confirmations. They say they've reduced failed trades by 85%. They are still playing your gas fees, although you are still paying it in a roundabout way. But yeah, at least you don't have to pay ETH, which is nice. And then they've indexed 3.7 million tokens to enable that.
01:04:08.416 - 01:04:10.938, Speaker A: 3.7 million? Do you have that many?
01:04:11.024 - 01:04:39.506, Speaker B: Yeah. Coming up on releases, connect has released chain abstraction. So we've talked about account abstraction, but Connect is doing this thing called chain abstraction. And so if you want to say you have like USDC on Arbitrum and you want to send that USDC to Polygon to deploy it in Aave. And that takes you like six transactions. And then if you get over to Polygon and you don't have any matic in your wallet, then your USCC is stuck until you get some matic in your wallet. Chain abstraction does the same thing as account abstraction does for smart contract wallets.
01:04:39.506 - 01:05:02.774, Speaker B: But now we have like, smart bridges. So you can bundle up all of these transactions all at once and then have that bridge and transfer and action on both chains done in one single transaction through Connects, which is a bridge, by the way. Connects is a bridge. But now they are doing this thing called account abstraction. So fewer steps to get what you want done across chain. Really. This fits into this theme of like, Ethereum and its layer two strategy.
01:05:02.774 - 01:05:20.046, Speaker B: All the Salana people are like, oh, you guys are breaking composability, it's breaking UX, blah, blah, blah. Well, the Ethereum people and the layer two, layer three super chain people are like, yeah, but eventually all that will be abstracted and it'll just be one unified super chain. And this is part of that journey. Chain abstraction.
01:05:20.238 - 01:05:25.490, Speaker A: There you go. Chain abstraction builders, you're building. That's. What I get from this last one here is Austria.
01:05:26.250 - 01:05:42.794, Speaker B: Austria XYZ is a NFT backed lending protocol. So NFT in borrow, USDC or some other token out. This is from Joseph DeLong of former SushiSwap fame. And so if you are into the world of NFT phi, Astaria is for you.
01:05:42.912 - 01:05:45.830, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I said weath Astaria.
01:05:45.910 - 01:05:50.070, Speaker B: Astaria. Astria. Astaria. Astaria. It's definitely Astaria.
01:05:50.150 - 01:06:11.246, Speaker A: There you go. Got some jobs of the week here. Jobs. What are we looking at, david Otter, web3 front end engineer. Bankless Ventures needs an investment analyst. Intern Coinbase needs a staff blockchain engineer, staff smart contract engineer. Phantom, a software engineer for mobile, and for front end Uniswap Labs, a senior back end engineer.
01:06:11.246 - 01:06:17.586, Speaker A: We got all the jobs for you on the Bankless Palette.com job site. David, what do we have coming up next?
01:06:17.688 - 01:06:51.130, Speaker B: Coming up next, we got questions from the nation. Somebody asked in the discord, what are settlement insurances? And man, I'm so glad they asked that question. I love that. And then also, what's the difference between the 2019 Bear and the 2023 Bear, as well as some hot takes from Crypto, Twitter and what David and Ryan are bullish on? So we're going to get to all of that and more. But first, a moment to talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.

01:08:22.964 - 01:08:48.210, Speaker A: Show Notes question this week from Tad Zhu in your episode about finality issues of the Beacon Chain, last week used the term Settlement Assurance multiple times. Can you please explain this term further? Thank you. David, is this your alt account that asked this question? Feels like it's teeing you up just to talk about Settlement Assurances, which I know it's something you're passionate about. So tell us, now's your chance. Tell us what are settlement assurances?
01:08:48.290 - 01:09:18.400, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is actually very deep in bankless lore. I'd say there was a time where we really focus on this thing called Settlement Assurances and also public goods. I wrote an article called Settlement Assurances and the Global Public Goods Thesis. All of these things kind of tie in together. So this is actually a really deep part of bankless philosophy, I'd say the importance of Settlement Assurances. Back in 2017, when I was getting into crypto, people were still getting confused about litecoin versus bitcoin. Like, litecoin is bitcoin, but faster and better.
01:09:18.400 - 01:09:59.462, Speaker B: Yeah, litecoin's blocks are four times faster. But the important thing about crypto is that when you make a transaction, it is final, it is in the blockchain. And so, like, yeah, you could make a bitcoin and you could spin up. So it has 10 trillion transactions a minute. Is that what makes blockchains faster, though? Can you just have faster blocks to make transactions more final in the world of Settlement insurances, the answer is no. And so, because Bitcoin's proof of work, its hash rate is like hundreds of times faster than Litecoin. Technically, even though Bitcoin is a slow blockchain, its transaction finality is the fastest that it's out of any blockchain that exists.
01:09:59.462 - 01:10:44.218, Speaker B: At least that's when I wrote it back in 2017. Ethereum proof of stake and finality is actually now the new fastest because it takes six minutes to have billions of dollars of settlement assurances. So you know that your transaction is in the chain or else there will be tens of billions of dollars of Ether burned if your transaction gets unwound. So Litecoin can't hold a candle to Bitcoin's finality just because it has faster blocks. Now, settlement insurances also goes back to the Trad payment rails, right? Except in the Trad payment rails, you get settlement insurances from the court system. So to undo a transaction in the Trad world, you can go and undo an ACH transfer at any arbitrary time. There is no finality in the trad world.
01:10:44.218 - 01:11:11.550, Speaker B: There's finality in the crypto world because we operate by crypto economics. So the idea of settlement assurances allows you to have property rights assurances. This goes back to the idea of property rights. The assurances that your property is yours and is not going to be taken from you because of settlement assurances. I've written an article about this. I gave a talk at Ethereum about this in 2019 and then we did an episode on this. It's like episode five or episode seven of the Bankless podcast.
01:11:11.550 - 01:11:29.334, Speaker B: And so, actually, I just went into the discord just now and just wrote this answer out to taz you because I was so excited that they asked it, which is how you know that I didn't actually ask it myself. And I just dumped all that stuff in there into the discord because it's such an important part of how we.
01:11:29.372 - 01:11:44.794, Speaker A: Think it really is. It really gets to the base layer of why we're here. And the entire thesis for crypto, I think, like, settlement assurances is really the economic weight that is cementing your particular transaction on chain.
01:11:44.842 - 01:11:45.760, Speaker B: Right. Property.
01:11:46.530 - 01:12:23.530, Speaker A: Yeah, it's all about economic weight. And what's interesting, too, is you can compare it across different chains, of course, but the comparison that you did with nation states and you say, like, a transaction is kind of settled by the court system, can be undone by the court system. There's even a layer under that. Right. If your court system is functioning and democratic and there's a set of rules yeah, that makes sense. What happens if your government becomes corrupt? What happens if you are a political dissident against an authoritarian government leadership? Well, not very difficult for them to unsettle your settled transaction. There's no finality, really.
01:12:23.530 - 01:12:29.354, Speaker A: And so what are the settlement assurances of a nation state? It comes down to, like, who's in.
01:12:29.392 - 01:12:32.438, Speaker B: Power, who's in control, who's got the guns.
01:12:32.534 - 01:12:56.782, Speaker A: Yeah, hopefully there's a constitution that kind of prohibits the people with guns from being able to do certain things. And the societies govern that way. But what if that fractures? What if that decays? The cool thing about crypto is it's all kind of economic weight. We don't need to have guns. And so it provides a different I might say better for the digital realm. It is a better settlement assurance. It's also worldwide.
01:12:56.782 - 01:13:20.538, Speaker A: Anyone with an Internet system can access it. One of the books I can't think of the name name escapes me right now. But it's an economic book around the growth of economies and it talks about how property rights are the best predictor. Like the certainty and the stability of your property rights system is actually the predictor of a nation state's success. What did America get really right?
01:13:20.624 - 01:13:23.030, Speaker B: Hernando DeSoto's, mysterious capital.
01:13:23.190 - 01:13:44.478, Speaker A: Yeah, that's it. What did America really get right? In the early days and by the way, it took a long time for them to get here is Property Rights Settlement Assurances. And once they got that right man, the economy was humming. People wanted to bring their businesses here. Entrepreneurs wanted to open up shop. People wanted to bring their capital to the country. The economic network with better settlement assurances.
01:13:44.478 - 01:13:47.798, Speaker A: My God, I feel like we have another podcast in US. David, was it?
01:13:47.804 - 01:13:49.880, Speaker B: Wait. Talk about you that asked the question.
01:13:53.290 - 01:14:09.466, Speaker A: You caught me. There we go. We should go on to the next but maybe we need to dig deep in the archives and pull back some bankless content for kind of the new generation. Yeah. Bankless lore. Let's get to this next question from Zero X nader. This was not me asking the question.
01:14:09.466 - 01:14:14.698, Speaker A: What are some of the biggest differences between this bear market and 2019? What would you say to that?
01:14:14.784 - 01:14:27.374, Speaker B: Yeah, so in 2018 or 19, we were creating DFI for the very first time. In fact, we were coming up with a word for it. Like uniswap was created. Compound was created. Maker. Dow was growing. That was what was going.
01:14:27.374 - 01:14:36.942, Speaker B: And it was a zero to one moment. It was like we actually going into the last bear market. We really didn't know what Ethereum was good for. We had to defend smart contracts.
01:14:37.006 - 01:14:38.686, Speaker A: Just scam ICOs.
01:14:38.718 - 01:14:42.326, Speaker B: That's all it was. Yeah. And we also had smart contracts that blew up.
01:14:42.348 - 01:14:42.582, Speaker A: Right.
01:14:42.636 - 01:15:04.766, Speaker B: So we had to defend Ethereum even though we had nothing to stand on as a foundation. We had just an idea to protect. That idea was correct because the next bull market happened was a DeFi bull market. DeFi summer NFTs, blah, blah, blah, blah. So here we are in this bear market. What are we building now? Much more sophisticated financial infrastructure. Layer two, bridges for reduced stuff.
01:15:04.766 - 01:15:24.674, Speaker B: Layer twos and bridges. And then USDC is huge. The market cap of Ether is massive. I say what is being built now? There's direction and purpose. And we know what needs to get built. The main difference in this bear market is we know what we're doing. Last time, we did not know what we're doing.
01:15:24.674 - 01:15:53.630, Speaker B: Investment in this ecosystem is much more directional and with intent and purpose, with a vision, with a North Star, rather than just like, wandering around in the dark. So in addition to that, we also have ten to 100 times the amount of capital. Like, we almost ran out of money last time. And so those are the main differences. Crypto is big gone. The most frustrating thing about and I picked up on this, I think really early in my crypto career, there's like, oh, Bitcoin, Ether, it could go to zero. You could lose everything that you put in.
01:15:53.630 - 01:16:04.254, Speaker B: And people were saying that back in 2017 about Bitcoin, and I was like, they can't actually go to zero. That's the point. And we stopped saying that last bear market.
01:16:04.452 - 01:16:14.402, Speaker A: Or you could say if you say that Bitcoin or Ether could go to zero, then you could also say that about any other asset on the planet, the dollar could go to zero and.
01:16:14.456 - 01:16:16.626, Speaker B: Gold go to zero, right?
01:16:16.808 - 01:16:20.614, Speaker A: Sure, it's all possible. We're just talking about probabilities here, right?
01:16:20.652 - 01:16:41.260, Speaker B: And so this bear market, no one's saying these words. And so everyone now and this is what it means to be priced in, right? Ether was $80 at the bottom, $80 to $300, and now it's $1000 to $2,000. No one's pricing in, like, going to zero anymore for Bitcoin and Ether. And that's producing much more stable foundation for people.
01:16:42.270 - 01:16:53.066, Speaker A: 2018 was existential. I think of it as kind of a startup. Like, Bitcoin did have Product Market Fit for some things, but Ethereum smart contract DFI didn't have we were doing Twitter.
01:16:53.098 - 01:16:54.850, Speaker B: On the layer one. Could you imagine?
01:16:55.270 - 01:17:22.598, Speaker A: It was a zero to one moment? It was existential. It's like you were a company pre product market fit. And that is the hardest thing to do in an early stage company. And most companies fail right there. Like, most companies die, most things die, most networks, most ideas die because they don't actually achieve product market fit. Now, I have complete certainty that Ethereum smart contracts have product market fit. We've already done the zero to one.
01:17:22.598 - 01:17:28.586, Speaker A: The only question is, how big is it going to get? Now we're just assessing what the total addressable market for this thing is.
01:17:28.608 - 01:17:33.746, Speaker B: Is it a ten X from here or 100 X from here? How many zeros we got left? Is the biggest.
01:17:33.798 - 01:18:10.106, Speaker A: How many zeros we got left? How much of the financial pie are these crypto networks going to be able to eat? I happen to think it's going to be a lot of them. I happen to think it's going to be kind of dominant. I think we end with, I don't know, man, I haven't given out numbers in a long time, but we're going to be tens of trillions of dollars in total crypto market cap. Remember at the intro, we say that every week. We're at 1 trillion right now, 30 to 50 trillion. That seems within sight to me. Now, where do you distribute that? There's a lot of questions, like how much goes to Ethan bitcoin? How much go to kind of the app layer? Don't have all the answers to that.
01:18:10.106 - 01:18:32.126, Speaker A: But I do think that this entire new financial system will be denominated in the base money systems of their respective dominant blockchains. So that's pretty bullish for assets like ether. Anyway, totally different world in 2019. I wasn't sure if we're going to make it. Now it's just a waiting game while we build. There we go. Got some takes of the week.
01:18:32.126 - 01:18:42.050, Speaker A: David, here is the first take. I don't know if you saw this. I'm just going to play this for you. This is from Fred Wilson. You remember Fred. Unsquare Ventures. All right, this is what he says.
01:18:42.050 - 01:18:51.702, Speaker A: The context here is I think he was taken in front of some sort of government body. There's Barry Silbert in the picture here and asking about crypto. And here's what he says.
01:18:51.836 - 01:19:18.170, Speaker B: The lesson from the Internet is anything that China bans invest in. And that's a joke. But the US. Allows Google to operate here, allows Twitter to operate here, allows Bitcoin to operate here, allows Facebook to operate here. Chinese government doesn't allow any of those companies to operate the way they operate in this country or at all. It's about freedom, ultimately.
01:19:18.330 - 01:20:04.734, Speaker A: I just love that take. The lesson from the Internet is anything that China bans invest in. Of course, China has banned crypto in the past. I would broaden this, though, beyond China. Anything that the establishment is worried about or wants to ban, invest in that thing. This is part of a post where Fred Wilson recently responded in one of his quarterly calls at Unisquare Ventures, which is a VC fund that he operates. If they were going to respond to the regulatory pressure on web3 by divesting, basically cutting back their investments in Web three, and this is what he said, when they want to shut it down, I say double down.
01:20:04.734 - 01:20:16.160, Speaker A: So to Fred Wilson, it is bullish that the authoritarians and the institutions that are threatened by this asset class want to shut it down. What do you think about that?
01:20:17.010 - 01:20:26.658, Speaker B: I love the line. Yeah. I mean, buy blood. It's the same thing saying buy when there's blood in the streets. It's like, yeah. So we're getting choked out, starting to bleed.
01:20:26.834 - 01:20:30.790, Speaker A: You should probably buy. Choke me harder, daddy.
01:20:32.730 - 01:20:38.290, Speaker B: Okay. All right, Ryan, I got a take for this is something I learned this last week here at Zuzalu.
01:20:38.370 - 01:20:38.806, Speaker A: Okay.
01:20:38.908 - 01:20:41.750, Speaker B: Have you heard of the millennial pause?
01:20:42.250 - 01:20:47.258, Speaker A: I didn't know this was a thing until I saw this in the agenda, but why don't you explain this?
01:20:47.344 - 01:21:17.074, Speaker B: Okay, so the millennial pause is like when you're on Instagram or TikTok and you're recording yourself because you're about to post a TikTok or a story or something. The Millennial Pause is this very brief moment right, when they hit the record button and they wait for it to start recording, and then they take a breath and say, hey, guys, it's me. I'm on this TikTok video, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then it's called the Millennial Pause because the Zoomers are also on TikTok, also on Instagram, because they're of age now, and they're like, Why the fuck do you guys do wait?
01:21:17.112 - 01:21:18.754, Speaker A: Can we see an example of this? Yeah.
01:21:18.792 - 01:21:28.486, Speaker B: Okay, open up the link. We got Taylor Swift doing the millennial pod. Okay, so it's very, very subtle and very, very brief. So we have to pay attention to the very, very first moments of this video.
01:21:28.588 - 01:21:32.778, Speaker A: And this is every time a millennial basically records themselves doing yeah, doing a.
01:21:32.784 - 01:21:34.582, Speaker B: Selfie video, talking to the camera.
01:21:34.646 - 01:21:41.658, Speaker A: All right. Here's. Taylor Swift. Let me see if you can spot it. It's that pause right there.
01:21:41.744 - 01:21:47.630, Speaker B: It's just a hesitation when the video starts. They're not already talking. They're waiting for the video to start.
01:21:47.700 - 01:21:58.580, Speaker A: So when I first did that, when I first watched this, I was like, yeah, that's how you do videos. Is there another way to do video? Apparently there is. What is the contrast with gen z?
01:21:59.670 - 01:22:42.906, Speaker B: The Gen Z got the Gen Z shake, which is the equivalent to the Millennial Plus. Well, what is the Gen z shake? Shake. It's like when they hit record, they put their phone down and they continue to talk to the camera because it's like candid. And the important thing about this, why I thought this was cool, is that this comes from when millennials watch this camera and phone and Internet technology arise and go from shit to good. When we hit record previously, you would wait for the software to kick in for the recording to start, and you would need to wait for it to happen. Now, with modern iPhones and, like, Android phones, it's instantaneous, but we still wait. And so the Zoomers are calling millennials, boomers.
01:22:42.906 - 01:23:12.250, Speaker B: Because of this Millennial pause thing, we're waiting for our antiquated old technology to start recording. Okay, but the Gen Z Shake is that they hit record and then they set their phone down, and then they start talking. And so they're talking as they set the phone down, but the phone is shaking because they're setting it like they don't wait for hey, guys. They don't wait for the breath. They don't say filler words. They just go right into the conversation. So they hit record and simultaneously start talking and saying, hey, you know, when that thing happens, blah, blah, blah, blah.
01:23:13.470 - 01:23:27.484, Speaker A: I think you have to see it. You'll have seen this if you've ever watched something on TikTok. Okay, so this is the Gen Z shake, right? That was it. Do you see it?
01:23:27.522 - 01:23:51.328, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that was very exaggerated. She's doing it on purpose, but yeah, I just think it's so cool how both hardware and software that improves over time impacts the people that use it. Right. I thought that was like a very fun phenomenon that zoomers are calling millennials. Like, yeah, you just did the millennial pause. And we're like, what do you mean the millennial pause? What am I doing?
01:23:51.414 - 01:23:59.044, Speaker A: I think it is so fascinating to see how technology impacts culture and behavior. Are you going to stop doing the millennial pause or now you're going to notice it?
01:23:59.082 - 01:24:03.610, Speaker B: Do you think I'm the type of person to record selfies and post them to TikTok? Do you think I do this?
01:24:04.060 - 01:24:14.040, Speaker A: You guys should see a Bankless TikTok channel. It is nothing. There's nothing going on there because David and I suck at this. All right, that was my well, thank you for bringing that to our attention.
01:24:14.380 - 01:24:15.644, Speaker B: Now I know.
01:24:15.842 - 01:24:17.772, Speaker A: Tell me, what are you bullish on this week?
01:24:17.906 - 01:24:21.884, Speaker B: Okay, so I was on the Solana podcast, right?
01:24:21.922 - 01:24:22.076, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:24:22.098 - 01:24:43.830, Speaker B: So it's called the Validated Podcast hosted by Austin Federer. I've actually hung out with him a couple of times in real life. So we talked about the differences between Ethereum and Solana. And so I thought that was it was really cool. I made a big call to action. I talked about how Bankless came to be. A lot of it is about Bankless, right.
01:24:43.830 - 01:25:01.176, Speaker B: And how we are kind of the voice of Ethereum. And I was like, yeah. So the Salana people, the Salona community, came into the world of crypto in 2021. They didn't go through the same upbringing that the Ethereum people had in the last bear market where we were just harassed by bitcoiners and we had to.
01:25:01.198 - 01:25:03.608, Speaker A: Prove our legitimacy and prove generational difference.
01:25:03.694 - 01:25:39.424, Speaker B: It's a generational difference. They skipped that in my mind. And so they skipped over the idea of settlement assurances, which Ethereum and Bitcoiners are aligned by. They skipped over the conversations of what makes a full node and why do you need to have a full node that's easy to manage and easy to run? They skipped the conversation of what is money? And so they're coming in and then the Ethereum people are like, hey, don't use centralized chains. You pay the gas fees and you'll like it. And understanding that that's not a way to onboard new users. We just went back and forth on the philosophical differences and the upbringings of these communities.
01:25:39.424 - 01:25:54.120, Speaker B: I thought it was really good podcast. It's actually going to come out on the Bankless RSS feed soon, TM maybe this weekend. And so it will be in your inbox player as well. I asked Austin if we could release it here on Bankless, and so he said yes and sent me the file. So that'll come soon to this podcast player.
01:25:54.460 - 01:26:21.444, Speaker A: I think one thing that I think is true that I'm not sure a lot of people agree with, but I think it's true. Anyway. Is, I believe very much that Solana is good for Ethereum. I think Solana, the Solana community would probably say Ethereum is good for know it sort of came first, blah, blah, blah. But I actually think solana is good for ethereum. It's really kept Ethereum on its toes from a user experience perspective. Right.
01:26:21.444 - 01:27:08.252, Speaker A: Even like developing wallets like Phantom, which are now coming back to coming to Ethereum, right? But the prioritization of user onboarding Ethereum hasn't had that. It's been a little bit of what you've said of like, you will pay high gas fees and you'll like it, and you'll deal with our shitty UX and you'll like it, and Solana is a bit more like, hey, we need to onboard people quickly. And sometimes Ethereum will be like, but you're cutting corners. Right? But I think there's probably a healthy balance of how can you improve your UX without cutting those corners anyway. I just think that community has made Ethereum sharper as well. I don't know if everyone agrees with that, but there's a take. That's what we do on bankless takes all the time.
01:27:08.326 - 01:27:10.372, Speaker B: All right, Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:27:10.506 - 01:27:37.390, Speaker A: I'm bullish on this. This is a tweet from Ryan Berkman's on Tokenized Treasuries. I didn't know this before I actually read this tweet. Here's a fact sheet. Total value locked from zero dollars to two hundred million dollars in three and a half months. Half a dozen good competitors. The yield on Tokenized Treasuries, the future of Tokenized Treasuries right now, because interest rates are so high, is 4.75%.
01:27:37.390 - 01:28:11.432, Speaker A: You can see this in a Dune analytics, a dashboard. But the idea, David, of Tokenized T Bills actually gets me kind of excited. And I'm not the type to be excited by on chain real world assets. But we don't find this type of yield in DFI these days 4.75%. So I think if we can onboard more T bills on chain to Ethereum, this is an area of growth for us. I mean, the amount of real world assets that we have on chain is pretty low. And T bills are like pretty simple.
01:28:11.432 - 01:28:47.996, Speaker A: They should be very simple to actually deploy and put on chain. And even the idea of this, this is in Ryan's tweet here. Personally, I hope we'll see a Tokenized T bill with whitelist minting permissionless. Trading secondary one unit equals $1 with rebasing yield. This would be a USDC competitor that passes its yield on to customers, whereas USDC has 100% take rate. So imagine there was a version of USDC in quotes that was instead of dollars, tokenized T bills gives you that additional 4.75% juice.
01:28:47.996 - 01:29:18.168, Speaker A: You actually can't access that as a fungible token in the real world, can you? You can't go spend T bills at a store. You have to have dollars. But you should be able to, shouldn't you? And a Tokenized T bill would make that happen. So I didn't expect to be bullish this week on real World assets, let alone T bills. But I'm kind of weirdly bullish on the marrying of the two things. And that is why, I mean, crypto.
01:29:18.184 - 01:29:30.624, Speaker B: People love their yield, right? So it makes sense. And all capital wants to converge, and so capital will find its way naturally to Ethereum as the epicenter, the logical conclusion of where capital will go. Makes sense to me.
01:29:30.742 - 01:29:32.812, Speaker A: Have I made you bullish on it? On tokenized?
01:29:32.956 - 01:29:34.544, Speaker B: I'm always bullish on Real World.
01:29:34.582 - 01:29:35.840, Speaker A: You're never not bullish on that.
01:29:35.910 - 01:29:37.468, Speaker B: I was always bullish on real assets.
01:29:37.564 - 01:29:38.544, Speaker A: Meme of the week. What do we got?
01:29:38.582 - 01:30:02.136, Speaker B: This before was cool. So it was edcon. This last week it was the Ethereum Educational Convention conference. And last year so in this photo, this is how it started. How it's going? Kind of meme. This is an Instagram account of this man named Mickey, who is probably going to be the prime minister of Montenegro. Elections are in two weeks.
01:30:02.136 - 01:30:18.528, Speaker B: Last year, Vital got a Montenegro passport, and this year at Edcon, he also got this traditional Montenegrin like Garb. I'm not even going to be able to try and explain this for the podcast listeners, but the guy is looking how would you even describe that?
01:30:18.694 - 01:30:24.496, Speaker A: I don't know. Without misplacing my cultures here, I actually don't know what this looks like.
01:30:24.598 - 01:30:38.560, Speaker B: Yeah. Anyways, so Mickey this is actually a story about Mickey, the incoming potential prime minister of Montenegro. I don't have time to explain it in this one meme, because this is just the meme of the week. But it's bullish.
01:30:38.720 - 01:30:39.792, Speaker A: It's bullish crypto.
01:30:39.856 - 01:31:01.084, Speaker B: It's both crypto and making Montenegro like, natively a crypto country. So kind of like El Salvador. Like official bitcoin is like the official currency of El Salvador. That except it makes sense in Montenegro. Kind of like that, but with plans that actually make sense.
01:31:01.282 - 01:31:16.392, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, that would be bullish if that would be something like that. Very good. Well, guys, thank you for being with us on the roll up again this week. Risks and disclaimers. Of course, none of this has been financial advice. What do we say every week? Crypto is risky, so is Bitcoin.
01:31:16.392 - 01:31:25.010, Speaker A: So is ether. So is five. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
