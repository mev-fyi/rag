00:00:00.090 - 00:00:11.294, Speaker A: And this is a 36 hours long endeavor of people trying to figure out reading SBFT leaves as to what the hell he is doing with this tweet thread while he does this.
00:00:11.332 - 00:00:19.006, Speaker B: David, bankless nation. Happy third week of November, David. What time is it?
00:00:19.028 - 00:00:27.174, Speaker A: Oh, Ryan, it's the Friday bankless weekly roll up. And Ryan, I have never been so intimidated by an agenda that we have to get through today.
00:00:27.292 - 00:00:28.722, Speaker B: Is it the content or the length?
00:00:28.786 - 00:00:35.734, Speaker A: It's a little bit of both. Definitely. The content. The craziness of the content. Yet, Ryan, we persevere into the frontier nonetheless with content.
00:00:35.772 - 00:00:40.170, Speaker B: I know we do. You know what happens when you plug in bankless and Twitter in the search box right now?
00:00:40.240 - 00:00:41.020, Speaker A: Oh, my.
00:00:41.630 - 00:00:48.780, Speaker B: Bankless crying is number one. What a week. What a roll up. How are you feeling this week, David? Feeling a bit.
00:00:49.710 - 00:00:50.860, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:00:51.710 - 00:01:00.320, Speaker B: If the theme last week for you was like, this sucks, I'm disappointed. What's the theme this week? What's David Hoffman feeling like?
00:01:00.770 - 00:01:25.618, Speaker A: The theme this week, I think, is good riddance. Good riddance, for sure. Because this is turning out to not just be like, oh, another drama in the crypto world. No, this is like, one of the greatest frauds of all time. And I think, for better or worse, we're going to be able to move forward from this in a progressive way. So, yeah, if there's a theme of the week, it's good riddance.
00:01:25.714 - 00:01:43.558, Speaker B: Well, you got to admit, when SBF does something, he does it big. He goes all out. Not only the number two exchange, but also maybe the number one fraud of all time when the dust settles. But topics of the week, we're going to be talking about three things. Number one, SBF. Number two, FTX. Number three, Alameda.
00:01:43.558 - 00:01:45.594, Speaker B: I mean, it's pretty much the agenda, right?
00:01:45.712 - 00:01:52.846, Speaker A: That's the whole thing. There are some other things that happened this week, but we're going to have to wait until the second half of the episode to hear all the normal things that went on.
00:01:52.948 - 00:02:19.538, Speaker B: The high level is the fraud that is SBF continues to get bigger. This is kind of Enron. This is Theranos. This is Bernie Madoff. We got it all, a little bit of it all. So we're going to talk a little bit about how bad the contagion was. David, before we get into the episode, we have a message from our friends and sponsors at Infura, and I think there's really good news coming out of infura, because we need to build this entire space on decentralized rails.
00:02:19.538 - 00:02:27.018, Speaker B: I think this is what we've learned here again recently, it's been reinforced, and Infuria is taking a big step towards that. What are they up to?
00:02:27.104 - 00:03:13.994, Speaker A: So Infuria is calling for all web3 infrastructure providers who are interested in being a part of this new decentralized infrastructure network that Infura wants to lead. So they need help. They need you to help foster their decentralized infrastructure ecosystem because they are working on decentralizing a very important part of the Ethereum stack. The RPC endpoints, the nodes and all of this stuff. And so this is a pretty big centralization vector of Ethereum and overall, any chain how user wallets and just broadcast transactions and spinning up nodes. And so this has always been a moderate problem in the ethereum ecosystem, and inferior is tackling that centralization problem head on and also needs help decentralizing their own stack. And they want you to take a part in that.
00:03:13.994 - 00:03:24.794, Speaker A: So there's a link in the show notes, bankless Cc slash infura for you to sign up for the early access of their new decentralized network infrastructure. So go do that. Go click that link.
00:03:24.912 - 00:03:38.930, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really cool. We all use infura, whether you know it day to day. Yeah, behind metamask, behind a lot of the wallets that we use. Not the only one, but is one of the larger ones for sure. All right, David, let's get to the markets. Bitcoin, what are we looking at on the week after this two week disaster here?
00:03:39.000 - 00:03:49.382, Speaker A: Yeah, bitcoin is down on the week, down 5%. $500 down 5% to where it is now at $16,600. Cool.
00:03:49.516 - 00:03:50.534, Speaker B: We expected it down.
00:03:50.572 - 00:04:00.060, Speaker A: How about ETH down again, 8% on 8%. So bitcoin down 5%. ETH down 8%. Ether started the week at 1320, currently at 1270.
00:04:00.590 - 00:04:02.074, Speaker B: 1270. You know what?
00:04:02.192 - 00:04:06.010, Speaker A: No, it's down 1210. My numbers are wrong.
00:04:06.160 - 00:04:27.726, Speaker B: Okay. But 1210, 1270, it's been hovering around 1200. I actually am surprised that it's as high as it is. Yeah, some people are saying, oh, that's low, right? No. Given what just happened, like the nuclear bomb that just detonated in crypto and we're in the 1200 range. I don't know if that makes me weirdly bullish.
00:04:27.838 - 00:04:34.846, Speaker A: Yeah, it doesn't seem to want to go down anymore. Is this down resistance?
00:04:35.038 - 00:04:56.262, Speaker B: Maybe we'll talk a little bit about why that is when we get to some of Chris Berninsky's takes. But park that in your mind. Bankless listener, why is ETH not down more than you might think? It should be given the sentiment would. Yes. By the time you hear this, we'll have triple digit ETH, I'm sure, tomorrow morning ETH. Bitcoin. What are we looking at in the ratio?
00:04:56.326 - 00:05:00.570, Speaker A: And ratio is down just a little bit. It's down from zero 75 to zero 72.
00:05:00.720 - 00:05:01.402, Speaker B: There we go.
00:05:01.456 - 00:05:06.906, Speaker A: Crypto market cap, down from 920,000,000,000 to 860,000,000,000. Surprise.
00:05:06.938 - 00:05:12.238, Speaker B: 860. Do you remember the lows of. Well, the highs of the last bull market?
00:05:12.324 - 00:05:18.306, Speaker A: Highs of last. Oh, the 2017 bull market. Yeah, it looks like it's kind of. We're a little bit above that right now, but not much.
00:05:18.328 - 00:05:42.662, Speaker B: The highs of the last in January 2018 were about $760,000,000,000. And we're just above the highs, but not very much above the highs. That's interesting to take note of. David, let's do some takes on the crypto markets right now. First, maybe a quick scan by bitcoin miners. I don't think very often about bitcoin miners, but they're in a lot of pain right now. What's this tweet showing us?
00:05:42.716 - 00:06:07.780, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's a tweet that's showing a new metric that this guy created. He says, a free open source indicator, which tracks on chain data to highlight when bitcoin miners are selling more of their reserves than usual. So I'm guessing the inputs to this indicator are the bitcoin price and probably average electrical cost to produce a single bitcoin. And according to this indicator, we are bad. It's bad.
00:06:08.230 - 00:06:09.278, Speaker B: They're not profitable.
00:06:09.374 - 00:06:25.030, Speaker A: Bitcoin miners are making less underwater in terms of revenue, a significant percentage of them. I mean, this is just like, kind of a global average, but it's basically saying that it's really hard to be a profitable bitcoin miner right now. So they are running on reserves, which means they are selling.
00:06:25.530 - 00:06:41.222, Speaker B: I've always wondered about this. So if you're bullish on bitcoin, like the asset itself, why would you try to get exposure in bitcoin mining facilities and bitcoin mining companies? Why would that make sense relative to just, like, purchasing bitcoin OTC?
00:06:41.366 - 00:06:59.234, Speaker A: Yeah, because a single ASIC, in theory, a single ASIC is meant to be, like a discount on a bitcoin over the long term. So if you buy an ASIC, if you spend like, $100 on an ASIC, you get like $150 worth of bitcoin over the long term. But a ton of variables go into that.
00:06:59.432 - 00:07:15.314, Speaker B: But do you, though? You have energy costs, you have ASIC degradation, obsolescence, degradation. There's all sorts of other things. Anyway, I've not understood it, but I'm not in that space. What is Dylan Leclaire showing us on bitcoin miners? What's this chart?
00:07:15.362 - 00:07:24.154, Speaker A: Yeah, these are just like the equity prices of all these bitcoin mining companies. Negative 10%, negative 9%, negative 6%, negative 13%, negative nine.
00:07:24.192 - 00:07:25.626, Speaker B: These, like, publicly traded companies. Yeah.
00:07:25.648 - 00:07:29.754, Speaker A: Publicly traded bitcoin miner companies. Yeah. All down bad. All down.
00:07:29.792 - 00:07:48.798, Speaker B: Riot iron, bitf, Mara hunt s dig hive. Interesting. Berninsky's take on the bottom. All right, give us some context for Berninsky because I know you had a conversation with him a little bit earlier in the week on Twitter, which actually, that entire conversation, I think it's like a 30, 40 minutes long conversation.
00:07:48.894 - 00:07:49.602, Speaker A: Yeah, 50 minutes.
00:07:49.656 - 00:08:04.294, Speaker B: 50 minutes is available to bankless premium members right now on the RSS feed. We're not releasing that to the regular RSS feed. Chris wanted to keep that a little more private. So just bankless premium members only have access to that. And David, I haven't listened to it.
00:08:04.332 - 00:08:06.226, Speaker A: Yet, but you're missing out, man. You're missing.
00:08:06.258 - 00:08:40.926, Speaker B: No, no, I'm not going to be, because I'm scheduling this for my weekend. I'm going to be listening because you know why? Well, it's probably relaxing because I think Chris is flipped. Bullish is my understanding, my sentiment, and I just want to provide some context for this individual. First of all, this is the individual, probably second to Andreas Antonopoulos, but I actually count him first. That got me into crypto. I read his original book on crypto assets. Where did he publish that? 2016, 2017? Something like this got me really excited about the world beyond bitcoin.
00:08:40.926 - 00:09:09.430, Speaker B: Not only that, Chris, he's a VC. He's got ethics that I align with in this space. I respect him a lot. He developed a lot of the original kind of on chain analysis that we see today, and others have carried that forward further. So he's got that piece then he's a VC, but somehow he finds a way to call the markets fairly well. And he does it in a different way, not as like a trader. So different than an Arthur Hayes.
00:09:09.430 - 00:09:29.346, Speaker B: All right. Much, much different than somebody doing ta. He does it based on kind of long term, I don't know, fundamentals. It's this mix of a thesis, fundamentals, and actually observing the space. And he has been bearish on crypto for over a year.
00:09:29.448 - 00:09:49.474, Speaker A: He turned bearish sometime after May of 2021, and he was bearish and he was bearish even as we hit new all time highs. And he was, like, saying, this is too contrarian. Yeah, he was big contrarian. And he, in my opinion, has just been proven right in fantastic fashion.
00:09:49.522 - 00:10:14.154, Speaker B: Well, he was the anti super cycle. You know, there's this whole, like, super cycle crypto assets never going to go fully down again. And, no, that's Bs. And he actually got more and more. I don't want to say shrill about it, but, like, loud about it to the extent that others in the space just start, like, in some of my circles that I hang out with start to get annoyed at him. Why is Chris always bearish?
00:10:14.202 - 00:10:17.178, Speaker A: Why is he just Chris bearish again?
00:10:17.284 - 00:10:31.702, Speaker B: Yeah, I was not annoyed by that at all. It's just like, it's his take. And I know Chris is not, like, thinking he's trying to manipulate markets. Just. I think he actually believes it. Anyway, give us the context for the tweet that we're looking at and what Chris's take on the markets is right now.
00:10:31.756 - 00:11:12.740, Speaker A: Yeah. So Chris tweets out, it may be a crawl upwards, but I still think the capitulation bottom is in. And so as a result of all of this FTX drama, as a result of all the liquidations, Chris is saying that that was the signal that he's been looking for to confirm to him that the bottom is in. And I remember him tweeting out after the three arrows capital liquidation and that event, and he tweeted out something along the lines of, the Lehman of crypto is out there lingering. I was like, in my mind, I was like, Chris is being bearish. Yeah. How can we go down even more than.
00:11:12.740 - 00:11:17.102, Speaker A: And then. But he called it, man. He called it just off of his gut instincts.
00:11:17.166 - 00:11:18.542, Speaker B: There's literally a Lehman out there.
00:11:18.616 - 00:11:31.626, Speaker A: Yeah. And there was literally a Lehman out there. It was FTX and Alameda. They just found a creative way to plug the hole temporarily. But that Lehman has been discovered. We are now dealing with that contagion. And now Chris is.
00:11:31.626 - 00:11:47.950, Speaker A: One of the conversations that we had in the Twitter spaces was that he just can't find any more big sellers. Genesis is the one that comes to mind in the moment, but we are watching that play out as we speak, particularly.
00:11:48.850 - 00:11:58.814, Speaker B: Again, I haven't listened to the episode, so you correct me if I'm wrong, but particularly, he probably means the large cap assets that don't have unlocks like bitcoin and ETH.
00:11:58.862 - 00:11:59.374, Speaker A: Yeah, bitcoin.
00:11:59.422 - 00:12:02.466, Speaker B: Who's going to sell bitcoin and ETH at this point.
00:12:02.568 - 00:12:16.434, Speaker A: Yeah. So just to kind of preview the conversation with him, he talked a lot about these indicators that he uses and actually not tease, I'll not say which ones those are. So you have to read the article that comes out of bankless today. But like bitcoin indicators ETH.
00:12:16.482 - 00:12:17.734, Speaker B: Oh, we're doing an article on this, too.
00:12:17.772 - 00:12:48.574, Speaker A: Yes. This should also come out as an article on the newsletter comparing and contrasting the turning points of the last bear market. Like whatever four sellers we have last. But then also we talked about the crypto markets showing strength. We talked about the merge and how the ether price is up 50% from the May lows where bitcoin is down 10%, and talked about how he's calling the bottom on crypto also with equities. And so equities are down 80%, a comparable amount to the.com bubble.
00:12:48.574 - 00:13:11.734, Speaker A: But these equities, in contrast to the.com bubble, are real money printing organizations. And so he thinks that that's oversold. And then also inflation is turning over. And so these aligning of the stars is like convincing him that the bottom is in. But all of those details and more are available in the bankless newsletter. And then if you are a premium subscriber, you get access to the audio for the Twitter space as well.
00:13:11.852 - 00:13:25.710, Speaker B: You are such a tease. What a tease you are. So is Chris Berninsky here. Here's his new pin tweet, bullish from near the bottom. Hope to see you all at 10 trillion. Remember, David and I just read out we're at 850,000,000,000, 10 trillion. Little ten x here.
00:13:25.710 - 00:13:27.838, Speaker B: He's expecting. Yeah, and we'll see you there.
00:13:27.924 - 00:13:35.940, Speaker A: This is a tweet that I retweeted and I said, Chris Berniski flipping bullish. It's like a changing of the seasons for crypto and it makes me so happy.
00:13:36.390 - 00:14:02.774, Speaker B: I actually think that's true. All right, Hayden Adams, this is some interesting stats coming out of the FTX collapse of CFI debacle. I tweeted this out early in the week because I think it's true. CFI dead. CFI dead. Like right now, when you talk about centralized finance beyond kind of exchanges, right, centralized lending and borrowing, it's down bad. They're not all going to go out of business and go bankrupt.
00:14:02.774 - 00:14:19.390, Speaker B: But who's trusting them at this point? The question is, who are the beneficiaries of that trust? Does it completely flow out of crypto and back in traditional finance or does it go somewhere else? I think Hayden is making the case that maybe it's going somewhere else. And we're starting to see some numbers. What tweet are we looking at here?
00:14:19.460 - 00:14:42.466, Speaker A: Yeah, so Hayden says Dex starting to replace centralized exchange, question mark, total ETH, USD volume. And then he lists off the three biggest exchanges, finance, uniswap and Coinbase. Finance coming in at 1.9 billion, uniswap at 1.1 billion in volume and Coinbase at 0.6 billion. So Uniswap has now taken the spot of the number two most liquid exchange for ETH USD.
00:14:42.578 - 00:14:44.422, Speaker B: David, that makes me so damn happy.
00:14:44.476 - 00:14:44.950, Speaker A: Very happy.
00:14:45.020 - 00:14:49.234, Speaker B: Do you know why you don't have to give your private keys to uniswap in order to make a trade?
00:14:49.362 - 00:14:50.290, Speaker A: Self custody.
00:14:50.370 - 00:15:07.498, Speaker B: No one can stop it. It's uncensorable. This is DFI. These are the types of exchanges we need to base this entire system on. All right, well, we've got a lot more to talk about. I just almost clicked over almost all about FTX, the contagion, the Genesis halts. Genesis is a large trading firm.
00:15:07.498 - 00:15:19.294, Speaker B: We got to talk about that. They halted withdrawals. Also talking about mainstream media where they dropped a ball. So much more to cover. We'll be right back, but first we want to tell you about the sponsors that will help you go bankless.
00:15:19.422 - 00:16:08.446, Speaker A: Sequence is the all in one developer platform you need to build web3 games and applications for your users. Sequence is a smart wallet and it's the easiest, most intuitive onboarding your users will ever experience and comes with all the features users need to feel empowered in the web3 world.

00:16:58.574 - 00:17:06.680, Speaker A: So in order to experience the social layer of web3, go to diesel.com and claim your username. That's Deso.com.
00:17:08.090 - 00:17:17.222, Speaker B: All right, Dave, we got to start here with this crazy tweet thread from SB. What? Yeah, this was November 13, so this is, was this Monday night?
00:17:17.276 - 00:17:17.606, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:17:17.628 - 00:17:24.620, Speaker B: All the days are a blur. There was the 14th Monday evening, and SBF just tweets out what?
00:17:25.150 - 00:17:58.466, Speaker A: What? So SBF always writes a thread like he's a thread or it's kind of his meme. And so he always writes these threads with like one parenthes, kind of like a bullet fashion. Like one parenthes, two parenthes just to label as threads. My first tweet, my second tweet, common thread etiquette, to do that. This one was weird because he goes, one parentheses, what? And then followed by two parenthes, h, the letter H, followed by three parentheses, a. And he is tweeting these out with hours of space.
00:17:58.568 - 00:17:59.774, Speaker B: Not in rapid fashion.
00:17:59.822 - 00:18:06.242, Speaker A: Not in rapid fashion. You're supposed when you write a thread, you write all the tweets, and then you send them all at once so that people can go through the thread.
00:18:06.306 - 00:18:07.606, Speaker B: Like a normal person does.
00:18:07.628 - 00:18:43.586, Speaker A: Like a normal goddamn person. So what he does is he goes, one parentheses, what? Waits 2 hours, 3 hours, and then goes two parentheses, h, the letter h, three parentheses, 3 hours later, a. And then he ends up spelling over the course of like a 24 hours period, what happened over like ten tweets. And then the 10th, it goes in parentheses, not legal advice, not financial advice. This is as I remember it, my memory might be faulty in parts. And then eleven, I'll get to what happened. But for now, let's talk about where we are today.
00:18:43.586 - 00:18:54.162, Speaker A: And this is a 36 hours long endeavor of people trying to figure out reading SBFT leaves of what the hell he is doing with this tweet thread.
00:18:54.306 - 00:19:10.766, Speaker B: Does this, David, who the fuck does this? Who does this? Why would you do this? Is he trying to get attention? Is he just like, toying with us? He stole like ten to $16 billion worth of our money by our being.
00:19:10.788 - 00:19:12.634, Speaker A: A meme lord on Twitter. Dude.
00:19:12.762 - 00:19:20.800, Speaker B: Why? I had thought another thing a normal person would do is like, here's my Twitter account. Give it to the.
00:19:23.330 - 00:19:24.410, Speaker A: Handcuffs.
00:19:24.570 - 00:19:26.690, Speaker B: No, this is him tweeting this out.
00:19:26.760 - 00:19:27.250, Speaker A: Some people.
00:19:27.320 - 00:19:38.486, Speaker B: Do you hear some of the early speculation? There's always conspiracy theories around this, that he was, like, tweeting out some sort of code thing. Dead man switch. Something that would unlock. I don't know.
00:19:38.588 - 00:19:39.382, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:19:39.516 - 00:19:40.680, Speaker B: I don't even know what.
00:19:41.850 - 00:19:45.814, Speaker A: Let's let crypto Twitter run its imagination as to what he was doing.
00:19:46.012 - 00:19:58.582, Speaker B: But it's more than what happened and more than tweet number ten. Is the rest of this thread worth reading? He goes through eleven to 21. Is there anything here that we really care about? 18 says, truth and beauty.
00:19:58.646 - 00:20:14.578, Speaker A: What? It's all weird, man. And he says a lot. And everyone is like, kobe is like, dude, shut the f up until you tell us how you lost $10 billion. Everyone is saying, dude, just stop. Just shut the hell up. Just like, go away.
00:20:14.664 - 00:20:15.378, Speaker B: 24.
00:20:15.464 - 00:20:34.150, Speaker A: He's saying a lot. Yeah. The other conspiracy was that he's going for an insanity plea. He's like, I'm just going to be insane on Twitter so I can plead insanity later. And then I remember Jake Shravinsky was like, you don't get to plead insanity for becoming insane after you commit the crime.
00:20:34.890 - 00:20:37.538, Speaker B: Those lawyers, they'll get you on the technicalities.
00:20:37.634 - 00:20:43.734, Speaker A: Okay, so this is not the most insane thing that he did, right? Did you see the Vox article?
00:20:43.862 - 00:20:46.074, Speaker B: I saw some of art.
00:20:46.112 - 00:20:46.682, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:20:46.736 - 00:21:21.026, Speaker B: Okay, before we get to the Vox article, there's a theory of ego. There's a theory of insanity. I've also read a lot about pharmacological influence, amphetamine use in this whole scenario. In fact, the weightless Ron guy did a whole post about this, and there's a lot of evidence that not only SBF, but the entire team was on some sort of combination of amphetamines. I'm not talking about meth. I'm probably talking about Adderall. Yeah, adderall.
00:21:21.058 - 00:21:23.606, Speaker A: And stronger versions of Adderall, basically.
00:21:23.708 - 00:21:31.722, Speaker B: And maybe cocktails of all of the above. And so there can be side effects with meth. Sorry, with meth. Again, they're not.
00:21:31.776 - 00:21:33.094, Speaker A: There are side effects with meth.
00:21:33.142 - 00:21:53.034, Speaker B: Yes. Don't do meth. Kids. Amphetamines, though, which can increase your proclivity to shopping sprees and gambling and risk seeking type behavior. And it doesn't have to turn you into an all out gambler. But it can kind of move the risk curve even a little bit. And you have to imagine something like SBF.
00:21:53.034 - 00:22:25.210, Speaker B: He's a trader in cryptocurrency. He already is far alongside podcasts. Well, that's the other thing. But he's already pretty far on the right side of the risk curve in terms of the 1% of the population who engages in this type of risk seeking behavior. If you're on this sort of drug influence, maybe it moves you even further on the side of riskiness. So could that have been a factor? Is that something, do you think he's even trying to push as a legal defense?
00:22:25.790 - 00:23:03.302, Speaker A: I have no idea. I don't think anyone can think that they can step into the mind of SBF. But also, just to double down on that point, all of that stuff is true. And then also imagine having your gang of similarly aged cronies who are also engaging in that behavior. Apparently, it was common at FTX for new employees. They would get, I don't know, indoctrinated into this weird cult, and they would be like, okay, here's this slew of amphetamines that you can increase performance with. And so it became a part of culture to do amphetamines when you were on fetamines all the time.
00:23:03.302 - 00:23:16.934, Speaker A: Your mind is going to get shifted, but when all of your friends are also doing that too, and that's just like the company culture that you have, you just totally lose touch with reality. That's really what's happened here with SPF. He has just completely lost touch with reality.
00:23:16.982 - 00:23:30.714, Speaker B: Yeah, and those around him, too, because let's remember, he couldn't do this alone. He had to create this kind of cult, this reality distortion field, in order to do this. Okay, now tell me about the Vox article. So is this the one with the text back and forth, or text back and forth?
00:23:30.762 - 00:23:45.220, Speaker A: Okay, so there's a reporter. Yes, there's this reporter at Vox. Kelsey Piper, I guess, is the reporter that SBF was texting with. And SBF knows that this person's a reporter for Vox. And SBF. Just Dms. This guy.
00:23:45.220 - 00:23:50.358, Speaker A: Pages and pages and pages of communications, just talking about everything.
00:23:50.444 - 00:23:52.600, Speaker B: And Kelsey's not a guy, but.
00:23:56.810 - 00:24:21.182, Speaker A: DMs. Kelsey, like, all of these things that you would just as a lawyer, would not want your client to say. Things like, the effective altruism was just like a PR move. For example, the number of incriminating things that he gave to this reporter in DMs, who then they took screenshots and then posted them into the article, is insane, man. It's absolutely.
00:24:21.316 - 00:24:39.480, Speaker B: Let's go through some of them. So Kelsey asks SBF this question. You said a lot of stuff about how you wanted to make regulations, just good ones. Was that pretty much just PR, too? And he goes, this. Yeah, just PR. F regulators, they make everything worse. They don't protect customers at all.
00:24:39.480 - 00:25:05.754, Speaker B: What? Eleven days he went on a debate, talking about regulators and how much we needed to work with them and go to the table. This is someone who is also a pathological liar. Quite clearly here he's saying to Kelsey, f. Regulators, that was all just PR. All my participation was just PR in the whole regulatory fiasco.
00:25:05.882 - 00:25:30.054, Speaker A: Kelsey says to Sam, you were really good about talking about ethics for someone who kind of saw it all as a game of winners and losers. And SBf replies, yeah, he he. I had to be. It's what reputations are made of to some extent. I feel bad for those who got effed by it, by this dumb game we woke westerners play where we say all the right Shibola S. I don't even know what that word is. And so everyone likes it.
00:25:30.054 - 00:25:32.920, Speaker A: Basically saying, yeah, the effective altruism thing was just a front.
00:25:33.610 - 00:26:10.820, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it continues. You kind of don't believe in doing unethical shit in quotes as anything other than a judgment we bestow upon the losers. And then SBF replies and goes, a month ago, CZ was a walking example of don't do unethical shit or your money is worthless. Now he's a hero. Is it because he's virtuous or because he had the bigger balance sheet and so he won? That's what he thinks. There's just not a base level of taking responsibility, and there's not a base level of ethics. This is not the type of person you want to entrust your money to.
00:26:11.750 - 00:26:33.366, Speaker A: So here's one. SBF says to Kelsey, I effed up big multiple times. But you know what was my biggest single f up? He's actually saying the word. And then Kelsey responds, oh, question mark. The one thing everyone told me to do. And then Kelsey responds, I'm trying to guess, but I have no idea. And then Sam goes, chapter eleven.
00:26:33.366 - 00:26:38.762, Speaker A: So, of all of his regrets, it was filing for bankruptcy that SBF regrets the most.
00:26:38.816 - 00:26:49.230, Speaker B: Also, if you read more of the text messages, he actually still thinks there's a chance. He's like, I didn't want to go bankrupt because I can still raise $10 billion right now. I used to be the best.
00:26:49.300 - 00:26:50.714, Speaker A: That is lunacy.
00:26:50.762 - 00:26:55.120, Speaker B: Yeah, it's lunacy. It's completely.
00:26:56.930 - 00:26:58.342, Speaker A: Cut off from reality.
00:26:58.506 - 00:27:06.126, Speaker B: Yeah. Detached. Completely detached from any form of reality. And there's delusions of grandeur there. Maybe. I don't know. I'm not a psychologist, but, like, dude.
00:27:06.158 - 00:27:11.910, Speaker A: That'S what we saw with the Voorhees. Like, that's how I would describe that debate with Eric Voorhees. Detached from reality.
00:27:12.570 - 00:27:36.650, Speaker B: But the fact that he still thinks. Yeah. At the end of this, that he can still just save the depositors money. I don't even know if he thinks that. I don't know what he thinks because he doesn't have any ethics. And this could be another PR thing. But all of his tweets recently, David, even this week, have been all about, my number one priority is saving customers money and protecting the customers and depositors.
00:27:36.650 - 00:27:46.206, Speaker B: And so at the end of this, he still thinks he can raise $10 billion. Someone's going to sink $10 billion into this failing ship and this broken empire.
00:27:46.318 - 00:28:10.490, Speaker A: So here is a fantastic summary thread from Genevieve, and she tweets out. I read the 30 page FTX bankruptcy court filing. How bad were FTX's internal controls? Question mark? Here are the worst examples. Example number one, employees submitted expense reimbursements over chat. A random manager would accept or reject these reimbursements with an emoji. Number two, related party loans. Alameda research.
00:28:10.490 - 00:28:19.498, Speaker A: FTX hedge funds gave Sam Bakemanfried a $1 billion personal loan. They also loaned director of engineering. Engineering $543,000,000.
00:28:19.584 - 00:28:21.114, Speaker B: They loaned him money.
00:28:21.232 - 00:28:35.470, Speaker A: Loaned, yeah. Three. Very few records were kept. Most decisions were made over chat, with a message automatically deleted after a certain time. So, apparently, Sam largely communicated with his employees over signal, because you can delete messages in signal.
00:28:35.550 - 00:28:47.278, Speaker B: Okay, but go back to that. So they gave SBF a billion dollar personal loan. They just gave him a billion dollars and one of his director of engineering half a million dollars.
00:28:47.384 - 00:29:12.534, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's actually not all of it, because in the picture that Genevieve is tweeting, it says, related party loans receivable of $4.1 billion at Alameda Research consisted primarily of a loan to Paperbird, Inc. A loan of $2.3 billion, and a loan to Mr. Bankman freed of $1 billion. You know who owns Paperbird Inc, Ryan?
00:29:12.662 - 00:29:15.306, Speaker B: I'm going to guess it's Mr. Sam Bankman Freed.
00:29:15.338 - 00:29:20.986, Speaker A: Mr. Sam Bankman Freed. So, actually, it was $3.3 billion that he got a loan from FTX.
00:29:21.018 - 00:29:23.406, Speaker B: Well named. It really was a paperbird, wasn't it?
00:29:23.508 - 00:29:25.982, Speaker A: Jesus, dude. Oh, my.
00:29:26.036 - 00:29:27.262, Speaker B: What else we got here.
00:29:27.396 - 00:29:51.334, Speaker A: FTX number five. FTX had no cash management system. Management had no idea how much cash was on hand at any given time or even where their cash was at all. Number six, FTX did not keep proper records of who they employed. Employees and contractors commingled throughout the different companies. Without proper documentation of how their time was spent, certain employees can't be located. Seven corporate funds were used to purchase personal use real estate.
00:29:51.334 - 00:30:11.546, Speaker A: And employees and executives put their names on homes purchased with company funds. Eight crypto deposited by customers weren't even recorded on the balance sheet. Presumably, all crypto assets went to one central slush fund used for whatever, what? Nine? The filing makes it clear that Sam Bankmanfree does not speak for the company and that his erratic and misleading public statement should be disregarded.
00:30:11.578 - 00:30:14.526, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess so.
00:30:14.628 - 00:30:26.274, Speaker A: This is just a house of cards like sticks and constructed business with a bunch of amphetamine riddled kids who are like, oh, sweet, we got a billion dollars. Let's do stuff.
00:30:26.472 - 00:31:03.882, Speaker B: No adults. But you know what's crazy is the amount of VCs they raised. Was it $2 billion? From notable VC firms this year, a number of which are coming out and apologizing, distancing themselves this week? Maybe we'll get to some of that. But the fact that this was going on, I guess, shows you the level of, I don't know, due diligence some of these firms are doing, or the lack of it, or the fact that they are. I think some of these VC firms are just like, they bet on people, they bet on individuals, and so they don't vet the core mechanics of the business. They don't look at the books. They're just making a bet on SBF.
00:31:03.882 - 00:31:08.530, Speaker B: And he was able to con. Yep. What's this next tweet we're looking at?
00:31:08.600 - 00:31:56.580, Speaker A: So this is a thread I thought was pretty interesting from this petrify TCG Twitter account that documents a lot of Sam Tribuco, who was the former head of Alameda. And Sam Tribuco put a thread together back in 2021, and he kind of just did some forensics. And basically he documents going from Alameda at the very beginning of Alameda, which was a Delta neutral trading hedge fund, which is just like a normal thing where they just market make. They don't take any risk, they don't take positions in the market, but then they decide to take more risk with defi yield farming, which is more risky. But you can still kind of control your losses to some extent if you're good and sophisticated. And then as it goes on. They just totally take directional bets on the money on the market.
00:31:56.580 - 00:32:18.150, Speaker A: And again, totally fine if you're not using customer deposits, which they were. And so you kind of see the documentation of Alameda going more and more and more risk on as the bull market went on. Because everyone's a genius, right? I was a genius in 2021. Not as smart in 2022, but I wasn't using customer deposits. So that's fine.
00:32:18.300 - 00:32:20.360, Speaker B: It's pretty smart then. Yeah.
00:32:20.730 - 00:32:31.354, Speaker A: And so it's basically like you can see the degeneracy of Alameda go higher and higher and higher as the bull market continues and then just not position themselves at all for the turning around of the market.
00:32:31.472 - 00:32:42.462, Speaker B: It sucks. It's brutal. This is so ugly. When you look into this, there's definitely a case. I mean, it's very obvious right now that Sam knew exactly what was going on.
00:32:42.596 - 00:33:12.554, Speaker A: It's not even like he knew about it him. It's like he definitely orchestrated it. There was a message. So remember all of those crazy tweets from Sam that we started off with? There was a leaked photo of the company slack of FTX that I'll read out inside of the company FTX. Somebody says, why is Sam trolling on Twitter as if this isn't a serious situation? Question mark, exclamation point. Question mark. Did we not learn that trolling on Twitter got us here? And Sam replies in slack, I'm sorry, exclamation point.
00:33:12.554 - 00:33:41.070, Speaker A: Maybe it's wrong. I took the approach because something needed to break through the mob mentality, but I'll likely be more straightforward going forward. What mob mentality, anyways? The employee responds, Sam respectfully, this is not helping. Nothing broke through the mob mentality. In fact, your tweets just made the people more mad that you had the audacity to tweet something cryptic when people's lives have been destroyed. I don't think anyone understood the cryptic nature of your what happened tweet thread. If there is more meaning behind it, please enlighten us, because we are lost.
00:33:41.070 - 00:33:43.374, Speaker A: Your employees lost everything they had on FTX.
00:33:43.422 - 00:33:43.730, Speaker B: Wow.
00:33:43.800 - 00:34:18.414, Speaker A: FTX users lost everything that they had on FTX. Everyone that chose to believe in you lost everything you tweeting. What happened in ten tweets spread out over 24 hours is just peaking everyone's anxiety in addition to the money that they have lost. I was personally also super anxious after every tweet you sent, hoping for some positive outcome. I request you to only tweet if you think you are adding value to your users investors employees. And if you have any plans of making us whole, anything else would infuriate people even more. A lot of us idolized you, Sam, and you have let us down.
00:34:18.414 - 00:34:28.590, Speaker A: In my opinion, you don't have anything of value for your users. Investors, employees, please refrain from tweeting. It's insane that this has to come from an employee of FTX inside of Slack.
00:34:28.670 - 00:34:42.342, Speaker B: It's sad. It's brutal, man. Good riddance. Right back to the theme. Thank God this guy is out of here. But it's been a slow train crash. I guess toward the end, all of this week felt like this.
00:34:42.342 - 00:35:06.942, Speaker B: We're looking at some court documents, I think, and there is a new CEO at the helm. So of course, FDX goes under bankruptcy, chapter eleven. That means SBF no longer has power, governance power of the organization. He has to step aside. Bye bye. New CEO John Rain. John Ray came in and he writes some scathing reviews of what was going on.
00:35:06.942 - 00:35:13.242, Speaker B: This is somebody who's coming externally and helping to, I guess, organize this company for bankruptcy.
00:35:13.306 - 00:35:48.406, Speaker A: And so in these chapter eleven bankruptcy documents, this new CEO says, I have over 40 years of legal and restructuring experience. I have been the chief restructuring officer or CEO of several of the largest corporate failures in history. I have supervised situations involving allegations of criminal activity and malfeasance. Enron. And I've supervised situations involving novel financial structures. Enron and residential capital and cross border asset recovery and maximization. Nearly every situation in which I have been involved has been characterized by deficits of some sort of internal controls, regulatory compliance, human resources and system integrity.
00:35:48.406 - 00:36:22.406, Speaker A: So he's setting himself up for a punchline. And here it is. Never in my career have I seen such a failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here. From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated, and potentially compromised individuals. This situation is unprecedented. This is the guy that oversaw the Enron restructuring, saying that this situation is unprecedented. Oh, my God.
00:36:22.508 - 00:36:43.562, Speaker B: My man's been doing this for 40 years and he's like, this is the worst I've ever seen in my whole career of seeing terrible things like, Enron. Doesn't even hold a candle to this. Here's another tweet thread of the chapter eleven first day affidavit. This is the affidavit filed by that John J. Ray. Anything we could take from this?
00:36:43.696 - 00:37:03.860, Speaker A: It's so bad. Ryan, we've talked a few about the things already. Like the reimbursing with emoji codes. There's some other crazy stuff. Employees were paid through online, like SBF. And Gary Wang controlled all of FTX's digital assets personally, using a group email account to share private keys. Oh, my.
00:37:03.860 - 00:37:09.538, Speaker A: It's like, if you want to read the trainwreck, just like the links in the show notes.
00:37:09.714 - 00:37:32.442, Speaker B: Well, here's one. Alameda had basically special privileges. They had kind of root access of the FTX exchange. And Alameda, of course, was Sam's private hedge fund, DGen trading firm. Right. There was a secret exemption. This is from the court documents, the secret exemption of Alameda from certain aspects of FTX Com's auto liquidation protocol.
00:37:32.442 - 00:37:38.538, Speaker B: Alameda was exempt from getting liquidated automatically on FTX.
00:37:38.634 - 00:37:43.102, Speaker A: So Alameda could leverage long on FTX without fear of liquidation.
00:37:43.166 - 00:37:59.974, Speaker B: So basically have no last in line for liquidation. Everyone else gets risk. Why would you ever come to this platform to trade? What a terrible. Just every. Everything stacked against you. They're literally preying on their users. Now, ultimately, they've stolen all the money.
00:37:59.974 - 00:38:01.238, Speaker B: So it doesn't surprise me.
00:38:01.324 - 00:38:21.970, Speaker A: Well, I think this is, like, one of the reasons why the whole thing fell through is Alameda took a leveraged long position, then the market turned over, and then they were never liquidated. So who's paying for that hole? Oh, well, it was FTX, aka customer deposits, because they didn't liquidate their own trading firm on their own exchange.
00:38:22.150 - 00:38:28.558, Speaker B: Okay, let's get to contagion. Here's the big story. Genesis. Who is Genesis, and what's happening with Genesis right now?
00:38:28.644 - 00:38:56.950, Speaker A: Okay, Genesis is like the biggest lending and trading desk in all of crypto. They're kind of the heartbeat. And this was the contagion that Chris Berniski was saying that he was looking for. Right. And so if Genesis is impacted, then you kind of know we're at the center of things. So Genesis, they tweeted out that they had $175,000,000 in FTX, which is now gone. And as a result of that, they have had to suspend withdrawals in their lending business, and so their lending desk is closed.
00:38:56.950 - 00:39:32.002, Speaker A: I'm sure they have plenty of money on the table. Do they have all of the money? I think we're still waiting to hear as a result of that. But this, of course, bleeds into Gemini and anyone else that has an earn product. So Gemini earn has paused withdrawals. And so, of course, this bleeds into anyone that gets yield out of Genesis. Gemini earn, for example. Gemini earn has paused withdrawals out of the Gemini team, and they say they were working closely with the Genesis team to help customers redeem their funds from the earn program as quickly as possible.
00:39:32.002 - 00:40:00.490, Speaker A: I think they just need to wait for the dust to settle and see where their accounts are. This does not impact any other Gemini products or services. The Gemini exchange is responsibly firewalled from Gemini earn because of good common sense and regulation. And I actually withdrew. I had, like, 0.1 ETH on Gemini, and I was able to withdraw that yesterday. So I can speak from experience here, but this leads us back to kind of how Genesis was the biggest lending desk in the space.
00:40:00.490 - 00:40:34.066, Speaker A: So we'll pull up a tweet from Dylan Leclaire here that gave their q three market activity snapshot. $8.4 billion in q three loan originations, $2.8 billion in active loans, $18.7 billion in derivatives traded, and then $9.6 billion in q three spot volume traded. And Dylan continues after putting out some of these numbers, and goes, not only does this perpetuate the contagion domino effect, but this also will further the liquidity crunch being felt across the space as institutional players reach for additional financing.
00:40:34.066 - 00:40:37.960, Speaker A: And so I don't really know the knock on effects of this.
00:40:38.750 - 00:40:56.698, Speaker B: The bottom line is genesis pause. Withdrawals pause, which means they're clean out of liquidity. That doesn't necessarily mean they're underwater and their liabilities exceed their assets. Doesn't necessarily mean that. But they've run out of liquidity. We don't know. It doesn't seem super healthy.
00:40:56.698 - 00:41:07.490, Speaker B: And because Gemini earns program was based on Genesis, essentially, now withdrawals are frozen on Gemini earn. By the way, David, guess who had some funds on Gemini earn too.
00:41:07.640 - 00:41:08.498, Speaker A: No way.
00:41:08.584 - 00:41:09.698, Speaker B: This guy right here.
00:41:09.784 - 00:41:10.226, Speaker A: Wow.
00:41:10.328 - 00:41:12.382, Speaker B: All right, I'm. Dude, have you missed crypto?
00:41:12.446 - 00:41:13.666, Speaker A: You've gotten all of them?
00:41:13.768 - 00:41:40.598, Speaker B: I haven't missed yet. Fortunately, very small amount, because, again, it's just like me testing these things. But, yeah, now you got to collect all those pipes. So Celsius is gone, obviously. I mean, like, dead, right? Blockfi probably dead unless it gets a cz bailout. Right. And that would be sort of the Hail Mary miracle shot.
00:41:40.598 - 00:41:44.286, Speaker B: My take on Gemini earn, I think there's a chance.
00:41:44.388 - 00:41:47.166, Speaker A: I think I'm feeling pretty good about that. I get over 50% chance.
00:41:47.188 - 00:42:10.086, Speaker B: I think that Genesis going under would be a really big freaking deal. And then the combination Genesis going under it, and then Gemini saying, sorry, I'll earn customer. That would be very damaging for Gemini's business. Right. So it feels like they're going to probably find a way. Or they could. I don't know.
00:42:10.086 - 00:42:35.210, Speaker B: I'm giving it like 50 50 oDs. And that is not based on any data or any science. It's just Ryan's gut feeling right now, having been through them all right now, I've got some experience on this, so not good. And of course, this is blockfi. They sent out an email earlier this week. We are shocked and dismayed by the news regarding FTX and Alameda. We, like the rest of the world, found out about this situation through Twitter.
00:42:35.210 - 00:42:55.540, Speaker B: Isn't that fun? And basically they're saying they're trying to protect client funds. They have no clarity. Everything's frozen. I don't know what blockfi is going to do. It's a really bad situation to be in, especially because they're getting double dunked here. Right. They basically went underwater over the summer as a result of.
00:42:55.540 - 00:43:09.682, Speaker B: It was a trade. It was the GDBC trade. When that kind of fell, the floor fell out from that. As a result of 3 hours capital. They got wrecked there. Then they got a bailout. But who'd they get a bailout from? FTX.
00:43:09.682 - 00:43:21.194, Speaker B: The Ponzi king himself comes and bails them out and now they're back underwater again. So pretty brutal situation to be in. I'm not sure that they're going to make it out of this, but maybe there's hope.
00:43:21.312 - 00:43:29.054, Speaker A: Well, so I feel bad for Blotfi because they got bought up and just subsumed into the did.
00:43:29.092 - 00:43:32.190, Speaker B: Why did Sam buy them? It wasn't out of the good graces of his heart, was it?
00:43:32.260 - 00:43:55.122, Speaker A: No, not at all. So this is autism capital tweeting out. This Twitter account is something else. They did a great job reporting this week. Despite the name from a blockfi employee. The only reason FTX bailed us out was to get our users funds onto their platform to use in their shell game. They applied immense pressure to get blockfi funds migrated to FTX custody.
00:43:55.122 - 00:44:01.706, Speaker A: Employees were told by executives to not ask questions about the move. Wow. Oof. Bad.
00:44:01.808 - 00:44:10.890, Speaker B: Yeah. Very bad. Yeah. So this is a Wall Street Journal again saying blockfly prepares for potential bankruptcy as the crypto contagion spreads.
00:44:11.310 - 00:44:12.682, Speaker A: Contagion than that, though.
00:44:12.816 - 00:44:22.014, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not going to call into the contagion either. Even after this week. I think this will take a few weeks to pan out fully. Yeah, we're getting close. I think we're getting close.
00:44:22.052 - 00:44:31.746, Speaker A: The news will be about this for all. Throughout 2023, Galwa Capital had 50% of its funds on FTX multi coin capital, 100 million.
00:44:31.928 - 00:44:35.422, Speaker B: That's 50% of their holdings. Entire fund got wrecked.
00:44:35.486 - 00:44:44.594, Speaker A: Yeah. Multicoin capital lost 10%. It was 50% of their assets. Not all of their deployed capital, but, yeah, 50% of multicoin assets were lost.
00:44:44.642 - 00:44:50.022, Speaker B: Well, they're down. I think they got at least 10%, maybe more.
00:44:50.076 - 00:44:59.094, Speaker A: Actually stuck 10% of the fund. Yes. So of their liquid assets that they had, it was like 50% of them, but they had a lot of other investments.
00:44:59.142 - 00:45:21.700, Speaker B: This 55% number is the drop in the fund's value, including the write down of all the FTT tokens and sold and everything else that they had in their fund, was a 55% down. Yeah. So pretty brutal. I'm not talking about over the year. I'm talking about over the week, like, a two week period that you're down 55%.
00:45:22.150 - 00:45:38.002, Speaker A: So circle also had some contagion with Genesis. I actually haven't been able to get some numbers on this one, but circle's yield, the yield that you get with circle goes from zero point 25% down to zero, because genesis was one of the few places that they were getting yield in the first place.
00:45:38.076 - 00:45:39.980, Speaker B: To be clear, USDC is fine.
00:45:40.350 - 00:45:42.822, Speaker A: USDC is fine. USDC is not going anywhere.
00:45:42.886 - 00:45:50.170, Speaker B: Yeah. Why was it not going anywhere? That's hard to say right now, to our knowledge.
00:45:51.630 - 00:46:17.010, Speaker A: So we have to ask ourselves, why was this at the center of contagion? It kind of was reminiscent of the three r's capital, where 3 hours capital is just taking loan from anyone that would give it to them. Well, FTX and Sam was kind of in the same position. Everyone was like, sam, take my money. You're like, this money making God, please take my money. And so because he's a sociopath con artist, he would say yes. So this is Frank Shaparo. That said, just spoke with an LP in several crypto funds.
00:46:17.010 - 00:46:44.214, Speaker A: He said when he asked funds why they did lazy due diligence on FTX, they responded with, basically, he was on the COVID of Fortune magazine. He was a big name. That was why they invested in FTX. And so Frank concludes there's going to be a lot of lawsuits and a lot of funds will shudder. Basically saying that if funds didn't do enough due diligence to investigate what's going on with FTX, then they might get sued.
00:46:44.342 - 00:46:57.134, Speaker B: They just gave him a pass because he had the social proof and he had the credentials, and they just fomoed right in because everything to that point that Sam had touched turned to money. So they needed to be part of that. That's why they did the lazy due diligence.
00:46:57.262 - 00:47:10.834, Speaker A: And Frank continues with a quote like, it's just like Theranos. But then also responds, even Theranos had a board of directors, which FTX did not. Absolute insanity like Theranos.
00:47:10.882 - 00:47:26.650, Speaker B: The worst. All right, so what's going on? On sort of the legal side of things. A few things. Number one, the US House committee just announced that they are scheduling a hearing on the FTX collapse. Great. That hearing is apparently happening in December. At some point in time.
00:47:26.650 - 00:47:49.522, Speaker B: That will be an eventful hearing. I'm sure that will be crypto being scrutinized. I don't expect to see a lot of distinction between CFI and Defi. I don't know. That's going to be an absolute mess. David. We're obviously going to a lot about that as it comes, but I'm not looking forward to that.
00:47:49.522 - 00:47:58.294, Speaker B: It's pretty terrible for the industry. Also, what's happening to the influencers who supported FTX and advertised for them?
00:47:58.412 - 00:48:27.594, Speaker A: Yeah, so Tom Brady, Larry David, a few other supporters, chef Curry also. Oof, they are. There's a class action lawsuit against other celebrity promoters who promoted FTX, which I kind of like. Larry David was just in the commercial. He was just hired to do a commercial. Tom Brady. Why is Tom Brady getting sued just because he was a paid like, Tom Brady is the person you trust to do due diligence.
00:48:27.594 - 00:48:30.446, Speaker A: I don't really understand this one, but people are mad and they're just trying to sue people.
00:48:30.548 - 00:48:39.140, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know what'll happen with these types of lawsuits, but yeah, people are very mad. But don't take Larry David from us. He is a national treasurer. Please.
00:48:40.310 - 00:49:13.270, Speaker A: Okay, so there's a bunch of reactions. Of course the entire crypto world is reacting, but I mean positively. So Binance has announced that their intent to do a vitalikbuterin flavored proof of reserve system. So CEO of Binance CZ reveals plans to implement a new proof of reserve system protocol developed by Vitalikbuterin. So that's a nice healthy response. Also in line with Binance, crypto.com also intends to audit their reserves using a proof of reserve system as well.
00:49:13.270 - 00:49:55.370, Speaker A: And then also, we kind of alluded to this earlier with the uniswap volumes at all time high, self custody is at all time highs. And so gnosis safe saw almost a billion dollars of inflows into the gnosis multisig ledger. The ledger hardware wallet sales at all time high. Trezor hardware, wallet sales up 300%. And so this tweet is just saying the flight to self custody is here. And then, of course, this is Andrew Thurman who's saying, most DeFi protocols are up double digits in users and transactions, while exchanges have huge outflows. Crypto, as measured by on chain activity, is doing great despite FTX fraud.
00:49:55.370 - 00:50:09.950, Speaker A: And he's actually retweeting Joe Weisenthal's tweet that says Joe Reisenthal is making fun of crypto being like, oh, yeah, but this isn't real crypto. Making a claims like, yeah, it's not real communism, which is.
00:50:10.020 - 00:50:14.858, Speaker B: He's always so cynical about grab the nuance of. But.
00:50:14.964 - 00:50:21.378, Speaker A: Right. Anyways, we have the data to prove that we are doing the responsible reactions to this event.
00:50:21.464 - 00:51:06.234, Speaker B: Cynics won't believe me, but this is good for crypto. This is healthy, this is good for bankless money systems overall, that we detox and get this centralized flaw in our system really was. All right, so we had some mainstream reporting about this entire situation, some pretty bad mainstream reporting. We also had Democrat influence, of course. So SBF was the number two largest donator to the Democratic Party, and some other folks within FTX organization contributed a great deal to Republicans as well. What tweet are we reading from Ryan Shea?
00:51:06.362 - 00:51:30.162, Speaker A: Yeah, so Ryan Shea says, this is crazy. Elizabeth Warren is known for being the anti crypto senator who helped her draft the tax legislation bill in 2016. None other than Joseph Bankman, father of Spf. And then he follows up, here's a reference to the bill on her website where she thanks Joe for the endorsement. This legislation has been endorsed by dozens of law professors and economists, including Joe Bankman of Stanford University.
00:51:30.226 - 00:51:30.694, Speaker B: Wow.
00:51:30.812 - 00:51:50.026, Speaker A: And then he follows up with a tweet from Elizabeth Warren. And Elizabeth Warren tweets out, the implosion of FTX must be a wake up call for Congress and financial regulators to hold this industry and its executives accountable. Too much of the crypto industry is smoke and mirrors. It's time for stronger rules and stronger enforcement to protect ordinary. Hmm.
00:51:50.138 - 00:51:53.280, Speaker B: Okay, that's an interesting tie. How about this?
00:51:54.050 - 00:52:14.530, Speaker A: So cold blooded. Schiller tweets out. Honestly, this headline and write up is awful. From the Ft, from the financial times. Cz's actions. This is a quote from the article, CZ's actions left Sam Bankman Fried's FTX filing for bankruptcy. As in CZ, the consequences of CZ's actions forced Sam to file for bankruptcy.
00:52:14.530 - 00:52:19.238, Speaker A: No, it's FBS actions that left FTX and hundreds of more filing yeah, they.
00:52:19.244 - 00:52:20.442, Speaker B: Have to correct that. That's amazing.
00:52:20.496 - 00:52:44.126, Speaker A: Pointing at the finger at CZ is a weird angle for the media to take. And there's this weird, like, caricature of CZ in a very not gracious illustration of CZ. It's a bad look. And this is the FT, man. Another one saying bankrupt. FTX gave $18.2 million to early COVID researchers who cast doubt on ivomectin and hydroquox.
00:52:44.126 - 00:53:03.794, Speaker A: The queen. This is like, I just butchered that pronunciation. But this was like these non vaccine solutions that were really supported by the right. And the claim here is that FTX gave $18 million to researchers who were able to cast doubt on these. Right. Conservative aligned solutions to COVID.
00:53:03.922 - 00:53:07.800, Speaker B: Dude, why does headline matter? I don't understand this.
00:53:08.650 - 00:53:24.494, Speaker A: Go to the next one where the title is FTX collapsed dooms founders effort to prevent another pandemic. And the subline is flush with crypto cash. Sam Bankman Fried spent tens of millions of dollars on campaign donations and projects intended to bolster public health.
00:53:24.532 - 00:53:25.150, Speaker B: How is he doing?
00:53:25.220 - 00:53:34.558, Speaker A: Track emerging viruses. What? This is what we're focusing on, how, like, Sam tried to stop the pandemic. Are you serious?
00:53:34.734 - 00:53:36.660, Speaker B: I don't even understand, actually.
00:53:37.030 - 00:53:44.466, Speaker A: It's because the mainstream media. He's a darling. And are you sure mainstream media is.
00:53:44.488 - 00:53:48.038, Speaker B: Still reporting out that he's a darling? I don't consume much mainstream media.
00:53:48.124 - 00:54:04.454, Speaker A: Okay, so go to Balaji's tweet, because Bellaji's tweet will summarize it pretty well. The net result of FTX is that billions of dollars was stolen from crypto investors to give to Democrat aligned politicians, nonprofits, and journalists. This is why there may be no prosecution.
00:54:04.502 - 00:54:09.900, Speaker B: Are you serious? Is there really not going to be, like, this man should be in a jumpsuit, right?
00:54:10.510 - 00:54:12.534, Speaker A: The fact that he's not already is insane.
00:54:12.662 - 00:54:39.670, Speaker B: Well, this is very clearly fraud. A scam, like the biggest financial heist that we've seen since a Bernie Madoff. And in Bernie Madoff's case, it was investors at least. This is literally the guy stealing from depositors. He's, like, operating a bank and stealing the savings accounts. And he's not going to go to jail for this. There's not going to be responsibility.
00:54:39.670 - 00:54:42.310, Speaker B: I can't believe that's true, David.
00:54:43.210 - 00:55:15.870, Speaker A: I hope it's not true. But some of the takes from mainstream media that missed the ball, like CZ, triggered FTX's collapse. FTX collapse founder tried to stop the pandemic. Just like some insane headlines, man. It's crazy. And remember, Bellagio always goes after the New York Times for being like, woke media. And so if SBF is donating $70 million to the woke political party, then all the woke media don't go after the actual point of the whole.
00:55:15.940 - 00:55:21.806, Speaker B: I want to give it some more time. I can't believe mainstream media is coming out on SBF side. How is that even a tenable?
00:55:21.998 - 00:55:29.270, Speaker A: I don't know if they're coming off on SPF side. They're just missing the point. They're missing the point about how he should be in a jumpsuit.
00:55:29.930 - 00:56:11.282, Speaker B: Okay, how about this from Brian Armstrong? I'll read this out. Twitter has broken just about every piece of this SDX story using blockchain analytics while New York Times is writing puff pieces on a criminal. Feels like a turning point for citizen journalism and loss of trust in mainstream media. Yeah, I totally agree. The coverage from what I just saw now and have been seeing has not been get. I don't know that I have a lot of hope other than look, public blockchains give us accountability into financial systems like this. And so anybody on chain can see what's going on and report out, and they're actually doing the work.
00:56:11.282 - 00:56:26.230, Speaker B: I mean, individuals are doing the work. They're uncovering where the money is flowing and what's actually happening. And it feels like mainstream media is just off on another planet at worst and like three steps behind at best.
00:56:26.380 - 00:56:50.702, Speaker A: So Hasketrade summarizes this nicely where he just says, lost count of the number of mainstream media articles since recently that have focused on CZ's role in this, SBF's ambitions. And also SBF's sleep schedule while failing to address Alameda FTX relations, backdoors, misuse of customer funds, the convenient hack, constant lies, reassolvency. Like, again, missing the point.
00:56:50.756 - 00:56:54.190, Speaker B: David. Did we even cover the hack? We even talked about the hack.
00:56:54.530 - 00:57:04.258, Speaker A: I don't even know what to do with the hack because FTX got hacked. We don't know who's got the money. It's like now the 30th largest ETH holder. I don't even know what to do with that information.
00:57:04.344 - 00:57:20.130, Speaker B: So there was some sort of hack that even kind of the new owners chapter eleven, owners of people trying to reorganize, restructure FTX, agree was a hack by some sort of third party insider.
00:57:20.210 - 00:57:21.298, Speaker A: I think it was a rogue employee.
00:57:21.314 - 00:57:26.378, Speaker B: And we don't know all the details. And how much did they come out with? It's like hundreds of millions of dollars.
00:57:26.464 - 00:57:28.122, Speaker A: It's like almost a billion dollars. Right.
00:57:28.256 - 00:57:55.620, Speaker B: We were seeing this on chain as it was happening. This was earlier in the week. Right. And they were converting from different stable coins and ultimately into E. And now, last I saw, they were, like, the 36th largest ETH holder. And so we don't know who this hacker is because of all of the mismanagement and the complete, utter lack of security at FTX. A whole bunch of people could have done this, including someone rogue and external from the.
00:57:56.310 - 00:57:58.470, Speaker A: Remember they were sharing private keys over email.
00:57:58.540 - 00:57:58.774, Speaker B: Right.
00:57:58.812 - 00:58:00.422, Speaker A: My God, it could have been anyone.
00:58:00.556 - 00:58:07.958, Speaker B: Meanwhile, there is a redemption arc starting from our friends at three Arrows Capital. David Phillips in here. Yes.
00:58:08.124 - 00:58:27.946, Speaker A: Yeah. So a number of people came out of the woodwork. A number of destroyed reputations came out of the woodwork in the last two weeks. So Doe Kwan showed up on up only. And then both Kyle Davies and Sue Zhu started tweeting again. And so people are saying, now is the time that you guys just return to crypto.
00:58:27.978 - 00:58:29.614, Speaker B: They don't look so bad relative to.
00:58:29.652 - 00:58:56.502, Speaker A: Yeah, because there is a bigger. Somebody lost more money than they did. And so both Kyle Davies and Su Zu are saying, oh, here's my story. Suzu put this tweet thread together about this metaphor for surfing, then how he crashed on the waves because he traded, and everyone was like, shut the hell up. You lied fraudulently about the state of your balances so you could borrow more money.
00:58:56.636 - 00:59:11.050, Speaker B: Here's something else. Who does CNBC, mainstream media finance decide to put on their show to talk about to comment on SBF and FTX fiasco? Kyle Davies, 3 hours capital.
00:59:12.190 - 00:59:14.142, Speaker A: Did you hear the question that she asked?
00:59:14.196 - 00:59:15.230, Speaker B: I did, yeah.
00:59:15.380 - 00:59:27.460, Speaker A: It's okay. Let's play it. Andrew, it's Becky. I take it you're not in Bali because of the G 20. Are you there because Indonesia is one of seven countries that won't extradite you back to the United States?
00:59:29.510 - 00:59:34.018, Speaker B: No. Well, for one, I haven't lived in.
00:59:34.024 - 00:59:36.990, Speaker A: The United States for, like, a decade. I've been in Asia.
00:59:37.070 - 00:59:40.134, Speaker B: But for two, no, it's just a good place to be.
00:59:40.252 - 00:59:43.330, Speaker A: So, Ryan, why do you think Kyle Davies is in Bali?
00:59:43.410 - 01:00:14.202, Speaker B: Well, I think we all know the like. What I'm shocked at is Kyle appears on TV and he doesn't expect to be asked that question. Right. I'm like, should not be a surprise. But part of me wonders, do you think CNBC is like, why would they have Kyle on Davies to comment on this? Do you think that they are actually just mocking crypto? Let's bring on some of the biggest scammers of 2022 and get these crypto people to comment on SBF to embarrass the industry.
01:00:14.266 - 01:00:18.606, Speaker A: So you guys know how to scam, right? Can you comment about the state of SBF?
01:00:18.798 - 01:00:32.834, Speaker B: I don't get it. Yeah, so anyway, look, we're still probably going to be talking about this sadly next week. We'd rather be talking about other things. In fact, after we come back, we're not talking about anything ftx.
01:00:32.962 - 01:00:33.990, Speaker A: We're not talking about it.
01:00:34.060 - 01:00:49.802, Speaker B: Yeah, for a little bit anyway. Maybe towards the end we will again. But coming up next, want to talk about l two s? Because they are coming in hot. Still building. Starkware has a new token, the Starknet token. Also bankless doing an NFT release. What a little something.
01:00:49.802 - 01:00:51.882, Speaker B: Not a big one, but a little something really cool.
01:00:51.936 - 01:00:52.734, Speaker A: I didn't know that.
01:00:52.852 - 01:00:58.830, Speaker B: We'll tell you more about that right when we come back after these fantastic sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:00:58.980 - 01:01:45.514, Speaker A: Truefi is DFI's largest credit protocol, connecting global lenders with institutional grade lending opportunities. TrueFi has completed over $1.7 billion in originations and paid out nearly $35 million to lenders, proving that DFI is ready to take its next big leap into the $8 trillion credit market. Truefi gives lenders like you access to sustainable, high yield opportunities backed by real world investments usually reserved for high net worth individuals. At the same time, fund managers use Truefi's financial infrastructure to bring their portfolios on chain, benefiting from the global liquidity, cost savings and transparency of DFI. Truefi is a decentralized financial utility. The protocol is owned and governed by the Trufi Dao, and Trufi is here to bring Defi into the golden age, bridging the power and access of crypto with institutional grade lending opportunities and portfolio tooling.
01:01:45.514 - 01:02:43.626, Speaker A: Explore is a diverse financial opportunities available on Truefi or launch your own portfolio at Truefi IO. If you've been listening to bankless, you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis, the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus, allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves. And Fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry. By supporting parallel transaction execution, fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web3 world fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the EVM with its own fuel VM, which is more efficient and optimized, opening up the design space for developers. And lastly, Fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain specific language, sway and a supportive tool chain called fork. With fuel, you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like validity, while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem, letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the EVM. If you want to learn more, there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with the fuel network.
01:02:43.626 - 01:02:50.290, Speaker A: We all love tokens. Ryan, I know you like tokens. Did you know that the Starknet token is now deployed on Ethereum?
01:02:50.870 - 01:03:05.720, Speaker B: That is cool. The Starknet token is called StRk, now deployed on Mainet Ethereum. So I actually haven't even had a chance to kind of look at the price or any of the details around this. Do you have anything?
01:03:06.090 - 01:03:13.046, Speaker A: There is not much. They just have a token and they said that they are going to work on distribution.
01:03:13.238 - 01:03:28.606, Speaker B: All right, work on it. Work on that. Distribution businesses can now accept USDC with Apple Pay. That's a pretty big move. Yeah. So USDC now getting into wallets like Apple Pay. It feels like some stablecoin saturation here.
01:03:28.708 - 01:04:00.330, Speaker A: Yeah. Still waiting on the actual details of how that actually shows up in my wallet. If I can put USCC on my phone and pay with Apple Pay, that is a huge unlock, but I would like to see how that actually gets shown up. Anyways, Solana actually, sadly, is getting USDC taken away from it. So this was interesting. Both binance and OKX have halted USDC and USDT deposits onto the chain. So binance has temporarily suspended tether and USDC deposits until further notice.
01:04:00.330 - 01:04:03.002, Speaker A: And also, OKX did it too.
01:04:03.136 - 01:04:05.194, Speaker B: This is FTX fallout stuff, right?
01:04:05.312 - 01:04:21.678, Speaker A: I think so. I think it's because Alameda was the large market maker on Solano using these stablecoins, and now since there's no market maker, there's less liquidity. That's the rumor that I've heard. I don't know why they made this choice, but the fact that both of them made at the same time, it was interesting.
01:04:21.844 - 01:04:36.790, Speaker B: Solana's definitely taking a hit from this. I think they'll recover, but yeah, it's going to take a while for this wound to heal. Let's talk about some NFT stuff. So Yuga Labs are buying some beeple stuff. People's getting involved with Yuga Labs. What's this?
01:04:36.860 - 01:05:09.950, Speaker A: So Yuga Labs has acquired Beeple's platform we knew, along with its flagship NFT collection ten KTF, which I actually didn't know existed. And Beeple Mike, aka, will also become an advisor to Yuga Labs. So cool. Interesting development. Didn't see that one coming. Also didn't see this one coming. Nike swoosh platform to allow users to buy digital wearables and build a community around these digital wearables, aka Nikes.
01:05:09.950 - 01:05:12.670, Speaker A: Ryan, are you going to line up to buy a digital.
01:05:14.230 - 01:05:19.410, Speaker B: Really? I'm not a shoe guy in real life, so I won't be in the metaverse either.
01:05:19.560 - 01:05:21.614, Speaker A: And surprise, it's on Polygon.
01:05:21.742 - 01:05:37.974, Speaker B: Yeah, Nike and Polygon partnership biz dev from Polygon continues to absolutely crush it. Sony just got a patent for NFTs and the blockchain. So Sony doing some things, I guess all companies are still doing things in crypto, even despite this bear market.
01:05:38.092 - 01:05:57.550, Speaker A: Yeah, so they say the patent is for tracking in game assets in video games, and it lays out mechanics for tracking changes in ownership, visual appearances, or metadata of digital assets. Kind of seems like it's a skin kind of thing. It's like, oh, yeah, it changes as you wear it. And if you trade it, it goes, I don't know, something like that. That's what I imagined.
01:05:57.890 - 01:06:30.118, Speaker B: We are experimenting with NFTs, too, so we promised this before we cut to sponsors, bankless is actually doing collectibles for some of our podcasts. So these are sound collectibles. I know you and I, David, have been on a little bit of a, kind of a music sound NFT binge where we've acquired some of our own. At least I have. I don't know if you have. You've certainly been bullish about them. So we thought, why not try our hand at this and convert some of the historic, legendary bankless podcasts into collectibles.
01:06:30.118 - 01:07:13.286, Speaker B: So we are actually releasing the first mint, the first bankless collectible podcast today. If you were listening to this, I think at 12:00 p.m., east it will go live. And the first episode that we are releasing as a collectible, NFT. So a sound collectible NFT is actually the SBF and Eric Voorhees debate. Now, all of the proceeds from this collectible we have decided to allocate towards coinster. So it's already tuned up so that anytime one of these NFTs is minted or any of the royalties on a resale goes directly, all the proceeds from that go directly to the coins center ETH address.
01:07:13.286 - 01:07:35.998, Speaker B: So if you buy one of these NFDs or if you sell it, percentage of the transaction fee on the sale, the royalty fee will go to coins center. And the idea here, David, is we're going to be doing more collectibles in the future. But this episode in particular, I mean, some people have said this episode sort of almost was the prick that popped the balloon here and start of the.
01:07:36.004 - 01:07:36.986, Speaker A: Fall of the house of cards.
01:07:37.018 - 01:08:17.370, Speaker B: Yeah, it helped us uncover everything with SBF, and we all know that, not only in the conversation, but all of the regulatory actions, all of kind of the smoke filled rooms and meetings that SBF was having with regulators, with lawmakers behind the scenes. He's done a lot of damage to crypto in DC, particularly, I think, damage to DeFi protocols and donation to coin center. I think, through this NFT, it's not going to undo the damage overnight, but it can help. It's something. Coincenter is doing fantastic work. They are educating our lawmakers. They are fighting for our legal rights.
01:08:18.910 - 01:08:20.426, Speaker A: So we kind of owe it to them.
01:08:20.528 - 01:08:35.582, Speaker B: Their jobs just got a whole lot harder. Anyway, the starting price of this, I believe, is 0.5 E. There's only 100 of these, and then they're all sold out. So we'll see how this goes, but we're pretty excited about it.
01:08:35.636 - 01:09:00.166, Speaker A: And if you are a holder of 35,000 bank, that price is actually 0.4 ether. We took that snapshot today. And the other cool thing about this is SBF talked a big game about effective altruism, Ryan. But with this, the donations to coin center are in the code. The money goes from you to them because of the code. And so you don't got to trust us the way it's meant to be.
01:09:00.348 - 01:09:09.980, Speaker B: Absolutely. And of course, this is going to be the first of many collectibles. This first, like I said, 100% of the proceeds are going to coin center. We'll be doing more in the future, too.
01:09:10.670 - 01:09:12.518, Speaker A: Legendary bankless podcast?
01:09:12.614 - 01:09:33.602, Speaker B: Yeah, this is called the Genesis Collection. So this is the first of four others that will be released. There's five in total in the Genesis collection. We're not going to tell you what the next podcast will be, but they're some of our favorite. These are the legendary podcast episodes that you can begin collecting if you're into that kind of thing. It could be a fun way to experiment with NFTs as well.
01:09:33.736 - 01:09:58.474, Speaker A: Meanwhile, moving on to different ecosystems. Cosmos. The community has voted on the Atom 2.0 proposal and rejected it. Actually interesting, but basically, the community has largely vocalized support for the general direction, but they wanted more clarity and refinement on some of the finer details. So, just taking a little bit back to the drawing board with the Atom 2.0 white paper, they're still going to do it, right?
01:09:58.512 - 01:10:02.378, Speaker B: They're still going to improve the monetary economics or pieces of it general support.
01:10:02.464 - 01:10:06.346, Speaker A: For the vibe of the white paper, but they want more specifics.
01:10:06.378 - 01:10:09.310, Speaker B: So they voted no for chop it into parts. Maybe something like this.
01:10:09.380 - 01:10:30.900, Speaker A: Yeah. And you know how we usually joke about how the Fed is like researching CBDCs? Well, the private markets, Citigroup, HSBC, Wells Fargo, Mastercard and a few others have actually joined forces with the Federal Reserve bank of New York to actually explore a cbdc trial. We will see what comes up out of that. Yeah, not.
01:10:31.770 - 01:10:36.982, Speaker B: Neither am I. David, some cool releases this week, the first from DeFi llama. What are they up to?
01:10:37.036 - 01:10:43.302, Speaker A: Oh, they have an aggregator, so they are joining matcha one inch now. DFI llama, exchange aggregator.
01:10:43.366 - 01:10:47.914, Speaker B: Aggregator, very cool. And how about this? This is really exciting, actually.
01:10:47.952 - 01:10:49.130, Speaker A: I'm so excited.
01:10:50.110 - 01:10:58.080, Speaker B: Permissionless 2023. It was a great conference. Probably definitely the best crypto conference I've ever been.
01:10:59.330 - 01:11:08.094, Speaker A: I can also say it was one of the best. It was definitely in the top three crypto conferences that I've been to in the last few years. And I've been to basically all of them.
01:11:08.212 - 01:11:25.314, Speaker B: Well, this is one that we are helping to throw. We helped to throw it last year with the team at blockworks, and we're doing it again this year. And this year it's going to be bigger, better. Yeah. When I say this year, by the way, I don't mean 2022. Sorry, I'm talking about September 2023. Austin, Texas.
01:11:25.314 - 01:11:28.194, Speaker B: September 11 through the 13th, more precisely.
01:11:28.242 - 01:11:28.406, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:11:28.428 - 01:12:16.738, Speaker B: So we're going to Austin because we need a bigger venue for this. And the news is that right now you can get tickets at the lowest possible price that you'll ever be able to get it, because in 13 days, the price of this thing increases. General admission passed. The permissionless conference is $199 if you buy that now. So if you know you're still going to be in crypto in September of next year, if you are a settler, not a tourist, you're going to want one of these tickets. And the big benefit, of course, is if you are a bankless premium subscriber, you get another 30% off on this. So, bankless premium members, not only do you get that fantastic Chris Berninsky episode in your premium RSS feed, but you get 30% off of the general admission pass at permissionless.
01:12:16.738 - 01:12:37.566, Speaker B: There's a link in the show notes where you can click and actually redeem that 30% discount if you are a bankless premium member. So, dude, I'm so excited. And you know what, David? You and I get to plan the agenda. We get to plan all of the speakers only. If people like the agenda, then we did it. If not, it was blockworks. But that's so fun.
01:12:37.566 - 01:12:43.790, Speaker B: I just love pouring all of the bankless content into that agenda and getting the entire community together for this.
01:12:43.860 - 01:12:57.186, Speaker A: Yeah, people were surprised that permissionless 2022 was a year one conference, but, yeah, that was the first year that we did it, and it was a huge success. I'm really looking forward to doing this again in 2023. Ryan, I'm looking forward to seeing you.
01:12:57.208 - 01:13:06.230, Speaker B: Man, for the second time. For the second time in our life. Dude, I got to get up to New York. I'll come up to New York before. That's the second time. No, I'm not doing my layer zero.
01:13:06.300 - 01:13:34.042, Speaker A: It's too much matter. Lab. ZK Sync raises $200 million. So in their series C, led by blockchain Capital and Dragonfly Ventures, ZK Sync raised $200 million, which leads to the total funding of $458,000,000, and a lot of that going ultimately into the ZK sync ecosystem. So congratulations to zk sync on the raise, and also Ryan and I are advisors to Zksync.
01:13:34.106 - 01:13:50.822, Speaker B: There's also an episode on Zksync that we dropped in the bankless YouTube channel. You can catch up and find out more about that raise and what they're doing. More recently, CZ is also still investing. I guess the only guy left with money. I hope it's real money. You think it is, David? Not like the FTX Sandbankman freed money. It's real.
01:13:50.876 - 01:13:54.918, Speaker A: I think it is. I think it is. I don't know, though, because you just don't really know.
01:13:55.004 - 01:14:07.466, Speaker B: I just signed eight investment deals, all small amounts but good projects, we think, I guess trying to bolster the strength of this industry while everyone's panicking. Good time to invest, I think, if you're CZ, though, for sure.
01:14:07.568 - 01:14:09.642, Speaker A: Good time to buy companies and stuff.
01:14:09.776 - 01:14:20.286, Speaker B: It's also still a good time to get a job in crypto. I mean, when you have L2 doing a 200 million dollar raise, you know, Zksync is hiring. What do we got on the job board this week? Shall I read some out?
01:14:20.308 - 01:14:21.118, Speaker A: Yeah, do it.
01:14:21.204 - 01:14:44.454, Speaker B: All right. Bankless palette.com. Of course you can find out about a senior smart contract engineer at Swell, senior front end engineer at Swell as well, and a backend engineer. Uniswap Labs. They need a developer relations lead, a senior frontend engineer, and more. There's all sorts of jobs still on the bankless job boards. Open hedge optimism is hiring rabbit hole coinshift ribbon Capital, Chainlink Labs and more.
01:14:44.454 - 01:15:05.790, Speaker B: Find that out link in the show notes or bankless palette.com slash jobs guys, we're going to be back with some hot takes from crypto, Twitter, and you know they're going to be hot this week. Pretty spicy. Some takes from Eric Voorhees, Chris Berninski, Brian Armstrong and more. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:15:05.940 - 01:15:54.350, Speaker A: Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web3 landscape.

01:16:53.988 - 01:17:12.034, Speaker B: All right, guys, we're back. Takes of the week. Jake Trevinsky, number one. What's he saying here? A lot of people think the collapse of FTX is evidence that crypto doesn't have a future. For me, it's the exact opposite. This proves why crypto, trustless, permissionless, uncensorable crypto is the only path forward for the future. This week we grieved.
01:17:12.034 - 01:17:32.714, Speaker B: Next week we build. Good words from Jake Trevinsky. I think we've made this point earlier this week that crypto is kind of bifurcated into two paths. We're going to have the centralized path. We'll always have that. That will be more tightly regulated from here on going forward. The other path, the bankless path, is the defi path.
01:17:32.714 - 01:17:53.678, Speaker B: And I'm hopeful that we continue to build on these permissionless, uncensorable, trustless protocols. The Defi protocols from the base layer up. Space in the middle that FTX tried to occupy no longer exists. No longer exists and was not a good space to occupy to begin with. What's this tweet from Eric Voorhees?
01:17:53.774 - 01:18:11.894, Speaker A: Eric Voorhees says crucial lesson to defi builders. Do not take a victory lap. Do not let your guard down. Do not cede an inch to complacency in your code. Audit often and from multiple parties, and assume the audits failed. Use guardrails to scale cautiously. DeFi wins with vigilance.
01:18:11.894 - 01:18:38.014, Speaker A: I think this is just emblematic of this state of mind, of just being more just militant and mission driven about why we're here in the first place. And when somebody like SBF and FTX comes and crashes our party, what do we do? We get better in spite. Out of spite. And I feel like that fits into the theme of this week, which is good riddance.
01:18:38.142 - 01:18:57.030, Speaker B: Yeah. I love having the ability to view source on these assets and some of these decentralized protocols. Right. And that's the way all crypto should be. Right. The fact that we had no idea what was going on in FTX's balance sheets, that is so anti crypto. That is so anti defi.
01:18:57.030 - 01:19:02.586, Speaker B: What's this from Chris Berninski talking about the Dark Lord? Read this out.
01:19:02.688 - 01:19:18.000, Speaker A: Chris says, everywhere I look, there are Muggles who don't know the Dark Lord has fallen, and the wizards are free. I think it's just like, emblematic of just like. Yeah, the wizards. What does he mean? The wizards are like crypto natives. Right. And we're free from. Because the Dark Lord is.
01:19:18.000 - 01:19:19.582, Speaker A: We just.
01:19:19.716 - 01:19:58.422, Speaker B: Voldemort just is gone now to a better. Seems like, it seems like everyone's sad and upset because I guess there's this blight on crypto. But Chris is looking at the removal of a cancer from the system and he's saying, no, this is actually the best news. I mean, Chris almost seems, from his tweets and even what we read earlier in the episode, he almost seems jubilant about all of this and not obviously the events and the people impacted, nothing like that. But just the fact that he's up only from here. Yeah. We have felt.
01:19:58.486 - 01:20:00.486, Speaker A: Can't be down bad any worse.
01:20:00.598 - 01:20:16.480, Speaker B: No. And this is the right kind of pain to feel. Like, these are tough lessons, but we're learning them, and through learning these lessons, we can make it out into the other side. All right, David, I could ask you, what are you bullish on this week? I think you've got something to show us.
01:20:17.170 - 01:20:34.840, Speaker A: Yeah. So last week I was down bad. I was very sad. I was a sad boy, as listeners of the weekly roll up would remember. And the amount of just hate and flak I got out of that on Twitter was surprising. People are just like. I think not.
01:20:36.090 - 01:20:55.120, Speaker B: You were like a poster boy for all of kind of the down bad crypto people. I think even, like, in. So there was two groups that I saw because, David, you almost became a meme last week, right? Yeah. There was definitely the internal crypto who are familiar with bankless, familiar with the show, like, know who you are. And these are people like from, I don't know, the hex community.
01:20:57.250 - 01:20:59.386, Speaker A: The communities that I've offended previously.
01:20:59.498 - 01:21:20.374, Speaker B: Yes. Or that, I don't know, they have some beef maybe with bankless or something that you've said. And so there was a lot of. And even strong bitcoin maximalist communities. There was a lot from there. But then I also saw you in kind of outside crypto cultures. Like, there was this megastreamer with like 3 million subscribers to his Twitch channel.
01:21:20.412 - 01:21:21.682, Speaker A: These crypto bros cry.
01:21:21.746 - 01:21:44.734, Speaker B: He was watching you over and over on a cycle. I watched 30 minutes of this where he was just talking about it and it was just like. And I think he was using that as all the crypto bros are crying right now. Look at this guy legitimately, which that piece probably, I mean, that's outside of the crypto tribe, and they don't know you, right. It's just like, whatever.
01:21:44.932 - 01:22:25.738, Speaker A: Okay, so the part that people didn't see, and this is what I'm bullish on, Ryan, is just the bankless family. I felt like there was a family here. And the just insane amount of outpouring of messages that I got, and I think you got a bunch of them, too. Just in my Twitter DMs, inside of the inner circle, discord was just like it was pages. Ryan and I took some screenshots of them and sent them to you. Just be like, dude, look at all of these people saying how much they've just appreciated bankless and all of the stuff that we've been doing over the last year and especially over the last week, and not any one of them was really emblematic of all of them until I got this one. Ryan, which was.
01:22:25.738 - 01:22:52.690, Speaker A: Somebody wrote out an entire letter entitled Pep talk from a longtime listener. You and Ryan have put your hearts and souls into helping make the crypto space more accessible and meaningful to the average non technical user. And you've done it tirelessly, week after week. You are to the space what Andreas Antonopoulos was for bitcoin back in the day. Only you're operating at the bleeding edge. And I'm sure it must feel exhilarating at times and futile at times. Like now.
01:22:52.690 - 01:23:37.618, Speaker A: If anyone gives you shit for emotion you displayed in the video, that's their issue. In a space that can become so incredibly mechanical, toxic, mercenary, and seemingly devoid of humanity, you guys have consistently been the light that brings the human element back into the focus. And it's heartbreaking to see one of the good guys in despair and this goes on. I just want to thank the bankless community and everyone who's listening and everyone who's just like, it's always nice to know that you guys are there, and it was a nice moment just to know that we're doing the right thing, and we have people that are along the bankless journey with us. So thank you for everyone who's been listening to these things, these weekly roll ups, over and over and over again, and thank you for your words of support. I definitely appreciate it.
01:23:37.704 - 01:24:06.954, Speaker B: 100%. I appreciate it, David. I'm not going to lie, I was feeling pretty down this past weekend about everything, right? Just like just SBF crypto getting a black eye. But then also just some of the infighting in crypto, it got toxic. A lot of the blame. They were looking for people to kind of burn at the stake. And anybody who had a YouTube channel, anyone who had a podcast, sometimes we were sort of thrown under that bus, too.
01:24:06.954 - 01:24:12.960, Speaker B: But what more than compensated for it was letters like this and messages like this.
01:24:13.330 - 01:24:17.742, Speaker A: Hundreds. My DMs were filled. I did not expect that.
01:24:17.796 - 01:24:41.570, Speaker B: Yeah. And this is kind of just, I don't know, the silent majority, I think, of good people in crypto. And I just want to say we appreciate you guys. We appreciate the bankless community and the bankless nation. And, I mean, ultimately, you guys are why we do this. I don't think I would have the energy to continue doing this. I mean, God, how many episodes have we recorded over the past two weeks? All time highs.
01:24:41.650 - 01:24:42.710, Speaker A: Oh, in the last two weeks?
01:24:42.780 - 01:25:02.682, Speaker B: Yeah, 500. My God. And by the way, podcast just hit 30 million downloads, too, which is really cool. And we just appreciate knowing you guys are there for us and listening in week to week. And you guys are the silent ones that reach out when we need help and when we're in crisis. So we're doing this for you. Wow.
01:25:02.682 - 01:25:32.386, Speaker B: I don't have another one to top that, David. I don't know what I'm bullish on compared to that. I'm definitely bullish. The bankless community. I think I'm bullish about an opportunity to rebuild, though. Sort of know the Dark Lord is dead kind of idea with Berninski here. I think that SBF and that circle of trader finance, I'm going to call it finance Bros as shorthand.
01:25:32.386 - 01:26:13.266, Speaker B: But that whole culture was sort of the last distraction for me that I felt. Now it's very clear what's in front of us. We've got decentralized finance, Ethereum, and related communities, and then we have, on the other side, we have some of the crypto banks, like the binances of the world, and it's these two camps. And not say binance is always doing bad things. Of course, I think they have some crypto values, but they're not building on yet. Anyway, on base layer protocols like Ethereum and bitcoin. And so I feel like the last distraction is gone.
01:26:13.266 - 01:26:44.014, Speaker B: And we know very clearly what we need to do and how we need to rebuild this industry and revitalize it. That doesn't mean it's going to happen overnight, but I know where I'm going to be, and I'm just excited to get the last remaining toxicity out. I do feel like we've cut out kind of the final cancer, and we are on the road to recovery, and we're in remission right now, and things are looking good. Our chances look very good from here on out. So that's what I'm excited about.
01:26:44.132 - 01:26:56.990, Speaker A: Yeah. And it's what I'm optimistic about. This is exactly what kind of Chris Brunisky was saying. It's like, yeah, we're down bad, but it's up only from get any worse. So you can only be optimistic.
01:26:57.070 - 01:26:59.058, Speaker B: All right, meme of the week, what are we looking at?
01:26:59.224 - 01:27:08.414, Speaker A: Oh, my God. The big short number two. Damn. Banquet free. Doe, Kwan, CZ and Michael Saylor. Oh, my God. I hope Michael Saylor actually doesn't get liquidated.
01:27:08.414 - 01:27:09.538, Speaker A: That'd be bad for all of us.
01:27:09.624 - 01:27:09.922, Speaker B: No.
01:27:09.976 - 01:27:14.386, Speaker A: Anyways, coming soon to a theater near you? I hope not, but it's a good meme.
01:27:14.418 - 01:27:24.982, Speaker B: Guys, you got to stick around for the moment of Zen. It's another song by the song of Damon. I think he captures the SBF fiasco pretty perfectly. So you're going to enjoy this. Of course. As always. Risks and disclaimers.
01:27:24.982 - 01:27:31.766, Speaker B: Crypto is risky. So is Defi. So is ETH. All of this stuff is. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier.
01:27:31.766 - 01:27:43.978, Speaker B: It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot. Okay. Sam was having meetings with Gary. Gary used to work for Glenn. Glenn is the papa of Caroline.
01:27:43.978 - 01:28:07.110, Speaker B: And she was stupid. Sam. It's regulatory capture of the highest degree, assisted by the New York Times congressman. MIT. Bilateral bespoke, non reported transactions happening on FTX. No one knew how much risk was in that system. Until it all fell apart.
01:28:07.110 - 01:28:26.730, Speaker B: Until it all fell apart. We've never had customer losses. How it all fell apart. Sam was having me with Gary. Gary used to work for Glenn. Glenn is the papa of Caroline. She was dripping sand.
01:28:26.730 - 01:28:42.154, Speaker B: It's regulatory capture of the highest debris in MIT. We. Until it all fell apart. Until it all fell apart.
01:28:42.202 - 01:28:45.070, Speaker A: We've never had customer losses.
01:28:45.370 - 01:28:58.260, Speaker B: I'm telling. All fell apart. Until it all fell apart. We've never had customer losses. How it all fell apart? Close.
