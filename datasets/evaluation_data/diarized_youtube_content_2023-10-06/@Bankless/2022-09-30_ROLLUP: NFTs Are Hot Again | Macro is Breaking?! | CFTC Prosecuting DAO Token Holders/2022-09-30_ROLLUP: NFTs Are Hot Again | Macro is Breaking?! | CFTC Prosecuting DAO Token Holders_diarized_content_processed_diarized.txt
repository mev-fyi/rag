00:00:00.250 - 00:00:09.946, Speaker A: Everyone has mistakes in crypto. Bury those mistakes deep down, never think about them. That's my strategy for coping. All the things I've missed. David, how many things have you missed? Oh, my God. I've missed so many things in crypto.
00:00:09.978 - 00:00:13.470, Speaker B: I've missed. I've missed zero things. There's not a single thing that I've.
00:00:14.290 - 00:00:27.014, Speaker A: Well, bring that alpha to me, man, because I've missed a lot over the years. Bankless nation. Happy fifth Friday of September, September 2022. You that is. David, how you doing today?
00:00:27.132 - 00:00:29.558, Speaker B: Absolutely fantastic. Ryan, how are you?
00:00:29.724 - 00:00:31.640, Speaker A: Good, man. What are we getting into today?
00:00:32.010 - 00:00:50.586, Speaker B: So, you know, how was it last week that was like the cope bear market weekly roll up? Yeah, this one's a good one. NFTs came alive this week in very unexpected ways. The theme of this week is that NFTs won bigly. So I'm pretty stoked about that.
00:00:50.688 - 00:00:56.414, Speaker A: So is this a glimmer of hope in the midst of in the bear market that NFTs had a crazy big week?
00:00:56.532 - 00:01:29.590, Speaker B: Well, I don't really think anyone who's still at this point in this market now is doubtful about the future of this industry. And I think this is a great example of a build market. Prices are down, but things are moving. There are tectonic shifts happening both in the L2 space and also in the NFT market. And there's like five different massive things that happened. And we're going to talk about all of them because, Ryan, it's a Friday weekly roll up where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless into the frontier with a cup of coffee.
00:01:30.490 - 00:01:41.334, Speaker A: I have my cup of coffee. I do. I know it's a little late for you. And by the way, David, the other reason bankless listeners, David is bullish today on today's episode is because he just told me he had a fantastic night of sleep. All right.
00:01:41.392 - 00:01:43.230, Speaker B: A rare occurrence, yes.
00:01:43.300 - 00:01:50.800, Speaker A: And David with like nine plus hours of sleep in him is a different David. He is a bull market David. Is that fair?
00:01:51.410 - 00:01:59.330, Speaker B: Yeah. People who pay attention to know I have troubles with sleep. So when I wake up at somehow 09:00 a.m. After sleeping all the way through the night, I get real excited.
00:01:59.830 - 00:02:11.922, Speaker A: Well, we got some huge wins across the board in NFT to talk about. Christie's doing some stuff. Also, the Fidenzer creator just sold out a new batch of nfts. Yeah. What else in the NFT world, David?
00:02:12.066 - 00:02:39.066, Speaker B: New England Patriots football team are going web3. What the hell does that mean? And a massive crypto punk sale again. And that's just the tip of the iceberg for what happened this week. Of course, some bad things did happen as well. CFTC going after Dao token holders, joining the ranks of the SEC, doing the regulation by enforcement strategy. We thought the CFTC were the good ones. Sad.
00:02:39.066 - 00:02:43.086, Speaker B: But we'll get into all these details and more as we go throughout the weekly roll up.
00:02:43.108 - 00:02:57.042, Speaker A: And before we get in, want to tell you about our friends and sponsors at Swelt Network. David and I are angel investors with this product too, because we think it is really cool. It's decentralizing Ethereum staking. David, tell them about swell and how people can get involved.
00:02:57.106 - 00:03:31.600, Speaker B: Yeah, Swell is joining the ranks of rocket pool and Lido as a decentralized staking as a service Dow. It's permissionless, like rocket pool. So any node operator can come join the network with a 16 e bond. But it's also permissioned like Lido, where Dow, with the Dow votes on who is allowed to run a validator node without a bond. So both trustless and trusted at the same time, trying to go after the best of both worlds, community owned and operated Dow. They want you in the discord so they can grow this network out. And so there is a link in the show notes for you to get started with that.
00:03:32.290 - 00:03:34.894, Speaker A: I just noticed Mark Cuban is involved in this, too.
00:03:34.932 - 00:03:35.342, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:03:35.396 - 00:03:35.662, Speaker A: Cool.
00:03:35.716 - 00:03:38.514, Speaker B: Wow. Angel brothers with Mark Cuban. All right, what's up, Mark?
00:03:38.632 - 00:03:49.470, Speaker A: Trying to decentralize staking right here. Yeah, definitely. Check out that discord. Get in on the ground floor of this community. They're building something really cool. All right, David, let's get to markets today. Got to start with King bitcoin.
00:03:49.470 - 00:03:54.114, Speaker A: It is still the king right now. What's it trading at this week? At the time of recording?
00:03:54.162 - 00:04:14.286, Speaker B: I think this week, Ryan, the prices this week set an all time record for the most flat weeks. We are literally at the same price as we were seven days ago. I think bitcoin is down zero point 15%, which if you're going to call anything flat in crypto, it's that. So start of the week at 19,300. Ending the week at 19,300.
00:04:14.388 - 00:04:16.426, Speaker A: We're flat in bitcoin. We also flatten eth.
00:04:16.458 - 00:04:21.598, Speaker B: David, same story. Start of the week at 1320. Ending the week at 1320. Wow.
00:04:21.764 - 00:04:33.710, Speaker A: Okay, flat week crab market as we've called it before. I guess the last seven days, the crypto markets don't know what to do. How are we looking on the ratio David, is that giving us any signal in this? This is the ETH to bitcoin ratio?
00:04:33.870 - 00:04:48.582, Speaker B: Well, no, because everything else is flat, too. People noticed last week, Ryan, when we skipped over the ETH BTC ratio, we started talking about something about the eth gas markets, and then we just decided to skip the ratio. And people were like, oh, yeah, super convenient of David to skip the ratio on the bad week.
00:04:48.636 - 00:04:50.330, Speaker A: Well, were they wrong, David?
00:04:51.550 - 00:05:04.442, Speaker B: They might have clued into something. Perhaps, but yes, over the two week period, the ETH BTC ratio is down. We are down to zero point 69. Nice. But this week it was flat. This week it was flat.
00:05:04.506 - 00:05:11.214, Speaker A: This week is flat. Other week is down. Kind of weird to see it down post merge, I guess. Maybe. Are you surprised about that?
00:05:11.332 - 00:05:23.726, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess. It's the merge unwind, but also the bear market. Again, the merge trade is never about the week after the merge or the month after the merge. It's about the year after the merge.
00:05:23.918 - 00:05:37.766, Speaker A: And a year from now, David's going to be saying the next three to five years after the merge, not yet. Not priced in yet, guys. Give it time. All right. Give that supply burn some time to activate fully. Are we good?
00:05:37.788 - 00:05:39.606, Speaker B: Burn day today, by the way. We'll talk about that.
00:05:39.708 - 00:05:45.242, Speaker A: How about cryptocurrency market caps as a whole? Are we above or below a trillion dollars?
00:05:45.376 - 00:06:02.954, Speaker B: We are below a trillion dollars. We're up on the week, though. So where bitcoin and ether were, the blue chips were flat. We're actually slightly up on the total crypto market cap. 94 trillion up to zero. 97 trillion in the last seven days. So we went up $30 billion in seven days.
00:06:02.954 - 00:06:08.606, Speaker B: So that means some tokens in the low cap gem categories got an increase in valuation.
00:06:08.718 - 00:06:20.450, Speaker A: 30 billion in value created just like that. I remember when the crypto market cap as a whole was less than $30 billion. Now we're just talking about 30 billion.
00:06:20.530 - 00:06:21.586, Speaker B: 30 billion movements.
00:06:21.698 - 00:06:46.426, Speaker A: Yeah, a minor movement from week to week. All right, let's talk about the dollar for a minute, because I think like a bullish chart. Yeah, this is a bullish chart. I kind of wish this was the bitcoin or eth chart, but it's not. This is actually a chart for the DXY. This is the dollar relative to a basket of other fiat currencies, primarily, I think, the euro. Yeah, the Dixie and the yen.
00:06:46.426 - 00:06:49.562, Speaker A: And it looks like it is pumping.
00:06:49.706 - 00:07:04.078, Speaker B: Yeah, that's happening. Babylon right there. Yeah, the dollar is just. And other currencies, of course, are going down versus the dollar. The british pound fell off a cliff recently. That was a big topic in the macro world. The euro is down to like ninety six cents on the dollar.
00:07:04.078 - 00:07:19.670, Speaker B: The dollar. Everyone wants dollars. Dollars are in. So dollars a pump. So if you are a dollar holder, it's as if your chart is going up versus like the rest of the world. So congrats to all dollar holders out there, you fiat trash monkeys.
00:07:20.810 - 00:07:27.020, Speaker A: Hey, I'm a dollar holder. Don't call me trash monkey. Don't you have dollars? You're a trash monkey too. What are you doing?
00:07:28.110 - 00:07:36.220, Speaker B: But I will say that this is a parabola, right? And so that's unsustainable. Have we topped out on this parabola? I don't know.
00:07:36.610 - 00:07:44.606, Speaker A: Why is the dollar a wrecking ball? There's this kind of the dollar milkshake theory at play. Who's the gentleman behind the dollar milkshake theory? His name escapes me at the moment.
00:07:44.628 - 00:07:48.210, Speaker B: But I know we've had him podcast Bret Johnson. Bret Johnson's the guy?
00:07:48.280 - 00:07:54.226, Speaker A: Yeah, Bret Johnson. So this is Bret Johnson basically theory playing out. So markets are down.
00:07:54.328 - 00:07:55.746, Speaker B: Half of it. Half of it.
00:07:55.768 - 00:07:56.434, Speaker A: What's the other?
00:07:56.552 - 00:08:06.370, Speaker B: The first half is there's demand for the dollar. The second half is there's the collapse of the demand for the dollar. So like, if the dollar pumps ongoing order of operations.
00:08:06.450 - 00:08:14.854, Speaker A: You mean his dollar milkshake theory has two parts to it? There's a part one, the dollar pumps, pumps, pumps. And then there's where it collapses.
00:08:14.982 - 00:08:42.818, Speaker B: Correct. Yeah. The anti dollar milkshake theory is that the dollar pumps and it doesn't collapse, which I actually think is a pretty fair take. And when we talked to Noah, unreleased podcast, Noah opinion, he was like, yeah, everyone really wants dollars right now. And so you could see a world where the dollar grows in relative strength versus all fiat currencies and then doesn't lose that. And it just is the last standing fiat currency. I think that's what's always interesting is.
00:08:42.904 - 00:09:10.074, Speaker A: There doesn't seem to be another fiat currency that is contending the dollar right now. Not even close. But you're seeing all of liquidity from the other fiat currencies being sucked out. Have you seen those images, David, lately, of Hurricane Ian? Like Tampa Bay. We're just like looking at kind of the coast of Tampa Bay and all of the tide has been sucked out for the hurricane. This is like liquidity getting sucked into the dollar. That's what's happening right now from other assets, as other assets are going down.
00:09:10.074 - 00:09:43.814, Speaker A: We'll talk about bonds in a minute. This is Jim Bianco though, talking about the dollar, and he says this, the US economy is about 25% of world gdp. All right, Americans, your economy is 25% of world gdp. So you got about a quarter of the gdp, but the dollar is 85% of world trade. 85% of world trade is priced in dollars. So you got a GDP worth about 25%, but you have this exorbitant privilege Bianco is talking about of 85% of the world trade is priced in dollars. You just look at that.
00:09:43.814 - 00:10:14.722, Speaker A: The dollar is the absolute champion right now in the fiat currency world. And David, this is a graph I saw actually on Reddit. Look at these numbers. This is year to date of the dollar and all of the other world currencies falling relative to the dollar. You could see the yen in there, down 20%, the pound in there. It's probably worse by now, but down 20% at the time of this recording. So the dollar actually is operating as a wrecking ball and sucking all of the liquidity into it at the same time.
00:10:14.722 - 00:10:41.690, Speaker A: David, the bond market seems to be getting torched. The bond market, okay, these are treasuries and sovereign bonds. This is another tweet from Jim Bianco. I think the bond market is very big, very opaque and very complicated. This is why it blows up regularly. GFC 2008, the repo 2019, Covid 2020 now, question mark. Question mark, question mark.
00:10:41.690 - 00:10:52.894, Speaker A: Is that what's happening now? What have been the warning signs? Trouble is brewing. Jim goes through some of the tweets above. But look at this, David. This is year to date bond market, okay?
00:10:53.012 - 00:10:56.922, Speaker B: The absolute, that line looks different than all other lines.
00:10:56.986 - 00:11:01.226, Speaker A: This is a scary line, okay? And this is year to date total return technical analysis.
00:11:01.258 - 00:11:01.706, Speaker B: Bloom.
00:11:01.818 - 00:11:25.190, Speaker A: It's scary. This looks scary to me. Bloomberg Global Aggregate index. All right, and we are down in the bond market, down about 20% year to date. Look at all of the other starts of years that were bad. The second worst in 1999, which around this time was down about 5%. Here we are in the bond market, down 20% year to date.
00:11:25.190 - 00:11:27.142, Speaker A: So bonds not doing too well.
00:11:27.196 - 00:11:58.894, Speaker B: I remember when we had Jim Bianco on, it was about at that first mark, I believe in the blue line there, that first dip around June, and my mind was like, oh, okay, it's really, really bad. How bad can it get? Can it really get much worse? Maybe. And then it got better and then it got a lot worse. So this thing has continued, this line has continued to diverge from all other previous lines. Again, some high quality technical analysis, not technical analysis. And high quality market analysis by bankless lines looking different lines are different lines.
00:11:58.942 - 00:12:08.130, Speaker A: Looking different lines looking bad. Lines going down on the bond market while line going up on the strength of the US dollar. This is another line. This looks scary.
00:12:08.210 - 00:12:09.720, Speaker B: Here's a great line.
00:12:10.330 - 00:12:24.998, Speaker A: This is the tweet. No words. And this is depicting the drawdown in total market capitalization of us equity and fixed income. Of course, fixed income is primarily in the form of bonds. Us equity. We know what those are. That is stocks.
00:12:24.998 - 00:12:33.358, Speaker A: And look, we are down 57.8 trillion on the year to date basis. And what does that mean?
00:12:33.444 - 00:12:34.814, Speaker B: Can you explain, like, I'm five.
00:12:34.932 - 00:12:44.126, Speaker A: This is the total market cap of stocks and fixed income. Stocks and bonds down 57.8 trillion from their all time highs.
00:12:44.238 - 00:12:51.666, Speaker B: Wait, so $57.8 trillion of wealth is gone in the last, like half of.
00:12:51.688 - 00:12:53.314, Speaker A: A year from all time high?
00:12:53.352 - 00:12:56.902, Speaker B: Yeah, from all time highs. That's a lot.
00:12:56.956 - 00:12:59.622, Speaker A: From whenever. The all time market cap. Yeah, it's big.
00:12:59.676 - 00:13:08.822, Speaker B: The crypto total market cap is under 1 trillion. We've lost 58 crypto industries in 2022.
00:13:08.876 - 00:13:09.334, Speaker A: There you go.
00:13:09.372 - 00:13:10.130, Speaker B: When you put it that way, I.
00:13:10.140 - 00:13:11.094, Speaker A: Don'T feel so bad, David.
00:13:11.142 - 00:13:11.670, Speaker B: I cannot.
00:13:11.750 - 00:13:32.240, Speaker A: Doing great. Mike Novogratz makes the comment that this is three x GDP. That's what we're talking about. $57.8 trillion is three x GDP. All right, so if you have your money in equities and you have your money in bonds, which most pensions do, you're feeling a wee bit of pain right now. Like, this does not feel good.
00:13:32.240 - 00:13:54.550, Speaker A: This does not feel healthy, certainly. And we are actually maybe starting to see signs of pensions get into hard times. Pensions going bust. Question mark. I don't know too much about this story or how it's developing, but this is a headline from the Wall Street Journal. UK pensions push into hard to sell assets. Expose them to a cash squeeze.
00:13:54.550 - 00:13:57.190, Speaker A: That headline sucks.
00:13:57.530 - 00:14:18.474, Speaker B: Yeah, that headline's pretty bad. What it means, uk pensions push into hard to sell assets. That means previously uk pensions bought hard to sell assets and that exposure to them has put them into a cash squeeze. Wall Street Journal, improve your headlines. But basically, pensions have a bunch of illiquid assets and they can't sell them because of illiquidity crisis.
00:14:18.602 - 00:14:22.800, Speaker A: Get advice from bankless headlines. Okay, lines going down. All right.
00:14:23.490 - 00:14:24.770, Speaker B: Things are terrible.
00:14:26.070 - 00:14:50.786, Speaker A: Break it down so people understand. All right, Wall Street Journal. So that's what's going on. And I guess the macro take here has always been the take, as we had sort of that macro sprint back over the summer of just trying to understand what's going on, right. Strengthening dollar bonds, getting worse. The question is how long will bondholders be holding the bag for all of the inflation costs. Right.
00:14:50.786 - 00:15:34.390, Speaker A: And so the question in my mind and the question that Bianco and other macro analysts that we brought on bankless have always brought up is how long will the central bank, will Jerome Powell continue to tighten? And the answer has always been, until things start to break. All right. Are these signs of things breaking? I mean, bondholders cannot be happy at this point in time. We have uk pensions maybe feeling some pressure and a squeeze. Are things starting to break? Are we starting to see early signs of a fracture? And yet the Fed continues to tighten. So this is the question, and I almost think, David, I want to get some more macro voices on bankless to answer this question of how far can the Fed actually push the markets before things break.
00:15:34.540 - 00:15:58.234, Speaker B: Well, it seems to be, it's breaking in a number of different ways all at once. There seems to be a number of things that seem to are on the precipice of breaking the bond market. I guess that pushes the pension plans into bad spots. Stock market's bad, down bad. People are going to start to go insolvent in the stock market now. It's a game of like, no, wait, what's going to break first, because there's.
00:15:58.282 - 00:16:20.306, Speaker A: Many different fractures, including there's talk of inflation being sort of a lagging indicator, and maybe we're actually entering deflationary territory. And that could be worrisome because if you tighten too hard, too fast, and you're only responding to lagging indicators, what if you turn the entire economy into worse than a recession, into a deflationary depression?
00:16:20.418 - 00:16:37.626, Speaker B: I think the idea that we have a ton of inflation because the Fed was too slow to increase interest rates, followed by now we have a bunch of deflation because the Fed was too slow to pivot and reduce interest rates, seems like a reasonable future scenario to have. That seems simple, though.
00:16:37.648 - 00:16:46.302, Speaker A: They got to see that, right? If you're Powell, let's not make the same mistake we made by the thing you would hope.
00:16:46.436 - 00:16:50.910, Speaker B: Okay, are our central bankers smart or are they dumb?
00:16:51.810 - 00:16:53.534, Speaker A: I've never been able to answer that question.
00:16:53.572 - 00:16:54.526, Speaker B: I've never been able to answer that question.
00:16:54.548 - 00:16:59.460, Speaker A: Because sometimes I wonder if they are smart, but they're acting dumb. That could be part of the game.
00:17:00.150 - 00:17:03.262, Speaker B: That whole angle really throws a curveball into the whole analysis.
00:17:03.326 - 00:17:22.860, Speaker A: I think they're actually smart. I think they're smart and sometimes they play dumb. I think that's the case. And sometimes they're just dealing with the cards they were dealt and, like, kind of the political tools at their disposal as well. But let's talk about the crypto economy, an economy that we understand a little bit more.
00:17:23.230 - 00:17:27.226, Speaker B: Ultrasound about money makes me feel so comfortable. I understand everything on this page.
00:17:27.328 - 00:17:35.802, Speaker A: So do I. I understand this page. It all makes sense to me. It's just like, I don't have to worry about, like, it's all algorithmic.
00:17:35.946 - 00:17:38.174, Speaker B: The lines on this page look good.
00:17:38.292 - 00:17:56.440, Speaker A: Yes, the lines look good. All right, so we are actually not ultrasound, though, David, post merge yet. So we looked at this last week. Just, I got to look at it again this week. We have increased supply of ETH, 8500 ETH worth of supply. However, I'm going to click this button. This is a fun button.
00:17:56.440 - 00:17:59.910, Speaker A: If we didn't merge, we would have been.
00:17:59.980 - 00:18:12.140, Speaker B: How much, David, you said 180,000. So eight and a half thousand versus 180,000 ether issued. Yeah, that's different.
00:18:12.670 - 00:18:25.258, Speaker A: So ETH issuance hanging at about zero point 18%. That's the annual issuance as of now. But that can change quickly. And, David, maybe we go through that in a few tweets. What's this first tweet we're looking at?
00:18:25.344 - 00:18:47.806, Speaker B: Yeah, so this was an interesting take that actually, a lot of people in my circles were like, oh, I didn't think about this. This tweet says minor payouts artificially increase the gas price. Now that now there are 500,000 less of such regular transactions. I think they mean that. I don't know what on a time frame that is, maybe on a daily time frame. But basically, here's how this works. Minor pools.
00:18:47.806 - 00:19:12.534, Speaker B: If you are an independent miner mining at home, or you have just like, you're not massive, you generally join a mining pool. Almost everyone joins a mining pool. You just smoothed out your payouts that way. You group together so that instead of like once a year, you receive two eth, you get a regular payout of like 0.1 eth. Every bit of time, every time you accrue a balance. And so I remember doing this when I would mine with nanopool.
00:19:12.534 - 00:19:42.450, Speaker B: And so every time my threshold, my balance would hit 0.2 eth, I would get a payout. It would go to my wallet, and Nanopool would pay me out. They would mine the block, they would get all the rewards, and they would pay me for my hash power. That's how a mining pool works. And so all these individual miners are getting paid smaller microtransactions on chain as miners are paid out. And so this was a huge part apparently of Ethereum blocks based consumption of just regular ether payments to miners all over the world as they comprise these mining pools.
00:19:42.450 - 00:20:04.080, Speaker B: So eliminating the proof of work mining also eliminated all of these highly regular micro ether payments to all these miners all across the world. And so that's a big reason as to why gas prices have been down so much post merge is because we are no longer paying out like thousands and thousands and thousands of miners all at once all over the world. People forgot to consider this.
00:20:05.250 - 00:20:09.566, Speaker A: So the take here is the merge made Ethereum transactions cheap. What is the gas price right now?
00:20:09.588 - 00:20:10.010, Speaker B: David?
00:20:10.090 - 00:20:10.794, Speaker A: 15 Gwe.
00:20:10.842 - 00:20:32.834, Speaker B: 15 Gwe. Yeah, we actually had a huge spike an hour ago. Actually, I think I put that into the weekly roll up. Yeah, you're about to click on that tweet. So we had an NFT drop, I think, I believe gas price hit 100 gwe. It was between 61 hundred gwe for a good almost hour or so. And the cool thing is that we burned about 8 hours worth of ether inside of 40 blocks.
00:20:32.834 - 00:21:12.046, Speaker B: So like in five to ten minutes we burned 8 hours worth of ether issuance. And this is a point I've been trying to drive home. We could go like a year of inflationary ether and then if another NFT market or NFT bull or defi season, whatever happened, we could burn all of that inflated issued ether for the last year inside of two weeks if the gas markets pick up again. And so Dom, I'll shout out to Dom, but this is going to be the last time I shout this out because I'm totally going to take all future credit for this. Dom in my replies said, capped issuance, uncapped burn. Nice job, Dom. Capped issuance, uncapped burn.
00:21:12.046 - 00:21:15.730, Speaker B: And so that's a great way of illustrating the monetary system of ether.
00:21:16.390 - 00:21:23.238, Speaker A: And Dom, every time David tries to steal that from you, I'm going to remind folks where it came from. Okay, that's yours, Dom, take that.
00:21:23.324 - 00:21:49.406, Speaker B: The other interesting thing I saw this week is back onto that ultrasound money supply growth chart. You can actually flip back to the actual website. You can see the days of the week in the ether issuance. And so you see in the left hand of that curve that waviness where the mornings people wake up and they do some transactions. And then the weekends ether gets issued because gas markets are depressed. It's depressed. This week was almost an ultrasound week.
00:21:49.406 - 00:22:07.082, Speaker B: It looks like it's capped over the last like five or six days. So there hasn't been much issuance over the last five or six days. And it's the difference between the weekends, where the wavy parts, where you get the congestion, the rush hour, if you will, of ethereum, versus the weekdays. Excuse me. The weekdays are where you get the rush hour, the weekends are where you get the supply.
00:22:07.246 - 00:22:12.950, Speaker A: Wait, you say on ethereum we're bankless, yet we're keeping banker hours? Like, we don't do gas transactions.
00:22:13.450 - 00:22:17.640, Speaker B: The society organizes around human economic activity. Okay.
00:22:18.730 - 00:22:19.754, Speaker A: Take holidays off.
00:22:19.792 - 00:22:37.440, Speaker B: Exactly. The expressways on highways go point in certain directions based on user demand. Right. And so I just think it's cool that ethereum is such a finely tuned machine that you can see the days of the week on the supply growth chart, which I think is illustrative of a great system.
00:22:38.370 - 00:22:53.566, Speaker A: Great system. Absolutely. Really cool. David, let's talk about one of the other pieces of meta we think might exist during this bear market season that we're in. And that is an emphasis on protocol, profitability.
00:22:53.678 - 00:22:54.194, Speaker B: Love it.
00:22:54.232 - 00:23:26.318, Speaker A: This is a really good dashboard put together by the folks at token terminal, and it shows the earnings of all sorts of different DFI and layer one protocols. I think actually only Ethereum. Ethereum is the only layer one here. I haven't been able to see the others, but you can actually look at this on a 24 hours day time horizon, a seven day time horizon, 30, all the way out to kind of max and see. Let's look, over the last week, Ethereum earned negative $5 million.
00:23:26.404 - 00:23:27.840, Speaker B: Negative $5 million.
00:23:28.370 - 00:24:03.238, Speaker A: It's not profitable, but that was a lot worse previously when it was issuing so much. So the way you get profits, of course, is like, what are the revenue? What's the revenue of a blockchain? Blockchains sell blocks, as we've said so many times. So the revenue is burnt eth, essentially, and fees as a result of payment for blocks. And the cost is the issuance itself. And so the earnings over the long run of ETH look real bad. Negative $21 billion in ETH issuance that went to miners.
00:24:03.334 - 00:24:11.802, Speaker B: This is why miners are so toxic. Sorry to cut you off, but this is $21.7 billion that got handed to miners. So miners got all that money.
00:24:11.936 - 00:24:38.990, Speaker A: They got all that money. It was very expensive is what we would say. It was like a combustion engine relative to a new engine that gets far more electric. And so we have other d five protocols as well. And you can look, the last seven days, opensea made 2 million in earnings. DydX, we've got metamask here, we've got magic Eden here, Lido finance. What do you make of this dashboard and earnings in general? David?
00:24:39.070 - 00:24:57.994, Speaker B: So the first thing I'm noticing on the right side, the earnings is like, there's a lot of red. Ethereum negative $343,000,000 over the last 30 days. That's because a lot of the last 30 days had proof of work issuance. But uniswap negative $302. I mean, $302, whatever. Openc made $904,000,000. That's why it's a good business.
00:24:57.994 - 00:25:08.750, Speaker B: Lido, negative 5.9. Convex finance, negative 2.8 Ave, negative 72,000. So not, not that that much. GMX, negative 3.4. DyDX, negative 3.8 million.
00:25:08.750 - 00:25:34.902, Speaker B: Lots of negatives. Lots of negatives. They're all red. The next era of crypto and crypto is going to die if these things don't flip green. They have to flip green at some point in time. And I think this is going to be the crescendo of the next bull market, is that slowly one of these orgs figures out their issuance, their costs, their revenues, and it flips green. And then the next one flips green, and then the next one flips green.
00:25:34.902 - 00:26:04.030, Speaker B: And this is going to trigger the next bull market is that these things all start to flip green and their earnings outweigh their costs. We already have a decent number of things that have flipped green. Opensea metamask. They're a centralized company, so they don't have, like, protocol issuance. But makerdao green, perpetual protocol green, one inch green. Arbitrum green, magic, Eden green. But then if you keep on scrolling down, it's just like red, red token issuance, yield farming, like Dow payments, yield incentives, blah, blah, blah, blah.
00:26:04.030 - 00:26:12.482, Speaker B: Make it green. If you're part of the Dow, that's red, go into your Dow and start making it green so we can have our bull market back. That's what you need to do.
00:26:12.616 - 00:26:20.594, Speaker A: Go find profit. I think there's some gems here, too, to be looking at from an investment perspective is investing in profitable protocols. Might be some alpha.
00:26:20.722 - 00:26:23.138, Speaker B: David, could you imagine?
00:26:23.234 - 00:26:48.314, Speaker A: Yeah. Can you imagine a crypto protocol that actually makes money? David, we got a lot coming up next. Number one, the CFTC is attacking dows next. Did our good regulator just turn bad? Did they go the way of the SEC? And also, we're going to talk more about the NFT industry, how it's exploding in activity. Guys, we'll be right back with the rest of the roll up. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode.
00:26:48.362 - 00:27:43.262, Speaker B: Possible Juno is bringing crypto friendly banking straight into your checking account. With Juno, you can send money from your Juno checking account straight onto a L2 like polygon optimism arbitrum, and they have Zksync and Starknet support on their way. You can skip the Ach wait times, you can skip all the gas fees and go straight from your checking account to an Ethereum L2 in seconds. Inside Juno, you can buy and sell crypto with zero dollar fees, and your Juno checking account comes with a metal Mastercard that gives you up to 5% cash back on your spending. Juno is also giving you $10 cash back on your first crypto deposit, and $100 when you set up a direct deposit. This ad just writes itself, so go sign up at Juno finance Bankless Zksync is an Ethereum L2 network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization. Zksync has combined the power of zero knowledge rollups and the Ethereum virtual machine, enabling developers to build the greatest web3 project possible ones we haven't even seen yet.
00:27:43.262 - 00:28:29.486, Speaker B: Crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world, but crypto killer apps need Zksync as a platform to build on first. It's generally accepted that zero knowledge roll ups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology. And Zksync is leading the charge into the final frontier of crypto economics. So if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof foundation which gives your users the best UX possible, check out Zksync's website at zksync IO. And yes, there's also going to be a token, so give them a follow on Twitter too. At zksync, the CFTC charges Okie Dow for an illegal offering of off chain digital asset trading, registration violations and failing to comply with the Bank Secrecy act. All normal things to charge something for if they did all that stuff.
00:28:29.486 - 00:28:56.166, Speaker B: But they charged a DaO and they're going after token holders, which is very new and very different and puts forth an interesting premise that the CFTC will actually have to prove in court that DAO token holders did these things. But that is exactly what the CFTC is going to try and do. Apparently they are trying to sue a Dow. How that is going to work will be interesting.
00:28:56.348 - 00:28:59.246, Speaker A: I was pretty stunned by this last week when I saw these tweets.
00:28:59.378 - 00:29:00.358, Speaker B: Pretty disappointed.
00:29:00.454 - 00:29:54.374, Speaker A: This is the filing itself. And so the CFTC, which is the commodity Futures Trading Commission of course, they regulate commodities in the US and I guess their brother organization is the SEC, which regulates securities. They just issued an order and a filing to charge b zero x bz, also known as Okie Dow. It's one of the same thing, I guess they rebranded. And so they are charging the founders, Tom Bean and Kyle Kissner, for illegally offering leveraged and margin retail commodity transactions in digital assets, engaging in activities only registered futures CFTC merchants can perform, and failing to adopt a customer identification program as part of the Bank Secrecy act compliance program. So these are the charges laid. That in itself is somewhat surprising.
00:29:54.374 - 00:30:45.898, Speaker A: I'm not sure exactly what BX was into and up to. And the most surprising part about it was not the charges, but who the charges are laid against. This is a tweet from Carlo Eth. Yesterday, the CFTC filed a declaration informing the court that it seeks to essentially charge every voting member of Oki DAo via its chat bot and forum posts. So the CFTC filed a lawsuit against members of the DAO itself. This is a stunning new development for the space, because if approved by the court, it will create legal precedent allowing regulators to claim proof of service of a legal action against every member of the decentralized entity, every member of the DAO. Via notice to its website, the CFTC claims that it got confirmation that members were served by monitoring the chat posts between DAO members.
00:30:45.898 - 00:31:19.842, Speaker A: It remains to be seen how the DAO members will mobilize and fight and respond. Stay tuned for more. So the CFTC was actually monitoring chat posts between DAO members. And they are not only charging the founders of this protocol, they are charging individuals inside of the DAO, particularly those individuals who voted in governance of this protocol. That, to me, David, is absolutely stunning. And it is completely unclear that they have jurisdiction over this. This is really a regulation by enforcement type of move by the CFTC.
00:31:19.842 - 00:31:49.920, Speaker A: What's interesting here, David, is, as you were alluding to earlier, the CFTC has traditionally been kind of crypto forward, crypto friendly, curiously innovative. Well, it seemed like the SEC to date has been much more aggressive, a much more aggressive and hostile and unclear take on the crypto industry writ large. We haven't previously seen that from the CFTC. And so this is kind of a stunning move, and I was very surprised to see it.
00:31:50.370 - 00:32:46.998, Speaker B: Yeah, this is going to take a while to unpack. There's a lot of things to think about here. I'll always stand by what I say, which is, if it can be regulated, then it should be regulated. And so it's interesting to watch the attempt of the CFTC to regulate a Dow just because something is a DAO doesn't mean it has immunity, right? And so if the DAO is doing illegal stuff and those members of that dow are like KYC and identified and known to the CFTC, that gives the CFTC kind of the surface area they need to go after the BZX entity like the DAO itself, if they're going after the individual members. So they're not like taking the like, llc to court, because that's not an entity, that's what a DAO is. But they are taking individual members and leadership of the DAO and going after them, which kind of effectively is the same thing. Kind of even scarier if there's no limited liability corporation protecting these individuals.
00:32:46.998 - 00:32:59.734, Speaker B: All I see here, Ryan, is there's probably members of the DAO that are anonymous that the CFTC can't go after because they don't know who they are. All this is doing is promoting and incentivizing anonymity, which is probably bad.
00:32:59.852 - 00:34:09.130, Speaker A: I think it's pushing anonymity. It's also pushing defi innovation outside of the borders of the US, because why would you do this as a us citizen? This is Jake Trevinsky's take. The CFTC's BZX enforcement action may be the most egregious example of regulation by enforcement in the history of crypto. We've complained at length about the SEC abusing this tactic, but the CFTC has put them to shame. Wow, strong words coming from Jake, he continues, it's deeply disappointing to see the CFTC damage its own reputation like this among those who care about the future of crypto in the United States, especially at a critical moment while it pitches itself to Congress as the right agency to regulate digital commodity trades. This is kind of like the Obi Wan and Anakin meme of like, you were the chosen one. And the CFTC has previously almost promoted itself to Congress and legislators as the group that could both support the regulatory ambitions of the US, but also foster innovation for crypto and feels like we're almost trading one devil for the other if this is the kind of action they're going to take against the crypto industry.
00:34:09.130 - 00:34:16.382, Speaker A: But here's a bright side. David, I want you to read this tweet from Wches eth. Sure.
00:34:16.436 - 00:34:44.306, Speaker B: He says a court has to agree with the CFTC for these theories about Dao liability for a token to be meaningful. Basically, if you own the token, are you a DAO member? Dow leader, DAo executor the bill continues and says that's not going to be an easy fight for the CFTC. Chill out, everyone. The world hasn't ended, so this is opening a door. But there's still so much left to unpack. What is behind this door. So this is going to be an ongoing saga.
00:34:44.418 - 00:35:21.858, Speaker A: It's another example of this all gets settled in courts. I guess we're seeing more of that. There's also a silver lining settled in courts, right? There's also a silver lining that there was a commissioner, summer Mersinger, who dissented, and Hester Purr style, she wrote an entire dissent on the CFTC's action. Of course, she is a commissioner, so she is a representative of the CFTC. But why don't you read her statement here, David is basically under the headline, it didn't have to be this way. And she's talking to her own organization by saying that it didn't have to be this way. What does she say?
00:35:21.944 - 00:35:54.506, Speaker B: Yeah, basically she says one small paragraph in the longer dissenting statement says, unfortunately, I cannot support the commission's approach to this particular matter. While I do not condone individuals or entities blatantly violating the CEA or our rules, we cannot arbitrarily decide who is accountable for these violations based on an unsupported legal theory amounting to regulation by enforcement while federal and state policy is developing. For these reasons, I am respectfully dissenting in this matter. Thank you, Summer. Thank you. Appreciate it. This was surprising out of the CFTC.
00:35:54.506 - 00:36:17.934, Speaker B: Like we said, CFTC has always been like the good guy in stark contrast to the CSEC. So I'm kind of hoping this is a little bit of not a mistake. But just like, since it's out of character, the CFTC has more like, we know Gary Genzer is coming after us. This could be an anomaly out of the CFTC. And that is like, perhaps my fingers crossed, silver lining. This is an anomaly.
00:36:18.062 - 00:36:37.978, Speaker A: I think that's a good take, and that's a hopeful take. I also wonder, I have another take on this, and this might be a more pessimistic take on it, and that is that the CFTC is getting drained of its crypto friendly advocates. So Brian Quintons left the CFTC. He was formerly a commissioner in the.
00:36:37.984 - 00:36:40.230, Speaker B: CFTC, now works in crypto.
00:36:40.310 - 00:37:22.698, Speaker A: He now works in crypto. We've also had Christian Carlo, who is the former head of the CFTC, on the podcast. He was very crypto friendly. He kind of consults and works in crypto. And so I wonder if the only regulators that are left standing or soon to be left standing will be crypto unfriendly regulators, because those that have kind of caught the crypto bug and see the vision for this thing are just like, I don't want to stick around this age that's prosecuting crypto, I'm going to get into. So I wonder if that's partially what's happening as well. This is, of course, just Ryan's speculation, but that would be a more pessimistic reading of what's going on.
00:37:22.784 - 00:37:28.422, Speaker B: I can definitely see that take that. It seems like a very reasonable take, which is extremely bearish.
00:37:28.486 - 00:37:30.522, Speaker A: It's kind of like crypto is so.
00:37:30.576 - 00:37:37.422, Speaker B: Bullish and such a magnet for talent that it takes all the people that see it away from the regulators where we need them to be.
00:37:37.476 - 00:38:00.034, Speaker A: Well, there's this warped view, I think, among regulators, too. Do you remember when they were talking about preparing the White House reports on crypto, and anyone who owned crypto assets actually had to recuse themselves from that? And so that means all of the people who actually understand crypto, like all of the crypto, if you understand crypto, you're probably going to want to own some crypto.
00:38:00.082 - 00:38:00.438, Speaker B: Right?
00:38:00.524 - 00:38:31.722, Speaker A: By nature, the way it works, that's kind of the way it works. But now everyone who understands crypto and holds crypto has to now recuse themselves from the process. I mean, it's almost, to me, it's just like asking everyone who holds dollars to recuse themselves from some sort of legislation impacting just, you're going to eliminate everyone that kind of understands how the dollar system works. Anyway, that might be what we're up against, but let's move on to some more optimistic takes. David, NFts are back, baby. What's going on with Fidenzas?
00:38:31.866 - 00:38:36.174, Speaker B: You remember the name Tyler Hobbs? Ryan Tyler Hobbs, the creator of Fidenzas.
00:38:36.302 - 00:38:39.346, Speaker A: I don't remember him, but I do remember Fidenzas, certainly.
00:38:39.448 - 00:39:07.030, Speaker B: Yeah. So he is the creator of Fidenzas, coming out with his second generative art collection, 900 new nfTs. And he just finished a sale at 14 e each. So he raised revenue, made money of 12,600 ether inside of the sale, $17.6 million in a bear market. And Ryan, they are beautiful. They are beautiful nfTs.
00:39:07.030 - 00:39:42.562, Speaker B: If you are into this game of generative art, ooh, that one is great. They're looking like kind of like patterned embroidery, like seashell art kind of thing for the podcast listeners out there. But there is some new mechanisms at play here. And so this isn't just another art blocks drop that somehow did very, very well. This is a brand new style of drop where there was something called like a strike price, where you could bid how much ether you're willing to pay for an NFT, and then there would be one price selected after the fact, and everyone would pay that same price. And if you overbid, you got some of your ether back. So that was a cool mechanism.
00:39:42.562 - 00:40:28.146, Speaker B: And then also you get to mint your own NFT. So the people that bought what these things are, they actually bought a mint pass, not the actual NFT themselves. And so minting will start soon, but if you have a mint pass, you can go into this kind of create your own, build an NFT algorithm workshop. So the minter and the artist in the algorithm are all having this three way relationship. And so as a mint pass owner, you can start to tinker with some dials and make your NFT look a particular way, and then you get to mint it, which is kind of cool. But overall, I think the big takeaway is that Tyler Hobbes, creator of Fidenzas, had an absolutely massively successful NFt drop with this QQL art drop. That's what it's called, QQL.
00:40:28.146 - 00:40:35.590, Speaker B: Raising $17.6 million in the middle of an era where people thought that art blocks, specifically art blocks, were dead.
00:40:35.930 - 00:40:43.478, Speaker A: That's really impressive. I would not have guessed it, not in this economy. David, how about Christie's? They're doing something with NFTs.
00:40:43.574 - 00:40:51.898, Speaker B: Yeah, Christie's. Christie's. They were the place, the auction house that sold the beeple art for 669 million dollars. Remember that, Ryan?
00:40:51.994 - 00:40:52.398, Speaker A: Yes.
00:40:52.484 - 00:41:25.030, Speaker B: This is awesome. We're just recapping the bull market right now. Chrissy's announced the first ever global auction house to host fully on chain sales on Ethereum. So according to Chrissy's, all transactions on this new platform, including after an auction, will be recorded on Ethereum. And all requisite transactions and compliance tools also integrated, streamlining the process that it was at times a strange hybrid of crypto tech and 20th century bureaucracy. In the early days of the NFT boom, the launch of Christie's 3.0 can be seen.
00:41:25.030 - 00:41:53.406, Speaker B: I'm reading from the announcement here, the launch of Christie's 3.0 can be seen as a direct result of the Beeple sale, in which Christie's accepted cryptocurrency ether and allowed buyers to transfer the crypto to the auction house directly from their digital wallets. That sale was orchestrated in part by Christie's specialist Noah Davis who subsequently left this firm to go work for yuga Labs, now pioneering the crypto punks. And then also from the Christie's website, here's where it gets really, really cool. Straight on the website. What is Christie's 3.0? Christie's 3.0
00:41:53.406 - 00:42:29.638, Speaker B: is an onchain auction platform dedicated to exceptional NFT art. Whether you are new to NFTs or already a committed member of the community, discover and bid on exclusive drops curated by Christie's. And then there's the question, like, how do I buy? To bid on Christie's 30 auctions, you need to connect a digital wallet. For the best experience, we recommend connecting via a desktop browser using a browser extension such as metamask or Coinbase. After you connected your wallet, you can then set up a Christie's 30 account. If you're already a Christie's client, you'll be able to bid without further identity verification. If you're a new user, it will ask you to verify your identity.
00:42:29.638 - 00:42:45.290, Speaker B: Once verified, you are good to go. So metamask, Coinbase integration into Christies, add some kYc and boom, you are making bids on the Christie's virtual metaverse auction house. Wow, that's pretty cool. And also the website looks fantastic.
00:42:45.370 - 00:43:09.898, Speaker A: This is just right in the art world, right? Christie says, probably at the center of the art auction house world. And they're basically pivoting and they're saying, stake in the ground, our new auction house, all of our resources are going to be in crypto based on Ethereum. Look at this question from the faqs, David. What currencies can I use on Christie's 30? Christie's 30 accepts Ethereum eth. That's it.
00:43:09.984 - 00:43:11.180, Speaker B: That's the whole thing.
00:43:11.870 - 00:43:34.146, Speaker A: This is like NFTs being denominated in ether once again and blows my mind. If we didn't just live through a crazy NFT bull market, and you had told me two years ago that there would be such a website and this would be in Christie's faq, I would have been over the moon excited about the adoption. And because I think this is happening during a bear market, no one really notices, right? Life goes on.
00:43:34.248 - 00:44:24.190, Speaker B: So, Ryan, this to me, here's the most bullish scenario for this. The normal Christie's business continues to go on the regular fiat, like paintings, physical paintings, analog art, that's still going to go on. But there's also infrastructure for normal analog art to receive a digital correlate, a digital version of itself. And the reason why this is so bullish for Christie's, like this auction house is because the Internet is global, right? You have more market participants because they don't have to leave their own home. They use Internet rails like Ethereum to get money into Christie's. Who can participate in this? In Christie's 3.0 versus the actual physical Christie's is orders of magnitude, the scale of the Internet, right? And so you can totally and easily see analog art starting to be auctioned off on Chrissy's 3.0
00:44:24.190 - 00:44:46.006, Speaker B: because of the global liquidity of ether and accessibility. And so I think this is going to start as normal nfts as we know them, but it's going to also start to bleed into like regular boomer analog art also auctioned off on this platform. And eventually the art market, the physical art market is just going to be consumed by the digital art market because that's how technology works. Software eats everything.
00:44:46.188 - 00:45:07.198, Speaker A: Yeah, totally agree guys. More hot NFT news coming up next. This has been NFT week, NFT bull week. I think Disney's doubling down on nfts and so they've just revealed some big things we're going to talk about. Also, Apple wants a ginormous cut of all NFT sales. What are they talking about? Tim Cook, what are you doing? We'll talk about that. There's so much activity, guys.
00:45:07.198 - 00:45:11.486, Speaker A: We will be right back. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:45:11.588 - 00:45:50.726, Speaker B: Rocket pool is your friendly, decentralized Ethereum staking protocol. You can stake your ETH with rocket Pool and get our ETH in return, allowing you to stake your ETH and use it in DFI at the same time. You can get 4% on your ETH by staking it with rocket pool, but you can get even more by running a node. Rocket Pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes. Running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node, and you only need 16 e to get started. Why would you do this? You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled ETH, so your API is boosted. So if you're bullish eth staking, you can increase your API and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network, which currently has over 1000 independent validators.
00:45:50.726 - 00:46:10.046, Speaker B: It's yield farming, but with Ethereum nodes you can get started@rocketpool.net and also join the rocket pool community in their discord. You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there. Lens Protocol is an open source tech stack for building decentralized social media applications. It is the new era for social media. We all have toxic relationships with our web two apps. We want to break up with them, but we can't.
00:46:10.046 - 00:46:32.574, Speaker B: These applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made. We need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us. Lens isn't a social media app. It's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps bloom. Lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user. In crypto, we say, not your keys, not your crypto. And on lens we say, not your keys, not your profile.
00:46:32.574 - 00:47:31.002, Speaker B: With lens, your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use. And instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app, lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media. Lens is the last social media handle that you'll ever need to create. So in order to get started, there is a secret code word in the show notes. Enter that code word in the Google form link and you'll be well on your way to entering the world of web3. Social Disney is revealing some of its intentions with a job listing because they are looking to hire a principal counsel specializing in NFTs, the metaverse, blockchain technology, and decentralized finance to guide the company through what appears to be its coming and aggressive push into web3. So there's a job posting for this position explaining that the attorney, the name of this position, will provide legal advice and support for global NFT products made in collaboration with Disney Media and entertainment distribution, as well as Disney parks experience and products.
00:47:31.002 - 00:47:36.170, Speaker B: Ryan to me that sounds like the full thing. That sounds like the whole of Disney.
00:47:36.250 - 00:47:39.934, Speaker A: Marvel, Disney, the princesses. It's all of it.
00:47:40.052 - 00:48:32.666, Speaker B: And additionally, the announcement continues, or the article continues. The principal counsel will provide day to day legal advice to Disney legal and business teams on NFT and cryptocurrency related matters and issues, and provide thought, leadership and strategic direction on products involving digital currency and blockchain technology. Wow, that doesn't sound like a hey, who's some zoomer millennial kid who knows about nfTs? This sounds like hey, who is an operator who's done some awesome bang up job in the web two space that is all super knowledgeable about NFTs and wants to lead the entire Disney company into this nft thing. So this is going to be a huge hire. Congratulations ahead of time to whoever lands this job, it's going to be some chad, probably. And wow, think about the surface area between Disney and NFTs. It's got to be infinite.
00:48:32.698 - 00:48:59.462, Speaker A: Yeah. I think one thing we've been talking so much about building through the bear market, right? And when I think of builders, I think of just all of the DeFi builders that we've had on the know, the Hayden Adams and the Stannis and the Kane Warwicks and all of these people, of course. But this season of the bear market, it's actually companies. It's actually corporations that were. Huh. That NfT thing was incredible. And we know it's not over.
00:48:59.462 - 00:49:21.070, Speaker A: And so now we just saw Christie's open up their auction house in the bear market. Now we're seeing Disney doubling down and hiring a strategic position to guide all of their global NFT efforts during the bear market. Right. These companies are building during the bear market as well. And I think we'll see the fruits of that on the other side when things get frothy again.
00:49:21.220 - 00:49:43.560, Speaker B: Ryan, I remember your take that NFTs are less threatening to the web two traditional world than DFI is to the banks. DFI disrupts the banks, NFTs enhances the rest of the world. And I think we are definitely seeing that take play out. And now as a DFI bro, I'm like, damn, those NFT people are having a lot of fun.
00:49:44.650 - 00:49:51.078, Speaker A: That's all right. You're an NFT bro, too, if you want to be. David, what's this? The Patriots with NFTs?
00:49:51.254 - 00:49:58.122, Speaker B: Yeah, the New England Patriots. For the international listeners, that's a football team. Sorry, an american football team.
00:49:58.176 - 00:49:58.730, Speaker A: Yes.
00:49:58.880 - 00:50:02.330, Speaker B: Headline reads. Well, no, not soccer.
00:50:02.490 - 00:50:03.626, Speaker A: Yes, not soccer.
00:50:03.738 - 00:50:04.266, Speaker B: Not soccer.
00:50:04.298 - 00:50:04.638, Speaker A: Yes.
00:50:04.724 - 00:50:28.630, Speaker B: NFT software company chain inks four year deal with the New England Patriots, a deal with craft group, which I'm not familiar with. Who makes chain the official blockchain and web3 sponsor of the Patriots, the New England revolution, Gillette Stadium and Patriot Place. So the Patriots football team has an official blockchain and web3 sponsorship in the craft group.
00:50:28.700 - 00:50:31.590, Speaker A: David, who's your favorite player on the Patriots?
00:50:33.290 - 00:50:35.634, Speaker B: Is Tom Brady on the Patriots?
00:50:35.682 - 00:50:37.560, Speaker A: I'm going to say yes because I have no idea.
00:50:37.930 - 00:50:41.858, Speaker B: Well, first off, he's definitely not. My favorite player is Tom Brady.
00:50:41.954 - 00:50:43.174, Speaker A: It's just the only one that.
00:50:43.212 - 00:50:44.182, Speaker B: David, who does.
00:50:44.236 - 00:50:47.750, Speaker A: Tom, huge football fans on bankless.
00:50:48.410 - 00:50:52.270, Speaker B: He plays for. Oh, he's now on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. When the hell did that?
00:50:52.420 - 00:50:54.110, Speaker A: We're about to get destroyed in the.
00:50:54.260 - 00:50:55.710, Speaker B: Oh, we are going to get. Absolutely.
00:50:55.860 - 00:50:56.766, Speaker A: Should we cut hang on.
00:50:56.788 - 00:50:59.082, Speaker B: Can I make sure that he was actually on the Patriots?
00:50:59.146 - 00:51:03.040, Speaker A: You better have been, or we're definitely cutting this. This is not making a show for this. Wrong.
00:51:05.010 - 00:51:06.874, Speaker B: Yeah, it was a Patriots. It was a Patriots.
00:51:06.922 - 00:51:14.354, Speaker A: I got that. We just don't keep up with football all the time since crypto. That's all it is.
00:51:14.472 - 00:51:16.686, Speaker B: You want to hear a fun fact, Ryan, about football?
00:51:16.798 - 00:51:17.266, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:17.368 - 00:51:19.030, Speaker B: I played on my high school's football team.
00:51:19.100 - 00:51:21.366, Speaker A: You did? Yeah. What position?
00:51:21.548 - 00:51:23.010, Speaker B: Wide receiver and kicker.
00:51:23.090 - 00:51:25.782, Speaker A: Wow. Was it fun? Were you good?
00:51:25.916 - 00:51:37.980, Speaker B: No, I was a good kicker. I was super good kicker. I was called kicker. That's what they called me. That was my name on the team. They called me kicker. And it wasn't endearing, let me tell you.
00:51:38.430 - 00:51:47.230, Speaker A: Kicker. Get the water for us. That's awesome, David. Punks are still hot, too. More NFT boldishness.
00:51:47.970 - 00:52:10.866, Speaker B: A crypto punk 2924, aka an ape hoodie punk. If you're in the punk world, you know, both apes are extremely rare and a hoodie is a well sought after property. Was sold for $4.4 million. Casual. Casual cryptopunk sale. I will say, like, when I bought my cryptopunk, it was like, all right, I'm not that much of an NFT bro, but I want to have exposure.
00:52:10.866 - 00:52:26.086, Speaker B: So I'll just buy this crypto punk because it feels safe. It feels like buying bitcoin after its second bubble, which is way safer than buying after its first bubble because you don't if it's ever going to come back. So, yeah, now crypto punks have the Lindy effect, and so I can't wait for the third bubble of crypto.
00:52:26.118 - 00:52:33.626, Speaker A: Well, I bet you're like, this is the kind of headline straight from the bull market. It almost feels like an anachronism. It almost feels completely out of place here. Right?
00:52:33.648 - 00:52:38.510, Speaker B: Yeah. Except that 3300 ETH in the bull market would have been like $20 million, not $4.4 million.
00:52:38.580 - 00:52:46.802, Speaker A: That is true. There's still a lot of ETH. Right. And if you're buying for ETH denominated returns, like, crypto punks haven't gone down that bad. Denominated terms.
00:52:46.936 - 00:52:54.530, Speaker B: There's a small chance that that 3300 ether sale was also simultaneously a tax loss harvesting event for the buyer.
00:52:55.270 - 00:52:58.670, Speaker A: Okay, so this might not be as bullish as it appears.
00:52:58.750 - 00:52:59.914, Speaker B: No, I'm kidding.
00:52:59.982 - 00:53:07.190, Speaker A: By the way, I love that you have no idea what team Tom Brady plays for, but you can tell me about a hooded crypto punk and why it's valuable.
00:53:08.090 - 00:53:09.260, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
00:53:10.430 - 00:53:12.234, Speaker A: What about this is this another.
00:53:12.432 - 00:53:25.038, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw this tweet. Yeah. So Pablo Pacanso eth, great name, by the way, retweets the sale of this crypto punk and says, five years ago, I sold this crypto punk for one, $400.
00:53:25.124 - 00:53:25.786, Speaker A: Ouch.
00:53:25.898 - 00:53:29.134, Speaker B: Wow. No, sorry, Pablo. Okay.
00:53:29.252 - 00:53:30.858, Speaker A: He's got a crypto punk in his profile.
00:53:30.954 - 00:53:40.882, Speaker B: He's got a great punk in his profile. Yeah, but remember, you can't really hate on when you sell something five years ago. Plus, you don't know you can't hate on it. But Pablo, that's a fun fact.
00:53:41.016 - 00:53:41.506, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:41.608 - 00:53:42.594, Speaker B: I hope you feel good about it.
00:53:42.632 - 00:53:52.438, Speaker A: Everyone has mistakes in crypto. Bury those mistakes deep down, never think about them. That's my strategy for coping. All the things I've missed. David, how many things have you missed? Oh, my God, I've missed so many things.
00:53:52.604 - 00:53:55.910, Speaker B: I've missed zero things. There's not a single thing that I've.
00:53:56.730 - 00:54:04.970, Speaker A: Well, bring that alpha to me, man, because I've missed a lot over the years. But you didn't miss this on Instagram. This is from your Instagram. I think this is a recording. What are we looking at?
00:54:05.040 - 00:54:21.806, Speaker B: Yeah, this is one of my friends. This is the first time I saw this. We reported on nfts on Instagram a while ago, but it was with very select artists. And so this is the first nft that I've seen in my own personal Instagram feed. In the wild. Yeah. And so it's nice because it's a cool cat.
00:54:21.806 - 00:54:30.820, Speaker B: So we're looking at a cool cat here. But, you know, it's an NFT because these NFTs in Instagram have a little shine to them. They kind of, like, shine. They gloss over.
00:54:31.990 - 00:54:34.334, Speaker A: Is this the gradient you're talking about? Is that the shine?
00:54:34.382 - 00:54:36.834, Speaker B: Well, you need to play it because this is a video, so you need to play it. But here.
00:54:36.872 - 00:54:37.186, Speaker A: There it is.
00:54:37.208 - 00:54:38.238, Speaker B: Oh, I see a little shine.
00:54:38.334 - 00:54:39.070, Speaker A: Little glimmer.
00:54:39.150 - 00:54:39.454, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:39.512 - 00:54:40.982, Speaker A: Only nfts get that.
00:54:41.116 - 00:54:55.018, Speaker B: Only nfts get that. Yes, exactly. That's right. This is a screen cap recording, so we can't do this. But there's a little digital collectible tab in the bottom left of the NFT. And if you tap on that, it tells you what ethereum address owns. It's on ethereum, yeah.
00:54:55.018 - 00:54:56.234, Speaker B: And who owns it?
00:54:56.272 - 00:55:01.370, Speaker A: Yeah, this is still, like, I think, beta launch. So it's not available to everyone?
00:55:01.520 - 00:55:17.334, Speaker B: It's available to everyone, yeah. So I was going to screen record my profile of, like, you can go down into. Okay, so here's how you do this. Everyone pull out your Instagram and follow along. If you have an Instagram, you go and you go to your profile. The bottom in the bottom right. And then you hit the menu.
00:55:17.334 - 00:55:26.782, Speaker B: I'm doing it on my phone so the listeners and viewers can follow along your profile. And then the top right, the drop down menu, the menu button. And there is a digital collectibles.
00:55:26.926 - 00:55:28.134, Speaker A: I see it. Oh, my God.
00:55:28.172 - 00:55:31.366, Speaker B: Digital collectibles. It is rolled out to absolutely everyone.
00:55:31.468 - 00:55:39.802, Speaker A: Share digital collectibles with followers and fans. Connect to digital wallet. So I click, get started. I hit tap. Get started. Connect. Oh, my God.
00:55:39.802 - 00:55:43.206, Speaker A: Coin. Metamask. Metamask. Rainbow.
00:55:43.318 - 00:55:43.834, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:55:43.952 - 00:55:44.330, Speaker A: What?
00:55:44.400 - 00:55:45.050, Speaker B: How awesome.
00:55:45.120 - 00:56:03.246, Speaker A: Dude, this is bear market stuff, man. I was just saying corporations are building. This is meta. How many billions of users they have, like two point something. They have almost all of the humans at this point in time. I'm literally connecting my metamask. And you see this panda behind me?
00:56:03.348 - 00:56:08.318, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, you have it on your metamask. I was going to do this with my crypto punk, but my cryptopunk is not on a hot wallet.
00:56:08.334 - 00:56:11.602, Speaker A: Here's the thing, I'm super private with my Instagram. Like, I have it locked down.
00:56:11.656 - 00:56:13.954, Speaker B: Yeah, you don't even have me on there.
00:56:14.152 - 00:56:16.338, Speaker A: I don't? Yeah, I don't.
00:56:16.434 - 00:56:26.754, Speaker B: I've noticed it's super locked down because so is mine. That's why I didn't put up my own Instagram account or follow David.
00:56:26.882 - 00:56:27.938, Speaker A: Follow David.
00:56:28.114 - 00:56:32.586, Speaker B: Don't follow me. I delete it. I have less than 500 followers because I delete everyone.
00:56:32.688 - 00:56:38.410, Speaker A: Well, when are you going to change that, though? Now you could be an NFT influencer. Instagram? No, not going to happen.
00:56:38.480 - 00:56:39.690, Speaker B: No, Twitter only.
00:56:39.760 - 00:56:43.706, Speaker A: Twitter is for, like, business is crypto. Instagram is for friends. That's just my life.
00:56:43.728 - 00:56:48.222, Speaker B: That's the way I. My Instagram is specifically for people I have met in real life.
00:56:48.276 - 00:56:49.342, Speaker A: Yeah, there you go.
00:56:49.476 - 00:56:56.686, Speaker B: And the last time I talked about this on bankless, I got roughly like 300 follows on my Instagram account. I was like, you guys didn't fucking listen. Sorry.
00:56:56.788 - 00:57:05.250, Speaker A: No, this is the thing with crypto. You tell people not to do the thing, and then it makes them more bullish about doing the thing. Don't buy my token.
00:57:06.310 - 00:57:07.390, Speaker B: Don't buy my token.
00:57:07.470 - 00:57:21.594, Speaker A: Works every time. But you know what's crazy about this? Meanwhile, so we've got one tech giant which is adding nfts to their social media profile. Meanwhile, Apple wants to charge a 30% cut on all NFT sales.
00:57:21.792 - 00:57:22.502, Speaker B: Shocker.
00:57:22.566 - 00:57:40.318, Speaker A: If there's an app, like, say, openc, for example, I'm imagining that you download from the Apple Store and put that app on your iPhone. They want 30% of all of those sales. That just doesn't work in crypto. What are you guys talking about?
00:57:40.404 - 00:57:54.962, Speaker B: Do it. The fact that this was even. Openc charges 2.5%. Looksrare charges 2%. How did we ever become okay with 30%? How are we ever okay with.
00:57:55.016 - 00:58:06.550, Speaker A: Your take rate is my opportunity, right? That's the whole thing around cryptos. Like these margins. These 30% margins can't last, not in web3. We'll just bypass Apple somehow, I suppose.
00:58:08.010 - 00:58:10.314, Speaker B: The salana phone, that's what this was for, I guess.
00:58:10.352 - 00:58:25.390, Speaker A: I don't really know a viable way aside from using the open Internet, right, rather than App Stores to kind of bypass these sorts of fees. But this can't continue. But Apple thinks it can. They think they've got a monopoly on the web3 NFT space, 30%.
00:58:25.540 - 00:58:29.950, Speaker B: We'll find it. They're just going to foster more and more innovation faster.
00:58:30.370 - 00:58:41.006, Speaker A: Have you been following epic? Like Epic Games, creators of Fortnite, following it? Well, Tim Sweeney has been taking shots at Apple for a long time. There's been some beef between epic.
00:58:41.198 - 00:58:42.082, Speaker B: I remember. Yeah.
00:58:42.136 - 00:58:59.442, Speaker A: This is Tim Sweeney tweet about this 30% NFT charge. Now Apple is killing all NFT app businesses it can't tax. Crushing another nascent technology that could rival its grotesquely overpriced in app payment service. Apple must be stopped. Tim Sweeney says Apple must be stopped.
00:58:59.506 - 00:59:00.310, Speaker B: Spicy.
00:59:00.650 - 00:59:08.678, Speaker A: Well, it's hard. I mean, you talk bad about Apple, right? And what do they do? They'll delist your app, deplatform you bad to get deplatformed from Apple.
00:59:08.774 - 00:59:09.898, Speaker B: Yeah, you don't want that.
00:59:09.984 - 00:59:21.498, Speaker A: Yeah. That's another web two company we have to route around in order to make this work, make this happen. Meanwhile, David, what is the Fed doing with their central bank digital currency?
00:59:21.674 - 00:59:53.930, Speaker B: I love how the block, this is the block that tweeted this out. They added, breaking, breaking. The Fed has decided to not proceed with a digital dollar, says Powell. Breaking, which was not exactly breaking news. This has been the meme that we have been laughing about on bankless the entire time. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell says he will not push forward with a US central bank digital currency in the coming years. He says the coming years are focused on research and building public confidence in cbdcs, which is the same thing that they said last year.
00:59:53.930 - 00:59:54.986, Speaker B: Which is the same thing that they.
00:59:55.008 - 00:59:59.146, Speaker A: Said so funny the year before. Meanwhile, China keeps building yeah, exactly.
00:59:59.248 - 01:00:09.050, Speaker B: I mean, but also they don't even know this yet, but they should be saying thank God for USDC because that is the CBDC.
01:00:09.210 - 01:00:57.646, Speaker A: This is the take, I think, which is then if they're deciding not to do a central bank digital currency, then de facto they're adopting an ERC 20 stablecoin, they're adopting a USDC and something that's bank regulated and they're turning it over to the private sector because the private sector ain't going to stop. So it's all fine with me. But I think that's what they're de facto doing is the US will not have a CDBC anytime soon or its CDBC will effectively be USDC. And we should start thinking about it in those terms. David Cosmos is revamping its cosmos hub and the atom token economics. I haven't read this full paper, but I do know we are having the Cosmos folks on the podcast recording tomorrow. I think that episode is going to come out in a couple of weeks or so.
01:00:57.646 - 01:01:05.166, Speaker A: So I don't know the details here, but I'm actually pretty excited about what the cosmos ecosystem has been building lately. Do you have any takes here?
01:01:05.268 - 01:01:48.266, Speaker B: Yeah, we're recording with Sonny and Zachie from the Cosmos ecosystem. And I talked to Sonny at ECC and he gave me the line that the Ethereum and Cosmos visions converge upon the same endgame. And so where Ethereum has really prioritized security and in the community has emphasized ultrasound money. The cool thing about Ethereum, and one of the big reasons why I think Ethereum has done so much better as an ecosystem than Cosmos is because we had ether to focus on as like an intentional focal point. And Cosmos never really had that because they focused on app chains. And so we, as a L2 ecosystem on Ethereum, are now focusing on layer threes, which are the equivalent of app chains in Cosmos. But Cosmos has already figured out the app chain.
01:01:48.266 - 01:02:07.474, Speaker B: They figured that out forever ago. So Ethereum is playing catch up on the app chain world, where Cosmos is now playing catch up on the monetary properties of atom token shared security model. And so really going to be an interesting podcast. I'm really looking forward to that. I don't know much about the economics. I'm going to have to dive into this before we do the podcast of Adam. Stay tuned.
01:02:07.474 - 01:02:08.178, Speaker B: Of Adams.
01:02:08.194 - 01:02:22.860, Speaker A: Yeah, super inflationary. It's never meant to be money. It's very interesting. I was an old Cosmos staker from way back. Yeah, I want to talk to him a little bit about that. But a lot of building going on the space. And these new economics look interesting.
01:02:23.310 - 01:02:33.854, Speaker B: I will say that I judge a lot of protocols by their names. And Ethereum and Ether. Oh my God, it's such a good name. Cosmos and Atom can definitely give Ethereum a run for its money.
01:02:33.892 - 01:02:34.702, Speaker A: Do you like that? Great.
01:02:34.756 - 01:02:36.314, Speaker B: I love the names. I love the names.
01:02:36.362 - 01:02:40.222, Speaker A: It's Cosmos and the atoms are atomic units. Is this why?
01:02:40.276 - 01:02:42.720, Speaker B: Sure, yeah, it's kind of cool.
01:02:43.190 - 01:03:19.414, Speaker A: All right. Here was something that happened over the weekend, talk of reversible transactions. Imagine an ERC 20 transaction, David, that you could reverse after the fact. But I thought blockchains were for immutability, not the case. This is the case. By Kali eth billions in crypto stolen. If we can't stop the thefts, can we reduce the harmful effects? Over recent months, a couple of other Stanford researchers, as in the university Nigeria, and prototyped ERC 20 R 721 r to support reversible transactions on ethereum.
01:03:19.414 - 01:03:46.098, Speaker A: So an NFT standard and an ERC 20 token standard that supports reversibility of transactions. There was a lot of, I guess, back and forth about this because there's a camp that says immutability is part of crypto. What are you guys talking about? Bringing reversibility into our ecosystem. Like, immutability is the whole point. And there was another take that said, hey, this is just an option. Use it or don't use it. You can do either.
01:03:46.098 - 01:03:48.478, Speaker A: Where do you fall on this spectrum?
01:03:48.654 - 01:04:28.910, Speaker B: I initially was compelled by, like, this is open source software, turing complete. We can write whatever code that we want. This is just another tool and a massive tool belt of what we want to do with stuff. So I was initially in the option, like, sure, whatever, people might use this, they might really. I would never see a reversible transaction being token, being collateral inside of AAVE or compound or something, because you need settlement assurances. But then I've thought about it more and more and more, and Eric Connor helped convince me is that it's just like a trojan horse for so many bad things, and a reversible transaction belongs in the centralized layer of things. Put reversible transactions where there are central authorities to arbitrate.
01:04:28.910 - 01:04:48.726, Speaker B: Reversibility requires arbitration. Arbitration requires centralization. And so it doesn't make any sense in the middle. It requires humans. So reversibility should not be at the bare metal, right? And so, sure, anyone can build this. Anyone can use it. I don't support it, but you would.
01:04:48.748 - 01:04:52.698, Speaker A: Be upset if all the tokens from here on out adopted it, for example.
01:04:52.784 - 01:04:57.494, Speaker B: Oh my God, that would make it. Make. That would break the whole entire point of Ethereum.
01:04:57.542 - 01:04:57.754, Speaker A: Right?
01:04:57.792 - 01:04:58.662, Speaker B: That would be terrible.
01:04:58.726 - 01:04:59.322, Speaker A: Right? Yeah.
01:04:59.376 - 01:04:59.978, Speaker B: That's bad.
01:05:00.064 - 01:05:13.550, Speaker A: Yeah. So I get the duality of these. It's, to me, it's fine to have as an option, but I don't want it to be the de facto option on Ethereum. Certainly we'd have a problem if that was the case. Interesting standard, though. David, what's going on with Zach XBT?
01:05:14.210 - 01:05:20.606, Speaker B: Yeah, Zach XBT. He is this famous, what would you call him? Investigator, I guess. Private detective.
01:05:20.638 - 01:05:21.438, Speaker A: Almost like a private.
01:05:21.534 - 01:05:22.674, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:05:22.792 - 01:05:25.262, Speaker A: But vigilante, he works for himself, right? He's not hired.
01:05:25.326 - 01:05:39.400, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. I would put him shoulder to shoulder with Sam Z son. Sam Z's son is a white hacker. So when there is an exploit that needs to be patched, Samsy's son is first. Zach is not. He doesn't do that, but he discloses people that aren't disclosing their things.
01:05:39.400 - 01:05:42.666, Speaker B: He's the guy that he finds out.
01:05:42.688 - 01:05:46.042, Speaker A: All the dirty little secrets on chain that people don't want you to see.
01:05:46.176 - 01:06:05.786, Speaker B: He's the guy that revealed zero x sifu to be the quadringa CX, Gerald Patton or John Patton. That guy, Zack BXBT, is renowned for showing who is pumping and dumping what? And so Lark Davis, the crypto Lark is the next person to have been found out as a pumper and dumper.
01:06:05.818 - 01:06:08.546, Speaker A: And who is the crypto? Lark? Just kind of an influencer, right?
01:06:08.648 - 01:06:29.990, Speaker B: He's been around since 2017. I remember listening to his YouTube videos in 2017. He's kind of this just, like, unintimidating white crypto youtuber dude who has just a big following and turns out, friendly looking. Friendly looking face. Yeah. And turns out he has more or less explicitly been, like, pumping and dumping on his followers.
01:06:31.770 - 01:06:43.258, Speaker A: Another one by seduct, I think, 2019. Really? Or 2020. Yeah, he invited me on the show. I didn't know him very well, and he was just like, come on and talk about Ethereum. You seem to know a lot about it. So I went in and I talked about my bags. David.
01:06:43.258 - 01:06:43.802, Speaker A: Ether.
01:06:43.866 - 01:06:44.938, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, Ether.
01:06:45.034 - 01:06:47.070, Speaker A: And I dumped them on Lark's followers.
01:06:48.210 - 01:06:49.706, Speaker B: You sell ether?
01:06:49.898 - 01:06:55.806, Speaker A: I don't sell ether, actually. I mean, very infrequently. I'm a fine collector of Ether.
01:06:55.918 - 01:07:15.670, Speaker B: Fine collector of tough. And this is one of the. When I talk about the genesis story of bankless Ryan, I say, like, hey, the crypto media world was starved for a trustworthy media institution. That's business model. The bar was extremely low. Dude, this was our cop.
01:07:15.740 - 01:07:19.260, Speaker A: Over the bar. We don't dump on our followers. That's all.
01:07:20.430 - 01:07:30.010, Speaker B: Let's make a media institution that instead of dumping on followers, has ads. So for all the people that hate on the ads, like, pick your battles.
01:07:32.430 - 01:07:51.554, Speaker A: Yes. We don't. I do think so. I mean, you can go through all of the details of what Zach XBTC uncovered, but it's basically like low cap tokens. Pump them up, shown near followers, and then dump. Make millions of dollars. Right? This is a certain breed of crypto influencers, a business model.
01:07:51.554 - 01:08:50.978, Speaker A: It is not the bankless business model. We get paid through premium subscribers and also through advertisers, not by dumping on you. And we're also long term investors. And I also kind of suck at low cap coins and dumpage anyway. But one thing I will say is I think the entire crypto industry, particularly crypto media entities like us, have to do a lot better when it comes to disclosures. And so on the back of some of this stuff from Zach XBT, we've had internal meetings about, okay, how can we drastically increase the transparency of anyone who works on content within bankless and kind of what they're holding? So we're actually looking to roll out a new page with all of kind of the stats and all of our holdings, all of our angel investments, everything we have, starting the beginning of next month. So we'll be including that in a link in the YouTube show notes and the podcast show notes for all of our listeners.
01:08:50.978 - 01:09:00.310, Speaker A: And I think there are other organizations that do this well, but we also want to carry the flag because we recognize that it's a problem in the space.
01:09:00.460 - 01:09:23.406, Speaker B: And if you're asking why haven't we done this sooner, we do have a page that is like this, but we haven't had a website. So when Ryan says we're rolling out a site, we're actually rolling out an entire website as well, unrelated. And because of that website, we have like a landing page for disclosures. We've had our disclosures out for a while. It's just they're not easy to find and easy to get to.
01:09:23.588 - 01:09:26.418, Speaker A: Not as much detail as we now have. Look at this detail.
01:09:26.504 - 01:09:33.710, Speaker B: So it is all getting glowed up. We list our wallets, our public wallets, not our dumping wallets, particularly.
01:09:33.870 - 01:09:39.934, Speaker A: David, don't even joke. Hey, Zach, XBT, I mean, come up.
01:09:40.072 - 01:09:42.310, Speaker B: He would find me out in a heartbeat.
01:09:42.730 - 01:09:44.566, Speaker A: I'm too fearful of Zach now that.
01:09:44.588 - 01:09:45.960, Speaker B: Tornado cash is gone.
01:09:47.610 - 01:10:05.662, Speaker A: It's not gone. It's still there. You're not allowed to use it this is cool. In releases this week, Robinhood selects Polygon to launch its web3 wallet beta. Do you remember when Vlad, the CEO of Robinhood, we had that conversation with him at permissionless, I believe, and he told us this was coming. Here it is. Now it's based on polygon, which is pretty cool.
01:10:05.662 - 01:10:12.014, Speaker A: And, you know, Robinhood has great ux wallets, right? So, like, he was talking about the haptic response. Do you remember this?
01:10:12.052 - 01:10:13.360, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember that.
01:10:13.890 - 01:10:33.942, Speaker A: When you press a button, you just feel kind of a vibration. Yeah. Bounces on your phone, bounces back at you, gives you pleasure, sensations. I don't know what this is, but does something to the endorphins. Anyway, I'm looking for a really cool ux wallet. Dave and I are hoping to get on the beta program so we can test this out for you guys too, and tell you what we think.
01:10:34.076 - 01:10:44.550, Speaker B: Yeah, there was always a large number of questions as to how Robinhood plans on releasing some of their promises, like gas, free trading, et cetera. So they're starting to get some clarity on that.
01:10:44.620 - 01:10:46.022, Speaker A: Yeah, that's good. Cool.
01:10:46.156 - 01:10:49.394, Speaker B: Safe tokens and Safedow are here. This is safe from gnosis.
01:10:49.442 - 01:10:49.978, Speaker A: Safe.
01:10:50.114 - 01:10:59.322, Speaker B: If you have a multi sig or had a multi sig or operated a multi sig, you might have gotten an airdrop. There's a link in the show notes to go check that out to see if you got some tokens.
01:10:59.466 - 01:11:01.194, Speaker A: I think we got to claim some tokens, David.
01:11:01.242 - 01:11:02.634, Speaker B: At some point we do have to claim some tokens.
01:11:02.682 - 01:11:04.398, Speaker A: We have a gnosis safe, don't we?
01:11:04.484 - 01:11:20.342, Speaker B: Yeah. Also coming out of Opensea, excited to share that optimism is currently live on Opensea. Really? Actually, I think Opensea is live on optimism, since optimism is the actual platform, but semantics. So Opensea and optimism now working together. So that's pretty cool.
01:11:20.476 - 01:11:23.830, Speaker A: Tailwigging the dog there. Sound protocol. What is this?
01:11:23.980 - 01:11:45.662, Speaker B: Soundprote? Sound Xyz aka music Nfts. They are announcing the sound protocol. Permissionless bass layer. Artist owned and non upgradable song contracts, permanent and decentralized metadata, custom formats, and payments with end to end royalties. Cooper Turley's music nft thesis slowly but surely playing out.
01:11:45.796 - 01:11:49.166, Speaker A: Are you a sound nft pilled yet, David? A little bit.
01:11:49.268 - 01:11:50.762, Speaker B: I am music Nft pilled.
01:11:50.826 - 01:11:51.914, Speaker A: Music NFt pilled.
01:11:51.962 - 01:11:52.938, Speaker B: I am music NFt pilled.
01:11:52.954 - 01:12:09.830, Speaker A: It could be any sound though, when bankless intra music Nft we should do that sometime. This is cool. Circle expands USDC stablecoins to support five new blockchains. So circle getting USDC everywhere on Cosmos, near optimism and polka dot this time around.
01:12:09.900 - 01:12:10.658, Speaker B: And arbitram.
01:12:10.754 - 01:12:19.634, Speaker A: And arbitrum. Oh, cool. And they just announced that at their converge 22 conference, which, of course, we've been talking about for a while, that conference. David, let's get to raises.
01:12:19.682 - 01:12:20.990, Speaker B: USDC is not on arbitrum.
01:12:21.010 - 01:12:21.900, Speaker A: Yes, it is.
01:12:22.430 - 01:12:24.746, Speaker B: It definitely is. What does that mean?
01:12:24.928 - 01:12:28.278, Speaker A: I don't know what that is. I literally own USDC on arbitrator.
01:12:28.294 - 01:12:29.478, Speaker B: I own USDC on arbitrum.
01:12:29.494 - 01:12:31.478, Speaker A: I hope it's the right USDC, David.
01:12:31.574 - 01:12:32.860, Speaker B: Oh, go. No.
01:12:33.390 - 01:12:43.182, Speaker A: Well, maybe they're doubling down on their support. Maybe it's a different arbitram network. Right? Like one of the arbitrum nova. Yeah, not arbitram Nova or something like this. What's going on in the world of raises?
01:12:43.326 - 01:12:50.654, Speaker B: Raises. Coinbase Ventures backed crypto firewall provider Harpy Harpy. $4.5 million raise.
01:12:50.782 - 01:13:05.794, Speaker A: Cool. There we go. Pantera. Our friend Dan from Pantera is launching a new fund, potentially a $1.25 billion fund. Couldn't resist these bear market prices. You got to deploy some more capital.
01:13:05.794 - 01:13:15.942, Speaker A: So that's what Pantera looks to be about to do. David. FTX and CZ from finance, they're both bidding for Voyager. Guess who won.
01:13:16.076 - 01:13:24.382, Speaker B: Guess who won. And place your bets right now. If you are listening to the podcast, not viewing it, place your bets. Here he goes. Here he goes. Sam Bankman fried. $1.4
01:13:24.382 - 01:13:32.654, Speaker B: billion bid. SBF wins. Kind of makes that sense. I feel like that was the logical one. So sorry.
01:13:32.852 - 01:13:55.814, Speaker A: Do you know SBF is kind of like the Morgan. I was going to say Morgan Friedman. No, not the Morgan Freeman. The JPMorgan of the era. And buying up all of these kind of underwater banks and coming out stronger on the other side. I think both CZ and SBF are going to be an absolute force to be reckoned with on the other side of this bear market. By the way, the Celsius token just jumped as SBF said.
01:13:55.814 - 01:14:08.694, Speaker A: He is maybe eyeing buying Celsius next as part of his buying spree. So Celsius token owners excited about that? Not much to be excited about if you're Celsius token owner, but I guess that little whistle.
01:14:08.742 - 01:14:10.794, Speaker B: Don't know why that that's bullish to begin with.
01:14:10.912 - 01:14:15.678, Speaker A: I don't know that it is either. I guess some bailout was bullish. What else we got?
01:14:15.764 - 01:14:27.626, Speaker B: Because Celsius token holders, there are no rights. So Sam could be like, we're buying Celsius. I don't give a crap about the sell token holders because they have no investor rights. Ignore them, David.
01:14:27.658 - 01:14:33.230, Speaker A: Give them something be excited about. Okay. They've had a pretty hard year, I think, if you're a Celsius token owner.
01:14:33.310 - 01:14:35.010, Speaker B: Are you a Celsius token holder?
01:14:35.910 - 01:14:44.790, Speaker A: I still have funds in Celsius, and I think they were giving me Celsius tokens, too, but that's the least of my concerns right now. I want my ETH back. Alex. Do you know Alex?
01:14:45.130 - 01:14:47.670, Speaker B: Now you have to ask Sam. I have to ask Sam for your.
01:14:47.740 - 01:15:07.790, Speaker A: Well, we've had Sam on the podcast, so maybe I can. It's not his problem, though. He's going to buy the assets. He's going to discard all of the liabilities. It's going to be a bankruptcy court's problem, probably. Alex Machinsky resigned this week, by the way. I can't believe he was still in charge, but, yeah, he resigned from Celsius.
01:15:11.090 - 01:15:28.486, Speaker B: Remember? What am I bullish on last week, Ryan? It was the bankless, YouTube, like, short form, eight to 20 minutes long videos. I just finished my video on crypto grifters. Why is crypto full of scams? And I say the word, the name Alex Machinsky a few times.
01:15:28.588 - 01:15:32.130, Speaker A: Yeah. He got in your top. He got included.
01:15:32.210 - 01:15:34.226, Speaker B: Yeah. Top three grifters.
01:15:34.338 - 01:15:41.382, Speaker A: He'd definitely be in my. Well, I could guess the other ones do Kwan, the three R's, capitals, boys. Yep. Those top three.
01:15:41.436 - 01:15:48.490, Speaker B: Nope. They weren't just. Yeah, they're not grifters because they didn't take in users deposits.
01:15:48.990 - 01:15:52.522, Speaker A: I guess there are levels of grift. I mean, they were super irresponsible, right?
01:15:52.576 - 01:16:00.698, Speaker B: They're very irresponsible. But they were irresponsible with. I guess they were irresponsible with other people's money. But, like, what's a grifter?
01:16:00.874 - 01:16:02.670, Speaker A: What's a grifter among friends? Yeah.
01:16:02.740 - 01:16:05.150, Speaker B: Anyways, you got two out of the three, so we'll save the third for the video.
01:16:05.220 - 01:16:16.814, Speaker A: There we go. Jobs time. This is our reminder. Even though it's a bear market, there's tons of companies doing tons of hiring because they have a lot of money that they've raised during the bull market. David, should I read a few out? Are you going to dance?
01:16:16.862 - 01:16:17.874, Speaker B: Please do. I'm going to dance.
01:16:17.922 - 01:16:22.680, Speaker A: Uniswap Labs. Hey, they're on here. A developer relations lead. What is that?
01:16:23.450 - 01:16:24.774, Speaker B: Nontechnical, it seems.
01:16:24.812 - 01:16:58.498, Speaker A: Nontechnical. You're talking to technical people, but it's absolutely nontechnical. Senior front engineer at Uniswap Labs. Senior back end engineer for their trading platform. Uniswap Labs hiring a lot solid world Dow senior Web three developer Rubicon smart contract engineer bankless needs a social lord for social technical molecule needs ahead of engineering bankless also needs a growth marketer economia needs a lead designer. Silent protocol a full fact smart contract engineer get your job in crypto during the bear run. The way you do it is by logging on to bankless palette.com.
01:16:58.498 - 01:17:04.066, Speaker A: Put your email address in, you get these alerts via email. That is the way to do it. David, what do we got?
01:17:04.088 - 01:17:37.658, Speaker B: Coming up next, questions from the nation. Got a nice spread of questions and also the takes of the week. The five horsemen of Defi, Mr. Wonderful's investment strategy, aka Kevin O'Leary, which I thoroughly disagree with. So we'll talk about that and why you don't cut corners in crypto, as well as what Ryan and I are bullish on. So all of that and more, right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible and so we don't have to dump on you. The Brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 Internet with over 60 million monthly active users.
01:17:37.658 - 01:18:04.866, Speaker B: And inside the Brave browser, you'll find the brave wallet, the secure, multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser. Web three is freedom from big Tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy. But there's a weak point in web3. Your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions, which can easily be spoofed. But the brave wallet is different. No extensions are required, which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets. Brave Wallet is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains including Ethereum and Salana.
01:18:04.866 - 01:18:29.402, Speaker B: You can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp. And of course, you can store, send and swap your crypto assets, manage your nfts, and connect to other wallets and DFI apps. So whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro, it's time to ditch those risky extensions. And it's time to switch to the brave wallet. Download Brave@brave.com bankless and click the wallet icon to get started. Arbitrum is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs.
01:18:29.402 - 01:19:04.662, Speaker B: Some of the coolest new NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home, while DFI protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage. You can now bridge straight into arbitrum from more than ten different exchanges, including finance, FTX, Huobi, and Crypto.com. Once on Arbitrum, you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees, allowing you to explore new frontiers of the crypto universe. New to arbitrum. For a limited time, you can get arbitram nfTs, designed by the famous artists Ratwell and Sugoy, for joining the Arbitrum Odyssey. The Odyssey is an eight week long event where you complete on chain activities and receive a free NFT as a reward. Find out more by visiting the discord at Discord GG arbitram.
01:19:04.662 - 01:19:18.446, Speaker B: You can also bridge your assets to arbitram at Bridge Arbitrum IO and access all of Arbitrum's apps at portal Arbitrum one in order to experience defi and nfts the way it was always meant to be, fast, cheap, secure, and fiction free.
01:19:18.548 - 01:20:03.646, Speaker A: Got a question for the nation? Here's some questions we have coming up. As always, you can follow bankless hq on Twitter. Every Wednesday we tweet this out, a question from the nation. You can put your reply here and we may read it on the roll up. This is how we interact with the community. Here's the first one from Wesley Tate is asking this question. I'm going to tee you up for this, David, what are some examples of layer three apps that you guys can envision for the future of ZK sync or other ZK rollups? And do you have any thoughts on whether or not optimistic rollups will successfully reach layer three without sacrificing ease of use, cost, most importantly, security? I can hear in some people's reading of this question, like another question, which is layer three? You've just been talking about L2.
01:20:03.646 - 01:20:20.850, Speaker A: What is layer three? Is this some new marketing mumbo jumbo term? What is layer three? I could tell Wesley Tate listens to the bankless podcast because that came up in our earlier state of nation episode with Zksync. But tell us really quickly what layer three is, and then attempt to answer Wes's question here.
01:20:21.000 - 01:21:04.030, Speaker B: Yeah, so I mentioned earlier about the app chain model of Cosmos versus the layer threes on Ethereum. So we have L2s, we have generalized L2s, which kind of feel and act like Ethereum itself. It's a generalized platform. You can put any code on it, you can deploy anything. But even those things can actually approach some level of saturation or congestion. Now, the difference of Ethereum being congested is like the transaction fees go from L2 gets congested, and it goes from one penny to maybe a dollar, but even a dollar is too high of a transaction fee to pay for so many use cases. So many use cases require 0.1
01:21:04.030 - 01:21:50.250, Speaker B: cent transactions or less to really be unlocked. And that is where we go from a lot of scale to infinite scale. And layer threes is where we get that done. So not only are layer threes the ultra, super cheap, super fast layers, but they're also the more expressive and customizable and specific layers going back. So when DydX Ryan left Ethereum to go to the cosmos ecosystem and become an app specific chain, that was in contrast to what it could have done, which is become a layer three on Ethereum, either on top of like ZK sync or Starkware or something. But the layer three ecosystem just wasn't ready yet. But it's really starting to be, especially with Zksync mainet coming right around the corner.
01:21:50.250 - 01:22:34.090, Speaker B: And so what are some examples of layer three apps that we can envision for the future of ZK sync or other ZK roll ups? Let's think about things that are going to be crypto enabled, but also want to be domiciled of one specific use case. And I could see like if we have a big aa game, for example, World of Warcraft, where Ryan and I use this idea of just like we kill a boss and a sword falls on the ground, and that sword is an NFT. And if you pick it up, that NFT goes into your wallet first. That NFT needs to get minted when the boss gets killed. Then it needs to get transferred into your wallet when you pick it up, then you have a taxable event. But we need these cheap, free transactions to really make this possible. But also at the same time, say this is World of Warcraft or Blizzard.
01:22:34.090 - 01:23:17.754, Speaker B: Blizzard doesn't want to share a chain with a competitor or another games or anyone else. They want full control over what that chain looks like. And by the way, if they want irreversible transactions, that's the way they could put it in. And so layer threes are going to be like one chain for one thing at a time. Reddit is on top of arbitrum on using arbitrum's any trust model, which is actually a Layer two, an optimistic roll ups strategy of going over this upchain model. And I could actually even see a specific subreddit which somehow becomes really crypto enabled, shout out, re finance. This would probably be the first one where that activity, those rewards, upvotes, updutes like rewards, whatever.
01:23:17.754 - 01:23:41.966, Speaker B: All of those things become like economic assets on a chain. Maybe they're all worth pennies, but when the transaction fee is 0.1 pennies and your upvote is worth a penny. That's economic activity. And so those are the two ones that come to mind. But it's really like any sort of coordinated community on the Internet could find a layer three. And there's a lot of communities on the Internet.
01:23:41.998 - 01:24:15.790, Speaker A: I think one way to think about layer threes is chains on chains on chains. Right? So ethereum being the base chain, the layer one, and then Zke EVM, for example, being a L2, and then you can actually stack chains, sovereign chains, on top of the ZKe EVM, and that becomes layer three. And these, as you said, can be app specific, but they get to retain their full sovereignty. So DydX is a great example of this. I think there could be other Defi applications, maybe big defi applications that adopt this as a strategy. I don't know if you saw the article this week, David, from Dan Elitzer, but he talks about.
01:24:15.860 - 01:24:17.102, Speaker B: Oh, Dan Elitzer wrote something.
01:24:17.156 - 01:24:23.450, Speaker A: Yeah, basically the title of the article, I'm paraphrasing here is, but Uniswap will have a chain is the title.
01:24:23.530 - 01:24:34.500, Speaker B: Yeah, he gave out that tweet forever ago. We included it in the weekly roll up. And then I went over to Uniswap headquarters in Soho and I was like, yo, Hayden, what's going.
01:24:38.390 - 01:24:54.698, Speaker A: Mean? Dan Elitzer is making the case that Uniswap will need its own chain at one point in time. And you could imagine that being a sovereign chain of some sort, maybe a layer three of some sort. So these are the types of applications that we might see in the higher layers of the stack. Let's go to the next question.
01:24:54.784 - 01:24:55.370, Speaker B: Great question.
01:24:55.440 - 01:25:05.786, Speaker A: Yeah. When talking about Luna, this is from Discovercrypto eth. When talking about Luna, we often use phrases like 50 billion deleted. I think that's a verbatim David Hoffman quote.
01:25:05.818 - 01:25:07.118, Speaker B: Yeah, that's amazing.
01:25:07.204 - 01:25:23.458, Speaker A: What does this really mean? Was the money actually burned or is the money still existing just in the pockets of early Luna adopters and or shorters? What are we talking about there? I think there's like 50 billion deleted. What do we actually mean? Where does that come from?
01:25:23.624 - 01:26:18.098, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's a facetious, kind of sadly funny, sad way of saying capital destruction. There's capital creation and then there's capital destruction. So say somebody makes a company, 510 people all start working on this startup, and then they go public, and then all of a sudden, there's equity on the public market. And that company has a market cap valuation of $500 million, $500 million just got created out of thin air because the market values whatever startup they had at $500 million. So that was a capital creation event of $500 million. Now, when economies are good and they have stable foundations and people are innovating and exploring and building, capital is created. Yet when economies are bad, when we've invested, we've made bad investments, interest rates have to go up, capital gets destroyed.
01:26:18.098 - 01:27:00.590, Speaker B: And so capital is largely a story that humans tell each other. And this is why we emphasize, like, hard assets, sometimes the dollar, the gold base layer, assets that things collapse back down into when times are bad. And then there's risk on assets, which, where people buy when times are good. But capital is just a story that we tell each other as to what this thing is worth. So we can't sell the entire market cap of Apple and Amazon and Netflix. The Apple market cap is like $3 trillion. If everyone sold all of their Apple stock all at once, there would not be a transfer of $3 trillion from buyers to sellers.
01:27:00.590 - 01:27:42.878, Speaker B: Right. It would destroy a ton of capital because Apple stock would basically go to zero because there's not enough buying. Apple's super illiquid, but it's not $3 trillion worth of liquidity. And so when we talk about Luna and use a phrase, $50 billion deleted, it's because the bid for Luna evaporated. And so one day, Luna was worth $50 billion, and then the buying pressure for that Luna asset went to zero. Therefore, $50 billion of capital which existed because there was once enough buying, there was enough of a story to buy Luna. Once that story ran out, once the bid evaporated, all of a sudden the $50 billion that people had on their net worth balance sheet turned into zero.
01:27:42.878 - 01:27:45.654, Speaker B: And that is what I mean when I say $50 billion was deleted.
01:27:45.722 - 01:28:07.526, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a good way to think about it. It's like the story was deleted, essentially. Right. And it's important. I like that you brought liquidity into the picture there, because we have to remember, how is a market cap determined? Well, you just take the most recent price. Someone bought the thing and multiply that by the existing supply. Right.
01:28:07.526 - 01:28:36.462, Speaker A: That's it. That's all the market cap is. You have to look at kind of like liquidity, of how much is available in the market to actually sell or actually buy. And how resilient is that market cap to sell pressure? And Luna was not very resilient to sell pressure. Something like gold has really good liquidity. Something like the US dollar has a lot of liquidity. There's a lot of trading volume every single day on the dollar.
01:28:36.462 - 01:28:51.574, Speaker A: It's a much stronger asset. And I do think you remember we did that episode way at the beginning of bankless about liquidity and how liquidity is actually a pretty good definition of money because that's kind of the, I guess it shows the resilience of money.
01:28:51.612 - 01:28:53.794, Speaker B: Assurances that you actually have the asset.
01:28:53.842 - 01:29:08.170, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And that it's priced for what you think it will be priced. Let's go to this question from Sean Gill, 23. Will we ever see high APR liquidity pools like DFI summer 2021? Can we go back to the good old days, David?
01:29:09.970 - 01:29:33.934, Speaker B: Yes and no. Mostly no. I think the high liquidity pools of DFI summer were the phenomenon of the bull market in the same way, we don't really see icos anymore, but we do see token Creation events. I don't see. We're not going to see high liquidity pool twos of DFI summer. I think that was the high water mark. We will see high yields.
01:29:33.934 - 01:29:45.398, Speaker B: We will see yields return some way, somehow, it won't be as big or grandiose or risky as we saw in DFI summer. It will return. It won't be that crazy. It'll be much more sustainable and much.
01:29:45.404 - 01:30:02.986, Speaker A: More pragmatic, I think, particularly in the frontier. Right? That'll move to the frontier. It's a L2 is to new DeFi protocols, to riskier things. There is like a risk return trade off here where you see the higher apys, they're probably going to be more risky. And so keep that in mind as well. All right, David, let's get to some takes. Here's one for me.
01:30:02.986 - 01:30:04.286, Speaker A: Why don't you read it?
01:30:04.468 - 01:30:38.194, Speaker B: Ryan shot Adam says the US government literally sending our crypto developers into hiding right now. Imagine if we sent our Internet entrepreneurs into the hiding in the. Guess we're happy to let China fill the vacuum while we regulate the open Internet out of existence. And Ryan, you are retweeting an individual under the Twitter handle one way function who says, I've removed all of my crypto related code. I've written from GitHub about seven years worth of contributions to the space and will no longer be contributing code to the space under my real name. All future code contributions will happen via a pseudonym. Oof.
01:30:38.322 - 01:30:54.862, Speaker A: This. David, I just wrote this tweet out of pure frustration. We are literally. I'm angry at the US. I'm angry at our regulators. We are literally sending our crypto Internet entrepreneurs into hiding in America. It's what we're doing.
01:30:54.862 - 01:31:33.450, Speaker A: I can no longer imagine this. Imagine the early 1990s. We set Mark Andreessen into hiding because he was trying to hack on Netscape and he had a vision for this Netscape navigator browser, and there was some kind of regulation against, I don't know, encryption technology. And we said that was illegal in the US. Andreessena had to go into hiding, become an anonymous developer in order to do it, had to maybe move to a different country in order to deploy this stuff. That's what's at stake here. And I'm angry that it seems like inaction by legislators and reaction by regulators is making this happen in the US.
01:31:33.450 - 01:31:51.742, Speaker A: We are losing a generation of crypto entrepreneurs. It's maddening. It's frustrating. It's completely unnecessary. I go back to Commissioner Summer from the CFTC, her line, from her dissent. It didn't have to be like this. It doesn't have to be like this.
01:31:51.742 - 01:32:08.994, Speaker A: This is so stupid. We're shooting ourselves in the foot. Crypto is going to be fine. I don't know if America is. If it continues to persist in trying to regulate itself out of innovation and insist its population live in a financial prison. Done. Rant.
01:32:08.994 - 01:32:10.070, Speaker A: David, what's next?
01:32:10.140 - 01:32:26.518, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you. Zero X Tuba says. I would say that these are the five horsemen of Defi. I don't think any other protocol comes close. And it's a screenshot of Makerdao, Lido, curve Ave, Uniswap. Zero Xtuba is saying these are the five chads of Defi.
01:32:26.518 - 01:32:35.182, Speaker B: The five Defi apps that aren't going anywhere, that are probably relatively low risk bets, is what Zero Xtuba is saying. Would you agree with these five?
01:32:35.236 - 01:32:37.086, Speaker A: I like this list a lot, actually.
01:32:37.188 - 01:32:44.510, Speaker B: Yeah. I think people are going to take offense to Lido being in there, but it's hard to argue with. They have a lot of eth in there.
01:32:44.660 - 01:33:15.260, Speaker A: I certainly like maker, Curve Ave and uniswap. And what I'll note is this is all very, like, class of last bear market. This is very class of 2019 2020. Do you see Plenia had a take this week, which is like, hey, all of the innovation actually happened in 2018 and 2019, and not a lot has happened after that in terms of apps that we've built that are valuable and persistent. I mean, you could point to nfts, but beyond that, what else have we built, right?
01:33:16.190 - 01:33:33.962, Speaker B: I think that answer will come out as more and more D five 2.0 apps do make it through the bear market. Not all will, but I'm reminded of one of my favorite van Spencer tweets saying, stop asking for new narratives. We are 1% of the way through the current narrative.
01:33:34.026 - 01:33:37.060, Speaker A: Yes, this is uniswap is enough.
01:33:37.670 - 01:33:44.354, Speaker B: Being able to mint your own token and put it on uniswap instantaneously incredible is huge. Don't forget about how massive that is.
01:33:44.392 - 01:33:47.860, Speaker A: Yeah, don't fade the OG d five protocols, that's for sure.
01:33:48.330 - 01:34:01.862, Speaker B: Kevin O'Leary says, my investment strategy for crypto is the same. I've learned from stocks in all caps. Diversify. I own positions in 32 different coins and tokens. Ryan, what do you think about this tweet?
01:34:02.006 - 01:34:30.020, Speaker A: I think that's the opposite of what, personally, I think this is terrible advice. No disrespect to Mr. Wonderful advice. It seems like you're just random. Like you could find yourself randomly shotgunning into a bunch of different tokens that are actually highly correlated or basically the same thing, and calling that diversification. That's not really diversification in my mind. But what's your take on it?
01:34:30.550 - 01:34:31.922, Speaker B: My take on this is that.
01:34:31.976 - 01:34:33.458, Speaker A: Did you reply, by the way?
01:34:33.624 - 01:34:34.866, Speaker B: No, I quote tweeted him.
01:34:34.888 - 01:34:37.202, Speaker A: Oh, you quote tweeted. Okay, here it is. Can I read it?
01:34:37.336 - 01:34:37.682, Speaker B: Sure.
01:34:37.736 - 01:34:50.200, Speaker A: Guys, this is David's take. ETH is a diversified index. It's an index of the aggregate tokens and economic activity on top of Ethereum, where 90% of DFI is located. ETH is diversification. Few tell us what you mean.
01:34:52.990 - 01:35:25.614, Speaker B: Maybe there are 30 tokens out there that are quality enough. And maybe Kevin O'Leary has like a very beautifully diversified portfolio. He could, I think over two thirds of his tokens are going to go to zero over the long term just by the nature of tokens. And the cool thing is, with tokens on Ethereum and EIP 1559, ether gets the benefit of that. So every token that comes, attempts and then dies. That token went to zero, but it burnt some ether along the way. And so this is why ether is such a nice asset.
01:35:25.614 - 01:35:58.042, Speaker B: Even in bull markets, when there are all these ponzies and all these stupid tokens getting minted and all these tokens are going to zero, it's burning ether along the way. And then there's also the tokens that will work maker uni ave compound curve. Those tokens are good tokens to have. So maybe diversify amongst those. But even those tokens also add to the aggregate economic activity on Ethereum. And so ether the asset as the index of the aggregate Ethereum economy. Nothing better will do an awesome job of representing the Ethereum economy as a whole than ether, the asset.
01:35:58.042 - 01:36:31.062, Speaker B: And ethereum the economy is where like 95 plus percent of all NFT activity is 95% plus activity of where all DFI is. And so ether is a beautiful index of some of the most alive parts of the whole entire crypto world. And so the whole pulling in diversification, even the S and P, isn't actually a very good diversification tool. So you have to diversify amongst that. But this is something that older boomer investors don't understand about crypto. And that's why you can't just take stock strategies and apply them to crypto. It doesn't work.
01:36:31.196 - 01:36:34.780, Speaker A: I feel like you're about to dump on us, David. Are you about to dump all your eth on us?
01:36:35.950 - 01:36:39.814, Speaker B: Because I'm the person that can move markets of ether. Jesus.
01:36:39.942 - 01:36:51.754, Speaker A: Do you know what I don't hate, though? I actually don't hate, like, you know, the cryptex approach, which is just a straight index of the top 30 by or top x. I can't remember top x. Let's call it 30 by market cap. Crypto.
01:36:51.802 - 01:36:53.246, Speaker B: No, it's the whole market cap.
01:36:53.348 - 01:36:54.174, Speaker A: The whole market cap.
01:36:54.212 - 01:36:54.878, Speaker B: It's the whole market cap.
01:36:54.884 - 01:36:57.342, Speaker A: Okay. The whole market cap. I do not hate that at all.
01:36:57.476 - 01:36:59.762, Speaker B: I think similar. If you're talking about great, that's great.
01:36:59.816 - 01:37:25.830, Speaker A: If you're talking about diversification, because I agree with you about ETH. And of course, we're like, perma bullish eth. What that doesn't capture, though, is like growth of BNB, for example, outside growth of cosmos. Outside of it doesn't capture growth outside other ecosystems. You could buy the entire crypto market cap and you get all of that. That is definitionally perfect diversification. Rather than go like Rando, pick 30 coins you're bullish on and call that diversification.
01:37:25.830 - 01:37:28.234, Speaker A: I think people get into trouble that way, but maybe not Mr.
01:37:28.272 - 01:37:33.280, Speaker B: Wonderful. I'd love to see Kevin's 32 coins because I would probably make fun of them.
01:37:33.970 - 01:37:51.330, Speaker A: Well, let's. David's portfolio against Kevin's portfolio. Throw it down. You guys should make a Warren Buffett style bet. Let's go here. In almost all cases, it's a mistake to try and speed up adoption by compromising on cryptocentric product design. That is punk 4156 saying this.
01:37:51.330 - 01:37:52.514, Speaker A: What does he mean?
01:37:52.712 - 01:38:23.606, Speaker B: He's saying, don't cut corners. And so compromising on cryptocentric product design. I would call this what Luna did. I would call this what Wonderland did. There are certain properties or ethos of crypto that you can ignore if you build a DeFi project. And then as that DeFi project gets stress tested, it accidentally becomes a Ponzi scheme, whether you're intended it to be that or not. And so the call to action here is build something that doesn't cut corners and is cryptocentric.
01:38:23.606 - 01:38:27.200, Speaker B: And this is also a topic in my grifters video that'll come out next week.
01:38:27.730 - 01:38:33.966, Speaker A: You know what's an interesting rule of thumb? I wonder how well this applies is, like, don't buy anything that was built during the bull market.
01:38:34.148 - 01:38:34.880, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:38:36.310 - 01:38:38.706, Speaker A: Because you can't really trust it where.
01:38:38.728 - 01:38:42.850, Speaker B: You don't know, you don't have the signal it needs to weather the. Yeah, yeah.
01:38:43.000 - 01:38:50.760, Speaker A: Buy the thing that was built during the last bear market and survived anyway. All right, David, what are you bullish on this week, my friend?
01:38:51.450 - 01:39:16.862, Speaker B: I'm bullish on New York. I've been having a great time, man. Yeah. I don't really know much about New York, the state, but New York, the city has been amazing. It has fulfilled all of my hopes and dreams after moving here. So this is my call to action for people who are curious about going full time crypto society, not just crypto work. If you want to have the maximum exposure to the crypto industry, you gotta move to New York.
01:39:16.862 - 01:39:21.146, Speaker B: It is the best. I am having a fantastic time sponsored.
01:39:21.178 - 01:39:36.014, Speaker A: By the New York tourism hero. David doesn't have to dump his eth on you. That's awesome, man. You've lived in some great places, though. Like, you've lived, know, Seattle. That's a great place. You've also San Diego.
01:39:36.014 - 01:39:44.022, Speaker A: People move from all over the country to get to San Diego and, like, New York. And it's because of the people, because it ain't the weather, my friend.
01:39:44.156 - 01:40:12.974, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I know that so bad, but it's definitely the people. The people that are. Williamsburg, specifically, where all the crypto people are. It's so awesome just to have everyone around, and there's something just magical about the crypto people that want to be around other crypto people and talk crypto. The people here, New York specifically, attracts very interesting people. And then there's crypto side of that. You know, you add another layer of crypto interestingness on top of that, and it's just a fun time, man.
01:40:12.974 - 01:40:14.570, Speaker B: I've been having a great time here.
01:40:14.740 - 01:40:21.314, Speaker A: I'll take the northbound train, come up. See you one day. I'll track it up. Definitely.
01:40:21.432 - 01:40:22.850, Speaker B: All right, Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:40:22.920 - 01:40:52.166, Speaker A: Zk sync, my friend. The ZK EvM. It was a great episode that we did, but just in general, technology, it was really cool. I mean, coming off the podcast with Vitalik, where he said a few things, he said, zk is as fundamentally important as blockchains themselves. ZK technology, ZK cryptography, as fundamentally important as blockchains. He said, they plan to in the future. The Ethereum roadmap plans to ZK snarkify the EVM.
01:40:52.166 - 01:41:26.134, Speaker A: I don't fully even know what that means. Even after an episode with Vitalik, I feel like we need a deep dive like title of the episode if anyone downloads it. ZK snarkifying the EVM. Like, just that because I want to learn, so that's cool. But then also, he said, I'm surprised at the progress of the ZKe EVM. And now in less than 30 days, we're going to have the first Zke EVM on Mainet. Now, it won't be accessible to users, but I was mentally probably two years ago thinking that Zke evms were five years out, if they even happened.
01:41:26.252 - 01:41:27.270, Speaker B: The whole industry was.
01:41:27.340 - 01:41:49.454, Speaker A: I was kind of preparing myself to just say, oh, this is going to be like another plasma thing. Going to be like a state channel thing. They'll get far enough along the design, and just something won't work, and they'll have to pivot. And yet here we are. So that's what I'm really excited about. This has been called the Holy Grail. I mean, you have to launch the thing and kick the tires and actually test it before we know for sure.
01:41:49.454 - 01:41:57.810, Speaker A: But I think it's the most exciting thing happening in crypto right now, like in the post merge world. What's next? Zke evms are what's next.
01:41:57.960 - 01:42:13.158, Speaker B: Yeah. I can't emphasize how awesome that state of the nation was this week with Steve from ZK sync. It was definitely longer on the longer side for a state of the nation, but it was just so good. The YouTube comments loved it.
01:42:13.244 - 01:42:13.878, Speaker A: That's awesome.
01:42:13.964 - 01:42:17.350, Speaker B: This is Ryan and David dumping on you because we are advisors to ZK sync.
01:42:18.730 - 01:42:31.978, Speaker A: That's true. We are advisors to ZK sync, and you'll find that in the advisor page. But that's actually not why I'm excited about it. I don't know if anyone believes that. I'm here for the tech, bro. Okay, ZK evMs. All right, what's the meme of the week, David?
01:42:32.074 - 01:42:45.280, Speaker B: Meme of the week. Here we go. This is trustless state, and Ryan shot Adams on trustless state when the ether is getting burned more than it's issued. I actually don't know where this meme is, but I think this is two people.
01:42:47.970 - 01:42:50.286, Speaker A: These people play sports. I could tell that they play sports.
01:42:50.318 - 01:43:03.986, Speaker B: They definitely play sports. It looks like the Olympic team, but the Olympics are not going on. Yeah, maybe it's soccer, but the guy has a Europe shirt. Anyways, it's two dudes who are definitely playing sports, watching something happening. They are just holding hands, looking on the edge of tears.
01:43:04.098 - 01:43:11.830, Speaker A: They're just broken at just the feeling of euphoria. That was my exact face. That guy on the right. My exact face when.
01:43:11.900 - 01:43:13.930, Speaker B: Wait, so are you the guy on the right?
01:43:14.080 - 01:43:14.682, Speaker A: I don't know.
01:43:14.736 - 01:43:18.138, Speaker B: Is that how you identify? Because I did identify myself as the guy on the left.
01:43:18.224 - 01:43:29.502, Speaker A: Oh, wow. There you go. Yeah, I'm the guy on the right. My face contorts in that way when I'm very emotional. That's definitely me. You see the hair? It's a little patchy. That's me.
01:43:29.502 - 01:43:30.814, Speaker A: I'm the guy in the right for sure.
01:43:30.852 - 01:43:34.974, Speaker B: Oh, maybe it's the hair. Yeah, I have the hair on the guy on the left. Yeah, that's right. The hair that did it.
01:43:35.012 - 01:43:43.410, Speaker A: It's accurate, right? People would have said it. I may as well claimed it. All right, guys, wrists and disclaimers, of course. Got to tell you once again, first.
01:43:43.480 - 01:44:04.294, Speaker B: No, we have a fantastic moment of Zen coming up after Ryan gives. It's one of my favorite moment of Zen's. It's an interview on Capitol Hill of bankers and Congress. And then it also cuts to, where is that movie, the big short as well. So you know it's good. So pay attention to that cut, otherwise you'll get confused. But first, Ryan's going to read you some disclaimers.
01:44:04.342 - 01:44:13.146, Speaker A: None of this has been financial advice. EtH is risky. So is bitcoin, so is Defi. It always is. You definitely lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier.
01:44:13.146 - 01:44:23.598, Speaker A: It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot. The gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Hollingsworth, is now recognized for five minutes.

There must be some kind of law against working for a financial institution right after you've been working in financial. No. No. Hey doggy.
