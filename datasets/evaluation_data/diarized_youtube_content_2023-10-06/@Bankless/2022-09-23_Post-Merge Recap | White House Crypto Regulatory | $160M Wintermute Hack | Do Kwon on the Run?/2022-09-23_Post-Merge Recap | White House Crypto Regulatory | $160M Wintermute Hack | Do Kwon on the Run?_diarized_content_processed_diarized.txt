00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.650, Speaker A: Is this cope, Ryan? Are we coping right now? You might be coping. Do you feel like we're coping?
00:00:04.730 - 00:00:19.102, Speaker B: I think when people are coping, they don't know they're coping. And I was about to say, no, I'm not. This is not cope, David. But maybe that's what people who are coping say. Hey, bankless nation. Happy fourth Friday of September, David. What time is it?
00:00:19.156 - 00:00:30.310, Speaker A: Ryan? The bankless Friday weekly roll up where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere into the frontier nonetheless. Every Friday with our morning coffee, of course.
00:00:30.460 - 00:00:45.210, Speaker B: Yeah, grab a cup of coffee. As you hear how David and I struggle through a roll up post merge. Post merge, David, what is there to talk about now that the merge is done? Content. Any content bear market. Is this going to be a 20 minutes episode here?
00:00:45.280 - 00:00:51.194, Speaker A: Yeah, the roll ups are just getting actually, even though there is nothing happening. I bet you we could find a way to make a 90 minutes roll up.
00:00:51.232 - 00:01:11.042, Speaker B: Yeah, but you know what? There actually is a lot happening because there's always a lot happening in crypto, even though we're in a post merge world. Number one, we're going to talk about the White House. They have some words to say to the crypto industry. This Biden report just came out, and I think people need to know. Is it alarm time? Should we be freaking out right now? What else we got?
00:01:11.096 - 00:01:31.334, Speaker A: And we have to reset the hack counter. There's a $160,000,000 hack in this never before seen way of getting hacked. Are you at risk? No, you're not. But it's an interesting story nonetheless. So we'll get into that. And of course, we covered it last week. Doe Kwan, is he on the run? Where is he, Ryan, do you know where Doe Kwan is? Because people are looking for him.
00:01:31.452 - 00:01:36.682, Speaker B: I don't know. He says he's not on the run, but I think Interpol has a different take on that.
00:01:36.736 - 00:01:40.860, Speaker A: It sounds like somebody who's on the run, what they would say. Yeah, it does.
00:01:41.230 - 00:02:12.502, Speaker B: Before we get in, though, David, got to talk about our friends and sponsors at swell who want you to know that there is going to be a new eth staking opportunity in town. It's called swell, Dave and I like these guys so much. We're also angel investors, and they are now in a guarded launch territory. So they've started the launch process. It's in a guarded launch while they take care of a few more things. But what is swell, David? Why is this a new entrant onto the liquid staking scene. And what are these guys specializing in?
00:02:12.556 - 00:02:54.706, Speaker A: Yeah, swell is really going after the best of both worlds between Lido and rocket pool. Rocket pool, of course, the only decentralized permissionless of validating staking as a service pool on ethereum, lido, a permission validator set. And swell is doing a little of both. So you can stake your ether with swell permissionlessly if you put up a 16 eth bond, or you can also be in the dow and get voted in as a trusted staking provider. And so you get a little bit of lido, a little bit of rocket pool, and Lido came around in 2020. And so if you were too late for both of those things, you could still get in at the ground floor of swell. So there is a link in the show notes to go and join the discord and join that community.
00:02:54.888 - 00:03:15.050, Speaker B: This is promising to be a community owned protocol, so go check out the discord and help them build this thing out. David, let's get to markets. All right, bitcoin. What are we looking at on the bitcoin price this week? Can we just skip playing the sad news week? No, tell us. Give us the hard truth. Okay, we can hear it. We're ready for this.
00:03:15.120 - 00:03:32.400, Speaker A: Bitcoin not down so bad. Started the week at $19,800. So start of the week below 20,000, ending the week at $19,000, a few dollars below $19,000. So we are in the 18,000 range, down 4% on the week. Not looking so great. Not looking so great.
00:03:33.010 - 00:03:36.074, Speaker B: Not so great, but not so bad. Typical bear market week.
00:03:36.132 - 00:03:48.242, Speaker A: Well, we're at the lows. The bitcoin, like, flashed down to 17 and a half during the liquidation, and then it popped right back up to 18,000 something. We're at the market lows. We're not that far off the bottom.
00:03:48.376 - 00:04:01.260, Speaker B: There was a liquidation event this week. Maybe some are saying this is maybe fed caused, fed induced. We'll talk about that, but how about Ether? We are in a post merge ETH world. Was Hal press right? David? Was the merge priced in?
00:04:02.510 - 00:04:14.478, Speaker A: So ether down 14% on the week, started the week at $1,500, ending the week just below $1,300. I guess the merge was priced in.
00:04:14.644 - 00:04:17.742, Speaker B: I guess it was fully priced. The merge execution was priced in.
00:04:17.796 - 00:04:25.298, Speaker A: Yeah. You ready to say that? I guess so, yeah. There's no way for me to twist this. I got nothing here.
00:04:25.384 - 00:04:44.790, Speaker B: Do you know your debate with Jordy Alexander on whether the merch is price center or. You know, I've taken the role of the unbiased moderator, David. So I can't be in your corner. I can't be in Jordy's corner. I have to be unbiased. I will say as an unbiased moderator, you're not wrong yet. Maybe Hal press was wrong.
00:04:44.790 - 00:05:19.586, Speaker B: Some of the traders were wrong. You're not wrong yet. Because what I heard you say in that conversation with Jordy was it may not price itself in, in the short term. You were talking about like post merge could take a few weeks, a few months. But your main argument was in the mid to long run, the merge isn't priced in because we have a massively decreasing issuance rate, less supply on the market. All we have to do is refill that demand bucket and then prices shoot back up. All we got to do, maybe some solace there.
00:05:19.586 - 00:05:22.740, Speaker B: I don't think you're wrong yet. I don't think anyone can say that.
00:05:23.270 - 00:05:40.086, Speaker A: It is pretty much a pretty big bummer to see Ether go down 14% immediately post merge. I mean, definitely one part macro which we're about to talk about. Also the other thing that the new meta is like, all right, post merge, what the hell is next? When you look over the horizon, what.
00:05:40.108 - 00:05:41.142, Speaker B: Do you see about that?
00:05:41.196 - 00:05:43.642, Speaker A: There's not much there. So we're going to talk about that too. Yeah.
00:05:43.696 - 00:05:47.674, Speaker B: Do you know what this has cemented for me though, David? That we are in a bear market.
00:05:47.792 - 00:05:48.410, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:48.560 - 00:06:13.678, Speaker B: All right. We are in a bear market. It's going to be a sustained bear market. Right. So I think there was some hope that this catalyzing event of the ETH merge might change things, spark something, wasn't enough. And this confirms when good news happens during a market cycle and the price goes down, it's generally, you know, you're in a bear. So bear market confirmed.
00:06:13.678 - 00:06:28.210, Speaker B: I think we could be here for months. I think we'll have to wait until Macro takes over and we'll get into some of that story. But also there are no big crypto catalysts ahead. This is nothing I can really think of beyond the merge.
00:06:28.290 - 00:06:30.378, Speaker A: Yeah, so we got that.
00:06:30.464 - 00:06:32.342, Speaker B: It's going to be fun times on bankless.
00:06:32.406 - 00:06:36.060, Speaker A: Is this a bearish weekly roll up? Wow. Only like three of those.
00:06:36.510 - 00:06:48.000, Speaker B: I'm not really bearish, honestly. I just think this is the sustaining the bear market. But I'll tell you what, did not drop Eth price. And that was Gensler comments this week. I saw this headline, had to bring it up.
00:06:48.450 - 00:06:50.490, Speaker A: Headline? I thought that was the onion article.
00:06:50.650 - 00:07:00.990, Speaker B: No, this is Yahoo Finance. This is mainstream finance reporting. And with the headline Ethereum price drops 20% as SEC declares control over the network.
00:07:01.070 - 00:07:01.266, Speaker A: Wow.
00:07:01.288 - 00:07:30.282, Speaker B: And we've got a picture of Gary Gensler with his fist in the air, dictator, king style, controlling the network, I guess, as depicted, controlling the network. So if your friends ask you if Gensler is controlling the network right now, and if that's the reason price dropped, bankless is here to say, no, that's not the reason price dropped. And no, the SEC didn't declare control over the network. Gensler was just saying things that Gensler says often, and we'll cover that later.
00:07:30.336 - 00:07:30.940, Speaker A: But.
00:07:33.390 - 00:07:52.974, Speaker B: Mainstream reporting of this you can't associate know correlation is not causation. So anyway, moving on, let's take a look at what actually happened with ETH supply, because that is a pretty cool story. We're actually not in the ultrasound territory, though, so maybe that's a bummer. But tell us what we're looking at here, David.
00:07:53.022 - 00:08:17.500, Speaker A: Yeah, so we're going to just do a review of the ether supply dynamics post merge. And you can see that little chart in the center of your screen. It is going up and to the right. So ether is inflating. It's inflating at zero point 19% a year, which is pretty damn low. And I see some bitcoiners and some Ethereum bears looking at this chart and be like, oh, look, ether is not ultrasound, it's not deflationary. All the EtH people were wrong.
00:08:17.500 - 00:08:46.038, Speaker A: But when you see this chart and you go up into the right, Ryan, could you go ahead and hit that simulate pow button on the right side so we can see what it otherwise would have? Now look at that. So that white dashed line is what Ethereum was previously pre merge. And then the blue line at the very bottom is what it currently is. And those are very distinct, very different slopes. And then bitcoin is about splitting the difference right in the middle there. Also. The other important thing is that since the merge, there has been 4.7
00:08:46.038 - 00:09:19.518, Speaker A: thousand ether issued where there was previously once 13,000 ether issued a day. Since merge, there has been a net total issuance of 4.7 thousand ether issued. If we were still in proof of work, we would have otherwise issued about 93 and a half thousand ether. So that is a net issuance reduction of 88,000 ether that has not been issued since the merge has gone in total sum about $14 million. $14 million, not insignificant. And how long has it been since the merge? About seven days, right?
00:09:19.604 - 00:10:10.462, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been seven days. And this is the thing, David, just one week into this, and ether is not ultrasound post merge on a one week basis. But of course, it can always catch up, right? Two weeks from now, three weeks from now, maybe months later, and the next bull run, for example, takes issuance down deep into the negative territory and makes up for this. But for people who couldn't see the lines that you were pointing to, ETH was issuing, or would have been issuing over the past seven days, 3.78%. And to your point, it was actually only zero point, 19%, and that was as a result of the merge. So the difference being we issued 4700 eth with proof of work, we would have been issuing 93.5. Big difference there, big delta there.
00:10:10.462 - 00:10:12.206, Speaker B: It's also worth showing in the numbers.
00:10:12.308 - 00:10:47.190, Speaker A: It's also worth noting that when gas is like, basically on its floor right now, right, at seven gwe, if we had a 50 gwe, 24 hours period, that makes up for like, three days of net inflation, right? And so the amount of burn is uncapped, and so you can burn, like, seven days worth of inflation inside of a very small amount of time. And so as soon as you get out of the depressed bear market era of gas fees, you can make up a lot of lost ground in a very short amount of time. Is this cope, Ryan? Are we coping right now? You might be coping. Do you feel like we're coping?
00:10:47.270 - 00:11:04.398, Speaker B: I think when people are coping, they don't know they're coping. And I was about to say, no, this is not cope, David. Maybe that's what people who are coping say. Honestly, I'm not that worried about this. You should only be worried about this, in my opinion. If you think block space demand will never recover on ethereum, well, if you.
00:11:04.404 - 00:11:11.954, Speaker A: Think block space demand will never recover, you are also thinking crypto is not a thing. Those are synonymous statements, right?
00:11:12.152 - 00:11:49.806, Speaker B: So to me, it does not compute, is not compatible. That doesn't work. Because if bankless has a fault, maybe we have more than one fault, David, but our fault is that we are permables on this industry and on crypto, not over short term, one week time periods, okay? Over year long decade long time periods. And yeah, it's incompatible to me to be short block space demand in that environment. But how does ETH stack up? Ethereum, that is, stack up in issuance versus other networks right now, that'd be a cool thing to see. Yeah.
00:11:49.828 - 00:12:14.134, Speaker A: This is where the ultrasound meme really takes hold. So bitcoin, currently issuing at 1.75%, which is issuing $17 million a day dogecoin coming in. And this is in terms of dollars. So the more dollars you're issuing that you come first. Dogecoin is the new number two daily issuer in us dollar terms, inflating at 3.6%, almost $0.8
00:12:14.134 - 00:12:44.798, Speaker A: million a day. Coming in third is Ethereum at 00:15 percent, issuing $700,000 a day of currency. And so the zero point 15% issuance rate is such a clear juxtaposition on every other highly issuing money currency in the space. Like Cardano, 1.3% litecoin, one point three point seven percent. I don't know where avalanche or Salana is on this. Sometimes David Mihau gets a bug and he stops displaying them.
00:12:44.798 - 00:12:52.980, Speaker A: But Salana is at 7%. Like avalanche is like 8%. These are big differences. These are huge numbers.
00:12:53.430 - 00:13:23.038, Speaker B: Yeah, I do think all of this will catch up to the price of ETH, but certainly not overnight. Eventually a few things with respect to staking rewards. I saw this from our network newsletter. This was very interesting. Look at this portion of consensus rewards, which are basically block rewards versus execution rewards. So post merge, the rewards to validators saw an increase of 172%. So definitely went up.
00:13:23.038 - 00:13:47.942, Speaker B: Not as high as some people were saying. I saw numbers around the high 5.9% to 6% APY something like that. I mean, there was the hope during the bull run. If you use the bull run block space demand, then you get like double digits staking yield. We haven't seen that. We're not likely to see that anytime soon.
00:13:47.942 - 00:13:57.042, Speaker B: But 6%, not too bad. And more than half of that is coming from MeV and transaction fees rather than pure block space reward.
00:13:57.186 - 00:14:06.378, Speaker A: One of my favorite things about just the post merge world is how many more metrics there are to look at. There's just so many numbers to talk about. As a content producer, I enjoy it.
00:14:06.544 - 00:14:09.500, Speaker B: Yes, we will not run out of content, that's for sure.
00:14:10.190 - 00:14:29.406, Speaker A: Knock on wood. Okay, so this is mevboost.org, which is a new website that's very, very useful. This is all about the block building side of the equation. So just a quick recap. There's block proposers, aka eth stakers. People are staking their ETH, and sometimes they want to outsource the role of building a block.
00:14:29.406 - 00:15:01.994, Speaker A: They are, for whatever reasons, usually monetary, they will say, hey, someone serve me a block. And I will propose that block rather than building that block myself. Because if you block building is a skill, it's a competition vector for people to compete on and there are new block builders on the scenes. These are new entities in the supply chain of building an Ethereum block. So there's flashbots, of course, there's a blocks route. There's block native manifold and Eden. These are all block builders, and they are specializing in how to extract as much mev out of a block as possible.
00:15:01.994 - 00:15:35.586, Speaker A: But then there's also things like block route ethical, which is only extracting ethical mev. So no sandwich attacks and no other malicious stuff. There's also blocks routes regulated. If you choose to be OFAC compliant, you can have the regulated block served to you. And these entities are all competing as to how profitable they can build you a block. So flashbots is by far the most used block builder. It's built almost 10,000 blocks so far, producing almost 2000 ether in rewards for people that have used flashbots.
00:15:35.586 - 00:16:19.782, Speaker A: At the block builder coming in at an average block value of zero, three ether per block. And then all of these people are competing on the various vectors as to how to make the average block the most profitable. Coming in first. Block native at 00:23 ether per block, is the best block builder so far in the game, but is so, so early in this brand new world of block building that we will see manifold, the one that Ryan is highlighting, is a special case. They are integrating with certain DFI apps like sushi swap, which is why they have only proposed a very low number of blocks, 63, but their average block value is 0.6. Right. That's their deal.
00:16:19.782 - 00:16:23.942, Speaker A: They are low numbers of block proposers, but high value per block. Yeah.
00:16:23.996 - 00:16:46.894, Speaker B: What's interesting to me is like, okay, so relayers and block builders, they just got jobs on the network. They're newly employed. And this is the same time we said to all of the miners on the Ethereum network, thank you for your service. Your services are no longer needed. We will escort you to your vehicle. Right. And like, miners ended, and now we have new.
00:16:46.932 - 00:16:48.894, Speaker A: But thank you. Thank you, though, for your service.
00:16:49.012 - 00:17:21.850, Speaker B: We have relayers and we have builders as well. And the builder market is actually like. It's actually fairly diverse. There are a number of different block builders that are gaining some market share on the relayer side of things. That's been interesting, because if you run an actual validating node like David and myself, so you set up your validating node, and then you get to pick which block builder, which block relayer you actually want. And you can pick based on your values. So I want maybe an ethical blocks builder and relayer.
00:17:21.850 - 00:17:56.482, Speaker B: Yeah. Grass fed, organic. Or you can pick maybe something that is super compliant, maybe the overcomplier, block builder like blocks are out regulated. You actually get to choose these things. Now, David and I had a conversation with Vitalik earlier this week, and he made the point that there are protocol upgrades coming down the pipeline that will actually nullify the need for relayers. And so we'll always have block builders, but not relayers, which is good, because relayers can represent a censorship vector anyway. More on that centralization vector, too.
00:17:56.482 - 00:18:22.798, Speaker B: Yeah, centralization, censorship vector. More on that episode, if you listen to it. That's coming out on Monday. But to your point, David, there are so many more numbers to look at, and the ecosystem has just gotten that much more interesting with these new relayers and builders entering the network. All right, well, Ethereum is building blocks. The Fed is raising interest rates. Maybe Jerome Powell is the guy we have to thank for the lower crypto prices this week.
00:18:22.798 - 00:19:00.300, Speaker B: The Fed just went big again. This is their third straight three quarter point rate hike. So zero point 75, 750 basis points up. This was anticipated, I think, by the market. Of course, Powell has been signaling this for a while, and in his comments, he actually signaled more to come. So the comments, I think, were a bit more hawkish than analysts thought. Quotes like this, the chances of a soft landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy needs to be more restrictive or restrictive for longer.
00:19:00.300 - 00:19:34.974, Speaker B: That's what he said. He also said no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so, how significant that recession would be. Not as much talk of soft landing in this discussion. Talk of maybe estimations of maybe a zero point 75 rate hike again in November, followed by another half a percent in December. All right, so we are going up, my friend. Interest rates are rising. The Fed is really serious about breaking the back of inflation.
00:19:34.974 - 00:19:49.798, Speaker B: So we are now between the new target range of three to 3.25% from an interest rate perspective. So that happened this week. And of course, markets risk on assets tumbled as a result.
00:19:49.964 - 00:20:04.890, Speaker A: Yeah. Sick. Okay, so we merge. We look beyond the merge and we see nothing. And then the Fed says, oh, you want something to look forward to, rate hikes? And that. Actually, I feel like it does a pretty good job explaining the price action over the last seven days.
00:20:04.960 - 00:20:11.566, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, you think? Powell was like, he saw the merge and he was like, you guys are too happy. Take this. You think that's what happened?
00:20:11.668 - 00:20:12.958, Speaker A: Yeah, he's got it out for us.
00:20:13.044 - 00:20:14.686, Speaker B: Yeah, probably what happened.
00:20:14.788 - 00:20:18.370, Speaker A: All right, so, like, when the hell is the pivot? I was promised a pivot.
00:20:21.430 - 00:20:25.038, Speaker B: Maybe post November pivot.
00:20:25.134 - 00:20:27.400, Speaker A: Isn't that November of 2023?
00:20:28.330 - 00:20:31.154, Speaker B: No, there's, the midterms are coming up this midterms.
00:20:31.202 - 00:20:32.194, Speaker A: Oh, midterm election.
00:20:32.242 - 00:20:33.830, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, we got midterms.
00:20:34.570 - 00:20:47.290, Speaker A: Okay, well, whatever. I don't know anything, but I was always under the impression that the Fed can't raise the interest rates all that much without bankrupting the United States. So when's the bankruptcy happening? I was promised the bankruptcy.
00:20:48.430 - 00:21:06.740, Speaker B: Not at these rates. I mean, there have been lots of people, like Dan Morehead from Pantera Capital, who's like, hey, the Fed has to raise at least 5% to 6%. They should be doing it now. And this is more on kind of the aggressive side, and they have to do it in order to be sustainable. So different macro people have different perspectives on this.
00:21:07.590 - 00:21:27.170, Speaker A: No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or not or how significant that recession would be. Kind of freaks me out because their policy on the other side of things, like I said last week, their policy on the other side of things were like, oh, we'll just issue money. Inflation is transitory. We don't know. It's like, okay, sick. Now we're going in the other direction.
00:21:27.250 - 00:21:58.194, Speaker B: But here's the thing. Of course, we know that high inflation is not politically tenable. Neither are recessions for those in power. Right? So you kind of want to thread the needle and get the balance right. And right now, Powell is in the mood to take a hawkish stance on things. But I'll tell you, the prices of something is going up, and that is the price of a 30 year mortgage rate in the US. Now, this has raised to more than 6% for the first time since November 2008.
00:21:58.194 - 00:22:22.982, Speaker B: So I have never seen rates in my kind of looking at homes lifetime. I've never seen interest rates this high, not even close. And they're still increasing, which is crazy. And if you want to look at how this looks to an average home buyer, here's a tweet. The average 30 year mortgage is up from 2.7% to 6.3%. We got a doubling.
00:22:22.982 - 00:22:57.250, Speaker B: And that means monthly payments on a $500,000 loan last year, that's a home payment, was $2,030. Monthly payments, now $3,100. Housing prices are down 6% in one month. And that is the biggest drop since 2011. This tweet ends. Recession is an understatement. So how much can you keep cranking the vice grip here, David, before other things break? And that's know macro analysts like Jim Bianca have been telling us all along they will continue to hike until something breaks.
00:22:57.250 - 00:23:10.626, Speaker B: Is the housing market the next thing to break? I'm not sure. We're looking at bonds in Japan. These are other things. Not sure when the next thing to break is. But Powell and the Fed seem determined to continue this strategy of tightening.
00:23:10.818 - 00:23:28.206, Speaker A: I can't tell if people that bought a house at the peak of the bull market, like in 2021, where did they buy the top of the housing market yet also the bottom of the interest rates, of the mortgage rates, because at the same time prices are down from all time highs, but also interest rates are up.
00:23:28.228 - 00:23:37.314, Speaker B: So was it a good deal or was it not nice to be locked in right now to like a 2.7% fixed loan, 30 year fixed loan. What a gift that is in these.
00:23:37.352 - 00:23:42.718, Speaker A: Yeah, but your house is down 6% in a month. Pick your poison.
00:23:42.814 - 00:23:59.202, Speaker B: Yeah. You can't get everything. But if you want some comforting words, Powell has some words on shelter. He said this, I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time. We're looking for it to come down, but it's not exactly clear when that will happen. It may take some time. Here's, this one's for you, David.
00:23:59.202 - 00:24:01.682, Speaker B: Hope for the best, plan for the worst.
00:24:01.826 - 00:24:04.954, Speaker A: Powell said, I don't feel comforted by that at all.
00:24:04.992 - 00:24:34.082, Speaker B: Hope for the best, plan for the worst. This is Stanley Druckenmiller. Not much more good news than what he's saying. This is a video quote from an interview series he did. He said, there is a high probability in my mind that the market at best is going to be kind of flat for ten years, sort of like 1966 to the 1982 time period. That's not a favorable time in american history with respect to the price market of stocks and equities markets and that sort of thing.
00:24:34.216 - 00:24:37.670, Speaker A: That is a huge take. Ten years of flat.
00:24:38.010 - 00:25:23.726, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know what this all means. Right. But I think one thing that we're seeing, of course, is when prices go down, when it seems like there's bad news on the week or on the month, then things like this. Druckenmiller quotes surface, right? Who knows how long he's been saying this? Who knows how long other investors have been kind of saying this? So there is kind of an information bias when it comes to bad news always gets magnified during bad weeks in the market. I think that's at play. But the question remains, I think what would crypto do in a flat ten year period? Is that going to happen? And if it does happen, for equities.
00:25:23.726 - 00:25:34.294, Speaker B: What does that mean for crypto as an asset class? I'm not really sure how to weight these, how to understand them, but I think it's more content we should do on bankless to figure that out.
00:25:34.412 - 00:26:03.840, Speaker A: The answer, what I want crypto to do during that time, I mean, of course I want the answer to go up, but you can't ask for that, obviously. What I want it to do is decouple, do something else, do something different. And maybe that's how this bear market slowly plays out, is like this SP market, which moves slower than crypto markets. Crabs for ten years, but then four to five years into it, we have another classic growing season in the crypto world.
00:26:05.970 - 00:26:07.530, Speaker B: That's what you want to happen? David?
00:26:07.610 - 00:26:10.350, Speaker A: Yeah, I want it to decouple sometime.
00:26:10.510 - 00:26:33.718, Speaker B: Later in the conversation. Drucken Miller did say during the 1970s was a good time for many companies. I mean, that was the time when Apple was founded, for example, Home Depot was founded. And of course, we do know that crypto markets tend to move much faster than traditional markets. So the pain is more severe. The dips are shorter in general, but yeah, we'll have to see. This could be uncharted territory.
00:26:33.718 - 00:26:35.706, Speaker B: David, what do we have coming up next?
00:26:35.888 - 00:27:08.862, Speaker A: Coming up next, the White House has some words for us in the crypto industry. Is it time to time the alarm? We'll figure that out. $160,000,000 hack. Got to reset the counter on that one. And what's next? Now that the merge is behind us, what are we going to talk about? What's the new meta? What's the new narrative? Can we create one? Because there's definitely a content bear market going on. So all of that and more, right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Arbitrum is an ethereum layer two scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use DFI and nfTs.
00:27:08.862 - 00:28:03.026, Speaker A: Some of the coolest new NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home, while DFI protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage, you can now bridge straight into arbitrum from more than ten different exchanges, including finance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com.

Web three is freedom from big tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy. But there's a weak point in web3. Your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed. But the brave wallet is different. No extensions are required, which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets. Brave Wallet is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains including Ethereum and Salana.
00:28:30.266 - 00:28:49.330, Speaker A: You can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp. And of course you can store, send and swap your crypto assets, manage your nfts, and connect to other wallets and DFI apps. So whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro, it's time to ditch those risky extensions and it's time to switch to the brave wallet.

00:28:49.400 - 00:29:15.120, Speaker B: Alright guys, we are back. The Biden administration. The White House just released their first ever comprehensive framework for responsible development of digital assets. By that they mean crypto. And the Biden administration charged a whole bunch of branches in the White House to go and investigate crypto. And this is the report, this is what they came back with. David, what's some of the summary from this report?
00:29:15.650 - 00:29:48.310, Speaker A: There's just different headlines, different goals that this report wants to see out of the crypto industry coming in at, number one, protecting consumers, investors and businesses, which, yeah, I mean, I guess that makes sense to lead with, especially coming from the White House who are trying to protect their citizens. It's no secret that crypto is full of scams and exploits and hacks. How the White House and how the government plans to solve that problem. Curious to see. Anyways, that's number one. Number two, promoting access to financial services. Number three, fostering financial stability.
00:29:48.310 - 00:30:20.610, Speaker A: Four, advancing responsible innovation. Five, reinforcing the country's global financial leadership and competitiveness. Six, fighting illicit finance, anti money laundering, counterfeit financing of terrorism, et cetera. And seven, exploring a us central bank digital currency. I don't know how much I should read into the ordering of these things, but it would make sense that the White House would put protecting consumers first. So that's like, let's not do things like algorithmic stablecoins. Let's not promote scams.
00:30:20.610 - 00:30:38.822, Speaker A: Interesting. That number seven last is the CBDC, which definitely tracks with all the other government institutions out there that are like, oh, we'll research and talk about it. Let's think about, talk about it. Yeah. What are your takes on this?
00:30:38.876 - 00:31:26.386, Speaker B: Yeah, so when I read this, David, I guess a few things stood out for me. Like just some keywords. Like if you did a keyword search, there were a lot of words that connote danger or risk or illicit finance. There was also some CDBC, even though there was a section about competitiveness in America and protecting, like, there wasn't a lot of meat on the bone in those sections. And so for me, this report was pretty bearish. Now, I didn't go into all of the detail because there are many branching reports and it's very long, but there wasn't a lot of talk about the potential of crypto, wasn't a lot of talk about the value of Defi in our economy. There wasn't a lot of talk about how America would lead the way from an innovation perspective.
00:31:26.386 - 00:32:15.650, Speaker B: And I was left as kind of like a fellow builder and investor in the space in crypto, being like, what's there for me in, like, why should I build here? It was pretty uninspiring, I think, for us entrepreneurs and builders. Hopefully it's just a lot of talk similar to the CDBC type talk, and maybe there won't be negative action kind of taken. But one thing that became clear, and this was a take from Jake Chervinsky. Of course, you'd expect them to come down pretty hard on illicit finance and money laundering, that sort of thing, because this is the government, after all. But also algorithmic stablecoins kind of took center stage in the report. This is Jake Trevinsky tweeting this. It's hard to overstate the damage that Terra has done to the perception of crypto in DC.
00:32:15.650 - 00:32:43.086, Speaker B: Many policymakers already disliked the notion of a permissionless digital marketplace and wanted to put all of crypto into a well sealed box. Terra gave them unjust cause to push forward, or maybe just cause. And I think that's what lawmakers and those in DC are actually thinking, so Terra, Luna Doquan, the ecosystem, the community, that entire thing that just happened six months ago.
00:32:43.188 - 00:32:45.806, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. That $50 billion that we deleted.
00:32:45.838 - 00:33:05.000, Speaker B: Oops, I put a damper on this entire report. I mean, a lot of people think it could have come out a lot different if Luna hadn't just happened six months ago. Now, how can you be optimistic on, quote, unquote, defi when that sort of thing is going on?
00:33:06.250 - 00:33:21.610, Speaker A: Can you help me understand, what is this thing? White House releases comprehensive framework for responsible development of digital assets what does this really mean? Are they just issuing a report and. We issued a report.
00:33:21.680 - 00:33:33.866, Speaker B: I think they're issuing a report. They're issuing some guidance. They're starting to develop a posture, a policy on kind of what Biden might support. What might he not support? The things that people should explore.
00:33:33.978 - 00:33:39.710, Speaker A: This is for themselves, though, right? Here's our report for our own stance towards crypto.
00:33:39.790 - 00:33:45.380, Speaker B: It's influential, I think, across all branches of government. Right? So everyone's reading this.
00:33:46.710 - 00:33:50.166, Speaker A: A lot of branches of government are reading this and be like, okay, this is how we should act.
00:33:50.348 - 00:34:14.382, Speaker B: I think this is how Biden wants us to act, or this is kind of the White House's posture. I think it's influential in that way. And we're starting to see some legislation, particularly on the stablecoin front. So this week learned a draft stablecoin bill in Congress. This is all about stablecoins. We don't yet have the details of what this bill actually is. It's in the House right now.
00:34:14.382 - 00:35:02.318, Speaker B: But there's talk of bans on different types of payment coins that are not backed by outside assets, so similar to Terra and UST, the algo stablecoin that, of course, collapsed. And so bans on maybe algorithmic stablecoins. Now, I have to say, we haven't seen the details yet. This is all kind of closed doors. So we don't actually know what might be inside of these bills. But it's kind of alarming that we wouldn't pick on the centralized aspects of atera and would maybe extend the blame to a class called algorithmic stablecoins, and who knows how far, like, would rye be included in that, for example, which is collateralized, backed by eth, and not really pegged to the dollar as kind.
00:35:02.324 - 00:35:04.190, Speaker A: Of a troll mechanism.
00:35:05.010 - 00:35:31.320, Speaker B: Well, is maker an algo stablecoin? I mean, it's enforced by code, right? Maybe this definition is broad enough to include maker, for example. Or how about Frax, which uses a combination? And so if these experiments fall under the purview of such a bill. I don't think that's a good thing for crypto. Like, that's a very bad thing. That puts us farther away from non state money, at least the legality of non state money in the US.
00:35:32.010 - 00:35:56.410, Speaker A: Brian Armstrong made a comment about this. He said, one of the strongest policy arguments for cryptocurrency is that it's a national security issue. The US missed out on semiconductors in 5G, which is now largely manufactured offshore. It can't afford to have cryptocurrency go offshore as well. Same for every country, by the way. And then he continues, regulation by enforcement has a terrible chilling effect. And rhetoric matters.
00:35:56.410 - 00:36:40.698, Speaker A: We've already seen a huge amount of crypto talent, asset issuers and startups go offshore. And he finishes. Coinbase is a global company, but we're based right here in the USA, and we'll fight to make sure crypto succeeds here for everyone. It's too important for America and the free world. And this is why, Ryan, I was asking you, what is this report really doing? How is it moving the needle? Because every time I see a report like this and we always joke about like, oh, the United States decided to have a meeting to talk about and research cbdcs without actually implementing anything. And yes, it takes time to do regulation, but the crypto industry builds so fast that we're going to build faster than they're going to be able to comprehend this industry. And that is always going to create a source of friction because of what you just said.
00:36:40.698 - 00:37:07.326, Speaker A: Maker, dow, is that algorithmic? Because that's fully collateralized, up to like 300% fracs? Is that algorithmic? Because there's only 10% of that supply that's algorithmic. And then there's terra that's algorithmic. Algorithmic is a bad word. We don't even know the words that we need to describe our own industry. And so there's so much just chaos and confusion in this space that whatever regulation or report that they produce, I feel like it's always just going to lag behind what's actually needed.
00:37:07.448 - 00:37:46.306, Speaker B: I think what's most alarming, though, is if the first principles in the report are kind of wrong, right, where we do need regulation. And I think we've always said this is where things are centralized, they should be regulated where they are more decentralized, they don't require as much regulation. The regulation is the code. It's fully transparent. It's all unchained. There aren't humans in the middle. And so if they make that categorical error of taking, not mixing up the difference between centralized and decentralized and taking an entire use case like algo stablecoin, pointing at that and saying, that's the bad thing.
00:37:46.306 - 00:38:17.338, Speaker B: No more algo stablecoins. I just think the implications of sloppy regulation, sloppy legislation could impact our industry in a big way. And particularly when I say our industry, I mean those in the US, because outside of the US, these experiments may continue to run. And as Brian Armstrong said, what's going to happen us will be leapfrogged. Right? Just like they missed out on the 5g opportunity, they missed out on the semiconductor opportunity. That's what's at stake here. And so that was the White House report.
00:38:17.338 - 00:38:37.038, Speaker B: There's a House bill on stablecoins that's happening. There's actually been an earlier proposition of a stablecoin bill in the Senate as well. But apparently on the Senate banking committee, we don't have many fans of crypto. This was an article that was released just yesterday.
00:38:37.214 - 00:38:41.406, Speaker A: The Senate Banking committee is not fans of crypto. I am just shocked.
00:38:41.598 - 00:39:23.006, Speaker B: Right. So they asked Senator Brown, who's the chair of the committee, about crypto, and this was his direct quote. Let's just say there's a healthier skepticism about crypto and banking, Housing and urban affairs committee than there is in the AG committee. That's the agricultural committee he's talking about. Every single member of the banking committee, with the exception of one, has serious, serious skepticism of and concerns about crypto. Well, do you know who the one is, David? One who doesn't have concerns? This is Senator Toomey, who's actually coming on the bankless podcast next week. And I don't know if you saw this, David, but he had kind of a sparring match.
00:39:23.006 - 00:39:25.274, Speaker B: Did you watch this video, Gary Gensler?
00:39:25.322 - 00:39:26.286, Speaker A: It was so good.
00:39:26.388 - 00:39:27.162, Speaker B: All right.
00:39:27.316 - 00:39:33.490, Speaker A: When politicians make sense, it's just like, it feels like a weight is off your chest. Like, thank you, Toomey. Thank you.
00:39:33.560 - 00:39:56.746, Speaker B: Yeah. So there was some back and forth between Toomey and Gensler in a Senate committee meeting. And Gensler is basically saying, hey, all tokens are securities, or almost all of them that I've seen, because most of them depend on the profits of others. I'm not saying this. The Supreme Court is saying this. There's something called the Howey test. And Toomey was coming back and saying, yeah, but not if they're sufficiently decentralized, though.
00:39:56.746 - 00:40:15.070, Speaker B: And Gensler was kind of like dancing around that term, sufficiently decentralized. And Toomey said, well, profits of others, that's just one prong of the Howey test. And there are like four. He didn't say this, but the question imposed is like, are Pokemon cards securities? How about if the number goes up?
00:40:15.140 - 00:40:18.306, Speaker A: Is that security? No, is the answer to that question.
00:40:18.408 - 00:40:34.182, Speaker B: And he was pleading. He was just saying, please give us clarity. There's a lack of clarity for the industry. Please, Gary Gensler and Sec, give us clarity. And Gensler repeated, but there's already clarity. The Supreme Court said so in the Howey test, and on and on and went for like four minutes.
00:40:34.316 - 00:40:43.798, Speaker A: He's just passing the buck off to the Supreme Court, right? He's like, everything's a security. Go ask the Supreme Court. But he's just putting words in the Supreme Court.
00:40:43.974 - 00:40:52.438, Speaker B: That's what he's doing. Which is interesting, because maybe these sorts of cases end up at the Supreme Court level. Maybe that's how they ultimately get results.
00:40:52.534 - 00:40:54.142, Speaker A: It's where he's funneling them. That's for sure.
00:40:54.196 - 00:41:04.874, Speaker B: It seems to be. And yeah, that's the White House report. That's what's going on in DC, in crypto during the bear market. David, we also got a hack this week. What happened?
00:41:05.012 - 00:41:35.770, Speaker A: $160,000,000 winter mute hack. This was an interesting one. And so there's these things called vanity addresses. They're not like ens addresses where you buy a name. They're something where you basically mine for an address, you use a cpu or a gpu, and you produce a bunch of hashes, and you try and check for something that you're looking for. And so say you want an address that starts with zero x. You can't actually intentfully make that address.
00:41:35.770 - 00:42:05.154, Speaker A: You have to just discover a private key that corresponds to that address. And so that's what wintermute did. They mined for an address with this application called profanity that helps them do this. And they got an address that started with a large number of zeros. It was like six or seven zeros. People just do these things because it's cool. I remember there was a big excitement when somebody in bitcoin land in 2017 found an address that started with flame, and that was, like, super cool.
00:42:05.154 - 00:42:32.910, Speaker A: Obviously, you can't share the private keys because there's the only one set of private keys, but people like to do these things anyways. Winter Mute used this app called profanity to make a profanity address, which started with, like, eight zeros. Turns out the code that profanity used was faulty, and so it was very exploitable and that's what happened here. And so are you at risk of this same exploit? If you've used the app profanity, you might want to double check, but for like, 99.99% of people, you're fine. You're fine.
00:42:33.060 - 00:42:36.286, Speaker B: Definitely not worth it to get that vanity address, right.
00:42:36.468 - 00:42:44.402, Speaker A: Well, it's possible to do it in safe ways if you double check everything, like all smart contract addresses. You just got to make sure you know what you're doing.
00:42:44.456 - 00:43:01.906, Speaker B: I'm just kind of. Why take the risk? Clicking buttons on your ledger in metamask? Yeah, it's risky business sometimes. And winter? Mute. Of course, they were a crypto market making firm. That's why they had so much money in a hot wallet, because this was a hot wallet as well. Wasn't cool storage.
00:43:02.018 - 00:43:03.490, Speaker A: That's a lot of money in a hot wallet.
00:43:03.570 - 00:43:35.426, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a lot of money. I do think the lesson here is, and this was a good summary from a website I found called Halborne, the profanity vulnerability address generator was abandoned by its creator. So this project was actually abandoned by its creator, which is not a good sign multiple years ago. So when performing high risk cryptographic operations such as private key generation, it is best to use a tool that is reputable, audited, and still actively supported. That is the key takeaway for bankless listeners, I think.
00:43:35.528 - 00:44:17.146, Speaker A: I mean, this feels like common sense. Anyways, moving on into our big news item of the week, which is an absence of news, actually. And so the big meta question is, now that we're post merge, what's the next catalyst? What's the next thing that we're going to focus on? What next? And I think this has been the meta conversation in crypto Twitter lately, is what's on the horizon. What do we have to look forward to? And I feel like that lost feeling of where are we and where are we going when people don't have an answer to what is next in the crypto world is like showing up in the price action. Prices are down because people feel like they are confused as to where is the next catalyst?
00:44:17.178 - 00:44:19.950, Speaker B: Why is it a supply problem? It's a demand problem.
00:44:20.020 - 00:44:46.258, Speaker A: It's a demand problem. And so it turns out, post merge, that there's not that much juice to squeeze out of crypto. The merge was kind of it. And straight up retail just needs a rest. And this is just how crypto works. Like, retail comes in, they pump up the markets and they make institutions follow them, and then they get exhausted, right? Like the NFT gas markets are hard Defi is complicated. Bridges get hacked.
00:44:46.258 - 00:45:17.858, Speaker A: So retail needs a rest, but they always come back. Retail always comes back. You just got to let them sit for a little bit, and then we'll poke that door later. There's also macro fears on the rise. We talked about macro for the first 30 minutes of this podcast, but then there's also the pivot on the horizon. And so we have this period of time where things just got really calm really quickly and really depressed. And now we're having to contend with what's next.
00:45:17.858 - 00:45:19.794, Speaker A: Ryan, what's your attitude with this?
00:45:19.912 - 00:45:46.566, Speaker B: My attitude is this is normal. This should be expected. We've seen this before in crypto. We're going to see it again. This is a take from DC investor, and he says, if you were here from the crypto class of 2021 and are still here in 14 months, then I might from that point onward, consider you legit. This is the great filter, he calls it. So that's where we are in the market, the great filter.
00:45:46.566 - 00:46:20.470, Speaker B: Whole bunch of people who just came in recently, class of 2020, 2021, are about to get filtered out. They're about to leave. And so this is an analogy we often use of the difference between settlers and tourists. The tourists leave, the settlers stay, and we build, we rebuild for the next cycle. And I got to say, david, this goes back to kind of probably my main take of the week that we'll get to is why I'm bullish. I'm bullish because the builders are continuing to build, my friend. I have never seen more building activity go on.
00:46:20.470 - 00:46:58.100, Speaker B: On the Ethereum protocol layer, for example, even just shipping the merge and everything that's next that we just talked to Vitalik with. But then on the application layer, I mean, bridges being built, layer two is being built out and hardened. DFI apps, a whole new generation of these DFI apps, Gamefi is still happening in the background. Nfts we are building more than ever before. I think this market cycle to me proved that crypto has product market fit. All right, 2018 before, DFI wasn't sure, didn't know for sure. It was kind of a guess.
00:46:58.100 - 00:47:35.034, Speaker B: And that's why, by the way, prices of ETH are like ten x higher. It's because we have product market fit. But what's going to happen over the months to come is the tourists are going to leave, the settlers are going to stay, we're going to build, and we're going to be ready for the next cycle because I do believe the next cycle will come independent of macro. This is not even a bet based on macro. Maybe macro will help things happen faster. But I don't think crypto can be stopped due to macro. I mean, this is an exponential, revolutionary technology, and it can grow past macro in the stock market quite easily.
00:47:35.034 - 00:47:41.450, Speaker B: It doesn't actually take that much. It just takes some real world use cases to completely expand.
00:47:41.530 - 00:48:11.926, Speaker A: And there are things that are literally, next, we're going to have the withdrawals unlocked. Not that that's fundamentally bullish. But then there's EIP 4844, the ZK EVM, the gold standard of scalability. The ZK syncs launching in 36 days. So there are things, Ryan, technical protocol developments that are literally next. However, it's not the protocol that triggers bull markets. These protocols are the platforms for applications that then trigger bull markets.
00:48:11.926 - 00:48:54.386, Speaker A: And this is the thing that people that stick around during the bear markets are able to observe firsthand, that newcomers that come because of a bull market are always catching up on, is that the 2021 bull market was the DFI summer of 2020. And NFTs exploded on Ethereum, and that was the Ethereum app layer bull market. This is where an Ethereum gas fees hit like 600 and stayed there for weeks. What that triggered was another bull market in protocols that wanted to also share in this avalanche Salana Phantom. But it always starts with the protocol. And so we are having protocols now, like the ZKE EVM out of ZK sync Polygon, like so many of all these teams. Starkware.
00:48:54.386 - 00:49:24.586, Speaker A: Oh, starware is not doing one, actually. And then also 4844, where the brakes get unleashed out of layer twos. So these are the things. These are the things that are next. They're not, like, fundamentally bullish, but they produce the platforms for bull markets to exist on. And you're only going to watch that if you were here. I remember Ryan going through 2018 18 to 2020, having this gut instinct that I have no idea when the bear market is going to end, but when it does end, it's going to end quickly and it's going to rocket.
00:49:24.586 - 00:49:33.394, Speaker A: The prices are going to rocket. And when ether broke $400, it broke $1,000, like two or three months later. So you have to stick around to observe this.
00:49:33.512 - 00:49:54.294, Speaker B: Can you share that story? Because bankless tweeted something out. It said, for real, how did you actually become a millionaire in crypto? For those of you who did it, how did you do? It was the tweet. And I actually didn't expect you to respond, David, but you responded with your story. What is your story? How did you do? Well in crypto during the last bear.
00:49:54.342 - 00:50:47.674, Speaker A: Market, I got a job in crypto that made it easy to pay attention to crypto. So it was my job to stay up to date with the meta. And so I was consuming information all the time, like learning, learning about how this thing works. And then with whatever money I had after rent and rent and food, I bought ETH, like 100% of it. And I remember when ether broke down to $80 in Covid, again, I literally thought, I'm not saying that this is healthy, but my friend was like, hey, let's go on a trip. And I'm like, dude, the cost of this trip in ETH terms is astronomical. And so I definitely did cut off general life activities, but it was just because I saw these prices in ETH terms, I'm like, I can't justify this in opportunity.
00:50:47.674 - 00:51:22.738, Speaker A: Yeah. And then eventually, after a very subdued two years of activity where I was just like, working at my companies, eventually starting bankless and consuming and learning and producing content, that all came to, I was able to cash in on that rapidly in 2021 when ether goes from four hundred dollars to four thousand dollars inside of twelve months. Right. And so you can't afford to not pay attention because the alpha you get from being ahead of the bull market is insane. It's the difference between buying the top and selling the top. The ability to, not that I sold.
00:51:22.754 - 00:51:27.286, Speaker B: The top, the ability to see DFI. Like DFI summer before it happened. I mean, we saw that.
00:51:27.308 - 00:51:33.558, Speaker A: It was obvious all people that participated in DFI summer saw the 2021 bull market a year in advance.
00:51:33.734 - 00:52:21.034, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree. This is a post that caught my attention from Maddie earlier this week, and he talked about some possibilities, some things, if you were a settler to look out for an actual DFI 20, he mentions web3, commerce, web3 social, decentralized science, DSi, the world of atoms, where kind of like physical meets crypto. There's all sorts of different areas you can take a look at. And I love how he concludes his post, which is just like, I don't really know what the next big use cases are going to be, but I'm here and I'm going to watch them and observe them and find out. So that's what you have to do if you want to do well in cryptos, you can't be the tourist who just comes in during the tops of the cycle. You have to stay for the long run. So I think that's what's next for us.
00:52:21.034 - 00:52:25.974, Speaker B: David, we're going to keep staying. We're going to keep doing what we're doing with bankless and what is literally.
00:52:26.022 - 00:53:02.502, Speaker A: Next in the show. Universal Studios doing an NFT scavenger hunt. So this is kind of that story, the adoption of NFTs in creative in different ways. Universal Studios getting into it tether once again under the microscope seems to this happens every twelve months or so. And Doequan an Interpol notice, but we don't know where he is, so we're going to find out all this stuff and more right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Juno is bringing crypto friendly banking straight into your checking account. With Juno, you can send money from your Juno checking account straight onto a layer two like polygon optimism, arbitrum, and they have Zksync and Starknet support on their way.
00:53:02.502 - 00:53:34.542, Speaker A: You can skip the Ach wait times, you can skip all the gas fees and go straight from your checking account to an ethereum layer two in seconds. Inside Juno, you can buy and sell crypto with zero dollar fees, and your Juno checking account comes with a metal Mastercard that gives you up to 5% cash back on your spending. Juno is also giving you $10 cash back on your first crypto deposit and $100 when you set up a direct deposit. This ad just writes itself. So go sign up at Juno Finance. Bankless Lens Protocol is an open source tech stack for building decentralized social media applications. It is the new era for social media.
00:53:34.542 - 00:53:56.642, Speaker A: We all have toxic relationships with our web two apps. We want to break up with them, but we can't. These applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made. We need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control, rather than them controlling us. Lens isn't a social media app. It's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps bloom. Lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user.
00:53:56.642 - 00:54:23.406, Speaker A: In crypto, we say, not your keys, not your crypto. And on Lens, we say, not your keys, not your profile. With lens, your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use. And instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app, lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media. Lens is the last social media handle that you'll ever need to create. So in order to get started, there is a secret code word in the show notes. Enter that code word in the Google form link and you'll be well on your way to entering the world of web3 social.
00:54:23.588 - 00:54:31.842, Speaker B: The new proof of work. Ethereum fork, David, it's down 75% already. It seems like it's kind of dead. Is that a shocker to you?
00:54:31.976 - 00:54:44.402, Speaker A: Not at all. While I was sad that the merge was definitely priced in, at least I got this one right. The east POW chain was a nothing burger. I'm not surprised in the slightest.
00:54:44.466 - 00:55:12.794, Speaker B: That is some solace infura as well. They are a network that provides a lot of the data to different wallets that you use, a lot of the infrastructure node infrastructure that powers Ethereum, and they are announcing that they are planning to decentralize their infrastructure. I think this is a long time coming and very hoped for for many in the Ethereum community that we would have more decentralized options rather than just the infuras and the alchemies of the world. Do you have anything to add to that? David?
00:55:12.922 - 00:55:50.540, Speaker A: I think when somebody a big protocol like Infuria says we plan to decentralize, it's fair to say token. Because if you want to continue development, how do you incentivize that development while also being decentralized? It means a token. This is a very key piece of Ethereum infrastructure. It's a source of critique from external Ethereum people, because your metamask hooks into inferior to relay transactions, and if inferior wanted to censor you, you probably could. So decentralizing inferior is a very big deal. So this is a very big step out of infira. Also fitting with Consensus's new meta of wanting to tokenize and decentralize as many of its products as possible.
00:55:50.540 - 00:55:55.498, Speaker A: So best of luck on the journey into the decentralized frontier, infira.
00:55:55.594 - 00:55:57.754, Speaker B: I'm still waiting on that metamask token though, David.
00:55:57.802 - 00:56:25.410, Speaker A: Someday, yeah, keep on, don't hold your breath on that one. Something new out of the Starkx ecosystem. They tweeted out bug found and fixed shortly after launch. But how it was found and fixed is pretty cool. The bug was found by blad Bachok, out of matter labs and Ehor Baronblatt. These are russian names that I'm terrible at pronouncing and they say, and Starquare says we share our deep appreciation and thank them for alerting us. This is an excellent example of good community spirit.
00:56:25.410 - 00:56:50.862, Speaker A: Then DC investor who retweeted this saying a ZK sync devs found a bug in the starkware ecosystem and communicated it to them to make sure that it could be fixed before anyone found could be harmed by it. Respect to the right kind of ethos to move us forward. And then ZK sync says being mission driven means helping everyone in the ethereum ecosystem. Glad we could help starkware stay secure. Nice job. Nice job. This is good.
00:56:50.862 - 00:56:51.582, Speaker A: Good move.
00:56:51.716 - 00:56:53.354, Speaker B: Harvest goodwill clout.
00:56:53.482 - 00:56:54.974, Speaker A: Yeah, that's exactly right.
00:56:55.092 - 00:57:07.922, Speaker B: This is Opensea. Excited to share that they just released opensea on arbitrum, or at least that's going to be happening soon. So adding other networks to the fray, I think they've added polygon, maybe salana, if I'm not mistaken.
00:57:07.986 - 00:57:08.310, Speaker A: Yes.
00:57:08.380 - 00:57:22.474, Speaker B: And now arbitrum. So excited to see all of the layer twos join the ranks of an Opensea supported network. David, this is some cool NFT news. Universal plus nfts and a scavenger hunt. What is all this?
00:57:22.592 - 00:57:55.890, Speaker A: Yeah, I thought this was pretty cool. It's a pretty clever use of nfts. So basically what they're doing is they are just issuing, they're putting seven different QR codes around their Halloween era. Like themed parks. Like every Halloween they theme their park Halloween themed, and it's a scavenger hunt. And so people run around the park and they scan seven QR codes and then you get an NFT when that's scanned. And visitors who scan all seven of them receive a special NFT, which, according to Moonpay, the crypto payment service that's partnering with Universal on this, said can unlock additional perks.
00:57:55.890 - 00:58:17.430, Speaker A: If you don't know what to do with your nfts, this is what you do. You make them hard to get, and then you make them unlock certain things and access to more things. It's the most basic roadmap for all nfts. Universal doing a good job with this and making it fun. And I guess congrats to Moonpay for partnering with them on that is a huge partnership.
00:58:17.590 - 00:58:55.890, Speaker B: Tether under the microscope again, stablecoin issuer Tether ordered to produce documents showing what USDT is actually backed by. This is, I think, a us judge in New York requiring that tether do this. That's all good. This is back to what we were saying is if you're centralized, you should be under the scrutiny of regulators. Like, we should know what USDT is backed by, shouldn't be able to ban it completely, but we should have full transparency and visibility here. So I don't hate this. I'm excited to get the definitive view on what tether is actually backed by, because that's always somewhat been kind of a mystery in crypto.
00:58:56.050 - 00:59:16.094, Speaker A: I will say this does happen every now and then. I think the last time this happened was in 2019, where tethered was forced to disclose its holdings and it was like, okay, it's all there, moving on. But like you said, that was a one snapshot in time that's now like three years stale. So I guess we'll just do this all over again. I'm expecting tether to come back with.
00:59:16.132 - 00:59:21.760, Speaker B: Plenty of reserves, like USDC does it every month. Right?
00:59:22.930 - 00:59:25.198, Speaker A: Or it's like, that's the way it.
00:59:25.204 - 00:59:51.922, Speaker B: Should be if you're a centralized. So you should have audited financial reports for what actually backs the dollar here. David, there seems to be some back and forth between FTX, SBF, that is sandbank been freed, and CZ. They are buying all sorts of things. These are the two crypto banks that have money in this bear market, and they are the only two. It feels that way, David. So this is FTX.
00:59:51.922 - 01:00:16.754, Speaker B: They're in the lead to buy the crypto lender Voyager. Remember, that was the one that went bankrupt. Some of its assets are still worth something. Some of its customers, I assume, some of its software, and they're in a bidding war with Binance, CZ from. From Binance. So back and forth they go, trying to snap up all of these companies that have failed so hard and take their assets. Yeah.
01:00:16.792 - 01:00:39.990, Speaker A: So you said FTX bid was in the lead, but this article came out before it was disclosed that actually Binance's bid was slightly higher than FTX's, according to what this article cites as some people. So I guess citation kind of needed, but is what some people are saying. Yeah, SBF versus CZ, these two people with letters for names going after it.
01:00:40.060 - 01:00:52.986, Speaker B: Meanwhile, do Kwan is on the run. Question mark. This is the headline South Korea asked Interpol to issue, red notice for Terra co founder Doe Kwan. David, what is a red notice?
01:00:53.178 - 01:00:59.630, Speaker A: Yeah, red notice is an international agreement. It's like, yo, this person, if you find or see this person grab.
01:01:03.090 - 01:01:11.540, Speaker B: There'S like, no hiding from know. Most western countries, most countries, I think, in the world are in the Interpol red notice list, are they not?
01:01:11.990 - 01:01:32.090, Speaker A: Yes, I believe so. South Korean says they've moved to invalidate his passport days after they issued the arrest warrant. And then they have a definition of a red note. Here is a request for law enforcement worldwide to locate and arrest the named individual and hold that person until extradition processes can begin. 195 countries.
01:01:32.830 - 01:01:35.066, Speaker B: Wow. Yeah, pretty much all of them.
01:01:35.088 - 01:01:36.010, Speaker A: Can't hide, can't run.
01:01:36.080 - 01:01:56.062, Speaker B: What's weird is earlier this week, Doe Kwan tweeted this. I am not on the run, in quotes or anything similar for any government agency that has shown interest to communicate. We are in full cooperation. We don't have anything to hide. He's not on the run yet. He has an Interpol red notice after him. One of these things doesn't.
01:01:56.126 - 01:01:58.100, Speaker A: Only one of these things can check.
01:02:01.430 - 01:02:17.126, Speaker B: Like, I can't even believe all of this happened this year. Do you remember it was this year, March of this year. Doe Kwan was riding high, torching people on crypto, talking about ending die, talking about how. I don't know.
01:02:17.228 - 01:02:20.590, Speaker A: Ryan, Sean Adams doesn't know anything about crypto.
01:02:20.610 - 01:02:33.342, Speaker B: Mike Nova, do you remember that tweet tattoos? Oh, yeah, I remember that tweet. And now like months later, there's an Interpol notice for him. He's wanted in 195 countries. How crazy, how quickly.
01:02:33.476 - 01:02:55.758, Speaker A: That's one of my favorite things. Bull market shenanigans. That happened is Mike Novogratz gets the Luna wolf tattoo. You comment below that. This makes me question everything I know about crypto. Doe Kwan replies to you, don't worry, it wasn't much to begin with. And then all of the lunatics laugh at Ryan Sean Adams.
01:02:55.758 - 01:03:05.654, Speaker A: Then Tara blows up and now Doe kwan's on the run and Mike Novogradz makes a statement about like, yeah, this is going to be one of these memories I have, I have to live with for the rest of my life.
01:03:05.692 - 01:03:06.280, Speaker B: Yes.
01:03:06.730 - 01:03:08.600, Speaker A: In the last like five months.
01:03:10.490 - 01:03:13.210, Speaker B: I wouldn't believe it if you gave me the script for this movie.
01:03:14.030 - 01:03:14.938, Speaker A: No way.
01:03:15.024 - 01:03:26.238, Speaker B: This is cool. What is the tribe community doing as a result of the Rari hack? Because there was word that they weren't going to pay back victims and now maybe they're changing course and they are going to pay back.
01:03:26.404 - 01:03:27.406, Speaker A: Yeah, it looks like it.
01:03:27.428 - 01:03:27.566, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:03:27.588 - 01:04:09.610, Speaker A: The tribe Dow team has said that they are going to call it quits and this caused definitely a lot of concernation because there's plenty of assets in the tribe Dow treasury and the tribe token holders were going to vote to distribute those assets to token holders and then partially pay back people that lost money in the rari hack. Rari now part of tribe. But it actually looks like that a vote was passed on chain to fully pay back the victims inside of 24 hours from this tweet. So this should have happened by the time you are listening to this. So it looks like hack victims are being paid out in full before tribe Dow token holders are liquidating all assets the way that it should be. So nice job.
01:04:09.680 - 01:04:15.514, Speaker B: Dao's doing the right thing. Well, I wonder if there was pressure on them or they just decided to do the right thing. Well, we made certainly pressure.
01:04:15.562 - 01:04:16.570, Speaker A: I'm sure there was pressure.
01:04:16.650 - 01:04:43.986, Speaker B: Helium signs a five year agreement with T Mobile for the helium mobile launch. That is according to Coindesk. This is huge. This is from Tashar, from multicoin. Helium Mobile just launched their own cellular plans, which will combine the helium five g network and the T mobile network. Helium mobile plans will start as low as $5 per month, and subscribers will mine mobile tokens using just their phone. That's pretty crazy, David.
01:04:43.986 - 01:04:46.146, Speaker B: What is helium for people who aren't aware?
01:04:46.338 - 01:05:26.798, Speaker A: Helium is this mesh network of cellular connection. And so plenty of people, some of my friends here in Brooklyn and New York, have these little helium router node things on their roof, kind of like where you would put like a satellite dish. And so people that are walking by that are connected to the helium network can tap into your little helium node and then use that node for data. So your helium node hooks into your wifi or your Internet service provider, and then you bounce that wifi to somebody who's got their phone out, that's local to you. And these things are short range. I think it's something like maybe a quarter mile or perhaps even much less than that. But the idea is many, many people all put these on their houses.
01:05:26.798 - 01:05:41.402, Speaker A: And so in densely populated areas, you can go and get data from this helium mesh network, helium network thing. I don't really understand the tokenomics behind it. This is actually a project that I haven't really dove into much, but a partnership with T Mobile is crazy.
01:05:41.456 - 01:06:13.486, Speaker B: T Mobile, yeah. So I think the rough approximation of the token in economics is early adopters win bigger, right, as the token price appreciates. So this is kind of one of the use cases for tokens, which is how do you bootstrap an entire cellular network? And the way you do that is through token incentives, particularly reward the early adopters. And so maybe that's what's working out here. I think we should do more content on helium and figure it out in some more detail. But, yeah, it's certainly a big move here. It got our attention.
01:06:13.678 - 01:06:27.970, Speaker A: The founder of Kraken, Jesse Powell, not to be confused with Jerome Powell stepping down as CEO. So getting new leadership, and David Ripley, Kraken COO, will be taking over as CEO. So that's the news.
01:06:28.060 - 01:07:03.938, Speaker B: There you go. Jesse's watch has ended as well. Did you know, David, the Nasdaq is planning to launch an institutional crypto custody service? This is the Nasdaq stock Exchange, which is kind of weird, because at the same time Gary Gensler is talking about all your c 20 tokens. Maybe being securities and Nasdaq is getting into crypto custody. So what does that mean, I wonder? I think it's a good thing for adoption, particularly institutional adoption of crypto. I'm glad it's happening during the bear market, where people are more focused on building and not pumpy headlines. So that's cool.
01:07:03.938 - 01:07:06.370, Speaker B: David, we also have liquid collective.
01:07:07.050 - 01:07:53.838, Speaker A: Yeah, liquid collective, it's a consortium of many centralized staking as a service entities, things like Coinbase cloud, a few others, alluvial figment, and they are all coming together under this liquid collective. I haven't been able to parse out the details too deeply, but I think the gist is that this is a shared protocol, shared standard for staking as a service providers to all produce a liquid staking token. And that can help mitigate some of the concerns around centralized stakers, because if they are all forming one mega system, they're all actually checking and balancing on each other. And so that's kind of the gist here, I think more details are certainly needed, but definitely interesting development out of the liquid collective.
01:07:53.934 - 01:08:37.010, Speaker B: And speaking of Coinbase Cloud, they have just launched their platform for web3 developers. And what's cool about this? So, Coinbase Cloud, I think of it as almost like AWS for crypto, AWS for blockchain, that is, Amazon Web Services, which many of the websites that use in your daily life run on AWS. They're doing a cloud based service, but for blockchains and for crypto. And starting today, apparently developers, and this was a couple of days ago, now have free and instant blockchain API access from Coinbase cloud. So free and instant API access. And I imagine they are running this kind of a promotion to fuel adoption of coinbase cloud. It's a big entrant into the space.
01:08:37.010 - 01:08:38.482, Speaker B: Pretty excited about this.
01:08:38.616 - 01:09:03.158, Speaker A: Yeah, big moves in other worlds. FTX is reloading. They have raised a billion dollars for further acquisition strategies. So they've already been buying up all of the blood in the market and they are raising another billion dollars, adding to the $400 million that they've already raised in January so that they could buy up more deals during crypto winter. Damn.
01:09:03.254 - 01:09:24.318, Speaker B: Your move, your move. Are you going to compete with another billion? This is cool. Masari, the crypto analytics and media entity, they just announced that they raised another $35 million, this time in series B funding. And David, you've been hanging out at Masari mainet all week. What was the temperature there? What was the feeling?
01:09:24.414 - 01:10:01.046, Speaker A: Yeah, I was actually there just before recording this, moderating a panel of scaling solutions, avalanche, arbitrum, zksync and polygon. Decently populated. This is always the conference that's like one suits that are 1ft in the crypto world so can't really talk to them about EIP 4844 but can talk to them about generalized scaling ideas. So not too technical, but definitely more than crypto. Curious, I would say decently populated. Definitely successful. It's always nice to see people attending crypto conferences in bear markets.
01:10:01.046 - 01:10:05.018, Speaker A: And congratulations to Ryan Selkis leading Masari over there, raising 35 more million dollars.
01:10:05.104 - 01:10:14.814, Speaker B: Yeah, congrats to Masari on the raise there. That's a big one. Good to have more crypto media companies so we don't have stupid headlines that we have to deal with from like the Yahoo finance one I read out earlier.
01:10:14.942 - 01:10:21.614, Speaker A: Ryan. I remember Ryan Selkis's war over ripple and Brad Garlinghouse.
01:10:21.662 - 01:10:22.162, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:10:22.296 - 01:10:23.954, Speaker A: Guess who was on stage together?
01:10:24.152 - 01:10:25.630, Speaker B: No. Brad and Ryan.
01:10:25.710 - 01:10:44.250, Speaker A: Brad, how did that shirt was spicy. Definitely not. I didn't watch it myself, but I remember murmurings about this, about how this was going to happen. Ripple sponsored the event. One of my friends came up to me, James from Fireeyes. He came up to me and was like, dude, look at my hat. And it's like a ripple hat.
01:10:45.710 - 01:10:49.594, Speaker B: Old school ripple hat, huh? That's amazing. I haven't seen one of those in a long time, I guess.
01:10:49.632 - 01:10:52.460, Speaker A: Well, it's not old school, it's brand new. Ripple's still around.
01:10:53.150 - 01:10:56.302, Speaker B: It's so hard for me to believe that Ripple is still around.
01:10:56.436 - 01:10:58.462, Speaker A: I don't know why they have the market cap that they have.
01:10:58.516 - 01:11:21.298, Speaker B: It's actually pretty impressive at this point. David, it's jobs time. So while we are in a bear market, from a price perspective, we are not in a bear market for jobs. Because what happens during bear markets, builders build and they need people to help build the companies and protocols of the future for the next bull run. David, should I read out some jobs?
01:11:21.394 - 01:11:23.686, Speaker A: Go. Please do, Ryan. It's my favorite part of the weekly roll up.
01:11:23.708 - 01:11:55.710, Speaker B: All right, well, you should dance then. Solid world dow, senior web3 developer Rubicon smart contract engineer, bankless. We need a social lord. That sounds social lord. Molecule, head of engineering, a bankless, a growth marketer. Both those are what? David non technical economia needs a lead designer. A silent protocol needs a full stack software contract engineer, superform, a senior backend engineer bitgreen, a full stack developer, Masari, software engineer, market data Masari, also software engineer of media.
01:11:55.710 - 01:12:05.010, Speaker B: I could go on, but I don't have to get a job like David did. Last bull market. Excuse me, last bear market. He got a job and look at him now. You could be the next David.
01:12:05.350 - 01:12:08.340, Speaker A: Oh God, you just turned, so many people just turned it off.
01:12:09.590 - 01:12:17.158, Speaker B: Go to the bankless palette.com website to get those jobs. Be the next David or just be yourself. Now is the time to get a.
01:12:17.164 - 01:12:27.206, Speaker A: Job in crypto, we should say, instead of get a job in crypto, we should say become a crypto millionaire. Yeah, by getting a job in crypto. Is that how it works during the crypto bear market, it's one to one. It's guaranteed.
01:12:27.238 - 01:12:39.166, Speaker B: Stay tuned for David's book of ten easy steps, guys, coming up next, of course, we've got questions from the nation and some hot takes on Twitter from Hayden Adams. Dropping the spice this week.
01:12:39.188 - 01:12:39.934, Speaker A: Spicy this week.
01:12:39.972 - 01:12:45.198, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll get to that and more. But first we want to tell you about the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:12:45.364 - 01:13:24.646, Speaker A: Rocket Pool is your friendly, decentralized Ethereum staking protocol. You can stake your EtH with Rocket Pool and get our Eth in return, allowing you to stake your ETH and use it in DFI at the same time. You can get 4% on your Eth by staking it with rocket pool, but you can get even more by running a node. Rocket Pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes. Running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node, and you only need 16 ETH to get started. Why would you do this? You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled ETH, so your API is boosted. So if you're bullish east staking, you can increase your API and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network, which currently has over 1000 independent validators.
01:13:24.646 - 01:14:14.598, Speaker A: It's yield farming, but with Ethereum nodes you can get started@rocketpool.net and also join the rocket pool community in their discord. You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there. Zksync is an Ethereum layer two network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization. Zksync has combined the power of zero knowledge rollups in the Ethereum virtual machine, enabling developers to build the greatest web3 project possible ones we haven't even seen yet. Crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world, but crypto killer apps need Zksync as a platform to build on first, it's generally accepted that zero knowledge rollups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology, and Zksync is leading the charge into the final frontier of crypto economics. So if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof foundation which gives your users the best ux possible, check out Zksync's website at zksync IO.
01:14:14.598 - 01:14:18.334, Speaker A: And yes, there's also going to be a token, so give them a follow on Twitter too.
01:14:18.372 - 01:14:33.614, Speaker B: At zksync questions from the nation a reminder, you can ask the question on Twitter. Follow bankless hq on Twitter. Get your question in. We usually publish a post on Wednesday. Reply to that post with your question. It may come up on the roll up. Here is Ben Brown.
01:14:33.614 - 01:14:53.260, Speaker B: He's asking the question, could you help explain the value of running a full node, even if you don't have enough eth to be a validator, you providing any security benefits to the network? And how would that play out if someone attacked or censored the network? Ben is asking here, David, why run a node if you ain't getting paid, if you're not a staker or validator? Is there any point?
01:14:53.710 - 01:15:26.322, Speaker A: There are so many reasons why one would want to run their own node, and I think the easiest one to explain is that if you run your own node, you can point your metamask, your wallet provider to that node, and so your node natively connects to the Ethereum blockchain, or whatever blockchain you're talking about in the same way that every other node does. And so it's a first class citizen. It's hearing the same transactions, it's seeing the same data, it's taking in the same blocks as all the other nodes in the world. And so you have an ethereum node in your house.
01:15:26.376 - 01:15:27.986, Speaker B: You don't have to use infura, you.
01:15:28.008 - 01:16:01.770, Speaker A: Don'T have to use infuria. You take your wallet, your metamask, and instead of using infura, you point it to your node. And then when you write a transaction, there are no middlemen. It's going straight to the Ethereum network because you are broadcasting your own transactions. There's plenty of reasons why you would want to do this, but it's one of those it's going max bankless. And so there are no intermediaries separating your transaction from the Ethereum network. And so this is why running your own node is like part of the bankless philosophy, like having the option to run your own node is having the option to permissionlessly transact on the network.
01:16:01.770 - 01:16:17.422, Speaker A: It's nice that we have things like Infira, but it's critical that we can route around them if we need to. And that's what running your own node does. That's like the first use case for me that comes to mind as to why someone would run to run their own node. What use cases come to your head, Ryan?
01:16:17.486 - 01:17:09.110, Speaker B: Well, ultimately it's about that. It's going full bankless and taking complete sovereignty. But also I will say there's a systemic importance to this of more people running their own nodes because it is a check on other validator power, right? So if you don't want to run the Ethereum software on your own node, for example, you don't have to. It's kind of like a vote in the Ethereum network, right? And so it's really the non staking nodes are an essential part, as well as staking nodes, of course, but non staking staking nodes are an essential part of Ethereum's defense and security. It's kind of how you vote as a citizen inside of the network. And so this is the problem. If individuals don't have the ability to run their own nodes, then somebody else has to run them for them from a data center and they lose their vote.
01:17:09.110 - 01:17:45.540, Speaker B: It's sort of like some people vote in all of their local government elections, right? Some people don't. But imagine if you didn't have the ability to vote in your local government election. That would be a problem. That would mean you're no longer in a democracy. There's no longer some notion of the people rule. You might be in some different type of a network, you might be in a monarchy, you might be in a government controlled by an elite few. And that is the difference between running a node, it gives you the ability to vote in the network itself.
01:17:45.910 - 01:18:31.338, Speaker A: Take for example, if two big entities like Coinbase or Lido had like the army march in, even though Lido is actually 24 people. But say, for example, there's one person the army marches in, holds a gun to these people's heads and say, hey, install this new client on your validators and make the Ethereum blockchain update to this client. Think of nodes as minority power. So all two thirds of east stakers have a gun to their head. Say, hey, install this ofac version of Ethereum. And now we have two thirds of proof of stake validators going in that direction. It's the nodes that don't install that software that actually have the say, because then we'll have a chain split and the community is going with the non OFAC version of Ethereum.
01:18:31.338 - 01:19:03.222, Speaker A: And that version of Ethereum will win if the community says it will, and the community says that it will by running that node. And it's the same reason why bitcoin won versus bitcoin cash in 2016 2017. It's because the bitcoin community chose to run the bitcoin as we know it node software and also bought that version of bitcoin and prompt up the market price of that version of bitcoin. So running your own node is like how you have minority power over ETh stakers, no matter the size of the stake.
01:19:03.286 - 01:19:28.020, Speaker B: This is a question I think that's related. It's from Matt. Why are mobile phones not the ultimate device for solo staking? They're always connected on Wi Fi or cell. Landline doesn't work, and their battery feed for them lasts hours in case of electricity shortages. What about this idea? Why not stake on a mobile phone? It seems like this would be the ultimate computer for a validator or staker for someone to run their own non staking node itself.
01:19:28.390 - 01:20:01.450, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really good question. And there's definitely the possibility of mobile phones becoming staking. And the timing of this question is actually really interesting because we just recorded an episode with Vitalik Buterin where we talked about this, where not only can we reduce the ether requirements for staking nodes potentially down to like eight ether, but we can actually reduce the hardware requirements down to a cell phone. So why can't we do this today? I don't know what the exact bottleneck is. Bandwidth I don't think is the issue. Cpu power definitely could be an issue. Hard drive space, perhaps an issue.
01:20:01.450 - 01:20:15.374, Speaker A: But then as soon as we get into light clients, which are like clients that don't have a lot of data stored with them, but are still fully self sovereign clients, then we do start to unlock cell phone staking. This is a thing.
01:20:15.572 - 01:20:29.270, Speaker B: There was an app you could just download on your phone that was just the staking app, the theorem app. Right. It's just so much easier. Just one click and you have it and you're running a staking node on your phone. That sounds pretty badass.
01:20:29.610 - 01:20:39.926, Speaker A: Yeah. The bigger concern is you're taking your phone into wherever you're going, right. So if you lose your phone, you're going to need to be able to.
01:20:39.948 - 01:20:46.300, Speaker B: Recover those account abstraction. David, social recovery. We'll get there. We'll figure that out.
01:20:46.830 - 01:20:50.426, Speaker A: One of the infinity problems we have left in this space takes of the week.
01:20:50.528 - 01:21:25.718, Speaker B: Let's talk about the first one. This is from Joe Weisenthal. He says, I genuinely think that with the merge now having happened, much of the institutional crypto space, think vcs, etc. They're now going to turn sharply against bitcoin. The Ponzi scams and fads built on ethereum are now ESG, and this will be used as a regulatory cudgel against proof of work chains. So Joe making the case that because ethereum is proof of stake, doesn't have the energy consumption baggage that bitcoin does, it will now be the institutional crypto chain. What do you think about this?
01:21:25.884 - 01:21:33.846, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, this is one of the things we've been saying for a long time. Joe Weisenthal, of course, co host of the OD Lots podcast out of Bloomberg.
01:21:33.878 - 01:21:35.558, Speaker B: So this is pretty crypto skeptical.
01:21:35.734 - 01:21:53.710, Speaker A: He's crypto. Yes, he's definitely crypto skeptical, but definitely also pays attention really close with like, Nick Carter and people like that. Like the academic side of. But yeah, like, Bitcoin has an extremely uphill battle to fight with this whole energy consumption thing. And I don't know how they get through that.
01:21:53.860 - 01:22:16.018, Speaker B: Here's maybe how they do get through that. David. This is a take from Dan held, notable bitcoiner, longtime bitcoiner. I would call Dan a maximalist. And he tweets this, say no to bitcoin fundamentalism. And then someone asked the question of, what does fundamentalism look like? Bitcoin fundamentalism. And it's saying things like, alts are immoral.
01:22:16.018 - 01:22:28.842, Speaker B: According to Dan, lending is immoral, vcs are immoral, making money is immoral. This is maybe bitcoin hardliners softening a little bit, getting more pragmatic. Is that what this is looking like to you?
01:22:28.976 - 01:23:12.390, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm actually in email correspondence with Dan about potentially scheduling a show because I replied to this like, hey, I would love to talk about bitcoin fundamentalism versus bitcoin rationalism. This fundamentalism term is new, and I think that's a strategic. Not using the word maximalist, because I think Dan held would self identify as, like, I'm fully focused on the bitcoin ecosystem. Maybe he wouldn't call himself a bitcoin maximalist in the same way we don't call ourselves ethereum maximalists, but other people call us that, and other people call Dan held that. So if we do get Dan held on the show, I'd love to see where he draws the line between bitcoin fundamentalism and bitcoin maximalism. Because I'm pretty sure Dan held is going to ride proof of work or die. I think that's a strongly held belief.
01:23:12.470 - 01:23:28.702, Speaker B: I do too. He's going to ride bitcoin or die, probably. But I will say this is a narrative pivot, I think, for the bitcoin fundamentalist community or the bitcoin community as a whole. They're definitely looking at this and saying, hey, people don't like us.
01:23:28.836 - 01:23:32.480, Speaker A: Y'all are crazy. We're losing Corey Clipston. You're crazy.
01:23:34.370 - 01:23:54.470, Speaker B: This is a take from Hayden Adams, of course, the founder of Uniswap. In my opinion, thinking about Ethereum haters as a singular group is not particularly useful. He says most people outside of crypto Twitter are not haters or like Ors. I couldn't give less of a shit about Ethereum except for how it affects things. I actually care about Ors.
01:23:55.930 - 01:23:58.534, Speaker A: Really overusing the ors meme, but I love it.
01:23:58.572 - 01:23:59.314, Speaker B: Maybe underusing.
01:23:59.362 - 01:24:11.274, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, I'm just reminded of that line that the opposite of love isn't hate, it's indifference. So a lot of people just don't care about crypto, except for the fact that we're consuming a ton of energy, except a lot less these days until.
01:24:11.312 - 01:24:16.606, Speaker B: We build stuff for them that they care about. Yes, exactly. Another take by Hayden. You want to read this?
01:24:16.708 - 01:24:48.598, Speaker A: Yeah. Crypto people blame others for being anti crypto, but it's because one, crypto has elevated horrible spokespeople. Yeah. Two, crypto industry spends too much time fighting and arguing, both internally and externally for theoretical futures rather than actively demonstrating value in the present. Yeah, I'd say that's an accurate summary. Although I will also say that crypto very much needs to look into the future to see what it will become. Because there are many, many potential versions of crypto and we need to make sure that we find the right one.
01:24:48.598 - 01:24:50.550, Speaker A: So you do have to look into the future.
01:24:50.700 - 01:25:05.646, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. And I don't think Hayden is saying don't look into the future. I think what he's saying is, let's build. Let's build something really useful. This is the call during the bear market for sure. David, this is another take. And I enjoyed this tweet out of bankless as well.
01:25:05.646 - 01:25:09.594, Speaker B: It says, what's your most cancelable take? We got a lot of good cancelable takes, Ryan.
01:25:09.642 - 01:25:13.550, Speaker A: Sean, Adam says it's okay to have a bank account. Hey, don't repeat that.
01:25:13.620 - 01:25:22.466, Speaker B: Don't repeat that. It's not for the roll up. Okay. That was just the cancelable take. But seriously, it is okay to have a bank account. I have a bank account. David has a bank account.
01:25:22.466 - 01:25:24.210, Speaker B: What's this take from John?
01:25:24.360 - 01:25:49.850, Speaker A: Yeah, this is John. And he says John from Delphi, who wrote that insane reports on both Ethereum, threadmap and roll up. So very well informed guy. And he says roll ups today mostly aren't actual roll ups, and one of them will likely suffer a major hack at some point, which will make people question the whole plan to begin with. There's also a picture of a guide, like dropping a grenade into down a stairwell. It's a pretty good picture.
01:25:50.590 - 01:25:56.762, Speaker B: What you do mean by that? Roll ups aren't actually roll ups, is it? Because we have some relaxed security assumptions?
01:25:56.906 - 01:26:02.462, Speaker A: Yeah. If you want to go to l twobeat.org. Oh my God, I knew you're going there, right?
01:26:02.516 - 01:26:02.734, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:26:02.772 - 01:26:20.134, Speaker A: So there's all these different risks that we need to plug. And so there are arbitrum, one, optimism, dydx loopering. All of these things still can be upgraded. They still haven't burned the private keys. Right. And so that still needs to happen. There's still like fraud proofs that are needed.
01:26:20.134 - 01:26:44.822, Speaker A: So there's like six or seven or eight different pieces that you need to have complete before you call yourself a roll up. And John is just saying roll ups are just like incomplete. They are missing pieces before they can fully call themselves a roll up. I will say though, while he's totally right, still yet to have a single roll up, having a big exploit, and almost, it seems every single cross layer one bridge has gotten.
01:26:44.886 - 01:27:14.866, Speaker B: You better knock on David, because things could change quickly. I know there was an exploit bug that was found on Arbitrum earlier this week. We didn't fit it into the roll up, but that happened. So these types of things can happen for sure. And I do think that it is probably true that some of these roll ups are kind of like they're side chains with a path towards a roll up future. Right. Until they fully take care of upgradability, state validation, validator failure, all of these risk scenarios, they do have some risk.
01:27:14.866 - 01:27:23.682, Speaker B: They operate a bit more like sidechains. Now. The difference between sidechains and roll up is they have a path to get there, the other side, and be fully secured by Ethereum.
01:27:23.746 - 01:27:24.826, Speaker A: They actually have a future.
01:27:24.928 - 01:27:30.586, Speaker B: They actually have a path to get there. They actually have a future. Let me ask you the question though, David. What are you bullish on this week?
01:27:30.608 - 01:27:59.046, Speaker A: My friend Ryan, you know that merge video that I made that like 15 minutes what is the Ethereum merge video? And it got, like, 20, 30,000 views and got us a bunch of new subscribers. And it was, like, very edited. And you know how we are, like, how long are we at right now? We are at 1 hour and 31 minutes into the weekly roll up. And we keep on talking about how we have to trim down these goddamn weekly roll ups. And then we do it once and then we never do it again. Same thing with a podcast. We record a podcast with Vitalik, and we just need to talk about everything.
01:27:59.046 - 01:28:01.462, Speaker A: So it's an hour and 45 goddamn minutes.
01:28:01.516 - 01:28:03.814, Speaker B: Part one, part two, part two, part.
01:28:03.852 - 01:28:07.414, Speaker A: Episode of Vitalik because we can't do short episodes. You know how this is a problem.
01:28:07.452 - 01:28:10.522, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. That's the problem. Yeah. Why are you talking about it now?
01:28:10.656 - 01:28:15.894, Speaker A: Yeah, so I've got, like, four of those videos, like, in the hopper with 415 minutes.
01:28:15.942 - 01:28:16.954, Speaker B: Videos. Yeah.
01:28:16.992 - 01:28:40.098, Speaker A: One's 18 minutes, one's twelve minutes. One's like three minutes. What is ethereum? What is eth? Why this one's my favorite. Why is crypto full of scams? I'm known to write very long essays, but when you take these long essays and you read them really fast into a teleprompter and then give that to your editors, and they make a YouTube video out of that, all of a sudden, David's infamously long essays turn into very short YouTube videos.
01:28:40.184 - 01:28:40.818, Speaker B: Wow.
01:28:40.984 - 01:28:54.086, Speaker A: Yeah. So all that's coming on a brand new bankless YouTube channel. And so this is coming out shortly, soon. So stay tuned for that. This is going to be the hyper YouTube optimized side of bankless, and ya Boy is pioneering it.
01:28:54.108 - 01:29:04.006, Speaker B: I feel like this is the point in the show where we should edit and subscribe to the new YouTube channel with a big button. If people are watching this on YouTube, do we have that capability yet? Is the channel shit?
01:29:04.038 - 01:29:07.340, Speaker A: You're totally right. No, it'll be out, like, next Wednesday or something.
01:29:07.710 - 01:29:09.818, Speaker B: Almost. All right, stay tuned, though.
01:29:09.984 - 01:29:14.794, Speaker A: I'll talk about it next week, too, for all the people that are sticking around. Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:29:14.912 - 01:29:32.034, Speaker B: Just like I already said it. The building. The building that's going on. I've never seen a time where more building is happening in crypto. More developers. You know, the thing that they always say is like, follow the. It's like if you follow the developers, then you follow them regardless of what the price is.
01:29:32.034 - 01:29:53.740, Speaker B: I mean, people can be bearish if they want, but I'm going to be here following the developers. And what are they doing? They're working on the ETH roadmap. That looks better than I've ever seen. Episode where Vitalik goes through it. Coming out on Monday. Layer twos. The building that's going on across all of the team like ZK teams Zke EVM happening faster than anyone thought.
01:29:53.740 - 01:30:15.870, Speaker B: We're building on optimism, building on arbitram DFI that's being built out. I think there will be a DFI 20. It was not the DFI 20 that we sort of saw the meeting around. Yeah, it'll be a real DFI 20, which has all sorts of new ideas that we've not even contemplated. Nfts are building. It's all of these new discoveries ahead of us.
01:30:15.940 - 01:30:18.240, Speaker A: Building nfts we're building.
01:30:19.190 - 01:30:39.602, Speaker B: I just feel like when you have this amount of talent and developer capability, space, being bearish on crypto right now is like, okay, cool. Be bearish on the Internet. Be bearish on humanity. Be bearish on software and code. Where did that get you the last 20 years? Go be bearish on those things. That's fine. I'll be settling.
01:30:39.666 - 01:30:40.354, Speaker A: I see Ryan.
01:30:40.402 - 01:30:52.780, Speaker B: I'll be holding. It's going to be okay. And I'm excited that there's still a bankless audience for us on the other side of this because we're going to come out stronger as we follow the developers, as we keep building.
01:30:53.090 - 01:30:54.622, Speaker A: David, what do we have?
01:30:54.676 - 01:30:55.662, Speaker B: Meme of the week.
01:30:55.796 - 01:30:56.974, Speaker A: Meme of the week. Let's do it.
01:30:57.012 - 01:30:59.600, Speaker B: Let's look at this. I thought this was great.
01:31:00.690 - 01:31:43.114, Speaker A: So this is actually going to be kind of hard to explain, but we have two dudes and another dude, and one dude is explaining to two dudes and they're at a party. And then the title is when I accidentally use personality a with friend group b. And the solo dude is like, I'm stoked that the ethereum proof of stake upgrade was successful. Looking forward to tracking my staking yields over the next few weeks. And then the other two dudes who are both wearing football sweatshirts saying, proof of what? What the fuck are you talking about? And then bankless, the bankless Instagram dms, this dude who is talking about proof of stake at the party, and he goes Bankless, says, hey, how's the party? And the guy says, horrible. And he's just crying. He's just, yeah, I guess this meme works more when you look at it.
01:31:43.152 - 01:32:19.938, Speaker B: You know what? It's funny to me because it kind of works in real life. I have a whole bunch of Internet friends where I could celebrate the merge with right. But I don't have that many in real life friends who just care at all about the merge, about Ethereum, and if I brought up to my in real life Normie friends, hey, the merge was awesome this week. What are you talking about? Get out of nerd. So I don't know if this is like you or maybe David, your life, you've better integrated kind of like your in real life friends with your crypto friends, and they're one in the same, but for me, it's very much two different groups.
01:32:20.114 - 01:32:31.806, Speaker A: So my mom's birthday was the day of the merge, and so I called her up, and I was like, mom, do you know what day it is? And she, of course, thinks I'm talking about her birthday. Oh, no.
01:32:31.988 - 01:32:34.830, Speaker B: I hope you were in that moment. I hope you pivoted.
01:32:36.210 - 01:33:06.920, Speaker A: She's like, yeah. And I go, it's the day of the merch. Okay. My mom remembers when I had these gpu miners in different corners of my dad's house. And so my mom, being, like, the liberal environmentalist that she is, she always, like, this is consuming how much electricity? And so she goes, what's the merge? And I tell her, this is the day that Ethereum mitigates all mining. And it goes, proof of stake, and we eliminate all of our energy consumption. You know what she says?
01:33:07.690 - 01:33:12.922, Speaker B: That's great. I love the happy birthday, mom.
01:33:12.976 - 01:33:14.262, Speaker A: And then I wish her a happy birthday.
01:33:14.326 - 01:33:28.400, Speaker B: Okay, perfect. Good ordering on that, David. Well, that was a gift to your mom, then. Didn't know that the merge and environment effects were all about a gift to your mother, but that's great, David. Should we end it here?
01:33:28.850 - 01:33:42.334, Speaker A: So we do have a moment of Zen, and this moment of Zen is coming out of. He's this, if you're not familiar with him, he's this absurdist meme Joker account on crypto Twitter, and it's pretty funny. But first, Ryan's going to read you some disclaimers.
01:33:42.382 - 01:33:50.818, Speaker B: Of course, eth is risky. Got to tell you, none of this has been financial advice. All of crypto is. So is Defi. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier.
01:33:50.818 - 01:33:55.350, Speaker B: It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
01:33:55.500 - 01:33:58.934, Speaker A: My friend told me that he's waiting.
01:33:58.982 - 01:34:20.046, Speaker B: For ETH to hit $500 before he buys. And I said to him, well, EtH only hit 800 because Suzu and Kyle needed to liquidate their entire portfolio at the bottom. So it's very unlikely that we get to those numbers again, unless there's some.
01:34:20.068 - 01:34:22.350, Speaker A: Sort of catastrophic liquidation.
01:34:22.950 - 01:34:25.460, Speaker B: And he says to me, well, you know what?
01:34:25.990 - 01:34:28.274, Speaker A: The macro is getting bad.
01:34:28.392 - 01:34:31.940, Speaker B: The macro is going to send SPX to 200.
01:34:33.830 - 01:34:37.518, Speaker A: You're a goddamn barista, sir, not a macro trader.
01:34:37.694 - 01:34:39.350, Speaker B: Just buy Ethan, shut up.
