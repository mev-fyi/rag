00:00:00.090 - 00:00:14.670, Speaker A: I think crypto is one of the more interesting things, because it's like, if we zoom out enough, you could argue that the entire goal of crypto is just to make organizations that can do commerce with each other on the Internet.
00:00:17.250 - 00:00:18.526, Speaker B: Welcome to Layer Zero.
00:00:18.628 - 00:00:27.126, Speaker C: Layer Zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the Ethereum community. Crypto is built by code Bisc, composed by people, and each individual member of.
00:00:27.148 - 00:00:29.702, Speaker B: The crypto community has their own story to tell.
00:00:29.836 - 00:00:32.998, Speaker C: Cipherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it.
00:00:33.004 - 00:00:38.922, Speaker B: And layer Zero focuses on the people behind the code, because ethereum is people all the way down, and it always has been.
00:00:39.056 - 00:00:40.618, Speaker C: Today on Layer Zero, I'm talking with.
00:00:40.624 - 00:01:24.134, Speaker B: Tarun Chitra, who's generally known as one of those giga brain math wizards on crypto, Twitter, and around. And Tarun is so good at math, so fluent in math, that he actually comes out the other side, and he's actually really creative about it. So he's like a creative math geek, I'd say. And you can definitely see that in his style of his clothes and apparel. But this episode turned out to be less about the creative side of math and the beauty of math. We do touch on that at the end, but more about the relationship between regulation and finance. And we talk about how smart contracts are more of an innovation in the legal space more than they are in the financial space.
00:01:24.134 - 00:02:06.418, Speaker B: And we unpack the fact that finance is really just the combination of money and law. Money and contracts is how you create finance. And we talk about how United States regulation is perhaps holding back the truer manifestation of this world of finance, not just inside of crypto, but outside of crypto, and how this incumbent regulation actually slows us down in the way that states can engage with each other. And what if we had interstate law agreements that were based on smart contract, rather than a federal system, which was very slow? So some very hypothetical, zoomed out applications of what it means to have smart contract law is code law. So let's go ahead and get right.
00:02:06.424 - 00:02:08.306, Speaker C: Into this conversation with Tarun, right after.
00:02:08.328 - 00:02:11.766, Speaker B: We talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible.
00:02:11.948 - 00:02:43.326, Speaker C: Slingshot is a decentralized trading platform that combines the performance and ease of a centralized exchange with the openness and transparency of DeFi. Slingshot aggregates liquidity from all of Defi in order to find the best price on thousands of crypto assets. Every token on Slingshot comes with a price chart and trade logs to give you insights into the market's activity. In real time. Slingshot is available on polygon, arbitrums and optimism, saving you from the high gas fees and low transaction speeds of the Ethereum. L one there are no fees to trade on Slingshot, and any positive slippage is given to the users. Trading on Slingshot is a social experience.

00:04:34.550 - 00:04:36.260, Speaker B: Hey trun, how's it going?
00:04:36.630 - 00:04:38.260, Speaker A: Great. How about you?
00:04:38.890 - 00:04:59.740, Speaker B: Absolutely fantastic. Trun. I think you have a very interesting position in the crypto industry, and I think it's one. What I want to parse apart is are you more analytical and math focused or are you more creative and art focused? And I actually don't know the answer to this question and so do you.
00:05:00.670 - 00:05:54.510, Speaker A: I don't think I know the answer to this question, but I will say it's like a coin flip every day. I prefer it having some randomness and kind of things changing. I also think there's kind of like a sense in which there's like phases and seasons for things. For me, sometimes there's a time where it's like people are more in the production mode and creating things mode. And other times you're like, consuming things, you want to read things, go see movies, go places, stuff like that. And I tend to think of things more in that dichotomy of, like, am I in a production mode or consumption mode and how are things changing? And that usually guides that. But I think kind of I try to stay in the middle as much as possible.
00:05:54.660 - 00:06:32.458, Speaker B: I think if somebody is watching on the YouTube, they would look at you and be like, oh, that's definitely an artist. He got Colorful, stripey shirt, got colorful glasses, got a colored hair. But I think if somebody looked at your Twitter, they would think like, oh, this is the biggest math gigabrain, theoretical physics type brain person. And so it's interesting to see that you, I think, are very much on a barbell, as in, you know, math and cryptography to the nth degree. But you know it so well that you've actually been able to make creative stuff out of it. You're fluent in math to the point that it becomes creative for you.
00:06:32.624 - 00:07:29.050, Speaker A: I think there's always some element of that. But I think one of the things that I, in retrospect, got lucky with was I didn't go do a PhD. I think after undergrad I was like, oh, I got into a bunch of PhD programs. I was going to go do my PhD. But then effectively it sort of became, I don't know, I just got a little weirded out by like, hey, you have to pick a field now, and then you have to stick in it for seven years. And I kind of had this wanderlust of, like, I like some fields, there are many math related fields. Why do I have to pick one and get stuck in it for seven years? And then even after being stuck in it for seven years, there's like no jobs at the end, and there are a lot of problems with academia.
00:07:29.050 - 00:08:16.458, Speaker A: So I feel like that just led me to be like, all right, well, I'm going to try to optimize for what city you can have the most fun in. And then that just led me to kind of move back and forth between all these different worlds. And I think living in New York, especially post financial crisis, I feel like there was actually quite a bit of unbridled creativity here. And I think that was like a fluke, luck in time type of thing. I think in general, it's easy to get stuck in one thing, and I think I just personally always had a little bit of an aversion to that.
00:08:16.544 - 00:08:18.090, Speaker B: When did you move to New York?
00:08:18.240 - 00:09:15.614, Speaker A: 2011. Okay. So just long enough after the financial crisis that things started getting back to normal, I feel like. But also around the time that San Francisco was starting to have this kind of grow and have this economic boom, and from my perspective, attract all the assholes from New York to go ruin the Bay Area. So I found that also to be a great time to be here because a lot of people who are kind of shitty left. That's like a weird reason to be like, I love this city because all these people left. But I feel like there was a while, probably 2000, where people were like, New York.
00:09:15.614 - 00:09:38.022, Speaker A: It's like the finance, bro, stereotype. Real estate, Trump, Wall street, bro, whatever type of thing. And with the younger versions of those people, a whole generation of them just didn't go to New York and went San Francisco, which was great. And that actually, I feel like, was good for music and arts here in a lot of ways.
00:09:38.156 - 00:09:43.202, Speaker B: Yeah. How would you characterize the city now? Have you been in New York ever since 2011?
00:09:43.346 - 00:10:31.042, Speaker A: Yes. So I've been here for eleven years. Yeah, I don't think the pandemic is over here. So I've definitely traveled a bunch in the last year and have kind of come to the conclusion that people in New York were very scarred by the original part of the pandemic and haven't quite got. Okay, here's a great example. This week, I believe on Monday, all indoor mask restrictions were removed everywhere in New York, and yet you cannot go on the subway and find very many people not wearing masks, in spite of the fact that people are just so wired to that. Right.
00:10:31.042 - 00:11:31.754, Speaker A: So I would say things have changed a little bit because of that, and people are more mobile. So there are a lot more people who are, myself included, who are kind of like, hey, I'll move around in winter and go somewhere warmer and come back. So I feel like there's kind of this interesting thing going on where a lot of people are who were full time New York residents or like part time New York residents, but there's also way more people here right now than I've ever seen. So it feels like post pandemic, there were just a lot of people who were stuck in the suburbs at home for months. My theory is that they just hit some turning point where we need to be around fucking people. And lo and behold, you got this huge increase in the population, especially in Brooklyn. Manhattan, I think, is actually lower than its population pre pandemic, but Brooklyn and queens are way higher.
00:11:31.754 - 00:11:34.122, Speaker A: And so that's been kind of an interesting.
00:11:34.256 - 00:11:50.474, Speaker B: Yeah, Brooklyn has turned into. Would you say the Brooklyn's kind of turned into a new shelling point? Definitely for crypto. Don't actually, honestly, I don't know anything about any industry that's not crypto at this point because I'm so into crypto. But everyone seems to be moving to Brooklyn.
00:11:50.602 - 00:12:34.350, Speaker A: I think that's definitely true for people in tech related. Okay. There's a ton of people who have come from SF. I call them the Fang refugees, and they've sort of all moved en masse. And you can see this in New York in a funny way, in that kind of the shitty, not very artistic, but very modern buildings are. All the rents for those skyrocketed, but the rents for the brownstones are the same. So I think it's true for tech people, especially tech people who want to get out of California.
00:12:34.350 - 00:13:02.166, Speaker A: And then I also think this whole Miami Austin Denver thing was oversold. And having been to all three of those cities this year or in the last twelve months, let's say, sorry, I'm not convinced they've built up this whatever tech hub shit that you see in the New York Times. You know what I'm talking. You were just there. It doesn't feel like it's really there. It feels like it's kind of flimsy at best.
00:13:02.348 - 00:13:28.158, Speaker B: Yeah. Denver always has had some sort of presence in web3, but I don't see it growing. Miami I do see growing. And Austin, I see a lot of people moving towards just generally. But again, Brooklyn is definitely up there in places that people are going towards. And it definitely seems to have like a frontier of technology. Frontier of just like human exploration and innovation kind of vibe to it.
00:13:28.244 - 00:14:08.006, Speaker A: Yeah, kind of in a weird way, because I think people, if you went to another country and you're like, okay, what is like the most innovative part of the US. And, like, 99% of them would just say, like, Silicon Valley, SF, something like that, right? Does not seem to be true at all right now. Or at least I feel like a lot of really smart people took advantage of being remote and are just like, I'm never going back to that shithole. And that seems to be what has happened. I actually feel like Europe also. London also felt like this super alive. I mean, London is post pandemic.
00:14:08.006 - 00:15:14.638, Speaker A: New York is like on the precipice of crossing the Rubicon, but it's not quite there. But yeah, London also felt like really back alive in a way, like, way more than I remember it. So I think it's cool that the world is kind of having these new centers, but personally, I'm actually more excited for Latin America. I kind of feel like, in the same way that Asia leapfrogged the US by skipping building landlines and stuff like that and went straight to mobile, I kind of feel like Latin America is going to skip the venmo era and go straight to, like. It feels like they're just way more primed for it right now than I was living and moving between cities in Latin America. And pre pandemic, no one took credit card. Absolutely no one took credit card.
00:15:14.638 - 00:15:45.882, Speaker A: If you had a credit card, you're already looked at a little bit weirdly and someone know it was already kind of like a weird thing. This time. I went to Mexico City, Bogota, other places, south, like Chile. Everyone takes credit card, everyone is taking tap to pay stuff. And I kind of just feel like there's this weird chance that the US gets leapfrogged by Latin America and maybe Africa, although I haven't been there, so I don't know what to say, but.
00:15:46.016 - 00:16:12.846, Speaker B: That'S definitely aligned with what I'm hearing from. I did a podcast with Santiago Siri. Santi Siri? Yeah. Talking about the rate of crypto adoption in Argentina. And he says that everyone's got crypto on their phones and they use, actually, binance, the binance exchange. They all have binance accounts. And so when they're sending stablecoins, they go from binance account to binance account because they can't pay for the ethereum fees.
00:16:12.846 - 00:16:40.410, Speaker B: So they're all using the binance exchange, not BNB, not binance chain, but like, binance decentralized exchange. And that's how they pay with stables in just using the binance exchange. And he said that Vitalik's recognition, like Vitalik as a celebrity status, is bled out from the crypto community. And now it's just the regular argentine society where Vitalik is a superstar and regular argentine societies using crypto.
00:16:41.550 - 00:17:25.820, Speaker A: I think Argentina has always been at the head of everyone because of all of their kind of debt failures historically. But Mexico, if you asked me in 2019 if Mexico was going to be a big crypto place, I would have said not really, because I'd gone there a bunch of times. And I don't mean like Tulum and that type of, I mean like actual Mexico City, like mexican people who are using digital assets. Because I was like, everyone wants to use cash there. Everyone's like, we just want cash. We hate credit cards. And the pandemic for them seems to have really made them suddenly embrace digital finance way more.
00:17:25.820 - 00:17:59.940, Speaker A: And I think the interesting thing there is that the apps that people use are way more like one stop fits all type things. Their app for a Robin Hood like thing does. It's like revolute. It's like an even more crazy version of revolut. You can trade stocks, you can send stables to each other, you can buy crypto, you can buy insurance in app. It's actually kind of crazy because it's easier than anything you get in the US.
00:18:00.310 - 00:18:35.854, Speaker B: I'm seeing this trend. I think we're seeing this trend across the, like in China, they have the super apps, right? And FTX is kind of turning into like a financial superstructure. It's a bank, it's a crypto exchange, it's got derivatives, it just got an integration with stripe for payments. They're doing nfts, they're doing it all right. And so I'm seeing kind of like a converge onto. If you don't build an app that does everything, then you're going to be bought or your services are just going to be integrated. Are you seeing the same trend for sure?
00:18:35.892 - 00:19:18.846, Speaker A: I think in the US you don't see it because there's tons of regulation reasons. And for instance, insurance, right? The fact that I can go into an app in Mexico and buy car insurance and it's like five steps and I'm done. I literally just take pictures of the car, and then you have car insurance. And then here it's like every state has a different law. And to be an insurer in each state, you have to have deposit capital with each state's registry. It's just natural that the US is going to be last in the aggregator game because there's just too much state by state financial regulation. Whereas I think in places like in Latin America and Africa, this aggregator thing works insanely well.
00:19:18.846 - 00:20:24.050, Speaker A: The binance and FTX examples are like their american branches of all these exchanges are kind of not that great, right? Like volume wise, user wise, but their international stuff is insane. And I think they're all private companies, so we don't know. But I would love to see the breakdown of latin american and african users, not in terms of dollar amounts, because if you try to say, hey, who transfers the most? Obviously it's going to be the Wales in China and american institutions or whatever. But if we actually do some more transaction count based type of thing, how many users who are regularly using certain things, I wouldn't be surprised to see somewhere like Mexico went from 50th to second since the pandemic, which is like, that's like an interesting trend. And so definitely recommend going and taking a little tour just to see how behavior has changed.
00:20:25.590 - 00:20:37.480, Speaker B: Do you think that the leapfrogging of the United States just in general is because many other countries in the world just don't have the same, just sheer volume and magnitude of regulations that we.
00:20:39.790 - 00:21:42.190, Speaker A: Think? I think part of it is the regulation, but part of it is also know Matt Levine, this Bloomberg calmness, he always says everything is security's law. Someone can commit a crime or kill someone, but then if you look at the statistics, half the time it will be like, hey, they didn't pay their taxes. That was like how all the Mafia Rico stuff happened in the. None of them were really arrested for the murder crimes because. But a lot of them were arrested for tax evasion. Maybe a less pithy version of this is like, in the US, financial law is the strongest seeming law here, right? It seems like if you can convert some type of social more into a, hey, like there's some financial mismanagement here, you can get your case through more quickly. And the system seems to work only for those cases.
00:21:42.190 - 00:22:22.650, Speaker A: And I just don't think that's necessarily true in most places. Because of that, we have this somewhat onerous system. And the leapfrogging I think will be interesting in that. I remember in the early 2000s, Japan was still kind of like viewed as the most technologically sophisticated, whereas right now it's probably like, I don't. Taiwan, Singapore. Right? And Japan seems a little old. It's still stuck in sort of like the Sony era.
00:22:22.650 - 00:23:14.106, Speaker A: And I think an interesting thing was like everyone was like, oh, Asia completely leapfrogged the US. They went straight to mobile, never did. Everyone has 100 mbit Internet in their house. But yet if we look at what products ended up being distributed the most, it ended up coming from South Korea and the US, Apple and Samsung. So the leapfrog might just be a good way of we, if we play the game out, two know, Latin America and Africa, Leapfrog, the US. You see some huge companies get built out of there, and then people in the US are copying that, and then they are able to effectively lobby Congress to basically give some exemptions to things that look like the things they see outside that are working and successful. And then the US can kind of innovate that.
00:23:14.106 - 00:24:09.738, Speaker A: Like, I could totally see that ending up being a thing. I think the mobile thing was actually. It's a similar regulatory thing, but sort of different in that in the US there's sort of spectra, so the frequency, radio frequencies, the frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum, there are certain frequencies the government has dictated that they own, and you have to buy licenses to broadcast on those frequencies from them. And so there's this thing called a spectrum auction, and it's almost like a patent, like the government gives you the rights to that. 102.5 radio stations usually lease their frequency from someone else. So the spectrum auction actually kind of kept the US back in a lot of mobile stuff.
00:24:09.738 - 00:24:51.626, Speaker A: That's the reason five G is taking forever, is people can't actually get that. There are a few players who own the spectrum, and they're not the technology providers. They're like the comcast type of companies that bought up all the spectrum a long time ago. And I think basically what happened is South Korea leapfrog the US, and now there's all this pressure. And this is why five G was in the news right before the pandemic where the US government's like, we can't get left behind, we're willing to do anything, and it plays catch up. And I kind of feel like that's how it always is. Someone figures out how to do something somewhere easier and it blows up in a good way, grows really fast.
00:24:51.626 - 00:25:09.694, Speaker A: And then the US suddenly is, ah, capitalism must run. So I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. I think it's actually a good forcing function because it kind of is like a way to give a narrative to regulators to be like, yo, this is fucking like, you should allow certain types of things to happen.
00:25:09.892 - 00:25:32.866, Speaker B: So is the pattern that's unfolding here. We're America, we have american exceptionalism. We're in the lead. We have all the money, we have all the talent. But then we rest on our laurels. And regulation perhaps kind of disincentivizes innovation. And so because of this disincentive to get up and do something because of regulation.
00:25:32.866 - 00:26:08.066, Speaker B: We let somebody else do it, but then we see that being innovated somewhere else, and then we're like, all right, well, we were resting on our laurels too much. Now we got to get up and go. And so we make an exception in the regulation to capture that new innovation that was made offshore to bring it home to America. And then we innovate on that, build that out, and then we can rest on our laurels again. So it feels like we're the hair in a tortoise in a hair race, where we go really fast, we sit down, we take a breather, we rest on our laurels because we're Americans and we're awesome. And then innovation continues. The march of innovation continues elsewhere because they don't have the same regulations that we have.
00:26:08.066 - 00:26:21.430, Speaker B: And then at some point, something inevitably crops up out of just pure, unbridled innovation that's unbridled by regulation elsewhere outside of America. And then we just repeat this process. Is that a fair way to describe?
00:26:22.250 - 00:26:34.362, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like an iterated tortoise in the hair. The hare only realizes it's losing the race when the tortoise is like 5ft from the end and then suddenly runs and just tries to play catch up.
00:26:34.496 - 00:26:35.274, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:35.472 - 00:27:42.510, Speaker A: But I think that's generally the whale versus minnow dynamic that often happens even in other types of games, abstractly, where the whale with a lot of resources gets lazy or they have too much concentration of power, wealth, resources, and then that just has a sclerosis thing effect, and then someone more nimble kind of takes advantage of that. And then eventually the whale is like, oh, shit, I got to save myself. And the question is, how many rounds of this can we survive? Right? The pandemic was like a weird. That's like playing chess, and someone just in the middle of your chess game randomly removes, like, 50% of the board spaces, and you're like, all right, you have to play now. And anything that doesn't have a piece, you die. I think there's kind of a question of, is it sustainable to kind of always have this repeated tortoise in the heritage type of thing, or is it inevitable? Is there, like, no other alternative?
00:27:44.150 - 00:27:57.140, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the crypto industry is generally a fan of just like, we have way too much regulation, let's reduce regulation by, like, 90% and go from there. Would you be in that camp as well?
00:27:58.170 - 00:29:05.450, Speaker A: I don't know about, like, 90%. I think it needs to be metered I think the beauty of the US, right, is like, we built this union founded on this notion of a very clear separation of local versus national rights. And you could have the separation of local versus national in the same way you're supposed to have separation of church and state. I just think in a world where Internet commerce is larger than real life commerce, perhaps then the state versus national thing doesn't really matter anymore. And so then you kind of end up needing a different legal structure. Otherwise you're going to kind of always run to this tension. And a very stupid example of this, but one that's interesting is that if you go to, say, Mexico, Argentina, the delivery apps there can deliver you any type of alcohol, basically any time of day in the US.
00:29:05.450 - 00:29:50.778, Speaker A: However, because certain states want to charge a liquor tax on stuff produced in that state, they don't allow delivery outside that state. And there's this very complicated set of rules of when you're allowed to deliver alcohol. And if you cross a state border, you have to pay taxes on both sides, and it just becomes kind of a huge mess, right? And all that you wanted was just like, hey, guy in Florida making some small batch whiskey. I'm in New York. Why the fuck can I just order that online? And I was just like, New York and Florida just agree to split the tax evenly? Well, that doesn't happen, right. And so then you have these turf wars between states, and then eventually that fragments the apps. Right.
00:29:50.778 - 00:30:40.486, Speaker A: Now, the liquor app has to be kind of separate from the Uber eats doordash thing. So I think the maybe 10,000 foot view of this is actually, there's this challenge when you have so much commerce done on the Internet, there's this challenge of reconciling that with these state and national laws, let alone international. International is even more complicated. Let's just start with state and national. Those things are even hard to reconcile. So I think the question is, do we end up with a different governance structure which then would. Yes, it would change 90% of regulation, but it's unclear if it would remove all of it, or if it would just reshape it, or if there would be some sort of treaty.
00:30:40.486 - 00:31:41.180, Speaker A: Because in the articles and constitution, we have this interstate commerce clause. The interstate Commerce clause is very interesting because that's the thing that ensures that one state can't ban you from going to another state and selling stuff or basically doing any type of business. And a very interesting anecdote about this is that in Australia, the western part of Australia, basically until last month, from 2020 to last month completely shut its borders to any other Australia. Like in the US. You can't do that. You can't just have one state say, fuck you, you can't come in here. There's kind of this thing that at the time that the US was founded, this interstate commerce thing was kind of a groundbreaking sort of form of governance in that it allowed commerce to be free.
00:31:41.180 - 00:31:53.714, Speaker A: And sort of the Internet sort of also does that. But somehow we have to reconcile that with our current legal system. And that's going to be the tension, I think, of the next, like, 20.
00:31:53.752 - 00:32:23.050, Speaker B: Years in the US is the story of that. Just that we as humans are coming together as a global society faster than our regulations are. As in, like, we're all on the Internet, we're all having commerce with each other. The regulations still think that we're in a no, not less bits, more Adams type of environment, and it just hasn't caught up with this globalized society that we're creating on the Internet.
00:32:23.710 - 00:33:18.220, Speaker A: Yeah, basically. Which is why I think crypto is one of the more interesting things, because it's like, if we zoom out enough, you could argue that the entire goal of crypto is just to make organizations that can do commerce with each other on the Internet. And those organizations can be as loosely defined as a club or as strictly defined as a nation state that has capital flows. Like a DeFi protocol is more in that side. And then these other types of more loose dows are a little more like clubs. But the idea that the Internet lets you kind of have the same substrate for all different types of organizations versus in real life, you can't have that. You have some defined locality of what types of structures you can create.
00:33:18.220 - 00:34:01.526, Speaker A: Kind of makes reconciling those two things quite difficult. I don't know if I would say it's going to be like a revolution, like a war. But I do think there's going to have to be some sort of generic reform of how law in the real world interacts with law in the digital world. And we're still living in the surf days of Europe, like 1514, hundreds, something like that. We haven't figured out how to reconcile those. We didn't have the French Revolution. We didn't have the british empire growth and crash.
00:34:01.526 - 00:34:27.940, Speaker A: There's still a lot of stuff in the institution building phase that we're still waiting for. And so the question is, what is the catalyst for that? Right. The pandemic was one catalyst for people to realize, oh, shit, you can basically build institutions online, whether it was crypto or whether it's not crypto, because people were forced to run their institutions online, and then they realized, oh, you can do that.
00:34:28.390 - 00:35:01.526, Speaker B: There was a planet money podcast I listened to about the pandemic, and it was about all these regulations that maybe they were just, like, in the back of people's minds. No one were paying attention to them. Pre pandemic. But once the pandemic hit, all these regulations got in the way of stuff. One of the regulations was cross state nurses, as in, nurses couldn't go and do nursing in a different state. And probably kind of some of the similar regulations that you kind of listed off with commerce and alcohol is just like, licenses didn't work cross state. You would probably need to get a different license.
00:35:01.526 - 00:35:53.354, Speaker B: But then that held so much of just like, healthcare back in times where we needed it the most. And so the pandemic kind of just took the regulatory cage and rattled it, and some stuff fell out, and we were like, all right, let's get rid of that regulation. That's, like, holding us back, but I don't think that's nearly enough. You just listed off, like, the French Revolution or the fall of the British Empire. I think we have so much, like, instead of technical debt, we have regulatory debt, as in we have regulations that I think perhaps the paradigm of these regulations probably started post World War II, like, just in the rebuilding of western liberal democracies, post World War II. And the culture of regulation probably got started right around there. But now we have this brand new regulatory paradigm with the Internet and now also with crypto.
00:35:53.354 - 00:36:33.046, Speaker B: And so what you're kind of alluding to is that we need this great reshuffling, reorganization, reregulation, rewriting of the rules. And this kind of reminds me of a lot of what Ray Dalio is talking about and also what people are talking about with the whole fourth turning, where we're going from one paradigm to another, where there seems to be, the world seems to be ready for something new, and we don't know what. And I think perhaps regulation or the regulatory debt that we have is part of that story as, like, we're trying to find new social structures, we're trying to find new systems of engaging with each other, but things are holding us back, and it's making us, as a global society, frustrated.
00:36:33.238 - 00:37:58.074, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think one thing to kind of remember is that in history, the length scale of organization was quite limited by a, geography, b, resources, c, technology, and d, sort of, like, rate of population growth, which you could argue is metered by resources. But some version of that, we have these organizations into cities, agoras, nation states, and then nation states sort of congealed into stateish things, and then we fractured the states. Once the state grew big enough, we had to break it again. And there's sort of this aggregation and disaggregation thing that we've had to do as we built institutions and collectivism in human society. And somehow the Internet makes it so that there's not, like, a clear length scale, there's not a clear size, a notion of a distance that is the right sort of organizational length scale. But it's very clear that the ones we use in the real world of, like, state and nation and maybe city are not really good for the Internet.
00:37:58.074 - 00:38:12.426, Speaker A: They just don't work right. It's the wrong metric, the wrong distance function. And I think once people decide whatever that is, that will determine what this new structure looks like. Does that make sense?
00:38:12.528 - 00:39:23.040, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. But also I think there's room to say that perhaps we can't find that new frame of reference, that new meter stick, between physical nation states and digital societies. Some things about the nation state really only operate on the scales of atoms and not bits. The true aligned governance in the digital age, especially in the crypto age, I think, probably is nonsensical to ask that to come from a nation state, because the nation state is really only good at governing over the physical world, not the digital world. And so all the regulations that you talked about, about, hey, when I'm on the Internet in New York, why can't I buy that whiskey that's in Florida? Well, that's a physical product that's going across physical supply chains, and it has less to do with. And this is why I think there's inevitably going to be, like, a coming. We're going to come to a head with crypto regulation and nation state regulation, just because so many things are gray areas in crypto that the nation state, I don't think, will ever really have a clear answer towards.
00:39:23.730 - 00:40:08.954, Speaker A: Yeah, and I guess it gets back to this question of, should a nation state really be able to regulate these entities? What type of aggregation of people is the right one to regulate these things? It's not clear. It's actually nations or states. Right. It could be a larger thing. Maybe nations want to regulate it, of course. But I don't think it's very clear what level of this many people agreeing is the correct authority. And I think that, yeah, to your point, that's where we're going to get in trouble.
00:40:08.954 - 00:41:14.110, Speaker A: And I think all of the supply chain shit we saw during the pandemic, and we still are seeing, right, the US is still living in this crazy supply chain world. I don't know if a lot of people have paid attention to this, but the US is shipping infrastructure. Like, physical infrastructure is really bad. There was a story of this guy, this startup founder guy, who I guess works in this logistics infrastructure space, and he was like, there's this law, I guess, in Long Beach, California, that you can't stack shipping containers more than like three shipping containers up or something. And this led to basically lines of trucks just, like, acting as storage for shipping containers on the street, in parking lots. And basically there were too many containers coming in and you couldn't find them. And it's completely manual.
00:41:14.110 - 00:41:52.654, Speaker A: There's not like, these things were tagged, and you could be like, oh, there's a GPS location for where this container that contains x, y, or z. Good. Is completely not robotic, not automated, no tagging. And he just wrote this viral tweet. And then after that, apparently, I guess, the county official changed the law for this thing, and basically this two months backlog suddenly was able to get cleared pretty quickly and compare this to places like, I think the most, as far as I know. I'm not, like, an expert in this. So this is just whatever little I've read on this.
00:41:52.654 - 00:43:07.990, Speaker A: Rotterdam, in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, sorry, has this fully robotic, automated tag shipping container thing. It's like, processes. The US receives hundreds of times the number of shipping containers, but Rotterdam could basically process more than what the US does with one 10th the number of people who are working on it. And so there's this interesting thing on the supply chain side, too, of like, hey, we've kind of been completely leapfrogged by a bunch of places. And I think now, the last six months, you've seen a ton of investment and acknowledgment of this as one of the bigger problems. But this gets back to this question of, like, why did this guy's tweet suddenly get the law changed overnight? Right? The fact that it took that is already like a weird kind of thing that shows you that the Internet has changed our perception of local regulations. In a way that means that the definition of a state as this regulating entity might be sort of boomer in like, ten years.
00:43:08.140 - 00:43:55.062, Speaker B: Well, the state is always, like, a lagging thing, right? Like, legislation is slow, governance is slow, passing laws is slow. But I think especially with the technologies that we have these days, and also triggered by Covid, because Covid just made us feel like much more of a global society. It's like, oh, when all of Italy gets the COVID it comes for us, like two months later. All of a sudden we start to pay attention to what's going on around the world a lot more just because that data means more to us now, especially during a pandemic. But then we're just getting better at taking a look around the world and saying, like, well, what they're doing over there is working out real well and we have some problems back home. And so I think maybe perhaps it just like, especially with societies is moving so incredibly fast. Like, technology makes time speed up.
00:43:55.062 - 00:44:29.140, Speaker B: Like, we innovate faster, we can produce things faster. And our governance systems are going at the same pace that they were, if not slowing down. And so the juxtaposition or the dichotomy behind things that are working and things that aren't working, I think people have a lot less tolerance for these things nowadays. And things like Twitter allow us to actually discover the working things versus the broken. Maybe, maybe it's just like, actually Twitter was really the upgrade here rather than our governance didn't get any better, but our dissemination of information got better.
00:44:29.510 - 00:45:09.262, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I definitely think there's certainly a sense in which dissemination of information is important to this. Although there's this other problem of, obviously, I guess this is like a topic du jour of what is information and misinformation can of worms. I don't even know if we want to approach that. But there's a question to me of, like, how is it possible that the people regulating this thing didn't know that there was this problem? They needed this external feedback loop to pass this information back?
00:45:09.396 - 00:45:13.874, Speaker B: Well, they needed the kick in the butt because they were the hair resting on their laurels, right?
00:45:14.072 - 00:45:32.440, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good way of thinking about it. There's kind of just something wrong, though. If your legal system needs this other system to kick it into doing anything right, at some point it has to change very dramatically. Right.
00:45:33.530 - 00:45:46.410, Speaker B: Do you think that we're ever going to be able to update our governance structures, like talking about american democracy here in a way that can actually keep up with the rate of innovation in society?
00:45:48.830 - 00:45:55.360, Speaker A: Has any government structure in history ever been able to keep up with innovation? Start with that question.
00:45:55.970 - 00:46:13.810, Speaker B: Probably the answer is no, but it just basically needs to not fall off the end of the treadmill. It doesn't have to keep up with the head of the chain, but it needs to keep up with it before it falls off. It just needs to be able to go fast enough. And I think people are saying, like, hey, it's not fast enough right now. You got to go faster.
00:46:14.890 - 00:47:38.862, Speaker A: Yeah. The physics analogy I like to make is there's the second law of thermodynamics, which kind of says in sort of these open systems, open physical system, which entropy is sort of always increasing, there's this tendency to hire chaos always. And there's just inevitably going to be that when you have sort of like innovation in the society or even just unrest in a society. And the question for government is not, hey, can we actually live forever? Even though obviously that's like, when you're writing the rules and structuring things, you're supposed to be thinking of it like that. But the question is, how long can we live before the entropy of the universe destroys? Right? And the question is, there's this trade off between being really fast and reactive to changes and being very slow and methodical and making few changes. Right? And governments are always moving on that dial to try to measure the amount of chaos and then decide based on that where they are with that. And I think the problem is that the longer your governance structure exists just naturally, just like humans themselves.
00:47:38.862 - 00:48:07.720, Speaker A: Even macro structures built of humans seem to have this thing of, like, they get more conservative as they get older. And we've yet to see a human structure that is like a blockchain in that it consistently replaces its leader without lots of strife. I guess the US is the best example, but it's not clear that it's going to just be able to continue that way without sort of.
00:48:08.170 - 00:48:14.170, Speaker B: Can you unpack what you meant by that? How does a blockchain consistently replace its leader? We're talking about appending blocks of the chain.
00:48:14.830 - 00:49:32.500, Speaker A: I just mean, like, on every block, at least for sort of like leader based blockchains, you're sampling some distribution, whether it's the stake distribution, whether it's like the hash power distribution, and you pick a new person at random for that block. And yes, it's random dependent on the resources they're providing. But you trust the randomness. That's the crypto part of this thing. And so I guess it's like, do we trust the randomness, the process that's generating either the new laws or the new sort of, like, structure? Or is it actually, like, eventually just tightens up and you don't, you know, we can't. It becomes too much of a structure to kind of fix, and one you have to kind of blow up. And that's sort of where I just feel like the current system of state and federal laws somehow has to adapt to the fact that for some matters, you might actually only care about federal law.
00:49:32.500 - 00:50:00.814, Speaker A: For other matters, you might say, like, hey, me and my neighboring states, we all need to have the same law. And for some matters, you might just say, oh, this only applies to this city. Right. It can move between those scales. And dows basically do that. Right? They have different scales of dows in terms of how much power or treasury or whatever they have, and coordination between them kind of lets them say, hey, we're actually just only going to do this for the city. Oh, we're going to do this for this group of things.
00:50:00.814 - 00:50:24.162, Speaker A: We're going to do this for this bigger group of things. And I think eventually physical nature will have to be able to adapt to the Internet by allowing all different scales of organization, if that makes sense. And that sounds like a revolution. That doesn't sound like, hey, we're going to just tweak state laws until we look like that, if that makes sense.
00:50:24.296 - 00:51:18.338, Speaker B: Yeah. So just to make sure I'm up to speed with where your head's at, state laws and federal laws have a friction behind them, because if you pass a state law, then there's like regulatory overhead. Maybe it worked for doing the thing that it meant to do, but it also caused a bunch of collateral damage with other, and also in the future, you don't know about. And so making the laws precise to where it wants to go is difficult in the physical nation state environment. But then you're saying with dows, with uniswap raises or lowers its fees, like 50 bips or whatever, that's a big change because so much of DFI relates to Uniswap, but it's also contained to Uniswap at the same time. Same thing with the maker dow stability fee. But then you have much more smaller dows, like, I don't know, friends with benefits, and they change like a bylaws, and it's only self contained to friends with benefits.
00:51:18.338 - 00:51:30.150, Speaker B: Are you saying that dao governance structures just are inherently more surgical and therefore much more aligned with what is being governed over? Is that kind of what you're saying?
00:51:30.220 - 00:52:18.200, Speaker A: Yeah, sort of. Imagine if, let's say we have a liquor law, but people in aggregate vote on its jurisdiction. Okay, are we going to make the liquor law only apply to the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, or are we going to make it sort of apply to the whole country? We're going to make it apply to one city. And imagine if there was sort of a market mechanism for determining the scale at which a law gets applied. Dows kind of do that to some extent, and that's a very different version of the law we have now where it's like, to create a new law, you have to pick a sort of jurisdiction in which it is enforced. Right. Like, I pick it for the municipal government or I pick it for the federal government.
00:52:18.200 - 00:52:50.978, Speaker A: It doesn't naturally move between those. Maybe a law needs to be able to scale with its users. Like a law only impacts ten people at the beginning, but all of a sudden it impacts 10,000 people now its jurisdiction needs to also change. I think dows actually allow you to have that scale up and scale down. And whereas laws in the world right now do not do that, right. You pick the jurisdiction size boundaries first, and then you say, hey, it's going to hold here.
00:52:51.064 - 00:52:54.946, Speaker B: Can you illustrate the scaling up and scaling down of a law with a dow just to make it super?
00:52:55.128 - 00:53:51.480, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So let's suppose that uniswap and Uniswap raises their fee, and then in response, curve raises their fee, and there's this natural market mechanism of people trading between them, which changes the volume and liquidity structure. And then at some point, people say, like, oh, we want to vote on actually curve always following Uniswap's fee. And now you've kind of merged the two laws, right? Even though they're technically their own sovereign protocols, they can choose, like, the users of one can choose to just follow the other one's law, right? And they vote on it once and it goes into action. That's very not true in normal life. Right? Like, if Pennsylvania makes a law, it's not like New Jersey is like, yeah, we're going to follow the law, right? Like, no, instead, you have to go to, you know what.
00:53:55.210 - 00:54:08.890, Speaker B: Like a, it's like a bottom up federal law system where if curve agrees to follows Uniswap, and then, I don't know, Sushiswap agrees to follow curve, which is then following uniswap, there turns in.
00:54:09.040 - 00:54:11.406, Speaker A: Now, you scaled it up, right, from.
00:54:11.428 - 00:54:32.482, Speaker B: Like, pseudo universal fee that's determined for all of Defi, and that's like the federal government's law, because everyone in the Defi ecosystem is using the same source for the fee structure, but that source is uniswap instead of a globally mandated law, right, exactly.
00:54:32.616 - 00:54:47.878, Speaker A: There's some sense in which you can have market effects, determine how widely applicable the law will become. Right. That's very different than state laws, right? State laws don't have this competition between them in some sense.
00:54:47.964 - 00:55:06.750, Speaker B: So the power here is of course smart contracts where curve can just build this into a smart contract. Just as me call, call the uniswap fee number, tell me what it is. And so this is akin to California pinging Washington and being like, all right, tell me what the liquor law is there. But they don't have that ability because they're not on smart contracts.
00:55:08.050 - 00:55:31.960, Speaker A: And yeah, sure they can find it, but it's not like they can copy it. They can't just write a piece of law that says, hey, we're going to copy Washington and update it every day. It's not going to work. They won't view that as sovereign, right? They're like, our law can't be superseded by theirs. It can only be superseded by federal law, which covers everyone. But what if California and Washington just want to have a little alliance? They want to have a little.
00:55:34.650 - 00:56:01.760, Speaker B: Like if you scale this out to all the, imagine, imagine the states were some sort of crypto economic network of dows and organizations or whatever. Is the idea that we can actually outsource the role of the federal government? Just like this mesh network of interstate agreements about every different relevant laws. Like, all right, guys, what are we going to do for the driving age and what are we going to do for the drinking age and what are we going to do for whatever this law is?
00:56:02.710 - 00:57:08.162, Speaker A: You could imagine there's like federations, right? Where there's like the Northeast Federation says the max speed limit is 70 miles an hour. But Texas, Illinois and Washington state decide to make their own federation say, fuck you, we're going to make the speed limit 100 miles an hour. And I feel like this idea of being able to group together units and break them apart, this bundling and unbundling of laws that you can agree to or break apart from that does not happen. You can do it in normal society, but it's not built to do it. So the system takes forever if you ever want to do something like that. And during the pandemic, we saw that right where states tried to join together to buy masks because they then had better purchasing power, but then they couldn't agree and they couldn't get one state would apply instantly because they had enough of a budget allocated and another state would be like, no, we have to go through our procedure processes. Oh wait, everyone has to come in person.
00:57:08.162 - 00:57:12.134, Speaker A: Oh shit, we can't do that. We have to rewrite the law. You know what I mean?
00:57:12.172 - 00:57:14.200, Speaker B: You have to rewrite the law, to rewrite the law.
00:57:14.650 - 00:57:41.290, Speaker A: And the recursion on this type of stuff makes it such that people don't do it. Whereas recursion in the smart contract is easy, or gluing together these things is easy. And so there's a sense in which the laws can now scale to what the correct user base. And to me, that's the cool thing that the Internet lets you do that normal law doesn't. You have to kind of choose these boundaries beforehand.

When you shop for plane tickets, you probably use kayak, Expedia or Google to compare ticket prices. So why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto? When you make your trades, you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade, and that's why you should be using matcha. Matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in Ethereum and is also operational on polygon, avalanche, binance, smart chain and other chains.
00:58:56.402 - 00:59:46.130, Speaker C: Trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders so you can set and forget your defi trades and they will go through automatically while you're away. So when you're making a trade, head over to matcha XYZ slash bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets, bankless is proud to be sponsored by Uniswap Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price.

Thank you, Uniswap, for sponsoring bankless.
01:00:02.370 - 01:00:38.450, Speaker B: One of the big critiques of government, mainly from libertarians, but mainly, I hear it from the bitcoiners, is that the nation states never get smaller. They only get larger. And I think a different way to state that is kind of what we just said or alluded to, is that laws only get added. They only get appended rather than erased. And that adds on regulatory complexity. And so if we discover a problem, what we do is we write a law to fix that, and then we discover a new problem. So we write a new law, and it's like this patchwork of laws layered on laws layered on laws, and that adds friction.
01:00:38.450 - 01:00:47.866, Speaker B: But what you're saying is that the routing or navigating of all those different patchwork mesh network of laws becomes trivial if it's a smart contract, because you could just have the code, you can.
01:00:47.888 - 01:01:29.254, Speaker A: Also just fork if you say, fuck you, I don't want to be part of this, right. You can't fork the liquidity and whatever. Sure. But my point is, if you really, really are like, I hate this thing, you do have this exit criteria. And so I'm not saying that the real law will copy this type of behavior, right? It is hard to do in the physical world, right, just by the nature of it. But I do think there will be some lessons that have to come go backwards from what we learned from Internet institutions that go back to real life institutions. And we don't know what that looks like right now, but I think that's something that the next 20 plus years will see.
01:01:29.254 - 01:01:35.818, Speaker A: I think the question is, do we exit surf dumb in our lifetimes or.
01:01:35.824 - 01:02:10.680, Speaker B: Not going back to our metaphor of just like the United States resting on its laurels and then innovation happening elsewhere and then copycatting that. Do you see a world where we actually figure out how to do some sort of real world governance on ethereum and then kind of using the structure of smart contract based laws? Or just like if this, then that statements for laws in like ten years, the United States is like, oh, that's working out really well for them in the Internet world. Can we apply this to our world? And we actually have governance innovation at the federal level.
01:02:12.730 - 01:02:23.354, Speaker A: I guess effectively this would work if you were like, hey, Congress is the oracle that guarantees the data input from the real world. Is correct.
01:02:23.472 - 01:02:35.680, Speaker B: Well, isn't Congress just an oracle of the desires of the people? Isn't that what they do? It's just like supposed to be. Supposed to be, yes. Design, yeah. Philosophy, supposed to be, yeah.
01:02:37.730 - 01:03:36.354, Speaker A: Unclear if it's realizable. I think this is why Defi is, to me, the place I find the most interesting, that it's very precise. Like, the things DeFi dows do are extremely precise things. And like I said, in the US, financial law dominates overall. And so if you can show that this thing can do better than existing financial law, but with way less resources, then you can now start to say, know, hey, maybe you should start thinking about replacing. And I think that's why to me, DeFi is actually the pill towards this direction more so than nfts right now, because it is way closer to this real world law thing. And I'm not saying I don't see liquor laws somehow being done this way.
01:03:36.392 - 01:03:37.934, Speaker B: With liquor laws on the blockchain.
01:03:38.062 - 01:04:26.622, Speaker A: I mean, I'm sure there's some shitty ico that, but I do see financial law going this way. I really do see it could very well kind of move in this model. And then financial law, for a lot of financial stuff is federal, of course, insurance and stuff is not. But for broadly speaking, we could argue it's mainly, mainly federal. And so I just think it will kind of be the first test and DeFi isn't good enough yet for that to happen, but I think it will be the place where we get to this point of like, oh, this shit's working a lot better and uses less resources to.
01:04:26.756 - 01:05:02.854, Speaker B: Right, right. I want to dive into the whole financial laws get enforced the most thing because you brought that up and again. And I want to dive into that because I think if you zoom out and view the nation state holistically, that actually makes a ton of sense, because all nation states are. Are these meta organisms of resource capture and management. Right. Like, what nation state can capture and utilize its resources better than a nation state. And Ray Dalio had this really good line in his book where social structures like cities, cities have laws that we all follow, and cities have to follow the state laws, and the state laws have to follow the federal laws.
01:05:02.854 - 01:05:22.194, Speaker B: But then at the nation state level, once you get to the nation state level, there is no bigger structure than that. And so at the nation state level, it's the law of the jungle, because we don't have any sort of meta organization behind all these different nation states like we have the UN, but it's more of an agreement between nation states.
01:05:22.392 - 01:05:27.266, Speaker A: Come on. The UN Security Council couldn't even do anything for.
01:05:27.448 - 01:05:27.986, Speaker B: Right.
01:05:28.088 - 01:05:30.374, Speaker A: It's kind of a bit of a joke in some ways, right.
01:05:30.412 - 01:06:19.000, Speaker B: And so as soon as you get beyond, at the nation state level, there is no higher order of organization that forces the lower orders to adhere. And so at the nation state level, it's just the law of the jungle. And that means resource capture and resource management. And so that's why taxes are such a big deal. And that's why we're watching capital controls happen in Russia right now, because capital is leaving the country or attempting to. And that's the number one thing that a nation state is concerned with, which is, is this is in my mind when you tell me that financial laws are the things that get enforced the most. To me, that's the nation state doing its damnedest to make sure that the resources that are inside of its borders are properly managed and counted for and taxed by the nation state.
01:06:19.000 - 01:06:21.090, Speaker B: Is that a fair assessment?
01:06:21.250 - 01:07:13.030, Speaker A: I think it's also, to some extent, again, a form of this thing I was just saying of, like, they're very precise decisions, relatively speaking. Like, you didn't pay your taxes by this amount and this time. Right. Whereas a murder trial is very different because there's so many ways in which a murder trial where, say, 90% of people polled say, like, the person did it can still end up having them not be found guilty. And so I think there is a sense, though, in which the nation state, for enforcing these kind of more complex matters, it can only expend a certain amount of resource. Like, the resources there are, like, the time it takes. Time is a resource.
01:07:13.030 - 01:08:08.620, Speaker A: The judges doing the whole jury process, it is a laborious task, and there's only so many you can do, right? Whereas with financial cases, they're so much more precise that they're almost automatable. And my argument is, in Defi, you're basically removing all the lawyers and automating as much of that as possible. So you actually might get to the point where it's more efficient for the nation state to just use something that looks more like DeFi as a way of enforcing. Know, obviously, that's what these CBDC type of things want to do. It remains to be seen if anyone smart ever wants to work on them. To me, that's like, the bigger problem is no one super bright really is like, yeah, I want to work on us CBDC or work at visa. And on one of these things.
01:08:08.620 - 01:09:00.722, Speaker A: The talent differences between cryptocurrencies and visa or the chinese digital remindi is huge, right? You don't see really smart people going into doing that. And that should tell you something about how feasible it is for a government to do it. And so if it turns out that it just grows so big on its own, it might just become easier to just adopt DeFi as the law for that. Right. And I'm sure small nations will be first to do that because they get free currency stability, possibly. And so that's why I'm much more bullish on DeFi being the kind of way of the real world kind of real laws kind of being restructured.
01:09:00.866 - 01:09:54.730, Speaker B: Right. Okay, so the argument is that all these financial laws, financial laws, when they go to court, are just so incredibly objective, because it's just like, all right, what are the numbers involved with what of the parties? And did the numbers get transferred in the most appropriate ways? And so this is all almost like math based, almost like trust in math, which is like part of the crypto ethos. And so what you're saying is that porting over this legal structure onto Defi allows us to just reason about these things better, and also with the aid of smart contracts to make sure that we never actually have to go to court in the first place. It's just like, all automated on DeFi. And so you're saying that the gap between managing interstate commerce laws versus interstate finance and tax laws is much smaller to actually put that on DeFi versus how do we manage alcohol licenses on the blockchain.
01:09:55.790 - 01:09:56.442, Speaker A: Exactly.
01:09:56.576 - 01:09:57.258, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:09:57.424 - 01:10:15.742, Speaker A: And it becomes easier to. Right. Like, it just becomes easier to be, like, in the same way I was like, oh, curve just adopted Uniswap's fee. A nation state can adopt an amm's price as an oracle for an off chain contract. Right. It can go the other way. Right.
01:10:15.742 - 01:10:35.558, Speaker A: We've spent all this time using oracles to pump in prices, but if it becomes the most liquid venue in the world, then you can also go the other way. And that's the equivalent of a nation state taking the rules of Defi are now our law. Right? That's a very simple case. Maybe not like a crazy case, but it's still like an example.
01:10:35.724 - 01:10:48.620, Speaker B: And the case for that would be like in some sort of courtroom, they're like, all right, well, the uniswap price for this token at this time was this amount. Therefore you owe this much in taxes, or the settlement is determined like this, or something like that.
01:10:49.070 - 01:11:41.370, Speaker A: Yeah. Or a more nationalistic version. Suppose that there's some nation whose currency is majority issued in a stable coin, and instead of making a digital dollar, they just act like circle or tether and they just make an ERC 20. That is, I don't know, the Marshall Islands dollar. I'm making up a currency and they just issue their stable coin on there. And then there's a uniswap pool of USDC versus the Marshall island dollar and anything that the government needs to ever get the exchange rate for. And governments have tons of stuff where they need exchange rates and contracts in law to enforce a law comes from usewap.
01:11:41.370 - 01:12:25.610, Speaker A: That's another case where you're basically adopting the laws of Defi in some ways there. And I think there was a lot of time in crypto, I think especially in the bear market was spent on like, I don't know, I remember ripple tried to get itself adopted as the currency of some random country or whatever, right? None of that shit worked, regardless of how much money people were giving these random countries. A more powerful version is the opposite, right, of like, the thing that already has a ton of liquidity, also has the sovereign coin, and now they're accepting the laws of defi, right. And that seems kind of not impossible.
01:12:28.030 - 01:12:33.360, Speaker B: Do you believe in code? Is law like straight up lex cryptographia or whatever it's called?
01:12:34.210 - 01:12:37.950, Speaker A: Not really, but more because it's so easy to write bugs.
01:12:39.730 - 01:12:45.250, Speaker B: Okay. Do you believe in the philosophy? As in smart contract laws supersede nation state laws?
01:12:46.310 - 01:13:20.934, Speaker A: You still have to care about the users, right. A lot of these smart contracts only work under some conditions of, like, there are certain types of users who are providing liquidity trading, doing whatever, right? At least for Defi again, and it depends on the users plus the contracts. And I think it is locked. Code is locked conditional on some assumptions being met. And then without those assumptions being met, you can't say that it's a causal statement.
01:13:21.062 - 01:13:22.960, Speaker B: What's an assumption that needs to be met?
01:13:23.970 - 01:13:38.962, Speaker A: I'll give you a simple example. Uniswap to be a good oracle needs a ton of liquidity, and the cost of manipulating the price is sort of like above proportional to sort of a function of the liquidity in there.
01:13:39.096 - 01:13:39.442, Speaker B: Okay.
01:13:39.496 - 01:13:55.782, Speaker A: And if I'm going to use it, if the code is like law in that some government's using that uniswap pool to figure out how much to pay to some other country, there should be some condition under which that's true.
01:13:55.836 - 01:13:56.054, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:13:56.092 - 01:13:56.630, Speaker A: Right.
01:13:56.780 - 01:14:11.180, Speaker B: Code is law when we're ready for it as a. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Troon, when you wake up in the morning, what does your brain go towards? What do you focus on naturally? What's downhill for you?
01:14:12.750 - 01:14:20.590, Speaker A: Where is mean? You want the honest answer first thing.
01:14:20.660 - 01:14:23.440, Speaker B: Okay. When you're caffeinated, what do you start to think about?
01:14:24.450 - 01:15:17.122, Speaker A: Um, I don't know. I feel like most of it is just like reading the news and seeing what happened overnight. I mean, the thing about crypto, right, is like, there's so many times I've woken up and there's just been like, some crazy ass surprise or like, some crazy thing happened overnight in Asia and I don't know. Yeah, the world's gone crazy. I'm actually a late night type of person, so actually in the morning, I'm kind of bleary and no good ideas. No good ideas come in the morning. It's actually usually like, I just take a long time of reading things before I can finally start thinking about stuff.
01:15:17.122 - 01:16:15.090, Speaker A: And then usually it's trying to understand what things in crypto are actually working by usage, not by hype or things like that. And then trying to see if there is. My research process for coming up papers to write is really trying to understand if there's something that's working. In spite of the fact that the developers had no clue why it should work. They just wrote the thing, kind of hoped it worked, and they duct tape and baling wire, put it together, and it's like 90% of the time this thing should fail, but for some reason, it's able to survive and not get exploited and not get. People are not like, I spent a lot of time thinking about that and trying to analyze the space of these things because I think that's how you find what the new primitives are, at least in Defi.
01:16:16.470 - 01:16:27.974, Speaker B: And we saw this with the Internet, and it's also true with Defi is like, so much of it is emergent. When we started with the Internet, we just were making newspaper websites instead of what we know of today as geocities. Right?
01:16:28.172 - 01:17:02.420, Speaker A: What's that maybe that's dating me. Geocities used to be this, like, it was the first website that was like, build your own website for free. And it got bought by Yahoo, but it was like squarespace, but really shitty. It was most famous for inventing the following feature, which was the page counter, which at the bottom of the page would show you the number of visitors this page had.
01:17:02.950 - 01:17:40.286, Speaker B: Okay, so a lot of the early Internet stuff that actually never ended up manifesting into what the Internet is we know of today. And I think now that we have that primitive, we kind of can apply it to DFI, right? Or at least with Ethereum, too. In 2015, 2016, Ethereum, we had peepith, which was like Twitter on ethereum, as in like, you would write tweets and they would be in transactions on the l one. And this was back when gas was like basically $0.00. But now it's completely ridiculous. But now we understand that there's going to be some sort of emergence with what we build in DFI. We know that the things that DFI will look like in 20 years are probably going to be completely different from what we're building out today.
01:17:40.286 - 01:17:59.720, Speaker B: And what we're building out today are probably schumorphic and backwards and reductive. So when you think about DFI, are you always on the lookout for like, oh, well, is this really going to be what it looks like in 15 years? Or how do you navigate a world that we know? We don't know what it will be like in the future?
01:18:01.450 - 01:19:03.020, Speaker A: With Defi, it's like, I feel like the key is, I prefer saying this, and I say it maybe too much, but DeFI has nothing to do with actually changing much in finance, has everything to do with changing things in law and removing law more than finance. So if you see something work, there has to be some analog that's existed in finance somewhere. It might be an arcane, esoteric thing that doesn't exist anymore or blew up in some weird way, but there probably is an analog for NFT stuff that's above my pay grade. I have no clue how to think that way. And I know there are these people who are geniuses like Andy, who are just always on for that stuff. I can't see that. Whereas here it's more about trying to draw analogies and also to understand kind of like the users really well.
01:19:03.020 - 01:19:37.986, Speaker A: And I think, yeah, for finance, it's just a little bit easier. I just don't think we're going to invent something that's completely new. It's going to be more like something that was very hard and could have existed or did exist somehow was able to be made really easily with smart contracts before it was too complicated, too expensive, and the cost of it somehow went down 10,000 x, and that made it an attractive product. And that's sort of how I feel with a lot of the financial products.
01:19:38.088 - 01:20:04.246, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one of the things I've learned about you the most is almost exactly what you just said, where this isn't finance, this is law that we're working on, like smart contracts is an automation of law, not an automation of finance. But finance itself is inherently law based. You can't have finance without contracts because that's all finance is, money and contracts, basically, and that's how you create finance.
01:20:04.358 - 01:20:10.270, Speaker A: I think a lot of money is a contract. Look at the back of the bill. It has all the philosophy written on.
01:20:10.420 - 01:20:20.900, Speaker B: That's a really good point. Yeah, I never even thought about that. But I think that's something that a lot of listeners, probably people that think about defi think of it as finance and don't really consider the law aspect of it.
01:20:22.150 - 01:20:28.040, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think when you make law cheaper, you change which products are used.
01:20:29.930 - 01:20:31.350, Speaker B: Which products are viable.
01:20:31.850 - 01:20:33.654, Speaker A: Which products are viable. Yeah, exactly.
01:20:33.772 - 01:20:40.540, Speaker B: Yeah. Tarun, when you wake up in the morning, what makes you optimistic other than your cup of coffee that's coming?
01:20:43.950 - 01:21:44.494, Speaker A: You know, obviously, humans seem to be unable to not cause strife for themselves, but I just think there's just so many kind of pretty things in the world that come from very different aesthetic standards. Like, certain types of math are very pretty. Certain types of people's devotion to something is very pretty people. I don't really find his art very interesting. I don't like it. But the fact that the dude did that for so many days in a row and didn't get bored of doing it, you got to respect that there's some joy, beauty to that. So I think it's more about finding, taking all of these kind of things that you see in the world, especially on the Internet, in Internet culture, and trying to be able to find some little nugget of like, hey, I probably hate that thing.
01:21:44.494 - 01:21:57.860, Speaker A: But it's actually kind of, there's always something, a kernel of niceness in a lot of things. And to do that, you have to keep yourself only locked into certain parts of the Internet and away from others.
01:22:00.150 - 01:22:01.300, Speaker B: To do what?
01:22:01.830 - 01:22:13.400, Speaker A: Oh, to always be able to find some nice nugget of fun, like, hey, this is cool, I appreciate it, type of thing. And finding those things every day. That's kind of my.
01:22:14.650 - 01:22:17.960, Speaker B: Why do you have to lock yourself there are those into the Internet to find.
01:22:18.490 - 01:22:31.454, Speaker A: I was just trying to say, I don't read four chan. You know what I mean? There are certain parts of the Internet that there are some things where I'm like, I don't think I'm going to find anything positive here.
01:22:31.652 - 01:22:42.160, Speaker B: Okay. What's an example of piece of math that's pretty? What's the last pretty piece of math that you saw?
01:22:44.070 - 01:23:28.314, Speaker A: I think my favorite proof of all time is one thing I think that's very interesting in math is the more powerful, like a theorem or statement, the more, a, it gets used. But b, the more people try to find different ways to prove the same result. And so the more fundamental and important an object is, the more you find, like, 500 proofs of it. And within those 500, there's many different forms of style and aesthetics. Some are. They're pretty because they use really fancy machinery, and the proof is really small. Some of them are pretty because it's like very first principles.
01:23:28.314 - 01:24:09.050, Speaker A: You don't need to know that much background. And some of them, they're pretty because they are a tour de force. They are able to glue together things that you wouldn't have thought would work together. But I think my favorite proof is the fundamental theorem of algebra, something you kind of learn in high school, which is, like any polynomial has n roots in the complex numbers. It has all its roots. And when you learn it the first time, you always learn this really ugly, super ugly proof. But there's this one proof using leuval's theorem, which is something in complex analysis that is just very clean.
01:24:09.050 - 01:24:33.826, Speaker A: And it's like a proof I have committed to memory. And I think it's kind of like finding a poem you really like. There might be 500 poems that are going to the same sentiment, but sometimes you find one where you're like, this is the one that you just instant commit to memory. And so that's probably it.
01:24:34.008 - 01:25:28.462, Speaker B: The way that I relate to that is, when I'm doing my writing and I'm writing out paragraphs to make a point and going through the revision process, I find a way to take this three paragraph section that's making what I think is, like, a really awesome, very strong point. But it took me three paragraphs to make it. And then in my editing process, I'm able to actually take the third paragraph, cut some stuff out, and then integrate that into the first two paragraphs. And if I'm really on my game, then I can actually find a way to cut that paragraph down into two paragraphs. And the best theorem, if you will, is like, oh, I actually collapsed a whole entire section into these two sentences. And these two sentences actually land so much harder with the listener, with the reader, than this whole entire paragraph. And Ryan always says, when we were trying to onboard writers into bankless, is that you're supposed to write like you tweet.
01:25:28.462 - 01:25:44.730, Speaker B: If you actually constrained for characters, how do you get your point across? And it's the art of writing a whole entire 10,000 word article, but that you get the point across inside of 500 words, and it kind of sounds like the same thing.
01:25:44.880 - 01:26:00.640, Speaker A: It's the same thing, but somehow you need to have written, struggled through the long one to figure out the short one. And that process can sometimes be pretty to see how the simplification happens.
01:26:01.250 - 01:26:05.890, Speaker B: Are you familiar with the concept, a mathematical concept? I'm sure you are actually, with basins.
01:26:07.110 - 01:26:10.834, Speaker A: You mean like basins of attraction system? Yeah.
01:26:11.032 - 01:26:33.720, Speaker B: So is it fair to try and extrapolate this out? As in, the bottom of a basin is, like, the most simple and most reductive proof, or in my world, the most simple. How do you collapse 10,000 words into a single meme? Do you think the attraction basin is, like, the bottom of it is like, the most distilled thing of what we're trying to talk about?
01:26:34.490 - 01:27:03.650, Speaker A: Yeah, I like that analogy. I will say it's not true for all basins, because oftentimes they don't have unique points, like unique minima. They can have many bottoms, but the sentiment is correct for sure. Assuming you have a way of describing a dynamical system, that's like your thought process. Right. But then again, neuroscience is very far from being that precise.
01:27:04.310 - 01:27:52.980, Speaker B: Well, we can also extrapolate this to Defi, right, where maybe there's a desire to swap tokens on Defi. So what do we do? The first thing we do is we build ether delta, and that was a very messy proof of trying to swap. Then, you know, later, we find uniswap, we find x times y equals k, and that seems to be, like, the most reductively simple way of swapping tokens. And I feel like you could probably extrapolate this to almost all domains of knowledge, where you can just find the most simple and most easy way to do something. But then when you extrapolate that, do you get into the conversation of singularity? Like, what is the most bottom, most basin of the universe? And if we all end up there, what happens? Did I just get way too far out there.
01:27:53.350 - 01:27:55.300, Speaker A: I don't know.
01:27:55.750 - 01:27:57.220, Speaker B: I think the answer is yes.
01:28:01.610 - 01:28:20.090, Speaker A: I guess so. I think the interesting thing is I feel like the concept of the singularity seems to have lost popularity. I feel like ten years ago it was like Kurzweil was really hot character, and now instead we have his son making very cringe fake dows.
01:28:20.990 - 01:28:22.220, Speaker B: Wait, is that real?
01:28:22.590 - 01:28:32.798, Speaker A: Bessemer Dow? This venture fund is like claiming they're making a Dow and they're going to invest out of it, but I don't think they understand what the D stands for.
01:28:32.884 - 01:28:33.520, Speaker B: Right.
01:28:34.290 - 01:28:36.260, Speaker A: And his son is running it.
01:28:36.870 - 01:28:43.662, Speaker B: I do think we actually kind of accidentally went down, like the wrong path with naming these things. None of these things are dows.
01:28:43.806 - 01:28:58.220, Speaker A: I mean, pets.com was an era, right? Like no one says bankless.com, right? You have to go through this again. This is like the, we're going through this dynamical process.
01:28:59.790 - 01:29:08.540, Speaker B: All right, Tarun, do you have any rule of thumb that you follow or bit of advice that has been useful for you?
01:29:18.500 - 01:30:09.010, Speaker A: Good question. Probably like, you know, I, a thing I started doing in college and then like kind of have still done is I have this rule of like, never eat a meal alone. And to like that leads you to actually try to find to meet new crazy people. Obviously, the pandemic kind of ruined that rule, but let's ignore that fact. And I think being able to have some very simple, structured goal like that which forces you to go change your social behaviors somehow I feel like is a very good thing.
01:30:11.220 - 01:30:15.890, Speaker B: So if it's dinner time and you don't have somebody to eat a meal with, what do you go do?
01:30:17.220 - 01:30:19.280, Speaker A: Go meet someone random. Go eat at a bar.
01:30:19.350 - 01:30:23.152, Speaker B: Read a bar. No air pods allowed. Sit at a bar.
01:30:23.206 - 01:30:25.188, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
01:30:25.354 - 01:30:28.644, Speaker B: You're talking to a guy that eats most of his meals at a bar.
01:30:28.682 - 01:30:39.850, Speaker A: With AirPods know, in New York, though, I feel like it's very different. There's tons of people who just go and hang out on their own and it's not. Yeah.
01:30:40.460 - 01:30:46.696, Speaker B: All right, bankless nation action items. Go to a random bar and get a meal and talk to a stranger.
