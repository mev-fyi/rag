00:00:00.330 - 00:00:11.950, Speaker A: Merge is scheduled, inflation down. Hopefully that continues. L two tokens are up. Fee tokens are up. Like not only is ETH bullish and proof of stake bullish, but tokens are also bullish.
00:00:14.290 - 00:00:18.590, Speaker B: Bankless nation. Happy second Friday of August. David, what time is it?
00:00:18.660 - 00:00:35.890, Speaker A: Oh, Ryan, it's the Friday bankless weekly roll up time where we cover the entire week of news in crypto, which is always an ambition endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless. Ryan, it was a good news week this week. Well, actually it was very week started on a bad note, ended on a very, very high note.
00:00:35.970 - 00:00:47.786, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And so I missed a lot of the week. So I was over in the UK with my family for vacation and you know how I usually say grab your morning coffee in the UK? David, I discovered that coffee means something different than it does in the US.
00:00:47.888 - 00:00:48.346, Speaker A: What?
00:00:48.448 - 00:01:02.394, Speaker B: At least it was more like when I would ask for a coffee, it'd be like, okay, what type of coffee would you like? And the options are like espresso, cappuccino, macchiato. It's like an array of coffee beverages.
00:01:02.442 - 00:01:03.790, Speaker A: Wait, that feels normal.
00:01:04.310 - 00:01:24.710, Speaker B: Not for me though. Like in the US, if you're like, hey, I want a coffee, then it's okay. Regular coffee, it's not an espresso. Americano? Yeah, Americano was generally the only option. Maybe this was just like where I was in kind of the UK or I don't know. Well, you're from Seattle. That's coffee capital of the US.
00:01:24.710 - 00:01:27.606, Speaker B: Is that what coffee really think?
00:01:27.628 - 00:01:35.270, Speaker A: Well, I think if you go to a coffee store in Seattle and you ask for coffee, then they will continue like, yeah, what kind? They will. Yeah, I think that's normal.
00:01:35.350 - 00:01:45.662, Speaker B: It's probably actually definitionally correct. But here on the east coast, David, you can go into any place in the US and be like, I'll take a coffee. And they won't ask you if you want Americano or black.
00:01:45.716 - 00:01:47.354, Speaker A: Burnt, black drip coffee.
00:01:47.482 - 00:01:51.630, Speaker B: Yeah, burnt. And then they will make it a beverage by putting cream and sugar in it.
00:01:51.700 - 00:01:52.720, Speaker A: Yes, they will.
00:01:53.190 - 00:02:05.460, Speaker B: Anyway, grab your bankless coffee beverage if you will and join us for some topics of the week. Number one, David, the merge, the Ethereum Merge. It has a.
00:02:07.510 - 00:02:13.574, Speaker A: Merge, has a date. We're merging. We're merging. What's the date going to be? Oh, we'll tell you later. We're not going to tell you right now.
00:02:13.612 - 00:02:21.410, Speaker B: Yeah, we're not going to spoil that. Also, there's some big stuff going on with tornado cash that's a bad part of this week. What do they do. What's happening?
00:02:21.500 - 00:02:40.878, Speaker A: Tornado cash, the first ever smart contract on Ethereum, is now illegal. There is now an illegal smart contract for us citizens. So if you are a us citizen, congratulations. There's like 40 or 50 smart contracts associated with tornado cash that is illegal for you to touch. I didn't know that smart contracts could become illegal, Ryan. That's news to me.
00:02:40.964 - 00:02:49.390, Speaker B: Yeah, it doesn't feel like they could do that constitutionally, but we'll get into the arguments there. Last thing is, Coinbase just landed a $10 trillion client.
00:02:49.470 - 00:02:49.762, Speaker A: Wow.
00:02:49.816 - 00:03:15.850, Speaker B: We'll tell you who that is. But of course, you're going to do the roll up with us. And if you like these roll ups, you got to make sure you, like, subscribe, rate and review. So like and subscribe. If you're looking on YouTube, watching this on YouTube, or rate and review in your podcast player. If you're on Spotify, by the way, this comes in video form now, so you can get bankless via video, which is the best way to do a roll up, is to watch a roll up, not just listen to it. But of course, with Spotify now you can do both.
00:03:15.850 - 00:03:17.290, Speaker B: So that's pretty cool.
00:03:17.360 - 00:03:28.494, Speaker A: Ryan, did you know that this last week we received our 2000th five star review? And then this same week, the merch gets a date? No, it's not a coincidence, sir.
00:03:28.612 - 00:03:32.030, Speaker B: It couldn't be. Who is that 2000th of reviewer?
00:03:32.770 - 00:03:33.680, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:03:34.850 - 00:03:54.390, Speaker B: It's probably Vitalik. Thanks, Vitalik. All right, before we get into it, though, we got to talk about, relay a quick message from our sponsor and friends at Forda. There have been so many hacks recently, and last year there were a ton of defi crypto related hacks. But I think Forda helps with that. What are these guys all about? What do they do?
00:03:54.460 - 00:04:32.018, Speaker A: Yeah, Forta does real time mem pool and transaction monitoring. So there might be a transaction that is coming for your TVL. If you built a defi app with TVL in it, there can be ways to exploit that. And so you can set up a list of parameters for Forta to listen to. And if transactions come in that trigger one of these things that you don't want to be triggered, Forda can zap that transaction. It can front run that transaction and save your contract, your NFT, or your governance, whatever. So real time security and operational monitoring for over $36 billion in TVL, things like Makerdao bridges, all the things that we use.
00:04:32.018 - 00:04:43.522, Speaker A: UMA finance, poly network, compound balancer, liquidity, of course there's a link in the show notes to get started. So not only do you need to get your smart contracts audited, but you can have an extra layer of defense with something like Forda.
00:04:43.586 - 00:04:56.330, Speaker B: Yeah. It notifies you in advance. You do not want to find out your smart contract has been hacked for millions of dollars on Twitter. Okay. Forda can notify you of that in advance so you could do something about it. So go check that out. David, let's get to markets, man.
00:04:56.330 - 00:05:00.646, Speaker B: What are the markets saying to us today? Let's talk to big daddy bitcoin.
00:05:00.838 - 00:05:13.182, Speaker A: Markets are happy. Bitcoin's happy. Up a very impressive 8.3%. Started the week at $22,400. Where we are currently is $24,300. So almost up $2,000.
00:05:13.316 - 00:05:21.038, Speaker B: Okay, so we're happy up $2,000 in a bear market that's feeling good. And tell me about ETH. Wow, this chart's looking bullish.
00:05:21.134 - 00:05:41.320, Speaker A: Yeah, that's an 18.7% up in one week for ether. Started the week at just under one, $600. 15,092. And we are currently at 18,090. Yesterday, Ryan, right after the Gore Lee merge, which was a success, we hit 1950. Wow.
00:05:41.690 - 00:06:09.746, Speaker B: The Gorely merge, by the way, is a testnet merge, the last remaining testnet. We're going to talk about that in a little bit. So do you think the market is just responding to the merge news? If so, that makes me bullish, because the market actually responding to fundamentals is a thing that is relatively rare in crypto. At least I found it rare. Maybe that's my cynic point of view. The market just generally responds to stupid things all of the time. Narratives or like fake partnerships or just dumb stuff that happens.
00:06:09.746 - 00:06:20.150, Speaker B: It's rare that you actually have a market event that's affecting fundamentals and the market digests that and immediately responds with upward or downward price movement. What do you think?
00:06:20.220 - 00:06:36.038, Speaker A: Yeah. The thing I've noticed about the market lately is that it's been responding positively to positive news, and it's not been responding negatively to negative news, which is generally indication of what the mind shift, like the mental state of market participants.
00:06:36.134 - 00:06:37.178, Speaker B: That's not a bear market.
00:06:37.264 - 00:06:38.570, Speaker A: That is not a bear market because.
00:06:38.640 - 00:06:56.158, Speaker B: Bear market, even when there's really good news and it can be fundamentally good news, nothing happens or it could continue to drop down. But now we're seeing good news and good things are happening to price, and that's following fairly rapidly after the good news in a timely, orderly way. Smart market now and not a bear market, maybe.
00:06:56.244 - 00:07:03.538, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think you can say $1,900. Ether is a bear market. I don't think that's right to say that. Yeah, I don't think so.
00:07:03.624 - 00:07:27.434, Speaker B: All right. But still, I think most people, if you ask the average crypto investor, they would still say, we're in a bear market. But this is starting to feel a little bit different. I guess we'll see what happens. But, you know, when ETH is doing things relative to bitcoin, we start talking about the flipping again. And let's take a look at the ETH to bitcoin ratio. And I'll go back to that flipping chart to see where we are.
00:07:27.434 - 00:07:29.098, Speaker B: What's the ratio showing this today?
00:07:29.184 - 00:07:48.542, Speaker A: Yeah, the ratio is up 10% in the last week, going from 0705 to zero. Seven. Seven. Actually on screen, it's 7796. But a lot of sevens. And sevens are lucky. I've heard sevens are lucky, which means your boy is back in the green in his ETH BTC trade.
00:07:48.542 - 00:07:56.334, Speaker A: Look at that spike down and then back up. It's like, oh, yeah, if you just erase those months and act like nothing happens. Like, look, we're back in that trendline.
00:07:56.382 - 00:08:03.990, Speaker B: This is great, too. I think we made some bankless purchases around the $1900 range, too. And I was like, david, it's going to drop further.
00:08:05.690 - 00:08:08.614, Speaker A: We got to bullish. The merge is coming. We got to buy it.
00:08:08.732 - 00:08:30.622, Speaker B: We got to buy again. 1900. Let's go back to that opportunity that ETH afforded us two months ago. But anytime the ratio is going this direction, it starts to be a good time to look at the actual flipping metrics. And this is ratiogang.com. We are 50% of the way to the flipping. 48.948.9.
00:08:30.622 - 00:08:38.946, Speaker B: So what is the definition of the flipping, by the way? That is ETH's market cap exceeds bitcoin's market cap. And that has never happened.
00:08:39.048 - 00:08:41.390, Speaker A: Never happened. It came very close in 2017.
00:08:41.470 - 00:08:45.810, Speaker B: There was a prophecy. Right? It was like, in 2017, it got up to, like 70% something.
00:08:45.880 - 00:08:48.130, Speaker A: I think higher than that. I think it was above, like 85%.
00:08:48.200 - 00:08:51.270, Speaker B: Did it? Okay. It was maybe a brief spike.
00:08:52.410 - 00:08:55.030, Speaker A: It was a wick of a candle. Yeah. It did not stay there very long.
00:08:55.100 - 00:09:30.660, Speaker B: All right, so what do you think? There are various events that have been predicted for a possible flipping. I know you are a believer in the eventual flippinning at some point in time. I am also a believer in the flipping at some point in time. The difference, I think, with hardcore Ethereum bulls of which David and myself would call ourselves for sure, is when they think that will happen. One of the catalyzing events people have said could be the actual merge on the back of the Ethereum merge. Maybe the flipping happens somewhere in the next few months, potentially. What do you think?
00:09:31.030 - 00:09:48.438, Speaker A: I think if it happened in 2022, that would be way faster than expected. Although crypto is known for doing things faster than expected, like recovering out of that bear market, allegedly, knock on wood. I think the ods that it happens in 2023 are over 50%.
00:09:48.604 - 00:09:51.240, Speaker B: Wow. In 2023, that's next year.
00:09:52.090 - 00:09:52.850, Speaker A: What do you think?
00:09:52.940 - 00:09:55.980, Speaker B: What are the ods that it happens this year? 2022.
00:09:57.470 - 00:10:00.362, Speaker A: Ten to 10%, 15%.
00:10:00.416 - 00:10:04.654, Speaker B: Seems really high odds that it happens by 2025.
00:10:04.852 - 00:10:44.890, Speaker A: Oh, gosh. Okay, well, see, the time is always in ethereum's favor because of the significant reduction of issuance and the significant ETH burn, which we've talked about on the show an infinite number of times. But it's like Ethereum at that point, in a post merge Ethereum, Ethereum just has to wait it out, and eventually, unless some other blockchain is generating more block space demand than Ethereum, which has never been. No one's gotten anywhere close. Ethereum is just a waiting game in Ethereum's favor to take the number one spot. As we go beyond 2023, the percentage that it becomes the number one asset in the world in crypto approaches 99%.
00:10:44.960 - 00:10:51.766, Speaker B: Are you ignoring the bull catalyst for bitcoin, though, of which there's at least one happening there? So 2024, there's going to be a habit.
00:10:51.798 - 00:11:00.810, Speaker A: Yeah, but it's the same bull cat. The happening and the merge are the same catalysts, and the merge is objectively more powerful by three orders of magnitude.
00:11:00.890 - 00:11:08.660, Speaker B: Not just that central bankers like central banks, maybe El Salvador is. One sailor is going to keep buying. I don't know. There's some other.
00:11:09.910 - 00:11:13.300, Speaker A: Those are not catalysts that bitcoin has a monopoly over, sir.
00:11:14.790 - 00:11:45.118, Speaker B: So I agree. The probability is very high before 2025. I don't know if I'm ready to say, like, 50% in 2023, because one of us has to be the more conservative one, I guess. But by 2025, David, I'm putting this at 90%. Definitely 95%. I'll go conservative, though, and I'll say 90%, and then by the end of this decade, it's 100%, unless we're completely.
00:11:45.204 - 00:11:50.782, Speaker A: Wrong, discounting some weird disaster merge scenario, which I guess you have to do.
00:11:50.916 - 00:11:52.830, Speaker B: David and I will quit crypto.
00:11:56.230 - 00:11:57.826, Speaker A: If we're wrong, we just leave.
00:11:58.008 - 00:12:01.410, Speaker B: Yeah, we just leave. Sorry, guys, we were wrong. Bankless is over.
00:12:01.480 - 00:12:02.580, Speaker A: We're done now.
00:12:03.110 - 00:12:08.562, Speaker B: All right, so we talked about that total crypto market cap, though. That's adding some money, right?
00:12:08.616 - 00:12:18.374, Speaker A: Yeah. Up $100 billion. So last week it was at 1.1 trillion. We are at 1.2 trillion. So $100 billion on the market cap for crypto this week.
00:12:18.412 - 00:12:22.634, Speaker B: That's pretty nice. A lot of billions being added in the week.
00:12:22.832 - 00:12:23.750, Speaker A: Two terrorists.
00:12:23.830 - 00:12:32.842, Speaker B: Here's a thing. Here's a tweak on it. On the eth bull case. Gas prices are down, my friend. Down bad. No, this is right, isn't it?
00:12:32.896 - 00:12:33.162, Speaker A: No.
00:12:33.216 - 00:12:34.858, Speaker B: What's the medium gas price this week?
00:12:34.944 - 00:12:38.606, Speaker A: It's that purple one that you want. Oh, wait, no, it's the green one above that, that you want this one.
00:12:38.628 - 00:12:39.822, Speaker B: Medium gas price for the week.
00:12:39.876 - 00:12:42.960, Speaker A: No, scroll up, scroll up, scroll up. That green one.
00:12:43.270 - 00:12:44.446, Speaker B: Oh, distribution.
00:12:44.558 - 00:12:45.218, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:45.384 - 00:12:48.850, Speaker B: Okay, so what is the transaction? Distribution for gas?
00:12:49.510 - 00:12:52.500, Speaker A: Ten. We're back up to ten. We went from nine to ten.
00:12:53.910 - 00:12:55.806, Speaker B: That's the distribution of the average.
00:12:55.918 - 00:13:00.978, Speaker A: Average gay free for the last seven days is like ten ish gwe.
00:13:01.074 - 00:13:04.354, Speaker B: Okay, so block space demand down for ethereum overall.
00:13:04.402 - 00:13:04.614, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:04.652 - 00:13:08.450, Speaker B: Bear case, right? All right, there's the bear peeking at said, why is it down, David?
00:13:08.610 - 00:13:27.662, Speaker A: Because it's a bear market. Like, people aren't doing their shenanigans. And also we're getting better at scale. Like, simultaneously, things are scaling more. People are on more layer twos and NFT volumes are super low. And so less layer one block space is being consumed. So, yeah, things are just quieter in the smart contract space.
00:13:27.716 - 00:14:11.802, Speaker B: Okay, so let me throw that bear case by you again, right. Because block space is only going to get more efficient on Ethereum, we have roll ups. And then in a post EIP 4844 world of which, by the way, we talk in depth with Polynia, with Polenia. Polenia, excuse me, the pseudo anonymous Persona on Twitter who knows so much about roll ups. That episode is coming out on Monday. There is a world where blockspace becomes very cheap, essentially the data layer on ethereum, and we're not actually burning as much eth as we thought. And I guess maybe getting back to that, what price point for GwE are we actually burning eth? Like, what is kind of the break even burn rate here?
00:14:11.936 - 00:14:38.350, Speaker A: Yeah, so we've been saying for the last two weeks that the number is seven. And I think that number came from historical number when less people had staked their ether. As more people stake their ether, the amount of ether issuance actually goes up. So somebody corrected us and said it's actually 15. And I verified this with Polenia and so a few others. 15 Gwe is the ultrasound barrier. So, Ryan, if we merged today, we would actually not be ultrasound.
00:14:38.350 - 00:14:39.754, Speaker A: We would still be issuing ether.
00:14:39.822 - 00:14:41.858, Speaker B: We're still inflating more eth than we're burning.
00:14:41.954 - 00:14:42.406, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:42.508 - 00:14:49.078, Speaker B: And so we're at nine, so this has to go back up to 15 in order for us to start the burning process of fire.
00:14:49.244 - 00:14:53.562, Speaker A: Can we get some ponzies back? Can we have just one ponzi, please?
00:14:53.616 - 00:15:01.466, Speaker B: Just all we need. Just for a few days anyway, like post merge. This is the math behind that, by the way. Anything you want to say about that from Don?
00:15:01.568 - 00:15:17.218, Speaker A: Yeah, here's the math, if you just want to check it out. You take the number of active validators on the beacon chain and then you calculate the square root of that and multiply that by 00:29. So that's how you get the number, the ultrasound barrier number.
00:15:17.304 - 00:15:26.510, Speaker B: There you go. Bankless is backed by math. Yeah. This is an article from the defined Ethereum. Gas fees fall to the lowest level in two years. Did you know that? Two year lows.
00:15:26.590 - 00:15:30.902, Speaker A: Yeah, two years ago, the bull market lasted about two years, so that makes sense.
00:15:31.036 - 00:15:36.598, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess it's not as dire as it seems, as it sounds. I think gas fees will go right back.
00:15:36.684 - 00:15:37.686, Speaker A: Yeah, they definitely come back up.
00:15:37.708 - 00:16:03.950, Speaker B: This is kind of a short term thing, and probably in a post merge world, or even leading up to the merge, we'll see some increase, but. Okay. Markets up this week saw a lot of green candles in bitcoin and ether, and it seems like the reason for this is maybe decent CPI numbers. On the face of it, it doesn't look decent. So here's breaking from Bloomberg. Us consumer prices rise 8.5% in July from a year earlier.
00:16:03.950 - 00:16:09.650, Speaker B: That sounds bad. But then they also had slower than estimated, so maybe good.
00:16:09.800 - 00:16:50.826, Speaker A: Maybe good. Okay, so the trick about this is that actual July inflation was actually reported at zero. So there was zero inflation in the month of July. We have the prices, consumer prices or whatever are the same that they were one month ago, and so it's 8.5% because that is a twelve month lagging indicator. And so that's actually the really bullish news, is that inflation seemed to have ran up against a wall and has not gone higher for at least 30 days in a row. So I mean, I would love to see this continue for another month just to have another data point, but this is the news that you want to see if you want to get bullish.
00:16:51.018 - 00:17:06.690, Speaker B: So I think the average analyst expectation was 8.7%. Inflation, annual inflation, and it came in at 8.5%. And as you said, there was no month to month increase. At least that's what it seems like. So let's declare victory. What meme are we looking at here, David?
00:17:06.770 - 00:17:22.090, Speaker A: Yeah, this is the squid games guy. Where? On the left. He's looking just, like disheveled and fearful, like 10,000 yards. Yeah. Fetal position. And the caption is March of this year, inflation at 8.5%. Like, oh, my God, inflation at 8.5%.
00:17:22.090 - 00:17:27.820, Speaker A: And now we're in August and we're at. Inflation is at 8.5% and we're dancing like, all right, it's coming down.
00:17:28.830 - 00:17:58.786, Speaker B: I guess that's what it is. And markets really like this as well. It's not just crypto, but traditional risk on assets, let's say, including stocks. And the tradfi markets seem to be telling us that this is like a mild recession, only that we already kind of dipped and it's looking kind of mild. And Powell does not need to be Volcker in order to curb inflation. Volcker, of course, tightened the monetary policy pretty excessively in the 1980s, and Powell maybe doesn't need to do that. And the soft landing is within sight.
00:17:58.786 - 00:18:14.086, Speaker B: It's even possible. So the s and P is up. It's a 50% retracement from the June lows of 4227, and the Nasdaq just bounced 21% from its June lows.
00:18:14.278 - 00:18:30.190, Speaker A: This is the moment that the crypto markets also just shot right up. Like bitcoin went from 2000, $300,000, and then, like half a day later it was above 24,000. And then that's when ether was at 1700. And then as soon as this thing was announced, it just shot up to 1850.
00:18:30.260 - 00:18:35.294, Speaker B: I mean, some people are saying, david, that the Nasdaq, as of yesterday, actually entered bull market territory.
00:18:35.422 - 00:18:37.762, Speaker A: Wow. We're using the bull market word wow.
00:18:37.816 - 00:19:06.010, Speaker B: Yeah, people are actually using that term. And I can't tell the statement that always remains true no matter what part you're in. In the market cycles, sentiment follows price, right? And so now we've seen price increase a couple of months in a row, and now the sentiment feels completely different than it did just six weeks ago. And so you wonder how much of that is going to happen. I'm not ready to say we're out of the woods yet, but I don't know. I'm just feeling pretty bullish this week on the merge.
00:19:06.670 - 00:19:32.806, Speaker A: We get lower inflation. Remember when we had our conversation with Luke Gromman and also all of our, like, the takeaway from all of those is that, yes, wow, things are looking really bad, but there's like this needle that we can thread, that the macro actually turns bullish at the same time that the merge happens. And this, so far, is the reality playing out. Ryan, they also said that we're going.
00:19:32.808 - 00:19:41.254, Speaker B: To have multiple dunks in the tank. I remember Lyn Alden making this pretty clear that it'll look like inflation recovers for a period of time and everyone will celebrate and be like, hey, it's good.
00:19:41.292 - 00:19:41.734, Speaker A: We're fine.
00:19:41.772 - 00:19:55.078, Speaker B: We're back to the good old days again, and then we'll get dunked back in the tank again, and inflation will be back, and this will happen a few more times over the next decade. So I'm also conscious of that. But I don't know. It's hard not to be bullish in crypto.
00:19:55.094 - 00:19:58.758, Speaker A: Well, if you shorten your time frames, Ryan, it's really bullish.
00:19:58.934 - 00:20:06.830, Speaker B: Whatever. Just buy and hold. Okay, people, forget this. Why are we even talking about this week to week? David but this chart also looks good. What are we looking at here?
00:20:06.900 - 00:20:30.082, Speaker A: Yeah, this is the TVL chart on layer twos. And so it is also having a bull market. It's been like up 40% in TVL on layer twos in the last, like two weeks or so. So kind of just like the ETH BTC ratio, it went down bigly. It went from like six or 7 billion in layer twos down to under 4 billion. But now we are up to 6 billion in layer twos within striking distance of new highs.
00:20:30.146 - 00:20:35.362, Speaker B: And TVL, of course, is like, what assets? The total value of assets on these value deposited.
00:20:35.426 - 00:20:35.846, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:35.948 - 00:20:56.294, Speaker B: So it's like assets under management, I guess, like aum of these layer twos. That's what it basically means. More talk on TvL a little bit later in this episode, by the way, there also appears to be a lot of money sitting on the sidelines. David. This is a list from Fintech Frank, of sidelined capital, $23 billion worth. What are we looking at here? David?
00:20:56.342 - 00:21:08.862, Speaker A: Yeah, we're looking at a list of all these funds that raised a bunch of money that have not yet deployed it. So a 16 z coming in at the top at $7.6 billion in cash. A lot of cash. Paradigm, 2.5 billion. FTX Ventures, 2 billion.
00:21:08.862 - 00:21:16.982, Speaker A: Katie Hahn Ventures, 1.5 billion. Hive mine, 1.5 billion. It keeps on going. There's a lot of cash out there, this is all crypto cash.
00:21:17.116 - 00:21:18.694, Speaker B: These are crypto funds, yes.
00:21:18.732 - 00:21:22.770, Speaker A: But they are not necessarily meant for bitcoin and ether.
00:21:22.850 - 00:21:23.142, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:23.196 - 00:21:36.922, Speaker A: I think they're meant for startups and investments. In my mind, I look at this and I'm like, oh, job security for startups. Like, funding. Funding is not yet secured, but there's funding out there.
00:21:36.976 - 00:21:59.170, Speaker B: That's one thing I think. The other thing I think of is, oh, my God. Private equity valuations are not going down anytime soon. Right. So that's good. If you're retail and you can't get in these private round deals anyway, it's like, there could be a lot of value on the public side relative to private, which is pretty good. Like bitcoin and ETH might look like good purchases or other DFI assets that have been tokenized.
00:21:59.170 - 00:22:07.874, Speaker B: All right, did you know we just passed the birthday of EIP 15? Five nine.
00:22:07.992 - 00:22:22.358, Speaker A: One year of EIP 1559. As a result of EIP 1559, 2.1% of the total ETH supply has been burnt in the last year. So that's 2.5 million ether. Pretty good amount of ether.
00:22:22.454 - 00:22:23.546, Speaker B: That's a huge amount.
00:22:23.648 - 00:22:31.302, Speaker A: That's great. That's great. Ultrasound or not, the EIP 1559 is kicking in. Is always going to be bullish.
00:22:31.366 - 00:22:35.246, Speaker B: Burning five eth a minute last year. Wow, that's kind of average. Okay.
00:22:35.348 - 00:22:35.994, Speaker A: A lot of ETh.
00:22:36.042 - 00:22:55.086, Speaker B: The most famous EIP in existence. How many people do you think know what EIP 15 five nine is? 1559. How many people out there even, just, like, let's take crypto people, give me a percentage of people you think that know what this EIP is and its significance.
00:22:55.198 - 00:22:59.570, Speaker A: I think a good 20 to 30,000 people know EIP 1559.
00:22:59.640 - 00:23:01.270, Speaker B: Really? 20 to 30,000 people?
00:23:01.420 - 00:23:02.950, Speaker A: That might be a little high, actually.
00:23:03.020 - 00:23:03.910, Speaker B: You think that's high?
00:23:03.980 - 00:23:04.998, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's high.
00:23:05.084 - 00:23:08.342, Speaker B: We have more bankless listeners than 20 to 30,000. There's got to be more than that.
00:23:08.396 - 00:23:10.140, Speaker A: Doesn't mean they understand it.
00:23:10.510 - 00:23:11.226, Speaker B: Come on.
00:23:11.328 - 00:23:14.922, Speaker A: I listen to a lot of podcasts with only half my brain. Okay?
00:23:14.976 - 00:23:34.802, Speaker B: So I don't mean understand it to the depth that know the number understands it. Yeah, this is what I mean, David. I mean that just like bitcoin has memed that the half 21 million hard cap in 21 million hard cap, some of those core numbers, how many people do you think?
00:23:34.936 - 00:23:36.978, Speaker A: I have no idea. I have no idea.
00:23:37.064 - 00:23:42.610, Speaker B: I think it's still probably, like ten to 20% of all crypto buyers.
00:23:43.350 - 00:23:44.322, Speaker A: That's low.
00:23:44.456 - 00:23:45.826, Speaker B: I think it's that though.
00:23:45.928 - 00:23:46.482, Speaker A: Wow.
00:23:46.616 - 00:23:51.222, Speaker B: Of people that own crypto, there's a lot of people that own crypto. I mean, it's true. Bought like dogecoin and stuff.
00:23:51.276 - 00:23:51.686, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:51.788 - 00:24:04.140, Speaker B: They just don't know what EIP 15 five nine is, what an EIP is. The significance of like, eth is burning. What does that even mean? There's a lot to this stuff. It's not simple to understand.
00:24:04.510 - 00:24:18.990, Speaker A: I think as you have more capital, you likely know what EIP 1559 is. So on an individual per person basis, sure. But I think over 50% of all capital in the crypto industry understands EIP 1559.
00:24:19.140 - 00:24:22.350, Speaker B: That's cool. And what's next? EIP, the second most famous four.
00:24:22.500 - 00:24:46.930, Speaker A: Four. Yeah, we'll get there next. There's also this really cool chart of EIP 1559 before and after it was included and just shows a really good mechanism design. Like this is what EIP 1559 was supposed to do. Like on the left side of this green line. Before EIP 1559 was introduced, the estimated gas for inclusion on the Ethereum blockchain was all over the place. Super volatile.
00:24:46.930 - 00:25:05.918, Speaker A: And on the right side, it's just way more regular, way more efficient. Yeah, there are a few spikes to the upside because of NFT drops, but it's just a much more stable mechanism. And overall it has led to an actual reduction, like, I think a ten to 15% reduction of perceived gas prices, as in people overpaying for gas. Really cool chart here.
00:25:06.004 - 00:25:10.894, Speaker B: A lot less volatility. You can see a lot more stability. It's really great. David, what's coming up next?
00:25:11.012 - 00:25:34.774, Speaker A: Coming up next in this show, we're going to cover the merge. We're going to tell you when exactly the exact number that the merge will happen at. We finally have it. So that's going to come up next. We're also going to talk about Tornado cash and the first ever illegal smart contract and how 7.5 out of the $11 billion of TvL on Salana was fake. Question mark.
00:25:34.774 - 00:26:07.182, Speaker A: Wow, what a story. What a claim. So we're going to get into all of these stories and more right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Rocket pool is your friendly, decentralized, ethereum staking protocol. You can stake your eth with rocket pool and get our Eth in return, allowing you to stake your Eth and use it in DFI at the same time. You can get 4% on your eth by staking it with rocket pool, but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating nodes. Running a rocket pool node is easier to set up than running a solo node and you only need 16 eth to get started.
00:26:07.182 - 00:26:43.494, Speaker A: Why would you do this? You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled ETH, so your Apy is boosted. So if you're bullish e staking, you can increase your ap y and get some extra tokens by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network, which currently has over a thousand independent validators. It's yield farming, but with ethereum nodes you can get started@rocketpool.net and also join the rocket pool community in their discord. You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there Makerdao is the OG Defi protocol, the first defi protocol to ever exist. Even before we called it defi, Makerdao produces Dai, the industry's most battle tested and resilient stablecoin using Maker. You don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity.
00:26:43.494 - 00:27:22.466, Speaker A: Instead, you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mint dai directly. With Maker, the power to mint new money is in your hands and there's something new in the Makerdao ecosystem. Every time a new maker vault is opened, the owner can claim a poem which contributes funds to one tree planted, an organization with ongoing global reforestation efforts, creating a world where digital participation and the health of our environment can live side by side. Soon, Maker will be present on all chains and layer twos, bringing the biggest and best DFI credit facility to everywhere there is dFi. Today you can mint Dai on Oasis app, dFisaver or other DFI protocols that you use. So follow Maker on Twitter at makerdao and learn from the oldest and most resilient dow in existence.
00:27:22.578 - 00:27:50.722, Speaker B: All right guys, we are back and we're talking about the merge. There's been some major updates this week, including we have a merge date. We're going to get to that in a moment, but first things first. David, while I was out in the UK, the Gorely testnet merged. So this is sort of, we've called it kind of the preshow or the dress rehearsal for the main net Ethereum merge. And it happened this week. You were actually on the call, I think, hosting the call to bankless YouTube when it happened.
00:27:50.722 - 00:27:52.082, Speaker B: So tell us what happened this week.
00:27:52.136 - 00:28:19.766, Speaker A: Yeah, there was like 50 people on the call. It was a live stream. You can go watch it on the YouTube. But basically we all sat on Zoom and watched the goalie testnet merge, and then it merged, and then we were like, okay, it's a little bit like all these merges are like a little bit like y two k, you know, it's going to happen. Nothing's going to break before that moment. It's the moment afterwards that everyone's interested in. It's like, all right, is there any damage? Like, is everyone okay? Is that anything broken? And so it took a while for us to figure out if anything was broken.
00:28:19.766 - 00:28:33.086, Speaker A: There was an oh, shit. Moment when this thing wasn't finalizing or something, but it turned out to be a nothing burger. Turned out to be just like false reporting. And so after like four or five or 6 hours, people kind of realized like, yo, nothing broke. Nothing.
00:28:33.188 - 00:28:41.460, Speaker B: People are saying like that. I saw some chatter on this. I didn't see any of it live because I was traveling. But devs look scared or something at some point, right?
00:28:42.470 - 00:28:55.990, Speaker A: There's something that wasn't finalizing, but it actually was finalizing. It just wasn't reporting that. It was finalized on the front end. It was something like this, some technical thing that I can't. So for a while, oh, it's not finalizing. It's not finalizing. And then people are realizing, no, it is finalizing.
00:28:56.810 - 00:29:02.022, Speaker B: So overall, it was like, successful, just like previous merges. No issues whatsoever.
00:29:02.086 - 00:29:35.102, Speaker A: No significant issues whatsoever. And then what happens next? This morning, Thursday morning, there was a consensus layer call with all the core devs where they decided the TTD for the real merge. The TTD is the total terminal difficulty. It's basically like a block height, but it is effectively the date. So the merge date has been decided. The emerge has been officially announced. It's coming in at a TTD number that's very, very large, but effectively puts us at the trajectory of September 15 to 16th.
00:29:35.246 - 00:29:47.222, Speaker B: There it is. That's the date then, September 15 to 16th. Okay, so back us into that again. So we have got this very large number, which is the TTD. And that stands for what?
00:29:47.276 - 00:29:48.610, Speaker A: Total terminal difficulty.
00:29:48.690 - 00:29:49.430, Speaker B: It's.
00:29:52.430 - 00:30:12.958, Speaker A: Basically a number that we're going to approach as the miners do their thing. The reason why it's done this way, if you want to find out, there was an episode we recorded with Tim Baco forever ago. But once we hit a total terminal difficulty of that very large number, which doesn't really make any sense, it's basically approximately September 15 to 16th, Thursday or Friday of that week.
00:30:13.044 - 00:30:21.794, Speaker B: Okay, so has the code been activated yet? It's just been selected right now. The TTD. And then it gets activated at what point in time?
00:30:21.912 - 00:30:35.334, Speaker A: Yeah, there's these two software updates that will go out for the consensus layer and the execution layer. And then once those nodes get updated, people will update their nodes to follow the merge and merge at that particular time.
00:30:35.532 - 00:30:57.742, Speaker B: Okay. And so that is approximately September 15 to the 16th. So how likely is it to fall on one of those two days versus outside of it? Are we like 90, 95% probability that we're going to be the 15th, 16th? We don't know the time, the exact time. We will as it approaches, but we don't know exactly when. But it's going to be the 15th or 16th if this TTD number holds up.
00:30:57.796 - 00:31:22.950, Speaker A: Yeah, it has to do with hash power. So as hash power fluctuates up and down, it will change the actual arrival of that TTD number. We saw the gorely estimated date, like, time jump around actually kind of quite a lot. So it started at 06:00 p.m. It went as far as late as midnight, and I was like, damn it, I have to host this thing at midnight. And then it came forward to nine and ended up happening at, like, 940. But we're talking about fluctuations of hours.
00:31:22.950 - 00:31:31.606, Speaker A: I don't know how well that the Gorely testnet translates to the actual proof of work main net, but I don't think there's going to be too much fluctuation here.
00:31:31.708 - 00:31:51.182, Speaker B: Dude, I can't believe. So September 15 to 16th. It's going to happen. We don't know what time of day. We do know we will be on a live stream somewhere watching this happening. I'm going to be sipping a vitalic butyrin, of course, green tea, mixed red wine with red wine, all mulled together in some concoction I've never tasted before. But that's it.
00:31:51.182 - 00:32:00.354, Speaker B: It's going to happen in September. I'm going to enjoy it, and I'm going to enjoy the merge. Do you think anything could go wrong here? I mean, there's always a chance.
00:32:00.472 - 00:32:12.834, Speaker A: I don't think so. This is something that has been planned for so long. The miners aren't like, oh, they're finally merging now. Let's mess with them. No, the miners have known about this, too. There's not going to be any big shenanigans.
00:32:12.882 - 00:32:14.134, Speaker B: We've tested this how many times?
00:32:14.172 - 00:32:19.510, Speaker A: We've tested this a bajillion times. I'm thinking the drama is relatively minimal here.
00:32:19.660 - 00:32:22.542, Speaker B: So a successful merge, 15th to 16th.
00:32:22.626 - 00:32:24.006, Speaker A: Calling the successful Merge.
00:32:24.038 - 00:32:55.886, Speaker B: Yeah, that's incredible. So there you go, guys. That's the date. And make sure you tune in to watch. I think what will be the largest event in crypto crypto history since ethereum was launched? I think this will stand out as one of three events that we've seen so far. Launch of bitcoin, launch of Ethereum, and then merge, which means getting rid of the proof of work Ethereum chain and merging to the new proof of stake consensus layer. It's the third largest event in Crypto's history as far as I'm concerned.
00:32:55.886 - 00:32:59.074, Speaker B: And I think we'll be viewed historically through that as well.
00:32:59.192 - 00:33:00.306, Speaker A: Oh, significantly.
00:33:00.418 - 00:33:01.560, Speaker B: Don't miss it.
00:33:02.010 - 00:33:03.666, Speaker A: It's a good time to be in Ethereum.
00:33:03.778 - 00:33:04.440, Speaker B: Yes.
00:33:04.890 - 00:33:05.798, Speaker A: Other than this.
00:33:05.884 - 00:33:28.522, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw this come through, of course, when I was in the UK. It's just like. But I couldn't believe this was happening. So tell us the headlines. The treasury apparently has sanctioned the virtual currency mixer tornado cash. This is a press release from the US Department of the treasury website. Can you give us the story? What happened here, David?
00:33:28.586 - 00:33:53.270, Speaker A: Yeah, so treasury. OFAC, which OFAC, the Office of Foreign Asset Control, which is part of the treasury, put the tornado cash smart contracts on a specially designated persons list, which is weird because it's not a person. So this is the first. Pretty sure this is the first person to go on a sanctions list. That's not a person.
00:33:53.420 - 00:33:56.374, Speaker B: These are like contracts. Specific ETH addresses that they're naming. Right?
00:33:56.492 - 00:33:56.774, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:56.812 - 00:34:02.202, Speaker B: Specific ethereum contract maps to an ETH address and they put the ETH addresses themselves on the list.
00:34:02.256 - 00:34:36.980, Speaker A: Right. And what's also weird about this list is that it's on the responsibility of the individual to make sure that they are not transacting with somebody on this SDN list. And so if you go out on the street and hand somebody some cash, it's on your responsibility. It's your responsibility to make sure that that person that you're handing cash to is not on the OFAC list because that's your responsibility as an individual who's on the. Yeah, exactly. Like North Korea, Iran, probably enemies of the state. Right, exactly.
00:34:36.980 - 00:34:59.962, Speaker A: And now also tornado cash. And so they can't turn off tornado cash. So what they did is they said, hey, any us citizen that is interacting with tornado cash is in violation of the OFAC SDN list and that can result in criminal penalties. Ryan, did you know that you and I have both interacted with the tornado cash contract address since this went on the OFAC list?
00:35:00.016 - 00:35:04.586, Speaker B: Well, how so, sir? Because I haven't touched any buttons on anything while I was away traveling.
00:35:04.618 - 00:35:27.346, Speaker A: Right. Somebody sent us and bankless ETH one ether from the Tornado cash smart contract. So the Tornado cash smart contract sent David Hoffman EtH, RSA ETH and bankless ETH one ether. And as a result of that, we have violated ofax SCN list because we have engaged with that contract.
00:35:27.458 - 00:35:56.862, Speaker B: How could we be violating when someone sends us these transactions? And by the way, it wasn't just us. Of course. I read it was Logan Paul Vitalik Buterin Fallon. Jimmy Fallon. I guess a troll or somebody trying to make a political point, which I understand kind of the motivations went through and sent tokens from tornado cash to all of these addresses. Is that what happened?
00:35:56.916 - 00:36:10.258, Speaker A: Yep. That's exactly right. Yeah. So every person that received the money violated OFAC. And the reason why this works is that, okay, if North Korea sends you a check, you don't cash it. You don't cash that. And it says, like, from North Korea, you don't cash that thing.
00:36:10.258 - 00:36:19.910, Speaker A: But North Korea can send you money to your Ethereum address with or without your permission. And so this is why this gets incongruent with other mechanisms of payment that we have.
00:36:20.060 - 00:36:25.640, Speaker B: But if North Korea sends cash in the mail to my address.
00:36:26.330 - 00:36:28.434, Speaker A: Right, then you violated OFAC.
00:36:28.482 - 00:36:34.234, Speaker B: Yeah. If I open up my mailbox or if I do what? Or if it's in my mailbox, they send it to me.
00:36:34.272 - 00:36:34.794, Speaker A: I guess so.
00:36:34.832 - 00:36:47.530, Speaker B: Yeah. That's kind of the parallel here. And the challenge with it is, because ETH is completely fungible. The 0.1 ETH just merges with all of the other ether that you have in your wallet. In your wallet.
00:36:47.610 - 00:36:51.210, Speaker A: Do we report this as revenue? The 0.1 eth that went to bank with that eth?
00:36:51.290 - 00:36:51.694, Speaker B: I am not.
00:36:51.732 - 00:36:52.362, Speaker A: Is that revenue?
00:36:52.426 - 00:37:03.780, Speaker B: Any of it? But I don't know how to not to touch. I don't know what to do. David. Someone help me. I don't know what to do. I'm just trying to be. Know a good citizen and not go to.
00:37:03.780 - 00:37:11.814, Speaker B: So, like, what? Here's. Maybe we should read the tweet out from Secretary Blinken. Blinken? When this happened. What's he saying here?
00:37:11.852 - 00:37:54.626, Speaker A: He says we'll continue to aggressively pursue actions against currency mixers laundering virtual currency for criminals. Today, US treasury sanctioned virtual currency mixer tornado cash, which has been used to launder money for us sanctioned North Korea state sponsored cyber hacking group. I did a full show on this, about a 30 to 35 minutes long show, new format, actually, where I interviewed Jerry Britto from Coin center and Collins, a fantastic crypto lawyer. So if you just want the full story on this, Ryan was out of town and so I had to do the state of the nation by myself. But instead of doing the typical, just like, interview format, I kind of tell the story myself and go in and out of interviews with Collins and Jerry. So the full story is available on the bankless YouTube. Crazy story.
00:37:54.626 - 00:37:55.554, Speaker A: Crazy story.
00:37:55.672 - 00:38:32.110, Speaker B: Okay, so the fallout for this tornado cash contracts get listed in the OFAC list, right? Side story is some troll, somebody trying to prove a political point goes and sends a bunch of ETH to specific kind of influencer type ethereum addresses, including, by the way, all of the crypto banks and such. It's just like, everybody got this. Everybody who has an ETH address, who has a large account, that's a side story. Then there was some fallout from this as well. So circle, they froze all of the USDC belonging to the unsuspected tornado.
00:38:35.350 - 00:39:09.210, Speaker A: People put USDC into tornado cash because tornado doesn't only work with ether, it also works for USDC. And so people deposit ether or USDC into tornado cash, wait a little bit while it gets mixed up, and then withdraw later. But you have to wait for a while or else it doesn't work. So all this USCC is sitting in tornado cash. And so at the moment that USCC froze that address, 75,000 USDC was frozen in tornado cash. And so, yeah, USCC regulated, domiciled us entity. They're not going to go up against OFAC over $75,000.
00:39:09.210 - 00:39:12.042, Speaker A: So they just bent the knee. And it's the logical thing to do.
00:39:12.096 - 00:39:20.478, Speaker B: People were mad at circle and Circle for doing this, for freezing the USDC, but it's like completely obvious that this is what they would do.
00:39:20.644 - 00:39:26.590, Speaker A: It's either freeze the account or shut down. It's an obvious trade. Right?
00:39:26.660 - 00:39:48.706, Speaker B: And they're going to have to do this because they're kind of regulated in the way that that's what USDC, the product is. And so if you didn't realize that about USDC, by the way, that is kind of a regulated stablecoin, it's not at all like eth in that way, then kind of now, you know the effects of something like this. And also there's something to do with GitHub as well. So is this a tornado cache?
00:39:48.818 - 00:40:12.302, Speaker A: Yeah, Roman Seminoff, he's a tornado cache developer who published a lot of the Tornado cache open source code. His GitHub was suspended, and so the tornado cache open source code was pulled down from GitHub, which brings in, like, first Amendment questions as to whether or not this actually violates speech. Because, after all, code is just speech. We learned this in the crypto wars of the by the way, there are.
00:40:12.356 - 00:40:27.262, Speaker B: Court cases establishing code and speech together. There's Coach Bernstein, I believe, versus the US in 2000 kind of established code of speech. So this is also us legal precedent as well. Maybe you should go through the summary.
00:40:27.326 - 00:40:35.686, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a great summary thread. I'll go ahead and read it. This is from Seth hurtling. I'll try and do this as fast as possible. This week, U. S. Treasury Department did something it's never done before.
00:40:35.686 - 00:41:06.730, Speaker A: It sanctioned a piece of code. Weird, right? Specifically, treasury added the Tornado cash URL and smart contract addresses to the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list. Tornado cash is a crypto mixer that allows people to maintain their privacy online. Prior to tornado cash sanctions had only been levied against persons. It is illegal for americans to transact with any person on the SCN list. Due to the legal doctrine of corporate personhood, formal business entities can also be put on the naughty list. However, computer code is neither a natural person nor a legal entity.
00:41:06.730 - 00:41:34.538, Speaker A: Code is speech. Bernstein versus the Department of Justice. Similarly, money is speech. Or more precisely, what you do with your money is speech. And then he cites two more court cases as well, Buckley versus Vallejo and citizens in United versus the FEC. The legal doctrine of prior restraint holds that preemptive government censorship is almost always unconstitutional, and even government acts that have a substantial chilling effect, which I've learned is actually a legal phrase on speech, may be unconstitutional. And then he cites another legal court case.
00:41:34.538 - 00:41:47.514, Speaker A: Sanctioned law is a strict liability regime, meaning that if an american transaction with a sanctioned person without intent or even the knowledge of having done so, they can be sentenced to 30 years in federal prison. Ryan, you and I might be sentenced to 30 years in federal prison.
00:41:47.562 - 00:41:51.962, Speaker B: You're smiling when you say this, but this is not a smiling matter. David, why are you smiling?
00:41:52.106 - 00:41:56.574, Speaker A: Are they going to send all, like, 200 of us to federal prison for receiving money from tornado cash?
00:41:56.612 - 00:42:02.210, Speaker B: I don't think so. It sounds absolutely ridiculous. But that is what the letter of the law actually says, does it not?
00:42:02.280 - 00:42:25.626, Speaker A: I will not be going to jail, Ryan. You'll drag me kicking and screaming anyways. The threat continues beyond the likely First Amendment violation. This action also raises significant due process concerns in that the code was not afforded adequate notice or opportunity to appeal, and individuals may be implicated without the means to comply. While this law does not seem to be in the treasury's favor. Litigation will take years to play out. Treasury knows this now.
00:42:25.626 - 00:42:50.386, Speaker A: I've seen a lot of discussions essentially saying tornado cash is used by criminals and hackers, so it deserves to be shut down. While I don't support either, let me explain why this reaction misses the point. This is where we get into free speech stuff. If treasury had sanctioned the criminals and the hackers that use tornado cash, no problem. But tornado cash is an open source code, meaning it's not owned by anyone and is freely available to everyone. It is thus a public good. We enjoy the benefits of public goods and infrastructure every day.
00:42:50.386 - 00:43:17.302, Speaker A: The Internet, wireless networks, money banking system, roads and highways, transportation, infrastructure. Guess what? Criminals use these every day too. Of course we should pursue criminal persons who misuse public goods. But we don't sanction SMTP because hackers send phishing emails, or I 95 because drug dealers drive on it, or cell towers that route terrorist calls. These are not persons. Neither is tornado cash. Like emails and highways, tornado cash has been misused by criminals for criminal ends.
00:43:17.302 - 00:43:52.850, Speaker A: However, tornado cash is also a tool that enables law abiding citizens to maintain their privacy on the blockchain for a host of legal purposes, including political speech, like political donations. Taking this to its logical conclusion, if treasury can sanction tornado cash and can sanction any code, no software is safe. If sanctions are no longer limited to persons, what other objects or information can the government summarily jail you for 30 years for interacting with? Ultimately, there is no freedom without privacy, and there can be no democracy without free speech. Privacy and free speech are the bedrock of free and open societies. Make no mistake, this is what treasury has sanctioned this week. Great thread, great thread. Great summary.
00:43:52.930 - 00:44:37.922, Speaker B: Who put this together? I think it's the legal council of ledger. Well done, Seth hurtlean. Maybe you should get him on the show. This was a fantastic thread and went through all the mean. I think we have some more to talk about this, David, but before we do, this also had some impact on maker potentially. There's some chatter in the maker governance forms about an emergency shutdown. Other DeFi protocols are asking, what if they get put on the OFAC naughty list? What happens to them? So it's one thing for Tornado to be put on it, but what if maker's core contracts were put on the OFAC naughty list because a bad guy decided to use Dai for some purpose that the US did not like? So what are the implications of this? What's actually being considered by Maker?
00:44:37.986 - 00:44:54.770, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's a nesting doll of trouble here. So USDC is now frozen in tornado cash. Can't use USDC in tornado cash. You can put USDC into Maker Dow and mint Dai. And then you can take that dye and put it in tornado cash. Right. So rut row.
00:44:54.770 - 00:45:06.554, Speaker A: Uhoh. And also there's like 40% of outstanding dai that's backed by USDC. So if circle was told by treasury that they need to blacklist the Makerdao.
00:45:06.602 - 00:45:10.478, Speaker B: USDC address because that would something tainted from tornado cash.
00:45:10.564 - 00:45:42.954, Speaker A: Yeah, or it just enables usage of. So like it's kind of similar to. I could spin up a contract, I could write a contract that interacts with tornado cash on my behalf and then I could send my ether or die into that contract and then that contract can go talk to tornado cash. And my addresses haven't touched tornado cash, so I'm free and clear. But the proxy address did go touch Tornado cash. That's basically USCC. And Makerdao is, you can take USCC, go to Makerdao, just use Makerdao to talk to Tornado cash.
00:45:42.954 - 00:45:59.850, Speaker A: It's the same. So like, is treasury really going to let that go? Like rutro. And so this has been caused a great cause of concern in the maker discord. And so they are now more aggressively prioritizing how to become much less dominant of USDC lately.
00:45:59.930 - 00:46:05.274, Speaker B: Yeah. Including, I think how much Dai is backed by USDC.
00:46:05.322 - 00:46:18.486, Speaker A: David, right now there is $3.56 billion of USDC in Maker Dow, which is like, it'd be one thing if it was just a smaller amount, but it's hard to swap out $3.5 billion.
00:46:18.668 - 00:47:16.822, Speaker B: This has been a known challenge that Dai has had. Right, which is like it's trading off some scalability for some decrease in censorship resistance. And the way to get pure censorship resistance and scalability on Ethereum is you actually have to use ETH, which is the most uncensoral store of value asset in order to back all of your diet. Of course they went the multilateral route, which makes sense for the product, but you could swap something else out if needed. So I guess, what do you think about this? First of all, why do you think treasuries is doing this? Do you think? This is partially because North Korea essentially has hacked, they've been involved, implicated in a number of bridge hacks recently and they have used tornado cash to try to anonymize their ill gotten gains. And so now treasury and now U. S.
00:47:16.822 - 00:47:37.242, Speaker B: National security apparatus is taking a very close look at tornado Cash. And so they've just said no one can use this. If you're a us citizen, you just can't use these contracts anymore. Is this where all of this ire is coming from? Because tornado cash has been in existence for like three years, something like this and zcash even longer, which is privacy enables cryptocurrency.
00:47:37.386 - 00:48:16.282, Speaker A: Yeah. The implications of this are significant. And people are mainly asking, all right, where does this go next? How many more smart contracts are going to become like, quote unquote illegal? It's kind of unfortunate that tornado cash. I asked Alex Spanovic from Nanson, like, how much of tornado cash funds is illicit, deemed illicit, and he came back to me with a number of 35% of funds going through tornado cash is stuff that we know came from, like, bridge hacks, some sort of hacks. But, Ryan, that's just what we know about. So could be as much as 50% of the money flowing through tornado cash is like, illegal or illicit, which makes it really hard.
00:48:16.336 - 00:48:22.022, Speaker B: Not that they're wrong that it is. There is some illicit activity, illegal activity on it.
00:48:22.176 - 00:48:25.310, Speaker A: There's more than just like a little. There's quite a lot.
00:48:25.460 - 00:49:10.122, Speaker B: But the precedent that this sets and the implication anyone using tornado cash is guilty. I mean, at its core, tornado Cash is just a service that allows you to have privacy. I had to take, as I was thinking about this a little bit and the implications of how I feel as somebody who received some funds from tornado cash that were just sent to me. They're trying to make you feel like a criminal for wanting basic privacy. At its core, that's what tornado cash is doing. And I don't think that's a radical thing for us to want the same sort of privacy anonymization that we have in the real world with cash. If I were to pay you a cash payment, David, no one needs to know about that.
00:49:10.122 - 00:49:44.230, Speaker B: The government doesn't have to record that in a ledger. The amount that I gave you, you don't have to identify yourself to me. I don't have to identify yourself to me if I give you some gold. There's no sort of registry that needs to be created. And it's not radical for us to want digital privacy, privacy on our digital transactions. What I do think is radical about the way treasury has gone about doing that this is that an unelected surveillance bureau, that's what treasury is, the executive branch. They're unelected and they are a surveillance bureau, and they can make privacy illegal.
00:49:44.230 - 00:50:03.814, Speaker B: I think this is normalizing tyranny if we let this go, because what privacy tools do they suggest we use, if not public good code like tornado? If I want to have some sort of privacy on my crypto transactions, what tool do I use? Treasury.
00:50:03.862 - 00:50:04.218, Speaker A: Right.
00:50:04.304 - 00:50:08.574, Speaker B: Are they saying we can't use any of it as an american citizen? Sorry, privacy, more or less.
00:50:08.612 - 00:50:49.322, Speaker A: They're saying that more or less is exactly what you're saying. Because the reason why tornado cash is being used by criminals is because it's really good at offering individuals privacy. And so it's not like criminals would be able to use tornado cash in silo. Right. If only criminals were using tornado cash, you would be like, okay, well, it's criminals going in, therefore criminals going out. But it's because tornado cash is useful to individuals and it's because it does provide privacy to individuals. That's actually what enables the fact that criminals and hijack hackers can use this because they can't use tornado cash without there being a crowd to hide in.
00:50:49.322 - 00:51:11.842, Speaker A: So it's a very important order of operations as the individuals, just like you and me and people who don't want to have the eyes of the world upon their financial history to see what they're up to, they use tornado cash. And that gives the option of criminals to use tornado cash because they couldn't use it without normal people also using it. But the normal people come first, which makes that ours, Ryan, in my mind.
00:51:11.976 - 00:52:13.462, Speaker B: Yeah. And the other piece about this, of course, that's indefensibles, is the breach of First Amendment rights, which is freedom of speech. Right. If governments can start shutting down Gitcoin or, sorry, GitHub, repos of developers for writing code, that's a scary prospect that brings up some dystopian ideology. So I'm still kind of trying to figure out what we do as a crypto industry to react against this. Have you identified any sort of action, steps, things we can do? I mean, is treasury going to get sued at some point? Who can sue them for this? I guess we have to settle this in courts, also in courts, legislation. Crypto friendly politician politicians that want to respect and embed in our legal protocols, basically digital rights, which is a thing we, I think as Americans, probably everyone across the world, do not have embedded in our legal have.
00:52:13.462 - 00:52:30.234, Speaker B: We have no digital rights at this point. We have to ultimately find politicians, support politicians who will write laws in order to protect and enforce our digital rights. But for now, we have a first amendment, at least in the US, with freedom of speech, and this should fall under that. So what do we do with all of this data?
00:52:30.352 - 00:52:53.034, Speaker A: The good thing is that we've done this before. The cryptography wars of the same fight where the United States of America wanted to make code illegal and the cryptographers won the fight by saying, no code is free speech. We're basically revisiting this same exact. There's already legal precedent for this. The only difference now is now there's money. Now it's not cryptography. Now it's cryptocurrency.
00:52:53.034 - 00:53:08.518, Speaker A: So we're going to, like Ryan Speedrun, the history of money and finance and now also law. And we've done this before and we'll do it again. It's just going to be like, yeah, we're going to have to, like, every time they take away our rights, we're going to have to fight for them back. But crypto people fight for their territory, right? This is our home.
00:53:08.684 - 00:53:29.630, Speaker B: Are you optimistic that we'll be able to kind of get this sort of stuff overturned in the same way that we did with the previous crypto wars? Or do you think the US has passed that point when it comes to finance and money transactions? Because every single democracy, western liberal democracy, is going to have to contend with this because these privacy tools are not going away.
00:53:29.700 - 00:53:36.642, Speaker A: Right. That's the other thing, is so many privacy tools are going to. It's going to be whack a mole. They're not going to be able to ban them all.
00:53:36.696 - 00:53:55.030, Speaker B: Aztec layer two, complete layer two, which is, I believe it's EVM compatible as well. And privacy is not quite, but like privacy for everything you put inside Vastec, is that illegal? Are Americans just banned from legally using crypto privacy tools?
00:53:57.130 - 00:54:10.154, Speaker A: How is that the only way for them to make a ruling that satisfies their actual desires is just to say all transactions on a blockchain need to be fully traceable. And at that point, it's like, well, you're banning ethereum. Yeah.
00:54:10.272 - 00:54:12.314, Speaker B: Which goes to the question of where does this. David.
00:54:12.362 - 00:54:12.574, Speaker A: Right.
00:54:12.612 - 00:54:19.466, Speaker B: Because today we find the tornado cash smart contracts on the band list. Tomorrow, is it uniswap?
00:54:19.578 - 00:54:21.886, Speaker A: Right. For the SEC? Yeah, sure.
00:54:21.988 - 00:54:28.462, Speaker B: I mean, like the SEC or of, let's say North Korea uses uniswap for some transactions.
00:54:28.526 - 00:54:29.122, Speaker A: Sure they do.
00:54:29.176 - 00:54:32.900, Speaker B: In fact, on the back of this, just to cause more chaos, maybe they will.
00:54:33.750 - 00:54:42.322, Speaker A: What if North Korea became, like, the dominant LP for Dai or uniswap LP for ether and USDC?
00:54:42.386 - 00:54:42.806, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:42.908 - 00:54:47.074, Speaker A: What if they had 50% of the liquidity? All of your counter trades are North Korea.
00:54:47.122 - 00:54:50.258, Speaker B: They could be listening to this podcast and getting these and be like that's.
00:54:50.274 - 00:54:51.414, Speaker A: A really good idea.
00:54:51.612 - 00:54:52.374, Speaker B: For real.
00:54:52.492 - 00:54:54.570, Speaker A: When does the bankless podcast illegal?
00:54:55.870 - 00:55:15.326, Speaker B: These are the questions I'm asking. Right. Like, we're going down this path, and this is a very dystopian path. I feel like we're going down. And it's the first time I felt like that with crypto. It's like, oh, okay, we've entered a new territory now. Nation states are actually attacking what we're trying to do in this space and attacking the freedom of individual citizens as a result.
00:55:15.326 - 00:55:18.078, Speaker B: And I think that's different. This week has felt different.
00:55:18.164 - 00:55:18.606, Speaker A: Right.
00:55:18.708 - 00:55:19.886, Speaker B: Starting pistol on all of this.
00:55:19.908 - 00:55:21.470, Speaker A: David, we got to move on, though.
00:55:21.620 - 00:55:22.366, Speaker B: Are you sure?
00:55:22.468 - 00:55:27.954, Speaker A: If you want the full story, you got to go watch the YouTube video that's already out on the YouTube.
00:55:28.002 - 00:55:33.510, Speaker B: Yeah, it's hard to move on. Okay. The fake team that made Solana defi.
00:55:34.570 - 00:56:05.854, Speaker A: Let's speed run this one. Okay, so there was this ecosystem on Solana that had a bunch of TVL. It was saber and a few other protocols. Sunny aggregator. And there was a dev team behind it. And it had $7 billion out of the ten or $12 billion of Salana TVL. But as it turns out, instead of like a suite of devs and a big community, it was actually just like one guy and his brother with a bunch of sock puppets.
00:56:05.902 - 00:56:08.686, Speaker B: Ryan, he's just faking different online identities.
00:56:08.798 - 00:56:42.298, Speaker A: Yeah. And so I'll read some quotes out from this article. Coding as eleven purportedly independent developers. Ian, how do you pronounce this name? Ian Macaliano. Macaliano, a 20 something computer wiz from Texas, created a vast web of interlocking DFI protocols that projected billions of dollars of double counted value onto the saber ecosystem that temporarily inflated the TVL on Solana. As the network was racing towards its zenith last November, the Defi faithful regarded TVL as the barometer of on chain activity. Of course.
00:56:42.298 - 00:57:08.230, Speaker A: So a quote from a blog post that was unreleased, which is how all this news came about, says that Ian set wrote, I devised a scheme to maximize Salana's TVL. I would build protocols that stack on top of each other so that a dollar would be counted several times. Yin's ploy worked for a while. By his count, Saber and Sonny comprised 7.5 billion of Salana's 10.5 billion TVL. At their peak, billions of those dollars were double counted between his two protocols.
00:57:08.230 - 00:57:46.058, Speaker A: And so there's also the component of fake friends. In public, Ian and his brother Dylan called their anonymous personas friends or friends of friends. Any quote from Ian I wanted to make it look like a lot of people were building on our protocol rather than ship 20 disjointed programs as one person. So they just like, spun up 1020 developers, but on the same protocol. And so this whole entire thing created this narrative that had a substantial role in driving the Salana token price from under $40 in July to a peak of 259 in November of 2021. A significant portion of bullish Salana narrative now seems to be based on a series of deceptions, wrote Coindesk. So TLdr.
00:57:46.058 - 00:58:13.658, Speaker A: This guy Ian and his brother built an interwoven DFi ecosystem on Salana, spun up a bunch of Twitter sock puppets to make people think that there were a lot of devs, attracted a small amount of TVL that would then double, triple, quadruple, be counted in the overall TVL of Solana. And really what this whole entire story reveals is that less than a small handful of people with dishonest intentions can produce significantly distorted realities in the crypto markets. Absolutely crazy.
00:58:13.744 - 00:58:24.986, Speaker B: They did. This is 7.5 billion of Salana's, 10.5 billion Tvl at their peak. It was basically faked by this one dude and all of its sock puckets.
00:58:25.098 - 00:58:25.946, Speaker A: And his brother.
00:58:26.058 - 00:58:44.082, Speaker B: And his brother. What's crazy? I guess the implications of this are we were talking about the beginning of this episode, the TVL on layer two. It's very important not to. Very important to know that TVL is a very gameable metric at this point. And there are people who are actively trying to.
00:58:44.136 - 00:58:47.782, Speaker A: It isn't when you put ether into.
00:58:47.916 - 00:58:48.742, Speaker B: Is what I mean.
00:58:48.796 - 00:59:02.086, Speaker A: Well, not necessarily that too. When you put ether into arbitram or optimism or whatever that is TVL, it's how you count it. People just forgot to stop double counting all this stuff and really didn't look under the hood.
00:59:02.278 - 00:59:13.360, Speaker B: Yes. So sloppy counting of it. And TVL is only one metric among many, I think is. And I guess the other takeaway are be careful who you trust online. I don't know.
00:59:14.210 - 00:59:16.010, Speaker A: Anon devs are always dubious.
00:59:16.090 - 00:59:19.998, Speaker B: Well, Satoshi is Anon dev, right?
00:59:20.004 - 00:59:24.286, Speaker A: It's like not always dubious, but they're more dubious than a non Anon dev.
00:59:24.388 - 00:59:51.850, Speaker B: They can start with a clean slate, clean reputation every time. So I think it's worth saying that it should take them longer to establish trust than a person in the real world who basically established your trust over multiple cycles of doing good things. And that's how you create your reputation and your name. A name for yourself. And Anon could just have one reputation for one account, another for another. So yeah, we have to be careful who we trust. I guess that is the end state.
00:59:52.000 - 01:00:10.746, Speaker A: The next coindesk article about. This concludes with something really funny quote from the article says, further users have now seemingly been abandoned, with the Macalinos announcing that they're shifting projects, shifting their focus towards new projects on the upstart Aptos blockchain. So they're just rotating to the new faster blockchain.
01:00:10.778 - 01:00:28.514, Speaker B: They did it with Solana. Now they're going to play the same trick with Aptos. So be wary of that. Crypto nation, beware of that. Coming up next, uniswap is getting a new foundation. All right, question mark, tell us about that, David. Also a brand new arbitram train and Reddit is adopting it.
01:00:28.514 - 01:00:38.886, Speaker B: It seems like Vitalik gives a statement, an idea on theory crafting. We'll talk about that as well. It's all coming at you. But first we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:00:39.068 - 01:01:19.166, Speaker A: There is a brand new staking feature in the Ledger live app today. We all like staking the assets that we're bullish on, and now you can stake seven different coins inside the ledger live app, Cosmos, Polkadot Tron algorithm, Tezos, Solana, and of course, Ethereum. With Ledger live, you can take money from your bank account, buy your most bullish crypto asset, and stake that asset to its network all inside the Ledger Live app through a partnership with Figment, Ledger also lets you choose which validator you want to stake your assets with. And Ledger is running its own validating nodes, offering a convenient way to participate in network validation. And it even comes with slashing insurance. Ledger live is truly becoming the battle station for the bankless world. So go download Ledger live.
01:01:19.166 - 01:01:52.554, Speaker A: If you have a ledger already, you probably already have it and get started securely staking your crypto assets the layer two era is upon us. Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day, and we need layer two bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life. Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge. With across. You don't have to worry about high fees or long wait times. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across its bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens between layer two s and Ethereum across its critical ecosystem infrastructure and across v two has just launched.
01:01:52.554 - 01:02:33.102, Speaker A: Their new version focuses on higher capital efficiency, layer two to layer two transfers, and a brand new chain with Polygon, all while prioritizing high security and low fees. You can be a part of across this story by joining their discord and using across for all of your layer two transferring needs. So go to across to quickly and securely bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, polygon, arbitram, or Boba networks. And we are back. Coinbase lands a $10 trillion client in Blackrock, providing Aladdin clients access to crypto trading and custody via Coinbase prime. So Coinbase is going to be the crypto back end by BlackRock, which is the biggest AUM institution hedge fund ever in the world.
01:02:33.236 - 01:02:34.346, Speaker B: 10 trillion.
01:02:34.538 - 01:02:36.366, Speaker A: You can't catch a bigger fish than that.
01:02:36.468 - 01:02:40.606, Speaker B: Yeah, the biggest fish. I guess entering crypto is the bottom line here.
01:02:40.708 - 01:03:00.550, Speaker A: So the Coinbase prime will provide crypto trading custody, prime brokerages and reporting capabilities to Aladdin institutional's client base who are also clients of Coinbase. I don't know what Aladdin is, but something associated with Blackrock. Anyways, coin the equity for Coinbase up 15% on the news, bouncing off the low hose. The low lows that it set a couple of months ago.
01:03:00.620 - 01:03:02.514, Speaker B: That's good because it's been down bad lately.
01:03:02.562 - 01:03:05.526, Speaker A: Really getting rid a bit of bullish news.
01:03:05.628 - 01:03:25.598, Speaker B: Also got this, David. This is a tweet from arbitram. A new dawn is upon us. Arbitram Nova is now live and open to the public. Nova, this is a definition. It's not like arbitram one. It is a new chain built on the arbitrum, any trust technology and optimized for social and gaming applications that require ultra low fees and high security.
01:03:25.598 - 01:03:38.530, Speaker B: So this is another instance of arbitram. It is not the arbitrum one chain. Arbitrum. When they came on the podcast about a year ago and they were launching the very first arbitrum chain, they said they could do this. They said they could launch other chains as well.
01:03:38.600 - 01:03:42.386, Speaker A: It's kind of implied in the arbitram one name. One kind of implies two.
01:03:42.488 - 01:03:44.110, Speaker B: But this is not two. This is Nova.
01:03:44.190 - 01:03:46.162, Speaker A: Yeah, but it is the second chain, though.
01:03:46.296 - 01:04:01.430, Speaker B: Arbitrum. Nova. Nova means new, I guess so. It's a new chain built on Arbitrum. And it is for social and gaming applications that need ultra low fees and also high security. That's part of the news. The other part of the news is coinciding with the launch.
01:04:01.430 - 01:04:23.806, Speaker B: Reddit. Reddit will be migrating community points onto Nova. So of course, Reddit, 400,000 some od daily active users, of which I'm one big fan of Reddit. It's a social media entity. They are going to be deploying on Nova as well. If you pop the hood on Nova, this is the website. What actually is it? David? So it's a new chain from Arbitram technology.
01:04:23.806 - 01:04:28.660, Speaker B: So it's definitely a roll up for game developers and social projects. We know that.
01:04:30.390 - 01:05:05.866, Speaker A: The main difference is that the Arbitrum one chain posts all of its data to the main Ethereum chain. And the main Ethereum chain is like where you get a lot of costs for roll ups. So Arbitrum Nova has kind of created a committee of entities like Coinbase Cloud, I think is one of them, and there's others as well, that instead of the Ethereum blockchain, they're going to post data to this committee. Right? So Reddit is one of these people. Consensus, FTX, Google Cloud, Offchain Labs, Quicknode, P to P. And so instead of posting it to Ethereum, they're posting it to all of these entities that can kind of use databases. So it's more centralized.
01:05:05.866 - 01:05:20.498, Speaker A: But for gaming and social applications, it doesn't really matter because they're not financial applications. So you don't need as much security. And the costs are just probably many orders of magnitude cheaper, faster, cheaper, like basically zero transaction fees, I would guess.
01:05:20.584 - 01:05:47.126, Speaker B: Consensus is still secured on Ethereum. So consensus is still ethereum. That's what makes it a roll up. But data is now not being posted on Ethereum. It's being posted this data availability committee run by the set of organizations, right? So it's almost as secure as Ethereum, but the data part is not quite as secure. So there's a bit of a trade off. But in exchange for that trade off, you get a pretty great chain that's very cheap for social and gaming type applications.
01:05:47.158 - 01:06:00.522, Speaker A: That's what Reddit, you get a chain that emulates and has the UX of web two. So it's a great place to start for Reddit points, for example, that you don't need to have metamask pop up and ask for approval.
01:06:00.586 - 01:06:18.906, Speaker B: This is kind of like, if you're into roll up terminology, sounds kind of like a validium. There might be some differences here, and we should probably have arbitram tell us more about it at some point. But yeah, pretty cool and good to see Reddit adoption for sure. This is, by the way, Nova on layer two beat. Look at that TVL.
01:06:18.958 - 01:06:26.374, Speaker A: Nova, well, from zero to $878,000 inside of seven days. So kind of technically up infinity percent.
01:06:26.492 - 01:06:29.480, Speaker B: Yeah, infinity percent. Still under a million dollars.
01:06:29.850 - 01:06:33.658, Speaker A: You got to waste a million dollar TVL in seven days. Is great.
01:06:33.824 - 01:06:40.890, Speaker B: Not if all TVL is fake, David. How can we trust TVL anymore? Did we just talk about that? How about Uniswap? What are they doing?
01:06:40.960 - 01:07:10.658, Speaker A: Yeah, Uniswap is making a foundation. And so a foundation has always been missing, absent from the Uniswap ecosystem. There's Uniswap labs, but that's a for profit company that doesn't have complete and total alignment with the Uni token. Uniswap Labs is the thing that acquired the genie NFT aggregator. But the value of that genie NFT aggregator doesn't go to the Uni token, it goes to uniswap Labs. So we need this Uniswap foundation to kind of put like a central thinking head upon the Uniswap dao. And so this Uniswap foundation has been proposed.
01:07:10.658 - 01:07:29.690, Speaker A: And so this is just a temperature check, but I'm pretty sure this is going to go through. This isn't a direct one to one link, but I think something like this is a necessary step to turning on the fee switch because the Uniswap foundation can have the best interest of the uni token holders at heart and the labs can't because of SEC regulations. So bullish.
01:07:30.190 - 01:07:38.158, Speaker B: We're trying to fix our governance tokens here right now. How about Maker Dow? This is pretty interesting news that happened last week as well.
01:07:38.244 - 01:07:50.530, Speaker A: Yeah. There's an HVB bank minted $25 million in a single transaction. So maker Dow really leaning into the real world asset, real world collateral, which I've always been bullish on, so congratulations to them.
01:07:50.600 - 01:07:53.060, Speaker B: I wonder if this week changed any of that.
01:07:55.850 - 01:07:58.390, Speaker A: Everyone tries to conflate these things, but it didn't.
01:07:59.450 - 01:08:06.022, Speaker B: It's interesting, though, if the US government goes agro on Defi, what the fallout will be?
01:08:06.076 - 01:08:27.486, Speaker A: I don't think that's where the US government isn't like a monolith. It's like, oh, the government's going to come from Dow. Like some specific agency has to get offended by this. And I don't think there is one. Plus, again, real world collateral is not like this centralized thing. It's also decentralized. It's just decentralized in meat space, not in crypto space.
01:08:27.588 - 01:08:30.286, Speaker B: You mean the fact that these banks could be from any jurisdiction in the world?
01:08:30.308 - 01:08:43.710, Speaker A: Any jurisdiction, yeah. And there's not one contract to rule them all. So if you shut down one contract, all the other ones are still standing. Right. So you have to go one by one by one and fight each one in court. It's a different level of different kind of decentralization.
01:08:43.790 - 01:08:55.910, Speaker B: The other thing I think that makes this bullish in going after real world assets is now you have hv bank that knows about Defi and is an advocate. Right. And it's also going to stand up and fight on the side of crypto big time in any battles that are.
01:08:55.980 - 01:09:00.242, Speaker A: See, you're getting it. You're getting it. Real world assets is so bullish.
01:09:00.386 - 01:09:09.738, Speaker B: It is. And I'm so glad we have all of these experiments playing out at once, because I think ethereum crypto is a very big tent. Some news from meta David, what are we looking at?
01:09:09.824 - 01:09:26.930, Speaker A: Instagram has rolled out its NFT support to a bunch of more countries. 100 more countries. And also the float blockchain. Instagram rolled out their NFT support forever ago. I haven't really seen anyone been using any of that, but maybe it's because we haven't had 100 more companies do stuff with it or countries do stuff with it.
01:09:27.000 - 01:09:46.642, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. It's a slower rollout, but we'll see. I think they've got some bigger things planned. David, do you remember all those bankruptcies? This is some news from the bankrupt crypto broker Voyager. They've just been approved to return $270,000,000 to their clients. So I guess if you're a depositor or maybe a debtor.
01:09:46.786 - 01:09:49.254, Speaker A: Like a customer? Yeah, like a normal customer, you're getting.
01:09:49.292 - 01:09:54.458, Speaker B: Some money back, maybe cents on the dollar. I don't think you're getting all your money back, but I don't know the details of this.
01:09:54.544 - 01:10:03.386, Speaker A: It specifically is returning $270,000,000 to affected customers. And so I think that means retail is getting this before other creditors or debtors or whatever.
01:10:03.488 - 01:10:15.762, Speaker B: I hope so. We'll see. But it's going to work its way out over the months to come, as we said. So we'll see more of this as they wind out. This is some news from immutable as well. And the GameStop partnership, what's happening here?
01:10:15.816 - 01:10:31.958, Speaker A: Yeah, we saw this coming from a mile away. But immutable X, the layer two, and also GameStop Wallet. The wallet are now integrated. So this whole immutable GameStop asset gaming ecosystem, it's moving pretty fast. We're liking what we're seeing here.
01:10:32.044 - 01:10:51.162, Speaker B: David. A tweet from Vitalik this week, some quick theory crafting. That's a great word, theory crafting how much data space we could save by improving compression. So this is Vitalik talking about compression of various ERC 20 tokens. And there's a lot of detail in this slide, but can you dumb it down for us? What are we looking at?
01:10:51.216 - 01:11:39.050, Speaker A: Yeah, basically there's a bunch of bars, and each bar is cut up into sections, and it's basically anatomy of a transaction. So you have the nonce, and how much data that consumes is like one section of the bigger bar. You have the priority fee, and how much data that is the gas and how much data that is the token address, and how much data that is the signature is a really big chunk of this overall data. And you can kind of just see the way that Ethereum scales is not necessarily like adding bigger blocks or shards or more block space. That is one way, but it's also by compressing all the transactions into a smaller packet of data. And so I just thought this visualization by Vitalik shows how much scalability there's left in Ethereum for just a normal ERC 20 transfer. So for the viewers on the YouTube, if you're looking at the top, that's where we are currently.
01:11:39.050 - 01:12:13.110, Speaker A: It's this bar that spans the whole entire page. And then at the ideal stateful compression, it goes to a much smaller bar. And so we're at 188 bytes currently for an ERC 20 transaction. And then the ideal stateful compression is 23 bytes. And so in the future, with all these optimations, how many times can you fit 23 into 188? Quick math is 8.2 times. And so with all of these compressions, which have nothing to do with the actual protocol of the blockchain, the actual block space of the blockchain, we can get eight times more scale in a basic ERC 20 transfer.
01:12:13.110 - 01:12:14.418, Speaker A: So I just like this visualization.
01:12:14.514 - 01:12:51.042, Speaker B: It's a great visualization, by the way, in that polennia episode, we talk about scalability in compression, right? And sorry, they think with the introduction of EIP 4844 plus compression, this is the compression that Polenia was talking about. We're going to get an 1000 x increase in roll up transaction throughputs and ethereum transaction throughput. So that's what all this leads to. And compression is an important part of that story. You know, it's another important part of the crypto story is the jobs market in crypto. Jobs market still going strong? David, this is our time to remind the bankless nation. To do what?
01:12:51.176 - 01:13:14.182, Speaker A: To get a job. And actually you should get a job at bankless, because bankless has more jobs on the job board. Look at that podcast editor. We're throwing out more podcast content, so we're going to need a third editor to add to the team. Also, if you know how to make defi tutorials on YouTube, if you're good at whatever those like Adobe that soul suite, and you can make good tutorials, we're definitely looking for that. Media operations. Also at bankless.
01:13:14.182 - 01:13:21.706, Speaker A: Bankless is hiring so many. God, we're hiring so much. Jesus, this is are. I'm reading off the jobs right now. That's not what I do.
01:13:21.808 - 01:13:26.090, Speaker B: Yeah, no, you're supposed to be dancing right now. So I get to dancing, sir. Boardroom labs.
01:13:26.170 - 01:13:28.042, Speaker A: If I read out the jobs, does that mean you dance?
01:13:28.106 - 01:13:42.030, Speaker B: No, it doesn't. It's not bi directional. All right, this is unidirectional arrangement here. Boardroom labs, they are. I better start this before I'm asked to dance again. Software engineer, Dao governance. Also manticore games manager of crypto marketing.
01:13:42.030 - 01:13:43.358, Speaker B: What is that, David?
01:13:43.534 - 01:13:44.718, Speaker A: Oh, non technical.
01:13:44.814 - 01:14:00.818, Speaker B: Thanks, bankless. We're also looking for a writer. Vertex protocol, a marketing coordinator. Still want a senior newsletter editor for Bankless streams? Financial analyst, bankless academy product manager. Wow. I guess it's all bankless jobs this week, but there are plenty of others. Actually, I shouldn't say that.
01:14:00.818 - 01:14:20.030, Speaker B: There's a head of marketing pleaserdao. The sandbox wants a biz dev manager on Juno Theorem foundation wants a front end developer. There's a ton more. Go to thebanklist palette.com Jobs URL to get access to those jobs and make sure you sign up to get these jobs via email. Guys, we got a lot more coming up. David, tell them what's coming up next.
01:14:20.100 - 01:14:29.346, Speaker A: Oh, we got the questions from the nation, how to get the Eth proof of work token. If you think that token is valuable. I do not think it will be, but if you do, we'll tell you how to get it.
01:14:29.368 - 01:14:30.466, Speaker B: You're going to get it anyway.
01:14:30.568 - 01:14:48.518, Speaker A: You're going to get it either way, whether it's worth zero pennies or whatnot. Also some bridge risk stuff. And of course the hot takes out of crypto Twitter. So in order to get some of that stuff, you got to go like and subscribe. You're going to get it anyways. But you should also like and subscribe anyways. And we'll be right back after we get through some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.
01:14:48.518 - 01:15:29.314, Speaker A: Arbitrum is an ethereum layer two scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs.

Download brave@brave.com slash bankless and click the wallet icon to get started.
01:16:34.496 - 01:17:05.982, Speaker B: Alright guys, we're back with some questions from the bankless nation. That's questions from you, and if you've got a question for the weekly roll up, make sure you follow bankless hq on Twitter. We post a request for questions once a week and you can get your question answered if you post there. Number one, from nobody. If there is a proof of work fork at the merge, will you receive the airdrop to a ledger wallet? I think that's a ledger wallet specifically wants to know if this user wants to know if they will receive a part of that token EtH PoW token. Will they, David?
01:17:06.126 - 01:17:28.202, Speaker A: Well, you will, absolutely, because a ledger wallet means that you have your own private keys. So it's actually less about the ledger and more about do you have your own private keys? And because you have a ledger, you have your own private keys. So the answer is absolutely yes. If you have your own private keys, then you will be able to access your ether on the proof of work chain. If you have that ether, though.
01:17:28.256 - 01:17:32.534, Speaker B: Okay, so what happens if you have your eth at somewhere like Coinbase?
01:17:32.662 - 01:17:58.134, Speaker A: Well, so that means you don't have your private keys, which means that is up to Coinbase. And historically Coinbase has honored forks and we've seen that happen before. That happened with bitcoin cash. So when bitcoin forked off into bitcoin and bitcoin cash, Coinbase gave all bitcoin holders their owed bitcoin cash. But blockchains fork many, many times. And so there have been other forks where Coinbase was like, that's too small of a fork. We don't care about that one.
01:17:58.134 - 01:18:19.430, Speaker A: So you didn't get those other mean. Coinbase hasn't really taken a position. But if there's enough of a movement behind the eth proof of work chain, you could see Coinbase listing that chain. Excuse me. And then they would give you your ETH proof of work token if they choose. But you're beholden to Coinbase. It's up to Coinbase because you trusted them with your keys.
01:18:19.510 - 01:18:24.010, Speaker B: I think some other exchanges have signaled that they would support a trading pair.
01:18:24.430 - 01:18:26.686, Speaker A: All the trash exchanges they will, but.
01:18:26.708 - 01:18:49.142, Speaker B: As long as someone does it, then you can sell. That's how that works. If you want to sell, you can sell. And by the way, that's taxable income. Apparently if you receive an airdrop, taxable income, taxable income for your airdrops, sell it quickly. Second question from Avigupta ETH. I don't even remember the bridge I use to transfer my funds to layer two.
01:18:49.142 - 01:18:57.634, Speaker B: But once funds reach l 02:00 a.m.. I, still exposed to bridge risk or just the risk of smart contract for l two? Once you bridge.
01:18:57.682 - 01:18:58.182, Speaker A: Great question.
01:18:58.236 - 01:19:02.950, Speaker B: It's a great question. Once you bridge, you still have the risk of the bridge on your assets lingering forever.
01:19:03.110 - 01:19:23.914, Speaker A: Yeah. Ryan, can you go to Bungie exchange real quick? Okay, so this is bungie Exchange. It's like a bridge aggregator plus also a Dex aggregator. So Ryan's got ethereum to optimism. He's got zero point 44 eth on one side on the Ethereum chain, and he's asking for 84.8 USDC on the optimism chain. And so here's all these bridges.
01:19:23.914 - 01:19:46.642, Speaker A: On the top one, this thing automatically selects the bridge that gives you the most value on the other side. And so that is currently hop for this current transfer. It tells you how much you're going to pay in gas, how long it's going to take. The next best bridge after that is the actual canonical optimism chain. Below that, you have Hyphen Bridge. Below that you have across. Below that you have multi chain bridge.
01:19:46.642 - 01:20:21.294, Speaker A: There's all these different bridges, so many different ways to get to optimism. Does the security of your assets on optimism depend on any of these bridges that you take over there? The answer is no. No, it does not. The only thing that matters is the canonical optimism bridge. Because once you get over to optimism, the only security dependency that you have is the actual canonical optimism bridge. And so once you have ether on optimism, the bridge that you use to get there can break. And you still have ether on optimism.
01:20:21.294 - 01:21:05.138, Speaker A: It's not beholden to that particular bridge. And this is only true for layer twos on Ethereum. This is not true for cross layer one bridges. If you are a cross layer one bridge, multi stake bridge to Ethereum to Solana, or Ethereum to avalanche, then you are beholden to whatever bridge that you use to get there. So you could bridge your ether from Ethereum to avalanche, and then you could trade that ether for the Avax token, and then you are no longer beholden to that bridge because you sold that risk off to somebody else. And so this is a really good, just like, lesson in just like, bridge risk for all layer twos. If you're on arbitrum and you have your arbitrum ether, you only are at risk of the canonical arbitrum bridge, not the bridge that you use to get there.
01:21:05.224 - 01:21:28.214, Speaker B: That's really cool, David. Yeah, good overview here. So you can cross with whatever janky bridge like you need to. It could be any bridge entirely. As long as the optimism bridge itself remains intact, you are fine. There is still bridge risk in that. The optimism bridge itself, the canonical bridge, could go down.
01:21:28.214 - 01:21:46.414, Speaker B: But if you cross over to the island on some bridge that looks like something like this, this janky sort of like, you've got holes in the middle of it, and it's just rope and, like, pieces of wood. As long as the main optimism bridge stays intact, all the other bridges could collapse. You will be fine.
01:21:46.612 - 01:22:07.038, Speaker A: Right, exactly. And there is bridge risk. So if you're using hop to go from Ethereum to optimism, there is bridge risk while your assets are like in flight, while they're out of your Ethereum wallet, and they have not yet landed in your optimism wallet. Yeah, 20 minutes or less. Usually it's less once it lands on optimism, then the only bridge that you have risk to is the actual canonical optimism bridge.
01:22:07.214 - 01:22:17.346, Speaker B: Very cool. Here's another question. If I stake 1 minute after the merge, am I allowed to unstake whenever I want, or am I subjected to the same waiting time to unstake of who staked before the merge?
01:22:17.458 - 01:22:34.746, Speaker A: You, sir, or yes, sir Matt, are beholden to the same wait times. Withdrawals are not enabled for anyone staking their ether for six to twelve months after the merge. So even after the merge happens, if you begin staking, then you are not able to withdraw, you are still stuck.
01:22:34.778 - 01:22:42.718, Speaker B: Like everyone else, six to twelve months. And then there will be some sort of software upgrade, a fork, and then everyone will be able to unstake at once.
01:22:42.804 - 01:22:47.550, Speaker A: But until that time, no, they will not be able to. There'll be a waiting period. There's a queue.
01:22:47.630 - 01:22:50.146, Speaker B: Yes, but everyone can start the process.
01:22:50.248 - 01:22:52.626, Speaker A: Everyone can enter the queue to unstake. Yes.
01:22:52.648 - 01:23:10.950, Speaker B: That's a good clarification. So we're all in the same boat together. We're all like staking until that next fork happens. Which, by the way, is pretty bullish for ETH price. One way ticket. Speaking of one way tickets, fam. All right, let's get to some takes of the week, takes of the week from Polenia coming to the podcast again on Monday.
01:23:10.950 - 01:23:14.682, Speaker B: But what is Polenia saying here? This is a governance post.
01:23:14.816 - 01:23:57.522, Speaker A: Yeah. So Polenia actually produces a governance post per optimism. This is one of the few governing things that Polenia does and says. They introduced a proposal to pause governance funding voting cycles until some level of optimism layer two, decentralization has been achieved. So what Polenia is really saying is that we should stop distributing the op token, stop doing rewards, stop doing governance proposals until optimism is more decentralized. And they cite regulatory risk as the one of the big reasons behind this. So they're just saying, hey, let's make sure the actual thing, optimism is more decentralized than it currently is before we start paying out op tokens as like reward incentives.
01:23:57.522 - 01:24:05.190, Speaker A: So kind of a contrarian take. But this is kind of why we appreciate plenia, because they are very, just clear and sober minded.
01:24:05.350 - 01:24:13.974, Speaker B: And Plenia being a good governor too. This is a pretty detailed post about this too. I think I am staking to Polenia on the optimist.
01:24:14.022 - 01:24:15.342, Speaker A: As am I. As am I.
01:24:15.476 - 01:24:23.550, Speaker B: Cool. This is a take from Ryan Anderson. He says the NFT space is like cavemen inventing the wheel and then only using it for roulette.
01:24:24.550 - 01:24:26.850, Speaker A: It is a valid use of a wheel.
01:24:27.270 - 01:24:34.660, Speaker B: Yes. Do you think there will be some non speculative NFT cases, use cases in the future in the next bull run?
01:24:35.350 - 01:24:37.570, Speaker A: I know the project that's working on right now. Ryan.
01:24:37.650 - 01:24:38.994, Speaker B: Utility NFTs, baby.
01:24:39.042 - 01:24:41.974, Speaker A: Yeah, utility nfts. I was like, token gated access.
01:24:42.172 - 01:24:45.170, Speaker B: Do you remember when icos were just basically speculative tools?
01:24:45.250 - 01:24:45.542, Speaker A: Right.
01:24:45.596 - 01:24:46.630, Speaker B: And like, not.
01:24:46.700 - 01:24:48.294, Speaker A: I remember when icos were the future.
01:24:48.412 - 01:24:59.658, Speaker B: Tokens were right. Like, tokens did nothing. They were completely stupid and useless in 2017. And it was only during the bear market. By the way, are we in a bear market still? Do we still say that?
01:24:59.744 - 01:25:00.666, Speaker A: I don't think so.
01:25:00.768 - 01:25:02.234, Speaker B: The bear market didn't last very long.
01:25:02.272 - 01:25:02.666, Speaker A: No.
01:25:02.768 - 01:25:07.918, Speaker B: We're trying to brand this thing the build market. And if we're already done, then I guess all that work is over.
01:25:08.084 - 01:25:14.286, Speaker A: Yeah, that's actually a good point. It'd be nice to have the bear market for a little bit longer just to really put a fire.
01:25:14.308 - 01:25:18.638, Speaker B: I don't think we're full bull yet. I think we'll crab for a while. I think emerge will be catalyst.
01:25:18.654 - 01:25:20.610, Speaker A: Yeah, crab between three and 2000.
01:25:20.760 - 01:25:30.626, Speaker B: The crab market doesn't sound well good though. It's either bull or bear. There's no in between. All right, this is another take. I can't read my own take.
01:25:30.728 - 01:25:31.006, Speaker A: Ryan.
01:25:31.038 - 01:25:32.726, Speaker B: Sean, classic take.
01:25:32.828 - 01:25:53.230, Speaker A: Ryan says, I hear bad people use the Internet. Let's just ban TCP IP and SSL and be done with it. And funk nine, Evan 9871. A funk is a backwards punk, they say. Especially SSL. Do you know what SSL stands for? Secure sockets layer is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client. Basically a website.
01:25:53.230 - 01:26:04.234, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Okay. And so funk 9871 says especially SSL. You can have military grade encrypted communication with servers. Scaredy face. Imagine what could be wired there. Pedophiles.
01:26:04.234 - 01:26:15.380, Speaker A: Instructions for bomb building, conspiracy theories, hate speech. We need to censor this. Yeah. Also your transaction and credit card data. Let's make sure that stays open for all of the Internet to watch. No, thanks.
01:26:15.990 - 01:26:39.194, Speaker B: Exactly the point. So it's like, what do we do? You just ban everything? I mean, we need privacy. We're going to have digital crypto technology, by the way, what does this say for the central bank digital currency? Right. Do you think treasury is going to want to enable privacy by default on that thing, the central bank digital currency? No, no, they're not going to give you privacy. They're going to want to backdoor into everything.
01:26:39.312 - 01:26:47.454, Speaker A: This is why in a CBDC, there would also never be like a public, accessible virtual machine. Because then you could build tornado cash on it.
01:26:47.572 - 01:26:56.174, Speaker B: Exactly right. So they're going to hamstring the whole thing, which is, I guess, the bullcase for crypto. But I guess your take is, David, it's all going to work out okay. Right?
01:26:56.212 - 01:26:56.946, Speaker A: It's all going to work out.
01:26:56.968 - 01:26:57.154, Speaker B: Okay.
01:26:57.192 - 01:27:02.290, Speaker A: Have faith. All right, this one's great. You zoom out a little bit.
01:27:02.360 - 01:27:04.142, Speaker B: Is this the meme of the week? No, we're not in the meme.
01:27:04.206 - 01:27:24.406, Speaker A: No. Well, we had two memes of the week, and this is the one that we put in the take section. The tweet says inflation is down 0.2% to 8.5%. 2nd worst recorded inflation ever. And then the picture goes crypto mfers. And then it's the picture of the hangover and they're all gambling at the roulette table.
01:27:24.406 - 01:27:27.430, Speaker A: Inflation is down. .2% let's go to the casino.
01:27:27.590 - 01:27:39.600, Speaker B: I'm surprised the market reacted so bullishly to this spec. Tiny, tiny micro speck of good news, but such is the market. All right, David, close us out, man. What are you bullish on this week?
01:27:40.210 - 01:27:57.654, Speaker A: Can I really say anything other than Ethereum right now? We just scheduled the merge. Okay, so this is something I always think is super ironic. In 2017, that bull market got the Ethereum. Bull market was partially catalyzed by everyone wanting to buy ether so they could stake it. And that was me. I was like, oh, I got to get as much ether as I can get.
01:27:57.692 - 01:27:58.546, Speaker B: Passive income, baby.
01:27:58.578 - 01:28:21.818, Speaker A: Yeah, passive income. Because they're going to go to proof of stake in 2018. And then 2018 came and the roadmap just was not defined. And then we went into a bear market and then DFI summer hit and I was like, oh, yeah, proof of stake by the end of 2020. Oh, my God, I've got to get as much ether as I can so I can stake it at the end of 2020. And then that came and went. And then now we're into the last part of 2022 and we actually have it scheduled.
01:28:21.914 - 01:28:24.062, Speaker B: That's real this time, actually having.
01:28:24.196 - 01:28:35.790, Speaker A: So instead of being the catalyst for a bull market that's actually happening right now. It's a catalyst for a bull market. That is completely proof of, like ethereum proof of stake being driven right now so far.
01:28:35.940 - 01:28:39.762, Speaker B: No. To be fair though, David, you could stake when the beacon chain went live.
01:28:39.816 - 01:28:40.274, Speaker A: True.
01:28:40.392 - 01:28:45.854, Speaker B: Right. Which is a long time ago. But have you been waiting with bulk of your Eth for kind of the merge?
01:28:45.902 - 01:28:49.074, Speaker A: No, the bulk of my Eth is not on the beacon chain.
01:28:49.122 - 01:28:55.670, Speaker B: Are you going to start staking like post merge? Is that your catalyst, or are you going to wait for the next fork where you can actually withdraw?
01:28:57.530 - 01:29:00.466, Speaker A: That's a really good question. I have not seriously considered.
01:29:00.498 - 01:29:07.850, Speaker B: You haven't thought about what you're going to stake or how much. You know what we need, David, do you remember that episode we did on how much eth can you retire on a long time ago?
01:29:07.920 - 01:29:17.626, Speaker A: Right. How much was that? I think it was just like a little over 100 ETH to get a $60,000, a $60,000 a year salary off of 100 Eth.
01:29:17.658 - 01:29:24.674, Speaker B: This was before we had two years of like 20% each year. Inflation, but. Or massive inflation, maybe that was also.
01:29:24.712 - 01:29:28.130, Speaker A: Assuming a $5,000 Eth price as well, but we'll get there too.
01:29:28.200 - 01:29:32.254, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. Anyway, the conversation is back, baby.
01:29:32.302 - 01:29:46.242, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so the merge is scheduled. Inflation down. Hopefully that continues. L two tokens are up. Fee tokens are up. Like, not only is Eth bullish and proof of stake bullish, but tokens are also bullish.
01:29:46.242 - 01:29:57.740, Speaker A: Tokens are having a great moment right now, so people are feeling good about stuff, and I'm hoping, Ryan, that that makes people feel better about stuff in the future.
01:30:00.130 - 01:30:04.382, Speaker B: There's a picture for you. Which of these people are you?
01:30:04.436 - 01:30:06.750, Speaker A: Okay, the one missing the tooth.
01:30:07.730 - 01:30:12.846, Speaker B: I'm showing the hangover picture again. That's it. That's us right now.
01:30:12.948 - 01:30:17.134, Speaker A: Which tokens have I put my bets on? Ryan, what are you both on?
01:30:17.332 - 01:30:55.162, Speaker B: I was listening to the blodgie episode again, the episode that came out this Monday, the one on nations. And then in the backdrop of an actual nation state banning a privacy protocol, banning code, banning, effectively speech, it went back to like, what am I bullish on? Nations. And the way Belagi defined it is nation is different than a nation state. Nation is a community. It's a tribe of people. The Wikipedia definition is community of people formed on the basis of combination of shared features such as language, history, culture, territory, belief. Nations.
01:30:55.162 - 01:31:29.494, Speaker B: What are nations? They are communities. That is not the nation state. But I feel like the nation state has kind of conflated those two together and they want the word nations to actually mean this nation state. Type thing. And it's different because we can have these things that are Internet nations, digital nations. And I think this unlocks something big for communities, for societies, for groups of individual with shared beliefs. And this opens up an avenue for humans coordinating outside of the nation state.
01:31:29.494 - 01:31:37.578, Speaker B: At first, the nation states are, I think, going to feel a little threatened by this. We're starting to see some of that feeling threatened. We don't know what to do with this new thing.
01:31:37.744 - 01:31:40.002, Speaker A: You're not a nation. You don't have a flag.
01:31:40.086 - 01:32:13.266, Speaker B: You don't have rights. You're creating your own money. That's not real money. It's fake Internet money. It'll take time, but the things that we will build in this new digital nation, Internet nation will be different than the nation state, and I think will be complementary to it over time. And I can't wait to start unlocking some of those new things. Blaggy said in our episode, he was like, the 2010s, we discovered Internet money, the discovering Internet nations.
01:32:13.266 - 01:32:42.638, Speaker B: And I think that is a big thing. We're going to define and uncover and start to see use cases for this decade. People have a hard time think, imagining this right now in the same way that it's very difficult to imagine a crypto Internet money back in 2011. You have to have, like, a big, broad imagination. But I think that's it, man. We're in the process of defining. What I love going back to is you remember Blaschi was talking about sometimes you have to go back in order to go forward.
01:32:42.724 - 01:32:43.166, Speaker A: Right.
01:32:43.268 - 01:32:55.778, Speaker B: I find myself being very attracted to some of the founding principles of nation states. Right. You go back to kind of like the federalist papers and the United States constitution. And those are the base principles for.
01:32:55.864 - 01:32:56.466, Speaker A: They got it right.
01:32:56.488 - 01:33:17.590, Speaker B: Humans want to live. They got that right. And they built a protocol called a state around that. And that's cool. But like some of these base principles, we can manifest the core base principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in Internet protocols. And what does that look like? Anyway? I think we're in this new era of nation builders.
01:33:17.670 - 01:33:25.146, Speaker A: Yeah. I think you're saying you're bullish on nations without states. Nations without states.
01:33:25.328 - 01:33:31.098, Speaker B: Very careful not to say nation states. I'm bullish just on nations, specifically Internet nations.
01:33:31.194 - 01:33:31.550, Speaker A: Right.
01:33:31.620 - 01:33:33.614, Speaker B: That is bullish on small communities of people.
01:33:33.732 - 01:33:37.010, Speaker A: Yeah. I think that means you're bullish on discord channels.
01:33:37.350 - 01:33:40.174, Speaker B: Yes. Discord channels. Discord channels.
01:33:40.222 - 01:33:45.058, Speaker A: I mean, I thought I was Bullish on tokens. I think you just said what I meant in a different way.
01:33:45.144 - 01:33:49.074, Speaker B: Yes. Well, you're bullish on their assets. All right, I'm bullish on the abstract.
01:33:49.122 - 01:33:51.670, Speaker A: Ideas, but they do have tokens.
01:33:52.330 - 01:33:59.354, Speaker B: I think Bellagi just nailed. I just. It's a good episode anyway. But what do we got for meme of the week?
01:33:59.392 - 01:34:00.842, Speaker A: Meme of the week? Let's do it.
01:34:00.976 - 01:34:06.902, Speaker B: Let's cook it up. I am sharing a picture of trains and Godzilla.
01:34:06.966 - 01:34:12.454, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is my. The reason why I love this train. Godzilla. Where'd you get Godzilla? It's blurred.
01:34:12.502 - 01:34:13.610, Speaker B: What is that thing on the track?
01:34:13.680 - 01:34:16.654, Speaker A: Those things that end the train from going off the track?
01:34:16.772 - 01:34:20.014, Speaker B: What? That's not like a Balrog or a winged beast thing?
01:34:20.132 - 01:34:51.114, Speaker A: What are you looking at? Did you watch a bunch of Lord of the Rings with your kids on a barrier? It's like a wooden barrier because that's the end of the train track. Okay, this is a back to the future movie where they go back and is this back to the future number one? I think it might be maybe number two. I can't remember. Anyways, this is when they have to get their car up to 88 miles an hour using a train back to the future three. That's back to the future three. Okay, so then they get the DeLorean up to 88 miles an hour. And so then it disappears and goes back to the future.
01:34:51.114 - 01:35:19.006, Speaker A: And that is the merge. The merge is when the ethereum chain disappears from the proof of the big, slow, chunky proof of work train, and then it disappears. And then it goes to the proof of stake chain, which is the future. And then the proof of work train literally goes off of the track and crashes and burns. And this is why I've been calling the Defi ecosystem on. The proof of work chain is dividing by zero. Once the ethereum chain leaves proof of work and goes to proof of stake, the proof of work chain crashes.
01:35:19.006 - 01:35:24.130, Speaker A: It goes off the bridge. It dies. And this is a great meme that encapsulates this.
01:35:24.200 - 01:35:33.554, Speaker B: There you go. It's back to the future. Nothing to do with dragons or Lord of the Rings or whatever else I said, but this does look like it's from a video game. Am I right about this? Are these actual scenes from a movie?
01:35:33.602 - 01:35:34.838, Speaker A: 80S animation, bro.
