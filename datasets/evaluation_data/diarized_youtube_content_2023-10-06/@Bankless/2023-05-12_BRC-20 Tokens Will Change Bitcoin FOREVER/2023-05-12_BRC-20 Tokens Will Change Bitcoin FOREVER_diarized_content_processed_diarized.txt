00:00:00.090 - 00:00:07.390, Speaker A: Bitcoin culture has shifted. The balance of power is shifting from the bitcoin fundamentalists to the bitcoin builders.
00:00:09.970 - 00:00:15.530, Speaker B: Bankless nation. It is the second Friday of May. I hope you're ready. For what, David?
00:00:15.690 - 00:00:26.802, Speaker A: The bankless Friday weekly roll up where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto. Say it with me, which is always an ambitious endeavor. I almost forgot that line. Yet we veer nonetheless into the frontier.
00:00:26.866 - 00:00:29.862, Speaker B: I'm trying to make that a thing. David wants to make that a thing.
00:00:29.916 - 00:00:32.086, Speaker A: Always been ambitious people endeavor, but we.
00:00:32.108 - 00:00:40.838, Speaker B: Persevere into the frontier. Yeah. Nonetheless, topics of the week, we got meme coin season. I've been sleeping on this one, David, but you tell me why it's important.
00:00:41.004 - 00:01:14.894, Speaker A: Oh, I'm not sure if I'm the man to do that, but I will anyways. Crypto. Can we not find product market fit? Well, let's just go back to trading memes. That was week that meme was so powerful that even bitcoin caught the shitcoin bug this week, leading to a change in the balance of power in bitcoin culture, which is actually a more significant topic that I do care about. Yeah. And then lastly of the big news of the week, even though there's so much more than this, brad Sherman has a hot take for crypto. Did you see this one, Ryan?
00:01:15.022 - 00:01:37.894, Speaker B: I did, and you're going to love it. Bankless Nation. It's a perfect sound bite to encapsulate what's going on in our halls of congress these days when they talk about this silly thing called crypto. And we're going to get right to it, guys. But before we do, we want to tell you about our friends and sponsors over at Swell. This is a decentralized staking network specializing in the staking of ETH. David, tell them about swell.
00:01:38.022 - 00:02:21.110, Speaker A: Swell is a liquid staking provider. We know what these things are, the LSD sector. But Swell is what would you do if you built a LSD provider in the year 2023. So not only is it a brand new dow to spin up to build a brand new staking protocol, but it also hooks more natively into DFIs doubling up where you can get sources of yield from. And so if you are interested in getting some extra both DeFi yield along with your estaking yield, swell is the place for you in their roadmap. They have the thing that really gets me going, which is DVT aka squad staking as well. And they want you to know that they have a voyage towards decentralization, which is starting soon.
00:02:21.110 - 00:02:28.266, Speaker A: TM so app Swellnetwork IO slash voyage or the link in the show notes if you just want to go click to get started.
00:02:28.368 - 00:02:50.658, Speaker B: Yeah, and one of my favorite things about this, David, is there is 0% fees for stakers who stake now. And of course, gas fees being high just means stakers get more rewards. So yield goes up. Good time to be staking these days. All right, David, tell me about a good time or a bad time in the markets. Let's get to the price of bitcoin this week.
00:02:50.824 - 00:03:11.046, Speaker A: We are experiencing, Ryan, as we recorded the saddest time of the week. So far this week prices are the lowest at the time of recording thursday morning eastern time. Bitcoin is at the low, low price of $27,200. Started the week at $29,400. We are down 7.5%. Not a great week.
00:03:11.228 - 00:03:14.394, Speaker B: We lost all of our May gains. We're back to April 23.
00:03:14.512 - 00:03:16.042, Speaker A: We're back to April. Yeah.
00:03:16.176 - 00:03:21.498, Speaker B: I'm looking at this on the Kraken pro charts, of course. How about ETH Price? Is that a similar story or any good news here?
00:03:21.584 - 00:03:25.994, Speaker A: Down exactly 7.5%, just like daddy bitcoin.
00:03:26.042 - 00:03:26.206, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:26.228 - 00:03:29.166, Speaker A: So it started at 1950, currently at 1810.
00:03:29.348 - 00:03:41.506, Speaker B: Well, you know, I'm going to ask you what's going on, and I think you've got some analysis here coming up, David, because I want your take on this take on the charts. But before we get there, bitcoin ratio ETH. The ratio ratio flat. No news there.
00:03:41.608 - 00:04:05.802, Speaker A: How about crypto market cap 1.16 down to 1.1 does not feel great. I remember a couple of weeks ago, three or four weeks ago, you were like, I'm ready to start to be ready to wave the white flag on triple digit ETH. And I was like, hold on, this could be the middle of the year top so far, the middle of the year top thesis is correct for three weeks in a row. Yeah. This one.
00:04:05.856 - 00:04:07.050, Speaker B: Are you getting nervous?
00:04:09.470 - 00:04:19.326, Speaker A: Okay. Are you asking me do I feel emotionally nervous? Like, almost never, no. Are there reasons to be concerned? Yeah, there are reasons to be concerned. Yeah.
00:04:19.428 - 00:04:19.742, Speaker B: Okay.
00:04:19.796 - 00:04:25.918, Speaker A: I'm trying to separate like, I'm never nervous, so if you ask me if I'm nervous, the answer is going to be no.
00:04:26.004 - 00:04:26.914, Speaker B: However, different question.
00:04:26.952 - 00:04:30.654, Speaker A: If I put on my short term hat, it's like, yeah, there's reasons to be concerned.
00:04:30.782 - 00:04:34.500, Speaker B: What's the probability that we get to that triple digit ETH again?
00:04:35.430 - 00:04:47.542, Speaker A: Well, as we've gotten so far as a 7.5% lower this week has increased that probability by a comparable amount. I don't know how to answer that question. But, I mean, we're getting there. Yeah.
00:04:47.596 - 00:05:02.410, Speaker B: I mean, it's interesting because I was like 60% earlier that it could happen again, that we'd revisit triple digit and then that kind of decreased, I think, with the beginning of this year, and we haven't seen the hit.
00:05:02.480 - 00:05:03.946, Speaker A: We've gotten further away from it.
00:05:03.968 - 00:05:24.978, Speaker B: Right. But this is also the thing I was most worried about is the kind of that apathy season of the market. What's interesting is we'll talk about this later. We're going to talk about meme coins and whether that's just injecting new blood or whether that's injecting recycled capital. Maybe we should talk about that in a minute. But this number to me is interesting. We're still above a trillion even despite this.
00:05:24.978 - 00:05:27.138, Speaker B: And Brad Sherman hates that number.
00:05:27.304 - 00:05:28.066, Speaker A: We'll get to that.
00:05:28.088 - 00:05:36.838, Speaker B: He actually named a trillion dollars in the video quote they're going to play a little bit later. But tell me about the market news. Okay. David, why are prices down?
00:05:37.004 - 00:05:51.578, Speaker A: Prices are down because liquidity oh, first before we get there. Ryan happy one year anniversary to the Terra Luna crash. Deploying more capital. Steady, lads. That famous tweet that got tweeted out by Doe Kwan, that was one year ago this week. So happy anniversary to those who I.
00:05:51.584 - 00:05:56.526, Speaker B: Do not celebrate this. You don't celebrate this anniversary. It's not a holiday in my well.
00:05:56.548 - 00:06:22.866, Speaker A: Either way, anniversary nonetheless. Okay, so the big reason as to what is going on in the market this week is that the idea has circulated that both Jump and Jane Street, which are big market makers, have scaled back their market making operations in the crypto world. And so here is a tweet that went viral and it's showing a binance order book liquidity. And you can just see the thinness of the order book in the narrow spreads.
00:06:22.898 - 00:06:23.046, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:23.068 - 00:07:03.758, Speaker A: So what we're looking at are very narrow snapshots of both bitcoin price a long time ago in January of this year, so not that long ago versus now. And so the order books are thin. It doesn't take as much money to move the markets. And we all have learned the lesson that when you pull liquidity out of the markets, asset prices go down. And so Jump and Jane Street very big players have been alleged. I don't think we've seen a confirmation of this, but they are scaling back their market making operations as a result of regulatory fears. And so when liquidity exits the markets, it's easier to push price down, it's easier to be fearful.
00:07:03.758 - 00:07:20.826, Speaker A: And they also are having their own sell pressure. Lack of liquidity is bearish. And so that is the thing that has happened. That's why the market seems to have entered a new phase lately. The market's behaving differently and people are speculating that it's because liquidity has been.
00:07:20.848 - 00:07:26.694, Speaker B: Pulled out and behaving differently in that it's like more volatile or more like little bumps in the night send it spiraling.
00:07:26.742 - 00:07:44.974, Speaker A: And positive emphasis towards the downside, no momentum towards the upside. Any positive price action just immediately gets sold off. There was a phase change in the market and it happened recently. And people are crediting the exiting of market makers to this.
00:07:45.172 - 00:07:50.114, Speaker B: Interesting, this may be the apathy market I was talking about earlier. What is this showing us here?
00:07:50.232 - 00:08:39.774, Speaker A: Yeah, so this is a graph of liquidity in the market, which is the blue line. And you can see some events that have happened recently. So the Silver Gate Bank failure was followed by a large decline in liquidity of binance in binance bitcoin to United to bitcoin to tether liquidity, then followed by the binance CFTC charge and then also a binance bot fees increase is what's indicated here. But really it was the Silvergate Bank. So this is largely TradFi the crypto banks, as who called them, gary Gensler called them the crypto banks. Even though we use crypto banks to call like Coinbase and Kraken, the Trad banks that service crypto customers all crash and went under. And so these are the banking providers that also provide banking services to market makers.
00:08:39.774 - 00:08:56.760, Speaker A: And so it's harder to market make in crypto these days. So liquidity is drying out of the system. And so I tweet out this tweet. Everyone knows who is a bankless listener. Everyone knows that I'm a huge fan of SpongeBob. Bigger fan of SpongeBob than you are, bankless listener. And so this is the water, sandy water.
00:08:56.760 - 00:09:01.930, Speaker A: He needs water. Like crypto markets. We need water, we need liquidity, otherwise we're bearish.
00:09:02.270 - 00:09:04.822, Speaker B: So the state of the crypto markets right now is dry.
00:09:04.886 - 00:09:05.494, Speaker A: Dry.
00:09:05.622 - 00:09:17.566, Speaker B: We have no liquidity. We are bone dry right now, which does not bode well for price. Right. There's not a lot of buyers stepping in under this one. 7000 hundred dollars ETH price, right? Yeah.
00:09:17.588 - 00:09:40.626, Speaker A: If you scroll down, I give a little bit of an autopsy. Right? And so one year ago, Terra blew up $50,000,000,000.06. Months ago, FTX blew up $15 billion. Alameda, a market maker, ceased operations one month ago. Three crypto bank fails this last week. The largest bank failure since 2008. Regional banks which do offer services to the crypto industry are getting slammered.
00:09:40.626 - 00:10:02.686, Speaker A: Meanwhile, the Operation Choke .2.0 choke point, they're choking liquidity. Gary Gensler is pointing a gun at us. And what I'm saying is like, we don't get bullishness until liquidity returns. And then the crazy thing, Ryan, is somehow in the midst of all of this fucking Pepe Coin gets to $1.5 billion.
00:10:02.788 - 00:10:30.694, Speaker B: That's all inside money. That's not outside money, that's not new buyers, that's all playing around. We'll talk about that in a minute. But okay, I think this is actually a big story, David. I think this is a theme of the Apathy market. It's just bone dry. And I think this is probably something we'll be talking about a lot over the coming weeks and months is when is the liquidity going to come back and how does it come back? Where are the net new buyers of our crypto assets? That's the big question right now.
00:10:30.694 - 00:10:53.120, Speaker B: And I think that is the appropriate question at this stage of the market. Where the worst news? All of the kind of the impact of SBF and Alameda and Terra and Celsius and 3 hours capital, that's all hit us and now we're on the other side of that and we're just like, well, we still don't have the use cases to attract new buyers, so it's quiet. That's what's going on.
00:10:53.730 - 00:11:02.430, Speaker A: The trillions of dollars of latent capital that's still out there, which we need. And we are doing Pepe Coin.
00:11:04.210 - 00:11:08.274, Speaker B: You mean they're not buying this stuff? No, somebody they're looking at us like.
00:11:08.312 - 00:11:22.530, Speaker A: Oh, the cryptocurrency industry was needed to professionalize and come into the light and provide good products and services. They just created PepeCoin and Elon Musk is tweeting out about know Gary Gensler's like, excellent.
00:11:22.610 - 00:11:32.290, Speaker B: This is exactly what I wanted to see. He's loving this right now. Well, let's talk about a good side of the equation, which is holders are still holding.
00:11:32.370 - 00:11:33.106, Speaker A: Holders are holding.
00:11:33.148 - 00:11:48.030, Speaker B: I feel that very strongly. Right. We don't have new buyers. We don't have new liquidity entering the market. We have some indications we're still here. And what are we doing? We're staking. What are you looking at on the screen here? What's the story around ETH staking in the numbers.
00:11:48.100 - 00:11:57.550, Speaker A: Here the story around ETH. Staking. Ron, I'm so glad you brought this up. Glad you asked. We are at an all time high. An amount of ETH are staked to Ethereum.
00:11:57.710 - 00:11:58.674, Speaker B: That is awesome.
00:11:58.792 - 00:12:02.754, Speaker A: That is awesome. How long did it take? Less than one month of time.
00:12:02.872 - 00:12:25.814, Speaker B: Less than a month. Remember they told us when withdrawals were enabled, it was going to just, like, crater. All of this staked ETH was going to drain out of the system and we would totally crater. And less than a month later, we're already at all time highs of staked ETH. So that means inflows has exceeded outflows. I was not expecting this so quickly. I thought we'd have a more sustained dip.
00:12:25.814 - 00:12:34.380, Speaker B: I mean, I was bullish, but I wasn't like, if you told me, like, within 30 days we'll be at all time highs again, I've been like, I mean, three months, maybe I could see that.
00:12:34.930 - 00:12:58.950, Speaker A: I wouldn't gamble a significant amount of money that we will be at all time highs inside of one month. So, yes, this is a bullish outcome of this. The general ethereum community member thought leader take was that this is not a bearish event. Yes, there will be a net outflow, but the gap will quickly be covered by net new inflow because of the risk off. That was the Ethereum consensus.
00:13:00.650 - 00:13:02.198, Speaker B: By the way. That's what you said.
00:13:02.284 - 00:13:03.190, Speaker A: That's what I said.
00:13:03.260 - 00:13:06.822, Speaker B: With Jordy Alexander. Okay, David, if the bank will please.
00:13:06.876 - 00:13:14.778, Speaker A: Go back to the Jordy Alexander David Hoffman debate and look at who and who made what points. I'm sorry.
00:13:14.944 - 00:13:29.214, Speaker B: You said you weren't going to victory lap. I was supposed to victory lap for you. Okay. David won that debate. I think Jordy Alexander, the evidence is Jordy Alexander took down Terra Luna terra Luna in his debate single handedly while.
00:13:29.252 - 00:13:32.618, Speaker A: Everyone else thought that he got smashed because they were all lunatics.
00:13:32.714 - 00:13:38.430, Speaker B: Yes, but then you did a debate with Jordy on whether the ETH withdrawals would be bullish or bearish.
00:13:38.510 - 00:13:38.802, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:38.856 - 00:13:46.802, Speaker B: And Jordy's thesis, a lot of ETH would actually drain out of the system. I think David wins this. So I'm going to do the victory laugh for you.
00:13:46.856 - 00:13:58.098, Speaker A: I'll give a point to Jordy, which is like the price of ETH currently is marginally lower than at the time of the debate. But I'll say all of ether price action is completely related to exogenous factors.
00:13:58.274 - 00:13:59.320, Speaker B: There you go.
00:14:00.730 - 00:14:35.602, Speaker A: But this is the point I want to make. All the internal points about the Ethereum network and about Ethereum fundamentals. The Ethereum community has been right on the right side of history. Every single incident of drama about Ethereum remember ETH proof of work. Remember the ETH overhang and dump into the market fear mongerers. I don't know. Every time any Ethereum event has caused drama, the people about Ethereum who know about Ethereum have always been right almost every single time.
00:14:35.736 - 00:14:51.178, Speaker B: There it is, folks. There's the victory lap. But honestly, that's kind of right here's. Superfizz here saying in 2020, the beacon chain launched. That was December 2020, 2022. September. Proof of stake replaced proof of work.
00:14:51.178 - 00:15:08.874, Speaker B: The merge. Then in April of 2023, withdrawals from Staking were enabled. And now those who wish to withdraw completed the action. That happened on May 7. That's when the withdrawal queue was emptied with flash. We started to see inflow flows again. Pretty impressive to see it laid out in this timeline.
00:15:08.874 - 00:15:23.186, Speaker B: Here's another ETH bull, Anthony Sasano saying there are now more active, validators live on the Ethereum network than there were before staking withdrawals were enabled. It took less than a month for this to happen. ETH staking is up only all time.
00:15:23.288 - 00:15:30.306, Speaker A: Give that one a like. Let's give that one a like. Anthony Cesano, one of the also perpetually correct about Ethereum.
00:15:30.498 - 00:15:33.126, Speaker B: Perpetually correct about ethereum. He'd love that you just said that.
00:15:33.148 - 00:15:36.920, Speaker A: Right now he does another chart to convince him.
00:15:39.690 - 00:15:48.182, Speaker B: Let's zoom out. Kraken actually put out a great report this week on kind of the overall state of staking. Of course, Ethereum isn't the only proof of stake network.
00:15:48.246 - 00:15:53.146, Speaker A: Did you know this report is about staking staking in general industry.
00:15:53.338 - 00:16:07.570, Speaker B: So some stats that I found interesting. $288,000,000,000 is the market cap of the top 35 proof of stake assets. So that's growing. 49% quarter on quarter the value of stake.
00:16:08.070 - 00:16:15.278, Speaker A: Just for context, 288,000,000,000 is the total market cap. 220,000,000,000 of that is Ethereum.
00:16:15.454 - 00:16:18.106, Speaker B: Oh, okay. Well, there you go. A lot is ETH.
00:16:18.158 - 00:16:20.518, Speaker A: I just want to make sure Ethereum gets its credit, right?
00:16:20.684 - 00:16:42.250, Speaker B: Yeah. Bankless listeners know we don't give Ethereum enough credit around here. $68 billion the value of staked assets. 5 billion annualized staking rewards. That's a pretty big industry at this point, right? The value of all large is 5 billion. That's 23% proof of stake is 23% of the total crypto market cap. I imagine that's largely ETH.
00:16:42.250 - 00:16:56.286, Speaker B: Here's one thing that's interesting. The average yield is 11.6%. And of course, Ethereum that way downward. So other proof of stake networks are rewarding are distributing a lot more of their supply than Ether.
00:16:56.398 - 00:16:57.570, Speaker A: Higher issuance.
00:16:57.910 - 00:16:59.330, Speaker B: I think there's reasons for that.
00:16:59.400 - 00:17:00.606, Speaker A: Higher inflation.
00:17:00.798 - 00:17:11.142, Speaker B: Yeah, you could tell we're coming off of Justin Drake Monday episode, too, right? Because we got some bullish takes on. Let's switch, though, to the conversation, actually. Okay.
00:17:11.196 - 00:17:16.946, Speaker A: Ryan, what do you think in the last seven days? What do you think was the staking.
00:17:16.978 - 00:17:21.942, Speaker B: Reward for ether in the last seven days? Are you talking about like annualized percentage?
00:17:22.006 - 00:17:24.102, Speaker A: Yes, annualized percentage?
00:17:24.166 - 00:17:26.300, Speaker B: Yeah. Plus 4.5.
00:17:26.910 - 00:17:28.726, Speaker A: No, that was just from issuance.
00:17:28.918 - 00:17:32.374, Speaker B: That's just issuance. Okay. You're talking about transaction fees and mev.
00:17:32.502 - 00:17:43.166, Speaker A: 3.8% APY from Issuance. If you get add on the tips and also the mev, you come up to 6.6% on your ETH. It has been a great time to.
00:17:43.188 - 00:18:15.850, Speaker B: Be a validator yeah, that's definitely good. That yield generated in ETH denominated returns is always quite nice. David, this is a question, I think that came off of our market section last week, asking about I mean, we're critical from time to time on the Fed, on Jerome Powell, on interest rates. Here's a question from Steve F. Dot, I missed the cutoff this week, but my question for Team Bankless for next weekly roll up is the following, and I asked this with due respect for you guys. Thanks, Steve. You don't have to respect us, though.
00:18:15.850 - 00:18:38.900, Speaker B: Since Bankless consistently criticizes the federal interest rate policy fairly and is calling for a pivot, what terminal interest do you think the Federal Reserve should settle on? So this listener is calling us out, David, and if you're going to criticize the interest rate, you have to say what you think it should be. You have to say why. What's your response to this?
00:18:39.910 - 00:18:58.306, Speaker A: My response is like the only reason why I'm not calling for a pivot, except my portfolio is as a human person who's living in an economy and lives in a society, I am not calling for a pivot. My portfolio would love a pivot.
00:18:58.338 - 00:19:01.654, Speaker B: Two. Davids, he wants a pivot for his bags.
00:19:01.702 - 00:19:30.610, Speaker A: Yeah, my bags want to pivot. What is the appropriate interest rate? No clue. God. I do not want anyone's job inside of the Federal Reserve. I do not want Powell's job. I don't have an opinion on this matter. And so I apologize for Bankless listeners if we have given off the air of like we think that we are right about interest rates and that we want to we're this is an industry and all you guys also have risk on crypto assets, so don't pretend that you also don't want to pivot.
00:19:32.230 - 00:19:54.746, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess I would zoom out, though, and I would say I agree with that. I'm glad you clarified. Right. So a pivot is good for crypto bags. Is it good for society, is kind of a different question. But here's where I'd zoom out and I do have some criticism for the Fed that I think is more fair over the long run. As you said, David, no one really knows what the real interest rate should be.
00:19:54.746 - 00:20:36.674, Speaker B: No one. Not even maybe God knows. Maybe God knows, right? This was a point that was made by Edward Chancellor in our recording. By the way, guys, there is an episode coming out with financial historian Edward Chancellor. It's coming out, I think, on Monday. And if you want the more nuanced, non bag, biased take on the Fed and what they should be doing, what they should have done rather than what they are doing, listen, that take but he makes the point that no one knows the real interest rate. Of course that a hypothetical real interest rate exists, but the best tool we have of finding out what the real interest rate is is free markets.
00:20:36.674 - 00:21:06.878, Speaker B: And we're in this mess because central bankers have distorted free markets so badly for so long, and they've pretended that it's all okay. And so, I don't know. Neither did Edward Chancellor know what the actual rate should be? Maybe God does. No human alive on Earth, no AI on Earth knows this. But we do know that the rates, the fake rates over the last ten years were dumb. Like, real dumb. I mean, negative.
00:21:06.878 - 00:21:28.434, Speaker B: We went negative close to 0% in the US. So if I'm powell, I don't know if I can fix this. And there's an element of Powell, I think you made this point last week where he's just a wheel in the cog, right? This is the wheel of history. What else can he do? He's got the hand that he's been dealt.
00:21:28.482 - 00:21:31.658, Speaker A: He's got to outside of the system, he's inside the system.
00:21:31.744 - 00:22:18.678, Speaker B: So the criticism, though, is the system and the way it's been managed. And the fix, I think we're pretty much more certain on this. The fix is individuals need an escape hatch, an alternative store of value. Like, why would you put your money in treasuries? Why would you put your money in the dollar? Right? So for the individual, I'm like, well, crypto is a great escape hatch for that. And I think as a collective, we need a check on this central banker power. As a collective, we also need crypto, right? And it provides that escape hatch so that central bankers have less power over the future. But again, if you want the real perspective on this from a true financial non bag bias historian, the episode coming at you on Monday, it was one of my favorite episodes that we've recorded recently, actually.
00:22:18.678 - 00:22:20.194, Speaker B: I really enjoy Edward.
00:22:20.322 - 00:22:59.010, Speaker A: Yeah. One of the reasons why the weekly roll up episodes always go so long is because we find little rabbit holes to talk about, and then I also want to talk about it, so I'll give my take as well. So the whole idea of this episode is that interest rates are a naturally emergent phenomenon. So the concept of a set interest rate by mere mortals, mere humans, is not real, it's fake. We're arbitrarily picking a number when nature, mother Nature, or why you said, only God knows what the ought to be interest rate ought to be. It's like when we pick a number, we create a fake world, and when we pick a low number. We are perpetuating that fake world and making it even faker.
00:22:59.010 - 00:23:30.014, Speaker A: And that has been our entire lifetimes. As millennials. We've been living in a fake world because interest rates have been low for more or less our entire lifetimes. And now we have to come to terms with that. And so now we got to jack up the interest rates to pay our debts that society has been paying for decades prior to our even acknowledging of the problem. And so the release valve, like you said, is crypto assets. And so the only reason why the Fed can create that fake world is because there's no escape valve to escape towards until bitcoin comes in 2009.
00:23:30.014 - 00:23:32.640, Speaker A: And here we are in history.
00:23:33.010 - 00:23:37.678, Speaker B: There David said bitcoin that time, not ethereum. I'm proud of you, David. That's great.
00:23:37.844 - 00:23:38.762, Speaker A: I don't own anything.
00:23:38.836 - 00:24:13.422, Speaker B: Speaking, though, of ethereum and being bullish on ethereum. Okay, one last thing we got to go over in the market section. This was a fantastic report, one of the best I've seen analyzing and predicting the price of ether. David, I know you haven't had a chance to read this. Let me tell you, I am so bullish, I want to invite these analysts on. And this is a report put out by Van Eck. So analyzing ether from an institutional perspective and throwing out price predictions based on the thing, based on total, actually understanding the asset, which is so bullish to me.
00:24:13.422 - 00:24:34.114, Speaker B: So they have a base case, bear case, and a bull case by 2030. Okay. And the way they are calculating this is based on ethereum's total revenue. So it's 2.5 billion annualized today. And they have a base case projection of 50 billion annualized per year by 2030. Right.
00:24:34.114 - 00:24:59.494, Speaker B: That's their base case. Their bear case is lower. Their bullcase is 136,000,000,000 per year. And the way they calculate those numbers is from, as we learned in our Justin Drake episode, congestion, which is ETH, gas fees, and also contention, which is mev. And also this thing that they call ethereum security as a service, which is the idea of using ETH, restaking ETH.
00:24:59.622 - 00:25:02.998, Speaker A: They have restaking in this report. Are you serious?
00:25:03.174 - 00:25:18.442, Speaker B: Yes. And I just want to point out, like, of course this is good for projection. This is not necessarily what the future these numbers, it's their job to produce these. They got the variables right. That's what I'm so bullish on. It's not another stupid institutional analyst report.
00:25:18.516 - 00:25:29.830, Speaker A: So you're actually just like, I don't care about the numbers, the fact that they got the variable, the inputs into the models. We're finally, at that point in the history yes. That institutions are getting the inputs right.
00:25:29.900 - 00:25:37.640, Speaker B: They actually are understanding how to value this asset class. And it's taken like three to four years of education. I actually feel like Bankless has been a big.
00:25:38.090 - 00:25:40.200, Speaker A: That is where we came from.
00:25:41.130 - 00:25:47.706, Speaker B: But this report gets it right. And by the way, it doesn't also include kind of monetary premium on top of this, because I think you could.
00:25:47.728 - 00:25:50.278, Speaker A: Argue that you can't measure that variable.
00:25:50.374 - 00:26:11.522, Speaker B: I don't know if I'm an institutional investor and I'm reading this report and I'm seeing these numbers so clearly laid out right, it just makes so much sense. And it's not a meme coin style of like, pull it out of your ass number. Anyway, bullish on institutions. Analysts actually understanding this asset. It's very cool.
00:26:11.656 - 00:26:38.282, Speaker A: I am offended that their base case for ether in 2030 is merely $12,000. But then you made the point that they didn't add in monetary premium, which is the right way to analyze that. Is it's a multiplier? It's like, how strong do you want the multiplier to be? If it's extremely moneyness, it's like a ten x. If it's not very moneyous, it's like a 1.5 x. So then adding the money multiplier onto it, which I think is strong, five X. Pulling that one out of my ass.
00:26:38.416 - 00:26:50.894, Speaker B: Totally. But you can pull that wherever you want to pull that from, because that's what money is. One's guess, right? Yes, very much. That's the meme value of it. Anyway, bullish on that. We got to move on. What do we got coming up next?
00:26:51.012 - 00:27:20.514, Speaker A: Coming up next, meme coin season. My favorite season. I'm lying. Bitcoin catches the shitcoin bug because the meme coin season was so strong that the virus has spread to bitcoin. But you know how when you catch a virus and you can actually change, it can mess with your DNA? That's what happened in Bitcoin this week. Bitcoin culture is shifting. The balance of power is shifting from the bitcoin fundamentalists to the bitcoin builders.
00:27:20.514 - 00:27:43.914, Speaker A: The tribe that I resonate with, I'm pretty sure you also resonate with. So we'll talk about that as well. And then Brad Sherman's got that a hot take, like we talked about, and I made a meme of him. And so we're going to talk about all of that and more.

I have not answered this question. I don't know if you have, David, but why don't you tell us? Have you bought a meme coin in the past month?
00:29:32.868 - 00:29:34.800, Speaker A: If you scroll down, you'll see my answer.
00:29:35.210 - 00:29:42.758, Speaker B: Let me see. Oh, yes. You got a GIF of, like, a.
00:29:42.764 - 00:29:44.994, Speaker A: Guy who's, like, sheepishly nodding.
00:29:45.042 - 00:29:50.054, Speaker B: Yeah, you have. So you have. You are one of the Dgens here.
00:29:50.092 - 00:29:51.946, Speaker A: Yeah, I've bought two coins. Yeah.
00:29:52.048 - 00:30:00.342, Speaker B: So what you say is going to be given with love. Wait, do you have bitterness that these weren't your meme coins that pumped, David?
00:30:00.406 - 00:30:13.200, Speaker A: No. Bitter that I'm compelled to play the game just like everyone else? Because that's the meta where we are. You don't have to you could just it's fine. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
00:30:13.730 - 00:30:19.250, Speaker B: I have ignored it so far, but why don't you tell us what's happening? So, here's the first tweet we're teeing up here.
00:30:19.320 - 00:30:49.238, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. So this is, of course, Pepe Coin. This started off by Pepe. Coin, launched the 16 April $1.5 billion market cap as of today, hit 1.7. Earlier, 122,000 people wallets have traded Pepe at least one point in their lives. The stories for how these tokens just, like, rocket out of corners of the internet into billion dollar market caps are always inherently dark.
00:30:49.238 - 00:30:56.426, Speaker A: And dark, yeah. Just like, hard to illuminate. Not dark like evil, but just like mysterious.
00:30:56.458 - 00:30:56.922, Speaker B: Opaque.
00:30:56.986 - 00:30:57.306, Speaker A: Opaque.
00:30:57.338 - 00:30:57.886, Speaker B: Yeah, I got it.
00:30:57.908 - 00:31:02.190, Speaker A: Yeah. They come from, like I'm sure they start with trading circles.
00:31:02.610 - 00:31:05.010, Speaker B: Back channel alpha telegram.
00:31:05.350 - 00:31:15.330, Speaker A: Someone figures out how to make something catch. I'm pretty sure that Pepe is just a freaking token, and it's just called Pepe. There's no utility to this thing.
00:31:15.400 - 00:31:17.314, Speaker B: It is just the frog.
00:31:17.362 - 00:31:49.194, Speaker A: Pepe the frog. Yes. This one token got minted and burst, and somehow somebody got the market to accept that this is the appropriate token that correlates with the Internet meme. And now, because it got to $1.5 billion, it now is so, this thing is sufficiently large, and the memes and owners around this are sufficiently big, and people have made sufficient amounts of money that this is now, like, doge is about the doge meme, and Pepe is about the Pepe meme. And now we have a new meme coin.
00:31:49.322 - 00:31:55.022, Speaker B: Look at this chart, David. Okay, so you're telling me this thing was valued at zero.
00:31:55.156 - 00:31:56.066, Speaker A: It was valued at zero.
00:31:56.088 - 00:32:10.822, Speaker B: Let me switch to market cap zero, of course, but, like, reasonably, when it got some liquidity I mean, first kind of days of liquidity. 77 million in market cap, and this thing got to yeah.
00:32:10.876 - 00:32:16.598, Speaker A: So $1.8 billion was just created out of nowhere inside of one month.
00:32:16.764 - 00:32:28.202, Speaker B: Okay, this must have minted some millionaires there. There's always some winners from these Pepe coins. Here's a chart we're looking at. Top three dudes. We don't know if these are dudes. Have made $14 million.
00:32:28.256 - 00:32:30.650, Speaker A: I will bet my entire net worth that these are dudes.
00:32:31.950 - 00:32:41.770, Speaker B: Okay? Three of them made over $14 million on Pepe. And, yes, they did cash out. That's why I was about to ask. These are people who were used as their exit liquidity.
00:32:41.850 - 00:33:04.406, Speaker A: Okay, so, the number one profit tier of Pepe made a nine X. The number two made a 14 X. Number three made a 4786 X. So they basically put zero capital at stake and bought all the tokens at very little price and then managed to hold it all the way up.
00:33:04.588 - 00:33:09.058, Speaker B: Imagine making $14 million just from the so stupid.
00:33:09.154 - 00:33:27.022, Speaker A: I mean, it's part of this industry. It's like, yeah, we have our new money printers, and, yeah, I guess this is, like, the logical conclusion of it, and I do appreciate that. This Tweet says here's the peFe profits leaderboard. This is a casino. This is a leaderboard. There are winners and losers here. There are net winners because there's $1.5
00:33:27.022 - 00:33:32.910, Speaker A: billion of wealth that's now on paper, but it is a game that people are playing.
00:33:33.570 - 00:33:50.630, Speaker B: Well, here's the game we could see. It kind of the peak, at least so far, unless this has a resurgence, was on May 5 at $1.8 billion. And now we're down to back down to $700 million at this point in time. So, who are the losers?
00:33:51.770 - 00:33:57.442, Speaker A: People that have bought in since May 5. If you've bought since May 5, you are a loser.
00:33:57.586 - 00:34:00.120, Speaker B: Yes. Sorry. You bought too late. Sorry.
00:34:00.730 - 00:34:03.006, Speaker A: In this local time frame, was Pepe.
00:34:03.058 - 00:34:04.730, Speaker B: One of the coins that you because.
00:34:04.800 - 00:34:18.830, Speaker A: There are many Meme Coins, right? Yeah. Now there's a Cambrian Explosion of Meme Coins because it's Meme Coin season, and everyone's like, people got a 50,000 X. What's the next Meme Coin that also gets you a 50,000 X? So now it's meme, coin. Casino like dogs.
00:34:19.250 - 00:34:20.302, Speaker B: What else is there?
00:34:20.356 - 00:34:28.562, Speaker A: I don't know. One of my friends sent me a contract address on Arbitrum, and I didn't even look.
00:34:28.616 - 00:34:32.018, Speaker B: Dude, this is the next Pepe. And you're just like, oh, I don't care.
00:34:32.104 - 00:34:36.514, Speaker A: I don't care. I didn't look into it. I'm like, all right, whatever.
00:34:36.632 - 00:34:55.482, Speaker B: I mean, if it's a very small amount of money, right? And this is what people want to do because they're bored in the bear market. Okay. It saddens me when people get serious about this and gamble away their life savings, but they're free to do that. What analysis are we looking at here?
00:34:55.616 - 00:35:08.830, Speaker A: Okay, so these are just more stats from Pepe. So, like I said, 122,000 distinct wallets. Top five to six wallets listed here are all Me V bots. So you want to know the real winners of the casino games? Ryan?
00:35:12.050 - 00:35:18.706, Speaker B: How about ETH. Holders? Because they paid some Mev to ETH holders and also burnt some gas if.
00:35:18.728 - 00:35:37.510, Speaker A: You don't know how to run an Mev bot and, well, it's hard to say the ETH holders are the winners here. ETH holders are always the house. But right now, Mev bots are first in being the house. Got you. It's more assured. And also, there's fewer of them. Specifically, this one mevbot.
00:35:37.510 - 00:35:47.146, Speaker A: Jared from Subway ETH. If bankless listeners don't know who that is, it is the mevbot that sandwiched attacked winter mute inside of.
00:35:47.248 - 00:35:47.706, Speaker B: Really?
00:35:47.808 - 00:35:48.794, Speaker A: Yeah. Uh huh.
00:35:48.832 - 00:35:50.474, Speaker B: Jared from Subway. I didn't know.
00:35:50.512 - 00:35:54.810, Speaker A: Jared from Subway is up to some shenanigans on the ethereum blockchain. Yeah.
00:35:54.880 - 00:36:21.542, Speaker B: Wow. That's Jared from Subway ETH. And you can see it all on chain. Here's a story here that says, in less than three months, jared reaped over $40.6 million in revenue with a profit of $6 million. So Jared from Subway is just raking it in by running these bots. He's got to program them, run themself, and is making money on these, I guess, Mev Arbitrage types of opportunities, right?
00:36:21.596 - 00:36:46.606, Speaker A: That's exactly right. So, yeah. Total revenue, $40.6 million. Paid $34 million in gas fees, which is why if you pull up ultrasound money, the burn rate of ETH is just, like, cratering or it's going up. The supply of ETH is just, like, going down bigly. Because Mev bots are paying such high fees to the ethereum blockchain, the $40 million of revenue has been turned into $34 million.
00:36:46.606 - 00:36:59.780, Speaker A: Yeah, dude, it's been crazy. So ethereum deflation is at 3% in the last seven days, which is crazy. Go to the seven day time frame. Did we break 10,000 ETH burnt per day? Are we at 70,000 this week?
00:37:00.230 - 00:37:00.738, Speaker B: Almost.
00:37:00.824 - 00:37:17.158, Speaker A: We're at 67.8 thousand. Okay. So Jared from Subway ETH. This infamous sandwich attacker bot that is just printing cash. 238,000 sandwich Attacks attacking more than 106,000.
00:37:17.324 - 00:37:22.554, Speaker B: I get it. Jared from Subway. Sandwich Attack. Yeah, I'm just putting that together now.
00:37:22.592 - 00:37:52.686, Speaker A: Sorry. 98.3% of Jared's transactions are sandwich attacks. The way that this works is that the reason why this works is that these tokens are super illiquid. And so this is why that this is a game. Is that of the one point or now I guess it's $700 million of market cap. It's, like, resting on I think it was something like $20 million of liquidity.
00:37:52.686 - 00:38:36.786, Speaker A: So there's only so much liquidity that's supporting this market cap. And so, since these things are really illiquid, this is just a field day for Me V bots, because everyone aping into these things without thinking about it and not doing their price controls and not using cowswap are getting sandwiched by Jared sandwiched by so inserting transactions ahead of these buyers to pump up the price. And then he's selling the tokens right after people buy inside of the same block, just printing money. So he's doing this for Pepe, obviously. And then also, he's got the wallet holds 800 tokens that Jared controls. So he's just doing this for the entire Ethereum casino. And so there's this massive casino going on because of the shitcoin mania that's happening.
00:38:36.786 - 00:38:46.482, Speaker A: And you're right when you say that the Ether holders are the house, but Jared from Subway is front running us by doing mev Sandwich attacks, which really.
00:38:46.616 - 00:38:49.160, Speaker B: He'S really at the table taking a cut.
00:38:49.930 - 00:39:15.650, Speaker A: So he is a rogue dealer that is under the table, like, moving cards around. And then instead of the casino making money because Ethereum is a casino, the dealer's making the money. And so this really hammers home. Justin drake's mev burn. Why we need mev burn. Because this one guy is taking all the money for himself instead of distributing it equally and fairly to all the Ether holders, which really imparts why we need burn.
00:39:15.670 - 00:39:17.578, Speaker B: We want the sandwiches to go to that's.
00:39:17.594 - 00:39:20.762, Speaker A: That's our casino money. Jerry.
00:39:20.906 - 00:39:21.822, Speaker B: How dare you?
00:39:21.876 - 00:39:27.346, Speaker A: Yeah, how dare you? I'd be a lot less bitter if that went to the pretty, but you.
00:39:27.368 - 00:39:50.614, Speaker B: Sound pretty greedy, David, because ETH. Has burnt a lot this week. I mean, that's been pretty good. You can always burnt more, like, twice. Let me ask you about this. Do you feel, like, moralizing about this? Are you kind of like, meme coins are bad? Are you of the mindset that this is what's wrong with crypto? It's giving us a bad reputation. Now, Gary Gensler has additional fodder, and so does Brad Sherman.
00:39:50.614 - 00:40:05.662, Speaker B: And they can go look at these millennials in their underwear, living in their parents basement, trading these meme coins around. That's all crypto is good for. End of story. Are you mad about this or what's your take?
00:40:05.796 - 00:40:11.966, Speaker A: Yeah, are you tapping into my slight spiciness attitude today?
00:40:12.068 - 00:40:13.040, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:40:14.610 - 00:40:58.926, Speaker A: I don't think that's a wrong take. The reason why I'm in crypto is because Ethereum produces coordination platforms and one of the byproducts of that is shitcoins. And that's good and natural phenomenon. I'm not going to moralize like, you can't use my blockchain for your shitcoins. It's a little bit frustrating that this is, like now my third bear market and the whole funneling and capturing money and giving it to public goods and being able to coordinate around public goods and being able to produce the Sci-Fi future of human coordination and flourishing. We're still doing the Pepe coins and so there's a reason why we didn't cover Pepe coins in our weekly livestream. It's just like, we've done this before.
00:40:58.926 - 00:41:06.930, Speaker A: We did this in 2017, we did this in 2021, we're doing it in 2023. How many times are we going to go around the sun and talk about.
00:41:07.000 - 00:41:10.180, Speaker B: Why can't you be happy for people who got really wealthy here?
00:41:10.790 - 00:41:19.960, Speaker A: Because there's very few of them. There's a single leaderboard and we know who they are. It's supposed to be everyone. It's supposed to be a systemic level.
00:41:21.210 - 00:41:24.626, Speaker B: Yeah. Not all boats. All boats did not rise.
00:41:24.658 - 00:41:29.014, Speaker A: Pepe is not going to make the world a more sustainable place.
00:41:29.052 - 00:41:52.000, Speaker B: It is not my I get it. I would say, though, one thing, to quote you from last week, is Ether money is a public good and this does go towards contributing towards the economic security of Ethereum. So there's that, at least. My overall take is that this is just noise and I don't care about it. And I wish it's a lot of noise. It is noisy. I know.
00:41:52.000 - 00:42:02.446, Speaker B: I would love to be able to channel this out and just like we're building, people are bored, so they're doing this. I think there's some narrative problems around it, but mostly this is just noise.
00:42:02.638 - 00:42:08.840, Speaker A: I'm not going to hate on the internet for doing weird internet things. I'm feeling funny today.
00:42:10.890 - 00:42:34.926, Speaker B: Well, let's talk about the bitcoin community, because bitcoin is kind of feeling funny as well. Bitcoin transaction fees are up. In good news, that's bullish, because bitcoin long term, does not have a way to sustain the economic budget and the security budget of bitcoin. So transaction fees going up, transaction revenue going up is kind of bullish. But why don't you tell us why transaction fees are going up?
00:42:35.108 - 00:43:09.802, Speaker A: The innovation of the ERC 20 has migrated its way to bitcoin. So using the Ordinals protocol, we now have BRC 20s. Just because they're copycatting the name. Actually, they're not like the ERC 20 token standard on bitcoin, because that doesn't work. You don't take the ERC 20 standard and put it onto bitcoin via Ordinals. But the idea is that, yeah, we're doing tokens on bitcoin now, so using the Ordinals protocol, we now have shitcoins on bitcoin. And so it's more like the semifungible for the people who like, the deeper takes the semifungible, ERC one one five token standard.
00:43:09.802 - 00:43:43.278, Speaker A: So fungible tokens, but they're unique. As well. And so there is now a BRC token page. There is now a UniSat IO marketplace. So we have a marketplace for tokens on Bitcoin. The first token is ordor d Y for ordinals. And so if you want to access the uni SATS marketplace, you first need to buy a BRC 20 with a UniSat wallet, and then you need to mint 20 new inscriptions into Bitcoin ordinals.
00:43:43.278 - 00:44:17.200, Speaker A: And the beautiful thing about it so this is like the utility. What does an already token do? Which is the first BRC 20 on the ordinals protocol. It gives you access to the marketplace. So it's like a token gated access to the marketplace. And so the thing is, the crazy thing that this is genius, Ryan, is what they did is that in order to access the marketplace, you had to mint 20 new BRC 20 tokens. And so in order to even enter the marketplace, you had to supply 20 new tokens into the market. So the marketplace could have yeah, you didn't need to do anything with them.
00:44:17.200 - 00:44:36.590, Speaker A: What this did is this filled up the Bitcoin block space because everyone was minting BRC 20 tokens because they wanted to access the uni SAP marketplace. And so what did that do? It. Congested the bitcoin blockchain. It got people talking about it. It went viral. People shared it on Twitter, and now it became a movement.
00:44:36.750 - 00:44:42.582, Speaker B: Okay, so BRC 20, the market cap of BRC 20 tokens, 537,000,000.
00:44:42.716 - 00:44:46.982, Speaker A: That's funny. It was 700 million literally 2 hours ago when I made this.
00:44:47.036 - 00:44:56.150, Speaker B: I mean, as you would expect, that's 206,000,024 hours over a billion earlier this week. Can I just ask real quick about the user experience of something like unistat.
00:44:56.310 - 00:44:59.274, Speaker A: Unistat me, I haven't used it, but.
00:44:59.312 - 00:45:16.446, Speaker B: It doesn't sound easy. This is not like MetaMask connect, pay gas fee, hit the button, and swap. I mean, we really are maximizing the capability of this Ti 83 calculator here, and people are getting really creative with it. Let me say, you can play doom.
00:45:16.478 - 00:45:21.106, Speaker A: On the Ti 83 calculator. There's a lot left of juice to squeeze, I'd say, actually.
00:45:21.288 - 00:45:29.990, Speaker B: Okay, well, so this is a tweet from Eric Wall. This is a chart of what happens when somebody correctly circuits the ponzi wires. What are we looking at here?
00:45:30.060 - 00:45:46.070, Speaker A: This is what I was talking about. So these are all of the marketplaces of Bitcoin. So ordinals ordinance swap, ordinals wallet, and then unisats. And because of the you must mint 20 BRCs in order to enter the UniSat marketplace is just by far the biggest one. Right.
00:45:46.140 - 00:45:50.746, Speaker B: It's crushing like magic Eden. Right. Okay. A sat marketplace.
00:45:50.778 - 00:46:06.674, Speaker A: So this is Bitcoin, and then the Ordi token recently got listed on a centralized exchange now on gate. So we have bitcoin tokens. Ryan. There's tokens on Bitcoin being traded on centralized exchanges, which is I never thought I'd see the day.
00:46:06.792 - 00:46:11.262, Speaker B: I think that's kind of cool. All right, so here's the chart. Of the ori token.
00:46:11.326 - 00:46:11.646, Speaker A: Tokens.
00:46:11.678 - 00:46:15.598, Speaker B: You're saying it looks similar. It's not quite pepe, but it's got.
00:46:15.624 - 00:46:24.120, Speaker A: Some $290,000,000 market cap. Also just got minted in. When did that thing get started? Like, in the last week.
00:46:24.810 - 00:46:25.858, Speaker B: That's incredible.
00:46:25.954 - 00:46:30.170, Speaker A: Okay, nominated bitcoin. Bitcoin. Yeah. This is a bitcoin denominated tokens.
00:46:30.830 - 00:46:36.298, Speaker B: I mean, that's bullish in a way. But tell me about block space demand. What are we looking at here?
00:46:36.384 - 00:46:56.874, Speaker A: So this is two charts of ordinal inscriptions. So how many inscriptions there are made via the ordinals protocol and then also fees paid over time, which is just like, the highest spike I've ever seen on bitcoin. So inscriptions just as, like, one creation of an ordinal creation of an inscription.
00:46:56.922 - 00:47:12.550, Speaker B: I'm not the best. There was one day last week where blockchain transaction fees on on bitcoin transaction fees were larger than actual issuance, which I'm not sure that has ever happened. Bitcoin. Yeah.
00:47:12.620 - 00:47:13.910, Speaker A: Yo. Wow.
00:47:13.980 - 00:47:14.502, Speaker B: Right?
00:47:14.636 - 00:47:19.930, Speaker A: Wow. That's nuts. And then they all went to the miners and got sold.
00:47:21.950 - 00:47:26.090, Speaker B: Well, here we go. Daily fees, market share.
00:47:26.160 - 00:47:41.630, Speaker A: Look at that. Okay, it's hard to articulate this for the podcast listeners, but daily fees is flat. And then it's just vertical. It goes so high so quickly. I've never seen a parabola like that. And then this next chart. Ryan okay, this is a crazy stat.
00:47:41.630 - 00:47:54.094, Speaker A: This is a new record for bitcoin in its entire lifespan. The amount of unconfirmed transactions waiting to be confirmed in the bitcoin men pool at the highest.
00:47:54.142 - 00:47:56.342, Speaker B: Oh, my god. Look at this. I did the one year.
00:47:56.476 - 00:48:11.750, Speaker A: It has never been higher. Bitcoin has broken its own record. In how long has bitcoin been around? 14 years. 13 years. We have never seen more pending transactions in bitcoin ever. Not even close because of ordinals.
00:48:12.170 - 00:48:18.874, Speaker B: What's interesting here, so the mem pool is getting clogged, basically. So this means transaction fees on bitcoin have to be going up, right?
00:48:18.912 - 00:48:19.066, Speaker A: Yes.
00:48:19.088 - 00:48:58.482, Speaker B: And maybe we'll get to part of that story. But just one observation here is if you want to be a smart contract platform, you're going to have to deal with smart contract platform problems. That's kind of what this is, right? I mean, we talk about mev, we talk about okay, where do the proceeds for crazy congestion fees go? Do they go to miners or do we burn them to someone else? It's a same set of problems that ethereum has had to deal with because these are common problems to any programmable blockchain. And with taproot, the implementation of taproot bitcoin became slightly programmable.
00:48:58.546 - 00:49:01.314, Speaker A: Just a little bit, just programmable enough for some.
00:49:01.452 - 00:49:24.078, Speaker B: Starting to get these problems, which is fascinating to me. Here is a tweet from finance. We've temporarily closed bitcoin withdrawals as the bitcoin network is experiencing a congestion issue. Wow. Our team is working currently to fix until the network is stabilized, it will reopen bitcoin withdrawals as soon as possible. I mean, fees going up, $10 to transfer a bitcoin. That's crazy here's.
00:49:24.078 - 00:49:38.546, Speaker B: The Ordinals marketplace going crazy as well. Tell me about, though, this cultural change that this has caused, or like some dissent in the ranks of bitcoin supporters, what's your take on this so far?
00:49:38.648 - 00:50:07.962, Speaker A: So we have two main characters here, I'll say the good kinds of main characters, eric Wall and Nick Carter, who are coming on next Tuesday for The State of the Nation. I'm so excited for that episode. Here's a meme of a dandelion, a weed just growing out of concrete. The concrete is bitcoin maximalism. The weed is taproot. And so Eric Wall is saying, can you go back to the tweet? Eric Wall is saying, what happened today was the emergence of the BRC 20 asset class. It wasn't an attack, it wasn't a DDoS.
00:50:07.962 - 00:50:38.790, Speaker A: Taproot has just made it simple to productize the bitcoin block space into any arbitrary protocol. Shitcoin trading protocols is an obvious buyer of that block space. And so he's saying, the expressiveness that we've had on Ethereum Smart Contracts is being created on bitcoin via Taproot. And then his next tweet is the look at me. We are the hornets now. It's the I'm in charge now meme. Except he's got the bitcoin wizard hat and the wizard beard, because these are the memes of the bitcoin space.
00:50:38.790 - 00:50:50.518, Speaker A: And so this is like, look at me. We're in charge now. Hey, bitcoin fundamentalists, who are like, get your shitcoinery out of our chain. Our chain is for bitcoin. We're in charge. We're in charge now. The builders are in charge.
00:50:50.614 - 00:51:37.414, Speaker B: We have two camps now. Again, and this isn't the first time that bitcoin has divided into two camps. Nick Carter wrote a great editorial piece about this. Remember the big blockers and the small blockers? This was back in the 2017, I think, 2017, 2018 blockchain block size wars in bitcoin. And basically the big blockers went and forked off with bitcoin cash. They went in another direction and the small blockers kept bitcoin block space smaller and kept it as a premium asset. This is a similar split in the bitcoin community where you have the hardcore, I call them maybe bitcoin maximalists or call them bitcoin fundamentalists, who just think that this kind of activity is beneath.
00:51:37.414 - 00:52:04.126, Speaker B: Bitcoin is unholy. Thou shalt not hold any other asset but bitcoin, right? So they don't like any of these memes, the Ponzi's tokens. They hate it. It's impure. And then there's like, more bitcoin pragmatists. I think it's maybe a larger set of the population, like Eric Wall, like Nick Carter, who are like, if we want bitcoin, the network to succeed, we have to sell blockspace. That is fundamental.
00:52:04.126 - 00:52:29.082, Speaker B: And you don't get to decide what the block space is used for. The credible neutrality of bitcoin just says it provides the highest bidder. It just is. And by the way, this is actually a good thing for the bitcoin network because it's a source of economic sustainability into the future, as Issuance starts to run dry. So these are the two camps that are kind of competing for cultural mind share right now, right?
00:52:29.136 - 00:53:09.914, Speaker A: Okay. And the crazy thing is, even when you apply Bitcoin fundamentalist maxi principles, eric and Nick are still right. And so here's an Eric tweet. So he goes, 90% of lightning laser eyed maxis use Noster, a centralized custodial lightning provider, and it's just like Lightning network, which is deemed holy by the Bitcoin maximalists, except it's centralized and custodial, which is insane. And then he continues and goes, 90% of magicians, which is now the name of a tribe, which is how you know it's good because it's got a name. Trading Ordinals inscriptions using noncustodial trustless PSBT atomic swaps. I don't know what PSBT is.
00:53:09.914 - 00:53:49.666, Speaker A: So basically he's saying, hey, what ordinals is it's trustless? It's atomic, it is noncustodial. And all of the holy narratives of Bitcoin, which is Lightning network, is custodial and trusted and just like, totally asked backwards. So if you scroll down, his next Tweet is so good, he goes, An IOU, bitcoin equals fiat, which is the custodial lightning. The laser eyed maxis are the shitcoiners. And he follows again and goes, we built a more trustless, decentralized protocol for trading our horribly inefficient Ordinal NFTs and BRC. 20 tokens in two months. You are not even using trustless solutions to send micro payments.
00:53:49.666 - 00:53:57.222, Speaker A: After seven years, all caps, you failed. OOH, it's so good. It's so good.
00:53:57.356 - 00:54:00.706, Speaker B: I mean, he's saying one set of users is banked and the other is bankless.
00:54:00.818 - 00:54:02.118, Speaker A: That's basically right.
00:54:02.204 - 00:54:03.494, Speaker B: That's our exactly parlance.
00:54:03.542 - 00:54:33.490, Speaker A: And then Amin Soleimani follows up and goes, I discovered this payments problem. Amin Soleimani was innovating on payment channels on Ethereum when we were trying to figure out how to scale Ethereum. He goes, I discovered this five years ago when I tried to use Ethereum state channels for my camsite. He made spank chain. Our work helped rule out state channels as a long term layer two solution. And East Nerds doubled down on Plasma, which eventually became layer two roll ups and finishes off saying, good to see bitcoiners catching up. To which Eric Wall responds, lol.
00:54:33.490 - 00:54:37.230, Speaker A: I mean, this is because LMFAO is what he said.
00:54:37.320 - 00:54:49.854, Speaker B: This is because some Bitcoiners are realizing that Lightning, which uses state channel technology, isn't all it's cracked up to be. There are a lot of challenges with it. What is Michael saylor saying? Should we play this clip?
00:54:49.922 - 00:54:52.810, Speaker A: I think we should play this clip. Michael Saylor has an interesting take.
00:54:52.960 - 00:55:39.320, Speaker C: So I think that what happened with Ordinals and NFTs is we crossed this chasm from what was a bearish scenario to a bullish scenario. If I was a miner, I would be ecstatic. I think that long term, there are a lot of implications. Long term, the implication is there's going to be a lot of applications on the Bitcoin base layer if I can inscribe a piece of art right, an NFT is kind of an art. But I could also inscribe my last will and testament. And if my last will and testament is moving a billion dollars from me to you, how much is it worth to you to have that burned onto the blockchain and cryptographically verified? Yeah, at least a billion dollars for me. Would you pay $20? Yeah, 100%.
00:55:39.710 - 00:55:41.642, Speaker A: You're the smart contract. There you go.
00:55:41.696 - 00:55:43.686, Speaker C: So there are interesting applications.
00:55:43.718 - 00:56:09.498, Speaker B: It's funny because obviously sailor is team not team full bitcoin maximalism. He's totally okay with this. But it's so funny to like yeah, NFDS are fine if they're on my blockchain. NFTs are fantastic. So are tokens if they pump my bags. There's some deep hypocrisy here, I think, among some members of the bitcoin community. I don't see it in Eric Wald, though.
00:56:09.498 - 00:56:37.420, Speaker B: Or Nick Carter. No, personally, this is a tweet from Nick Carter. Now, if bitcoin could find a way to return this capital to holders instead of it being siphoned out by miners, so of course, all the transaction fees going straight to miners and then lots of transaction fees, lots of revenue. That was the smartest thing ETH ever did, frankly, and I was skeptical of it. ETH. Of course, burning these transaction fees rather than distributing them to miners and stakers. So look, man, they're coming around.
00:56:37.420 - 00:56:43.200, Speaker B: Eric Wall says this is probably the funniest year in bitcoin ever. I agree.
00:56:43.650 - 00:57:09.190, Speaker A: The laser eyed maxis are now the laser eyed ring maxis. And Eric Wall and Nick Carter. The people that I've always been aligned with and always thought were just like on the pinnacle of what this crypto industry is doing are finally being have the foundation for them to stand on because they couldn't stand up to the cyber hornets without something like the ordinals protocol supporting them and their points and their areas of emphasis.
00:57:09.530 - 00:57:11.542, Speaker B: I'm cheering bitcoin on in this.
00:57:11.676 - 00:57:12.214, Speaker A: Yes.
00:57:12.332 - 00:57:13.894, Speaker B: I still think what's ironic is I.
00:57:13.932 - 00:57:18.440, Speaker A: Still think never enjoyed bitcoin more than I have in the last month or so.
00:57:18.890 - 00:57:21.160, Speaker B: They're still kind of years behind on these things.
00:57:21.930 - 00:57:25.158, Speaker A: They still are going through their state channels era. Dude.
00:57:25.254 - 00:57:30.438, Speaker B: I don't know if it makes me more bullish on bitcoin or not, but it is fun to witness it's trending.
00:57:30.454 - 00:57:49.886, Speaker A: In the right direction, that's for sure. This is now a bullish bitcoin podcast, at least. Semi bull. Semi bull. We need to get to the rest of the show, Ryan. And so coming up next is Brad Sherman's beautiful, beautiful soundbite that will be imprinted in the crypto industry. Somebody should inscribe it into the bitcoin blockchain.
00:57:49.886 - 00:58:05.746, Speaker A: So we're going to get to that sound bite as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible, especially MetaMask.

00:59:54.224 - 01:00:01.274, Speaker B: Here it is, guys. Representative Brad Sherman at a US. House hearing this week. Here's what he said crypto Bros. Make.
01:00:01.312 - 01:00:12.702, Speaker A: Money, literally by making money, and they've made over a trillion dollars out of thin air. They'll accuse the US. Government of making money out of thin air. Maybe we do, but we're the US.
01:00:12.756 - 01:00:27.014, Speaker B: Government. There it is, David. It's begged by it all the way down. You just said, look, it's not okay when you print money. It's only okay when I print money. That's what he's saying.
01:00:27.132 - 01:00:31.846, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't have another take. That's all you have to say?
01:00:31.948 - 01:00:46.150, Speaker B: Brad Sherman has more takes. 60 years ago, the late, great Robert F. Kennedy went after tax evaders as US. Attorney General. Today, his son is slated to speak at a conference for tax evaders. This is Robert f. Kennedy Jr.
01:00:46.150 - 01:00:55.194, Speaker B: He is going to a bitcoin conference in Miami Beach. And this is Brad Sherman calling the attendees of this conference tax evaders.
01:00:55.322 - 01:00:58.730, Speaker A: Those in the conference for tax evaders.
01:00:58.890 - 01:01:01.194, Speaker B: It's a conference for tax evators.
01:01:01.242 - 01:01:01.840, Speaker A: Yes.
01:01:02.690 - 01:01:03.646, Speaker B: I don't know about you, David.
01:01:03.678 - 01:01:05.010, Speaker A: That's great for marketing.
01:01:05.670 - 01:01:38.762, Speaker B: I pay my taxes. And it's a big, giant pain in the ass to pay taxes when you have unclear regulation and unfavorable regulation with respect to tracking these transactions. And I and almost everyone I know in crypto also pays their taxes. And for Brad Sherman to just blanket the entire industry and say anyone who goes to a crypto conference, anyone who's in the crypto industry doesn't pay their taxes, like, what is this guy doing, man?
01:01:38.816 - 01:01:45.706, Speaker A: It's insane, man. The anti crypto army of Elizabeth Warren and Brad Sherman is just a bunch of geriatrics dude.
01:01:45.898 - 01:01:55.322, Speaker B: I don't understand. Well, you gotta I can't look at this picture. U. S. Government right now. This is a clown. This is one of my David AI generated.
01:01:55.466 - 01:02:00.050, Speaker A: Oh, no, that's a real picture, actually. That is photographed. That's a photograph.
01:02:00.950 - 01:02:01.966, Speaker B: This is not a photograph.
01:02:01.998 - 01:02:02.546, Speaker A: What are you talking about?
01:02:02.568 - 01:02:03.022, Speaker B: Photograph?
01:02:03.086 - 01:02:03.918, Speaker A: This is a photograph.
01:02:04.014 - 01:02:15.238, Speaker B: Looks just like it's not nice. All right, lido looks like they are enabling withdrawals finally. It's taken them a while, but here we are. What's happening?
01:02:15.324 - 01:02:46.162, Speaker A: I guess we can't say the withdrawals is totally over because Lido still needs to enable withdrawals and so on. Chain vote going out today, Friday. That will go live if the vote passes on May 15, will allow for staked Ether withdrawals out of Lido, along with some protocol improvements as well. And so Lido is getting a big upgrade, but the big news is that if there is demand to unstake from Lido, people are free to withdraw from Lido. So we will see if Lido can hold on to all of the ETH that it has. And that's going to be a big area of attention next week.
01:02:46.296 - 01:02:53.950, Speaker B: Another snow globe shaking event. How about Arbitrum? They got some news this week about surplus revenue from transaction fees in the Dow.
01:02:54.030 - 01:03:22.906, Speaker A: Yeah, this is really cool. Okay, so very good Tweet thread, which we don't have time to go into, but I will summarize it for you, bankless listeners. So all users on Arbitrum One pay a fee. Of course, when you transact on the network, arbitram, just like Ethereum, has a gas fee. This fee is split into two components. An L one fee that pays for the L one gas that the Arbitrum network pays to Ethereum to post this data, and also a layer two fee to pay for the layer two network costs. That layer two fee is split into two components itself.
01:03:22.906 - 01:03:58.694, Speaker A: One is called the base fee, which is pretty synonymous with the base fee on the layer one, and also a surplus fee, which is like profit on top of that, just for making sure the network is profitable. So the layer one gas fee goes to the layer one sequencer. So the Arbitrum sequencer fronts the cost of posting data to the blockchain for Arbitrum. And then the layer one base fee goes through to refund the sequencer for its costs. So at the present amount, the refund is about 6000 Ether. So the sequencer costs 6000 Ether. And there is a 582 Ether surplus.
01:03:58.694 - 01:04:35.582, Speaker A: That the layer one fees from Arbitrum, a surplus that was not needed and so is going to the Dow. And so, because the sequencer charged more fees than it needed, a surplus of 582 Ether is going to the Dow. Now, going back to the layer two fees, we have the base fee, which accumulated 1308 Ether, is going to the Dow. And then the surplus fee, which is anything for the congestion. Like the model for this is contention versus contention and congestion. This is base fee and surplus fee. But this is Arbitrum terminology.
01:04:35.582 - 01:04:58.022, Speaker A: Base fee, 1308 Ether, surplus fee, 1462 Ether. All of that going to Arbitrum dow. So if you tally all of this up, we're getting something like 3400 Ether. Ish 3332 ether going to the arbitram dow? That is profit for Arbitrum since inception.
01:04:58.086 - 01:05:01.610, Speaker B: For Arbitrum. What's the time period here?
01:05:01.760 - 01:05:03.950, Speaker A: Don't know. Actually, that's a good point.
01:05:04.100 - 01:05:25.486, Speaker B: What's interesting about this is the model for a layer two is basically like a value added reseller of ethereum block space. And so they're putting their value on it and then they're charging a profit. And that's how layer twos retain profitability, essentially. Now Arbitrum is delivering this back to the Dow. Very cool. This is interesting. New model here's.
01:05:25.486 - 01:05:41.690, Speaker B: A take from plenty. An actually economically sustainable protocol in crypto. Crazy talk. Arbitrum dow netted $6 million. The cost of operation was $11 million. Pretty impressive. Layer twos like Arbitrum are profitable.
01:05:41.690 - 01:05:44.294, Speaker B: That's good to see some sustainable economics.
01:05:44.342 - 01:05:51.370, Speaker A: In crypto when EIP 4844 comes in. Ryan, the real power operation drops so big.
01:05:51.440 - 01:06:02.766, Speaker B: Yeah, Brian's been busy. Brian Armstrong. Look at all these photos in the Middle East. Here with Brian meeting with various folks. What's the story here?
01:06:02.868 - 01:06:30.754, Speaker A: So this is the Brian World Star bluff collar strong arm segment. Armstrong strong arm. So why is Brian tweeting out a picture with the Minister of the Economy of the United States, Emirates? He's also meeting with Her Excellency SCA CEO Dr. Miriam. I don't know. Somebody in Dubai. Also the Minister of State of Foreign Trade from the United States of Emirates.
01:06:30.754 - 01:06:57.602, Speaker A: And then he tweets out the UAE. Deserves a lot of credit for being forward thinking on crypto. First dedicated crypto regulator in the world. Clear rulebook, very clearly published, business friendly, strong customer protections. Really enjoying my visit so far. Brian Armstrong, absolute world star, going on a world tour, talking to officials in pro crypto countries. Why is he publicly broadcasting his World Star ness? Ryan, what do you think is the angle here?
01:06:57.656 - 01:07:19.798, Speaker B: Perhaps it's like when you break up with someone and so you start posting pictures of all of these amazing experiences you've been having. It's kind of like that. I mean, Brian's like, look what you're missing. I mean, I am a US based company, entrepreneur. These regulators aren't crazy from these other countries. And so he's making that very public. I think that's the signal here.
01:07:19.798 - 01:07:28.842, Speaker B: Obviously, there's some expansion reasons that Coinbase is looking at the middle east, but I think that's a core message and why this is so public. That's exactly right.
01:07:28.896 - 01:07:44.554, Speaker A: Okay, moving on. PayPal has disclosed that it's safeguarding nearly $1 billion in crypto assets, half a billion dollars in bitcoin, $362,000,000 in ETH. So PayPal has as a custodian is a billion dollars in customers crypto.
01:07:44.602 - 01:07:48.530, Speaker B: Nice. You know what they're going to want to do next, David, is stake. Some of that, I'm pretty sure.
01:07:48.680 - 01:07:49.378, Speaker A: Nice.
01:07:49.544 - 01:07:56.366, Speaker B: Elon Musk is tweeting about Meladys. There is no meme. I love you, melady tweet. What does this do to the price of Meladys?
01:07:56.398 - 01:08:00.440, Speaker A: David, when Elon Musk I have not looked. I can only imagine. It is up.
01:08:00.810 - 01:08:07.650, Speaker B: Cool. So the story this week is Meladys tweeting by Elon Musk and meme. Coins, huh? That's what crypto has given. Yep.
01:08:07.730 - 01:08:08.482, Speaker A: Yep.
01:08:08.626 - 01:08:17.350, Speaker B: All right, moving on. So apparently Arthur Hayes and Suzu got some beef. What are we looking at here? This is a court document.
01:08:17.430 - 01:08:59.506, Speaker A: Well, actually, I'm pretty sure it's just Arthur Hayes that has beef with Su Zu. So Suzu has filed a restraining order against Arthur Hayes. And so the order prohibits Hayes from using threatening, abusive, or insulting words and making any threatening, abusive, or insulting communication that would cause applicant harassment, harm, or distress. And so Three arrows capital owes Arthur Hayes a billion dollars in individual claims, of which Arthur Hayes is some of that. And Hayes has just been absolutely harassing su on Twitter. And so here's a bunch of tweets that Arthur Hayes has. Name a date, time, and location of Kyle and Suzu.
01:08:59.506 - 01:09:10.026, Speaker A: I bet some creditors would love to have a chat with them. Followed up with a little birdie. Told me Suzu is in Singapore trying to keep a low profile. I know you ain't broke, bra. Come and see daddy and make amends. I won't hurt, I promise.
01:09:10.098 - 01:09:10.654, Speaker B: Kissy face.
01:09:10.692 - 01:09:21.082, Speaker A: Kissy face. Kissy face. So because of Arthur Hayes's posturing public tweets, he has now a restraining order against Suzu.
01:09:21.146 - 01:09:26.450, Speaker B: Come on. And honestly, tame to me, David, these tweets look tame to want.
01:09:26.600 - 01:09:35.394, Speaker A: The two times that we've done a podcast with Arthur Hayes. He's been in gym clothes, man. I don't want to owe him mean.
01:09:35.432 - 01:09:51.422, Speaker B: But what are these guys doing? I don't understand. Unless there's more to it than just these tweets publicly. I mean, you lost people millions and hundreds of millions of dollars. Guys, people are going to be upset about that with fraud. They may say means it's okay to lose people's money. Twitter.
01:09:51.506 - 01:09:53.770, Speaker A: It's not okay to do it with fraud.
01:09:54.590 - 01:10:16.602, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Here we go. Stripe expanding access to crypto on ramp with a new hosted option. You know what, David? Stripe has been more and more supportive of crypto over time. And of course, they serve a massive amount of merchants through the payments API. Used by Brave, used by Safe, used by one Inch, used by Lens. I think this is pretty bullish.
01:10:16.602 - 01:10:18.494, Speaker B: Longer term for crypto adoption.
01:10:18.622 - 01:10:27.958, Speaker A: WorldCoin and the beloved orb finally has a mobile wallet. So if you didn't want to put your eye into the orb, you can still download the wallet on your phone. And so WorldCoin app is do I.
01:10:27.964 - 01:10:31.800, Speaker B: Have to stick my eye into the phone now? Into the app?
01:10:33.290 - 01:10:56.122, Speaker A: I don't think the app scans your eye, doesn't have the technology to do that. And so this is just a huge part of the WorldCoin tech stack, which I've been learning about recently. Ryan and it's a crazy tech stack. I mean, man, it's an app. It is this crazy biometrics orb thing. It is a layer two stack. It is a token marketing.
01:10:56.122 - 01:11:08.878, Speaker A: It's a crazy company. Anyways, the app is out, and that is a very core component of this whole thing. It is the mechanism to which the UBI part of WorldCoin is going to get distributed.
01:11:09.054 - 01:11:28.762, Speaker B: I am undecided on WorldCoin. It's very I'm warming up to not I'm leaving the door open for myself personally. It's got some strikes against it. It's very much like a VC type coin. It's called WorldCoin. David the branding is the biggest issue.
01:11:28.816 - 01:11:36.086, Speaker A: About WorldCoin, but if you can suspend your disbelief, the WorldCoin story is pretty compelling.
01:11:36.278 - 01:11:40.442, Speaker B: I don't know yet. There's data, of course.
01:11:40.496 - 01:11:52.682, Speaker A: Everyone's like, oh, but they got your data, but they actually don't. And it's really easy to cancel WorldCoin for the whole data thing, but they actually don't got your data. I trust that they don't.
01:11:52.826 - 01:12:17.510, Speaker B: I'm at the point where I want to hear them out, though. Yes, they're making some cool choices, too, right? I'm building this as a roll up is a cool choice. Not doing kind of an L One chain and pumping the price of World Coin from the get goes. And I know they had engineers there, too, actually. Well, should we say? So David is doing an interview with one of the founders of WorldCoin and Sam Altman. Oh, that wasn't it.
01:12:17.580 - 01:12:20.226, Speaker A: But that is happening. Yeah. So we are doing a podcast with Sam Altman.
01:12:20.258 - 01:12:32.490, Speaker B: Yeah, we're doing a podcast on WorldCoin. So we'll arm the bankless community with some knowledge here from the source, and you guys can make a decision on whether this is good or whether this is some dystopian future here. What's your alpha?
01:12:32.570 - 01:12:44.750, Speaker A: I got breakfast with a DC builder from the World Coin Project. ZK researcher. Researcher at the World Coin. And so he, of course, brought the orb with him. So we put the little orb god.
01:12:44.820 - 01:12:45.902, Speaker B: Oh, my God. There it is.
01:12:45.956 - 01:12:46.806, Speaker A: Yeah, there it is.
01:12:46.928 - 01:12:48.434, Speaker B: Did you stick anything into that?
01:12:48.472 - 01:12:51.310, Speaker A: I have not been orbed. I did not stick anything into the orb.
01:12:51.390 - 01:12:52.674, Speaker B: Dude. See, this is what I mean.
01:12:52.712 - 01:13:28.798, Speaker A: This looks so like I've been thinking this is like the worst thing about WorldCoin is that they have this Dystopian Sci-Fi cosmetic layer to the whole system, but they need to scan your iris and then they also need to layer on a bunch of other biometric stuff to make sure that you're not faking it. The crazy innovation about the WorldCoin Orb is not that it's just an iris scanning mechanism. It's an iris scanning mechanism plus like 18 different layers of antifragulant technology. And so it's a bunch of other scanners as well to make sure you're not you need hardware like that.
01:13:28.884 - 01:13:34.190, Speaker B: You need the hardware to look like something. And it just turns out, yes, there's no friendly ways.
01:13:34.340 - 01:14:11.494, Speaker A: What are you going to do? Like try and turn it into a teddy bear? That's like even worse, right? So they came up with the Silver Orb, which it's like the least bad version of how this works anyways. One of the reasons why me and other people have come around slowly to WorldCoin is that people like DC Builder, generally beloved by the community, did not need to be compelled by WorldCoin. But I would call him incredibly neutral builder that got a job at WorldCoin and got compelled by the vision. And there's been a few of those. And so trusting that they are smart people who are making good decisions.
01:14:11.542 - 01:14:21.982, Speaker B: I don't know. There's so many questions still though, too, including the question of Sam Altman. He's already got some scary AI tech, right? Like at least open AI trying to.
01:14:22.116 - 01:14:24.554, Speaker A: Solve for the problem that he's also creating.
01:14:24.682 - 01:14:32.226, Speaker B: Maybe that's why I want to listen. That's why I want to I am in information seeking mode, I would say, about this project.
01:14:32.328 - 01:15:06.282, Speaker A: Speaking of solving AI problems, ethereum Attestation service launch a new feature Attest and verify any type of document or file. Why do you need to do this? Because it's going to be increasingly hard to actually attest to the validity and originality of content in the world these days. And so with the Ethereum Attestation service, you can easily generate a hash of your content and let others verify against the hash to say you are the creator of this content as the originator quick news. Bitrex has filed for bankruptcy. Bittrex in the United States. Good night, sweet prince. That was my first exchange.
01:15:06.282 - 01:15:06.894, Speaker A: Did you know that?
01:15:06.932 - 01:15:09.594, Speaker B: Was it really? Never used bittrex.
01:15:09.722 - 01:15:11.178, Speaker A: It was based in Seattle.
01:15:11.354 - 01:15:37.490, Speaker B: Also, Blockworks announced a big fundraise. So this is the crypto media company that Bankless throws a party with every year. A conference called Permissionless, which, by the way, yeah, you can get tickets to right now. This is Yano. We got a lot wrong over the years, but one thing we got right was our early thesis. As crypto grew exponentially, the industry and its participants would demand better information. And so they built blockworks.
01:15:37.490 - 01:15:51.606, Speaker B: Blockworks, I feel like, is a crypto media that's doing a lot of things right. Like, I'm a big fan of Jason and the team over at Blockworks and Mike and what they're doing. So this is a $12 million raise on $135,000,000 valuation.
01:15:51.718 - 01:15:52.234, Speaker A: Well done.
01:15:52.272 - 01:15:52.570, Speaker B: Wow.
01:15:52.640 - 01:15:53.162, Speaker A: Well done.
01:15:53.216 - 01:15:57.770, Speaker B: Who knew crypto media companies right this valuable? Impressive.
01:15:58.290 - 01:16:12.850, Speaker A: We're doing a Twitter spaces with Jason and Mike, the two founders of Blockworks. So two founders of Bankless, two founders of Blockworks. We're going to talk about crypto media. That's going to be sometime in two weeks from now, unscheduled. But that's going to be pretty cool. So mark your calendars. Even though I didn't give you a date, I think that's going to be a really interesting conversation.
01:16:12.850 - 01:16:14.178, Speaker A: Crypto media.
01:16:14.264 - 01:16:38.406, Speaker B: Yeah, I do too. There's a lot of unique things about crypto that are difficult to get right when you're talking about media jobs. We got jobs of the week here on the Bankless Jobs Awards. I'm going to whip right through them. Bankless Ventures needs an investment analyst, intern sickest job. Coinbase needs a staff blockchain engineer and a smart contract engineer. And Phantom needs a software engineer and a software engineer for front End and mobile.
01:16:38.406 - 01:16:52.874, Speaker B: Premia needs a Web Three product management architect. Lead Dunerai needs a smart contract engineer. Uniswap a whole bunch of jobs, too. Oh, my god. I can't keep up with all of them, but they're all available for you on the Bankless Jobs board. That's bankless palett.com slash jobs.
01:16:52.874 - 01:16:55.598, Speaker B: Get a job in crypto. David, what do we have coming up next?
01:16:55.684 - 01:17:23.674, Speaker A: Coming up next, we got the questions from the nation. Is Eigen layer a threat to ethereum decentralization? We're going to answer that one. As well as the hot takes from crypto, Twitter, and of course the meme of the week, which is extra spicy this week. And we got a moment of Zen, which I think is the coolest marketing stunt that's ever been done by a crypto exchange. Kraken funded this guy to scam scam artists. And so stick around for the moment of Zen. You know, Uniswap, it's the world's largest decentralized exchange with over $1.4
01:17:23.674 - 01:17:48.942, Speaker A: trillion in trading volume. You know this because we talk about it endlessly on Bakelist. It's uniswap. But Uniswap is becoming so much more. Uniswap Labs just released the uniswap mobile wallet for iOS, the newest, easiest way to trade tokens on the go.

01:18:09.042 - 01:18:10.006, Speaker A: There is a link in the show.
01:18:10.028 - 01:18:45.634, Speaker B: Notes this first question is from Leaf on Earth. Is Eigen layer actually a huge danger for ETH decentralization? You've given only the positive side so far, but I found this article quite compelling. They then link to an article from Galaxy which is exploring mev on Eigen layer, pointing out the dangers look at this of cross domain mev and how that could be a threat to the decentralization of Ethereum. So David, what do you think? We've covered the benefits of Eigen layer. Are we downplaying the negatives from it? What would you say to this question?
01:18:45.752 - 01:18:53.778, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that this is pretty prescient and I would say the answer is pretty clearly yes. Is Eigen layer a danger for ETH decentralization?
01:18:53.954 - 01:18:54.582, Speaker B: Yes.
01:18:54.716 - 01:19:42.134, Speaker A: This is a big cause of concern of a lot of the Ethereum core devs, if you will. I know Justin Drake is interested in this, I know Dankrad is interested in this. And I wouldn't say it's just because of cross domain mev. And what that means is mev across blockchains or across systems? If you are staking on multiple systems, there are mev opportunities that you would have that are large compared to if you were just staking on one domain, one blockchain. So that is one concern. Another concern is that if there's a bunch of networks that you are restaking your Ether to, the more networks that you restake your Ether to, the more computational resource requirements are needed to do that. And so if there are a bunch of networks that you need to resake to, you have to have a bigger and beefier computer.
01:19:42.134 - 01:20:24.980, Speaker A: And then also there's more mev opportunities if you are validating more blocks. And so it's just tilts towards economies of scale. And so something like Lido or Coinbase, who has a very large amount of Ether staked, are going to be able to have higher yields because they're going to be able to restake and provide more services in a more professionalized manner and be able to get more yields. So people are going to be like solo staking, I can't compete with Coinbase because they're getting more yield and so they just stake with Coinbase. So yes, I would say that is a concern. I would say this is a similar level of concern that we felt as an ecosystem at the genesis of mev. And then what did we do? We spent three years to research to where we are now, which are in protocol solutions that are on the roadmap to solve for this.
01:20:24.980 - 01:20:34.982, Speaker A: So I don't think that this is a disastrous problem. It is a problem that does need to be addressed. And so I think Leaf on Earth is very prescient and tuned in to some of the issues here.
01:20:35.116 - 01:21:07.070, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. It's something that we'll have to address over the years to come. In fact, you know, our Twitter spaces we did as a follow up to the episode with Justin Drake. He actually brought this up and he thinks that some of the mechanisms from our episode with respect to like, mev smoothing and mev burn, some of those same things can be at play in kind of the restaking mev subset of problems. So I think it's a matter of like the cat and mouse game, right? Mev is a tricky solution. And now it's kind of like migrating. The moloch problems are kind of migrating to restaking.
01:21:07.070 - 01:21:36.506, Speaker B: And so what do we have to do as a community? We have to plug this hole. Maybe this is the last one we have to plug. There will probably be others. I think decentralization is not a one time fight where you design a protocol and you get it right. It's a series of things that you put in place over time to correct and to propagate decentralization and to prevent centralization. All right, David, let's get to what we're bullish on this week. How about you, my friend? What are you bullish on?
01:21:36.688 - 01:21:53.162, Speaker A: There is this new project that has not launched, but they have released a bunch of information about what they are working on. It's called nocturn. And so this is something that swept the Twitter sphere by storm when they released their docs, which is how you know that people are tapping into this.
01:21:53.236 - 01:21:55.118, Speaker B: What is nocturned about documents?
01:21:55.294 - 01:21:56.302, Speaker A: Excited about documents?
01:21:56.366 - 01:21:56.546, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:21:56.568 - 01:22:42.366, Speaker A: So Nocturn is a layer one smart contract that is tapping into innovations in the world of account abstraction to build a private bank account is how I would simplify that in a very simple word. Think of like asset as a layer two. Private layer two, but private bank account on the layer one, a private smart contract. So privacy using zero knowledge cryptography as a private bank account. And so you can put your money into this single smart contract along with everyone else. But kind of like how tornado cash would pull up everyone, but then you would still get to have your claim over your assets and then the smart contract manages it for you, gives you privacy for people who are all using the bank account. And that is privacy on the layer one.
01:22:42.366 - 01:22:56.398, Speaker A: Seems so simple. I don't know why people haven't built this yet. I guess we just needed innovations in cryptography and geo knowledge cryptography. But this is something I'm excited about. Imagine having a private smart contract on the layer one. That's what I'm bullish.
01:22:56.414 - 01:23:26.670, Speaker B: Yeah, because privacy in crypto is largely unsolved. I mean, Bitcoin is completely public. Ethereum is by default completely public. And Aztec is trying to solve it in their own layer two. But what about all of the other layer twos that we use in the day to day? What about the Ethereum main net, right? How do we maintain privacy? So that's what this solves. And of course, tornado cash got recently outlawed for American citizens. The surveillance state ain't going to like this one, David.
01:23:26.670 - 01:23:31.166, Speaker B: I think that's a take here. But we'll have to see how this plays out.
01:23:31.268 - 01:23:34.654, Speaker A: Yeah. Ryan, where do you belt mean, speaking.
01:23:34.692 - 01:23:56.454, Speaker B: Of, I guess the surveillance state. We had a really interesting conversation recording either earlier this week that was not expecting I mean, I knew that the recording was on our calendar. I mean, I wasn't expecting that I would enjoy this conversation so much. It was with Rowan Gray, and this is a guest we had on three years ago, almost. And I don't know how to put this guy in a box, like from.
01:23:56.492 - 01:23:59.414, Speaker A: A worldview you don't know how to categorize him.
01:23:59.532 - 01:24:20.174, Speaker B: Don't. He's uncategorizable, if that's a word. He doesn't like crypto. He doesn't love crypto. And three years ago, we almost had him on in kind of a debate or some what we perceived as, at the time, anti crypto legislation. We had a debate on kind of the merits of crypto versus what he's proposing. I feel like he's come around now.
01:24:20.174 - 01:25:20.562, Speaker B: He has a healthy respect for crypto, which is different, but he's not, I would say, an institutional Republican or an institutional Democrat. I don't think you could characterize him as being right, but calling him like left is not quite right either, because he's not like a kind of the neoliberal type left. But let me tell you what he's fighting for. He's fighting for not a CDBC. He hates the term CDBC because he believes it's been co opted by the central bankers and bankers in general. He's fighting for a digital dollar, an e cash that preserves privacy at the base layer and is available for all citizens of the United States to give people who don't have banks the Unbanked basically a way to preserve a cash type instrument as we migrate to the digital economy, because dollar bills are going away. I mean, that's not going to be a form you can use.
01:25:20.562 - 01:25:57.882, Speaker B: And so in the absence of that, you're just using a CDBC, basically. Right now, if you have dollars in your Wells Fargo account, it's almost like a proto CDBC, because these are really like dollar IOUs. You can't control it. I mean, if Wells Fargo wants to revoke your access because it doesn't like your political opinion or something like mean, they could send you a Dear John letter for any reason. Right. And so this kind of gets away from that, and it preserves that civil liberty. And I guess what was interesting in this conversation, David, is the common cause we found with him that I was not quite expecting.
01:25:57.882 - 01:26:00.458, Speaker B: It was almost like an olive branch.
01:26:00.554 - 01:26:03.538, Speaker A: From the Unholy alliance, which I think.
01:26:03.544 - 01:26:18.434, Speaker B: Is an unholy alliance, and there is some common ground. He isn't completely on board with everything that crypto is. More david has called him status, and that might be the right term for this. He thinks that the government is a.
01:26:18.472 - 01:26:20.614, Speaker A: Solution category for him.
01:26:20.652 - 01:26:32.838, Speaker B: Yeah. Yes. He thinks the government is a solution to far more public goods than I. Think you or I would say, like we would say Ethereum is a public good. And he would say it's not a public good, it's an open permissionless network.
01:26:33.014 - 01:26:35.514, Speaker A: The public is the word for the state.
01:26:35.712 - 01:27:11.974, Speaker B: Yes. And yet even with all of those differences, there's some commonality here. And I don't know, maybe there's another way that we can influence members in Congress and members of government to actually support what we're doing here in Crypto. Because we need some allies. And particularly, I think we need allies in the US on the Democrat side of things. Right. And where are those allies going to come from? It's going to come from those who want to bypass the banks and preserve a digital private cash type money system as we migrate into the digital age.
01:27:11.974 - 01:27:24.506, Speaker B: Crypto can be a part of that. Maybe his idea of a digital dollar and e cash is a part of that as well. But there's an alliance in the making there. I think that's what I'm bullish about. That was kind of an interesting conversation this week.
01:27:24.688 - 01:27:36.142, Speaker A: We have successfully teased three shows on the podcast that are unreleased this week, including the fourth show. That was the Justin Drake episode that we released last week. Man, we're good at our jobs. Yes.
01:27:36.276 - 01:27:45.758, Speaker B: Teasing other shows. That's why you come to the roll up. Let's get to the meme of the week. David, this is Gary learning about a new term, the term OG. Let's take a listen.
01:27:45.844 - 01:27:47.834, Speaker A: Oh, great. Gary awesome.
01:27:47.892 - 01:27:49.234, Speaker C: So what were the letters you said?
01:27:49.272 - 01:27:59.522, Speaker A: OD, OG. Like OG? Yeah. I don't know. Does OG stand for something? I actually don't know what it original. Original Gangster.
01:27:59.586 - 01:28:00.102, Speaker B: Okay.
01:28:00.236 - 01:28:01.942, Speaker A: Original Gangster. Thank you.
01:28:01.996 - 01:28:02.920, Speaker C: Thank you.
01:28:04.330 - 01:28:05.842, Speaker B: I actually love old Gary.
01:28:05.906 - 01:28:07.218, Speaker A: I love old Gary.
01:28:07.314 - 01:28:23.566, Speaker B: This is MIT Gary. And he was actually good. No, it was my how things have changed. David, we've got a moment of Zen of the week. I'm going to fade out with wrist and disclaimers, as usual, but why don't you tee this up for us?
01:28:23.668 - 01:28:40.990, Speaker A: So there is this streamer on Twitch called Kit Boga. Kit Boga show. He's famous for scamming. Scammers. And so Scammers will try and scam him and he will record that and turn it into a stream. And then that's what he does. He's a streamer that just sends scammers on a wild goose chase.
01:28:40.990 - 01:29:08.614, Speaker A: And so he's partnered up with Kraken and Kraken customized a live environment. So it's on Kraken.com, but they made him a fake account so it looks like he is actually sending bitcoins and so the scammers are in on it and then he just messes with them. And it's just first off, this is a marketing stunt by Kraken. And whoever came up with this idea is really creative and is good at their jobs. So props to that person. And this is hilarious.
01:29:08.614 - 01:29:11.194, Speaker A: So that is the moment of Zen you are about to hear.
01:29:11.312 - 01:29:14.638, Speaker B: Everybody wins except the scammers. That's how we like things.
01:29:14.724 - 01:29:19.550, Speaker A: I never knew that scammers could be so vulgar. Ryan, they're rude.
01:29:20.130 - 01:29:21.822, Speaker B: They are rude. They're not nice people.
01:29:21.876 - 01:29:23.120, Speaker A: They're not nice people.
01:29:23.570 - 01:29:35.858, Speaker B: Who would have expected this? Risks and disclaimers guys. All this stuff crypto we're talking about, it's all risky, of course, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
01:29:35.944 - 01:29:40.722, Speaker A: This scammer thinks I'm about to send him $455,000 worth of bitcoin.
01:29:40.786 - 01:29:42.790, Speaker B: But I typed the wrong wallet address.
01:29:42.940 - 01:29:48.578, Speaker A: Why didn't you copy and paste? Might be you typed something wrong. No, I double checked.
01:29:48.594 - 01:29:52.938, Speaker B: It very 3D. You typed the wrong address. I give you the right address.
01:29:53.024 - 01:29:59.738, Speaker A: Still you type the wrong address. BGKP three GK. Where the B is coming from?
01:29:59.824 - 01:30:00.666, Speaker B: I don't know.
01:30:00.768 - 01:30:18.442, Speaker A: I could have swore I know I typed it right. All the support and tell them that was not the right address. How could you mess up this badly? I already gave you the right address. You made the mistake. Why did you do that, Joe? Why'd you pick a three? It looks just like a B. You did it dumb. Literally.
01:30:18.442 - 01:30:35.094, Speaker A: You are the most idiotic, most mother I've at the moment, and I'm that much angry. $450,000? Are you serious right now? That money was supposed to go to.
