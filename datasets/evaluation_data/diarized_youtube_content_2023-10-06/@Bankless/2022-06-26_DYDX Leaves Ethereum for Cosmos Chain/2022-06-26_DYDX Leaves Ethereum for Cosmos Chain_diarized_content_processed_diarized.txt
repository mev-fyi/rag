00:00:00.170 - 00:00:15.802, Speaker A: DyDx chain. They are planning DyDx version four, which is a cosmos chain. So going from Ethereum L2 to a Cosmos zone, and so they tweet out at DyDx, we embrace radical changes in technology that have the potential to dramatically improve the protocol.
00:00:15.866 - 00:00:48.020, Speaker B: I think that the main reason they're doing this is regulatory. In this announcement, in this blog post, they talk a lot about decentralization right now with their starquate implementation of DyDX. They cannot decentralize it because Starquare does not have the ability to have decentralized sequences yet, whereas with a cosmos chain, for example, they can spin up their own validators, they can say token holders can stake their tokens and validate the chain, and then they can kind of say to regulators or anyone that comes knocking, hey, we're actually decentralized. We don't centrally control any part of the protocol when in reality it's not really going to be that decentralized because 50% of the token supply belongs to insiders anyway.
