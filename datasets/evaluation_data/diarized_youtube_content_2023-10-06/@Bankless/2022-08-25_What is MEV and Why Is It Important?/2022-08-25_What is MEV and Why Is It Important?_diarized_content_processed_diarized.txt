00:00:00.170 - 00:00:06.174, Speaker A: Can you tell us why mev is important at a high level and what it is for somebody who is just now hearing about it?
00:00:06.212 - 00:00:42.740, Speaker B: Well, mev is sort of this emergent phenomenon that we've observed on smart contract blockchains when people start to actually use them. What we realize is that there's a lot of different powers that miners have that they can use to extract sort of extra value out of the protocol in ways that the protocol wasn't necessarily designed for ordering censorship and insertion of transactions, looking at basically arbitrage opportunities on decentralized exchanges. And around summer 2020, during DFI Summer, we started seeing a lot of these bots becoming very active to the point where it started having sort of a negative impact on the rest of the system.
