00:00:00.170 - 00:00:43.180, Speaker A: You can only really generate value as an investor if you have a deeper understanding of what's happening than anybody else. Like, effectively, alpha in a market comes from depth of understanding if you can see the actual value of the thing. And there's a disconnect between perception and reality, right? So if the world thinks something is worth X, but it turns out to be worth two X, and that's a delta between perception and reality. And so what you really have to do as an investor across all of the categories that you mentioned, picks and shovels. If you're an early stage equity investor NFTs themselves, if you're more of, like, an art curator, what you really have to do is understand the thing better than anybody else. You have to have some perspective on it that says, actually, reality is different than perception. And that's fundamentally what you're betting on.
00:00:44.750 - 00:01:04.250, Speaker B: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, how to front run the opportunity. This is Ryan Sean Adams, and I'm here to help you become more bankless. Yep, just me on the episode today. No David. He's off escaping to the mountains. If the AI tech was a little bit better, maybe he'd never miss an episode.
00:01:04.250 - 00:01:27.874, Speaker B: I could just beam him in. Unfortunately, we're not there yet, so I had to take this episode on my own. The topic today is about bear market bets. Investor conviction during the bear market. And one thing I'll say at the outset is nothing tests your conviction as an investor like a bear market. In particular, a crypto bear market. I think they can be particularly deep and sinister.
00:01:27.874 - 00:02:02.414, Speaker B: But if you look at this from the right angle, this is actually an opportunity. It's an opportunity to test what you think, you know, to refine your thesis, your ideas, and to make your bets for the next leg up at a lower price point. So that is the topic for today. Avatul and Sanjay are longtime crypto investors. They're the guests in today's episode. They're also VCs at Electric Capital. And I ask them what ideas are they betting on during this bear market? We discuss five of the most pressing questions, I think, that are facing all crypto investors during this bear market, including, number one, l two tokens.
00:02:02.414 - 00:02:44.218, Speaker B: These are layer two tokens. Are layer two tokens actually worth anything? Are they just worthless governance tokens? We get into that. Secondly, we talk about alternative layer ones. Will the ETH killers make a comeback this cycle or not? Number three, we talk about what a MultiChain world really looks like. Will we have millions of layer twos and app chains, or will there be a few big winners? Number four, we talk about restaking. Is restaking a big deal? Is it overhyped? Will it pose an existential risk to ethereum? And number five, Avichel explains why he thinks NFTs are this cycle's altcoins and what he actually means by that. Also, toward the end of the episode, I get in a quick debate with Avicell on the moneyness of Ether.
00:02:44.218 - 00:03:09.026, Speaker B: Ether the asset. He disagrees with me on that. I wish we had some more time for that debate, but we touch it briefly. Perhaps in another episode, we can get into it in more detail. Last thing I'll say before we begin episodes like this are really an opportunity to sharpen your insights as a crypto investor, so you don't have to take these ideas as gospel. Not everything that these investors say will be right. You, of course, have to wrestle with the ideas.
00:03:09.026 - 00:03:31.566, Speaker B: You have to test them. You have to make them your own. And we'll have other bear market episodes with other perspectives, so this certainly isn't the last word. All right, guys, we're going to get right to the episode on bear market bets with Avatar and Sanjay from Electric Capital. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible, including our number one recommended crypto exchange, Kraken. Go create an Account kraken Pro has.

00:04:07.296 - 00:05:17.566, Speaker C: Mantle, formerly known as Bitdao, is the first dowled web3 ecosystem, all built on top of Mantle's first core product, the Mantle Network, a brand new high performance ethereum layer two, built using the Op stack but uses Eigen layer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer one. Not only does this reduce Mantle network's gas fees by 80%, but it also reduces gas fee volatility, providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications. The Mantle Treasury is one of the biggest Dow owned Treasuries, which is seeding an ecosystem of projects from all around the web3 space for Mantle. Mantle already has subcommunities from around web3 onboarded, like game Seven for web3 gaming, and Bybit for TVL and Liquidity and Onram. So if you want to build on the Mantle Network, mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone based funding to promising projects that help expand, secure and decentralize Mantle. If you want to get started working with the first dowled layer two ecosystem, check out Mantle at mantle XYZ and follow them on Twitter at Zero xmantle Arbitrum is accelerating the Web Three landscape with a suite of secure Ethereum Scaling solutions, hundreds of projects have already deployed onto Arbitrum One. With a flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystem, arbitram Nova is quickly becoming a Web Three gaming hub.
00:05:17.566 - 00:06:03.754, Speaker C: And social DApps like Reddit are also calling Arbitrum home. And now Arbitrum Orbit allows you to use arbitrum's Secure Scaling technology to build your own layer three, giving you access to interoperable customizable permissions. With dedicated throughput all of these technologies leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum, and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible. Faster transaction speeds and significantly lower gas fees. Are you a dev but you don't know solidity?

00:06:03.802 - 00:06:29.346, Speaker B: I'm super excited to introduce you to our next guests, avical Garg and Sanjay Shah. Avichel is the founder of Electric Capital, and Sanjay is one of the investors at the VC firm called Electric Capital. You probably know them from their incredible annual crypto Developer report they put out every single year. The most recent, I think, was put out in January. I don't miss. This measures all of the dev and dev activity across crypto. Avichel and Sanjay.
00:06:29.346 - 00:06:31.554, Speaker B: Welcome to Bankless, Ryan.
00:06:31.602 - 00:06:33.240, Speaker D: Thanks, Ryan. Nice to be here.
00:06:33.950 - 00:07:21.494, Speaker B: I'm excited to do this episode here and now in 2023, summer of 2023, when we are I think most listeners would agree we are in the bear market. And the reason bear markets are interesting to me is they are this fiery crucible where our investment ideas actually get tested, where we actually have an opportunity to kind of rebuild our ideas from the ground up and place our bets accordingly. So I want to ask a few questions today. I've got five teed up and then maybe some bonus questions if we get some time. I think these questions are some of the biggest, most important questions that crypto investors are asking during this bear market. So I want to get your thoughts on this, the thesis that you're sort of rebuilding during the bear market and really get a sense for your conviction what you're convicted on. Does that sound okay?
00:07:21.612 - 00:07:25.686, Speaker A: That sounds great, actually. And maybe before we get into all that, we can do the standard disclaimer.
00:07:25.718 - 00:07:27.370, Speaker B: Of, oh, yeah, you got to do that. Right.
00:07:27.440 - 00:07:33.246, Speaker A: Go for it. This is not financial advice. You should not listen to anything we have to say, basically about anything.
00:07:33.428 - 00:07:37.198, Speaker B: That's great. That goes for me too. All right.
00:07:37.364 - 00:07:45.118, Speaker A: Don't listen to us about anything. None of this is financial advice. And beyond this is not advice. This is not life advice. Don't listen.
00:07:45.204 - 00:07:56.420, Speaker B: It's not life advice. I don't know what it is. It's another category. It's just a conversation. Hopefully you're entertained a conversation amongst friends. Yeah. So a few of the conversation starters then, amongst friends.
00:07:56.420 - 00:08:18.746, Speaker B: Some of these questions are, I think, controversial questions, actually, which is among the most interesting. But I'm going to tee these up the first five to give listeners a sneak peek into where we're headed. All right, the first question I want to ask is about layer two tokens. Are they worthless governance tokens is the question. Second question, want to get into ETH. Will the ETH. Killers make a comeback? Alternative layer ones.
00:08:18.746 - 00:08:48.482, Speaker B: Number three, I want to talk about layer twos. Are we going to live in a world where there's millions of chains or just a few big winners? Number four, I want to talk about restaking. Is restaking eigen layer all of these things? Is it a big deal or is it overhyped? Is it an existential crisis for ethereum? And then number five, NFTs. Man, they've been down bad recently. I don't know if you guys have noticed, but are they dead or will they make a comeback? So that's a little agenda item. I got some surprise bonus questions for you as well. Why don't we start though, with the big question.
00:08:48.482 - 00:09:19.200, Speaker B: I think part of the reason I wanted to have you both on the podcast, sanjay, you wrote fantastic blog post about layer two value capture. And let me just frame the question and you put it nicely at the beginning of your post. The question is these layer two tokens worth many billions of dollars? Double digit billions of dollars? I don't think triple digit billions of dollars. Are they actually worth anything right now or are they just worthless governance tokens? I'll throw it to either one of you. How do you think about this question right now?
00:09:20.450 - 00:09:56.934, Speaker D: Yeah, to me the way I sort of think about it is it always comes back to cash flows at the end of the day. So you always have to say, okay, let's look at this from a fundamental perspective and where are the cash flow is going to come from? And I think that if you really dig deep into layer twos, there are very concrete sources that they can actually generate sustainable cash flows and sustainable profits and happy to sort of dig deeper into this. But just based on that idea alone, there is a real fundamental basis for why these tokens should have values based on cash flows.
00:09:56.982 - 00:10:03.318, Speaker B: So there's cash flows just like a company, just like any type of business, these layer twos actually have a product that they're selling.
00:10:03.414 - 00:10:43.802, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I would add one thing to that too, is this is how we model things internally is ultimately cash flows. Because if there's no cash flow coming out of the thing, then what is the thing actually worth? And finance in general or investing in general? That's like the great normalizer. It's like what are the cash flows coming out? And what kind of discount rate do I apply to that cash flow? And then I can start to normalize across things like bonds and stocks and tokens. And so I would add maybe two or three nuances or dimensions to this. So, one, just because a thing has cash flow doesn't make it a security. And I think this gets into a lot of nitty gritty about regulatory, but we firmly believe that there are ways to have cash flows coming out of these without necessarily making them security.
00:10:43.856 - 00:10:45.530, Speaker B: Did you hear that? Gary gensler.
00:10:49.150 - 00:11:29.186, Speaker A: It gets into sort of how we test, and there's a lot we could go there, but I think it's important people not necessarily conflate cash flow with security. Those are actually two different things. Second is, I think what's really interesting about crypto is the global nature of it. And so the fact that there's so much capital all over the world that would like to be able to invest in cash flow assets or any sort of asset outside of their local fiat regime, and that's actually, for most of the world is not possible. Most of the world can't easily access US. Equities, for example. And so our belief is there's actually a lot of latent demand all over the world for these kinds of assets that are sort of they exist outside any singular jurisdiction.
00:11:29.186 - 00:12:10.518, Speaker A: Like ETH doesn't exist only inside the United States. And that's actually what makes it so compelling, too, from like a global perspective, is that there are a lot of people who otherwise would not be able to participate, that can participate. And I think the framing that you had around conviction at the front end is really compelling. And I think one of the things that we personally have not lost conviction on, but I think in the bull market really gets lost in the noise and tends to come back in the bear markets, is that that's fundamentally what this stuff is about. It's about empowering people all over the world to participate in these open systems. And that's what's so interesting about the L two S, is there are actually ways for people to participate all over the world and capture value in that in a way that doesn't make them security, but still has cash flow. Which I think is actually that's like one of the interesting breakthroughs, by the.
00:12:10.524 - 00:12:26.666, Speaker B: Way, just on the cash flow, but not security. Just a brief segue here. So there are other real world assets like this, right? So let's say you have property. I own a house. I'm a landlord. Well, that is a cash flow producing asset. That's not a security.
00:12:26.666 - 00:12:40.286, Speaker B: I have to register that thing with the SEC. There are tons of categories in the real world pre crypto that actually fit this mold of being a cash flow, but not a security. How come people are so hung up on this?
00:12:40.468 - 00:13:20.474, Speaker A: Yeah, well, it goes to this general problem of like our regulatory frameworks tend to have been designed with certain use cases in mind. This is why you have to be really careful with regulation. I think I spent a lot of time on the regulatory side. I think some people know this in conversations with senators and congresspeople and people at the White House and so on. And there are a lot of good people in the ecosystem that spent a lot of time behind the scenes on this stuff. And I think one of the challenges is that you don't want to bake technology solutions into the regulations. And every now and then, every 50 or 100 years, a new technology comes along and it sort of breaks your mental model of what's possible.
00:13:20.474 - 00:13:55.270, Speaker A: I think AI and crypto are kind of are going to both face this right now because I'll give you one concrete example, right? This stuff doesn't really exist inside a singular jurisdiction. And that creates a whole new dimension of challenges. From a regulator's perspective, ETH is not a thing that exists only in the United States or only in Europe. It exists cross jurisdictionally because it lives in the cloud. So anywhere there's a server, this thing can exist. And I think that creates a whole host of challenges because our entire regulatory framework has been based around the notion of a nation state with physical geographic boundaries and capital controls. And this really starts to break a lot of that.
00:13:55.270 - 00:14:44.194, Speaker A: AI is similar in all sorts of ways, right? Like, should an AI pay taxes? It's kind of unclear. And if it pays taxes, who does it pay taxes to? Because it can run on any server anywhere. So what does that mean, right? Does the question even make sense? And this happens every now and then, and I've talked about this in other contexts, but to me, crypto, the idea of this non jurisdictional coordination mechanism, the last time we really had to face something like this was with the invention of the joint stock corporation, which was like 1650. It was like, oh, we can put money together and take risk without it being my personal property at risk. And before that, you just had the cottage industry. And so between like 1650 and 1850, we put a lot of regulations in place around how that should work. And it used to basically be that only kings could give you a charter to go start a corporation.
00:14:44.194 - 00:15:14.574, Speaker A: And around 1850 we said, wait a second, that doesn't make any sense. Anybody should be able to start a corporation. And so we created entirely new regulation that said, oh, here's what it means to register a company. And that unlocked the industrial revolution. Like the reason railroads could get built is because a bunch of people could pool capital at a scale that wasn't previously possible from one human. And I actually think a lot of crypto and AI, it's like the first time in 150 or 200 years that we've had to face this kind of a problem, which is like, it just breaks our existing model of regulation in a lot of fundamental ways. And so we need to rethink it.
00:15:14.574 - 00:15:37.990, Speaker A: I know that's like super high level meta, but that to me is what makes this so interesting, because the properties of this stuff are truly Internet native in a way that I don't think we've ever experienced before. And that creates a whole host of challenges downstream, one of which is, well, how can you have a cash flow entity that a bunch of people participate in that? I can track that. I know exactly what my cash flow stream is going to be, but it's not a security. And I think that's one of the side effects of this new technology.
00:15:38.060 - 00:15:42.520, Speaker B: Well, regulatory is going to be one of the bonus questions we get to.
00:15:43.050 - 00:15:44.122, Speaker A: There's a lot to unpack there.
00:15:44.176 - 00:16:16.130, Speaker B: There's so much to unpack there. But I don't know that it's exactly comforting that it took us like, about 200 years from the joint stock company, first joint stock company to get the regulation in order. I hope crypto can happen at a way faster. Yeah, all right, we'll get to that too. But okay, bullcase. I think what you just gave was sort of the bullcase for maybe these capital assets that are tokens in general, right? Which is they're global, they're digital, they're cash flow producing assets that aren't security. Anyone with an Internet connection can own one of these things.
00:16:16.130 - 00:16:46.830, Speaker B: Well, how cool is that? All right, but so there's another piece here, though, that I want to get to is just because there is a token out there that can accrue value doesn't mean it's sort of set up to actually accrue value. So this idea of cash flows is like, where does the revenue come from for a layer two? Maybe you guys could give us a refresher. Samjay, you could give us a refresher on how roll ups make money today. How do they actually generate revenue?
00:16:47.730 - 00:17:12.722, Speaker D: Yeah, in the future, roll ups, I think, will generate value from sort of two different streams, mev and transaction fees. Today roll ups don't actually generate any revenues from mev because the sequencers are centralized. So optimism Arbitrum, and of course, they don't want to be extractive to their users, so they've decided, hey, we're not going to extract any mev.
00:17:12.786 - 00:17:21.306, Speaker B: So they've just turned it off, basically, yeah. As a centralized sequencer, they could charge some fees for mev and for transaction fees, but they've just set it to zero right now.
00:17:21.328 - 00:17:55.826, Speaker D: Is that correct for me? Yes. And then, of course, they are charging transaction fees. And so that's the primary source of revenue today for layer twos. So that's today. And in the future, let's speak to both sides of those. So for the mev, that can be turned on in the future, and I think that could be a sizable form of revenue for roll ups. And so in the blog post, I sort of put a little bit of a framing around this.
00:17:55.826 - 00:18:51.298, Speaker D: So there's sort of like good mev and bad mev, and good sort of harmful mev is anything that's sort of harmful to the user. So let's say a sandwich attack, et cetera. And bad mev is, yeah, exactly, thank you for bringing this up. And then sort of bad mev is good mev is something that actually helps the ecosystem. So, for example, an Arbitrage helps keep prices consistent across different DEXes. And so sort of my view is that as far as mev, I think the harmful sort of mev will ultimately be sort of either mitigated or rebated back to users. And sort of like, why do I say that? Well, one, businesses, there's like a line I have in the post, which is like, typically businesses don't really gain adoption by screwing their users.
00:18:51.298 - 00:19:25.230, Speaker D: That's not a good strategy. And so I think it's the same way with blockchains. And so there's sort of incentive at every layer of this, whether it's talking about wallets, whether you're talking about the roll ups themselves, whether you're talking about shared sequencers like, hey, let's figure out a way to get rid of these sandwich attacks. Let's figure out a way to sort of mitigate this harmful sort of form of mev. And I think right now there's like twelve different projects that are working on trying to do this. And so I think with so many people sort of working on this, I feel fairly good that we're going to figure out a way to sort of combat that.
00:19:25.300 - 00:20:07.534, Speaker B: Okay, so let's break this down a little bit for people and spend some more time on kind of definitions to make sure we've got everyone with us today. So you think that the sources of revenue for roll ups, the way they make money, are two form mev and transaction fees. And then we just went into mev for a second, defining mev for a second. This is basically block ordering. There's some value for anyone who is sending a transaction or doing something on chain on one of these layer twos in getting their transaction in first, and it turns out that we can sell that value. And layer twos indeed can in the future start selling that value. I believe that's what you're saying here.
00:20:07.534 - 00:21:10.370, Speaker B: And there are two forms of not the selling of that value, but I guess maybe the effect of blockchain ordering, maybe you can find better words for this. One is there's harmful blockchain ordering, so you're calling that harmful mev and then there's good mev. And what you're saying, Sanjay, is you think that the harmful mev will actually be mitigated over time, so that the layer two designers will effectively try to minimize that as much as possible and or rebate it to users. So if you're a user in MetaMask, you're committing a transaction, there's some future world where you actually receive some of the proceeds of that transaction in the form of a rebate. You get kind of your mev money back. That's what you think will happen to harmful the good mev. You think these layer twos will effectively take in the form of revenue under that mev category, is that right so far? What would you add to that definition, those definitions? And also can you give us some examples of harmful versus good mev?
00:21:11.350 - 00:21:43.486, Speaker D: Yeah, so that's exactly right. I think you phrased it really well. So let me give you an example of harmful mev is like a sandwich attack. So for example, you want to go and you want to buy an asset on a Dex, let's say Ether. Someone sees your trade incoming, they're going to actually put in an order to trade that asset ahead of you and then your order will actually push the price up. And then on the back of that they'll actually sell what they bought. So they've just made money sort of risk free.
00:21:43.486 - 00:22:25.094, Speaker D: And you as a user, you've actually gotten to execute at a worse price. So that's probably the most sort of common, prominent example of harmful mev. And then as far as sort of good or beneficial mev, like one example is just arbitrage. So if you have different DEXes on a roll up or across roll ups, you obviously want prices to be the same or consistent across the different DEXes. That's good for users. Liquidations is another example of beneficial mev. You want people to get liquidated as soon as possible, which helps the protocols not accrue bad debt.
00:22:25.094 - 00:23:08.402, Speaker D: And so the faster that can happen, the better. And so that's another example of beneficial mev. One good example is sort of like how I see this playing out. There's a new shared sequencer radius that has sort of come out in the last couple of months and they're sort of implementing this thing where they're using encryption to actually block sort of this harmful mev. So using encryption, nobody can see what your transactions are. And then after sort of transactions, some sort of transactions are finalized, then they're actually running an auction to allow people to backrun these transactions. And so they're essentially blocking the front running of transactions which allow for the sandwiches, et cetera.
00:23:08.402 - 00:23:18.906, Speaker D: And they're running an auction to sort of optimize the back running of the transactions which allow for arbitrage and liquidations, et cetera. So sort of in line with sort of this framework that I've laid out.
00:23:19.008 - 00:24:30.926, Speaker B: So how does this mev we'll talk about transaction fees as the other pocket of kind of revenue in a second, but just for mev in general right now, you said the sequencers are kind of centralized, haven't turned the dials on, so no one's actually charging for this. In the future they could, but how does this get to value in the token? If you're a token holder of something like the Arbitrum token or the optimism token or something like that. How do you experience that value? One way in the Ethereum ecosystem that holders experience value is through EIP 15, five, nine, the burn effectively, where supply is kind of destroyed. In the world of capital assets, I mentioned a property that I might hold and I might get a rental income from that. So my asset actually generates income that I can take home. It's not quite a dividend, but it's sort of a dividend, I suppose. Can an arbor optimism or layer two token holder expect to sort of receive this as a share of income? Or is it burnt or is there some other mechanism at play here to actually link the token itself to this value creation mechanism?
00:24:31.118 - 00:25:33.238, Speaker D: Yeah, I think any of the above, and I think different layer twos are going to experiment with different models. So you could burn it, you could give it as a dividend, you could invest it in retroactive public goods, which ostensibly will then increase the value on the protocol further. How I expect it to happen in practice is through some sort of like, auction mechanism. Right now you have a centralized sequencer and so it's sort of like up to the goodwill, I guess, of the sequencer to sort of give that back and how much to give back. Inevitably. I think that once you have sort of auctions, just like you have at the proposer layer on Ethereum, where builders are actually competing to get proposers to choose their block in the same way, I think you'll have people competing to build a block. And then that value will then go back to the protocol and they can choose what to do with it, what they want.
00:25:33.324 - 00:26:06.754, Speaker B: Okay, so you think mev will be a big source of revenue here. Let's talk about transaction fees, which is the second kind of source of revenue of value creation, value capture here. So how do layer twos today charge transaction fees inside of their ecosystems? I'm going to pull up a screen just to kind of start this conversation. I believe that was in your blog post. This is arbitram annualized revenue. If you've never looked at kind of arbitram from this perspective, I encourage you. This is the way that investors should and are looking at this.
00:26:06.754 - 00:26:38.234, Speaker B: This is, I believe, a set of metrics from May of this year. And this says Arbitrum annualized revenue. If you annualize arbitram's revenue in May of 2023, this is in a bear market, mind you, we get 115,000,000 in annualized revenue, revenue being the term for kind of the top line. Right. So this is not necessarily profit. We could talk about the costs of the arbitram business or a capital asset, if that's what we want to call it. But revenue $115,000,000.
00:26:38.234 - 00:26:44.590, Speaker B: And I believe this is from transaction fees. Can you explain this a little bit, Sanjay?
00:26:44.930 - 00:27:23.782, Speaker D: Yeah, it's very impressive. Yeah. Essentially currently layer two sort of break down their costs into sort of like an L One cost. So what are they paying to Ethereum for essentially the data availability, and then there's sort of an L two operational cost, essentially, like, how much does it cost to actually sort of operate the chain, et cetera. And then there's an L2 gas fee, which essentially makes up the transaction fee. So that's how sort of the revenue model works today. And it's sort of broken down into these three chunks.
00:27:23.782 - 00:27:42.880, Speaker D: I think the way that it can be broken down in the future can sort of be different. Like, it doesn't actually have to be on a menu where, here's your L One cost, here's your L two operating cost, here's your L2 fee. But I think those basic components are going to always be baked in there.
00:27:43.250 - 00:28:11.410, Speaker B: And is the way to look at this like a layer two is essentially a value added reseller of layer one block space? Is that what they're doing? They're basically taking something like arbitrary optimism is basically taking the Ethereum block space and creating another layer of feature functionality value on top of it, and then charging for that in the form of transaction fees and then also mev. Is that what's going on here?
00:28:11.580 - 00:29:14.998, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's a reasonable way to think about it. I think one of the sort of mental models that I wanted to at least put out there with this is that I think some people think, like, okay, EIP 4844 is coming. Block space is going to drastically reduce. And so as a result of that, okay, yeah, Arbitrum's revenues look great right now, but that's just because L One data fees are super expensive right now. And once L One data fees plummet, like, hey, arbitram's revenues are going to go down the toilet because maybe they're just making a ten or 15% margin on top of what the L One is charging. And sort of the model that we can get into it that I at least sort of propose here is, hey, that's not actually true, because there's actually some block space that's actually valuable on the L2, and they don't actually have to price it at just, like, a fixed percentage above what the L One block space is. So as an example, like, if you getting coffee at Starbucks, just because it costs Starbucks ten cents to make it, that doesn't mean you're paying $0.10
00:29:14.998 - 00:29:32.642, Speaker D: or $0.11. You could be paying $5 or $10 for a cup of coffee. And so I think it's going to essentially be sort of similar in the L2 block space. I think you guys have a pretty famous saying right, which is blockchain sell block space. Right. And I think it's very similar to L two block space as well.
00:29:32.776 - 00:30:02.730, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a lot of people don't understand how layer twos actually make money and how much value is created here. And Avijal, I wonder, from your perspective, what this sort of looks like. Right. So there are multiple analogs that we could use. Yes, we have said on Bankless many times, is a mental model, blockchains sell blocks. That's the thing that they do just because it's a simplification. I feel like so many times the crypto investing world gets stuck on narrative value, meme value.
00:30:02.730 - 00:30:23.986, Speaker B: And it's helpful to view this as almost like a company. Right. So what does Apple sell? They sell iPhones. Right. How do they create value? Well, they take all of these commodity type components and they create an incredible user experience in a phone that you can use and apps that give you value to everyday life. And they're able to charge $1,000 per phone. Right.
00:30:23.986 - 00:30:55.070, Speaker B: It's kind of amazing. And so looking at these layer twos almost as kind of like companies, they're not securities, but maybe from the perspective of there is something that all of them are trying to sell. They're trying to make their block space as valuable as possible. And to Sanjay's point, they can charge whatever they want for that, whatever the market is willing to pay. And so that's one model of looking at it. The other way to look at it, though, is as an emerging economy. It's almost like the nation state type model.
00:30:55.070 - 00:31:23.298, Speaker B: Right. And another analog we've used is think of like a province in a nation or like a state in the United States, the state of California, and there's a federal government. That federal government in the lt world is maybe Ethereum. It has its own currency, but then there's a state's economy, the state of California, and it can create value. So you're almost valuing as emerging economy. Make sense of this. How do you think of layer twos?
00:31:23.394 - 00:31:59.682, Speaker A: Yeah, so two thoughts on this. So I think your second point around thinking of these things as digital countries and states is exactly right. That's very much the conclusion I've come to. We wrote a paper about Ethereum as a digital country a few years ago and sort of as a little bit of a detour into that for a second. I think that's actually what the like, if you think about what the world wants and kind of what happened after Russia invaded Ukraine and the US flipped on sanctions, what the world kind of realized was that the economy of the world, international trade, commodities trade, pricing, all this stuff runs on US. Dollars. But ultimately the US.
00:31:59.682 - 00:32:02.082, Speaker A: Can shut you out of that economy if they feel like it.
00:32:02.216 - 00:32:03.266, Speaker B: And that's really scary, right?
00:32:03.288 - 00:32:30.950, Speaker A: If you're Turkey, if you're India, if you're Brazil, what the world actually wants is a US dollar denominated system because they don't necessarily want to be beholden to the Chinese government either and denominate things in CNY. And you're seeing a little bit of a move towards that. And so what the world actually wants is a US. Dollar denominated system that the US. Government cannot unilaterally shut them out of. That's effectively credibly, neutral and sufficiently decentralized such that you can get the bad actors but that you can't be shut out unilaterally. And that's effectively what Ethereum is becoming.
00:32:30.950 - 00:33:43.780, Speaker A: And so our sort of, like, long term view on this is Ethereum is slowly evolving into this third space which is not the US. Space, which is not the Chinese space but is this sort of credibly, neutral, decentralized space. And I think your analogy of if that's kind of like the federal government in a sense or that's the country then l Two start to behave a little bit like states. And if you think about how a state like California operates and what they're able to do in effect, why does California have such high taxes? Or why can Apple charge a 30% tax? It's because they have pricing power, right? So the general term for this of it not collapsing to the commodity price of the compute power on the thing which is, I think, a thing that a lot of technologists and economists both miss. They think of these things as purely computational networks and therefore they don't have pricing power. But there are forms of pricing power that states and companies have which are really interesting, right? So, like, for example, California essentially having a monopoly on useful coastline on the West Coast like all these beautiful beaches and Big Sur and it's a beautiful place to live means that real estate is tremendously valuable. And as a result, there's this source of income which they effectively have a monopoly on which allows them to do a lot of other things.
00:33:43.780 - 00:34:06.860, Speaker A: Or there's brand value, right? Like, why do people pay for an $8 cup of coffee? Why do they go to Blue Bottle? Whatever? Yeah, it tastes better. But part of it is the experience. Part of it is the brand. Part of it is the ethos. You're holding the cup. You're being seen by other people. So there are these emotional motivators or there are network effects, right? And so, like, Silicon Valley is a network effect around capital which has been written about many, many times.
00:34:06.860 - 00:34:38.466, Speaker A: Entrepreneurs will generally relocate to where they can get great capital. And there's so much tribal knowledge about how to build companies in Silicon Valley that it's not a surprise that sort of that network effect continues to perpetuate. Crypto being a really interesting counterexample we could talk about. And if you look at the L2 S, they kind of have all of these, right? There are network effects in terms of, like, DFI all being on Arbitrum right now. Or there are technical modes like actually building an iPhone is really hard. And so you look at something like Starkware and that you might argue that's a real technical mode. There's just not that many people that could build a ZK based system or ZK sync.
00:34:38.466 - 00:35:03.574, Speaker A: You look at brand effects. And so if all the cool kids are in one place for the NFTs, then that's where all the NFTs will be. That's where the creators will want to be. So they're going to be these different forms of pricing power that these networks have on top of the L One. That's going to allow them to have some spread there, I think. And I hadn't heard somebody talk about it as a state on top of the federal government, but I think that's a great analogy. And I think states like California or New York or Washington, DC.
00:35:03.574 - 00:35:18.190, Speaker A: Where you have this combination of network effects because of the industries that are there, the company towns, effectively, the brand value, it's like if you want to do anything in government, you have to be in DC. Like, that's where the network is. That's where the flow is. And that gives them pricing power. And I think l two S will behave very similarly.
00:35:18.350 - 00:35:58.910, Speaker B: That's super fascinating. And just maybe to extend this a little bit further, this line of thought, because what you were saying kind of brought some thoughts up in my mind. So I think what you're saying is that layer twos are a bit more like California than they are like Apple. But where that? I think that mental model falls apart for people is there's no way right now to invest in do. How would I invest in the California economy, right, yeah. If you had a token that represented that or some sort of asset that represented that, it would probably be the value of California's tax base, I guess.
00:35:58.980 - 00:36:01.006, Speaker A: Yeah, there's another example.
00:36:01.108 - 00:36:01.838, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead.
00:36:01.924 - 00:36:09.998, Speaker A: Like Alaska, right? So you get an oil rebate. So the state has all this oil revenue coming in and they just refund it via tax revenue back to the citizens.
00:36:10.014 - 00:36:44.094, Speaker B: Right, yeah. I wonder if there was some sort of composed asset that gave you an index of all of California's property assets, let's say, for instance. And then also the the number of publicly traded companies that were all based in California, something like that, that could almost give you a proxy for what an investment in California would look like. But we don't really have that at the state level or even at the nation state level. I guess the best proxy for investing in the United States is probably buying the SP or something like that. Nasdaq, something like that. Right.
00:36:44.094 - 00:37:19.170, Speaker B: But you sure wouldn't want to buy the dollar. Maybe that's what you guys are saying. These L2 tokens are they're effectively they're an investment in this emerging network state, let's call it. And just like if you live in California and they're not providing the services, it's not worth it. The network effects aren't worth it. You can defect and you can move to Texas, for example. Well, all of the different layer twos are competitive with one another and they have to provide the network effect, the services or the population, the applications on top will kind of defect.
00:37:19.170 - 00:37:25.658, Speaker B: I think the analog kind of holds. So is this making sense or are we stretching the metaphor too far?
00:37:25.744 - 00:38:06.920, Speaker A: Well, it's a little bit stretched and I mean it's one of the things that's generally tricky about technology, early stage technology is like we have to reason through analogy and schemorphically. Like if you remember the original iPhone apps were all kind of like leather and paper because that's like all we were used to when it came to touch. And so we're like, well if it's a flat screen, let's make it look like paper and leather. But that just doesn't make any sense actually. So I think it is a little bit stretched but I think analogs are still illustrative, they can still teach you things. So I do think there's a lot to that. I think the idea that there are network facts, the idea that there is a notion of brand, there's community, there's cultural alignment and so by choosing to live in San Francisco, you're making sort of like a cultural statement about your values as much as you are physically where you choose to live.
00:38:06.920 - 00:38:55.254, Speaker A: So I think a lot of those drivers will exist in all twos as well. And then I think your point around what is the ease of switching given that all of these things are EVM right now on top of ethereum and the ease of sort of moving things around. I think at least in the early days it's sort of like if I could effectively pick up and move to Nevada or Texas or Florida without having to uproot my entire family and would I do that? I think a lot of people would actually consider doing that. So by lowering the difference, I guess here with the L two S is the switching cost is significantly lowered as the infrastructure gets better and better. Like I can just use optimism or Arbitrum as an end user or if I as a developer can just move my code because it's all EVM and it basically works the same way everywhere, then the switching costs are significantly lower than they are in the physical world.
00:38:55.372 - 00:39:26.210, Speaker B: So to answer this first question, and the question I think people investors are rightly asking during the bear market, are layer two tokens valuable? You guys are saying hell yeah, they're valuable. Just look at the on chain revenue profile. In fact, for those saying that it's impossible to value different crypto assets, I think you guys are saying you can actually value this as a capital asset and forecast revenue and profit over time and plug in the numbers and Excel a spreadsheet and it'll give you the valuation. Is that what you're saying here?
00:39:26.360 - 00:39:56.986, Speaker A: Well, one caveat there is I think everybody should do their own math on this and figure out whether or not that's actually true. But the general statement I think definitely holds, which is you can absolutely make an assertion here that there can be cash flow coming out of this thing. There is some sort of pricing power. You can figure out what your assumptions might be for that, what the costs are for running the network. And there's certainly a spreadsheet model that you could produce here that would produce positive cash flow out to token holders over some period of time. That doesn't necessarily make it a great investment. That doesn't necessarily mean that people should do it.
00:39:56.986 - 00:40:07.806, Speaker A: It's extremely risky. But that's generally how we think about these things, is like, if there isn't ultimately going to be cash flow coming out of it, the market in the long term will not value the thing.
00:40:07.908 - 00:40:08.270, Speaker B: Anything.
00:40:08.340 - 00:40:46.678, Speaker D: Yeah, the only thing I'd add is I think they'll be valuable, but the ones that will be the most valuable are the ones that can generate sort of like a unique state that cannot easily you cannot easily just move to another roll up and get it. So if you think of if you have a roll up that's sort of like the DFI hub, let's say the New York of L two S, right? You can't just go to Texas or you just can't go to Chicago and sort of get that same liquidity, et cetera. And so any of the roll ups that can actually build this sort of unique state that cannot easily be replicated are going to be the most valuable.
00:40:46.774 - 00:41:33.290, Speaker B: Well, then, I think that brings me to the second question that I highlighted earlier, which is another question for the bear market right now, where everyone's trying to test their theses forecast the future of L. Two S for us, there are two paths, and I'll give them to you in their most exaggerated forms that we can discuss. The one side of the spectrum versus the other. There could be a world where we live in with millions of different chains and layer twos. Or there could be a world we live in where there are few winners with kind of big network effects. Right? So which of those is the most likely outcome? Like, one is a world where we might have tons of app chains. There aren't any really too many generalized chains.
00:41:33.290 - 00:41:57.934, Speaker B: I don't know if you could put some more color on that. But the other is a world where there's a few big megachains that kind of win like DeFi NFT use cases. They all sort of accrue to a couple of megachains. We're sort of seeing that, I think, on the main chain layer one side of things, but we'll get into that discussion next. So what do you think? Millions of L two S or a few big winners of eachel? What do you think about this?
00:41:58.052 - 00:42:13.540, Speaker A: Yeah, this is actually probably one of the things I've most changed my mind on over the last two years. Mistakenly assumed there would be some sort of power law the way I think the the l ones will have a power law where ETH is really big. Maybe the cosmos ecosystem can be big.
