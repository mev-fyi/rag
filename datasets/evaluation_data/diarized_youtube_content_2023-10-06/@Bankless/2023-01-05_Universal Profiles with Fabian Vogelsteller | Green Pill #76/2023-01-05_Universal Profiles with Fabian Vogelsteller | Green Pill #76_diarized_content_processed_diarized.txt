00:00:05.690 - 00:01:03.198, Speaker A: What up, coordination? How you doing on the pod today? We got Fabian, who is wow, he's just such an OG. I mean, Fabian was one of the co authors of ERC 20, which is the standard that all tokens well, all fungible tokens on the Ethereum network use. And well, not all, but there's there's substandards that are derived from ERC 20. But ERC 20 is kind of like the Godfather or the godmother of tokens on the Ethereum network. Fabian is also the author of ERC 725, which is a standard around identity on the Ethereum network. And if you've been following season two of the Green Pill podcast, you know that we're talking a lot about decentralized identity and how it can create a more Green Pilled world by allowing us to track our interactions with each other, create more positive sum games through repeat interactions. Fabian was also involved in the Mist Project, which is before MetaMask, and infura one of the ways that you could integrate with the Web three based web.
00:01:03.198 - 00:01:46.330, Speaker A: And he's just been a lead engineer thinker in the Ethereum space for the last half a decade. And that's exciting to me because we're now not pushing forward standards for tokens and missed browsers and stuff like that. We're now pushing on universal identity and account abstraction. And so this episode, we're basically covering the opportunity space of identity and creating new token standards. And also Fabian's working on this layer one called the Luxo Network that is going to put a lot of these ideas in practice. They have some really beautiful APIs designs. Fabian was right and in the right place in a lot of things in the past of Ethereum.
00:01:46.330 - 00:02:05.262, Speaker A: So that gives me a lot of confidence that he's going to be in the right place and onto something when it comes to identity and some of the trends that we're following on the Green Pill podcast. So Fabian is just a gigabrain. He's really smart. He's an engineer. He also speaks marketing. He also understands the space really well. And so I think this was a really fun episode.
00:02:05.262 - 00:02:08.726, Speaker A: So without further ado, I give you Fabian. Enjoy.
00:02:08.828 - 00:02:46.990, Speaker B: The Glow Dollar is a new stablecoin with a very special property. As the market cap of Glow goes up, extreme poverty goes down. Glow stands for Global Income Coin. It's a dollar backed, non profit stablecoin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty. Glow is basically the same business model as USDC, with yield generating treasuries on one side and a stablecoin on Ethereum on the other. But instead of being a for profit company, glow is a nonprofit that donates 100% of all yields from the Glow Reserve to Give Directly's basic Income Program. Give Directly is a charity that gives money to people living in poverty and is a charity that Vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past.
00:02:46.990 - 00:03:15.962, Speaker B: Through the Glow nonprofit, you can reduce property by just holding a stablecoin Glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist@glowdollar.org greenpill. That's GL o dollar greenpill. Hey, bankless nation. If you're listening to this, it's because you're on the free Bankless RSS feed.

00:04:20.530 - 00:04:21.038, Speaker C: Good.
00:04:21.124 - 00:04:25.870, Speaker D: I mean, I got sick the last weekend, but that's why my voice is a little different than usual.
00:04:25.950 - 00:04:26.850, Speaker C: But I'm good now.
00:04:26.920 - 00:04:52.460, Speaker A: Yeah, we're transitioning to winter, so I think things are getting colder and I'm glad you're feeling better. Well, Fabian, I've been following your work for years. You're the author of the ERC 20 and ERC 725 standards. You worked on Mist web3 JS, and lots of great things in the Ethereum ecosystem and excited to catch up and talk about your most recent work. So where should we dive in?
00:04:54.430 - 00:05:03.934, Speaker D: I think we can talk a little bit about my path getting to Luxo. I think that's a good idea. And then I think the standards is probably the next important thing.
00:05:04.052 - 00:05:10.366, Speaker C: That's what people right now talked about on Defcon A. I mean, I think.
00:05:10.388 - 00:05:18.850, Speaker A: The standards you've worked on have been really influential on the ecosystem. So, yeah, let's start with your path to getting to Luxo and working on those standards.
00:05:19.750 - 00:05:21.394, Speaker D: So the kind of short version of.
00:05:21.432 - 00:05:25.054, Speaker C: It is worked at the Theorem Foundation.
00:05:25.102 - 00:05:32.050, Speaker D: As lead DApp developer. From there I built together with Alexander van der Sander, the missed browser.
00:05:32.130 - 00:05:34.566, Speaker C: He was a pretty vocal person at.
00:05:34.588 - 00:05:40.486, Speaker D: The time in Ethereum he came up with the Mist browser concept. And really the most fascinating thing about.
00:05:40.508 - 00:05:42.954, Speaker C: The Mis browser concept is that most.
00:05:42.992 - 00:05:54.490, Speaker D: Of the things that he described in this video are not even done yet and in fact now will be possible with universal profiles and the new standards I have built. Lots of these things that he has in this video can now be done nicely.
00:05:55.150 - 00:06:32.700, Speaker A: So I just wanted to interject for the listeners who don't know. Mist browser was a bundled kind of web browser where you would sync the blockchain locally and then you could do web3 enabled things. And it was sort of the first idea of integrating Web Three into a browser based experience. But I think that it didn't really take off because you had to download and sync the whole blockchain in order to be able to do anything. And browser extensions that you could install and point to infura kind of beat Mist in the marketplace. But it was still a useful proof of concept. Is that an accurate portrayal of the Mis project?
00:06:34.270 - 00:07:14.630, Speaker D: Actually, the Misproouncer was the thing that initiated all of this. So MetaMask was answered to the Mist browser, and we could have always pointed to an external source for the nodes. The idea of the Mist browser was we need to try it the full, decentralized way. Like you run your own node, you have a local browser that can run DApps. By building the BIS browser, by building the first wallet. We had to literally invent the way DApps work and how DApps even exist. MetaMask then was kind of like trying to make the simpler version of the Mist browser by saying, hey, instead of making a full browser, we just make a browser extension.
00:07:14.630 - 00:07:23.260, Speaker D: And it came out of Mist in a way, but it was decentralized version of it because you didn't run your own node. Right.
00:07:23.630 - 00:07:26.218, Speaker C: And out of this came literally later.
00:07:26.304 - 00:07:36.766, Speaker D: Everything else we had after that. So the Mist browser was kind of the initiation and the initial first ever DApp browser, in fact. Yes, first ever Web Three browser, if.
00:07:36.788 - 00:07:40.238, Speaker C: You want to call it like that. And we had to define a lot.
00:07:40.244 - 00:07:41.790, Speaker D: Of pieces in that time.
00:07:41.940 - 00:07:43.198, Speaker C: We had to define of how you.
00:07:43.204 - 00:08:08.358, Speaker D: Talk to a D app, right, which later I came up with the Ethereum provider standard, which was a bit more generic. Initially, we just exposed the Web Three object into the D app, which then DApps used to talk to the browser, or later even MetaMask. MetaMask overtook that. We had the first Ethereum wallet running this way and figured out a lot.
00:08:08.364 - 00:08:13.546, Speaker C: Of things along the way. So, I mean, as a listener and.
00:08:13.568 - 00:08:51.720, Speaker A: Someone who's followed your career, what I kind of take away from this is that, Fabian, you've been sort of on the forefront of innovating in Web Three for years. And so I look backwards in the mirror view mirror at the success of ERC 20 and 725 and web3 JS and it allows me to have a lot of confidence, looking forward, that you're going to help us continue to innovate with universal profiles and the work that you're doing these days. So it's been a long journey. I'm curious about ERC 20. Maybe that's the next thing to chat about. Tell me about working on the ERC 20 standard because that's the foundation of everything in this space.
00:08:52.250 - 00:08:53.142, Speaker C: It is.
00:08:53.276 - 00:09:07.130, Speaker D: That's actually the least contribution I made from my perspective because this was really initially Vitalik's proposal. It was on the Wiki page. We had to chat, like as a few developers, I'm not sure there were like three or four of us debating.
00:09:07.550 - 00:09:09.626, Speaker C: How a token could look like in.
00:09:09.648 - 00:09:29.426, Speaker D: A smart contract form. And at the time there was this EIP repository that Martin BC created to discuss Ethereum proposals around the network and literally just two weeks before he created this. So I thought that's a great place to discuss the standard. So instead of this niche Wiki Page where nobody's really paying attention, let's just talk there.
00:09:29.608 - 00:09:35.442, Speaker C: And so I had to come up with a format that was more specification like.
00:09:35.576 - 00:09:43.926, Speaker D: So I kind of referenced the RFC specification way with a bit simpler form and I called it a theorem request for comment because I thought it was.
00:09:43.948 - 00:09:46.518, Speaker C: A great way to get input from.
00:09:46.524 - 00:10:07.786, Speaker D: The community and then have a proper standard. The request for comment became then even the name for the standard and it was the issue number 20 which created USC 20. And I did some small changes. We had the discussion of 60 people over like a few months period and people started adopting it and that this became the token.
00:10:07.898 - 00:10:11.600, Speaker C: What's really interesting for me though, is.
00:10:12.210 - 00:10:16.354, Speaker D: How such a simple agreement on just a few function can have such a.
00:10:16.392 - 00:10:21.086, Speaker C: Strong impact on all the things you can build on a programmable blockchain.
00:10:21.278 - 00:10:35.318, Speaker D: And this is, in my opinion, the most fascinating thing to see. Know what comes out of so little agreement, if you want. And yes, it built the basis, right? ICOs came out of it, DeFi came out of it, NFTs came out of.
00:10:35.324 - 00:10:37.160, Speaker C: It, literally everything came out of it.
00:10:38.410 - 00:10:55.582, Speaker D: And what I'm now doing and this is really why I took this as a learning which was purely, I would say, a coincidence even, that this took off that big time. There was a need at the time. But taking this learning and then making this more consciously right?
00:10:55.716 - 00:10:57.200, Speaker C: That's what I'm doing now.
00:10:57.570 - 00:11:03.810, Speaker D: Like coming up with the next set of standards that are fundamentally important for.
00:11:03.880 - 00:11:10.594, Speaker C: The future of this space, but doing it with some thought and doing it.
00:11:10.632 - 00:11:19.414, Speaker D: With some way where I can already anticipate things and put them together in the right way that they create a great foundation for things to be built in the future.
00:11:19.532 - 00:11:22.246, Speaker C: While ESC 20, it was, on the.
00:11:22.268 - 00:11:55.186, Speaker D: End, purely people said they want tokens. We telek thought a little bit, came up with this idea, we discussed around it, made a bit better, changed things and came up with some basic bare bone thing without really stretching our thoughts far too far in the future, trying to make it too complex system because first something needed to be adopted, right? That's now different. When you have all this experience, what happened over these years and you see what went good, what went wrong, what could be improved now you can make it right and you now can make.
00:11:55.208 - 00:11:58.434, Speaker C: It way better with some experience that.
00:11:58.472 - 00:12:19.414, Speaker D: Exists now which didn't exist at all in 2015. November 6 months seven, eight months after the main net was started. Right? Was a very different time. So that actually I think puts me in a way better position to do these standards or improve these standards and create these new standards that I have done now over the last few years.
00:12:19.532 - 00:12:20.860, Speaker C: Together with my team.
00:12:21.470 - 00:12:28.410, Speaker A: I'm wondering if you could do ERC 20 all over again. Is there anything that you would change given the gift of perfect hindsight?
00:12:29.150 - 00:13:21.162, Speaker D: I am actually doing ERC 20 all over again. Actually we call it luxury standard proposal number seven. So it's called LSP seven and this is literally the new ESC 20. So I did exactly that. So what was improved is number one, the way of that actually this token standard calls out of smart contracts, right? This idea was not new, right? There was ESC 777223, even seven to one had this kind of on tokens receive function built in. But how we did it is we did it in a generic way. So that's a generic function you call called universal receiver that basically can notify any smart contract, especially profiles whatever exists in the future in a generic way.
00:13:21.162 - 00:13:24.858, Speaker D: That means you can now send tokens to a smart contract and the smart.
00:13:24.874 - 00:13:27.134, Speaker C: Contract can react on it, which is.
00:13:27.172 - 00:13:32.878, Speaker D: The biggest pain point of ESC 20, for example, that you have to constantly do this approve and transfer.
00:13:32.964 - 00:13:36.098, Speaker C: From kind of double call just to.
00:13:36.184 - 00:13:50.214, Speaker D: Make a smart connect understand that he received some tokens, which is, I guess, the most biggest pain point of DeFi. In fact. So yes, that's improved. What's also improved is to have batch calls built in. What's also improved is that you have.
00:13:50.252 - 00:13:59.186, Speaker C: An unlimited way of adding metadata, smart contributable metadata to your token. So now you can reference a JSON.
00:13:59.218 - 00:14:12.206, Speaker D: File with some pictures and name and description and website and whatever, but you can also reference other protocols or other tokens or other systems that somehow relate to your token. You have literally an unlimited key value store that you can attach to your.
00:14:12.228 - 00:14:18.720, Speaker C: Token contract which will make these extremely extensible in a standard way.
00:14:19.890 - 00:14:32.434, Speaker D: So that's kind of the major improvements. There's a lot more smaller detail improvements. But also really what's nice now is the naming. And I think when it comes to standards, one of the most important thing.
00:14:32.472 - 00:14:39.254, Speaker C: Is having an intuitive naming, having something that kind of developers ideally get and.
00:14:39.292 - 00:14:44.390, Speaker D: Kind of can remember without constantly having to go back to documentation and reading it again and again.
00:14:44.540 - 00:14:46.598, Speaker C: And right now, for example, there's a.
00:14:46.604 - 00:14:50.278, Speaker D: Lot of differences between ERC 20 and ERC seven to one in terms of.
00:14:50.284 - 00:14:52.982, Speaker C: How the functions are named, purely because.
00:14:53.036 - 00:15:03.214, Speaker D: They all thought they want to improve it and change it and then they give it different function names and all of this, and that makes it very confusing for people. So when you do these standard from scratch and you really don't care about.
00:15:03.252 - 00:15:05.646, Speaker C: The past because you create a new.
00:15:05.668 - 00:15:07.102, Speaker D: Network and you can literally do things.
00:15:07.156 - 00:15:09.790, Speaker C: Right, we can clean up that mess.
00:15:09.860 - 00:15:13.834, Speaker D: And kind of unify function names in a way that they are now consistent.
00:15:13.882 - 00:15:17.346, Speaker C: Across NFTs and token standards and in.
00:15:17.368 - 00:15:23.906, Speaker D: The way they act and behave and everything. So it's also a clean house cleaning task that we did, in a way.
00:15:24.008 - 00:15:29.006, Speaker C: On top of that improvement. Yeah, having users is a double edged.
00:15:29.038 - 00:15:39.022, Speaker A: Sword because you have network effects that come out of that, but you also have a lot of legacy things that if you could do it all over again, you'd probably do differently. So I'd love to segue from ERC.
00:15:39.186 - 00:15:41.002, Speaker C: Oh, sorry, go ahead. No, exactly.
00:15:41.056 - 00:15:51.338, Speaker D: I mean, I fully agree with you. This is exactly the big problem that Ethereum standard space has, right? There's a lot of people want to propose things but there's a lot of.
00:15:51.344 - 00:15:53.354, Speaker C: People already went with some way, right?
00:15:53.392 - 00:15:55.066, Speaker D: And they already went down rabbit hole.
00:15:55.098 - 00:15:57.386, Speaker C: A so it's very hard to convince.
00:15:57.418 - 00:16:01.518, Speaker D: Them to go the rabbit hole C or D. And if you create a.
00:16:01.524 - 00:16:04.254, Speaker C: New network from scratch, people are very.
00:16:04.292 - 00:16:07.286, Speaker D: Willing to adopt and use the new standard from scratch.
00:16:07.338 - 00:16:09.314, Speaker C: That gives basically, if they're the right.
00:16:09.352 - 00:16:17.282, Speaker D: Standards in the right way, give people a lot more possibilities of what they can build and you can create a whole different user experience, something very hard.
00:16:17.336 - 00:16:20.674, Speaker C: To push through in an existing network.
00:16:20.722 - 00:16:24.838, Speaker D: And this is really a little bit same with Bitcoin, by the way, in any other network, right?
00:16:24.924 - 00:16:27.914, Speaker C: They always have that baggage of people.
00:16:27.952 - 00:16:30.346, Speaker D: Have a way of doing things and they kind of want to stick with.
00:16:30.368 - 00:16:31.900, Speaker C: It in a way.
00:16:33.790 - 00:17:32.000, Speaker A: Yeah, backwards compatibility is a problem. But also, I'd love to segue from talking from ERC 20, which is a foundational part of Tokens in the Ethereum space, to ERC 725, which is an identity standard. And just as I prompt you to talk about ERC 725, this is the Green Pill podcast. We're talking about regenerative uses of crypto, positive sum uses of crypto. And one of sort of the ideas that we've been playing with is this idea that with identity we can now have these pseudonymous identities where because we can track our interactions with each other, we can have more positive sum games through repeat interactions with each other, therefore complexifying the design space and allowing for more regenerative crypto projects to be built. So I'm just really curious to know why ERC 725 was proposed, how it's going, and maybe you could give us a little bit of a hint of how that's evolving into universal profiles over from your vantage point.
00:17:35.810 - 00:17:54.900, Speaker D: First off, you're totally right, right? The biggest missing piece in Blockchain is identity. We have an Identifier, it's an address. It's just a very unhuman readable Identifier. And that's the big issue. It's not very identifiable. By machines, yes. By people, not so much.
00:17:54.900 - 00:17:59.558, Speaker D: And that's the biggest issue. And that's exactly why a lot of use cases aren't happening.
00:17:59.724 - 00:18:03.794, Speaker C: And that's why, literally, the NFT space is fucked. If I can say that in this podcast.
00:18:03.842 - 00:18:19.590, Speaker D: I'm not sure how you say, but I mean, it's basically a problem because the identifying creators are not very visible, right? Your product, your NFT, is visible. You as the actual person, group, Dow.
00:18:19.750 - 00:18:27.840, Speaker C: Brand, whatever, created it totally invisible. So 725 basically came initially out of.
00:18:29.570 - 00:18:46.274, Speaker D: Some workshops I did, and the idea was, let's create a smart contract based account system. I had to make some thoughts about how to do this. I came up with a very basic concept, which was the first version of seven to five. I somehow, after that, had this urge.
00:18:46.322 - 00:18:53.558, Speaker C: To propose this as a standard. And I was working at Ethereum. I had literally no idea or interest.
00:18:53.644 - 00:18:58.694, Speaker D: In doing anything with identity whatsoever. There was civic protocol.
00:18:58.822 - 00:19:05.100, Speaker C: And what's the consensus version uport at the time?
00:19:05.550 - 00:19:50.902, Speaker D: No, they were all like the big players at the time, and I had totally nothing to do with this. I just had this urge that I need to somehow write this in a doc as an ERC, which I did. Somehow it took traction. People got all really interested in that and Uport got quite offended because they said, oh, my God, it's Smart Corner basic count system. Are you crazy? And you cannot put everything on chain and wrote big articles like saying why this is a monolith and they want to build a modular system. Long story short, I literally thought other people would go do something with the standard. I worked continued work on web3, JS and other things in Ethereum.
00:19:50.966 - 00:19:52.522, Speaker C: I just put that out there.
00:19:52.656 - 00:20:22.626, Speaker D: It got traction. There was the origin protocol that they created this alliance, and people now all subscribe to using it, blah, blah, blah. What happened, funny enough, is that nobody really took the lead on this and involved the standard forward because it was not done done. It was like the basic idea somehow. Then at some point there came this guy, Taylor Osaka, I think, and he said, hey, here, I can build an implementation for this. I want to try. And I said, sure, go ahead, do.
00:20:22.626 - 00:20:28.934, Speaker D: And then he came back and he had some extra ideas of what we could improve. And then really, I changed a little up with him together.
00:20:29.132 - 00:20:30.662, Speaker C: And then I think a few weeks.
00:20:30.716 - 00:20:39.338, Speaker D: Later he just left and said, I will stop coding. I will become a right, great, whatever. Then I was sitting there still, and.
00:20:39.504 - 00:20:42.842, Speaker C: When I started Luxo, I realized that.
00:20:42.896 - 00:20:46.394, Speaker D: This standard is so extremely fundamental to.
00:20:46.432 - 00:20:48.746, Speaker C: Everything we wanted to do because we.
00:20:48.768 - 00:20:50.358, Speaker D: Want to create a blockchain for the.
00:20:50.384 - 00:20:53.806, Speaker C: New creative economy where identity, obviously, if.
00:20:53.828 - 00:21:00.478, Speaker D: You create stuff right, the creator is quite important. And not only do you need to.
00:21:00.484 - 00:21:02.586, Speaker C: Identify people who create stuff, but you.
00:21:02.628 - 00:21:06.580, Speaker D: Also need a user experience in blockchain that actually people can manage.
00:21:07.270 - 00:21:20.422, Speaker C: And really thinking about years of 75, it was in, I think, November 2017 when I proposed it, up until really.
00:21:20.476 - 00:21:26.120, Speaker D: When I started really building it out in detail, which was 2019 or so.
00:21:27.530 - 00:21:29.030, Speaker C: I thought a lot about it.
00:21:29.100 - 00:21:33.994, Speaker D: I don't know, somehow it didn't let me go. This then I pondered it around my.
00:21:34.032 - 00:21:38.106, Speaker C: Head over the years and on the.
00:21:38.128 - 00:21:43.500, Speaker D: End I really got to more and more ideas of what can be done with it and how it can be done and blah, blah, blah, and all of the things.
00:21:44.350 - 00:21:46.846, Speaker C: So, long story short, we built it.
00:21:46.868 - 00:21:52.542, Speaker D: Out over the last two years. Exactly. All the things that were missing that I thought need to be added were built it out.
00:21:52.676 - 00:21:56.990, Speaker C: It's not only one standard, it's a set of 14.
00:21:57.070 - 00:22:07.102, Speaker D: Actually, we have 17 standards now where seven to five is a core building block of many of them. Because seven to five itself is actually a very generic standard.
00:22:07.176 - 00:22:08.194, Speaker C: It's two pieces.
00:22:08.242 - 00:22:14.406, Speaker D: It's two parts of a standard. One is a generic execution. So you can just execute through the.
00:22:14.428 - 00:22:17.106, Speaker C: Smart contract onto any other smart contracts.
00:22:17.138 - 00:22:28.598, Speaker D: Totally generic execution, do whatever you want. And the second is a generic key value store. What's the benefit over a generic key value store versus writing variables in a smart contract?
00:22:28.774 - 00:22:30.506, Speaker C: If you have a smart contract and.
00:22:30.528 - 00:22:34.586, Speaker D: You have two functions, like name and symbol of a token, right?
00:22:34.688 - 00:22:36.250, Speaker C: You deploy the smart contract.
00:22:36.330 - 00:22:36.814, Speaker D: That's it.
00:22:36.852 - 00:22:38.190, Speaker C: That's all you got, right.
00:22:38.260 - 00:23:06.834, Speaker D: You can now have a name and a symbol. Maybe you can change it, that's it. But if you would add some third thing, like a website or whatever, you couldn't anymore. If you have a generic key value store, you can extend this for the foreseeable future in whatever way you want. You could say, okay, one of these added variables is now an address, or it's a new protocol, or it's like a reference, a new JSON document, or what the heck you want to add, right? You can add millions of entries to a smart contract.
00:23:06.882 - 00:23:12.506, Speaker C: Now, that makes things extremely extensible from an information point of view, which can.
00:23:12.528 - 00:23:25.562, Speaker D: Also be used for extending logic and all kinds of stuff. So that's the combination that's a ground piece that works really well for a new metadata center for tokens. It works really well for a profile smart contract.
00:23:25.706 - 00:23:28.378, Speaker C: It works really well for all kinds.
00:23:28.394 - 00:23:29.982, Speaker D: Of new type of smart contracts that.
00:23:30.036 - 00:23:31.680, Speaker C: We haven't even thought about yet.
00:23:33.970 - 00:23:35.266, Speaker D: We have built out all of this.
00:23:35.288 - 00:23:37.634, Speaker C: Groundwork and we have this thing called.
00:23:37.672 - 00:23:41.774, Speaker D: Universe Profiles, which is a combination of a few smart contracts.
00:23:41.822 - 00:23:46.258, Speaker C: Number one, it's your core account, that's obviously your address.
00:23:46.344 - 00:24:02.170, Speaker D: That's the thing that you don't want to change over time, right? That's where you gain your reputation. This one is a full on profile. You can attach your profile picture, you can act through it on chain. You can do lots of really cool features that I guess more developers would be interested in.
00:24:02.320 - 00:24:04.154, Speaker C: But you can also better manage it.
00:24:04.272 - 00:24:08.986, Speaker D: Because that one account is controlled by another account that we call a key.
00:24:09.008 - 00:24:13.730, Speaker C: Manager, specifically LSP Six key manager.
00:24:13.830 - 00:24:15.406, Speaker D: And by having a key manager now.
00:24:15.428 - 00:24:18.590, Speaker C: You can have multiple keys controlling that one account.
00:24:18.740 - 00:24:21.166, Speaker D: So that's a very similar thing to.
00:24:21.188 - 00:24:24.190, Speaker C: What people discuss now in Ethereum with account obstruction, right?
00:24:24.260 - 00:24:35.154, Speaker D: There's many account obstruction proposals. Some want to solve it on a smart contract level, other want to solve it on a minor level. LSP Six and Er 75 account is.
00:24:35.192 - 00:24:37.382, Speaker C: Kind of like a smart connect level.
00:24:37.436 - 00:25:18.126, Speaker D: Version, account abstraction and a lot more than that. What it gives you is it gives you an Internet, like a blockchain based account that you can use to hold stuff, do hold token, interact, have a profile picture, have a reputation, have a follower system, have a decentralized twitter. Have whatever heck you want on your Web three account while managing it through your mobile phone, your computer, your hardware wallet, your ring. You will have in the finger what are your AR glasses, act in a game through your decentralized account, do whatever else you want. At the same time, other people can pay for your gas, which makes onboarding.
00:25:18.158 - 00:25:20.946, Speaker C: Very seamless, like no more go to.
00:25:20.968 - 00:25:28.114, Speaker D: An exchange and get some tokens kind of thing. You can just literally go to a service, say create me a profile, give me three months, I pay you next.
00:25:28.152 - 00:25:30.360, Speaker C: Month type of thing.
00:25:30.810 - 00:25:32.326, Speaker D: That will onboard a lot of people.
00:25:32.348 - 00:25:33.926, Speaker C: To web Three and at the same.
00:25:33.948 - 00:25:39.546, Speaker D: Time they have a full on account that can even extend, that can react to assets. I mean, the feature list is crazy.
00:25:39.648 - 00:25:42.906, Speaker C: Long and very detailed, but it's kind.
00:25:42.928 - 00:25:44.378, Speaker D: Of like for some people in the.
00:25:44.384 - 00:25:55.470, Speaker C: Blockchain space ashant, but standardized on a very deep level hypermodular and super feature rich.
00:25:56.930 - 00:26:11.890, Speaker A: I'm curious if you can paint us a picture of what the coolest use cases that can be built on top of 725 and Universal Profiles, this suite of identity based systems. What are you most excited about that this enables?
00:26:13.270 - 00:26:49.822, Speaker D: I mean, this is a very similar question. Like if you would ask me in 2015 what do you think will happen with tokens, right? It was very hard to imagine ICOs. I mean ICOs were pretty okay, they were straightforward, but the craziness of ICOs were not so straightforward. But DFI, it was clear that these things will happen. But the shape they took, the complexity they took, the markets they created and NFTs and all of these things in that detail level was not so easy to imagine. I mean, we knew people can make NFTs. We know that people will use whatever.
00:26:49.876 - 00:26:52.926, Speaker C: Compounded tokens and do whatever but not.
00:26:52.948 - 00:27:01.282, Speaker D: In that kind of detail. Same here. It's such in a flexible core piece that it's very hard to imagine all of the things.
00:27:01.416 - 00:27:05.170, Speaker C: I mean what's maybe probably very clear.
00:27:05.240 - 00:27:17.798, Speaker D: Is decentralized social media for example, right, you can have a decentralized blockchain based account. That's your decentralized social media account. It will be your log into websites but it will also be your social media account but at the same time.
00:27:17.804 - 00:27:20.970, Speaker C: It'S also your wallet. So it's all of these things combined.
00:27:23.150 - 00:27:41.534, Speaker D: You will probably have multiple of those profiles. Some you use for anonymity reasons, other use as a public person. But you will definitely want to stick with certain accounts because reputation only builds onto verifiable and accounts that you can actually follow and see, right?
00:27:41.572 - 00:27:44.174, Speaker C: If they constantly swap and change my.
00:27:44.212 - 00:27:53.620, Speaker D: Son has this great idea to constantly change his username and discord. I have a really hard time finding him because every time I search like his name has changed and it's really hard to find him.
00:27:54.970 - 00:27:58.950, Speaker C: Here you have literally a unique identifier.
00:27:59.850 - 00:28:02.694, Speaker D: That solved that root identity problem.
00:28:02.812 - 00:28:14.646, Speaker C: That exactly is the reason why almost none of the other identity protocols really succeeded. Either they just invented a bullshit token or they said we are totally generic.
00:28:14.678 - 00:28:16.906, Speaker D: And we are off chain. Which on the end means okay, where.
00:28:16.928 - 00:28:19.194, Speaker C: Do I go look and find you?
00:28:19.312 - 00:28:49.730, Speaker D: Or the Count or whatever I'm looking for, right? But yeah, decentralized social media. I think creator economy being a brand on the blockchain, you want to be visible. You want to be the place that people know where to go when they want to look for a new mint. They want to know and see your profile and see oh, profile X just created a new collection or something, right? You want to be able to have transparency on chain.
00:28:49.810 - 00:28:53.474, Speaker C: Not OpenSea transparency, but a transparency that's.
00:28:53.602 - 00:28:55.350, Speaker D: Cross apps application, right?
00:28:55.420 - 00:29:04.378, Speaker C: That's not one app having a profile now. Every app has the same profile now. That's why universal profiles, right?
00:29:04.544 - 00:29:11.694, Speaker D: So it changes the game for everything. And all of these doing good projects can now happen because we can create.
00:29:11.732 - 00:29:13.898, Speaker C: Dows where members are visible.
00:29:14.074 - 00:29:16.346, Speaker D: We have DAOs with the universal profiles.
00:29:16.378 - 00:29:18.874, Speaker C: Themselves so they will have a profile.
00:29:18.922 - 00:29:30.914, Speaker D: Picture and information attached and protocols attached and logic attached to it, whatever. You can now have communities run and organize themselves in a very transparent and.
00:29:30.952 - 00:29:34.306, Speaker C: Very blockchain based way and we.
00:29:34.328 - 00:29:35.086, Speaker D: Haven't seen that.
00:29:35.128 - 00:29:35.382, Speaker C: Really?
00:29:35.436 - 00:29:38.514, Speaker D: Like DAOs today are discord communities.
00:29:38.642 - 00:29:39.986, Speaker C: That's not a dow.
00:29:40.178 - 00:29:53.546, Speaker D: It's just a discord community with a dow name tag. We will have real dows. Let's say we will have real decentralized communities. We will have everything that we couldn't do so far because the identity was.
00:29:53.568 - 00:30:04.062, Speaker C: Missing and nothing restricts it. Yeah, well, I think that I just.
00:30:04.116 - 00:30:40.330, Speaker A: Really fully believe that identity is one of the key building blocks of making this space actually useful for everyday people. And it seems like there's a couple competing visions standards. I'd be curious what you think of like Evan McMullen's criticisms of on chain identities in that they don't allow for privacy. I'd be curious what you think of decentralized society. What do you think of the other trends that are happening in the identity space and where do you differ from other major players that are working in the identity space in terms of vision and execution?
00:30:41.630 - 00:30:42.780, Speaker C: A lot of questions.
00:30:44.590 - 00:30:57.562, Speaker D: The critic point with I mean, I think lots of people in the old school identity space, how I would call that the one which was more like before blockchain would definitely say, hey, you can never put something like this on the blockchain.
00:30:57.626 - 00:30:58.240, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:58.770 - 00:31:05.982, Speaker D: My argument would be the following first off, it's not about hard identity. It's not about an identity that's necessarily.
00:31:06.046 - 00:31:14.494, Speaker C: Identifying you as a person. It's about creating an identifiable account or profile that could be an AI.
00:31:14.622 - 00:31:20.822, Speaker D: Could be a gamer identity, it could be whatever. It doesn't need to be you as a person. So what I do, I differentiate between.
00:31:20.876 - 00:31:22.818, Speaker C: Soft identity and hard identity.
00:31:22.994 - 00:31:27.286, Speaker D: Hard identity is your passport, Social Security, everything that has to do with your.
00:31:27.308 - 00:31:29.658, Speaker C: Livelihood and your actual physical person.
00:31:29.824 - 00:31:39.130, Speaker D: Soft identity is your internet account, your gamer account, your Instagram account, anything that's literally more like a creation than it is actually real life.
00:31:39.200 - 00:31:39.482, Speaker C: Right?
00:31:39.536 - 00:31:46.826, Speaker D: It's a curated persona that could be looking like you physically or could be totally abstract today with crypto panks.
00:31:46.858 - 00:31:48.734, Speaker C: Everybody's totally abstract in Twitter now.
00:31:48.852 - 00:32:10.822, Speaker D: Everybody's back to being a pixel make. I think the biggest difference to other protocols is they always try to solve hard identity. I don't try to solve hard identity. It will be solved through that as well. But I rather want to have soft identity. That's what everybody actually needs really.
00:32:10.876 - 00:32:11.480, Speaker C: First.
00:32:12.010 - 00:32:20.374, Speaker D: The thing with privacy, you can have any kind of selective revealing protocols built.
00:32:20.412 - 00:32:22.266, Speaker C: On top of this where you have.
00:32:22.288 - 00:32:35.406, Speaker D: Certain information that people can verify you have and you only reveal it to certain parties. Or you can have CK. Snarks in some way where verify stuff or prove things that's all possible to.
00:32:35.428 - 00:32:37.406, Speaker C: Build on top of this. Yes.
00:32:37.508 - 00:32:41.434, Speaker D: If you put your face on a profile account and then you say that's.
00:32:41.482 - 00:32:46.546, Speaker C: Me, people can watch you on the blockchain. This is the same today. Right?
00:32:46.648 - 00:32:48.494, Speaker D: If you put your address on Twitter.
00:32:48.542 - 00:32:56.934, Speaker C: And say, that's me, guys, I mean, people can follow you what you do on Ethereum, right, or if you put an ENS name.
00:32:56.972 - 00:33:03.922, Speaker D: So it's the same thing. And that's actually a problem of the technology because we don't have fully programmable.
00:33:03.986 - 00:33:10.506, Speaker C: Blockchains that at the same time totally private. So we have to live with what we have at the same time.
00:33:10.528 - 00:33:14.874, Speaker D: When we look at Facebook and others, people are pretty interested in making themselves public.
00:33:15.072 - 00:33:21.450, Speaker C: And I believe if we look a.
00:33:21.520 - 00:33:23.386, Speaker D: Bit more from a philosophical point of.
00:33:23.408 - 00:33:25.654, Speaker C: View, if you live in a village.
00:33:25.782 - 00:33:32.446, Speaker D: Right, and you do something at some point, either something nice or something bad or whatever, or something weird, people in.
00:33:32.468 - 00:33:36.058, Speaker C: That village remember, right, for some period of time that you did it.
00:33:36.164 - 00:33:38.018, Speaker D: So as much as this right, to.
00:33:38.024 - 00:33:41.586, Speaker C: Be forgotten is a nice idea, you.
00:33:41.608 - 00:33:54.966, Speaker D: Can'T also not go into the village to everyone, say, hey, can you please forget that I did that? Because I just chose to not want to have that memory anymore. And you all need to also forget now. So if we do things in a public space, and a blockchain is a.
00:33:54.988 - 00:33:58.486, Speaker C: Public space, probably also makes sense that.
00:33:58.508 - 00:34:00.022, Speaker D: It stays there because it was actually.
00:34:00.076 - 00:34:07.274, Speaker C: Part of history and the Internet is the same. It doesn't forget either. You can maybe force Google or any.
00:34:07.312 - 00:34:13.740, Speaker D: Other platform to not reveal it, but still going to be there. Somebody downloaded his computer, still going to be there.
00:34:14.050 - 00:34:15.358, Speaker C: It would be ideal to have a.
00:34:15.364 - 00:34:19.678, Speaker D: Blockchain that's totally verifiable and private, but we don't have that. So as long as that's not the.
00:34:19.684 - 00:34:30.914, Speaker C: Case, why wouldn't we now make public account systems? Because it's actually quite useful to have specifically for anything that has to do.
00:34:30.952 - 00:34:35.734, Speaker D: With culture groups, dows brands, creators and.
00:34:35.772 - 00:34:39.602, Speaker C: All of these, where transparency and variability.
00:34:39.666 - 00:34:43.714, Speaker D: Is the absolute most important thing. Like how can you become a famous.
00:34:43.762 - 00:34:46.258, Speaker C: Brand if you are unknown?
00:34:46.354 - 00:34:49.078, Speaker D: That's somehow not going to get a well, right?
00:34:49.164 - 00:34:52.506, Speaker C: You want to be transparent. You want to show what you do.
00:34:52.688 - 00:34:54.426, Speaker D: And honestly, if you choose to be.
00:34:54.448 - 00:34:59.610, Speaker C: Anonymous, don't put a picture, don't say it's your account and you have your.
00:34:59.680 - 00:35:01.434, Speaker D: Blockchain anonymity you have today.
00:35:01.552 - 00:35:04.858, Speaker C: So that's pretty much a really there's.
00:35:04.874 - 00:35:38.440, Speaker A: A really interesting episode on Bankless in which Evan McMullen and Vitalik talk about the various merits of soulbound tokens in Vitalik's case and off chain DIDs and verifiable credentials. And I think that it's an important thing to get right? So I'll just direct listeners to that show if they want to learn more about identity. And curious I'm curious if you've read the Decentralized Society paper, Fabian, by Vitalik and Glenn and Pooja, and if so, what you think of that vision of blockchain based identity. I can quickly recap it if you'd like.
00:35:38.830 - 00:35:42.780, Speaker D: Please do, because I have not I'm too busy inventing that.
00:35:45.550 - 00:36:49.086, Speaker A: Yeah, no, the idea with Decentralized Society, which is called, like, searching for Web Three soul was the name of the paper but because it was all about soul bound tokens which are basically NFTs that can't be transferred. Like say I go to some event and I get NFT from that event that says that I go went to it and it can't be transferred, that makes it so that it can't be financialized. And so the ultimate articulation of this vision is that Vitalik and Glenn, imagine this sort of web of trust where, say, I sent you actually, I should do this. Now that I think about it, I should send you an NFT, saying you've been a guest on the Green Pill podcast. And that's an identity signal about our relationship with each other at scale. If you're sending tokens, whether they're poaps or soulbound tokens to other people, there's a web of trust that we can use to bootstrap things like civil resistance and under collateralized loans and web3 social networks with profiles and stuff like that. And so that's kind of the articulation of decentralized society and I'd be curious if we could compare and contrast that with your vision and what you're working on with 725 and universal profiles, if.
00:36:49.108 - 00:36:51.626, Speaker C: There'S any overlap, it's completely overlapping.
00:36:51.658 - 00:37:11.000, Speaker D: What I built is exactly the ground structure for this. So universal profiles are the soul of soul bank tokens. I personally don't really like these kind of naming convention that Vitalik chose because he was a I guess warhammer game or whatever this game was that he was into.
00:37:11.690 - 00:37:12.834, Speaker A: Yeah, World of Warcraft.
00:37:12.882 - 00:37:26.214, Speaker D: World of Warcraft. Exactly. I call them non transferable tokens. I like a bit more the logical naming then it's not so ambiguous. But if you call it soulbound token.
00:37:26.342 - 00:37:28.010, Speaker C: Universe probably are the soul.
00:37:28.350 - 00:37:36.062, Speaker D: And the problem right now is exactly that there is no soul. Your wallet account is not a soul. This is not something you can ever.
00:37:36.116 - 00:37:38.446, Speaker C: Use for that because you forget your.
00:37:38.468 - 00:37:42.894, Speaker D: Private key and what all your reputation, your social interactions are now stuck and.
00:37:42.932 - 00:37:47.022, Speaker C: Gone or basically it's unmanageable.
00:37:47.086 - 00:38:28.970, Speaker D: It's not a reputation system that works in any way or your friend gets hold of it and now they can be you and act as you. So what we are missing is a soul. Universal profits are the soul for soulbound tokens. And yes, exactly what I described before. You can attach the reputation system that could be based on an NFT or a non transferable token that could be based on some kind of registry that people agreed to, some kind of point system. Actually I would be building these more on top of point system. But yes, for example, we had a hackathon and we gave people a participant NFT and so on, right now they're transferable, but I mean, it's very easy to make them non transferable once we launch mainnet and then something that's stuck on your profile.
00:38:28.970 - 00:38:32.906, Speaker D: And the good thing is because your profile is very hard to lose.
00:38:33.098 - 00:38:34.574, Speaker C: Not like a key.
00:38:34.772 - 00:38:39.826, Speaker D: It actually can. Like this society and this vision. They are saying, I fully agree with.
00:38:39.848 - 00:38:44.366, Speaker C: This, by the way, was totally able to happen. And the only reason why it couldn't.
00:38:44.398 - 00:38:46.918, Speaker D: Happen so far is because people use.
00:38:47.004 - 00:38:50.374, Speaker C: Wallet private keys as their accounts, which.
00:38:50.412 - 00:38:52.934, Speaker D: Is obviously not the way it can happen ever.
00:38:53.132 - 00:39:00.394, Speaker C: But if you have a profile that you in the worst case, can social recover, or you even have a third.
00:39:00.432 - 00:39:05.722, Speaker D: Party recovery service you trust, or you have even three, five devices you control.
00:39:05.776 - 00:39:08.762, Speaker C: It from, so if four are gone.
00:39:08.816 - 00:39:13.040, Speaker D: You still have access, or you have a dow that could gain you access back.
00:39:13.410 - 00:39:15.278, Speaker C: Everything now possible, right?
00:39:15.364 - 00:39:20.206, Speaker D: Then you can actually literally have stuffed and stuck it on a brow and.
00:39:20.228 - 00:39:21.562, Speaker C: Literally make it unmovable.
00:39:21.706 - 00:39:24.754, Speaker D: You don't even need to think about a logic anymore of how you move.
00:39:24.792 - 00:39:30.994, Speaker C: That in whatever case of loss, because it's unlousable and that changes the game.
00:39:31.192 - 00:39:41.190, Speaker D: So I fully agree what they're saying, and this is what I have built up the foundation for now, it's there. It's literally to be going very soon.
00:39:41.260 - 00:39:47.158, Speaker C: There to be experienced by people and by developers, really.
00:39:47.324 - 00:39:49.370, Speaker D: And this is now all possible.
00:39:49.440 - 00:39:51.260, Speaker C: Yeah, it will change the game.
00:39:52.430 - 00:39:59.050, Speaker A: So I'm curious, given that we only have about ten minutes left, if we can start converging, I'd be curious.
00:40:02.130 - 00:40:02.446, Speaker C: What.
00:40:02.468 - 00:40:11.694, Speaker A: You'Re focused on now, how people can help contribute and how people can get involved in building this future that you're working on.
00:40:11.812 - 00:40:12.442, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:12.596 - 00:40:16.882, Speaker D: All right, so basically, we will start.
00:40:17.016 - 00:40:19.380, Speaker C: Our main net in the coming months.
00:40:21.750 - 00:40:23.262, Speaker D: We are starting a new Ethereum.
00:40:23.326 - 00:40:27.234, Speaker C: Let's call it like this because it's actually East Two type of network, just.
00:40:27.272 - 00:40:30.322, Speaker D: A new network focused on the new creative economy.
00:40:30.466 - 00:40:31.446, Speaker C: I don't want to see it as.
00:40:31.468 - 00:40:35.206, Speaker D: A competition to Ethereum. It might end up being that, but.
00:40:35.308 - 00:40:36.786, Speaker C: I see it more as an let's.
00:40:36.818 - 00:40:43.386, Speaker D: Call it sister network extension right now. But it's built as a new network because we need to have these new.
00:40:43.408 - 00:40:45.594, Speaker C: Basic standards and we have to have.
00:40:45.632 - 00:41:07.026, Speaker D: This focus of these people who build on these new kind of setups because they enable all of these new things that we just talked about in the past. So we have the standards, we have the smartcon implementation, we have a browser extension you can test out there's a whole documentation page we can read about all of this. So if you're a developer and you.
00:41:07.048 - 00:41:09.378, Speaker C: Want to really build all of these.
00:41:09.384 - 00:41:41.260, Speaker D: Things, you, for example, mentioned, right, the ones in the social space, not Djen, but regen, how you call that region space, then this is the tool chain for doing that. It is the absolute two chain. You could use universal provost on any other EVM chain. That's possible. It's on the engine smart contract standards. Our browser extension won't support that out of the box, obviously, for obvious reasons. But what's really missing is the transaction relay services.
00:41:41.630 - 00:41:42.778, Speaker C: That's what you want.
00:41:42.864 - 00:41:52.014, Speaker D: And we will run one. We will have one from the get go. And another reason why in your network is we can fund early users, we can subsidize their profiles and we can.
00:41:52.052 - 00:41:54.154, Speaker C: Subsidize their initial transactions.
00:41:54.282 - 00:42:09.398, Speaker D: That's how you basically get to use the blockchain right away without any of the hassle. What we also instigating through our hackathons and others, for example, the one we did at Gitcoin is for others to build transaction relay services.
00:42:09.484 - 00:42:11.362, Speaker C: Now, because all of this is standardized.
00:42:11.426 - 00:42:39.214, Speaker D: Building one is fairly simple. So you can basically be the mobile or phone provider or Internet service provider of the blockchain and say, come sign up with me, get a free profile and 10 million gas, and then subscribe next month. And that's how you get people using blockchain without the day being scared away. They can also be then the first recovery service of your profile and all of that web Two ease of use.
00:42:39.252 - 00:42:40.846, Speaker C: We know, while at the same time.
00:42:40.868 - 00:43:03.430, Speaker D: You have a full on Web Three profile and you can kick them out at any point in time and even pay your own transaction fees if you like. Just fill up your controller key with some money and that's it. So it requires a bit more things. That's why Luxor, the main net transaction relay service initially and all of these things for this to take off, eventually it will trickle down to other networks as well. So if you're a developer and builder.
00:43:03.770 - 00:43:06.438, Speaker C: Go read the docs, understand how to do this.
00:43:06.524 - 00:43:09.798, Speaker D: There's not a lot of things you need to understand if you just want.
00:43:09.804 - 00:43:11.530, Speaker C: To make a D app that works.
00:43:11.600 - 00:43:14.314, Speaker D: With MetaMask right now, you literally have to change nothing.
00:43:14.512 - 00:43:15.706, Speaker C: But if you want to use the.
00:43:15.728 - 00:43:17.834, Speaker D: Power of universal profiles, if you really.
00:43:17.872 - 00:43:21.398, Speaker C: Want to do something around profiles, just.
00:43:21.424 - 00:43:37.762, Speaker D: Read the docs and read how you attach information, how you get permission, set permission to whatever you want, and then you can really invent the next level, social protocols, community protocols, dows, whatever else you want. And it's going to be a lot.
00:43:37.816 - 00:43:40.258, Speaker C: Easier for you doing that than it.
00:43:40.264 - 00:43:45.570, Speaker D: Has been the last five years, where none of these basic things were solved.
00:43:47.030 - 00:44:20.606, Speaker A: I'm curious if you can project us out ten years into the future. I know when I asked you about what would the ultimate use of tokens be, you were kind of like, well, that could really predict what that would look like. But if you could do your best as someone who's been on the frontier of technology trends, if Luxo and universal profiles are maximally successful, what kind of impact do you think that has on the world? What is the ultimate sort of North Star that you're chasing? I don't know. Let's say in 2032, if we have you back on the Green Pill podcast, what does the world look like at that point?
00:44:20.708 - 00:44:25.666, Speaker D: I mean, on the end, this technology, these standards will benefit the whole blockchain space at large, not just luxo, but.
00:44:25.688 - 00:44:27.700, Speaker C: Luxo will be the initiator of it.
00:44:28.310 - 00:44:30.594, Speaker D: What I see is basically it will.
00:44:30.632 - 00:44:42.070, Speaker C: Completely disrupt society as we function today, like on a fundamental basis, because you can now self organize with actual real.
00:44:42.140 - 00:44:53.098, Speaker D: People that really can use this new technology. All the power that Web Three gives you of self organization, of self sovereignty, and all of this now becomes possible.
00:44:53.184 - 00:45:03.118, Speaker C: And in the hands of everyone, and it will change. What I see is really like a unification of the world that's I'm not.
00:45:03.124 - 00:45:06.974, Speaker D: Sure if that's in ten years it's more like in 20 or something or 30 maybe.
00:45:07.092 - 00:45:11.454, Speaker C: Orders will dissolve, power will dissolve, how.
00:45:11.492 - 00:45:24.946, Speaker D: We operate on a global scale, how we act on issues and decide on things we completely massively disrupt. You can build decentralized global voting systems. You can have actors and DAOs that.
00:45:24.968 - 00:45:28.310, Speaker C: Own like billions now and can act.
00:45:28.380 - 00:45:41.850, Speaker D: Globally on a fully decentralized scale in whatever way these people and groups want. And it will completely change the game. Everything will be going hyper democratic. Everything will go very well funded too.
00:45:41.920 - 00:45:44.330, Speaker C: I mean, the whole world now will.
00:45:44.400 - 00:46:01.230, Speaker D: Actually have a lot of coupes that have a lot of very positive impact with a lot of funding and all of this old world structures where it was so hard to even do an impact. It will really go to a mass acceleration of everything.
00:46:01.380 - 00:46:02.526, Speaker C: And on the end, it's up to.
00:46:02.548 - 00:46:17.960, Speaker D: People what they do with this technology. It's a tool. Anything could be done, and I really hope it's all for the better. So we just give people and humanity a tool of exactly the Web Three.
00:46:18.330 - 00:46:23.270, Speaker C: Tech stack, but user friendly and accessible.
00:46:24.170 - 00:46:27.414, Speaker D: And that's going to change everything going.
00:46:27.452 - 00:46:31.226, Speaker C: Forward in the next ten years for sure. 20?
00:46:31.328 - 00:46:31.980, Speaker D: Absolutely.
00:46:33.390 - 00:46:42.334, Speaker A: All right, well, if Green Pill podcast is still around in ten years, we'll have to have you back and do a review of how it went. But is there anything I didn't ask.
00:46:42.372 - 00:46:47.374, Speaker C: That you want to say? No, I think I'm good.
00:46:47.412 - 00:47:22.634, Speaker D: I mean, on the end, it's a new technology, it's a new set of standards. It's more complex than ESC 20. Once you get the concepts, it's actually not really hard to understand. It makes a lot of sense. It takes a little digging initially. Once you use these things, it will become more and more clear. It's unleashing a bit more complex set of standards that are working in concert together than what we had in the past, where somebody comes up with one standard proposal and says, hey, here one smart contractory function, let's go.
00:47:22.634 - 00:47:43.742, Speaker D: Now it's a bit more complex, but it's actually very modular, very extensible, very structured, but at the same time extremely flexible. And I have thought a lot about this stuff. My team and we built this out, thought a lot about this. We are blown away ourselves every single.
00:47:43.796 - 00:47:47.506, Speaker C: Time of the flexibility in what you.
00:47:47.528 - 00:47:51.762, Speaker D: Could now build, even for us, it's not clear all the stuff that could be built now.
00:47:51.896 - 00:47:55.458, Speaker C: So I think there will be some.
00:47:55.624 - 00:48:09.420, Speaker D: Years of people really diving into this. But it's going to be very interesting to watch what people build. And that's really what excites me, seeing how people will use this and where this all will be going. And, yeah, it's probably very crazy.
00:48:10.270 - 00:48:12.266, Speaker C: So I also want to watch back.
00:48:12.368 - 00:48:26.542, Speaker D: In ten years, see all the stuff through this technology. It's going to be very interesting. We've seen that with years of 20, right? We've seen that with all of the other stuff in the recent years. Looking back, it's crazy.
00:48:26.596 - 00:48:28.240, Speaker C: If you look at this, what happened.
00:48:29.170 - 00:48:42.082, Speaker D: It was not totally that obvious back in the day when we just came up with it. So it would be like this again, just massively on a larger scale because.
00:48:42.136 - 00:48:49.942, Speaker C: You can do a lot more things, right? A lot more things, because identity is the missing piece. Really.
00:48:49.996 - 00:48:52.920, Speaker D: That fundamental piece has been missing in the blockchain space.
00:48:53.370 - 00:48:56.246, Speaker C: And I do a claim now, I.
00:48:56.268 - 00:48:59.258, Speaker D: Solved it, but let's see in a.
00:48:59.344 - 00:49:03.626, Speaker C: Few months and years. Great.
00:49:03.728 - 00:49:05.002, Speaker A: Well, where can people find you online?
00:49:05.056 - 00:49:06.522, Speaker C: Fabian okay.
00:49:06.576 - 00:49:17.070, Speaker D: Luxo Network is the website. We have a discord community. Luxo underscore IO is the twitter. My Twitter is at Findura or just.
00:49:17.140 - 00:49:24.206, Speaker C: Search for my name on Twitter. And, yeah, just Twitter is really the.
00:49:24.228 - 00:49:39.782, Speaker D: Space that I communicate. Luxo communicates Discord and just follow, follow the main net launch, follow the tech, use it, play down, create a profile, start to care about your profile and use it.
00:49:39.836 - 00:49:46.214, Speaker C: And there we go. Amazing. Fabian, thanks so much for joining us.
00:49:46.252 - 00:49:52.418, Speaker A: And telling us your vision for Luxo and Universal Profiles. And see you out there on crypto Twitter.
00:49:52.514 - 00:49:53.460, Speaker D: Thanks for having me.
