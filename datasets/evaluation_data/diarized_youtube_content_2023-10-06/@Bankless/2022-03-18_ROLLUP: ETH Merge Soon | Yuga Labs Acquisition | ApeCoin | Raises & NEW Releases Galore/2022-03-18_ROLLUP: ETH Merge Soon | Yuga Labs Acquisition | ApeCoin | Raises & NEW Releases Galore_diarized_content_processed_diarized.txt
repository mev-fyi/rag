00:00:00.170 - 00:00:06.334, Speaker A: This is. This is definitely the biggest event, the biggest crypto event of 2022, maybe the biggest ever.
00:00:06.532 - 00:00:12.350, Speaker B: Right. Other than the genesis block of ethereum itself, is. This is the most significant event since that.
00:00:12.420 - 00:00:16.126, Speaker A: And so this is now. Now we've got bullish David back, I.
00:00:16.148 - 00:00:21.950, Speaker B: Think, for, for the most one to the bullish side. We got three for the bear. We got one for the bull.
00:00:24.610 - 00:00:28.950, Speaker A: And bankless nation. Happy third week of March, David. What time is it?
00:00:29.020 - 00:00:46.890, Speaker B: It's a Friday. Bankless weekly roll up time, Ryan, where we cover the entire news that happened in the last week in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, and this week is no exception. And this one a little bit different this week, I'd say just because it feels like merge week, Ryan. I don't know why it feels like merge week, but it does.
00:00:46.960 - 00:00:51.610, Speaker A: Merge week. Okay. That's the ethereum merge you're talking about. It's funny because that's still months away.
00:00:51.680 - 00:00:52.010, Speaker B: Months.
00:00:52.080 - 00:00:55.678, Speaker A: Suddenly it was like everyone was talking about the merge again.
00:00:55.844 - 00:00:57.920, Speaker B: Yeah. Including us people.
00:00:58.610 - 00:01:00.110, Speaker A: Guilty, guilty.
00:01:00.690 - 00:01:17.202, Speaker B: People have decided that the next thing to focus on is the merge. Who knows? We have like three plus months until the merge actually comes. So maybe this is just one week, and then the topic of next week will be a different topic. But this week the topic of crypto, Twitter, was definitely the merge.
00:01:17.346 - 00:01:31.058, Speaker A: Yes. We're going to talk about that ethereum merge week. Also the biggest nft m a deal ever. Apes by talk. I'm going to interview a punk holder and see how he feels about that one on today's episode.
00:01:31.154 - 00:01:34.634, Speaker B: Sure. Talk about you, Dave. All right.
00:01:34.672 - 00:01:48.462, Speaker A: And then they released a coin, too, so I don't know what that means. We're going to talk about the ape coin as well. Zuckerberg, that's Mark Zuckerberg also said NFTs are coming to Instagram. Big surprise. Not really. We knew he was going to do it. How is he going to do it? We'll talk about that later.
00:01:48.462 - 00:02:24.950, Speaker A: Also, stripe, the payment platform, fintech platform, jumping into crypto with both feet. Yeah, I think this is hugely underrated and probably the biggest thing that happened this week. And we'll have to talk about that, too. David, before we get in, we should talk about our friends at Xerion. Guys, I've loved Xerion since it launched. This is the way a bank user interface should be, except banks can't pull it off because banks are not connected to decentralized finance. You can bring your own assets to Xerion.
00:02:24.950 - 00:02:37.150, Speaker A: You cannot bring them to your Wells Fargo bank. Account. And this is what it looks like, David. They've just added a whole bunch of multi chain features, some bridging features. Tell them what's going on in Xerion these days.
00:02:37.220 - 00:03:24.026, Speaker B: Well, yeah, especially as we get into this layer two world, which we have plenty to talk about this week in the weekly roll up. It's going to require infrastructure to help manage your assets. Not just the many, many more assets that you have in your Ethereum wallet versus what you have in your bank, but also in the many, many more chains that you engage with, much more than just the ethereum l one. So not only is the ethereum ol one obviously available, but all of the Ethereum layer twos like arbitrum and optimism, and also the alternative EVM compatible layer, ones like avalanche and the other ones. And so depending on whatever chain that you are on or whatever asset that you prefer, Xerion's the place for you to go and manage all of your crypto. Just, you know, things that your bank could never do, Xerion does for you.
00:03:24.208 - 00:03:43.806, Speaker A: Really cool, too, as well, being able to bridge from one chain to another. If you want to go to Eth to Polygon in a hurry, you can do that in Xerion. You can also view all of your nfts. Lots of cool stuff going on Xerion. So, guys, check that out. There is a link in the show notes where you can connect your wallet to Xerion and get started. All right, David, this couldn't be your wallet.
00:03:43.838 - 00:03:46.210, Speaker B: Ryan, that's way too sophisticated. Nft.
00:03:46.630 - 00:03:59.110, Speaker A: Oh, this is, huh? These are really good. No, this is not my wallet, by the way. This is a demo wallet. But yeah, maybe we'll get to some of my nfts a little bit later. You noticed a little something behind me today.
00:03:59.180 - 00:04:06.700, Speaker B: Just a little bit. Yeah, I've noticed that. It's a great looking cat that's got a little bit more shine than my punk, and I'm a little bit upset by it.
00:04:07.470 - 00:04:14.206, Speaker A: It starts as a cat, and who knows what other animal could turn into maybe something with a shell. I don't know. We'll see a little bit later today.
00:04:14.228 - 00:04:20.670, Speaker B: But let's started with turtles, graduated to mfers, and now is at cats. He's starting to get into the blue chips, folks.
00:04:21.250 - 00:04:32.446, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm working my way up here. I'm learning. Okay, let's talk about the market. What's the market teaching us? What is the market telling us? Let's start with bitcoin. What's the price this week, David?
00:04:32.478 - 00:04:59.046, Speaker B: Yeah, we got a happy bitcoin this week. Ryan started at $39,000, went down and touched the low of $38,000 very briefly, and then recovered right back up and started climbing out of that hole to where it is now at $40,700, hit a high of over $41,000. So overall, up 5% on the week. So happy week could also just be a recovery off of a very bearish week the last week. So who knows?
00:04:59.238 - 00:05:03.038, Speaker A: I'm a little surprised about that. Are you surprised that we're actually going up this week?
00:05:03.204 - 00:05:06.142, Speaker B: I am conflicted that we are going up this week.
00:05:06.276 - 00:05:19.060, Speaker A: Okay. Because it was all about bearish David last very. I want to know whether bearish David has returned again this week or whether it's a more neutral David or maybe the bull David is back.
00:05:19.750 - 00:05:40.294, Speaker B: Bull David's not back. Bulldavid's not full conflicted David. Where we're going to be talking about this throughout the markets, where just macro has not changed at all and in fact has even, I would say, gotten worse. Meanwhile, the merge is just so bullish. How do I square these things? I just don't know.
00:05:40.492 - 00:05:45.754, Speaker A: You just buy more Eth is what you do. But speaking of which, tell us what the EtH price is doing this week.
00:05:45.792 - 00:06:24.866, Speaker B: Yeah, ETH started the week at $2,600, hit a low of 2500 ish dollars, and then climbed right back up out of that to where it is now at $2,800, especially in the last 24 hours at the time of recording. We always record these as Thursday morning, by the way. So where it is now is up from 2500 basically just 24 hours ago, or 2600 to 2800, kind of climbing out of that hole that it set. And then if you kind of just zoom out, Ryan, there's another chart that we have available. I don't know if you pulled it up. Yeah. The creator of these charts who drew these lines would like us to inform you that these are just meme lines.
00:06:24.866 - 00:06:47.358, Speaker B: And that's really all ta is. It's meme lines. But if you know bankless, we know that memes are real. There's a triangle. There's a triangle here. And the 2800 level of ETH price is poking through that triangle. And that has been a descending line from where it was at the start of the year for like three to four months of ETH price just descending on this line.
00:06:47.358 - 00:06:54.906, Speaker B: And it's poking through, it's poking through saying, hey, what's up on the upside of this line? So who knows?
00:06:55.098 - 00:07:11.122, Speaker A: It's trying to figure out what merge week means for the price of ETH. That's what's going on. Well, how about the ETH to bitcoin ratio? Because this is our bull market bear market indicator. When ratio goes up, we're generally more bullish. When ratio goes down, more bearish. And it's up this week.
00:07:11.176 - 00:07:55.010, Speaker B: Yeah, it's up this week. And you can see that line that I was talking about that basically started towards the end of December where the merge hit the high of. Excuse me, the merge. The ETH BTC ratio hit the high of, like, what looks like zero 80 in December, and then it has had that linear line down, setting lower highs, and just basically for the last, like, four months. So started at zero 80 in January, is at zero 80 in February, is at zero 75 to where it bottomed at basically zero 64. But since hitting that bottom at zero 64, we have climbed back out to zero 68. So there's a shape being formed here, and we actually got some charity chart stuff to look at with that, too.
00:07:55.010 - 00:08:15.770, Speaker B: So this is what was called a channel. And so we touched the bottom of that channel earlier last week, and we have bounced off of it. And so if you are perhaps a trader, you are looking at how ether is in the bottom of this channel heading back towards the top of this channel. So if it continues that. Bullish. Bullish.
00:08:16.190 - 00:08:17.178, Speaker A: What about this one?
00:08:17.264 - 00:08:43.826, Speaker B: This is a triangle. We love the shapes. We love the triangles. And so again, the concept here is that as this triangle converges, something happens at the end of this triangle. It's got to go up or it's got to go down. This is what traders look at when they look at these things. And this is a wedge, I believe, and if you'll notice, Ryan, that the wedge comes to a close right around July, right around when the merge would happen.
00:08:43.826 - 00:09:02.380, Speaker B: And so things are lining up. I don't pay attention to ta too much, but I do know that there are real reasons to look at it. And when you see an inflection point happening around the same time as something very, very fundamental, that is interesting. That's an interesting thing to look.
00:09:02.830 - 00:09:26.206, Speaker A: Okay, so we're looking at Ta. All right. We almost never do that on bankless. So I feel like we're looking at TA in this episode because you're feeling, like, conflicted. What's going to happen next? This is when you pull out the horoscopes. I'm sorry. The Ta, right, is when you're like, what's the future going to hold? Let me look at the charts.
00:09:26.206 - 00:10:05.726, Speaker A: Let me look at ta when you don't really know and it could fall one way or the other. So what is it about this market that's so conflicting right now? Is it the fundamentals of the ETH merge happening in 2022? Yet in the backdrop, we have all of this macro bad news. We've got obviously war in Ukraine, commodities, price increases, shortages everywhere. Still the tail end of COVID economy, like inflation. The Fed just raised rates, which you're going to talk to is all that macro stuff you're contending with mixed with the bullish, otherwise bullish, specifically ethereum news. Is that what's going on in your mind here?
00:10:05.748 - 00:10:24.334, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a pretty good summary. I talked about this on last week where there's so many things about the current crypto markets talking just about crypto right now that are reminiscent of the end of the cycle last year, like last gasps of the mania for people to just grab their last amount of hype and attention so they can exit.
00:10:24.382 - 00:10:28.354, Speaker A: You said last year, do you mean like last cycle, right?
00:10:28.392 - 00:11:14.286, Speaker B: Yeah, like super cringey icos and people were just participating in them because that was just like the leftover energy. And now we're seeing, we'll talk about this when we talk about the ape coin, but when people run out of ideas, what do they do? They issue tokens because that's the only idea that they have left. And ultimately that just becomes dilution and that's bearish. And so we're seeing just the attention just leave out of the whole play to earn gaming side of crypto, we're seeing attention leave out of the NFT side of crypto. We're seeing people just hanging on, on these desperate attempts for attention. And so, so much of the crypto industry just feels like it has lost the tailwinds. And on top of that, there's just all of the macro bearishness.
00:11:14.286 - 00:11:48.880, Speaker B: There's the commodity markets that just suck. Right now we're going to look at an index of equities charts and just kind of looks bad. Meanwhile, Putin is scared and in a corner and that's volatile. And so, you know that meme, Ryan, of the building that's toppling over and there are like three steel beams that are holding it up that feels like the world. And the beams that are holding it up is the merge. And so there's an infinity number of bearish things going on. But the merge is so bullish and I don't know what to do about it.
00:11:50.370 - 00:12:05.074, Speaker A: Well, maybe we'll find it out by the end of this episode once we go through the merge. How you're feeling at the end of this, David? But, yeah, I understand the conflict here. Let's talk about the bet index, because this is a nice blend, DFI, bitcoin and eth. What are we looking at on the week?
00:12:05.112 - 00:12:16.326, Speaker B: Yeah, started the week at $101, ending the week at $103.78. So up like four or 5% on the week. Three or 4% on the week. Modestly up. Modestly up.
00:12:16.508 - 00:12:43.914, Speaker A: Let's switch to some of this macro stuff for a minute and I guess our fed watch segment. So Powell came out this week. Turns out he is more hawkish than the market expected. I don't know what I expected. I kind of expected him to be hawkish in the face of inflation. Hawkish means looking to raise rates, looking to get a bit tighter on monetary policy these days. So the big news is they are increasing.
00:12:43.914 - 00:12:57.378, Speaker A: The Fed is increasing its interest rate by 25 basis points. So a quarter of a percent. I believe that's happening sometime in March. I'm not sure exactly. There's some other things we can get into. But what do you think this means? High level?
00:12:57.464 - 00:13:08.680, Speaker B: I thought this was expected. I thought the Fed raising by zero point 25% was, like, viewable from a long way off. So I kind of been confused as to how the hawkishness interpretation came about.
00:13:09.390 - 00:13:36.030, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess maybe some people thought that given events in Ukraine, that the Fed might sort of change their position. Worried about like, the r word has been used recently with commodity prices increasing, the recession word. And of course, they have to balance inflation with the threat and fear of recession. So this is also the first increase since 2018. I'd forgotten it's been that long. So that's a big deal.
00:13:36.100 - 00:14:06.566, Speaker B: Yeah, Fred was just getting into raising interest rates post, I believe, 2008 or something, and started doing that in 18. And then, boom, Covid, they just scrapped those plans. And then now they were about to start to raise interest rates, and then, boom, Russia invades Ukraine. But now this time it looks like they are not stopping the raising of interest rates because of the invasion. So maybe that's the hawkishness. It's like, oh, they didn't give us another free ride.
00:14:06.598 - 00:14:27.294, Speaker A: I guess that's the take so far. Apparently his languages. They outlined seven more hikes this year. So seven more hikes this year and then four hikes, interest rate hikes in 2023. So next year they're also planning to run down their balance sheet a little bit. So that's kind of equivalent to another hike discharging some assets from the balance sheet.
00:14:27.342 - 00:14:45.560, Speaker B: So discharging assets from the balance sheet was one of the reasons why the whole entire market turned over in December and January. And we've been bearish ever since because people were like, oh, that's actually way more aggressive in terms of interest rates increases than we ever kind of accounted for. And the markets have been bearish ever since.
00:14:46.090 - 00:15:22.366, Speaker A: Exactly. And look, people are asking the Fed to do something about inflation. That's coming from politicians now, too. But Powell also hinted that if they did eleven hikes this year, that that would not cause a recession. He used the words no recession because he said aggregate demand is strong, tight labor market. There's a tight labor market and household balance sheets are strong. So he doesn't think that these rate hikes and this more aggressive monetary policy contraction will actually lead to a recession.
00:15:22.366 - 00:15:58.270, Speaker A: That's an interesting take. And of course, look, the Fed can change its mind at any time, like between this meeting and next meeting could be a totally different story. But this is a new message coming out of the Fed. Do you remember six months ago or so, the big story on the roll ups about the Fed's action was like completely ignoring inflation. It's only temporary transitory inflation, and now this is a complete direction change, which is like, oh, inflation's here and we have to fight it. And not less than six months later, this is the new message coming out of the Fed. So that's interesting in and of itself.
00:15:58.340 - 00:16:37.082, Speaker B: Well, I mean, it sounds like they've done their research. They've certainly done more research than I have because I didn't measure the average cash on hand for the average american household. But at the same time, the game of controlling inflation and interest rates is such a game of game theory. So the Fed is like, oh, yeah, we're going to raise interest rates like seven more times in 2022. But in the back office they could be like, all right, guys, we're going to tell everyone that we're going to raise interest rates seven times in 2022, and maybe we're actually only going to do it four times. And so the market is actually also playing the game theory. Game is like, all right, so that's what they said, but what do you think they're really going to do? And it just throws everything into a ridiculous mess.
00:16:37.082 - 00:16:42.170, Speaker B: And that is why people should not be in charge of the value of money anyways.
00:16:42.830 - 00:17:00.530, Speaker A: Yeah, well, another story there, but this is what equities are doing. I think this is an interesting chart from a macro perspective, but what are you seeing in this chart, I believe this is a composite index from the Nasdaq. Basically looks like, I don't know, 20 years, something long.
00:17:00.600 - 00:17:01.854, Speaker B: Very long time horizons.
00:17:01.902 - 00:17:02.066, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:02.088 - 00:17:31.450, Speaker B: So every single candle is one month. So very long time horizons. I think we actually accidentally cut out the bottom of the chart. But you can see when Covid happened and then you can kind of see when the 2008 crash happened. Yeah. Bad. And if you look very recently, there are three, maybe four examples of a bunch of red on this chart, and one of them is, in the last four months, we've had, like, I think I see four, three or four monthly red candles in the last four months.
00:17:31.450 - 00:18:03.510, Speaker B: And when you look at how fast this is a Nasdaq composite index, when you look how fast it's gone up in the last two years, I see that. I'm pretty fearful about how much room there is to go down. And when we've noticed crypto be super correlated to traditional stock markets and the rest of the macro markets. And so if that does turn over as it's looking like it's currently doing, without any sort of recovery, that makes me scared. That makes me scared. Especially when there's a war in Europe.
00:18:04.250 - 00:18:12.234, Speaker A: Yeah. Equities could have a ways to drop, is what you're saying. That's exactly what I'm saying. Well, speaking of dropping, this is a chart we don't often look at.
00:18:12.272 - 00:18:18.874, Speaker B: We used to. We used to look at. Here's why we don't look at this chart anymore. Absolute demolishing. So we are looking.
00:18:18.912 - 00:18:19.146, Speaker A: What is.
00:18:19.168 - 00:18:42.660, Speaker B: We are looking at the Depi ETH chart, the value of Defi aggregate in ETH terms. We used to look at this chart a lot, but it kept on going down every single week. And so it stopped being alpha and started being depressing. I think the last time we reported it was something in like zero, 65 dpi per EtH. And now we are down to 00:55.
00:18:43.110 - 00:19:12.220, Speaker A: This is really since like, DFI summer basically has not. Let me see if I can max this out. Well, I had some recovery, I suppose, earlier in the year, a little bit of recovery, and this is kind of the fake out. We thought Defi was back on the rise again, but it didn't happen, at least relative to ETH. And it's just bleeding. It's just completely bleeding out as compared to ETH right now. And ETH is retaining, sucking in more value.
00:19:12.220 - 00:19:30.626, Speaker A: What do you think? Do you think this ever changes? I mean, now people go to the opposite end of the spectrum. 18 months ago, the narrative was it's all about defi. All you need is bitcoin and dfi tokens and no ETH. Those are the things that are going to accrue value. Now it's kind of flipped a little bit where people are saying ETH is.
00:19:30.728 - 00:19:31.410, Speaker B: Forever.
00:19:33.750 - 00:19:45.974, Speaker A: And you don't need DeFi tokens, right? And there's this fear almost that ETH has become so deflationary that it could suck out all of the value from the greater ethereum economy and all of the DFI tokens. What do you think?
00:19:46.012 - 00:20:13.914, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's right. I think justifying having your ethereum exposure in DFi tokens never made any sense to me. Because every time you add a token to Ethereum, you benefit ether because of EIP 1559, like the economic activity that you create by having a new token flows back into EIP 1559 via transaction fees. It doesn't work the other way. Like the value of ether going up doesn't benefit your token. It's only one way. Tokens benefit ETH.
00:20:13.914 - 00:20:43.898, Speaker B: ETH doesn't benefit tokens. And so you get exposure to every single token on ethereum by just holding ETH. And so when you look at the defi bleed versus eth is kind of what you would expect, especially when a lot of Defi has high issuance from yield farming versus ether, which is quote unquote deflationary. Not in practice but in theory and later in practice, this is kind of what you would expect. This is what happens when your base money is deflationary. Everything else kind of goes to zero in relation to it.
00:20:44.064 - 00:20:49.370, Speaker A: But do you think this will happen forever? Surely DeFI tokens will have a resurgence, won't they?
00:20:49.440 - 00:21:02.638, Speaker B: Yeah, they can have a resurgence, but then it can continue to still happen forever. Ryan, we could have a bullish year for DeFi tokens and then once again it can resume its towards zero trend versus think.
00:21:02.724 - 00:21:42.362, Speaker A: Personally, I think that what's going to shake out is somewhat in the middle, right? I think that now we're on the other, that's not a side of the narrative. I just think that we go overboard on narratives, right? So in one direction it was like ETH is going to have no value and is all defi tokens. Now we're probably on the other side of that pendulum swing where everyone's like, well, ETH is going to slurp out all of the value of Defi. There won't ever be DeFI tokens that are accruing value relative to ETH. And I kind of think that's the time you want to start looking at DeFi a bit more aggressively. Right. It's hard when you are denominating your returns in ETh to do that.
00:21:42.362 - 00:22:51.566, Speaker A: But I do think there are going to be some real winners and some real champions on the DFI side that gain relative to Eth. But there's one, I think, compounding factor here that we have to figure out, and we haven't figured this out yet, and I think it's going to be an important, I guess, part of the investment thesis to figure out in 2022, which is like, will the new DFI token winners be the winners from the past? Right. There was this idea that we'd have a bunch of blue chip DFI tokens that would continue to grow and expand. What if the turnover is a lot tighter? What if the winners on Ethereum are not going to be the same as the winners in the l two ecosystem, or the winners on alternative chains? What if they're all of these new separate winners? And how do you bake that into the calculation? Because even the DPi, it's just really the Ethereum blue chip tokens, the biggest tokens by value there. So that's another piece of the puzzle, I think, to sort out, and I don't think the market has figured that out either, which is why the prices are so depressed.
00:22:51.678 - 00:23:25.600, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And I have similar thoughts about the NFT ecosystem, is that NFTs as a whole can be bullish, but that's just because people are rotating from one NFT to another to another. And the NFT ecosystem is really just this shelling point game as to which is the next NFT. That's going to be hot, right? And we leave all the other previous ones behind. And the aggregate defi market cap could certainly grow, and perhaps it can even grow faster than the eth market cap. But that doesn't actually mean that's instantiated into a single asset that you can purchase, because the growth happens.
00:23:27.170 - 00:23:33.546, Speaker A: Even a single index is hard to capture it all. And it's not capturing it all. That's what DPI is not capturing.
00:23:33.578 - 00:23:59.080, Speaker B: And that's why there's always alpha on the margins of DeFi, because not even the indices are going to be able to capture the upsides from these new tokens, because for every good winner of a token, there's going to be a hundred negative bad tokens that the indexes, you can't just accept all of them. And so that's always why there's going to be investment into DeFi is because there's alpha at the margins, and then by the time it gets into the indices, the alpha is probably already taken.
00:23:59.690 - 00:24:26.114, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Well, just more work to do here, obviously, more research to do. That is the simplest approach. I mean, you need to get an index of exposure to everything. Speaking of ETH prices, one price in Ethereum economy that is down is Ethereum gas prices. This is a fantastic dashboard on dune analytics created by Hildabi. Yeah.
00:24:26.114 - 00:24:54.454, Speaker A: And so this is showing us gas costs. We'll include this as a resource for you so you can kind of see gas costs over time. Recently, they've spiked. By recently, I mean, like in the past few hours, I believe. I was looking at this chart earlier, 24 hours, I was looking at this chart earlier, and the prices to move like ETH were like a dollar or something like this. Now they're up to $5 on Ethereum. But what is this showing us overall, David, with the gas prices?
00:24:54.502 - 00:25:24.786, Speaker B: Well, it's definitely showing us over the last few months or so that gas prices have kind of hit new lows. I think over the last, like three months or so, the median gas price was 22 guay, which we have not seen in a very long time. But this is just a very useful gas board because it shows you time of day and where the spikes happen. Time of day and also on days of the week. It's just actually just a really useful resource. I think we're going to be keeping this in the roll up all the time. But here it is over the last day, week and months.
00:25:24.786 - 00:26:01.230, Speaker B: Blue is in month. Over the past month, the average gwe price, if you take the peak of that chart, I think, is something like 30 Gwe. And over the last week, it was something like 22 Gwe for your average gas prices. Super low, super low, super low. But then the market movements today, along with the board apes token, which we'll talk about later, we definitely saw a spike above 175 gWe. So there's always life somewhere. But generally depressed gas prices, which is a plus one to the bear side of the argument, by the way.
00:26:01.300 - 00:26:14.082, Speaker A: Let it be clear, depressed gas prices are now a bear market indicator, and I guess they always have been. Although people have been saying that high ETH gas prices are bearish for ETH as well.
00:26:14.136 - 00:26:16.930, Speaker B: Yeah, haters will say anything's bearish for ETH.
00:26:18.090 - 00:26:38.570, Speaker A: Visa versus Ethereum volume. Look at this. In 2021, visa moved 10.4 trillion in payments volume. Ethereum moved $11.6 trillion. I think we've talked about this before, but it just warrants repeating that last year, Ethereum moved more in payments volume than the visa network.
00:26:38.570 - 00:26:47.870, Speaker A: That's aggregate of ETH tokens and stablecoins and everything else on ethereum. That's a pretty big milestone to cross in my mind.
00:26:47.940 - 00:27:11.350, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think this is just taking into account stablecoins. I think that's what payments volume must mean is stablecoin transfers, which means it's apples to apples, folks. This isn't like ERC 20 dfi token transfers versus visas, settlement and networks for dollars. This is dollars to dollars. So apples to apples comparison and ether. Ethereum one.
00:27:11.350 - 00:27:13.190, Speaker B: So nice job, ethereum.
00:27:16.650 - 00:27:31.050, Speaker A: Let's talk about this. Oh, airdrops. That's what the topic is right now. So do you hold or sell airdrops? Let me ask you, what's your personal strategy? The airdrops you received last year, do you hold or did you sell or did it depend?
00:27:31.120 - 00:27:33.738, Speaker B: Almost all of them I sold except for Ens.
00:27:33.834 - 00:27:34.574, Speaker A: Almost all of them.
00:27:34.612 - 00:27:37.440, Speaker B: Almost all of them except for Ens. Ens I still have.
00:27:37.890 - 00:27:55.220, Speaker A: Well, I haven't claimed it yet, if that is the profitable move. And maybe this is obviously people who've been paying attention to airdrops over the past year or so, but look at these charts. Airdrops. What are we seeing here?
00:27:56.150 - 00:28:29.390, Speaker B: Uniswap going and spiking from where it got claimed at $3 up to $40 and then down to $10. But $10, oh, that's where it is now. So actually, technically it's still winner, depending on when you sold it. But what we're really looking at is like it's claimed, it goes up, then it goes down, and it usually goes up first and then down later. But this is just another articulation of what we were talking about earlier with the Defi versus eth. But I guess this is actually versus dollars now, isn't it? Which is even worse.
00:28:29.970 - 00:28:35.134, Speaker A: Yeah. So I guess the message here is when you get an airdrop, sell it immediately.
00:28:35.262 - 00:28:45.970, Speaker B: No, usually it's safe to wait between eight and 24 hours. Usually it pumps and then you sell it.
00:28:46.040 - 00:28:52.966, Speaker A: I feel like that's fairly immediate, though. Sell in the first few days or the first week has been the profitable move thus far.
00:28:52.988 - 00:28:57.698, Speaker B: Have your finger over the sell button. Yeah, sell for ETh.
00:28:57.874 - 00:29:02.506, Speaker A: I wonder if that ever reverses or ever changes, if airdrops will become.
00:29:02.688 - 00:29:12.190, Speaker B: See, the thing is, maybe that's just the nature are issuance, and issuance is inflationary and inflationary is dilutive, and that's all bearishness.
00:29:12.770 - 00:29:24.782, Speaker A: Airdrops are also a fantastic way to get your coin into every crypto media publication onto everyone's radar. Attention, Twitter, Reddit. Yes.
00:29:24.836 - 00:29:26.210, Speaker B: You get one week of attention.
00:29:26.790 - 00:29:42.022, Speaker A: Right? So you see these, they're almost like attention spikes, particularly for some of these really small market cap tokens. I'm not sure what this is, but I think that happened like SOS. Do you remember that one that happened in December? Just a quick spike and then it's gone. Whatever.
00:29:42.076 - 00:29:52.966, Speaker B: Talks about attention spikes. Wow. I think we should log that one because so many charts in crypto are not just charts of the price, but actually are just proxies for people's attention.
00:29:53.158 - 00:29:59.354, Speaker A: They really are, aren't they? Three rs capital is putting some attention on ETh right now.
00:29:59.392 - 00:29:59.690, Speaker B: Right?
00:29:59.760 - 00:30:01.142, Speaker A: What's this transaction?
00:30:01.206 - 00:30:30.946, Speaker B: Yeah. Because three rs capital is so large, it's very easy to figure out which addresses are there. So they have, basically everyone has their addresses tagged and one of their addresses added 40,500 ether, about $112,000,000 about at 02:00 a.m. Last night. So it'll be a little bit more than 24 hours ago from the listeners perspective when they are listening to this on Friday. So 3 hours capital. The rotators rotating into ease ahead of the merge.
00:30:30.946 - 00:30:31.750, Speaker B: Here we go.
00:30:31.820 - 00:30:36.790, Speaker A: Oh, man. How long ago was it? The Ethereum is abandoning its users tweet.
00:30:37.210 - 00:30:38.698, Speaker B: Like four months ago.
00:30:38.864 - 00:30:39.754, Speaker A: Four months ago.
00:30:39.792 - 00:30:40.602, Speaker B: Four or five months ago.
00:30:40.656 - 00:30:41.034, Speaker A: Back in.
00:30:41.072 - 00:30:44.170, Speaker B: Yeah, it was right back in unabandoners.
00:30:46.110 - 00:31:00.298, Speaker A: Let's talk about this. So a few things on Tara Do Kwan. His list, number one is he is buying. Tara is planning to buy $10 billion worth of bitcoin for its reserves.
00:31:00.394 - 00:31:02.880, Speaker B: Ten, which is billion. What?
00:31:03.910 - 00:31:05.038, Speaker A: Pretty impressive.
00:31:05.134 - 00:31:06.980, Speaker B: How much does Michael Saylor have?
00:31:08.230 - 00:31:17.934, Speaker A: I don't think he has 10 billion. No, there's no way he has 10 billion. I mean, that's absolutely massive. And how are they doing this? Of course, it's the value of Luna.
00:31:17.982 - 00:31:18.530, Speaker B: Right?
00:31:18.680 - 00:31:55.598, Speaker A: So on one side, it's like you're taking your Luna token proceeds and you're diversifying into bitcoin and using that as a reserve. Do Kwan says this is going to open a new monetary era of the bitcoin standard. And you know what this kind of reminds me of a little bit is actually what eos did, and people are going to hate that. I just compared eos to Luna, and I'm not comparing them in all respects, but in this respect, Eos did. They raised a whole bunch of bitcoin and etH. They sold the vast majority of their eTh. They kept their bitcoin.
00:31:55.598 - 00:32:21.750, Speaker A: It's like billions of dollars worth of bitcoin on reserve for EOS. And I have no idea what they're actually doing with that right now, but it's kind of like a way to get cheap bitcoin. How the issuance of EOS. And they sold it when EOS was much higher than it is today. I'm not saying that's exactly what's happening here, but it feels a little similar. What's your take on this, David?
00:32:21.910 - 00:33:23.494, Speaker B: So I'm not an expert in the dynamics between behind the terra ecosystem, but they have like the terra USD, which they are saying that this 10 billion in bitcoin is going to be like the backstop for it. Kind of like how the Federal Reserve has gold and other foreign reserve assets to shore up the value of the US dollar if the time ever comes to it. Right? Like they can use their treasuries to protect the peg or protect the value of the currency. In my mind, this is just signaling a lack of confidence on the nature of your own asset. Like, why can't you use your own money to back your stablecoin? If you have confidence on the long term sustainability of your own ecosystem, why do you need an alternative store of value to backstop the value of your stablecoin? And plus, if the value of USt of terra USD depends on something external to the Luna protocol, that's an external dependency. That is not cryptographic, that is trust. You have to have the security of your own network solved inside of your own network.
00:33:23.494 - 00:33:35.940, Speaker B: You can't have an external money be the thing that props up the value of your stablecoin. So to me, this just shows a lack of confidence in the value of Luna because they have to go elsewhere to have their store of value.
00:33:36.470 - 00:34:32.094, Speaker A: And that's exactly, you know what I guess it seems like to me is it feels a bit more like you sold stocks to buy some. It's like, this is why I've always thought that Luna and the tarot ecosystem is a bit more on the fintech side of the spectrum than an ethereum or bitcoin are on kind of the hard sound money end of the spectrum. Right? And I guess from Terrace perspective, if you don't think the Luna coin is actually like money, a monetary asset, then what you're doing is you're taking some of your equity, almost like some of your stock, and you are exchanging that for a real money, like a much harder money. And you're kind of doing the fintech play too, because you're sort of holding that to backstop your assets. So I guess maybe it makes sense from that perspective.
00:34:32.222 - 00:34:34.900, Speaker B: But that perspective also doesn't make sense.
00:34:36.470 - 00:34:39.430, Speaker A: I mean, we're not here for new fintech.
00:34:39.770 - 00:34:44.390, Speaker B: We are here for the cryptographic futures with no external dependencies.
00:34:44.890 - 00:34:54.902, Speaker A: That's the bankless take. This is also interesting. Do Kwana in the news. So there was a wager of some sort. A bet of some sort. What was this bet, David?
00:34:54.966 - 00:35:45.814, Speaker B: This was a bet created on Twitter, and so do Kwan, the founder of Terra Luna, and this sensei Algod, which is like a crypto trader Twitter account. We're going at it about the future value of Luna. And so Doequan proposes a $1 million us tether bet. Ust bet. So basically, dollars between Sensei all God and Doequan himself saying that in one year's time from March 14, if the price of Luna is higher than $88, doquan pockets the million dollars. And if it's lower, then Sensei God pockets a million dollars. It's just always a great popcorn season to see the founders of layer ones bet about the future price of their layer one asset, especially after it just flipped Salana.
00:35:45.814 - 00:36:20.502, Speaker B: Right. And so some big cockiness going on on Twitter right now and then, actually, it got raised, right? Not raised by that particular person, but a second person came in with another $10 million offer to take the same bet, which Doequan also accepted. So Doequan has $11 million in exposure in the bet against $88 Luna on March 14, 2023. Going back to the whole fintech thing, this kind of feels like Elon Musk when he tweeted out, don't short Tesla like, I'll wreck you.
00:36:20.556 - 00:36:20.822, Speaker A: Yes.
00:36:20.876 - 00:36:26.278, Speaker B: Yeah. And so you would never, ever see Vitalik making a statement like this.
00:36:26.444 - 00:36:27.234, Speaker A: Can you imagine?
00:36:27.282 - 00:36:28.210, Speaker B: Could you imagine?
00:36:28.290 - 00:36:42.538, Speaker A: Jesus. It's just a completely different culture and founder DNA there. And it does feel a bit more elon musk. And it feels a lot less Satoshi. It feels a lot less vitalik.
00:36:42.554 - 00:36:53.502, Speaker B: Yes, very much is what it is. I'm sorry, but when I see l one founders making $11 million bets against the value of their assets in one year, I am.
00:36:53.556 - 00:36:54.586, Speaker A: Don't tell me it makes you bearish.
00:36:54.618 - 00:37:00.914, Speaker B: The whole industry. That is a bearish signal. We are plus two to the bear side of the equation today.
00:37:01.112 - 00:37:08.654, Speaker A: Well, we looked at that chart, too, the Luna chart in our conversation with Ledger earlier in the week. And it's just an absolute massive chart.
00:37:08.702 - 00:37:08.866, Speaker B: Right?
00:37:08.888 - 00:37:12.950, Speaker A: It's like from $0.30 all the way up to what is Terra, right? Now or what is Luna right now?
00:37:13.020 - 00:37:34.094, Speaker B: It is I was looking at a second ago, it is at $87, $32 billion market cap versus salon at $29 billion market cap. How do you buy $10 billion of bitcoin on a $32 billion market cap? How much are you going to have to liquidate? You're going to send that thing down to zero.
00:37:34.292 - 00:37:37.934, Speaker A: You do that very slowly, I think is how you do it.
00:37:37.972 - 00:38:04.002, Speaker B: I'm sorry, maybe quickly as well. When tarot was like $0.30, like a year ago and now it's at $87 and now the founder is saying, oh, we're going to market by $10 billion worth of bitcoin. How much bigger of a red flag do you need? Where do you think that money is coming from? He's going to market dump Terra to buy bitcoin. Fact check me on this, listeners. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe they from elsewhere.
00:38:04.066 - 00:38:21.914, Speaker A: But like, wow, I'm sure we will get fact checked. But yes, some of these definitely send the senses, the spidey senses tingling a little bit. Guys, we will be right back with the raises of the week, the releases of the week, and of course merge week.
00:38:21.952 - 00:38:22.394, Speaker B: Merge week.
00:38:22.432 - 00:38:26.078, Speaker A: But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:38:26.164 - 00:39:02.838, Speaker B: Living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys, and that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet. And brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the ledger nanos plus, a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet. With more memory and a larger screen, the Nanos plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions. And the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your NFT. What you see is what you sign. The Nanos plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things. So go to the ledger website to check out the features of the new Ledger Nanos plus and join the waitlist to get yours.
00:39:02.838 - 00:39:42.470, Speaker B: And don't forget about the cryptolife card. Also powered by Ledger, the CL card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app, right next to all the defi apps and services that you're already used to doing, like swapping tokens and staking. So if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet, go to ledger.com, grab a ledger, and take control over your crypto. So you've got some money, but how are you going to use it you want to spend you me shopping now, bro, when you know you should be saving. You'll never buy a house at this rate. But what if you could spend and save at the same time for the enlightened kind? With inquiring minds, a new world awaits.
00:39:42.470 - 00:40:28.222, Speaker B: Set yourself free with completely flexible self repaying loan technology supported on desktop and mobile. Seize the power of Alchemyx, allowing you to spend and save at the same time. Leverage your wealth without risk of liquidation. Take out a loan that repays itself by using yield from your deposit to pay off your balance. Your only debt is time. What was once inconceivable is now within your grasp. Bankless is proud to be sponsored by Uniswap Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure.
00:40:28.222 - 00:41:05.338, Speaker B: Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum that lets you trade any token at the current market price. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on Ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. The Uniswap grants program is accepting applications for grants. Do you have something of value that you think you want to contribute to the uniswap ecosystem? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a unique grant@uniswapgrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go. Thank you, Uniswap, for sponsoring bankless.
00:41:05.434 - 00:41:21.560, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back with the releases of the week. We got to start here. Stripe now supports crypto. This is a really big deal. Stripe is a payment processing company. Provide a whole bunch of APIs to basically the traditional banking system. We use stripe on bank list.
00:41:21.560 - 00:41:53.890, Speaker A: It's a pretty fantastic product. Overall, I think these guys are doing $8 billion in revenue. They have 4000 employees, and they are launching support for crypto businesses of all kinds. All sorts of things they're doing here. A crypto powered fiat payment API. I think what they're doing is basically connecting crypto rails to their existing set of payment APIs. So it's like crypto to bank bridge, if you will, an on ramp if you will.
00:41:53.890 - 00:41:55.618, Speaker A: Really cool stuff here. Yeah.
00:41:55.704 - 00:42:22.266, Speaker B: When Ryan said stripe is supporting crypto, very high level nebulous statement, right? What does that even mean? They are supporting crypto in every single way. KYC, fiat, onramps exchange, stablecoin exchanges, credit card to stablecoin transfers like native wallets they're doing it all. They're doing it. And this is not just a little bit, this is a lot of it. This is the full, I feel like.
00:42:22.368 - 00:42:30.034, Speaker A: It came out of nowhere suddenly, bam. Stripes here. And then all of these products they just released, even NFT marketplaces.
00:42:30.102 - 00:42:30.926, Speaker B: Right? Yeah.
00:42:31.028 - 00:42:33.246, Speaker A: With an identity type of solution. Yeah.
00:42:33.268 - 00:42:58.610, Speaker B: So payments and KYC baked in. This is the type of release that gets a lot of institutions and businesses who are crypto scared to start being crypto enabled and start being crypto curious. Like, oh, we can like stripe. I'm familiar with Stripe. I'm familiar with their brand. They are big on compliance. They're heavily regulated, and they're letting me do crypto things.
00:42:58.610 - 00:43:05.574, Speaker B: So I expect us to get a ton of adoption from a lot of businesses that maybe were crypto curious but didn't know how to do it well.
00:43:05.612 - 00:43:22.166, Speaker A: Totally. And I think even an example is for us, David. So we use a platform for our newsletter called, you know, if you want to pay in pay, stripe is basically the platform that powers all of Substac. We've been asking Substac forever to take crypto payments forever.
00:43:22.278 - 00:43:22.810, Speaker B: So simple.
00:43:22.880 - 00:43:32.698, Speaker A: Take Eth, can you take 20s? Can you integrate that? And it's always just like, it's too much work. No, we just use Stripe. No, as somebody who's now integrated crypto.
00:43:32.714 - 00:43:35.454, Speaker B: Payments into a web app before, it's not that hard.
00:43:35.652 - 00:44:26.238, Speaker A: Yeah, well, so they didn't want to, for whatever reason. Maybe it was regulatory, maybe it was some additional, but now if it's incorporated, if it's part of Stripe, you can guess that's going to be a feature that Substack is going to add. And under the covers of probably so many of the services used today, like the Shopify's, where you buy clothes, all the retail stuff like e commerce online, your software as a service, subscriptions. Stripe is behind the scenes there. And so now what you're going to see over the next few weeks and months is another, like, pay via crypto type button. And so just as you check out with stripe, you can just pay via, like, that's what's happening. So this is a massive move because it's happening at kind of the base back end layer of the Internet and how payments work on the Internet for all sorts of different websites.
00:44:26.238 - 00:44:38.466, Speaker A: And this is just, we call it the defi mullet thesis. Right. This is just crypto, like getting in the back there and having fintech, the stripes of the world, be the front end for them. So it's really cool to see yeah.
00:44:38.488 - 00:45:00.594, Speaker B: We are having the crypto lead at Stripe on the podcast later in the month after we wanted to get them on for this coming Tuesday state of the nation. And they were like, no. We still have a number of announcements and releases to get out the door, so let's come in one month's time after those get released. So there is more coming out of stripe. There is your bankless alpha. More coming out of stripe.
00:45:00.742 - 00:45:16.826, Speaker A: That's super impressive. Speaking of impressive, Ave v three, they just launched what is included in Ave's. Yeah, that deserves applause, guys. Ave v three, it's here. What's it include? David?
00:45:16.858 - 00:45:37.910, Speaker B: Oh, it's got so much stuff, Ryan. A bunch of just like quality of life features and upgrades, I would say. So. It's not like anything. It's still a money market that didn't change, but basically everything under the hood has gotten an improvement. So you can do cross chain transactions. So Ave is going to be on basically every single EVM chain, whether it's a roll up or another l one.
00:45:37.910 - 00:46:28.786, Speaker B: And you can go from Ave to Ave to Ave directly through the web app through this thing called portal. They also have what they are calling high efficiency mode, which just unlocks more capital efficiency, more borrowing power isolation mode, which allows assets to get listed that doesn't have second or third order consequences to the rest of the Ave markets. So maybe some high risk token comes in, but they don't want the collateral backing that thing to have contagion risk to the rest of the market. So they have kind of like compartmentalized markets. That's cool. More gas optimizations, which they say are reducing gas by 20% to 25%, and additional risk management tools and various things like that. So you can read more in their blog, or just go ahead and use Ave v three on any of your preferred layer twos.
00:46:28.978 - 00:47:21.434, Speaker A: It's actually not on Ethereum main net yet, though. That's kind of the last they're getting to. So their deployment approach is super interesting. They hit all of the alternative layer ones that have EVM support, so the phantoms and the avalanches and the harmonies of the world, and then also the layer twos like arbitrum and optimism and Polygon, but they've not yet deployed on Ethereum maintenance. They're almost using these other side chains and layer twos as kind of not quite a test environment, but their initial release environment before they deploy to Ethereum. But the cool thing about this too is, right out of the gate, you can access ave v three on one inch, paraswap Xerion, which you talked about earlier, zapper dbank any other interface you use and wallet you use. So it's like a quick roll up and a rollout and deployment here, which is really awesome to see.
00:47:21.434 - 00:47:27.580, Speaker A: But they weren't the only ones that just released a point upgrade. So alchemy v two is here.
00:47:28.190 - 00:47:34.382, Speaker B: Yes, we like it. Should we go into alchemy's V two? V two is cool.
00:47:34.436 - 00:47:34.814, Speaker A: Tell us.
00:47:34.852 - 00:48:11.414, Speaker B: Because there's just more vaults, I would say, I think is the big upgrade. You have different possibilities with the collaterals that you want to put into alchemy. So V two allows for the arbitrary number of collateral tokens and also new yield strategies. So you get to pick your own collateral and you get to pick your own yield strategy. So you can kind of custom fit how the Alchemyx protocol works from you. Token adapters are written and audited for V two, and they can add an ever increasing selection of yield providers for your deposits on alchemyx. So Alchemyx uses urine to get yield, but now they are also opening up direct markets into ave or into compound.
00:48:11.414 - 00:48:27.038, Speaker B: So you can source your yield from a specific part of DFI with a specific stablecoin. And so just a lot more composability and a lot more just user power. And that's what these applications are supposed to do, is bestow power upon the users. And that is what Alchemyx V two is all about.
00:48:27.124 - 00:48:30.654, Speaker A: What's the high level for what Alchemyx does for people who aren't familiar with it?
00:48:30.692 - 00:49:04.854, Speaker B: Yeah, so it is a loan. It's like you can get your interest payments paid to you up front. So you put stablecoins in and then you can borrow stablecoins against your stablecoins, and the stablecoins that you deposited earn yield. And they just is kind of like a proxy for urine, right? So right now, urine is like 3%. You put $10,000 into Alchemyx and you get that 3% because it's yield. Farming your stablecoins in urine. But then Alchemyx lets you borrow up to 50% of your deposited stablecoins.
00:49:04.854 - 00:49:44.934, Speaker B: And so you put like $10,000 in, you can borrow $5,000 and go do whatever with it. While that $10,000 is earning yield in DFI, what you can also do is you can take that $5,000 that you borrowed from alchemy and you can put it back into Alchemyx. So you can get off of $10,000. Of deposits, you can get like $15,000 worth of stablecoin yield. So it's a way to juice up your yield. You can also do this with ETH, but it's basically a way to get your. So that, like $5,000 that you borrowed, you lock up $10,000, but that's like, technically $5,000 of interest payments that are paid to you up front that you can go do stuff with.
00:49:44.972 - 00:50:03.222, Speaker A: It's something you can't do in the real world. Right. Because it's the ability to pull forward all of these interest payments, receive it in one lump sum, and then go do whatever you want with that lump sum. It was pretty wild, pretty cool. Okay, so Coinbase, they are also testing fee free trading.
00:50:03.286 - 00:50:05.100, Speaker B: This is actually kind of. Yeah.
00:50:05.710 - 00:50:24.210, Speaker A: So what's this subtitle here, I think is important. Trading fees have historically made up the bulk of Coinbase's revenue, but they're trying to diversify their business lines. So no longer being dependent on fees for trading and switching out their business model a little bit. What do you think this means?
00:50:24.280 - 00:50:57.866, Speaker B: Yeah, trading fees, transaction fees on exchanges has always been the dominant source of revenue for everything. FTX, Coinbase, Gemini basis, points of fees on the. I mean, the crypto industry is so hyper competitive that these fees have compressed, especially as more and more exchanges have come online and really competed with each other. And so what is the ultimate form of compression is going to zero. But then instead, the way that you get revenue is by charging a subscription model. So this is a subscription model. You can now subscribe to Coinbase in order to get fee free trading.
00:50:57.866 - 00:51:09.730, Speaker B: This has actually been in the works for a while, and they finally released it. But I bet you this is not going to be the last time that we see a subscription model for exchanges. So you can get fee free trading. That's kind of a hard thing to say. I hope I don't have.
00:51:09.800 - 00:51:42.966, Speaker A: That was hard to say, man. Fee free trading. This is something new as well. The crypto sleuthing firm, chainalysis, you've heard us talk about them before. That's a good term for what they are, is basically they look at the blockchain, all of these transactions, they try to de anonymize it. And, yeah, they sell it to government agencies or exchanges, whoever else needs to know they are launching sanctioned screening tools for Defi, for daos, sanctions, screening tools. This headline makes me very uncomfortable.
00:51:42.966 - 00:51:44.282, Speaker A: I do not love this headline.
00:51:44.346 - 00:52:12.786, Speaker B: Okay, so there's two products that they've released. One is on chain one's off chain. So the off chain one is an API designed for web and mobile apps and web services. Users can receive an API key, which they can check if an address of interest is on the sanctions list or not. So basically you get to automate like, hey, this Ethereum address just signed up for my web app. Is it on the sanctions list? And chainalysis can come back and say yes or no. They also are offering an on chain oracle for smart contracts.
00:52:12.786 - 00:52:35.866, Speaker B: So smart contracts can basically have the same checks like smart contract, like money just gets deposited into a smart contract. That smart contract pings the chain analysis on chain Oracle and says, hey, is this address on the sanctions list? And the smart contract oracle on Ethereum will ping you yes or no. How do you feel about that, Ryan?
00:52:36.058 - 00:53:31.440, Speaker A: I feel terrible. I think it's terrible. I hate this. I hate that this exists. Now, of course, protocols aren't necessarily integrating this, right? And there can be wallets that integrate it or choose not to, but I feel like this gives the surveillance state and like the sanctioned state another way to basically mandate things in DeFi. So what if you can't really have a non custodial crypto wallet service like a metamask located in the US, unless it is doing this sanction checking with chain analysis, unless it has that feature. And then it's very easy for third parties, government states, to create a list of ETH addresses that are blacklisted for whatever reason, right? Maybe it's for a good reason, maybe it's not for a good reason.
00:53:31.440 - 00:54:04.650, Speaker A: And once they do that, then that can be pushed out into some of the DeFi tools that we have today. Of course they can't get this at the base layer. They can't get this into the smart contract code of a Uniswap, for example. They can't get this into Ethereum, but it's not great. And it's not surprising to me that chain analysis would see this as a massive opportunity. But I guess AMl Defi is coming this year. It's probably here.
00:54:04.720 - 00:54:55.450, Speaker B: Sick. I'm looking forward to it. I'm joking, obviously, for listeners who want a hypothetical scenario, take for example how people were asking crypto exchanges to deplatform russian customers in compliance with sanctions and then Coinbase and others actually ended up doing it. In theory, you could see that same thing where all russian users coming from russian IP address or have russian KYC get added to a sanctions list. And parts of DeFi are like, oh, do you have a russian address? Because we know of that because how you signed up for this centralized service, well, now you're on the sanctions list. So any sort of DeFi app that integrates with chainalysis is now giving over powers towards nation state governance.
00:54:56.830 - 00:55:14.058, Speaker A: The only way around this, I see, David, is privacy on the base layer. It's like privacy services, or l two, privacy. It's the only way around this, because if chain analysis can derive the identity of certain addresses, they will. And then they will propagate that into the rest of DFI infrastructure.
00:55:14.154 - 00:55:50.780, Speaker B: Yeah, and I've always been conflicted about chain analysis just because, well, it's basically like the teacher's pet of the government. It's like the NARC in the room that reminds the teacher that they forgot to collect the homework. But also, at the same time, if not chain analysis, it would just be another different surveillance company. The value of who's going to be the snoop of the blockchain is going to be captured by someone. So this inevitable when you have public blockchains, somebody's going to make a business around breaking everyone else's privacy about it. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we have to like it.
00:55:51.710 - 00:56:01.902, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think that is the next battle that crypto will have to fight, is privacy on the base layer and different solutions for that, which we have plenty of.
00:56:01.956 - 00:56:04.286, Speaker B: So I have no long term fears. Yeah.
00:56:04.468 - 00:56:15.734, Speaker A: Aztec for one. I think a lot of this will be built out on layer two. Maybe that's some more content we'll have to put together in the future, David. But enough of that for now. Let's talk about volts. What are they doing with the Uniswap community? Yeah.
00:56:15.772 - 00:57:00.098, Speaker B: Volts is a DFI primitive that is trying to bring interest rate swaps to DFI, kind of similar to element finance, but with a very different construction. But inside of the Volts architecture is the need for something like Uniswap v three, concentrated liquidity. But Uniswap V three has a license, and so they have offered 1% of volts tokens to access Uniswap v three code inside of the Volts architecture, to which Uniswap governance gave an overwhelming support of. Yes. So volts requested permission from Uniswap to use the Uniswap V three license code for 1% of volts tokens. And that got approved, which is kind of cool. Kind of cool.
00:57:00.184 - 00:57:21.506, Speaker A: That's kind of an interesting collaboration, for sure. All right, David, let's switch gears. Let's talk about raises this week. The first one, Coinbase, they just raised $450,000,000 on a $7 billion valuation. This is mostly on the back of metamask, which just topped 30 million users. Pretty big valuation for consensus, though. What are your thoughts?
00:57:21.698 - 00:57:35.254, Speaker B: I thought this is like the third raise of the year for consensus. They are just, like, pulling it in, like, coming out of the depths of the bear market. Really turned it around, because for those that weren't around during the bear market, the consensus laid off a ton of people because basically Joe Lubin was selling.
00:57:35.302 - 00:57:37.166, Speaker A: Like 20% or something. Right? That's it.
00:57:37.188 - 00:57:38.414, Speaker B: I thought it was more than that.
00:57:38.532 - 00:57:40.542, Speaker A: 20, 30%, something. Yeah, a lot.
00:57:40.596 - 00:58:18.940, Speaker B: Yeah. I thought it was interesting that in one of their tweets, they said, in this raise, some of this money is going to be saved to specifically buy ultrasound money is what they called it. All proceeds from this round will be converted to ETH to further build consensus's ultrasound money position as a rebalance. To rebalance its ETH to fiat ratio in lines with Consensus's treasury strategy. So they drained their ETH treasury in 2018 trying to fund the company, and now they're buying it back. So they were kind of the reason why ETH went to $80, but now they're buying it back at whatever the price is now. $2,800.
00:58:19.470 - 00:58:44.546, Speaker A: Yeah, and they're doing some great work, too, obviously, with metamask and some of these things, so I'm glad they continued to be well funded. All right, speaking of well funded raises, here's another one. Optimism. They just raised at a over $1 billion valuation. I'm not sure how much the valuation is here, David, but optimism, of course, an EVM compatible layer two. Pretty awesome that they're getting funded as well.
00:58:44.568 - 00:59:27.750, Speaker B: Oh, not just EVM compatible, Ryan, but EVM equivalent, $1.65 billion valuation paradigm and a 16 z. And optimism is, like I said, the EVM equivalent version of an optimistic roll up, which has a bunch of tailwind effects, because you get to strap into the network effects of Ethereum itself, because the difference between optimism and Ethereum is trying to be reduced down to the bare minimum. And they're also having a very public goods ethos aligned culture with Ethereum itself. So here's a quote from Jing, the CEO. We are making revenue out of the sequencing for the optimism layer two. We're giving all that revenue back towards funding public goods on Ethereum.
00:59:27.750 - 00:59:56.058, Speaker B: We don't want to say that we want to be decentralized. We also want to show the community that we're setting up our own incentives to be compatible with that. So they are innovating on this thing called retroactive public goods funding. And if you want to learn more about that, I did a show with Austin Griffith where we unpacked public goods funding, and so there's more details all about that there. Everyone's really hyped about optimism. Really nice to see them get the funding to take their project for the rest of the way because it's super, super ambitious and they deserve it all.
00:59:56.224 - 01:00:30.674, Speaker A: Starquare next. At $6 billion valuation, they just raised a, let's see, $100 million after just receiving a $50 million valuation. That was just a few months ago at a $2 billion valuation. Series C, that was in November. So layer twos continue to be well funded. Salana based NFT, an NFT marketplace on Salana called Eden just raised a $27 million series A. This feels kind of like the open sea of Salana.
01:00:30.722 - 01:00:31.750, Speaker B: Filling that niche.
01:00:32.170 - 01:01:00.046, Speaker A: Yeah, filling that niche. They've got like 90% of market share of nfts on Salana. What's interesting about this, I think, is the question of will every single independent chain and ecosystem, maybe layer two, will they have their own category winners and sets of apps? Will they have their own openseas, their own uniswaps, automated market makers, their own ave's that are separate and distinct from the ones that have won out on Ethereum? What do you think about that?
01:01:00.148 - 01:01:16.014, Speaker B: Well, I know for a fact that Opensea shall be integrating Solana in the future. And so maybe there's like the niche NFT marketplaces, like the indie NFT marketplaces that are specific to the chain, that the chain loyalists like. And then there's going to be Opensea.
01:01:16.062 - 01:02:21.322, Speaker A: So you're predicting some kind of a convergence there, then it's like basically the category winners on Ethereum, the EVM ecosystems will go tackle all of these other chains one by one, and go to war with these local winners in every single chain. Yeah, interesting to see probably some consolidation there too. As that all plays out, a new layer one has just been funded as well. A 200 million dollar strategic investment led by a 16 Z, Katie Hahn, multicoin, of course, three Arrows Capital, FTX Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, all in a new layer one called Aptos. This Layer one is actually spun out of some of the initiatives. The early days of the Libra and Diem project from Facebook, now called Meta, they were talking about releasing an entirely separate chain and they actually developed a whole bunch, like, put together a whole bunch of work. There's a whole project, open source projects about this, a whole tech stack, that project is now kind of end of life.
01:02:21.322 - 01:02:42.606, Speaker A: But this team, this Aptos team, is sort of picking that up where Facebook left off and they're trying to bring another layer one to market. How many times do you think this play can work, David? Another layer? Like, are we just going to have new layer ones pop up every couple of years or so? What's happening here?
01:02:42.708 - 01:03:17.258, Speaker B: This once again reminds me of when people were still issuing icos like three quarters into 2018 after it was so obvious that the ico mania was over. So, Ryan, this is three points towards the bear market thesis. It's too late in the cycle to be raising money for a new l one, especially one that came out of Libra DM, which never even got off the ground in the first place. And so I think they're just raising money off that branding. But that is just my anti new l one take, I guess.
01:03:17.424 - 01:04:08.060, Speaker A: I read Kyle Simonei's post on multicoin about this. Well, look, man, it reminded me a lot of the pieces he's written about Salana and the virtues of Salana, which is interesting to me. And the one thing I will say is, I don't think any of these vcs or investors have a lot of chain loyalty. You know what I mean? I think that they are buying block space, buying l one narratives, buying things that will pump. But all I would say is like, retail beware. And of course, retail can't get in on this coin right now, but in the future, I don't know, some of these supply coin lockups and stuff, I don't know how sustainable this is. And we can't just have layer one after layer one after layer one unless we get some real traction now.
01:04:08.060 - 01:04:28.674, Speaker A: I don't know. So, seems to be just something we see. A new layer one launches, a bunch of vcs pile in. It's going to be the future. Although I will say in 2021, some of those chains did take off in big ways. So who knows, maybe chain loyalty and.
01:04:28.712 - 01:04:30.580, Speaker B: Vcs, can those go together?
01:04:31.430 - 01:04:41.554, Speaker A: I don't think so. I think that they're not aligned, it's not compatible. Let's talk about this. Hex trust. They just raised $88 million. What is Hextrust?
01:04:41.682 - 01:05:08.110, Speaker B: Hex trust? $88 million for a gaming ecosystem. $88 million for a brand new ecosystem. Not a small number found. Was co led by Anomaca brands and Liberty City Ventures. Never heard of them before. Series B will use to scale to Europe and Middle east to obtain additional licenses in gaming. Hex Trust currently has over 100 employees across offices in Hong Kong, Singapore and Vietnam.
01:05:08.110 - 01:05:12.400, Speaker B: And yeah, haven't heard of any of this.
01:05:12.930 - 01:05:14.094, Speaker A: Yeah, neither have I.
01:05:14.132 - 01:05:14.960, Speaker B: Moving on.
01:05:15.650 - 01:05:27.714, Speaker A: Jobs. Time, jobs. It's our time to ask you whether you've gotten a job in crypto yet. And to remind you if you haven't, there's a fantastic jobs board. I'm going to read out some jobs for you. The first is, wow, a bankless web developer.
01:05:27.762 - 01:05:28.082, Speaker B: Whoa.
01:05:28.146 - 01:05:30.422, Speaker A: We are looking for a web developer as well.
01:05:30.476 - 01:05:33.030, Speaker B: How crazy. We have some work, Ryan.
01:05:33.610 - 01:06:01.566, Speaker A: We have a website. I actually put it together and it's terrible. Aside from the newsletter, we have like a really ugly, terrible website and we need a new one. And we need a web developer to help. We also need an editor of the Bankless newsletter, a senior product manager of Bankless Academy, a senior product manager for super rare. We've got a quantitative analyst of risk at Makerdao, a risk analyst at Makerdao as well. Full stack engineer at Kazilla, a product manager at Kazilla as well.
01:06:01.566 - 01:06:34.086, Speaker A: A whole bunch more at the bankless Jobs website. Look, if you're not into any of those specific jobs, the other thing you can do is go check out the bankless talent collective and submit your resume. So you just fill out a talent profile and you get connected with companies. If you're a company looking for talent, there's already 200 plus resumes web three resumes on the bankless talent collective. You can tap into that as well if you are looking for talent and subscribe. This is a pretty cool new initiative that we've just spun up recently.
01:06:34.198 - 01:06:42.000, Speaker B: Yeah, bankless got both sides of the job market. We've got the supply and the demand. Coming up next out of the bankless ecosystem, the bankless dating app.
01:06:42.770 - 01:06:57.326, Speaker A: No, never. I don't know how much demand there will be. There might be a lot of supply, though. Let's talk news. David, merge, merge week. It's the moment you've been waiting for. Don't sleep on the merge.
01:06:57.326 - 01:07:31.622, Speaker A: This is a post you wrote. So people are predicting the merge in three months. We didn't necessarily fully double down on a June date, but we're pretty excited. We're pretty bullish that June could be the month that the merge comes. Part of this was a set of reasons given by Superfizz, who's very plugged into the ETH staking community and that world. What are the reasons why a merge could happen? The Ethereum merge could happen in June. And maybe David, should we back up and just explain what the merge is for people who haven't been listening to recent bankless episodes.
01:07:31.686 - 01:07:48.946, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Okay. Ethereum currently proof of work, has also 100% always committed to eventually transition to proof of stake. We have the proof of stake chain. That's what the beacon chain is. That's been running since early 2021. And that thing has been chugging along making sure that's totally fine.
01:07:48.946 - 01:08:20.426, Speaker B: And one day we will swap out the proof of work and plug in the beacon chain, which is the proof of stake chain, to the current execution environment of Ethereum. And proof of work will go away and proof of stake will replace it. That's the merge. We're merging the chains and stripping out proof of work. And so when this actually happens is completely unknown because it's only going to happen when it's ready. It's ready when it's ready. But we get to also observe, because this is an open environment, we get to observe the Ethereum developers and kind of hypothesize about when it might be ready.
01:08:20.426 - 01:08:47.342, Speaker B: So that's what Superfiz did. He's pulled in five different tidbits of information that indicate a strong likelihood of a June merge date. The first one being there's a planned difficulty bomb coming in mid June. Difficulty bomb is something that's always been in Ethereum. Basically we plan in the destruction of the chain because it forces us to make progress. Every now and then we have to kick it back. Actually, that's been basically Ethereum culture since the beginning of time is we just kick it back by having a hard fork.
01:08:47.342 - 01:09:35.826, Speaker B: It gives us an opportunity to add in new eips and stuff like that and kick back the difficulty bomb. There's a difficulty bomb coming in June, which means we will be hard forking sometime by mid June regardless of the merge or not, because we need to kick back the difficulty bomb. Danny Ryan, who's coordinating the transition from proof of stake work Ethereum to proof of stake Ethereum has signaled that a delay in the bomb is not needed, which means that perhaps the merge can happen before the bomb happens, which happens in the mid June. There's also the merge readiness checklist is getting more and more checkboxes in it. And also there was a conversation in the all core devs call about potentially kicking back some development in the merge by ten days. And a lot of devs got really picky about that. They didn't like the delay at all.
01:09:35.826 - 01:10:01.774, Speaker B: And so devs are getting picky about the date. And last but definitely not least, the kiln testnet is actually testing the merge. So we are having test environments for. We are practicing the merge. The merge is being practiced actively. And so barring any significant unforeseen issues, with all of these little tidbits of data, June looks like the most likely candidate for the merge, which I'm really excited about.
01:10:01.892 - 01:10:17.202, Speaker A: Well, that's super cool. Yeah, I mean, stop doing that. What would the merge mean? David, so what does it mean? You talked about the disappearance of proof of work, but what does it mean for issuance as well? I think that's part of the story here.
01:10:17.256 - 01:10:38.614, Speaker B: Yeah. So people who are staking their eth on the beacon chain, they're earning a very respectable 4.8% in ETH denominated yield. Not even stablecoin yield, but ETH yield. And then once this roughly 10.5 million ETH out of the roughly 118,000,000 total supply of ETH. Once that staked ETH merges with a proof of work chain, that yield goes from where it is now at 4.8%
01:10:38.614 - 01:11:06.722, Speaker B: to somewhere between ten to 15%, depending on gas fees. So that is a two to three x in yield on ether. And so that's a two to three x stronger incentive to stake more ETH. And so there's going to be a demand to take your ETH perhaps out of the secondary market and to stake it to get that ten to 15% ETH denominated yield. And at the same time, the new issuance of Ether. This is one of the best features about proof of stake. The new issuance of ether is dropping by 90%.
01:11:06.722 - 01:12:11.014, Speaker B: So currently 12,000 ether is minted per day to spend towards proof of work, mining proof of work very, very capital intensive. It takes a lot of money to fund security and proof of work. But postmerge, that goes from 12,000 down to 1280. So a 90% reduction in the ether issuance, but not only a 90% reduction, Ryan, but also a hundred percent reduction in operational costs. Because ETH staking and proof of stake costs nothing after you have an Internet connection and a consumer hardware, laptop computer, a normal computer. So basically we're going from twelve ether in daily issuance to 1280, and thousands and thousands of ether in daily sell pressure to cover the operational cost of proof of work down to zero. So the big questions that I asked the bankless nation, how much more ether will be staked as a result of the increase in yield, the two to three x in yield, where will that ether come from? Since a lot of the regular selling pressure is going to be eliminated? And what is the price going to do as a result.
01:12:11.014 - 01:12:16.578, Speaker B: And all of these answers are likely coming in June because we all get to experience it for ourselves.
01:12:16.754 - 01:12:22.714, Speaker A: Yeah, this is definitely the biggest event, the biggest crypto event of 2022, maybe.
01:12:22.752 - 01:12:24.954, Speaker B: The biggest ever, right?
01:12:25.072 - 01:12:29.098, Speaker A: I would say ever. It's a triple happening.
01:12:29.184 - 01:12:34.686, Speaker B: Other than the Genesis block of Ethereum itself, this is the most significant event since that.
01:12:34.868 - 01:12:42.254, Speaker A: Right. And so now we've got bullish David back, I think for the moment, to the bullish side.
01:12:42.292 - 01:12:44.930, Speaker B: We got three for the bear, we got one for the bull.
01:12:45.430 - 01:13:05.926, Speaker A: Well, I mean, this is incredibly bullish, but there was something that happened in the testnet as well. There was a block proposal failure, some bug in the kiln testnet. So that could set things back possibly. That's a question to you. What happened with this bug and what does that mean for the merge date?
01:13:06.028 - 01:13:59.890, Speaker B: Yeah, at the start of the article I said, barring any significant unforeseen issue, it's increasingly likely that we see the merge in June, and then three days later there was a bug in a testnet. What happened was that the prism client, the way that the merge works is that people have to run both an ethereum proof of work chain client and an Ethereum beacon chain client. So prism is the proof of stake. Beacon chain client and then Prism plus Geth and Prism plus nethermind, these combinations stopped producing blocks which accounted for 15% to 20% of the total block supply. Because Ethereum has a multiclient architecture, this actually did not impact the testnet, but if it had been more than 33%, it would have. So 15% to 20%, kind of dangerously close. Also, prism in its current implementation on the beacon chain has more than 66% of total supply of the new blocks.
01:13:59.890 - 01:14:32.706, Speaker B: The client that's responsible for more than 66% of the blocks. So that is a concern. We need to get prism dominance in the beacon chain down for that to be safe. The bug was relatively trivially identified and fixed, but it perhaps was indicative of more time and research needed to understand that this thing is going to be stable. The significance is going to be unpacked and talked about during the ethereum, all core devs call, which is happening tomorrow, which is today for the listener Friday. And so if you want to tune into whether or not this actually does impact the merge, you can turn into.
01:14:32.728 - 01:14:47.058, Speaker A: The all core devs call another, I guess, reason why we need multiple clients, because this sort of saved the testnet in this case, but it's also a reason why we need client diversity on Mainnet as well. And staking diversity across multiple clients.
01:14:47.154 - 01:14:52.070, Speaker B: Hey, Ryan, can you name me a different blockchain other than Ethereum that has multiple clients?
01:14:52.230 - 01:14:55.690, Speaker A: Well, David, I think there's probably none besides Ethereum.
01:14:56.190 - 01:15:03.234, Speaker B: That's exactly right. Ethereum is the only one with a multi client architecture, which is ridiculous. We're supposed to be decentralized.
01:15:03.382 - 01:15:46.998, Speaker A: We've got some more trivia here, too. And this is maybe a question for you, even though you probably already know the answer to this. How much newly minted ETH will validators be able to sell after the merge but before the withdrawals? Hard fork. So just to set up that question, newly minted ETH, not existing stake, because I'm fairly certain people know that once they stake their eth, they can't withdraw it right now until there's a hard fork that adds some withdrawal functionality. But we're talking about newly issued ETH, so that's after you stake your Eth, you get some return denominated ETh. That newly issued ETH. When will you actually be able to sell that newly issued.
01:15:46.998 - 01:15:48.102, Speaker A: David?
01:15:48.246 - 01:15:49.690, Speaker B: No, they answer that.
01:15:49.760 - 01:16:11.438, Speaker A: Wait, no, actually not when will you be able to sell it? But how much? Excuse me? Newly minted EtH will validators be able to sell post the merge? So let's say the merge happens in June. After that date in June and July and August, they're receiving new issuance of ETH. How much will they be able to sell of that eth? David?
01:16:11.614 - 01:16:29.922, Speaker B: The answer is zero, Ryan. Yes, you are correct. Okay. Ding ding. So just to unpack that a little bit right now, you can go stake your ether on the beacon chain. You send your ether to the beacon chain, contract new that ether on the current chain is burned. Ether on the beacon chain is minted.
01:16:29.922 - 01:17:02.350, Speaker B: You stake that ether, you start earning that ether yield on the beacon chain, then the merge happens, and then that beacon chain is then securing the ethereum chain. Proof of work is stripped out, but withdrawals are not yet enabled yet. There's another hard fork that needs to happen to enable withdrawals, and that's hypothesized to be roughly six months after. So after the merge, the ETH issuance into the validators won't be withdrawable for six months, which means zero new ether will be introduced into the market for like six months after the merge.
01:17:02.430 - 01:17:11.334, Speaker A: Zero. What we're saying is, to be clear, ETH issuance doesn't just drop by 90%. It drops to 100% temporarily for some period of time.
01:17:11.372 - 01:17:12.598, Speaker B: For some period of time.
01:17:12.764 - 01:17:31.102, Speaker A: And that additional 10% issuance is almost like it's almost like vested. It's locked up. It cannot be sold, cannot be spent. So we're actually going from like 4.25%, 4.5% issuance to 0% issuance for at least six months.
01:17:31.156 - 01:17:33.002, Speaker B: Plus the burn.
01:17:33.146 - 01:17:34.510, Speaker A: Plus the burn.
01:17:35.250 - 01:17:36.000, Speaker B: Okay.
01:17:37.330 - 01:17:39.626, Speaker A: More people talking about this devil's advocate.
01:17:39.658 - 01:18:30.206, Speaker B: Though, because we're just locking up the rewards for six months while we just make sure that everything's okay. Eventually it'll get unlocked. And then you might say like, well then there's just pent up demand to sell because they've just been earning all this ETH for six months and they're just going to sell it all at once. But the thing is, ETH staking goes up to ten to 15%. And so all of the people that have their ether on the main Ethereum chain that never decided to bridge over to the beacon chain because they never wanted to spin up an ETH one validator, that ten to 15% is going to cause a huge influx of more stake for people to get that yield. And so not only is zero net new ether going to come into existence, the gravitational pull of ten to 15% ETH denominated yield is going to pull in so much more etH. So even when the withdrawals hard fork is enabled, the incentive to still be staking is going to be so strong.
01:18:30.206 - 01:18:36.622, Speaker B: I could totally see that, that just becoming a non event in terms of the ETH price and dumping on the secondary supply.
01:18:36.766 - 01:18:46.420, Speaker A: Look, supply crunch is what this means. A massive supply crunch is happening this year, and I'm really shocked that more people aren't talking about it.
01:18:48.570 - 01:18:49.462, Speaker B: You heard it here.
01:18:49.516 - 01:19:43.906, Speaker A: Now that's going to happen potentially in the midst of this crab sideways crypto bear market, World War three, right? Who knows? So it's going to happen in that context. It's not necessarily going to happen during hype season of early spring 2021. So we will see how that plays out. Rocket pool continuing to add more features and functionality here they have a new staking interface with a bunch of improvements, including a wallet panel transaction estimates, more intuitive exchange rates on the re and a lot more. So go check that out. There's all sorts of great staking services as well if you don't want to run your own validator. Rocket pool being probably one of the most decentralized, lido being another one that's a little less decentralized, but is still doing better than staking in an exchange.
01:19:43.906 - 01:19:52.918, Speaker A: And you gave this tweet. You put out this tweet, David, the drum roll for the merge has begun. Is that what you heard this week? Was it the drum roll?
01:19:53.014 - 01:20:20.498, Speaker B: Yeah, especially in the second half of the weeks. It's just like people are just. The merge is getting a bunch of engagement on Twitter that seems to be, in my mind, like the thing that has captured the attention of people as the attention from the nfts and gaming and all that stuff is gone. People have refocused on the fundamentals of this industry, which is the merge. So the drumroll is we're three plus months out, but the merge is here. The drum roll is happening.
01:20:20.664 - 01:20:28.834, Speaker A: And when you say people, we're talking primarily about crypto. People, like crypto, Twitter people, none of this is broken outside into mainstream yet.
01:20:28.872 - 01:20:32.600, Speaker B: I mean, honestly, most of the crypto industry doesn't even understand this.
01:20:33.850 - 01:20:36.262, Speaker A: I totally agree with that. At least they're talking about it now.
01:20:36.316 - 01:21:06.218, Speaker B: The drum roll for the merge is definitely started, at least with the inner circle of Ethereum, people who really, really pay attention to this stuff, and then also the people that pay attention to that. But we got three months to go. There's going to be a lot of conversations, there's going to be a lot of content banklessly going to report on all of it. And I think it's going to be a very, very fun time, Ryan, because I think it's east season. I think e season has started once again and it's my favorite season. And we're gonna talk about it every step of the way until the merge.
01:21:06.394 - 01:21:20.402, Speaker A: Yeah. What we didn't tell you is not only merge week, but this week lasts many months. Right. The next few months we're going to be talking about the merge. It's just a huge inevitability. An inevitability. And most people in crypto do not appreciate this.
01:21:20.402 - 01:21:54.250, Speaker A: I think this is massive alpha for you. Whether it's a bear market or a bull market, in crypto, this is a massive event to watch. Let's talk about l two s for a minute and the path to roll up decentralization. So something that not everyone knows is that every major layer two project right now anyway, in its current state, has a trusted party which can execute protocol upgrades. Right. That is intentional. There is a backdoor to upgrade these layer twos in the event of a bug.
01:21:54.250 - 01:23:03.958, Speaker A: And some layer twos have already used this to patch things before there was a catastrophic issue. And so this is sort of a feature at this stage, not a bug. But if it persists into the future forever, then it becomes a bug because as long as there is a trusted third party that can execute protocol updates. The layer two is not completely decentralized. So the optimism team wrote a fantastic post about how roll ups move forward, how they decentralize over time, how they get rid of these access keys. They use the analogy of like, throwing the ring into mountain doom, throwing the keys into mountain doom so that it would be burnt up and no one could access it before any longer and the chain would be fully decentralized. What would you say is the path not just for optimism here, but like optimism summary on what roll ups need to do in order to get rid of this security hole in the future? After they harden their chain, what's the path to making the roll ups fully decentralized with no upgrade access for the core team?
01:23:04.044 - 01:24:25.778, Speaker B: Yeah, no trust, no centralization, right? Earlier I talked about how optimism strategy has always been EVM equivalents, not just EVM compatibility, but EVM equivalents. And there's also been like the narrative, just like EVM is kind of at the center of the universe, avalanche, all these EVM compatible chains, they're not Ethereum, but they are the EVM. And so EVM equivalence is really, really important. And so basically, optimism, I think, is going to take a leaf out of Ethereum's book, of which it is a fractal off of, and kind of follow the Ethereum roadmap for decentralization. And that involves, rather than having one canonical client for optimism, having many, many clients for optimism, and then after enough, sufficient multi client architecture gets built out, then it's just a matter of handing over, like, first off, calcifying in the same way that Ethereum is slowly, slowly having longer and longer hard forks and longer and longer updates. It's the same kind of thing needs to happen with optimism l two s, where just like, things need to change less and less and less over time and give more and more power back to the community, I think it's going to be interesting to see if optimism or optimistic l two s retain some sort of upgradable path via the token via onchain governance in ways that Ethereum does not. But each the nice thing is that you could spin up an optimism layer two and have one with onchain governance and one without.
01:24:25.778 - 01:24:37.662, Speaker B: But the idea is that Ethereum itself has kind of laid out the roadmap to how you decentralize, and layer twos probably are going to just have to take a leaf out of Ethereum's book and follow in that path.
01:24:37.806 - 01:25:07.854, Speaker A: Yeah, there's no shortcuts to this, I think, is the main message. But there it is, a pattern, right? It's like you have to ossify the underlying protocol, you have to have multiple clients make it decentralized. You have to create sort of a specification that other teams can build towards. So that's not just one unified team. And once these things are in place, then you can toss those private keys into mount doom, into the lava and burn them forever. But doing it before then is not a good idea. Right.
01:25:07.854 - 01:25:31.038, Speaker A: We need that flexibility, we need that upgrade path so that we can solve these processes. All of these layer twos are basically in a beta version. Until that time, let's talk a bit more about optimism. So they are releasing canon. Canon, which is next gen fraud proof architecture. That's coming soon. What does that mean? Next gen fraud proof architecture?
01:25:31.134 - 01:26:10.046, Speaker B: Yeah. The fault proof architecture is one of the optimism's big missing components, which is no longer missing because they released canon. And this particular fault proof implementation, the way that it's designed, is a reflection of the optimism's design philosophy. And I talk about this design philosophy, kind of summarized in a tweet where I say optimism's design philosophy has always been reduce, reduce, reduce. And what I really mean by that is reduce complexity, reduce the number of codes, and that optimizes optionality. When you reduce complexity, you can actually push complexity elsewhere. And so kind of like Ethereum itself, optimism is very modular.
01:26:10.046 - 01:26:46.970, Speaker B: As in this canon, faultproof is a modular component of the greater optimism layer two. And so this simplicity optimizes for modularity and efficiency, which ultimately creates security. And one of the hotlines in this article is oh. It also enables the theoretical minimum of call data gas costs, which music to my ears when it comes to speed and gas efficiency on layer two. And so if you are technically minded and want to hear more about optimism's fault proof canon architecture, you can go click the link in the show notes for more details.
01:26:47.130 - 01:27:20.570, Speaker A: Reduce, reduce, reduce. This is also a leaf out of Ethereum's book where there's so many efforts to reduce the beacon chain specification to the minimum amount of code necessary. It's definitely important on this journey as well. So is getting exchanges to on ramp and off ramp to your layer two. And Huobay Global, they just added optimism withdraw functionality and features. So this is a path that all rollups are going to take. And it's cool to see optimism, like leading the way down that path too.
01:27:20.570 - 01:28:01.118, Speaker A: All right, David, let's talk about the biggest acquisition in NFT history. The apes bought the punks. David, I don't know how you feel about that? I'm looking at a punk in your background right now. But yuga Labs purchased all of the intellectual property, I believe, from the crypto punks holders, larva Labs, yuga and larva. They purchased all the intellectual property from larvae labs. Tell us what this means. So what is this purchase? What's the significance of it? And what does it mean for the NFT ecosystem and for the punks and the board apes community? Yeah.
01:28:01.144 - 01:28:52.770, Speaker B: Carly Riley over at overpriced jpegs tweeted out a few months ago, I wonder when NFT companies or NFT studios are going to start buying the IP from other NFT companies or other NFT studios. And I'm pretty sure when she tweeted that she meant, know some of the b list nfts, not necessarily the board ape yacht club founders buying cryptopunks, the OG NFT. So the magnitude of this is absolutely crazy. And not just cryptopunks, but also mebits, which also came out of larva labs. And so for every NFT project there is ip associated with it, there's licenses and the cryptopunks, again, the one that I have in the back of my living room here, the IP for cryptopunk was actually not owned by the owners of the cryptopunks. It was still owned by larvae Labs. So like, commercial licenses was not something that you could do with cryptopunks.
01:28:52.770 - 01:29:35.662, Speaker B: That was actually one of the reasons that's always been the case behind board apes is that the board ape holders had the rights to use their own board ape commercially if they so choose. This is Creative Commons open, or CCO, I believe is what that's called. But double check me on that. And so now Yuga Labs, which are the founders behind board apes and mutant apes and that whole ecosystem struck a deal with larva labs to acquire the IP. And when they did, they gave the punk holders the rights to their own commercial licenses for their punk. So I can start going out and making merch and branding out of my crypto punk if I so choose. Like, I already have a brand around me and my crypto punk because I put my cryptopunk as my profile picture on Twitter.
01:29:35.662 - 01:29:43.974, Speaker B: But now I could go and start making like, I don't know, a movie where my cryptopunk is featured if I so choose. And I would have my own commercial rights to that.
01:29:44.092 - 01:29:47.654, Speaker A: Why didn't larva Labs do that? Larva Labs, how they've been holding it.
01:29:47.692 - 01:30:06.266, Speaker B: That'S a good don't. Larva Labs has always been builders and not necessarily marketers. They like on chain experiments. They like fooling around on the blockchain, doing cool, innovative new things. Like I said, they weren't just the founders of cryptopunks. They also did mevits. They also did autoglyphs.
01:30:06.266 - 01:30:53.282, Speaker B: They are tinkerers and innovators at the chain level, where yuga labs are brand experts and just experts in growing the value of an ecosystem. And that's just something that larvae Labs was never really interested in. So some punk holders are a little bit concerned because the climate and culture in board apes is nothing like the culture around crypto punks. Crypto punks kind of think that board apes are kind of cringe, and I'm definitely one of those people. People are worried that yuga Labs is going to give cryptopunks the same treatment that they gave the board apes, like yachts and things of that nature that are kind of against the crypto punk ethos. It's really actually hard to tie down cryptopunks. They're very, very decentralized.
01:30:53.366 - 01:30:54.170, Speaker A: Different cultures.
01:30:54.250 - 01:31:10.340, Speaker B: Different cultures, yeah. And so some of the punk holders are concerned about that, as in, we don't need this company to promote the brand of the cryptopunks. The Cryptopunks brand has always been about promoting itself. Like, we don't need help. We're crypto punks and we don't even want help.
01:31:11.830 - 01:31:43.530, Speaker A: But can I ask you this? This part doesn't make sense to me. Look, I'm kind of an outsider, not part of either of these communities. I'm just looking at it. But it feels a little bit like larva Labs is just doing this as a cash grab. Why couldn't they have just given crypto punk owners creative common license and be done with it? Why do they have to sell to yuka Labs all of this IP and all of these punks? I'm wondering if some members of the crypto punk community feel a little bit. I don't know if betrayed is the right word, but maybe rug pulled.
01:31:45.230 - 01:32:15.800, Speaker B: Well, so it wasn't the acquisition of the IP that I think was. That's only one part of the story. I think actually, the bigger part of the acquisition is actually buying the treasury assets of larvae labs, which was 423 crypto punks. And with a 60 eth floor, that's a lot of value and over 1700 me bits. And so it was a package deal. Right? Like, we'll buy your crypto punks, we'll buy your me bits and give us the ip, and we'll make a deal. I don't know how much.
01:32:15.800 - 01:32:42.122, Speaker B: I think the larvae labs just wants to kind of sunset their responsibility over the crypto punks because they weren't really using that to do anything to begin with. And so I don't know. I don't think rug pulled is the right descriptor. I think it was just like a passing of the baton, a passing of the torch onto a new steward of the brand. And that's kind of where the cryptopunk side of the community kind of is fearful. They don't want a steward of the brand. The brand is its own steward.
01:32:42.122 - 01:33:06.674, Speaker B: It does itself. It's a headless brand. And so putting a head on the brand is kind of anti cryptopunk culture. I'm optimistic. In the mirror post from Yuga Labs, they definitely addressed how they have no intention of just giving the crypto punks the board apes treatment and that they will listen to the community before they take any action. So I'm optimistic about the outcome of this. I kind of think that the crypto punks get the best of both worlds.
01:33:06.674 - 01:33:25.454, Speaker B: They both get to have their headless brand. That many, many cryptopunks will just give the middle finger to Yuga Labs. And Yuga Labs will still have the incentive to promote the crypto punk brand so long as they don't do it in any cringe way like how they kind of did with board apes. In my opinion, then I think we're good here. I think we're good here.
01:33:25.572 - 01:33:30.622, Speaker A: Respect the culture. But as a punk holder, you're cautiously optimistic about it.
01:33:30.676 - 01:33:32.846, Speaker B: Cautiously optimistic. I think that's a great way to put it.
01:33:32.868 - 01:33:41.422, Speaker A: Yeah. There's some takeaways from William Pister. He goes over now. Yuga Labs now has five of the top 20 NFT projects.
01:33:41.486 - 01:33:41.762, Speaker B: Crazy.
01:33:41.816 - 01:34:32.094, Speaker A: They are an absolutely massive player and brand holder in the NFT space. Larva Labs is going to continue on with web three projects. He said they're kind of a builder hacker house and looks like they're going to spin up more web three projects in the future. It does beg the question of whether Yuga, what they do next, will they launch an NFT marketplace, for instance? Right. Then they have the brands. Do they go start being vertically integrated and become sort of an opensea type of offering, get into the exchange business? There's also some chatter about acquisitions, right? So if Yuga Labs board apes can basically buy crypto punks, then that also means somebody can buy board apes, right? Buy all of that ip. So who's next? Did the corporate behemoths enter the fray, just like Disney.
01:34:32.094 - 01:34:37.590, Speaker A: Go and buy an NFT project. Maybe they are the future owners of labs.
01:34:38.650 - 01:34:43.382, Speaker B: I don't think the board apes is the right culture for so.
01:34:43.436 - 01:35:05.626, Speaker A: But maybe it's someone else, right? It's like the idea of these things being acquired and purchased has sort of entered the conversation as well. When token. That's what we'll get to in a second. It feels like there's a we got the answer conversation play to earn games, some other things as well. But let's talk about the token really quick. So there's an ape token. Get me up to speed on that, David.
01:35:05.626 - 01:35:10.238, Speaker A: I haven't honestly been paying attention too much to the apecoin. What's going on there.
01:35:10.324 - 01:35:51.178, Speaker B: Yeah, so Yuga Labs minted and airdropped apecoin, I believe, as of this morning. And Apecoin is, according to them, a token for culture, gaming and commerce, used to empower a decentralized community building at the forefront of web Three. Some people have the negative take on this is like a token for culture, gaming and commerce. Like these things that are supposed to be unlocked by having the token. Wasn't that what the apes themselves were supposed to be? But to each their own. This is putting a currency into an NFT world. So now we have the fungible money currency that's paired with the holders of the ape tokens that got all the money.
01:35:51.178 - 01:36:08.818, Speaker B: So what they're going to be doing with the ERC 20 token, I don't know. But you would imagine some sort of just like, economy is growing. This is now like the nation of the apes, the planet of the apes, if you will. They have their own identity and their own currency, and now they have to build out their world.
01:36:08.984 - 01:36:14.418, Speaker A: And this is just for ape holders. This isn't across all yuga labs properties, just for the apes themselves.
01:36:14.504 - 01:36:51.470, Speaker B: Board apes, mutant apes, and kennel, doggy dog club. I don't know the name of that one. The dogs that go with the apes. So those three projects got the ape coin airdrop in different proportions. Got it. Even more critiques came from the supply of the ape token that was given to Yuga Lab founders because some amount was reserved for Yugalab founders, which is typical, but then some amount was also reserved for board Ape founders, which they're the same thing. So like a little bit of a double dip right there, but we'll see.
01:36:51.470 - 01:36:53.662, Speaker B: Still in early days, there's some takes.
01:36:53.716 - 01:37:21.770, Speaker A: Here's one from Alexis Ohanian, who's coming on the podcast on Monday. By the way. What's his take? Despite how bored my ape looks, I'm excited to share that Apecoin Dao is adopting Apecoin and that I'm serving on special counsel that will oversee the decisions of the community. So Alexis looks like is getting in the fray as a governor of some sorts. The exchanges are listing apecoin as well. They've been very quick to list FTX. I got an email from Gemini saying we are now listing.
01:37:23.710 - 01:37:25.100, Speaker B: Good bd from.
01:37:25.870 - 01:37:31.062, Speaker A: Yeah, they can execute. These brands can execute. And what is this tweet that we're looking at here, David?
01:37:31.206 - 01:38:19.190, Speaker B: Yeah, so this was interesting. This has less to do with the actual airdrop out of yuga Labs and more with NFTX. And NFTX is like an index for various NFT projects. And so NFTX has a bunch of board apes in their vaults, and all of the board apes that NFTX has is they're able to claim the tokens, they're able to claim the airdropped, but no one actually owns them because it's owned by a pool. So what someone did is they took a flash loan to buy the entire vault of all board apes. And then since they owned every single board ape, they claimed every single board apes from NFTX Airdrop and then resupplied and sold back to all of the apes and then paid back their flash loan and was able to claim basically a million dollars of the ape token.
01:38:19.350 - 01:38:21.450, Speaker A: I don't even know if I'm mad about that one.
01:38:21.520 - 01:38:21.802, Speaker B: No.
01:38:21.856 - 01:38:22.874, Speaker A: Am I mad about that one?
01:38:22.912 - 01:38:23.494, Speaker B: This is clever.
01:38:23.542 - 01:38:23.754, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:38:23.792 - 01:38:26.958, Speaker B: Like, if NSCX didn't think about that, then that's on them.
01:38:27.124 - 01:38:39.522, Speaker A: Yeah, that's pretty clever in some of the downstream effects of these things. So summarize this for us overall, what do you think about the acquisition of punks by the apes and Yuga Labs moving forward?
01:38:39.656 - 01:39:13.200, Speaker B: Acquisition of punks by apes? I am neutral to slightly positive on that. There's a decent chance that it just becomes a nothing burger and crypto punks or crypto punks forever and nothing can really change that. So that's my opinion on that with regards to the airdrop, of the issuance of new tokens to generate excitement and to make money goes back to my thesis of how we are in a 2018 part of the crypto cycle where people are just issuing tokens because it's the last gasp of opportunity to pocket some money before we go into the bear market.
01:39:13.650 - 01:39:39.718, Speaker A: There you go. That's the take. That's what happened this week, guys. Let's move on to something else that was in the headlines in the NFT world, which is Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, formerly Facebook, just confirmed rumors that Instagram will get into the NFT game in a matter of months, I believe. So nothing specific to announce other than Instagram is coming to nfts. That's a big deal. It's like we all suspected it.
01:39:39.718 - 01:40:19.614, Speaker A: But I do see this as some Zuckerberg capitulation. Now, I don't know what NFT platform he's going to deploy it on, but how could he not do something on Ethereum? He can't at this point in time, spin up his own Facebook chain and start issuing nfts there, right? So it's got to be with some of the existing platforms. And if that's the case, David, we're winning, man. We got the biggest social media conglomerate in the world now using NFTs as digital property on its social media platform. I think that's fantastic. We'll see what Instagram does with it. But look, we've seen moves with TikTok.
01:40:19.614 - 01:40:28.454, Speaker A: We've seen Twitter get an NFT space. We knew Instagram was coming, and it looks like they're coming in the next few months. Zuckerberg has just confirmed it.
01:40:28.572 - 01:40:38.950, Speaker B: If only DM had worked out, they'd be able to do this natively versus their own bend the knees Zuckerberg.
01:40:40.890 - 01:40:58.238, Speaker A: Regulation talk. Let's talk about a few things. We'll be real quick, though. Okay, so we've said for a while Congress has got to do something to rein in the SEC and Gary Gensler. In fact, we talked to Representative Tom Emmer on the Bankless podcast about that. We're like, come get your boy.
01:40:58.404 - 01:41:02.042, Speaker B: Gensler is all over the place, unhinged.
01:41:02.106 - 01:42:02.018, Speaker A: Gone a little bit rogue in crypto. And it's unclear how much actual authority, enforcement authority he actually has in the SEC versus what he's actually doing. And this is a letter from Representative Tom Emmer and to Gary Gensler and a whole bunch of other representatives. It says, this my office, that's Tom Emmer speaking, has received numerous tips from crypto and blockchain firms that SEC chair Gary Gensler's informational reporting requests in quotations to the crypto community are overburdensome and don't feel particularly voluntary, and they are stifling innovation. So Representative Tom Emmer and company querying the SEC, asking what authority they actually have over the crypto industry and maybe attempting to rein the SEC in somewhat. Good job. That's what Congress should be doing what our legislative branch should be doing.
01:42:02.018 - 01:42:28.746, Speaker A: The executive branch. The executive branch enforces laws, they don't make laws. And when they get into the mode of making laws and crossing boundaries and being authoritarian. Yeah. Exercising authority where they don't have it, that's when Congress needs to pull them in. Generally, Congress hasn't done very much, but now here's representative Tom Emmer starting to do something. Great to see.
01:42:28.848 - 01:42:43.840, Speaker B: This is just like, I think a great summary for this is that this is like when the teacher sends a note home with the kid to the parent. Like, you had to get Tom Emmer to write a note about Gensler and the SEC to calm the f down and back.
01:42:45.250 - 01:43:06.038, Speaker A: Really? That's really the message and kind of what we want. Let's not stifle innovation. Guys, some more good news on the regulatory front. The EU just voted down an anti proof of work clause. So this was the econ committee of the EU parliament. There was some legislative action to actually ban proof of work. Ban proof of work.
01:43:06.124 - 01:43:07.640, Speaker B: Didn't even know that was happening.
01:43:08.010 - 01:43:33.370, Speaker A: Right. So this was happening. I'm not sure how enforceable it is. I don't know all the details of how this worked, but that was kind of on the periphery. Well, it just got voted down, 32 against, 24 in favor. So this is Patrick Hansen on Twitter saying a big relief and political success for the bitcoin and crypto community in the EU. Proof of work is not being allowed.
01:43:33.370 - 01:43:37.330, Speaker A: Is allowed as it was before, not disallowed.
01:43:38.310 - 01:43:46.850, Speaker B: I mean, it does indicate the headwinds that proof of work as an industry has. I don't think you're going to see proof of stake having to fight these battles.
01:43:47.290 - 01:44:05.180, Speaker A: Right. And you understand some of the concerns about energy consumption, but proof of work has been sort of maligned and I don't think given fair treatment either. This is a headline to you. Saudi Arabia considers accepting the yuan instead of dollars for chinese oil sales.
01:44:07.390 - 01:44:39.442, Speaker B: Coming on the heels of sanctioning entire central bank. All of a sudden a bunch of countries get scared about having the dollar, allowing the dollar to have so much power. So this is kind of the after effects of the pushback from our sanctioning of Russia. All of a sudden, the rest of the world sees like, oh, look what accidental powers we gave the United States government and Federal Reserve. They can freeze all of our money. So now they are looking to the digital wan or the wan in general, instead of dollars to process trade, which is bearish for the dollar.
01:44:39.586 - 01:45:00.698, Speaker A: Yeah, I do think this is the beginning of the end for the dollar supremacy as the world reserve currency on the back of these sanctions. Whether you agree with the sanctions or not, you've got to acknowledge that there are some trade offs here and some downstream effects. Let's talk about South Korea for a second as we're spinning around the world today in the regulatory news.
01:45:00.784 - 01:45:22.514, Speaker B: Yeah, let me take this one, Ryan. Two candidates were running for president of South Korea. Both candidates were pro crypto. Therefore, the pro crypto candidate won. And apparently both candidates were using crypto as a way to onboard votes from the younger generations. So crypto society growing in South Korea. You'll love to see it.
01:45:22.632 - 01:45:30.386, Speaker A: That's awesome. It's all good news on the regulatory front. A 16 z, they just appointed a treasury official as their head of regulatory.
01:45:30.578 - 01:45:31.720, Speaker B: Vincent person.
01:45:32.170 - 01:45:34.738, Speaker A: Yeah. What's this coming out of Ukraine?
01:45:34.834 - 01:46:03.374, Speaker B: Yeah, Ukraine signed a new crypto regulation law. This new law appoints that agencies will regulate the markets and establish rules around virtual asset ownership rights, among other things. According to a statement out of Ukraine officials, Ukraine and foreign based cryptocurrency exchanges will be allowed to operate and banks will be able to open accounts for crypto companies. So crypto giving the big thumbs up out of know, when crypto comes and saves the day for your country, you generally tend to be favorable to it.
01:46:03.572 - 01:46:24.070, Speaker A: Absolutely. The last thing is one bad thing. Yeah. The Dex aggregator Macha, they just geoblocked trades coming out of Russia. This is sanctions filtering down into crypto territory, this time on the Defi side of things. Defi aggregator Matcha. Now geoblocking trades from Russia.
01:46:24.070 - 01:46:38.154, Speaker A: One inch is also geoblocking everyone in the US, for example. So this isn't new, but the aggregator layer seems to be a choke point for sanctions and censorship. And I bet we'll see more of that in the future.
01:46:38.272 - 01:46:46.430, Speaker B: That's ironic. I actually forgot that one inch was geoblocking the United States because they're out of Russia and Masha is out of the US and they're blocking Russians.
01:46:47.410 - 01:47:04.238, Speaker A: Everyone's getting blocked. Oh, God. I think they're blocking the US due to SeC sorts concerns. That's right. And this is not sec. This is just kind of, of fact, sanctions type of thing. But it's all kind of the same rhythm.
01:47:04.238 - 01:47:10.118, Speaker A: Guys, we will be right back with the takes of the week. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:47:10.204 - 01:47:47.074, Speaker B: If you're going bankless, you need metamask. This is your tool to unlock the world of defi without giving up custody over your private keys. Metamask is both a secure in browser wallet and also a secure bridge for your hardware wallet. You can now trade tokens on any Dex or aggregator. Metamask swap gathers real time pricing information across all the DeFi exchanges, allowing you to select your best price while getting all the metamask benefits of self custody, lower gas costs, and increased transaction success rates. Metamask also has a fantastic mobile wallet that I use when I'm out and about which I use to collect poaps, nfts and do all my d five things while I'm away from home. If you haven't downloaded metamask, you got to try it out.
01:47:47.074 - 01:48:37.338, Speaker B: Web three wouldn't be the same without it. Download metamask for desktop and mobile at Metamask IO and load up your trezor, Ledger, lattice or keystone hardware wallets so that they too can get into the world of web three polygon is Ethereum's largest and most vibrant scaling solution to date. With millions of monthly users and all of the biggest DFI apps, the polygon ecosystem has turned into a blossoming metropolis of DFI activity. Transactions on polygon are quick and cheap, allowing users the freedom to achieve their defi goals, all while being economically anchored to Ethereum. But Polygon isn't just the proof of stake sidechain. The Polygon team is building a suite of scaling solutions, including polygon, Hermes, maiden, nightfall, and Xero, all with different design choices in order to be optimized for all possible crypto use cases. If you're a developer who wants to build on the polygon ecosystem, go to the link in the show notes to check out their fantastic documentation.
01:48:37.338 - 01:49:13.446, Speaker B: And if you're a user who just wants to experience fast and cheap DFI, you can bridge over your eth or other tokens and start playing around with any of the thousands of applications that are available on Polygon. The layer two era is upon us. Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day, and we need l two bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life. Across is the fastest and cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge. With across. You don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets back to the layer one assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across's bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle.
01:49:13.446 - 01:49:37.950, Speaker B: To securely transfer tokens from layer two back to Ethereum, across is critical ecosystem infrastructure and ownership is being handed over to the community. You can be a part of this story of across by joining the discord and becoming a co founder and helping to design the fair, fair launch of across. If you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely, go to accross to bridge your assets between ETH, optimism, arbitram or boba networks.
01:49:38.110 - 01:49:48.054, Speaker A: Alright, guys, we are back with the takes of the week. Here you go. First take. Some ponzies are scams. Others are the basis of human society. That's quite a contrast. What do you think?
01:49:48.172 - 01:49:57.162, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we use the Ponzi word a lot at times here on bankless, and that's because of how this tweet is, right? In our opinion. I think I can speak for you, Ryan, when you agree.
01:49:57.216 - 01:49:58.538, Speaker A: Totally agree, 100%.
01:49:58.624 - 01:50:02.946, Speaker B: Sometimes people are like, you guys use the Ponzi word way too much. No Ponzi games.
01:50:02.998 - 01:50:04.030, Speaker A: You don't use it enough.
01:50:04.100 - 01:50:23.106, Speaker B: You don't use it enough. Yeah. Everything is based on the fact that other people value the same thing, which is the basis for human shared interest, psyche value. So, yeah, some ponzies are somebody's going to dump on you and then buy the more sustainable Ponzi, but it's Ponzi's all the way down.
01:50:23.288 - 01:50:44.082, Speaker A: I just enjoyed this know, Ponzi's are a coordination game. And the book that taught me that really, more than anything else was Yuval's book. Sapiens. Yeah, basically the thesis is all of humanity, all of our civilization, all of our coordination technology. The reason we can do things that the animal kingdom can't is because of shared myths. Stories.
01:50:44.146 - 01:50:44.962, Speaker B: Shared stories.
01:50:45.106 - 01:50:58.446, Speaker A: Ponzies are an outcome of these shared stories and shared myths, in fact, they're a result of it. And so these are actually our coordination technology. That doesn't mean Ponzi scheme, doesn't mean Bernie Madoff. That's not what we're talking about. Anyway, once you understand telling people a.
01:50:58.468 - 01:51:00.750, Speaker B: Story, that's not actually just.
01:51:00.820 - 01:51:13.650, Speaker A: I feel like this is a fundamental education block in crypto. You almost have to understand this before you understand bitcoin and the rest of the monetary phenomenon and everything that's going on. That's why we're.
01:51:13.720 - 01:51:18.918, Speaker B: Money is a gigantic Ponzi that doesn't pop. Good monies are ponzies that don't pop.
01:51:19.004 - 01:51:21.766, Speaker A: All right, next take DC investor take. What is he saying here?
01:51:21.788 - 01:52:12.726, Speaker B: David, I am done building identities and brands which corporations can buy and sell without paying me, and for me to be expected to go along with a ride because my identity is attached to them. From now on, we'll only future art by independent artists and CCO PFPs on this account. So this is in reaction to yuga Labs buying the cryptopunks IP from larva Labs and DC investor is saying he only likes nfts where he is the sole owner of the IP and because he doesn't want centralized companies buying the ip of an NFT profile picture, that he rocks. So I will point out that DC investor now has an MFER as his profile picture because Sartoshi and the MFers are CCO and they give complete ownership rights of the IP towards the owners of the NFT. So that's pretty cool.
01:52:12.748 - 01:52:20.258, Speaker A: So is DC an example of somebody who is maybe not so happy, a punk holder that's not so happy about this Yuga Labs initiative?
01:52:20.354 - 01:52:25.286, Speaker B: He is cautiously pessimistic, I will say where I'm cautiously optimistic.
01:52:25.478 - 01:52:30.542, Speaker A: Are there some people in the crypto punk community who are just like ballistic angry I'm selling all my punks kind of thing?
01:52:30.676 - 01:52:35.006, Speaker B: I saw one tweet about that, but no, I haven't seen more than that.
01:52:35.188 - 01:52:46.194, Speaker A: Interesting. I'm really enjoying seeing that play out. It's just interesting to see that play out, he says more on the CCO thing. Should we read that too? Yeah.
01:52:46.232 - 01:53:02.230, Speaker B: Clarifying my thoughts on CCO CCO doesn't mean it's a better NFT. There's lots of garbage CCO nfts. It's also possible some corporate administered nfts outperforms for many reasons. I simply prefer to participate in communities where they can't sell my participation to others.
01:53:02.300 - 01:53:31.130, Speaker A: So DC some takes Indy, he's an indie NFT holder. Let's talk about this. Your take. The narrative around eth has evolved beyond my wildest dreams. That's you. And you're saying that you're, quote tweeting this consensus tweet that says all proceeds from the round? This is the massive round that consensus just raised 450,000,000. Is that how much it was? To further build consensus, the funds from the round will be converted to ETH to further build consensus.
01:53:31.130 - 01:53:32.814, Speaker A: Ultrasound money position.
01:53:32.932 - 01:53:54.086, Speaker B: Ultrasound money position. You love to see it. You love to see it. In order to rebalance its EtH to fiat ratio in line with consensus's treasury strategy. So consensus picking a new unit of account to measure wealth in. And they're naming that unit of account ultrasound money. This was infeasible where they got that from?
01:53:54.108 - 01:53:54.306, Speaker A: Teen?
01:53:54.338 - 01:53:55.654, Speaker B: Yeah. Where did they get that from?
01:53:55.692 - 01:54:00.850, Speaker A: Well, the podcast wasn't even out at this time last year. It just came out. So it wasn't feasible.
01:54:00.930 - 01:54:04.860, Speaker B: Does this mean that $450,000,000 of ETH buy. Pressure is coming.
01:54:05.710 - 01:54:06.746, Speaker A: I don't know. It should be.
01:54:06.768 - 01:54:07.738, Speaker B: It's what the tweet says.
01:54:07.824 - 01:54:14.782, Speaker A: You got to buy it back. Consensus. Buy what you sold at 80. This is my take. You want to read it?
01:54:14.916 - 01:54:18.986, Speaker B: The more you know, the less you diversify. Ryan. Sean Adams.
01:54:19.098 - 01:54:49.234, Speaker A: Yeah, that's it. That's the take, man. I feel like this is true for my own investment strategy. The more I know about a particular asset, the more conviction I have about a particular asset, the less I care about diversifying. And I do think that conviction holds. Concentrated portfolio positions are the real way to build long term wealth. I see so many people enter crypto when they don't really know what they're buying, and they'll do like a shotgun scattershot approach.
01:54:49.234 - 01:55:24.290, Speaker A: It's like, get a little bit of this, a little bit of this, and some youtuber recommended this, and I'm getting this, and I think that's because they don't know enough. And I find that in myself, too. I don't look at individual equities very often. So if I ever participate in equities, guess what I'm buying. S and p 500, right? But I don't participate in equities because I know about crypto. And the more I know about crypto, the less I want to diversify out of crypto as an asset class. So it also holds true from an asset class categories.
01:55:24.290 - 01:55:45.834, Speaker A: Crypto is going to be the future. It's so obvious to me. Why would I hold my wealth in anything other than crypto? I don't feel like I need to diversify. I mean, have some safety nets, for sure, but have a house, have some stable coins, have some dry powder, but I'm not diversifying out of crypto, man.
01:55:45.872 - 01:55:49.690, Speaker B: It's like all in crypto rhymes with diversification.
01:55:50.830 - 01:55:51.386, Speaker A: What?
01:55:51.488 - 01:55:55.226, Speaker B: Capitulation. Exactly. Right? Yeah. Right.
01:55:55.248 - 01:56:04.000, Speaker A: Well, I guess, I mean, some people, when I tweeted this out, some people made the point that a whole lot of people delude themselves on this, too. Get burnt. Right? Yeah.
01:56:04.690 - 01:56:07.440, Speaker B: You're rewarded if you're right, and you're punished if you're wrong.
01:56:08.230 - 01:56:13.762, Speaker A: Why not? Why not live life like that? All right, so you have a take on my take, though. What is it?
01:56:13.816 - 01:56:30.620, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is a great way to illustrate the difference in our dispositions as individuals, where Ryan Sean Adams very politely says, the more you know, the less you diversify. And I just, quote, tweet him. I say, here's what he really means. He means diversification is for the weak have a spine, folks. Believe in yourself.
01:56:31.790 - 01:56:38.842, Speaker A: I guess that is what I mean. David, you put it very succinctly as well. All right, man. What are you excited about this week?
01:56:38.976 - 01:57:04.290, Speaker B: Oh, God, Ryan, I am just excited for ETH season. If we indeed are going into the bear market, then at least it will be Eth season. Along the way, it'll be the one entertaining, the one bright spot on the horizon of what is just like a crazy, crazy macro environment with the potential r word coming. Or none of that happens and it's still e season either way. It's easy season. So I'm excited either way.
01:57:04.360 - 01:57:12.994, Speaker A: Do you mean you're happy to hold on to eth if it's going down? As long as it's going down less relative to the rest of crypto?
01:57:13.042 - 01:57:13.574, Speaker B: Sure, yeah.
01:57:13.612 - 01:57:14.470, Speaker A: That would make you fine.
01:57:14.540 - 01:57:19.970, Speaker B: That's about. But also, just like, Eth season means more than just like, price action.
01:57:20.050 - 01:57:21.294, Speaker A: Eth price action.
01:57:21.442 - 01:57:40.046, Speaker B: Yeah, it's build season. It's like, let's come back to our fundamentals. Let's come back to what's real. Let's get rid of the noise. Let's talk about my favorite topic ever, which is ultrasound money. This is when the crypto Twitter discourse is talking about the thing that I care about other than some ridiculous NFT Ponzi scheme or play to earn game or whatever.
01:57:40.228 - 01:57:55.490, Speaker A: Yeah, I hear you. That'll actually be refreshing. No matter what the price is doing at that point in time, it's like we're shipping stuff for the future. That matters a lot, right? Like, the merge is going to be absolutely massive. The biggest fundamental event, prices aside, who cares about prices? I mean, this is history.
01:57:55.640 - 01:57:57.730, Speaker B: Well, I care a little bit about prices.
01:57:58.070 - 01:57:58.950, Speaker A: We do.
01:57:59.100 - 01:58:00.920, Speaker B: All right, Ryan. We do care a lot.
01:58:01.370 - 01:58:32.826, Speaker A: I'm excited about the token frame I have behind me. So the folks at token frame sent me one of these. It's pretty awesome. Look, I'm new to the NFT scene, okay? I don't know what I'm doing with it, but this is a digital frame. First one I've ever tried, and I really like how it works. So what's cool about this is you actually connect metamask and they're verified nfTs, right? So this is not just a jpeg or a screenshot. It's actually pulling my cool cat from my portfolio.
01:58:32.826 - 01:58:35.600, Speaker A: It's also cool is I can change it around.
01:58:36.930 - 01:58:38.466, Speaker B: I'm about to get your turtle or.
01:58:38.488 - 01:58:41.230, Speaker A: Your MFR if I want to change. Boom.
01:58:41.310 - 01:58:42.834, Speaker B: Wow, that actually is pretty cool.
01:58:42.872 - 01:58:43.854, Speaker A: From cat to turtle.
01:58:43.902 - 01:58:44.386, Speaker B: That's pretty cool.
01:58:44.408 - 01:58:58.582, Speaker A: Just like that. I'm still learning. I also would like to remove the cord. I think I have to poke a hole in the wall, do some more work, and put the cord behind it. But it's cool, man. Physical meets digital. It's been fun.
01:58:58.636 - 01:59:13.658, Speaker B: I think it'd be super. Can you go back to your cat? I think it'd be super funny if you dressed up as your cat one day. Kind of like how we did with Halloween. Yeah, but a red flannel, a white t shirt, a bull cap. And what else is that's. That's it? That'd be a good look. It'd be a good look.
01:59:13.744 - 01:59:22.718, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I'm holding my cat. I'm holding my. Know. I don't know. Do you ever sell nfts, David? Do you flip nfts or are you just always buy?
01:59:22.804 - 01:59:39.822, Speaker B: Sometimes I buy one and the hype just doesn't sustain itself. And then I just kind of see it on its trend to zero. So I'll sell some of those, but the ones that I shill on Twitter, I do not sell based off of principle. So that includes my crypto punk, my mfers. Are there any others?
01:59:39.976 - 01:59:54.010, Speaker A: This is the thing. I don't know how to make money on nfts, David, because whenever I buy an NFT, I don't want to sell it anymore. I get attached to it. So I'm just like, well, am I the sucker? Like, am I actually buying an asset if I'm never going to sell it for real money?
01:59:54.080 - 01:59:56.762, Speaker B: You're just buying a noun at that point. Yeah.
01:59:56.896 - 02:00:12.894, Speaker A: Well, at some point, though, maybe nfts get integrated into the broader defi economy, right? You can lend against it. You can borrow against all sorts of things. So maybe I won't have to sell and can still be worth it. Anyway, that's what I'm excited about. Token frame. Thank you guys for that frame. It's awesome.
02:00:12.894 - 02:00:14.450, Speaker A: Let's get to meme of the week, though.
02:00:14.520 - 02:00:15.074, Speaker B: Meme of the week.
02:00:15.112 - 02:00:18.580, Speaker A: This is on theme. You ready? Yes. Here you go.
02:00:19.830 - 02:00:31.830, Speaker B: It's merge week. This is the ultrasound money. Twitter account saying issuance now, 15k EtH a day. Issuance at merge, 1.5k eth a day. And then the meme is, they don't know. They don't know.
02:00:31.900 - 02:00:34.182, Speaker A: It's that dude at the party, like, sitting in the corner, right?
02:00:34.236 - 02:00:40.342, Speaker B: Yeah. Bankless listener dancing, you know, because bankless told you guys.
02:00:40.396 - 02:00:53.414, Speaker A: You also know none of this has been financial advice. Bitcoin is risky. So is ETh. So is Defi.
