00:00:00.170 - 00:00:22.574, Speaker A: Gary Gensler and the SEC are charging Gemini and Genesis, charging them with unregistered securities, with selling those, and they're doing all of this after the fact. David this is a total mall cop move, isn't it? Bankless Nation, it is the third week of January. David tell them what time it is.
00:00:22.692 - 00:00:46.566, Speaker B: Ryan it is the Friday Bankless Weekly roll up, where we covered the entire weekly news in crypto, which continues to be fiasco after fiasco, although entertainment value does increase lately. And so if you are not drinking your coffee, what are you doing? Go grab your coffee, because it's going to be a pretty good roll up. Might be kind of long. We'll see. We'll try and speed this up. It's going to be a long one, but there's a lot of good stuff to talk about this week.
00:00:46.588 - 00:00:47.702, Speaker A: I mean, it's quality, though.
00:00:47.756 - 00:00:49.638, Speaker B: It's really good stuff. It's some good stuff.
00:00:49.724 - 00:00:55.594, Speaker A: All these roll ups. There's just quality. And I'm drinking my I think this is my fourth, I want to say cup of coffee.
00:00:55.642 - 00:00:55.854, Speaker B: Wow.
00:00:55.892 - 00:00:59.662, Speaker A: Nothing like the fourth, right? What do you want? Number one?
00:00:59.716 - 00:01:04.110, Speaker B: Number two first, it's always downhill after number one. It's true.
00:01:04.180 - 00:01:04.874, Speaker A: Till tomorrow.
00:01:04.922 - 00:01:05.886, Speaker B: You got to sleep it off and.
00:01:05.908 - 00:01:10.610, Speaker A: Then you have to wake up and, yeah, your 8th isn't tasting as good as your second.
00:01:10.680 - 00:01:12.946, Speaker B: Seriously, eat, drink eight cups of coffee sometimes.
00:01:13.128 - 00:01:15.826, Speaker A: I'm not going to say I don't. Okay. I'm not going to say I don't.
00:01:15.858 - 00:01:20.610, Speaker B: That is insane. I would literally die someday.
00:01:20.770 - 00:01:23.880, Speaker A: We'll do flights of coffee together, you and I know.
00:01:24.250 - 00:01:25.830, Speaker B: Can we do flights of beer?
00:01:26.170 - 00:01:28.162, Speaker A: Both first the coffee, then the beer.
00:01:28.306 - 00:01:30.038, Speaker B: We'll do that at permissionless. How about that?
00:01:30.124 - 00:01:42.542, Speaker A: Sounds good. All right, topics of the week, we got to discuss the bankruptcy of Genesis that might actually be happening. Some news broke this week. And also the unbundling of digital currency group. It's all wrapped together. What else are we talking about?
00:01:42.596 - 00:02:11.714, Speaker B: Yeah, if anyone is interested in buying CoinDesk, you might be in luck following that. Gary Gensler, the mall cop, coming in hot, being all mall. Copy on that. Segue and then the big news of the week, crypto. Twitter just struck by fear when rumors of the Department of justice was going after an international crypto exchange that starts with the letter B, a massive takedown.
00:02:11.842 - 00:02:12.182, Speaker A: What?
00:02:12.236 - 00:02:17.000, Speaker B: So hold on to your seats because we got to cover that one. It was absolutely gargantuan news.
00:02:17.450 - 00:02:36.080, Speaker A: Got to talk about that, too. All right, guys, if you're listening on YouTube, we're watching on YouTube. Make sure you like and subscribe. If you are listening to this on the podcast, of course, subscribe to that podcast, too. David before we get in, got to talk about our friends and sponsors over at the Crypto tax calculator because, David, you know what season it is.
00:02:36.450 - 00:02:43.598, Speaker B: Oh, God, it is tax prep season, my friend. You guys hear how Jubilant Ryan is, right?
00:02:43.684 - 00:03:04.918, Speaker A: Know I'm only excited because the tools have gotten better. It used to be so much more painful to do this kind of thing. And that's why we're talking about crypto Tax calculator, because this is probably the best tool I've seen for those complicated trades, those complicated DeFi transactions. You know, the stuff where you're on a L2 and then you're interacting with this weird D Five protocol and.
00:03:04.924 - 00:03:07.830, Speaker B: You'Re token inside of another app.
00:03:07.900 - 00:03:09.938, Speaker A: Yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yield.
00:03:10.034 - 00:03:11.750, Speaker B: Right? Yield is volatile.
00:03:11.830 - 00:03:19.510, Speaker A: Yeah, you're a liquidity farmer somewhere. Anyway, wouldn't it be nice if you just plug in your ETH address and we just calculate what you owe?
00:03:19.590 - 00:03:20.218, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:20.384 - 00:03:22.410, Speaker A: This is what Crypto tax calculator does.
00:03:22.480 - 00:03:29.770, Speaker B: That is previously what I do, but I do it to a human. But it makes sense that the AI is stoked about the calculator that you can plug.
00:03:29.930 - 00:03:34.750, Speaker A: Don't give it to humans aren't as good as robots. David, how many times we have to talk about this?
00:03:34.900 - 00:03:38.274, Speaker B: That's why I keep you around. All right?
00:03:38.312 - 00:03:53.634, Speaker A: So this will sort out your tax nightmare. So that's why I'm a little excited, a little jubilant, because this is the best tool I've seen for those complicated transactions. They've got L1s and L two S 600 integrations coverage for about 300,000 cryptocurrencies.
00:03:53.682 - 00:03:55.574, Speaker B: I did not even know that there were that many.
00:03:55.692 - 00:04:09.002, Speaker A: Thank you. All you got to do is connect your wallet and it spits out what you owe. And so this is a way for Dgens to actually do their taxes. If you're Djen thinking about not doing your taxes, I would advise against that. It's not a good idea.
00:04:09.056 - 00:04:13.662, Speaker B: You either do it now or you do it later. And it's worse if you do it later. Let me tell you, I've experienced that one.
00:04:13.716 - 00:04:30.462, Speaker A: Yeah. Do not procrastinate these things. Anyway, you guys can go to Bankless CC Cryptotaxcalculator and sign up. Also, if you sign up with the code bank 30. Do you hear that? Bank 30. You get a 30% discount on this puppy. So go check that out in the show notes.
00:04:30.526 - 00:04:43.426, Speaker B: Yeah. But if you are in the Bankless Nation discord, there is a different code for even more percentage off. So if you are a Bankless Nation member, go into the discord if you are interested in getting that more than 30% discount.
00:04:43.538 - 00:04:50.358, Speaker A: Even better. Even better. Okay, let's get to the markets. David, what are we talking about on the bitcoin prices? Are we up? We down.
00:04:50.444 - 00:05:02.154, Speaker B: We are up big on the week. Starting the week at $18,900. Up double digits in bitcoin to where we are currently at $20,900 10% on the week for bitcoin. That's big.
00:05:02.192 - 00:05:04.474, Speaker A: Double digits. You mean percentage wise double digits.
00:05:04.522 - 00:05:05.386, Speaker B: Percentage wise.
00:05:05.498 - 00:05:18.190, Speaker A: That's big. Because last week I remember we were up to and now we're above 20K, which is a big milestone. That's feeling pretty good. I mean, what are the Bears doing right now? Are they retreating?
00:05:18.350 - 00:05:28.466, Speaker B: I think they are covering or buying one of the two. We are definitely getting short squeezed out of the bottom right now. That's what, basically the theme of the last ten days, I'd say, is short squeeze off the bottom.
00:05:28.568 - 00:05:35.446, Speaker A: Usually Trader Bears have a little denial phase for a while, and I think I've seen some of that on Twitter as well. Okay. How about ETH? What's that doing for us?
00:05:35.468 - 00:06:00.922, Speaker B: Ether price started the week last week at one $420, up 8%, where we are currently at 1535. We touched one $620 for the high, the intra week high. This whole Department of justice fear mongering caused the market to jump down a bunch. We've recovered a little bit, but not too much. So we are currently at $1,535. So up 8% on the week for ether.
00:06:00.986 - 00:06:07.150, Speaker A: It's got to be painful for bears. That's a big week for ETH as well. How about on the ETH bitcoin ratio? Up or down?
00:06:07.220 - 00:06:20.082, Speaker B: Yeah, retraced a little bit because the last week was extremely green. I think last week was something like four or 5% green. I can't remember. Two and a half percent. We are down two and a half percent. We are down to zero point 75 on the ratio. Bitcoin's back, baby.
00:06:20.146 - 00:06:21.880, Speaker A: It's back. Never left.
00:06:22.250 - 00:06:23.640, Speaker B: It's not dead yet.
00:06:25.770 - 00:06:29.978, Speaker A: Look. Global cryptocurrency market cap. David, I can read these charts, too.
00:06:30.064 - 00:06:44.170, Speaker B: We are above a trillion this week, $1 trillion. It's been three months since a trillion, maybe two. Definitely since prior. I think FTX caused us to absolutely nuke below a trillion. And now we are at 1.1 trillion.
00:06:44.250 - 00:06:57.022, Speaker A: You guys will remember at the top of the market in 2021, we hit 3 trillion. So back above a trillion, the Trillionaires Club, I guess for crypto, we reached it.
00:06:57.076 - 00:07:04.402, Speaker B: I remember in 2017, if you go to that peak back in 2017, I remember sending a message in my crypto chat to all my friends.
00:07:04.456 - 00:07:05.522, Speaker A: It was like a baby thing.
00:07:05.576 - 00:07:30.554, Speaker B: Yeah, we were at 900,000. We were about to hit 1 trillion for the first time. So I sent out a message like, all right, guys, how many months after we hit 1 trillion will we hit 3 trillion? And this was December of 2017. I was like, all right, is it going to be February or April or June of 2018 when we hit like 3 trillion? And turns out it was four more.
00:07:30.592 - 00:07:35.774, Speaker A: Years later, it was 48 months rather than four months. Right. Or whatever. Six months, something like that.
00:07:35.812 - 00:07:36.586, Speaker B: Off by a smidge.
00:07:36.618 - 00:07:49.390, Speaker A: Yeah. Not bad, though. Not bad. Feeling good this week. We did get there eventually. Now we've of course, retraced down below a trillion, but we're back. Let's talk about some other market metrics here, David.
00:07:49.390 - 00:08:23.642, Speaker A: One is conversation about the Fed, maybe the Fed cutting interest rates, which is pretty big. The Fed set to cut interest rates by the end of 2023. This is not the Fed, of course, saying this. This is not Jerome powell. This is KPMG so this is an analyst saying this, that the Fed might cut interest rates amid a US recession. I think the exact prediction is this, that in the first half of 2023, that's the half that we're in right now, we will enter a recession. And do you recall what a recession actually is? Like, the technical definition?
00:08:23.786 - 00:08:29.742, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like three quarters in a row of declining growth or something like that. It's like time boxed, too.
00:08:29.796 - 00:08:48.014, Speaker A: Yeah, it's two consecutive quarters of negative growth, domestic product. And of course, GDP is the value of all the goods and services that a country produces. So that would be two quarters of negative GDP. So KPMG is saying we'll go into a recession this quarter and that will cause the Fed to stop cutting interest rates.
00:08:48.142 - 00:08:49.866, Speaker B: Are we not already in a recession?
00:08:49.998 - 00:09:06.186, Speaker A: We were not technically right. Okay. We haven't actually technically hit that R word. So the idea being that the Fed might start cutting interest rates at the end of the year. This is sort of what analysts are saying and what the market is saying. That said, what is this tweet telling us?
00:09:06.288 - 00:09:21.182, Speaker B: Yeah, this tweet and the next tweet, I think, contrast really well with each other. This is watcher guru. One of these, like, breaking Twitter accounts. US. National debt reaches an all time high of $31.4 trillion. $31.4
00:09:21.182 - 00:09:29.474, Speaker B: trillion of collective debt. All time highs. I mean, it's always reaching all time highs. And it reached an all time high again.
00:09:29.592 - 00:09:39.654, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that's to tell us that the money supply keeps increasing no matter what the economy is doing. Bear or bull, it's always increasing, it seems like.
00:09:39.772 - 00:10:21.202, Speaker B: And in stark contrast, the ETH burn is burning. We are at negative 2170 ETH. So I think these things to these all time high of US. Debt versus burning ether, the rate of ETH burn being pretty close to all time highs is nicely contrasting with each other. When debt reaches all time high, it's like future dollars that need to be burnt in order to come back to an equilibrium. And we have a debt of $31 trillion that we need to collectively burn in order to come back to zero, to net out. And ether is just burning ether, right? Burning ether left and right.
00:10:21.256 - 00:10:43.162, Speaker A: It's so interesting to watch. Kind of the we've talked about ethereum like a GDP, basically. Ethereum being sort of a digital nation. Ethereum also has ether and a monetary schedule for ether. And rather than hitting debt all time highs, as you said, it actually went deflationary since the merge. So that happened on Sunday, by the way, David. I was kind of looking at these numbers.
00:10:43.162 - 00:11:19.590, Speaker A: You know, it's dipped into deflationary territory, ultrasound money territory before, but then when block based demand decreased, of course, issuance net issuance goes up. Now it dropped back down. So ETH is once again ultrasound money since the merge. The bankless analyst team put together a state of Ethereum and comparing last quarter so Q Four of 2022 with Q Four of 2021. And we do this every quarter. Ben from our team puts this together. I think it's a fantastic post.
00:11:19.590 - 00:11:47.120, Speaker A: A lot of takeaways from this report, but you could see sort of what the GDP, what the economy of Ethereum looks like in a bear market. Because Ethereum in last quarter was definitely in a bear market as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, when it was kind of up only, and it was pure bull market. So a few metrics to look at. Net revenue, network revenue, that is was down by 93%.
00:11:48.370 - 00:11:49.230, Speaker B: Ouch.
00:11:49.730 - 00:12:09.958, Speaker A: What does the Ethereum economy kind of like, I guess, produce or what is its tax base? Maybe that's a better way to say it. What is it selling is blocks. And so network revenue was down from about 4 billion in 2021 Q Four to 267,000,000. And so this is saying, just like.
00:12:10.124 - 00:12:22.860, Speaker B: Gas fees are down by 93.8%, that's synonymous. Right? And so, like, network revenue, block space sales, gas fees, these are all different blocks based things. Yeah. Block space demand, 4%.
00:12:23.790 - 00:12:43.550, Speaker A: Now, this is interesting. So was ETH burned? And you would sort of expect that. So in Q one of last year, we were burning a lot more ETH EIP 15 five nine was already implemented. So the burn was down as compared to the previous quarter, 2021 Q Four versus 2022 Q Four was down 94% as well.
00:12:43.620 - 00:13:15.866, Speaker B: Now, this next metric yeah, I think is you talk so awesome. What is okay, so we have 94% less Ether being burned because we have 94% less block space demand for Ethereum, and yet the ETH inflation rate is down. I think it's a broken metric because it went from positive to negative. So even with a 94% reduction in Ethereum block space demand, ether inflation is down like, over 100%.
00:13:15.968 - 00:13:18.186, Speaker A: It was 101%.
00:13:18.368 - 00:13:22.750, Speaker B: It was at zero point 34%. Yearly inflation rate.
00:13:22.820 - 00:13:28.910, Speaker A: Well, actually, for the quarter, for the entire quarter, it increased zero point 34%.
00:13:29.060 - 00:13:53.890, Speaker B: Excuse me. Okay, so yes. Q four of 2021. Ether inflated. The Issuance grew by zero point 34% in this quarter. Even with 94% of block space demand leaving the ecosystem, ether inflation went to negative zero, zero 4%. And why did this happen? Of course, because of the merge.
00:13:53.890 - 00:13:54.742, Speaker B: The merge happened.
00:13:54.796 - 00:14:16.810, Speaker A: I mean, that's the first full quarter Ethereum has ever had of being deflationary. Ultrasound money. That happened last quarter. Net deflationary in Q four of 2022. So that is a very bullish metric, I think. And then we have daily active addresses just down 20%, actually not down too much, considering it's been a bear market. And then read this one ETH staked.
00:14:16.810 - 00:14:18.254, Speaker A: What has that done?
00:14:18.452 - 00:14:37.134, Speaker B: Almost doubled. It was 8.8 million Ether staked last year, 2021 Q 415.8 million. We were actually at this time of because this concluded this was last quarter. We have like 19 days of january since then, and we're over 16 million staked. So we are almost double since Q four 2021 of Estaked.
00:14:37.182 - 00:14:55.222, Speaker A: You can look at the other aspects of the economy. You can look at kind of DFI on Ethereum, of course, DFI TVL is down 75%. Stablecoin supply is only down 5%. Wow, which is impressive. So that stayed pretty steady. People are rotating back into stablecoins. They're not exiting to fiat in a bank.
00:14:55.286 - 00:15:08.638, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. DFI TVL ether price down like 60, 70%. Stablecoin supply gets a boost as a result of that because where does that value go? It goes into stablecoins. So that's probably why stablecoins are only down 5%.
00:15:08.724 - 00:15:40.300, Speaker A: Liquid staking deposits also doubled. So that's been huge. And this is why we're seeing kind of the LSD tokens we were talking about last week increase. A whole bunch NFT volumes is an interesting metric as well. So daily NFT traders is only down 14%, which is interesting based on last year. And the LTU ecosystem, of course, is sort of a marvel to behold. Arbitrum monthly active addresses is up 730%.
00:15:40.300 - 00:15:54.266, Speaker A: Optimism is up 740%. So even though Arbitrum network revenue and Optimism network revenue, they sell block space too, is down. The active addresses are just up into the right.
00:15:54.448 - 00:16:25.606, Speaker B: But also, it's important to know that Arbitrum network revenue and Optimism network revenue, okay, down 86%, down 63%. We want the Ethereum revenue, layer one revenue to be up. But actually we want L2 revenue to be down. Because when L2 revenue is down, that means L2 transaction fees are also down. And so when Arbitrum released Arbitrum Nitro, when Optimism released Bedrock and all their other updates, they were actually making their layer one footprint smaller. And so network revenue going down is actually a sign of success for these things because that means fees are going down.
00:16:25.708 - 00:16:59.394, Speaker A: Yeah, this is really cool. This is what the Ethereum economy looks like in a recession. And you could see a bunch of the metrics are down, but one thing that's very interesting is supply also goes down. That does not happen during the recessions of nation state. Usually debt increases during recessions that nation states have, whereas in Ethereum, money supply has decreased. So, pretty interesting to see. David, why don't you talk about this too? I know we've been tracking prices of other alternative layer ones.
00:16:59.394 - 00:17:03.938, Speaker A: I think the Solana price maybe warrants some discussion. What's this tweet saying?
00:17:04.024 - 00:17:27.322, Speaker B: I think this is coming out of the announcement last week where FTX found a bunch of crypto assets under the cushions. And so we've discovered how much FTX owns of Salana, the Sol network. FTX owns 11% of sole tokens of the market cap of Salana, which is a dubious place to pay in $700.
00:17:27.376 - 00:17:29.482, Speaker A: Billion worth $700 billion.
00:17:29.536 - 00:17:47.890, Speaker B: Like, you can't sell that amount into the market and it would send it to zero. And so there's this precarious position where this entity that's going through bankruptcy, owns 11% of the market. Cap of salon needs to be liquidated. Needs to be liquidated. I don't know how that happens. That's bad, right?
00:17:47.960 - 00:18:02.502, Speaker A: That is bad. Yes. So this could be obviously a negative price catalyst on Sole tokens. Interesting, we had Anatoly on the podcast, recorded that just last week. We're going to release that episode, too. He definitely thinks Solana has a bright future ahead.
00:18:02.636 - 00:18:03.334, Speaker B: Of course he does.
00:18:03.372 - 00:18:13.530, Speaker A: Stay tuned for that episode and you'll catch his take there. This was interesting, too. Why did the FTT price this is FTX's native token. Why did that spike randomly on?
00:18:13.600 - 00:18:37.922, Speaker B: Dude, I don't know. Today we're looking at the two week price action. And actually this bike on the very far right just happened since we started recording. We are back above $2.30. I mean, Dgens in crypto will trade absolutely anything. Some people just think this thing is a goddamn casino, which it totally is. But yeah, FTT price, the token of FTX is pumping for some goddamn reason.
00:18:37.922 - 00:18:44.340, Speaker B: And pumping is relative. Fully diluted valuation, $600 million.
00:18:44.710 - 00:18:47.634, Speaker A: What the hell, dude? I don't understand.
00:18:47.832 - 00:18:49.350, Speaker B: We should start an exchange.
00:18:50.810 - 00:18:53.574, Speaker A: News on that coming later. David, what do we have coming up next?
00:18:53.612 - 00:18:54.786, Speaker B: Bankless starts an exchange.
00:18:54.818 - 00:18:58.214, Speaker A: No, we are absolutely not doing that. But someone else is.
00:18:58.412 - 00:19:19.626, Speaker B: Well, somebody else is shutting down an exchange, but that'll be the third thing, the third big news of the week that we talk about. First we got to talk about the DCG fire cell. We got the Genesis bankruptcy. So the bankruptcy is probably starting. I don't think it's official, but it's looking pretty like rumors. Rumors. And then also rumors have surfaced that CoinDesk is looking for a buyer.
00:19:19.626 - 00:19:49.542, Speaker B: CoinDesk, of course, is a subsidiary of DCG. So the unbundling of DCG is underway. And then beep beep, Gary Gensler Mulcop coming through now that he's arrived on the scene. Now that DCG and crypto are weak, gary Gensler comes with his traffic ticket. Save the day and then saving the day and then an exchange that starts with the letter B gets charged with a department by the Department of justice. Oh, no. Everyone run and hold on.
00:19:49.542 - 00:20:38.594, Speaker B: So we're going to get to all of those subjects and more. But first I want to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors to help you go bankless like Kraken, who lets you get your boomer money out of TradFi and into the Sci-Fi world of crypto. Kraken has been a leader in the crypto industry for the last twelve years.

This last bull market had a ton of them. Did you get them all? Maybe you missed one. So here's what you should do.
00:21:08.974 - 00:21:37.942, Speaker B: Go to Earnify and plug in your Ethereum wallet. And Earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed Airdrops that you can get. And it also does poaps and mintable NFDS any kind of money that your wallet can claim. Earnify will tell you about it. And you should probably do it now because some Airdrops expire. And if you sign up for Earnify, they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new AirDrop for it to make sure that you never lose an AirDrop ever again. You can also upgrade to Earnify premium to unlock access to Airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets.
00:21:37.942 - 00:21:49.802, Speaker B: And for just under $21 a month, it probably pays for itself with just one AirDrop. So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get. That's Earni Fi and make sure you never lose another AirDrop.
00:21:49.866 - 00:22:04.738, Speaker A: Gary Gensler and the SEC are charging Gemini and Genesis, calling them, charging them with unregistered securities with selling those, and they're doing all of this after the fact. David, this is a total mall cop move, isn't it?
00:22:04.824 - 00:22:05.890, Speaker B: This is ridiculous.
00:22:05.970 - 00:22:12.070, Speaker A: Dude, can we actually read what the charges are from this CNBC article?
00:22:12.410 - 00:22:34.990, Speaker B: Yeah. So, according to the SEC and Gary Gensler, the Gemini Earn program and Genesis were selling unregistered securities with a high yield product offered to depositors. Genesis loaned Gemini users crypto, kept a portion of the yield, shared that profit with Gemini. And a quote from the SEC, genesis should have registered that product as a securities offering.
00:22:35.330 - 00:22:38.638, Speaker A: Okay. Yes. Okay, go on.
00:22:38.724 - 00:22:46.158, Speaker B: That's great that we know this now, that they should have done that, that we are being informed of this help retail, that they are bankrupt.
00:22:46.254 - 00:23:03.010, Speaker A: I'm sure there's a way for this to help retail that has $900 million stuck in Gemini Earn accounts. This is Tyler Winklevoss tweeting about this, saying it's disappointing that the SEC chose to file an action today. What is he saying in this tweet thread?
00:23:03.090 - 00:23:31.966, Speaker B: He's basically saying, like, Yo, WTF, this doesn't do anything to help further our efforts. This isn't helping us with the proceedings between Gemini Earn and Genesis. And he says this action does nothing to further earn users and get their assets back. It's totally counterproductive. And also, the Earn program was regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services and they've been already in discussions with the SEC about the Earn program for more than 17 months.
00:23:32.068 - 00:23:37.266, Speaker A: That's Gemini has gemini has gemini has always engaged with regulators. That's been part of their thing.
00:23:37.368 - 00:23:57.590, Speaker B: That's been their brands like we are the compliant crypto exchange. And so Tyler says that even after in discussions with SEC for 17 months, they never raised the prospect of an enforcement action until after Genesis was bankrupt and they paused withdrawals, which is counterproductive after it's too late.
00:23:58.090 - 00:24:08.442, Speaker A: That's called like some major CYA type move, cover your ass move by Gensler and the SEC here big time and doesn't help Earn Retail get its money back.
00:24:08.576 - 00:24:36.070, Speaker B: Actually, it's going to cost both Genesis and Gemini money, which they're already running on fumes on, and any money that they have to go to deal with this from the SEC is coming out of future depositors returns. Depositors are already going to get less than $0.50 on the dollar. Now it's going to be like now the SEC is coming in with fines and depositors going to get $0.45 on the dollar. $0.30 on the dollar, like, less as a result of the SEC.
00:24:36.220 - 00:24:52.086, Speaker A: This is a take from Doge toshi the SEC. Charging Gemini and Genesis after users lose their funds is like OpenSea blacklisting an NFT after a hacker sells it. Like it doesn't do any good. What are you doing?
00:24:52.268 - 00:25:03.066, Speaker B: But I will carve out OpenSea. That is just a thing that their lawyers force them to do. It's not like what they want to do. It's not like they have a bad policy where they shouldn't do this.
00:25:03.168 - 00:25:04.862, Speaker A: It doesn't help. That's the thing.
00:25:04.996 - 00:25:12.106, Speaker B: But both are coming back to regulation. Like, they are forced to do that because of regulation. And then the SEC is doing this because, again, regulation.
00:25:12.218 - 00:25:17.230, Speaker A: Did you see, David, Gary Gensler's video? He made a little influencer video advertising it.
00:25:17.300 - 00:25:17.738, Speaker B: Did you see?
00:25:17.764 - 00:25:20.866, Speaker A: Office hours with Gary? Actually, let's play some of the sound behind this.
00:25:20.888 - 00:25:21.410, Speaker B: Oh, God.
00:25:21.480 - 00:25:23.534, Speaker A: We do that. We have to office hours with Gary.
00:25:23.582 - 00:25:28.230, Speaker B: All right, let's do it. What do seatbelts have to do with crypto lending?
00:25:36.890 - 00:25:52.422, Speaker A: So influencer video about this from Gary Gensler. This is the reply. I got a lot of likes. I don't know if he was ratioed here. He was almost ratioed here from crypto. Wendy, you charge them after the fact. Gary, this impacts retail less money to go around legal fees and fines.
00:25:52.422 - 00:26:07.346, Speaker A: It's like running a stop sign that wasn't there and giving someone a ticket. Please give clear guidelines that bolster positive growth. Yes, please do that. That's what we've been hoping for. Not more of this, not more gumming up the works. David, here's a meme on this, too. I love this.
00:26:07.448 - 00:26:29.050, Speaker B: You know I'm a big sucker for SpongeBob memes. This is the episode I can't remember. They're trying to save Bikini Bonnet from something, man. I'm actually sad that I can't remember the details, but it's at the end of the episode, they've totally destroyed the city. And it's SpongeBob turning to Patrick and said, we did it, Gary. We saved investors from crypto after the city's totally destroyed.
00:26:29.470 - 00:26:53.410, Speaker A: Very disappointing. So that's what's going on there. Meanwhile, the big question on everyone's mind is Genesis going bankrupt? This came out on Wednesday. Today. A post from Frank chapair of the Block. Genesis Global Capital creditors are negotiating a prepackaged bankruptcy plan with the firm. A prepackaged bankruptcy plan, that's interesting terminology.
00:26:53.410 - 00:27:31.034, Speaker A: Apparently this would allow for Swifter Process to go through bankruptcy if you do this kind of pre packaged deal before you actually enter the bankruptcy proceedings. So it could happen a lot faster than, say, something like FTX, where you're kind of forced negotiated bankruptcy, I guess. And so these are still rumors, I think. But this was actually reported by Bloomberg as well. The headline of this says crypto firm Genesis is preparing to file for bankruptcy. So maybe Bloomberg has a closer. It says the crypto lending unit of DCG could file as soon as this week.
00:27:31.034 - 00:27:57.858, Speaker A: And I guess, David, that impacts all of DCG Digital Currency Group. Could you just refresh people on the structure of Digital Currency Group and the things that it owns? Digital currency group. Of course. Barry Silbert is the CEO. They own Genesis, which is this asset that is preparing to file bankruptcy. This entire institutional lending and borrowing company, what else is in their portfolio?
00:27:57.954 - 00:28:24.426, Speaker B: Yeah, so Genesis of Lending Desk, Grayscale and the GBTC E Trusts, which are kind of actually the source of all the contagion. Also something that got basically kneecapped by the SEC by not being able to be turned into an. So like the SEC is just really just punching us at every single moment. Anyway, sorry. DCG also owns CoinDesk, which we're about to talk about and just a few other things. This thing called foundry. Luno trade block.
00:28:24.426 - 00:28:37.310, Speaker B: And also just a bunch of private equity investments, venture capital investments throughout the space. You have a pretty big, pretty big, like, what do you call these things? Consortiums of subsidiaries. Pretty big organization.
00:28:37.390 - 00:28:52.050, Speaker A: It's a giant organization, many billions of dollars. Kind of a long standing crypto institutional organization too. David, do you think all this is priced in or do you think that this is going to cause some more tumultuous times in crypto markets?
00:28:52.130 - 00:29:12.606, Speaker B: Yeah, you said that. This is really just rumors at this point. We actually don't know if this is true, but I think everyone is chalking this up just like, yeah, this is something, this is going to totally happen. Like something's got to happen. And it looks like there's not really too many paths forward. So Genesis preparing for bankruptcy. DCG will probably keep Grayscale because that thing is an.
00:29:12.606 - 00:29:32.018, Speaker B: Absolute cash cow. But I think everyone, the fact that markets didn't really nuke when we got this bad, bad news because this perhaps implies a bunch of selling pressure implies that this was already priced in. And so the market is like, I don't care about any more bad news. Like, I'm not selling at this point because we're already so down bad.
00:29:32.104 - 00:29:42.610, Speaker A: I actually think in a way, it's good news because we do have to clean this up, right? It's been in limbo for a period of time and markets hate uncertainty. This is maybe more certainty. What happens to CoinDesk? David?
00:29:42.690 - 00:30:08.506, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is another rumor, but crypto publication CoinDesk has hired Lazard, which is a private equity investment bank, I believe, to help facilitate the sale of CoinDesk. So CoinDesk is a valuable product, a valuable company. And so they are looking for a buyer because DCG needs the money. So CoinDesk, CoinDesk is up for sale. Who wants to buy CoinDesk?
00:30:08.618 - 00:30:12.538, Speaker A: Do you think traditional media will buy it? Like somebody like CNBC? Or do you think this will come internal?
00:30:12.554 - 00:30:21.250, Speaker B: To think I think outside my bet is somebody outside of crypto, something like a Bloomberg or something like that.
00:30:21.320 - 00:30:27.282, Speaker A: Do you have any preference? Is that more bullish? What if someone like CZ buys it? Binance buys CoinDesk. How would that make you feel?
00:30:27.336 - 00:30:28.818, Speaker B: That would be not great.
00:30:28.904 - 00:30:29.298, Speaker A: Okay.
00:30:29.384 - 00:30:32.838, Speaker B: How about I would like that to keep that in the States, please.
00:30:32.924 - 00:30:34.966, Speaker A: Bloomberg buys CoinDesk. What do you think?
00:30:34.988 - 00:30:37.110, Speaker B: That'd be great. That'd be awesome. Okay, awesome.
00:30:37.180 - 00:30:40.650, Speaker A: How about blockworks group buys CoinDesk?
00:30:41.390 - 00:30:45.930, Speaker B: That would be Chad as fuck. That'd be so Chad.
00:30:47.950 - 00:30:51.926, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see what happens. But fire sell of assets, right?
00:30:51.968 - 00:31:22.902, Speaker B: In order to the unbundling of DCG, they're basically probably going to sell everything except for grayscale, because grayscale is the cash cow. There's like a whole conversation there about how they just jettisoned Genesis. Three Arrows capital. Genesis let Three Arrows Capital Do the Grayscale Trade. And it was the facilitating mechanism to put a bunch of TVL into grayscale, which is the CASCAL for basically all of DCG. And now they're just selling the wreckage. Yeah, there's a bunch of bad takes, negative takes about that.
00:31:22.956 - 00:31:32.498, Speaker A: Also, DCG has a pretty strong venture arm too, with a lot of assets that have appreciated massively in value. And you wonder if some of that's going to be up for auction as well.
00:31:32.684 - 00:31:44.586, Speaker B: Before we move on, there's some irony here to pull out. So CoinDesk is for sale, right? Because the parent company, DCG, is underwater because of the Genesis insolvency, because of.
00:31:44.608 - 00:31:47.930, Speaker A: The are you going to say they broke the original story of FTX?
00:31:48.090 - 00:32:26.506, Speaker B: So CoinDesk broke the original story of FTX about the Alameda balance sheet, which caused CZ to Tweet about that, which caused the FTT to dump, which caused Alameda to get liquidated, which caused the insolvency of FTX, which created and that was also triggered by three errors, capital all of this contagion. This is what contagion is. And so at the end of this loop of contagion is Genesis going under, which is a DCG product, which that whole thing got pin pricked by another DCG product. So CoinDesk pricked the bubble that ultimately led to the unbundling and sale of their parent company.
00:32:26.608 - 00:32:29.686, Speaker A: What are you going to do, though? It's just good reporting. Good job for coin.
00:32:29.718 - 00:32:34.766, Speaker B: Honestly. Like, great job. Great. Well done, CoinDesk. Wait, that is just good journalism. Well done.
00:32:34.788 - 00:32:35.966, Speaker A: But also, we're sorry.
00:32:36.068 - 00:32:37.840, Speaker B: Yeah. And sorry about that one. Yeah.
00:32:38.290 - 00:32:41.680, Speaker A: It's not your fault, but not your fault. The right thing for crypto. Thank you.
00:32:42.690 - 00:32:44.538, Speaker B: Dude, it's industry.
00:32:44.714 - 00:33:11.974, Speaker A: It's crazy, right? Look, I think in some ways every industry is like this, except just crypto is like every other industry, but more so. And it's more open. And the debates and things happen on Twitter and yeah, it's very open. Speaking of open and crazy, there was a massive threat, almost gave crypto a heart attack earlier this week because it seemed like a bunch of government organizations were bandning together to announce something.
00:33:12.092 - 00:33:30.160, Speaker B: It was like started like, simmering throughout cryptosphere. So here's a tweet update. Not only is the DOJ announcing at 12:00 P.m. Eastern, there's rumors of an announcement came out of the DOJ, but they will be joined by the FBI, the US treasury OFAC and the state of New York. Wow.
00:33:31.090 - 00:33:32.942, Speaker A: This happened Wednesday morning.
00:33:32.996 - 00:33:49.734, Speaker B: Wednesday morning, yeah. So rumors got circulated that the DOJ was going after an exchange that started with the letter B. I don't know how that letter B rumor got out there, but it definitely did. Here's another tweet. One of my good friends told me, the DOJ will sue Binance this year and the fine will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
00:33:49.852 - 00:33:51.974, Speaker A: Oh God, this guy's good friend.
00:33:52.092 - 00:34:14.702, Speaker B: Oh, good friend. Sources. All right, let's keep on going. The fear just, like, hit all time highs. And so here is a press release out of the Department of Justice Media Advisory Department. Attorney General Lisa Manako will lead a press conference to announce a major international cryptocurrency enforcement action. The US Department of the treasury will announce an action in the space.
00:34:14.702 - 00:34:17.470, Speaker B: TV coverage will be provided by the network pool.
00:34:19.490 - 00:34:33.394, Speaker A: There was so much speculation on crypto Twitter that morning, I couldn't even keep up with it. Some people were talking about validating. Anyone who wasn't OFAC compliant and a validator would basically be net banned in the US.
00:34:33.592 - 00:34:36.674, Speaker B: There was talk of this fear off the charts. Oh, yeah.
00:34:36.712 - 00:34:44.066, Speaker A: There was talk of every major crypto company you can imagine could have been a target for this super scary.
00:34:44.098 - 00:34:50.778, Speaker B: And honestly, every single one of my discords and telegrams that I blowing up were all like, oh God, what's it.
00:34:50.784 - 00:34:52.266, Speaker A: Going to get ready 12:00 P.m.. All.
00:34:52.288 - 00:34:53.114, Speaker B: Right, so what was it?
00:34:53.152 - 00:34:54.460, Speaker A: What did it end up being?
00:34:56.590 - 00:35:06.286, Speaker B: Crypto exchange bitlazo. The founder was arrested and was charged by do you even know what this exchange is?
00:35:06.468 - 00:35:07.626, Speaker A: Bits Lotto.
00:35:07.738 - 00:35:08.746, Speaker B: Bits Lotto.
00:35:08.858 - 00:35:09.918, Speaker A: Is that how you say this?
00:35:10.004 - 00:35:12.730, Speaker B: I have no clue. I have no clue.
00:35:12.810 - 00:35:16.446, Speaker A: That was the big B that they were going after, wasn't finance.
00:35:16.558 - 00:35:36.962, Speaker B: I don't even know, man. Okay, so this is a Russian founder of a centralized exchange bits Lotto, for laundering and crypto asset crimes, I think allegedly laundered more than 700 million funds. The founder, Anatoli Legadomov, was arrested in Miami.
00:35:37.026 - 00:35:40.410, Speaker A: This is it. This is it. This is the big announcement.
00:35:41.070 - 00:35:42.762, Speaker B: I had never heard of this exchange before.
00:35:42.816 - 00:35:47.110, Speaker A: I have never either. This is somebody named Haley Lenon.
00:35:47.190 - 00:35:48.250, Speaker B: She's a lawyer. Yeah.
00:35:48.320 - 00:35:56.110, Speaker A: She says. Dog enforcement action against Russian exchange bits lotto. I've worked in the space since 2013. Never heard of it.
00:35:56.180 - 00:35:57.198, Speaker B: Never heard of it.
00:35:57.284 - 00:36:00.554, Speaker A: Honestly, never heard of this exchange. Who knows?
00:36:00.602 - 00:36:13.358, Speaker B: So this showed up in the chart. So this is what caused ether to go from one $600 down to, like, 1490. And then this news came out, and it just pumped right back up to, like, 1550, and we're like, I don't care. I don't care about bits. Lotto.
00:36:13.454 - 00:36:20.118, Speaker A: So, of course, you got to appreciate the Memes coming out about this, the sense of the relief, of course. But this classic meme. What are we looking at?
00:36:20.204 - 00:36:23.766, Speaker B: This is the army man protecting the sleeping child.
00:36:23.948 - 00:36:25.186, Speaker A: Knives and missiles.
00:36:25.298 - 00:36:34.810, Speaker B: And so we got Celsius Voyager BlockFi knives and grenades is raining down on this child, where the Department of justice is protecting the child from a feather. That feather is bit slotto.
00:36:35.470 - 00:36:37.594, Speaker A: This is another one. I love this.
00:36:37.792 - 00:36:54.402, Speaker B: This is a picture of the police drug bust. And there's three police officers at the end of a drug bust. And the drug serious drug bus is a single marijuana pipe. A marijuana pipe that there's, like, five stores around me in New York that I could buy.
00:36:54.456 - 00:37:21.386, Speaker A: This is funny. Do you think that okay? So with the Know announcing going after Gemini and Genesis and then also the DOJ coming up with this announcement, do you think that this is all sort of PR of these government agencies to be just like, look, we're doing things and we're doing things fast in crypto, see, we're doing something right. And so they're just picking the kind of the lowest hanging fruit they can find and making a much bigger deal out of this.
00:37:21.488 - 00:37:22.330, Speaker B: Because they can.
00:37:22.400 - 00:37:31.674, Speaker A: Yeah, because they can. It just seems like sort of a theater type game. It's not actually protecting retail. It's not actually helping us moving this industry forward.
00:37:31.792 - 00:37:33.502, Speaker B: It's not actually doing their jobs. Yeah.
00:37:33.556 - 00:37:35.406, Speaker A: They're hoping maybe to score some points.
00:37:35.508 - 00:38:06.342, Speaker B: With I think crypto natives that are listening to this podcast probably need to put themselves in the shoes of their parents, their cousins, I don't know. And they're going to read the headline. The DOJ charges Crypto Exchange for $700 million of money laundering. And the guy's now going to jail and they're probably going to be like, nice job, DOJ. Well done. And then they're going to hear about like, finally, FTX Genesis, Gemini earn customers insolvent SEC charge them and they're like, nice job. Yeah, nice.
00:38:06.342 - 00:38:12.714, Speaker B: Well done, government. Like that's what my exactly what it is. And they don't know the difference. They don't know how much of an absolute farce this is.
00:38:12.752 - 00:38:16.874, Speaker A: They may have never even heard of binance, for example. And so they can't tell you the difference.
00:38:16.912 - 00:38:22.538, Speaker B: The difference between the words binance and bits lotto is not a lot to an outside.
00:38:22.624 - 00:38:33.726, Speaker A: You're absolutely right. That's exactly what's going on. And actually, Theo asked in the bankless discord this week, does this change anything? So what's your answer to that? The bits lotto news? Does it change anything?
00:38:33.908 - 00:38:41.746, Speaker B: I mean, what even is it? This isn't even a thing. So nothing's changing because this isn't even a thing. This is a nothing burger, I think.
00:38:41.768 - 00:39:05.818, Speaker A: So it changes nothing fundamentally. I think what we might see is more of the trend of more agencies coming out with kind of these theatrical performances of who they're going to kind of go after next. And I don't anticipate anything useful coming out of that for investors in retail and crypto anyway, that's what's going on right now. But we're not done yet. We got a lot more to cover. David, what's coming up next?
00:39:05.904 - 00:39:17.418, Speaker B: There's even more. So the Three Arrows Capital founders, Ryan would like you to give them money for their brand new venture called GTX.
00:39:17.594 - 00:39:18.030, Speaker A: Wow.
00:39:18.100 - 00:39:44.630, Speaker B: So we are going to talk about this amazing investment opportunity that you must invest in right now. We'll talk about the details, of course I'm joking. Do not do that. And then also I want you, bankless listener, to guess. Put a number in your head, how many members, individual members of Congress received political donations from SBF and FTX. Think of a number because we'll talk about that number as soon as we give it back from some of these fantastic sponsors to help you. Go.
00:39:44.630 - 00:40:20.482, Speaker B: Bankless. Uniswap is the largest on chain marketplace for self custody digital assets. Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange, but you know this because you've been listening to Bankless. But did you know that the Uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat onramp? Now, you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in DFI inside of Uniswap. Not only that, but polygon Arbitrum and optimism L2s are supported right out of the gate. But that's just DFI. Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, letting you find more listings for the best prices across the NFT world.
00:40:20.482 - 00:40:56.714, Speaker B: With Uniswap, you can sweep floors on multiple NFTs and Uniswap's universal router will optimize your gas fees for you. Uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across Ethereum. And we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor.

Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems.
00:40:56.714 - 00:41:37.338, Speaker B: With a recent addition of Arbitrum, nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home. Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees.

00:41:37.504 - 00:41:43.214, Speaker A: Suzu and Kyle Davies, formerly of Three Arrows Capital, have an investment opportunity they'd like you to consider.
00:41:43.332 - 00:41:45.674, Speaker B: Oh, boy. I'm so excited.
00:41:45.802 - 00:41:55.330, Speaker A: Get this, David. They are raising $25 million for a new crypto exchange and they're calling this GTX.
00:41:56.310 - 00:42:16.210, Speaker B: Why they are calling it GTX, I don't know. No, the answer, Ryan, is because this is the actual, real answer. I am not making this up. This is not a joke. The reason why they are calling it GTX is because G comes after F. That is literally a slide in their pitch deck. After FTX comes GTX.
00:42:16.290 - 00:42:21.970, Speaker A: It reminds me of their classic artwork purchase of art blocks right at the top. It looks like a goose.
00:42:22.050 - 00:42:23.398, Speaker B: It looks like we like the goose.
00:42:23.494 - 00:42:25.002, Speaker A: We like the goose. Do you remember this?
00:42:25.056 - 00:42:25.660, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:26.670 - 00:42:29.082, Speaker A: How is anybody considering investing in this thing?
00:42:29.136 - 00:42:42.698, Speaker B: So this isn't actually just a normal crypto exchange. This is an exchange that is meant to be able to trade claims. So celsius claims. FTX claims. Genesis claims three arrows.
00:42:42.714 - 00:42:43.530, Speaker A: Capital claims.
00:42:43.610 - 00:42:55.282, Speaker B: Yeah, probably. I mean, that is not specifically in the deck, but you can only imagine that they are trying to create an exchange to trade claims on all of the insolvent companies of 2022.
00:42:55.336 - 00:43:00.120, Speaker A: I'm getting suddenly very bullish because who has better experience with insolvent companies right.
00:43:02.410 - 00:43:05.942, Speaker B: On demand for this stupid exchange that they're trying to make?
00:43:06.076 - 00:43:14.150, Speaker A: You got to build what you know. Come on, David. This is actually pretty bullish. I didn't know that. So it's for distressed assets specifically.
00:43:14.230 - 00:43:50.022, Speaker B: It is for claims on future rewards of whatever people would get. And so the idea is that FTX imploded, leaving more than 1 million creditors out of pocket. And so here's the total addressable. Market the 1 million creditors of 2022 crypto. The exchange offers depositors the ability to transfer their FTX claims to GTX and receive immediate credit. In a token called USDG, the pitch deck says, so we're back to printing funny money. And that's the deal, man.
00:43:50.022 - 00:43:54.578, Speaker B: Like, if you have a claim, you can go to GTX and get your FTX claimed.
00:43:54.674 - 00:44:02.380, Speaker A: Here's someone who's actually seen some of the slides giving commentary on it. Garlam, thanks for finding this.
00:44:05.150 - 00:44:17.374, Speaker B: I just love their numbers. They're getting from 1 million crypto creditors that are owed money, plus the $2 billion of collective insolvency as a result of 2022. We know the address.
00:44:17.492 - 00:44:32.270, Speaker A: Audacity of this. The audacity of this pitch deck. Okay, let's go on our roadmap. What's the roadmap looking like? Oh, you first. Look, it's a multi step roadmap. So they're just starting with claims.
00:44:32.350 - 00:44:33.140, Speaker B: Of course.
00:44:33.670 - 00:44:35.646, Speaker A: After that, there's another circle, which is crypto.
00:44:35.678 - 00:44:44.322, Speaker B: They're just starting with FTX claims and then three errors. Capital claims come on the market, and then they can sell more shitcoins.
00:44:44.386 - 00:44:52.380, Speaker A: Yeah. And then they go into stocks and trading and they become bigger than Robinhood. And then they go into FX markets and know easy.
00:44:53.310 - 00:44:54.790, Speaker B: How much are you investing, Ryan?
00:44:54.950 - 00:44:56.026, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:44:56.208 - 00:44:57.994, Speaker B: I'm in for half my net worth.
00:44:58.192 - 00:45:00.700, Speaker A: I can't believe anyone is investing in this.
00:45:01.310 - 00:45:11.950, Speaker B: The thing is, like, the ODS that it works are decently above zero for at least them to get liquidity and being able to exit and start leverage trading bitcoin again.
00:45:12.100 - 00:45:18.820, Speaker A: Do you know what? If there was another team launching this, it could actually be somewhat interesting to you.
00:45:19.830 - 00:45:32.406, Speaker B: Again, to your point, they know that market. And so if you think that this is a viable product, they are actually kind of the right people from the job. I hate to say it.
00:45:32.508 - 00:45:40.370, Speaker A: Why anyone would give these guys money after this is beyond me. But look, people think they can just come back from massive scams in crypto.
00:45:40.450 - 00:45:42.278, Speaker B: Well, I don't know if they have any other choice.
00:45:42.374 - 00:45:47.500, Speaker A: This is still what I believe SBF is trying to do. It's kind of a comeback story.
00:45:47.950 - 00:45:50.202, Speaker B: New SBF articles dropped this week. We'll talk about that.
00:45:50.256 - 00:45:59.722, Speaker A: We'll talk about that, too. All right, let's move on. Ethereum. Good news here. Hits 500,000 validators ahead of the scheduled Shanghai upgrade. That's a lot of validators, David.
00:45:59.786 - 00:46:09.758, Speaker B: Half a million validators. Of course, multiply that by that number by 32 and you have the amount of Ether deposited into the beacon chain. So congrats to the beacon chain for half a million validators.
00:46:09.854 - 00:46:20.110, Speaker A: I got good news for you, too, David. The devs are still here. There are now 23,000 monthly active developers in crypto. And if you look at this chart here, I'm going to zoom in a little bit.
00:46:20.200 - 00:46:32.534, Speaker B: This is coming from a report out of Electric Capital. And I remember I think they do this report every single year. So this is not just some random report from some this is a great report. Link in the show notes to definitely go and dive deeper.
00:46:32.582 - 00:46:34.330, Speaker A: They're scanning all the public GitHub.
00:46:34.750 - 00:46:36.154, Speaker B: This is a thorough report.
00:46:36.272 - 00:47:02.500, Speaker A: Yeah. And basically it has doubled from 2020. But what's interesting here is, do you see that flatline? Like, big price appreciation, whole bunch of developers come into crypto in 2017, the end of 2018, and then it flattens out again. We're at the leveling out phase 2022, where we're not going to go down very much, but we're probably going to keep pace with the amount of developers we have. We'll build price, appreciates whole new crop. It's like a cycle. This happens over and over.
00:47:03.670 - 00:47:35.086, Speaker B: You can just see the accumulation period. So, like, in 2017, developers go from, like it does a 100 X, and then prices go down 95% while the developers get head down busy for like 18 months, and then they create the next bull market. And now we're back into that accumulation phase. I remember seeing numbers like this in 2018, and it was one of the big reasons, like, okay, I'm not crazy. Even though my bags are down 95%, my net worth is basically at zero. All the developers are still here. So something's happening.
00:47:35.086 - 00:47:41.146, Speaker B: And you'll notice that this chart never goes down. Developers are always up, only in crypto.
00:47:41.258 - 00:47:53.620, Speaker A: Chris Dixon calls this the innovation cycle. If you want to Google that, you can read an article about this very effect. This is why we say sometimes crypto investing is not hard. Look at this. It's telling the story.
00:47:54.870 - 00:48:10.658, Speaker B: The area under the curve of that chart is also the rate of progress of crypto, which is why I'm so bullish on this particular bull market or bear market versus last is because the area under the curve, bigger magnitude of building happening is the most it's ever been in crypto, ever.
00:48:10.844 - 00:48:21.770, Speaker A: 100% cool news from Arbitrum. The Norwegian government is testing a cap table platform on Ethereum using Arbitrum. Layer two scaling. I know you've explored this a little bit, but what are they doing?
00:48:21.840 - 00:49:00.150, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is a Norwegian government has announced the development of Brock. Brock I don't know how to norwegian? Yeah, Norwegian O with a line through it, the Viking language. And so there is a bunch of just like, private shareholder cap table information for unlisted companies, companies that are not publicly trading. But the Norwegian government's Brock platform allows these companies to manage their cap table on Arbitrum. And so it's a cap table management for not yet public companies, just to help them make the process more faster, more efficient, more secure. This is a great use of a blockchain 100%.
00:49:00.220 - 00:49:09.626, Speaker A: We have a global permissionless settlement layer that anyone can program against. Why wouldn't you want to put stocks on this thing? Of course, the New York Stock Exchange is never going to do it.
00:49:09.648 - 00:49:09.834, Speaker B: Why?
00:49:09.872 - 00:49:15.454, Speaker A: Because they're the incumbent. But Norway is happy to say, oh, look at this technology, it's promising. Let's check that out.
00:49:15.572 - 00:49:29.282, Speaker B: Moving on to some other big news. MetaMask enables staking. Right from the MetaMask wallet, you can now deposit your ether straight into lido or rocket pool straight through the MetaMask UI. They also report the APIs that each.
00:49:29.336 - 00:49:38.630, Speaker A: Of these protocols give you nice, decentralized staking as well, rocket pool is a much more decentralized option than going to your local exchange. Pretty cool to see this.
00:49:38.700 - 00:49:49.240, Speaker B: Also shout out to all the rocket pool homies. Rocket pool RPL got listed on Finance this week. Immediately jumped like 25%. Yes, retraced a little bit, but coinbase too.
00:49:49.690 - 00:50:00.118, Speaker A: What's this about an NFT World? You wanted to highlight this discord message? This is from Mullet, one of my favorite crypto punk NFTs discord screenshot. This was in 2017.
00:50:00.294 - 00:50:23.714, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is the CryptoPunk discord. Of course. This account named Cyborg says, in the discord, I'm about to do something either extremely stupid or wonderfully smart. Wish me luck. And then, not just a few moments later, the crypto punk bot that reports all the sales shows up and goes, a zombie punk was sold for a whopping 1.89 Ether for $564.
00:50:23.714 - 00:50:45.466, Speaker B: And some other person in the discord goes, Whoa. Because that was a big sale for a JPEG. For a JPEG. $560 for a JPEG who's spending this much money in 2017 on JPEGs. Of course, that zombie punk is probably worth 1000 times more in Ether terms. And yeah, can I just shout out.
00:50:45.488 - 00:51:15.170, Speaker A: The value of being contrarian? Right? Ben from our team dug this tweet out. It was from an old archive as we're migrating from substac to our new website. It was like surfacing all of these old articles. This was a tweet from 2019 where I said, ten X investors know it's not enough to be contrarian. It's not enough to be right. You have to be contrarian, right? ETH is contrarian now, even in crypto circles, I think it's contrarian, right? We'll see. This was like depth of the bear Market, where ETH was ether was real bad.
00:51:15.170 - 00:51:16.286, Speaker A: 2019.
00:51:16.398 - 00:51:24.326, Speaker B: The only people talking about ETH were you, me, Anthony Zano, DC Investor, eric Connor, Cyrus Unessi, like a few other.
00:51:24.348 - 00:51:42.806, Speaker A: People, pretty small group. It was a contrarian bet. It was always like, yeah, bitcoin might come back and probably will come back. And I mean, a contrarian bet in crypto circles, but so this is also the key. Similar to punks, right? A lot of people make contrarian bets. A lot of those contrarian bets are contrarian wrong.
00:51:42.928 - 00:51:45.674, Speaker B: Yeah. They're contrarian for good reasons, not bad reasons.
00:51:45.722 - 00:52:08.966, Speaker A: Yeah. And then most people make bets that aren't contrarian. And so you have sort of average performance and average returns on those sorts of bets. The thing you want to find in crypto is the contrarian right bets. Because that's what gives you kind of the ten X returns and the 30 X returns and the 50 X returns. And this, of course, ETH is up even now in the bear market. Ten X from the time this tweet, this tweet, ETH was floating at 170.
00:52:08.966 - 00:52:12.198, Speaker A: And we're ten X from that.
00:52:12.284 - 00:52:23.546, Speaker B: I'll say that the last time I felt that Ether was contrarian was like in the second half of 2021, when it was Salana Avalanche Luna season. That's when I felt like ethereum was.
00:52:23.648 - 00:52:42.110, Speaker A: Contrarian locally on a relative basis, for sure. Yeah, it could be contrarian price to other assets as well. David, we got to answer that question about how many members of Congress got cash from Sam Begman Freed. What is the answer to that question?
00:52:42.260 - 00:52:59.910, Speaker B: One in three, I guess. The article that you're looking at is not showing up. But one in three members of Congress, which comes out to 196 US lawmakers took direct contributions from FTX and other FTX executives. 196.
00:52:59.980 - 00:53:18.650, Speaker A: I told my wife this and she was like, blown away. Yeah, that's a third. A third. And now they're trying to unwind all of that. But FTX was just everywhere, and Sam Bankman Fried was just everywhere trying to trying to infect our government bodies in the United States of America. It's pretty scary, actually.
00:53:18.720 - 00:53:42.740, Speaker B: Yeah, the cancer was definitely spreading. And cancer is really the way to explain how that corruption is. It was corruption. Yeah, exactly. A line from this article was that most of the politicians who responded to questions from CoinDesk said that they handed it over to charities to remove the taint of contributions. Can you give it back to the customers? Why didn't you do that?
00:53:43.590 - 00:53:44.366, Speaker A: It's messy.
00:53:44.398 - 00:53:46.910, Speaker B: I guess you just gave customer money to charity.
00:53:46.990 - 00:53:54.162, Speaker A: I would also love to see what the charities were. That would be nice if that was foundation. It could be like air quotes charities, who knows?
00:53:54.226 - 00:53:54.840, Speaker B: Right?
00:53:55.370 - 00:54:10.538, Speaker A: This is interesting. Digital Dollar Project warns on the US's cautious approach to CDBCs I think you have a take. This is a white paper that a project called the Digital Dollar Project came out with. And what's the TLDR of this white paper?
00:54:10.704 - 00:54:47.862, Speaker B: I think the subtext is that the Chinese CBDC has been moving ahead, full seam ahead for years now with real progress. Meanwhile, you and I have made fun of whatever like banking, senate Finance, banking, whoever. The Federal Reserve doing research reports about perhaps doing a digital currency for the United States. So this digital dollar project says hey, guys, do something. Do something. And so they call the US's approach to CBDCs an unsustainable position. And they are advocating for either doing a CBTC or allowing the stablecoin market to be that.
00:54:47.862 - 00:54:59.494, Speaker B: It's like pick one and make forward progress in one of these two directions. But the current situation is unsustainable, which is something we've been trying to say on the weekly roll up since I think Bankless was incepted.
00:54:59.542 - 00:55:22.686, Speaker A: This is an idea that's been around in business circles for a long time from Christensen, which is kind of the idea that the incumbent always gets disrupted because they're on top. They don't think they have to innovate. Of course. Jerome Powell and the dollar is on top. It is the world's reserve currency. They don't think they have to do anything new. But competitors are nipping at their heels and they're out innovating.
00:55:22.686 - 00:55:25.198, Speaker A: And this is one key way they're out innovating.
00:55:25.294 - 00:55:33.558, Speaker B: Interestingly. The digital dollar project Ryan, is actually led by Chris Giancarlo, who we've had on the podcast, a former member of the CFTC. So the guy knows a thing or two.
00:55:33.644 - 00:55:40.554, Speaker A: Yeah, he was the head of the CFTC commissioner, also crypto dad. I got his book sitting right back there. Good book?
00:55:40.592 - 00:55:41.386, Speaker B: Yeah, great guy.
00:55:41.488 - 00:55:44.806, Speaker A: SBF new post on substack. This guy is now a blogger. What's?
00:55:44.838 - 00:55:56.762, Speaker B: He his weekly reminder that FTX US is totally solvent and always has been. Just yet another excel math blog post from SPF.
00:55:56.826 - 00:56:00.142, Speaker A: Not validated, just you do not need to read this.
00:56:00.276 - 00:56:08.130, Speaker B: Don't waste your time. But this is just your semi regular reminder that Sam Bankman Fried thinks that FTX US is totally solvent. And you should too.
00:56:08.200 - 00:56:18.370, Speaker A: Do you know what? I still got him on notifications. I need to stop him from all of the craziness in November. But yeah, I'm just sick of it. I'm sick of hearing from SBF. But he's still posting.
00:56:18.450 - 00:56:19.670, Speaker B: He's still posting.
00:56:20.650 - 00:56:40.874, Speaker A: This is some legislation in the EU. It's called mica. All right, this is sweeping European Union crypto legislation. And David, I think we really need to dive in on this legislation on Bankless because it's actually happening now. It's been delayed. That's the news this week. It's been delayed until April, which gives EU crypto firms some breathing room.
00:56:40.874 - 00:57:05.282, Speaker A: But David, we are having a panel with some experts on Mica. It's happening in the next couple of weeks so that we can get know we're based in the US, obviously. And so we often we just see that's the information that comes closest to us and affects us, that we understand. I think we want to dive into Micah and fully understand that. So that is coming down the pike. I've heard that Micah is so so.
00:57:05.416 - 00:57:08.434, Speaker B: Some good, some bad, some wins, some losses.
00:57:08.482 - 00:57:20.150, Speaker A: Yeah, not absolutely terrible for crypto, but also not great. So we'll dive into that in the next couple of weeks and just word that that's actually been delayed until April. So some more breathing room there.
00:57:20.220 - 00:57:40.026, Speaker B: Got a handful of releases to talk about. One inch, the decked aggregator, which is across many, many networks, is coming in into the world of hardware wallets. So little turn of development. Here a cool Spiffy new hardware wallet expected to go on sale later this year. No buttons. It's a touch screen. It's one of those e ink grayscale touch displays.
00:57:40.026 - 00:58:07.126, Speaker B: The whole entire thing looks like a screen. So 2.7 inch screen, touchscreen, no buttons, grayscale screen, looks kind of like a size of a credit card, ish cool. 1inchh coming into the hardware world of hardware wallets. Also coming out is this thing called Den, which is something that's built on top of Gnosis safe. And so I think what this really is, is just like a UX layer on top of Gnosisafe, which can be kind of clunky if you're not used to it. But Den is.
00:58:07.126 - 00:58:41.474, Speaker B: A brand new way to access Gnosisafe. They are working with over 180 teams, they said, and secured over $80 million. And so a new layer on top of Den and also coming out of an integration between Mean finance and Aztec. Mean as in the average, not mean as in the emotion, but average mean finance. This was actually raised in the bankless nation discord because somebody was asking for a way to do on chain dollar cost averaging. That is the simple way to explain what mean of finance is. If you have stablecoins or assets and you just want to have this system, do auto DCA for you, mean Finance is where it's at.
00:58:41.474 - 00:59:02.726, Speaker B: They are doing a connection integration with Aztec network. Aztec is a zero knowledge roll up. It's actually a zero knowledge, zero knowledge roll up. So one layer of zero knowledge recursions, that's how they get extra scale. And also privacy, which has let Mean finance do some extra cool new features like flexible swap periods, privacy, gasless trading.
00:59:02.758 - 00:59:05.126, Speaker A: And actual private DFI.
00:59:05.238 - 00:59:06.006, Speaker B: Private DFI.
00:59:06.038 - 00:59:09.690, Speaker A: Private DFI money market. Pretty cool here.
00:59:09.840 - 00:59:12.406, Speaker B: So cool new stuff to try out in the world of Ethereum.
00:59:12.438 - 00:59:29.646, Speaker A: We also have some raises this week, David, a few that are notable. The first is Diva discloses a $3.1 million seed investment. This is another $3.5 million seed investment. This is another distributed liquid staking protocol. So up there, try to compete with lido and rocket pool.
00:59:29.646 - 00:59:37.250, Speaker A: And just note, David and I are angel investors in this one. Very supportive of decentralized staking protocols.
00:59:38.150 - 01:00:10.538, Speaker B: This one's unique, though, in that it is coming with DVT right out of the gate. This is what really attracted me to it, is like they were emphasizing distributed validator technology right out of the gate. And so what is distributed validator technology? It's you and a bunch of buddies can come together and create a virtual node with all of your computers that make sure that the node is always online without any risk of redundant signing. So that's why I really like that one. Obel Labs. Obel raised $12.5 million in a Series A led by Pantera.
01:00:10.538 - 01:00:35.430, Speaker B: Obel is the pioneer of DVT, so Diva is using DVT. Obel has been pioneering DVD for many, many protocols to use. I guess this is a DVT raise week this week, but Obel is just announcing their Series A for raise. $12.5 million, undisclosed valuation. But also disclaimer, ryan and I are also investors in Obel Labs in their seed round because, again, DVT gets me hot and bothered.
01:00:36.170 - 01:00:53.946, Speaker A: Also on the raise list this week, flashbots is seeking a $50 million investment at a billion dollar valuation. That's a pretty steep valuation for the bear market. But Flashbots is just I mean, they pretty much own the mev market share on Ethereum right now. And maybe it's worth that to some investors.
01:00:54.058 - 01:01:02.830, Speaker B: Yeah, plus there's a bunch of just absolute gigabrains at Flashbots. So it's definitely some exposure to some frontier level thinkers.
01:01:04.070 - 01:01:10.254, Speaker A: Last one, David. This is a sleep to earn protocol called Sleep Agotchi.
01:01:10.302 - 01:01:12.286, Speaker B: Collect sleep agotchi for your sleep.
01:01:12.398 - 01:01:14.802, Speaker A: Do you get paid while you sleep? Is this the idea?
01:01:14.936 - 01:01:34.054, Speaker B: I don't know. The title here is 3.5 Seed round to continue building a mobile application with gamification to improve sleep health. Social elements and gamification for sleep health. I think the sleep to earn is not the official branding, but that is what is kind of what you get when you read through the lines.
01:01:34.182 - 01:01:34.886, Speaker A: Sleep to earn.
01:01:34.918 - 01:01:35.850, Speaker B: Sleep to earn.
01:01:36.350 - 01:01:41.600, Speaker A: Whatever happened to just work to earn? Remember those days? I don't know why we need a ponzi game for every single thing.
01:01:44.530 - 01:02:06.366, Speaker B: When I do get good sleep, I feel rewarded because of how good that that feels. To add money on top of that. But hey, if you can sleep better yeah. Turn all of my behaviors into financial assets. Win coffee to earn. If you are doing a coffee to earn investment, I want you to DM me. We'll talk about that every single weekly.
01:02:06.366 - 01:02:08.226, Speaker B: Roll up coffee, drink your coffee to.
01:02:08.248 - 01:02:10.062, Speaker A: Earn and get coffee reward points.
01:02:10.136 - 01:02:10.706, Speaker B: Coffee gotcha.
01:02:10.738 - 01:02:12.306, Speaker A: The more we talk about it, Ryan.
01:02:12.338 - 01:02:14.386, Speaker B: I've got a new venture. I might go explore.
01:02:14.418 - 01:02:33.954, Speaker A: All we need is Suzu and Kyle Davies to be leads in this. Also, we have some questions from the nation coming up. David, we also have a meetup coming up at ETH Denver. So ETH Denver happens in February and there is going to be a meetup of the Bankless Nation. So what's going to be happening at this event and who can attend?
01:02:34.022 - 01:03:00.086, Speaker B: Yeah, so we got a nice little brewery that we've reserved for 3 hours, four to seven on a day that is disclosed inside of the Bankless Nation Discord. So again, if you are a Bankless Nation citizen, there are details in the Bankless Nation Discord for our meetup. Free beer. Free beer, yeah. And there's going to be a stage. We're going to figure out how to do some sort of show, maybe A-Q-A session, I don't really know. But beer and content.
01:03:00.086 - 01:03:15.690, Speaker B: Beer and content. Who doesn't like live content? Yeah. So if you are a member of the Bankless Nation, definitely don't miss that. If you want to go and if you're going to go to Eat Denver, definitely come hang out with us because we're going to all hang out in real life and drink beer. David's going to get david's going to get loose.
01:03:17.470 - 01:03:28.846, Speaker A: This will not be recorded. Then we know that for, you know, unrecorded cut. All right, question from the nation. David, we got a few. What's the first one here? Who are we looking at? Yeah.
01:03:28.868 - 01:04:02.118, Speaker B: This is Spartan Solutions. Of course. Who's got, I think, the best PFP inside of the Bankless Nation discord. I saw somewhere someone explaining that the ETH deflationary threshold isn't a set gas fee, but changes with the amount of validators there are on the network, is that correct? And that is correct. That is correct. And so I'm actually going to take this moment to show the article that's coming out next week. I haven't finished the title, but there are two charts in this title, in this article that will show you, if you keep on scrolling down, that will show you the actual issuance curve of ether.
01:04:02.118 - 01:04:29.150, Speaker B: And so this is the amount of ether that is issued versus the total amount of e staked on the horizontal axis. So when there is more ether staked, issuance goes up. And so the more ether that is staked to the network, the higher the gas fee it's needed to become ultrasound because there's more issuance. And so that is the answer. It's not a fixed number. As more ether is staked, more higher gas fees are needed in order to be net deflationary.
01:04:29.310 - 01:04:32.158, Speaker A: Interesting, these are good charts. Where'd you get these charts?
01:04:32.254 - 01:04:37.590, Speaker B: That is from Colin Myers, who is actually the founder of very cool.
01:04:37.660 - 01:05:09.086, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm looking forward to that post, David. I haven't read that yet. Here's another question from Luke Ethwalker. Why does Bankless measure whether ETH is deflationary asset against the supply that existed at the merge? He's right. We do do that. In fact, we just did that in the market section. Shouldn't we analyze whether it is deflationary in comparison to its peak supply? According to ultrasound money, peak supply happened on October 7, 2022, and ETH has been deflationary therefore and therefore, in my mind, an ultrasound asset since then.
01:05:09.086 - 01:05:31.254, Speaker A: So I think he's making the point that, hey, the entire last quarter, ETH has basically been deflationary. But whenever I see you guys talk about it, you're always pointing to this ultrasound money chart, which there's a dial on this where you can see, like, even this, this is since merge, ETH supply since merge. And that's what Luke ETH Walker is asking.
01:05:31.372 - 01:05:46.278, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is unpacking revealing. The dirty little secret of ultrasound money is that it's actually not clearly defined what it is. So ether has been ultrasound since depending like ether has been deflationary since the merge.
01:05:46.374 - 01:05:47.322, Speaker A: Yeah, you can pick a date.
01:05:47.376 - 01:06:32.146, Speaker B: You can pick a date. Right. And actually, this specific supply of ether at the day of the merge is just an arbitrary number that doesn't really mean anything. I think there's a number of different ways to define ultrasound. I think the correct way to define what ultrasound money is is the theoretically maximum amount of supply reduction that is safe for a crypto economic protocol, which is a mouthful of a definition. But even when ether inflates, as in when the supply is going up under that definition, it's still ultrasound because ether between the combination of EIP 1559 and proof of stake is the theoretically maximum amount of supply reduction that you could get in that environment, even though it is still inflating.
01:06:32.258 - 01:07:01.634, Speaker A: Well, I think you can measure on time periods, too, though. Right to his point. This is just arbitrarily ETH to supply. But at the beginning of the episode, we also talked about ETH supply in Q four of last year of 2022 and it was deflationary by negative zero zero 4%, actually. So in that time period it was deflationary. I think the ETH supply since the merge date will become less relevant over time. It still might be a factor, but still happen relatively quickly.
01:07:01.634 - 01:07:05.666, Speaker A: We might start looking at this on the monthly, quarterly and annual basis instead.
01:07:05.768 - 01:07:14.518, Speaker B: I think that's right. But yeah, the interaction between the words deflationary and ultrasound is like an unknown science that we're just kind of loosely talking about.
01:07:14.604 - 01:07:16.374, Speaker A: Oh, you're saying we're making this up as we go?
01:07:16.412 - 01:07:17.794, Speaker B: Absolutely, dude.
01:07:17.922 - 01:07:23.222, Speaker A: That's how all language and all memes work. Actually, at the basement level, breaking Bankless.
01:07:23.286 - 01:07:25.180, Speaker B: Is making it up as they go.
01:07:27.230 - 01:07:44.670, Speaker A: Here's another take from Necrosis, or a question rather. I see a lot of FUD about L two S being very centralized. How centralized are L2s and what are their plans to become more decentralized and trustless as they grow? This was asked in the Bankless discord, of course. What's your answer for Necrosis here?
01:07:44.740 - 01:08:11.014, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is a very good question. How centralized L2s are. It's not an easy thing to say in one sentence, but you are on the mark that L2s have various degrees of centralization. Many L2s are just a multisig. Arbitrum and optimism are just multi sigs. I believe that's true, but there are other things as well to increase the security of these things. And Vitalik actually at roll up day in Bogota.
01:08:11.014 - 01:08:44.142, Speaker B: Did a talk on this. And so, yes, to say L2 roll ups are decently centralized in their current form. Today we do have the path to uncentralize them, to decentralize them. And Vitalik talks about that in this video that I've linked timestamped the link in the show notes, if you want to get that question answered. The TLDR is there are multiple layers of redundancy that are able to be built where you could have a multi SIG, but you could also have the actual fraud proof. We're worried about fraud proofs and bugs. And so we need to have a multi SIG.
01:08:44.142 - 01:08:50.418, Speaker B: There's a bunch of nuances there. It's not enough to go into. But if you want to learn more about this topic, there is a Vitalik.
01:08:50.434 - 01:09:18.282, Speaker A: Talk in the show notes and L2 B is doing a great job kind of covering this. Right. They have sort of the level of centralization, the decentralization of each of these L2s. And I think the point that Vitalik is making in his presentation today is that almost all roll ups are still on training wheels. But the idea of training wheels is training wheels can be taken off and then it's a real bike, a real decentralized roll up. If you're a side chain, you're always going to have those training wheels.
01:09:18.346 - 01:09:19.070, Speaker B: Got them.
01:09:19.220 - 01:09:31.266, Speaker A: You are training wheels. You are training wheels or you're a tricycle. You're not even a bike. You're something else. So that is the point. And I don't know what the timeline on some of these things, but every.
01:09:31.288 - 01:09:34.142, Speaker B: Single L2 has got their own timeline. Yeah, they're all in race.
01:09:34.286 - 01:09:34.978, Speaker A: Exactly.
01:09:35.144 - 01:09:40.790, Speaker B: David love to fight about how far they are on the race, though. Let them fight about that.
01:09:40.860 - 01:10:05.270, Speaker A: More decentralization is better. David, let's get to some takes. Here's one from Ryan Selkis. He's talking about Gensler, our favorite, our star of this episode. Gensler attacked coinbase. He cozied up to SBF biggest fraud since Madoff, spit in the face of retail investors by rejecting Spot ETFs and spent more time finding bankrupt entities and kardashians than fixing problems. He's a crooked cop on the beat, not a public servant.
01:10:05.270 - 01:10:08.874, Speaker A: Ryan Selik always dropping the fire on Gensler.
01:10:08.922 - 01:10:09.342, Speaker B: Love it.
01:10:09.396 - 01:10:20.802, Speaker A: He's been doing it for a long time. I don't know. This is probably the most critical interpretation of what Gensler is doing, but David, I honestly check, dude, I can't say he's wrong about this.
01:10:20.856 - 01:10:40.274, Speaker B: Super, right? Yeah. I really wouldn't want to drive the point home. Gensler attacked coinbase. Coinbase had their own version of Gemini Earn, which was not going to get plugged into Genesis. It was going to be their own yield source. It was going to be native to them. And the SEC says, if you guys ship this product, we're going to sue you for selling on registered securities.
01:10:40.274 - 01:10:50.326, Speaker B: And then Coinbase was like, oh, scared. We're not going to offer that. And so we had the safe outcome. And the SEC was like, no, you can't have that. And then it's so dumb.
01:10:50.358 - 01:11:18.306, Speaker A: Dude, do you know that movie The Departed? Have you ever seen that with, like, Leonardo DiCaprio and everyone? Do you know how it's like there really were no good guys in that movie? It's like all the cops were bad, too. It's like not to say that Crypto doesn't have its share of bad guys and villains. It totally does. But that also doesn't mean all of the cops trying to kind of regulate this industry are good and doing the right thing. I think we have some bad guys in those circles as well. Here's another take. What's? This one from Voorhees?
01:11:18.418 - 01:11:39.494, Speaker B: Eric Voorhees says, wild west is not a term of disparagement, but the embracing of the frontier and a celebration of permissionless, individualism, god, all of those words just warm my soul. Warm my soul. So I gave this a retweet because I wanted to add this was hot on the heels of Gary Gensler calling Crypto a Wild West.
01:11:39.542 - 01:11:40.922, Speaker A: Right? Oh, he said that again?
01:11:40.976 - 01:12:10.934, Speaker B: Yeah, he says that Crypto is a wild west that needs to get reined in. So eric voorhees tweeted that. I retweeted Eric Voorhees and I say I'm in Crypto because it's the Wild West. That's why I'm here. Gary Gensler's labeling of crypto as a wild west that needs to be reined in is the same mindset that motivated frontiersmen to go west in the first place, to get free from tyranny and oppression. So, like, the irony here is that Gary Gensler's the dude that motivated people to go west in the first place. That's why we're doing this.
01:12:10.934 - 01:12:11.794, Speaker B: That's why we're doing bank.
01:12:11.842 - 01:12:14.434, Speaker A: It's the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're headed west.
01:12:14.482 - 01:12:17.494, Speaker B: That's everything definitely for me. It's definitely for me.
01:12:17.612 - 01:12:36.030, Speaker A: From inception. Yeah, I agree with that. Before he sees it, too, suzu had a take this week. I'm going to read out that take. Owning crypto in cold storage, when done properly, is one of the most anti fragile financial acts one can take. Trading crypto aggressively is one of the most fragile financial acts one can take. He would know.
01:12:36.030 - 01:12:43.818, Speaker A: I've learned the hard way, as many others have this past cycle. Stay humble and stack SATS, baby. Just stay humble and stack.
01:12:43.914 - 01:12:49.342, Speaker B: Stay humble. I mean, this is just a Suzu take that is celebrated.
01:12:49.406 - 01:12:50.226, Speaker A: Look at all these.
01:12:50.328 - 01:13:09.320, Speaker B: David yeah, yeah, okay. But the only reason why we're putting this take in here is because of a prediction that was made by Eric Wall, where Suzu and Kyle Davies miraculously become influential bitcoin maximalists. I did not expect this to happen this quickly, but this is that this is psyops works.
01:13:09.770 - 01:13:16.554, Speaker A: He's not wrong in this stake, but he's obviously playing an influential game. Why is anyone listening to this guy right now?
01:13:16.672 - 01:13:24.670, Speaker B: Well, bitcoiners are listening to them, to him, because he's saying the bitcoiner words. He's saying, stay humble, stack chat stats. And the bitcoiner is like, yeah, those are our words.
01:13:24.820 - 01:13:39.074, Speaker A: So if you say the thing the tribe wants you to in social media, the tribe will celebrate you no matter the reason that you're saying them or if you actually believe them. So then you can just manipulate the mob by saying things that the mob likes to hear. Is that what you're telling me?
01:13:39.112 - 01:13:39.810, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right.
01:13:39.880 - 01:13:40.734, Speaker A: Well, that really sucks.
01:13:40.782 - 01:13:43.426, Speaker B: David anyways, let's burn a bunch of ether, right?
01:13:43.448 - 01:14:10.394, Speaker A: Ryan I mean, like, jeez, if we reprob up these influencers again as influencers, we almost deserve it, don't we? This is your take. I'm going to read it out. Bitcoin will hit its supply cap in the year 21 40. That's when Issuance finally goes out, right? Yes. It approaches zero and it kind of hits zero, I guess, at that point. The ETH supply hit its cap last year. Wow.
01:14:10.394 - 01:14:15.310, Speaker A: Tell me about that. First of all. Justify that. Explain that one. How does that work?
01:14:15.380 - 01:14:53.482, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's a prediction, there's a claim being made here, but the bitcoin supply, we know the bitcoin supply curve around 21 40, it will stop issuing bitcoin and will be predominant. That's the year 21. In 120 years, roughly in 120 years, zero more bitcoin will be issued. And then I follow up and say the supply cap for ether hit its cap last year, which I'm claiming is like the supply of ether is down only because now we're ultrasound that in theory could not be true. We could technically stop having so much gas fees and then we would issue more. But I'm claiming that that's not going to happen. But I'm saying let's contrast these things.
01:14:53.482 - 01:15:00.846, Speaker B: Bitcoin supply stops inflating in the year 21 40 ether supply stopped inflating last year. That was my spicy take of the week.
01:15:00.948 - 01:15:10.960, Speaker A: Wow. You might be wrong a little bit on that in that maybe it peaks this year. But I think you'll be mostly right.
01:15:12.530 - 01:15:14.718, Speaker B: I'm placing money that I'm right.
01:15:14.804 - 01:15:22.526, Speaker A: And so that means about 120,000,000. What you're saying is ETH will never hit 121,000,000 in terms of supply.
01:15:22.638 - 01:15:33.430, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I mean, go up to the peak of Issuance right after the merge, like whatever that peak is. I'm saying the supply of ether will not be greater than 120,533,000, which is this peak which happened hit last year.
01:15:33.500 - 01:15:35.346, Speaker A: That's a very precise estimate.
01:15:35.378 - 01:15:49.866, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And I've got like 15,000 ether. Yeah, 15,000 ether of wiggle room. So we need to not issue 15,000 ether. And I will be right there you go. From this point, from this moment, tell.
01:15:49.888 - 01:15:51.950, Speaker A: Me what you're bullish on and it can't be ETH.
01:15:53.330 - 01:16:06.282, Speaker B: I'm bullish on an article about ether and so I've got an article that's going out a week from today, which is Thursday for Bankless listeners.
01:16:06.346 - 01:16:08.354, Speaker A: You're just teasing that same article, right?
01:16:08.472 - 01:17:00.370, Speaker B: Yeah, we teased the article and so you can start to read a little bit about it, but goes out next week. I was just hit with a whiff of inspiration this last weekend and I just banged out an article and I'm actually pretty proud of it. It's about how ethereum automatically balances itself. Gas fees, the ETH stake rate. This is a loop of signaling that allows the ethereum economy to self manage itself. And what is the process, what is the project of crypto economics? It's about making self governing financial systems. And so there is a system that has been created between gas fees, between the ETH stake rate, between the supply of staked ETH, the heat of the DeFi economy and all of these things create an equilibrium that allows ethereum to induce economic activity during cold seasons and pull back economic activity when things get too hot.
01:17:00.370 - 01:17:31.562, Speaker B: And it does it automatically where the Fed tries and does this manually, ethereum does this automatically. And the thing about the Fed is that the Fed is actually its own source of chaos. And so the Fed is trying to maintain stability in the economy but then the economy is looking at the Fed and being like oh, they're raising interest rates, trade, trade, trade. And so the Fed is actually a source of chaos into the system. Ethereum does not have that source of chaos. And so it is a magically autobalancing financial system. That article comes out on Thursday next week, along with a video as well, if you are a video minded person.
01:17:31.562 - 01:17:59.414, Speaker B: And then inside of the Bankless Nation, there is going to be A-Q-A session discussion, a book club, if you will, for anyone that has any questions. So that will happen on Friday, a week from the time you are listening to this at 03:00 P.m. Eastern. I'll go into the little water cooler video voice chat inside of the Bankless Nation discord and we'll have a little Q and A. So if you read this article and you want to ask questions and talk about it and unpack it a little bit more with me, I will be there on Friday, 03:00 P.m. Eastern time. So I will see you there.
01:17:59.532 - 01:18:08.534, Speaker A: It really is an algorithmic monetary policy, which is kind of cool. And it's also what sort of Bitcoin has promised from inception, except Bitcoin does not have a balanced algorithm.
01:18:08.582 - 01:18:09.206, Speaker B: It's too fragile.
01:18:09.238 - 01:18:40.290, Speaker A: In other words, supply decreases and then security goes out the window. If a Bitcoin was solely dependent on transaction fees I saw the stat the other day, there'd be about $2.5 million in Bitcoin security spent per day. The cost of attack is just like very minuscule in the millions of dollars. Just not sustainable. And, yeah, I think that's still a much underappreciated aspect of Ethereum and the ethereum economy.
01:18:40.630 - 01:18:43.394, Speaker B: Well, that's what I'm bullish on. Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:18:43.592 - 01:19:24.186, Speaker A: Another underappreciated aspect of what we're doing here in Crypto and the ethereum economy, and that is New Frontiers. And really the inspiration for this, David, was that episode we had with Arbitrum, where it's my first time to really talk to some of the participants in the Arbitrum community. That was an episode that came out earlier this week. If you want to learn about Arbitrum, what people are doing, go check that out. And I guess I had two observations under the kind of this motif of New Frontiers. The first is this allows for much more diversity rather than monocultures. So what I was struck with is the Arbitrum community is so very different from Ethereum Mainnet and from the application ecosystems and players on Ethereum Mainnet.
01:19:24.186 - 01:19:45.798, Speaker A: And I know we're going to talk to optimism in the coming weeks, that community in Polygon as well, I think Optimism is going to be more different still. And like Polygon, that's a whole nother variation. It reminds me before Crypto, David, believe it or not, I used to travel a lot. Like a whole lot. And I've probably visited almost every state in the US. At least the continental us.
01:19:45.884 - 01:19:46.870, Speaker B: Sounds awful.
01:19:47.210 - 01:20:16.274, Speaker A: Yeah, it was a lot of travel, but you get like, airports and that sort of thing. But you have the ability to kind of experience each state in the US. And you realize how diverse the US actually is. Going to somewhere like Alabama is much different than going to somewhere like washington state. Two totally different experiences of the US. Which is very different from New York and there's a different feeling in the West Coast versus the East Coast versus the Midwest. And so culturally it's different.
01:20:16.274 - 01:20:41.274, Speaker A: There are also different laws for every kind of state and every geography. But it's interesting because somehow this diverse set of jurisdictions and states, as they're called, with borders, all works, right, because they have the same set of shared values. What makes them american. If you go down to kind of the shared values that the founders kind of put together, it's in the Constitution, a decentralized protocol, right.
01:20:41.312 - 01:20:42.246, Speaker B: Layer one protocol.
01:20:42.358 - 01:21:31.260, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's what's so cool is what I'm seeing in Arbitrum is it's not similar, it's not the same as Ethereum, but it's kind of an echo of the value system, yet it's its own independent culture and set of applications and also set of new frontiers too. Like, we've just opened up in L2, these vast new lands to basically settle. And so entrepreneurs can go out there and build new things, users can go out there and use new products, governors can go out there and kind of figure out how to govern these ecosystems as well. And yet it's somewhat like the United States as well, which is like this shared experiment of all of these different states, right. Where if one state develops an innovation, it can pass it on to another state and they all sort of level up together.
01:21:31.870 - 01:21:34.662, Speaker B: Leveling up together while retaining their cultural differences.
01:21:34.726 - 01:22:32.330, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So if the Arbitrum community GameFi really takes off there, let's say, and sort of treasure an ecosystem, they develop some sort of groundbreaking wallet type application that is super easy to use, that can be exported to every other state, every other L2 in Ethereum. It's just so exciting to me to see all of this come together and to realize here's the net of it, is to realize we are just like, not even 1% through this journey here. Part of me was sort of in lack of imagination, really is just like, oh, the set of applications that we have in Ethereum in 2019 and 2020, they are going to be the big pockets of culture and inspiration for Ethereum. No, there's going to be all of this innovation across all of these L2s and we are just getting started. And so that means there's far more opportunity. 99% of the opportunity is still ahead of us in the crypto economy and we're just like a few steps on that road.
01:22:32.330 - 01:22:38.702, Speaker A: So new frontiers is what's really exciting to me. And seeing these L2s blossom has really nailed that home for me.
01:22:38.836 - 01:23:33.454, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think the angle you're really touching on is like the social scalability of the L2 system, which is like, what's your vibe? Does Arbitrum fit your vibe or does optimism fit your vibe? What vibe do you want? Because there's a L2 for you? Are you trying to reorchestrate human governance and create a new digital state? Because that's what optimism is trying to do with their two tier token model. Are you in the big world of DeFi and gaming? Because that's what Arbitrum's all about. What do you want on Polygon? We got Magic Eden over there and, like, avagatchi So what's your vibe? Because we got a L2 for you. And the cool thing is, this is also true outside of crypto because the cultural differences are all across alt layer ones. But when you do the same thing, the social scalability on ethereum, you're all in the same ecosystem. So you have composable communities because it exists both on Arbitrum and on optimism at the same time. And you can't do that on the layer ones.
01:23:33.454 - 01:23:40.370, Speaker B: And so this is all about social scalability. How can the L2 ecosystem map onto the values and cultures that we find out in the real world?
01:23:40.520 - 01:23:55.302, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really cool. And I think one of the most exciting times to be in crypto, honestly, is January 2023, because we're just starting this journey. All right, David, we got one meme of the week. It's a meme meme. What are we looking at here?
01:23:55.436 - 01:24:17.690, Speaker B: This is Cyrus Unesi. This is the meme. It's kind of an esoteric meme of the two people at the gate, lowering or raising the gates. One guy says to the other, rampant money printing caused the worst inflation in 40 years. Raise the interest rates. And then the next panel is the government is going to default on debt this Thursday. Lower the interest rates and then following eggs are $12 a carton.
01:24:17.690 - 01:24:20.846, Speaker B: Raise the interest rates just a little bit. Just a little bit.
01:24:20.948 - 01:24:33.010, Speaker A: I love the image of it's. Just like one guy through raw human strength, just like cranking this thing and it's just medieval and kind of doesn't work, and it's non automated. That's really what's happening right now with the economy, isn't it?
01:24:33.160 - 01:24:36.050, Speaker B: Exactly. Sadly, no moment of Zen this week.
01:24:36.200 - 01:24:51.218, Speaker A: Well, we got to end it there, guys. We will end with our usual risks and disclaimers, of course. And just to remind you, crypto is risky.
