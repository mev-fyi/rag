00:00:07.010 - 00:00:19.266, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation, welcome to another episode of State of the Nation. This is the episode where David and I get into the charts. Well, not just David and I. We brought a special guest. Who do we bring on today's state of the nation?
00:00:19.298 - 00:01:03.202, Speaker B: David Benjamin Cowan from into the cryptoverse, who is my favorite charter. When I go and decide it's time to look at the charts and kind of just want to get myself grounded as to where we are in the world. And charting, it's this interesting word, right? Charting as in the candles that you see on a chart. But charting is also like charting a course and like navigating a course and so on, the inevitable metaphor of going westward, we're bringing in our cartographer to help us map out where we are in the world of the markets. Where are we in this markets market cycle? Are there cycles even more at all? So we're going to ask some pretty broad questions to Ben, our resident cartographer, as to where we are in the world of these charts.
00:01:03.346 - 00:01:40.850, Speaker A: Yeah, and I don't look at charts very often, but I do enjoy it. It's kind of like candy to, you know, I touch it sparingly or else I'll overindulge myself. But what I love about Ben's work is that he looks at kind of the macro market cycle as well. So it's not just like, what are we doing on the daily or what's the weekly looking, but like, big picture, where are we in this long term trend? So I know we're going to talk about that. I know we're going to talk about cycles. I know we're going to talk about the dip that we have experienced, just like right now as we're recording this. And then I know we're going to talk about the close of 2021 because this is almost a year wrapped up, and then what 2022 will bring.
00:01:40.850 - 00:02:14.874, Speaker A: Everyone is curious about that. David, we've also got some news in the bankless nation. So we dropped an episode with former CFTC chair crypto dad Chris. John Carlo, the guy who brought us bitcoin futures, made a lot of this possible. Just a fantastic a, I think you said the most dad episode ever that we've done on bankless. And that's because Chris has all of this fantastic fatherly advice that he was imbuing on the bankless nation and on crypto. And also he had some great insights from being in the trenches, being a regulator.
00:02:14.874 - 00:02:26.126, Speaker A: So make sure you catch that episode. Also, David, you did an episode with G Money, who is a trader kind of a chartist himself. I listened to that this morning. It was fantastic. What's the preview of that episode?
00:02:26.238 - 00:02:43.782, Speaker B: Yeah, G money is this guy that's just exploded onto this NFT scene. He's the famous knitted cap ape on crypto Twitter and really left crypto after 2017. 2018, unlike a lot of people that stuck it through the bear market. He was like, nah, this is too crazy.
00:02:43.836 - 00:02:45.400, Speaker A: I'm going to leave too long.
00:02:46.090 - 00:03:20.130, Speaker B: He comes right back right at the start of DFI summer, the perfect time to just get back into it, and then ends up going through Defi and then down the NFT rabbit hole. And overall, I think it's a story of a guy who was focused on tradfi markets and then got into crypto and then into nfts. And it's also a story of culture progression where there was zero culture in tradfi, a decent amount of culture in Defi, and a ton of culture in nfts. So while this guy's story is progressing along different markets, it's also closer and closer towards culture. And of course, that is always where we finish off with every layer. Zero.
00:03:20.280 - 00:03:50.154, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll talk about a guy always being at the right place at the right time too. So this timing is just impeccable. Really cool story. Also, guys, we want to tell you about our friends at Opolis. So they've sponsored this message and want us to let you know that if you are thinking about going full time in a Dallas, particularly if you're in the US, you've got some considerations. Okay. It's like, how do you get health insurance? Where are the benefits? How do you do your taxes? This is what Opolis has covered for you.
00:03:50.154 - 00:04:31.254, Speaker A: It is a dao, it's a co op type dow, but it services those who want to engage in Dow work. So it's a dow for other dows, essentially. And this is a great way to get individual health insurance benefits, dental, eyeglass care, I need these, the eyeglass care and become a self sovereign employee because this is really the future of work that David and I talk about every single week on bankless. It's just like getting to this place where we're no longer working for corporations, the machine we're working for ourselves, for the DAO. And Opolis makes that possible. I believe there's also a special bonus. They put together a program for the bankless nation.
00:04:31.254 - 00:04:57.890, Speaker A: So if you're listening to this and you want to start freelancing for dows, become your own self sovereign employee and want the Opolis benefits, you can get 1000 work tokens and a thousand bank tokens when you join by the end of this year. So now is the time for open enrollments, the time you're probably thinking about your health benefits for the next year. This is the time to go check out Opelis. David, I know you know all about this. You've hung out with some of the founders of Opolis. Anything to add?
00:04:58.040 - 00:05:44.334, Speaker B: It's really, this is daos solving their own problems, right? Everyone wants to go and work for a Dao, but what about your family's healthcare? Opolis is a Dao that solves that problem, right? And so this is a call to action for other dows out there. Like, hey, if you are a revenue green Dow, you can start providing some of the same services that traditional companies used to provide their employees. But now for Dao. So this is a Dow co op where the revenue is actually split by Dow members, right? And so this is a co op. This is, you own the system. They do payroll, they do healthcare, they do all the logistics. Except for all of us being fractured among our different employers, we can actually all use the same co op for the same healthcare and we can all be unified under one single healthcare plan.
00:05:44.334 - 00:05:45.802, Speaker B: So that's the idea behind Opolis.
00:05:45.866 - 00:05:56.242, Speaker A: Yeah. Check that out at bankless. CC slash Opelis. That's all right. David, I'm going to ask you the question. What is the state of the nation this week, friend?
00:05:56.296 - 00:06:30.222, Speaker B: Yeah, I already leaked it a little bit, but we are charting. We are charting a course. The charts always go to the right. So when we keep on going right, what is out there? Are there monsters out there that be lurking in the seas? Like I said, ben is a cartographer and the actual title is the technical analysis quant. But in the world of crypto, where we have frontiers to explore, he is our cartographer. That's going to hopefully illustrate what might be ahead of us as we wrap up 2021 and what might be in store for us with 2022. We shall see.
00:06:30.356 - 00:06:49.878, Speaker A: Well, guys, I'm really excited to hear what Ben has to say about this because I don't know what's in store for the next month or the next three months. I have a fairly good picture of where we're going to head in the end destination, but not know apart from that. So we will be right back with Ben. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:06:50.044 - 00:07:32.066, Speaker B: Arbitram is an Ethereum scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI. And now it's live with over 100 projects deployed, gas fees on the Ethereum l one sucks. Too many people want to use Ethereum, and it doesn't have enough capacity for all of us. And that's why teams like Arbitrum have been hard at work developing layer two solutions that makes transactions on Ethereum cheap and instant. Arbitrum increases Ethereum's throughput by orders of magnitude, at a fraction of the cost of what we are used to paying. When interacting with arbitrum, you can get the performance of a centralized exchange while tapping into Ethereum's level of security and decentralization. That's why people are calling this Ethereum's broadband moment, where we get to add performance onto decentralization and security.
00:07:32.066 - 00:08:18.366, Speaker B: If you're a developer and you want to save on gas costs and overall make a better experience for your users, go to developer offchainlabs.com to get started building on Arbitrum if you're a user, keep an eye out for your favorite DFI apps building on Arbitrum many DFI applications that are on the Ethereum layer one are migrating over to layer twos like arbitrum, and some are even skipping over layer ones and deploying directly on layer twos. There are so many apps coming online to Arbitrum. So go to bridge Arbitrum IO and start bridging over your ether or any of the tokens listed, and start having a DFI experience that you've always wanted. Living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys. Not your keys, not your crypto. That's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet, which makes proper private key management a breeze.
00:08:18.366 - 00:09:02.590, Speaker B: But the ledger ecosystem is much more than just a secure hardware wallet. Ledger is the combination of the ledger hardware wallet and the Ledger Live app. And if you're used to seeing all of your crypto services and favorite defi apps all in one spot, Ledger Live is where you want to be. Not only does Ledger let you buy your crypto assets straight from the app, but it also hooks into all of the defi apps and services that you're used to using Ledger Live. You can stake your Ethan Lido, swap on Dexs like Paraswap, or display your nfts with Rainbow. You can also use wallet Connect inside of Ledger Live to connect to all the other defi apps that keep coming online. Defi never stops growing, and the Ledger live app grows alongside with it, so click the link in the show notes to see all of the defi apps that Ledger Live has.
00:09:02.590 - 00:09:29.160, Speaker B: And stay tuned as more apps come online. And if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet, what are you even waiting for? Go to ledger.com, grab a ledger, download Ledger live and get all of your defi apps all in one space. Alright guys, we are back with Ben Cowan from into the cryptoverse. Ben is a prolific charter, he's a prolific youtuber and also prolific live streamer, which is perfect because that is exactly what we are doing today. Ben, welcome to the show.
00:09:29.690 - 00:09:34.266, Speaker C: It's a pleasure to be here. Thanks for inviting me on. Excited to dive into the charts with you.
00:09:34.368 - 00:09:46.080, Speaker B: Yeah. But before we get in there, can we talk about what it's like to become knowledgeable in charting? What's the background that you have that makes you so good at this?
00:09:47.490 - 00:10:42.334, Speaker C: I don't even necessarily know that I would say that I have a background in your traditional technical analysis. A lot of that stuff I honestly don't even really know or put too much merit in in the first place, especially on the shorter time frames. My background, I have a bachelor's in mathematics, a phd in engineering, nuclear engineering, and after that I worked as a postdoc and a staff scientist at a national lab. And I started doing this stuff in 2019, in fact, one year after I'd started my postdoc. And I thought it'd be interesting to sort of navigate the crypto verse in a more quantitative perspective, not your typical head and shoulders or that kind of stuff, which I don't really put too much weight in the first place. And I thought it might be cool to try to more look at it from a sense of data science. Right.
00:10:42.334 - 00:10:59.400, Speaker C: And you're sort of mining long term trends in the market, that kind of stuff. The channel took off and then I ended up quitting my job. And yeah, I've just been doing this full time since January actually, of this year.
00:11:00.090 - 00:11:17.450, Speaker A: Congrats on that, Ben. You've got a fantastic channel, over 600,000 subscribers at this point in time, so some absolutely massive growth. Congrats on all the success. And I'm curious, why crypto, of course, you could apply these skills in other industries. Why did crypto draw you in?
00:11:17.600 - 00:12:38.994, Speaker C: Yeah, so crypto drew me in because when I was back in 2010, I was getting my undergrad in mathematics, and in the spring semester of my junior year, I believe I took a class in cryptography, actually, because I was doing a math major and it was one of the electives. It's not like they taught us about bitcoin back in 2010. But naturally, if you're learning about cryptography, I saw bitcoin, and then I started to follow it some. I didn't invest in it at the time, unfortunately, but then I followed it a lot, and then I really was following it while I was in grad school, just because I thought it was a really cool alternative to the traditional banking system that we have, and thinking that bitcoin is basically the soundest money. And then you also have Ethereum, which I'd more or less just consider them to be the blue chip cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and Ethereum. And I saw a lot of people get burned in 2017, 2018. And I was like, all right, well, there's got to be a better way for people to navigate this stuff than to just blindly throw their money in in a bubble mania phase and then basically cash out at the worst possible time, and then only to return again at the worst possible time to get.
00:12:38.994 - 00:12:52.410, Speaker C: So that was sort of the goal, was to say, all right, well, let's come up with a method to the madness, which actually, I guess, at the end of the day, will probably help reduce volatility in the crypto space. But, yeah, that's sort of the backstory.
00:12:52.990 - 00:12:55.302, Speaker B: One more question before we dive into the charts.
00:12:55.366 - 00:12:55.654, Speaker C: Ben.
00:12:55.702 - 00:13:10.080, Speaker B: Would you say that you kind of have developed your own style of looking at the charts, or have you followed in the footsteps of experts that have come before you, or is there some sort of actual history to your style, or did you kind of make it up yourself?
00:13:11.730 - 00:14:06.482, Speaker C: I think some of it I made up myself, but it's not like everything I do, it's not like I'm the first person to do all the different types of analysis. You see, I imagine you're going to have quants on Wall street that are probably doing. They're probably mining data as well and trying to look at long term trends. Some of the stuff we looked at are like, sharp ratios, tortina ratios, that kind of stuff, which is basically looking at your risk adjusted returns. Of course people are going to do that. That's just sort of classical theory and was developed decades ago. I'm certainly not the first person to look at logarithmic regression, but I I think when you look at all this stuff and you put it all together and you mind the data and you look at, say, the trends between one crypto like bitcoin, and then another one like ethereum, you can kind of tell a cohesive story that makes a lot more sense than trying to say what's going to happen.
00:14:06.482 - 00:14:25.030, Speaker C: Today or tomorrow, because I don't know what's going to happen. No one does. Not only does no one know what's going to happen tomorrow, we don't know what's going to happen next year either. But at least we can try to come up with a plan on how to navigate the crypto space. Really, no matter what happens. That's the ideal goal.
00:14:25.370 - 00:14:39.002, Speaker B: Well, you said it, and I'll say it again, no one knows what's happening. All these things are just models or predictive models. But now that that is out of the way, Ben, let's go into the charts so we can try and figure out what actually happened, what's going to happen next.
00:14:39.056 - 00:14:40.294, Speaker A: Yeah, show us what's going to happen.
00:14:40.352 - 00:14:59.426, Speaker B: Show us what's going to happen. The first question I have is, like, the concept of market cycles. Where are we in this current market cycle? Does the concept of a cycle still exist? And if it does still exist, how do we know where we're at in the cycle? Are these all fair questions to ask?
00:14:59.608 - 00:15:45.954, Speaker C: I think it is a fair question, and I think the definition of market cycle is somewhat ambiguous. It's basically one of those things where the longer we go, the longer the cryptocurrency asset class is around, the harder it's going to be to discern from one market cycle to another. And then you could start questioning, well, what even is a market cycle? What constitutes a market cycle? Does it have to be an 80% drop? If the definition is just, all right, well, if the asset class drops by 80%, then you have a new cycle. Some people prefer to measure it by the having. Right? And a lot of people like to measure it by the bitcoin having. The problem I have with measuring it from the having is that a lot of times, bitcoin can rally significantly ahead of the having. And so then you kind of miss out on what happened before.
00:15:45.954 - 00:16:36.880, Speaker C: Then you can also measure it from potentially, like a market cycle bottom. But if you measure the ROI of bitcoin from the market cycle bottom, you get a nice chart that looks like this. Of course, one of the issues is, again, there is some ambiguity in what constitutes a cycle, because if you just said it's an 80% drop, then you could argue that 2013 is two separate cycles. You could say, well, this is a one cycle and then this is another cycle. So I think there is some subjectivity there. So again, it's not something I think you can take to the bank or anything, but if you were to allow yourself some subjectivity in what you would constitute a market cycle and say, well, the first one is more or less the 2011 cycle where we basically just went straight up and then we came straight back down. Then we had the 2013 double peak cycle, the 2017 cycle, which I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with at this point.
00:16:36.880 - 00:17:32.898, Speaker C: And then we also have the most recent cycle. And sorry if there's a lot of background noise right now. There's someone's these right outside my window. But we're currently in the 2021 2019 cycle. And one of the things we've discussed is, well, how do you know where you are in a cycle? One thing, there are a lot of people that are calling for these crazy moonshot predictions for bitcoin right now, right? Literally as we speak, they're calling for these crazy mania moves to begin and take us into the very end of the year, followed by a year long bear market. And I think the problem with that is it's very deterministic. I think people are giving themselves too much credit in thinking that they know exactly what's going to happen in the market to say that everyone thinks that it's going to just go to by the end of the year.
00:17:32.898 - 00:18:09.886, Speaker C: That's really not how markets work. If a lot of people are expecting something, then people are going to front run that, and then there's going to be more people that try to front run the people that front run it. And then therefore it sort of doesn't really happen. It's sort of the same thing that happened in April. I was looking at this chart back in April and I thought, look, guys, this is great and crypto is doing really well. But in terms of the cycle ROI, we're ahead of schedule and it would make sense for us to have a cooldown phase that should last at least three to six months at the very least. Now, the other interesting thing is when you look at these cycles, a lot of people assume, again, they have to happen every four years.
00:18:09.886 - 00:19:14.034, Speaker C: A lot of that's built around the bitcoin having. But I would argue that if you really mind the data and look at it from, say, market cycle bottom, you could easily argue that, look, the cycle is LinkedIn, right? And I think it makes sense that they LinkedIn because every cycle there's more to speculate on, right? 2011 and 2013, there wasn't really a whole lot to speculate on other than those initial sort of narratives about what bitcoin was. And it's ultimately going to be going to overtake gold and whatnot. But then in 2017, you had more to speculate on, right? You had the ICO craze that Ethereum brought us, and unfortunately, 99% of those were outright scams. And I think, therefore, people wised up to that. And then by the end of 2017, early 2018, I think people sort of realize they're throwing all their money into these icos that are essentially just false promises. Someone with some basic experience on how to spin up a WordPress site and mint an ERC 20 token were promising the next best thing.
00:19:14.034 - 00:19:59.346, Speaker C: And it became abundantly clear that a lot of these people were just blowing smoke, right? And we were nowhere close to where they wanted us to be. And then you fast forward to this cycle, and this cycle is even more. It's different in the sense that you actually have something to speculate on, right? You have decentralized finance, right? You have all these centralized platforms that a lot of people like to use. And, I mean, I get that a lot of people are anti centralized stuff, but look, a lot of people in the world don't want the responsibility of managing their own crypto, and that's just the way it is. And so there's going to be some centralized platforms and whatnot. But you also have institutions coming into the space. Not that there weren't any institutions back then, necessarily, but the narrative this time is certainly stronger than it was last time.
00:19:59.346 - 00:21:07.250, Speaker C: So I think from a fundamental perspective, it makes sense that the cycles should lengthen. And then, technically speaking, from a market capitalization perspective, it's going to be hard to push the price of bitcoin another ten x, right? Everyone wants to promise it's going to go up another ten x or another 100 x, but the truth is, every cycle so far, we've seen diminishing returns, and that's sort of a buzzword that people don't really like to hear. But again, even in crypto, the returns that you're going to see with assets like bitcoin and Ethereum and altcoins, even though they may be technically diminished from what was possible in prior cycles, you're still likely experiencing returns far greater than you can find in most other asset classes. If you take Ethereum, it was at $80, what, 18 months ago, and today it's trading for over $4,000. And technically speaking, we are nowhere. I mean, we're still very much in diminished territory, right? I mean, a $1,000 investment into Ethereum back in November of 2015 would have been worth two or $3 million by January of 2018. So that gives you an idea of Ethereum can still go up a lot and still experience diminishing returns.
00:21:07.250 - 00:21:53.560, Speaker C: So I think it makes sense from a fundamental perspective, from a technical perspective, it just seems like it's going to take more time, a lot more capital to continue pushing the price further and further up the curve. And therefore, you look at the chart, and I know a lot of people think that we have to end the cycle. Now, a lot of people thought it was over in April. A lot of people thought it was over in September because of some various metrics. But I look at the chart and say, I think we still have a long way to go, and I don't think there's any reason it has to end this year. The only reason I think it would end this year is if bitcoin went parabolic in the next six weeks. Right? And I don't think it's going to go to $200,000 or something in the next six weeks.
00:21:53.560 - 00:21:58.550, Speaker C: Therefore, I think it's likely that we still have a ways to go.
00:21:58.700 - 00:22:22.802, Speaker A: So, Ben, when I see this chart, two questions pop up for me. Let me ask the first one first. So what we're seeing is a chart with four cycles. Here we are in the fourth cycle. You are maybe predicting or contemplating longer cycles for each. And indeed, this is getting close to the longest cycle, and maybe it doesn't peak at the place that the other three cycles did. But this is also a chart, I believe.
00:22:22.802 - 00:22:50.810, Speaker A: Is this just bitcoin? Is this just plotting bitcoin? Okay, let me ask about that assumption. So, obviously, that was the assumption in the first cycle. And the second cycle, it was heavy. Bitcoin maybe in the third cycle, in the fourth cycle. Do we still think bitcoin is the only crypto asset to watch or the primary one to watch? Why chart bitcoin rather than total market cap of all crypto, for instance?
00:22:51.150 - 00:23:16.146, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a great question, and I think it's important to do both. I do think that bitcoin controls the market. I know people don't like that. And it doesn't mean that if bitcoin goes up, everything else has to go up. It just means that if bitcoin is healthy, then the rest of the market is free to fly. Right? Like, look at the last few weeks with bitcoin more or less. I mean, bitcoin's gone sideways for the last month, ethereum has been trending higher.
00:23:16.146 - 00:24:19.430, Speaker C: We know that if bitcoin is going sideways above its 20 week moving average, then a lot of other cryptocurrencies are free to run. They don't have to stay stagnant just because bitcoin is staying stagnant. But if bitcoin is, say, below the 20 week moving average, or if it's trending down, then what happens is a lot of the altcoin bitcoin pairs, they trend down as well. So not only are you losing money in terms of your USD valuation of your altcoins, but you're losing valuation in terms of what it's worth in bitcoin, as if you had converted it all to bitcoin, how much bitcoin would it be worth? And I like to say that it's important to sort of know where bitcoin is, because if we think bitcoin is getting to the end of a cycle and it's going to go down 70% or something over the course of a year, then it's going to very likely drag 99.9% of the market with it. Right. There's always going to be a couple of coins that do well during the bear market, but for the most part, that's where a lot of assets go down.
00:24:19.430 - 00:24:47.326, Speaker C: But you ask a good question and we can look at the total cryptocurrency, market capitalization as well. So this is the total crypto market cap. And you can see that last cycle we made it to just below 1 trillion in terms of the market capitalization. So far this cycle, we've been able to break around 3 trillion. Right. So this one, I believe it was around 848 50. I don't remember exactly what it was, and it depends on what website you use.
00:24:47.326 - 00:25:32.282, Speaker C: But we were somewhere over 800 billion. So far this cycle, we've reached around 3 trillion. I would argue that we still have a ways to go. I'd like to see us hit the top of this logarithmic regression channel. And I think this is sort of one of those things that can help try to provide some guidance to say, look, even though bitcoin, there could be some evidence, as the bears have pointed out back in August when they said, all right, this is just going to be a dead cap bounce and we're going to go back down. I think that you can look at the total crypto market cap and say, well, it still seems like we have a lot of juice left in us, but we're not going to expend all that energy in, say, the next two months. It's going to take a lot of time for us to really get to the top of that curve.
00:25:32.282 - 00:26:24.190, Speaker C: And so it sort of brings into the idea, again, lengthening cycles and if you take the percent difference between the total crypto market cap, which is the white line, and then the fair value logarithmic regression trend line, which is the red line, note again, this is a key concept, I think, that I fail on my end to explain it properly. A lot of times the red line monotonically increases, right? So it only goes up, it doesn't go down. So what that means is that the fair value of the asset class as a whole is trending higher. And the only thing changing is how far are we overvalued from the fair value or how far are we undervalued from the fair value and the bear markets are when we're below the line. Right. When we're below the red line, that's really where the bear markets are. And honestly, that's the best time to accumulate crypto.
00:26:24.190 - 00:26:45.938, Speaker C: Are people accumulating crypto now? Of course they are. I'm even accumulating various cryptocurrencies right now. But right now is not the best time to accumulate. It might be the best time over a certain time period, depending on what your time preference is. But the best time is always in the bear market. And that was back over here one to two years ago. This was the best time to sort of load up.
00:26:45.938 - 00:27:28.194, Speaker C: And then now we're sort of in this overvaluation territory. But I wouldn't say that just because we're overvalued, it means we have to go back down. There's been plenty of examples in the past where we stayed overvalued for years before going back down to the undervaluation area. And so if you take the percent difference between the white line and the red line, and then we shifted it by 100% just so we get the undervaluation right here, this is what it looks like. And so you can kind of see that. All right, well, as time goes on, the extension from the fair value is diminished. Okay, so, like if you were to go over here and measure the percent difference between the white line at the peak to the red line, it's further than this one to here or this one to here.
00:27:28.194 - 00:28:15.438, Speaker C: And so the argument then becomes, well, it's likely that the final market cycle peak extension from the fair value, it's probably higher than where we currently are, but it's probably going to be technically diminished from the fair value compared to the prior market cycle peaks. Okay, now one more interesting observation on this chart is that despite the fact that we are at a higher market capitalization now than we were back in April, we're not as overvalued now as we were back in April. And the reason is because our reference point is the red line. And the red line used to be the fair value used to be seven or 800 billion, but now the fair value is 1.9 trillion. So it's all in reference to what the fair value is. And again, the fair value is trending higher.
00:28:15.438 - 00:28:33.430, Speaker C: You can see in several more years, the fair value will be 5 trillion. Right. For the entire asset class. And so it just slowly trends up with time. So I think the question about, do you just look at bitcoin? It's a good question. I think you really should look more than just at bitcoin. There's a lot of other assets that are going to grow.
00:28:33.430 - 00:28:50.922, Speaker C: I think ethereum is one of the biggest ones that's going to do very well. And so I do think it would be a mistake to sort of just look at bitcoin, and that's it. With that said, I think it is important to have charts where you do look at bitcoin so that you can kind of figure out where it is in life cycle or its market cycle.
00:28:51.066 - 00:29:25.558, Speaker A: That's fantastic information, Ben. So my second question on that cycles chart is just a question about the concept of cycles, okay? And I think people maybe say this, every cycle, like this cycle is the end of all cycles. This cycle is the super cycle. And we might have dips, but we're never going to see the sorts of cycles we did in the past. What's your, I guess, reply to people who believe in the super cycle? And you're thinking in terms of a fourth cycle here. Do you lend any merit to that? Any credence to that?
00:29:25.644 - 00:30:22.598, Speaker C: Well, I think a lot of it is sort of like, what's the definition of a super cycle? A lot of people say things like, well, to assume that the cycle is going to go into 2022 is assuming that this time is different. Right? And a lot of times the implication of anyone ever saying this time is different is usually it doesn't work out so well for them, because a lot of times it's not like this time is not different. Right? It tends to repeat. But my retort to the statement this time is different is to say this time would be different if the peak occurred in December because the prior peaks, as we can see, have technically lengthened from market cycle bottom right. There's several hundred days longer for cycle two than cycle one. And even cycle three was a couple of hundred days longer than cycle two. So to assume that the peak has to occur in, say, December.
00:30:22.598 - 00:31:04.418, Speaker C: That would actually be assuming that this time is different. And I know that a lot of people are probably not going to agree with that, but that's what I think. I think the obvious trend is that the cycles are lengthening, and so that's what I think is going to happen. I think ultimately the cycles are going to lengthen and we're going to go much further out. So I think the question, though, going back to super cycle is what constitutes a super cycle? If the cycle were to extend another year, does that mean it's a super cycle? I would not consider that a super cycle. I think the idea of a super cycle, right, as you said, is just going to go up and we're occasionally going to get some pullbacks, but the general direction from here on out is up. I would disagree.
00:31:04.418 - 00:31:48.174, Speaker C: I think the general direction is up for a while, but eventually we are going to hit a market cycle peak, and there's probably going to be a whole lot of fud that comes with it. It could be government intervention or government bans or attempted bans, regulation, risk. Right? I don't know. And a lot of us don't really know what it's going to be yet. But I mean, stable coins, that's another thing. Right? But there's always going to be something that I think is going to create another bear market. And I think the other point is, even this year we saw a 55% drop, right? So we clearly know crypto is capable of dropping 55%.
00:31:48.174 - 00:32:32.334, Speaker C: We know if you go back to 2020, we saw it drop, what, 60, 70% in just a matter of weeks. Everyone got a rude awakening that morning back in March, twelveth, March 13 of 2020, when everyone woke up and their entire portfolio was down 60% basically overnight. So I think the idea that we're never going to experience another bear market is probably wishful thinking. We probably will have a future bear market. But I also think bear markets tend to strike when people, they probably aren't going to think they're going to strike. So we could get into this phase where everyone kind of just gets into this mood of, all right, yeah, it's a super cycle. We're just going to trend up forever.
00:32:32.334 - 00:32:53.446, Speaker C: And then we could have a brutal one or two year bear market later this decade, and it could really sober some people up on the idea that it's only ever going to go up. So I would say the idea of a super cycle, I think we will have future bear markets, but I do think the cycle will lengthen with regards.
00:32:53.478 - 00:33:31.266, Speaker B: To these lengthening, lengthening cycles. This whole market cycle thing inside of crypto has turned into a total meme. It's like, oh, where are we in a cycle? This is the first question I asked on the show. Like, the cycle, the cycle, the cycles and cycles are not really something that you see in legacy markets. Right? They don't talk about like, oh, where are we in the market cycle? When it comes to your equities portfolio, and especially as we can see these bitcoin charts, one is just like very aggressively vertical, orange, not so aggressively, but still very vertical. Yellow and purple, more modest. And the idea is these things aren't so vertical over time, and instead they're more horizontal.
00:33:31.298 - 00:33:31.494, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:31.532 - 00:33:43.706, Speaker B: Implying that the market cycles are getting longer at some point is the logical conclusion of these lengthening market cycles just turns into the market and we can just remove the whole cycle word from this.
00:33:43.888 - 00:35:21.146, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so. Eventually, we're going to get to the point where you could imagine that the slope on a theoretical cycle is just not going to be very far removed from the x axis, right? And so at that point, you could argue that it's more or less just another typical asset class like the stock market, like precious metals, like commodities, whatever it might be, and that you're going to see it probably generally trend up with time. But I don't think you can just point towards something like the having, or what you might call a market cycle bottom and say, all right, well, it has to trend up for the next eight years or something, because at some point, if the idea of lengthening cycles continues to play out, right, the first cycle was a few hundred days, 200 something days. This one was like seven or 800 days. The third one was over 1000 days. If this one ends up being 1300 days, eventually you get to the point where if a cycle lasts like 2000 days, how useful is that information if there's still going to be two or 360 percent drops along the way? So I do agree that I think eventually the whole idea of market cycles will tend to go away, but I still think we're in the phase where we could probably say, look, there's going to be a bear market at some point, and it will distinguish kind of the phase that we're in right now to the next phase. I think a lot of people can agree that 2018 more or less separated last cycle, like the cycle before this one, because it was just a brutal bear market.
00:35:21.146 - 00:36:01.606, Speaker C: And basically anyone that wasn't super interested in crypto completely left a space, right. I think we will get another year like that. Another interesting chart, by the way, is to look at this chart on a linear scale, and it really shows you the idea of diminishing returns. And it's also one of those things, too, where people paint me out to be the bad guy for saying, like, oh, diminishing returns. Right. But I think it's something that it makes sense from a fundamental perspective, and you can use it to your advantage, in fact, to assume that the cycle can't outperform the prior cycle. Right.
00:36:01.606 - 00:36:31.146, Speaker C: And if it does, then, look, there's always a possibility. But I think that it really goes to show you how close we are already getting to the x axis when you look at it on a linear scale and look at prior market cycles. I mean, the first one was up like 700 x or something. This one was up 500 x. This one was up like 110, 120 x or so. And so each of these times, you see this parabolic move right at the very end that leads into the market cycle peak. And then here's the other one that leads into the market cycle peak.
00:36:31.146 - 00:37:11.002, Speaker C: Here's the third one that leads into the market cycle peak. The purple line. The last two or three years of all this bitcoin volatility is summed up in the purple line that you can essentially barely distinguish on this chart. So that gives you an idea of what diminishing returns means, because, again, if we weren't experiencing diminishing returns, if we were following, say, cycle two, then we should have already been at $2 million last year, but we're not. Eventually, I would expect this purple line to. I think it's going to go past this point, right? Because this one went past this one. This one went past this one.
00:37:11.002 - 00:37:21.040, Speaker C: So I would say eventually, I imagine it will turn up, and then that'll be the market cycle peak. But I would probably assume that it won't make it to the same RoI that the last cycle made it to.
00:37:21.490 - 00:37:35.330, Speaker B: The blow off tops on these things are so clear, whereas you can point to every single. So I'll let Ryan answer, ask his question, but I also want to pick your brain as to whether you think a blow off top is inevitable.
00:37:35.990 - 00:37:42.070, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. Yeah, why don't you answer that, and then I'll do mine. So what do you think about the blow off the top, Ben?
00:37:42.410 - 00:38:11.950, Speaker C: That's an interesting question. Back in April, everyone was saying. A lot of people were calling for. They were saying, like, oh, this can't be the top, right? At the top, we don't just go sideways for three months. Right. But the issue was, I think part of it is the market is maturing and people want to front run what they think is the market cycle peak. And so rather than get this mania phase, we actually got a more distribution like phase.
00:38:11.950 - 00:38:51.726, Speaker C: I still think there is a decent probability that we will have a blow off top, but I don't think it's going to happen this year. That's the thing. I don't think it's going to be this year. I think we have a ways to go, but I think that it will likely have a blow off top because at some point I think bitcoin is going to break one hundred K. And then above that, I think that's where retail FOMO comes back in. I've looked at my YouTube statistics. My daily views are nowhere close to where they were back in April and May.
00:38:51.726 - 00:39:14.514, Speaker C: And so when I look at that, maybe I can actually pull it up here. When I look at that, I say, look, there's a decent chance that the money in the crypto space right now is not new money. It's all of us, the people that have already been here for the cycle, it's all of us just continuing to.
00:39:14.712 - 00:39:17.622, Speaker A: We're just like cycling between coins right now at this point.
00:39:17.676 - 00:39:40.586, Speaker C: Yeah, sort of something like that. But look at this chart. Let me show you this chart over here. So can you see that on the screen? So here's my number of new daily subscribers. You can see back in March and April, I was getting like 6000. On Sunday. You can see how much higher it was today.
00:39:40.586 - 00:40:08.838, Speaker C: It's like background noise, right? 1000 subscribers a day is a lot, right. But compared to what happened back over here, you can see that today is completely different. Now, today it's actually gone back up, right. Because everyone's freaking out and everyone's wondering what's going on. But I look at a chart like this or the watch time and say, it seems like we're not at this mania phase right now. We're not up in these areas. We're sort of all the way down here.
00:40:08.838 - 00:40:27.274, Speaker C: And I look at that and say, I don't think retail FOMO has arrived back to the market. I think that the people that are here, for the most part, are the same people that were here earlier this year. We haven't ushered in the next crypto class yet.
00:40:27.392 - 00:40:32.460, Speaker B: Daily YouTube subscribers is not the chart I expected to be doing ta on today. But here we are.
00:40:34.190 - 00:40:35.286, Speaker C: You got to use everything.
00:40:35.408 - 00:41:03.910, Speaker A: So to me, this is not, I don't know what you guys consider ta and what's not, but some ta kind of loses me, to be honest. But these charts are the kinds that I love. These charts really tell a long term story, bankless. And our kind of philosophy is very sort of long term oriented. So I love these charts. I've got a question for you, Ben, too. We're talking about cycle four, lengthening cycles, I think you mentioned.
00:41:03.910 - 00:41:26.720, Speaker A: You wouldn't be surprised to see 1300 days, 1400 days. How long do you think cycle four is going to be? And what does that imply about how much more time we might have left in the fourth cycle? Are we talking like 100 days, 200 days, 300 days? I know some people think it will end in December and you don't, but what do you think? How long will cycle four be and how much more time do we have?
00:41:27.170 - 00:42:08.620, Speaker C: Yeah, I think a lot of people assume it's going to end this year. And I will say, I'm not going to sit up here and promise everyone that it's not going to end this year, because if in four weeks, bitcoin is trading at $150,000, I'm going to be running for the hills, to be completely honest. I'm not going to be sitting here claiming it's going to keep going up in 2022. If next month bitcoin is trading at like 150 or $200,000, I think that's the point where it's gone up too quickly. And despite all the great fundamentals of 2022, we probably can't sustain those prices. But realistically, I don't think that's going to happen. I think we have a ways to go.
00:42:08.620 - 00:42:43.926, Speaker C: I'm trying to answer your question as methodically as I can. If you look at the yearly RoI of bitcoin, and I think I have it on this one, if you look at, say, the yearly Roi of bitcoin and you look at, say, 2011 was a good year, right? We went up over ten x. 2012 was what, two or three x? No one's getting out of bed for that. 2013, pretty good year. 2014, that was a bad year, right? We're below ten to the zero. 2015, no one's getting out of bed for 2016. Certainly no one got out of bed.
00:42:43.926 - 00:43:04.714, Speaker C: 2017 was another good year. Right? 2018, bad year. 2019, humdrum. 2020, somewhat. Okay. What you notice is when you isolate all the ones that have done very, very well, it's just 2011, 2013 and 2017. And then the ones that have done very poorly are 2014 and 2018.
00:43:04.714 - 00:43:36.226, Speaker C: The red ones at the bottom, all the other ones are the yellow ones and they're just more or less hum drum. Right? We sort of went up, but we also kind of went down. Or maybe you can just argue that we slowly turned it up with time, right. We ended the year higher than where we started it at, but we didn't end it with a parabolic rally. If you look at the current year, the blue line, this has been a pretty humdrum year for bitcoin. It hasn't been the year of the parabolic rally for bitcoin. Right? And you can see that on the chart.
00:43:36.226 - 00:44:05.774, Speaker C: I mean, despite what people have promised, it just hasn't actually transpired. Now, it could theoretically transpire. It hasn't transpired yet. But to answer your question, I think that when we look at these charts, we can potentially look at a couple of different things. One of the things we can look at is this analysis here. And I think this one is probably pretty dubious, in fact. But the whole idea is the first peak to the second intermediate peak here was a certain time period, 672 days.
00:44:05.774 - 00:44:47.470, Speaker C: And then the time between, say, the first peak or the intermediate peak to the second peak was another 235 days. If you were to sort of propagate that over here and take that same time ratio, it would actually put the next peak out in July of 2022. But I would say that there still is a good chance that we could go beyond that. Right. There's a couple of different reasons. One of the reasons, actually, this is an interesting analysis. If you take the peaks and isolate each peak, peak, one peak, one, two and three, and then you plot them when they occurred based on the number of days, and then you invert time.
00:44:47.470 - 00:45:24.442, Speaker C: So you take one over time, you get something like this. And again, this is a very dubious extrapolation. I'm not going to pretend like it's not, because it is extremely sensitive to when the prior peaks occurred. But if you were to fit that curve and then extrapolate out to where the fourth data point would be, where would the fourth market cycle peak be? It actually puts it in August of 2023. I know a lot of people would probably look at that and say, that doesn't make any sense. And even to me, it's sometimes hard to think that it could go out that long. But I also look at the chart today and say, look, bitcoin is only three x.
00:45:24.442 - 00:46:10.620, Speaker C: The prior all time high. Right. By this time, the prior cycle bitcoin was 100 x, or, sorry, it was 100 x from the cycle, bottom right. But from the prior all time high, it was up about 20 x or so, and so I look at it and say, yeah, technically a 64k peak or a 69k peak could be. That could be the diminishing returns that we're talking about, but it also seems like we should be able to push a bit higher than that. And so I just look at it and say, look, I think that the next cycle, or, sorry, the current cycle, is highly likely to go beyond this year. I think it's going to at least go into 2022 and probably beyond the beginning of 2022 as well.
00:46:10.620 - 00:46:52.840, Speaker C: Q one. While it is a possibility, I would still argue it's more likely to go beyond Q one. Could it be in Q two? Maybe. But look, Q three, you have Q four of 2022, and then you could get back into that seasonality that people always talk about. I always thought that would be pretty funny if the market cycle peak came a full year after when people were expecting it to come, let's say December of 2022 or something. But I think the other thing to consider is, while I put a lot of effort into kind of like trying to understand market cycle peaks and when they're going to occur, I don't really trade that. I have a risk metric that I use.
00:46:52.840 - 00:47:53.850, Speaker C: It's this thing, and basically whenever it gets overheated like this, I basically just take profits on the way out, and then I just wait for it to come back down and then I move back in again. And so I don't really concern myself so much with when exactly it's going to occur, because there's nothing about cycle theory that would have told me we were going to have a peak in April of 2021. Right? No one was saying that we're going to have a market cycle peak in April of 2021, but this is the risk metric that I use, and it told me back then that, look, we are kind of heated right now, whereas we're almost as heated as we were back in 2017, and it seems like there's a reasonable chance that we get a pullback. Now, that doesn't mean it's a market cycle peak. As you can see, in 2013, we had two of these heated phases. But my argument all along is that if this is a double peak cycle, it's probably a stretched out version of 2013, not a carbon copy of 2013.
00:47:54.350 - 00:48:38.440, Speaker A: What's so fascinating to me is your whole analysis is you're very price based and time based and has nothing to do with catalysts. Right? So you mentioned possibly this cycle could kind of could end anytime, of course, but it could end in July 2022 or could get extended to August 2023 or even longer than that. It's interesting. It's like July 2022. Around that time, the eth merge should happen, right? Some people have called this the triple havening, but that doesn't factor into the analysis at all, because maybe over the long timescale, these things don't seem to matter. Is that what this is teaching us? It's just like time and price and cycles, and if we pay attention to those things, then we're okay, and catalysts don't matter so much.
00:48:39.370 - 00:48:44.940, Speaker C: It's an interesting thing, because if I say that stuff like that doesn't matter, it really has a way of pissing a lot of people off.
00:48:46.190 - 00:48:51.966, Speaker A: I'm genuinely curious your perspective, right. I'm not pissed off at all. I'm curious what you think.
00:48:52.148 - 00:49:53.230, Speaker C: It's interesting because you would think that all these things would make a big difference. But I guess the counterpoint is, well, what if ethereum were to rally to, say, $25,000 in the next five months, and then people could then use that to say then going into the merge in the summer of 2022, that, okay, the price is only going to keep going up, right? Because if it's already at, then why can't it keep going up after the merge? Which is only going to make things better. Right. But at some point, we have to understand that the prices that these assets are, it's not that they're necessarily being fairly valued, it's just that we're riding up on momentum and hype around something, and then once that something is actually delivered, a lot of that hype can actually die back down. And it doesn't mean that the project hasn't improved. It just means that the hype around it has sort of died off a little bit. And so I think that even in the bear market, there's things that happen that are good for the asset class.
00:49:53.230 - 00:50:26.778, Speaker C: It's just that no one cares about them because everyone's just complaining about why the prices are so low. But in the bull market, no one really cares about the bad news either. In the bull market, everyone always shakes off all the stablecoin fear, all the china fear, all that sort of stuff. You get into a bear market, and that's all anyone ever wants to talk about. What did Elon say? What did China say this week? But as far as I'm concerned, Elon. And again, this goes against what a lot of people would say. I don't think Elon is responsible for what we saw happen back in May.
00:50:26.778 - 00:51:17.910, Speaker C: I don't and I was saying this back over here, I said, look guys, people are going to rationalize why their predictions don't pan out, right. They're going to rationalize why bitcoin is not at 300k by September or why it's not at their price valuation. They're going to scream market manipulation or something. But look, at the end of the day, bitcoin went from three thousand eight hundred dollars to sixty four thousand dollars in the span of about a year. And to say that we can't have a sizable pullback unless some catalyst causes it, I think it's probably a bit ignorant. So that's why I think that people like to use these events to rationalize why things don't pan out the way they think. But I think that at the end of the day, we were just overheated.
00:51:17.910 - 00:51:54.694, Speaker C: And also you have to think too, again, with things like the merge, it's not like it's a secret. So if people are buying Ethereum today, they're buying it because they expect it to do well, probably because they expect the merge to go well. Right? So you could argue that it's already been factored into the price anyways. And if it doesn't go well, then it could cause a sharp sell off. Right. So just because something occurs doesn't mean it necessarily has to affect the price. If you go back and look at what happened to Ethereum, Ethereum has done nothing but have, I feel like just great news for a long time.
00:51:54.694 - 00:52:16.862, Speaker C: And you have the network effect. Everyone's using it. I mean the gas fees are high, but they're high. Right. But I mean, it's also a sign that people are actually using the network. So it didn't stop Ethereum from dropping from four thousand four hundred dollars to one thousand seven hundred dollars in the span of a few weeks. So it's a highly speculative asset class.
00:52:16.862 - 00:52:48.166, Speaker C: We're all sort of figuring out what these assets are worth and we just have to go through these boom and bust cycles over and over again to ultimately reach a fair value. And I think a lot of that's actually captured in the logarithmic progression stuff. It does curve over with time. The best gains are early on. And then as you get further in time, it takes a lot more time to continue to push up that curve. And you can see it sort of folds over as well. Okay, so that's generally the idea.
00:52:48.348 - 00:53:21.790, Speaker B: Absolutely. Ben. I think the label of cartographer is becoming just more and more accurate. I feel very grounded right now in the charts. I want to see if I can get you to zoom in on some closer timeframes with regards to bitcoin and Ethereum because as of the last couple of days we've dumped off a little bit. But meanwhile ether has had this very long sustainable run up for all of October, so we're going to go ahead and get there right after we talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Matcha, everyone's favorite Dex aggregator, has just launched an open beta for gasless trading.
00:53:21.790 - 00:54:11.518, Speaker B: So if you're trading more than $5,000 in common ETH and wrapped bitcoin pairs, then your gas fees on matcha are free. And that's why you should be using matcha. Matcha routes your orders across all the various Defi exchanges on Ethereum, polygon, binance, smart chain and gives you the best possible price without any trading fees or unnecessary slippage. Matcha has smart order routing that splits your orders across multiple liquidity sources. If matcha sees that, it gets you better pricing trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me into a single and easy to use platform and has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and getting a bad price. Matcha also allows you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defi trades and they will go through automatically while you're away. So when you're making a trade, head over to matcha XYz slash bankless.
00:54:11.518 - 00:54:54.418, Speaker B: Connect your wallet and start getting some of the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets. Alchemyx is one of the coolest new DFI apps on the scene. It introduces selfpaying loans, allowing you to spend and save at the same time. Deposit the Dai stablecoin into the Alchemyx vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates. Borrow up to 50% of the total amount of your deposited Dai in the form of Al USD stablecoin. Here's the craziest part, the loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated. Unlock your assets potential in the ultimate DFI savings account and brand new to Alkmix is the ETH vault, where you can deposit ETH into the application.
00:54:54.418 - 00:55:23.450, Speaker B: Borrow al eth against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time. V two is rapidly approaching, which will allow for even more collateral types, plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from. Harness the power of Alchemyx at Alchemyx F I that's A-L-C-H-E-M-I-X-F-I follow Alchemyx on Twitter at alchemy Fi and join the discord to keep up to date with Alchemyx V two and to get involved in governance.
00:55:26.730 - 00:55:31.542, Speaker C: Two, one. All right, guys.
00:55:31.596 - 00:55:50.320, Speaker B: And we are back with Benjamin Cowan of into the crypto verse. And we've been talking all about market cycles using bitcoin as a frame of reference. But here we've got the market cycles of Ethereum, of which there are only two. So, Ben, when we look at the market cycles of Ethereum, do we see a different story, the same story? What are the differences that we see here?
00:55:50.770 - 00:57:18.090, Speaker C: Yeah, the one issue with Ethereum is that it launched sort of like in the summer of 2015. The market cycle bottom for bitcoin was actually January of 2015. So to measure it from the market cycle bottom of the entire asset class is not possible. If you measure it from the market cycle bottom of this cycle. And then when it launched, which was in the middle of last cycle, you get something that looks like this, right? If you translate this to instead start here in March of 2020, which is sort of like trying to emulate as if you were starting in the middle of this cycle, or say, not like in the middle of it, but just not at the very beginning like last cycle was, and you shift it, you get something that looks like this, right? And what you notice is that Ethereum in the last market cycle had a very similar move up and then it just went sideways for a year, right? Everyone thinks about 2015 to 2017, 2018 as just nothing but up for Ethereum. But look, this is a span of a year where Ethereum just went sideways, right? Here's a span of six months where Ethereum just went sideways and Ethereum went sideways at around a 30 x up or so from the bottom. I thought an interesting thing was sort of the double bottom on the return on investment from that local bottom in the first cycle was right here.
00:57:18.090 - 00:57:51.574, Speaker C: You can see it at right around 20 x or right below 20 x. And also look at this cycle, it's also right around that same area. After we had that sort of that local top that we had, and we came back down and we're sort of slowly trending back up. So I look at this chart and say, you know what, could Ethereum go sideways? For a while recently, it's just been going up. I don't actually have the most recent dip on this chart because I did these charts like a day ago, and then since then the market dropped 10%. But you can imagine that even a 10% drop is basically just a pixel on the screen. Right.
00:57:51.574 - 00:58:28.782, Speaker C: I mean, Ethereum is trading now at $4,200. We're essentially now at the prices that once upon a time was the blow off sort of top for ethereum earlier this year. Right. So the prior blow off mania phase is now the FUD price. Right. So it really does put things into perspective, I think, into kind of where we are. And I look at this and say, is it possible that we come back down and continue to grind sideways for a while? Absolutely right.
00:58:28.782 - 00:58:36.820, Speaker C: Of course that could happen. I still think we ultimately have higher to go this cycle, but it doesn't mean we can't ultimately grind it out for a bit longer.
00:58:42.680 - 00:58:44.400, Speaker A: Hey, David, if you're talking, you're muted.
00:58:44.480 - 00:58:56.264, Speaker B: Thank you. Sorry. A few other things I'm getting hoping to look at is bitcoin dominance. Is that an informative chart for you, what the bitcoin dominance chart looks like? And what does that tell you as a story?
00:58:56.462 - 00:59:21.932, Speaker C: Yeah. So I was trying to draw out potential paths. This is one of them. But what I'm thinking sort of about the bitcoin dominance, more or less, is that we know that when bitcoin goes parabolic, the dominance goes up. Right. We also know that when bitcoin goes down really quickly, the dominance goes up. So if it goes up too quickly or it goes down too quickly, the dominance of bitcoin generally goes up.
00:59:21.932 - 01:00:07.490, Speaker C: We also know, or I guess we don't know it. I would expect that if the market cycle is going to continue into 2022 and whatnot, that in order for it to continue in a healthy manner, at some point, bitcoin has to go up. Right? Like, it can't just stay at 60k forever. I think it'd be good for the entire asset class at some point if it were to go up to. But I would actually prefer a slow grind up as opposed to a parabolic move, because the downside to a parabolic move is done in a few weeks, and then you have to spend a year in a bear market. So I look at the dominance and say, look, so far, it looks like we've had. I don't know how much weight you put into these things, right? But it looks like it had a double bottom around 40%.
01:00:07.490 - 01:01:00.690, Speaker C: It has been moving, first of all, it started late September. It's been moving up from 40% all the way up until mid October. It sort of had a local top at 47, 48%. Recently, we've been coming down some. My sort of thinking in terms of where bitcoin is ultimately going to go with regards to the dominance this cycle, I do think the dominance is going to go a lot lower than where it currently is. But I don't necessarily think that means the dominance has to go low now, right? Assume that the next market cycle peak is somewhere, let's say the dominance is below 32%, but it could be somewhere way out here, right? And it could maybe like this box or something, which would be a pretty crazy time in the asset class. So imagine that the final market cycle peak is something like that.
01:01:00.690 - 01:02:02.132, Speaker C: Then I think the only question is, well, how do we get there, right? Does it just go straight down? Does it go up first and then back down again? I would argue that at some point bitcoin is going to make a nice rally and when it does, the dominance will go up. But we also know that after that happens, the dominance will then probably go further down than it has already. So that's what I'm looking at. I mean, obviously the counter thesis to all this is if the bears are right and the market cycle peak is in, then the dominance is actually more likely to just go back up, right? So I would say that I think that if the market cycle peak is not in, which is what I think, then the dominance is likely to go down over the next twelve to 18 months. But in the short term, it could always go up if bitcoin is moving up too quickly or moving down too quickly. But if the market cycle peak is in, which I don't think it is. But again, in order to prove that, we have to wait a while, because a lot of people think that, oh, well, that just means by the end of the year.
01:02:02.132 - 01:02:48.224, Speaker C: No, I don't think it has to mean that if the market cycle peak is in, I would just assume we're going to go up because then you go back to, say, 2018, and you can see that once the bear market was ushered in, we essentially got rid of a lot of the garbage in the space and everything just went back into bitcoin, right, or back into us dollars or something. So if the bear market's in, we're probably going to go mean we could still go up in the short term even if the bear market's not in. But I would argue that it's more likely the cycles are going to go on for a while. So we'll probably find ourselves at a dominance that's much lower than the current dominance. But I don't think we're imminently at that time. We still have a ways to go before we could see a sharp drop. And you can see that this drop happened really quickly when it occurred.
01:02:48.224 - 01:03:26.050, Speaker C: So imagine we were to repeat the phase of, say, September through may again at some point in the future. You could still imagine a scenario where the dominance goes up, something like that, but then it could still come back down if altcoins then rally after it. Right? So that's sort of what I'm looking at. And one of the reasons I think is, I think if you look at this, it seems like the dominance is generally in a macro downtrend. At least that's what I think. I guess, technically speaking, someone might try to argue, well, maybe this is an uptrend. Maybe it's actually slowly moving up or something.
01:03:26.050 - 01:03:51.176, Speaker C: That's the thing I have with ta, right. You can tell whatever story you want to tell as long as you draw the right lines. Right? So I do think the dominance will ultimately go down, but I certainly do expect bitcoin to put in a fight on more than one occasion this cycle and send the dominance at various phases up 10% higher than where it will be when it starts that move.
01:03:51.278 - 01:03:58.584, Speaker A: Ben, EtH people have been talking about the flipping for a long time. Okay? I'm talking years. Remember Eth people about this in 2017.
01:03:58.632 - 01:04:00.648, Speaker B: Since before this first block was mined.
01:04:00.744 - 01:04:15.920, Speaker A: Yeah. What's your take on that? Maybe there's a story of bitcoin dominance decreasing every cycle. Do you think that there's the possibility or probability that ETH flippens bitcoin this cycle?
01:04:16.820 - 01:05:18.528, Speaker C: It's an interesting question, and one of the things that I think is interesting with it is when we talk about the flipping, a lot of people like to talk about other cryptocurrencies, right? And they say, well, this altcoin is going to flip Ethereum, or this altcoin is going to flip bitcoin, I would say. I don't think anything's flipping anything this year, right? I don't think any altcoin is going to flip Ethereum. I don't think Ethereum is going to flip bitcoin in 2021. I've been saying that since 2019. But one of the things we can look at, to answer your question, is we specifically want to go look at the ether bitcoin valuation, right? Because that's what matters. Well, maybe technically the market cap, right? Because the supply isn't necessarily constant. But you get an idea generally with just the ether bitcoin pair, and if you go look at, say, the daily time frame, and I think a lot of people kind of think that the flipping can't happen just because it would be so monumental.
01:05:18.528 - 01:05:58.640, Speaker C: But one of the things you can do is you can see here on June 13 of 2017. So let's go take a look at June 13 of 2017, and this is a historical snapshot. Ethereum's market cap was at 36 billion. Bitcoin's was only at 44 billion. So Ethereum did in fact come within striking distance of overtaking bitcoin once upon a time. So I know it's sort of one of those things that if you say the flipping is going to occur, a lot of people are just going to naturally roll their eyes and say, you don't know what you're talking about. But look, it came just within a few percent, basically, of flipping it in the past.
01:05:58.640 - 01:07:00.052, Speaker C: And I think another thing to consider that could make the flipping more likely is typically the market cycle peak for bitcoin happens before the market cycle peak for Ethereum. So if the market cycle peak for bitcoin ends up being like one hundred and fifty k, or two hundred k or something like that, then that doesn't mean that we have to compare it to what the maximum price of Ethereum could be at that time, because it could be that bitcoin goes to like one hundred and fifty k or something, and then it drops back to. Then it has a dead cap bounce to. During that dead cap bounce, Ethereum goes to its market cycle peak of whatever that's going to be. So that's the general question is, well, can we get to that level? And my thesis on the Ethereum bitcoin valuation, and I've had this drawn since, like, 2019, these lines is just that we're generally just in this macro uptrend channel, right, where we are slowly climbing higher. And recently we've actually broken out of it. And we're actually sort of writing this line up here.
01:07:00.052 - 01:08:05.092, Speaker C: In order for me to think that the Ethereum valuation, that Ethereum is going to flip bitcoin this cycle, I think it would probably mean the cycle has to go to 2023, I believe, because we need to be breaking up to these valuations up here. And I would imagine that these white lines, by the way, are showing where 2022 is. So anything between these two vertical white lines is 2022. Could we make it to this region, like, say, next year? I would say it's possible. But the problem is that I think that in order for Ethereum to go to these really high valuations against the US dollar, it's assuming that bitcoin is probably going to have its own parabolic move, which means when bitcoin has its own parabolic move, Ethereum usually takes a backseat for the time being. So what I would be looking for, if I were to assume this flipping could occur this cycle, I would say that it might occur, but it's probably going to be a while if it's going to occur. One of the things we've seen with Ethereum before against bitcoin is seasonality.
01:08:05.092 - 01:08:26.956, Speaker C: It tends to go parabolic against bitcoin in January, and I'll show you what I mean. So in previous fourth quarters, you can see the Ethereum bitcoin valuation tends to bleed. Right, this is down in q four of 2015. Where did the parabolic move started? The Ethereum bitcoin valuation, it started in q one in January. Look at this. Q four, it bled. Where did the parabolic move start against bitcoin? It started in January.
01:08:26.956 - 01:08:48.360, Speaker C: This one again. This one started in mid December, after bleeding for most of the year, especially in q four. And then we had this parabolic move that was in the beginning of the year again. This one here started in mid December, and it lasted for part of q one again. Here you look at a q four bleed. We had a parabolic move, sort of a parabolic move. Not really, but at least it was a nice move to the upside by the Ethereum bitcoin valuation in January.
01:08:48.360 - 01:09:16.336, Speaker C: Same thing last year, it bled in q four. We had a nice parabolic move in January. The interesting thing, though, for ethereum this year so far, things can change. Of course, it has not been bleeding in q four. This is the first q four ethereum has ever had where it's not bleeding against bitcoin. Right? It's more or less going sideways. If you go look at quarterly candles, we're actually technically up right now by about three and a half percent.
01:09:16.336 - 01:10:08.290, Speaker C: Now, that doesn't mean it's going to stay like that. We still have, what, half the quarter to go? I mean, we're only at mid November right now. But I think Ethereum is actually looking relatively strong compared to where I would have expected it to be. And you can see it's really putting up a fight. So one of the things I would say is that if it's going to flip bitcoin, it would be nice to get a couple more nice januaries under our belt, right? So not only January of 2022, but also January of 2023. And if we can reach that point, if we can reach that point, and we get a parabolic rally up after bitcoin has a parabolic rally or something, then it is certainly possible that it could flip it. But I would argue that if it does flip it, it probably won't sustain it in the bear market, is my guess.
01:10:08.290 - 01:10:38.476, Speaker C: Just because we know that Ethereum does tend to bleed a bit worse than bitcoin in the bear market. But I mean, it also gives you more upside in the bull market, so it kind of makes sense. So could Ethereum flip bitcoin? I think it could, mainly because we've seen the historical snapshot. It's already come extremely close to doing it before. It's in a very long macro trend up. It seems like time is on our side with regards to lengthening cycles, and it still seems like we have a long way to go. The only way that we don't flip it, or.
01:10:38.476 - 01:11:23.284, Speaker C: I don't want to say the only way we don't flip it, but one potential way we wouldn't flip it this cycle is if it sort of peters out in a few months. Like if it only goes, say, into q one or q two or something, then I don't think Ethereum has really any chance to be able to flip bitcoin. But if it goes on for another year or something, then you're getting into the territory where, hey, this long term momentum shift to the upside is really going. It's not going to take that much longer. I mean, if we keep riding this line up here, by the summer of 2022, we could be at 0.1, right? And 0.1 could be a launch pad to get us to that flipping status.
01:11:23.284 - 01:11:29.500, Speaker C: So I don't want to say that it has to happen, but if the cycle extends long enough, it certainly can happen.
01:11:29.650 - 01:11:55.990, Speaker A: Ben, we talked a lot about, obviously, these cycles and bitcoin and ether in particular. You called these two assets sort of the blue chip assets. I'm curious why you think these are the blue chip assets, right? Because, of course, we've seen other coins have runs, some only last a cycle, some this is their second cycle, and it's hard to know what's what. Why. Do you think bitcoin and ether are blue chip, or are they special in any ways?
01:11:56.920 - 01:12:37.468, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they're the two most massively decentralized protocols, and I don't think it's even close between any other assets. With bitcoin, you just simply have the network effect. Obviously, if someone were to launch bitcoin today and bitcoin didn't exist, it would be seen as sort of like a dinosaur type thing. But it is the first one. The only reason we're all here looking at this stuff is because bitcoin initially existed and sort of gave everyone the insight to, hey, let's explore this idea. That's where the network effect is. What's going to be around in ten years? Are some altcoins going to be around? Yeah, some of them will survive.
01:12:37.468 - 01:12:55.240, Speaker C: You just really never know. One great example, look at 2017. You have bitcoin and ethereum. But look at all these coins that aren't even in the top ten today, right? Some of these coins, some of the viewers here probably have never even heard of them, right? They've never even heard of them.
01:12:55.310 - 01:12:58.820, Speaker A: Where's the iota supporters on the YouTube?
01:12:58.980 - 01:13:25.168, Speaker C: The NEM supporters? Go back to, say, 2013 and take a look. I mean, look at this. You have things like not a lot of people have heard of peer coin, namecoin, feathercoin, nova coin. Don't even get me started on BBQ coin. You look at this and it's like, in ten years, we really don't know what altcoins are going to be around. But I would say it's highly likely that bitcoin will be around. And it's highly likely that Ethereum will be around.
01:13:25.168 - 01:14:20.736, Speaker C: I think that people give Ethereum a hard time because the gas fees are high. And I've given this speech before, right? But again, the gas fees are high because people use it. And if they wanted to lower the gas fees, they could, but they would, of course, be sacrificing some level of decentralization to do so. Right? If they raise the block size and make it so that you have more computational requirements to run a node, it's going to make it somewhat more centralized, and you sort of have that trilemma. But I think that a lot of other projects sort of tout themselves as being better than Ethereum, but a lot of them are. I mean, they're not, right? They might be better at some aspects, right? Like some of them might be faster, some of them might have lower fees, but they're sacrificing somewhere else, right? Like it's an engineering problem. It's all about optimizing things.
01:14:20.736 - 01:15:27.884, Speaker C: So maybe they have higher gas, or maybe they have lower gas fees because no one uses the network. Maybe they have lower gas fees because it's extremely centralized, right? Again, the binance smart chain originally started as a clone of go Ethereum, and the gas fees there are really low. It's not like it's groundbreaking technology. It's just that they're willing to sacrifice things that Ethereum developers are not willing to sacrifice. I think that Ethereum is pretty far out ahead in terms of development and stuff and transitioning to becoming roll up centric, et cetera. And so I look at this and say, from a fundamental perspective, I think they're the blue chips, right? From a market cap perspective, they're the blue chips, right? They're the safest. From a technical perspective, if you were to measure out the sharp ratio and the sortino ratio, ethereum, if you just ran it against bitcoin and Ethereum, the optimal portfolio that maximizes your risk adjusted returns is actually 65% bitcoin, 35% eth.
01:15:27.884 - 01:16:11.524, Speaker C: That's not my opinion, by the way. Right. That's just if anyone can run that same analysis where you figure out what maximizes your sharp ratio of those two assets and it ends up being 65% bitcoin, 35% eth. Again, if you run the same analysis and include litecoin in it, it comes out with zero point litecoin. The reason is not to say, again, it's not to say that litecoin can't go up. It's just to say that, look, if litecoin does go up, it's also highly likely that Ethereum has gone up a lot more than right. And I can't pass up the opportunity to show the litecoin Ethereum chart just because it really sort of hammers down, hammers home opportunity cost and why.
01:16:11.524 - 01:16:12.976, Speaker C: Ethereum is a blue chip.
01:16:13.088 - 01:16:18.424, Speaker A: We're talking litecoin, which is bitcoin silver. Is that the name we're talking about?
01:16:18.462 - 01:17:08.452, Speaker C: Yeah, this is what I'm talking about. When you're talking about blue chips and people say, well, why can't you have a large position in some of these other cryptocurrencies? You look at these projects and look, will litecoin trend up against the US dollar with time? Yeah, probably will. It's bled 91% against Ethereum over the last two years. So to me, a blue chip, I want it to outperform a lot of the asset class, right? I want it to outperform. I don't want it to see this downside. And I could go through a ton of different coins that all they do, all they do is they bleed against Ethereum over the macro scale, right? I mean, here's XRP, it just bleeds against Ethereum over the macro scale, right? Here's some other coins that were relics of the last market cycle. They bleed against Ethereum over the macro scale.
01:17:08.452 - 01:17:43.744, Speaker C: So the argument, of course, just becomes, simply put, will your altcoin trend up against the US dollar in a bull market? Yes. Right. But anyone can pick out cryptocurrencies that will probably do well during a bull market. You always have to ask yourself, and it's sort of become a meme now on my channel. Right. What if it bleeds against Ethereum? And a lot of cryptocurrencies, if you go look at their valuations against Ethereum, they bleed over the macro scale. So if you do have altcoins, make sure at the very least that they oscillate against Ethereum or they go up against Ethereum.
01:17:43.744 - 01:17:48.500, Speaker C: Right. If all they do is go down, you're essentially taking on more risk for less reward.
01:17:49.240 - 01:18:18.350, Speaker B: Ben, this has been extremely insightful, and it's nice to, I really appreciate somebody that can draw these charts and focus on the charts while also connecting to the fundamentals. I remember, and you were probably like this, too. Back when I was in my first cycle, in 2017, 2018, I would pull open blockfolio and check it roughly 70 times a day. For somebody that has chart addiction or just like, they can't pull their eyes away from their charts, what advice would you have to somebody like this?
01:18:19.120 - 01:19:03.144, Speaker C: Yeah, I think a lot of times these short term price movements are just noise. And the likelihood that someone's going to want to sell today anyways is pretty low, usually, because a lot of us just, we're hoddlers at heart, right? And people just kind of hold on for dear life and whatnot. Look, you can look at it all you want, but at the end of the day, it's an investment, and I think people should look at it like an investment. Gambling is something that I think it's easy to get into and call it investing, but it's actually gambling. Right? These micro caps are gambling using a lot of leverage, or any leverage. It's gambling. There's a difference between gambling and investing.
01:19:03.144 - 01:19:53.464, Speaker C: And if you believe ethereum or bitcoin or your favorite altcoins, if you believe in their mission and what they're doing and where they're headed, then what happens today is just completely irrelevant. Right? And again, it's a great time to be saying this, because as I'm saying this, bitcoin is now at below $60,000. But again, I'm sure there's a lot of people out there glued to their screens and wondering what's going on. It wasn't even that long ago, literally like two months ago, bitcoin was at. Is the market down this week? By about eight or 9% yeah, it is. But if you go back a couple of years, think about all the stress that you probably had on this red candle, right? Or this red candle here, or this red candle. Or this red candle.
01:19:53.464 - 01:20:21.396, Speaker C: Or this red candle. All that stress that you probably had every day watching the chart 70 times a day. Who cares, right? You're not here for the little bunny hills. You don't really care about that. You're generally here to see the asset class trend higher with time. And I believe that's what it's doing. So, look, while there definitely are time periods where we go down and stuff, I would still argue that the general direction is up and it's going to remain up for a while.
01:20:21.396 - 01:20:56.496, Speaker C: Could we come back down and test some lower levels again? Of course, right? I mean, you will never hear me say that bitcoin has to go parabolic in q four. I think it's honestly absurd that so many people think it does. But you'll never hear me say that. I think it's better to just invest responsibly to get positions and assets you like and you want to have in your portfolio. And then just to wait for the bubble to happen, because it's only a matter of time before another bubble happens. Whenever you have the next narrative or whatever it's going to be, there's going to be another bubble. There's going to be more retail coming into the space at some point.
01:20:56.496 - 01:21:06.820, Speaker C: So until then, I think it makes more sense to just keep your head down, invest in the projects you want to be in, and be patient.
01:21:07.640 - 01:21:19.300, Speaker A: Benjamin Cowan telling the bankless story through charts. I love it. This has been a fantastic conversation. Ben, thanks so much. Where can folks check out your YouTube and find out more about into the crypto verse?
