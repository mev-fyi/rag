00:00:00.090 - 00:00:00.926, Speaker C: DFI is the.
00:00:00.948 - 00:00:01.818, Speaker A: Same as Wall street.
00:00:01.834 - 00:00:02.542, Speaker C: You crypto people.
00:00:02.596 - 00:00:05.706, Speaker A: You'Re saying that this is a new thing, that it's more democratic finance.
00:00:05.738 - 00:00:06.830, Speaker C: That it's here for the people.
00:00:06.900 - 00:00:07.678, Speaker A: That's not true.
00:00:07.764 - 00:00:08.702, Speaker C: What would you say to.
00:00:08.756 - 00:00:09.578, Speaker A: This criticism?
00:00:09.674 - 00:00:40.774, Speaker B: Any new technology has people that want to speculate on it, right? But there are probably 100 million people that actually use crypto in real world situations every day, transmitting money across borders or whatever. And then there are some people that are speculating on it. And that's just the nature of a new technology, people who believe are going to want to invest in the future of it. So you're going to see that. And we've seen that already for twelve years, right? There's been bubbles, there's been busts, but blockchain prices normally end up higher than they began each cycle. So I don't think the fact that there are speculators isn't anything new or in any way negative. It happened in the.com
00:00:40.774 - 00:00:48.530, Speaker B: boom. It happened in all kinds of booms that we've had over centuries, basically. So the fact that people want to speculate is not in and of itself a negative.
