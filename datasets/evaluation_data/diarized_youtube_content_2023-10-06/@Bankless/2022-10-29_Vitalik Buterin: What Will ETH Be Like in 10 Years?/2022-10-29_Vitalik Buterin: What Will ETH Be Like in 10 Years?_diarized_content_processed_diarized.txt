00:00:00.090 - 00:00:25.346, Speaker A: So, Ethereum, in 2032, you have a node. Your node runs on your phone every 12 seconds or 32 seconds or whatever number we agree on, you download 3.6 megabytes of data, you hash it, you do a couple of elliptic curve equations to check a snark. That's it. You know, the block is valid, wait 12 seconds, get 33.6 megabytes of data, hash it, do some elliptic curve operations, verify the snark, and valid. 12 seconds later, data hash, elliptic curve check, valid.
00:00:25.346 - 00:00:38.498, Speaker A: The whole process just becomes incredibly sleek and seamless, to the point where literally a phone could even do it right because it's incredibly light on computation. The only thing that it's heavy on is data. And data just happens to be the thing that phones are increasingly getting insanely.
00:00:38.514 - 00:00:39.366, Speaker UNK: Good at and will get even.
00:00:39.388 - 00:00:45.570, Speaker A: Better at over the next ten years. That, to me, is what I see the final goal being from a yeah, protocol standpoint.
