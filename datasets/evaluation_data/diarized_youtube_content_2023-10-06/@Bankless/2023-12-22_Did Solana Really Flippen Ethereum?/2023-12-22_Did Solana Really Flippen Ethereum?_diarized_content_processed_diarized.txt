00:00:00.090 - 00:00:09.680, Speaker A: Oh, you're gonna make me say this? Yeah. I don't want a lot of slipped ethereum. In what metric? And what is our take on that?
00:00:12.930 - 00:00:24.062, Speaker B: Bankless nation? It's roll up time, and I think, David, this is our last roll up of 2023. So happy holidays to the bankless nation, wherever you are listening. Man, it's been a crazy year, hasn't it?
00:00:24.196 - 00:00:35.410, Speaker A: It certainly has. It's our last weekly roll up. Next week, the bankless listeners are going to get the yearly roll up we're doing the whole entire year, and that's going to ship, of course, the last week of December.
00:00:35.490 - 00:00:46.970, Speaker B: And we know that because we pre recorded it this week. We are not working during the holidays, but during next week, actually, I think we're releasing four podcasts, something we have some pent up.
00:00:47.040 - 00:00:52.426, Speaker A: You know, it's a bull market. When we are doing, minimum, one podcast a day and sometimes the boys doing.
00:00:52.528 - 00:01:01.518, Speaker B: Two, you will have so much content, so much content unwrapping presence next week. So I hope you guys enjoy. But, David, we got a packed agenda today. What's first on our list?
00:01:01.604 - 00:01:13.714, Speaker A: Inscriptions have had their exodus from bitcoin and now are infecting every single chain that it can get its hands on, one by one by one. The inscription locuses are taking down chains. We're going to talk about that.
00:01:13.832 - 00:01:19.206, Speaker B: A big clog, I guess, like clogging up your drain pipes. I want to hear your take on that.
00:01:19.228 - 00:01:20.710, Speaker A: I don't think that one's going to stick.
00:01:21.770 - 00:01:27.042, Speaker B: We also have commercials. Hopefully these stick. Bitwise released its first bitcoin ETF.
00:01:27.106 - 00:01:48.478, Speaker A: I think the big question is how many millions of people are going to see the bitcoin ETF? But after that, Elizabeth Warren writes a nasty gram to our entire industry, telling to us to stop defending ourselves and just bow down and take it. Why are you fighting back? Why are you fighting back? Then we got a ton of crypto native stuff to talk about as well. What else is coming up?
00:01:48.484 - 00:02:08.434, Speaker B: Eigen layer, they hit a billion in ETH total locked value. So restaking that narrative is heating up. I think we'll see a lot more of that in 2024. I know we got some episodes tuned. David, we got to tell them before we get in about this fantastic wallet. This is a next generation wallet because it's based on smart contract technology. Tell them what it is.
00:02:08.472 - 00:02:35.902, Speaker A: The word smart in it. Yeah. So the Ambire team is launching its V two wallet. Ambire was one of the first smart contract wallets to really ship a wallet into mainnet into users hands. They're launching V two, updated for the year 2024 through a browser extension. So browser extension wallet, like we already know, except when you click on it, you get a smart contract wallet, not a vanilla EOA wallet. So entering, of course, the world of account abstraction and smart contract wallets, there's a bunch of things that ambire wallet can do for you.
00:02:35.902 - 00:02:46.702, Speaker A: If you want to feel the power of a smart contract wallet. There is a link in the show notes, bankless ccambier. Probably just go click the link.
00:02:46.836 - 00:03:07.838, Speaker B: Definitely go click the link. This is something you're going to want to test. It also works with the hardware wallets, too. So treasure ledger grid plus lattice, whatever hardware wallet you have. David, we got something else to mention too, because right now you're in the state of Washington. So you're just outside of Seattle somewhere, I believe, recording from your childhood room, I think, although you correct me, not your childhood.
00:03:07.954 - 00:03:09.210, Speaker A: Crypto childhood.
00:03:10.190 - 00:03:21.710, Speaker B: Wow. A different kind of childhood where you're maybe born again into crypto. Oh God. A little too religious here. Okay. But you're going to Argentina, is that right?
00:03:21.860 - 00:03:23.066, Speaker A: Tell us about it, David.
00:03:23.098 - 00:03:25.962, Speaker B: How can we experience bankless in Argentina?
00:03:26.106 - 00:03:51.006, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm so glad you asked. There is a bankless meetup in Argentina, Friday, January 5, TBD, on that date, that is the current date that is locked in. But we have 100 slots, and in the 1 hour that I sent this invitation out, he's telling you. So we might need to move it a different day. TBD might be. If it's not Friday, it's Thursday. No.
00:03:51.006 - 00:04:08.918, Speaker A: Okay, so on Friday you can't rent out the whole bar. You can only rent out a part of the bar, which is what we did on Thursday. We could rent out the whole bar anyways, either on Friday. The current time is Friday, January 5, from 07:00 p.m. To 10:00 p.m. At the wine bar in Palermo. In the Palermo neighborhood.
00:04:08.918 - 00:04:13.018, Speaker A: If we get so much more demand, which I'm guessing we are, we might move it to Thursday, might ask to.
00:04:13.024 - 00:04:16.126, Speaker B: Move it to guys, because David is spending, I believe, what, two weeks in.
00:04:16.148 - 00:04:23.718, Speaker A: January, Argentina, one week in Buenos Aires, one week in El Chal ten, one week in Toros del Pane.
00:04:23.834 - 00:04:26.894, Speaker B: Well, I really want to hear what the crypto scene is like in Argentina.
00:04:26.942 - 00:04:35.570, Speaker A: Because I know Yodos, Quantos, Personas, escucha, Abanklis and Buenos Aires, pero apparently mucho Personas.
00:04:36.470 - 00:04:53.850, Speaker B: Yes, absolutely. So if you want to see David in Argentina, go check that out. All right. David, let's talk about the markets this week, shall we? Bitcoin price. And this is like the year ender, because I don't think we give our up to date prices in the yearly roll up.
00:04:54.000 - 00:05:00.118, Speaker A: Yesterday's prices in roll up today, we give today's prices, which is actually yesterday for current listeners.
00:05:00.214 - 00:05:03.238, Speaker B: Oh, wow. So once again, once again, we don't.
00:05:03.254 - 00:05:04.214, Speaker A: Know why we do this section.
00:05:04.262 - 00:05:15.710, Speaker B: We don't know why we do it. But thanks to Kraken, because I know these charts are looking really good and they've held us up all year. You know what? Let's just salute Kraken. Salute these charts. Salute our progress.
00:05:16.210 - 00:05:21.966, Speaker A: If you want to scroll out, you need to set larger candles. You're at the 1 hour candles. You need to go to one day candles.
00:05:21.998 - 00:05:32.102, Speaker B: Thank you, David. Here we go. One day. This is what, 20. I like the charts, the yearly charts. This is what 2023 looked like for us exclusively up.
00:05:32.156 - 00:05:41.894, Speaker A: That is an up chart. We started at 16k up. We started the year with a short squeeze from 16K over to, like, $23,000 on bitcoin.
00:05:41.942 - 00:05:44.540, Speaker B: Look at us now. Look at us now. They totally look at us.
00:05:45.310 - 00:05:47.690, Speaker A: $44,000 bitcoin.
00:05:48.430 - 00:05:53.022, Speaker B: Great year for bitcoin. And how was that on the week, David? Tell me about that, because I know that's important.
00:05:53.076 - 00:06:09.874, Speaker A: In the roll up, we got some muted response at the top of the market cap stack. Bitcoin up 1% on the week, but 1% a week. Can't complain about that. Bitcoin starting the week at 4003, 100. Ending the week at 43, 500, up a modest 1%. We love it.
00:06:09.912 - 00:06:25.938, Speaker B: We love it. I think that's about 153% on the year. So big year for bitcoin here. Let's give the same treatment to Ethereum. I'm going to zoom all the way out on the Kraken charts here. Okay. The beginning of January 2023, we were 1200 ETH.
00:06:25.938 - 00:06:33.818, Speaker B: Price just above. Not lows, but just above 1000 ETH. Now, where are we?
00:06:33.984 - 00:06:43.718, Speaker A: We are at $2,200. So a choppy, crabby up chart for ETH. That is an uppy crab pattern right there.
00:06:43.744 - 00:06:45.870, Speaker B: Makes me a little crabby. I feel like it should be hired.
00:06:49.330 - 00:07:21.750, Speaker A: Why is ETH, like, not following the market, not trending with the market? I mean, there's 10,000 different answers. One of the answers is that it overperformed versus the market in 2022. ETH was the best asset to hold in 2022. You lost the least amount of money if you were down further in the market cap, you lost more money. And so part of east lack of performance in 2023 was because it was overperformed in 2022. It was the consensus bet to hold in 2022. And then as soon as risk went on the table, there was like, why would you buy ETH? Everyone already has ETH.
00:07:21.750 - 00:07:43.038, Speaker A: It's not going to pump, like, some of the low market cap stack. And then also, Celsius has been. I think we're going to talk about this. Celsius has been dumping, like, a bajillion dollars, $250,000,000 of ETH over the last week. And Michael Taylor has been buying a ton of bitcoin. And so ETH can just not capture a narrative. It can't capture a wind.
00:07:43.124 - 00:08:03.026, Speaker B: I think some people would look at this and be like, guys, you're 80% up. Be thankful for that. People in the stock market, people, you're like, you almost doubled. Why are you upset about that? But, yeah, I think ethos had an okay year, but not a strong year for sure. So we'll have to see whether that's.
00:08:03.058 - 00:08:14.330, Speaker A: I mean, think about this. Bitcoin started the year at $16,000, ending the year at $43,000. That's almost a three x, almost a tripling to say, like, ETH almost doubled. These are, like, different numbers.
00:08:14.480 - 00:08:18.300, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. Okay, how about the ratio? Down or up?
00:08:18.830 - 00:08:25.630, Speaker A: Little down. 51. It touched 0.5 touches. Basically the lowest that has been in a long ass time.
00:08:25.700 - 00:08:45.970, Speaker B: Nobody's looking at the ratio except for the bankless weekly roll up. Now, total crypto market cap, 1.7 trillion. So the lows, if I recall it, January 1 of 2023, were about 800 billion, maybe 800 and 4850 billion or so. So that's like a nice doubling on total crypto market cap.
00:08:46.040 - 00:08:47.554, Speaker A: More than a doubling. Yeah.
00:08:47.752 - 00:08:52.722, Speaker B: I mean, pretty impressive. How about L2s? What did we see in terms of growth?
00:08:52.786 - 00:09:17.194, Speaker A: Layer Twos had an astounding year in 2023. At the start of 2023, we had $3 billion deposited onto L2s. We currently have $16 billion. Outperformed most metrics in terms of dollar value out of anything that you can see. And then activity, actually, like usage of L2s, I think, also did a nice old, like, seven X. We are currently at seven ethereums. Setting new highs thanks to inscriptions.
00:09:17.194 - 00:09:25.786, Speaker A: We'll talk about that in a second. But setting new highs, and I would say accelerating highs in terms of L2 activity dominance.
00:09:25.978 - 00:09:35.902, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, tell me about the movers, because we got some lower down the stack. Market cap movers. We talk about a couple of tokens. Which one do you want to pick out this week? David?
00:09:35.966 - 00:09:49.830, Speaker A: The one that is unequivocally at the top of the chart. Ryan, this week is, say, with a 50% move week over week and 140% move on the 30 day time period. So say, what's the market cap of say right now?
00:09:49.980 - 00:09:50.678, Speaker B: It is.
00:09:50.764 - 00:09:59.222, Speaker A: Scroll up a little bit. Fully diluted valuation, $4 billion. $4 billion with a float of $900 million. So like four to one ish float.
00:09:59.286 - 00:10:01.260, Speaker B: What is one of these people don't remember?
00:10:02.270 - 00:10:32.840, Speaker A: I think it's a parallelized EVM. I think they just pivoted into being a parallelized Ethereum virtual machine chain. And there's a crop of these showing up recently. And I kind of think it's going to be a pretty hot narrative in 2024, layer ones that are using the Ethereum virtual machine, but they've deconstructed it and then recomposed it to be just far more performant, far more parallelized. Monad is doing this, say, pivoted to doing this because they realized the Monad strategy was correct. And I think that's going to be a big thing.
00:10:33.370 - 00:11:06.038, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. I think we'll get Monad sometime in the first half of 2024, which will be another one to this list. And you could see kind of the justification for it. To me, it kind of flows down from Ethereum. So you have Ethereum, what's that, 250,000,000,000 or so market cap. And what is Salana now? Is that about 40 billion market cap, something like 37, 38, 37. And then you have say over here, and people are like, well, if this is like Salana, but faster, an EVM, and it's only 4 billion.
00:11:06.074 - 00:11:10.158, Speaker A: Everything we like about the EVM and none of the baggage of the EVM.
00:11:10.334 - 00:11:46.798, Speaker B: So if it was valued at Salana valuation, it would be a nice ten X. Right? And that's how these types of markets work. Now that you have a narrative which seems to have some product market fit narrative like fundamentals, who knows? You can't really separate the two during the bull market in this way. It has to kind of burn off during the bear. But yeah, you see this look, they're benchmarking Salana and they're saying, yeah, Salana does 10,000 TPs, we do 20,000 parallelized. Yeah, it's a high TPS layer one season. That's what it's been for the last couple of months.
00:11:46.964 - 00:11:55.822, Speaker A: Moving on back to bitcoin. You saw this commercial going out this week, Ryan. This is a commercial from Matt Hogan from Bitwise doing.
00:11:55.876 - 00:11:56.862, Speaker B: He's been on the podcast.
00:11:56.926 - 00:12:06.690, Speaker A: He's been on the podcast a couple of times. I actually learned a few things about ETF and stock market commercials. You can't actually advertise the ETF. You can't say buy the ETF.
00:12:06.770 - 00:12:07.062, Speaker B: Really?
00:12:07.116 - 00:12:21.694, Speaker A: You can't show the ticker on the commercial at all. You can't advertise the, you know, securities regulations, can't sell financial products on TV commercials. We can sell pharmaceutical drugs here in America on TV commercials, but you can't sell financial instruments.
00:12:21.762 - 00:12:23.878, Speaker B: Yeah. Because, anyway, finance is dangerous.
00:12:23.974 - 00:12:39.200, Speaker A: Yeah. Right. Okay, so with that context, here is the bitwise bitcoin commercial. It's going to be a little bit rough for you podcast listeners, but we'll unpack it afterwards. You know what's interesting these days?
00:12:39.810 - 00:12:55.310, Speaker B: Bitcoin. Look for bitwise, my friends. Hey, David. It feels good to have the most interesting man in the world chilling our bags right now. I gotta say, that's a good commercial. Well done, bitwise.
00:12:55.470 - 00:13:05.618, Speaker A: Just good branding. Bitwise. It's a great name. It's a great name for normies to understand. Bit, as in bitcoin wise, as in wisdom. Like, this is a financial word. This matters.
00:13:05.714 - 00:13:07.270, Speaker B: Hey, you can't pick a favorite.
00:13:09.050 - 00:13:12.710, Speaker A: Like, yes, I can. I pick a favorite chain. I can pick a favorite ETF.
00:13:12.790 - 00:13:18.394, Speaker B: Oh, really? You're supposed to be more agnostic, more neutral than that. What about Vanek? They got the hoddle meme, remember?
00:13:18.432 - 00:13:20.586, Speaker A: We just had Matt Siegel, Van X. Great.
00:13:20.688 - 00:13:22.282, Speaker B: Okay, but are they your favorite?
00:13:22.346 - 00:13:23.498, Speaker A: How about Blackrock?
00:13:23.594 - 00:13:25.022, Speaker B: What if Larry Fink comes on?
00:13:25.076 - 00:13:33.200, Speaker A: Blackrock is going to be just fine with or without my support. They don't need moi at all. They are the world.
00:13:33.890 - 00:13:35.250, Speaker B: I like Matt Hogan.
00:13:35.750 - 00:13:37.490, Speaker A: We like Matt. We like bitwise.
00:13:38.070 - 00:13:43.474, Speaker B: Yeah. A message to all the bitcoin ETFs out here. You have to compete for our love. Yes.
00:13:43.512 - 00:13:45.330, Speaker A: Okay. With commercials.
00:13:45.750 - 00:14:04.566, Speaker B: With commercials, or whatever mechanism you have. Okay, David, here's a question for you. As we end the year, phishing schemes have really picked up, like, people trying to pickpocket your crypto wallet and doing it badly. How much do you think has been stolen the last couple of years by phishing attacks on crypto?
00:14:04.678 - 00:14:13.520, Speaker A: Last two years? 2022 and 2023. Over 100 million. Over 100 million.
00:14:13.970 - 00:14:22.270, Speaker B: You're right. Over 100 million. And that feels like a very safe bet. It's ten X, that it's $1 billion. Okay. Drained. So there's actually.
00:14:22.340 - 00:14:26.434, Speaker A: This is looking at the notes, $1 billion since May of 2021.
00:14:26.552 - 00:14:28.178, Speaker B: Okay, so that's two and a half years.
00:14:28.184 - 00:14:31.860, Speaker A: It was 800 plus million in 2022 and 2023.
00:14:32.710 - 00:14:36.840, Speaker B: Okay, what did I say? That's different.
00:14:38.570 - 00:14:41.350, Speaker A: We can just run with that. You can just take the correction.
00:14:43.210 - 00:14:46.546, Speaker B: I don't want to take corrections. No, that's out of scope.
00:14:46.738 - 00:14:49.474, Speaker A: Get corrected, bro. Live.
00:14:49.612 - 00:15:03.626, Speaker B: Just take the l. Take the l. Shut up, Ryan. Okay. Yeah. So here's the interesting stat about that, David. There's actually more last year in terms of total value drained than this year, which it feels like it's really intensified this year.
00:15:03.626 - 00:15:06.558, Speaker B: But last year was about 500 million. This year, it was 370.
00:15:06.644 - 00:15:08.798, Speaker A: Yeah, but last year, our price assets were priced higher.
00:15:08.884 - 00:15:26.766, Speaker B: Exactly. So they probably stole more in units but got less value. Maybe that was it. The largest phishing scam so far was $44.3 million. This is crazy. And according to the chain analysis, by the way, this billion dollar figure is just the tip of the iceberg.
00:15:26.766 - 00:15:34.338, Speaker B: So there's a lot that might not actually be measured in these estimates. It's a problem we have to solve, man. It's a problem crypto has to solve.
00:15:34.434 - 00:16:02.430, Speaker A: The worst thing about these numbers, like, okay, 2023, there was $376,000,000 fished. 2022, $516,000,000 fished. Sadly, phishing attacks are also, like, long tail attacks. So they're not like, fat tail attacks where, like, the wormhole bridge gets hacked and then jump capital spends a billion dollars to bail them out. These are, like, individuals. These are individuals clicking links on Twitter in discord. These are individuals losing money.
00:16:02.430 - 00:16:05.962, Speaker A: It's not. Sadly, it is, like, the worst type of loss.
00:16:06.026 - 00:16:22.150, Speaker B: Well, you can imagine when AI gets combined in here, where you could have somebody, like, deep fake call you and pretend to be, like your mom or your grandmother or something like this. You can really ramp up the scale of these attacks. So my method is I just don't trust anybody.
00:16:22.300 - 00:16:24.678, Speaker A: Don't trust anyone. Not even you.
00:16:24.764 - 00:16:32.282, Speaker B: Yeah, you shouldn't trust me. Somebody could be deep faking you. Log on fake Ryan on a zoom and deep fake me.
00:16:32.416 - 00:16:52.526, Speaker A: We already have prediction for 2024. Somebody will use AI and all of the data of you and me on YouTube to create, recreate video about, just, like, how everyone should click this link and ape into this one airdrop or something like this. And that will go out on Twitter, and it will be our likeness, and that will probably happen in 2024.
00:16:52.628 - 00:16:54.690, Speaker B: Will we get sued for that? That'll be.
00:16:54.760 - 00:16:57.614, Speaker A: Oh, God, maybe because of our likeness.
00:16:57.662 - 00:17:08.798, Speaker B: I don't think can't get sued for that. Well, they would start with Vitalik. We're far less trustworthy than Vitalik, but maybe with a long tail of phishing deepfakes.
00:17:08.894 - 00:17:26.540, Speaker A: This is probably a global call to action for people who are about to have a bunch of text messages from their friends. Hey, what should I do when I get into crypto? Give them your answer and then tell them. And if you're not careful, you will be phished. And you need to be very cautious. That should come with your onboarding statements to your friends and family.
00:17:26.910 - 00:17:35.678, Speaker B: It's a big ux problem for sure. David, let's talk about a flipping of a different kind. You teased it during the intro and you say it.
00:17:35.764 - 00:17:54.370, Speaker A: Salana has recently flipped Ethereum in Dex volumes. So I think on Tuesday or Monday or Tuesday of this week, Salana had $1.5 billion in total Dex volumes on chain, and Ethereum had 1.1. This has since reverted. Ethereum has 1.6 currently, and Salana has 1.59 currently.
00:17:54.370 - 00:18:19.626, Speaker A: So pretty close, actually. Pretty neck and neck. So I guess congrats to the Salana Dex ecosystem for flipping volumes. Now, I will say, here is my caveat to that. When you have extremely low fees, painting a million dollars in volume costs very, very little. That's the feature of the Solana blockchain. And I think we're going to enter this bull market and all these people are going to compete on narratives and stuff.
00:18:19.626 - 00:19:08.758, Speaker A: And not all narratives are apples to apples. Like, Solana has less TVL, less stables on Solana, and it's doing more movement per stablecoin on Solana than on other chains, which is cool because that makes it a great payments chain. But having low TVl makes you not a great defi chain because that means your liquidity is not that great. You get to have a lot of Dex volumes on a lot of low supply of coins because your transactions are very cheap. And so just brute forcing these comparisons to be apples to apples. We need to take facts and circumstances in like, I can go take $500, I can buy one USDC and I can spend all that $500 on that, spending that one USDC, and I can create some $10 million of volume sending that one USDC around. And so these are some of the nuances between these two chains.
00:19:08.758 - 00:19:27.022, Speaker A: Not to diminish or belittle the fact that that's like $1.6 of volume going on salona Dexes, that's a number. And if we want to be sophisticated in our understanding for how these chains work, we need to understand that differences in gas fees do create differences in how these metrics need to be evaluated.
00:19:27.166 - 00:19:50.198, Speaker B: Yeah, I think all that's true. And it's also true that this is a pretty massive accomplishment for Solana. And the first time ever it's actually surpassed Ethereum in terms of volume and all those points. I think when transaction fees are low, there's obviously a lot of wash trading that could happen. So you can't take one of these metrics and be like, this is the one. This is the one. But I don't think sensible people really do that.
00:19:50.198 - 00:20:00.214, Speaker B: I also think the other thing you need to take into account, of course, is all of the other L2s. It's interesting that there's like ethereum, arbitrum and Ethereum and Arbitrum.
00:20:00.342 - 00:20:04.090, Speaker A: Salana versus the Ethereum layer one. Oh, they're not including Ethereum L2s.
00:20:04.250 - 00:20:06.094, Speaker B: It's still a big freaking deal, right?
00:20:06.132 - 00:20:11.994, Speaker A: Because Salana, there's $700 million of trading on arbitrum that would put Ethereum between, add all the other L2s.
00:20:12.042 - 00:20:34.738, Speaker B: Like part of the problem with Ethereum narrative right now. It's like it's kind of fractured across all of these sub brands like Arbitrum is Ethereum. But people don't see that. They see just arbitram or they see optimism. Anyway, it's a big move from Solana. And that's not the only flipping, David. Actually, Sol price, okay, the price of Sol just passed the price of XRP.
00:20:34.738 - 00:20:36.054, Speaker B: We like Ripple right now.
00:20:36.092 - 00:20:41.266, Speaker A: We like that. We like being on top of the bank chain. That is deserved for sure. Yeah.
00:20:41.308 - 00:20:45.114, Speaker B: Why do you like that? Because you think XRP is a security, David. Is that what you think?
00:20:45.232 - 00:20:50.470, Speaker A: No, I was just saying coin by banks for banks. I don't enjoy ripple.
00:20:50.630 - 00:21:01.998, Speaker B: I've never understood why Ripple is valued. It's still valued at $33 billion. I wish I could say there's something there, but I don't know what's actually there.
00:21:02.084 - 00:21:04.606, Speaker A: Salana 100% deserves to be above ripple.
00:21:04.718 - 00:21:06.210, Speaker B: Okay, so it's number five.
00:21:06.280 - 00:21:06.802, Speaker A: Number five.
00:21:06.856 - 00:21:31.914, Speaker B: And by the way, maybe closing in on Ethereum. It's got a cool eight x to go before it. So we'll see what's in store for 2024. Meanwhile, Celsius is absolutely dumping on you. ETH holder dumping on you. Catch a break on chain data shows that Celsius, you remember Celsius? Alex Machinsky's old scam. Banks are not your friend.
00:21:31.914 - 00:21:55.034, Speaker B: And apparently neither was Celsius. Celsius was your worst enemy. They are now selling as a result of their bankruptcy, a lot of their ETH. And I say their ETH, but it's really customer deposit, your ETH, so they're dumping on you with your own asset. Wow. Insult to entry. Over the past 30 days, they sold 243,000,000 ETH.
00:21:55.034 - 00:22:05.090, Speaker B: And the good news is they got to run out sometime. I think they're getting closer, although they don't have a stat. Do you know how much more ETH they have to dump on us, David?
00:22:05.430 - 00:22:12.598, Speaker A: I don't know. I kind of assumed that they would be done, but what the hell do I know? $250,000,000 is a pretty good amount.
00:22:12.764 - 00:22:26.918, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true. And I also know that the FTX bankruptcy has a lot of assets that will be available on the market here soon. So some of the bankruptcies are getting cleaned up. Yeah. So what do you think of all that? Is this part of the downward pressure that ETH is feeling?
00:22:27.014 - 00:23:02.614, Speaker A: Well, yeah. So the bitcoin ETH ratio, why is that down so bad? Because Michael Saylor bought, like, $800 million of bitcoin in the last quarter. Why is ETH not able to catch a bid? Oh, because Celsius just sold $240,000,000 of ETH in the past 30 days. ETH is just taking just wallop after wallop after wallop. And there's this actually fantastic synergy for the Salana narrative. Whereas Salana is actually still pretty small in comparison to Ethereum. It's got a ton of energy, but in the grand scheme of things, it's kind of still just like a spec.
00:23:02.614 - 00:23:33.134, Speaker A: And so it's not ether that's vacating ether going to Solana. But it does appear like that in the simultaneous nature of Michael Saylor buying a f ton of bitcoin and the ETH BTC ratio going down and Celsius selling all of his ether. And so the ETH is just underperforming. Meanwhile, coincidentally, Solana is having a renaissance of its narrative. And I think all of these things are lined up to make ether the currently, probably the most hated asset I have ever seen in the crypto meta in my entire time.
00:23:33.172 - 00:23:45.474, Speaker B: Well, people say that I had that tweet earlier this week, and people said that Ethereum has a persecution complex. It's still number two. It's still $250,000,000,000.
00:23:45.672 - 00:23:57.666, Speaker A: Yeah, that's like them playing both sides, right? When it comes time for east to be defended, they're like, why are you defending yourself? You're number two. But it's just like if you go onto Twitter, just like it's totally universal.
00:23:57.778 - 00:24:07.514, Speaker B: I think that 2024 will kind of be the year. This is just partway through the story, so let's see what happens in 2024 for sure. David, what do we have coming up next?
00:24:07.632 - 00:24:20.842, Speaker A: Coming up next, inscription. Locuses are out of control. Plague you all. The chains hopping from chain to chain to chain, heating them dry as they go. That's a bad image. Second up, Elizabeth Warren. Even worse image with a holiday.
00:24:20.842 - 00:24:33.906, Speaker A: Nasty, grim for all of us here in crypto. But before all of that, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible, especially Kraken, who's been with us throughout 2023 and is fighting the SEC. And we appreciate them so much for it.
00:24:34.008 - 00:24:35.246, Speaker B: And it will also be our favorite.
00:24:35.278 - 00:25:07.198, Speaker A: Exchange in 2024 as well. If you do not have an account with Kraken, what are you waiting for? What are you in the show? Notes Kraken knows crypto. Kraken's been in the crypto game for over a decade, and as one of the largest and most trusted exchanges in the industry, Kraken is on the journey with all of us to see what crypto can be. Human history is a story of progress. It's part of us, hardwired. We're designed to seek change everywhere, to improve, to strive. And if anything can be improved, why not finance? Crypto is a financial system designed with the modern world in mind.
00:25:07.198 - 00:25:28.846, Speaker A: Instant, permissionless, and 24/7 it's not perfect and nothing ever will be perfect. But crypto is a world changing technology at a time when the world needs it the most. That's the Kraken mission, to accelerate the global adoption of cryptocurrency so that you and the rest of the world can achieve financial freedom and inclusion. Head on over to kraken.com slash bankless to see what crypto can be. Not investment advice. Crypto trading involves risk of loss.
00:25:28.846 - 00:25:52.022, Speaker A: Cryptocurrency services are provided to us and US territory customers by payword Ventures e PVI. Doing business as Kraken Cello is the mobile first EVM compatible carbon negative blockchain built for the real world. And now something big is happening. Introducing the celo L2. It's a game changing proposal that's going to bring Cello's rapidly growing ecosystem home to Ethereum. Vitalik has shared its excitement for the cello L2 on the cello forum. So has Ben Jones from optimism.
00:25:52.022 - 00:26:23.190, Speaker A: But why? The cello L2 will bring huge advantages, like a decentralized sequencer offchain data availability, and one block finality. What does all that mean? Rock solid security, a trustless bridge to Ethereum, and more. Real world use cases for Ethereum without compromise, and real world adoption is happening. Active addresses on sello have grown over 500% in the last six months. With the cello L2 gas fees will stay low, and you can even pay for gas using ERC 20 tokens. But cello is a community governed protocol. This means that cello needs you to weigh in and make your voice heard.
00:26:23.190 - 00:27:17.746, Speaker A: Join the conversation in the cello forum, follow@cello.org on Twitter and visit cello.org to shape the future of ethereum arbitrum is accelerating the web3 landscape with a suite of secure Ethereum scaling solutions Hundreds of projects have already deployed onto arbitrum one with a flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystem, Arbitrum Nova is quickly becoming a web3 gaming hub, and social dapps like Reddit are also calling arbitrum home. And now Arbitrum orbit allows you to use Arbitrum's secure scaling technology to build your own layer three, giving you access to interoperable, customizable permissions with dedicated throughput.

00:27:17.778 - 00:27:27.030, Speaker B: Inscriptions they're invading everywhere. They're clogging up our chains. David what are inscriptions, and why are they taking down multiple chains this week and causing massive gas spikes?
00:27:27.190 - 00:28:00.210, Speaker A: So inscriptions were the ordinals phenomenon that came out of bitcoin, where you could write arbitrary data through a single satoshi, which unlocked a bunch of cool features, starting with NFTs but really expanding from there. And then that same primitive has hopped to other chains where what are encryptions? They are just using chains as data availability chains. All chains are data availability chains to some degree. And they're writing encryptions. They're writing packets of data, bundles of data. What kind of data? Whatever data you want. Open ended, like turing complete, fully expressive.
00:28:00.210 - 00:28:19.834, Speaker A: And so they write just a packet of data onto chains. And it is very resource intensive because data is the thing that is expensive in the crypto world. So encryptions are just going from chain to chain to chain. Who's bringing them there? I don't really know. Kind of the free market. A lot of bots. A lot of this is bot activity, because there's no way that you can take down a chain without just having just.
00:28:19.834 - 00:28:20.794, Speaker A: It's basically spam.
00:28:20.842 - 00:28:41.086, Speaker B: It's basically. Well, you call it spam, but I don't know if that's entirely true. Right. So for bitcoin, famously, earlier this year, they've been using inscriptions for, like, a primitive Nft type of network and for containing BRC 20s, which are, like, bitcoin's kind of version of a token. And they've.
00:28:41.198 - 00:28:51.558, Speaker A: It's not spam. But when inscriptions show up on arbitram and then take down the chain two days later, that's because people just bought it the hell out of it. It's spam. If it's bots even know if I.
00:28:51.564 - 00:28:55.382, Speaker B: Could give you on that low utility, they pay the same gas fees that everybody else does.
00:28:55.516 - 00:29:12.522, Speaker A: Yeah, but the data that we're putting on chain is not. It's not interoperable. It's for one single one. Very few number of people care. Sure, Ryan, one person cares. But what does that do to the arbitram or Celestia or polygon? I think these even happen on Solana. These don't benefit.
00:29:12.522 - 00:29:14.430, Speaker A: There's no welfare for users here.
00:29:14.500 - 00:29:14.734, Speaker B: Right.
00:29:14.772 - 00:29:17.840, Speaker A: There's no global usefulness from these.
00:29:18.690 - 00:29:36.030, Speaker B: Not. Are you saying it's not out of bounds of the protocol's ability to do it, but you think it's outside of kind of like, some loose social contract of what's, quote unquote utility or what's valuable? And you're not shunning inscriptions, though. You're just, like, observing it and being like, that's annoying.
00:29:36.190 - 00:29:46.658, Speaker A: Yeah, it's an annoying thing. Like, if I took one ether and I took all of that gas money and just loaded up dick butts and placed that on the Ethereum layer, I'd.
00:29:46.674 - 00:29:47.462, Speaker B: Be annoyed by that.
00:29:47.516 - 00:29:49.494, Speaker A: That would be annoying. That would be annoying for me.
00:29:49.612 - 00:30:07.822, Speaker B: Okay. I didn't expect to get in a debate over inscription, so let's put that aside. I don't know how I feel about them, like, spam or not. Anyway, let's talk about what they've been doing on other chains, non bitcoin chains. So I said, they've taken down multiple chains. What's been going on over the past week?
00:30:07.956 - 00:30:32.886, Speaker A: So arbitram's sequencer briefly stopped working because they were just overloaded with transactions, specifically, like, just BRC 20 tokens on other chains, which is totally an anachronism, but whatever, avalanche, kronos, ZK, sync also experienced degradated performance. It briefly also hit Celestia as well. Celestia, I believe, stopped producing blocks, bro.
00:30:32.988 - 00:30:33.542, Speaker B: Wow.
00:30:33.676 - 00:31:14.370, Speaker A: I think that Celestia hasn't confirmed that, but people are like, yo, Celestia, block explorers stopped showing anything for like 20 minutes even plus. And so, yeah, it's kind of nuts. It's just like consuming the resources of all the chains in a very relatively cheap manner. It's kind of a question of resource pricing. Like, if we are spamming chains because data on these chains are cheap, but they're also taking down the chains, well, then either we need to figure out our shit or we need to increase the cost of data, one of these two things. But I think it's good because every single network is being stress tested at the moment in a live production real environment.
00:31:14.970 - 00:31:19.350, Speaker B: And it's not happening on Ethereum, though. Why is that? It's just too expensive.
00:31:19.850 - 00:31:23.430, Speaker A: It's too expensive. And Ethereum has perfect liveness.
00:31:24.090 - 00:31:34.470, Speaker B: So it's just people can't afford to spam the network using call data because there are higher value use cases that purchase that block space ahead of Ethereum.
00:31:34.630 - 00:31:41.866, Speaker A: Ethereum call data space is meant to be for L2 chains. And people who have a ton of.
00:31:41.888 - 00:31:52.122, Speaker B: ETH, high execution, like high TPS execution environments are definitely going to have to deal with this, right? This civil attack, it's very cheap to civil attack a chain with like, quote unquote spam.
00:31:52.186 - 00:32:20.838, Speaker A: Here's a tweet from Hunter from the arbitram team where he says arbitram one hit an all time high of 4.3 transactions in 24 hours. Today, that was 4.3 million transactions in one day from encryptions. And if you can go to like a L2 B and you'll see just a massive spike in activity. But cooler than numbers was the incredible support for that came from the other L2 s and layer ones for the arbitrum community. It feels like we're going to see more camaraderie as this bull market kicks into gear.
00:32:20.838 - 00:33:00.134, Speaker A: And yes, I'm excited. I hope so. Distributed sequencing, where rather than having one single extremely high performance sequencer and splitting that into like two or three or four, can maintain liveness while still having the vast majority of the scale, like reducing total scale total throughput by just like a few percentage points, but then also having 99.9% uptime. And like I said, this is ultimately going to be good for all chains because we're all going to get stress tested by bullshit before we get stress tested by normies with their bullshit. Meanwhile, just to say, just inscriptions started on bitcoin. Haven't left bitcoin either.
00:33:00.134 - 00:33:15.514, Speaker A: So inscriptions continuing to surge there as well. There's almost 300,000 unconfirmed transactions. Oh, there are 350,000 unconfirmed transactions in the bitcoin mempool. $37 per bitcoin. Their typical transaction in bitcoin over this last week.
00:33:15.552 - 00:33:18.060, Speaker B: But when they're on the bitcoin, David, they're not spam. Right?
00:33:18.910 - 00:33:21.894, Speaker A: Yeah. When they're on bitcoin, they're not. Bam.
00:33:21.942 - 00:33:23.980, Speaker B: We don't have to open that again because.
00:33:24.510 - 00:33:25.580, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:33:25.890 - 00:33:58.098, Speaker B: Let's move on. Gary Gensler and Elizabeth Warren, the anti crypto army, the generals in the anti crypto army, they are on the attack again this week. They couldn't even give us a break during the holidays, David. Can you believe that? So today the commission denied a petition for rulemaking filed on behalf of Coinbase. You remember a few months ago, Coinbase was just like, hey, please give us rules. Can you give us clarity on the rules? And SEC didn't respond. Denied providing clarity.
00:33:58.194 - 00:33:59.430, Speaker A: Held out to the buzzer.
00:33:59.510 - 00:34:08.730, Speaker B: Yeah. And then. So Coinbase was like, fine, we'll get a court to make you all right? And the court made the SEC respond.
00:34:09.470 - 00:34:17.310, Speaker A: They didn't make the SEC provide rules. They made the SEC respond to the inquiry about whether they are going to provide rules or not.
00:34:17.460 - 00:34:37.446, Speaker B: Yeah. And I don't know if you want to hear what Gary actually wrote, but he published his own sort of statement on the SEC website. First, existing laws and regulations apply to the crypto securities market. We already have the laws. Second, the SEC addresses the crypto securities market through rulemaking as well. We already do rulemaking. You already have the clarity that you need.
00:34:37.446 - 00:34:55.942, Speaker B: Third, it is important to maintain commission discretion in setting its own rulemaking priorities. You can't force us to do anything. Basically, you already have what you need and don't come to me asking for more clarity. That's what Gary is saying here. Thanks, Gary.
00:34:56.006 - 00:34:57.050, Speaker A: Thanks for the help.
00:34:57.200 - 00:35:15.934, Speaker B: We appreciate it. Merry Christmas. This is Paul Graywell from Coinbase saying today the SEC denied Coinbase's petition for rules for crypto after 18 months of silence. Oh, wow. It was 18 months, David. We went to the court to get the response that the law requires with appreciation for the third circuit. Later today, we'll again seek its help.
00:35:15.934 - 00:35:16.718, Speaker B: So they're going to.
00:35:16.804 - 00:35:19.458, Speaker A: They're not backing down again. We're going to keep going.
00:35:19.544 - 00:35:37.346, Speaker B: No, we actually want an answer. We actually deserve an answer from our regulators on just some basic rules for clarity on what's a security and what's not. CFTC is saying things are not securities. The SEC is saying something different. It won't really tell crypto what's a security. It's just dropping these charges.
00:35:37.538 - 00:36:03.406, Speaker A: Yeah. And Coinbase is really gearing up for the big fight. They're keeping the furnace warm with the SEC by continuing to not back down versus the SEC. But then also this week, they're also launching a super PAC. I don't know if it's fair to say Coinbase is launching it. A super PAC political action committee, a lobbyist group for crypto. So the fair Shake super PAC is a brand new political action committee on the scene and all of its affiliates representing the nation's crypto community.
00:36:03.406 - 00:36:24.050, Speaker A: And they have raised, Ryan, $78,000,000.20 companies and leading voices inside of the industry to support bipartisan crypto forward candidates in 2024. So $78 million, which is a large amount, going to help support crypto politicians raised in only Q four. Ryan.
00:36:24.130 - 00:36:25.990, Speaker B: Yeah, you got to do it.
00:36:26.060 - 00:37:02.180, Speaker A: It's a federal independent committee supporting candidates committing to securing the US as the home to innovators building the next generation of the Internet. So where did this $78 million come from? Andreessen, Horowitz, Brian Armstrong himself. Circle and Coinbase, of course, Kraken, framework ventures. Jump crypto, multicoin capital paradigm. So basically Coinbase and the VCs, which is great. And I think that is just the perfect role for these particular players, like the exchanges, Coinbase, Kraken and the like, the big leaders who have a lot of capital in this space, who have the most to gain and the most to lose. Right.
00:37:02.180 - 00:37:10.966, Speaker A: But also there's plenty of place for us as individuals, plenty of ways to help out. Go to standwithcrypto.org if you want to learn more.
00:37:11.068 - 00:37:23.146, Speaker B: Yeah, call your congressperson. Email congressperson. There's lots individuals can do. But I will say Elizabeth Warren did not like the industry fighting back against.
00:37:23.328 - 00:37:24.298, Speaker A: She didn't like this.
00:37:24.384 - 00:37:44.646, Speaker B: No. This is where we get to the nasty gram. And she sent this letter not only to Coinbase, but to the blockchain association, which is a crypto friendly education lobbyist group in DC. Kristen Smith there, who we've met before, is the CEO. She's fantastic. They also sent it to coin center. The same templated letter.
00:37:44.646 - 00:38:08.730, Speaker B: So here's Jerry Britto. He calls this coin center, received the same impertinent letter from Elizabeth Warren as the BA and Coinbase. That's the blockchain association. Read it for yourself to see what a bullying publicity stunt is. So I did read it for myself. Basically, Elizabeth Warren is saying crypto is being facilitated by Hamas for terrorism. That's super obvious.
00:38:08.730 - 00:38:11.126, Speaker B: And then she referred the Wall Street.
00:38:11.158 - 00:38:14.570, Speaker A: Journal article two months.
00:38:14.720 - 00:38:43.234, Speaker B: Freaking debunked many times. Anyway, she's like, look, crypto and terrorism, they're basically the same thing. And then she goes on and coin center, Coinbase. How dare you get people from the government, or used to be employed by the government working on your behalf. Right? Because she's upset that crypto has hired people from DC to push back against this, and she has asked for it.
00:38:43.272 - 00:38:45.954, Speaker A: By the way, how politics in America is this.
00:38:46.072 - 00:38:53.126, Speaker B: In every industry, it is how it works. I hate that we have to spend $80 million on a super pec. I hate that we have to do that.
00:38:53.148 - 00:38:55.074, Speaker A: Get money out of financing. Get financing.
00:38:55.122 - 00:39:00.538, Speaker B: But what's the alternative? Don't defend yourself because just the banks are doing it. Let them slap us around.
00:39:00.704 - 00:39:06.614, Speaker A: What do we do? Are doing the revolving door. The banks are supporting Liz with Warren.
00:39:06.742 - 00:39:07.082, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:07.136 - 00:39:08.922, Speaker A: At least we can't do it.
00:39:08.976 - 00:39:20.538, Speaker B: At least ours leads to individual rights. At least ours is fighting for digital civil liberties, like holding your own private key and running your own validator.
00:39:20.634 - 00:39:21.326, Speaker A: Okay.
00:39:21.508 - 00:39:40.502, Speaker B: Ours is actually doing something productive for the individual, not just fighting on behalf of a bunch of rights. Anyway, she asks in this letter that all of these organizations who she sent the letter to, tell them how many former military, civilian government officials, or members of Congress are on their payroll and list them all out.
00:39:40.556 - 00:40:07.162, Speaker A: Kind of a demand. It's a little bit. Therefore, I ask you to provide the answers to these questions. To the following questions no later than January 14, 2024. How many former military, civilian government officials or members of Congress are currently employed on behalf of by your organization? For all of the officials listed in question one, please provide a summary of their responsibilities. Are they registered lobbyists? Blah, blah, blah, blah. It's more like you don't really care about these answers.
00:40:07.162 - 00:40:08.590, Speaker A: You're just being me.
00:40:08.740 - 00:40:20.222, Speaker B: It's a PR stunt to just basically say crypto plus hamas, and they're using the revolving door of DC to influence us. Look at these corrupt people. That's what she's doing. And she doesn't actually expect to reply.
00:40:20.286 - 00:40:21.460, Speaker A: It feels like an.
00:40:24.470 - 00:40:52.042, Speaker B: And she knows it's not going to be effective anyway. That's what the anti crypto army is doing. Austin Campbell had a take. I never thought I would see the day when Elizabeth Warren became a proud champion of big banks. Isn't that sad? I remember when she rose on the scene, it was like, for me, anyway, my first exposure to Elizabeth Warren in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, and she was like, anti bank, anti bank. And it was just like, hey, we got to rain. Like, why are they getting bailouts? It's kind of like the whole Bernie Sanders message.
00:40:52.042 - 00:41:21.558, Speaker B: You remember those days? Feels very different from that. Here she is, like, partnering with Jamie Dimon, basically saying, yeah, all crypto surveillance know scams and frauds, and let's clamp down. Meanwhile, this is a peer to peer, decentralized money system for the people, by the people, bottom up. And why would she be on the bankers and the institution side for that? It doesn't make sense. It's not consistent with what her messaging used to be. I'm pretty disappointed as well. I share Austin Campbell's sentiments there.
00:41:21.644 - 00:41:43.530, Speaker A: I've talked to friends of a friend who, the friend that I was not talking to, the one removed who was a previous intern for Senator Warren's office, says it was kind of just like a very top down, shrill. Did not respect the interns, was like, fall in line, do as you're told. Kind of crabs in the bucket.
00:41:43.970 - 00:41:57.410, Speaker B: Yeah, I wonder if other political internships are like that. But anyway, not loving what I'm seeing. We'll see if the tables turn in 2024, but we've got some defensive mechanisms, at least. David, what do we have coming up next?
00:41:57.480 - 00:42:25.834, Speaker A: Coming up next, we got some crypto things to talk about. Lord Eigen Layer has raised its cap, and then it got filled. Inside of 48 hours, $1 billion has been deposited into Eigen layer. We're going to talk about that. And also, Ryan, did you notice that first the Salana phone was kind of marked up as a flop, and then 15,000 units got sold last week. What the hell happened there? And then finally, zk sync construct another win. With a new centralized exchange, L2 from crypto.com,
00:42:25.834 - 00:42:49.502, Speaker A: their new Kronos chain can become a ZK sync chain. And we'll unpack that. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. With metamask portfolio, swapping tokens on chain has never been easier. Swap tokens at any time.

So they added six new liquid staking tokens stakewise swell network, Stator Labs Finance, B ETH, Origin Protocol, Anchor ETH and then they also raised the lido staked ETH cap. All of that got filled immediately. The heat and the energy around Eigen layer and restaking is definitely crescendoing liquid restaking tokens Ryan have just absolutely captivated my attention lately.
00:44:26.366 - 00:44:37.734, Speaker A: I'm going to write an article about that. Liquid restaking tokens I think is the next meta. I think this airdrop mania and the growth around Eigen layer and the number of liquid restaking tokens is kind of.
00:44:37.772 - 00:44:46.022, Speaker B: A bunch of TLDR is you can use ether, the monetary unit of ether, to secure all sorts of other apps. We call these abs, right?
00:44:46.156 - 00:45:08.462, Speaker A: What is TldR of restaking? Liquid restaking tokens is just like liquid staking tokens, but you also get the restaking yields of Eigen layer baked into these liquid restaking tokens. So like the whole LST war is starting brand new again, is starting fresh with the liquid restaking wars, and I'm absolutely here for it. You're here for it. A huge theme in 2024.
00:45:08.596 - 00:45:22.386, Speaker B: This is Sriram saying Ethereum expanded on bitcoin but could not be built on it. Eigen layer expands on Ethereum by building on it. Sriram definitely putting out kind of some narrative tweets here about Ethereum alignment as well.
00:45:22.568 - 00:45:27.330, Speaker A: Ethereum acceleration, not necessarily ethereum alignment. We're going for acceleration.
00:45:29.590 - 00:45:32.260, Speaker B: It's acceleration, particularly of.
00:45:34.890 - 00:45:38.318, Speaker A: ETH. The monetary unit being accelerated by Eigen layer.
00:45:38.434 - 00:45:53.734, Speaker B: ETH becomes more money. ETH AC bring ETH is money back for 2020. I know more money people forgot. David says things you're not bullish enough on ETH and restaking. That's a good way to summarize.
00:45:53.862 - 00:46:16.350, Speaker A: You have ETH acceleration. All right, zk sync got a new L2 joining the hyperchain. What is a hyperchain? That is the zk sync version of the optimism superchain. Kronos has announced the launch of their L2, the Kronos zke EVM joining the zksync hyperchain. So crypto.com, actually a pretty large exchange, going to have its Zke EvM on a hyperchain.
00:46:16.510 - 00:46:34.538, Speaker B: This is cool, too. Celestia, of course, a Da layer. So data availability layer. They've launched, of course, and many folks got an airdrop from this. It's worth a lot, actually. Celestia is now available for builders on arbitrum orbit. So with arbitrum orbit, you can select a non Ethereum da layer if you'd like.
00:46:34.538 - 00:47:00.354, Speaker B: And Celestia is now an option for that. I was actually curious, David, with these new DA layers, how inexpensive L2s that use non ethereum da layers would actually be. And this tweet says the benefits of Zk approving for l two s with a 99% cost reduction versus layer one. Da l two s are about to be free, bro. Cost savings. This is another manta network. It's a different L2.
00:47:00.354 - 00:47:32.860, Speaker B: So it's not arbitram nova, but manta network is tapping into celestia for Da. And look at how cheap these transactions are, right? It's like transactions on L2s are going to fall off of free when they don't use Ethereum for data availability. They're going to be incredibly cheap, practically free, and probably going to be subsidized by many of the layer, like, because if it's micro fractions of a penny, why introduce that friction for your users? Just call it free. Because it's basically free.
00:47:33.390 - 00:47:36.974, Speaker A: Why do you think we're getting the encryption spam attack? Because everything is free these days.
00:47:37.012 - 00:47:43.310, Speaker B: Oh, cool. So we get more spam attacks. We'll have to solve that for that one, too. David, tell me about the salana phone.
00:47:43.460 - 00:48:11.490, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so, like about a month ago, the Salana organization, I think, kind of just called the Salana phone a flop. And they were selling like 30 to 50 phones a day at peak, and it slowed down to like two to three phones a day. And if you're going to have enough phones being sold to induce a developer ecosystem to build apps for the phone, you need to move a lot more phones, like tens of thousands of phones. They had 20,000 phones in their first batch.
00:48:11.570 - 00:48:12.802, Speaker B: The bootstrapping problem.
00:48:12.876 - 00:48:25.114, Speaker A: It's a bootstrapping problem. And I think they only sold like 4000 of them. I talked to Anatoly about this earlier this week. That episode will come out next week. And then they sell 15,000 last week. What? What the hell happened?
00:48:25.232 - 00:48:26.646, Speaker B: Well, because I got an idea.
00:48:26.768 - 00:48:54.882, Speaker A: The original Salana phone came with a bonk airdrop on it. And the bonk token has appreciated significantly in price to be about half the cost of the phone. So the phone was 50% off. And the thing is that this is not the only airdrop on the phone. There's like a handful in the teens number of airdrops that you get from having the phone. And so people are, these phones are now going for $2000 to $5,000 apiece on eBay.
00:48:54.946 - 00:48:57.670, Speaker B: Are you serious? It's an Arb opportunity then.
00:48:57.740 - 00:49:23.178, Speaker A: Well, it's not an ARB opportunity, it's an investment. It's a speculative investment that all of these salana tokens that are on the Salana saga phone are going to pump in price. And so you are over at a $5,000. You are way overpaying what you can pull out from the phone in terms of tokens because you can only pull out $400. But they're kind of just a rare commodity. It's a bet on Salana. It's kind of like uni socks a little bit, but also with the potential of these airdrops, like appreciating bigly.
00:49:23.274 - 00:49:37.634, Speaker B: Well, that's got to help them with the entire bootstrapping problem. I would guess it has that as a side effect. It's basically like it found its product market fit and that's like attaching speculative tokens to it. What a crypto thing to do. Yeah.
00:49:37.672 - 00:50:11.360, Speaker A: So Anatoly says we haven't seen a ton of signal, whether that's compelling enough to sell 50,000 units. They're at 20,000 units now, but I think 25 to 50,000 units feels like there's a hardcore user base for developers to compel to ship applications. So they need another reason. Lightning can't strike twice like this. But if they can get to 50,000 phones, all of a sudden that becomes like a strong user base. Funnily enough, Ryan MkBhD, he's the biggest tech reviewer in YouTube. Like, one of the most watched YouTube accounts rated the salana phone the worst phone of 2023.
00:50:11.890 - 00:50:21.490, Speaker B: Oh, sad. This is bus of the year. Salana Sega phone. Oh. This is part of a whole thread where he's rating phones and he got to. That's sad. And he says, the bonk.
00:50:22.150 - 00:50:24.738, Speaker A: Yeah. He says, no amount of bonk can save this phone.
00:50:24.824 - 00:50:42.680, Speaker B: Oh, no. Well, I mean, I guess a cynical interpretation of this is like, oh, great, another crypto speculative bubble crap. Just trying to show a phone that's not great. I guess a more optimistic take on this is like, hey, tokens really do solve the initial bootstrapping problem.
00:50:44.010 - 00:50:44.802, Speaker A: Really is.
00:50:44.876 - 00:51:01.006, Speaker B: So now you have at least some critical mass of phones out there, and maybe that creates a network effect for more development for it to improve down the line. I don't really have a take. I don't have one of those, but. David, 3 hours capital in the news again. This time, a billion of their assets were frozen. What's this about?
00:51:01.108 - 00:51:24.242, Speaker A: Yeah, so the BVI, british virgin Isles, I believe that's Bermuda, has frozen a billion dollars of three arrows capital assets. So we kind of saw this. Definitely. People think about this happening when Susie was arrested trying to leave Singapore, and he was only arrested for a very small thing, but the bet was that it was going to spiral into a big thing, and we are watching this. So terrorist capital can say goodbye to a billion dollars of their monies.
00:51:24.386 - 00:51:28.006, Speaker B: Yeah, look, if it's in a bank account, it can be frozen, David. Maybe.
00:51:28.108 - 00:51:30.010, Speaker A: Yeah. He should have listed the bank a little bit.
00:51:30.160 - 00:51:47.246, Speaker B: You know, you can't freeze bitcoin. Can't freeze that ether on chain. David. There was a pretty large court case, actually. The first Defi hacker to ever plead guilty in the first ever smart contract fraud conviction. This is a Solana Defi hacker. What happened with the story?
00:51:47.348 - 00:51:58.050, Speaker A: This is Shakib Ahmed, who pled guilty to charges relating to two Dexes. One, Nirvana Finance, the other one, crema finance. I think these were on Salana. These were Salana? I think so.
00:51:58.200 - 00:51:59.300, Speaker B: Is that right?
00:52:00.710 - 00:52:01.650, Speaker A: Yeah, they were definitely.
00:52:01.720 - 00:52:02.610, Speaker B: Salana.
00:52:05.030 - 00:52:20.822, Speaker A: Stole $12 million from Salana. Dexes faces five years in prison, will be sentenced on March 13 1st ever conviction for smart contract hacks and fraud, according to a US attorney. So that's just a message for all the incoming scammers of 2024 and 2025.
00:52:20.956 - 00:52:23.366, Speaker B: You will go to jail, yo. Theft is still illegal.
00:52:23.398 - 00:52:25.958, Speaker A: Yes, theft is still theft, even if it's crypto.
00:52:26.054 - 00:52:36.494, Speaker B: This is where I'm a little bit Gary Gensler. I'm like, oh, we already have rules in place against theft. We don't need additional crypto specific rules to tell people not to steal. It's always been illegal, guys.
00:52:36.612 - 00:52:39.098, Speaker A: You can't steal legal just because it's.
00:52:39.114 - 00:52:48.258, Speaker B: Crypto, just because it's on chain. David, as we close out this holiday episode, we got a meme of the week relating to the Salana phone here. What are we looking at as a.
00:52:48.264 - 00:52:58.114, Speaker A: Meme from that one movie, which is sell me this pen. And the man responds, it has 10 million bunk tokens on it. That would buy the pen. That would buy the pen.
00:52:58.152 - 00:53:01.974, Speaker B: That's where we'll leave things. Guys, we got a moment of Zen coming up. Do you want to tease that?
00:53:02.092 - 00:53:20.990, Speaker A: We got a moment of Zen from Argent who puts a yearly promo yearly recap every single year. They did it last year. They did it this year as well. If you want to get excited for the bankless yearly roll up coming a week from today. Actually, our timelines and their timelines lined up pretty well, except they put it into a minute and 30 seconds, and we did it in an hour.
00:53:21.060 - 00:53:32.474, Speaker B: It's a good year in review for crypto. I would say so. Enjoy that. Guys, I got to end with some disclosures. David and I are advisors for ZK sync and Eigen layer. I think we mentioned them both in the episode. And as a reminder, we are long term investors.
00:53:32.474 - 00:53:48.006, Speaker B: We're not journalists. We don't do paid content. There's always a link to all bankless disclosures@bankless.com. Disclosures. Wow, what a year it's been. Thank you so much for being with us on, well, 51 roll ups for the entire year. David, I don't think we missed one.
00:53:48.028 - 00:53:50.006, Speaker A: Weekly roll ups and one yearly roll up.
00:53:50.108 - 00:54:02.102, Speaker B: Oh, my God. So that's all 52 weeks, and you guys have been along for the ride. Thank you so much. Got to remind you again, as we close out 2023, crypto is risky. You lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier.
00:54:02.102 - 00:54:12.398, Speaker B: Not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot. What is Operation Choke point?
00:54:12.564 - 00:54:35.010, Speaker A: The crypto businesses might end up completely unbanked. Investors in the banks will not be protected. Crypto bank Silvergate shutting down and the lack of confined by these crypto platforms means that you don't have basic investor protection.
00:54:38.550 - 00:54:44.646, Speaker B: Over world's biggest asset manager, that is.
00:54:44.668 - 00:54:47.218, Speaker A: Blackrock filed to list an ETF backed.
00:54:47.234 - 00:54:54.770, Speaker B: By spot Ethereum on the Nasdaq exchange. At some point, the need for crypto hallelujah.
