00:00:05.210 - 00:01:06.850, Speaker A: What's up? Coordination on the pod. Today we have Jasper and Harm of Glow Dollar. So Jasper is the chief marketing officer at Glow, and Harm is the CTO at Glow working on the technology? And Glowdollar is a stablecoin that embeds philanthropy inside of the Glow Dollar. So basically the way it works is that it's kind of like USDC and except where USDC creates revenue for Circle by you holding USDC by the way of interest in the actual money in their bank account, glowdollar takes that interest and gives it to give directly in order to reduce extreme poverty. So the meme that we talk about on this episode is zero XP, zero Extreme Poverty. As the Glow Dollar market cap goes up, then extreme poverty goes down is basically the pitch behind Glow Dollar. So it's launching in Q one of 2023.
00:01:06.850 - 00:01:56.862, Speaker A: So in the next couple of weeks, I'm told is TBD when it's going to launch. And one of the things that I'm just really excited about with Glow Dollar is this idea that we can embed philanthropy into the base layer of our economy. If you exchange with Glowdollar, if you are holding Glow Dollar, then you're basically helping to reduce extreme poverty, which is I think it's quite elegant that people don't have to think about their donations and they can just embed philanthropy in what they do. So risks and disclaimers all DFI and smart contracts are risky. I do not advocate that you hold Glow Dollar. Do your own research on Glow Dollar before you hold it. Glow is also a Green Pill sponsor in Q, one of 2023, and we really appreciate them supporting the Regenerative crypto economics movement.
00:01:56.862 - 00:02:23.606, Speaker A: And I'm just pretty excited about what they're up to. Embedded philanthropy seems really great. Zero extreme poverty seems really great. And just the simplicity and the elegance of if a Dow or someone that uses DFI holds Glow Dollar instead of USDC or Tether, then they can reduce extreme poverty. It just seems like a pretty well designed system to me. So curious what you think. Coordination.
00:02:23.606 - 00:02:25.786, Speaker A: Without further ado, I'll give you Glow Dollar. Enjoy.
00:02:25.888 - 00:03:04.514, Speaker B: Working in web three is awesome, but working outside of the typical W Two employee structure is a deal breaker for so many. Opolis is helping the self sovereign worker focus on what they do best. Their work. Tax time is coming up. Opolis helps professionalize your business by helping you form an entity, generate proof of employment through Pay subs and receive a W Two at the end of the tax year. Are you self employed and forced to spend money on expensive healthcare insurance with limited coverage? Opelis leverages group buying power through a community employment coop, helping you save 20% to 50% on high quality, affordable healthcare options through Cigna. And finally, Opelus's member owners share in Opelis's success and profits based on their work token holdings.
00:03:04.514 - 00:03:35.090, Speaker B: You must be authorized to work inside the United States in select Canadian provinces to receive Opelis's benefits. Book a 30 minutes free consultation with Opelis's experts and join Opelus by March 31, 2023. To get 1000 work and 1000 bank tokens, go to connect Opelis Co. Bankless to get started. And if you're going to East Denver, make sure to stop by the Opelis booth or attend their Future of Work summit hosted by Opolis. The Glow Dollar is a new coin with a very special property. As the market cap of Glow goes up, extreme poverty goes down.
00:03:35.090 - 00:04:14.490, Speaker B: Glow is a dollar backed nonprofit stablecoin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty. Glow is basically the same business model as USDC, with yield generating treasuries on one side and a stablecoin on ethereum on the other. But instead of being a for profit company, glow is a nonprofit that donates 100% of all yields from the Glow Reserve to Give Directly's basic Income Program. Give Directly is a charity that gives people money, no strings attached, to people living in poverty, and is a charity that Vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past. With Glow, you can reduce poverty just by holding a stablecoin. Glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist@glowdollar.org greenpill.
00:04:14.490 - 00:04:18.270, Speaker B: That's glodollar.org greenpill.
00:04:20.850 - 00:04:21.422, Speaker C: All right.
00:04:21.476 - 00:04:22.186, Speaker A: What's up, gentlemen?
00:04:22.218 - 00:04:24.274, Speaker C: How are you doing?
00:04:24.312 - 00:04:26.034, Speaker D: Good, how are you?
00:04:26.232 - 00:04:27.010, Speaker C: Pretty good.
00:04:27.080 - 00:04:33.010, Speaker A: Really excited to talk about Glow Dollar. So can we hear about the why, what and the how of Glowdollar?
00:04:33.830 - 00:04:34.900, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely.
00:04:35.990 - 00:05:18.500, Speaker D: So we're Harm and Jasper from the Glow Foundation. We're building the Glow dollar. And I think for the crypto audience, the most basic way to put it is that we're a fully backed stablecoin just like any other stablecoin. But we're a nonprofit, and all of the money we generate, we donate debt and then we lift people out of extreme poverty by giving them basic incomes. And because of that, when you hold the Glow Dollar, it's just like holding any other stablecoin. But because of you, you're lifting people out of extreme poverty doing so.
00:05:21.030 - 00:05:21.634, Speaker C: That's great.
00:05:21.672 - 00:05:54.000, Speaker A: I mean, what I love about Glow Dollar is that it's such a simple mechanism for like a Dow, treasury or someone who's involved in crypto to hold Glow Dollar. It seems like without any additional risk, I haven't audited your smart contracts or anything like that, but it seems like a Dow could move from USDC or Dai into Glowdollar and then just create positive externalities by holding Glow Dollar. Is it really that simple? And also, what would you say to people out there who maybe hold stablecoins and are considering moving them to Glow Dollars?
00:05:54.930 - 00:05:55.680, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:05:58.530 - 00:06:24.630, Speaker D: Ideally, it is really that simple. In the beginning, there will be a delta. Right. So I think when you compare stablecoins, there are a couple of things you want to compare them on. One is utility. Like what platforms is it supported by? On what exchanges is it listed? Two is liquidity, and three is trustworthiness. And once we launch.
00:06:24.630 - 00:07:20.070, Speaker D: We're not in our ideal state on these things, but as we work over time, we will get to a point where it literally is as simple as that. And we actually want to go a bit beyond that. So if you're using stablecoins right now, then there will be a point where moving to Glow Dollar is truly something that comes at no opportunity cost to you. But ideally, we can at some point say the same thing about holding US dollars. So it's not just if you're a crypto person, it's also if you're just a normal person receiving a salary doing payments. We want to move towards a situation where you can do that in US dollars or in the globe dollar. And if you do it in the globe dollar, you're lifting people out of extreme.
00:07:23.930 - 00:07:44.450, Speaker A: Know harm. This may be a question for you, but in building that network effect of Glow Dollar, I'm assuming it's an ERC 20. So basically anyone who integrates with any type of token can integrate with Glow Dollar. Is that true? And also, do you want to tell us a little bit about the technical architecture? I know you're a CTO over at Glow Dollar.
00:07:45.030 - 00:07:46.082, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely.
00:07:46.216 - 00:08:55.894, Speaker E: So it is indeed an ERC 20. It works basically the same as all other stablecoins. There's one sort of twist though, that is that transferring US dollars using Glow is 10% cheaper versus the other stablecoins that are out there. That's because we essentially implemented an optimization on the smart contract level that allows us to check for denied lists or blacklists as they are controversially called entries, in a more efficient way than the large stable coins that are out there do it. And that's between 10% to 15% cheaper than the alternatives. It's based on a proposal by Alex Kruger, who initially did this as a pull request for the center tokens which power USDC. They've never really bothered to implement it, I think for legal and regulatory and internal compliance hurdles or reasons, but we connected with him and indicated, hey, we'd like to do this.
00:08:55.894 - 00:09:50.490, Speaker E: He was supportive, and so we did. And to put that into perspective, I think it was in June 2022, if USDC would have implemented this optimization, that would have cost the entire ecosystem of USDC users about 700K less gas in one month. So at scale, these sort of small optimizations are really important for the user. However, it definitely just functions as an ERC 20. And then if you want, I can also go even deeper into our vision beyond sort of crypto, which is more around, okay, how do we actually attract people outside of crypto to also adopt the globe dollar?
00:09:51.550 - 00:10:32.680, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that for me, from doing my research on you all, it feels like there's this meme that's in your marketing, which is that as the Glow Dollar market cap goes up, the number of people in extreme poverty goes down. It's literally just a reverse correlation between how successful Glow dollar is and the number of people that can be taken out of extreme poverty. And I'm assuming that crypto is the starting point, but then when you said even going outside of crypto, is that like your second act? How much could you reduce extreme poverty just by getting market penetration in crypto versus having to go outside of crypto and into the legacy system?
00:10:33.850 - 00:10:39.114, Speaker C: Yeah, good question. So when our market cap goes up.
00:10:39.152 - 00:10:54.714, Speaker D: By $18,000, so one eight on average, we'll be able to lift one person out of extreme poverty. So basically, anything that grows our market cap divided by eighteen K, and that's how many people are left out of poverty.
00:10:54.762 - 00:10:58.254, Speaker C: So when you compare this to, for.
00:10:58.292 - 00:11:32.954, Speaker D: Instance, Tetter, tether has a pretty brilliant business model. So they're fully backed, which means they keep 100% of their market cap value in a reserve. And they invest that reserve in all sorts of assets, very low risk assets. And on average, we estimate that they make 2.7% of whatever their market cap is. So if Tether would do what we are going to do, they would be generating $1.8 billion per year, and that would lift 3.7
00:11:32.954 - 00:11:34.330, Speaker D: million people out of poverty.
00:11:34.910 - 00:11:37.146, Speaker C: So that's tether Tether now has a.
00:11:37.168 - 00:11:59.426, Speaker D: Market cap of, I think, $66 billion. The total stable coin market, it depends a little bit, but over the last half year or so, it has been $150,000,000,000. If we would theoretically capture the whole stablecoin market, we would on average be lifting eight and a half million people.
00:11:59.608 - 00:12:05.380, Speaker C: Out of extreme poverty. The numbers there are, I think, pretty.
00:12:06.230 - 00:12:17.990, Speaker D: Nice, even though, of course, 8.5 million people is like nowhere near lifting everyone out of extreme poverty, which is our goal. But I would still be proud of that impact.
00:12:18.650 - 00:12:22.780, Speaker A: What is the number there of number of people who are in extreme poverty across the world?
00:12:23.630 - 00:12:25.740, Speaker D: It's about 650,000,000.
00:12:26.430 - 00:13:07.730, Speaker A: Wow, that makes me so sad. Okay, so doing some quick math, 650,000,000 times 18,000 in glow market cap. So if you got up to a market cap of two, three, it looks like 11 trillion, then you could remove everyone out of extreme poverty. Hopefully my math is correct on that. 18,000 per person in market cap times 650,000,000 to me equals 11.7 trillion in market cap. You would have to get to reach zero XP, which is the meme that I see on your website.
00:13:07.730 - 00:13:11.702, Speaker A: Zero people in extreme poverty, my notes.
00:13:11.766 - 00:14:01.898, Speaker D: Say about the same number. So that's right, we're doing the math. Yeah, pretty impressive. I'm definitely using a pre created Excel sheet for this, but, yeah, eleven point something trillion. And that would amount to a little over 8% of all the Fiat money in the world. So if we get 8% of all money holders waited equally to do this, then theoretically we could provide everyone in extreme poverty with a basic income. Now, it's a little bit of an oversimplification because some of these live, for instance, in north Korea, can't really get.
00:14:01.984 - 00:14:07.430, Speaker C: There with basic incomes. So, yeah, it's an oversimplification.
00:14:07.510 - 00:14:10.380, Speaker D: Right? But yeah, on a high level.
00:14:12.430 - 00:14:29.042, Speaker A: So one of the questions I always ask guests is, if in a world in which you're maximally successful, what does the world look like? And it feels like we've kind of reverse engineered that right here. The meme is zero XP, zero people in extreme poverty or as close to it as possible.
00:14:29.176 - 00:14:30.180, Speaker C: Is that right?
00:14:31.430 - 00:15:04.160, Speaker D: Yeah, that's absolutely right. And in terms of what we do, our goal would be to get to a point where, like I said, using the glo dollar is equivalent to using the US dollar when it comes to security, when it comes to utility, such that it really is a no brainer for people to switch. If we get there, then enough people should be willing to do it to actually get to these numbers, I think.
00:15:04.770 - 00:15:05.520, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:07.330 - 00:15:52.320, Speaker A: What is the reserve? So I know a rudo mentoring about stablecoins, but as far as I understand, tether is fully backed in a bank account, and they provide some amount of information to auditors so that people can be sure that it's fully backed. But there's always people who are kind of guessing whether or not tether is fully backed. And there's, like, conspiracy theories about it. I know with dai, it's a decentralized collateralized stablecoin, and then you've got various other models for stablecoins. So is glow dollar one to one more with tether, but with embedded philanthropy? USDC but embedded philanthropy. Dai but embedded philanthropy. Or is it like a different model completely?
00:15:53.490 - 00:15:56.750, Speaker D: The closest model would be USDC circle.
00:15:57.490 - 00:15:58.240, Speaker C: Okay.
00:15:59.810 - 00:16:01.934, Speaker D: That is generally what we look to.
00:16:02.132 - 00:16:05.666, Speaker C: As a reasonably good example of how.
00:16:05.688 - 00:16:27.766, Speaker D: To do it in terms of transparency. In terms of reserve management. We want to go a bit beyond that. Ideally have real time insight in our reserves rather than daily, have a big four audit tie our hands to the mast when it comes to what we can and can't do with the reserve.
00:16:27.798 - 00:16:37.094, Speaker C: So we really want to do everything we can to make this reserve strategy.
00:16:37.142 - 00:16:42.880, Speaker D: As trustworthy as possible. But I think the way USDC is doing it is a very good.
00:16:45.090 - 00:16:47.438, Speaker C: First model. Yeah.
00:16:47.524 - 00:17:33.500, Speaker A: Got it. So, as I understand it, end to end, people put money into glow dollar, and then there's a certain amount of actual us. Dollars that are stored in a bank account somewhere that generates interest. And in the USDC model, a lot of that interest goes to that revenue, goes into overhead and just the profits of circle. But in the glow model, it goes mostly, if not all, into relieving extreme poverty. So you get $450 per year in dividends or interest per $18,000 in glow reserve, and that's what funds the removal of people in extreme poverty. Is that sort of like end to end how the system works?
00:17:34.670 - 00:17:35.406, Speaker C: Yeah, it does. Right.
00:17:35.428 - 00:17:59.074, Speaker D: If you want to get really specific, we, like Circle does, will invest a part of the reserve in US. Short term treasury bills, and we will keep a part in cash. The cash will not give us yield, but it's necessary to have a liquid enough reserve liquid people want to redeem.
00:17:59.122 - 00:17:59.720, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:00.250 - 00:18:25.454, Speaker D: So Circle right now is holding approximately 80% in T bills, 20% cash. We expect to get to similar levels. And then these t bills. So the 80%, historically, they have a yield of 3.4%. So 80% times 3.4%, you get to 2.7%. So 2.7%
00:18:25.454 - 00:18:36.798, Speaker D: of whatever our market cap is, on average, 100% of that we donate. And then we donate that to an NGO called Gift directly.
00:18:36.974 - 00:18:38.702, Speaker C: Now, they also have a little overhead.
00:18:38.766 - 00:19:05.798, Speaker D: So they have an overhead of about 10%. So you multiply a lot of factors, but when you multiply it all together, you get to an average number that every $18,000 of market cap provides one person in extreme poverty with a basic income. So what does that mean in practice?
00:19:05.974 - 00:19:06.700, Speaker C: Well.
00:19:09.630 - 00:20:00.410, Speaker D: It depends on where the money come from. But I think Dows are a very interesting use case. So I looked up the treasury holdings of the Gitcoin Dow, for instance. They currently hold a little over 8 million in stablecoins in terms of glow, that would lift 466 people out of extreme poverty. So that's a pretty cool sort of additional impact that any Dow that holds stables can just have with one flick of a button or in case of Dow, like, one vote. And that impact is essentially for free. You're already using stablecoins, so you're already accepting the risk of holding a stablecoin.
00:20:00.410 - 00:20:06.586, Speaker D: So in that particular case, it's truly a no brainer.
00:20:06.618 - 00:20:11.630, Speaker C: I think maybe one small addition here.
00:20:11.780 - 00:20:51.630, Speaker E: Is one thing we haven't discussed yet, is the overhead, right? And the people that are building this, they also need to live. But we feel strongly that we should not be incentivized to grow Globe Dollar to benefit ourselves. So 100% of all the revenue we make through investing in treasury bills goes to Gift directly, in its entirety. The Globe Development Foundation, the organization behind the Globe Dollar, is entirely funded by donations by individuals.
00:20:52.450 - 00:21:07.730, Speaker A: Tell me about the meme of embedded philanthropy. I think it's really quite interesting to think about embedding philanthropy into our everyday economic activities. What does embedded philanthropy mean to you, and why is it a win for reducing extreme poverty?
00:21:09.270 - 00:21:19.394, Speaker C: Yeah, okay, so, the pitch is something like this. If we want to give everyone an extreme poverty a base income, the limiting.
00:21:19.442 - 00:22:24.780, Speaker D: Factor is how much cash there is to give away by definition. So we need a whole lot of money to scale up that idea of basic incomes. And right now, these basic income programs are often funded either from private donations or from government philanthropic aid. And that is placing a fundamental limit on the scalability of these programs because there's only so much money that people and states are willing to give away. So the total addressable market cap, sorry, total addressable market for anything that's based on donations, it's just very small and that actually makes a lot of sense. So let's say you're the average US household. Then you have a savings account that contains about forty k dollars, you spend about 60K.
00:22:24.780 - 00:22:39.022, Speaker D: So as an average US household, you control where $100,000 go every year in the economy. And on average you donate only 2%.
00:22:39.076 - 00:22:44.194, Speaker C: Of that and only 0.2% of that.
00:22:44.392 - 00:22:51.938, Speaker D: Ever goes across the US border. So if you are a donation based.
00:22:52.024 - 00:22:58.022, Speaker C: Charity, your total addressable market is 0.2%.
00:22:58.076 - 00:23:05.106, Speaker D: Like a very tiny slice of the pie chart of the money in the economy.
00:23:05.298 - 00:23:09.862, Speaker C: So if we want to take this.
00:23:09.916 - 00:24:08.170, Speaker D: Idea of giving people an extreme poverty based income, if we want to take that seriously and we want to scale that up seriously, we need a way to fund it that does not depend on donations. Now that sounds like it's impossible because how can you contribute financially to a charitable cause without donating? But there are actually some instances of how that can be done a different way. So I think the most famous one is what Patagonia did. The owner of Patagonia, the founder of Patagonia, donated the whole company to a charity a couple months ago. And because of that, you as an individual, you now have two ways to contribute to the charity. You can actually donate to the charity directly or you can wear Patagonia clothing and then the profit margin of that purchase goes to the charity. So wearing these clothes, buying these clothes is sort of like an act of charity.
00:24:08.170 - 00:24:29.460, Speaker D: So in doing so, Patagonia embedded philanthropy in the garments that they create and sell. And that trick could be applied to any product. So you could have a philanthropically embedded toilet paper, if it's manufactured by a toilet paper manufacturer that donates 100% away.
00:24:30.550 - 00:24:32.654, Speaker C: Now we're taking that to the extreme.
00:24:32.702 - 00:25:16.046, Speaker D: And we're saying, well, let's not embed philanthropy in any particular product, but let's just embed it in money itself, in the currency that we use in our daily lives. That is cool because, well, A, money is a very universal product, so the dam of the US dollar is enormous. But B, once you have embedded philanthropy in money itself, you can actually embed it in other things too. So you can go to your boss and say, hey, I want my next paycheck in Glow. Well now your salary is lifting people out of extreme poverty. You can split bills in Glow. You can actually run whole companies on the Glow dollar as the base money layer.
00:25:16.046 - 00:25:40.540, Speaker D: And now suddenly everything the whole company is doing with money, that's all lifting people out of extreme poverty. So this way you can actually make that pie chart of money in a US household contribute to good for the full 100% rather than just this tiny slice of whatever they're willing to and able to give away.
00:25:41.150 - 00:25:47.738, Speaker C: Okay, that was a very long sentence, but I hope that gets yeah, it.
00:25:47.744 - 00:26:20.680, Speaker A: Feels like the exciting opportunity here is that people don't have to remember to donate. If you just embed philanthropy into the economic system, then you kind of set it and forget it. You just go about your economic activities and know that you're producing positive externalities, which is fundamentally more scalable than remembering to donate. So it reduces the cognitive load, and that also creates more scalability. That might be too reductionist, but those are kind of some of the key points that I heard.
00:26:21.850 - 00:26:23.734, Speaker C: Yeah, totally agree.
00:26:23.852 - 00:26:52.160, Speaker D: It's that, and it's indeed the scalability. So there is a group of people who donate 10% of their yearly income. That's called the giving what we can pledge, and that's considered very extreme. So that's a group of people. They're among the most philanthropic, charitable people, and they too, like, 90% of their money is money that they don't give away.
00:26:56.880 - 00:26:57.244, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:57.282 - 00:27:12.420, Speaker A: It kind of reminds me of when I used to work at a mutual fund company, and I remember them spending a lot of time trying to get people to automate their investments in their retirement account so that every paycheck.
00:27:14.120 - 00:27:14.388, Speaker C: We.
00:27:14.394 - 00:27:35.820, Speaker A: Would try to push people to have, like 3% of their paycheck go into their retirement account. And people will save more over the longer term if they're just always investing 3% more. And so it just kind of reminds me of that, but for philanthropy. So I think, like, the set it forget it nature is really pretty powerful.
00:27:36.640 - 00:27:40.750, Speaker C: Yeah, totally agree. Well.
00:27:44.160 - 00:28:00.470, Speaker A: I'm curious when the launch is, how do people get involved? How can they participate in your ecosystem? And what opportunities for engagement are there for the listeners of the Green Pill podcast, most of which are pretty active in web three.
00:28:02.520 - 00:28:07.860, Speaker C: Carmen, you want to take this one? Yeah, sure.
00:28:07.930 - 00:28:21.210, Speaker E: Maybe before I start going off on a limp yoshida, do you want me to say just Q One launch and then we want them to consider.
00:28:22.960 - 00:28:23.624, Speaker C: Shifting.
00:28:23.672 - 00:28:26.540, Speaker E: To Glow as they're stable?
00:28:29.680 - 00:28:31.470, Speaker C: Yeah, sounds good.
00:28:33.680 - 00:28:37.250, Speaker E: Do we want them to be active in social and stuff, too?
00:28:40.950 - 00:28:43.060, Speaker D: Yeah, maybe we can say.
00:28:45.110 - 00:28:46.340, Speaker C: Good question. Actually.
00:28:49.430 - 00:29:12.570, Speaker D: Follow us on Twitter. It's like a classic. But of course, that is definitely nice. I'd say the easiest way is follow us, and then once we launch in Q One, actually buy some Glow on the decks, help us grow the market cap, and then if you're really excited, you can actually start building on Glow.
00:29:13.550 - 00:29:14.540, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:29:15.870 - 00:29:18.202, Speaker E: Glowdollar.org greenpill link.
00:29:18.256 - 00:29:23.438, Speaker C: Right. Okay, cool.
00:29:23.604 - 00:29:27.600, Speaker D: Maybe you can say we're trying to get this thing from zero to one.
00:29:30.050 - 00:29:30.800, Speaker E: Right?
00:29:31.170 - 00:29:45.000, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's fun that you're having the CTO answer the how can people get involved question when you're the chief marketing officer. But it's fun to watch. Yeah. So maybe I'll just ask again and we can take it from there.
00:29:45.530 - 00:29:48.086, Speaker C: Yeah, sounds good. Cool.
00:29:48.188 - 00:30:04.860, Speaker A: So how can people get involved in Glow? Say that I'm totally bought in on embedded philanthropy and I want to help build this movement of zero extreme poverty by helping Glow launch and getting involved in the Glow ecosystem. Where can I do that? How can I do that?
00:30:06.130 - 00:31:06.254, Speaker E: Yeah, great that you're so excited. I think, for starters, go to Glowdollar.org Greenpill and then join the waitlist there so that you maintain up to speed on everything we're doing. We are very close to launching on decentralized exchanges that should happen in quarter one, and maybe by the time you're listening to this, we actually are available already on uniswap, most likely at scale. So when that's the case, we would really invite you to consider changing your stablecoin holdings to the globe dollar and start help us make an impact for the better in the world. And I think we're really at the stage where we're trying to take this from zero to one as a project. And one of the key things that will allow us to really make Glow successful is if others start building on top of Glow as well.
00:31:06.254 - 00:32:18.950, Speaker E: So one thing would be to start another project on top of the Glow dollar or to include Glow as a token in the products that you are building yourself as an alternative stablecoin that you like and support. And then finally, I think what we believe is very important as well for the long term success of Glow is to go beyond crypto. So it is sort of my personal dream and desire and ambition that Glow will be used to exchange goods and services not only in the digital realm, but also in the physical realm. So I'd love for people to start accepting Glow for maybe a cup of coffee or a T shirt. Perhaps the green pill swag or the shelling point swag could also be bought using Glow, I think. Yeah, we're really looking for more projects to sort of sign on and start accepting Glow as a true stablecoin.
00:32:21.450 - 00:32:21.814, Speaker C: Yes.
00:32:21.852 - 00:32:41.482, Speaker A: So it seems like you all are about to launch. You can sign up for updates on the launch@glowdollar.org. You can go to Twitter.com, glowdollar. Glodollar. There's no w there. And once it's live, you can hoddle Glow and of course, do your own research before hoddling any token.
00:32:41.482 - 00:33:00.690, Speaker A: Of course. And if you're a DAP developer, you can integrate Glow into your ecosystem, and it's an ERC 20, so lots of stuff can be built on top of it. And the launch is sometime in Q One. So check out Glowdollar.org if you want to get involved.
00:33:02.010 - 00:33:03.078, Speaker C: Totally right.
00:33:03.244 - 00:33:03.960, Speaker E: Exactly.
00:33:04.810 - 00:33:10.374, Speaker D: Polygon, maybe we're launching on the Ethereum network, but also Polygon at the same.
00:33:10.412 - 00:33:16.886, Speaker C: Time in the future, expanding to a.
00:33:16.908 - 00:33:19.580, Speaker D: Number of chains, but that's where we're starting.
00:33:21.630 - 00:33:22.330, Speaker C: Great.
00:33:22.480 - 00:33:33.680, Speaker A: Well, is there anything that I didn't ask that you all want to talk about with respect to glow dollar. Why you're so passionate about extreme poverty, embedded philanthropy, all the things that we talked about here, is there anything I didn't ask that you want to say?
00:33:35.250 - 00:33:44.118, Speaker C: That's a generous question. Thanks. Well, maybe one interesting thing is khar.
00:33:44.154 - 00:33:48.130, Speaker D: Mentioned the fact that we definitely want beyond crypto adoption.
00:33:48.710 - 00:33:50.694, Speaker C: And we sometimes get the question, like.
00:33:50.732 - 00:34:11.450, Speaker D: What makes you think that, after all of the cryptocurrencies that have tried to get adoption as a mainstream means of exchange, which actually has been the promise of crypto since the very beginning of bitcoin and has never been fulfilled, what makes you think that you'll be able to get that kind of adoption?
00:34:13.710 - 00:34:18.720, Speaker C: And my thought there is that.
00:34:21.250 - 00:34:32.818, Speaker D: People wonder like, okay, why is bitcoin not used as a means of exchange? And then the classic answer is, well, it's too volatile, right. You don't want to pay your pizza on Bitcoin and then see it be worth one hundred K a bit later.
00:34:32.984 - 00:34:33.602, Speaker C: Okay, sure.
00:34:33.656 - 00:35:25.714, Speaker D: But that problem is solved by other stablecoins. Like, other stablecoins are actually quite ready to be used for everyday payments and still, I don't know anyone outside of the crypto world who's doing that, who's actually buying their groceries with Tether or USDC. And I think the answer is, why would you? So, for instance, my parents, they're pretty happy with their debit card that just works in the grocery store. And then you can say, well, but stablecoins are nice because it's programmable money or you have cross border remittances or you don't have all of the intermediary parties in between the transactions or instant settlements. Sure, yeah, that's amazing. And as a technologist, I love that. But my parents don't even know what these words mean.
00:35:25.714 - 00:35:29.026, Speaker D: They just want to pay at the grocery store.
00:35:29.208 - 00:35:33.446, Speaker C: So I think to break through as.
00:35:33.468 - 00:36:03.680, Speaker D: A means of exchange, like crypto shouldn't be just as good as TradFi means of exchanges. They should add something that TradFi means of exchanges cannot do. And my hope is that the ability to lift people out of extreme poverty at no cost, that that might be the killer app, the killer feature, let's say, that actually makes people want to switch to something that is not something they're used to.
00:36:05.810 - 00:36:06.654, Speaker C: Let's see.
00:36:06.772 - 00:36:08.820, Speaker D: But that's what we want to work towards.
00:36:09.990 - 00:37:33.180, Speaker E: Maybe to add to that long thought with some more thinking. I think there's also a natural dynamic that we'll be able to create that some other stablecoins aren't able to create so far, which is due to the embedded philanthropy aspect of the globe dollar. We will be able to, just by the virtue of that pitch, attract people who are normally not so much into crypto to also put money into the glow dollar. And we've already spoken with quite some people who have said, okay, sure, I will hold some money in Glow, but then I will try to spend it as well as I can, and only if I am. Able to spend it? Am I going to buy more? So what I anticipate will happen here is you're going to have a new group of people who've never held any crypto before and have no interest in crypto in and of itself. They will have a new sort of means of payment and they will want to pay with it somewhere. And then some smart business owners out there are going to think, hey, but this is a new sort of niche that I can cater to.
00:37:33.180 - 00:38:17.900, Speaker E: They are possibly quite sort of values aligned to whatever that business is doing as well. And they may actually start to accept Glow out of sort of an altruistic motivation, but also a business opportunity. And if that happens, you sort of have fixed the cold start problem in the sense that you have people who want to spend stuff and you have businesses who want to accept it and then you can really get a payments ecosystem going. And that's not something I've really seen successfully develop much in other web. Three new cryptocurrency projects so far.
00:38:21.820 - 00:38:22.996, Speaker C: Yeah, totally.
00:38:23.188 - 00:38:31.180, Speaker A: Well, it's really great to see the traction that you all are making and I think that you're doing something new and innovative that hopefully creates positive externalities for the world.
00:38:31.250 - 00:38:34.184, Speaker C: So, yeah, excited to see the launch.
00:38:34.232 - 00:38:51.820, Speaker A: And see where it goes for the audience out there. Check out Glowdollar.org. Go to twitter.com glowdollar. GL o dollar and looking forward to seeing how things grow in the future. So thanks so much for coming on the pod.
00:38:52.440 - 00:38:53.812, Speaker D: It thanks for having us.
00:38:53.866 - 00:38:54.870, Speaker E: For having us.
00:38:55.240 - 00:38:56.210, Speaker D: Your pleasure. Cool.
