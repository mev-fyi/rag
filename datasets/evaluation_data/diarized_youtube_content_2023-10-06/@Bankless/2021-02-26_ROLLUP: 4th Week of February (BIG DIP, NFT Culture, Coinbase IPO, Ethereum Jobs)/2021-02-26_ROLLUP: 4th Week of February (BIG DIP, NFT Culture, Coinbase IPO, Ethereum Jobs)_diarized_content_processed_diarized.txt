00:00:08.010 - 00:00:17.082, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome to the weekly roll up. This is the last week of February, the fourth week of February. David, what do we do on these weekly roll ups?
00:00:17.226 - 00:00:45.274, Speaker B: We roll up the full week of crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor. First we start with the markets. What are the markets saying? Then we go into releases, what got released in the last week of crypto. Then we go into the news, what happened in the news cycle? Then we get into some ecosystem takes who had some interesting opinions over the last week. And then lastly, we get into what David and Ryan are excited about, and then we top things off with the meme of the week.
00:00:45.392 - 00:00:50.570, Speaker A: I like how you fit that in. David, are you ready to start? Let's get going with Marcus. You ready?
00:00:50.720 - 00:00:54.478, Speaker B: Absolutely. Again, so much happens in markets. Let's get into it.
00:00:54.564 - 00:00:55.742, Speaker A: All right, let's roll them up.
00:00:55.796 - 00:00:56.266, Speaker B: Markets.
00:00:56.298 - 00:01:02.558, Speaker A: Let's start with bitcoin. What is going on with bitcoin? It was up and now it's down. What's happening?
00:01:02.724 - 00:01:39.510, Speaker B: Bitcoin topped out at $58,300, and now it is at the low, low price of $49,100. I feel like this is our biggest correction in the crypto markets this entire, quote, unquote, bull run ever since the end of Defi summer. Right. So Defi Summer happened, and then that was a pretty big correction. We had two month bear market. This is mostly a facetious joke, but that was kind of the last time we ever had any big correction. And ever since then, it's been basically, it is a linear up into the right trend.
00:01:39.510 - 00:01:49.066, Speaker B: But finally we got this big correction both in bitcoin and in ether prices. But the trend is still your friend. The trend is still here. We're still looking good over the long term.
00:01:49.178 - 00:02:10.198, Speaker A: David, we've been told to respect the pump. I think we've got to respect the dip, my friend. Sometimes these dips happen. This is perfectly normal during a bull market. You're going to see 30%, you're going to see 40% dips, sometimes a little bit higher. In previous bull markets, that happened three or four times before the end of it. This does not necessarily mark the end of the bull market.
00:02:10.198 - 00:02:20.090, Speaker A: And I'm still bullish. Eth over two k as well this week, but now it's back down. Where did we go? And where are we now?
00:02:20.240 - 00:02:51.614, Speaker B: Yeah, ETH broke two k and it hit $2,040. So just got a little bit over two k, decided it wasn't really, it wasn't the right time. We're saving it for later. We're back down to $1,572, almost $500 off of the ETH top, which again, it's a big correction. Legacy market participants don't understand the magnitudes of these moves, but in crypto, this is just a normal correction. This is just how it goes, David.
00:02:51.662 - 00:03:06.262, Speaker A: I'm just glad we got a chance to celebrate Eth. Two k, my friend. That felt good. Just hitting that milestone. Even though we're under now, I'm confident that we'll get back there again. What happened to total locked value in DFI? That's down a bit, too.
00:03:06.396 - 00:03:40.306, Speaker B: Yeah, we peaked out at $43 billion locked in DFI. The last weekly roll up, we've reported it at 42, and today we are at 37 and a half billion dollars locked in DFI. It actually takes a little bit more of effort and energy to figure out, well, what is just asset price appreciation versus depreciation when it comes to loss in DFI or what is actually like deposits or withdrawals from the ecosystem. So there's a little bit of noise here in this metric, but still like 37 and a half billion dollars, still a large number, just a little bit shaved off the top.
00:03:40.408 - 00:04:08.022, Speaker A: Next big milestone seems to be 50 billion. We'll see how long it takes us to get there. Let's talk about DPi. So this is the DFI pulse index tracking the top ten DFI tokens. You know what's interesting about this, if I look on the weekly view, David, it's about flat. So it didn't take quite the hit, that ether. It definitely went up with ETH, but it didn't take quite the hit, at least from indications.
00:04:08.022 - 00:04:09.750, Speaker A: Where are we hanging out right now?
00:04:09.920 - 00:04:16.510, Speaker B: Yeah, we are just below $400, $394 for one DPi.
00:04:17.410 - 00:04:28.194, Speaker A: Yeah. And let's take a look at the DPi ETH ratio to see sort of that effect. So it's up a little bit from last week.
00:04:28.312 - 00:04:45.990, Speaker B: Right. This is definitely where you can see the strength that DPI and Defi at large had against ether last weekly roll up. It was also the first major correction of DPI versus Ether. But now we are back up to the week before that. Right. And so DPI once again outperforming.
00:04:46.490 - 00:05:26.850, Speaker A: Know, I have a reason for always. It's always a mistake. It's often a mistake, I would say, to attribute kind of like the noise of markets to specific fundamental reasons. But I think this might be due to the binance chain narrative, David. So binance chain has been gaining some steam and volume and usage, some real, some not so real. But that aside, has been gaining some usage while ethereum fees, gas fees have been going kind of off the charts. And I think the Defi token index move up while ETH price move down.
00:05:26.850 - 00:05:48.650, Speaker A: Or at least this ratio moving up a bit might be as a result of that. Might be as a result of people seeing that narrative or hearing that narrative and being a bit less bullish ETH relative to defi tokens. Do you think I'm jumping the gun on that take, or do you think that's a live narrative that is affecting these prices over the last week?
00:05:48.800 - 00:06:24.178, Speaker B: Yeah, we definitely saw the binance chain BNB token absolutely skyrocket last week to, I think. Yeah, it became number three in market cap behind bitcoin. And ether is binance chain next. I think it even passed tether, which is pretty crazy. So binance chain definitely riding in the same tailwinds that ether is riding in. And if you are bullish binance chain, you would might even say that BNB token kind of took the wind out of ether's sales. I'm skeptical as to how long that lasts, but last week was definitely a win for binance chain believers and BNB holders.
00:06:24.274 - 00:06:26.594, Speaker A: Yeah. Are you a binance chain believer, David?
00:06:26.722 - 00:06:28.518, Speaker B: I don't know. Not at all?
00:06:28.604 - 00:06:29.720, Speaker A: Not at all.
00:06:30.810 - 00:06:36.886, Speaker B: CZ doesn't pay my salary. He doesn't pay my paycheck. Why would I believe in his products? No, I believe in protocols.
00:06:36.998 - 00:07:12.482, Speaker A: I think we'll have time to get into that, hopefully during the take section. I'm sure one of us has some hot takes on that. Let's go to the next, though, on the market side of things. While this happens again, anytime there's buys or anytime there's sales. So in a bull run or in a bear run with these market moves, Dexes tend to do well, or at least exchanges tend to do well. And lately, decentralized exchanges have been just crushing it. In terms of volume, they had their biggest day ever, over 4 billion in daily Dex volume.
00:07:12.482 - 00:07:24.618, Speaker A: Now. I mean, these numbers would have blown our minds back in 2017, and now we're hitting them on the regular, and they feel like they're only going to go up during this bull cycle. What do you think about this?
00:07:24.784 - 00:07:57.326, Speaker B: Yeah. So volume goes hand in hand with volatility, right? And so when there are big moves, and especially big moves down, because downward moves tend to happen much faster than upward moves. And so there's a lot of volume that's compressed into a short amount of time. And I think that blow off top from $2,000 down to even the low, low price of $1,400, where ether was, that's a big move. And that means that there's going to be a lot of on chain liquidations. There's going to be a lot of people selling off their positions. There's going to be a lot of people taking positions.
00:07:57.326 - 00:08:08.710, Speaker B: There's just overall going to be a lot of volume. And we're seeing that in DeFi. We're seeing that with Dexes, just all time highs with Dex volume on the upside. And on the downside, this is just how volume works.
00:08:08.860 - 00:08:37.070, Speaker A: Last I checked, Dex volume was like something like 5% to 7% or so of centralized exchange volume. I'm looking for that ratio to go up. I'm looking for decentralized exchange volume to start consuming more and more of the centralized exchange traffic, and we'll see how that turns out. David, this is a really, like, we refer to Defi pulse all the time. That's defypulse.com. They just came out with a crypto dollars chart, which I think is super cool. This is all time, David.
00:08:37.070 - 00:09:14.638, Speaker A: So, dude, look at, like, it's like climbing Everest. We got a mountain of crypto dollars being printed. Each of these crypto dollars generally is backed by some collateral. So this is not fractional reserve banking, which is interesting, right. Each of these crypto dollars actually represents a dollar of value in collateral or a dollar in the bank. But we're at over 35 billion now in terms of crypto dollars that are active and live on Ethereum. And I think this probably includes maybe some that are on, or is this just Ethereum? I'm actually not sure, David, do you know?
00:09:14.804 - 00:09:42.090, Speaker B: Yeah, I believe this is just Ethereum. Yeah. I don't think there's a single other chain that they have listed here. The interesting thing about this metric, and you can see a similar chart with a BTC on Ethereum, charts tend to go up and down, but not these charts. This chart is only up, which really is really indicative of crypto dollars when deployed to Ethereum, don't leave. They only stay. And bitcoin, when it's deployed to Ethereum, doesn't.
00:09:42.090 - 00:10:06.160, Speaker B: It leaves a little bit more than crypto dollars, but generally it stays there. Right. And so this is one of the fundamental theses that we have about Ethereum as the nexus of Internet economic activity, as the global permissionless settlement layer. Once assets come to Ethereum, they don't leave because they're more useful on Ethereum. And so we see corrections in crypto prices, we see corrections in other realms, but with crypto dollars up and to the right. Never, ever.
00:10:08.050 - 00:10:35.382, Speaker A: Just, I guess, ask yourself if you have a sell plan, David. Right? I'm sure you have some sort of sell plan. I'm sure, like most of us on the bankless journey, you're not going to sell all of your crypto assets, but you might sell some when the market heats up too much during this bull cycle. Aside from money, you need to pay bills, rent, living expenses, that kind of thing. When you sell, are you going to bring your money back into your Wells Fargo account, or what are you going to do with it?
00:10:35.516 - 00:11:20.066, Speaker B: Why would I do that? Like my Wells Fargo account, that's their account that they let me use. I would rather use my own account on ethereum. I was having this interesting conversation in the finance subreddit shout out to all the finance bros. Underappreciated subreddit out there. And I was saying, when I do myselves, which I do plan on doing, towards the end of this cycle, I plan on holding crypto dollars in my eth wallet, just because that's my account. Like self sovereignty, self custody. What's also interesting is I also added into this conversation, and this is kind of where the conversation led, is I actually also plan on having a decent number of my crypto dollars that I will sell into, not inside of smart contracts.
00:11:20.066 - 00:11:55.294, Speaker B: Right. So not only am I selling into dollars, which are stable, and while we shit on the dollar, at the end of the day, it is the dollar. Can't really hate on it, but I'm also going to keep it out of contracts, or at least make sure that when I do put them into contracts, they are insured, because one part, I want to lock in my profits, but then I also want to reduce risk buying into the dollars. Having a position in dollars is a reduction of risk position. But if I put those dollars into contracts, then I'm taking more risk. Right. And so I actually plan on selling into dollars and also keeping them out of contracts, just be able to hold for the long term.
00:11:55.422 - 00:11:57.890, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree. The same plan.
00:11:57.960 - 00:11:58.194, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:58.232 - 00:12:25.190, Speaker A: So my money is not going to touch my traditional bank account, Wells Fargo account, where I'm earning like 0.1%, almost near zero. Just call it zero, 0% when there's crypto dollar, stablecoin, interest earning opportunities, like spanning from three to five to 10%. Right. And some of these are relatively low risk. Some of them are more risky than others. So it's exactly what you said, david.
00:12:25.190 - 00:12:36.318, Speaker A: The money, once it goes into crypto, it's like a black hole. It ain't coming out. Even if you're selling reserve assets because they're overheated like bitcoin or eth on the cycle, they're staying in crypto dollars.
00:12:36.404 - 00:12:41.434, Speaker B: All right, before you move on, Ryan, I really like that metric on the left that they have is custodial dominance.
00:12:41.482 - 00:12:41.854, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:12:41.892 - 00:12:43.918, Speaker B: So I was going to say really cool metric.
00:12:44.014 - 00:12:46.946, Speaker A: All right, so what does this mean? What does custodial dominance mean?
00:12:47.048 - 00:13:02.230, Speaker B: Yeah, it means what percentage of crypto dollars are trusted. Right. USDC tether. What has a custodian managing a dollar in the real world. Right. So this wouldn't include Dai. And so that's going to be an interesting metric to watch over time.
00:13:02.300 - 00:13:14.966, Speaker A: And it's at 93%, which is a little bit sad. It's a little bit sad face. Like, the trustless dollars have not succeeded against traditional crypto dollars yet.
00:13:15.148 - 00:13:31.530, Speaker B: Yeah. But they have such strong tailwinds because there's so many dollars out there, they're easier to get out the gate. There's less risk with them. They don't have to worry about solidity and code. They can just put dollars in a bank account and then make this claim that say, hey, we'll give you one of these if you give us a crypto dollar, blah, blah, blah, blah.
00:13:31.610 - 00:13:49.142, Speaker A: I totally agree. And guys, if you want to check out crypto dollars what they are in more long form content, check out our Jeremy Alair conversation. That was a few podcasts ago. Just look that one up. Okay. This is probably the biggest news. We're going to touch on it in the news, but let me just touch on the market piece.
00:13:49.142 - 00:14:13.680, Speaker A: So here's the thing. Coinbase just dropped their s one report. This is sort of the filing with the SEC that's public that they need to drop before they ipo, before they go public. We'll get into that in a second because that's in the news section. But I just wanted to highlight this stat that came from it, David, which is probably the most bullish thing I've seen this month, maybe this year.
00:14:15.490 - 00:14:16.094, Speaker B: This week.
00:14:16.132 - 00:14:42.114, Speaker A: Anyway, I'll get it back at least this week. And that's the Coinbase's volume. Okay. And they segmented it in their s one report. And there's a fantastic graph here that shows you what it looks like. And the bottom line is right now, in Q four 2020, Coinbase estimated that 36% of their volume was from retail. So only 36% from retail.
00:14:42.114 - 00:15:07.818, Speaker A: That means the rest is more from kind of institutions. That was totally different during the last bull run in Q one of 2018, the last bull cycle, it was 80% retail. Okay, now it's 36% retail. Before it was 80% retail. You can interpret this a few different ways. One interpretation is, oh my God, we're already here and retail hasn't even come yet. That's one interpretation.
00:15:07.818 - 00:15:09.562, Speaker A: What do you make of this, David?
00:15:09.706 - 00:15:35.730, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm reminded of in 2017, 2018, the memes that were going around to convince people to not sell was like, quote unquote, the institutions are coming. And back in 2017, 2018, we were right. They were coming just three years later. Right, much further down the line. But now the institutions are here. Right. This is clearly indicative of bigger, well capitalized entities coming and just dominating exchange volume over retail.
00:15:35.890 - 00:16:00.906, Speaker A: Yeah, I think retail beat institutions. The first bull run, it feels like institutions have beat retail a little bit, this bull run, at least for some of these assets, maybe not for defi type assets, but it also feels like we've got a lot of way to run from retail, like coming into this space. I'm sure we'll see some sort of retail frenzy before this is all over. David, you ready to get into the releases?
00:16:01.098 - 00:16:35.862, Speaker B: Yes, we. Absolutely. Let's get into releases. But first we're going to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol.
00:16:35.862 - 00:17:33.382, Speaker B: If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's v two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on Uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them. Check out the power of Ave@ave.com. That's aave.com if you want to live a bankless life, you need to get a monolith Defi Visa card Monolith is a one two punch of both an Ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your Ethereum wallet everywhere where Visa is accepted.
00:17:33.382 - 00:18:24.220, Speaker B: When you swipe your monolith Visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant, it actually makes a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet. It's insanely cool, and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life. Monolith also offers on ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defi, so it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to, and your deposited money goes straight into your non custodial wallet. So your money is never held by a centralized intermediary. Because monolith is native Ethereum infrastructure, the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of defi behind it. Swapping assets on Uniswap or earning yield in Defi is at your fingertips. Go to monolith XYZ and sign up to get your monolith visa card today.
00:18:24.750 - 00:18:37.234, Speaker A: Alright guys, we are back getting to the releases on this last week of February roll up. David, we got to start here. Optimism. Tell us what optimism is and what they're doing and why this is a big deal.
00:18:37.352 - 00:19:27.490, Speaker B: Yeah, optimism is favorable beliefs about the future, right? That's what it means to be optimistic. But optimism is also a scaling platform on Ethereum using some sort of, we call them optimistic roll ups, right? And where you settle optimistically, and there's some nuances behind that. But this post is about the point is that everyone is really bullish on optimistic roll ups and how they are constructed, and everyone is optimistic about optimistic roll ups. And what makes me optimistic about optimism is the crazy team that they are putting together. So they just put out this blog post called Dope hires and more main net in March. So they go through just a number of just really strong players that they hired onto the optimistic team. And I also loved the way that this article was written.
00:19:27.490 - 00:19:55.046, Speaker B: You can feel the ethos just exude out of the optimistic team the optimism exuding out of the optimistic team. Some really strong players here. And really what this means is that optimism is really ready to take it to the next level, right, and really get this thing out the gate. Business developers are on the team, more coders and more integration specialists, a lot of really cool things to come. I'm optimistic about optimism.
00:19:55.238 - 00:20:32.146, Speaker A: I could tell, David. All right, so the big takeaway from this, apart from their new hires, is that they are launching on Mainnet in March. Now, originally they were planning to launch on Mainnet in March in sort of a limited way with just a few pilot projects. Now it looks like they're going to launch, like, generally be open to everyone. And what roll ups. If you've been tuning into bankless so far, what rollups allow you to do is essentially copy all of the DeFi protocols we know and love on another chain. So these are fully ethereum virtual machine compatible.
00:20:32.146 - 00:21:10.766, Speaker A: So if Uniswap was to join this, Synthetix is already on it. If Uniswap was to join this, if YFI was to join this, if curve was to join this, we'd create a whole nother roll up chain with all of our DFI protocols, basically like a DFI roll up chain. So this is very timely given gas fees, very timely given the narratives in the space. And I think is absolutely going to be a massive launch event and then story going into 2021 as all of these D five money protocols kind of pick their various scaling solution. I think optimism is poised very well here. David. They also announced some additional investing.
00:21:10.766 - 00:21:42.960, Speaker A: We had Chris Dixon on the podcast not too long ago, and Chris Dixon and his firm, Andreessen Horowitz. So he sort of runs the crypto investing area at Andreessen Horowitz. They are investing. They just announced that they are investing in the optimism team, too. How much money are we talking about here? Wow. Part of a 25 million series a investment in optimism. So definitely some Runway for that team and super excited about what's going to happen next.
00:21:43.570 - 00:21:55.614, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the other VC fund that doubled down already had a share of optimism was paradigm, and they bought more. So paradigm doubling down on their bags.
00:21:55.742 - 00:22:22.778, Speaker A: Smart move. All right, we also have layer two coming from one of my favorite exchanges, decentralized exchanges, Dydx. Now, they're doing this with not optimistic rollups, but z cave rollups. But the net effect is similar in that they're going to be able to scale DydX to new levels without using Ethereum mainnet block space, but it will be just as secure as the Ethereum main net. David, any takes on this news?
00:22:22.944 - 00:22:49.986, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is going to be a theme in coming roll ups is Project X D five protocol, Y scales goes on to l, two optimistic roll ups or ZK roll ups or something. So get used to it, I guess, is my takeaway. Dy Dx. One of the first, I expect. Here's a prediction for you, Ryan. I'm just making this up right now. At least three projects will be on next week's weekly roll ups on some sort of l two.
00:22:50.088 - 00:23:22.222, Speaker A: Wow. Okay, we'll see. I'll try to remember that. David. One other thing I think that's important to realize is that there are different dimensions to scaling transactions per second is certainly one of them. But another one is, how do we scale oracles? And our conversation this week with Hart from the UMA protocol really impressed that upon me, David, it's like. So oracles, of course, are useful for everything in Ethereum that requires a price, and synthetic assets all require a price.
00:23:22.222 - 00:24:16.770, Speaker A: So the scalability of oracles is really essential for kind of the different assets and money primitives that we can create on Ethereum. Well, Chainlink has been one of the predominant oracle type solutions. One challenge with Chainlink is it costs a whole lot in terms of gas. These are validators on Chainlink that are paying this gas, but it costs them a lot in blockspace, in gas, in fees to push these prices on chain. Well, chain link just released a new upgrade that is going to drastically reduce the cost. Ten times more efficient to put pricing on chain than it previously was. This is another dimension of scalability that I think is underreported, David, but is just as important to what we're trying to do in Defi.
00:24:16.950 - 00:24:38.614, Speaker B: Right. There's two ways to scale. We can produce more block space, and we can do that with ZK roll ups and other l two s. L two s is generally building out new places to have block space, and then they bundle that up and then put that on the main chain. That's one way to scale. The other way to scale is to just simply optimize and be more efficient with what we put onto the chain. Right.
00:24:38.614 - 00:25:29.250, Speaker B: And so maker Dow, when they run their oracles, specifically Maker Dow's oracles, cost $20,000 to $30,000 a day in gas alone just to put prices on the chain so that the app can operate. There are optimizations that we could be doing here, and one of the strategies that Makerdao is doing, and is exactly the same kind of pattern that Chainlink is doing here, is they do a lot of their computation off chain in a trustless manner, in a cryptographic manner, and then they only publish the bare minimum on chain. Right. And so simply just doing less on the l one and optimizing what you do with the l one block space is going to be huge, especially for oracles. Right? Oracle optimization is really, really important. And there's other vectors as well. Aside from oracles, Coinbase uses like 20% to 30% of Ethereum block space simply because they're not well optimized.
00:25:29.250 - 00:25:41.418, Speaker B: And so block space will become more available when heavy computation teams like chain link maker, Dow, Coinbase, et cetera figure out how to optimize and put more of that computation not on the l one.
00:25:41.504 - 00:26:11.458, Speaker A: Yeah, David, I think every team is working toward optimization. We were talking to the Nifty Gateway co founders. They said in their next release they're going to reduce the minting cost of an NFT on chain by 99%. So it's awesome to see this sort of innovation and efficiency that these teams are bringing due in part to high gas prices. David, talk about this one. So Ave and balancer are partnering in some way. What are they doing here?
00:26:11.544 - 00:27:01.010, Speaker B: So if you guys are listening to this weekly roll up on Friday morning, when this comes out, we are doing a live stream with Stani from Ave and Fernando of Balancer, moderated by Dan Elliser. So something pretty unique on the bankless YouTube where it's going to be live streaming at twelve Pacific time. Definitely tune into that if you want to learn more about this. But basically what Aave is doing is using balancer as its backend as its asset management platform to produce yield for its deposited assets. Right? So balancer is kind of like uniswap, but instead of two tokens, it's many tokens. And so balancer and Aave are working together to make a balancer pool to generate liquidity for assets that are in AAvE, but also generate yields. And so it'll actually be more lucrative to deposit assets into AAvE because they're using balancer in their backend for liquidity and for yield.
00:27:01.010 - 00:27:04.258, Speaker B: Pretty cool. So tune into that live stream if you want to learn more.
00:27:04.344 - 00:27:48.126, Speaker A: Yeah, the way I understood this is if you are a liquidity provider in a balancer pool, right? You're not necessarily earning interest on those assets that are inside of the pool. And what this is going to do is essentially allow a portion of those assets inside of the pool to be earning interest in the Ave protocol. So super cool to see this kind of collaboration coming out, David. This is also awesome. We've been tracking this for a while. We've got all of these great nfts, but how do you display them? This is Zapper coming out with a user interface enhancement Zapper is just a fantastic tool, along with Xurion, to see kind of your crypto assets, your crypto portfolio. And now Zapper is extending that to nfts.
00:27:48.126 - 00:27:58.610, Speaker A: So you could see your super rare art that you purchased, your NFT art inside of the Zapper platform, inside of that wallet. David, what's your take here?
00:27:58.760 - 00:28:29.850, Speaker B: Yeah, there's so much to unpack here, right? So we got to start off with the conversation that nfts are status tools, right? So crypto dollars, ether, bitcoin, these are wealth tools. Nfts are status tools. Like the Mona Lisa is a status thing. Whoever owns the Mona Lisa, it's a big deal, right? Art is a status thing. It's a way to signal status. And one of the problems that nfts has is that typically if you buy an NFT, you can only view it on the issuing platform, right? So if you bought it on wearable, you got to go to rarible. If you bought it on nifty gateway, you got to go to nifty gateway.
00:28:29.850 - 00:29:21.790, Speaker B: There are aggregators like opensea that are helping with this. But this is exactly the same type of innovation that we're seeing out of zapper, where you can see your assets, see the actual visual representations of your nfts displayed here, along with the market value, right? And so not only can you include the value in your portfolio, you can actually make it display, right? And so I kind of expect some sort of specialization when it comes to people's crypto wallets that maybe they hold their funds in one wallet but their art in another wallet, so that they can flash their art. Right? Like show people what I own. Like all the cool nfts that I bought without having to dox all their funds. I think innovation like that is definitely coming. And it's really cool to see zapper being able to innovate on both the value of NFT sides and the display of NFT sides. Because what are nfts if they don't have a visual display of the art?
00:29:21.940 - 00:29:37.174, Speaker A: Yeah, I can't wait to see all the social signaling type wallets that come out of crypto given the NFT bull market here. David, let's talk about this. Alchemyx is releasing something. Can you tell us what Alchemyx is?
00:29:37.372 - 00:30:17.330, Speaker B: Yeah, Alchemyx is a new defi money Lego, right? Attempting to be relatively governance minimized, attempting to be protocolized. But the way that this works is that you deposit your crypto dollars right now. It starts starting off with DAi, and then the DAI gets deposited into urine to generate yield. And then Alchemyx will mint you al USD or Al stablecoins. So you deposit stablecoins and then you borrow stablecoins. But the thing is that if you are patient, you don't actually have to pay back your debt. So typically with DeFi protocols when you borrow you have to pay an interest rate.
00:30:17.330 - 00:30:54.910, Speaker B: But because Alchemyx has urine in the background urine, the interest that you get from depositing to urine automatically pays back the debt that you took when you borrowed Al USD. And so if you are patient, you just get free money, be it from the interest rate. So you deposit $100 of die, you get to withdraw 70 Al USD, but you don't actually ever have to pay that back. And eventually you can just go back to Alchemyx and withdraw your die or mint more Al USD. It's a system that auto repays your loan for you because it's generating yield in the background. So it's pretty cool.
00:30:54.980 - 00:31:31.382, Speaker A: That's super cool. And I think what the macro story here is now we're seeing like, I don't know, 3rd, 4th, 5th layer money Legos. Because this whole thing, Alchemyx is built on top of Wiren, which is built on top of all sorts of other lending and borrowing protocols, which is built on top of stablecoins, which is built on top of Ethereum. So we've got like, this is why we call it money legos, because we have these sort of stacking type effects and you can create things on top of other things. Now. Now we're seeing things being created on top of a yield aggregator itself on top of yearn. So that's pretty wild.
00:31:31.446 - 00:31:41.770, Speaker B: Yeah, I said that the Alchemyx protocol was governance minimized. I actually got that confused with something else. It's not attempting to be a governance minimized platform, but everything else I said was true.
00:31:41.920 - 00:31:52.766, Speaker A: Okay, thanks for clarifying, David. David Latice is doing some cool things. You just did an unboxing. They've got some lattices back in stock you want to give us a sneak peek of.
00:31:52.948 - 00:32:15.622, Speaker B: Yeah, so I did my first unboxing video. I'm not good at that, by the way. I realized somebody made in the comments, like it took them like four or 5 minutes to figure out what I was actually unboxing. I kind of forgot to tell them that it was a hardware wallet. Yeah. So I did an unboxing for a lattice one from grid plus. So if you want to know and get more intimate details as to what that's all about.
00:32:15.622 - 00:32:55.458, Speaker B: Go check that out. I go through the whole setup process so you can see what that's like, and then I kind of give my thoughts as to who the product is for, if it's really a good product for you or not. The metaphor that I came out with while I was making that video, Ryan, is this landline hardware wallet kind of. Is this the metaphor I'm working with? Because it needs to be connected to Wi Fi, so it needs to be in your home, right? And so if you want to make a transaction, somebody must be local to the unit, right? By definition. And that unit is in your own home. And so the lattice one adopts the security of your home, which is pretty interesting, pretty cool.
00:32:55.624 - 00:33:26.778, Speaker A: Well, guys, this is worth it just to see David peel off this look of glee as he peels off the plastic from his lattice display. It's just worth it just for that. David, let's end on this. On releases. This is actually like a future release. Tim Baco put together a GitHub proposal for EIP 15 five nine, the much awaited EIP, maybe the most awaited EIP in Ethereum's history. And he proposed that it be included in the London Eth hard fork.
00:33:26.778 - 00:33:57.510, Speaker A: So if I'm not mistaken, we have a date now for the next eth hard fork, Ethereum hard fork, which is in April, and that's going to be called Berlin. And EIP 15 five nine would not be in that April hard fork. It would be in the one after, which is estimated to be sometime in the summer, like June, July, August, that kind of time frame. And if all of this happens, and if this proposal is accepted, that would mean we would get EIP 15 five nine this summer.
00:33:58.410 - 00:34:44.982, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember earlier predictions, and I think even on the bullcase for Ethereum podcasts with DC, Eric, and Anthony, that we actually perhaps didn't even think about EIP 1559 coming into Q four or even Q one of 2022. The fact that Tim Baco, who, by the way, has the most information about EIP 1559, period, he knows the most. He runs the whole show like he's the organizer behind it. He's making a proposal to get it included into the London hard fork. So a proposal for inclusion is what you would need to see to get EIP 1559 included. This is the first step. So this proposal will be reviewed, and then the east one core developers will analyze whether this is ready for inclusion or not.
00:34:44.982 - 00:34:56.090, Speaker B: And if there is consensus among core developers, it shall be included in the London update, which again, theoretically slated for this summer. So we're on the way? We're on the way.
00:34:56.240 - 00:35:17.394, Speaker A: Absolutely. I mean, it could take longer than this summer. Sometimes hard forks have a tendency to be delayed, but this is overall good news. It means Tim thinks this EIP is in a place where it can be proposed and included huge. All right, David, let's get the news. Fedwire went down. Ethereum never goes down, but Fedwire did.
00:35:17.394 - 00:35:21.842, Speaker A: What is Fedwire and what chaos did this bring with it? Right.
00:35:21.896 - 00:35:40.694, Speaker B: So Fedwire is how the Fed transfers balances between banks. Right. The US dollar asset transfer mechanism between commercial banks and other banks. Right. And it broke, apparently. So centralized systems are fragile. They can go down because they're not redundant.
00:35:40.694 - 00:35:46.778, Speaker B: And I kind of forgot that the Fed wire could even go down. It's not really something you think about.
00:35:46.864 - 00:35:47.258, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:47.344 - 00:36:10.274, Speaker B: Your money system isn't supposed to break. Right. It's supposed to just work. But at the end of the day, centralized systems are fragile. Centralized systems go down like whoopsie daisies. And actually, I think this even got reported by the Gemini twins when they had to make an announcement or some sort of release saying, hey, deposits in and out of our exchange are being paused because this Fedwire thing is broken. So sorry about that.
00:36:10.274 - 00:36:17.726, Speaker B: Not our fault. It's the Fed's fault. Crazy. Absolutely crazy. That the dollar just has downtime. That's nuts.
00:36:17.838 - 00:36:57.762, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, this paralyzed a whole bunch of banks for a few hours, and it makes you think about cybersecurity attacks. What would that be like? It makes you think about somebody somewhere has a button they can press and power this whole thing down. A lot of centralization underlying the traditional banking systems of today. David, let's get back to what I think is probably the biggest news item. We teased it a little bit when we were talking about the market, and that is Coinbase's s one filing, it's notes, basically, the things it's publicly disclosing before it's about to IPo. I've got a few gleanings from this.
00:36:57.762 - 00:37:25.530, Speaker A: Maybe you could add yours, too. The first is 43 million verified users. That's massive, right? 43,000,002.8 million monthly transacting users. They are just crushing it. In terms of revenue, 2020 revenue was a two x from 2019 revenue. There's a lot more here, but what were some of your takeaways?
00:37:25.870 - 00:38:04.674, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just really cool to be able to access this information. I know a lot of data geeks like Nick Carter were really waiting for Coinbase to file this so that they could poke around. And so we are getting some early digestion from people like Larry Cermak, who works at the block. It's his job to digest information. So I think this is just the first of many big takeaways that we're going to get out of this Coinbase filing. And really, what this is indicative is that Coinbase, not really a well optimized company, kind of burning a lot of money, but they're making so much money, it doesn't even matter. And I think this is just going to indicate to the rest of the financial world that there is so much money to be made in crypto selling shovels.
00:38:04.674 - 00:38:13.546, Speaker B: You don't even have to believe in bitcoin, you don't even have to believe in crypto or the bankless vision. You just have to know that there's money to be made selling shovels here and a lot of people are going to want to get in on that.
00:38:13.728 - 00:39:13.998, Speaker A: Coinbase has 90 billion in assets on their platform, David, and they're getting ready to ipo at a market cap of 100 billion in valuation. If I'm a traditional bank at this point, right, I'm starting to get worried. I'm starting to sweat because it's not just like, maybe DFI is not on my radar at all, but Coinbase is on my radar. We were just saying that any of the assets that many people in crypto sell will actually stay in crypto dollars this cycle. Well, who really owns crypto dollars? It's these crypto banks like Coinbase and like, they totally own that. My Gemini account, my Coinbase account is so much more useful to me even than my Wells Fargo account, because it has this bridge into the world of Defi and it's also just very useful on its own. So if I'm a traditional bank, I'm starting to sweat a little bit.
00:39:13.998 - 00:39:32.338, Speaker A: These guys are coming and they're about to eat my lunch. And I wonder what some of the meetings are like on these executive teams, if they're kind of seeing it, if JP Morgan is seeing it, if bank of America is seeing it, if they're worried at all about what's happening here.
00:39:32.504 - 00:40:09.262, Speaker B: Ryan, earlier in this episode, we talked about what we're going to do when we decide that this bull market is close to being over and we sell into crypto dollars. Well, if we do ever want to get our, because we are bankless natives, we live with our financial monies in Ethereum, in our own wallets. But if we ever do want to bring that cash back into the world, where kind of the rest of people are, like, if we ever want to improve our local environment, if I want to buy a really expensive plant, I'm going to have to go through the crypto banks. And that's not Wells Fargo, that's not bank of America, that's Coinbase and Gemini. And if Gemini is rolling out a credit card.
00:40:09.316 - 00:40:10.046, Speaker A: Well, yeah, let me ask.
00:40:10.068 - 00:40:17.622, Speaker B: Coinbase is rolling out a debit card. And so what financial products are left for people like you and me from the legacy?
00:40:17.786 - 00:40:46.762, Speaker A: This is what I mean. So, David, you have your Ethereum account, which is like your bankless bank account, basically, and all of the Ethereum addresses that you have, right? What would it take for you just to live basically on your ethereum accounts and then also a Gemini account and completely shut down your traditional Wells Fargo account or whatever bank that you use? What would it take? Wouldn't it just take, my God, Gemini has a credit card, and then you can pay all of your bills. And then why do you need your account?
00:40:46.896 - 00:40:55.226, Speaker B: Right, right. Only to receive payments from other people that are not bankless. And then I can transfer it over to crypto anyways.
00:40:55.338 - 00:41:22.680, Speaker A: Exactly. And even know, it seems to me that somebody could build a very easy bridge so that you could receive funds in Gemini or Coinbase. I don't think these banks know that the writing is on the wall for them, but the writing is on the wall for them for sure. All right, tell me about Nyancat. I was embarrassed when we went over the notes. Dude, I've seen this all over the place. Like this meme, this cat with a rainbow, but I didn't know what it was.
00:41:22.680 - 00:41:25.702, Speaker A: What is it? And what's happening here?
00:41:25.836 - 00:41:55.730, Speaker B: Yeah. Nine cat is embedded into the Internet itself at this point. It's like one of the OG viral Internet memes that turned boomers in for a tizzy about like, what the hell is this thing? Why do people care? It's just this animated pop tart looking cat with rainbow coming out its butt, going through space. It just went through the Internet back. It's years ago. I don't even know what. Want to know what it could have been, like, early 2000s, right? Grand meme before crypto was even a thing.
00:41:55.730 - 00:42:39.662, Speaker B: And the original artist sold an NFT version of it for 300 E, which is almost half a million dollars. And I think what's really interesting about this, Ryan, is that the original artist remastered the Gif, as in, he probably just started over from scratch, right? He probably just made it again and just made a brand new gif. And then sold that gif that he made fresh new for 300 E. Right. And the point is there is that it wasn't the original gift because at this point, where is the original gift? He probably lost it because it's on the Internet. It's just like on the Internet. The point is that the original artist made a new gift that was the same as the old gift, but the original artist sold it for 300 E.
00:42:39.662 - 00:42:54.050, Speaker B: It's not about the Gif, it's about the legitimacy of the original artist being able to make that NFT. If I went and made a nyon cat NFT, I hope people would slap me around and be like, no, you don't have the rights.
00:42:54.790 - 00:43:04.806, Speaker A: And you could, David, right. You could just that gift from anywhere and list it on rarible or nifty gateway or somewhere else. But that doesn't give it the value is what you're saying.
00:43:04.988 - 00:43:18.170, Speaker B: Exactly. The value lies in the hands of the artist. And the artist himself was the minter of this NFT, which means that the artist himself has the rights to sell this NFT. It's not about the art, it's about the legitimacy.
00:43:19.470 - 00:44:01.258, Speaker A: That's so interesting. Right? Because what people are buying at the end of the day is, and without that authenticity, they don't get the social status, the signal boost that they're really looking for from these nfts. I wouldn't have always believed this was the case. I think even as recent as six months ago, you and I were trying to figure out nfts and is anybody really going to pay for a JPEG or a gif? And now it makes answer is yes, because they're not just paying for the digital imprint, they're paying for the authenticity. And you can't disagree with the market. The market is saying that people want nfts and they pay a lot for them. 300 e, man, that's crazy.
00:44:01.424 - 00:44:02.538, Speaker B: Super crazy.
00:44:02.704 - 00:44:24.180, Speaker A: All right. South Korea, banning privacy coins from crypto banks. I guess my quick question to you here, David, is, is this just the beginning of more of these? So, like, they're banning privacy coins like Zcash and Monero. Do you think that's going to be the future? One of the final bosses we have to deal with?
00:44:24.630 - 00:45:01.094, Speaker B: Yeah. Privacy coins are going to be a much more difficult subject than bitcoin and ethereum simply because of their nature. I kind of think it's not that big of a deal just because privacy coins don't have that large of a market cap. And really the story is store of value, right? Not privacy. We know from Chainlink, that less than 1% of crypto activity is crime. And so the value of privacy coins just aren't that big of a deal. And I think nation states just see the promise, the narrative behind privacy coins, and then they get scared.
00:45:01.094 - 00:45:28.774, Speaker B: But they don't look at the fundamentals. They don't really look at are people really using these things? And they also don't understand that at least my theory is that privacy is an application, not an asset, which means that there should be applications on Ethereum that let you make your dai private or make your eth private. That seems to be where I think the long term trends toward privacy will go. It's interesting to watch nation states try and control things, though. I think that is really the through line of this story.
00:45:28.892 - 00:46:27.270, Speaker A: Do you know what's interesting is the question of if bitcoin or ethereum had privacy on its base layer, just like baked in, and we had the technology to make every transaction private from the get go, because, you know, the people behind this movement would have if they could, but the technology just wasn't there. So we have pseudo anonymous addresses rather than completely anonymous addresses. But if we had done that, if it was baked in, do you think that nation states would have been much more hostile to these assets and these networks from the very beginning? I think it's very possible. I think it's possible that not having privacy baked into the base layer was actually a blessing, because it meant that the nation states weren't afraid of these crypto networks from the beginning and didn't try to strangle them in the crib, as it were. What do you think of that take?
00:46:27.420 - 00:46:49.358, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's possible. I think privacy at the base layer is a problem for other reasons, though, because privacy at the base layer reduces the auditability of these systems. Right. And so it's easier to audit bitcoin than it is Monero. It's possible to audit the supply of Monero. People thinking that you can't actually audit the supply of Monero, that's actually a miss. You totally can.
00:46:49.358 - 00:47:01.086, Speaker B: But the point is, of the ease of said activity and the ease of auditing the supply of ether. Transparency, again, transparency, in my opinion, is an app, not an asset.
00:47:01.278 - 00:47:14.454, Speaker A: David, we mentioned this last week, but Alpha Hamora had a hack. Alpha Hamora and cream. There was an exploit. Massive amount of funds were stolen. One of the larger DFI hacks. What's interesting, was it that big?
00:47:14.492 - 00:47:16.150, Speaker B: I thought it was $11 million.
00:47:16.300 - 00:47:17.366, Speaker A: No, I think it's not a small.
00:47:17.388 - 00:47:18.966, Speaker B: Amount of money it was closer to.
00:47:18.988 - 00:48:18.266, Speaker A: 40 million, if I remember correctly. So pretty large one. But what's interesting about this is this week they just announced a fund repayment program. So they are going to make anyone who lost assets in that exploit, they're going to make them whole. And the way they're going to be doing this is partially through the value of their tokens, which is interesting to me, David, because as we've seen in exploits in the past in DeFi, what inevitably ends up happening is token governance votes and decides to make any of those users who lost funds whole. We saw it in the BZX hack, we've seen it in other hacks. And I feel like at some level, what we've just reinvented is kind of equity, right? So if there is some major event, an issue in a publicly traded company, shareholders take the brunt of it, they get diluted rather than sort of debt holders or users of the platform.
00:48:18.266 - 00:48:32.880, Speaker A: And that seems to be the case here, which also implies that the value of a token underlying a protocol can act as a sort of insurance or as a backstop against these exploits. All of these things are very interesting to me. Do you have any takes?
00:48:33.410 - 00:49:21.994, Speaker B: Yeah, the Alpha token has not taken a hit, as you would expect any sort of protocol to do if they got hacked. People get scared, people flee, people sell. And so you're totally right. And this is actually much more formalized in the makerdao system, where MKR is not a theoretical backstop, it is the backstop, and it's in the protocol that it will get minted in case the system becomes insolvent. And so it's interesting to see newer DeFi systems to kind of take a more informal approach to that. But I think it's relieving to see that DeFi protocols find ways to make people whole again if something goes wrong. It's kind of the benefit of some of these DeFi protocols not being actually defi, quote unquote, is they're not actually decentralized, they're nice money legos.
00:49:21.994 - 00:49:33.138, Speaker B: But the team is centralized. And in the young genesis of these systems, human control over these systems is kind of nice. Right. We can actually repair holes as they come about. Right?
00:49:33.304 - 00:50:01.018, Speaker A: Repair holes via governance vote. David, let's take these two news items as one. So Michael Saylor, microstrategy, just bought another 1 billion in bitcoin. So that's big in and of itself. But square released some information. So square, the payments company, that they also have $170,000,000 worth of bitcoin on their balance sheet. What is these two stories, these two headlines signaling to us?
00:50:01.184 - 00:50:27.438, Speaker B: I'm not actually 100% convinced that the Michael sailor buys $1 billion of bitcoin is actually different from the last story that we reported on the weekly roll up. So they're all starting to blur together. I think he bought another billion dollars. They're all blurring together. But then also square, which already had $50 billion. Billion. Yeah, no, $50 million of bitcoin purchased on the balance sheet.
00:50:27.438 - 00:50:49.414, Speaker B: They bought another 170,000,000, and this was released in their quarterly report. And then also, very strong revenue numbers out of square from their cash apps, which is how a lot of people but make their bitcoin purchases. So in the same vein as, like, coinbase signaling to the rest of the world that bitcoin and bitcoin services are extremely lucrative, square is following up on that just as strongly.
00:50:49.542 - 00:51:06.786, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. All right, David, there was some tether news this week with the New York attorney general, if people remember, that New York attorney general was taking Tether and Bitfinex to task for, I guess, the backing of their stablecoin. What happened here?
00:51:06.968 - 00:51:40.054, Speaker B: Yeah. So there has been this apparently two year long probe into tether to just understand what is real and what's not real behind tether. And so they discovered that there was just some inconsistencies with their banking and what they reported and their public facing statements. Right. And so I actually haven't really gotten to the bottom of this story. I haven't figured. I may have been able to measure the severity of this, but my biggest takeaway is that banking for tether is a huge issue because they're kind of legally gray, legally dubious.
00:51:40.054 - 00:52:17.122, Speaker B: They're offshore. And so tether really has to kind of make do with what it's got and kind of get creative with its banking layer so that it can facilitate its tether printing and redeeming. Right. And so what that means is that there's different funds and different bank accounts. Some are totally controlled by tether, some are controlled by tether's lawyers, some aren't. There's just kind of this hodgepodge patchwork solutions that tether has made because of their nature, because they're kind of dupious. And then there's also tether trying to make very strong pr moves to make sure that people that use tether feel secure about using tether.
00:52:17.122 - 00:52:45.306, Speaker B: So there's a discrepancy between their alignment of their banks and the minting of tether. And so they got hit with an 18 and a half million dollar fine. And I don't know how malicious or irresponsible tether was being, but the market seems to be relatively okay with it. Perhaps this was one of the reasons why bitcoin dumped, but I kind of think bitcoin was going to dump anyways. I'm not totally on top of this story. There's a number of different threads to go on.
00:52:45.428 - 00:53:36.370, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. I do believe in the report it was evident that tether was not always backed one to one in dollars in a bank account somewhere. And tether will tell you that's because, hey, we couldn't get a bank account and the prosecution would say, well, no, it's because you were making money in other ways on those dollars and you're benefiting from not having them fully one to one backed regardless. The problem with all of this, of course, is that it kind of breaks the crypto mantra of like, it's not don't be evil, it's can't be evil, right? If on chain with Dai, for instance, we see all of the assets that are backing the Dai stablecoin, we don't see that with tether. It's kind of in these dark bank accounts somewhere. But the other takeaway for me, David, was that $20 million fine. You know what that is? It's a slap on the wrist.
00:53:36.370 - 00:53:38.974, Speaker A: It's nothing. It reminds me of eos.
00:53:39.022 - 00:53:40.226, Speaker B: They print that every day.
00:53:40.328 - 00:54:33.390, Speaker A: They print, like, who cares? Yeah, 20 million with eos. When the SEC found that they had listed and sold an unregistered security, it was a similar slap on the wrist, like $30 million. What's interesting about all of this is it seems to be the case, if you have enough money, you don't have to worry about regulation anyway, you're just going to get kind of a slap on the wrist out of this. So I'm not sure what lessons are being taken away from the crypto industry writ large, if any. But the lesson I'm getting is man open, transparent, decentralized protocols is the way we need to build this space so we're not building on rotten foundation. David, brave wallet, which is a browser that I use, actually brave the browser. They are releasing a crypto wallet, maybe sort of a metamask type competitor and also a Dex aggregator.
00:54:33.390 - 00:54:51.558, Speaker A: What this really signals to me is that they are doubling down in crypto. It's interesting to me because they have about 25 million monthly active users now, so it's no longer a small niche browser. They're kind of getting up there into the millions in terms of users. What do you make of this?
00:54:51.724 - 00:55:16.542, Speaker B: Yeah, crypto is Internet native finance, and you access the Internet through the browser. So this kind of just makes sense. Brave already had their native brave browser wallet, and now they are integrating the native brave browser. Dex aggregator. We also saw metamask do this. Like, metamask also has a Dex aggregator built in as well. So just more innovation being pushed out in every single corner of the Internet.
00:55:16.686 - 00:55:33.320, Speaker A: I love Metamask, but I would definitely love to see some browser competition to Metamask, to push metamask into building the best version of itself. So hopefully that comes to pass. David, that has been the news. Should we get to takes?
00:55:33.850 - 00:55:47.050, Speaker B: Let's get to takes. Absolutely. Wait, no, so rare. Click that. Click that link. Yeah, that one. So this is NBA Topshop, but for soccer, or what the international listeners might call football.
00:55:47.050 - 00:56:06.542, Speaker B: So this is really big. This is, I think, officially licensed. Yeah. So football clubs of Europe and around the world are on board with this. And football. Soccer is a lot bigger than literally every other sport. And so NFts into the mainstream in another way.
00:56:06.542 - 00:56:07.074, Speaker B: Here we go.
00:56:07.112 - 00:56:19.074, Speaker A: These guys have been out for a little while, but they just announced a pretty massive raise. Again, so pretty impressive. These are getting funded, of course. That comes on top of topshots, which raised at a valuation of multiple billions.
00:56:19.202 - 00:56:20.950, Speaker B: I believe, billion man.
00:56:21.020 - 00:56:28.470, Speaker A: So NFTs aren't just heating up in terms of sales and interest. They're definitely heating up in terms of investment as well.
00:56:28.540 - 00:56:30.220, Speaker B: Okay, now let's get to the takes.
00:56:30.750 - 00:56:43.518, Speaker A: Can we start with your friend Michael Burry? Yeah, your friend. You've talked about him before, when we had that GameStop rant. Who is Michael Burry and what is he talking about these days?
00:56:43.684 - 00:57:10.902, Speaker B: Yeah, Michael Bury is the character depicted in that movie, the big short. He's the hedge fund manager who shorts the market before anyone else does, perhaps arguably a little bit too early, but you never really know. And then he was also the guy that publicized that he was long GameStop before GameStop blew up. And so now Michael Burry is saying that inflation is coming. And this has been the bitcoiner thesis. This is the dollar is trash thesis. He thinks that inflation is coming.
00:57:10.902 - 00:57:40.826, Speaker B: And I think that's totally. I've been dabbling in this thought process myself for a while. And if Michael Burry says it, more and more people will believe it to be true, which actually kind of in the way money works, might actually cause the inflation itself. It's kind of a meme. But then also we also saw, this is not on this page, but we also saw Michael Bury publicly tweet about nfTs. He deleted that tweet, which is kind of sad. But Michael Bury paying attention to the macro world and protocols and bitcoin and stuff of this nature.
00:57:40.938 - 00:58:16.262, Speaker A: It's interesting because he's got some narrative steam behind him. I mean, he was right in 2008 in the biggest way because of the big short movie. Everyone knows he was right. And then more recently, he was right during the GameStop stock. He was right on kind of the price of that and the hedge fund manager shenanigans. So the question is, does he have the narrative power to make this sort of reflexive? And that's definitely interesting. But he also says that governments might squash bitcoin and gold in an effort to protect their currencies.
00:58:16.262 - 00:58:30.414, Speaker A: So he's just mapping this out, and he's saying, hey, if fiat currencies do start to hyperinflate, then world governments are going to start taking an aggressive posture on them. That was a take that Ben Hunt had as well. What do you think of that?
00:58:30.612 - 00:58:54.182, Speaker B: Yeah, this is definitely something to keep an eye on. He drew a connection between hyperinflation in 1920s Germany to kind of where we are today, and hyperinflation, or a very inflating currency goes hand in hand with very strong authoritarian governments. So the connection is there to be made. Yeah, we will see.
00:58:54.236 - 00:59:15.482, Speaker A: Okay, David, can we talk about this from. Or maybe let's just talk about this story. This is a room. What I'm looking at is a room in clubhouse. Clubhouse room. So maybe people need to understand what clubhouse is, explain that, and then why this is relevant.
00:59:15.626 - 00:59:38.930, Speaker B: Yeah. Clubhouse is a new socialization app. They brand it as, like, drop in chat rooms. So they're permissionless chat rooms. Anyone can join them. And then in each room, there will be a certain set of moderators who can elevate people to the speaking side. And so there's listeners and there's speakers, and this clubhouse club, which is called the Culture Club.
00:59:38.930 - 01:00:15.390, Speaker B: And they have apparently a number of these sessions. And importantly, it's specifically artists and creators, not crypto people, but a lot of artists and creators are getting into crypto. And so this particular meeting of this culture club clubhouse room was talking about nfts, and it's titled legitimizing nfts in the art world. And in this clubhouse club, in the meeting, this was last night, Wednesday night, when I was listening to this, and a bunch of other crypto people were in this room as well. There was beeple there. There was Bobby. I don't know his last name, but Bobby, the creator of the Hundreds brand.
01:00:15.390 - 01:00:23.922, Speaker B: There was also Grimes, the artist. Grimes, also Elon Musk's wife, if people aren't familiar with her music.
01:00:24.056 - 01:00:26.178, Speaker A: And she's releasing some nfts this week.
01:00:26.264 - 01:00:58.538, Speaker B: Releasing some nfts, right. And there were four and a half thousand people in this room. And when I got into this room a couple of minutes after it started and I wanted to talk because I can talk about nfts and kind of a public figure in the crypto space, and I raised my hand so they could perhaps invite me into the room. They didn't, because they don't know who I am because they're not crypto people. I'm a no one to them because they are not crypto people. They are artists. And this was a room full of artists, huge artists, beeple, grimes, et cetera.
01:00:58.538 - 01:01:21.330, Speaker B: Then they weren't there to shill their eth bags like I was. They weren't there to shill nfts. They were there talking about what they called a pivotal inflection point in history. And this is the quote that Jake Berman, who is a crypto person, put on his tweet. And this is what they said in this room. We are at a pivotal inflection point in history, specifically artist history. They don't care about Ethereum.
01:01:21.330 - 01:01:50.206, Speaker B: They don't care about Defi, they care about being able to culturally and creatively express themselves. And they are seeing nFts as the vehicle to do that. And this is so cool because when I shill nfts, or Ryan, when you shill nfts kind of comes with the bias that we are also by in proxy shilling ethereum, something that we believe in. These people don't have that bias. They are just here for the art. Yet they are shilling nfts because they see it as the next big thing. Wow.
01:01:50.308 - 01:02:29.158, Speaker A: So cool, man. What this says to me is that nfts have really hit escape velocity because it's expanded way outside of the original crypto culture. And now it's kind of invaded other cultures, and these other communities and cultures are building on top without even knowing that we exist, without even knowing that kind of cryptoculture and bankless and all of these things exist. That is pretty powerful. What about this? I think this is a quote that you tweeted out, too. And did this come maybe from Clubhouse? You said, we are recapturing the emotional value that platforms have robbed from us over the last decade. It sounds like a quote from one of those creators in that clubhouse meeting.
01:02:29.158 - 01:02:30.282, Speaker A: Is that where you got this?
01:02:30.416 - 01:03:06.280, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right. Somebody was talking about what has been robbed from them, the emotional energy that has been robbed from them, from these web two platforms. Instagram, Google, Facebook, all of these platforms that there are creators on. They say that these web two platforms have robbed them of their creative energy because they are intermediaries, because they are extractive. And so these creators are identifying the fact that these NFTs are a direct cultural expression vehicle and a fan connection medium. They're identifying that really early in NFT history.
01:03:07.050 - 01:03:37.540, Speaker A: It's almost like self sovereign creation. You know how we talk about self sovereign money? Well, these creators, they want to be sovereign over the creation that they make. And right now, in Web 20, they're going through intermediaries at every stage. Either they're going through an art gallery in the physical world, or they're going through something like Spotify, where they get cents on a song. And now they've got this new canvas, this new space to play this new kind of economy where they can go directly to their fan base. That's what they're seeing here.
01:03:38.710 - 01:03:51.126, Speaker B: That's exactly right. And it's so awesome, and it's very validating that non ethereum people are spinning the same narrative that we have, but in their respective camps. Really cool.
01:03:51.228 - 01:04:14.778, Speaker A: Super cool. All right, let's talk about this. This is Chris Berninski, one of our favorites. He just goes through the math. Here's what an 80% drawdown looks like. So if eth hit all time high of ten k this cycle and there was an 80% drawdown, what would that be? Two k. If bitcoin hits 300k this cycle and retraces down to 60k after an 80% drawdown.
01:04:14.778 - 01:04:39.830, Speaker A: And his takeaway is there's a chance that what you're buying at these current prices you're buying is actually the bottom of the next bear. So Chris has just thrown out some math, and he's just extrapolating what's happened three times in the past. This is now the fourth time it might be happening. He's just extrapolating the math and talking about how young we are in this bull market cycle.
01:04:40.330 - 01:05:02.394, Speaker B: Yeah, and this is some basic napkin math, but I honestly think kind of crypto does better with napkin math rather than any sort of more robust calculations. Let's just do some occam's razor calculations. And that's what Chris is doing. I believe it. Perhaps ten k is not the top for ether, though. Question mark. Maybe I'm going to have bull market goggles on.
01:05:02.394 - 01:05:03.114, Speaker B: I don't know.
01:05:03.232 - 01:05:25.378, Speaker A: Well, in December, right, we had that bull market podcast, and it was interesting. The range. We had Eric Connor who predicted top of the bull run might be 2500. And then we had DC investor who came in at his top prediction. And then Anthony Sasano is right in the middle at ten k. I feel like that's the range. And 2500 is definitely on the low side here.
01:05:25.378 - 01:05:36.806, Speaker A: But we could well past ten k if this bull run gets really heated. Hot. We made those predictions back in December when things were a bit more sober, so I tend to trust them more.
01:05:36.828 - 01:05:45.558, Speaker B: David, that's a good point. It's important to remember to not become more bullish just because prices are going up. That's not a reason to be bullish.
01:05:45.654 - 01:06:17.074, Speaker A: Exactly. All right, we'll talk about this reason to be bullish. This is you on Twitter. Ethereum will produce more jobs over the next decade than the top ten companies in the S and P 500 combined. You know what this says to me? More jobs, right? When you say more jobs, you start talking about a new economy that's being created. Is that what you're talking about? This new economy that's actually going to employ people like creators, like the creators making those nfts in clubhouse. That's what you're talking about, right?
01:06:17.192 - 01:06:57.982, Speaker B: Yeah. Not only that, but DFI protocol treasuries have millions and millions, hundreds of millions of dollars. I know for a fact sushi has like $200 million in their treasury. And that's just one protocol, right? Every single DFI protocol has a treasury, and they need laborers and workers to work for them. And so that's one employment vehicle. The other employment vehicle is exactly what you said, where NFTs offer creators a way to monetize their own labor, which is also huge, which means that they don't need bosses. Right? And one of the cool things about the jobs that I expect Ethereum to create are jobs without bosses are jobs without strict organizational hierarchies.
01:06:57.982 - 01:07:25.958, Speaker B: Right? They're just paying you. You put in $10 of labor. Here's $10, right? Maybe you have to do health benefits on the side, insurance, whatever. But the point is, Ethereum is this massively employing structure that isn't just allowing people to generate a livelihood for themselves over and over and over again in so many different ways. We talk about how much surface area Ethereum has that's also employment surface area. That's also job creation surface area. It's going to be massive.
01:07:26.054 - 01:08:16.220, Speaker A: You know what it kind of reminds me of kind of the gig economy, where we all became gig economy. Workers driving Uber cars and delivering food and all of these things. But the problem with the gig economy is still centrally controlled. It's centralized, and Uber is always going to take its cut. Right? This is like gig economy, only it's self sovereign gig economy, where you're working for yourself, you're also working for these protocols and you're creating, but it's not structured like a nine to five job. I think that's a huge takeaway for people. One of the benefits, I think, of going bankless is you start to discover how the new economy is going to work, and it's not going to work with nine to five jobs, and here's your paycheck, and here's your health benefits.
01:08:16.220 - 01:08:50.120, Speaker A: The new economy is going to work in these digital cultural ecosystems, and there's tremendous opportunities there. But you have to figure out how it works, right? You can't just go down the path that society has laid out for you, which is like, yeah, you go to school, you get to high school, and then you go to college, and then you expect that nine to five job and you could buy a house. Right? That hasn't worked for so many millennials. I don't think it's going to work for us now. And we have to be smarter, and we have to discover this new country, this new economy in the early stages so we can maximize the opportunity.
01:08:50.650 - 01:09:22.878, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right. And if people don't think that they can find a job in Ethereum, I think you're being a pessimist. The way I got started in crypto is I was working at a physical therapy. I was working as a physical therapy aide. And then I would go back home, and this is in the middle of the 2017 2018 mania, and then I would go home and just learn. And at some point, instead of going home and learning, I started going home and writing. Right? I just started producing, and I didn't do it because anyone paid me.
01:09:22.878 - 01:09:42.290, Speaker B: Why would they have paid me? I hadn't created anything yet, but I just started writing. And my first blog post got included in the week in Ethereum from Evan van Ness. And I was over the moon. I was like, wow, this is so awesome. I got included in the week in Ethereum, and it just snowballed from there. I just kept on writing. And then one day, medium deplatformed me, quote unquote.
01:09:42.290 - 01:10:03.974, Speaker B: I think I just triggered their bots or something. But then I made this tweet that was like medium deplatformed me, like decentralization. It turns out it was just a glitch. But then, Ryan, that's when you said, know, david's writing is really valuable to me. Like, what the fuck? Medium? Why did you do that? I ended up getting my medium back. It didn't really matter. But the point is, that's when I discovered that people actually cared about what I wrote.
01:10:03.974 - 01:10:28.614, Speaker B: And then that turned into a job at this ICO agency back in 2017. And then a security token agency, and then realty, and then bankless, right? It's all just rolled into jobs and jobs and jobs, because I just started producing. And if you don't think that that can happen to you, think again. People are looking to pay people in crypto for their labor. And if you want to get a job, all you have to do is try. It can be done.
01:10:28.732 - 01:10:50.634, Speaker A: I totally agree. The thing about that story, too, is, David, you're not a developer, you're not a coder. This is a technical space. Zero coding skills. And you've done so well to kind of create your opportunity here. There's so much more than coding that needs to be done here. Community management, media, these are all areas you can tap into.
01:10:50.634 - 01:11:06.146, Speaker A: The thing to do is start getting plugged into these communities and figure out where your niche is. I mean, your niche was fantastic. It was like writing, expressing these ideas, and creating these mental models. And it turns out that's super valuable for people. Really cool story.
01:11:06.328 - 01:11:19.702, Speaker B: Thanks, man. There are plenty of, actually, I would say, I mean, developers are extremely highly paid, but people that work on the social layer are also. People don't know. They need those people, but those people are really important.
01:11:19.836 - 01:11:30.566, Speaker A: Do you know what? I'm not going to say they're more important. They're equally important. Like, the social layer is so important in crypto important, and it's equally as important as what we write in code.
01:11:30.748 - 01:11:32.040, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%.
01:11:32.410 - 01:11:39.622, Speaker A: David, you know what? I have another take here, but I don't think we have time for it because it's kind of a longer take. Maybe we'll just refer to it in the show notes.
01:11:39.766 - 01:11:45.774, Speaker B: Well, it was a take that you had in the bank list discord. So premium bank list of members. Definitely saw that take.
01:11:45.892 - 01:12:35.040, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just like, we just heard your story, David, which is cool. I have kind of a personal story, but I used to be in the validator business. I used to run a validator in the cosmos ecosystem and some other delegated proof of stake ecosystems. And this is kind of a story of why I exited that essentially, and the TLDR was my experience as a cosmos validator left me more jaded on these delegated proof of stake systems, of which binance chain is one, which is why I was making this contrast and it made me more bullish on ethereum. Anyway, my full take is we'll include as a link in the show notes I tweet this out and it's also in the bankless discord. David before we get to what we're excited about, we should take a minute to tell the listeners about our fantastic sponsors who made this episode possible.

01:15:00.864 - 01:15:29.422, Speaker B: Yeah. Keeping the conversation going about Ethereum, the employer and nfts expressing creativity. What I'm really excited about, and maybe this isn't excited, but this is more about what's on my mind. I recently watched this movie called Nomadland, which was a story that followed this lady after the eight crisis, as she was kind of just a nomad living in a van, just hopping from state to state, trying to find work. And it was a sad movie. It was a depressing movie. It wasn't a feel good movie.
01:15:29.422 - 01:16:14.450, Speaker B: It was about the struggles of people's lives. After they lost their jobs and their homes, they were forced to live in a van and travel around America trying to find. Very, very reminiscent of the Great Depression, right? People traveling, trying to find work. And it hit me like a ton of bricks, dude. And I became very kind of sobered up about like, hey, what are we trying to do here in Ethereum? Because I'm 100% a believer that if we had Ethereum, we wouldn't have had the financial crisis. The financial cris is the perfect example of something that would have not happened under a financial paradigm, under the Ethereum protocol. And so what I'm excited for in the long term is about Ethereum's ability to prevent and reduce suffering in the world.
01:16:14.450 - 01:17:15.174, Speaker B: And that starts by employing people in a self sovereign way, giving people job opportunities that don't depend on financialization, that don't depend on just massive conglomerates of companies, and like Amazon and all these other just big centralized companies that just are the outsourcers of jobs. What I'm really excited for is to be able to create self sovereign money and financial tools for people to have a job that doesn't get rug pulled from them because we don't have a financial system that rug pulls the whole entire world. And so I was reminded about how important this whole Ethereum thing is. And it's really important that we get it right, because if we don't get it right, if the values and ethos behind these crypto systems, bitcoin and Ethereum, don't actually align with the people that they govern over, then down the road, that is systemic suffering and systemic badness. Right. And I want Ethereum to be good. Hold on.
01:17:15.174 - 01:17:16.680, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, sorry. Go ahead.
01:17:17.050 - 01:17:30.022, Speaker A: It's striking, David, I think, that how systemic problems cost individuals, like the casualties are people who are generally on kind of the lower rungs of society.
01:17:30.086 - 01:17:30.314, Speaker B: Right.
01:17:30.352 - 01:18:15.754, Speaker A: Like the weak and the vulnerable. Right. So there is such a responsibility for those who are early, those who are designing the system. And we, as users of these decentralized finance systems, honestly, as partially part of designing the social layer of these systems, have to make sure we design them in the right way, or else what you just said is there's a tremendous amount of responsibility on those who are in the ecosystem now, because we're saying, hey, here's this new financial system. It's better than the old get on the lifeboat. Right? But if our lifeboat has holes in it, if it's just the same as the boat that they just left, it'll cost people. So you're right.
01:18:15.754 - 01:18:37.614, Speaker A: There's a tremendous amount of responsibility in what we're doing here to get it right. And the honest truth is, there are some problems that aren't solved yet. Right. We have to make the base layer in general, and trustless blocks scalable. Right now, I think of, like, high gas fees. That's a problem. We don't want Ethereum to end up as a whale chain.
01:18:37.614 - 01:19:00.918, Speaker A: Right. That's a problem. User experience is a problem, and we have to make this accessible to everyone to be able to manage their private keys. Also, the mev problem we talked about in the past that keeps bubling up and surfacing its head. We don't want to create a whole bunch of insiders who can front run everyone else. So I'm going to have to check out that movie. So what's it called again?
01:19:01.084 - 01:19:08.454, Speaker B: Nomad Land. Yeah, nomad Land. It came out in 2021, and it was an indie film. Most people in the film weren't actors.
01:19:08.502 - 01:19:09.146, Speaker A: Which were pretty cool.
01:19:09.168 - 01:19:13.338, Speaker B: They were just real people again. Hit me like a ton of bricks, dude.
01:19:13.434 - 01:19:15.678, Speaker A: That's cool. All right, I'm checking that out.
01:19:15.844 - 01:19:19.290, Speaker B: Ryan, what are you excited about? Hopefully something a little bit sad.
01:19:19.370 - 01:19:33.922, Speaker A: It's less heavy. Anyway, we had Mark Cuban on the podcast this week, my friend, we did okay. David Bankless. The podcast is not even a year old. Actually. We celebrate our first year birthday. It's like March 2 or something.
01:19:33.922 - 01:19:52.106, Speaker A: March 1 or second. So it's next. Coming up, not even a year old. And we had Mark Cuban on the podcast. That is a testament, I think, to the bankless community. The reason we got on Mark Cuban's radar is because everybody kept hitting Mark up and saying, hey, bankless, get on the podcast. You're talking know you should talk to them.
01:19:52.106 - 01:20:05.134, Speaker A: You're talking Defi. You should talk to them. But that is absolutely huge and exciting. A few lines from that conversation, guys. You can check it out if you haven't already. It will be on the podcast on Monday. It's up live on YouTube right now.
01:20:05.134 - 01:20:07.630, Speaker A: Mark Cuban said he's learning solidity.
01:20:09.490 - 01:20:11.130, Speaker B: I can't believe that's insane.
01:20:11.210 - 01:20:18.882, Speaker A: I'm making in 2021. He schooled us in some ERC standards. What was the ERC? I'm going to forget it.
01:20:19.016 - 01:20:27.230, Speaker B: Yeah, it was 1155 which? 1155. An NFT standard, but also has some extra features built into it, which Mark knows plenty about, apparently.
01:20:27.390 - 01:20:55.770, Speaker A: Crazy, right? He knew what Euler beats were. This is an NFt that we talked about on the last. Like an audio NFT that we talked about on the last roll up. He is totally plugged. Know one of the things that I think stuck with me in the conversation, first he said get long, then get loud. Right? Was a takeaway for me about once you're in an asset position, this is what everyone does. Start talking about that.
01:20:55.840 - 01:20:56.800, Speaker B: Talking your.
01:20:57.250 - 01:21:27.734, Speaker A: I feel like we do a lot of that when we're talking about Eth and the values that underpin it. But the other thing that he got right was this statement. He said, community creates value. Community creates value. So three words. He was using that to describe nfts, but it's also true of a money asset, monetary asset like bitcoin and also of ether. So I was just blown away with the depth of his knowledge in kind of crypto and the takeaways there.
01:21:27.734 - 01:21:31.002, Speaker A: So, man, feels like we're going mainstream this year.
01:21:31.136 - 01:21:59.746, Speaker B: Yeah. When we bring on big names like that onto the bank list podcast and other people who I wouldn't call Mark Cuban like a crypto native. Right? And we also brought on Dimitri Kofinas and Ben Hunt and Raoul Paul. All these people, I wouldn't call them crypto native. And when you and I make these agendas for these conversations, I have this tendency to try and teach and I'm trying to not do that. And Mark Cuban was definitely somebody that didn't need any teaching, right?
01:21:59.768 - 01:22:00.382, Speaker A: No, he didn't.
01:22:00.446 - 01:22:19.014, Speaker B: He was on par with us and even past us in some technical knowledge in some realms. Right. He kind of still went down that blockchain, everything. Healthcare blockchain. I think he's going to drift away from that in the long term, just like I did. But other than that, man, his knowledge supersedes most people in this space.
01:22:19.132 - 01:22:37.486, Speaker A: Yeah, it was awesome. He really did his homework. If 90% of the vcs did that level of homework, they would be doing quite well on their investments in crypto. You got to put in the hard work, David. Let's get to our next section, meme of the week. This is the last and final section. Do we have two memes again this week?
01:22:37.588 - 01:22:54.814, Speaker B: Yeah, we do have two memes. Well, they're really good. One of them is a little self serving because one of them is about me. But this first one is coming out of our podcast from this Monday. L two avengers assemble. We got Robbie from immutable. We got Justin from synthetics.
01:22:54.814 - 01:23:10.266, Speaker B: And then we got Matt from loop ring. Matt is Iron man, who. Justin is Captain America. And then Robbie is Thor. Is that who Robbie is? Yeah. So we got the l implementers assembling in this meeting. It's pretty good.
01:23:10.288 - 01:23:46.418, Speaker A: This is just awesome. Crypto wife Twitter handle needs to NFP for sure. Here's another one. Dude, I laughed out loud when I saw this. This is David's background, right? And it starts, if you can't see it on YouTube, it starts in January, and he's got some plants behind him, and then it goes to February, and he's got more plants. And then march, and then in April, he turns into Groot, and he's got like an entire jungle behind him at this point. And I think the comment is, the state of the nation is sprouting.
01:23:46.418 - 01:24:02.170, Speaker A: This is probably a comment on the growth of crypto. And everything in the bull market was just hilarious, dude, at one time I thought I could outplant you. Like, I tried, made some people attempts, and then I was just like, dude.
01:24:03.710 - 01:24:04.650, Speaker B: It'S not going to happen.
01:24:04.720 - 01:24:11.690, Speaker A: It's not going to happen. So I've just given up on that pursuit. You are definitely the king of plants, my friend. Yeah.
01:24:11.760 - 01:24:26.114, Speaker B: I will say that the plant population behind me actually tracks the price of ether. This is actually what we're seeing. This is just a proxy for ether price. So when we see ten k ether, like, damn, is it going to be planty in here.
01:24:26.232 - 01:24:36.274, Speaker A: Wow. That sounds like a commitment that you just made, David. So we'll look for that. The greener it gets on Eth price, the greener David's background gets.
01:24:36.392 - 01:24:57.738, Speaker B: What's going to happen? Guys, this is a complete side note, but I did read this book one time about human connection and psychology to planet Earth. And apparently humans that see the color green more often are less depressed. And I connected that to plants, but I think you just connected it to the green candles, which I think green candles make me less depressed, too.
01:24:57.824 - 01:25:21.914, Speaker A: Green candles do make me happy, and we've seen a lot of them, so a lot to be happy about these days. I'm feeling really good about the time in crypto we're in. There's a lot of building, a lot of good stuff happening. If you're here along the journey, you're still early, and it's just a good time to be in crypto. Absolutely. So, David, we should cut off right there. Let me do risk and disclaimers.
01:25:21.914 - 01:25:32.726, Speaker A: Eth is risky. Bitcoin is risky. So is Defi. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the bankless journey. Thanks so much for joining us.
01:25:32.726 - 01:25:34.580, Speaker A: This has been another weekly roll up. Take care.
