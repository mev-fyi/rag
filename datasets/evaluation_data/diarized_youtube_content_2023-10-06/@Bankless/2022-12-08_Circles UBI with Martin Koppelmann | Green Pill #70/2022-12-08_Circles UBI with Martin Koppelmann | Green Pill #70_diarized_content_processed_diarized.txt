00:00:04.490 - 00:00:43.206, Speaker A: What's up friends? How you doing? On this episode of the Green Pill podcast. We are talking to Martin Coppelman of Gnosis and Circles. UBI. So in this episode we talk about Circles UBI, which is a web of trust based mechanism for doing digital identity. And then once we have digital identity there, then there is a UBI of a UBI that is distributed in Circles tokens. So basically we talk about web of trust, we talk about Circles UBI. In this episode we talk about Gnosis'larger approach to building a house of brands into building products, which for me is know inspirational as I'm figuring out what's next for me after Gitcoin.
00:00:43.206 - 00:01:13.262, Speaker A: So Martin's, just for those who don't know, he's a luminary in the space. I mean Gnosis is one of the OGS in the web three ecosystem and it's just really fun to talk to him and hear how he talks about this. I'm really great to see the builder of Gnosis Safe and Cal Swap and Gnosis chain also building regen web three stuff with Circles UBI. And I just think it's cool. So I think that coordination, you will find this episode to be cool. Also, without further ado, I give you Martin Coppelman of Gnosis and Circles. UBI.
00:01:13.262 - 00:01:13.842, Speaker A: Enjoy.

00:03:04.330 - 00:03:06.200, Speaker A: All right. Hey, Martin. How's it going?
00:03:06.810 - 00:03:08.806, Speaker C: Hey, very good. How are you?
00:03:08.988 - 00:03:17.610, Speaker A: Pretty good. Thanks for agreeing to do this episode. Really excited to talk about circles. UBI. So let's get into it. What is circles. UBI.
00:03:18.830 - 00:03:37.554, Speaker C: Yeah, Circles UBI is, in a way, two things. One, kind of an identity system. But the primary thing is it tries to bring universal basic income into the world by creating a new currency, a better form of money.
00:03:37.752 - 00:03:42.500, Speaker A: Got it. So what is that currency and how does it work?
00:03:43.110 - 00:05:10.334, Speaker C: Yeah, essentially, I guess, Bitcoin came along and opened up the question or made us humans think about what money is again and how money could be designed. And obviously kind of that it can be designed, I guess, outside of a state. And Circle CBI realizes this potential that we can design money different and says, okay, what if we bake in the idea of universal basic income directly into the money system? And kind of there are two arguments for that. One, you might be convinced generally that it's a good idea to want a UBI. And then you can either say we take an existing money system and then somehow have a redistribution mechanism, somehow collect money and then distribute it. Or if you want that anyhow, then you can also directly kind of bake it into the money itself. That's kind of .1
00:05:10.334 - 00:06:02.190, Speaker C: for circuit GBI .2 is that with every money system, you might ask, why would people want to adopt it? And it needs to have a perception of fairness. And obviously, kind of, let's say with Bitcoin, you have those early adopters, and those are really keen that everyone will adopt Bitcoin because essentially that would mean a huge wealth transfer to them. So an alternative perspective is simply saying, okay, we want something similar as Bitcoin, but we want to have a fair distribution of the money. And, yeah, that's another perspective of looking at Circles.
00:06:02.870 - 00:06:28.330, Speaker A: I'd love to maybe ground the user in an example of how works, and, oh, man, I remember signing up for Circles UBI about a year ago when it was really going viral. And so I'm wondering if you could talk about that first time user experience. What do you have to do in order to get the Circles UBI tokens?
00:06:29.150 - 00:07:34.446, Speaker C: Right. So, yeah, in Circles, as soon as you sign up, you get one Circle an hour. So kind of one circle represents, in a way, one human hour. But Circles has a kind of specific civil resistance mechanism that's based on a web of trust. So kind of the standard way to kind of sign up for it is to connect to other people or concrete, the interface is designed in a way that you need to be trusted by three people who have already joined the system. And again, there are two reasons why it works that way. One is indeed a civil resistant aspect, but the other is even more important.
00:07:34.446 - 00:08:38.260, Speaker C: The other is that money is always or money is essentially a social construct. If you are on an island alone, then money really doesn't matter because money is always kind of tied to humans. Money is only relevant to humans. So humans decide to accept something as money and that is essentially what this trust connections means. So in circles actually, if you look under the hood, everyone individually issues their own specific token. So in that sense their own kind of money and trusting each other means if you would trust me or if we trust each other, then essentially what we are saying is I am accepting your money, your personal money.
00:08:39.990 - 00:08:40.546, Speaker A: And you.
00:08:40.568 - 00:09:35.010, Speaker C: Are accepting my personal money. And to make things kind of ideally easy and ideally to be able to abstract away from the fact that in circles you hold very different forms of money, distrusting each other means we are kind of making our currencies with each other fungible by saying we can exchange them one to one. So if you're new to circles, you issue your own money kind of then no one would accept it. But if you are part of a circle, of a web of trust, then within that circle or within those trust connections, your money or your circles are fungible and can be transferred.
00:09:35.510 - 00:10:17.490, Speaker A: So we had a couple of episodes ago, we had Brian Ford who is a professor that's been studying civil resistance on the podcast and he was saying that basically in order to create civil resistance, you have four have in terms of mechanisms to connect the system to an actual user. You can use biometrics, you can use government identification like KYC kind of stuff, you can use presence based things which is like you're in front of me so I know that you're a human. And then the last one is web of trust where I trust you and you trust Alice and Alice trusts Bob. And so there's a flow of social trust and it seems like from what you said that Circles UBI is based on web of trust. Is that a correct perception?
00:10:17.910 - 00:10:55.260, Speaker C: Oh, absolutely. In its pure form it's completely based on web of trust. It is possible to add other forms to it so that is not or kind of only experimentally live, but we have features coming up that you can kind of get additional attestations or verifications to your account and that could indeed be, well, the other options you mentioned. But at its core circles is based on this web of trust. Exactly.
00:10:56.210 - 00:11:23.014, Speaker A: Basically I sign up, I have to get a vouch of some sort from three people that I know and then I can start getting the token drip. So it's basically a mechanism through which the sign up flow is baking in the creation of the web of trust. And then once I'm in, then the system releases UBI tokens to me. Is that more or less cool?
00:11:23.212 - 00:11:23.526, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:23.548 - 00:12:03.614, Speaker A: So? I mean, I'm curious. I really have a thesis about a lot of these regen mechanisms. Okay, so first off, going from one token, one vote to one human, one vote, I think is a really huge step forward for the ecosystem because it brings more democracy into how we build these web three mechanisms. So I think that in its own is really novel. I found that for anyone to really take seriously any of these civil resistance mechanisms, there has to be like an economic mechanism that causes people to care enough to sign up for the civil resistance. Like on Gitcoin, it's like you do all the trust bonus stuff because you want to participate in the grants matching. Seems like on Circles, UBI, you do the web of trust thing because you want to get the UBI tokens.
00:12:03.614 - 00:12:29.370, Speaker A: And I think it's interesting to know that there's almost like two parts to the system. There's the civil resistance identity mechanism and then there's the reward mechanism. And Gitcoin uses quadratic funding circles, UBI uses UBI. Can you say more about the UBI end of the spectrum? Like, why did you guys decide to go with UBI for this as opposed to some other reward mechanism?
00:12:29.790 - 00:14:27.650, Speaker C: Yeah, I would go to this question, but before that, I would also raise intention for another aspect of it. You mentioned there needs to be economic incentives, and yes, there is an economic incentive to kind of sign up to get cubi, but there's also a very interesting other element of it which I think is missing in many other web of trust systems. And that is the opposite of a reward, in a way, kind of a penalty. Obviously, the concept of web of trust has been around for a long time, going back to PGP, and of course also projects like Bright ID and there are plenty, but it's not always clear what it means or kind of how valuable is the information that you are trusting someone. So in a way, for example, let's say on Facebook or on Twitter, you like someone or you follow someone, and the question is, how valuable is this information? And with circles, there is an interesting aspect that if you are too loose with trusting people so let's say there's a random telegram group and people ask, yeah, please trust me. And you trust them and you don't actually verify that it is a real person, then in circles you are potentially losing money. Because what you are doing by trusting them is you are saying you accept their circles.
00:14:27.650 - 00:16:11.380, Speaker C: Or even more, you are agreeing that they can exchange their circles for yours. And now that means as soon as your circles have some value and that can easily be established by you yourself putting up some liquidity for your own personal circles. Then by trusting someone else, you essentially say their tokens again have the same value. So now this other person can take now let's pretend this other person is now indeed a bot or someone who tries to spam the system and you kind of just blindly trust them because they ask whatever on Telegram to be trusted. They can now take their essentially worthless tokens because you can obviously create hundreds of accounts and exchange them against your tokens that actually have value because let's say you simply put up some liquidity against the stablecoin for them and yeah, they can essentially then drain. You get a bunch of their personal tokens and they run away with the stablecoin and now kind of their personal tokens because others might very well be more careful and will not trust this person. Then essentially you end up with Circles that you can't use and you can't spend anywhere in the system.
00:16:11.380 - 00:16:53.070, Speaker C: So yeah, that's why there are kind of those two important economic incentives. There is an economic incentive to get connected and to build as many trust connections as possible because that means your circles are valuable in the network, because there are people that are willing to accept them. But at the same time it's also important to not connect to people where others don't want to connect to because they are fake accounts. In my view, that's a very important additional dynamic.
00:16:53.670 - 00:17:29.114, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really kind of an elegant design, I think the way web of trust works with respect to the identity system. And it's just kind of beautiful to see people experimenting with these regen mechanisms live in the wild. I mean, it seems like Circles has gotten a good amount of adoption and that you're pouring some resources into it. Could you say what excites you about working on this problem space after you've had many other successful projects? Of course, but I'm curious what kind of lights you up about this specific one.
00:17:29.312 - 00:18:28.254, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure a little bit of the history of circles we started or launched or kind of the idea has been around for many, many years, I think seven or eight years or more I believe. And initially it was described as a fork of bitcoin because back in the days bitcoin was the only thing that existed after many years and essentially ethereum coming along and making it possible to program a system like Circles. It launched roughly two years ago. And indeed after the launch, well, there was quite significant hype. Within three weeks, roughly 200,000 people signed up. But then unfortunately, it was still quite early, so there were all kind of technical problems. The team was very small.
00:18:28.254 - 00:19:53.960, Speaker C: It was actually just a two developer team. So then kind of after this initial hype, things slowed down significantly and there was not for a while, not much you could do with Circles. However, now, two years later, we are again, we are now in a good period to reactivate or a lot of circus activity. So there is a quite active local community in Berlin with at least monthly markets and quite a couple of places in Berlin where you can buy all kinds of things with circles. There is a larger program in Indonesia and Bali coming up where there's a team planning a rollout on circles, but also for the initial crypto community that mainly signed up two years ago. We are currently planning some relaunch and specifically this idea to bring liquidity behind your own personal circles. What excites me about the project is still the question of.
00:19:55.690 - 00:19:56.406, Speaker A: What is a.
00:19:56.428 - 00:21:13.662, Speaker C: Good form of money? Maybe. Yeah, maybe. What's a good, decentralized stablecoin? Actually, so far we are seeing all kinds of stablecoins and also all kind of stablecoins. Failing and encircles to me has a promise to be actually a form of money that is used in day to day transactions, but that is deeply rooted in existing social relationships. So it's not kind of just some speculative bubble that's disconnected from the actual economy. Ideally, it's very connected in people. So in a way, the circles, every individual circle is in a way backed by the person that is behind that circle and so by the economic activity this person is doing and of course, its network.
00:21:13.662 - 00:21:20.470, Speaker C: So everyone who's trusting this person, that's really what backs every individual circle.
00:21:21.450 - 00:22:32.190, Speaker A: It's really interesting for me to think about how powerful web of trust mechanisms can, and I think that the reason why I believe that they can be so powerful is that web of trust is basically how Google invented PageRank and became the number one search engine in the world and a technology giant. So every time you go and when Larry and Sergey were writing PageRank, they basically realized that any link from one site to another site was a vote for that second. You know, if you distribute reputation points along a web of trust graph, then that's basically what PageRank is. And it's really neat to see that algorithm be reapplied in the Web three ecosystem as people vote with each other over who has credibility. And that creates legitimacy, I think, for Page rank, because you always get the best stuff at the top. But with respect to the monetary system inside of circles, UBI, there's a similar amount of legitimacy that's bootstrapped there, and it's just kind of a novel way of constructing an economy there. So I don't know if you have any comments, but know for me the Bleachers, what is especially elegant about this mechanism.
00:22:32.610 - 00:23:13.050, Speaker C: Yeah, and I absolutely hope or we also want to make it easier to use this web of trust graph in other contexts. So, I mean, there are plenty of applications, but one just very obvious one is, let's say a rating system which currently get gamed all the time by all kind of civil attack and bot attacks. So you could very well imagine to wait ratings by the distance of that other person that is rating in your Web of Trust graph.
00:23:13.630 - 00:23:37.010, Speaker A: So it seems like there's sort of an Iterative process. Like the attributes of the system is that the UBI is paid at a periodic interval. It's unconditional, right? This is universal basic income. It's paid out on an individual basis. And I also see this thing about cash payment there. But does that just mean that it's the Circles token that people are getting?
00:23:37.080 - 00:23:37.700, Speaker C: Yes.
00:23:38.870 - 00:24:15.514, Speaker B: Working in web three is awesome. It's freeing, powerful and so much fun. But working outside of the typical W two employee structure is a deal breaker for so many. Opelis is helping the self sovereign worker focus on what they do best their work, while managing the back end for them. There is a lot of nation state overhead when working in web three, and Opolis takes care of all of the back end stuff, freeing you up to do what you do best. Opolis leverages group buying power through a community employment coop, helping you save 20% to 50% on high quality, affordable healthcare options through Cigna. So do what you love and maintain your financial security with Opolis.
00:24:15.514 - 00:25:00.586, Speaker B: You must be authorized to work in the United States to receive Opolis benefits. But Opelis is expanding its services to Canada starting on January 1, 2023. So book a 30 minutes consultation with the Opolis experts and join Opolis by December 31 of 2022 and get 1000 work tokens and 1000 bank tokens when you sign up. So go to Connect Opolis Co bankless to get started. Goldfinge is a decentralized credit protocol with a mission to connect the world's capital to the world's growth. Goldfinch focuses on real yields from real companies, so start lending your USDC to real businesses, driving growth worldwide. Goldfinch's borrowers are proven fintechs and credit funds in emerging markets who need access to Goldfinch's capital to drive economic growth in regions faced with barriers to financial access.
00:25:00.586 - 00:25:34.566, Speaker B: In just under two years, Goldfinch has loaned over 100 million USDC, reaching over a million people and businesses across 28 countries. Goldfinch is doing what DFI was always meant to do expanding financial access to those who have historically been shut out of the TradFi system. So become a Goldfinch member to put your USDC to work. Empowering real businesses, grow. Join Goldfinch's new member vaults to be an active investor and take part in supporting Goldfinch's security and expansion. Receive yield enhancements generated by protocol revenue plus access, exclusive communication channels and more. So go to Goldfinch Finance to get started.
00:25:34.748 - 00:25:43.660, Speaker A: Well, so what's on the roadmap next? What are you all planning on doing with Circle's UBI next? And how can people get involved in play with the.
00:25:46.990 - 00:27:08.594, Speaker C: So as? Yeah, we want to make it easier for people in a way to signal they are serious about their own circles and that is by or kind of one easy, or there are at least two mechanisms to do that, and one will be to simply put some money behind your own circles. Yeah, whatever could be dai stablecoin. And the other mechanism is of course to concretely offer things that, let's say you're a freelancer and you are kind of saying I'm willing to maybe not to accept Circles as a payment for my work. Those kind of things really make your own personal circles valuable. And so far we didn't really offer great ways to do that. So that is coming then as soon as those mechanisms are available. We are also working on a second concept, um, to form groups.
00:27:08.594 - 00:28:53.426, Speaker C: So the, the pure web of trust mechanism is quite powerful, but also complex and makes a few use cases hard. So you need to kind of remember, if you trust 50 people, let's say, then your total circle balance can actually be 50 different tokens of all those 50 people you trust. And that makes it a bit hard to integrate circles into, well, the ethereum ecosystem. So let's say even on Gitcoin, let's say someone would want to accept Circles donations, then circles isn't really exactly a specific token, it's thousands, 10,000, hundreds, thousands of tokens. And again, that makes it just practically harder to deal with it. The second issue is again, in a way, everyone is individually responsible for making their own personal circles valuable by again saying I offer something for it. So groups can be or groups are a very human thing and kind of if you want to get something done, like a universal basic income, it always relies on groups.
00:28:53.426 - 00:30:32.994, Speaker C: So if you are alone on the world, you cannot receive a basic income. So you will always receive a basic income from your group, from a community. So with groups, or we add a layer to circles where you can simply define a group and there can be various rules. So it could be a group could be a dow where there's some process to become a member of the group, but a group could also be based on some attestation. So group could be you need to do this verification process, whether it's biometrics or kind of there's this proof of humanity, or there are a bunch of processes too, and each of those could be a group. And now we are able to say, okay, let's say there are 1000 Circles accounts that all belong to a specific group, then we can create kind of a circles group token that is exclusively backed by the individual circles. So essentially it means if you are a member of that group, you get the right to take your personal circles and put it kind of into the group contract and mint at that moment the same amount of those group circles.
00:30:32.994 - 00:31:00.080, Speaker C: So now it's a bit easier simply to do things like establish liquidity or establish simply value or trust in a way circle or group circle because again, it's now no longer backed by a single individual but by a group. And obviously groups can be more powerful, I guess.
00:31:00.450 - 00:31:44.186, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd be really interested to see I'm saying we as in the royal we, but this ecosystem can create interop between all these different web of trust and reputation systems that are being created. DIDs verifiable credentials soul bound tokens. Civil Resistance is just so high upside for the web that I wonder if there's a way that the sum of all these systems can be worth more than each of their parts. And by these systems I'm thinking of all the green pill episodes we've done on civil resistance. Gitcoin passport, WorldCoin bright ID, proof of humanity. All of these things. It feels like there's a lot of great experimentation in the area and I can't wait to just see us have more of a one person, one vote money Lego.
00:31:44.186 - 00:31:45.470, Speaker A: It's going to be really powerful.
00:31:46.210 - 00:33:01.714, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. And we are aware of all those other and are happy to connect as much as possible on this note, it's kind of quite a technicality, but I think it's an important one in circles. We have very early on decided that smart contract identities are important. So every circle user is actually kind of a nosis safe. And the important thing here is that we believe that is a much more durable identity than EOA private key because sooner or later your key might get compromised or you lose your key. So we don't think that's a good thing for an identity that ideally you could use for your whole life. Smart contract allows you to change the key later, to upgrade the key, to upgrade the account, to have social recovery mechanisms.
00:33:01.714 - 00:33:16.810, Speaker C: So we see whether you want to use the word solvon token. But an identity in our view cannot be a private public key pair.
00:33:17.950 - 00:34:01.000, Speaker A: Truly neat that you're reusing Gnosis safe there. It feels like there's a strategic complementariness between the different products in the Gnosis Safe portfolio sorry, in the Gnosis portfolio and then probably the wider ecosystem of Money Legos as well. So I think that that's really cool, I guess like zooming out a little bit. I'd be curious, sort of. I know that you're really involved in Gnosis and I know that Gnosis has multiple products safe just spun out on its own. Zooming out. Do you see circles eventually spinning out of Gnosis one day? Also, is that kind of the model that you all are moving towards is incubating projects and then spinning them out?
00:34:02.810 - 00:34:52.922, Speaker C: Yeah, although I think circles is an exception. So with Gnosis we did well initially. We started with prediction markets, but back then simply so much infrastructure was missing, like a wallet. So essentially the backstory of the Nosisafe is that many years ago we wanted to do a token sale but there was no multistick wallet that could handle tokens. So we wrote a multistick that can handle tokens, and that then later became the Nosisafe. Then other things like cowswap also were initially meant to or well, we wanted to build prediction markets. There were no really exchanges or decentralized exchanges, so we needed to work on those first.
00:34:52.922 - 00:35:56.910, Speaker C: And those two projects then later spun out of Gnosis. Circles is an exception because Circles was never part of Gnosis. So with Circles, the only connection is me. I again came up with the idea of Circles many years ago, but then a community formed around this idea. And when Circles was launching two years ago, I was actually just on the sidelines involved and I kind of always tried to support the various teams that have been working on or around Circles over the years. But yeah, it was never a Gnosis project. However, now there is another connection again, and Gnosis will probably start to supporting Circles more.
00:35:56.910 - 00:37:00.660, Speaker C: Because Circles launched on back two years ago, the ethereum was obviously way too expensive, gas price wise for a project like Circles, where the intention is you can make a payment, whatever, you can pay your coffee with it. So it launched on XDI, one of the few side chains available at the time. And year ago, Gnosis merged with XDI and turned XDI into Gnosis chain. And now that is actually our large focus on Gnosis. So Safe and Carlswap are spun out and Gnosis is now really kind of doing Gnosis chain. And Circles is one of the most important applications on Gnosis chain. So in that sense, there is now the connection again, and Gnosis will certainly support Circles however it can.
00:37:02.310 - 00:37:54.340, Speaker A: Right. It's really neat how Gnosis is kind of incubating this house of brands, gnosis chain, Gnosis, Safe, Calswap, Circles, UBI. And for me, as you may know, I recently left Gitcoin Dow, and I'm no longer in a leadership position there. And they have their own independent, autonomous governance. And I think that this super modularity where you have each product has its own governance and contains scope, but there's strategic complementaries between each of the things is a really elegant way to build a house of brands and to just do more than you would be able to do with one large monolith. So I'm seeing some parallels between what you're doing with what we've been doing in that respect, although Gnosis is huge and very successful, and so I'm a big fanboy of yours as well. So it's neat to see that as an example.
00:37:54.970 - 00:38:39.150, Speaker C: Yeah, I hope actually that this model or what we certainly did then, is that all those projects or they spun out of Gnosis, they often create their own tokens, although Circuits has no circles is again the exception here, but the others create their own tokens. And I think it's a super important model then to model. I very much like and would like to see even much more is than those shared incentives. And it's actually very. Easy with tokens. You can do those token swaps and you can do bonding curves of tokens against each other. I would actually like to see this even much, much more happening in the industry.
00:38:39.150 - 00:39:00.230, Speaker C: So many projects are kind of dependent on each other. We are building this super composable ecosystem, and I think it's always good to do that as much as possible, to have shared incentives.
00:39:00.650 - 00:39:18.270, Speaker A: Well, I think that your hit rate is really cool. I hope to not be a one hit wonder and not just be known as the gitcoin guy for the rest of my career. And I hope to have multiple hits as well. So it's been inspirational, what you've been doing. Is there anything that I didn't ask you that you want to say? Martin.
00:39:20.370 - 00:39:23.250, Speaker C: No, I think covered it.
00:39:23.320 - 00:39:29.300, Speaker A: Okay, well, maybe a place to end is where can people find you and circles online.
00:39:30.790 - 00:39:49.320, Speaker C: Yeah. So the website is jointcircles. Jointcircles net, of course. Also on Twitter. Yeah, I'm most quite active on Twitter. Kappleman. K-O-E-W-P-E-L-M-A-N.
00:39:49.320 - 00:39:51.642, Speaker C: Great.
00:39:51.776 - 00:39:57.798, Speaker A: Well, we'll have links in the show notes for everyone to click on those. And thanks for coming on the Greenfield pod to talk about circles.
00:39:57.814 - 00:40:06.480, Speaker C: Martin yeah, thanks so much for having me. And thanks for all your work in this field.
00:40:09.250 - 00:40:13.530, Speaker A: Yeah. Really excited about the regen future that we're all building together. All right, peace.
