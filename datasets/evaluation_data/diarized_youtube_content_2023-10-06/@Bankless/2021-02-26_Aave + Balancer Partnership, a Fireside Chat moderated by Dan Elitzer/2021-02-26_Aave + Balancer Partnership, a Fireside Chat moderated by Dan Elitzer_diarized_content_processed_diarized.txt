00:00:00.250 - 00:00:16.878, Speaker A: Fireside chat that we are officially hosting. We are super excited about this live event. We're broadcasting it live on YouTube. It's also going to come on the premium edition of the podcast sometime next week. David, what are we up to today?
00:00:17.044 - 00:00:52.374, Speaker B: Yeah, we are up to talking about the partnership between Ave and Balancer. So there is a pretty unique opportunity here to make capital more efficient in Defi. This is a constant theme as Defi matures. As these teams collaborate and talk to each other, they find ways to make things better. And I think one of the reasons why I'm really stoked on this partnership is because Dan Elliser is really stoked on this partnership. And when Dan Elliser is stoked on something, I pay attention. And so this is what's so unique about what we're doing here today is we are actually handing over the keys to the kingdom to Dan.
00:00:52.374 - 00:01:06.158, Speaker B: So Dan Elitzer is actually going to moderate the conversation between Stani, the founder of Ave, and Fernando, the CEO founder of Balancer. So going to be a pretty unique piece of content coming out of the bankless YouTube. And it's great because you and I don't have to do anything.
00:01:06.324 - 00:01:34.250, Speaker A: Yeah, we to. We're going to come in after the show and add some commentary. And hopefully you guys, if you're watching on YouTube, add your questions throughout because we will be monitoring those questions and bring them after the panel to the surface for sort of a community. Ask me anything where we'll do a debrief. So that's important too. Make sure you get your questions in. David, Dan Ellipser wrote that legendary piece, superfluid collateral back in 2019.
00:01:34.250 - 00:02:05.122, Speaker A: I think something like that. It seems like a decade ago, but it was really the first post that kind of predicted exactly what we're talking about here today. Because what we're talking about is actually using a money Lego, a balancer liquidity pool in Aave as a piece of superfluid collateral to receive additional interest on. So what he predicted is coming to fruition and now doing a panel on it. So that is super cool. David, anything else regarding logistics? Did I miss anything?
00:02:05.256 - 00:02:40.638, Speaker B: Yeah, no, not at all. We're going to hop off here real quick, then we're going to hand it over to Stani, Fernando and Dan for about 30 to 45 minutes of a conversation. Then when that wraps up, we will turn to the community AMA, which will go for another 30 minutes. So if you found this link on periscope but you want to ask questions, go to the YouTube, because that's where I am fielding questions. We're also fielding questions out of the bankless discord for the bankless premium members. And then, of course, if you are on YouTube, like and subscribe, because this is how we get good content up to the front page of YouTube where it belongs. So please go ahead and do that for us.
00:02:40.804 - 00:02:51.746, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. All right, before we get to the panel and the fireside chat conversation with Dan Elitzer, Fernando and Stani, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:02:51.928 - 00:03:33.230, Speaker B: Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens, and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you.
00:03:33.230 - 00:04:26.350, Speaker B: Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset. When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH, so whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of ETh bonus back to me. At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com. GoBankless Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, Legos, yield and composability all in one application.
00:04:26.350 - 00:05:15.540, Speaker B: On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's V two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on Uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them. Check out the power of Ave@ave.com. That's aave.com.
00:05:22.180 - 00:05:51.464, Speaker C: Hey all, thanks for having us. David Ryan, thank you so much for inviting us on to talk today. It's really exciting for me to be here and be with these two fantastic guests. I'm actually a big user via my fund, nascent of both Aave and balancer. We've got exposure to both those tokens. So full disclosure up front there, but we're also very heavy users of both protocols because we really think they bring a lot to the table. So I'm very excited to get into this partnership today.
00:05:51.464 - 00:06:10.560, Speaker C: But before we do that, let's lay a little bit of groundwork. So first, Stannie, I know that Ave, towards the end of last year, did a big v two launch of your protocol. Can you just, in maybe about a minute, give us some of the highlights of new capabilities that were introduced in V two and what the overall goal was of that overhaul?
00:06:11.940 - 00:07:10.116, Speaker D: Yeah, thanks for introduction, Dan. And the V two was launched, I think was like we were in Mainnet in December. And one of the things that we tried to improve is we just optimized the architecture so we had more gas savings there, but we optimized the protocol so that we can create more pools. Currently, as Ave is a protocol, we have a main market, but the idea is that the protocol is capable of creating multiple markets. So let's say that if you want to use something like balancer, liquidity, provider shares as collateral, and other kind of collaterals to pull liquidity, the protocol is more scalable in that sense. And also we can list into the main market quite substantial amount of assets without creating unnecessary gas. But end of the day, we also wanted to improve the user experience.
00:07:10.116 - 00:08:03.030, Speaker D: So one of the issues that the ave users had is that when you borrow something against your collateral, in most cases you want to return your loan. At some point you want to repay your debt, but if you spend that loan somewhere else already, it's very difficult to close that loan position. So we introduced so called collateral swap functionality, where you can actually, with this functionality, you could close your loan position, so you could repay your loan with your collateral, which is super cool, but also you could swap your collateral. So let's say now that, for example, you might have eat position, and pal is now, for example, listed as token, and you want to swap part of the position into Pal. You can actually do that now without repaying your loan. So kind of like user experience things, which are a way to just make the product better. That was our complete focus.
00:08:03.640 - 00:08:23.790, Speaker C: Fantastic. And Fernando, I understand that recently you've announced Balancer V two. This is, I guess, the proposal from the balancer Labs team, and the community as a whole has to approve it and push this forward. But can you please tell us what are some of the big changes that you're planning on for this v two?
00:08:25.040 - 00:09:08.232, Speaker E: Sure. So what we did mainly was also change the architecture to have more efficient ways that you interact with the protocol. This has been done by separating the logic from pools, from the accounting and custody of the tokens. So in balancer V one today, each pool is its own smart contract. So the pools are siloed and completely separate from each other. They hold the tokens, and also the logic that kind of rules the amm, how they sell and buy tokens. And now we have a vault that holds the assets of all the pools in balancer two.
00:09:08.232 - 00:10:04.664, Speaker E: But each pool is free to have any logic, arbitrary logic that they want. So you can create a different amm style and plug that into a balancer, and the vault will hold the assets while the pools will hold or manage the logic. Why is this so useful? Because imagine, like, if you wanted to do a multi hop trade or you wanted to do a trade in a pair, that there is a lot of liquidity in different pools today. You would have to send, let's say, a for b. You would have to send a to all three pools, and then get b from all the three pools that you're interacting with, as opposed to if they are all, like, all the tokens are held by one vault. You just need to send a to the vault, and then the vault communicates with the pools to understand what price they offer. And then the vault gives b back to the user who's doing this trade.
00:10:04.664 - 00:10:56.044, Speaker E: And this also allows us to do something really cool, which is what we call internal balances. So imagine, like, many arbors out there and people who do lots of trading every day, retail users or smart contracts, it's kind of silly if you stop to think about it, to send token a and then get token b back, if they know they're going to be selling b for a, and then they have to send the b back to get a. So what balancer V two allows is for you to have some credit within the vault. So you can just deposit a and b, and then you sell a for b, and then that only changes your internal balance within the vault. But it doesn't involve any year C 20 transactions, so there's no external contract calls. It's a lot cheaper. So the numbers we're playing around today, for a normal transaction, a normal swap, we are getting things around 100k.
00:10:56.044 - 00:11:45.624, Speaker E: Probably going to maybe go down or up a bit from that. And for transactions that use the internal bounce, we're getting sub 70k swaps. And the nice thing is that if you trade a for b and then b for c, so you're doing a multi hop, it only adds marginally more gas because you're interacting with the same contract. It's the same vault, it's just adding more calls to vaults. But all the logic is done in the same vault. So we're pretty excited about that. And that allows projects to build on top of balancer, so they can build whatever amm logic they want and kind of take advantage of this infrastructure, which is the vault and all the other stuff around balancer, like the Sor and bow liquidity mining and so on and so forth.
00:11:45.624 - 00:11:49.836, Speaker E: So maybe that's an overview about balancer v two. Yeah.
00:11:49.858 - 00:13:03.990, Speaker C: And so it sounds like in both cases, the goals of these v two s, of your protocols have been about really refining the architecture and making it so that it can do a lot more volume, be a lot more efficient, offer better ux through these new capabilities that you're introducing. And the piece that you mentioned, Fernando, that I think we're here to talk about today, is really that vault piece, right? The idea that rather than having ETH be part of all these different pools, and sitting across the different pools, all of that ETH, or all of that USDC from all these different pools, all end up in a single vault. And that creates opportunity, because while you may have a lot of depth in a lot of these pools, people aren't using probably 80% of the depth. It's only that 20% that's in use most of the time. And when you aggregate it across all these pools, that's probably even more, you know. Can you talk to me about what you're going to be doing with the fact that you have all these assets collected in a single vault and how ave then plays into this?
00:13:04.840 - 00:13:51.616, Speaker E: Sure, maybe I kind of saved the best for this answer about p two that I haven't mentioned. So it's a known fact that amms don't use most of the liquidity because unless the prices are moving in one direction, like what you get is kind of, the balance is just fluctuating back and forth as people trade. Of course, if something gets more expensive, then that balance goes down. So let's say you have a pool with ETH and die and ETH gets more expensive, you're going to have less and less ETH in that pool. So actually eating up some of that balance. So what we have in balancer v two is the concept of asset managers. So a pool deposits assets into balancer and mints bpts balancer, pool tokens.
00:13:51.616 - 00:15:04.584, Speaker E: It's like a share LP shares, but the pool should have full control of what the pool wants to do with the assets that it deposited to the protocol. It doesn't belong to balancer, it belongs to the pools. And of course, the pools represent the lps that trusted those pools with their assets. If the pool decides to say, well, I know that most of the time, as you said, then just like the 20% top of my balances are being used to facilitate or enable trades, why don't I just use 80% of those balances, of the two tokens and put them on ave, for example? Because I know that I could be earning, I don't know, depending on the token, 520, 30% yearly on top of the swap fees that the bouncer pool is also generating. The nice thing is that we made it so that each pool can decide on its own whether they want to do that or not. Because there's always additional smart contract risk, right? Even if it's a protocol that's been battle tested and has billions, like Aave, people might feel scared, like, oh, my assets are not actually where I'm depositing them. So it's all opt in.
00:15:04.584 - 00:15:57.276, Speaker E: So you can have a pool that does that, and you can have pools that just hold all the assets, have less API, but don't have that extra kind of complexity and smart contract risk. And you can have different types of implementations, so you can have an asset manager. And just to recap here, so what we're talking about today is this partnership between Avi and Balancer, where we know that most of the assets in balancer pools are not being utilized, just some of it, to allow for trades to happen. So what we're talking about is those pools will put those assets in Aave. And it's very simple. Actually, the concept is very simple. The tricky part is that we need to manage those assets, because, as I said, if you have an ETH dai pool, and Dai is getting more expensive, or ETH is getting more expensive, then the balance will go down.
00:15:57.276 - 00:16:32.936, Speaker E: And if that buffer, which is actually in the vault, goes to zero, then people cannot trade anymore, because the vault, it cannot kind of count on tokens that are not inside itself. So even though we trust this, like, the vault should not trust anything that's outside of itself. So if the tokens are not there, it cannot allow the swap. So if the buffer of a pool went to zero, that swap is going to fail. So the asset manager then needs to go to av and say, I need some of my ETH back, and put it back into the pool to allow for trades to happen again. Does that make sense?
00:16:33.038 - 00:17:12.790, Speaker C: Yeah. So what you're saying here is basically, there's a need to kind of manage that balance there, and then a need to actually earn yield on the part that is not being reserved right in this moment. So it sounds like this is great for lps and balancer, at least the ones who opt into this and are willing to take some additional smart contract risk, potential economic risk, right around this, but they get better yield on the assets they've got deposited into balancer pools. Stani, what's the advantage to ave for working with balancer on this? What does it add to your protocol in your community?
00:17:14.440 - 00:18:34.460, Speaker D: Yeah, actually, that was a very good explanation from Fernando on how the asset manager allocates the capital. And I think there's plenty of synergies there. I think how the system is built where the asset manager can themselves. To decide to have this kind of feature is fundamental because we have this narrative of, let's say, capital efficiency and governance, and protocols deciding upon how to reallocate funds between other protocols where the yield is. And one of the kind of, like my concerns always is that what if the end user doesn't want to subscribe to that risk or liquidity provider, and this asset manager actually does it in a way where the liquidity provider subscribe to that kind of asset manager functionality? That's pretty great in terms of the synergies. I think with balancer solves with the asset manager in the other protocol, is that we get more liquidity. And that's the key point here, especially when it comes to stablecoin liquidity at the current moment, a lot of stablecoin liquidity is sitting in Amm pools and for example, in balancer.
00:18:34.460 - 00:19:46.928, Speaker D: And that means that when that liquidity is sitting, there isn't for borrowing. And one of the approaches we have done before is that we look at the kind of liquidity provider shares and collateralizing them and then creating the loan market, but that creates even more demand. So it's a solution where the stable coins become even more sparse. And with the asset manager functionality, what happens is that you unlock those stable coins and all of the other assets as well, from the pools that have the sager into the other protocol, which means that there is more liquidity to borrow and there's more yield to the depositors, and the asset managers are also the depositors. So it's kind of like solving a lot of liquidity crunch that we have at the moment. And I think what's unique here in this solution is it actually creates layers where the capital is really efficient. Because when you look at the normal model, how we have function and DeFi is trying to achieve, they are taking liquidity provider shares and putting them as pedal.
00:19:46.928 - 00:20:36.276, Speaker D: That creates just more scarcity for the stable coins. So I think a solution wise, it's very interesting. And for the developers, I think they will love the feature and the fact that on balance, reversion two, you can build different kinds of interesting things and use this asset manager feature. But also in the future, maybe there could be other things that asset managers could do. For example, they could credit delegate between other asset managers and kind of like increase the liquidity within balancer and also the yields on those assets. So I think this is probably one of the best things happening since Defi. And this is only possible because there is this kind of like a community relationship between balancer and the ave community.
00:20:36.276 - 00:21:06.590, Speaker D: And of course, there is always this kind of additional smart contract risk that is coming on. And in this case, I think the relationship and the ave as a protocol has been proving quite well in those benchmarks. And for me, this is the best thing happening now. I think Danny wrote about this in 2019, the first time, and seeing it now live coming, it's just amazing.
00:21:07.040 - 00:22:01.756, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I was a little overly optimistic at the speed at which some of this stuff would happen, but it's now happening at a scale beyond what I would have ever predicted. Two years. Want to. I do want to talk about the community piece and how the communities really fit together. But before we get there, there was a piece, Downey, that you mentioned that I hadn't really explicitly thought about in the context of this partnership. It makes a ton of sense when I think about my own activities doing yield farming, which is that when you start using bpts, the balancer pool tokens, or other kind of liquidity pool shares as collateral in Aave, the folks who are doing that generally want to borrow stable coins against them. That's what the real demand is, and they're generally not borrowing other assets.
00:22:01.756 - 00:23:02.950, Speaker C: When I've got assets there, I'm not looking to borrow sometimes I'm looking to borrow eth, but I'm generally not looking to borrow a lot of the different tokens that are available on Aave, I'm usually looking to borrow stables. And so that's great. As you bring in more pool shares that can be used as collateral, I'll borrow more stables. That pushes up the price to borrow stables. But where are more stables coming in? And this is where this partnership comes in, is that the most common assets besides eth to pair with are stablecoins, currently primarily USDC DAI, USDT are probably, I would guess the top three there. And this should open up probably at least tens of millions of dollars of additional capacity to be lent out on Ave as a result. Is that ballpark what you think we're looking at here?
00:23:04.520 - 00:24:26.912, Speaker D: Yeah, I think so. I mean, the potential could be, I haven't calculated the whole amount of liquidity that there could be, but I think eventually quite a lot in stablecoins, and stablecoins, is that what the other protocol needs? And I think maybe this is a good example for defi ecosystem, like how you could actually think of the capital efficiency in a different perspective. So I definitely agree that this is going to help a lot on bringing those borrowing costs in. I don't know, am I more interested in the actual solution or the fact that what could you build as a developer on top of this functionality in later stage. But it's quite substantially significant change. And I think it sets a different kind of a narrative as well in the Defi ecosystem, because here it's like two protocols and trusting each other and the same way. For example, what's fascinating about the other balancer relationship is that we have reached out together, we have reached out balancer community, and they've been to contact us and we have agreed to do something big, and we have usually achieved it.
00:24:26.912 - 00:24:49.510, Speaker D: So we created this part of the arbinomics, when you stake to the safety module to backstop the protocol from any kind of events. So one of the ways to backstop is that you have the special balancer pool, where you have 80% of ave and 20% of each.
00:24:51.740 - 00:24:52.116, Speaker C: Pool.
00:24:52.148 - 00:25:51.720, Speaker D: So you stake those pool tokens into the safety module, and you get the fees from balancer, the Val token, and also ave for the safety module. We were planning that maybe this could be actually, if it's done right with the Avenomics and so forth and safety module staking, it could be the biggest pool in balancer, and it's happened now it's the biggest pool there, and that's super efficient in that sense. And it's only possible because our community trusts the balancer community in terms of, because the funds are there in the balancer or balancer smart contracts. And in the same way, balancer is trusting in terms of security here. So it's kind of like something that requires a lot of work and time. And I think this shows very good message. Once the teams achieve certain security level, in terms of building safe and secure infrastructure, then these kind of partnerships are possible to do in a scale.
00:25:51.720 - 00:25:59.180, Speaker D: Otherwise you could not scale into hundreds of millions. What we have with the safety module staking with Balancer.
00:26:01.840 - 00:26:17.570, Speaker C: That'S a great point. This is not the first significant partnership that these two protocols have had. So are there other things that you're thinking about? What are some possibilities for things that these two protocols could do together going forward?
00:26:20.260 - 00:26:21.970, Speaker E: I have a lot of things.
00:26:24.600 - 00:26:27.110, Speaker C: I was a terrible host there. Fernando, why don't you answer?
00:26:29.720 - 00:27:37.720, Speaker E: Think. I think I'd agree with Stani that the most exciting thing is not what we know we built and we know we can build, but the things that the crazy developers out there will come up with because of composability and the way those things are like legos, and people come up with ideas that we haven't expected. But I think some obvious next steps would be to have a better kind of coverage of BPTs as money. So if Ave understands how balancer works, and the smart contracts kind of can talk to each other, you can always withdraw liquidity. There's no wait period or cool down period. So if ave needs to slash someone or to use that collateral, it can always go to balancer, withdraw the underlying tokens, and then use the eth that's in that eth, let's say ave pool. So in a way, a BPT is just a passport to the underlying tokens.
00:27:37.720 - 00:28:03.460, Speaker E: It's easier said than done. There's some complexity of how to price the BPT, but it's kind of doable, and we're here to solve those nice challenges. I think the credit delegation for asset managers is an amazing idea. I've already thought about that and we discuss some of the kind of cool things we can build with that. But yeah, we're just getting started. Sorry, Sunny.
00:28:05.240 - 00:29:32.512, Speaker D: Just to add on that, one of the markets we're now working is that we have the balance report tokens as a collateral and you can borrow liquidity against. And what's interesting here is that even though it's like ave market and build on Ave, what we're going to do is that the file token holders have also voting power. Because the way that the Ave version two governance that we released end of last year works is that we can create different kinds of voting strategies. And for example, if you create a new pool, we can add their other tokens to be also used to vote. It gives power to the balancer community and because they know the assets as well, they know how their system works. And it's kind of like an inclusive way to get communities together and govern things together. And I think this is quite new because usually there is a lot of partnerships in Defi and working together, but if you look at all of those partnerships, there isn't that kind of like much of inclusivity to this level where actually we govern something that involves both of those stakeholders and combine the expertise in understanding and community culture there.
00:29:32.512 - 00:29:37.436, Speaker D: And I think that's going to be interesting to see how it will evolve.
00:29:37.548 - 00:29:38.764, Speaker C: I think that's super exciting.
00:29:38.812 - 00:29:39.132, Speaker D: Right?
00:29:39.206 - 00:30:12.652, Speaker C: I feel like so many of the partnerships, not just between these protocols, but other protocols in the space, have largely been kind of developer driven, behind the scenes, working together on something. And what you're talking about here is, as far as I'm aware, the first case where we're talking about two very significant protocols actually sharing governance via the token holders over a meaningful amount of assets and kind of economics and how that's going to be mean. That's tremendously exciting to me.
00:30:12.786 - 00:30:13.470, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:14.400 - 00:30:48.004, Speaker C: So we're going to talk with Fabian and the snapshot folks about what this is going to look like to integrate that on snapshot and have the dual voting and stuff. That'll be a lot of. So before we kind of open it up and bring David and Ryan back in, there's one last topic that I wanted to hit on to make sure we kind of set the stage. Top of mind for everybody right now is kind of congestion on Ethereum, right? It's too crowded, nobody goes there anymore.
00:30:48.052 - 00:30:48.650, Speaker E: Right.
00:30:50.700 - 00:31:51.790, Speaker C: It's really great to see so much activity happening on Ethereum, but gas fee is just out of control. And so we're seeing a lot of teams racing towards really large scale L2 deployments. We're seeing a lot of other layer one smart contract platforms gaining an interest. At least their token prices are going up and they're getting talked about more. But when you guys think about where this is all heading with increased composability, when we start going from millions of users to tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions of users, we're going to need some way to scale. And it seems unlikely to me that this is all l one Ethereum people paying hundreds of dollars per transaction. So what do you see as the paths that you're exploring, the futures that you're exploring for your protocols to be able to scale and still maintain the avenue for composability that is really being highlighted here in the partnerships you've had so far.
00:31:51.790 - 00:31:55.250, Speaker C: So Stannie, maybe you want to take up for a scrack at that.
00:31:56.180 - 00:33:04.084, Speaker D: Yeah, I saw like a week ago like 1200 way transaction that went through the normal rate. So I definitely agree that there is quite a lot of congestion. Especially one of the things I think what will cause even more is that nfts are becoming popular and people are bidding on those kind of reminds the congestion that icos brought back in the days. But I think it's important to have this strategy, lto strategy or scalability strategy that is as inclusive as possible and supports various communities. For example, we try to look into communities where something is already happening, whether it's a bit of defi or something related to nfts and support that. And one of our community projects, Avegochi, is actually doing something automatic and they ported. Actually we wanted to ported a tokens for them because they need them obviously for their game.
00:33:04.084 - 00:33:50.820, Speaker D: But they said that well we are faster so we will do it ourselves. So this is an example, scaling without actually doing much of community driven scaling. But I think many of the scaling solutions we need to always think about the security side. So it's super amazing to have cheap transactions in the L2 or side chains. But we also need to understand that we're reducing the security unless we're using something which is medical proofs like ZK. And that is something that we are also kind of looking into quite a lot at this moment. So our strategy is being everywhere, but also we are trying to find a long term solution.
00:33:52.360 - 00:33:56.020, Speaker C: Fernando, how about you? How do you see scaling for balancer?
00:33:57.320 - 00:35:09.084, Speaker E: That's a great question. So we are not aiming to be the pioneers of scaling and we don't want to set the path for auto protocols in terms of what solution they should choose. Of course, we don't have this power, far from that. But we are also not only just sitting and waiting because this is blowing up in front of our noses, but on the other hand, we still believe that the fact that we need a lot of composability for Defi to be as great as we know it today on Ethereum layer one, there are so many tools, so many kind of things that need to work nicely together that we take for granted today. But if you look at Ethereum in 2016, it's probably how layers two and other layer ones look like today, what they look like today. So it's very easy to sell solutions that they say you can just plug in your solidity code and it's EVM compatible, it works great. But in practice we know it's not that simple.
00:35:09.084 - 00:36:20.868, Speaker E: So we are also more like leaning towards ZK rollups because it's a mathematical, kind of cryptographic proof. And there's not an economic game where people could just decide, well, it makes sense to steal money from people here because there's more that I can win by stealing money. There's also not this long period to withdraw your assets, which for NFTs, not so much for us, but we want to be in the space where everyone is. So I've talked to some NFT kind of teams that think that this is a no go, a deal breaker, because you cannot have this fungibility between L2 and layer one. Not saying that optimism isn't a cool approach, I think it's an awesome way to solve this. But I think long term it will probably be something around ZK roll ups, and that's more what we're leaning towards. But again, I think we're just, like Sunny said, we're experimenting with different things, but we haven't committed to one solution yet.
00:36:20.868 - 00:36:40.170, Speaker E: And I think maybe the industry that Defi and protocols as a whole, they need to talk more and decide where they're going to go together if they want to keep collaborating and being composable like we are today. So, yeah, it's going to be interesting to see how it pans out this year.
00:36:40.780 - 00:37:37.270, Speaker C: Yeah. As a big optimism fan and backer, I'll say I do think that there's more to the optimistic roll ups than we're hearing here. But I also do hear that the mathematical guarantees of ZK roll ups are very compelling. And what I thought was interesting is that you both were looking in that direction and reading between the lines. And what you were both saying, it sounded more like you're looking towards L2 solutions on Ethereum, and the idea that there's going to be potentially, at some point, once everyone kind of coalesces around something, that there will be a bit of a migration, not that you anticipate having versions of Ave and balancer existing across ten different layer ones. That's not the likely future that you're looking towards. Is that fair to say, Stannie?
00:37:38.170 - 00:38:41.046, Speaker D: Well, I don't know. Is it completely fair? Because most cases, yes, but maybe if there is something interesting going somewhere, something that is very rich in its culture and community, we probably want to be there as well. We try to just empower more. So for us, it's not only about decentralized finance, but after you solve finance, you can solve other cool things and empower those communities. But as a long term solution, we want to find something that could be very scalable for us. I think roll ups is definitely some option that we are looking into. ZK is interesting because if you have used mathematics instead of form, that's something that is very unique, because we solve now sort of things with mathematics at the moment in cryptography.
00:38:41.046 - 00:38:53.070, Speaker D: So that's of course, like the holy grail. It's just very difficult still to replace something like ave protocol into those kind of places.
00:38:54.530 - 00:39:27.430, Speaker E: Fernando, to answer your question. Yeah. On our side then, I think we're not trying to dictate what the markets want. I think, like you like, there could be a set of users for which it makes a lot of sense to be on another layer one, because their capital requirements are not so big, and they know they're going to be dealing with $200 checks, and it doesn't make sense at all for them to be on Ethereum. And there's no L2 solution today. So what we're trying to do is not close our minds. We're not maximalists.
00:39:27.430 - 00:40:46.994, Speaker E: No other layer ones are worth trying. So we're actually talking to a bunch of them, but we're always telling them that we unfortunately are fully focused on delivering v two for ethereum and layer one. So we want to launch balancer here. And of course we're open to answering questions and helping other teams build balancer on auto layer ones. So it's more like an approach of let's see what the market says. So if someone ports balancer to an auto layer one, and we're seeing some layer ones implementing balancer already, and if it catches on and has traction, then it will naturally start calling more our attention and catching more attention. And then we're going to have to deal with questions like, do we want to use one Token, one single token for the governance of balancer everywhere? Or do we want to have different versions of Bao tokens that are native to other layer ones? Are there bridges between bow that is kind of canonically minted on ethereum and then goes to those other protocols? Do we have liquidity mining on those other protocols? All of this, we're not trying to kind of set the tone and decide what to do.
00:40:46.994 - 00:40:59.560, Speaker E: It's more like the community, the market, those are the stakeholders that should decide. And we're just kind of trying to stay focused on the launch of v two and open to going to other layer ones.
00:41:00.010 - 00:41:30.250, Speaker C: It sounds like, as it makes clear in both your answers, there are a lot of factors at play here, a lot of considerations, and this isn't something that anyone's going to be able to dictate top down. It's going to be an exploratory process both within the communities for these various projects and across the communities of the various projects. So awesome. Thank you guys so much. Let's have David and Ryan, if you guys want to jump back in. I think it would be fantastic to start hearing some of the questions that are coming in from across the interwebs.
00:41:30.410 - 00:41:51.174, Speaker B: Yeah, Dan, fantastic job as a moderator. If you are interested in being a bankless co host, perhaps we can talk. This is really great, guys. I learned a ton. I have my own questions lined up ready to go, so we're going straight to the Q A. All right, so guys, I have my questions ready to go. And again, it is the time to put the questions in the chat, but I want to start with my questions first.
00:41:51.174 - 00:42:48.460, Speaker B: So my first question is, I just want to be clear about the process behind the asset management system. And so the question I have is that the concept is that we only need the surface level of the liquidity tokens in an amm to facilitate any sort of trade. Right. All of the tokens. So if I'm trading eth to die, right, and I'm trading 100 eth to die, I only need 100 die and 100 die worth of ETH to make that trade happen. And so the rest of those tokens get put into Ave. But each asset and asset pair or asset group on a balancer or assets in general have their own volatility characteristics, right? And so the ETH DAI management might not be the same as the Ave ETH management system.
00:42:48.460 - 00:42:55.690, Speaker B: What's the plan for the long term accounting for the different characteristics of assets in their just market dynamics.
00:42:56.910 - 00:43:27.682, Speaker E: Absolutely. That's an optimization problem, David, that has, like, we were working on it with our friends at Alex Evans. Like, the idea is that the more volatile a pair is, because a token on its own is never volatile. Right. It's always relative to something else. So you have to talk about volatility in a pair. If you're talking about ETH and die, we know that it's a volatile pair, so we want to have more buffer in a pair that is highly correlated.
00:43:27.682 - 00:43:59.786, Speaker E: Right. So we know that in a day, you might need 40% of the initial balance that you started off in the day. So in order to not have to do many, what we call replenishments. So what a replenishment is, is when your buffer, which is in a vault, starts going close to zero, you need to grab your assets back from Ave and put them into the vault imbalancer. Every time you do that, you have to pay for someone to trigger this transaction. Right. An interesting thing is that it's one person who's paying for all the pools.
00:43:59.786 - 00:44:26.934, Speaker E: So if the pool has $100 million, it's one keeper that's paying to replenish the pool. It's paying, I don't know, 100, $200 to do that. But that's split. It's kind of shared. It's a cost shared by everyone in the pool. It's only done once every hour or so. And if we know that transactions are very expensive, what we can do is we can have bigger buffers so that we don't need to do replenishments like that often.
00:44:26.934 - 00:44:49.680, Speaker E: But then you give up on the APY because you're actually lending less of your assets to Aave. So it's really a trade off. If you have a lot of volatility and let's say low APIs on Ave, you might want to have bigger buffers. If you have low volatility and a lot of API on Ave, you want to have a very low buffer because you want to have almost everything lent out.
00:44:51.670 - 00:45:43.840, Speaker C: It's my understanding, running this, though, that it's not about necessarily within the individual pool. You think about it at the overall asset level. So, for example, bal eth is relatively more correlated than Baldi or ETH die. Right? So then if you say have the majority of the ETH liquidity is in the eth bow pair, and a minority in ETH dai, you can say the overall ETH pool can have less of a buffer. Whereas if it were the reverse, if the majority of the liquidity were in the ETH dive pool, and a minority of the ETH liquidity were in the eth bow pool. You'd probably need a bigger buffer on that eth vault. Right.
00:45:45.970 - 00:45:53.110, Speaker E: If I understood it correctly. So this is something at the pool level. So it's not at the vault level.
00:45:53.180 - 00:45:57.894, Speaker C: Okay. So you need to figure out the safety margin at the pool level rather than the overall volume. Okay.
00:45:58.012 - 00:46:30.970, Speaker E: Because one pool cannot use the buffer from another pool to sell because the asset manager might be malicious, and they just steal all. Like, they invest all the assets that they have, and then. Oh, but, yeah, let's use some buffer from another pool. And then that asset manager never shows up again. It just stole all everyone's money, of course. And that's why this partnership is so important. We're going to put lots of money to audit this asset manager and good people working from both sides on this problem, but we're fully permissionless.
00:46:30.970 - 00:47:09.360, Speaker E: So anyone can create any type of balancer pools on v two, any logic, they can create any asset managers they want. But once you trusted an asset manager with managing your assets in the pool, then it can do anything, of course, that the code permits, but it's at the pool level. So if the pool decides to lend more, then the pool might run out of buffer, and then that pool won't trade the spare. So the SOR smart auto router bouncer will look at that pool, we'll see that the buffer is too small, and then we'll just route the trades to other pools that have enough buffer. Does that make sense?
00:47:10.050 - 00:47:10.750, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:47:10.900 - 00:47:49.100, Speaker E: And just to complement, as you said, you just need the surface of the assets. Why? Because people are not trading 5% of the pool's asset, because that has a lot of slippage. Right. So anyone wanting to do big trades on amms, they will split up their trades into smaller chunks. So they trade a little bit and then let arbors bring the price back, and then they trade a little bit. So instead of trading all at once and having, like, 5% slippage. So that's why we know that amms don't need to have all the liquidity kind of ready to be used.
00:47:50.990 - 00:48:12.850, Speaker B: Awesome. And my next follow up question, I want to just clarify, might actually be the same question asked in a different way. And so we're going to approach this from two angles. And so, in the announcement post, you guys say that idle funds can go into Aave, right? And earn yields. How do you define idle funds? And is this just the same question in going from a different direction.
00:48:13.750 - 00:48:53.118, Speaker E: That's a great auto way to frame it. Imagine the way I define idle funds is if those funds weren't there in bowser, everything would have happened the same way. So they didn't really matter at all in this period of time. So we have a nice gif that animates that. So imagine have like 100% balance, balance on the two tokens, and then you trade back and forth. If or die, the price has kind of stayed the same. So it's some people buying, some people selling, and then if you look across the whole day of trades, the balances never cross this line here.
00:48:53.118 - 00:49:36.090, Speaker E: So all of those balances below the line where the surface has kind of gone up and down, all those assets could have been elsewhere earning some extra yield. Of course that changes because amms work in a way that if something gets more expensive, its balance goes down. So as that balance goes down, you're going to hit the end of the buffer, and then you need to replenish your pool, and conversely, the other side is going up. So you actually can lend more to ave because you're kind of missing out on more apy that you could have because you have more of that asset.
00:49:38.430 - 00:50:21.642, Speaker A: So, Fernando, I'm going to ask a question that came in from YouTube, and I think this is more directed probably at the balancer side. So it's probably a Fernando type question. But as you guys have articulated throughout this conversation, this is very much a play for more liquidity. Obviously, Balancer wants more liquidity. What does Ave get out of this partnership equation is more liquidity, specifically liquidity on stablecoins. We love liquidity. So do our money robots, right? Can you give kind of an elevator pitch, I suppose, to a liquidity provider for why Balancer versus somewhere else that they could put their liquidity, another amm or a centralized exchange somewhere else.
00:50:21.642 - 00:50:23.370, Speaker A: Why balancer?
00:50:24.830 - 00:50:56.610, Speaker E: So to my knowledge, I haven't seen any other amm that allows for that. So if you want to have your underlying assets of your pool earning some expert yield, you would have to go with us. Of course, you can wrap your tokens, let's say you can have like Adai and AUSC, and put those in a pool. Then actually you have 100% of the assets that are being lent out. What is the problem? People don't want to trade a die for a USDC. They want to trade die for USCC. They don't want to trade CDI for C USDC.
00:50:56.610 - 00:51:37.906, Speaker E: So what actually, curve has a great solution, a great pool there, which is for example, the Y pool, they have YdAi and YUSDC, but people want to trade dai for USDC. So what they do is if they want to trade IOC for die, they wrap USDC into YOCC, then they trade YSDC for y die, and then they unwrap the y die to die and give back to the user. And that costs 800k gas. It's as if we're replenishing the pool. So it's the equivalent to having zero buffer on both sides. Someone wants to trade, you replenish the pool with exactly the amount the user wants to trade and then you do the trade and then you kind of invest the other side back. It's exactly the same.
00:51:37.906 - 00:52:41.270, Speaker E: But imagine this for every swap, right? So what we're doing here is instead of having 50,000 replenishments, which is like 50,000 swaps every day, we're bringing it down to ten, because we know that trades are going back and forth, back and forth, and what we're giving return or kind of missing out the trade off here is instead of having 100% of the assets lent out, we have 85 or 90%, but we brought down all the gas costs of wrapping and wrapping 50,000 times per day, down to ten transactions. So this, of course, who pays in the end? Who's paying for those 50,000 wrap, unwrap 800k gas for every swap transaction. It's the lps, right. Because there's going to be less trades. It costs a lot of money to do a trade, so people won't trade there. So in essence, what we're doing is we're making the pool a lot more efficient, so that there's a lot more trades, there's a lot more swap fees generated. So the lps have a much better outcome.
00:52:41.270 - 00:52:48.966, Speaker E: I'm talking out of theory, because this is not implemented yet, but it's kind of a quite obvious outcome, in my opinion.
00:52:49.158 - 00:53:42.810, Speaker A: Higher yield, more capital efficiency seems to be kind of the bottom line pitch here. I'm going to ask another question. This one came in through the bankless discord, and this is somewhat related, but so I heard, actually, the folks over at bitwise say that from an institutional perspective, institutions are actually understanding Defi capital assets. Those make more sense to them than things like bitcoin in some respects, because these are capital assets and they're used to assessing discounted cash flows. So that's very interesting. But the question that's coming in from discord is this, what's it going to take to convince a traditional hedge fund traditional capital pool to start putting their capital, deploying their capital in something like balancer or aave. And maybe I'll start with stani on this question.
00:53:42.810 - 00:53:55.840, Speaker A: Are you seeing any sort of institutional adoption? Maybe. It's hard to tell because all of these ETH addresses are pseudo anonymous. But do you get hints that some of this capital is coming from institutions? And if not, what do you think that's going to take?
00:53:57.010 - 00:54:52.962, Speaker D: Yeah, of course, institutions is a wide range of kind of like entities. Some are more crypto native, some are less, and some are like. They don't have any relation to crypto at this point. I think there's a lot of institutional inquiries at the moment, so I think there isn't that much of a, in the sense that for us to do, it's more about the tooling, because obviously there's a big arbitrage at the moment. So let's say dollar is yielding in a us bank account at the moment at under 1% in a fixed deposit, for example, and at the same time you have 10%. This is just the past 30 day rate on stable coins, and without going even to volatile crypto assets. And obviously the opportunity is there.
00:54:52.962 - 00:55:36.942, Speaker D: But now it just takes time in the institutional landscape to structure things in a way that they can actually go and deposit. And there's a question, for example, of the custody, how they manage that, and once they have the custody, how they can actually deposit into these protocols. And that is something that many of the custodians are working quite much on these days. And the cool part about the Ave protocol and balancer protocol is that the positions are tokenized. So when you provide liquidity into balancer or into Ave, you have a tokenized position. So you could store that anywhere you want. So that helps quite a lot.
00:55:36.942 - 00:56:22.320, Speaker D: And I think the other thing, of course, is the security, like DeFi is in the current state, with the current complexity, is quite fresh. It takes a bit time to these protocols to mature. And Defi itself is not equal, like all projects are not putting effort into building institutional grade products. So you might have protocols that are putting more effort in getting institutional liquidity by making secure protocols. And some are just practically testing out sandboxing, and everything lives in the same kind of like a network. So I think those two components are important for institutional side.
00:56:23.970 - 00:56:48.470, Speaker B: On that same note, Stani, we have a question from the YouTube about the Ave insurance system and how this integration with balancer relates to the insurance fund. So if some smart contract bug were exploited, how would the Ave insurance fund would that be relevant or because this is something not completely aave, what are the details here with the Ave insurance fund and this integration?
00:56:49.610 - 00:57:43.282, Speaker D: Yeah, so the safety module, where we have, depending on the liquidity there, we have something like 1.5 billion worth of Avidair staked. That brings cash flow for the ave stakers, for backstopping the protocol that goes. Also the same backstopping applies into the asset manager fund. So the asset manager is exactly the same depositor as anyone else in that sense. And of course, there is the thing that you can also stake the balancer, the LP tokens into the safety module, the DVT. And that's kind of like a different thing because you don't want to have this kind of like a circle that they go back, like the insurance cover goes back into the pool.
00:57:43.282 - 00:58:08.190, Speaker D: If something happens to the pool, that will be very fortunate. And in this case, that pool will be separate and will not have this asset manager feature. So it's trusting, like balancer contracts there a bit. But the asset managers, those funds are covered with the safety module. And I think that's pretty cool. It's treated the same way as all the other depositors.
00:58:09.010 - 00:58:25.720, Speaker B: Would you say that that is perhaps a solution to what Ryan's question was? Which was YouTube question or bankless discord question as to how much weight do you think that the Ave insurance fund will help institutions in their just comfort with exploring this space?
00:58:27.050 - 00:59:06.050, Speaker D: I think it helps quite a lot, actually. And one thing is that institutions see it quite as a bespoke model. But interestingly, quite many things in decentralized finance is bespoke. So what balancer is doing is bespoke in the sense that you can stake your portfolio in various different percentages. You have 20%, let's say token a, 20% token b, and rest in it. And you can just take that into a particular pool with that kind of percentage combination and get fees for the trading. So that's a bespoke thing.
00:59:06.050 - 00:59:45.006, Speaker D: So I think institutionals, they see quite a lot of new things happening, but they don't kind of see it as something that they are not comfortable with in actually opposite way. That they see that you have best book products and best book ways to ensure those products. And I think it's very helpful. I don't know, I haven't done a survey yet on institutional level, but I feel that it's feedback, but I haven't. Noble answer about that. Every institution yet, that arbitrage that you.
00:59:45.028 - 01:00:10.390, Speaker A: Opened up with has got to be pretty attractive over time. As there's this rate divergence between what you can get in traditional finance and DFI. This is a quick question for Fernando, coming from the YouTube, wondering about balancer v one versus balancer v two, the transition process for liquidity providers. Is there anything a liquidity provider needs to do? Are they migrated seamlessly?
01:00:12.170 - 01:00:45.970, Speaker E: Definitely. So the nice thing about balancer d one and balancers is fully permissionless and noncustodial. So we have no admin powers to just bring everyone's liquidity to somewhere else. If we had that power, we would probably be able to steal people's fund, and we never want to have this power. So, yes, but we'll make things very easy for lps. It will be a seamless one click process where you just say, I want to migrate from this v one pool to this v two pool, and it should be pretty seamless.
01:00:47.030 - 01:01:29.470, Speaker A: I have a question for the both of you, something that I'm curious about just in general. This is the concept of protocols partnering. So Defi protocols partnering. How does a partnership work in Defi? So when two protocols decide to work together, there's obviously stuff that has to happen at the code layer, but I also get the sense that stuff happens at the meet space layer, too. Can you talk about maybe how this partnership came to be, why you did it? Because of capital, efficiency reasons. I understand sort of the motivation, but how does a partnership happen in Defi? Maybe I'll start with you, Fernando.
01:01:30.870 - 01:02:02.134, Speaker E: Sure, yeah. So it's something that people might think, oh, they just partnered, but it goes back like a long time, maybe two years already, right, Stanny? So as you say, ryan, it's a lot about people as well. So the teams will talk and we see that Stani is a great person. The team is awesome. They're very responsive, very nice. They exchange information. There's like the same ethos and principles as our team has, like openness.
01:02:02.134 - 01:02:36.594, Speaker E: Everything's open source. You're free and welcome to use our code as well. And let's share because it benefits both parts. And then as you kind of get closer, because you have the same principles and you're open to that, which not all the teams are, and we know that. Then you start seeing opportunities of how those two protocols could work nicely together, and then you start going down to the more technical level. Sometimes it goes the other way around. So people realize, oh, there is this great way to combine those two protocols.
01:02:36.594 - 01:03:06.910, Speaker E: Composability opportunity here, and then the protocols start talking. So, yeah, I think the way it started for us with Ave and I could say it's by far the biggest and most important partner for us. It's really started as an informal conversation and then it evolved into kind of a friendship and a lot of exchange and then opportunities just flourish and surface. Yeah.
01:03:07.060 - 01:03:08.960, Speaker A: Donnie, would you add anything to that?
01:03:10.130 - 01:04:06.386, Speaker D: I totally a. I think what drives us a lot at we, when we see people innovating quite a lot and doing something really smart and doing it in a secure way as well. And what struck me about the balancer team is that there is a lot of good ideas and very interesting execution and there is all the time innovation, and they're taking a lot of steps to do that and they're not making at all. That's the cool part that makes a perfect partner. You want to learn from what's going on there. I think there's a good benefit and things happening for both of the communities. I think the Alba community gets approached quite often and the partnerships falls off, are usually like.
01:04:06.386 - 01:04:44.686, Speaker D: They don't feel that. They feel that there is that much of a contribution. And in our case, we build things on top of balancer and balancer is now building things on top of our protocol. So there's this development contribution, which is really important. And also they review our ideas and we review theirs. So there's also this kind of like a mind sharing, usually some projects approach. They pretty much are looking on their own kind of community efforts in a way that, hey, let's do this, and this is good for everyone and both of us.
01:04:44.686 - 01:05:02.834, Speaker D: And then you're looking at, okay, what's happening here, that it's very one sided here, actually, there is like, you're building together things. And that is why I'm so excited when we are able to govern things inclusively between the communities. And that's going to be a very cool thing.
01:05:02.872 - 01:05:42.590, Speaker B: Now, guys, this has been a really awesome panel. And Dan, again, thank you for moderating the conversation between these two defi all stars. And Dan, my last question actually is to you as the author behind the fluid collateral piece. This seems to be a manifestation of exactly what was predicted in that piece. But now that we're here, where do you see this going? Is this just the first of many? Who else do you think is going to make integrations and partnerships like this? Now that we have almost two more years of data, what's next down the line with regards to capital efficiency partnerships in Defi?
01:05:43.490 - 01:07:36.294, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, I think this is honestly, it's a very big deal and it's still just scratching the surface. Right. So I actually wrote a piece on bankless this past summer about looking at, I think, called aquaponic yield farming and the idea of kind of prime brokerage protocols. And so one of the questions here, too, I think, becomes what does a really deep symbiotic partnership between different protocols look like, and what does it look like as protocols start to bring multiple functionalities in house? Does it make sense to actually integrate trading and borrowing and lending and futures and options and all sorts of crazy things and synthetics all into a single protocol? Or does it make sense to keep things somewhat compartmentalized and then work on very deep integrations with specific other protocols? Does it make sense to modularize to a bunch of different protocols that provide similar capabilities? I really don't know, but we're starting to find out, and it feels like it's snowballing. And there's this balance that we're seeing now, I think, between teams here, not to say that the balancer team and the ave team haven't been shipping very quickly, but then there are some teams that are just going like crazy, and I think probably being a little more lax on security with some of the stuff that they're doing, but really pushing integrations super fast and that's all well and good until things break and a lot of money gets lost. And so I think as an ecosystem, it's great that we've got protocols playing on different parts of that spectrum between speed and security, but as we do have a very interconnected system, there are also systemic risks from that.
01:07:36.294 - 01:08:33.400, Speaker C: And so I think it's only a matter of time until we see some pretty big blow ups. We saw something with cream and Alpha Hamora doing some interesting stuff there that they resolved, I thought, in an incredibly collaborative, interesting way as well. So I don't know where we're going. I just know we're going to see a lot more of these overlaps and integrations and really just unlocking this level of capital efficiency that is not possible in traditional finance. It's only possible because we have these open public ledgers and we can make sure that every asset is accounted for and is handled in an indisputable, programmatic way. And that is going to ultimately allow us to do so much more than could ever be done in Oldfi or tradfi or, however you want to call it, the legacy financial system.
01:08:34.250 - 01:08:58.830, Speaker A: Well, what a way to end it. Dan Ellitzer, thank you for that. When you're ready to publish your next piece on bankless, let us know. Maybe it'll be called superfluid specialization, something to that effect. Always excited to hear you predict the future because you've got a knack for predicting things that eventually come true. Dan Elitzer, Fernando Stani from Ave and Balancer, really excited about this partnership. Guys, thanks for joining us on this panel.
01:09:00.050 - 01:09:01.040, Speaker D: Thank you.
01:09:01.730 - 01:09:02.878, Speaker E: A lot of fun.
01:09:03.044 - 01:09:22.422, Speaker A: All right, bankless, this has been our first fireside chat. If you like these fireside chats, tell us. We'll do more of them. We enjoyed it. David and I did have to do much. We let the experts talk about it, which was also very fun, of course. Make sure you like and subscribe on YouTube if you're catching this.
01:09:22.422 - 01:09:27.940, Speaker A: We'll also publish this to the bankless premium feed, too, so you can get it that way. Thanks for joining us.
