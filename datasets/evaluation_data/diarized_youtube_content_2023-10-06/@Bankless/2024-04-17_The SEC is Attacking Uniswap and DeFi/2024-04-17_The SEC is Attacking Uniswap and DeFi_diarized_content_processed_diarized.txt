00:00:00.240 - 00:00:17.782, Speaker A: Big freaking deal here. Uniswap just received a enforcement notice from the SEC. This is called a wells notice, which is the SEC telling uniswap, we are bringing you to court. Get ready. Hayden Adams. When he tweeted out about this, he goes, I'm not surprised. Just annoyed.
00:00:17.782 - 00:00:39.166, Speaker A: Disappointed, like you, Ryan, and ready to fight. So, like, I would much rather have Hayden Adams and Uniswap labs a beloved protocol who decentralized and did things right and is literally the hardest nut to crack for the SEC to go to court with the SEC. They are literally our best people to send. Wow. Gary Gensler. That's a great question. Chose them to go after them.
00:00:39.166 - 00:00:57.254, Speaker A: And so, like, they chose our prize fighter. Yes. They're, like, best going after the champion, Hayden Adams. Like, they're gonna get absolutely worked, and then we're going to be able to take that victory and, like, parade it around Defi and, like, look, guys, like, uniswap is, like, leading the example here. They are the vanguard for us.
