00:02:13.020 - 00:02:15.350, Speaker C: Hello, Kevin. I'm good. How are you?
00:02:15.500 - 00:02:22.650, Speaker A: Pretty good. Glad to have you here. So let's tee off by talking about how you got into crypto and what keeps you in crypto.
00:02:24.270 - 00:04:06.710, Speaker C: Well, the how I got into crypto is a shorter answer versus the what keeps me in crypto piece. So I got interested in crypto back at the end of 2017 when I was doing a whole bunch of research around technology and really finance and where it could be taken to in a dynamic where it might serve more people than the current system. And so I stumbled upon a lot of articles around supply chain and things that I believe Vient were doing at the time who were part of consensus. And I kind of started digging a little bit deeper and trying to understand, okay, well, what are the real opportunities and real possibilities and real, essentially, trajectories that we can push this where it does indeed serve the many versus yet again, the few? And that's how I came to co found the bounties network. Met Mark. We essentially discovered that we had this common interest in how we could use smart contracts to essentially deploy funds for anything, anywhere in the world, regardless of whether individuals who were completing bounties were their countries, were part of the swift network, or even if they had bank accounts or not. And that, for me, was a very interesting proposition.
00:04:06.710 - 00:05:41.930, Speaker C: Right, because so many people are excluded from participation in the global economy and really just excluded from being able to, let's say, realize a higher potential, more potential, because of their geographic position and their socioeconomic status. And so it was kind of that flipping that whole dynamic in its head and really this whole redesign of the opportunities to tap into resource that really captured my attention. And then from there, everything that we did and everything, dare I say, that I continue to do, is always with that in mind. How can we enable easier access, broader access? How can we enable seats at the table for everybody? How do we create multiple tables that multiple people can sit at? And that kind of brings us to why, even though it is incredibly, incredibly taxing, energy wise, it's why, like, human energy wise, this is what keeps me in crypto, because I genuinely believe that we can get those things done, and I genuinely believe in working until we get those done.
00:05:42.080 - 00:06:14.050, Speaker A: Right. So you guys have done some interesting experiments with the bounties network of things that were regenerative and quite frankly, before their time. Can you tell us a little bit about bounties for the ocean and some of the people that you met through the bounties network that were able to earn a living and previously weren't able to before. The social impact there, I think, is really interesting because it's very human, the human thriving that you created there. Can you tell me about that?
00:06:14.200 - 00:07:53.726, Speaker C: Yeah, and this is what I really wanted us to do with bounties. And like you say, we were so ahead of our time that people were still looking at us going, wait, what do you want to do? Why are you doing this? So one of the main things that I really wanted us to experiment with is exactly this, right? Was the social impact side of things and really go very broad in the application of bounties with the distinct purpose of distributing funds anywhere and for nontechnical tasks, for nontechnical endeavors. Because particularly when we did the bounties for the oceans in 2018, there was very little in terms of nontechnical ways in to the web3 ecosystem for a great many people. And so one of my main desires was, okay, how do we create something so simple in terms of mechanism and in terms of task that anybody can access it and perform that said task, this task was a cleanup. You prove that you have done a cleanup and you get rewarded with crypto. Now, initially, we launched it in partnership with maker on World Ocean Day at the beginning, or I think middle of 2018, and just put it up as a bounty. We were rewarding, I believe, with ten die.
00:07:53.726 - 00:09:13.546, Speaker C: And it really took off to the point where we were getting submissions from people around the world for these cleanups that they were doing. We had people in Australia, in Romania, in all over the US. Honestly, in the UK, I can't even remember the full extent of the geographic reach, but it really took me by surprise, because I genuinely didn't think there were that many people who would tap in and start doing this. But as soon as we started getting these messages, essentially saying, this was so helpful because it not only provided an onboarding opportunity, but really an opportunity to do something and earn crypto versus buying it. Let us remember, it was 2018, so exchanges and on ramps were few and far between, even compared to today. Right? So it was incredibly heartening to discover this appetite for what we were doing. And it's one of the reasons why we created the pilot that we did later on in the year, in 2018, which was in the Philippines.
00:09:13.546 - 00:10:04.634, Speaker C: The reason why we picked the Philippines? Well, there were two reasons. One, the Philippines is the third most polluted country in the world. And the second reason was we found a partner on the ground who could insure the off ramp. And so we partnered with somebody to make sure that if we were paying people with crypto, they could then exchange it and turn it into filipino peso. This was a very important consideration because I genuinely did not want to show up somewhere and just say, here's magic Internet money. There's nothing you can do with it. So we did this project in the Philippines across two days, and we cleaned this beach in Manila Bay.
00:10:04.634 - 00:11:00.618, Speaker C: Now, what we discovered when we were scouting for a good location for a cleanup is this particular beach that was very close to a fisherman community. And we met this guy from that community on the beach on that day when we were scouting to see what the best kind of spot would be for us to clean. And he was burning some cables to get the copper out of the plastic casing. And so thankfully, we had a translator with us and we asked him what he was doing, and he basically explained the whole dynamic that is plaguing that whole community and probably so many others like it, that because the water is so polluted, there are no fish. If there are no fish, the fishermen have nothing to fish.
00:11:00.714 - 00:11:01.070, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:01.140 - 00:11:50.830, Speaker C: Therefore, the income dries out and then they have to find alternatives. Now, this is specifically and exactly one of the things that I wanted us to exemplify with this pilot and what we were doing in the Philippines is how can we diversify the means of income, how can we diversify the opportunities for people in the situation, in other similar situations, in any gradient of that situation, to essentially tap into resource in another way. And so we worked with that fisherman community. We onboarded almost 200 fishermen onto mobile wallets in 2018.
00:11:52.450 - 00:11:53.678, Speaker A: So ahead of your time.
00:11:53.764 - 00:12:40.026, Speaker C: Mobile wallets, so ahead of our time, yes. And also we hotspotted everybody on the beach. It was an intense, laborious, but incredibly rewarding, incredibly rewarding exercise because one of the main things that we did, other than clean 3.5, I think, tons of trash, and this was in 4 hours, 2 hours per day, because then it gets too hot and we couldn't be on the beach. We also unlocked this opportunity for people to understand the mechanism, have the tools in place, I. E. A wallet, and know where to go to do more bounties.
00:12:40.026 - 00:13:15.910, Speaker C: And this is what a small yet very interesting percentage of that group of fishermen did. They went on to complete other bounties. And that was the main thing. And the main takeaway for me is that you open up a door to alternative, to choice. You create that choice. As soon as you give people the tools to do it, they will do it. And that didn't depend on any bank.
00:13:15.910 - 00:13:49.654, Speaker C: It didn't depend on any charity. It didn't depend on any, I don't know, international organization that has an office in that country that costs, I don't know how many millions in admin and all of that. It was a simple opportunity, a simple event, and the tooling that is needed to then continue tapping into, obviously, the pool of opportunity that we're all, you.
00:13:49.692 - 00:14:42.834, Speaker A: Know, it reminds me of that Charlie Munger quote, show me the incentive and I'll show you the I. The bounties for the ocean situation. It kind of seemed like, oh, the water was polluted. And so all of these fishermen didn't have a way of earning an income, and so they had to burn trash in order or find other ways of creating an income, and they had to burn trash, which probably further polluted the ocean. And then the cycle sort of continues as coordination failure. And then you, using Ethereum and mechanism design, have this really elegant protocol for if you do x, I will give you y is basically the bounties protocol. And then what you do is you go to all the fishermen and you say, if you clean up the trash on the beach, then I will give you tokens.
00:14:42.834 - 00:15:05.630, Speaker A: And it sounds like you all cleaned up 3.5 tons of trash over that afternoon. And so I think that it's a really interesting example. If you show me the incentive, I'll show you the outcome. You basically shifted the shelling point of the incentives of all those fishermen on the beach and created a regenerative outcome by using mechanism design. Is that more or less accurate?
00:15:05.970 - 00:16:06.082, Speaker C: More or less. And to be fair, I think it also dives into the intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation or incentive, because if you think about it, yes, they were getting tokens in exchange, but they were also cleaning the beach that they need for the fishing. Do you see what I mean? So then you have that double motivation to participate in something like this. And the opportunities that this unlocks, or rather the possibilities of these permutations that it unlocks, is just something that isn't necessarily, I don't know whether it's not necessarily thought about in the current models, or it's just like everything is so cumbersome and so loaded with administrative layers that it's just impossible to be as flexible as that, or as, I guess, prone to innovation as that.
00:16:06.216 - 00:16:31.900, Speaker A: Right. Amazing. So I guess the other thread that I want to pull on is that from reading some of your work and preparing for this interview, the phrase human thriving has jumped out at me. And that's something that you've been speaking about through the years. And I'm wondering if how your experiences at bounties and other places in the ecosystem has led you to pull on this thread of human thriving. Can you tell us about that?
00:16:32.750 - 00:19:16.190, Speaker C: Absolutely. So I think one of the main dynamics that we kind of see in, let's say, the web two world, or certainly the world as many of us have experienced it for, I don't know, the past few decades, or rather a lot longer than that, has been this incredibly extractive, incredibly demanding, with little reward play where we kind of come in and everything that we do is almost designed to extract every ounce of anything that we have to give. And again, without that much back. And so I think it's one of the reasons why we see so many different imbalances. And when I say imbalance, I mean that across the board, right? Economic, social, geographical, all of that, because we haven't necessarily thought about what it means for a human to thrive. We've thought about living, okay, what does a human need to live? What are the layers of that basic middle class? We've thought about all of these different boxes, almost, but haven't ever focused on what an individual or what humanity in its totality needs to be in a state of thriving. And a lot of that comes from the experience, not just my own, but I think just speaking to so many people in so many different, I guess, situations or times in their lives, or I guess, space in their mind, that they always feel like there is something that they would want to do more of, but feel unable to because of some sort of constraint, whether it is, I cannot do this volunteer work because I have to work to pay my bills, right? Or I would love to get involved in this, but again, the country that I'm in does not have xy connections with the global economy, or I live over here, and I would love to work over here, but there's no opportunity for me to do that.
00:19:16.190 - 00:20:52.174, Speaker C: And so that just creates this imbalance, and it creates this stress that so many of us go through on a variety of different planes of, let's say, or areas of our lives. But I think one of the things that web3 puts in play are the mechanisms to potentially at least take care of some of those, right? And that, for me, is something that is incredibly, incredibly important and incredibly powerful, because you are shifting from a fully extractive way of being and having to behave in an extractive manner yourself, because your whole environment is like that. And shifting to this regenerative way of doing things. Where I put value in, I get value out, and it is like a butterfly that constantly moves this value all around its wings and back into the body and over and over again, versus a one way I'm going to take from here and just keep it. There's nothing going back to replace it. There is nothing going back to essentially ensure that that continues to provide value. And so it's the main thing that I think, for me, is what I see in web3.
00:20:52.174 - 00:21:36.880, Speaker C: That is the promise that I see, and that is what everything that I tend to get involved with. And there's many things that I want to get involved with because I want so much to move and push this whole thing forward that I think it's. Yeah, I don't know, I want to say intoxicating, but it isn't that. I guess it's where the hope keeps. Like the well of hope keeps being at a certain level that enables me to continue doing what I'm doing.
00:21:37.890 - 00:22:29.886, Speaker A: Right. I guess what I heard was that the current financial system is not serving people. It's become this sort of extractive tool of the rich and the few to extract from the poor and the many. And what if we could build a more regenerative crypto economic system by hitting a reset on that and programming better incentives into the system using mechanism design or ethereum or community culture? I actually think that mechanism design is one thing that we're all very long on in the space, but the creation of social norms in these communities and the shelling points created around those I actually think is a really important part. And how can that lead to more human thriving, not only in our local communities, but then exporting that to the world? Did I just say back to you what you said to me? Is there anything you would change about that?
00:22:30.068 - 00:24:06.878, Speaker C: I think a big piece though, and this is again, something that I tend to bring up in conversation, is that there's a lot of unlearning that needs to happen. Because again, we for generations have been programmed in the same extractive mindset. And I think it's important, particularly when we talk about communities and particularly when we talk about these norms, and particularly when we talk about evolving that and not recreating the same thing somewhere else. It's important to build mindfully, and I say this a lot, and I mean it to a high degree. It is important to do it mindfully because I think we need to build with that thriving mindset whilst being in an extractive environment, right? Because right now, where most of us are with our feet in two boats, we still have to deal with day to day life and every structure that we kind of encounter in that whilst building something completely new. And that is very hard because you're so deeply immersed in this extractive thing whilst trying to build something that is its opposite almost, or so far from it that it would stimulate human thriving versus, again, just maintaining that extractive dynamic. And so it is very difficult.
00:24:06.878 - 00:24:34.920, Speaker C: And I think I've spoken about this in kernel and I've spoken about this just in either group conversations or one to ones. It is important to unlearn a lot of the behaviors that we have just almost created into habits which are, if I win, you lose. If I get ahead, that guy loses or is left behind.
00:24:36.090 - 00:25:01.890, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think that what's hard there is the nuance that's involved in running our whole financial lives on this old system that we've got 100 years of cruft, and probably some of those learnings are good and we want to transport over, but some of them are not. And then you have to live in both worlds in order to have a toe into one of each, and then you have to shift your center of gravity forward to the other one.
00:25:02.040 - 00:25:12.002, Speaker C: You almost have to imagine literally being with one leg in two boats. What does that look like in terms of balance? It's going to be hard.
00:25:12.136 - 00:25:38.698, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think agility is key, and then hopefully for Gen Alpha and beyond, there's this regenerative crypto economic system that they can just sort of live in natively. And I'm wondering what that looks like and how to build that. If you could just solve that. Actually, Simona, real quick, how do we build a whole web scale regenerative crypto economic system?
00:25:38.864 - 00:25:51.440, Speaker C: You know, what that brings to mind is just like, that meme of the. No, it's always sunny in Philadelphia with all of the red. Yes.
00:25:52.230 - 00:25:54.226, Speaker A: Charlie will figure it out for, like.
00:25:54.248 - 00:27:01.458, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. I've given up smoking, though, so I can't recreate that perfectly. But one of the things that I will say is it's incredibly important to bring as many perspectives into solving that as possible. And I think, again, that just brings me to a lot of the things that I tend to do other than those core, I guess, areas of focus that you mentioned for me right now. But just in the broader ecosystem, I'm very involved in creating opportunities, or hopefully creating opportunities for new people to come into the space and hopefully creating pathways for them to do that versus the dynamic of people come to the edge of web3, and we're like, okay, see you in there. It's great, but find your own way in. I think it's important to create those pathways.
00:27:01.458 - 00:28:07.862, Speaker C: Right? When you go into, like, you go hiking, there's the beaten track, and then sometimes if you go off into the wilderness, it's a little bit more difficult. Right? There's going to be branches, there's going to be all sorts of crap that's in your way, and some people might turn back and not persevere. It's important for us to at least clear some sort of path or at least create some sort of way in so that people can then continue their own journey at their own pace with whatever it is that they're comfortable and get involved in whatever they resonate with, right and value align with. And I think creating those opportunities is incredibly important, again, for that perspective, for that plurality of perspective. I don't claim, and I will never say that I can solve the whole thing, because I can't. There's so much thinking that needs to come into play. There's so many blind spots that I myself have, let alone like, everybody has blind spots.
00:28:07.862 - 00:29:09.070, Speaker C: Everybody has the curse of knowledge. Everybody has certain degrees of privilege. And it is important to get a multifaceted view of where we need to get to in order to get there. Because again, the same way as you have a flat map versus a, you can definitely see more and understand the ways around and the ways in and the ways through and the ways across. When you have that 3d model versus an incredibly, like, think of the old maps, right, that weren't even to scale when we were just very crudely drawn versus something that is incredibly, incredibly, let's say granular and incredibly nuanced. Because I think that is the way we build what we want with nuance. Right now, we don't have nuance.
00:29:11.010 - 00:29:25.090, Speaker A: Yeah. The word that I've been using for this is intersubjective consensus. So the combination of multiple people's subjective consensus and skills is how you kind of grasp the whole elephant of what we're building.
00:29:25.240 - 00:30:30.214, Speaker D: When you shop for plane tickets, you probably use kayak, Expedia, or Google to compare ticket prices. So why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto? When you make your trades, you want to make sure you're getting the best possible price on your trade, and that's why you should be using matcha. Matcha has smart order routing that splits your trade across all the various liquidity sources in Ethereum and is also operational on polygon, avalanche, binance, smart chain and other chains. Trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me in a single easy to use platform and allows me to make limit on chain orders. So you can set and forget your defi trades and they will go through automatically while you're away. So when you're making a trade, head over to matcha XYZ slash bankless and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets. Opolis is a memberowned digital employment cooperative offering payroll, health insurance and membership perks that go beyond the basics that you would find at your normal nine to five Opolis offers not only health benefits, but also pay stubs and w two s workers comp and unemployment insurance, as well as disability benefits for independent dow workers that are traditionally reserved for regular employment situations.
00:30:30.214 - 00:31:08.600, Speaker D: Opolis provides a tax compliant way to get your paycheck in crypto and professionalize your work life situation. Opolis members enjoy an average of 20% to 50% savings on top rated national group health insurances, as well as self sovereign portable employment. You can also get tokenized rewards based on consumption, staking and referrals, and also the ability to fund payroll in fiat and stablecoins without the use of centralized exchange. You can also receive paychecks in fiat and whitelisted digital currencies. So sign up for Opolis today and get 1000 work and 1000 bank tokens when you become a member of Opelis by May 25, 2022 and get started working your self sovereign life.
00:31:10.650 - 00:31:18.170, Speaker A: I'm wondering what you're working on these days and if and how it sort of supports your work in this vision.
00:31:19.790 - 00:32:57.874, Speaker C: So with status, the stuff that I put in motion and hopefully that is coming to fruition soon, is a communities feature that essentially means that the whole status stack, which is very helpful and very useful and it was built from scratch when they first started because there was no infrastructure. But it is very much in line with the principles of decentralization and privacy. Hopefully that gets shipped this year. And we have an alternative, like a true web3 alternative to the community tooling that we use right now, which is discord and a whole bunch of bots, right, messaging and then some, and then some with the nice crypto dynamics voting in there and everything that we need. So that's one, two is, and this is very much what I started getting interested in last year, is as dows have really evolved and obviously taken center stage, it's very important to also figure out those flows and do them right now. And this is something that I guess is just a result of a lot of people being very early and a lot of people experimenting. There's a lot of dows with a lot of people doing multiple dows, but not necessarily doing them properly.
00:32:57.874 - 00:34:57.114, Speaker C: And when I say doing them properly, I mean it's a surface level of engagement. There is no depth where I would like to see the iceberg vibe, right? So this is the surface, but this is what is happening. And that bit is what I'm interested in figuring out is what the structure is. How do we make it something that isn't a stupidly bureaucratic and laborsome and cumbersome dynamic that just people don't have time for, which keeps us at that surface level and never going any deeper. And so I think figuring out what those flows are, figuring out how we're able to capture, distribute, and allocate attention in a way that flows versus in a way that is simplistic and lacking in substance is an incredibly broad endeavor, which is probably why I'm interested in it, because I would really love to solve that. And I think with the work that I'm doing with Gitcoin, bless you with the things that I'm doing with Gitcoin, and exploring what those different governance engagement flows are, or even not even just governance, what are the flows through which we bring these human dynamics into a pattern and into a relationship that actually does create something different and does create something that is inclusive and participatory and transparent and efficient and effective and non taxing. It's a lot to figure out, but very interesting indeed.
00:34:57.114 - 00:36:25.802, Speaker C: And I think some of the tooling that I'm working on, I hope will serve the broader ecosystem because, and this isn't because I co founded a standard, but I do like standards. I think it's important mainly for facilitating a lot of the information assimilation and decision making. It just makes sense, especially with the pace of crypto, especially with so many different things happening at the same time, it is humanly impossible to keep tabs and be involved equally in everything. It just cannot happen. And so figuring those dynamics out is very interesting, and that is something that I'm working on and really interested in. And then the other piece, of course, is the community aspect of it, and creating space and creating spaces for people to join the community, for the community to grow stronger, for the culture to be celebrated, for the culture to evolve, for the principles and the values to continuously be there. And I kind of tend to do that through a lot of the events that I create and co create.
00:36:25.802 - 00:37:18.886, Speaker C: So Liscon was a great example. Shelling point. I curated the agenda for shelling point, and I think it's important to continuously create those opportunities, particularly now where we're back to some IRL engagement, some ability to gather together in a physical space, and also, I think, maintain that culture, particularly the culture that we all kind of, I think, fell in love with when we started on this crypto path, because I think it is incredibly important and it does just keep us together and it keeps us together regardless of the ups and downs and the, I don't know, law of crypto undulation that takes us on an emotional roller coaster.
00:37:18.918 - 00:37:39.826, Speaker A: Every single. Yeah. It is a very volatile space, and there's a lot moving at many times. And you and I have been through a bull and a bear together. I'm curious. This episode will probably air after shelling point, but hopefully everyone came, which was.
00:37:39.848 - 00:37:41.346, Speaker C: Amazing and it was great.
00:37:41.528 - 00:38:30.340, Speaker A: Yeah. And you've done such a great job curating that agenda and creating that space. And I'm wondering how we can sort of within Gitcoin Dow create that space that creates a depth of involvement. I listen to a lot of Sam Harris podcasts, and he talks about how nuance is the enemy of common understanding. And I'm wondering, when we build these dow governance structures, how do we build the capacity for nuance and for understanding the depth of our governance structures? And so we can solve these mechanisms and do it in a decentralized way that it's not just you and I top down making these decisions, but creating that inner subjective consensus being the channel for the participants. And it just feels like that paradox of nuance being the enemy of common understanding is the hard thing to design around. Do you have any thoughts on that?
00:38:30.790 - 00:40:45.054, Speaker C: So I think if you look at one of the things that I'm, and again, part of that human thriving dynamic is this idea of open source economies, right, where everything is modular and everything, the distinct blocks of what make up an economy, are readily available. The instructions for putting those together are readily available. Let's say again, the instructions are a little bit even easier than the Ikea situation, right? So it's very easy to take the blocks. I think the nuance maybe is brought in by the different communities that employ them or take them and put them together, however it is that works for them. The nuance comes from each community, but the blocks are there to allow for the nuance, right? So it's almost like you would, and again, just taking the flat pack furniture thing as an example, it's like you have those pieces, but you also have allow for the opportunity to paint it, to maybe make something else out of those pieces, even if you have everything. And maybe you discard some, but you keep the main bits and then you paint it in 10,000 different colors versus, like, keeping it white or keeping it beige or keeping it whatever, but it allows for it. I think the moment you potentially sacrifice the possibility for nuance, the possibility for innovation, the possibility for even, like, I guess, ways of using this that we cannot even think about right now, and putting barriers to that is just not why.
00:40:45.054 - 00:41:57.154, Speaker C: It's just a stupid thing to do. And I think that's where the tooling should be there allowing for nuance, but also allowing for efficiency. Right? Because again, coming back to biomimicry, and I've spoken about that, when was it, in 2020 at shelling point, which was sustained? Web three, at that point in nature, you have this optimum window of viability, which is, and nature finds its way to this middle point naturally, because that's what it does. So it's at the halfway point between diversity and efficiency. So it reaches that optimum window of viability where an ecosystem thrives, a complex system thrives at that window. Now, what we tend to do as humans, and particularly the economy, is a great example. We either have it too diverse, which is like collapsing because there's so much happening, or too efficient.
00:41:57.154 - 00:42:44.486, Speaker C: And this is where we go in with restrictions, with austerity, with all of that, to strip it way back down from way over here, missing the middle completely. And you go in the other extreme, there is never that opportunity to get to the balance point, which is technically where that human thriving would happen. You either go way too far or way too far this way, way too far this way. And that is something that, again, we need to be very mindful of. When we create the rules, when we create the systems, when we create the contrast, when we create everything that we create. Don't push too far either side, right? Because the good stuff is in the middle. And as we know, just anything.
00:42:44.486 - 00:42:48.822, Speaker C: Right? Get through the shell. It's in the middle. That's what's in the middle.
00:42:48.876 - 00:42:52.310, Speaker A: Reminds me of the Buddha quote about finding the middle path.
00:42:54.570 - 00:43:24.980, Speaker C: However way you slice it and whatever philosophy and whatever, I guess, discipline you look at, particularly, again, when we talk about nature, when we talk about philosophy and things like that, it is that. It is that balance. And the tricky bit is knowing when you're there and maybe discovering how to get there. So that's what I'm doing. What are you doing?
00:43:26.310 - 00:43:35.686, Speaker A: Trying to spread the meme of regenerative crypto economics. And thank you for riding shotgun with me for 45 minutes. We are coming up on time. Is there anything I didn't ask that you want to tell us?
00:43:35.708 - 00:44:54.142, Speaker C: Simona, what didn't you ask? I think maybe a good kind of. I don't know, a good way of looking at everything. And this is just a little bit of advice, because I've definitely been through these moments, and I know that so many of us, particularly who have been in this ecosystem for a while, have gone through at different times. It tends to be very intense, and it tends to be very exhausting, particularly when it is a constant roller coaster of emotion and roller coaster of everything that it brings with it. I think finding that piece that motivates you to keep going and motivates you to essentially keep going and keep going and keep building. I think if human thriving is something that you're aligned with, I think keep that in mind. It's an incredibly all encompassing and also an incredibly generous way of looking at things.
00:44:54.142 - 00:45:35.210, Speaker C: And I think this is the stage that we need to enter in where we are generous not just with ourselves, but with everybody else. And I think looking at things from a generous perspective and wanting to create a system or a world where generosity is, let's say, the motivator versus extraction, for me, I find that that keeps the, I don't know, the carrot, I guess, the infinite carrot that keeps.
00:45:36.110 - 00:45:46.334, Speaker A: Yeah, that seems like the right balance. Well, this is really inspiring stuff. Simona, thank you so much for spending this time with us. Where can people find you online? Find you and your work?
00:45:46.532 - 00:46:03.490, Speaker C: Twitter is probably the best. I also put together a link tree just to remind myself of all of the things that I do, because I also tend to forget sometimes. So it's just at sim, underscore pop, and you can find everything there.
00:46:03.640 - 00:46:05.566, Speaker A: All right, thanks so much, Simona.
00:46:05.678 - 00:46:07.440, Speaker C: Thank you. Thanks for having me.
