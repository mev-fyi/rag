00:00:00.170 - 00:00:18.378, Speaker A: Ms. Wagner is like, Yo MIT version of Gary was pro blockchain, but SEC gary is anti blockchain. And then Richie Torres is like, yo is the Pokemon card of security. These people are listening to crypto Twitter. They are like, these are our the power of crypto. Twitter is like getting into Congress.
00:00:18.474 - 00:00:28.406, Speaker B: Well, it's because it's distilled logic. I mean bank. Bankless nation. It is the last Friday of September, david, what time is it?
00:00:28.428 - 00:00:48.380, Speaker A: It's the Bankless Friday weekly roll up, Ryan, where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless into the frontier this week with a bunch of clips of Gary getting grilled. So, everyone, everyone prepare for that one. If you're not listening to this with coffee because it's too late in the day, well, then you should get your popcorn, because that is what you will need.
00:00:48.910 - 00:00:57.034, Speaker B: I mean, this is catharsis. I think for many of you in this episode, you'll enjoy this very much. Also, crypto was present in Washington.
00:00:57.082 - 00:00:58.250, Speaker A: This is a one two pipe.
00:00:58.410 - 00:01:05.418, Speaker B: Yeah. Coinbase's stand with Crypto day was held at Capitol Hill the same day that Gensler was giving testimony in front of Congress.
00:01:05.514 - 00:01:06.138, Speaker A: Convenient.
00:01:06.234 - 00:01:07.658, Speaker B: What about the timing of that, David?
00:01:07.674 - 00:01:40.940, Speaker A: What else we got after that? We'll talk about pudgy penguins in Walmart Landing? A huge deal, a ton of distribution for Pudgy penguins, also, with each toy purchased having an on chain identity on ZkSync. So we'll talk about that then after. Also, not only are penguins getting identity, but citizens of Buenos Aires perhaps also getting some on chain presence as well. We'll talk about that. And then, of course, we're gonna do the PSA of Deepfakes and phishing attacks that are out there. We got a vitalik deep fake that we want to show you. It's pretty hilarious, but not if you believe it.
00:01:40.940 - 00:01:51.274, Speaker A: Notable VC. Fred Wilson got fished for 40 NFTs this week. So if Fred Wilson can get fished, so can you. We will talk about this and more. What else we got, Ryan?
00:01:51.322 - 00:02:00.046, Speaker B: You know, the usual bitcoin. ETF. Stuff. ETH might be getting futures. There's a ton to talk about every week. This is a bullish week. I think I'm declaring it such, David.
00:02:00.046 - 00:02:08.418, Speaker B: And we got some green candles when we get to the markets. But before we get in, David, we got a message from our friends and sponsors over at Layer Zero. What do they want the folks at home to know?
00:02:08.504 - 00:02:45.326, Speaker A: They want you to know that after a year, over a year of combined effort, layer Zero and Google Cloud have announced their partnership, and they are ready to build the interoperable cross chain apps of the future. What is layer zero? Of course, layer Zero is a set of smart contracts that are deployed on every single chain. These smart contracts connect to each other. How do they connect to each other? Well, they need some Oracle service in the center to be the chatter boxes, the passing messages between all of the layer zero smart contracts across all of the 15 different chains. Google Cloud is that new default oracle. That is the partnership that they have created. So there is a link in the show notes for you to go explore more.
00:02:45.326 - 00:02:50.030, Speaker A: If you're a builder who wants to build on layer zero, layer zero network is also the URL.
00:02:50.110 - 00:03:01.062, Speaker B: Well, you know what I want to learn more about this week, David, is markets. Tell me about the old think. I haven't looked at this yet, but I think we got some green on the week.
00:03:01.116 - 00:03:02.434, Speaker A: We got some green, dude.
00:03:02.482 - 00:03:03.734, Speaker B: Let's look at the bitcoin charts first.
00:03:03.772 - 00:03:08.054, Speaker A: What's bitcoin showing us some single digit green. Look at that green right on the right. On the right.
00:03:08.092 - 00:03:08.486, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:08.588 - 00:03:24.042, Speaker A: That's your dose of dopamine for this week. It's like whoo bitcoin up 2%. Whopping 2%. Start of the week at 26,600, ending the week. Well, Thursday morning, if you call that the end of the week. It's not the end of the week. 27,150 up 2%.
00:03:24.042 - 00:03:42.210, Speaker A: Ether price up a little bit more. Starting the week at 1660, up four and a half percent to the current price. Excuse me. Starting the week at 1560, ending the week right around 1660, where we are right now, 1660. I mean, it's still low. That is a low price. We are getting excited about very little right now.
00:03:42.280 - 00:03:50.386, Speaker B: Yeah, it's up such a small degree, you shouldn't even be excited about this. Yeah, we are. Four and a half percent on the week. I'll tell you, it's better than when's.
00:03:50.418 - 00:03:52.440, Speaker A: The last time we had a double digit week, man?
00:03:52.890 - 00:04:05.098, Speaker B: Double digit? Up or down? I can't remember either, actually. We've been in a flatland for so long, it's just like kind of a little bit of a bleed out. All the way from 1900. Weren't we over 2000 a few weeks ago?
00:04:05.184 - 00:04:10.902, Speaker A: Yeah, we have touched over 2000 in this bear market. But man, on the cracking chart, feel like it? Yeah.
00:04:10.976 - 00:04:16.190, Speaker B: Last time we were at two K was July. In July. Briefly.
00:04:16.690 - 00:04:22.954, Speaker A: I can't even remember July. I was in the mountains. It's been downhill ever since. I caught back for the mountains.
00:04:23.002 - 00:04:36.974, Speaker B: Yeah, it really was. It's been all downhill since you guys. So the only thing you can do, Dave, is go to the mountains. Bad things happen to Gary Gensler when you go to the mountains. Although I guess nothing bad happened to him this week. Anyway, I'm skipping too far ahead. We'll have our Gary later in the episode ETH.
00:04:37.022 - 00:04:49.030, Speaker A: Bitcoin up 2%. Total crypto market cap, $1.11 trillion. Layer two scaling factor touched 6% this week, down to 5.5%. Still at all time highs, layer zero.
00:04:49.180 - 00:04:51.080, Speaker B: Wait, what? Touched 6%.
00:04:51.790 - 00:04:54.630, Speaker A: Total value locked, six x. Six x is what I meant.
00:04:54.710 - 00:04:55.222, Speaker B: Activity.
00:04:55.286 - 00:05:02.560, Speaker A: Yeah, layer two activity touched six x of ethereum's, but now it's at 5.69. Nice.
00:05:03.010 - 00:05:12.862, Speaker B: 60 transactions per second. 64 transactions per second. Yeah, that's where we get the six X. So we got more transactions Per second left in this tank, I think.
00:05:12.916 - 00:05:13.534, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:05:13.652 - 00:05:20.786, Speaker B: David, you want to talk about the general markets, like all the TradFi markets? You want to talk about Macro really quick because it's Been Super confusing to me.
00:05:20.888 - 00:05:32.870, Speaker A: And then I read we're also doing a Macro show on Tuesday as show? So talking about the state of macro from a crypto person. So as a crypto person who understands macro so I'm really excited for that Show.
00:05:32.940 - 00:05:36.418, Speaker B: Okay, are you a crypto person that understands macro? David, do you understand macro?
00:05:36.514 - 00:05:41.190, Speaker A: When I have a smarter macro person with me, then yes, I understand macro.
00:05:41.270 - 00:05:45.674, Speaker B: My question To You Is, does anybody really understand Macro, particularly right now?
00:05:45.872 - 00:05:46.694, Speaker A: Current snapshot?
00:05:46.742 - 00:05:58.202, Speaker B: Definitely not. All right, so here's The Tweet current situation. One. Stocks are falling like a recession is coming. Two. Oil prices are rising like there's no recession in sight. That's contradictory.
00:05:58.202 - 00:06:17.058, Speaker B: Three, interest rates Are rising like we have 10% inflation. Yes, they are. Four, gold Is falling like inflation Is gone. Five, housing prices Are rising like rates Are falling. And six, commercial Real estate Is falling like it's 2008. Nothing adds up here. That's the way I feel about Macro right now.
00:06:17.058 - 00:06:24.438, Speaker B: It's very confusing. There Is a confusing Set of signals Going on and it's not adding up in my head. What do you think about this?
00:06:24.524 - 00:06:49.294, Speaker A: Yeah, they follow through and they say it's beginning to feel like a Pivot point in sentiment. I don't know if I'm about to say what I think they are meaning by this, but when there's a Bunch Of Confusion, people, I think brace for something, brace for clarity. And then whatever that clarity is will define sentiment. Like, where are we going? We don't know. As soon as we find out, we'll know how we feel about it. But we know it's going to be different from here.
00:06:49.332 - 00:06:51.806, Speaker B: Different good or different bad? Those are the only two directions, right?
00:06:51.828 - 00:06:54.638, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess that's the reductive take about it.
00:06:54.804 - 00:06:57.410, Speaker B: But it's basically like we don't really Know.
00:06:57.480 - 00:06:57.906, Speaker A: We don't know.
00:06:57.928 - 00:07:25.770, Speaker B: I mean, that's why I'm Very Interested in Doing this Episode, this Macro episode next week to see what the newest macro person kind of knows. I will say one thing, though. I think Volatility is back on the menu. I think that's what this means. Because when the market doesn't know what direction it's going to go in, then it can kind of lurch in one direction or the other. So weird macro climate right now on the back of Stimulus, on the back of money printing. Like what's going on here?
00:07:25.840 - 00:07:46.286, Speaker A: And just to be clear about something we've previously talked about stocks being at all time highs. That's been, like, kind of the theme of the last two months? Or I would say yeah, well, so from looking at the Spy, you don't have the chart up but it has declined by 7% since July. So the spy is down 7%, which.
00:07:46.308 - 00:07:54.418, Speaker B: Is that goes to the first bullet point. Stocks are falling like a recession is coming. I don't know. Down 7% just doesn't feel like a lot to me.
00:07:54.584 - 00:08:02.790, Speaker A: Well, in the trad market, 7% is a lot historically, but not recently. 7% in the trade, actually, that's just like trades are also volatile.
00:08:03.130 - 00:08:40.750, Speaker B: Okay, well, we'll try to make sense of this, but let's get back to crypto. This is a negative report from JPMorgan who said Ethereum's activity post Shanghai that was the last hard fork back in March has been disappointing. JPMorgan calling Ethereum's progress. Disappointing. They've got some reasons for this. While the shift from proof of work to proof of stake meant that the energy consumption from Ethereum collapsed by 99%, the Ethereum supply is shrinking and staking rose sharply by 50% since the Shanghai upgrade. While that happened, the increase in network activity has been rather disappointing.
00:08:40.750 - 00:09:01.874, Speaker B: Ethereum's daily transactions, daily active addresses and total value locked on D Five protocols on the network have all experienced declines since the last hard fork. So JP Morgan, their analyst, expressing some bearishness here expressing I'm not mad, just disappointed with that.
00:09:01.932 - 00:09:21.754, Speaker A: My response to that is, who the hell are you? JP Morgan doesn't know how to analyze these things. Disappointing with ethereum post Shanghai activity. Bruh it's just a broader crypto downturn. And also, they're just wrong. He JP Morgan. He is wrong. They say layer twos have displayed mixed results.
00:09:21.754 - 00:09:32.926, Speaker A: Well, no TVL and economic activity on layer twos across the board are all up. I don't know where the hell they're getting their data from, but not only is their data wrong, but their analysis is poor.
00:09:33.038 - 00:09:39.894, Speaker B: Well, let's go to the actual numbers. Steven? Layer two, Beat, provides a good source for value locked on layer twos. What are we looking at at the.
00:09:39.932 - 00:09:56.460, Speaker A: 180 day time frame? It's basically flat. It's marginally up. It's basically flat. So flat. TVL ten point ten and a half billion dollars. Activity is up. It's up so much, it's unequivocally up by a lot.
00:09:56.460 - 00:09:59.290, Speaker A: I'm disappointed in JPMorgan.
00:10:01.230 - 00:10:05.402, Speaker B: Wow. Have you ever been not disappointed with JPMorgan, David?
00:10:05.466 - 00:10:08.926, Speaker A: Generally disappointed by banking in general, really?
00:10:09.028 - 00:10:43.238, Speaker B: You should start a podcast called Bankless David about escaping your bank over time, slowly. I think Vance Spencer put that tweet in perspective as well. Actually, I don't think he was responding to that tweet in particular, but we are. We got some perspective here from Vance Spencer. This is ethereum. If you charted against some of the fastest growing tech companies in human history, companies like Alphabet it was Google, of course, and Meta or Zoom or Microsoft. And how quickly over time it took them to surpass 10 billion in revenue.
00:10:43.238 - 00:10:54.766, Speaker B: Okay, how long did it take them? It took ethereum seven years. And when charted against these other tech companies, there's only one that did that faster, and that is google.
00:10:54.868 - 00:11:03.422, Speaker A: Google, yeah. And Ethereum really did all of its $10 billion of revenue inside of like 2020 to 2023.
00:11:03.556 - 00:11:12.366, Speaker B: Yeah. Look at this line. It's just kind of like a slope line up. So, I mean, doing pretty well, all things considered.
00:11:12.398 - 00:11:16.706, Speaker A: JPMorgan not disappointing. I'm not disappointed by this and I'm.
00:11:16.738 - 00:11:22.840, Speaker B: Not disappointed also, long term perspective, not disappointed in the price of ETH over the last seven years either.
00:11:23.530 - 00:11:42.938, Speaker A: And we can keep going. Uniswap this week hit 300 million in swaps. 300 million unique trades. Swaps has happened on Uniswap. Uniswap was invented in 2019. 300 million swaps since 2019. Is that disappointing? Swaps is that disappointing? I'm not disappointed by that in the slightest.
00:11:43.034 - 00:12:01.950, Speaker B: I feel great about that 300 million, about JPMorgan. I think it's part of a broader crypto sentiment and I've seen a lot of takes just in general in news, but even in financial analyst news, like JPMorgan research, that sort of thing, it comes back down to this. David mainstream thinks that crypto is dead.
00:12:02.030 - 00:12:02.370, Speaker A: Right?
00:12:02.440 - 00:12:31.482, Speaker B: Again, like always, this always happens and this is what makes this a buying opportunity. As with previous cycles. And when crypto ten x's the next cycle, don't let anybody tell you you didn't earn it. Right? Because if you're buying here when everyone is saying crypto is dead, it's never coming back that they're doing the point. That's how you earn so easy.
00:12:31.616 - 00:12:33.998, Speaker A: The signals are just being laid at our feet right now.
00:12:34.084 - 00:12:41.886, Speaker B: They really are. I tweeted something like that out and somebody responded with this life cycle. What are we looking at here?
00:12:41.988 - 00:13:01.890, Speaker A: Yeah, just like the cycle of the bull bear market. So in the top of the bull market, some crypto friend of you will tell you a bankless listener, you're so lucky. I wish that I bought too. And then the crypto market will go down and be like, you're an idiot. I told you crypto was a scam. Yeah. Especially when they say the words like disappointing.
00:13:01.890 - 00:13:09.446, Speaker A: It's like such an emotional word. It's like kind of just playing into the readership. I don't know if Morgan is about that mean.
00:13:09.468 - 00:13:27.870, Speaker B: That's where we're in the stage of the cycle where everyone thinks you're an idiot and they told you it was a scam. And you can't talk about crypto at your family events or parties because you're just the crypto moron who knows nothing and ha SBF FTX. That's so stupid. Scams frauds NFTs are such a joke.
00:13:28.210 - 00:13:31.360, Speaker A: Granted, some of those things are actually true, sure.
00:13:33.090 - 00:13:36.690, Speaker B: But if you're still in crypto and you know why you're here, right, and.
00:13:36.760 - 00:13:38.466, Speaker A: You'Re no longer buying the scams because.
00:13:38.488 - 00:13:49.410, Speaker B: You can identifying them, and then you'll swing back to like, I am a genius, I am amazing, I am lucky. Or third parties will say you're lucky when that happens and you'll feel like genius.
00:13:49.770 - 00:13:53.286, Speaker A: You've been chewing glass for three years. But you got lucky though.
00:13:53.388 - 00:14:00.540, Speaker B: You got lucky. How about the bitcoin ETF? David. Here's a tweet from James Safert. What's this about?
00:14:00.990 - 00:14:23.614, Speaker A: He just says that the SEC has come out super early and delayed the Ark Invest and 21 shares bitcoin ETF filing. There wasn't a decision due until November 11, and typically up until recently, the SEC has always gone up right up until the buzzer. But they decided to delay their decision on this earlier than usual. You know why?
00:14:23.652 - 00:14:29.426, Speaker B: Partially it's some of the speculation it's because the government's about to shut down. The US government's about to shut down.
00:14:29.528 - 00:14:31.230, Speaker A: That's on Monday, right? On Monday.
00:14:31.310 - 00:15:00.602, Speaker B: Yeah. So apparently, if by Sunday night, this Sunday night, congress doesn't reach some sort of compromise resolution, whatever agreement to keep the government running, then it shuts down yet again. I mean, how many times have we been through this? And so this is the SEC just getting ahead of that so that the stuff doesn't expire while the government shut down. And I guess I don't know what would happen if the government shut down and these deadlines were missed, but maybe they would de facto be approved. I think that could be how it works.
00:15:00.736 - 00:15:09.114, Speaker A: Some sort of pseudo oracle about how the SEC thinks that if we do go for a shutdown, we'll get shut down all the way until at least November 11.
00:15:09.162 - 00:15:27.126, Speaker B: I have no idea. I have no idea what this could mean. I do know this is good news. So Congress, both Democrats and Republican lawmakers, sent a letter to Gary Gensler pleading that he approve a spot bitcoin ETF. Okay, I'm not even sure I would.
00:15:27.148 - 00:15:36.790, Speaker A: Use the word pleading. The first line in this article, in this letter says, we write to ensure the SEC does not continue to discriminate.
00:15:38.570 - 00:15:39.942, Speaker B: We're not begging him.
00:15:40.076 - 00:15:41.094, Speaker A: We hired him.
00:15:41.212 - 00:15:42.966, Speaker B: That's the thing. He's not our king.
00:15:42.998 - 00:15:43.194, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:43.232 - 00:15:49.306, Speaker B: I always forget this. He actually works for us and the people. He's part of the executive branch, but.
00:15:49.328 - 00:15:51.998, Speaker A: He works for the people that's us.
00:15:52.084 - 00:16:23.810, Speaker B: And Congress can rein him in. He operates under their legislation. And they said in this letter, following the Court of Appeals decision, there's no reason to continue to deny such applications under inconsistent and discriminatory standards. So that's Congress's take and we're going to see a bit of the grilling that Gary takes in front of Congress in the next section. But one other thing this could mean, actually, David, is ether futures ETFs could be trading as early as Tuesday. This is all part of this government shutdown.
00:16:23.890 - 00:16:26.550, Speaker A: Oh, we need to keep the government open until Tuesday?
00:16:27.370 - 00:16:49.102, Speaker B: Well, the SEC is looking to speed things up in order to get it done before the looming shutdown. Okay, so they might actually approve it. If they were going to approve it anyway, then they'll just approve it before the government shuts down. So that could happen. So there could be a world where we actually have ETH futures trading on Tuesday. We'll be talking about that next week if we do.
00:16:49.236 - 00:17:00.062, Speaker A: Fun fact, the crypto volume. Crypto volumes are heavily favored towards futures as soon as futures have ever come about. So the ether futures, that's a big unlock.
00:17:00.206 - 00:17:09.762, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, you think it's a good thing or bad thing? There's always that debate of whether when you have kind of big liquidity unlocks, whether people just hit sell or people hit buy or what happens in the short.
00:17:09.816 - 00:17:21.050, Speaker A: Right, okay, so why do people think that? Well, we got bitcoin futures ETF at the top of the market in 2017, and then we just proceeded to dump for twelve months. That was just a coincidence of the timing.
00:17:21.950 - 00:17:26.380, Speaker B: I think it's just going to either do nothing or just amplify the trend that's already happening.
00:17:26.990 - 00:17:37.722, Speaker A: More liquidity is bullish, and it's even more bullish when prices are low and liquidity is low. Like when you add liquidity to a low liquid market, prices go up fundamentally.
00:17:37.866 - 00:17:40.282, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, what's coming up next, David?
00:17:40.346 - 00:17:57.618, Speaker A: Coming up next, Gary gets grilled in front of Congress again. We've clipped out some of the best moments so we can just all have our shot in Freud. Meanwhile, crypto bites back at the same time. Coinbase leads with their hashtag. Stand with Crypto day at Capitol Hill. So we got some pictures and coverage around that. Kevin Owalki gave some great takes.
00:17:57.618 - 00:18:16.598, Speaker A: A lot of friends and family were all out there. Penguins are in, walmart push you. Penguins lands a big deal with Walmart. We'll talk about the nuances and details behind that as well. All of this coming up more. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible, especially Kraken, a preferred Crypto exchange in 2023.

00:18:52.134 - 00:19:12.102, Speaker A: to get started. Today cello is the mobile first EVM compatible carbon negative blockchain built for the real world. And now something big is happening. Introducing the Cello layer two. It's a game changing proposal that's going to bring cello's rapidly growing ecosystem home to ethereum. Vitalik has shared its excitement for the Cello Layer Two on the Cello forum. So has Ben Jones from Optimism.
00:19:12.102 - 00:19:39.682, Speaker A: But why the Cello Layer Two will bring huge advantages, like a decentralized sequencer offchain data availability and one block finality. What does all that mean? Rock solid security, a trustless bridge to Ethereum and more real world use. Cases for ethereum without compromise. And real world adoption is happening. Active addresses on Sello have grown over 500% in the last six months. With the Cello layer two, gas fees will stay low and you can even pay for gas using ERC 20 tokens. But Cello is a community governed protocol.
00:19:39.682 - 00:19:50.238, Speaker A: This means that Cello needs you to weigh in and make your voice heard. Join the conversation in the Cello Forum, follow@cello.org on Twitter and visit sello.org to shape the future of Ethereum.
00:19:50.434 - 00:20:25.282, Speaker B: Gary Gensler under pressure this week in front of Congress. He was grilled. I would say we got some clips coming up, but he testified before the House Financial Services Committee. And Republicans, I would say, are increasingly apoplectic about the more than 40 rules Gensler has been proposing lately, especially now that the market is adopting them. And he's been blamed for kneecapping US capital markets. And some of the discussion was actually about crypto as well. And some guests made some appearances, particularly some pro crypto legislators, asking some questions of Mr.
00:20:25.282 - 00:20:42.922, Speaker B: Gensler. David, you actually did this for us. You live streamed this whole entire event and you helped curate the clips that we're about to watch. What were your takes as you were watching this event unfold? Is it just like watching C Span? Is it so there?
00:20:42.976 - 00:21:11.794, Speaker A: So everyone in the Senate Finance, the House Finance Committee gets to have their, like, five minutes where they just talk and they ask questions. And so there's a wide variety of subjects. There was actually before we get into the crypto stuff, there was a lot of focus on climate change and capital markets around climate change. And it just seemed so contrived. I was really frustrated because all the people that were bringing up climate change, they couldn't connect it to the SEC in any way. I'm like, why?
00:21:11.992 - 00:21:13.646, Speaker B: They just wanted to talk about climate.
00:21:13.678 - 00:21:15.954, Speaker A: Change kind of a little bit.
00:21:15.992 - 00:21:17.166, Speaker B: It was a little bit forced.
00:21:17.358 - 00:22:03.210, Speaker A: At least it felt forced to me. So it starts off with Pat McHenry, who always starts these things off. This is the second time we've done this, so I've seen this kind of rodeo for the second time now. So Patrick McHenry starts it off grills Gary Gensler because he's a pro crypto person. So it always starts off with a bang and then the baton is immediately passed to Maxine Waters, who dumped last scene Blowing kisses. She's just like, dousing water, like her last name on the whole thing, because Patrick McHenry starts off saying, I'm fed up and tired with Gary Gensler shenanigans. And then Maxine Waters goes, Well, I'm fed up and tired, with the opposite side of the aisle, and just immediately turns it into red verse blue.
00:22:03.210 - 00:22:16.454, Speaker A: And so there was a lot of red verse bluing about it. And so that was the start, and then it went into, like, 30 minutes of non crypto stuff. All the good stuff happened at the end, so you had to wait to the very end where let's play the good stuff. Warren pulled out. Wagner yeah.
00:22:16.492 - 00:22:19.240, Speaker B: All right. What are we about to watch? So I think the first clip is.
00:22:20.410 - 00:22:34.720, Speaker A: We'Re going to start with Patrick McKenna, because he starts the whole thing off in a fantastic bow tie. You've got serious questions to answer to the public and to Congress, and we intend to get your compliance. We can do it the easy way or the hard way.
00:22:35.170 - 00:22:35.946, Speaker B: Clint Eastwood.
00:22:35.978 - 00:22:40.160, Speaker A: I yield back. The ranking member is now recognized for five minutes.
00:22:40.930 - 00:22:42.814, Speaker B: Wow, that really sets the tone. Yes.
00:22:42.852 - 00:22:48.578, Speaker A: The ranking member is Maxine Waters. We're not going to play that because it's just dumb. We're only going to play the good stuff.
00:22:48.744 - 00:22:49.826, Speaker B: Who's this?
00:22:50.008 - 00:23:02.210, Speaker A: This is Mrs. Wagner. She is a big fan. I'm confused at which Gary Gensler, the American public should believe the academic version.
00:23:02.290 - 00:23:03.926, Speaker B: Who spoke glowingly about the power of.
00:23:03.948 - 00:23:06.870, Speaker A: Technology to help more investors MIT Gary.
00:23:07.470 - 00:23:10.794, Speaker B: And global capital markets or the SEC.
00:23:10.912 - 00:23:21.642, Speaker A: Version, who apparently thinks all use of any technology by broker dealers and investment advisors is inherently conflicted and firms should.
00:23:21.776 - 00:23:24.498, Speaker B: Just stop using technology altogether.
00:23:24.694 - 00:23:28.190, Speaker A: Gensler, could you please briefly explain this.
00:23:28.260 - 00:23:29.706, Speaker B: Change in your views?
00:23:29.898 - 00:23:46.258, Speaker A: I thank you for the question. A clever question. It's the same Gary gensler. It's not my identical twin brother Rob, or anything. It's me. Wait, so this is how I found out that Gary Gensler has an identical twin brother. We don't have that clip in the agenda, but I feel like now we have to actually bring that.
00:23:46.344 - 00:23:50.786, Speaker B: No, no. Okay, we need to talk about this. So Gary Gensler actually has an identical twin brother.
00:23:50.898 - 00:23:56.390, Speaker A: We don't have that in the agenda, but we'll go and pause and go get the clip, and then we'll do this.
00:23:56.540 - 00:23:58.726, Speaker B: We need to hear more about first.
00:23:58.748 - 00:24:02.950, Speaker A: The lashing, and then we'll find that we'll talk about the Gary Gensler identical twin brother.
00:24:03.030 - 00:24:18.350, Speaker B: Okay. This was the best one, though. This is my favorite clip, maybe the clip of the year that I've seen from Representative Richie Torres, who's actually been on the Bankless podcast before. So let's play it. Suppose I were to purchase a Pokemon card. Would doing so constitute a security transaction?
00:24:19.650 - 00:24:25.774, Speaker A: You can purchase a Pokemon card. I don't know what the context is, but if you're just purchasing a Pokemon.
00:24:25.822 - 00:24:28.798, Speaker B: Card if I purchase a Pokemon card, is that a security transaction?
00:24:28.894 - 00:24:30.498, Speaker A: That's not a security okay.
00:24:30.664 - 00:24:39.554, Speaker B: If I were to purchase a tokenized Pokemon card on a digital exchange via a blockchain, is that a security transaction?
00:24:39.682 - 00:24:41.080, Speaker A: I'd have to know more.
00:24:41.450 - 00:24:48.178, Speaker B: Okay, so for you, the process of tokenization is what transforms a non security transaction into a security transaction.
00:24:48.274 - 00:24:52.306, Speaker A: Look, if the investor I thought you were technology neutral.
00:24:52.498 - 00:24:53.618, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:24:53.804 - 00:24:56.134, Speaker A: He asked the question, David, that we've.
00:24:56.182 - 00:25:00.902, Speaker B: Always wanted to ask. How about baseball cards? How about Pokemon cards and these securities?
00:25:01.046 - 00:25:21.854, Speaker A: So Ms. Wagner is like, yo, MIT version of Gary was pro blockchain, but SEC Gary is anti blockchain. And then Richie Torres is like, Yo, it's a Pokemon card of security. These people are listening to are like, these are our the power of crypto. Twitter is like getting into Congress because it's distilled logic.
00:25:21.902 - 00:25:45.674, Speaker B: I mean, Gary Gensler thinks that everything that is tokenized should be a security, and that is just an untenable position. That's an untenable position. He refuses to provide any clarity. We are not saying on the crypto side, we are not saying that tokenized things can't be securities. There are things that are tokenized that can be securities. We're not taking the binary. Every token is not a security.
00:25:45.674 - 00:26:06.802, Speaker B: He is taking the binary. Every token is a security. And he's got to defend that, and it's indefensible. Or else Pokemon cards and Magic the Gathering cards and Pogs and all of these things are securities. And it's so satisfying. Look, I know this is just, like, kind of showboating it's for the show.
00:26:06.856 - 00:26:08.210, Speaker A: This is a carnival for the show.
00:26:08.280 - 00:26:09.138, Speaker B: I know that.
00:26:09.224 - 00:26:28.146, Speaker A: But it's important because each representative is trying to give scaffolding for their constituents to rally behind. So even though nothing is getting done, we are just publicly gary is just having tomatoes thrown at him, and he's going to go home and shower it off. He's going to be totally fine. But the public these are scaffolding for the public to go around it's.
00:26:28.178 - 00:26:35.690, Speaker B: Also, I think this meme will spread, David. This clip is I've already seen it all over the place. It's spreading. Kind of like the best thing that we could expect.
00:26:35.760 - 00:26:42.122, Speaker A: That's the best outcome that we could like, we have memeable clips that are showing what a far scary gensler is.
00:26:42.256 - 00:26:45.760, Speaker B: Governing this country by meme. I guess that's what we're descending into here.
00:26:46.690 - 00:26:56.194, Speaker A: Okay, so did you see this? So in every one of these, the second time or third time that we've had these, gary gets a few minutes to speak. Like, he gets to say words.
00:26:56.312 - 00:26:57.246, Speaker B: Opening statements.
00:26:57.358 - 00:27:21.014, Speaker A: Opening statements. Someone in the back of the camera behind Gary pulled out the coinbase stand with crypto shield logo icon and was just, like, flashing it, like holding it there. In a different clip, you also see a stand with crypto bag. So, like, Gary, while he's saying his statements about how crypto is full of frauds, there's a bunch of stand with crypto icons, like, in the back. Great stuff.
00:27:21.052 - 00:27:25.622, Speaker B: Yeah. Ironically, by the way, that's an NFT, which Gary Gensler probably thinks that is an NFT.
00:27:25.686 - 00:27:27.322, Speaker A: You're totally right. I forgot about that.
00:27:27.456 - 00:27:33.802, Speaker B: And if you contrast it to remember 2017 Janet Yellen buy bitcoin. It's not the first time this has happened.
00:27:33.936 - 00:27:36.186, Speaker A: I interviewed that guy, by the way, on POV crypto.
00:27:36.218 - 00:27:37.422, Speaker B: Oh, the buy. Bitcoin guy.
00:27:37.476 - 00:27:38.414, Speaker A: Yeah, the buy bitcoin guy.
00:27:38.452 - 00:27:39.886, Speaker B: Why do you do that? What's this?
00:27:40.068 - 00:27:42.880, Speaker A: He's an urban guy. He's an urban guy.
00:27:43.570 - 00:28:02.582, Speaker B: Pretty passionate then. Okay, so that was the Gary Grilling in front of DC. And hopefully we get some clips, we get some memes, we get some arguments. We don't expect a lot to come from the lashing otherwise. Okay, we got to come back to the twin thing. So Gary Gensler has an identical twin. You have a video that proves this?
00:28:02.636 - 00:28:24.640, Speaker A: Yes, there's a video. This is Gary Gensler in MIT World talking about crypto, and he brings in his brother, identical twin brother Rob, who I think at the time is working at T. Row Price. Okay, so the person you see on your screen is Gary Gensler. Now watch closely because you might lose him because there's two of them.
00:28:25.490 - 00:28:26.750, Speaker B: This is Rob.
00:28:30.770 - 00:28:35.390, Speaker A: That's Gary. That's rob Gensler.
00:28:35.470 - 00:28:38.210, Speaker B: Oh, wow. Rob. Rob.
00:28:38.710 - 00:28:40.450, Speaker A: What the shit?
00:28:41.910 - 00:28:47.810, Speaker B: What do you think Rob thinks about crypto, David? Do you think he's like a big crypto fan? That'd be hard to go in public.
00:28:47.960 - 00:28:52.680, Speaker A: This is like Mr. Smith from The Matrix. There's like, two of them.
00:28:54.090 - 00:28:55.346, Speaker B: It's funny.
00:28:55.538 - 00:28:55.990, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:56.060 - 00:29:05.814, Speaker B: Didn't know about that. So big reveal nuts. Twin, identical brother that is maybe pro crypto. I want to meme that into existence.
00:29:05.942 - 00:29:09.974, Speaker A: We should get Rob on the podcast. There's a horcrux joke here somewhere.
00:29:10.022 - 00:29:18.158, Speaker B: Well, to fight these forces of genslerness in DC. Crypto showed up. Crypto showed up on Capitol Hill this week. So what are we looking at?
00:29:18.244 - 00:29:44.066, Speaker A: Coinbase has organized this Stand With Crypto Day, where just a bunch of crypto founders and leaders and policy advocates came to Capitol Hill to advocate for crypto. Conveniently at the same time that Gensler was in his hearing. Coincidence? I think not. So 50 plus founders from over 15 different states all visited DC. And so this was not just like people visiting. This was a big push. This was a policy and advocacy push.
00:29:44.066 - 00:29:48.530, Speaker A: Here is Brian Armstrong on Yahoo Finance getting interviewed. I thought it was a great little clip.
00:29:48.690 - 00:29:49.014, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:49.052 - 00:30:15.422, Speaker C: So Stand With Crypto is here to tell people that 52 million Americans have now used crypto. That's three X, the number that own electric vehicles. It's more than hold union cars in the United States. It's a massive constituency. And they're frankly a little unhappy with the US. Because the US is lagging behind. We don't have clear rules on the books, like 83% of the rest of the G 20 countries for how crypto should be regulated, how consumers should be protected, and how this innovation can happen here in the US.
00:30:15.422 - 00:30:37.000, Speaker C: And so there's a couple of bills going through the house right now that have bipartisan support for how we get clear market structure, how we get stable coins in the US. And these entrepreneurs and the 52 million Americans really want this to happen. And so we're here talking about stand with Crypto. We've got the pins people can check out Standwithcrypto.org and sign up if they want to be a crypto advocate. This is something America needs to get right.
00:30:38.970 - 00:30:51.226, Speaker A: Are the shields the shield pins? Yeah. And he's got these talking points absolutely rehearsed comparing them to other constituents that people totally can resonate with and vibe with on an emotional level, which is the right way to do this.
00:30:51.408 - 00:31:15.934, Speaker B: Yeah, it's actually pretty cool. Brian also said this. I guess maybe he gave a speech on a panel, at least a statement on a panel, and he talks about Hayden Adams, the entrepreneurs, as he was referencing in that clip. Hayden Adams of Uniswap is an American hero. And I mean that literally. He's the kind of person that any country in the world would kill to have building the future of technology. And Elizabeth Warren called him a shadowy supercoder.
00:31:15.934 - 00:31:34.070, Speaker B: He actually put that on his Twitter profile as a badge of honor. If that's what it means to be an innovator in this country, then I'm a shadowy supercoder, too. And it's despicable that anyone keeps attacking American heroes like this who are helping propel our economy and our freedom and the future of this country forward. That was a statement.
00:31:34.150 - 00:31:34.394, Speaker A: Great.
00:31:34.432 - 00:31:35.594, Speaker B: Brian Armstrong. Great. Pretty cool.
00:31:35.632 - 00:32:10.614, Speaker A: Great line. Of course, hayden Adams on Twitter says, thanks, Brian Armstrong thanks for the kind words. So glad we have you and Coinbase standing with DFI and fighting for the whole industry. Really. I think that is what this represented as a symbol. We have 50 plus founders showing up the day Gary Gensler is getting a hearing to go meet in a coordinated fashion with talking points and just, like, PR and press. And they had this armored car out there, this painted blue armored car that was all about hey, money doesn't need to be driven around in armored cars in the year 2023.
00:32:10.614 - 00:32:34.074, Speaker A: Let's upgrade the financial system. Saying that 87% of Americans would think that we should upgrade our financial system. And 52 million Americans own crypto. So there's obviously a wide base of support that is the facts that Coinbase is coming to Capitol Hill with. And overall, it just was the biggest show of force, a coordinated show of force, of support for crypto on Capitol Hill on a day where it counted more than most.
00:32:34.192 - 00:33:06.214, Speaker B: Yeah, that's real people, right? And one of the shadowy supercoders that showed up is our friend Kevin Owaki. He showed up in the Shadow Court, and this was actually a fantastic thread of his just takeaways, and I think we should read a few of them. So this was his experience. He's one of 40 founders invited to DC in the Stand with Crypto Day. And then he reiterates the stats that you just gave the first day of their session was watching Gary Gensler live. So they actually got to go into the congressional chambers and watch this live.
00:33:06.252 - 00:33:09.958, Speaker A: And Kevin, it kind of explains why there was a stand with crypto?
00:33:10.054 - 00:33:39.538, Speaker B: Yeah, somebody was in there. Who was it? And he said, while I found the hearing itself to be pretty toothless and that most congresspeople wanted mostly to get sound bites, that's what we saw a little bit. It's still nice to see that Gensler's prejudices against crypto are not shared by all of the legislative branch. And next they met with some of the congressional leaders. So Richie Torres, Mark Molinero, hakeem. Jeffries several more. And Kevin goes on some lines that.
00:33:39.544 - 00:33:51.318, Speaker A: We'Ll pull out here. Kevin Awakey says the White House doesn't like crypto, but no one really seems to know why. As far as I know, no one withstand with crypto was able to meet with the executive branch. Interesting.
00:33:51.404 - 00:33:52.994, Speaker B: So they're still not engaging in the executive?
00:33:53.042 - 00:34:04.234, Speaker A: Still not engaging, yeah. He says quote of the day was from Mike Novogratz, who is also there the extra legal debanking of crypto companies is the most UN American thing I've ever seen. Hard agree quote of the day?
00:34:04.272 - 00:34:04.762, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:04.896 - 00:34:42.278, Speaker A: He says this stank of SBF seems to have mostly lifted the Opportunists who use SBF and FTX implosion to advance their agenda last year have already played their hands already. Wow, nice. And then last thing I'll pull out here is Kevin says it was cool to sit shoulder to shoulder pushing for regulatory clarity with prominent crypto luminaries like Brian Armstrong, Ryan Selkis, Mike Novogratz, or Fred Arisom. And then of course, he finishes with the action item of call your Congressman. This is not just him saying, hey, you should do this. This is saying, hey, this is what is the most effective. This is the advice that I've gotten from people in Congress who I just talked to.
00:34:42.278 - 00:34:58.902, Speaker A: Call your congressman. If you don't know who or how to approach them, you can check out Coinbase's Guide at WW standwithcrypto.org. So that is your big action item bankless listener, literally for the week. Go to Standwithcrypto.org and just press the buttons and then call your Congressman.
00:34:58.966 - 00:35:14.450, Speaker B: Sorry, you might have to be US citizen for this one. So sorry dollar international users, but we're fighting know in America for this. For sure. David. Speaking of America, what's more American than walmart? And we got Pudgy Penguins on the shelves. What happened this week?
00:35:14.600 - 00:35:40.758, Speaker A: 2000 Walmart stores have put Pudgy Penguin stuffed animals on their shelves. So this was just a big co marketing push between Pudgy Penguins and Walmart. Walmart even tweeted out the Pudgy Penguins retweeted and showed added their own quote to the Pudgy Penguins animation about Pudgy penguins being in Walmart. I mean, this is probably the biggest distribution event for any NFT ever.
00:35:40.844 - 00:35:44.634, Speaker B: Can you describe what you're actually talking about? So you're not just talking about the NFTs, of course.
00:35:44.752 - 00:35:48.886, Speaker A: No. You're talking about stuffed stuffed animals.
00:35:48.918 - 00:35:49.114, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:49.152 - 00:35:50.730, Speaker A: Pudgy penguin, stuffed animals.
00:35:51.550 - 00:35:54.462, Speaker B: Oh my God, they're so cute. Do you have a pudgy penguin? David. Still?
00:35:54.516 - 00:36:02.590, Speaker A: No, I sold mine. I bought him the shit out of that I took a long bet on cool cats and sold Pudgies. And that was the wrong trade.
00:36:03.490 - 00:36:08.754, Speaker B: No cool cats at Walmart. Well, Pudgies was an interesting project because it got resold to somebody else, right?
00:36:08.792 - 00:36:36.650, Speaker A: Yeah. Right. So the founders sold it to this guy, Luca, who I think has just been doing absolutely I don't know if that's him, but, yeah, he's been doing just a killer job executing. He's coming from the old world of IP and just IP growth. So Pudgy penguin toys cost between $3 and $12, depending on the toy. Okay. The crazy thing about this is each toy has, I think, one of those RFID chips in there.
00:36:36.650 - 00:37:00.638, Speaker A: And so each toy has its own identity as an NFT on ZK Sync era, where people can build their forever Pudgy characters inside of the Pudgy world, their digital social platform. So minigames interact with others and then you get some certain traits. There's like this on chain component where every single stuffed animal has a life on ZkSync era. Big win for ZkSync Era. Really cool.
00:37:00.724 - 00:37:31.254, Speaker B: It's really cool altogether. I mean, we have an NFT that's redeemed for some sort of token representation on a layer two IRL verse, metaverse kind of connection. I love it. NFTs and Walmart is somehow fitting in the spare market. We are down bad. But actually, I'm incredibly bullish. I mean, the big potential for NFTs is really as kind of a brand, in some ways, a headless brand in some ways, like kind of a centralized lead brand.
00:37:31.254 - 00:37:35.786, Speaker B: So are you going to get one of these stuffed animals? Are they cute enough or are you just interested in the speculation aspect?
00:37:35.818 - 00:37:52.370, Speaker A: David, I'm not necessarily a collector of stuffed animals, but I do think there is some interesting dichotomy of crypto degens owning Pudgy penguins and then children thinking that's their favorite stuffed animal, because it is. That's a funny thing. I don't know.
00:37:52.520 - 00:38:00.630, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, there you go. Oh, look at this. Some of them are getting swept. So looks like it's not just for children. Looks like some of the NFT.
00:38:01.530 - 00:38:10.200, Speaker A: Well, this is Luca. This is the CEO of Pudgy Pancake. He's buying his own, probably. He probably put that on the company card. He's yield farming Pudgies right now.
00:38:10.650 - 00:38:12.278, Speaker B: All right, what do we got coming up next?
00:38:12.364 - 00:38:39.994, Speaker A: Coming up next, did you know there's like six forks of friendtech and it's all on different chains? We'll talk about all of them, but not really. We're just going to burn through those vitalik deepfakes and how we can stop them. And also, Chase Bank has banning crypto payments in the UK. Oof, not great, is why we go bankless, of course. So we're going to get to all of that and more. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible, especially MetaMask Portfolio.

00:40:29.100 - 00:40:54.960, Speaker B: Let's play it. All right, everyone remembers when I sold billions of shiba inu tokens back in the day? Do I regret it? Well, I didn't. That is, not until I heard about shib exchange. Shib exchange is pretty revolutionary in the crypto space. Making shiba inu the quote token is just genius. If I still had all those shiba inu tokens, I know exactly where I would take them. Let's fucking go.
00:40:54.960 - 00:40:59.150, Speaker B: Well, that is classic.
00:41:01.090 - 00:41:18.706, Speaker A: Oh, my God. The let's fucking go is the funniest way to end this thing. When I was watching it, it's like, yeah, I know Vitalik's mannerisms. I know that was manipulated a little bit, but, man, if you're not paying attention or if you don't know Vitalik, then, yeah, this guy just yeah.
00:41:18.728 - 00:41:19.250, Speaker B: What do you think?
00:41:19.320 - 00:41:19.742, Speaker A: Exchange.
00:41:19.806 - 00:41:22.470, Speaker B: What do you think that is out of ten? Like, the quality of this?
00:41:22.540 - 00:41:32.554, Speaker A: This is one of the best quality defakes I've seen in a while, because he's got relatively natural body movements, even though they're a little bit repetitive, like, the body movements are natural and the voice was close.
00:41:32.592 - 00:41:35.782, Speaker B: The voice is pretty good. It's not quite there, but it's close ish.
00:41:35.846 - 00:41:38.460, Speaker A: Vitalik will never, ever say, let's fucking go.
00:41:39.310 - 00:41:56.138, Speaker B: I mean, with a different script, I think I would give it like a seven or eight out of ten. Right. Whereas, like, a ten for me would be, like, indiscernible from somebody who's spent some time virtually with Vitalik. It would be indiscernible from that experience. And this is maybe a seven or eight, which these are going to be everywhere.
00:41:56.234 - 00:41:57.630, Speaker A: Good. These are pretty good clips.
00:41:57.710 - 00:42:15.430, Speaker B: I mean, so many bots on Twitter all over the place of just like, Vitalik is giving away free ETH. It's always been this way since 2016 onwards. Vitalik's given in free ETH. His image is going to be used in deepfakes in all sorts of ways. So what is the prevention for this? How do we fix this problem?
00:42:15.580 - 00:42:37.614, Speaker A: Well, of course, there's the Ethereum Attestation service, but that's not a quick fix. That is going to be years of infrastructure and building in progress. We have the tools, we just need maturation and development. The fix is that everyone just needs to know that the internet is not a safe place. And especially with the emergence of private keys and owning your own assets, the internet is very unsecure at this very moment.
00:42:37.732 - 00:42:55.222, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a lot of, like a lot of people want to steal your money. This was actually useful, too, on Twitter, the community notes. I've been looking at this more and more on Twitter. Readers added context. They thought people would want to know the video is a deep fake. So, yeah, that's good context to know. So be on your guard and we'll get back to that.
00:42:55.222 - 00:43:08.694, Speaker B: But hopefully something like Ethereum Attestation service will allow Vitalik to release Vitalik content signed with his private keys. And that is unforgivable. That is not fakeable. Whoever has his private keys can actually sign it.
00:43:08.732 - 00:43:27.690, Speaker A: Yeah. The bullcase for this is that actually every single bit of content will have some sort of attestation. And so weird, content will be missing the attestation. And so the idea is, like, eventually everything will have some sort of tag of inception, like, where did this come from? And content without that tag will be extremely sus.
00:43:27.850 - 00:43:37.986, Speaker B: Exactly. David, this is pretty cool. Experiment in Buenos Aires. Government ID coming to Ethereum again via ZkSync. What's this? Yeah.
00:43:38.008 - 00:44:21.082, Speaker A: So there's actually an interesting corollary. I mean, maybe I'm just making this up in my head, but like pudgy penguins, when you buy the stuffed animal, you have this NFT that has this digital identity on mean it's not anything to do with pudgy penguins. Or stuffed animals. But Buenos Aires, the government of Buenos Aires, which is, of course, part of the country of Argentina, but is also its own kind of like, city state. Buenos ari. Citizens will be able to download this wallet and claim essential personal documents, such as birth and marriage certificates, which are very important documents in Argentina for accessing social benefits using a digital wallet. So, like, self custody of your digital documents using a private key, using a wallet.
00:44:21.082 - 00:44:38.790, Speaker A: And so this is being also being used on ZkSync era. And so it's just a way for infrastructure of the nation, state, city, state sector of things, using public infrastructure to do things that they already need to do better. Pretty cool.
00:44:38.860 - 00:44:50.034, Speaker B: You could put anything in your wallet. Penguins are passports, right? Penguins are passports. Yeah. This is cool. Kraken our number one recommended exchange for 2023. David, do you know what they're up to?
00:44:50.172 - 00:44:50.954, Speaker A: Tell me.
00:44:51.072 - 00:44:54.134, Speaker B: They are getting ready to push into stock trading.
00:44:54.262 - 00:45:23.150, Speaker A: This is a rumor. So I took this tweet from Walter Bloomberg crypto exchange plans to push into stock trading. This came from the Bloomberg article that says, this still a rumor. I asked Kraken, like, Yo, what's going on with this? And their response is, kraken is always exploring how it can power the global adoption of cryptocurrencies. We can't comment on rumors or speculation. We're looking to broaden and enhance our offering. So clients continue to have secure and seamless access to Kraken's full product suite.
00:45:23.150 - 00:45:26.558, Speaker A: Pretty generic. Neither confirm nor deny.
00:45:26.654 - 00:45:27.860, Speaker B: I would say no.
00:45:28.870 - 00:45:30.126, Speaker A: They did not say no.
00:45:30.248 - 00:45:36.854, Speaker B: We have no special knowledge about this. All we know is basically that statement. But this would be cool if true.
00:45:36.972 - 00:46:07.466, Speaker A: I would say, as someone who has not bought an equity and a stock since 2018, up until this week. Actually, we'll talk about that later in a different show. Robinhood. Ever since, we always thought Robinhood was, like, the app for the people, right? Like democratizing, access to finance, and then the whole Citadel GME thing just totally popped that bubble. One of the big reasons why I haven't bought an equity is because I don't want to use Robinhood. That's TradFi. There is demand, believe it or not, for crypto people to buy equity.
00:46:07.498 - 00:46:09.106, Speaker B: No, I believe it, but we just.
00:46:09.128 - 00:46:12.354, Speaker A: Need a crypto native platform to go back to the old world.
00:46:12.392 - 00:46:17.586, Speaker B: And Robin Hood has good UX. Have you ever used something like ETrade or ever used something like Fidelity or something?
00:46:17.768 - 00:46:19.506, Speaker A: Charles Schwab? No way.
00:46:19.608 - 00:46:22.514, Speaker B: You couldn't. You would not be able to navigate.
00:46:22.562 - 00:46:23.542, Speaker A: I wouldn't know how to do it.
00:46:23.596 - 00:46:34.278, Speaker B: It's so stupid. It's so like, 2000s era and crypto exchanges have gotten the UX, right? It's easy to navigate. And so why not start listing other assets?
00:46:34.374 - 00:46:38.682, Speaker A: Take Kraken Pro UX and put it into equities and we can talk.
00:46:38.736 - 00:46:41.834, Speaker B: Maybe Kraken's doing that maybe they're not. We have nothing.
00:46:41.872 - 00:46:43.814, Speaker A: Maybe it's a rumor. Yeah, it could just be a rumor.
00:46:43.942 - 00:46:56.178, Speaker B: A friend tech fork for every chain. Okay, there are all of these friend tech clones. We expected this would happen, right? Of course, a successful app is going to have like thousands of clones. What specifically is happening? How many clones do we have at this point?
00:46:56.264 - 00:47:10.674, Speaker A: Okay, so on base, there's friends tech, there's post tech. On Arbitrum. There's frenzy on salana. There's fan tech. On mantle, there's alpha on bitcoin. What the bitcoin?
00:47:10.802 - 00:47:12.902, Speaker B: What's bitcoin? L three. That's what this says.
00:47:12.956 - 00:47:22.682, Speaker A: I don't know, people have been trying to tweet at me saying, hey, David, you're really popular on Alpha, on Bitcoin, you should sign up. And I'm like, I don't believe you. No one is in the bitcoin world.
00:47:22.736 - 00:47:53.246, Speaker B: They're trying to steal your private keys, David. They're fishing you. Maybe. Of course these are clones, so there's not a lot of difference, but there is some minor innovation. So one version of this clone is introducing a bidding action for new accounts in order to prevent bots. Another is including features like public and private posts. So you could see accounts you could follow on Twitter, dark mode, stats mode, that sort of thing, referral systems.
00:47:53.246 - 00:48:29.230, Speaker B: So some are even working through the economics of these platforms and juicing them, making them maybe even more ponzi like in the games. So there's like these micro innovations that are happening across all of these clones and I think that this will push things forward is the optimistic view is some of these features will work, others won't. The ones that don't fall by the wayside and die, the ones that do, will improve the product. Friendtech will continue to have to level up. Fortunes will be made, fortunes will be lost. That's what always happens in this space. But I do think a lot of experiments will kind of level us up.
00:48:29.230 - 00:48:50.466, Speaker B: I guess maybe the bear case for all of this is like, it's too much fragmentation and we're just chasing a bunch of kind of nothing products and this is instead of innovating, everyone's copying the other apps. I guess you could take a bear case on it too, but yeah, overall I think it's cool. And of course it would happen. This is crypto, it's completely permissionless.
00:48:50.578 - 00:49:08.854, Speaker A: Well, as soon as you do get the forking phenomenon, it is just a big plus one to the legitimacy of the actual inception. Bitcoin had the fork and fair launch era. There's the ICO mania after ethereum DeFi food farms. Like anytime something gets forked a bajillion times, whatever is getting forked successful, it's.
00:49:08.902 - 00:49:12.022, Speaker B: Very successful in some measure, I will say.
00:49:12.096 - 00:49:23.614, Speaker A: Even though I don't really understand the long term economics and the long term sustainability of friend tech, it doesn't care what I think, it is still alive. And so I'll give a plus one to that.
00:49:23.652 - 00:49:28.162, Speaker B: I am too exhausted to create accounts in all of these apps and try them all out. I've got my friend tech that's it.
00:49:28.216 - 00:49:38.710, Speaker A: Coming out of the op stack superchain base world. Base has introduced Pessimism, which is an open source monitoring system designed to enhance security of base.
00:49:38.860 - 00:49:42.070, Speaker B: Hilariously named as well, of course not optimism.
00:49:43.210 - 00:50:08.238, Speaker A: It's the right way to view this. It's a monitoring system for like think of it as like a second line of defense. So post someone attempting to exploit you, whatever that means. Smart contracts, the actual protocol, et cetera. This is an alert system after that fact. So there's like three different subsystems here. There's like a risk engine alerting system and then just another system that's responsible for parsing and transforming real time data.
00:50:08.238 - 00:50:15.594, Speaker A: Basically trying to give you alive alerts of like, hey, some shenanigans is going on and it's just a monitoring system.
00:50:15.732 - 00:50:18.130, Speaker B: All op stack chains can benefit from this, right?
00:50:18.200 - 00:50:40.406, Speaker A: That's a really cool thing. This is kind of like it has previously been deployed in other contexts. We've seen other projects like this. But the cool thing about this is base is building this to protect the Base chain for their base users. It's just like extra protection for all base users. And it's really important because that's coinbase. But since it's on the op stack, all op stack chains can also leverage this open source system.
00:50:40.406 - 00:50:45.226, Speaker A: So this is about everything growing in security all at once. We like it. We like it.
00:50:45.248 - 00:50:56.026, Speaker B: Binance is interesting. Speaking of Base, binance is now supporting Base as well. So you can withdraw a deposit from Binance to Base. I wonder if that has any implications for the future of BNB chain.
00:50:56.058 - 00:51:05.946, Speaker A: David right, that's the big question is, like, now with Base, the BNB chain of the west, if you will. What is the future of BNB chain? It's always do you think BNB chain.
00:51:05.978 - 00:51:07.826, Speaker B: Just becomes a roll up at some point?
00:51:08.008 - 00:51:09.220, Speaker A: I can only hope.
00:51:09.590 - 00:51:12.478, Speaker B: Why be a side chain in this economy?
00:51:12.574 - 00:51:15.310, Speaker A: Why be a silo when you could join in the crowd?
00:51:15.470 - 00:51:39.290, Speaker B: This is a Fred Wilson post. Fred Wilson is a notable venture capitalist. Union Square Ventures. I followed his blog post for a while. I just noticed this week on September 9, he's writing on the 27th. But on September 9, apparently he was the victim of a phishing attack. So he got over 40 of his NFTs stolen some of his most valuable NFTs, 46 to be exact.
00:51:39.290 - 00:51:59.406, Speaker B: And it was because I believe he was in a crypto wallet. He doesn't mention the wallet, but I'm guessing it was probably like a coinbase wallet. He received a message, maybe a message from Xmtp telling him to click this link. He said this while waiting for our luggage. I got a push notification. I guess he was at the airport, so distracted, you know, waiting for your luggage. You just got a few minutes on your phone in my wallet.
00:51:59.406 - 00:52:22.518, Speaker B: About an NFT drop that I could participate in. So I clicked the link, signed the transaction, and nothing happened. So I tried again. Again, nothing happened. Frustrated, I turned my attention to the luggage, retrieved it and got in the car. On the way home, I tried again a few more times. Turns out that each of my failed attempts to mint an NFT was a scam that allowed a thief to eventually take 46 of my most valuable NFTs.
00:52:22.518 - 00:52:34.766, Speaker B: David, we were just talking about this last week with Mark Cuban getting drained from a similar kind of phishing scam. It's unfortunate. Yeah. Do you have a take on this? There is some good news at the end, but do you have a take on this?
00:52:34.788 - 00:52:45.140, Speaker A: First, I have two takes. One is that you should not be having your wallet with 46 of your most valuable NFTs be your mobile wallet that you have on your phone.
00:52:46.470 - 00:52:49.810, Speaker B: If you do that right now, stop doing that immediately.
00:52:50.230 - 00:52:53.502, Speaker A: Don't sign things that are also ought to be your cold storage.
00:52:53.566 - 00:53:00.486, Speaker B: Yes. Have your cold storage a separate wallet completely from your active wallet that you do this kind of activity on.
00:53:00.588 - 00:53:09.126, Speaker A: My other take is that we should be able to sign messages with our cold storage and not get rugged. We should do both.
00:53:09.308 - 00:53:10.790, Speaker B: Well, how do we do the second?
00:53:10.860 - 00:53:21.178, Speaker A: There that call for startups. Yeah, actually, Delegate Cash Fubar's project is working on this, but still, there are.
00:53:21.184 - 00:53:36.030, Speaker B: A number of attempts. It's something we definitely have to solve because this is not good user experience to get drained of all of your funds because you clicked the wrong link anyway. And by the way, just the PSA is even the pros can get the pros rugged like this.
00:53:36.100 - 00:53:36.682, Speaker A: Even the pros.
00:53:36.746 - 00:53:49.480, Speaker B: Actually, Anthony Cisano had a similar event that he talked about in the Daily Gwai earlier this week. If it can happen to someone like Fred or Anthony, it can happen to anybody. David, what did Michael Saylor do last week?
00:53:49.930 - 00:53:58.434, Speaker A: What does Michael saylor do every week? Ryan he purchases bitcoin. Also, all that bitcoin ether strength ratio. That was because Michael Saylor was buying a bunch of bitcoin.
00:53:58.482 - 00:53:59.142, Speaker B: Oh, really?
00:53:59.276 - 00:54:13.406, Speaker A: Purchased? Yeah. This has happened, like, three times now. Like, bitcoin ether shows strength. And then it was sailor purchased 5445 bitcoin for almost $150,000,000. Where does he get all this money?
00:54:13.508 - 00:54:16.970, Speaker B: Wait, he just spent another 150,000,000 on bitcoin?
00:54:17.130 - 00:54:19.742, Speaker A: Yes, that's exactly right.
00:54:19.796 - 00:54:22.090, Speaker B: He's borrowing it from bondholders.
00:54:22.170 - 00:54:33.666, Speaker A: Yeah, but everyone runs out of capital. If you run out of capital sure, you take leverage and then sometimes you run out of margin. Anyways, he's at zero point 75% of the 21 million.
00:54:33.768 - 00:54:37.302, Speaker B: He almost owns one full percent over.
00:54:37.356 - 00:54:44.118, Speaker A: Three quarters of 1%. Yeah. He is down 8% in dollar terms on his bitcoin buy.
00:54:44.284 - 00:54:52.010, Speaker B: He is so tenacious about this, it's impressive. And I've always said I think he'll do well on it eventually.
00:54:52.590 - 00:55:00.134, Speaker A: So he has bought a total of $4.7 billion of bitcoin. And that is currently worth $4.3 billion of Bitcoin.
00:55:00.262 - 00:55:04.800, Speaker B: David Chase bank is banning crypto payments. Why? What's going on?
00:55:05.330 - 00:55:19.294, Speaker A: Why? I don't know. They just say our policy around crypto is changing. Here's what it means for you. If we think you're making a payment related to crypto assets, we'll decline it. But customers are free to use a different bank or provider to invest in crypto.
00:55:19.342 - 00:55:30.306, Speaker B: That's called being just. Wow. I got one of these letters from bank of America one time with one of my accounts that just saw me transferring into Coinbase and they sent me a letter and they said, you're too risky. Bye.
00:55:30.418 - 00:55:52.286, Speaker A: Right. They say, here's why they do it. Fraudsters are increasingly using crypto assets to steal large sums of money from people. We're committed to helping keep our customers money safe and secure. So they're saying that because people are losing money in crypto that they're not going to let you buy crypto. Which the evidence is that, yes, people are sadly being fished all the time. We have been talking about this.
00:55:52.286 - 00:55:57.934, Speaker A: Does that mean that you just close down the gates to buying crypto? That's a reach.
00:55:58.052 - 00:56:34.058, Speaker B: I also think that this is maybe Operation Choke Point hitting the UK. The same kind of effect here of big bank saying, no, if you're dealing in crypto, we will unbank you. Back to the Novogratz Tweet earlier in this episode right. Of companies getting unbanked as a result of this. David, another Ethereum address was just added to the Ofact sanction list, this time, the Sinaloa cartel. This is a fentanyl trafficking operation in a Colombian cartel leader, apparently so added to the OFAC sanction list. I don't think that this is going to stop by the course.
00:56:34.058 - 00:56:53.134, Speaker B: Bankless is no friend of drug cartels, you'll know that. But it does set a bad precedent, I think, if this is not handled correctly. This is actually a GitHub maintained by ultrasound money of all addresses, ethereum addresses that are on the OFAC sanction list. You see this?
00:56:53.252 - 00:56:54.386, Speaker A: 21 of them.
00:56:54.488 - 00:56:56.834, Speaker B: Yeah. 21 of them. 21.
00:56:56.872 - 00:56:58.062, Speaker A: There's roman Seminov.
00:56:58.126 - 00:56:59.934, Speaker B: Roman Seminov addresses.
00:56:59.982 - 00:57:00.242, Speaker A: Wow.
00:57:00.296 - 00:57:33.362, Speaker B: 21 entities have been added to the OFAC sanction list right now. And I don't know, not a friend of drug cartels, but am worried about this blacklist type of capability that the US scope is growing in scope. And I guess I have a few takes on this one. I don't think we're going to get out of this. I think they're going to continue to add bad guys to this list. Right. So that's going to be with us always, but I feel like we need to hold the line in some specific places.
00:57:33.362 - 00:58:17.158, Speaker B: One is they can't be sanctioning privacy smart contracts as they have with tornado cash. Right. It's a general purpose privacy tool. You can't add that to the OFAC sanction list, and I know we're battling that in the court system right now. I'm also worried about increased demands to AML KYC, all of DeFi, all front ends, and have them essentially have to check the OFAC Sanction list before they can serve up the DeFi in the user interface and the application. So I'm worried about this. I guess I would say I don't really have a solution other than there's got to be some places we hold the line here, and yeah, I don't know if you have any wisdom for this, David.
00:58:17.254 - 00:58:19.580, Speaker A: Do you ever think we'll see Banklist ETH on there?
00:58:20.030 - 00:58:25.486, Speaker B: Better not. Well, what are you doing? What are you doing with our private keys, man?
00:58:25.588 - 00:58:27.230, Speaker A: Nothing, bro. They're coming for me.
00:58:27.300 - 00:58:31.486, Speaker B: Well, it's fine when it's all bad guys on the list, I guess, right?
00:58:31.588 - 00:58:37.858, Speaker A: That's the point I'm making. When does Bankless narrative become enemy of the state?
00:58:37.944 - 00:58:53.666, Speaker B: Well, there's already some people who, I mean, I would certainly argue are not bad guys. Like a tornado. Cash is on this list. Roman Seminoff is on this list. Open source privacy developer. Eight addresses he has on this list. So that is not comforting, David.
00:58:53.666 - 00:58:55.542, Speaker B: We got a new wallet, though, onto brighter news.
00:58:55.596 - 00:59:15.726, Speaker A: What's this new browse extension out of the Rainbow wallet? Rainbow is definitely a beloved wallet in this space. I would say it's been a mobile wallet. They've been pioneering mobile, but now they are now entering the world of being a wallet extension. I'm actually doing a show with Mike from Rainbow on Friday. He's a local Williamsburg resident. We will still be doing it over.
00:59:15.828 - 00:59:16.958, Speaker B: Oh, you're not doing it in person?
00:59:17.044 - 00:59:20.990, Speaker A: Yeah, we have to do Share screen. It's a virtual product.
00:59:21.060 - 00:59:25.118, Speaker B: He's got to show you some stuff. I get it. How about raises of the week? David? What do we got?
00:59:25.204 - 00:59:47.314, Speaker A: One raise from Bankless Ventures out of this week. Again, this is the way that we do this. Whenever Bankless Ventures makes an investment, we talk about it here in the weekly roll up as the inception of a conflict of interest so y'all can know about it. And it also gives us a moment to explain why we invested in the raise. The raise this week is Phoenix. Phoenix, spelled with an F-F-H-E-N-I-X. This is privacy.
00:59:47.314 - 01:00:25.854, Speaker A: This is encryption and privacy on the blockchain. We're leading the charge of investing in more of these things because there needs to be more privacy because there needs to be more privacy in the world of crypto. So there's a $7.5 million seed round. It's dedicated to bring fully immorphic encryption to a layer two on ethereum, and overall, just pushing the frontier of Fhe, fully homomorphic encryption into the world of crypto. So this, I think, stands in contrast to ZK cryptography, which is the more commonly known form of privacy. Interestingly, privacy and scalability are actually two sides of the same coin.
01:00:25.854 - 01:00:56.638, Speaker A: So you get ZK rollups, which are hyperscalable, but you also get ZkZk roll ups like Aztec, which are private. This is a different strategy for producing privacy. Fully homomorphic encryption existed before crypto. It's just general cryptography, not cryptocurrency. But now we are imbuing it into a layer two for it to have fully encrypted data. So the way that ZK roll ups work, or ZK in general, is that you generate a proof off chain and then you put the proof on chain and then everyone's like, yeah, that's the correct proof. It checks out.
01:00:56.638 - 01:01:12.974, Speaker A: Fully homomorphic encryption operates differently. It's more just like all the data. All the state is parsable because all the state is present on chain. So it's a more rich state of data that's just encrypted.
01:01:13.022 - 01:01:16.966, Speaker B: So you can run compute on it when it's in its encrypted form.
01:01:17.068 - 01:01:36.010, Speaker A: Exactly, yes. So it's more composable because the state of things is all hosted locally on chain. It's all present and accounted for. It's just encrypted. And so more composability, more utility out of this kind of, say, a new approach, an alternative approach to the ZK space, potentially more scalable.
01:01:36.510 - 01:01:44.214, Speaker B: Well, we need more privacy solutions specifically on layer two. And last, fun fact, this was founded by two guys. And I mean that literally.
01:01:44.262 - 01:01:45.294, Speaker A: Damn it, I was going to give.
01:01:45.332 - 01:01:48.010, Speaker B: This joke ran you, David.
01:01:48.090 - 01:01:56.800, Speaker A: All of that stuff was interesting. But the real reason why we invested in this deal is because the two co founders are guy and guy.
01:01:58.930 - 01:02:04.034, Speaker B: It's just too good. If that's not bullish, I don't know what is. David, what do we have coming up next?
01:02:04.232 - 01:02:31.994, Speaker A: Coming up next, will ETFs push crypto values away? Are they coming to infiltrate and corrupt crypto? We'll talk about that. Also, another take. Are we at the peak ignorance of crypto? Are we in the peak ignorance phase of the market? I think possible. And then also, is Ethereum a technology absorbing black hole? There is, I think, seven takes this week. It's a whole entire section of this regular so good. They're all so good, so big takes section this week. So we're going to get to all of that and more.
01:02:31.994 - 01:03:33.162, Speaker A: But first, a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. The Mantle, formerly known as Bitdao, is the first Dowled web3 ecosystem, all built on top of Mantle's first core product, the Mantle Network, a brand new high performance ethereum layer two, built using the Op stack but uses eigen layer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer one. Not only does this reduce Mantle network's gas fees by 80%, but it also reduces gas fee volatility, providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications. The Mantle Treasury is one of the biggest Dow owned Treasuries, which is seeding an ecosystem of projects from all around the web3 space for Mantle. Mantle already has subcommunities from around web3 onboarded, like Game seven for web3 gaming and buybit for TVL and Liquidity and onram. So if you want to build on the Mantle network, mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone based funding to promising projects that help expand secure and decentralize mantle. If you want to get started working with the first Dowled Layer Two ecosystem, check out Mantle at mantle XYZ and follow them on Twitter at zero x mantle.
01:03:33.162 - 01:04:30.754, Speaker A: Arbitrum is accelerating the Web three landscape with a suite of secure ethereum scaling solutions. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One. With flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems, Arbitrum Nova is quickly becoming a Web Three gaming hub, and social DApps like Reddit are also calling Arbitrum home. And now Arbitrum Orbit allows you to use Arbitrum's Secure scaling technology to build your own layer three, giving you access to interoperable customizable permissions with dedicated throughput. Whether you are a developer, enterprise, or user, Arbitrum Orbit lets you take your project to new heights. All of these technologies leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible faster transaction speeds and significantly lower gas fees. So visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first app with Arbitrum Experience web Three development the way it was always meant to be secure, fast, cheap, and friction free.
01:04:30.872 - 01:04:58.294, Speaker B: Here's a question of the week from Bankless Citizen kiwidog when the Bitcoin and ETH ETFs are finally approved, are you worried that the wacky but value oriented crypto culture, which I love so much, is going to be overrun by a rush of new people who have large amounts of power in the existing system? David, are all these TradFi people going to erode the crypto values that make us special, make this whole thing decentralized, make this whole thing corruption resistant? Should we be worried about the ETFs from that perspective?
01:04:58.422 - 01:05:35.880, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually wrote a blurb about this in one of my Davis Takes articles. The last crypto cycle is here where I talked about Bitcoin ETFs and also Bitcoin, Ether, ETFs and also running through, getting regulatory clarity, like we are currently battling with regulators. We will get clarity one way or another. Eventually Bitcoin and ETFs will be approved. So there's this growing east of crypto, if you will, like the civilized, law abiding, regulated civilization of the east of crypto that is growing. We are watching that grow. Will we be able to retain the freedom of the west? I think by default, absolutely.
01:05:35.880 - 01:05:59.694, Speaker A: Because private keys are permissionless. Everything is a bearer asset. The west is the default in the world of crypto. The east has to be built. So that is actually an inverse in the historical corollary where people show up in the east. They're moving west to go away from Britain and the monarchy, and then they establish their own civilization. But then people keep on going west because they're inherently looking for freedom, always.
01:05:59.694 - 01:06:28.818, Speaker A: So as civilization is born, they keep going west. Crypto is the Wild West, and it always has been and always will be because we have freedom and private keys and power and responsibility and opportunity imbued into us by default. That is like the substrate that crypto exists upon. Will it be encroached? Well, with ETFs, people are buying Ether bitcoin through their ETFs, but they're staying in the Trad world. That capital is staying Trad, that's staying in Fidelity.
01:06:28.914 - 01:06:30.738, Speaker B: They're also buying a worse product.
01:06:30.924 - 01:06:51.034, Speaker A: Yes. And they're free to do that. And so actually, the line between TradFi and DeFi will definitely be retained. DeFi will just be the permissionless version of finance. And all that ETFs do is actually wraps ether, kind of like wrapped ether, but makes it composable inside of TradFi. But it actually is us. We're corrupting Wall Street.
01:06:51.034 - 01:06:52.302, Speaker A: They should be worried about us.
01:06:52.356 - 01:07:08.166, Speaker B: We're decentralizing them. Yeah, I know. I totally agree. I think this whole thing is one big Trojan horse and we got them. Yes, and I think that we've said this before, too. You can't build something decentralized on something centralized. Right.
01:07:08.166 - 01:07:37.678, Speaker B: But it's fine if you put something centralized on something decentralized so long as the base layer is preserved. Right. And that's why we are so passionate about the layer one and the layer zero, which is kind of the social community keeping those layers decentralized. All right. Our validator set matters so much, right. Making sure that the entire block building, searching, building, validating chain is corruption free and censorship resistant. Right.
01:07:37.678 - 01:07:50.500, Speaker B: That's the stuff that matters. So who cares what they build that's centralized on top of those layers, so long as those layers remain decentralized and corruption resistant and quote unquote pure. That's what we care the most about.
01:07:51.510 - 01:08:02.370, Speaker A: With the Ether ETFs, ether gets sucked up into TradFi, ETH price goes up, and they add jet fuel to the values that power up crypto.
01:08:02.450 - 01:08:14.150, Speaker B: Yep. When they adopt crypto protocols, they adopt crypto values. Turn that into a song. Chris Berninski eclipse is like a Solana embassy in Ethereum nation.
01:08:14.310 - 01:08:14.682, Speaker A: Wow.
01:08:14.736 - 01:08:19.290, Speaker B: This take from Chris Berninski. Give us some background on Eclipse first.
01:08:19.360 - 01:09:02.246, Speaker A: Right. So Eclipse is the predicted outcome, I think, of the Rollup Centric Roadmap thesis, which is that new and alternative non EVM execution environments can turn themselves into a layer two and settle on Ethereum and benefit from ethereum's network effects and composability and liquidity and assets. Eclipse, we did the show not too long ago. Eclipse is Solana virtual machine as a layer two. And so Chris is putting this into nation state metaphors, which I so wholly appreciate, and he's saying Eclipse is like a Solana embassy on the Ethereum nation. So like a little domicile for Solana on Ethereum. And he follows up and says, eclipse will further trade relations between two of crypto's major economies, cementing the importance of ETH and Seoul as a means of trade, production and consumption.
01:09:02.246 - 01:09:06.522, Speaker A: That is his take. That is Chris's Take.
01:09:06.576 - 01:09:08.586, Speaker B: I do agree with you. That is Chris's Take.
01:09:08.688 - 01:09:28.034, Speaker A: Yeah, you can see my take. My response to. Yeah, well, kind of. I said Omnom, nom, nom, nom, nom. Which is my version of saying Ethereum is just gobbling up solana. So it's not the Solana embassy coming to Ethereum, it's just Ethereum just absorbing it and digesting it.
01:09:28.072 - 01:09:44.706, Speaker B: Well, that brings us to the next take, which is this one from not you, but Swagtimist ETH. The beauty of Ethereum is that it's a technology absorbing black hole EVMs layer twos. Optimistic. Rollups, ZK. Rollups. Snarks starks SVM. That's the Salana virtual machine.
01:09:44.706 - 01:10:01.642, Speaker B: It doesn't matter. Everything ends up in Ethereum eventually. Ethereum's culture and draw is just too strong, and once you're caught up in it, there's no going back. So, embassy versus black hole. Two different analogies here for something similar. Yeah. Do you have anything to add to that?
01:10:01.696 - 01:10:28.210, Speaker A: So this one is SWAG's take, but it's also my take as well, because I 100% agree with this. I have my own version of this Tweet all the way back in 2019. You can understand this from first principles. Open source code aggregates better open source code pens onto better open source code. And Ethereum is a platform for open source code. And we've seen this play out before. Do you remember? EOS turned into Loom network? Well, neither of those ideas worked, so they both just died.
01:10:28.210 - 01:10:47.014, Speaker A: But zcash. That's Aztec on ethereum as a layer two. Like we have that technology. All of these things useful open source, cryptocurrency related code can just append onto Ethereum and then Ethereum grows. Sure, it's an embassy for now, but then it's just going to get gobbled.
01:10:47.062 - 01:11:15.010, Speaker B: Yeah. I think that the black hole analogy is good. I would also just use gravity. The gravitational pull analogy is good. And I would use like a star or a sun type of metaphor. If you are a layer one with a monetary unit and massive liquidity and massive economic bandwidth right, and a culture of innovation, then you're just going to suck in all of the other stellar objects towards you, right. And they're going to start orbiting you.
01:11:15.010 - 01:11:28.806, Speaker B: Right. And so the goal, this is the Bankless thesis, is to become the most massive star in your ecosystem. Maybe there'll be a binary star system, though. David that's what some others would say.
01:11:28.908 - 01:11:41.766, Speaker A: Binary star systems work when two equivalently sized stars within some range start, like having a dance with each other. But if there's an imbalance between these two stars, one just gobbles up the other bitcoin.
01:11:41.798 - 01:11:44.378, Speaker B: And Ethereum, is that a binary star system?
01:11:44.544 - 01:11:46.574, Speaker A: I would currently call that a binary star system.
01:11:46.612 - 01:12:08.926, Speaker B: Maybe we are stretching the metaphor too far, but this is another take from Brenner. We told you we got a lot this week. Given the concept of soulmate, there's probably a similar buildmate, someone where the two of you enjoy building or creating stuff together. The creations will be stellar and the two of you will have so much fun doing it. Oh, this is a sweet one who put this in the agenda. A build mate. Find your build mate.
01:12:08.926 - 01:12:10.066, Speaker B: You got your soulmate.
01:12:10.178 - 01:12:12.918, Speaker A: Yeah. It reminds me of the bear market buddy take.
01:12:13.004 - 01:12:13.206, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:12:13.228 - 01:12:16.642, Speaker A: Everything is just easier in Crypto when you have a buddy. Find your build mate.
01:12:16.786 - 01:12:20.022, Speaker B: This is very heartwarming. This is a good time to find your buildmate too.
01:12:20.076 - 01:12:21.682, Speaker A: Fun fact, I went to college with Bretter.
01:12:21.746 - 01:12:28.774, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, really? Yeah. I feel like you always say that every show. It's just like some I went to college for someone you went to college or, you know, this is what happens.
01:12:28.812 - 01:12:30.640, Speaker A: When you go outside. Ryan in.
01:12:32.450 - 01:12:34.506, Speaker B: All my friends are like virtual.
01:12:34.698 - 01:12:43.146, Speaker A: So this take requires some context. You know how we talk about blockchain fees are the taxes for the system, like the gas fees are the ethereum taxes that you pay for the protocol?
01:12:43.178 - 01:12:44.318, Speaker B: Yeah. They go to the public good of.
01:12:44.324 - 01:13:06.978, Speaker A: The protocol, fits the pattern. Right. But Dr member in here, I think provides an alternative perspective. He says, or they say, a tax is dictated top down. An auction means pricing is set bottom up. In other words, if they didn't want to pay that price, the gas fee, that wouldn't be the price. The only reason the price is that is because people are there are willing buyers.
01:13:06.978 - 01:13:22.138, Speaker A: So I think as we move forward and talk about I think we will continue to talk about gas fees are the tax to ethereum. But there's this important nuance that the taxes to ethereum are determined by the market, not by a top. Yeah, it's definitely heavy handed system.
01:13:22.224 - 01:13:28.990, Speaker B: A tax that's driven by market forces is how I put it. What's the context for this Tweet, though? It looks like it's.
01:13:29.730 - 01:13:32.480, Speaker A: I was arguing with solana people about.
01:13:33.330 - 01:13:35.482, Speaker B: High fees versus low fees kind of argument.
01:13:35.546 - 01:13:36.602, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah.
01:13:36.756 - 01:14:10.586, Speaker B: Got it. Vance Spencer tweet his second one of the episode. Wow. Big week for Vance. It is now clear that there is going to be ten to 100 restaking protocols and that the restaking game will increasingly become a hot ball of money. Why? It is unlikely that any one primitive data availability bridge oracle secured by restaked ETH will be able to meaningfully augment ETH layer one yield for the 23 million ETH and growing staked over a long period of time. Moving from one restaking protocol to another while their inflation is high will become the game.
01:14:10.586 - 01:14:42.214, Speaker B: All right, let's take us to this corner of the universe here in Crypto restaking. This is like Eigen layer. Help us recall. So restaking is first you stake it and then you restake it. And the reason you might restake it with a protocol like Eigen layer is so that you can get some additional yields and put that capital at risk in exchange for performing some other and get some other function and generate some other yields. So Vance is saying that this is going to be a hot ball of money and a game and there'll be many market participants. Yes.
01:14:42.214 - 01:14:42.614, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:14:42.652 - 01:14:46.518, Speaker A: So you remember how we were talking about all the friend tech clones that have spun up and forked out?
01:14:46.604 - 01:14:47.142, Speaker B: Yes.
01:14:47.276 - 01:15:31.906, Speaker A: How their bitcoin fork and Fair launch era the ICO food farms in 2020. There's just this pattern in crypto of first you have this one thing and then you have the explosion of other things that are all kind of iterations on that. The cool thing about eigen layer is that it's actually not just one thing. Eigen layer data availability is one restaking chain. I can't remember the name of it, but there's another Oracle chain, which is why the Oracle thing is an example here there's a bridge chain. There's many different use cases for eigen layer restaking networks. And so what he's saying is applying this phenomenon that we totally understand, where there's as soon as one thing is successful, you have the iterations and iterations and then you also have the liquidity locusts, the mercenary yield farmers of DeFi summer.
01:15:31.906 - 01:15:36.742, Speaker A: There's always going to be demand for a new restaking network because that's the pattern that we see.
01:15:36.796 - 01:15:41.546, Speaker B: Is he talking about there's going to be a ton of different eigen layers like restaking protocols or a ton of.
01:15:41.568 - 01:15:46.358, Speaker A: Different sort of eigen layer networks. Not eigen layers.
01:15:46.534 - 01:15:50.610, Speaker B: I see different protocols.
01:15:50.710 - 01:16:06.974, Speaker A: Right. He's not calling for a forking of eigen layer, he's calling for just a large supply of interested restaking capital that will produce demand for further restaking networks as the yields get sucked up by more and more people playing this game.
01:16:07.012 - 01:16:24.470, Speaker B: Well, I think this clarifies it. So in his next tweet he said, I think the winners here are the dominant ETH one Staking protocol. So that would be like a lido or rocket pool and generally ETH itself. People will get more comfortable using it, withdraw more sex ETH to on chain and continue bootstrapping the ETH monetary premium.
01:16:24.890 - 01:16:36.246, Speaker A: That has always been my thesis behind Eigen layer is that this just shifts power the pendulum from the many alt layer. One thesis to the ether is the capital of the internet.
01:16:36.438 - 01:16:47.678, Speaker B: It strengthens the ether's money thing and the kind of monetary game that all layer ones need to play. David, are we at peak ignorance of crypto? That's what this next take says. What are we looking at?
01:16:47.764 - 01:17:31.330, Speaker A: Yeah, so this is Ken Dieter, who tweets out this graphic, which I'll explain here in a second, and says, this is my mental model for comparing how crypto progresses through time to how people outside of crypto perceive that progress. So we got two lines here. One is a kind of stairsteppy upwards into the right green line. And so the stairsteps I think, kind of happen inverted to the market. So when there is a bull market, we hit a plateau because no one gets any fucking work done in a bull market because we're all gambling and it's raining money everywhere and everyone's distracted. And then that's the peak bull and then in the peak bear is when work actually gets done. But everyone thinks that crypto is totally dead.
01:17:31.330 - 01:17:50.242, Speaker A: And I actually appreciate this subtle nuance in this graphic that what crypto can actually do line. The stair stepping up into the right line is also accelerating because progress compounds. But meanwhile, what everyone thinks crypto can do is kind of sine oscillating around what crypto can actually do.
01:17:50.376 - 01:18:12.250, Speaker B: So the axes here are it's over time, but it's capabilities over time. Right. And so the green line signifies that what crypto can actually do is greater capabilities over time. That's actually happening. Right. It happens in kind of like different waves as we unlock various things. But what happens during bull markets is we overshoot the capabilities and we're like, it's the best thing ever.
01:18:12.250 - 01:18:32.590, Speaker B: It's going to change everything. You totally do. And then what happens during the bear markets is we're like, it's doomed, it's over. Crypto is good for nothing. It's just a bunch of Ponzi schemes and there's nothing that it's going to affect and we'll never go mainstream. Right. And would you say we're at peak bear right now?
01:18:32.740 - 01:18:38.034, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we're coming out of it actually, like the whole show of force from yeah.
01:18:38.072 - 01:18:44.770, Speaker B: What does that have to do with peak ignorance of crypto? Is he just saying, like, in the bear you are peak?
01:18:45.670 - 01:18:50.294, Speaker A: Like, no, none of your friends want to hear about the pudgy penguins in Walmart right now.
01:18:50.492 - 01:18:52.550, Speaker B: So that's where we are in the cycles. Peak.
01:18:53.610 - 01:18:54.470, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right.
01:18:54.540 - 01:18:58.550, Speaker B: Good name for the episode, peak ignorance. David, last take of the week. What's this one?
01:18:58.700 - 01:19:14.318, Speaker A: This is such a good one. This is a deep cut both for long term and newer listeners who don't know about these dynamics. Coinfessions is a Twitter account that just tweets out, like, statements from people. It's a meme account that tweets out statements from anonymous people.
01:19:14.404 - 01:19:15.486, Speaker B: Real statements, though?
01:19:15.588 - 01:19:39.480, Speaker A: Real statements that are submitted, yes. So the statement that was submitted to this Coinfession was, I was employed by a bitcoin mining company to spread negative information about Ethereum on Twitter and four chan for a duration of two years. Now, if you are a veteran, you understand exactly who this company is. It's called blockstream. They are the mining company. I mean, this is my take, this is my guess. I do not know this fact, but man, prove me wrong.
01:19:39.480 - 01:20:11.946, Speaker A: Here's another bit of information. My first boss in crypto was a bitcoin OG and converted to ethereum in the ICO mania, but also just disclosed to the entire company that him and a few of his bitcoin whale owning friends financed the subversion campaign of Ethereum from 2015. Bro and he just told us the whole entire company is like, yeah, we paid for FUD. We paid for the FUD of Ethereum.
01:20:11.978 - 01:20:20.302, Speaker B: Like the extra FUD on top of the dow hack and Ethereum classic and all of these things every time something negative went down, they just magnified it tenfold.
01:20:20.366 - 01:20:36.246, Speaker A: Yes. The ethereum is centralized. You can't run a node, like, just FUDding ethereum just because you could play that game. It was truly the Wild West back then. And so this coinfession is just like the blockstream employed. Just look.
01:20:36.268 - 01:20:36.406, Speaker B: Go.
01:20:36.428 - 01:21:02.234, Speaker A: Look at Grubles. If you remember Grubles Samson Mao. Like, if you want to listen to the most cringe piece of content ever, listen to Samson Mao from Blockstream and Vitalik. Buterin on what Bitcoin did that was so bad. I can't believe Vitalik did that. Anyways, these are the tactics that have existed and still exist. And I would say that I think that Brie has gone from Bitcoin like it's left its scar on the Bitcoin culture.
01:21:02.234 - 01:21:10.978, Speaker A: These tactics still exist. It still happens. This is still an alive, and it's probably higher up the market cap stack than you would think.
01:21:11.064 - 01:21:23.750, Speaker B: You have to curate your sources of information in this space because there's so much bad information out there or disinformation or pure FUD. It's no wonder it's so difficult to find your way in crypto, right?
01:21:23.820 - 01:21:31.442, Speaker A: People who are relentlessly on crypto, Twitter pushing narratives, all of the like that you should proceed with caution.
01:21:31.506 - 01:21:32.866, Speaker B: Unless they're podcasters. Right, David?
01:21:32.898 - 01:21:36.538, Speaker A: Unless they're podcasters. Unless not us. We wouldn't do these things.
01:21:36.624 - 01:21:41.334, Speaker B: Oh, my God. We didn't even mention BitBoys in jail right now, and that's fine. Didn't even make the agenda.
01:21:41.382 - 01:21:41.978, Speaker A: Yeah, I didn't want to.
01:21:41.984 - 01:21:44.942, Speaker B: Anyway, moving on. David, what are you bullish on this week?
01:21:45.076 - 01:22:04.402, Speaker A: Okay, there's this rabbit hole that I know exists that I've been trying to go down, and I've gotten, like, nibbles of it. I went to a meetup in New York that was like, 30 people. It kind of felt me. It felt like the ethereum meetups of old where folding chairs in this basement kind of looking thing. And everyone is there just because we're nerds looking at this stuff.
01:22:04.536 - 01:22:05.940, Speaker B: What are you nerding out about?
01:22:07.450 - 01:22:18.262, Speaker A: The words that we have described are Autonomous Worlds. This is being pioneered by Lattice zero X park. Guys. Mud. But there's just interest in who are these people?
01:22:18.316 - 01:22:24.726, Speaker B: Lattice Mud. I don't think I've heard, like, very skunkworky people. These are individual Twitter accounts.
01:22:24.838 - 01:22:54.078, Speaker A: Yeah. The Xerox Park guys are funded by grants, so they're just like the developers. Developers? Autonomous Worlds. It's like crypto gaming, but not like the crypto gaming that you know, fully as much logic on chain as possible, and so you get unique properties about that. Ryan. I think everyone understands when I say NFT, there's like, what's an NFT? It's like, oh, it's a crypto punk, it's a pudgy penguin, it's a collectible of some sort. It's a JPEG.
01:22:54.078 - 01:22:57.190, Speaker A: And maybe maybe the team adds some utility or access to that.
01:22:57.260 - 01:22:59.506, Speaker B: Sure. That is or a plushie toy.
01:22:59.538 - 01:23:33.126, Speaker A: In is exactly that is the Stone Age of what NFTs can be inert objects. That is like the first iteration. Kind of like. The bitcoin is the Stone Age of crypto. My take, ethereum is like the Sci-Fi version of this. We are in the Stone Age version of NFTs. What if I told you, Ryan, that an NFT could be a universe with specific laws of physics and specific types of property rights, internal property rights, and that universe is defined by an NFT, and that NFT is transferable?
01:23:33.258 - 01:23:42.020, Speaker B: One, I don't know entirely what you mean. Two, it sounds cool. Three, do I actually want that? I don't know.
01:23:43.750 - 01:24:05.738, Speaker A: When universes can become, like, again, with state internal state internal laws that are different from Ethereum and can have their own internal logic. And that is a transferable object we talked about in our Metaverse episode. What are NFTs they're digital objects. You know what's an object? A whole entire universe, bro.
01:24:05.904 - 01:24:39.214, Speaker B: It's funny you use the M word, the metaverse word, because that has so much fallen out of by the way, crypto started using that word before Zuckerberg took it over. That was and then he killed it anyway. It's dead, dead, dead now. But do you know that statement of basically, like, everything that the bulls predicted about crypto will come true? It's just a matter of timing, right? Same thing happened with the Internet. I feel like that's very much true. And this is basically that concept. It's property rights, digital property rights.
01:24:39.214 - 01:24:59.082, Speaker B: Autonomous worlds inside of what you're talking about. Another word for Autonomous worlds is like, metaverse. That's what you used to kind of call it. And are you saying you're seeing hints? You're seeing green shoots of growth, new growth in this autonomous world? How do I enter an autonomous world right now? Is there a game I play?
01:24:59.216 - 01:25:24.340, Speaker A: Yeah, there is. Maybe you'll resonate with this metaphor. Mud is like this game engine that the Mud team are building, this game called Skystripe. So that is the game that you actually see on screen built on Mud. And so they're kind of dog fooding their own game. Is this happening anytime soon? No, this needs years of iteration and development. Like, some of the more informed numbers I've gotten is like three plus years.
01:25:24.340 - 01:25:51.850, Speaker A: But there's a there there. And it's kind of one of the big pills that I remember taking way back when, when I realized that, yo, you can put any logic on chain. We just need to figure out how to compress it and make it finish, make it scalable. This is what they're doing. Mud is putting it's an on chain game universe engine, and people are trying to figure out how to make rich, vibrant, stateful universes inside of things like an NFT.
01:25:52.430 - 01:25:59.662, Speaker B: That's so cool. I think it's cool, and yet I still don't fully like I feel like in order to understand it, I think.
01:25:59.716 - 01:26:11.394, Speaker A: The TLDR is, why am I bullish on this? It's just one of many things that I think there is so much juice left in crypto to squeeze. Like, we are just tip of the iceberg. We can't even imagine some of the future stuff.
01:26:11.432 - 01:26:19.958, Speaker B: So you think we're going to sell all this cheap block space we're creating? Because I've been worried about that lately, David. We got real cheap block space, but maybe Autonomous Worlds will buy it all up from us.
01:26:20.044 - 01:26:22.518, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's right. Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:26:22.604 - 01:26:32.834, Speaker B: I am bullish on what we were talking about earlier, crypto people showing up in DC. And the good people this time. All right, guess who wasn't there? David Sam, bankman freed.
01:26:32.882 - 01:26:33.602, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, right.
01:26:33.676 - 01:27:01.234, Speaker B: All right. I mean, he was in jail. And I think that crypto has been a little late to the party with respect to participation in DC. But it's here now and some reasons it's been late to the party. I think most other industries would have been in DC lobbying from like, day one and participating in the way that crypto is from day one, but crypto didn't. And I think part of it comes from this core kind of libertarian governments are bad type of ethos. That's maybe one part of it.
01:27:01.234 - 01:27:20.610, Speaker B: Another is I think there are some builders in the space who are a bit more techno utopian. We're basically like, we don't have to play the lobby games like the old tribe did. If we build it, they will come. They'll see it's a better system, they'll just adopt it. Right. And then there's another element of why we haven't participated. We just really didn't have the use cases.
01:27:20.610 - 01:27:44.866, Speaker B: Like, what do you go to the US. Government and be like, yeah, we're going to supplant the dollar with this new cryptocurrency. They're not going to act very favorably to that. But now we have Stablecoins, for instance, now we have DeFi, now we have the creator economy with NFTs. But I think the realization crypto has had that if it doesn't show up in DC, if the good guys don't go to DC. Someone else will, someone like SBF. Right.
01:27:44.866 - 01:28:44.740, Speaker B: He really revealed that there's a power vacuum to fill and that if you're ambitious, if you're crafty, if you're short termist, if you're organized, then you can go fill that vacuum with political bribes to try to capture all of the entire regulatory apparatus and bend it to your will. Right. And so, anyway, I'm bullish that SBF is out and some of the good guys are in and actually playing this game in a good way, and that we're getting organized, that exchanges are there, that our lawyers are on top of things, that our educators and lobbyists are there, that our builders, like Kevin Owaki, earlier in this episode, showed up in DC. And I still feel like we have a massively, like, a very long fight in the know. We got to fight the IRS, we got to fight the SEC, the CFTC. The entire past year, the roll up, we have been talking about regulatory way more than I am comfortable. I hate talking about it every week, and yet that is the thing that we are fighting right now.
01:28:44.740 - 01:28:58.982, Speaker B: But I am bullish with kind of this new wave of progress and our participation there and channeling. We're just more aligned and organized than we ever have been. And I think we'll make real progress in the US. Even though it won't be easy.
01:28:59.116 - 01:29:12.966, Speaker A: Yeah. And I'm reminded about, I think, my favorite line out of permissionless, which was hester purse's quote, which is that the courts are on our side, the law is on our side. We just have to show up. And we actually haven't seen we haven't.
01:29:12.998 - 01:29:14.010, Speaker B: Even showed up yet.
01:29:14.080 - 01:29:16.942, Speaker A: Yeah. We haven't even seen what we can do when we show up.
01:29:16.996 - 01:29:17.646, Speaker B: 100%.
01:29:17.748 - 01:29:20.170, Speaker A: Yeah. So absolutely massive unlock.
01:29:20.330 - 01:29:21.902, Speaker B: David Meme of the Week, you ready for this?
01:29:21.956 - 01:29:23.380, Speaker A: Meme of the week? Yes.
01:29:23.910 - 01:29:24.850, Speaker B: What are we looking at?
01:29:24.920 - 01:29:44.530, Speaker A: This is 100% convinced that Ryan Sean Adams put this meme together. The quote is another unregistered securities exchange. Absolutely disgusting. And the picture is what looks like a middle school Pokemon competition with a nice young lady in a Pokemon suit.
01:29:44.690 - 01:29:47.382, Speaker B: Look at her trading her cards. Look at what's going on here.
01:29:47.436 - 01:29:49.330, Speaker A: Violating securities laws.
01:29:49.410 - 01:29:51.462, Speaker B: Absolutely. Lock these kids up.
01:29:51.596 - 01:29:53.770, Speaker A: I bet she's not even paying her taxes.
01:29:54.190 - 01:30:07.454, Speaker B: David, we got a moment of Zen this week that we just found prior to this episode. It's actually from a source you would not expect. I believe that source is Van Eck, of all places. So we're going to play that moment of Zen in just a minute. Do you want to say anything to tee this up?
01:30:07.572 - 01:30:15.486, Speaker A: Van eck very TradFi. Boomer. Capital uncharacteristically zoomer meme. That's all I'll say.
01:30:15.508 - 01:30:30.386, Speaker B: It's really good. It's really good. Disclosures. We're going to end with risk in a minute, but first we disclose bankless Ventures, as we mentioned, is an investor in Phoenix. We talked about them earlier in the show. David and I are both advisors to Matter labs as well in the ZK Sync project. And of course, David.
01:30:30.386 - 01:30:42.994, Speaker B: And I hold ETH. We are long term investors. We're not journalists. We don't do paid content. There's always a link to all bankless disclosures in the show notes. I'm going to end with this. You know, crypto is risky.
01:30:42.994 - 01:30:55.774, Speaker B: You could get fished, you could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the ankle's journey. Thanks a lot. Ethereum. Ethereum now in an ETF form.
01:30:55.774 - 01:30:56.960, Speaker B: Coming soon.
01:30:57.490 - 01:31:03.260, Speaker A: Follow us to stay informed on the release onhodl or coworkade o f.
