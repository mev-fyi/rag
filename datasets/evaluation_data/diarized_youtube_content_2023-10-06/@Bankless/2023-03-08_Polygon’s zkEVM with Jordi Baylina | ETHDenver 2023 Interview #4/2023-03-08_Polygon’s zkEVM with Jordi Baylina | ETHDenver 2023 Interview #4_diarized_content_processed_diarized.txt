00:00:12.730 - 00:00:32.998, Speaker A: We are at the Axelar Interoperability series. And next up in this conversation, we are talking to Jordy of the ZK EVM. Used to be ZK Hermes, but then it was acquired by Polygon to make the ZK Polygon EVM, which is now one of the hottest wars in the L2 space. So that is what's coming up next right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.
00:00:33.084 - 00:01:13.282, Speaker B: Kraken is our strategic sponsor for 2023. Why? Because Kraken has been around for over twelve years and has proven itself to be deeply aligned with the crypto industry. Trusted, centralized crypto platforms are hard to come by these days, which makes the few remaining ones even more valuable. With over 9 million users and not a cent lost, choosing Kraken as our strategic sponsor for 2023 was a no brainer. We need exchanges like Kraken to provide the onramps to get people to go bankless, and Kraken's emphasis on security and transparency makes us feel good about having them as a sponsor. If you're unsure about your centralized exchange or onramp, perhaps open an account with Kraken today. And if you're unsure about the rest of Web Three, well then maybe you should get your Learn on with MetaMask Learn.
00:01:13.282 - 00:01:58.914, Speaker B: Learning about crypto is hard. There's no one out there to hold your hand to get into this industry. Until now. MetaMask Learn is the best place I've ever seen to send someone to learn everything there is to know about Web Three. If you're a company trying to onboard employees, or you're a son or daughter trying to onboard your boomer parents, MetaMask Learn is the place to send them interactive and engaging lessons, making learning about Web Three fun and easy. Now, once you're through the Kraken's gates and you've taken the MetaMask course on what's a Dex, you're safe to make your first stop into the world of DFI. Where better to start other than Uniswap? Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange for crypto asset trades and swaps, but it's now also an NFT aggregator as well, making Uniswap some of the best decentralizing trading tech that's out there.
00:01:58.914 - 00:02:31.542, Speaker B: Uniswap's big announcement at East Denver is their Uniswap wallet, which is waiting to get released to the public as soon as Apple stops being a big ol bully about crypto apps in the App Store. Uniswap is basically on every chain that's relevant in the crypto ecosystem. So if you want to use Uniswap, but with the cheapest possible fees, then use Uniswap on Arbitrum. The Arbitrum. Layer two is the host of Ethereum's most vibrant DFI and NFT communities. Arbitrum is already surpassing the ETH layer one in transaction volume, and it's not even close to full capacity. With so many vibrant communities on Arbitrum, Arbitrum is a good place to call home for the era of L2s.
00:02:31.542 - 00:02:56.734, Speaker B: Speaking of settling into new homes, the Phantom wallet is now available on both Ethereum and Polygon. That's right, the number one wallet on Salana is expanding into the Ethereum ecosystem. Phantom is the one wallet for everything, displaying NFTs, making NFT trades, swapping tokens, Staking tokens. So if you're a MultiChain surfer or an NFT power user, then the Phantom wallet is for you. It also comes in mobile. Check it out at Phantom app. Now let's get into the interview.
00:02:56.782 - 00:03:02.246, Speaker A: Bangalore nation. We are at the Interop summit and I'm talking with Jordy from Polygon Hermes. Jordy, how's it going, my man?
00:03:02.348 - 00:03:07.430, Speaker C: Very good. Very excited to be here in Know. It's an important event in the year.
00:03:07.500 - 00:03:13.594, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I managed to snag you right before you're going on to talk at a panel. What's that panel about? What are you going to talk about?
00:03:13.632 - 00:03:35.394, Speaker C: Well, we are going to talk very much about connecting roll ups. This year is going to be the year of roll ups. We are also seeing and we are going to be talking about how we connect all these roll ups and how we create this community. We keep the Ethereum community together somehow. So that's going to be probably the biggest topic on the panel, but we'll see. Yeah.
00:03:35.432 - 00:03:47.720, Speaker A: And there's a big conversation going on, of course, at the Interop conference. There's also interop between L2s. And I think is this about specifically interoperability between Ethereum L2s, or is this even broader than that?
00:03:48.090 - 00:03:54.150, Speaker C: I think it's about L2s, but I'm open to any discussion here.
00:03:54.220 - 00:03:55.750, Speaker A: Wherever the moderator leads.
00:03:56.330 - 00:03:57.670, Speaker C: I'm not the moderator.
00:03:59.610 - 00:04:04.090, Speaker A: Jordy was polygon. The first ZKE EVM.
00:04:06.030 - 00:04:36.238, Speaker C: I mean, it's just seeing the first and we are not even the first yet. So we are going to launch a main net on March 27 if everything goes okay. And this is not oh, it's an important milestone, but it's not the only milestone. So it's like we will launch this in mainnet. It's going to be a beta. It's a lot of improvements needs to be done. We still need to add a lot of pre compiled smart contracts.
00:04:36.238 - 00:04:51.782, Speaker C: We need to grow in the scalability. So this is not a matter of who's first, who's last. Okay. I know that marketing people, they love this stuff, but this is content producers also love it, by the way. Yeah, exactly. But this is not about that. This is about building here.
00:04:51.782 - 00:05:26.630, Speaker C: We are a strong community. Many projects that we are trying to scale, Ethereum, each one is building the the solution. They believe in him more. We are experimenting. We are learning a lot and we are moving forward on that direction. The evolution we as a community, we did in the last two years has been huge, but still a lot of things to do in all the sites. We are going to be the first, probably.
00:05:26.630 - 00:05:54.366, Speaker C: We're going to be the first in having a complete of code compatible Zkbm in mainnet, in production, open to everybody and with zero friction for the users where you can use. So I think it's an important it's a very advanced system, what we are going to launch. But again, it's an important milestone. But just a milestone. That's it. Yeah.
00:05:54.388 - 00:06:06.318, Speaker A: So when business development people or builders or even just users, what questions do they frequently ask you? What's the frequently asked question when they come up to you and talk about the Polygon ZKE EVM?
00:06:06.494 - 00:06:45.870, Speaker C: Well, there are questions, all sorts of questions, but questions about the scalability, how the roll ups will scale and compatibility, if this is going to be compatible or not, what can be done. Things about data availability. There is a lot of dopes still in the community. It's a new system so it's normal that the people don't fully understand how everything works altogether. There are some confusions. We are trying to clarify some confusions. Last week in Twitter I was just trying to clarify, for example, things about scalability.
00:06:45.870 - 00:07:22.902, Speaker C: The approver is not the limitation on the scalability. Okay, this is one of the topic. But things about the sequencer when we are talking about a centralized sequencer, what it means, okay, that doesn't mean that it's centralized, but you can still have some properties of decentralization like censorship, resistance and so on. And even if what happened, if the sequencer just falls, there's a lot of things that we need to explain and how this works.
00:07:23.036 - 00:07:28.250, Speaker A: So walk us through the timeline for the Polygon PKE EVM. When will I be able to go play on it?
00:07:28.320 - 00:07:45.798, Speaker C: So right now you can already play it. It's a testnet has been running for two months or more than two months right now. Next week? Well, tomorrow if everything works okay, we probably will do a regenesis of the testnet.
00:07:45.914 - 00:07:51.294, Speaker A: Regenesis is when you shut it down, start it back up again. And now it's mainnet.
00:07:51.422 - 00:08:24.366, Speaker C: Yeah, it's going to be very close to what should be in mainnet. We're still running the final audits and finding, just finding things. Security is a huge topic. I think this is probably the thing that have more concern on that. Again, we are spending a lot of effort inside the team and outside the team on that. And again, if everything works as it should, we should launch on March 27. This beta version of a Mainet and.
00:08:24.388 - 00:08:27.994, Speaker A: What does that beta version mean? Like what's the difference between beta and mainnet?
00:08:28.042 - 00:08:50.530, Speaker C: It's Mainet but it's the first main net deployment. So expect that there is bugs there. It's the first version. Expect that we are probably going to change things in there. So it's an important step because at some point you need to launch and at some point you need like training wheels. Training wheels. We are going to start with the training wheels.
00:08:50.530 - 00:09:15.966, Speaker C: One, we are going to have a kill switch. We are going to remove that as soon as we can. But it's going to be a kill switch. It's going to be some central points on there. We are trying to keep as preventive and as safe as possible. There is always a risk. It's important that the people understand that this is first versions of anything.
00:09:15.966 - 00:09:53.094, Speaker C: It's easier to have bugs. We run it a lot of audits, we run it internal audits. We are going to run a bug bounty. We are going to continue running audits we will spend as much as we can on security. We need to launch this just to spin up this and to have this in production we'll see so it's an important it's in a step, it's an important step. It's a step that at some point we have to do. But the people that's using this network needs to understand what they are using and what's the status of this network.
00:09:53.094 - 00:10:33.510, Speaker C: So that's why it's important to say that this is a beta, that this is the first version, that please be cautious on how you are using that, or that I think it's important the users understand what it is. Don't go crazy, don't do some airdrops billionaire airdrops or staking or whatever in there because I don't want to hear it's a lot of mistake it's not only polygon stake, it's also the ecosystem mistake and ethereum mistake. So here we should not go crazy in these new technologies that just out of the oven.
00:10:35.130 - 00:10:48.714, Speaker A: Could you help me understand what does it mean to have a bug in a ZKE EVM? I think that's the whole ZK world is a new frontier for all of us and for the non technical people like me. When you say like oh, there could be bugs, what kind of bugs could there be? How bad could that be?
00:10:48.752 - 00:11:00.154, Speaker C: So here we categorize the box in four categories. Let me just name the four. First one is a smart contract box. Just normal smart contract.
00:11:00.202 - 00:11:02.730, Speaker A: This is normal thing not at the protocol layer.
00:11:02.890 - 00:11:32.538, Speaker C: Then the others are in the proverb box. Okay? The proverb will have three types of bags we have the correctness bags, we have the soundness bags and then we have like situation where you cannot prove it's like a stop the proverb breaks the prover breaks and it doesn't move forward. So that's another kind of box. Of these three of course smart contracts is as critical as any other smart contract. Sure, that's a technology we know about.
00:11:32.624 - 00:11:34.874, Speaker A: That'S a known quantity exactly.
00:11:35.072 - 00:12:33.562, Speaker C: But here the most critical one is the correctness one. Correctness one means that you are executing a normal transaction and maybe at the final of this transaction you get an infinite amount of ether. That's something that would be a bug and it would be a really bad bug because we could not do very much on that. Well, we could press the kill switch in the main net if we see that and just try to avoid the withdrawals we have some mechanisms to monitor that and so on but this is a really hard bug here. We need to say here that I'm quite confident with these kind of bugs because we pass all the ethereum tests, all the ethereum tests that applies this test about a smart contract that we are not implementing. Of course this doesn't pass, but that's not because there is a problem. But for the relevant test, all the relevant tests to the Zkvf, which are the most of them, they are passing.
00:12:33.562 - 00:13:18.730, Speaker C: So this means that the correctness of the protocol is very well proven. Sure. Of course, there are still some specific things on the ABM that you don't have never the 100% warranties. Okay? But here I'm quite confident that this correctness together with all the Audis and all together we should be okay on that. But again, never 100% like smart contracts, you never are 100% confident on that. But the degree of confidence is I would say is high enough to launch in Aveta. Then we have soundness is.
00:13:18.730 - 00:13:58.122, Speaker C: I mean, this is probably the one that it's the one that's easier to be. So it's very easy that we find some sourness error. We did a lot of work just checking on that, but we find a lot of them. So it's easy that maybe there are some more that we find in the future for this. Okay, we need to move forward and try to find them and move. But the good thing of these bugs is that if one of these bugs is in the system, the user will not lose folders. So we are going to be at the beginning the only prover and we are not going to prove something wrong.
00:13:58.122 - 00:14:47.570, Speaker C: So it literally is impossible or very difficult for one of these errors to impact in a user phone. Probably the system will become centralized. So the idea is the system fallbacks in centralization, we probably have to update to upgrade the smart contract, but the user will not impact in the user funds or something like that. As far as we are trusted, which is not we are building. Okay? So that's why it's important to go through all these bags and find all of these soundness bags. So it's important to go to all these soundness bags. But from the main net launch perspective, this is less critical because this way and the last one is that you just stop the network.
00:14:47.570 - 00:15:37.430, Speaker C: And here is just a timeout. So if the network is stopped for six months, then the network will just halt and we just upgrade the contract. So like soundness but this would be maybe a bigger impact, but more in the operation because the network maybe would be stopped for maybe one week. What's the timeout on that? But that would be the impact. So in one week we just upgrade the smart contract and the users proverb would continue running and the release would recall. So these are the four categorizations of the bag. I think I explained you very much the concerns and here the balances and the trade offs for launching, I think it's important here to be very transparent and explain is very clear, especially for early users.
00:15:37.430 - 00:15:53.122, Speaker C: But again, we need to move forward on that if we need to wait. But this happens to any blockchain project. So if you need to wait to be 100% sure that your system is safe, you will never launch.
00:15:53.206 - 00:15:53.854, Speaker A: Right? Yes.
00:15:53.892 - 00:16:25.942, Speaker C: But in the other side, it cannot be crazy. You cannot launch things that you know that the probability of big bugs are going to be high. So here finding the right trade off on when you launch. How much did you minimize the risk? I would say probably this is the most difficult decision making that any blockchain project needs to take at some point. And this is where we are right now in polygon, certainly.
00:16:25.996 - 00:16:54.574, Speaker A: Well, I really appreciate all that thought process and the idea of just some natural balance between order and chaos comes to mind where you can't be too ordered because you'll never launch, but you definitely can't be chaotic because that doesn't go in crypto. And the bankless metaphor of this is the frontier also comes to mind. And so to the rewards go the bold. But also you don't want to be too bold because you might die and never come back. And so Jordy, I know you got to talk to run to so I appreciate all of your time and walking us through the Polygon ZK EVM, I really appreciate it.
00:16:54.612 - 00:16:55.610, Speaker C: It's a pleasure. Cheers.
