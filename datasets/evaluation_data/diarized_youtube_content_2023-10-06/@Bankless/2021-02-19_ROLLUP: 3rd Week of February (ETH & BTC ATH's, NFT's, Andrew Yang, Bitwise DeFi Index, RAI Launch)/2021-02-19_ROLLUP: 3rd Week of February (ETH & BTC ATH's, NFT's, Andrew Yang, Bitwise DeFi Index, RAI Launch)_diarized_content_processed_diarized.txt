00:00:08.170 - 00:00:13.550, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. It's the third week of February. Happy Friday. Morning. David, what are we doing today?
00:00:13.700 - 00:00:35.266, Speaker B: We're rolling up the third week of February. The crypto world moves so incredibly fast, and so Ryan and I go through a week's worth of news as fast as possible. So get that coffee ready, because we're coming at you hot. Here's what we do. We always talk about the markets. What are the markets saying? Then we get into releases, what got released in the last week? Then we go into news. What happened in the news cycle.
00:00:35.266 - 00:00:47.738, Speaker B: Lastly, we finish up with some ecosystem takes who had some good opinions in the world of crypto in the last week. And then we finish with what Ryan and David are excited about. And then, of course, the meme of the week.
00:00:47.824 - 00:00:55.838, Speaker A: The meme of the week is a new feature. Super excited to get there. It's like the dessert at the end of a fantastic meal. David, are you ready to roll them up?
00:00:55.924 - 00:00:57.342, Speaker B: We're rolling it up. Let's do it.
00:00:57.396 - 00:01:05.822, Speaker A: All right, David, before we get into the roll ups, we should tell our audience what lattice is. These are really cool devices. You've got one sitting over there, right?
00:01:05.956 - 00:01:26.006, Speaker B: Yeah. It's a new hardware wallet. It's a different kind of hardware wallet. It's not a mobile one. It's one that kind of feels a little bit similar to your Amazon Alexa, your Google home. You leave it at home, and it's got a big screen for you to digest the transactions that you are about to approve. It's kind of the new standard in security, and I've been having a lot of fun just playing with it.
00:01:26.028 - 00:01:26.502, Speaker A: It's pretty cool.
00:01:26.556 - 00:01:27.158, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:27.324 - 00:01:40.518, Speaker A: Lattice wanted us to let you know that they are back in stock for the bankless nation. So we will include a link in the show notes. If you want to pick up a shiny new lattice wallet, they are back in stock. All right, David, you ready to get to markets?
00:01:40.614 - 00:01:43.286, Speaker B: Let's do it. There's so much is happening in the markets.
00:01:43.318 - 00:01:51.166, Speaker A: That's for always. Always and forever. Let's start with the bitcoin market. What is going on with bitcoin? Did we just hit another all time high, my friend?
00:01:51.348 - 00:02:18.182, Speaker B: Once again, I actually can't remember the last time we've done one of these where crypto hasn't hit all time highs. But, yeah, bitcoin $52,000 crossed the $50,000 mark after flirting with just being under it. Right after Elon Musk announced the Tesla $1.5 billion purchase of bitcoin. Bitcoin shot up to like $48,000. And then it hovered there all of last week. And now this week, we are finally crossed over that $50,000 mark.
00:02:18.182 - 00:02:21.482, Speaker B: So congratulations to bitcoin for breaking $50,000.
00:02:21.616 - 00:02:27.894, Speaker A: That is a milestone. Fifty k per bitcoin. Pretty impressive. What's ETH doing this week, David?
00:02:28.022 - 00:02:37.182, Speaker B: Ether is $1,933. The way this is going, I expect it to be higher by the end of this recording. So we will see.
00:02:37.316 - 00:03:01.430, Speaker A: Yeah, by tomorrow morning, when you're listening to this, it may have hit two k, it may have hit 1800. Who knows? There's a lot of variability here, but it is on a tear. I wouldn't be surprised if we're two k by tomorrow morning, when you're listening to this, we will just see. ETH has been an absolute tear as well. So has total locked value in DFI. It is up again, hitting all time highs. What number is locked in DFI now?
00:03:01.580 - 00:03:23.622, Speaker B: $42 billion locked in DFI. Last one we recorded it was right under $40 billion. So in the last week, we've piled on two extra billion locked in DFI. And of course, the DPi is up to $430. I remember when we started recording this, Ryan, DPI was like at 80 or something when we started doing the weekly roll up. So DPi has been on its absolute tear.
00:03:23.766 - 00:03:42.114, Speaker A: It is down a little bit on the week, though, which is interesting. And I think this kind of reflects in a ratio that we've been tracking on the roll up that know indicates the seasonality we are in, in crypto. And this is the DPi to ETh ratio. Do you want to talk about this ratio, why it's important and what we're looking at this week?
00:03:42.232 - 00:04:35.326, Speaker B: Yeah, DPi, of course, is the index for DFI, the top ten DFI assets. And I've been paying attention to the ETH DPi ratio because it's a stronger signal, in my opinion, than the DPi to us dollar price, because the dollar is inflationary, highly inflationary. And really, ether and bitcoin are the new benchmarks. And so, especially with Ether and Ethereum, DPi priced versus ether really indicates how risk on people are being, how far down the market cap stack people are looking at. And there was a pretty strong retracement in DPi versus ether in the last week. And so it hit a high of 00:26 dpi per ether, and now we are down to 00:25. But overall, DPi is performing really strongly versus ether, but taking a little bit of a retrace lately.
00:04:35.438 - 00:05:09.774, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting because it's not like DPi is necessarily weak. It's been relatively consistent versus last week. But it's just that ETH has been on a tear, which means the dpi to eth ratio obviously goes down in those types of conditions. Let's talk about bitcoin on Ethereum. This tweet by Josh Stark, who noticed that there are 173,000 bitcoin on Ethereum right now, that number is also up. And he also takes us in this tweet where he kind of compares it to total bitcoin supply. That's almost 1%.
00:05:09.774 - 00:05:38.298, Speaker A: 1% of all outstanding bitcoin is now on Ethereum, which is absolutely huge. And if you compare it to sort of the more bitcoin centric bitcoin maxillus, maybe I might say, scaling solutions like blockstream's liquid. There's 63 times more bitcoin on Ethereum than blockstream's liquid. And there's 158 times more bitcoin on Ethereum than there is on the lightning network. Now, what do you make of this?
00:05:38.464 - 00:06:10.594, Speaker B: Yeah, first off, this is something that fits in the Ethereum native narrative, is that Ethereum is this nexus of economic activity. It's a black hole of assets. Assets are more useful on Ethereum. There's bitcoin and then there's bitcoin on Ethereum. And bitcoin on Ethereum is straight up more useful than bitcoin on bitcoin. Right? So there's this natural gravitational pull to pull assets into ethereum. And lightning is just not really doing the things that people, that bitcoiners really wanted it to be doing.
00:06:10.594 - 00:06:32.854, Speaker B: And I think that there's a very strong case that all of the use cases of lightning are going to actually be facilitated by bitcoin on Ethereum's l two s. Like perhaps loop ring. Loop ring is fast, instant payments, trustless payments, in the same way that lightning promised that. But I think that wrapped bitcoin on Ethereum is actually going to facilitate some of the same demand for bitcoin on the lightning network.
00:06:32.982 - 00:07:03.122, Speaker A: So lightning is based on state channel technology. And it's interesting to me, David, that state channels didn't really take off on Ethereum either, and they're not taking off on bitcoin. Unfortunately for Ethereum, there are other layer two approaches available on Ethereum. We're talking about one in the podcast that comes out on Monday morning, which is roll ups primarily. But bitcoin has only had sort of this one bullet in the chamber, which is lightning. And it's not sucking in a lot of bitcoin right now. The crypto banks certainly are.
00:07:03.122 - 00:07:28.346, Speaker A: Ethereum certainly is, but not lightning. All right, David, let's talk about miners for a second. Eth miners are making bank right now. It's insane. They made a total of 830,000,000 in January, dude. And 40% of that was fee revenue. Right? So again, miners make revenue on any blockchain, including Ethereum or bitcoin, in two ways.
00:07:28.346 - 00:08:03.794, Speaker A: One is issuance. So they get a reward based in ether every time they mine a block successfully. So that's issuance reward, and they also make fees on the gas that you pay or the transaction costs that you pay on the bitcoin network. These two fee structures combine to form the total minor revenue. And what's amazing here is now, transaction fees compose 40% of total minor revenue on Ethereum. So what do you make of these high numbers and that proportion of fees being transaction fee revenue?
00:08:03.922 - 00:08:27.962, Speaker B: Yeah, this is just a very strong signal as to what the longevity of Ethereum could be. Right. The way that you understand a blockchain to be able to live long into the future is demand for block space. And Ryan, if you click on that image, it'll blow it up a little bit bigger. Look at that bar on the right. That red part on top of the blue part, that's the fee revenue. And the blue part is the issuance.
00:08:27.962 - 00:08:54.998, Speaker B: Right. Wow. They're almost equal. They're almost equal in fee revenue to issuance. And what that tells us is that if you take that fee revenue side of that bar chart, it's larger than all of the revenue that miners made in the bear market for almost an entire year. The fees that miners made in the last couple of months match the entire issuance and fees that they got in 2018 and 2019. And this is really important.
00:08:54.998 - 00:09:42.434, Speaker B: This is super important. And the reason why is because if your blockchain can collect fees, if the validators can collect fees, you don't have to issue as much currency to fund security. That means that your asset will be having less issuance, which means your asset will be more scarce, will be more hard. The more fees that are collected, the less you have to issue. And so the whole narrative around this bitcoin hard cap is still thrown into question, because we do not see this same minor revenue from fees in the bitcoin network. The whole narrative around bitcoin is that at some point, issuance will be replaced by fees. Yet we are already seeing this in the Ethereum blockchain.
00:09:42.434 - 00:10:05.040, Speaker B: We are seeing out of the 100% of total revenue, 40% of that is fees paid to miners in ether. I don't know what the bitcoin fee percentage is. I think the last time I checked, it was like 10% to 15%. But Ether, and Ethereum is already outcompeting bitcoin in long term sustainability. Ether is ultrasound money. It's still ultrasound money.
00:10:06.530 - 00:10:54.654, Speaker A: I want to talk two things about this too, David, just to add on to what you're saying. It is the case that if all of the bitcoin were issued, as is the plan, right, and let's say all of the ether were issued, that Ethereum would be a higher security network than bitcoin today if they were both based on just transaction fee revenue. Which means Ethereum's blocks are more valuable than bitcoin's blocks, which is interesting because bitcoin is the one switching to 100% transaction fee revenue, which is not its strength. Its strength is a meme store of value. Its strength is not the value of its block space and its network. So it's kind of switching from its strength to its weakness in its issuance policy. And again, issuance policy is also security policy.
00:10:54.654 - 00:11:49.402, Speaker A: So these are trade offs that people often confuse. The other thing I wanted to say is all of this red section that you're pointing at on the graph, guess what happens to this red section, guys? EIP 15 five nine means it starts to go to holders. This red section, a large proportion of it starts to get burnt when EIP 15 five nine is active, which means it actually decreases the ether supply. So I don't know how much we're looking at here, David, but like 829,000,000 in January, 39% of those were fees. Let's say it's like 300 million or so, something to that effect. A large proportion of that would be burnt under EIP 15 five nine, say 200 million, 250,000,000 of fee burns. That's a denflationary pressure on ether and the scarcity of eth.
00:11:49.402 - 00:12:01.314, Speaker A: So this chart is, while gas fees suck, right. It is long term, very bullish for the health and security and the product market fit of the Ethereum blockchain, for.
00:12:01.352 - 00:12:15.394, Speaker B: All the visual learners out there, and for those on the podcast, you should check out the YouTube, because there are plenty of things to look at. Take that red section and then take an equal amount of the size of that red section and delete it from the blue section.
00:12:15.442 - 00:12:15.654, Speaker A: Right?
00:12:15.692 - 00:12:35.994, Speaker B: And so all of that red feed that you're seeing, you can actually remove the issuance right. And so if you remove the red part from the blue part, that is actually the issuance of ether. And if the red part continues to go up and up and up, the blue part will continue to go down and down and down under an EIP 1559 paradigm.
00:12:36.122 - 00:12:45.070, Speaker A: And just like that, this whole roll up turned into an EIP 15 five nine episode. We can go on for ten or 15 more minutes about this, David, but we've got to move on.
00:12:45.140 - 00:12:45.822, Speaker B: It's so cool.
00:12:45.876 - 00:12:46.786, Speaker A: It is awesome.
00:12:46.888 - 00:12:49.474, Speaker B: Revolutionary part about this whole entire industry right now.
00:12:49.512 - 00:13:08.114, Speaker A: Yeah, and it's so underrated. Like most people don't understand this. This is not the popular main street narrative. This is the stuff that you're hearing from bankless because people in the bankless community are actually looking at this stuff. Anyway, we got to move on. This is a really cool chart, David. This is companiesbymarketcap, Comarketcap bank.
00:13:08.162 - 00:13:08.326, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:08.348 - 00:13:43.714, Speaker A: So this section is banksby market cap. So you can look at total of Fortune 500, all the biggest companies in the world. You can also just narrow it in by banks. And what I love about this is if you rank all of the banks in the world and compare that to these new crypto banks, bitcoin and ethereum, bitcoin ranks number one. It is now the biggest, I guess, money bank type system, transaction system by market cap. So it beats Morgan Chase, it beats bank of America, it beats ICBC. And Ethereum is number five in this.
00:13:43.752 - 00:13:49.378, Speaker B: Or five versus the banks. Five if you include bitcoin.
00:13:49.554 - 00:14:42.934, Speaker A: Exactly. So it is number four versus the banks. Maybe we'll focus on that. So it has a ways to grow to beat JPMorgan Chase, David. But if it doubles, if we're seeing ETH at 3000, if we're seeing ETH at 4000 per ETH, then it becomes the biggest banking system by market cap in the world. So what this tells me is that ETH is climbing right up the banks to the banks in terms of value, but it's still also undervalued, right? Like if you compare JPMorgan Chase, which is 440 market cap billion market cap versus Ethereum right now, which is 221,000,000,000 market cap, what's more valuable, the credibly neutral money system for the entire planet backed by a reserve asset store of value money or boring old JPMorgan Chase? I guess that's for investors to decide, right?
00:14:42.972 - 00:15:00.646, Speaker B: And Ethereum, like banking services is just one of Ethereum's possibilities, right? That's just one thing it can do. It can also do like nfts and art and gaming and all the other things. Just banking is selling Ethereum short. It has a multitude of possibilities, and it's still just half the market cap of Morgan.
00:15:00.838 - 00:15:39.980, Speaker A: All right, David, the last thing we should explore in market section is this chart, which is really exciting to me as kind of a bankless maximalist as I know you and I are, and a decentralization maximalist. So this is from glassnode.com. They put together fantastic metrics on this that I haven't seen anywhere else. And this is a charting on Ethereum. The percent balance of ETH supply that's on exchanges right now. And you can see this chart over time versus, that's the blue line here is the percent balance of ETH supply on exchanges. And the gray line here is ether price.
00:15:39.980 - 00:16:28.982, Speaker A: And you can kind of see it ebb and flow. But the good news is the balance of ether on exchanges is going down. And what that means is it's going to other places, essentially primarily back to the ethereum network, primarily back to people's wallets, back to the decentralized finance, back to being bankless out of crypto banks. And right now there was at kind of the early stages, I guess, of this bull run or about a year ago or so, about 17% of all ether supply on crypto exchanges. And now there's 13% and it's continuing to drop. This is really good for the bankless revolution because we want smart contract custody as much as possible. We want self custody as much as possible.
00:16:28.982 - 00:16:37.034, Speaker A: We want a self sovereign monetary system. We want decentralization. So this to me is a really bullish stat. David, what's your take?
00:16:37.152 - 00:17:15.410, Speaker B: Yeah, it's also doubly important for Ethereum versus bitcoin to not have too much ether on exchanges because ether is a staking token, right. And so we want people to be staking themselves either through a decentralized service provider or just doing it at home. Too much ether on exchanges is less than ideal. That means there's a lot of consensus by exchanges. And while there are reasons to why that's not the end of the world, it's still better if people are staking their ether at home. And ether having its exodus from exchanges is good for that, and it's also good for the price. It's both a symptom of increasing price, because when people buy ether, they remove it from exchanges.
00:17:15.410 - 00:17:18.882, Speaker B: And then also there's less ether on exchanges to be bought.
00:17:18.946 - 00:17:19.126, Speaker A: Right.
00:17:19.148 - 00:17:48.834, Speaker B: And so any further buying pressure increases the ether price at a faster rate. The less and less ether price there is on exchanges. I think you can note that the lowest ether percentage on exchanges there's ever been was at the previous ETH all time high in 2017 or just in January of 2018, when ETH peaked out at the last point in that cycle. And so ETH continuing to leave exchanges is just indicative of this being a bull market, and we want that to continue.
00:17:49.032 - 00:17:59.346, Speaker A: Absolutely. Well said, David. All right, we are going to tell you a little bit about the fantastic sponsors who've made this episode possible, and then we will get to the releases. Stay tuned.
00:17:59.458 - 00:18:40.690, Speaker B: Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide.

00:19:20.814 - 00:20:12.942, Speaker B: Monolith is a one two punch of both an Ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your Ethereum wallet everywhere where Visa is accepted. When you swipe your monolith Visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant, it actually makes a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet. It's insanely cool, and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life. Monolith also offers on ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defi. So it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to, and your deposited money goes straight into your non custodial wallet. So your money is never held by a centralized intermediary. Because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure, the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of defi behind it.
00:20:12.942 - 00:20:23.474, Speaker B: Swapping assets on uniswap or earning yield in defi is at your fingertips. Go to Monolith XYZ and sign up to get your monolith visa card today.
00:20:23.672 - 00:20:42.666, Speaker A: All right, David, we're back with releases. We gotta start with this one. I think this is big news. Beeple. So that is the artist, mainstream artist, who sold millions of dollars in NFTs in December. Now, beeple art is bringing the NFT revolution to Christie's. Christie's is an auction house.
00:20:42.666 - 00:20:44.490, Speaker A: David, have you heard of Christie's before?
00:20:44.640 - 00:20:45.482, Speaker B: Not at all.
00:20:45.536 - 00:21:03.394, Speaker A: I have. No. I don't. I don't know much about the art scene. I don't buy a lot of art. Know when I do, it's like NFT form. But Christie's, I believe, is an auction house where a ton of the most popular art is auctioned off.
00:21:03.394 - 00:21:29.914, Speaker A: So this is how art collectors in the real world buy art. This is liquidity for art in an auction style, because every NFT is different. So these are non fungible sort of collectibles. Of course, they can't just trade them on an exchange, so they typically auction them off. And they do so at Christie's. Well, an NFT is being auctioned off at Christie's for the first time. Wow.
00:21:29.952 - 00:21:32.300, Speaker B: I'd love to be able to fly on a wall during that.
00:21:33.470 - 00:21:59.940, Speaker A: Like, these art collectors are getting educated in NFTs, in Ethereum. This is like you've talked so often, David, about Ethereum having a ton of surface area, particularly this bull cycle, to collect mainstream interest. And NFTs are a big part of that surface area. And now we're at Christie's auction house with some of the most wealthy people in the world educating them about. That's big.
00:22:00.470 - 00:22:44.078, Speaker B: Yeah, that's absolutely. Again, like, I would love to watch. I don't know who these people that attend Christie's would be, but I would imagine that they are older in their lifespan because that's kind of the cohort of people that engages with art. It's people that have had time to accumulate the wealth. And so I would be interested to see how do you even display an NFT art at Christie's? Are they wheeling a tv onto the stage to show the art? I don't know, but congratulations to people for just being a fantastic pioneer with the NFT space. And this is just extremely legitimizing. NFTs are really, they've been having a moment, but especially in the last one to two weeks, they've really started to just rocket ship into the mainstream mindshare.
00:22:44.078 - 00:22:44.386, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:44.408 - 00:23:23.850, Speaker A: And it's cool because people's kind of like an apostle of this because he both loves nfts and he loves kind of decentralization and everything that's going on in Defi, but this is not the only reason he's in it to make money. Like, there's a tremendous amount of economic opportunity here. And at the end of the day, that's what's going to draw the world into crypto is the economic activity in this new land of infinite white space that can be had here. And that's exactly what's happening. Like billions of dollars of economic activity is going to draw the world into here. Speaking of which, let's talk about the first bitcoin ETF in North America.
00:23:25.070 - 00:23:28.830, Speaker B: Speaking of which, speaking of which, speaking of which.
00:23:28.900 - 00:23:36.782, Speaker A: But this is in Canada. It's not in the US yet, but I think it's still a big deal. Ontario securities regulator approves.
00:23:36.846 - 00:23:39.170, Speaker B: You would think it's a big deal. Mr. Canadian.
00:23:39.590 - 00:23:59.466, Speaker A: I don't know if bankless listeners know that I'm canadian and american. I get my dual citizenship. So I just knocked this headline in because, know, canadian nationalist here. Anyway, I think this is big news and it's interesting. I mean, U. S. Regulators have got to catch up to other jurisdictions, do they not?
00:23:59.648 - 00:24:17.342, Speaker B: This is a race. This is absolutely a race. And the most crypto friendly jurisdictions are going to be rewarded for this. And I would always say Canada is generally a little bit ahead of the curve when it comes to stuff. Generally just stuff. And this is an indication of that.
00:24:17.476 - 00:24:42.434, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So it's good news. Hopefully an NFT, an ETF is on the horizon in the US as well. David, let's talk about we, I talked about this a little bit at the end of rollups as something I was excited about. These new kind of money primitives, algorithmic almost money primitives that were coming to Ethereum. And then here's one of them. What is rye? It's been released.
00:24:42.434 - 00:24:44.662, Speaker A: It's now live. What is it?
00:24:44.796 - 00:25:18.622, Speaker B: Yeah. Rye is a crypto native form of stability. Right? And so rye, for those that don't know rye stones are these very ancient, massive stone discs that were used in this island. I don't know where I've got a picture. Yeah. And it's a lesson about money, right? And so these things were a very early, primitive form of money for these guys, these people that lived on the island. And so if you go in many, many bitcoin podcasts and history of money podcasts use these rhinestones as an example of how money forms.
00:25:18.766 - 00:25:30.866, Speaker A: It's like a ledger, right? No one moves them, but they trade ownership of them as if it's a ledger of some sort. And that's how the money system worked on this island.
00:25:30.978 - 00:26:17.006, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. And so I think that's actually the only similarity between rye and rye stones in this rye project is just the name. But what's really cool about this rye project is that it is self referential stability, right? And so the fantastic thing about Makerdao is that it produces Dai, and Dai is worth $1. The shitty thing about that is that the dollar sucks, right? The dollar is just exporting the brand of the dollar into defi. Right? Rye is a self referential stability. And so it's a little bit nuanced, and it's kind of not really the right time in roll ups to really explain how self referential stability works. But understand that it's a native peg that doesn't need the currency, an external reference point, to become stable.
00:26:17.006 - 00:26:50.974, Speaker B: It's stable to itself. And so this is about self sovereignty. This is about escaping the dollar and creating our own native forms of stability inside of ethereum. Right? And the best part about this is that it's also very similar to Makerdao, except one of the biggest differences is that it's governance minimized, where Makerdao is very happy to have governance that's part of the Makerdao protocol. What that leaves is that there is a potential for a governance minimized version of stability. And this is what Rye is. One of my friends, Amin Soleimani, is part of this.
00:26:50.974 - 00:27:18.890, Speaker B: And also Stefan, who was actually the first meet the nation that we ever did. For those that want to go back and learn about Dai, that's a great resource. And Amin did this fantastic article, which, and his writing is really, really good. So definitely go check it out. And he talks about the concept of a new money God. He rised like this new money God. And what Amin is really talking about is a self perpetuating DFI protocol that doesn't have human control.
00:27:18.890 - 00:27:50.254, Speaker B: Allah a uniswap. Right? A uniswap, where at least with Uniswap V, one, where there was no governance, and it just perpetuated. And because it required no external human dependencies, no external human actions, this thing can just perpetuate in the same way that bitcoin just perpetuates. There's no external dependencies for bitcoin. It just continues. And so Amin calls this like a money God, because as soon as it's turned on, the theory is the hope is that it can't be turned off. And it's all of a sudden here for the rest of time, so long as ethereum exists.
00:27:50.254 - 00:27:52.558, Speaker B: So I'm very optimistic about the future of Rye.
00:27:52.654 - 00:28:18.918, Speaker A: Yeah, it's super cool. And it's all based on ETH, right? So all of the collateral is eth only. So that's what gives it its censorship. Incredibly neutral properties. The other interesting thing about this, David, is this theme we talk about so often on bankless is that every experiment that can be tried in Defi will be tried. I remember there was kind of a fork in the road for the maker project. There were kind of two directions it could pursue.
00:28:18.918 - 00:29:04.394, Speaker A: One was, honestly, it's this rye direction, right, where you just collateralize the entire thing by eth, but you make some trade offs in some other areas, and maybe you don't peg it directly to the dollar anymore. And the other direction is the direction that maker ended up taking, which has ended up as, like, dai is a great primitive stability, primitive for ethereum and for Defi, but it also has a ton of centralized collateral. Like, there's a ton of USDC and USDT backing it, so it's not as pure. So the cool thing about this is there's kind of like a fork in directions of the project. Maker took one direction, and now here comes Rye that's pursuing the other direction. Don't know if this experiment will work or not, but we get to try it. That is a try.
00:29:04.394 - 00:29:13.306, Speaker A: Awesome. So we'll see what happens here. It's a pretty cool new primitive. David, tell us about Euler beats. I don't know what this is, but tell us about this.
00:29:13.408 - 00:29:42.274, Speaker B: Yeah, Euler beats. It's a new NFT release, kind of in the same way that hashmasks got released and also crypto punks got released. Euler Beats is this new NFT experiment. And what's different about this is that it's mostly auditory. It's a music. There is a visual component. But what's cool is if you click on one of these, Ryan, it's kind of like a record player, and it'll start to play if you go onto the website, and this graphic will start to rotate, and there will be music that is performed.
00:29:42.274 - 00:29:49.734, Speaker B: Right. By this kind of construction of a pattern. Right. It's this automated thing. It's kind of hard to explain. So definitely go to the.
00:29:49.852 - 00:29:53.082, Speaker A: I'm hearing the music now. It's coming in my headset. And no one else can hear this.
00:29:53.136 - 00:30:21.566, Speaker B: No one else can hear it, but it's pretty cool. And so each pattern has its own musical orchestra to it. It's musical notes. And so what you are buying is the unique pattern that the music create is created out of these euler beats. I think that's phenomenal. And I think there's a huge world of NFT musical pieces that I think is yet to be created. Imagine the world where somebody like Rac, one of my favorite artists, who's deep into the defi world, I think he might be a listener.
00:30:21.566 - 00:30:37.174, Speaker B: What's up? Andre creates songs, and then have those songs become tokenized, where you can only listen to the song if you own a token. Right. There's so much design space that's possible here, and I'm really excited to see the world of musical NFTs come about.
00:30:37.292 - 00:30:44.390, Speaker A: You know what's cool, too? As with Beeple, we didn't mention this, but as with beeple, these Euler beats are all denominated in what? David?
00:30:44.550 - 00:30:45.366, Speaker B: Ether.
00:30:45.558 - 00:30:46.390, Speaker A: Ether.
00:30:46.550 - 00:30:47.126, Speaker B: Yep.
00:30:47.238 - 00:31:26.294, Speaker A: You put out this great tweet earlier that NFT art is priced in ETh. That is the denomination of NFT art right now, even in Christie's. Basically, the way you buy that beeple art in the Christie's auction is with ETH. It is denominated in ETH. This is an example of ETH serving beyond the store of value, but all the way to the other end of the spectrum, which is like the medium of exchange and even the unit of account. This is an asset that is becoming more money, like, over time and increasing in its is, which is pretty exciting, I think, for the Ethereum space.
00:31:26.492 - 00:32:02.690, Speaker B: Yeah. We're already seeing the explosion in digital art, and that will be, like you said earlier, the surface area for Ethereum is massive, and one of those surface areas is buying and selling digital art. And that will all be done with ether. I think the digital art revolution is absolutely upon us. We're seeing that in basically every single indication that we can think of in any type of market participant. Like, you don't have to give a shit about Ethereum to care about digital art. You can care about digital art and not really care about DeFi or Ethereum, but if you care about digital art, you're going to need to have ether to buy that digital art, because things are going to be denominated in ether.
00:32:03.190 - 00:32:04.622, Speaker A: EtH is money, David.
00:32:04.766 - 00:32:06.702, Speaker B: All right, I've heard that before.
00:32:06.856 - 00:32:15.702, Speaker A: Let's talk about the pool protocol. They just did a community airdrop. So, David, for our listeners, what is the pool protocol and what did they do?
00:32:15.836 - 00:33:07.058, Speaker B: Yeah, pool together is a no loss lottery, where you can pool your funds with other people and for a time period, and that time period is one week, and then for that week, all of the funds that are pooled go into something like compound some interest bearing system, and then it's the interest that is lotteried off, not the actual underlying, not the principle. Right? So you will only put your interest at risk, not your actual funds. And so it's kind of like a Layton Cusack CEO founder. I actually met him in Tel Aviv when I did my ether new model for money talk. Layton is a big fan of just like, psychological tricks to get people to save money, right? And so it's a little bit of gaming, but you are actually saving money along the way because you don't lose anything. It's a no loss lottery. You can only lose your interest or you gain the interest of like a thousand other participants.
00:33:07.058 - 00:33:20.906, Speaker B: And the point is, they just airdrop their pool tokens. So if you have ever used pool together, if you've ever bought a pool together lottery ticket, you have the pool together airdrop. So go claim that. Ryan, I think you are a pool together participant, or at least you were.
00:33:20.928 - 00:33:57.830, Speaker A: For a little bit. I did. And you know why, David? Because I follow the bankless tactics. I subscribe to the bankless newsletter and I follow the tactics, and we released a tactic in September of 2019 just about pulled together as a cool DFI protocol you could try. And I tried it at that time. I put like $38 in, 38 die in, and that ended up being worth in this Airdrop 81 pool tokens, which of course, these pool tokens, they're just governance tokens. So they allow you to govern the parameters of the protocol, but they do have a market value.
00:33:57.830 - 00:34:44.402, Speaker A: So if I were to sell those 81 pool tokens on Uniswap, at least if I did yesterday, it would have been worth $1,500. So, Dave, this is another example of using DFI is rewarding in and of itself, but also because of these token airdrops that are coming down the pike all of the time. We actually released something new to the bankless program, which is an alpha alert email. So what we're going to start doing for bankless members is sending you an alert when something big like this happens and you have an opportunity to make some immediate ROI with an airdrop or some big opportunity. So we sent that out the other day, something timely. So anyway, this is continuing. The story of using DeFi is rewarding, very rewarding.
00:34:44.402 - 00:34:56.986, Speaker A: It's a rewarding experience all around. David, let's talk about this last interface, which is Dex guru. This looks like another Bloomberg terminal for DeFi. What is this?
00:34:57.168 - 00:35:25.426, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we were talking before we started recording, and I think this take is fantastic, so I'm going to steal it. It's so easy to spin up a UI for DeFi, right? This is like the fourth or fifth one we've seen in the last like two or three weeks. It's just a new UI for Uniswap, sushi swap, Dex aggregation, price movements, blah blah blah, like history on trades. It's just a fantastic place to go look at what's going on in DeFi. So if you guys want to go check that out, that's Dex guru. Pretty cool.
00:35:25.528 - 00:35:42.718, Speaker A: Just a builder's paradise, right? Because any developer can create, wire up their own interface, and all you have to do is bring your crypto wallet to that interface, and it's like, just bring your money to the interface, you get to select what interface you want. Super empowering for developers and users alike. All right, David.
00:35:42.754 - 00:35:57.930, Speaker B: And this is how DeFi, UX and UI really gets fixed, because the competition to have the best UI and UX is absolutely massive. Dex Guru is entering a very hotly competitive space to be the UI for Dex activity.
00:35:58.010 - 00:36:19.110, Speaker A: Yeah, and you know what? They probably did this with two developers and they didn't need to ask anyone any permission in order to do this. This is like the early Internet. All right, let's get to news Robinhood to enable crypto withdrawals and deposits. What is this? Is this due to some of the pressure they were facing as a result of the GameStop fallout?
00:36:19.610 - 00:36:41.546, Speaker B: Maybe. I don't know about that. That would be very interesting if that was the connection. I think what they're really trying to do is follow in PayPal's footsteps and just trying to get ahead of the crypto game. They already had 1ft in the door when it comes to crypto. And honestly, it was the minimum foot in the door, which is just having exposure to assets, not actually owning them, just exposure to them.
00:36:41.568 - 00:36:45.470, Speaker A: Just like Ious, Robinhood ious for bitcoin or eth or whatever.
00:36:45.620 - 00:37:17.154, Speaker B: Yeah, right. Except you could never actually withdraw your bitcoin or ether. But since crypto is heating up, I guess Robinhood is finally deciding to double down on what you can do with the crypto side of things. And so now in the future, it's not yet, not live yet, you'll be able to deposit and withdraw crypto assets from Robinhood. I think the next step is for them to enable alternative crypto assets that they have in there because it's pretty abysmal in there. If you go into the, there's a folder in there. I actually checked this out where you could tap the Ethereum family and see all the Ethereum family assets.
00:37:17.154 - 00:37:19.750, Speaker B: Do you know what's in the Ethereum family and assets, Ryan?
00:37:20.250 - 00:37:22.726, Speaker A: I do, just because you've told me, and it's pretty embarrassing.
00:37:22.758 - 00:37:33.398, Speaker B: But why don't you tell us? It's ether and Ethereum. Classic. And that is what Robin Hood calls. That's a messed up Robin Hood. Get your shit together. Like, get DPI in there. Come on.
00:37:33.424 - 00:38:00.726, Speaker A: Well, you know, they are getting their shit together, at least with this. And what I love about this story is this is an example of the competitive pressure that's forcing a Robinhood. If they didn't have to do this, they wouldn't. They'd rather keep everything within their silo, within their four walls. But there's user pressure, there's economic pressure, there's competitive pressure. And so they have to open up. That is a good thing for crypto and for the world and for the banking system at large.
00:38:00.726 - 00:38:10.578, Speaker A: Let's talk about another good thing for crypto, my favorite Andrew Yang tweet. Why don't you read out this tweet and talk about it? David?
00:38:10.674 - 00:38:29.440, Speaker B: Yeah. Andrew Yang, he tweets out as mayor of New York City. He's not the mayor. He's running for New York mayor. So this is like a tweet trying to say what he will do as mayor. As mayor of New York City, the world's financial capital, I would invest in making the city a hub for BTC and other cryptocurrencies. Andrew Yang is my fucking guy.
00:38:29.440 - 00:38:47.570, Speaker B: He knows what the future is like. He knows how to position America to capture that future, to capture that innovation. He is an entrepreneur and he's the right guy for the job. Let's get Andrew Yang to become the new mayor of the financial capital of the world. That's my political.
00:38:49.670 - 00:39:37.334, Speaker A: So, like, so what's cool, though, is we're starting to get politicians on board into seeing that this is not a kind of sketchy terrorist currency that's only in the shadows, that this is good for their economies, it's good for America, it's good for the world, and it's good for their political prospects. And that's what Andrew Yang is doing here. I'm very certain he believes in the ideals of crypto, but I'm also certain that he knows it's good for his mayoral candidacy in New York City. So it's kind of a win. And so it's great to see him speaking up. I hope more politicians do so. But look, Andrew Yang brought Ubi into universal basic income into political discord, something that no one ever talked about.
00:39:37.334 - 00:39:46.002, Speaker A: So maybe he could do the same thing with crypto, bring that into the wider political party platform and just foster the discussion.
00:39:46.146 - 00:40:46.346, Speaker B: And there's so much about Ethereum that really aligns with Andrew Yang's message. Andrew Yang is all about how do we figure out a way to inspire people to create? How do we figure out ways and mechanisms for people to be more entrepreneurial? And personally, I never really considered myself as an entrepreneur until I came into the crypto space, until I came into Ethereum, because that's what this space creates. It's a very entrepreneurial, rich environment. And the important thing about Ethereum is the amount of surface area it has for people to be able to monetize their labor. Ric, second time I'm going to talk about Andre Ric uses Ethereum, the protocol to monetize his own labor for himself. Digital art creators making revenue, making a business by creating digital art and selling it on Ethereum. Sushi Swap has, like a 200 million dollar treasury to help people in their community provide labor and then receive money for it as a job.
00:40:46.346 - 00:41:14.786, Speaker B: All the DFI apps with treasuries are trying to pay people to do work for them. The amount of jobs that Ethereum is going to create independently from these large organizations, these large legacy boomer organizations, sorry, boomers, is massive. Ethereum is going to create so many jobs, and it's going to be creating jobs in the ways that Andrew Yang has been saying, we need to create jobs like this. We need to figure out how to get people to monetize their own labor. And Ethereum does that.
00:41:14.968 - 00:41:17.166, Speaker A: David, when we were setting Andrew Yang.
00:41:17.198 - 00:41:18.094, Speaker B: Come on the podcast.
00:41:18.222 - 00:41:26.118, Speaker A: Okay, well, I was going to say when we were setting out goals for 2021, that was one of our goals, to have Andrew Yang on the podcast over under on whether that happens this year.
00:41:26.204 - 00:41:32.026, Speaker B: What do you think? It's Andrew Yang's coming on the podcast in 2021. He's going to figure it out.
00:41:32.208 - 00:41:34.954, Speaker A: David is declaring it, and I think we might.
00:41:35.072 - 00:41:36.774, Speaker B: I should go get my Andrew Yang t shirt.
00:41:36.822 - 00:41:38.102, Speaker A: I'm sure he's listening.
00:41:38.246 - 00:41:39.126, Speaker B: I'm sure he's listening.
00:41:39.158 - 00:42:23.370, Speaker A: He's going to email us right after this. Let's talk about, more about this news, which is, I think, news in a series of kind of the institutionalization of crypto, but more specifically of Defi. So Bitwise has just launched a new DeFi fund. It was only last week, or maybe the week before we were reporting out on a roll up that Bitwise was starting to incorporate DeFi assets like Aave and Uniswap in its top ten index. So bitwise is like a set protocol. It's like a traditional index that you can buy almost like an ETF, not quite an ETF, but that you can buy to give you exposure, broad exposure to an asset class of some sort. Now they're launching a DFI specific fund.
00:42:23.370 - 00:42:37.166, Speaker A: Why is this important? It's important because this is how institutions onboard into DeFi, and Bitwise is giving them a way to gain exposure. It's another bridge from institutions to our crypto world. David, any other takes on.
00:42:37.348 - 00:43:01.046, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really important because institutions, when they say, like, oh, this DeFi thing is hot, how do I get exposure to, like, they're not going to go researching individual tokens. They are going to outsource that responsibility to someone else, like bitwise. Right. Ryan, I think if you scroll down, it'll show the assets that are coming into the bitwise top ten. Is that true? Maybe not, but there are all the ones that you would expect, which is like uni.
00:43:01.148 - 00:43:08.666, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, we got it here. Uniswap ave synthetics, maker compound uma urine finance, zero x loop ring. Right.
00:43:08.768 - 00:43:38.078, Speaker B: That's a great portfolio that's relatively similar to my bags. So thanks, bitwise, for buying my bags. Very happy about that. But, yeah, I think bitwise, it's inside of crypto, but I would still call it quote unquote institutional. And so really what this is relaying to me is that the rest of crypto that isn't ethereum native, that isn't really deep in the weeds of DeFi, are pivoting to start to capture the value of DeFi because that is the thing that is cool and unique about crypto this cycle.
00:43:38.174 - 00:44:01.526, Speaker A: Yeah. We are going to have the chief investment officer of Bitwise on the bank list podcast here pretty soon to talk a bit more about that. So stay tuned if you're interested in this story, David, let's talk about support EIP 15 five nine. This is how governance works in Ethereum and in crypto. Can you talk about this and why this is important and then kind of relate it to governance?
00:44:01.718 - 00:44:59.802, Speaker B: Yeah. This support EIP 1559 campaign is a response to a bunch of miners that are collecting themselves together to do the opposite, where they're trying to nix EIP 1559 because obviously it's straight up bad for miners. There's less minor revenue if EIP 1559 goes in all those fees that we were talking about earlier under an EIP 1559 paradigm that gets burned instead of going to the miners. So miners don't like that. If you want to listen to a really good rant, listen to Anthony Suzano and Eric Connor on their into the ether podcast that they did where they talked about this. The minority of miners, by the way, and what's interesting about this is the support side of EIp 1559 is also led by miners, but the anti EIP 1559, also another, a different set of miners, different pools of miners. Honestly, fuck those guys because they are making the most amount of money that they have ever made ever.
00:44:59.802 - 00:45:20.434, Speaker B: And they are just trying to say, like, no, EIP 1559 is going to destabilize Ethereum. We're not going to make any money. Even with EIP 1559, miners are making the most money that they've ever made, ever. Like crime me a river. This is why proof of stake is so important, because miners are not aligned with Ethereum as much as ether holders are.
00:45:20.632 - 00:46:04.394, Speaker A: So this website is a website. It's basically an advocacy type website where you can tweet your support, you click a button, you tweet your support, and just go on record as saying you support EIP 15 five nine. And basically the entire community does support EIP 15 five nine, with a few very small exceptions, except for miners. But let's talk about this, because I think this is interesting. What I guess weapon, what leverage do miners have over the rest of the community? So let's say I'm a miner. I don't want to lose my revenue here, and I start saber rattling. What's my threat to the Ethereum community? What am I going to do if you guys go forward with EIP 15.
00:46:04.394 - 00:46:05.394, Speaker A: Five nine.
00:46:05.592 - 00:46:28.678, Speaker B: Yeah. The minority of miners would be able to fork off their chain, and I guess, actually they wouldn't fork where when EIP 1559 comes in, that's going to be a fork. And so the miners that don't want that are just going to continue on in their own chain. But good luck convincing the rest of us to go with you. Right. This is the power of community consensus. If there's two forks, the community will choose the one that they want to go with.
00:46:28.678 - 00:46:44.150, Speaker B: And from what we can tell, EIP 1559 with overwhelming support, everyone's going to choose the fork with that support. So go fork Ethereum, and go play in your non EIP 1559 playground. Have fun with your one dollars eth fork.
00:46:44.310 - 00:47:14.582, Speaker A: The apps aren't coming there. The community is not coming there. The users aren't coming there. I guess the upside is we might get an extra token out of this that we can go sell, right? So this is like an Ethereum classic, classic type of situation. So they really don't have the leverage here. They really don't have the leverage here, which is super interesting. But if you're an ETh holder, it's kind of all upside, right? Because you basically get both forks in this types of situation.
00:47:14.582 - 00:47:41.854, Speaker A: But this is also an example of how governance works, right? This is kind of the counter forces at play. And ultimately, community consensus is the engine here is the governance layer, that layer zero, everyone together deciding which fork they are going to download and support is the community. And that's what Ethereum is. It works the same in bitcoin, and it's a brilliant, I think, mechanism for governance that's as credibly neutral as it can be.
00:47:41.972 - 00:48:31.982, Speaker B: Well, I'll actually push back on that and be the devil's advocate here. So for anyone that wants to call me an EtH maximalist, here's my critique of this. I don't want, in the long term, any sort of, like, I support this fork versus I support this fork because the whole point of Ethereum in the long term is no governance, right? We were talking earlier about Rye and how it's like a money God because it's autonomous and free from human intervention support. EIP 1559, that's the same messages I see when I see the billboards or the road signs about in Seattle where I live, where there's political movements about, let's add in taxes onto soda or gas. That's not what we want for Ethereum to be. So the fact that this is even here is a little bit concerning. I don't want Ethereum to be a politically engaging thing.
00:48:31.982 - 00:48:52.566, Speaker B: It's supposed to be autonomous. There isn't supposed to be any sort of political rallying to try and change the direction of Ethereum. The direction of Ethereum should be the direction of Ethereum, which is autonomous and takes its own course. Again, we are in this early research and development phase of Ethereum, so that's why I'm okay with it. But over the long term, I don't want any sort of this activity at all.
00:48:52.668 - 00:49:18.394, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think I would agree with you. Right. So the only answer to can we completely neutralize all political decisions, basically, is to solidify your base protocol and don't make any further changes. And at some point that will happen to Ethereum. I think actually some point soon, in the next, like, three to five years, we'll get all of the core changes we need into Ethereum. In the same way that bitcoin is kind of like codified. It's solid.
00:49:18.394 - 00:49:57.686, Speaker A: There are no further changes, although there's probably one coming down the pike once issuance gets to zero and security drops. Maybe spicy there, but yeah, I agree with you. Ultimately, this has to happen with Ethereum. But in the meanwhile, we have this nice kind of fork choice rule that lets the community and social consensus ultimately decide. Anyway, David, let's get to the next news item, which is NBA topshots. Man, this thing's heating up. The dapper labs community company actually behind this is raising $250,000,000, David, at a $2 billion valuation.
00:49:57.686 - 00:50:13.534, Speaker A: I feel like I'm in 2017 massive. When I saw the telegram Ico here for billion dollars. Is that what we're looking at, or is there something here? What is this NBA topshot thing? What is dapper labs doing here?
00:50:13.652 - 00:50:46.730, Speaker B: Yeah, the numbers are absolutely staggering. A $250,000,000 raise, that's not the valuation. That's literally how much cash people are handing over to dapper labs at a valuation of $2 billion. And so dapper Labs is the team behind cryptokitties. And so they were one of the first teams to really experiment with NFTs on chain, and it was so incredibly successful that it clogged the chain back in 2017. It's a famous story. And so this is kind of like the payoff or the reward of being early and figuring out development issues in ethereum as soon as possible.
00:50:46.730 - 00:51:27.094, Speaker B: Right? The cryptokitties craze was absolutely phenomenal. It was massive. And it brought so many people into Ethereum, who, again, don't care about Ethereum. They only cared about the kitties and how unique they were, and they just came for the kitties. And so dapper Labs had that experience in 2017, and then they took that information, they put their heads down, they built for two years, and then they landed this NBA topshot deal, which is already pulling in millions and millions of dollars of revenue. It's an NFT system with the MBA, right? So MBA plus NFTs, and that's ran by the dapper Labs team. So congratulations, guys.
00:51:27.094 - 00:51:30.530, Speaker B: You guys earned it. Well done. That's a massive raise.
00:51:30.690 - 00:52:17.014, Speaker A: Yeah, interestingly enough. So I think one difference between 2017 is actually they're generating a lot of revenue, right? Like the firm has generated almost 100 million in NFT sales. Right? So the icos of 2017 weren't doing that. The other thing is, it's interesting that NBA Topshots is not built on Ethereum, so it's on this blockchain that dapper Labs has created called flow. And what it kind of reminds me of, what flow kind of reminds me of is it's much less decentralized versus Ethereum. It almost reminds me of like a binance chain for NFTs or like a coinbase for NFTs type of offering. I think ultimately all of this is synergistic with what's going on in Defi, but it's interesting to see how this is evolving across chains as well.
00:52:17.014 - 00:52:49.010, Speaker A: David, let's get to this exploit, which is our next topic. So there was an issue with Alpha Finance recently, and it's funny because we recently had them on for an AMA and asked me anything for the community. Like two days after that there was an exploit via Alpha finance, like $38 million lost, something like that. 37.5 million lost. What can we take away from this exploit?
00:52:49.430 - 00:53:25.418, Speaker B: Yeah, the DeFi summer cohort of applications of which cream is a part of. And even later, Alpha, I believe, are very big fans of integrations, partnerships building with other apps. And I think that's fantastic. The unfortunate side effect is that is a lot of surface area for attack. So that's kind of basically the story here. There was an economic exploit, I believe, that leveraged the Iron bank, which is this very interesting project, which I'm trying to get some content out of the bankless program on the Iron bank in the future. And unfortunately, because of the composability, they had a weakness that was exploited.
00:53:25.418 - 00:53:26.298, Speaker B: Sad.
00:53:26.474 - 00:53:56.898, Speaker A: Yeah, it's another reminder, and we'll talk about this when it happens, but it's another reminder that, hey, this is the wild west. This is risky. It's the frontier. Be careful what you put into these DeFi protocols. I was struck by how talented the alpha team is, but also, David, when we talked to them about the like, I was struck by the complexity of the protocol. Right. So these protocols are getting more and more complicated and sophisticated, and with that complication comes these sorts of potentials for backdoors and flaws.
00:53:56.898 - 00:54:28.622, Speaker A: Like, alpha was audited out like crazy, and this still happened. So the most powerful risk mitigator of any protocol is what we call the Lindy effect. That is how long it's been going on. The total locked value during its lifespan. The longer it lives without exploit, the longer you can expect it to live into the future. And Alpha is still a relatively new protocol. So I'm not blown away that this happened at all, but we should remember that this kind of thing does happen and can happen in Defi.
00:54:28.622 - 00:54:34.478, Speaker A: And just be careful out there, guys. Another thing to be careful of is volatility.
00:54:34.574 - 00:54:35.490, Speaker B: Liquidated.
00:54:36.250 - 00:54:50.614, Speaker A: Don't get liquidated. We saw a little bit of volatility, right, recently. These are like little bear markets, dips for ants. I feel like David, but this 30% dip that we had, I don't know, in the last week, it's over now.
00:54:50.652 - 00:54:52.118, Speaker B: Yeah, it was on Tuesday, Monday, and.
00:54:52.124 - 00:55:11.070, Speaker A: Tuesday, on Tuesday, liquidated a whole bunch of people who had loans taken out of ave curve, Unitswap, DFI. This is the biggest we've seen in d five so far, 1.6 billion in total liquidations. That tells me a lot of people are playing with some leverage here in these volatile markets.
00:55:11.410 - 00:55:56.490, Speaker B: Lots of people playing with leverage, which, of course, is arguably the reason why these markets tumble when they do tumble, is because people get really bullish, and then they take leverage because they want more exposure, and then things don't go their way, and so they get scared, and so they deleverage. And what happens when you deleverage is that you have to sell into the market to cover your position. And since things are already going down, it made you sell, which makes the market price go even down even more, which makes more people sell. And so we will watch the price of bitcoin, price of ether, price of these defi tokens, like, skyrocket. And that's a sign of people taking on leverage. And then people get out over their skis, and then things won't go their way, and then it'll tumble back the other way. It's not sustainable.
00:55:56.490 - 00:56:14.834, Speaker B: So these contractions, these retracements, are really important for a healthy market. Don't get wrecked, folks. Don't take too much leverage. The whole point about this cryptocurrency revolution is that it's a once in a lifetime event. And if you fuck it up because you took leverage, you're an idiot. Don't do like.
00:56:14.872 - 00:56:24.694, Speaker A: We're going west. This is the Oregon trail. Do not get killed somewhere on the trail. Just stay alive. That's your number one goal in the bankless program. Stay alive to fight another day. And leverage, man.
00:56:24.694 - 00:56:38.330, Speaker A: Leverage can kill you. Uniswap has processed over 100 billion in volume. There's nothing too much to say. We talk about Uniswap all the time. This is an incredible feat. It's a team size of eleven. And they did this with a protocol, David.
00:56:38.750 - 00:56:41.606, Speaker B: Yeah, team size of eleven. But they had Ethereum on their side.
00:56:41.728 - 00:56:58.114, Speaker A: Exactly right. So what we're really looking at is a team in kind of their garage, almost know the early Silicon Valley days that can disrupt entire industries. That's what crypto, that's what Ethereum gives you the power to do. So. Super exciting. Great milestone. Well done.
00:56:58.114 - 00:57:18.050, Speaker A: Hayden Adams, come on the podcast. We know you're listening. Okay. Coinbase powers Tesla, bitcoin buy. Feels like Coinbase is maybe evangelizing among the executives in corporate America about crypto and maybe bitcoin specifically. What's the take on this headline?
00:57:18.210 - 00:57:36.958, Speaker B: Yeah, the big news of last week's roll up was the $1.5 billion purchase of bitcoin from Tesla. And now we were finding out that they actually got that bitcoin on Coinbase. So really bullish for the Coinbase IPO, honestly. And I'm sure they took a nice fee out of that. That was probably pretty good for their bottom line.
00:57:37.124 - 00:57:59.922, Speaker A: Yeah, Coinbase is going to be one of the biggest ipos of all time. One of the biggest tech ipos of all times. Like looking at like 80 billion right now, if you're to believe. Kind of like futures volume. So that's going to be huge for the industry. Last thing, tell us about the crypto punks NFT movement. Someone bought this cryptopunk for $1.2
00:57:59.922 - 00:58:02.854, Speaker A: million, 650 eth. What's going on here?
00:58:02.972 - 00:58:24.650, Speaker B: Yeah, so cryptopunks are kind of one of the OG NFT phenomenons. I'm pretty sure they came back around in 2017 along with cryptokitties. And each one has different features, just like cryptokitties. Each one has different desirable aspects about them. Apparently people really value this particular one. I don't know. It's a guy in a bandana.
00:58:24.650 - 00:58:37.890, Speaker B: Funny thing enough, these things are, I think, 25 or 24 x 24 pixels. And I did the math, Ryan, it's 1.12 ether per pixel is the valuation on this NFT, which is insane.
00:58:39.190 - 00:58:55.560, Speaker A: Wow. What a punch per pixel. Maybe the most expensive per pixel art piece ever stole. Possibly. I don't know. So I look at this, David, and I don't understand why this is worth 1.24 billion, but that's okay.
00:58:55.560 - 00:59:12.186, Speaker A: Million. Excuse me, not billion, but I'm not in the culture. Again, I don't know. If we were to go to Christie's auction house and you were to tell me some painting was worth millions of dollars, I wouldn't know that either. But the market gets to decide the price of these things, which is super interesting.
00:59:12.368 - 00:59:15.040, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely crazy. The nfts are hot.
00:59:15.810 - 00:59:19.166, Speaker A: Let's go to takes. David, what takes? Do you want to start with?
00:59:19.268 - 00:59:20.686, Speaker B: Let's start with. Let's do it.
00:59:20.708 - 00:59:29.300, Speaker A: All right, let me start with this. So I tweeted this out. I said I found binance chain. David, do you remember those AOL CD roms? These come out.
00:59:29.830 - 00:59:31.234, Speaker B: I was actually too young for these, man.
00:59:31.272 - 01:00:08.554, Speaker A: You're too young, all right. I'm like the elder millennial here, right? So I remember we used to get them in our house. We used to play, like, frisbee with them, and AOL would just mass spam everybody these cds. And it was kind of like a gateway to try AOL, and it was really a gateway to the Internet. So people are comparing the binance chain transactions to Ethereum transactions. And when they do that, part of me gets it, but a huge part of me doesn't, because binance chain is basically. It can't be compared with an open, permissionless, credibly neutral settlement network like Ethereum.
01:00:08.554 - 01:00:25.714, Speaker A: It's a separate thing. Binance chain is AOL. It's not the Internet. Right. And I think people really need to understand that when you're looking at transactions on something like AOL, you're not looking at transactions on the open Internet. These are separate things. So binance chain is really like a permissioned walled garden.
01:00:25.714 - 01:01:04.682, Speaker A: And that is indeed, I think, synergistic with open networks like Ethereum, but they're not the same thing. If the Internet stopped at David, like, the Internet would suck. It was a completely different experience. All kind of curated applications from AOL and later, like, Time Warner, and it's nothing the same as the open Internet. So I guess my message is understand, like, we're in a bull cycle. So there's all of these narratives flying around, but understand the fundamentals of these networks are totally different. They are the AOLs out there that claim that they are open and that they're the same thing of the Internet.
01:01:04.682 - 01:01:23.990, Speaker A: And then there's the true Internet networks like bitcoin and networks like Ethereum that are permissionless, open, credibly neutral. Those are the things long term that are going to be important for this industry and for humanity. And the AOLs will just become like another CD. You play Frisbee. So anyway, that's the hot take it.
01:01:24.060 - 01:01:24.710, Speaker B: I love it.
01:01:24.780 - 01:01:31.786, Speaker A: All right, let's move to yours. Art is priced in ETH. David, did we already talk about that? Should we talk about that again a little bit?
01:01:31.808 - 01:01:57.630, Speaker B: Yeah, let's talk about it again, though. So Mariano and Eric Connor, talking about Mariano gives like the one fire emoji for the phrase tokens are priced in us dollar. And then two fire emojis for tokens are priced in ETH. But then three fire emojis for art price in ether. We talked about this earlier, of course, and Eric Connor just drives this point home. The future of art will be priced in Eth. The future of art is digital, and that digital art will be priced in ETh.
01:01:57.790 - 01:02:13.654, Speaker A: That's super cool. Do you think, though, that what could happen with the art scene, NFT art scene, is that it will start to be priced in stablecoins as well? Or do you think ETh preserves its unit of account in this world in kind of a different way?
01:02:13.772 - 01:02:26.310, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really good question. Definitely something to pay attention to. I don't have an answer for you. However, I will say that the NFT mania that's going on is the things being priced higher and higher and higher is going in a correlated fashion to the price of ether.
01:02:26.470 - 01:02:48.370, Speaker A: Yeah, it's super fascinating. Everywhere we see NFTs, they're largely, at least right now, denominated in ether. So definitely lends some credibility to that take. David, I want to get to this take. And this is a picture if you're watching on YouTube. What am I looking at in this first picture here? It looks like almost know the brain. It looks like neurons firing here.
01:02:48.370 - 01:02:49.774, Speaker A: What is this picture?
01:02:49.902 - 01:03:52.342, Speaker B: Yeah, I got this picture. It's from a Wikipedia article, but it's supposed to be some sort of like, networking infrastructure testing mechanism, right? And it came from a conversation I had with Trent and Zach Cole from Whiteblock, where whiteblock would try and recreate environments to test networks. They, like eos, hire them to test networks and other studios with working in distributed systems, would ask them to test their network, and so they would create this pseudo replication of the Internet, right? And this is the picture that we're looking at, right? It's like this branching, forking network of just connections and nodes. And it's supposed to be like a representation of just the way the topological map of the Internet, right? And will Price tweeted out an image that caught your attention? And I think if. Yeah, that's the one. That's the one. And this is a semantic network of ethereum, right? And so this is actually connections as to transactions and calls and things.
01:03:52.342 - 01:04:06.442, Speaker B: I'm not a coder, so I'm going to flub all these words, but all of the transactional data and contracts that people use on Ethereum, it looks the same. It looks the same. It looks like the same kind of structure, same kind of pattern. Semantic mapping. It's pretty cool.
01:04:06.576 - 01:04:48.922, Speaker A: This is like a superstructure that we see in nature all of the time. If you look at kind of in deep space, at how galaxies are arranged, it's kind of in this network, like fractal type pattern that we see in trees and veins and arteries, in pine cones and snowflakes and all of these things, this fractal pattern you wrote, this great priest David called ethereum, is an emergent structure. And it's funny because this is kind of how emergent structures look, right? Like they're kind of chaotic, kind of unpredictable, but they somehow chaotic organization. Okay, what is chaotic organization? Because I think that's important to the take here, right?
01:04:48.976 - 01:05:09.710, Speaker B: It's organization through chaos, right? Like, what happens when a bunch of chaos is allowed to just be chaotic over time? Eventually patterns emerge. Eventually we get order out of the chaos. And that's what we call Defi, right? Defi stratifies, it self organizes, it self creates. And that's the pattern that we're seeing here.
01:05:09.780 - 01:05:39.766, Speaker A: It's an emergent structure. All right, David, let's go with another Michael Saylor type take. He's buying more bitcoin. You know what's interesting, too, is he's buying bitcoin once again with convertible notes. So what's crazy here, David, is debt for everybody is relatively cheap right now, like home mortgages, if you look at that, on kind of the consumer side. But corporate debt is super cheap, too, because, of course, the Fed sets interest rates. Interest rates are at an all time low.
01:05:39.766 - 01:06:09.182, Speaker A: So if you're a big corporation with a decent balance sheet and some cash flows, you could borrow a lot of money. The question is, once you borrow that money. What do you do with it? Michael Saylor is borrowing that money at really low interest rates, like two 3% super low interest rates, because the money printer is cranking the money printer is printing. So he's borrowing all this money, more and more of it seems. What's he doing with it? He is investing that in crypto in particular. He's investing that in bitcoin. He's buying bitcoin.
01:06:09.182 - 01:06:35.206, Speaker A: So he's playing like this money printer arbitrage game where he's like, okay, print the money. It's super cheap. I've got a good balance sheet. I'm just going to take that money. No, I'm not going to plow it back into my business because I couldn't invest $600 million in my microstrategy business and grow my business analytics products. But I can take that money and I can go and buy bitcoin with it, and that's going to be worth a lot more later. It's crazy, dude.
01:06:35.206 - 01:06:52.718, Speaker A: This is corporate arbitrage once again. And it feels like he's found a hack. He's found some sort of hole in the matrix exploit that the other corporations haven't quite seen yet, and he's front running that. We're going to see more of this, aren't we? David, what's your take here?
01:06:52.804 - 01:07:18.898, Speaker B: Yeah, my take is actually, we forgot to include this in the news section that Michael Saylor. And Michael bought 600. Old news, dude. It's just not happening every week. This is a lesson in printability versus unprintability. Right. Michael Saylor can print as much microstrategy stock as he wants, and then he can take that and people are giving him dollars, which again, are printed, and then he's buying bitcoin with it, which is unprintable.
01:07:18.994 - 01:07:19.254, Speaker A: Right.
01:07:19.292 - 01:07:22.150, Speaker B: And so this is a lesson in printability versus unprintability.
01:07:22.510 - 01:07:33.280, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a fairly smart move. All right, guys, we're going to come back with what we're excited about and the meme of the week. But first, we want to talk a little bit about the sponsors that made this roll up possible.
01:07:34.050 - 01:08:36.370, Speaker B: Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield. And all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol if you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's v two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them.
01:08:36.370 - 01:09:24.474, Speaker B: Check out the power of aave@aave.com that's aave.com.

01:09:45.210 - 01:09:49.862, Speaker A: All right, David, we're back. Let's get into it. What are you excited about this week, my friend?
01:09:49.996 - 01:10:37.282, Speaker B: Yeah, I am excited about this podcast that I didn't know that we were going to produce until this week when I fell down this little rabbit hole that I went down. And so I'm on a quest to produce this article that's coming out, going to come out on the bankless newsletter at some point in time, all about how one of the most underappreciated things about the cryptocurrency industry is our culture, and it's one of our best exports. One of the cryptocurrency's best exports is our culture. And my ideas aren't really completely formulated around this. So I'm going around the ecosystem to talk to people who I know has ideas around this. So I've talked to Amin, Amin Soleimani, and then he forwarded me to this guy, Peter Pans, who's a big NFT fan. He's in the meta cartel, has his own podcast, wizard of the Dapps, and he wrote this four part series called before Bitcoin, the history of cryptography and the cyberpunks.
01:10:37.282 - 01:11:10.900, Speaker B: And so what I've done is I read every single one of them except I've recorded myself. And it's a fantastic story. It's a mind blowing story. And so we're going to get Peter Pan on the podcast to talk about what it was like to write that in addition to actually the audio of me reading it, it's a mind blowing story. I think it's going to be a really unique piece of content, and it just kind of illustrates. My big takeaway was that bitcoin and ethereum are just the latest in a multi decade, year long story of the evolution of cryptography. And so if you think that bitcoin just came out of nowhere and was like, oh, we have bitcoin now, it's like, no.
01:11:10.900 - 01:11:26.114, Speaker B: There were three decades of fighting between these cryptographers, cypherpunks and the US government to produce what we can now do today with cryptography. And it's an underappreciated story. It's under told, and I hope we can tell it on the Bankless podcast.
01:11:26.242 - 01:11:44.142, Speaker A: That sounds super awesome. This movement, we say so often, is a cultural movement. It's a social movement. And when you can get to the roots of where this social movement came from and what the belief structures are that formed it, I think you tend to understand crypto and what we're trying to do here, all the better. That sounds awesome, David. I'm excited to dig into that with you.
01:11:44.276 - 01:11:45.920, Speaker B: Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:11:46.610 - 01:12:09.198, Speaker A: I'm excited about the movement, too. And I feel like the bankless movement, the defi movement, is going mainstream. So, David, I got on the Andrew Yang podcast about a week ago. Yang speaks. So not with Andrew Yang? Not yet. That comes when hopefully Andrew Yang comes on the podcast. But they reached out to us because they were interested in crypto, basically.
01:12:09.198 - 01:12:31.190, Speaker A: They were interested in doing sort of a 101 on crypto. So we got on Yank speaks. That's kind of one mainstream type event. We're also getting Mark Cuban to come on the Bankless podcast because, no big deal. NfTs, he's really into DFI. So he's being scheduled on the podcast. We hit 25K subscribers on the Bankless newsletter.
01:12:31.190 - 01:12:38.782, Speaker A: So I feel like this DFI crypto, this bankless movement is growing, and I'm super excited about the progress we've made, my friend.
01:12:38.916 - 01:12:53.470, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. The bankless is a really scalable people. When I wear my bankless shirt, people are like, I don't know what that is, but I like it. And I'm like, you definitely know what it is, but I bet you do like it. So I think the future is bright.
01:12:53.630 - 01:12:57.380, Speaker A: All right, David, let's get to the meme of the week. I'm going to share this meme of the week.
01:12:57.910 - 01:12:58.626, Speaker B: Of the week.
01:12:58.728 - 01:12:59.826, Speaker A: What are we looking at?
01:12:59.928 - 01:13:07.314, Speaker B: All right, so we're looking at the Scooby Doo guy. I don't know what his name is, actually. Does that make me a boomer? I don't know. The blonde guy from Scooby.
01:13:07.362 - 01:13:10.280, Speaker A: A boomer would know who Scooby Doo is. I'm sorry.
01:13:11.370 - 01:13:29.818, Speaker B: Okay. And he's about to pull the mask off on the villain, and the mask on the villain says, on the blockchain. And then the caption is, let's find out who this really is. And then the mask is pulled off, and it's the ether logo. And it's actually built on Ethereum. Fun fact, when you see on the blockchain, there's a decent chance that they're actually just talking about Ethereum.
01:13:29.914 - 01:13:58.760, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Ethereum definitely underpins a ton of this industry and I think is underappreciated as a brand. Right. So even when I describe kind of what I do, they're like, oh, you're into that bitcoin thing? Bitcoin is the Coca Cola type brand that describes all of the other soft drinks. And it's interesting that so much of this is actually built on Ethereum, too. All right, that's the mean of the week. This has been the roll up.
01:13:59.130 - 01:14:00.242, Speaker B: Third week of February.
01:14:00.306 - 01:14:07.160, Speaker A: Week of February, guys. We're almost concluded. Almost the end of February. It's not leap year. No, we're almost done. February. That's it.
01:14:08.170 - 01:14:09.494, Speaker B: Disclaimers. Yeah.
01:14:09.532 - 01:14:10.602, Speaker A: Disclaimer. Worse.
01:14:10.746 - 01:14:11.850, Speaker B: Eth is risky.
01:14:11.930 - 01:14:22.682, Speaker A: Crypto is risky. So is bitcoin. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.
01:14:22.682 - 01:14:23.180, Speaker A: Thanks a lot.
