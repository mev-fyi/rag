00:02:54.510 - 00:03:01.714, Speaker B: It is the first week of December. It is Friday morning. It's time for your weekly roll up. What are we going to do today, David?
00:03:01.842 - 00:03:04.614, Speaker A: We're rolling them up. We are rolling them up.
00:03:04.732 - 00:03:33.374, Speaker B: We bring this to you every Friday morning. And this is our best attempt at taking everything that happened in crypto and consolidating this to about 25, 30 minutes. We do this in five sections. We hit market, we hit releases, we hit news, some hot takes, and then we end with what we are both excited about. This comes out, as I said, every Friday morning on both the podcast and YouTube. So you can check it in both places. David, you ready to get started?
00:03:33.572 - 00:03:45.010, Speaker A: It's an ambitious endeavor to try and roll up the week of crypto, and especially this week, because so much happened. But we are about to attempt just that. So let's dive right into this.
00:03:45.080 - 00:03:56.854, Speaker B: Okay? We are nothing if not ambitious, David Hoffman. So let's go. Bitcoin price. We're talking markets. What happened in bitcoin price from this week to last, my friend, from last week to this, I should say.
00:03:56.972 - 00:04:18.026, Speaker A: So. According to certain exchanges, we've actually passed previous all time highs. However, there hasn't really been that fanfare. And from what I can gather from the bitcoin community, they don't really count all time highs until we break $20,000. So while some exchanges have recorded all time highs, I think everyone is holding off the big celebrations until twenty k is breached.
00:04:18.138 - 00:04:32.260, Speaker B: That is funny. That price was just like tempting us, right? I think it's like maybe fortune or Forbes. I saw some mainstream media report the all time high, but I didn't yet see crypto, Twitter really celebrate it. So that must be why, right? It didn't quite get.
00:04:35.510 - 00:04:52.394, Speaker A: Interesting feature of the crypto world that each exchange has their own reporting of the bitcoin price. Therefore, there's not one central place of what is the price of bitcoin. And so there is no actual truth of what the bitcoin price is. So we don't actually know what the all time high is. And so people are just using like, all right, we'll just call it $20,000.
00:04:52.512 - 00:04:59.386, Speaker B: Only a matter of time, though, when you only matter of time. We're just creeping right up there. Okay, bitcoin on Ethereum, is that up or down?
00:04:59.488 - 00:05:09.226, Speaker A: That is down. That is down a pretty big amount. 3300 BTC left. The Ethereum ecosystem. We are now at 140,400. A bitcoin.
00:05:09.338 - 00:05:12.206, Speaker B: People selling their bitcoin, buying ether. David, what do you think?
00:05:12.308 - 00:05:15.982, Speaker A: Well, even if they did do that, it would still stay on Ethereum. That's true.
00:05:16.116 - 00:05:40.362, Speaker B: All right, let's talk ether price. Ether had a pretty good week as well, and had a good week on the network side. We're going to talk about that. But from a price perspective, we moved from about 500, something like the low 500, 504 on this Missari chart to 612 right now. Who knows what will be tomorrow morning, but possibly in that area. That's a big move. Yeah.
00:05:40.416 - 00:06:05.498, Speaker A: Ether rejecting the 500s pretty hard, but also not necessarily being accepted by the 600s. Ether price has been really volatile. It's gone from 620 down to 570, like three or four times lately, and it's just bouncing around. But to me, it looks like it's just a matter of time. It could be any minute now before the low 600 finally give way and it's just clear skies ahead of us.
00:06:05.604 - 00:06:12.142, Speaker B: But what's going to happen? Is it going to follow bitcoin? Does it need to wait for bitcoin, or is it off on its own crusade?
00:06:12.206 - 00:06:40.998, Speaker A: The second one, usually I wouldn't have such a clear answer, but December is the best month for ether. Historically, five out of five times ether pumps in December, and it also pumps versus bitcoin in December, and it is now December 4. Sometimes that historical price movements have started earlier in the last weeks of November. Sometimes it's actually been later into the first weeks of January. But historically, the last parts of the year are really bullish for ether.
00:06:41.094 - 00:06:58.210, Speaker B: All right, you heard it here, folks. Eth price going to launch in December or so. David Hoffman predicts it's not going to follow bitcoin. It's going to forge its own territory. This is such an interesting graph that I saw this week from. Who is it? I am Cryptowolf. I don't know who this anonymous account is.
00:06:58.360 - 00:07:01.998, Speaker A: He's a decently known crypto trader account. Yeah. Okay, fantastic.
00:07:02.094 - 00:07:32.554, Speaker B: All right. On the bottom is the bitcoin price from 2014 to about 2017 into 2018. So like the last bull run and you can see kind of the pattern that it makes from a crash all the way back to a recovery. And then in the top you see ether. And this is more recent. This is from the crash of 2018 2019 up until now. And this looks like a very similar pattern.
00:07:32.554 - 00:07:52.802, Speaker B: Right. We've talked so much about crypto market cycles happening in these fractal patterns. I guess the interesting question here is, is ether bitcoin circa 20 16, 20, 15, 20 16? And is it going to repeat this kind of price move? What's your take?
00:07:52.936 - 00:08:25.694, Speaker A: Yeah, I've always been a fan of this theory. People would say that maybe that's like overly simplistic or overly reductive. But I think at the end of the day, there's a common denominator. This industry moves in cycles. Ethereum has been one cycle behind bitcoin its entire lifespan. While I do think Ethereum moves at an accelerated rate compared to bitcoin, simply because it's kind of drafting in bitcoin's wake, I think it's totally valid to kind of compare bitcoin's previous cycle to Ethereum's current cycle, which means that we are just ready to lift off on EtH price.
00:08:25.812 - 00:08:50.290, Speaker B: But that also means because the numbers were similar, of course, market caps are different, but the actual unit numbers are similar. Bitcoin went from like 200 to 20,000 in the last bull run. If we repeated that in Ethereum, right, we'd be going from like 300 400, where we are now, to 20,000, possibly.
00:08:50.370 - 00:08:55.606, Speaker A: Well, yeah, the depth of this last bear market for ether was like 100 ish dollars.
00:08:55.708 - 00:08:55.974, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:56.012 - 00:09:07.606, Speaker A: And so maybe that kind of plays into the ten k meme. I think we're going to blow past ten k, but maybe not for that long. But yeah, that puts us in the right range if we want to compare cycle for cycle.
00:09:07.718 - 00:09:32.334, Speaker B: That is super bullish. And that would also be very crazy. These market caps are much higher, but this is something I found interesting. This is the new token terminal screen. And if you sort by, most people sort by market cap. But I like this metric, David, which is price to sales metric. And if you look at all of the crypto assets from a price to sales perspective, this is almost similar to a pe ratio.
00:09:32.334 - 00:10:06.622, Speaker B: There's also price to sales ratio in stocks. Ether right now is about 86 86 x price to sales zoom. I was interesting, like zoom stock. We're using zoom right now to record this. It's at about 90. So it has a higher price to sales ratio than ether and than Ethereum right now. And by the way, this means that Ethereum is like for your dollar invested in Ethereum, it is producing more fee revenue than Zoom shares right now.
00:10:06.622 - 00:10:21.378, Speaker B: Plus it has all of these other attributes like being an actual collateral money blinging, like a global money system growing like crazy. It just still at this price point, feels incredibly overvalued by these sorts of metrics. What's your take?
00:10:21.464 - 00:10:27.262, Speaker A: You mean undervalued? Undervalued, undervalued, yeah, you heard it here from Ryan. Sell your zoom stock.
00:10:27.406 - 00:10:36.918, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Exactly. Total lock value in defi that had a bump last week. Right? What was the change?
00:10:37.084 - 00:10:51.260, Speaker A: 614.1 billion to 14.7 billion in the last seven days. Meanwhile, DPI also DFI pulse's product has gone up from $108 to 116.30.
00:10:51.970 - 00:11:14.206, Speaker B: Pretty impressive. All right, so DFI had a good week as well. How about. Let's see here. Should we talk about stablecoins a little bit? We've now got 20 billion. We hit the 20 billion milestone in terms of the amount of stablecoins in crypto. The vast majority of that on Ethereum right now, that's a 300% year to date surge.
00:11:14.398 - 00:11:49.486, Speaker A: Yeah. The best thing to take away from this is like, this is stablecoins. The rise of stablecoins on Ethereum and just using crypto payment rails is indicative of the value of the technology in its purest sense. People that were like blockchain, not bitcoin, or like infrastructure, not non sovereign money, I mean, first off, they were wrong, but they were still right about the technology. And the $20 billion of stablecoins using this technology is indicative of how incredibly valuable this is. Simply as like payments infrastructure. Let's just get dollars onto crypto payment rails and use them.
00:11:49.486 - 00:11:59.410, Speaker A: And then the second to third, 4th order consequences of this is just like more liquidity for ether, more liquidity for bitcoin, more tools in your financial tool belt. Bullish.
00:11:59.830 - 00:12:24.666, Speaker B: Absolutely. Last thing that's bullish. We got to move on. DFI lending is at an all time high as well in terms of loans originated in compound in Ave. From last month to this month, there was an 88% month over month increase. So DFI loans, DFI protocols continuing to attract more capital and get larger and larger and larger. David, we spent a lot of time on market today.
00:12:24.666 - 00:12:28.618, Speaker B: Let's breeze through releases. What was the first release we should talk about?
00:12:28.704 - 00:12:32.138, Speaker A: I don't know. Did something happen this, like, I felt.
00:12:32.154 - 00:12:33.966, Speaker B: Like something big happened this week.
00:12:34.148 - 00:12:34.782, Speaker A: Happened.
00:12:34.916 - 00:13:03.494, Speaker B: Yeah, it was a big release. Ethereum yeah, it was Ethereum. The thing we've been waiting for for the last five years. Actually shipped, actually happened. This is the first block that we're showing you on screen. What about this? Not quite as inspirational as the genesis block of bitcoin, but certainly reflects the permissionless world of Ethereum. Somebody in the Genesis block wrote this.
00:13:03.494 - 00:13:05.654, Speaker B: Mr. F was here. Yeah.
00:13:05.692 - 00:13:19.562, Speaker A: So in each block in e two, you as a validator have the ability to graffiti something. So you get to write a short little snippet in the first block that was mined in Ethereum 2.0, Mr. F was here. Was graffiti. Apparently this is a reference to Queen. Mr.
00:13:19.562 - 00:13:30.618, Speaker A: Fahrenheit is something that Vitalik signed a piece of paper for forever ago. I don't know the full story, but yeah, it's definitely already a meme. And I'm looking forward to this meme, like, growing and maturing.
00:13:30.714 - 00:13:37.838, Speaker B: Not quite as inspirational as chancellor on the brink of a second bailout. But here we have it. We've launched Ethereum.
00:13:38.014 - 00:13:39.826, Speaker A: It's what it is.
00:13:39.928 - 00:14:07.062, Speaker B: What it is. Okay, let's talk about ether capital. This is super cool. I stumbled across this and actually, David, we're going to have Ether capital on the podcast I think we're recording next week. So sometime in December, you guys will check this out. But this is a publicly traded company that is primarily a holding company for ether. So they're on the Toronto Stock market Exchange.
00:14:07.062 - 00:14:35.150, Speaker B: So basically it's a canadian publicly traded company and you can buy them. And generally they're just holding ether on their balance statement. They do a few other things, but it's a way for investors to get exposure in their traditional legacy brokerage accounts to ether, the asset, just by buying this stock. And they are raising another 125,000,000 in common shares. Guess what they're going to do with this. David Hoffman.
00:14:35.230 - 00:14:37.058, Speaker A: I think they might buy ether with it.
00:14:37.144 - 00:15:03.050, Speaker B: I think they might. The last time they purchased was, I believe, in 2017, 2018. They bought at kind of a different price range, but they're gearing up to purchase and hold more eth. What's really interesting about this report is they actually go through and define what is valuable about ether the asset. And do you know what the core thesis is, David?
00:15:03.210 - 00:15:04.138, Speaker A: Tell me, Ryan.
00:15:04.234 - 00:15:05.770, Speaker B: It's triple point asset.
00:15:05.850 - 00:15:06.830, Speaker A: Oh, weird.
00:15:08.210 - 00:15:44.426, Speaker B: So we see some of these Ethereum narratives bleeding and making their way into institutional investment circles, into publicly traded companies. This is almost like the microstrategy of bitcoin, right? I don't know why this doesn't get reported, but there's a publicly traded company that only has ether on their balance statement and they're creating more common stock to go buy more ether. And they've got a great value proposition like delineated out, including risks and upside and all of these things for investors in a public report. I think that's pretty cool, man.
00:15:44.528 - 00:16:21.382, Speaker A: That is super cool. And hats off to these guys. They've been around, they've went through the bear market with the rest of us relatively quietly. I would say they helped. And super looking forward to having them on the podcast. There's about to be a ton of just overall bullcase for Ethereum podcast episodes coming out, so definitely stay tuned for that one. I've already sent this prospectus, I think is what this is to a few people in my circles who just would appreciate specific content that kind of fits like the legacy mold of what a report looks like.
00:16:21.382 - 00:16:35.274, Speaker A: This report plus the Mazari report on ether is really indicative of the different narratives and different just models of Ether and Ethereum that has really just come to be known as canon truth. And that is something that really, really excited about.
00:16:35.392 - 00:17:05.774, Speaker B: Yeah, that's part one of the story. Part two of the stories are actually staking too. So this is the first publicly traded company that is actually taking some of their ETH and staking it. The Internet bond concept, turning ether into a productive asset. Well, these guys are doing it. I don't think this will be the last publicly traded company to stake Ether. I think in the future, there could be a time in the future where we see most financial Fortune 500 companies and certainly tech companies with ether staking nodes.
00:17:05.774 - 00:17:36.890, Speaker B: Like that is the future. I would not be surprised in the office. Yes, I would not be surprised to end the decade with that as an outcome. So I'm sure there'll be more there. Let's talk about some of the staking rewards. So the exchanges are getting into the game. We've got Coinbase announcing the launch of Ethereum to staking as well, and Binance, of course they had to one up Coinbase and they're like, yeah, give us your EtH and we will double your rewards, your staking rewards.
00:17:36.890 - 00:17:41.550, Speaker B: Not quite sure how they're going to do that, but what's your take on this mean?
00:17:41.620 - 00:18:02.790, Speaker A: We knew this was coming. Centralized staking as a service provider. There's just too lucrative, it's too easy to make money. It's basically a free money service that, especially with things like Coinbase and Binance, is using infrastructure that they already have set up. This is one part good for Ethereum, because this is just how Ethereum becomes adopted. Right. Like we want Ethereum to be easy to use.
00:18:02.790 - 00:18:22.318, Speaker A: It triggers my defensive reflexes if too many centralized staking as a service providers crop up and start staking too much eth. That's not ideal. But for now I'm happy to see that the staking of ether is becoming industrialized and institutionalized. It's still important in the long term, for sure.
00:18:22.404 - 00:19:04.774, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. As long as there is a healthy balance, we will be monitoring that. Speaking of health, I guess this is a metric for health of the network. We've been talking a lot about Ethereum's future scarcity engine, EIP 15 five nine, which improves the gas markets on Ethereum both in ETH two and in ETH one, but also burns ETH as blocks are used. It's going to be really cool mechanism. There was a report put together, a whole economics analysis study on EIP 1559 by somebody I believe, maybe Tim rough. Okay, Tim Roughgarden from Cornell.
00:19:04.774 - 00:19:13.594, Speaker B: Anyway, what's the TLDR of this report? The report just came out. We've been waiting for it for several months now. What's the conclusion?
00:19:13.722 - 00:19:47.990, Speaker A: Yeah, Tim Roughgarden is an expert in his field. And so this has been a highly anticipated report that a lot of people that were putting on the brakes in EIP 1559 were like waiting to see this report until they took off the brakes. Right. A lot of people who were more cautious and wanted to just make EIP 1559 just go through a few more hoops. This was one of the last hoops that they were waiting for. So now that this is here, we have just a lot more confidence that EIP 1559 is going to do the things that we want it to. And so it's just full steam ahead.
00:19:47.990 - 00:19:50.714, Speaker A: Take off the brakes on EIP 1559.
00:19:50.832 - 00:20:25.406, Speaker B: Yeah, the summary that Tim came out with is basically, yes, it does. What it sets out to do, intends to do. From my analysis, and some prominent folks in the Ethereum development community saw this report and are saying the same thing. Yes, this is exactly what we needed. Full steam ahead. It seems like with EIP 15 five nine, that is good news. Speaking of full steam ahead, Vitalik put together an updated version of an Ethereum roadmap here, and it's good to see a number of these things with progress bars.
00:20:25.406 - 00:21:04.266, Speaker B: This time in particular, you might see sort of this green circle here, phase zero launch that has happened fully, but you can get like a bird's eye view of all of the different work streams that are going on across Ethereum and their progress toward completion. The next really big, I think deliverable, of course, is going to be phase one. But after that, the one I'm most looking forward to is this eth one to eth two merge. But in addition to these major milestones, all of this work activity is happening to continue to improve the Ethereum network. What's your take on this roadmap? David?
00:21:04.378 - 00:21:29.446, Speaker A: Yeah, this is how you understand Ethereum in all of its glory. Like every single component of Ethereum that's being in development, being worked on, being integrated is here. Vitalik's made it for you. Check out the link in the show notes. If you actually want to check it out, it will be made available to you. The inclusion of the progress bars is just a nice little thing for people who don't understand all of these things, which I don't understand like 50% of these things. The progress bars is nice.
00:21:29.446 - 00:21:35.850, Speaker A: It's like no cool. I actually know exactly how far along we are in these things, at least according to Vitalik's relatively unbiased head.
00:21:36.000 - 00:22:05.314, Speaker B: Yeah, it's also crazy, the construction process that you see here, because we're literally building a trust computer and we're doing it across all sorts of time zones and teams and geographies in decentralized ways. It's just amazing how this thing is being built. Just a crazy, cool, decentralized, bizarre way that it's all coming together and I love it. All right, speaking of releases, David, we should talk about the Ave v two on main net.
00:22:05.352 - 00:22:53.314, Speaker A: If you want to live a bankless life, you need to get a hardware wallet. There is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self sovereign fashion. That's why I have four ledgers that I use to manage my different crypto assets using the ledger live account as well. Ledger Live is like your home base for managing your Ethereum defi and crypto accounts. It does a really good job of aggregating all of your different Ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one. But you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is, and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page. One thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and Ryan talk about with the bankless skillcube enabled in the Ledger Live app.
00:22:53.314 - 00:23:48.382, Speaker A: So right now in the ledger live app, you can buy, sell, lend, swap and stake your crypto assets, which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skillcube. Something that's new to Ledger Live is ledger swap, where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application, ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on Ethereum and on bitcoin. If you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger, go to the blog post the power of Ledger Live on the Ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about. There's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet. I personally like the Ledger Nano X, but I also have both. They're both great options. When you own a ledger, you own your own assets in the way that they have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone.
00:23:48.382 - 00:24:53.962, Speaker A: So go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible. The bankless state of the nations are brought to you by Wyrn Wyrn is DeFi's first self building, community run project which I just get really, really excited about. Wyrn is a system that seeks out yield in DeFi and it does that in a number of different ways. A very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different DeFi experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token, right? And so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in Defi. For those who want to just earn yield on their stablecoins, the earn system is for you, where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and Wyrn will go and figure out which money market on DeFi in DeFi is producing the best interest rate, whether it's dytx, it's compound, or Ave. It looks around DFI to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stablecoins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn finance to get started. And also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing.
00:24:54.016 - 00:25:08.666, Speaker B: We should talk about the Ave v two on main net so Ave has been an important lending borrowing protocol and they just went live on main net. This team never stops shipping any highlights on v two that you want to emphasize.
00:25:08.698 - 00:25:45.050, Speaker A: David yeah, this is where the Ave protocol goes from being kind of backstopped by a centralized team to really being backstropped by the community and specifically backstopped by the Ave token. And the most important thing I think about V two is the inclusion of just like being able to stake your Ave to bear the risk of the protocol, but also receive extra rewards. And so that's a good token model in my eyes. Tokens that have risk in them should also have rewards. And that's how the Ave token is changing in this particular V two. That makes me excited about just like overall good mechanism design in the space.
00:25:45.200 - 00:26:17.970, Speaker B: Yes. Big release from the Ave team. All right, David, we should conclude releases and jump over to news. Some big news this week, too. The first is not the fact that Ethereum two is launched, but the fact that the Ethereum two launch actually made mainstream media CNBC. I've actually never seen a technical launch like this make mainstream media now, it wasn't like front page, I'm not sure that was reported on tv or anything, but this is some at least mild exposure to what's going on. What's your take here?
00:26:18.040 - 00:26:30.810, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting they didn't include Ethereum in the title. The title of the piece is the world's second biggest cryptocurrency getting a major upgrade. Here's what you need to know. But I mean, headlines are headlines. You read that, but you see Ethereum.
00:26:31.150 - 00:27:23.702, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think the biggest news this week is this, though, David, Visa partners with, this is in Forbes. Visa partners with Ethereum digital dollar startup that raised $271,000,000. When you get into the body of this, what this is actually saying is Visa is partnering with Circle to allow USDC circle stablecoin, that is primarily settled on Ethereum. Today. Visa is connecting its 60 million vendors, giving them the ability to essentially settle payment, settle receivable transactions using USDC as a stablecoin, eventually maybe issuing Visa cards against it as well. This is a huge win for stablecoins in general, for USDC encircle specifically.
00:27:23.702 - 00:27:53.602, Speaker B: But all of this is going to be using Ethereum as the final settlement layer because that's where USDC's liquidity lives, which is super exciting because I think it's part of the trend that we're going to continue to see, which is large payment processors and fintech companies are slowly migrating out existing banking infrastructure and swapping that out for crypto based infrastructure with ledgers like Ethereum. What's your take here?
00:27:53.736 - 00:28:27.246, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think that when Visa is running USDC through its credit cards that will be making a transaction on Ethereum. I think it's going to be like its own off chain, like l two. But ultimately, at the end of the day, the balance of USDC is held on Ethereum. Right. And so maybe different claims about one particular balance of USDC on Ethereum is being shuffled around in the visa network, and that doesn't make it to Ethereum, but the overarching balance of USDC is still determined by that's. Do you know what the actual nature of this is?
00:28:27.348 - 00:28:53.270, Speaker B: Yeah. So, I mean, basically, they will continue to do a ton of USDC transactions on their own private ledgers, right, side chains, like in their own databases. But ultimately, the USDC lives on Ethereum. So if you ever want to settle between visa and someone else, you might use something like Ethereum. Or you could just bypass that and use trusted side chains, if you will, like Coinbase, like Circle, like USDC.
00:28:53.610 - 00:28:57.400, Speaker A: It's claims for USDC in a specific.
00:29:00.810 - 00:29:27.426, Speaker B: The primary. I think the cool thing about this is essentially it's a swapping out of using existing financial banking infrastructure for assets that ultimately get settled on Ethereum. Right. And of course, you could still do these in your own private ledger and a lot of that transaction. Not all of these transactions will happen on the Ethereum network. Obviously, that would totally bog down the network. We don't want that.
00:29:27.426 - 00:29:59.062, Speaker B: But ultimately they can settle on Ethereum. What this also does is it gets visa into the Ethereum and crypto world. So now that they can support an ERC 20 like USDC, what other ERC 20s can they support in the future? What does this continue to unlock? So it's a baby step, but I think it's a super important step that in 2017, something like this would be, like, absolutely mind blowing. And now it's starting to happen. And I don't think the world has yet noticed.
00:29:59.126 - 00:30:05.994, Speaker A: No. The other thing it did is Ethereum always wins this thumb war. Right? Like Ethereum got put under visa.
00:30:06.042 - 00:30:06.206, Speaker B: Right.
00:30:06.228 - 00:30:14.250, Speaker A: And what does that remind you of? That's the protocol. Sync. Ethereum visa is now built on visa?
00:30:14.410 - 00:30:37.698, Speaker B: Yeah, well, yeah, absolutely. And I think more and more that will be the case with some of these fintech companies. David, another exciting development. I'm not sure if I have a link about it. Well, I've got my own tweet. Isn't that self serving? All right, standards in pores. They have this s and P 500 index, and they also maintained the Dow Jones index.
00:30:37.698 - 00:30:57.358, Speaker B: Well, in 2021, they're actually going to launch a crypto specific index. I think that's pretty big. That is piercing into the mainstream financial indices of the world, David. It's an important signal that mainstream finance is starting to take notice of what's going on in crypto. Any thoughts here?
00:30:57.524 - 00:30:59.626, Speaker A: No, I'm bullish.
00:30:59.818 - 00:31:33.020, Speaker B: All right, bullish. We should talk about bad gov and good gov. I feel like we have some things that the government is messing up or some actions that are maybe negative for crypto, but also some things that are positive for crypto going on. Almost every time when we do these roll ups, the first one, this is probably a bad gov. Thing is we've got this stable act, it's called legislation. That's just a bill right now, I'm not sure that it has a chance of passing, but can you describe what this bill is? This is A-U-S. Bill in Congress, right?
00:31:33.390 - 00:32:27.738, Speaker A: This bill, the reason why it's bad is, first off, it fundamentally misunderstands how these systems work, right? And so the maximum extent of this bill would hold any node providers or validator nodes or anybody doing any mining of Ethereum to be responsible for any sort of stablecoin financial activity that goes against laws, right? So if somebody makes a USDC transaction that quote, unquote breaks the law, you as a node operator of the Ethereum network, in the most strict sense of this interpretation of this bill, could be liable for processing that transaction. So what the fuck? Totally ridiculous. That doesn't make any sense. And it's also totally arguable that even with this legislation in place, this doesn't actually do anything, just a pure example of just bad regulation. It's disruptive of innovation and doesn't actually do anything good.
00:32:27.904 - 00:33:14.810, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think the big thing is the whole notion of this bill is very couched in. We want to help those who are in lower socioeconomic classes because stablecoins are predatory towards them. And I'm not sure that that is really, I'm not sure that anybody in lower socioeconomic classes are actually using stable coins today. I mean, there are things like short term loans and payday lending, that sort of thing. There's like lottery systems that. I think there's a strong argument that those things are predatory, but not stablecoins. I mean, stablecoins are just being used by a bunch of crypto geeks today like us, right? So there's that piece.
00:33:14.810 - 00:33:30.858, Speaker B: But the other piece is, in order to help this group of people, the legislation is actually saying that any stablecoin issuer would have to register as a bank. You have to get a bank charter, you have to essentially get the Fed's permission.
00:33:31.034 - 00:33:34.814, Speaker A: This includes protocols like makerdao, which is also ridiculous.
00:33:34.942 - 00:34:12.106, Speaker B: Absolutely. And of course, banks themselves have been known to restrict access to all sorts of people in the United States and obviously across the world and discriminate against them actively. And something like ethereum getting an ETH address, all you need is a keyboard and an Internet connection. And there's no, like, it's completely credibly neutral. It doesn't care how much money you have, how much you make, like what color your skin is, anything, and you can get a bankless bank account. So I don't know, David, do they just not understand what's going on, or is this, like, malicious?
00:34:12.218 - 00:34:35.470, Speaker A: This bill is not bankless. That is not what that is. All right, I want to do a quick shill here of gitcoins. Round eight just started. And center, which is basically the protective shield around the crypto industry from bad legislation like this. They've already made a blog post about how terrible this bill is, so go read that. I'm also going to include that in the show notes.
00:34:35.470 - 00:34:38.838, Speaker A: And also consider donating to coincenter's Gitcoin fund.
00:34:39.004 - 00:35:00.722, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. They're doing important work in DC. Let's talk. Good. You know, we've often said almost every week we see a new central bank talking about going digital. I think this is going to be a boon to crypto. Of course, this is not the same thing as crypto, but moving into the digital world is probably going to have a strong link with crypto.
00:35:00.722 - 00:35:25.778, Speaker B: The latest is the bank of Canada that is accelerating its digital currency plans. Do you know why they're accelerating, David? It's really because Covid. So the pandemic has kind of accelerated plans for all central banks to become a bit more digital, and that moves all central banking systems a bit more towards digital currency and ultimately towards cryptocurrency. Any takes here?
00:35:25.944 - 00:35:59.678, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's to be expected. There's going to be a constant, massive reorientation of the financial system over the next one to 510 years. I saw a meme recently. I won't try and describe it, but basically the central banks of the world are going to go and just route around the commercial banks of the world by issuing their central bank digital currencies. And then the meme I saw was like, well, then the commercial banks are just going to adopt cryptocurrencies because they're allowed to do that. And so there's going to be just a massive reorientation, and that's kind of the path that I see ahead of us.
00:35:59.764 - 00:36:39.862, Speaker B: Yeah. And it does feel like all of the institutions are scrambling to figure out where their new seat at the table is, and some of them don't even realize there's a new table set up, so haven't even begun to scramble, but they will find out soon. Hey, last thing we should talk about is this in China, do you remember that major crypto Ponzi scheme called plus token? Okay, so the chinese police have seized $4.2 billion. This is all funds from the Ponzi scheme plus token. They cracked down, they found the people behind it, and now they have confiscated the funds. How much bitcoin and ether is this, David?
00:36:39.926 - 00:37:01.410, Speaker A: Yeah, the chinese government sees 194,000 bitcoin and 833,000 ether. So the majority of this value, dollar wise, is bitcoin, like, roughly 75%. And then the remaining, there's, like, 20% of that is ether. And then there's some ghost chain coins as well. That's a lot of bitcoin. That's also a ton of ether.
00:37:01.750 - 00:37:04.580, Speaker B: It's more ether than the Ethereum foundation has.
00:37:04.950 - 00:37:05.554, Speaker A: Good.
00:37:05.672 - 00:37:09.910, Speaker B: That's crazy. But where is it going? This is the crazy part of the story. Where's it all going?
00:37:09.980 - 00:37:12.614, Speaker A: It's going to the balance sheets of the chinese government.
00:37:12.732 - 00:37:14.770, Speaker B: Yeah. It's going to their national treasury.
00:37:14.850 - 00:37:20.394, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, let's put that one in the bank and, like, all right. Staking on eth, too, right, guys? Wow.
00:37:20.512 - 00:37:29.834, Speaker B: So now the chinese national treasury has more funds than the Ethereum Foundation. I wonder how this all shakes out. Do they keep it? Do they sell it?
00:37:29.872 - 00:37:40.474, Speaker A: I want to know, how privy are they to the world of crypto? Are they, like, all right, cool, let's fucking dump this shit and get our cash and run. Or are they, like, sweet, we own part of Ethereum. What's their knowledge?
00:37:40.522 - 00:37:45.220, Speaker B: Like, there's probably a crazy story behind how they got the private keys, too.
00:37:45.910 - 00:37:47.234, Speaker A: Don't want to know that one.
00:37:47.352 - 00:37:55.346, Speaker B: I don't want to know that one either. Anyway, moving on. Okay, that's news hot takes. David, what are you thinking about this week?
00:37:55.448 - 00:38:13.686, Speaker A: Yeah, I was kind of alluding to it just now with the chinese bank digital currency. But the world of crypto feels like this asteroid that's coming to the world of finance, right? And everyone sees it. The central banks see it. The commercial banks see it. The payment processors see it. The people see it. And we're all reacting differently.
00:38:13.686 - 00:38:51.590, Speaker A: It's like, all right, how are we about to absorb this asteroid? And I feel like, for the people, the easiest answer and the easiest option is like, oh, we just buy bitcoin. We just buy ether. We just hop on board the asteroid. That's how we absorb that shock. Central banks are trying to absorb that shock by pivoting to central bank digital currencies. Payment processors are trying to absorb the asteroid by using crypto assets on their payment rails. Everyone's responding differently, but what we do know is that the entire financial world seems to be bracing for impact, for this massive, just, like, collision of two worlds that everyone thinks is going to happen over the next one to four years.
00:38:51.590 - 00:38:53.846, Speaker A: So that's my take.
00:38:54.028 - 00:38:57.618, Speaker B: So it's an asteroid for some, is your take, but it's not an asteroid.
00:38:57.714 - 00:39:02.994, Speaker A: For everyone, because it's not a destruction asteroid. It's just a big deal asteroid, okay?
00:39:03.052 - 00:39:26.830, Speaker B: It's just going to shake things up and change everything. It's going to be a reset in the way that the Internet was a reset for a whole bunch of countries and nations and that sort of thing. Okay. Got you. Yeah. Do you think all of them see it coming? Or are some just, like, the dinosaurs are just, like, walking around doing their thing, and suddenly the sky's on fire and all your friends are dead?
00:39:26.910 - 00:39:44.678, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. There's definitely going to be a spectrum of institutions that are doing a good job preparing for this, or totally naive. And the ones that are naive about crypto at this late in the game, the ones that are just putting a blind eye, they're not going to make it. They're not ready for what's coming.
00:39:44.844 - 00:39:46.086, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:39:46.268 - 00:39:47.974, Speaker A: All right, Ryan, what's your take?
00:39:48.172 - 00:40:09.886, Speaker B: Okay, so I was struck this week again by the inevitability of crypto. Right. There's obviously demographics in the favor. Who under 35 do, you know, favors gold over crypto? Right. Not a single person. Right. So, I mean, there's just this inevitability about it.
00:40:09.886 - 00:40:37.682, Speaker B: But the pandemic that happened this year, I feel, like, moved up the timeline by about three to five years on all of these things. And someone asked me, I tweeted something like that out, and someone asked were what were the factors? And I think it comes down to four things, probably for me. The first is the pandemic caused everyone to go a bit more digitally native than they previously were. Like, David, we've talked about before, you and I have never met in. Never.
00:40:37.756 - 00:40:38.042, Speaker A: Never.
00:40:38.096 - 00:40:44.422, Speaker B: Right. But we're able to accomplish everything we need to for bankless and for our work and for collaboration.
00:40:44.486 - 00:40:46.566, Speaker A: High functioning share of individuals.
00:40:46.758 - 00:41:12.306, Speaker B: Yes. But I spend more time on screens than I ever have, so does everyone I know. Basically, we're all more plugged into the digital. And so things that are digital will obviously benefit from that. Tech companies, for sure. But digital currencies and digital nations and digital worlds will benefit from this metaverse that we are starting to plug ourselves into. So that's number one.
00:41:12.306 - 00:41:30.646, Speaker B: The second is this decreased trust in institutions, right. There's this overall perception that governments failed with COVID whether to what degree that's true versus not. There's still the perception that our institutions totally failed us. Right. So we don't trust government anymore.
00:41:30.758 - 00:41:32.762, Speaker A: And that was true before COVID Too.
00:41:32.896 - 00:41:52.254, Speaker B: True before COVID But all of these things act as an acceleration, right? The digital was true before COVID but we've probably moved up the timeline for crypto three to five years because of the pandemic. The third is this. This illusion of money. And that's all money is. I'm reading that Jacob Goldstein book that you recommended to me, David, on money. Right? Yeah.
00:41:52.292 - 00:41:53.950, Speaker A: We're going to ask him to come onto the pod in the future.
00:41:54.020 - 00:42:18.338, Speaker B: Oh, he needs to, man. But his basic premise is, from the very beginning, he goes through the history of money. He's like, oh, money is just a belief system, right? Something we said often on bankless. And it is. Well, what happened in Covid is the illusion of money just became less real. Why? Because we're getting helicopter money. We're printing it, we're getting checks, and it's like, oh, this scarce asset that we thought you had to go work to earn.
00:42:18.338 - 00:42:40.942, Speaker B: Well, now the government is sending us checks for this money, and they could just print it at a whim. And so we start to think of ourselves, well, maybe it's not that scarce. And why are we paying taxes? And then we start to think too much about money. And when you start to think too much about an illusion, it's like a magic trick. You start to think about that illusion. You're like, well, it's gone. It's not real.
00:42:40.942 - 00:43:05.910, Speaker B: Like the magic leaves. So there's an element of that. We're thinking more about money. And so the illusion is sort of dissipating into this mirage. And that's going to corrode the fiat system, I think, in favor of crypto. And the last is this, an acceleration of central bank digital currency. And the reason they're doing this, of course, is because modern monetary policy requires it.
00:43:05.910 - 00:43:57.798, Speaker B: In order to get all of the dials you need, like negative interest rates or the ability to incent people to spend money or save money. It's really valuable to have a centralized bank digital currency where you can tweak those styles a little bit. Like, we're at QE maximum. We can't even do any more QE. So that, as a monetary policy measure, has kind of extended its life. And the only thing we can do now is digitize all of our fiat money and effectively play with more of the dials. So that if you own central bank digital currency in your digital wallet, let's say, well, this particular month, the Fed has dictated that we're actually going to decrease rates by 1%, and you're going to get negative yield, and there's kind of nothing you could do about it.
00:43:57.798 - 00:44:28.802, Speaker B: The fed really needs these types of knobs. To do what? Helicopter money to change kind of yields in the way that they need to in the future. So all of this, David, I feel like, has totally hit the accelerator, hit the gas pedal on the coming of, like, without Covid. And I'm not saying Covid is a good thing, I'm just saying this is what's happening. Crypto would probably take another three to five years to get to the place where I think it's going to be in the next couple of years. Right?
00:44:28.856 - 00:45:07.802, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense to me. I'm reminded of our episode with Ben Hunt, which we labeled like the people's narrative. And what he talks about with his newsletter, Epsilon theory, is he talks about the alpha and beta of markets, which are like the fundamentals, but the epsilon, which is what he claims to be equally important as part of markets, is like, people's perceptions of what's valuable, people's thoughts about what's valuable. And I'm also reminded of a lot of the work that Brandon Quiddom has been putting out lately called bitcoin. And the fourth turning. Fourth turning is this book about how there's this time period, called a seculum, of 90 years long, and it's basically one long lifespan. And how there's always this turning of the wheel.
00:45:07.802 - 00:45:46.730, Speaker A: Like roughly every 90 years, there's this big just shift, this cataclysmic change in perception, usually correlated with some event, but not always, but it's just a complete restructuring of how people think about the world. And that's what I'm seeing with money managers like Paul Tudor Jones who are waking up to bitcoin. That's people understanding that ethereum is the last bastion of yield in the world. And then exactly what you were talking about, about moving digitally sooner, faster, quicker. The world perception is reorienting now. We're losing trust in institutions, we're gaining trust in cryptocurrencies. And just all at once people's focus and attention.
00:45:46.730 - 00:46:07.682, Speaker A: We keep using that Sauron image of the Eye of Sauron. If the eye of Sauron is like one amalgamation of everyone in the world, it's redirecting focus into different places, different solutions, different financial systems, different different realms of existence in the metaverse, in the digital world. And it's all happening at once. And so I totally see it, too.
00:46:07.816 - 00:46:13.362, Speaker B: Paradigm shift. All right, David, let's talk about what are you excited about these days in crypto? Yeah.
00:46:13.416 - 00:46:56.514, Speaker A: In the same vein of things moving online, I'm really excited for new friends to come into the world of ethereum over the next one to two to three years, this is the time where people, where Ethereum as a community expands, this is where we welcome in new people into the world. Right? And so I'm excited to see all the new people come. I really want to meet them. I want to see who they are. Why are they coming to Ethereum now? What is their perception of ethereum as a newbie? Crypto has a little bit for everyone. And as Covid rears its big, ugly head yet again in this big wave, we're all stuck at home now. And not only does crypto provide you financial tools, but it also does a lot of other stuff, too.
00:46:56.514 - 00:47:26.940, Speaker A: There's a lot of positive 2nd, 3rd, 4th order consequences that comes with stuff on ethereum. That's community. That's like collaborative projects, that's mutual endeavors, and it's doing it in an online, no contact environment. So as people are shut in, they're going to learn about Ethereum and they're going to find their niche in Ethereum. They're going to join the community, they're going to join the conversation. Our community is going to be richer as a result of that. And I'm excited to just with open arms, everyone that comes in, say hi.
00:47:27.390 - 00:47:40.046, Speaker B: That's so cool, David. I mean, it could be the case. The smartest people in crypto haven't even joined crypto yet, and they're coming, like in the next generation, a bunch of interesting people are going to enter this space. Very exciting stuff.
00:47:40.148 - 00:47:41.658, Speaker A: Yeah. What are you excited about, Ryan?
00:47:41.754 - 00:48:09.414, Speaker B: All right. I feel like I'm excited because we are so early. The three most important events, in my opinion, in crypto, January 3, 2009, the launch of bitcoin. Right. July 30, 2015, the launch of Ethereum. And then just this week, December 2, 2020, the launch of ETH two and the Ether bond, and the last one. At each of these events, they were barely noticed by mainstream media, including the last one.
00:48:09.414 - 00:48:33.102, Speaker B: Right? There's 5000 people on the live streams that we did for the Genesis block. Just 5000. Right. I mean, if people knew the significance of this, it would be broadcast across CNBC and CNN and all major media. And it wasn't. Which makes me all the more bullish because neither was the launch of Ethereum, neither was the Satoshi white paper and the launch of bitcoin. So number one, we're early.
00:48:33.102 - 00:48:53.334, Speaker B: That's pretty exciting. The second thing is the truth is now out there, David, we talked to Masari. They got the narratives right. Mainstream crypto media is actually starting to get Ethereum. Right. And what do I mean by, like, they're starting to understand ether as an asset. And I feel like that seed has been planted from the Masari report.
00:48:53.334 - 00:49:09.674, Speaker B: We did state of the nation on it. Here's a quote. It is very likely that once ETH one merges with ETH two, Ethereum will not only become the most secure blockchain, but also the one with the most credibly low monetary policy. Right. A scarce asset. ETH is money. That's what we've been saying for the last two years.
00:49:09.674 - 00:49:23.470, Speaker B: And the narrative seed is now planted. We don't even have to do anything. That seed is planted. It's just going to continue to grow and it's almost inevitable going back to that. So we've launched. We're early. The seed is planted.
00:49:23.470 - 00:49:43.974, Speaker B: I feel like the future is now inevitable. It's just going to continue to grow and I'm excited to be part of it. Along for the ride, as they say. We're going to do our little part, but so much of this is just going to grow just based on that wheel you're talking about. It's kind of unstoppable at this point.
00:49:44.092 - 00:50:06.634, Speaker A: Yeah. And this is why community in crypto is so incredibly important. Like Ryan, you were beating the drum. I was beating the drum. Anthony was beating the drum, Eric Connor was beating the drum about how some of the economics of Ethereum are going to turn it into the coolest blockchain ever, basically. And that is like the ethos money narrative. The ETH is bond, like the security of the Ethereum network.
00:50:06.634 - 00:50:38.246, Speaker A: All these things that we've been beating the drum for the last two years finally coming into reality as we said they would. And now, now, like you said, it's bubbling up to places like Missari. And so we couldn't have done that without a community of people all saying the same things. That's where that came from. And so if you ever in the depths of the bear market said ETH is money, or any of the other things like triple point asset, like secure, most secure blockchain, reduce issuance for proof of stake, reduce issuance via EIP 1559. You had a part in that role as well?
00:50:38.428 - 00:50:55.950, Speaker B: Absolutely. All right, David, I think we went a little bit over, but there's just so much happening this week. You guys needed to know. We rolled it all up for you as we do Friday mornings. Hope you're enjoying yourself and you enjoy the week again. This has been the weekly roll up with David Hoffman and Ryan Sean Adams from bankless.
00:50:56.610 - 00:50:59.260, Speaker A: December is the best month for ether. Fucking send it.
