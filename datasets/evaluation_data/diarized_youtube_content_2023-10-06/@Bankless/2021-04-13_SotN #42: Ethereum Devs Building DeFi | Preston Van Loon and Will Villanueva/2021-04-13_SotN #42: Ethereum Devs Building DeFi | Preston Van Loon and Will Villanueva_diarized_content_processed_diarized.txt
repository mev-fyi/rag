00:00:07.450 - 00:00:30.134, Speaker A: Hey, guys, welcome to another state of the nation episode. I'm Ryan. Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman. This is an episode where we, this is a show, rather, where we talk about what's going on in crypto. We zoom in on one item, we relate it to some of the big picture stuff we discussed in the podcast and the newsletter. We try to drop some insights and action items to you as well.
00:00:30.134 - 00:00:36.598, Speaker A: This is streaming live right now on YouTube. This also comes out on the podcast. David, how are you doing today?
00:00:36.764 - 00:00:47.414, Speaker B: Oh, absolutely fantastic. It's Coinbase week. It's all time high day. It's building day. There's so much to talk about, which is why we actually have two guests today on today's state of the nation.
00:00:47.462 - 00:00:49.450, Speaker A: Because what are we talking about then?
00:00:49.600 - 00:01:28.646, Speaker B: Yeah, so some interesting projects have come out with a slightly different flavor to them. I would say they're really cool projects in of themselves, but it's also the people behind these projects that I think is also uniquely interesting. We have people who have been in the actual Ethereum protocol building the Ethereum protocol. Preston Van Loon and Will Villanova. Hopefully I got that pronunciation right. I forgot to ask him ahead of the show. Preston Van Loon has been with the prismatic team building out eth two, and Will has been doing r and d with phase two, the sharding aspect of ethereum two in his past as well.
00:01:28.646 - 00:01:39.430, Speaker B: And so the throughline here is that we have Ethereum builders turning into app builders, and that is a unique story that we have not yet seen coming out of the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:01:39.590 - 00:02:15.602, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that also gives them a unique perspective too, David, on both the protocol layer on Ethereum and also the app layer. And you know what, David? I won't be able to help myself. I'm definitely going to ask some eth two questions at the very end of this because I just want to, like, we're five months into eth two staking launch, what's happening next, how they think it's gone, timeline, that sort of thing. So we'll try to fit that in at the end. David, what is new in the bankless community? We got to talk about bankless badge week. That starts next week. So next Monday, let's see, Monday, the April 19.
00:02:15.602 - 00:02:17.890, Speaker A: What is bankless badge week? What are we doing?
00:02:18.060 - 00:02:24.682, Speaker B: I thought it was bankless. Multiple badge weeks. It's badge week that lasts two weeks.
00:02:24.736 - 00:02:25.530, Speaker A: How's that?
00:02:25.680 - 00:02:56.742, Speaker B: Badge weeks? Yeah, so we've been hammering this out in previous episodes, and so we finally figured out the raffle giveaway agenda. First week is all about baps. All about baps. People with the bankless badge are going to be getting baps. And that's what these are. And so there are only six baps left, which means only six more people will ever get the shirt that you are seeing Ryan wear right now. And so that's pretty cool.
00:02:56.742 - 00:03:02.390, Speaker B: And then that is week one. And week two will be announced soon.
00:03:02.540 - 00:03:22.698, Speaker A: Yeah, week two. The rumor is the raffle weeks, it's going to rain raffles for the next two weeks starting on the 19th. The rumor is the last day of the raffle. We will be raffling off one eth, sir. Wonder what the price of one ETH will be at that point. Could it be 2000? Could it be 10,000? We don't know. But one EtH is one EtH, and.
00:03:22.704 - 00:03:24.350, Speaker B: That'S one EtH is one raffling.
00:03:25.250 - 00:04:00.326, Speaker A: And for those of you who don't know, the way to get a badge is you can become a bankless subscriber, get a badge. But we're doing this raffle really because we want a lot of the people who have subscribed already and have a badge link somewhere in their email to go back through. Make sure you claim your badge so you can participate in these raffles. We want everyone who is a full bankless subscriber who already has a badge link to go claim their badge. That's what badge week is all about. So go do that. This is what you're seeing on the screen if you're viewing this in video, is how you enter the raffles when they come in.
00:04:00.326 - 00:04:19.550, Speaker A: This is a grid plus raffle that we did previously. You just connect your wallet to it has to have a poet badge in it. Could be on XDI, could be on Ethereum mainnet, and then you're entered in the raffle and it randomly picks a winner. Every single day is how we're going to be doing this. So super exciting. That is happening soon.
00:04:19.700 - 00:04:38.902, Speaker B: Yeah. Just to reiterate, if you are already a bankless subscriber, you can go get your badge right now. You got to peruse through your history of your email inbox to go claim your badge and then future raffles. If you want access to future raffles, you can go and become a paid subscriber to bankless and then you will get your badge on the first of the month.
00:04:39.036 - 00:04:54.890, Speaker A: Yes. May 1 is when we mint those. If you're looking for an email, specifically search for lucas@banklesshq.com. He's going to hate me. But that's where the email is coming from. It's all coming from Lucas. He is the master of minting, the master of coin, maybe I should say, at bankless.
00:04:54.890 - 00:05:20.302, Speaker A: All right, what else? We have Hester Purse commissioner, crypto mom. Turns out she's also defi mom. We had her on the podcast episode released on Monday. That was just a fantastic episode. Everyone should go listen to that to figure out how regulators, at least the good ones, how they think about crypto, and more importantly, how they think about DeFi specifically. Any takeaways you want to mention from that episode, David?
00:05:20.446 - 00:05:53.760, Speaker B: Yeah. The biggest complaint, I think, out of the crypto space is the lack of clarity that the SEC has provided our industry. And I think that's something that Hester purse is on a mission to help solve. And I feel like that's why she's coming on to shows like ours, to help explain her thoughts and her thinking about how things could be and what she hopes to have as a regulatory relationship with our industry. So that was my big takeaways is Hester's trying to make things really clear. The other takeaway I have is that she loves the Bankless podcast, which is.
00:05:54.450 - 00:06:35.430, Speaker A: That was awesome. Not only Hester, but apparently the SEC, members of the SEC listen to bankless podcasts on a regular basis, which I'm not sure if I should be excited or terrified, but I'm more excited, especially after that conversation with Hester. The last thing I'll say about this is it feels like 2021 could be a time for a blank slate in crypto. Gary Gensler is the SEC commissioner. He is coming aboard as part of the new administration. So there really does seem to be a push to get some things right, provide some of that clarity you were talking about, David. All right, I've got to start with the question I ask you at the front of every state of the nation episode.
00:06:35.430 - 00:06:38.490, Speaker A: David, what is the state of the nation today, sir?
00:06:38.640 - 00:06:49.630, Speaker B: The state of the nation. This is a good one. Pioneering. We are pioneering. So in multiple different fronts and always state of the nations are always mean multiple things in multiple different ways.
00:06:49.700 - 00:06:52.250, Speaker A: I can't believe we haven't used this one before. Pioneering.
00:06:52.330 - 00:07:13.190, Speaker B: There's a decent chance that we have if we did, it was one of the early ones. Yeah. So we are pioneering into the world of the Nasdaq today or this week. And so coin is getting listed on the Nasdaq tomorrow. Is that why some of the crazy price action is happening right now? Is that why ether is currently breaking through all time highs all right.
00:07:13.340 - 00:07:15.014, Speaker A: What's coin for? People don't know.
00:07:15.132 - 00:07:47.310, Speaker B: Oh, Coin is the ticker symbol for Coinbase, which is going to be listed publicly. So that is going to happen tomorrow. That's going to cause a bunch of news. The bankless opinion, we put this out on the market Monday piece yesterday is that no matter what the valuation is on day one, coin pumps price go up. Perhaps the new meme stock. That's my predictive statement about the future, not financial advice. But we are not only pioneering into the Nasdaq, but we are also pioneering with new Defi apps.
00:07:47.310 - 00:08:13.902, Speaker B: This is what we are going to get Preston and will on to talk about shortly is that elements, which is Will's project is pioneering into the world of splitting one token into two, the principal and the yield. And then Preston's project is pioneering into the synthetic asset world of producing TCAP, which is the total crypto market cap. So new Defi apps building on top of other Defi apps and also allowing other Defi apps to build on them. Pioneering new surface area in Defi.
00:08:14.066 - 00:08:31.102, Speaker A: Guys, you will not want to miss this upcoming brilliant conversation with these two fantastic e, two developers who are also now developing DFI protocols. But before we get to the conversation, we want to tell you about the sponsors that made this state of the nation episode possible.
00:08:31.236 - 00:09:09.974, Speaker B: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on Ethereum, input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while, and we'll say it again. Dows have money and they are in need of labor.
00:09:09.974 - 00:09:38.434, Speaker B: If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap? Dow, no matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a Uni grant@unigrants.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go. That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless.
00:09:38.434 - 00:09:43.314, Speaker B: And you can do the same for your project. Thank you. Uniswap for sponsoring bankless.
00:09:43.442 - 00:10:00.838, Speaker A: Metamask is your go to wallet for the bankless journey. If you're going bankless, you need metamask, period. Browser and mobile. Get them both. This is your tool to unlock the world of defi. Here's my favorite part. Now you can swap tokens directly in Metamask with a single swipe.
00:10:00.838 - 00:10:23.134, Speaker A: This has got to be the easiest way to trade Ethereum tokens. Choose a token, you own a token to exchange it with. Get your quotes. If you like what you see, you hit swap. That's it. What makes swap so useful is what happens behind the scenes. It compares Dexs, aggregators and market makers to find you the best price with the lowest network fees and the least slippage.
00:10:23.134 - 00:10:40.250, Speaker A: This means you can swap a wider range of tokens, and swaps can even automatically split up your trade to give you access to better liquidity. You don't even have to think about it. Try it out. Download metamask for desktop or mobile now at Metamask IO and start swapping.
00:10:42.270 - 00:10:51.820, Speaker B: All right, bankless nation, we are here with Preston Van Loon and Will Villanova. Guys, welcome to the show. Thanks so much for coming on.
00:10:52.190 - 00:10:53.820, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having us.
00:10:55.630 - 00:11:44.300, Speaker B: I'm going to do my best at your bios, and then I'm going to hand it off to you to help fill the gaps. But Preston, you are the founder at Prismatic Labs, which is perhaps the most downloaded eth two client. I think it has the most ETH staked in it, so congratulations to that. And Preston's been working on Ethereum ever since he was full time at Google and then started working just on Ethereum on the side, out of passion. And then I believe what happened is Vitalik yoloed a thousand eth into the prismatic treasury, and that's what really enabled you guys to go full time at prismatic. And then, will, you were part of the Quill team at consensus doing R D on the sharding side of things, so specifically phase two. And now you are working as the CEO of Element Finance, which is what we're about to get into.
00:11:44.300 - 00:11:51.614, Speaker B: So, Preston, let's start with you. Give you a chance to correct any errors in the bio that I might have just made and also expand on it as well.
00:11:51.812 - 00:12:44.270, Speaker D: No, that was pretty close. So, yeah, I was working full time at Google and I was working on ads and ads are not very globally impactful, at least positive to most people. I mean, they help people find products and whatnot, but it's not what I was interested in. And I found Ethereum at the tail end of 2017, kind of when icos were getting big and cryptokitties and all this kind of stuff, and seeing like, wow, Ethereum has a lot of potential use cases, but it's super kind of maxing out right now, kind of slow. So I wanted to get involved to the protocol layer with e two. So at the beginning of 2018, I ran into Raul Jordan online, and he and I started prismatic labs with Terrence and Nishant. We're the four founding members of Prismatic, and we just kind of boondon lit through all of 2018.
00:12:44.270 - 00:13:45.090, Speaker D: We got some grants during that year, but I think it was the Yolo grant that really signaled the confidence of the EF and of the community that if we all quit our nice jobs, that we're going to be okay. None of us had any ether at the time. We were just kind of interested. So it was a big risk, but it really paid off. I mean, we have an amazing community, and it's been really good, but I still have this passion for how do I further increase my impact? And so we started Cryptex finance as a moonlight project to prismatic. So I've been still working full time as prismatic, but on the side working on Cryptex, trying to build a new financial product, mostly for retail investors. Like, if you talk to normal people, they know bitcoin and they might know Ethereum, but they don't really know how to invest in everything.
00:13:45.090 - 00:13:54.950, Speaker D: They know there's a lot of cryptocurrencies, but they don't really know, how do I get into the whole market? So that's kind of what we're trying to solve with Cryptex and TCAP.
00:13:55.290 - 00:14:04.346, Speaker B: Awesome. And, yeah, we are going to get into the details of each of your projects in just a sec, but will maybe explain a little bit about yourself and your background as well.
00:14:04.448 - 00:14:41.542, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. So similar to Preston, actually, I was also in the ad space and saw that it wasn't moving towards the greater good. And then on the tail end of 2017, hopped into the space. I'd been following it for a while and built the bounties network at the time, built that from the ground up. We did some of the contracts that gitcoin uses as well. So we were pretty close to the Gitcoin team. And then sort of after that, I was making a decision whether to I kind of had two routes that I was going to go.
00:14:41.542 - 00:16:28.738, Speaker C: I was very passionate about the breaking DeFi space, and at the time I had a friendship with Fernando, who is the CEO at Balancer, and actually almost joined Balancer as the CTO there, but ended up instead. At the time, Joe Lubin had asked if I could dive into some of the research on e two, help look into some of the areas. And so I ended up doing that, and I was really excited about that, helping scale things, diving in a bit deeper, working closely with the e two research team and a lot of bright minds there. So I did that for a while. We did a lot of research and development on what do shards look like in the future? How do we generalize them, how do we bring wasm onto them, how do we make it so e two in the long term can serve many different types of blockchains and many different structures that can grow on that. And so we explored a lot there, which is really solid, and then also ended up working on some research on eth one and actually put forward an EIP 29 38 on account abstraction, which brought some of the research we had done on ETH two into sort of the stateless world and some of the generalization we wanted to bring into eth one. And we put together an implementation in the go ethereum client and did a bunch of simulations on that and saw how that could improve some of the execution currently on Ethereum as well.
00:16:28.738 - 00:17:04.450, Speaker C: And all of that was a part of a team quilt that I had started and had grown to just work and further develop and research things in the space. And so quilt is still moving forward strongly. And about six months ago, I had been really excited about some of the developments in the DeFi space, kind of going back to some of my roots and almost joining and building balancer a few years ago kind of recentered around that. And so that's what has brought me here with element.
00:17:05.990 - 00:18:00.838, Speaker B: Very cool, very cool. So, like we alluded to at the beginning, the reason why we have both of you guys on here is that you guys are both building cool new DeFi apps with a unique perspective of coming from the Ethereum side of things. And so that's where we want to end up with the conversation is like, how has your experience building Ethereum translated into skills building defi apps? And then also, why have specifically you guys chosen to build on the app layer now instead of a year ago or perhaps a year from now? Why now and then also perhaps some conversations about what's surprised you about the trajectory of Ethereum, both at the protocol layer and at the app layer. But first, we want to start with the actual details of your projects. And so Will's project element got announced first. So we're going to start with element. And so will, can you kind of give us the bird's eye view, bird's eye pitch of element, and then we can go in from there?
00:18:01.004 - 00:19:14.910, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. So the element protocol, basically for the casual user, average user, they can come to the protocol and they can purchase bitcoin, ETH, Dai or USDC, and they get it at a discount. And essentially that can be translated into securing a fixed rate of income on that purchase. So if you're looking at 10% fixed rate APR on ETH, and you're looking at over a year period, then you can secure eleven ETH that can be redeemed a year from now. And so we make that process really simple, we make it really easy, and we let those users, in reality, avoid a lot of the issues around variable APR, gas issues, having to manage their funds, which is really cool as far as how it works behind the scenes. We essentially take positions that current defi users are already staking in, specifically in urine. And we split that into two new tokens, so we're able to represent the yield that's gained in one token and then the principal.
00:19:14.910 - 00:20:05.920, Speaker C: And essentially for users who are already staking, they're given further avenues of revenue. So they can go ahead and take those two tokens, they can provide liquidity on an amm, and they can actually get higher apy off that. But also what it allows them to do is it allows them essentially to sell their principal and give them a bit more capital efficiency. They can sell their principal and they can gain more liquidity to get exposure to more and more interest. And essentially, when they're selling their principal, they're selling their principal as a fixed rate of income. And so that's for the casual user, basically, it's subsidized by these more active users who are actively using their funds and selling their principal as fixed rate income. So it's sort of like the circle of the two sides of the market and how they benefit each other.
00:20:06.290 - 00:20:35.986, Speaker A: So, will, can we talk about fixed rate income just in general in the old world? How does fixed rate income work? Are these, like, I go to my bank account and I know the interest rates are crappy. I know you're going to tell me that, but I go to my bank account, I have some money, and I go and I buy cds, right? Like cds in a bank account, are these fixed rate income? Maybe you could talk about what this is in the old world and how this translates into crypto.
00:20:36.098 - 00:21:30.810, Speaker C: Yeah. Typically when you look at a CD or you look at a savings account that you're evaluating, you're given a rate that is fixed. And so, for example, on a savings account right now, I think the best that you can find is maybe half a percent APY, which is nothing in comparison to what we're seeing in the DFI space right now. So people in DFI on variable API positions are seen anywhere from ten to 50%. It can even be higher in some cases. And so, essentially, for the users in the traditional finance space who sort of are accustomed to at least being told like, this is what we can guarantee, and this is what you'll get. The element protocol offers the same thing, but those rates are going to be significantly higher than what you see in traditional finance.
00:21:30.810 - 00:22:20.170, Speaker C: And the other thing that you could sort of compare deeply when you look at the traditional finance space is also, this is somewhat akin to a whole space of zero coupon bonds. This is where you essentially get an asset at a discount, but you basically commit to it being locked until a final date. And because that asset is locked, that's essentially what introduces that discount. You have an opportunity lost. Instead of using those funds, depositing and getting apy the fact that it's locked means you can't do that. And for that opportunity cost, that's why it's sold essentially at a discount.
00:22:20.910 - 00:22:56.870, Speaker A: So this is like a CD for crypto assets, basically. Specifically like the crypto monetary assets, which we'd call like bitcoin, ETH and USDC. So if I'm bullish on ETH and I want it to generate yield, I can park it into your system basically into element, and then I have to hold it there for a period of time. Right. And then at the end of that period of time, I receive my yield. Is this kind of how it works, or am I paid the yield continuously as time goes by?
00:22:57.020 - 00:23:43.134, Speaker C: Yeah. So the way it works is essentially technically, yes. So you sort of go in, you bring your eth, you trade your eth for the locked etH, essentially, and that may be locked, let's say, for three months, six months, but you get it at a discount, that then gets redeemed for a larger amount at the end of that period. However, sort of what's really innovative about what we're doing is we've put a lot of effort and research into making sure that market is liquid. And so what that means, we're actually doing a custom trading curve. We're a launch partner with balancer V two as well. So we actually built an invariant.
00:23:43.134 - 00:24:30.626, Speaker C: It's the constant power summit invariant, an iteration of some of the work that yield space has done. And so we're launching that, and it's been audited on balancer V two. And so it enables liquidity for these assets. And so what that means is, even though technically you have three months that you have to be locked into this, or six months, you can actually exit at any time. So you could go through, let's say you're on a six month term, you could go through halfway at the three month mark and decide that you actually want liquidity again. And then at that point, you can sell it with this custom curve, and then you'll have gained the interest along the way as well.
00:24:30.808 - 00:24:44.840, Speaker A: This is something you can do in traditional consumer level cds that you might get in your bank account, right? They're really locked in. I've never seen a way to trade these on the secondary market.
00:24:45.210 - 00:25:29.794, Speaker C: Yeah, no, that's correct. And that's what's so cool about this, and this is what I love about the DeFi space, is it sort of opens up all these new avenues of innovation and all these new primitives that I think a lot of them haven't even been explored fully in the traditional finance world. And just due to the nature of amms, the fact that in balancer v two, you can write custom trading curves, which is really cool, I have a lot of good things to say about balancer v two. So a huge shout out to them, but it just opens up so many cool things. And so something that you would have originally thought you would have been locked in. Exactly. You now have liquidity around being able to exit anytime.
00:25:29.794 - 00:25:34.520, Speaker C: And so there's no real commitment towards that locking period, which is beautiful.
00:25:36.090 - 00:26:21.720, Speaker B: Will, I'm interested in if I'm bullish on a particular asset, this allows me to express my bullishness by committing to a lockup period. And then because I'm committing to that lockup period, I get to access that asset that I'm bullish on at a discount. And if I'm bullish on an asset, what would I like more, other than the asset that I want offered to me at a discounted rate? And, of course, the measure, the magnitude of that discount, is probably correlative to how much yield that asset can bear. But the cool thing about finance is that this allows two groups of people to separate from each other. People who want to purchase an asset at a discount. And that's one half of element. Go into details on the other half.
00:26:21.720 - 00:26:28.926, Speaker B: Is there some other half of this equation where people are getting extra yield on this? Where's the other half of this equation fallen?
00:26:29.058 - 00:27:29.734, Speaker C: Yeah. So this is what's really cool, and this is what I love about the product in general, is we've done a lot of research and ideation and shared a lot of what these market effects will be or what we think they'll be. And so we're sort of letting the market push this forward. And so what our general hypothesis is, and we write about this a lot and we've dove into it, is essentially for the other side, we're talking more the sophisticated defi user, right? These are the deFi users that are depositing into a urine vault and maybe shifting their assets over time, taking bets on different positions. And it might not just be urine, it might be a number of different protocols that they're jumping into. And so what we do is they sort of feel the market. And so we say that it's the sophisticated users who are subsidizing the discounts of the casual user, and the casual user is subsidizing the strategies of the sophisticated user.
00:27:29.734 - 00:28:22.240, Speaker C: And so if I'm the sophisticated defi user and I am depositing into, let's say, the urine st etH vault, and the st eth vault is basically investing in the eTH, two, staking position, right? And so let's say I'm investing in that anyways. Then with the element protocol, what I can essentially do is I'm still investing in that position, but I get a little extra. So I now kind of split. I split that position that I'm in into the principal and the interest. And so this lets me do a number of cool things. One, I could stake both those tokens and get a bunch of extra trading fees. And we've simulated that you could boost your APY significantly creating this market.
00:28:22.240 - 00:29:21.982, Speaker C: But additionally, it gives me other ways of escape, right? So, for example, if I want to shift funds around, but I still want to keep exposure to interest, I can sell my principal. I have new liquidity, I still have exposure to that interest on that position. And now I can use that liquidity to put into any other position in the space. However, we've dove into this concept called yield token compounding. And so this is the idea where you sell your liquidity, your principal, and in general, variable rate will always be higher or should always be higher than fixed rate, sort of how markets generally work. And so I can go ahead because there's that split. I can go ahead and I can sell my principal, and I'm getting a higher rate of interest on variable interest that I'm betting on.
00:29:21.982 - 00:29:47.970, Speaker C: And so when I sell my principal, I'm selling that at less of a discount and I get that liquidity. And then I can redeposit into that position and I can basically increase my exposure to the interest. And I can do this multiple times. So I redeposit, I collect these yield tokens, I'm getting more and more exposure to the interest. I sell the principal, get liquidity. Again, redeposit, sell the principal, get liquidity.
00:29:48.050 - 00:29:48.774, Speaker B: Recursive, right?
00:29:48.812 - 00:30:20.290, Speaker C: Yeah, it's recursive. And I can do this like ten times, do this more. And essentially it's another way of leverage. So I could have started off with ten eth, and assuming the variable position is going for 20% and fixed rate is going for 10%, I can essentially get exposure to 63 e worth of interest. Yeah. And if you're doing this with, there's really other cool things. Like if you're doing this with flash loans as an example, you don't even have to put through the full capital.
00:30:20.290 - 00:30:36.706, Speaker C: This is where you can essentially get ten x leverage on these positions and on the interest by sort of selling your principal and doubling down on the yield and your exposure to the yield.
00:30:36.898 - 00:31:17.190, Speaker A: So will we talk about money Legos so often on bankless? Because that's kind of a great mental analogy for what we're actually building here. Right. So I'm going to ask the question of, you mentioned some other money Legos. What money Legos does element build on top of? Like you mentioned, yearn? Is that kind of the strategy piece? Are there other pieces involved? And then a second question to that is this seems to be built on money Legos, but is its own money Lego? It's kind of a new DeFi primitive. So any thoughts on what could be built on top of it? Let's first take the first question of what money Legos needed to be here for you to build element.
00:31:17.690 - 00:32:05.742, Speaker C: Yeah. So yearn is a huge one. And then yearn is built on a number of legos too. So if you look at what sort of turns the Defi world around, a lot of that is curved behind the scenes. And so a lot of the APY and interest that yearn is getting comes from curve. And specifically also, for example, the EtH position we're likely supporting within urine is also into ST E, which in general, is an e two staking protocol, a tokenized e two staking protocol. And so, yeah, there's all these legos, and it sort of depends on the vault.
00:32:05.742 - 00:32:19.378, Speaker C: Certain vaults have different dependencies. And so we'll kind of finalize which vaults we're going to support out the gate right before our launch. But, yeah, those would be some of the core pieces.
00:32:19.474 - 00:32:59.880, Speaker A: So, guys, the yield is coming from places like e two staking. That is a source of yield. Another source of yield is curve, and that's an exchange platform for stablecoins that also has a token, which is kind of like an equity token, if you will, a capital asset that rewards users. And then urine wiren Wi Fi. We've had Wi Fi on the podcast previously that acts as kind of like a strategy layer where all these automated money robots optimize for the best strategy. And that's what you're using under the covers here. Now that you have this new money Lego element, essentially, what cool things do you think can be built on top of it?
00:33:00.410 - 00:33:41.310, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a lot, actually, that we're super excited about. And we're actually really excited for ideation from the community. We're going to be a community first protocol, and we want the community to really run it. But in general, so there are a few things I'll mention some of the ones that I'm really excited about. So just first of all, introducing fixed rate to the market that has liquidity around it is a beautiful thing in and of itself. And so there's a lot of directions that can be taken into. One thing that I am particularly excited about is this concept called yield ladders.
00:33:41.310 - 00:34:50.650, Speaker C: And so essentially what this is, is you can get an Amm that essentially gives you exposure on a basically continuous rolling basis to categories of yield. Essentially. And so, for example, you could have these yield tokens, and you could have categories that are like ETH two or validator positions, right? They might be like ETH two or layer two tokenized validator positions. And because we have these lockups in these times, you can essentially buy exposure to that whole category as a whole and sort of averages out the interest as it goes along. You could do the same thing with the principal tokens and the fixed rate interest as well, where you could get exposure to the highest rate fixed rate interest. And you don't have to worry about lockup periods, you don't have to worry about redemptions. You sort of have this pool that is sort of always buying new fixed rate tokens and then selling the ones as they come to maturity and sort of automates that process.
00:34:50.650 - 00:35:48.410, Speaker C: So you basically get this consistent exposure and you don't have to worry about too much. And so there's that. A number of the other things that I'm particularly interested in is using these principal tokens as collateral for lending is really fascinating as well. And so this sort of, like, if you think about it, you can take out loans for ETH by staking locked EtH, essentially, and this opens up a whole new market around, or a strong market around borrowing ETH and borrowing bitcoin. And that market hasn't really taken off. And this protocol, in essence, creates that demand, which is fascinating. And so we'd really like to see in the coming months a strong demand for borrowing bitcoin and borrowing ETH through the protocol.
00:35:49.310 - 00:36:21.240, Speaker B: Well, guys, if you want to get more into element, there is an awesome documentation at element Phi. One thing I've learned about will is that his documentation skills are excellent. And so if you want to learn more, you can check out that. But let's go ahead and turn to Preston and Cryptex. Cryptex is a new synthetic asset protocol specifically going after total crypto market cap. Preston, you want to explain cryptex to us?
00:36:22.490 - 00:37:02.778, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. So cryptex is an open organization. So we've kind of built this for the community, to be run by the community. But the basic, well, the first token that's been created is a synthetic asset that's backed by different types of collateral where it has over collateralized the value to create TCAP. So you can be ensured that cryptex or the cryptex.org, they're not just printing money, they're actually backing it by something. It kind of borrows from the CDP idea, from makerdao.
00:37:02.778 - 00:37:45.154, Speaker D: So the collateralized debt position. And with this, we're able to use an oracle price feed where TCAP can always be redeemed for the true price, which we just saw above $210. And this value is really the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies traded on major exchanges. And that's currently $2.2 trillion, which is crazy. I mean, when we started thinking about this idea, it was about $30 for TCAP. And I wish we could have launched it two years ago and given this product out then, and it could have been something where you're getting huge gains on.
00:37:45.154 - 00:37:56.686, Speaker D: But the potential here is huge because it doesn't stop just at TCAP. With the same kind of model, we can really apply to any kind of oracleized data using the same CDP model.
00:37:56.728 - 00:37:59.910, Speaker A: That we have what's the collateral in this case? Preston?
00:38:00.330 - 00:38:36.770, Speaker D: Yeah, at the moment we have ETH backed collateral. So it's very similar to Makerdao where you have a vault deposit the collateral and then you can draw out a certain amount of TCAP. So we have ETH as one and then die as the other one. And then of course it's pretty flexible. So any ERC 20 could be a vault if it's accepted by the protocol. So the potential for other types of tokens or backing vaults is open once the dow is fully operational.
00:38:37.190 - 00:39:31.700, Speaker B: So here's a quick lesson for new bankless listeners, is Dai is actually just a synthetic asset and it's priced by an oracle. And so what cryptex seems to be is exactly what Preston said, a pretty similar system as and so, but instead of just collateralizing, all the collateral that Makerdao lets you collateralize you put in ether or Dai, and then you mint this new token. And this new token is priced by a price feed from Chainlink. And this price feed comes in at the total crypto market cap. And so this is something that the market has always wanted because no one's really been able to produce something that tracks the total value of the entire crypto industry, at least all of our crypto assets, except that's what this is going after. And so Preston, where does Chainlink get the price feed for TCAP? Where does all of that information come from?
00:39:32.470 - 00:39:46.838, Speaker D: Yeah, so there are five data sources they get it from. I'm going to try to name as many of them as I can, but it's things like Coinmarketcap. Shoot, I'm not going to be able.
00:39:46.844 - 00:39:48.650, Speaker B: To name Coingecko I know is one.
00:39:48.720 - 00:40:27.060, Speaker D: Coingecko, things like that. It's, if it's a currency tracked on one of these major sites or major exchanges, even then it's eligible for consideration in the total market capitalization. So there's a little bit of vetting there. At least that's the intention, is that I can't go create my own stablecoin and give it an insane market, a $5 trillion market cap. It's not going to influence TCAP because it has to have some credibility to it. So with the data sources that are coming through Chainlink, there is a vetting process for those.
00:40:28.470 - 00:41:29.260, Speaker A: This kind of goes back to a recipe that we talk about so often, David, which is like on bank list, which is like you take a money Lego store of value, which in this case is Ethan dye, and then plus an oracle, a price feed oracle, and you can create basically any synthetic that you want. So we have store value money, Legos, Oracle money Lego. And then on the other side of that, you get any synthetic, and in this case, you're creating a synthetic and index for the total market cap of crypto. And if I'm just a casual user than Preston, right, I don't have to know the mechanics necessarily of how this works, although I might want to understand them, to understand what the dependencies are and what I'm really trusting in the system. But I can just buy TCAP as nearc 20, and then I have exposure to the entire crypto index, and I don't have to make a bet on whether bitcoin or ETH is going higher in a certain day or whether binance is having its pump, its temporary pump or not. I don't have to make any of those bets. I just get the entire market, right?
00:41:29.710 - 00:42:13.202, Speaker D: Yeah, that's right. I mean, you'll get exposure to things that are very volatile. So, for example, Ripple's been having issues with SEC lawsuits. So they were sued, the price dropped significantly, then the lawsuit is making progress, so the price goes back up. I would probably never invest in Ripple, but to have some exposure to good news is excellent. And I think that this is something that a lot of retail investors who don't even want to take the time to understand how those types of protocols work. They just see that this type of innovations that are out in cryptocurrency world have value and could be going up in value as it gains more mainstream adoption.
00:42:13.202 - 00:42:27.930, Speaker D: Of course, they could pick the big contenders like bitcoin and ETH, and you probably should do that. I mean, not financial advice, but for all the other things, TCAP can solve that problem of what should I invest in? Maybe I should invest in everything if you buy TcaP.
00:42:28.350 - 00:42:45.170, Speaker B: So, Preston, what are the parameters for producing TCaP? I know at Genesis, when maker Dow first launched, you needed to lock up 150% of ether, and then you could mint up to a certain amount of die. Could you go into the details of the parameters around the system?
00:42:45.320 - 00:43:46.722, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So the minimum collateralization is 200%, so we need double the collateral. The user interface will recommend to you that you should do 250% just as, like a safe maximum. And this value can be lowered at a later date. It does seem a little bit high, but in order to get the product out there and to stabilize it and to move quickly and to keep it safe, we aim for a higher than 150% model, and then we can, of course, revisit it if we do some analysis and say, well, 200% is too high, we could do it with 100%, especially since some of the vaults really move in tandem with the price of TCAp. So ETh, for example, doesn't move much compared to TCAP, but die might move a lot more compared to TCaP because it's pegged to the dollar and not really moving a whole lot. So maybe at a later date.
00:43:46.722 - 00:43:53.218, Speaker D: Some vaults have a higher collateralization ratio than others, but we started at 200% just to be safe.
00:43:53.394 - 00:44:21.390, Speaker B: Right. And this is uniquely different from maker Dow, where the ether collateral, it's the collateral against a stable asset. But this is not printing a stable asset. This is supposed to have an asset that ideally goes up in price. And so having dai as the collateral for something where you owe something that could go up and twice as much in the future, that could get into some hairy circumstances.
00:44:21.810 - 00:44:35.506, Speaker D: Yes. So you can think of it as kind of the opposite of the maker down model, where if I put in eth and draw out die, I'm kind of probably going to buy more eth. I'm long on that.
00:44:35.608 - 00:44:40.498, Speaker B: Well, with your short die long. Short die long the collateral.
00:44:40.594 - 00:45:10.458, Speaker D: Yes. So in this model, it could be the opposite if you're short on the whole market. I mean, we're in a bull market. Bull markets don't last forever. Maybe you're going to be one of the people who can pick the top and say, I'm going to draw out a bunch of TCAP and sell it for die with my die back vault, and then go back and pay back later when it's a lot cheaper. I mean, that's one opportunity for vault owners. The other one is that keeping the price in the secondary market stable.
00:45:10.458 - 00:45:43.530, Speaker D: So the oracle and cryptex core contracts have no control over what it trades on, uniswap or sushiswap or anything like that. But we do have a place where you can redeem this token for its true price based on the oracle. So if TCAP is traded too high, you can mint some TCaP and then sell it on the secondary market. Once it stabilizes, buy it again, pay back your debt, and then, same with the opposites, if it's trading too low, it's a good time to buy and pay back your debt at a discount.
00:45:44.110 - 00:46:10.340, Speaker B: So the opportunity here to me is that not only could there be TCAP, but there's also this governance token, which could, in theory, govern over further synthetic assets, which makes cryptex in the same sort of boat as perhaps synthetics, which is a synthetic asset platform. What would you say would be the long term vision of cryptex? Are you guys just going to pump out a bunch of synthetic assets? What's the deal?
00:46:11.110 - 00:46:56.994, Speaker D: Possibly. We have a lot of ideas for new innovations that aren't out there, and our founder, Joseco, is more of a finance guy, Wall street guy, and he kind of interacts with a lot of type of the retail investors and users of this type of protocol. So he really understands what they want. And we have a few ideas we want to work on. It's pretty interesting to me, being as a developer, not much of a finance person, to hear some of the crazy things that people might want to. It's almost kind of like gambling, I guess, in the market. But there are some synthetic products that you can come up with that are specific to the cryptocurrency world that just don't exist yet.
00:46:56.994 - 00:47:03.474, Speaker D: So we have a lot of interesting ideas and potential future synthetic assets to come out.
00:47:03.672 - 00:47:33.614, Speaker B: So I'm trying to get my mind mapped around how to compare cryptx versus makerdao and synthetix with makerdao. It's very different with the sense that the price feed oracle is not dai or is not the dollar, it's TCap. And it's also very different from synthetix in the sense that the collateral is not the native token of the system, it's other assets. Between those two differences, is that basically the main differences between other protocols, or is there other aspects that are different that are worth highlighting as well?
00:47:33.812 - 00:47:36.480, Speaker D: I'd say so. I'd say that captures it pretty well.
00:47:36.930 - 00:47:38.474, Speaker B: Okay, fantastic.
00:47:38.602 - 00:48:30.160, Speaker A: You know what's interesting here is I've been surprised that Makerdao actually didn't go down the synthetics route, but they've seemed pretty laser focused on Dai all of this time. So it's cool territory that you guys are covering. We say this so often, David, that any experiment that can be tried on Defi and on Ethereum will be tried. And so this is a new experiment. Really excited about what you're building too, Preston. So we want to pause for sponsors, but when we get back, we are going to dive into this trajectory of how you guys have come from kind of an ETH to almost a core developer type of role, core researcher type of role, to move to the app layer. We're going to talk about all of that when we get back, but we want to thank our sponsors for making this episode possible.
00:48:30.160 - 00:48:31.822, Speaker A: And here they are.
00:48:31.956 - 00:49:09.866, Speaker B: Synthetix is Ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol. What does that mean? Synthetix is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets, which are assets that are priced via an oracle. Rather than bids or asks, traders can use the Quinta exchange, which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetics. Traders on quinta can trade synthetic tokens like SBTC s oil or SDFI. Because quinta is powered by synthetix, traders experience zero slippage on their trades. No, I didn't mean low slippage. I meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform.
00:49:09.866 - 00:49:59.354, Speaker B: No slippage on your trades. You can also easily short assets with isyncs, which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset. Synthetix isn't just for traders. Developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets, or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects. If you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform not found in the legacy world, check out Quinta IO. If you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral, go to www dot synthetics IO, where you can stake your SNX or ETH and earn fees from synthetics. Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make.
00:49:59.354 - 00:50:41.746, Speaker B: My crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens, and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset.
00:50:41.746 - 00:51:22.038, Speaker B: When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in eth, so whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of eth bonus back to me. At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com.

We are back with Will and Preston in the second half of this show, where we are going to go into topics around what it's like to both be working on Ethereum and also in the Ethereum app layer. And so, Preston, I want to start with you.
00:51:22.038 - 00:51:53.040, Speaker B: You're in the code for e two. Like, not only are you working on cryptex, but you are also still highly engaged with prismatic, and you've been with prismatic for multiple years now. What's it like to build on both sides of the spectrum? And how has the skills that you've developed with building in Ethereum translated into building in Defi? And perhaps what are the other benefits as well? Do you have more connections, know more people, more knowledge? What's it like to be on both sides of the protocol on the app?
00:51:55.010 - 00:53:24.298, Speaker D: So with prismatic labs, we're trying to make Ethereum a thing for everyone, right? So make it scale, make it easy to use, make it fast, make it cheap. And part of that is understanding. Part of everything is who are your users and what do they do, right? So our users of prismatic are, first of all, the stakers of e two, and then secondly, people building on the application layer. So over the last three years, I've been studying DFI protocols and how these things work and how people are thinking about finance and what kind of impact that I can have personally and that prismatic can have in general as a core protocol team. And I saw that there's still these fundamental issues with the protocol layer. Being a core protocol developer and not really interacting with the blockchain, you can kind of hear, oh, yeah, gas is high, but you don't really feel it unless you're actually deploying contracts. I've interacted with whatever Dex to do some swaps, but it wasn't until last week we deployed TCAP and we were paying for these contract deployments, and we spent like, three ether to deploy a handful of contracts.
00:53:24.298 - 00:53:58.230, Speaker D: And I'm like, this sucks, right? So I see why people are complaining, and it just brings more motivation back to improving the protocol itself. We've also made a lot of friends along the way. In the last three years, we have been pretty lucky that the community supported us and that we've done a great job. The prismatic team is one of the best teams out there. They've done an amazing job bringing prism to light and helping ship e two. Of course, we're not the only e two client provider. There are many out there and they're all excellent.
00:53:58.230 - 00:54:16.174, Speaker D: But just the community has been really great to us, and we've been able to get feet when building TCAP. I was able to get feedback from a few select people especially to validate the idea, like, is it cool? Is it crazy? Will it work? What do you think? So it's been interesting.
00:54:16.372 - 00:54:20.510, Speaker A: Which is harder, Preston, building a DFI app or building an e two client?
00:54:22.390 - 00:54:57.494, Speaker D: I don't know. They're both terrifying. There is like $8 billion running through e two, something like that, and prismatic is a very large percentage of that. So that's terrifying. To see people committing their money in vaults to mint TCAP is also terrifying just because this is something that we built, and if it doesn't work how it's supposed to work, it's just not going to be great. And that's just something that I never want to happen. Like, everything's got to be excellent.
00:54:57.494 - 00:55:36.710, Speaker D: So I think the years with prismatic have really prepared me for this, is that we have to think about every single type of scenario that could possibly be out there, even ones that are ridiculous, that don't really profit the person initiating these types of attacks, but that they would do anyway for the walls just to wreck it, just to cause chaos. So I think that adversarial thinking and more security minded focus has become. It's really valuable to a defi developer, and especially at a protocol layer. You have to do it right at a protocol layer.
00:55:37.530 - 00:55:47.530, Speaker B: Will, what about you, your experience doing r and D on the sharding side of things and working at consensus? How would you say that's impacted the development of element?
00:55:48.670 - 00:56:38.410, Speaker C: Yeah. So in general, actually, Johnny and I both came from, both did e two research. Johnny actually had built the initial Teku client as well, and we all went to interop together, saw Preston there. I think me and Preston, we have some other stories that we can share at some point in the call, but in general, Johnny and I both really take an approach that we like to simulate. We like to be well researched. It's really important to us that we dive into mechanism design and understand these are the vulnerabilities. These are sort of the parameters that tweak the system to move in this direction, which can cause some misbalance.
00:56:38.410 - 00:57:32.894, Speaker C: And this actually isn't that different than what you need to do in the mechanism design for figuring out how does the shard work? Right. You sort of change and tweak this parameter, then over here it affects something, right. Even in building defi applications, you have the same challenges. Some of the other really cool things is we're building an application while having a really strong understanding of the actual core protocol. That means when we start thinking about things such as scaling, moving to layer two other mechanism designs, we have a much deeper context and understanding of that. And so that's super helpful as well. And so I would say those would be a few things.
00:57:32.894 - 00:58:47.560, Speaker C: And then also just like all the people we've run into, like Preston Hussein as well along the way. So in general, it's been good to both work with a lot of people at the protocol layer who have been very thoughtful in what they're doing. And we in general have a pretty strong confidence in the future of ETh and where e two is going at this point, having been involved in that and knowing the teams that are working on that. And so I think that sort of gives us a really positive trajectory. And in general, as we build element protocol and we put grants out for the community and different things like that, one of the things that we want to support is core protocol development, and we want to make a specific effort to do that. And we're hoping that other protocols do that as well. And that's in general really important to us and in the process, too, because that's sort of what gives, makes everything run and everything work.
00:58:48.650 - 00:59:39.720, Speaker B: So I wanted to get into the question of why now? And not only are both of you guys working on ETh two, or will, in your case, was previously working researching on e two, but with elements you guys have, Danny Ryan as an advisor and with cryptex, you guys have many other Ethereum builders on the team. So it's not just you guys. There's other Ethereum builders involved with both of your guys'projects, and it was interesting to both me and Ryan and why we're having you guys on the show is that these projects came out roughly around the same time, give or take a couple of days of the announcement. Why now? Why not DeFi summer or why not a year from now? What about the app layer is telling you guys that the Ethereum app layer is ready for you guys to start moving in and start building there?
00:59:41.210 - 01:00:45.850, Speaker C: Will, let's start with yeah, for know, I've been really excited about DeFi and what was Bergen and developing there for a while. And so in general, some of the research we were working on, some of the prototypes that we had done was coming to a wrap about six months ago, and that's when I started building element and getting the team together. And about six months ago, I was sort of looking at the space and seeing the sort of explosion of innovation that was happening. And the Lego piece is really beginning to stack in a way that we hadn't seen previously. And from my perspective, that's sort of the time to build. Right. You want to put more foundational elements, more key pieces that can be built upon, because this is sort of the foundation building period.
01:00:45.850 - 01:00:59.440, Speaker C: And so that's what I saw. Talked to Johnny about it, and he also was really excited about this and what was happening, and so we figured this is the right time to jump in and build this.
01:01:00.690 - 01:01:02.640, Speaker B: And, Preston, same question to you.
01:01:03.590 - 01:01:14.354, Speaker D: Yeah. For me, when I was working at Google, I put in my 40 hours to keep the lights on.
01:01:14.392 - 01:01:14.642, Speaker C: Right.
01:01:14.696 - 01:01:42.080, Speaker D: And then I would work another 20 to 30, sometimes even more, on prismatic. And then when I left Google, I was just spending all that time on prismatic, doing insane hours a weeks. Even at socializing events. You might find us on our laptop, will seen us there. Right, at East New York, we were on our.
01:01:46.530 - 01:02:03.570, Speaker C: Yeah, no, this is like one of a few, but, yeah, like Preston, Raul, and Terrence. One of my favorite memories is at all the events, whether it was eth New York or some type of barbecue or whatever. You could find these three constantly on their computer.
01:02:03.720 - 01:02:08.534, Speaker B: Who are the prismatic team, by the way? For listeners who aren't familiar with those? Yeah, yeah.
01:02:08.572 - 01:02:47.300, Speaker C: They're always constantly on their computer, and everyone else is, like, talking. You go up to Terrence or press and you're like, hey, how are you doing? And they give you the time of super, super nice, super friendly, and then you walk away and they're back there, like, hacking at the computer. It doesn't matter what the event was. I think during that time, that was sort of when some of the infrastructure was still building and they'd have little bugs and things to tweak at that time. But, yeah, these guys were 100, 200%, always heads down, which I think was really fun to watch.
01:02:47.990 - 01:03:14.954, Speaker D: Yeah, we were busy. We were busy for the first couple of years up until it launched. We were working crazy hours, and just as much as we can, like, skirting on the edge of burnout, thankfully, we were all, like, a good team together, and we could communicate, say, hey, I need some time. We could share that with each other and kind of build each other up in that way. But then when e two launched, we kind of had a little bit of breathing room.
01:03:14.992 - 01:03:15.146, Speaker C: Right.
01:03:15.168 - 01:04:03.674, Speaker D: We said, wow, it's out there. We just try to get these micro improvements, get things, making it really nicer, faster. But the crazy sprint was over, at least for phase zero. And in all that time I had been thinking about building on the application layer, specifically with this tcap model, but had zero time to do it. It wasn't until after phase zero had launched that I actually had a little bit more time to commit. I could still do most of my time with prismatic and then spend a little bit of time on TCAP. And now with the spec of e two is getting ramped up again in the last couple of months, and we're starting to build into the next pieces of e two.
01:04:03.674 - 01:04:25.150, Speaker D: So things are getting a little bit busy again for me and for my team. It was a good time to just take a break, work on something you don't work on your normal role, learn something new. I learned a lot of stuff building on the application layer, which I think that will help me build on the protocol layer, because I really understand some of the pain points of what users are facing.
01:04:25.810 - 01:04:39.990, Speaker C: I think that's key, actually. I don't know. I think that makes everyone really comfortable knowing that you can take the learnings from working on the application layer and make sure that the research and movement on e two goes forward.
01:04:40.060 - 01:05:31.666, Speaker A: Well, this is just part of the thing. I love the fact that you guys worked on e two kind of core development, client development, and now you're in the app layer because you're like eating your own dog food. You get to experience what sort of the users and the builders experience around this. And so I love it, and I'm hugely optimistic about it. However, at the back of my mind, I'm also a little bit worried because Ethereum has classically had sort of almost a public goods problem in that protocol development is funded by the EF, which is kind of vital. Yolos and Preston, you know this because the way prism started, prismatic started, we're Yolo funded first. That's right, Yolo funded Gitcoin grants.
01:05:31.666 - 01:06:18.710, Speaker A: When's the next check coming? There's not a revenue stream associated with the public good that is the Ethereum protocol, and certainly there's the vestiges of the original ETh foundation, who has a treasury fair. And maybe, as will you're pointing out, there are these other Defi protocols who will contribute into the future that now have some decent treasuries. So I'm optimistic about that. And yet we might start to see a bit of a drain, a bit of a talent drain from the protocol layer to the app layer. Is this something that worries you or do you think that this is good? Are you worried in general about the public goods funding problem on the Ethereum core protocol? Maybe we'll start with you, Preston.
01:06:19.610 - 01:07:19.034, Speaker D: Well, slightly mean. The Ethereum foundation has been really great to us continuing grant sustainability and for growth and those will continue for the foreseeable future. We have no doubt about that. And in terms of talent, I think that the hardest problems draw the smartest people. Whenever we're hiring for prismatic, we are just flooded with amazing people that we wish we could hire all of them. But there's always this thing in the back of your mind where you're like, it's not sustainable, right? Like the EF will fund us to see e two to fruition, but after that, what's their obligation to keep us going besides a maintenance part? So we may have to scale back. So we're always thinking about with prismatic labs, like how do we reach that sustainability? And so it's always there a little bit.
01:07:19.034 - 01:07:24.810, Speaker D: But I think as far as e two is concerned, I'm not worried about it at all.
01:07:24.960 - 01:08:17.082, Speaker A: What about this? You said the hardest challenges attract the best talent, right? There's also a financial consideration in this if you want to get really wealthy in this market and you're a smart contract developer, right? Depending on what you do, the app layer might be the place to do it. Or heck, maybe the best thing to do is to go fork and create your own eth killer. Right? Now, with all of your prismatic experience, is this maybe not a worry for you personally? Because it sounds like, Preston, you're here for a variety of reasons, right? Including the world you want to see moving forward. But is this a pressure point on the talent pool available to work on Ethereum client development? Are they just attracted to other financial sources that might exist outside of it?
01:08:17.216 - 01:08:31.920, Speaker B: Right, because it's one thing if grants and funding is available, but I don't think any amount of grants will ever be able to compete with tokens. Like tokens are lucrative and that is the competition that the EF and other and Gitcoin has.
01:08:33.670 - 01:09:20.766, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, with prismatic we can offer some nice salary and benefits and things and working on amazing team solving hard problems, but there is no 100 x opportunity. With prismatic, we don't have a token. We're not a core protocol, so we can't issue, there's no pre mine or anything like that, or anything like that. So if you're looking for something like that, it draws different people. Everyone wants to be compensated for what they do, and of course we do that. But there's also like, you want to maximize your time investment because time is finite, right? So you really want to earn the maximum you can.
01:09:20.766 - 01:09:36.694, Speaker D: And that may not be working on the core protocol, but I can tell you this, that you will not find a bigger impact opportunity than working on the core protocol of Ethereum. So that is more valuable than 100 x to me, or at least in terms of monetary value.
01:09:36.892 - 01:09:38.760, Speaker A: Will, what do you think about these questions?
01:09:40.010 - 01:10:23.774, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with Preston. The core value of contributing to the core protocol layer is it's really rewarding. You're building the foundation for everything else. It's important work. It tends to attract extremely smart people. I'm somewhat optimistic about some of the future funding. I tend to think that in general, and element kind of wants to lead in some of this as well, is a lot of the protocols that are doing well and are having an impact should really give back and put attention towards furthering development on the protocol layer.
01:10:23.774 - 01:11:32.842, Speaker C: And so I think you'll see a lot of the DeFi products that are coming out supporting protocol development in general. I think from elements perspective, we have a pretty diverse team of experience, so we have a good amount of researchers. And so from our perspective, sort of this first launch that we're doing, we see this as introducing a number of primitives that's going to sort of level up and move the DFI space forward. But then we think about what's our next challenge, right. And from our perspective, we always want to be tackling the most interesting, and I would say fascinating problems. And if that means we put some of our effort, because some of the l two works needs to be taken to the next degree, or some protocol work needs to be taken or needs some extra involvement, then that's like what we'll do. And so I sort of want to see this happen.
01:11:32.842 - 01:11:58.260, Speaker C: I want to see this kind of like merging between the two worlds. In the past, we've sort of seen this separation. And so I think in the future, I think we're going to see more of these two worlds merging and working together a lot closely. And so I tend to be pretty positive about that, and I'm hoping that's the direction things are going to go in. I know that's what element wants and what we'll sort of push for as well.
01:11:59.590 - 01:12:41.614, Speaker B: So with your experience in both the app layer and the protocol layer, and also just your time in Ethereum, which you guys have three plus years in Ethereum, I believe both, which, I mean, Ethereum is only six years old, so it's over half of Ethereum's lifespan. What perspectives would you say that you guys have that you wish the broader community had? Because so many of Ethereum's community members have come in the last year, or even less ever since Defi summer. So with your a very long experience throughout Ethereum, what do you wish was more commonplace as a perspective throughout our community? Will, let's start with you.
01:12:41.732 - 01:12:59.510, Speaker C: Yeah, I would just say, don't forget the devs and the hands that feed you. Right. So if you're on the application layer, none of what you are doing is possible without the strong and hard work the protocol devs are doing. So that should be front and center and on everyone's minds.
01:13:01.370 - 01:13:02.070, Speaker B: President.
01:13:02.220 - 01:13:38.318, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. Don't forget, when gas prices are back to a normal level because of protocol advancements who help do that, that's what we're trying to do, is make it a much better place. But also, I want to point out that Ethereum is six years old, but this is still early. When I got in, I thought I was too late. I was like, oh, me too. I didn't get a crypto kitty when they were really nice and I missed the whole thing. But then in the last three years, I've just seen incredible innovations.
01:13:38.318 - 01:14:08.700, Speaker D: Know Defi summer and Defi, like, really starting to become a thing and nfts and just constantly amazing people coming out of nowhere and building amazing things. And there's still a lot to come from Ethereum, and we're not even close to a mainstream adoption yet. So if you think you're too late, if you think that, I don't know, because Ethereum is reaching all time highs, it's not a good time to get in. I'd say anytime is a good time to get in, even if the price is trading high.
01:14:09.150 - 01:14:25.730, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree. Let me underline that point. There's only 500,000 DFI users or less right now. This is so early. That's a population with like a mid size us city. That's what we're talking about here. So all sorts of ways to get involved here.
01:14:25.730 - 01:14:51.420, Speaker A: Make sure you do that. Got to ask a question about Eth two, because I have two e, two devs and experts here. So it's been what, like five years? Five months. It felt like five years, but five months since launch. How are we doing so far, Preston, how are things going? Have there been any surprises, any hiccups? Or is it going better than you thought it would go.
01:14:52.030 - 01:15:18.002, Speaker D: Yeah. It's definitely been a roller coaster of emotion, really. If you look at the chain, it's not a roller coaster at all. It's exactly how it's supposed to go. Very stable, smooth and amazing. We had a few incidents with slashing, people getting slashed, and as people are learning what not to do, this is becoming better. And we haven't seen a major slashing event in a long time.
01:15:18.002 - 01:15:52.286, Speaker D: So this is great. I think that all of the clients are advancing in the right direction. They're getting cheaper to run, they're faster, and they're also getting ahead of what's coming next. So they're prototyping quickly and building quickly. And it's just like last year and the year before where we're getting ready to launch testnets and getting users in and getting things going. So it's been exactly how I thought it would go, if not better, because some people were worried how they're going to launch at the beginning of December. There's no way.
01:15:52.286 - 01:16:02.766, Speaker D: But then it far exceeded our expectations on the genesis event, and since then, it has just continued to be this amazing protocol that's just been cruising along.
01:16:02.868 - 01:16:31.210, Speaker A: Do you remember when we were worried that we wouldn't get enough stake in the contracts at launch? Now, look at this. Part of me was kind of knock on wood because I'm a little bit surprised in a very pleasant way, that nothing's blown up yet. Right. This is new territory. So credit to all the client development that went into this and all of the teams that participated in it, but, yeah. Are you surprised nothing's blown up yet, Preston?
01:16:32.910 - 01:17:10.002, Speaker D: No. Everyone did an amazing job, and there are several people in the shadows that help find things before they become an issue. Thankfully, there's not been any showstopper bugs in e two because of all the audits, because of all the process, because it took so long. People complain it took so long, but look, it's gone exactly how it should have. And that's why we took our time and did it right. And just thank you all client developers, all security researchers, protocol developer, spec designers, everyone who was involved did an amazing job and that's why it's succeeding. So no surprises.
01:17:10.002 - 01:17:13.974, Speaker D: It hasn't blown up. It's been just like we thought it would.
01:17:14.092 - 01:17:38.880, Speaker A: Okay, so what is now next in the path? So we've got to kind of phase zero launch. Right. So the next milestone, big milestone in my world, besides EIP 15, five nine on ETh one is the merge. When does the merge happen? When do we get rid of proof of work, or are there other milestones before that that you're paying attention to?
01:17:43.880 - 01:17:45.772, Speaker D: Will, that sounds more like you're.
01:17:45.936 - 01:19:14.900, Speaker C: Yeah, sorry, I'll respond. Yeah, so I don't know the exact timeline because I was a lot more involved with this portion six months ago, but I do know that we've seen already the merge in a prototype, for example, and some of the clients lighthouse did this recently, which is really cool. And so in general, what's exciting about the merge is once you have this in place, you now have this data layer on e two where applications, specifically l two applications as well, can also upload some of the state routes or things that they're working on. And then you essentially can have ETH two secure the ETH one network and then ETH one point to the blocks in the ETH two network. And so seeing that come to fruition is pretty cool. And TXRX, Johnny did a lot of that group, and Johnny, my co founder, did a lot of work on the initial merge and specifically with so in very, very excited and seems to be moving in a good direction.
01:19:16.360 - 01:19:43.710, Speaker B: I want to get your opinions on Justin Drake's proposal for a minimum viable merge where we could move that merge up basically as soon as possible to what is secure, to really prioritize the removal of proof of work with your guys'understanding as to the current state of the Ethereum protocol. How does that proposal land with you, Preston, we'll start with you.
01:19:44.880 - 01:20:18.330, Speaker D: So I would love to see eth two getting put to work. Right now it's finalizing the beacon chain and doing great work there. But to merge things together into actually having it, securing the whole of the network, that's what I want to see, and I'd love to see that as soon as possible. I don't have any aggressions against miners. I think they do a great job securing the network. But I would also love to see e two validators, people who have invested in e two, to start earning those gas fees, rewards and things like that.
01:20:19.980 - 01:21:01.830, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's smart. Try and get the minimum possible to get the two merged and working together and then sort of make sure that that's validated, that moves forward, and then begin some of the other deeper pieces, like the statelessness and EVM changes and transfers and withdrawals. So it seems to be like the right way to do this. You want to sort of start off with that first increment and then see the evolution and then begin to build on top of that, because that's going to be a huge switch as we move eth one towards a PoS system.
01:21:02.920 - 01:21:30.800, Speaker A: Well, guys, thank you so much for walking us through your individual projects at the app layer now, not just at the e two protocol layer. You're certainly doing some great work. Thanks so much for the eth price. It's going up, and I think that's because we are shipping eth two and stuff is happening. Question for you guys, if people want to learn more about your projects, where should they go first? You will on element.
01:21:32.740 - 01:21:53.760, Speaker C: Yeah. So I would say if you go to our website, element Phi over there, we link to our medium. So we're going to be posting a bunch on there. But I'd say the most informative thing would be our construction paper that we just released, which goes in a lot of depth.
01:21:53.840 - 01:21:54.864, Speaker B: All of the details.
01:21:54.992 - 01:22:13.950, Speaker C: Yeah, and all the details. Yeah. So I'd say that's a good place to start. And then just follow us on Twitter, join our discord. Everything like that as well. Real quick, before I pass it off to Preston, I want to give a huge call out to the element team. They're all awesome.
01:22:13.950 - 01:22:40.608, Speaker C: We have a good group that comes from maker zero x e two development, and then even the traditional space. And then Johnny made a bet, a one 8th bet, if I could figure out how to Braid Preston's hair. Fortunately, we're not in person, because if we were, I think me and Preston would have taken that bet, and then we would have laughed because Johnny would be out a couple grand.
01:22:40.704 - 01:22:41.590, Speaker D: Oh, yeah.
01:22:42.840 - 01:22:50.490, Speaker C: But instead, alternatively, I decided to write a haiku for going to. I'm going to read the haiku real quick.
01:22:51.260 - 01:22:56.584, Speaker A: Yeah. Let's do some haikus, then tell us where we can buy the haiku as an NFT will.
01:22:56.702 - 01:22:57.032, Speaker C: Yes.
01:22:57.086 - 01:22:57.496, Speaker B: Yes.
01:22:57.598 - 01:23:12.032, Speaker C: How about we tweet it and then we tokenize it? Good place to start. Give it to us. His galaxy brain. Why quit me? Can't quit me. Best hair in crypto. And there's a number of inside jokes there, so I had to throw it out there.
01:23:12.166 - 01:23:12.704, Speaker D: Amazing.
01:23:12.822 - 01:23:14.300, Speaker A: It's live on bankless.
01:23:14.460 - 01:23:17.010, Speaker B: Crypto culture is tight, by the way.
01:23:18.660 - 01:23:23.170, Speaker A: Back to you. Where should people go to find out more? And who do you want to thank?
01:23:24.340 - 01:23:45.530, Speaker D: Yeah, so cryptex finance is the site. You can find everything there. Our white paper medium, Twitter, the application is there, too. I'd say take a look, give it a try, see what you think. Join our discord. Ask questions if you like. We've got a great community that we've built together.
01:23:45.530 - 01:24:13.936, Speaker D: So even if you just want to share some memes. Come on, share some memes with us. We'd be happy to see it. I'd love to thank everybody on the cryptex team, everyone at prismatic as well. They've been super awesome supporting e two in the last three years. So without those guys, I would not be in this position on bankless, building on the application layer. I'd just be some guys working on ads.
01:24:13.936 - 01:24:18.870, Speaker D: So really happy to be here. And thanks to everyone that we've met along the way.
01:24:19.480 - 01:24:24.470, Speaker B: And Preston, we're ready for your haiku whenever you want to read it.
01:24:28.780 - 01:24:34.900, Speaker C: Preston has better hair than James Preswich. That's a controversial statement.
01:24:34.980 - 01:24:36.568, Speaker B: Finishing off in a spicy take.
01:24:36.654 - 01:24:39.690, Speaker A: Yeah, we're going to leave that in. We're not going to clip that will.
01:24:41.820 - 01:24:43.480, Speaker B: That's going to follow me forever.
01:24:43.640 - 01:24:58.444, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, guys, well, it's been a lot of fun. Thanks for all of the work that you're doing to the bankless community. We hope you enjoyed this episode.
