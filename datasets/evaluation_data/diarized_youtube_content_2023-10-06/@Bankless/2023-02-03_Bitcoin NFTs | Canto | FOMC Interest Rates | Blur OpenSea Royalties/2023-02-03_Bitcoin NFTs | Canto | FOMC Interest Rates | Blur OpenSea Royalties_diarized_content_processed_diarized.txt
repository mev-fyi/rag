00:00:00.490 - 00:00:04.320, Speaker A: Bitcoin gets NFTs, but the community wants to censor it.
00:00:06.690 - 00:00:12.746, Speaker B: Bankless Nation, it is the first Friday of February and it's time for the what? David?
00:00:12.938 - 00:00:28.210, Speaker A: The Friday weekly roll up, where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless. Ryan I've drank about two times the amount of coffee that I usually do, so that is a fair warning to the Bankless listeners out there. Your boy is caffeinated.
00:00:28.290 - 00:00:44.106, Speaker B: Yeah. I could tell from some of your Twitter activity. I had to literally pull you away in order to do this show. Slow down there, my boy. All right. This month, though, for you, you're doing a lot of travel, right? You got some conferences coming up. I thought it was a conference month, but you're like it's not conference month.
00:00:44.106 - 00:00:48.890, Speaker B: I'm like two conferences, man, that's a lot for me. That would be like two years worth of conferences.
00:00:49.790 - 00:00:58.254, Speaker A: They bookend the month. So tomorrow I leave for Tel Aviv to go to the Starquare Sessions. I'm very excited for that. And then at the end of the month in Israel. In Israel. Yeah.
00:00:58.452 - 00:01:04.978, Speaker B: Are you ready for those big brains? I mean, you are big brain in your element, but this is like yeah.
00:01:04.984 - 00:01:18.558, Speaker A: It'S cryptography big brain. And no, I'm not ready for that. Like account abstraction, ZK roll ups. Like, it really stretches what my brain is able to comprehend. We'll see if I come back broken or not. We'll see.
00:01:18.664 - 00:01:20.002, Speaker B: Or full of new ideas.
00:01:20.066 - 00:01:23.094, Speaker A: Yeah, hopefully the latter, but you got that.
00:01:23.132 - 00:01:24.258, Speaker B: And then what else? Denver.
00:01:24.354 - 00:01:31.942, Speaker A: E. Denver at the end of the month, which is where the Bankless Nation is going to have its first ever in real life meetup, which we will talk about later in the show.
00:01:32.076 - 00:01:34.950, Speaker B: That's awesome. All right, so what are we going to get into this week, David?
00:01:35.030 - 00:01:49.566, Speaker A: First, we got to talk about the markets, Ryan, because the markets are hot. Token appetite is absolutely in. We're going to talk about the layer two tokens that are up, we're going to talk about the layer two app tokens that are up, and some other layer ones as well. So that's coming in first.
00:01:49.748 - 00:01:51.134, Speaker B: Caffeinated and bullish today.
00:01:51.172 - 00:02:07.382, Speaker A: Caffeinated and bullish. It's the best combination. It's the best combination. After this, the FTX story continues. We're going to find out who exactly is paying for SBF's legal fees. And also SBF trying to engage in witness tampering. Seriously, we'll talk about that.
00:02:07.382 - 00:02:12.626, Speaker A: And also third, but also so much more after this. Bitcoin has NFTs.
00:02:12.738 - 00:02:13.350, Speaker B: Oh, cool.
00:02:13.420 - 00:02:14.614, Speaker A: Yeah. Did you hear about this?
00:02:14.732 - 00:02:18.066, Speaker B: Yeah, I heard about this. So I'm sure everyone in the Bitcoin.
00:02:18.098 - 00:02:32.670, Speaker A: Community is super excited about everyone. Everyone loves it. Everyone loves NFTs on bitcoin. Not only NFTs on Bitcoin, Ryan, but right before we were recording, I was actually playing Doom on bitcoin. Doom? Yeah, Doom.
00:02:33.090 - 00:02:36.410, Speaker B: I remember I could play that in my Ti 83 calculator.
00:02:36.490 - 00:02:38.320, Speaker A: Oh, really? Yeah.
00:02:39.090 - 00:02:48.382, Speaker B: Bitcoin is I'm not saying, by the way, that Bitcoin is a calculator and Ethereum is like more like a smartphone. Not drawing that analogy at all, but that's pretty cool. Doom on bitcoin.
00:02:48.446 - 00:03:09.606, Speaker A: I will absolutely draw that analogy. Bitcoin is at least as powerful as a T 84 calculator. So that and so much more is going to come in this weekly roll up. So make sure that you like and subscribe, rate and review wherever you are. These YouTube videos come out every Friday and podcasts as well. So make sure that you're subscribed so you don't miss a weekly roll up.
00:03:09.708 - 00:03:12.454, Speaker B: Only. Rate it though. If you're given a five star, yes. If not, just don't get it.
00:03:12.492 - 00:03:20.058, Speaker A: Don't pass. Yeah, five stars only. I think our rating is like 4.9, so if you give us a four star, you're actually bringing us down. Don't do that.
00:03:20.224 - 00:03:23.962, Speaker B: Oh, wow. A bunch of haters one star.
00:03:24.016 - 00:03:25.742, Speaker A: It's going to be 4.8 tomorrow, next week.
00:03:25.796 - 00:03:38.338, Speaker B: Sorry about that, guys. Hey, one thing before we get in, got to tell them about this really cool new resource. It is called MetaMask Learn. You want to learn some crypto? You'd start here, David. What are we looking at on screen?
00:03:38.424 - 00:03:57.222, Speaker A: We are looking at a brand new educational platform from MetaMask. And so not only is MetaMask going to give you a self custodial wallet, they will also teach you how to use it. But also if your friends or family are ever like, hey, can you teach me how to do crypto? Things you can send is that the voice they use?
00:03:57.276 - 00:03:58.534, Speaker B: Is that what your family sounds like?
00:03:58.572 - 00:04:34.254, Speaker A: That's exactly all of every single white voice. Yeah, you can send them to MetaMask Learn. And so that's Learn MetaMask IO and it will walk you through some very basic crypto web. Three concepts. It will also teach you how to manage a wallet, but also teach you so much more. What is digital identity? Why self custody is amazing NFTs and creators? What is DeFi? And so it's this immersive platform, immersive and engaging platform for you to educate yourself or pass along the responsibility of educating others so you don't have to do that heavy lift onto MetaMask Learn. So again, there's a link in the show notes.
00:04:34.254 - 00:04:36.238, Speaker A: Learn MetaMask IO.
00:04:36.414 - 00:04:51.954, Speaker B: This is really cool. You can actually simulate using a MetaMask wallet. It's like a course type structure optimized for learning. So thanks to our friends and sponsors at MetaMask for teeing us up with that. All right, David, let's get to the good stuff. Caffeinated and bullish. You told us about the caffeine.
00:04:51.954 - 00:04:54.762, Speaker B: Now tell us about the bullishness. What is Bitcoin doing on the week?
00:04:54.816 - 00:05:10.574, Speaker A: Bitcoin starting the week at 22,750, and it is now up 5% to 23,880, at least at the time of recording. Actually, no, it's at 24,000 because my numbers are already out of date. So 6%. 6%.
00:05:10.612 - 00:05:12.206, Speaker B: That feels good. I'm happy about that.
00:05:12.228 - 00:05:12.734, Speaker A: That feels good.
00:05:12.772 - 00:05:13.470, Speaker B: How about ETH price.
00:05:13.540 - 00:05:21.026, Speaker A: ETH price. Starting the week at 1566. Ending the week. Oh, we are just oh, we just broke 1700. Oh, that's great.
00:05:21.128 - 00:05:22.898, Speaker B: Hey, happy 1700.
00:05:22.984 - 00:05:24.050, Speaker A: We're back. Yeah.
00:05:24.120 - 00:05:29.750, Speaker B: When was the last time we hit 1700, by the way? I'm zooming out. Look at this chart charting on Kraken Pro.
00:05:29.820 - 00:05:39.058, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah, the Kraken Pro UX is awesome. I've been tinkering around. So you have bitcoin us. Dollars. You have ether US dollars. You have also the BTC ratio.
00:05:39.058 - 00:05:46.746, Speaker A: Those are actually modular and you can drag them around and have multiple window views in the same screen. I mean, I'm not sure if you'll be able to Ryan, because you're not.
00:05:46.768 - 00:05:48.618, Speaker B: A charter, but no other people would.
00:05:48.624 - 00:05:49.562, Speaker A: Be able to figure this out.
00:05:49.616 - 00:05:50.682, Speaker B: Normal people can.
00:05:50.816 - 00:05:52.678, Speaker A: Normal people can figure this out. It's not Ryan.
00:05:52.774 - 00:06:00.058, Speaker B: Not Ryan, though. Well, this is great, man. We're up and we're doing well. I mean, this has been a killer month. Where do we start? At the beginning of January.
00:06:00.154 - 00:06:02.798, Speaker A: Oh, God. It was bad. Something like 1201.
00:06:02.804 - 00:06:03.438, Speaker B: 201.
00:06:03.444 - 00:06:08.046, Speaker A: 200. Yeah. 1200 at the start of the month. We are at one $703 at the time of recording breaking.
00:06:08.078 - 00:06:11.886, Speaker B: We just added 500 ETH in the month of January. In the first day of February ETH.
00:06:11.918 - 00:06:34.602, Speaker A: Yeah. That 1700 number is definitely some strong resistance. We are just poking through it at the time of 140 p. M. Eastern time on Thursday the second. If we can poke through this resistance and hold that, that is a big deal. That's a big 1700 resistance is hard back to mean 4500k would be a large number.
00:06:34.602 - 00:06:54.702, Speaker A: Well, no. So we have to actually break through it and then sustain it. Like we could hit the ceiling and bounce back down. And that's also a possibility. But the fact that we have our eyes above 1700 is pretty damn good. It was up 7% when we were at the price of 1677, but now we're at 17 two. So what is that, eight or 9%?
00:06:54.836 - 00:07:06.260, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, people getting bullish again. And the question is bear market dead is the question. But I got to pause and say, feels like it's been way too easy. It has to kill the big bear market.
00:07:06.950 - 00:07:08.082, Speaker A: It's all in one month.
00:07:08.136 - 00:07:08.402, Speaker B: Right?
00:07:08.456 - 00:07:10.918, Speaker A: So it's moved fast.
00:07:11.004 - 00:07:18.166, Speaker B: Things have been moved fast. It doesn't feel sustainable, at least to me, but what do I know? Let's look at the ETH bitcoin ratio. What's that telling us?
00:07:18.268 - 00:07:29.642, Speaker A: Zero seven almost up to zero 71. Starting the week at zero 69, almost up to zero 71. So definitely good week for the ratio. Up 3%.
00:07:29.776 - 00:07:32.122, Speaker B: We got to be above a trillion. 1.1 trillion.
00:07:32.186 - 00:07:34.926, Speaker A: One point total crypto market. 5 trillion. Yes.
00:07:35.108 - 00:07:37.706, Speaker B: That's only 2 trillion off our all time highs.
00:07:37.738 - 00:07:39.390, Speaker A: Only a casual 2 trillion.
00:07:40.050 - 00:07:41.360, Speaker B: It's not that far.
00:07:41.730 - 00:07:45.890, Speaker A: We've been much further above the 2017 highs. At least there's that.
00:07:46.040 - 00:07:57.330, Speaker B: This is crazy. I think this is Giga bullish. If you're an ultrasound money fan, like David and myself, we are the most deflationary since the merge. I think we've ever been.
00:07:57.400 - 00:07:57.842, Speaker A: That's correct.
00:07:57.896 - 00:08:01.974, Speaker B: All time lows in terms of ETH supply since the merge. Am I right about this?
00:08:02.012 - 00:08:11.174, Speaker A: That is correct. ETH price is at all time high since the merge. ETH supply is at all time low since the merge. That is what I would call nice.
00:08:11.372 - 00:08:34.478, Speaker B: So ETH is selling blocks. That's what this big lead because every time it sells a block, there's a little bit of a burnt ETH. And if that outstrips the amount of ETH issued, then you get the net issuance burn. And that's what we're seeing is burn. So the product is hot. The product is selling, ETH blocks are being sold and ETH, the asset is net deflationary since the merge. It's pretty crazy.
00:08:34.478 - 00:08:44.002, Speaker B: Can we just run that calculation again? So supply chain since the merge. That is in September. September? What was that? September 14. When did the merge happen?
00:08:44.056 - 00:08:45.538, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like I should know that date.
00:08:45.624 - 00:08:55.080, Speaker B: I feel like I should know that. 140 days since the merge. So 140 days ago and we are negative 7000 ETH. Let's just simulate if the merge hadn't happened let me press this button.
00:08:55.610 - 00:09:11.734, Speaker A: Whoa. Point 68 million. Wow. One big difference. Hold on, I'm doing the math. I'm doing the math with my calculator. What are you doing at 1700? I have to turn my iPhone sideways to get the number because it's too big.
00:09:11.734 - 00:09:25.834, Speaker A: $2.7 billion of Ether has not been issued since the merge because of proof of stake. 2.7, actually, two point eight. Two point eight billion dollars has not been minted and sold to miners.
00:09:25.882 - 00:09:38.402, Speaker B: Instead, 2.7 billion of selling pressure removed from the market. We would have had to sell that ETH into the market and ETH price would be a lot. It would be lower than 1700 if the market had to absorb all of that selling pressure through buys.
00:09:38.466 - 00:10:01.370, Speaker A: So instead of issuing $2.8 billion, ether has reclaimed $12 million. 12 million is not a large number compared to 2.8 billion. But the fact that we are reclaiming $12 million of economic energy instead of losing $2.8 billion of economic energy is massive.
00:10:01.950 - 00:10:03.834, Speaker B: I could watch this chart all day.
00:10:04.032 - 00:10:07.198, Speaker A: I could talk about this all day. We know this is like sometimes I.
00:10:07.204 - 00:10:18.926, Speaker B: Do a dividend back to all ETH holders, too right? Because that burn gets evenly distributed, I suppose, in terms of upside to everyone that owns ETH. So this is not a validator feature. You're just an average holder feature.
00:10:19.038 - 00:10:19.700, Speaker A: Yes.
00:10:20.070 - 00:10:34.534, Speaker B: So good. All right, well, we got more markets to cover. Let's talk a little bit about some of the news in the markets. Got to talk about the Fed watch. So the Fmoc meeting happened this week. Did we go higher or lower or did we say the same on the interest rate?
00:10:34.572 - 00:10:43.862, Speaker A: David, the interest rates, Ryan, went up. They went up by 25 basis points, aka zero point 25%. I hate the word basis point. It's so dumb.
00:10:43.926 - 00:10:44.634, Speaker B: You hate that word?
00:10:44.672 - 00:10:45.290, Speaker A: I hate it.
00:10:45.360 - 00:10:46.538, Speaker B: 25 basis points?
00:10:46.624 - 00:10:46.970, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:47.040 - 00:10:48.780, Speaker B: I think it makes 25%.
00:10:49.230 - 00:10:53.614, Speaker A: Yeah, it sounds like you I feel like you have to wear a tie, a suit and a tie to say those words.
00:10:53.732 - 00:11:06.034, Speaker B: I think that most people don't understand what a basis point is out there in the real world. And so saying it automatically makes yourself makes you like a finance bro or something.
00:11:06.072 - 00:11:12.034, Speaker A: Yeah. Quantitative easing. Do you mean money printing? Is that what you mean?
00:11:12.152 - 00:11:30.342, Speaker B: Yeah, I get it. I'm not a huge fan, but I do feel a little cool when I say it sometimes. I'm not going to promise to never say it on Peg list. Don't call me a hypocrite. Anyway, we're off subject, but that is 00:25. 25 basis points is less than usual, right? Because usually it's about 0.5 or zero 75.
00:11:30.342 - 00:11:32.662, Speaker B: Is that what it's been historically for the last few raises?
00:11:32.726 - 00:11:38.986, Speaker A: I think that's right. I think this is the smallest rate hike that we've had since we've started hiking. I think that's correct.
00:11:39.088 - 00:11:54.098, Speaker B: Well, Powell says policy is going to remain restrictive for some time. He says this, we have to complete the job. That's what we're here for. Have to complete the job. That's what we're here for. Staying steady, staying restrictive. But a lot of people say kind of the worst is over.
00:11:54.098 - 00:12:33.886, Speaker B: This was some of the sentiment reflected on our podcast with not only Chris Berninski, that episode came out earlier this week, but also Eric Peters, which he has one, River Capital Management very large crypto hedge fund. David and I caught up with him and talked to him. That episode is coming out not next week, but the week after. He said the same thing. Basically, the worst is over. And so we might still get some more raises, of course, in the future, but the rate of change has slowed. We're beginning the descent, I suppose you might say, and I think that's what the market is reacting to.
00:12:33.886 - 00:12:34.974, Speaker B: Is that why we're up this week.
00:12:35.012 - 00:12:53.010, Speaker A: David, as soon as the 25 basis points news broke, markets across the board, both crypto and Trad markets all pumped bigly. The S and P 500 jumped to 1%, which is a huge move for the S and P. Big move. Big moves.
00:12:53.350 - 00:13:09.670, Speaker B: Try to get yeah, that's a 1% move. Yeah, everyone's excited about that. The Federal Reserve raised rates. Chair Powell says it's premature to declare victory against inflation. So we may have topped on inflation, but premature to declare victory. Yeah, the S and P up 1%.
00:13:09.820 - 00:13:42.370, Speaker A: I would just like to point out just a little bit, genesis Capital was announced going to bankruptcy. The markets did not respond negatively. In fact, they started pumping afterwards. The lower interest rate hike was announced and markets did respond very positively to that. So markets are not being negative to bad news and they are being positive to good news. So those are signals to pay attention to. I think the next big thing is the January CPI print, which will come out in like a week or so.
00:13:42.370 - 00:13:54.950, Speaker A: And if that is negative, that will be the fourth month in a row of negative inflation reporting. And I would expect, if that does happen, that markets would respond positively to that if it does happen.
00:13:55.100 - 00:14:09.702, Speaker B: Happy Music again, but it doesn't feel like it's over. I feel like all of this has been too easy. David, there's something like that in the pit of my stomach. DXY so that is the dollar index down four months in a row. This is a chart that you put up. Why do we care about the dollar strength?
00:14:09.846 - 00:14:19.920, Speaker A: The dollar strength is falling four months in a row, which is just indicating that there is appetite to go out of dollars, sell dollars for other things.
00:14:20.850 - 00:14:41.560, Speaker B: Yeah, that's interesting in the Eurozone. Meanwhile, in Europe, inflation eased more than anticipated. And there's some debate, I guess, being had over the European Central Bank rate policy. What should they do in the future? Should they begin hitting the brakes or what? So similar sentiment happening in Europe at this point in time.
00:14:42.810 - 00:14:47.250, Speaker A: I have no further comments. I would like to talk about tokens now. Can we talk about tokens?
00:14:47.330 - 00:14:50.290, Speaker B: Yes. David has no further comments on the ECB.
00:14:50.370 - 00:14:55.642, Speaker A: I don't have any very much. I would like to talk about the Tokens. Ryan tokens are up.
00:14:55.696 - 00:15:06.170, Speaker B: Token, Caffeinated and Bullish. I told you it was going to happen. What are we looking at? Is this monthly price for Op, Immutable, IMX and Maddox.
00:15:06.690 - 00:15:30.022, Speaker A: These are actually 24 hours prices. However, monthly prices are also yeah, I can't make Coin Gecko report monthly prices. These are the prices in the last 24 hours. Optimism that I could do that screaming to brand new all time highs. Optimism coming in at $2.82. That's up 25% in the last 24 hours. Immutable up 19% in the last 24 hours, maddox up 13% in the last 24 hours.
00:15:30.022 - 00:15:50.566, Speaker A: But monthly price movements are pretty like they're green. They're very green like. Optimism has been hitting all time highs all month. Maddox is coming back very strongly. L, two Tokens are in right now. Big in, dude. You know what's crazy? The optimism fully diluted valuation is basically on par with the Polygon.
00:15:50.566 - 00:15:51.750, Speaker A: Fully diluted valuation?
00:15:51.830 - 00:15:52.410, Speaker B: What?
00:15:52.560 - 00:15:58.526, Speaker A: Yeah. 12.1 billion for Optimism and 12.4 billion for Polygon. Wow.
00:15:58.548 - 00:16:02.254, Speaker B: Now, one big difference is, of course, optimism has a lot more Tokens locked up.
00:16:02.292 - 00:16:02.494, Speaker A: Yes.
00:16:02.532 - 00:16:08.610, Speaker B: If you look at that market cap in terms of liquid supply, it's a lot lower on the optimism.
00:16:09.430 - 00:16:23.782, Speaker A: Something to point out. Yeah. So 600 million is the market cap for optimism. So that's how many Tokens are actually liquid and trading. But the market cap for Polygon is 11 billion. So Polygon has gone through much more price discovery than optimism has.
00:16:23.836 - 00:16:33.194, Speaker B: Did you say IMX too. That's an immutable token. That's up 20% almost in the last 24 hours. Pretty crazy. Well, we got some more tokens here.
00:16:33.232 - 00:16:34.742, Speaker A: More tokens. More tokens.
00:16:34.886 - 00:16:38.026, Speaker B: GMX and Velodrum, they are also doing things.
00:16:38.128 - 00:16:55.239, Speaker A: Yeah. So these are just three tokens, just because that's the space that we have on screen. Three tokens that I picked out. Arbitrum tokens, all kind of just the charts just all look so good. GMX, $68, up 20%. That was the token. That was the only token that actually went up in 2022.
00:16:55.239 - 00:17:16.006, Speaker A: And it's continuing to go up in 2023 so far. Magic is a token that I have exposure to. So Disclaimer is just printing new all time highs. Velodrome, which is a token on optimism, also hitting local highs. The L two trade is on right now, big time l two trade that.
00:17:16.028 - 00:17:39.294, Speaker B: Is carrying over not only to the layer two asset itself, but also to some major flagship tokens in the app layer. On top of them. How about Kanto? So this is another, I think, a layer one story. And we brought this chart in here for a reason. This is the 24 hours view, but I want to look at the 30 freaking day view. Look at this. I'll view it in market cap.
00:17:39.294 - 00:17:58.758, Speaker B: How's that? So we went from a $35 million market cap beginning of January all the way to $230,000,000 market cap at this point in time. Little ten x in January. Wow. Should tokens be doing that? Are we sure about this one? What's happening over in Kanto world?
00:17:58.924 - 00:18:43.774, Speaker A: So variant put out a blog post about their position in Kanto and then also kind of talked about what their deal is with it and why they believe in it. So they call it a layer one incentive experiment. So Kanto, they use a bunch of wild Going West metaphors, which gets me going. And they talk about nationalizing a lot of the infrastructure that gets built and gets it built into the chain. So Kanto has a decentralized exchange, a lending market and a stablecoin all, quote unquote, nationalized public goods built into the chain itself. And so after they released this blog post, it just kind of created attention, sufficient attention on, say, nationalized.
00:18:43.822 - 00:19:04.870, Speaker B: Are you talking about, like, in a similar way? I almost think Terra and Luna. Terra kind of nationalized an algorithmic stablecoin, right? Because it had USDT that was backed by Luna, and it was sort of part of the same the entire ecosystem. Is that kind of what Kanto is doing with some of these protocols?
00:19:04.950 - 00:19:20.046, Speaker A: I think so. But then, like, communicated that point is like, yeah, like, Kanto is taking infrastructure and nationalizing and shrining into the base chain. And then Scott, the founder, was like, that's not right. And so I'm kind of confused about I thought that that's right. And that's what this article says.
00:19:20.228 - 00:19:22.606, Speaker B: Is that what you've been getting on Twitter fights over all morning?
00:19:22.708 - 00:19:23.262, Speaker A: A little bit.
00:19:23.316 - 00:19:34.002, Speaker B: Yeah, well, you know what, we're going to have them on, I think, next week, right. To understand what is happening with Kanto and how this chain is structured. It is not a layer two, though.
00:19:34.056 - 00:19:38.886, Speaker A: No, this is a layer one. We are talking about a layer one right now. Yeah, a different layer one.
00:19:39.068 - 00:19:43.298, Speaker B: What is this built on? Is this built on tenderbint? Is this like Cosmos app chain?
00:19:43.394 - 00:20:03.546, Speaker A: It's an EVM compatible chain. So EVM fork with a bridge to ethereum. I don't know how the bridge works, so bridge at your own risk. But we're having Zach Cole for those that remember Zach Cole, super hilarious guy, used to be at white blocks, just been in the space for a very long time. Very funny guy. Zach Cole's coming on to talk about Kanto.
00:20:03.658 - 00:20:23.634, Speaker B: Interesting. Well, beware of this. I think when a token pumps ten X beware, but also it's something to investigate. So we're going to continue the investigation of that next week. There's some other things that we got to talk about in sort of pump news. One was dYdX. We talked about that a little bit last week.
00:20:23.634 - 00:20:41.382, Speaker B: David, dYdX is pumping because they changed the vesting schedule. I guess more information has come out about that vesting schedule. It seems like maybe mistakes were made. Some of this wasn't smart contract secured. Tell us the story about dYdX's pump and subsequent vesting controversy.
00:20:41.446 - 00:21:26.418, Speaker A: Yeah, so when dYdX kicked out, their vesting unlock like six months, and then it created the dYdX pump that we've seen recently. At least that's how people are analyzing it. And as a result of that, that put attention onto the vesting schedule. So this one on chain sleuth, if you will, on chain investigator went to go check out what the vesting contracts actually looked like and they end up their first tweet on this thread saying it's not pretty. And then so that triggered me to read this thread to go investigate. And I'm reminded of here's a fun little side quest of a story, Ryan. There was this lawyer back in the ICO days that went and actually investigated the claimed smart contracts of the token lockup schedules for teams.
00:21:26.418 - 00:21:53.440, Speaker A: And so teams would say like, hey, here's the team allocation we're vested for this long and we have this much supply. And then the lawyer went and actually investigated the smart contracts to see if the smart contracts of the tokens actually resembled what was stated by the public literature of the ICOs. And he said he discovered something like 85% of ICOs did not actually have their stated vesting schedules codified in the smart contract. It was just like, trust me.
00:21:53.890 - 00:21:55.346, Speaker B: Just a pinky promise, though.
00:21:55.368 - 00:22:03.140, Speaker A: Pinky promise. Yeah, exactly. When you could have put it into a smart contract, you just didn't and said like, oh, we'll just abide by know.
00:22:03.910 - 00:22:04.274, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:04.312 - 00:22:07.700, Speaker A: Guess what? Unbelievable what the name of this professor was?
00:22:08.470 - 00:22:09.782, Speaker B: I don't know. What's the name?
00:22:09.836 - 00:22:11.026, Speaker A: Dave Hoffman.
00:22:11.218 - 00:22:12.280, Speaker B: No way.
00:22:13.450 - 00:22:20.938, Speaker A: Yeah, we follow each other on Twitter. He doesn't really care about the crypto. Really? He doesn't really care about the crypto world. But when the ICO mania was going, he decided, right?
00:22:21.024 - 00:22:27.750, Speaker B: That's right, dave Hoffman. There can only be one David Hoffman. All right, he's on bank list. Go flee to another industry.
00:22:27.830 - 00:22:38.154, Speaker A: Anyways, I think you can see where we're anyways, I think you can see where we're going with this. dYdX did not enforce investing schedules in their smart contract.
00:22:38.282 - 00:22:39.082, Speaker B: A little sloppy.
00:22:39.146 - 00:23:07.846, Speaker A: Whoops. Yeah. Come on, guys. Like, this is what a smart contract does. It does this work for you? And so this spreak, this account went and investigated all of the investor allocations and noticed that people were selling and then later buying back the tokens that they sold. And it's impossible to tell what is an Oopsie versus what is actually being malicious. Brian Armstrong actually is in this list, and I think it's pretty easy to identify that.
00:23:07.846 - 00:23:09.602, Speaker A: Brian Armstrong made a whoopsie.
00:23:09.746 - 00:23:10.674, Speaker B: He's got a lot to lose.
00:23:10.722 - 00:23:41.934, Speaker A: He's got a lot to lose. Yeah. Sold his dYdX allocations and then went and bought it back pretty damn quickly afterwards because they didn't enforce it in the smart contract level. Other investors have very clearly sold their tokens and not bought back their tokens. But I think the speculative conclusion of this Tweet thread person says that it's clearly someone at dYdX in the dYdX comms or compliance are, like, reaching out to people who sold their dYdX tokens and then say, hey, dude, you're still vested. You have to go buy back your tokens.
00:23:41.982 - 00:23:43.774, Speaker B: Look a little bit of sloppiness.
00:23:43.902 - 00:23:44.894, Speaker A: That's really sloppy.
00:23:44.942 - 00:24:11.258, Speaker B: They're trying to unwind it. I guess what I'm excited about is we can see all of we can see you. We got to see it on chain. We had to take that in 2022. The reason DFI held up and CFI didn't was because DFI was regulated and CFI wasn't. DFI was regulated and CFI wasn't. You know how it was regulated, David? Smart contract by code.
00:24:11.424 - 00:24:14.030, Speaker A: Yeah. By code mean the reason why we're here.
00:24:14.180 - 00:25:01.660, Speaker B: Yeah. It was like we had the regulation on chain so you could see what was backing an asset like ave what was backing an asset like compound. We didn't need the regulators, quote, unquote, because that regulation was enforced via code on chain, where anyone can audit it. But when CFI was involved, it actually needed some regulators to step in and make sure that people were respecting the pinky promise and were actually doing what they said they were going to do and that there were penalties if they didn't. So I guess the takeaway here is like, hey, DeFi, let's make sure when we have vesting contracts, let's make sure we are enforcing them via smart contracts, because that's what we have. This we have the tools. Yeah, let's not be dumb about it.
00:25:01.660 - 00:25:04.698, Speaker B: Anyway, what else we got here? This is coinbase.
00:25:04.794 - 00:25:05.210, Speaker A: Coin.
00:25:05.290 - 00:25:10.334, Speaker B: Also up coin. Yes, coin. The token. I almost said it's not a token, is it? What is this?
00:25:10.372 - 00:25:18.814, Speaker A: I wish it was a token. Yeah. So this is this thing called equity. The equity equity ticker symbol is called where is that traded? It is the equity of coinbase. The exchange.
00:25:18.862 - 00:25:20.446, Speaker B: I buy it on Unified, it's traded.
00:25:20.478 - 00:25:24.980, Speaker A: On the Nasdaq and it's also up 150% from the bottom.
00:25:25.910 - 00:25:35.800, Speaker B: There you go. Well, it was ridiculously low before, so we'll see if it can sustain that. But also some good news of maybe out of the bear market.
00:25:36.490 - 00:26:00.606, Speaker A: This was a funny headline. Sell token. The Celsius token rallies 150% after Judge Martin Glenn ordered that Celsius assets put under custody by OpenAI's chat. GPT depositors need a capable, strong decision maker at the helm, said Glenn. Which is why the court has decided to turn full control over Celsius's Asset Management over two chat GBT. Celsius token pumps 150%.
00:26:00.708 - 00:26:02.830, Speaker B: David, you actually got me this time.
00:26:02.900 - 00:26:05.598, Speaker A: Oh, wait, really? You actually got me.
00:26:05.764 - 00:26:06.946, Speaker B: I can't believe that.
00:26:07.048 - 00:26:10.194, Speaker A: Okay, this is the rug. We said that we would do this.
00:26:10.232 - 00:26:13.374, Speaker B: Last week, so I guess I was not paying attention.
00:26:13.502 - 00:26:17.670, Speaker A: We'll be keeping this. Yeah. So this is a rug. So this is the onion of crypto.
00:26:18.010 - 00:26:22.454, Speaker B: This did not actually happen. Celsius didn't even rally, did it?
00:26:22.492 - 00:26:29.286, Speaker A: No. I don't even know. I'm sure it's on the floor, but Ryan got rugged. So congratulations to the team at the rug. Your guys.
00:26:29.308 - 00:26:31.302, Speaker B: Rugged never happened again, though, so yes.
00:26:31.356 - 00:26:45.046, Speaker A: What is the rug if you missed it last week? The rug is the onion of crypto. It's a product out of the bankless dow. You can go to therug Mirror XYZ if you would like to collect this rug. Collect a rug that successfully rugged. Ryan. Ryan got rugged.
00:26:45.158 - 00:26:51.054, Speaker B: Can't believe it. And never happened again. That's one of one. All right. All right. That's markets, David. We got a lot more to cover, though.
00:26:51.054 - 00:26:54.794, Speaker B: Big news stuff what's happening. Coming up next, the list of FTX.
00:26:54.842 - 00:27:24.618, Speaker A: Creditors full of famous names. So we're going to read out famous names that FTX owes some money to. Bitcoin gets NFTs, but the community wants to censor it. And there's also some other stuff as well. There's the Blur versus OpenSea Wars cardano. Ryan gets a stablecoin and bedrock goes the governance vote as well as so much more. But first, a moment to talk about these sponsors that make this episode possible, especially Kraken, which is our preferred exchange for 2023, because Kraken has been around for eleven years and definitely plans to be around for the long term as well.
00:27:24.618 - 00:28:02.962, Speaker A: Here we go. Kraken has been a leader in the crypto industry for the last twelve years.

And if not, sign up with Kraken@kraken.com slash Bankless. How many total airdrops have you gotten? This last bull market had a ton of them. Did you get them all? Maybe you missed one.
00:28:32.414 - 00:28:50.598, Speaker A: So here's what you should do. Go to Earnify and plug in your Ethereum wallet. And Earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get. And it also does poaps and mintable NFTs any kind of money that your wallet can claim. Earnify will tell you about it. And you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire. And if you sign up for Earnify, they'll email you.
00:28:50.598 - 00:29:14.122, Speaker A: Anytime one of your wallets has a new AirDrop for it to make sure that you never lose an AirDrop ever again. You can also upgrade to Earnify premium to unlock access to airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets. And for just under $21 a month, it probably pays for itself with just one AirDrop. So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get. That's Earnifi. And make sure you never lose another AirDrop.
00:29:14.186 - 00:29:32.466, Speaker B: Bitcoin has NFTs. But bitcoin maxis don't actually want this to happen. Of course not, David. This is an interesting story. I've been following a little bit on crypto, twitter nudging there and there in the debate circle as well. But tell us what's happening. How is Bitcoin getting NFTs? I didn't know this was possible.
00:29:32.568 - 00:29:46.966, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's this new protocol called ordinals, which is a protocol that converts individual satoshis. So one satoshi into a non fungible digital artifact, aka NFT. What do you mean by this has caused a bunch of controversy. So this actually what do you mean.
00:29:46.988 - 00:29:51.446, Speaker B: By a satoshi, David? That's like the unit of bitcoin, right? The smallest unit of bitcoin, the equivalent.
00:29:51.478 - 00:29:59.180, Speaker A: Would be a GWe away. A GWe is a thousand away. Away is the smallest unit. God, Ryan, get your ETH maxi hat on.
00:29:59.550 - 00:30:00.394, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:30:00.592 - 00:30:14.122, Speaker A: And so, yes, Ordinals, when taproot came into bitcoin, it created what is kind of like blob space on bitcoin, an extra way to put data into the blockchain.
00:30:14.186 - 00:30:17.026, Speaker B: Bitcoin data availability layer for bitcoin kind.
00:30:17.048 - 00:30:50.918, Speaker A: Of it's not a one to one, but it's the correct mental model to understand this. And so the way that this works is that because there's this extra way to add data to bitcoin, you can add more kinds of data than what would otherwise be a compliant transaction. And so ordinals allows you to mint and store data on the bitcoin blockchain with no external dependencies, no IPFS. And so when you put data like this on the blockchain, the full kind of data is there. So these NFTs are on the bitcoin blockchain forever.
00:30:51.094 - 00:30:56.314, Speaker B: Wait, so the NFTs I'm looking at right now, and by the way, this looks like almost like a sound NFT.
00:30:56.442 - 00:31:00.990, Speaker A: Yeah, it's data, dude. You can put data on bitcoin now through order.
00:31:01.060 - 00:31:16.738, Speaker B: Wow. So, guys, if you're not seeing this on screen, if you're listening to this podcast, what I'm looking at is bitcoin NFTs that are actually on bitcoin. A little slow to load. The Ti 83 takes a little bit to boot. Up here it is different apes, I see.
00:31:16.824 - 00:31:17.074, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:17.112 - 00:31:19.634, Speaker B: These are not board apes. Well, kind of resemble them.
00:31:19.672 - 00:31:21.490, Speaker A: They look like pixelated derivative apes.
00:31:21.570 - 00:31:29.414, Speaker B: I saw some sound files here, some weird stuff, but they look like NFTs. My understanding of these things, David, is like these are fully on chain.
00:31:29.462 - 00:31:29.674, Speaker A: Yes.
00:31:29.712 - 00:31:45.500, Speaker B: So it's not like in IPFS somewhere or our weave. This is actually on the bitcoin blockchain. And you have to pay fees, like bitcoin fees in order to store this data on bitcoin blockchain. Right.
00:31:46.210 - 00:31:48.314, Speaker A: Bitcoin sells gas.
00:31:48.442 - 00:31:49.422, Speaker B: They do too.
00:31:49.556 - 00:31:57.460, Speaker A: Bitcoin just like ethereum. Bitcoin also sells blocks. And so if you would like to put your data on bitcoin, you have to buy that block space.
00:31:57.910 - 00:32:03.730, Speaker B: Well, this sounds great. How exciting. Bitcoin is now entering NFTs. I'm sure everyone was really excited about this.
00:32:03.800 - 00:32:23.002, Speaker A: If people want to consume bitcoin block space and to put data there, they are free to do so. Not everyone was excited about this. This is a nice visualization. So on the left side, we have this website. It's projecting as a projected block. And so these are all transactions. The squares are the size of the data.
00:32:23.002 - 00:32:52.318, Speaker A: So the big squares are like bundles of transactions where the smaller squares are individual transactions. And then on the right, you have an ordinal, which you can see why it takes the whole block. It takes the whole well, because you can you can take up pay for it. Bitcoin is supposed to go up to like 1 normal transaction fees, but because of the way taproot works or SegWit or something, you can go all the way up to four megabytes. And so through Ordinals, you can squeeze in four megabytes of data onto the block.
00:32:52.494 - 00:33:00.406, Speaker B: Just so I understand what I'm looking at. So what are the significance of this? Is a bitcoin a block, right? Right.
00:33:00.588 - 00:33:01.474, Speaker A: These are transactions.
00:33:01.522 - 00:33:06.840, Speaker B: On the left is the purple basically used block space and the green kind of unused block space.
00:33:07.690 - 00:33:26.750, Speaker A: No, I don't know the difference between the colors, the size is the size of data. And the idea is that you can bundle up multiple transactions into one transaction. So, like, a big block on the left side would be like coinbase sending 50 bitcoin transactions at once or 100 bitcoin transactions. A batch. A batch transfer.
00:33:26.820 - 00:33:28.798, Speaker B: Yes. Okay. But then this actual block, what we're.
00:33:28.804 - 00:33:33.094, Speaker A: Saying, this blue block takes, the whole thing is an NFT. That's an NFT on bitcoin.
00:33:33.242 - 00:33:33.794, Speaker B: Wow.
00:33:33.912 - 00:33:34.338, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:34.424 - 00:33:37.506, Speaker B: So they're selling block space. That's a good thing.
00:33:37.688 - 00:33:57.014, Speaker A: Big block revenue. Big block revenue. So this is Casey excuse me, rotimore, who is the creator of Ordinals. And there has been a bunch of resistance from the bitcoin world about this and how some have said it is an illegitimate use of bitcoin. Illegitimate transactions are the words that they.
00:33:57.052 - 00:34:00.514, Speaker B: Before we get to Casey's take, can we talk about some of the pushback.
00:34:00.562 - 00:34:10.830, Speaker A: Against wait, let's show the revenue chart. Go up. Go scroll up and show the revenue chart. Okay, that one. This yeah. Or excuse me, that's not revenue, but that's block size. But it's kind of the same thing.
00:34:10.830 - 00:34:22.558, Speaker A: So Ordinals are inflating block sizes and weights, also generating fees for miners. And so block sizes up. Block fees are up and miners are making more money.
00:34:22.644 - 00:34:26.670, Speaker B: All right, David, so what's the controversy? They're selling blocks. Why are people upset?
00:34:26.750 - 00:34:56.986, Speaker A: Well, when you take all of that block space and you allow it to be for an NFT, you're pushing out what bitcoin maxis are calling legitimate bitcoin transactions, as in BTC transfers, which is the narrative of what the point of bitcoin is, is bitcoin. What does bitcoin do? It transfers bitcoins from account to account. When you fill up all that space with a JPEG, you get reactions like this. Who is? This is Dr. Nick. Which I'm going to guess is a bitcoin maxi. Evil JPEGs are invading the sacred bitcoin block space.
00:34:57.088 - 00:34:58.518, Speaker B: This also could be satire.
00:34:58.614 - 00:35:25.250, Speaker A: This also could be satire. But the point is that that is people's takes. That is a bitcoin take that we've seen with takes like it. Right, so here's Adam Back saying it's fair game for miners to censor this crap as a form of discouragement, saying like, yeah, okay, we don't have to allow this crap into our blockchain like miners to just not allow these transactions to make it into the chain, which is a take. That's a take.
00:35:25.320 - 00:35:47.590, Speaker B: Yeah. He's saying we can reckon Adam back again. We can recognize, we can't really stop them. And it's a free world with anonymous miners, but we can also educate and encourage developers who care about bitcoin's use case to either not do that or to do it in a prunable space. Efficient, eg timestamp way. They're trying to enforce this on the social layer, I suppose, because they don't have any other recourse. And including in the social layer is also miners.
00:35:47.590 - 00:36:00.874, Speaker B: Maybe if you could convince miners not to process these sorts of blocks, then maybe you've got something. But aren't miners just rationally, interested actors? And so they'll just mine. Whatever block, they'll take the largest fee.
00:36:00.922 - 00:36:07.806, Speaker A: Yeah. They want as much bitcoin as possible, so they take the highest fee as possible. And the highest fee is going to be paid by NFTs.
00:36:07.918 - 00:36:10.882, Speaker B: What's Eric Wallace take on the bitcoin takes here?
00:36:11.016 - 00:36:29.190, Speaker A: So this is a response to how bitcoiners are talking about how Ethereum is, quote, unquote, censored because of OFAC, even though that's completely not true. So Eric eric is saying bitcoin maxis rofflecoptered at Ethereum validators censoring OFAC transactions. When's the last time you heard the word rofflecopter?
00:36:29.270 - 00:36:30.220, Speaker B: Middle school.
00:36:31.630 - 00:36:39.098, Speaker A: And now themselves are deliberating ways of censoring bitcoin, NFTs. And so the irony is not lost on Eric wall. Nor myself.
00:36:39.264 - 00:36:44.238, Speaker B: Okay. Nor me. This is the creator of this protocol. What's the protocol called again?
00:36:44.324 - 00:36:45.130, Speaker A: Ordinals.
00:36:45.210 - 00:36:49.278, Speaker B: Ordinals. Okay. This is the creator of Ordinals. And what is he saying here?
00:36:49.364 - 00:37:15.814, Speaker A: I understand the argument that NFTs are lame and stupid, but I don't understand the argument that NFTs are somehow illegitimate. Bitcoin has transcended its original creator and purpose. Bitcoin is not for some things and not for other things. Bitcoin just is. Which is just to say that there is no such thing as a legitimate or illegitimate use of bitcoin block space. If you pay for the block space, it's a legitimate transaction, is my attitude. And that's what Casey is saying as well.
00:37:15.852 - 00:37:18.982, Speaker B: How come this guy sounds more bitcoiner than Adam and Back does right now?
00:37:19.036 - 00:37:22.250, Speaker A: I don't know. Because some bitcoiners have lost the plot.
00:37:22.670 - 00:37:24.300, Speaker B: What are these? What's this?
00:37:24.750 - 00:37:33.306, Speaker A: Looks like Ether rocks were transposed to the bitcoin blockchain. Ether rocks and NFT. So now there's a bunch of Ethereum. Ether rock people. Mad bitcoin. Yeah.
00:37:33.408 - 00:37:35.878, Speaker B: Those things go, is this the doom that you were talking about?
00:37:35.904 - 00:37:44.430, Speaker A: Inscription. So this is what I was tinkering around with. I couldn't figure out how to turn. But you can probably play that, right? You can probably play that right now. It's hit WASD on your keyboard.
00:37:45.410 - 00:37:46.014, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:46.132 - 00:37:47.474, Speaker A: You're playing doom. Shoot those guys.
00:37:47.512 - 00:37:49.550, Speaker B: Shoot them with spacebar.
00:37:49.710 - 00:37:55.182, Speaker A: I don't know. Actually, people are trying to figure out how to control this thing. I've only figured out how I can go forward, backward.
00:37:55.246 - 00:37:55.986, Speaker B: I'm down.
00:37:56.088 - 00:37:59.142, Speaker A: But Ryan is currently playing doom on bitcoin right now.
00:37:59.276 - 00:38:14.506, Speaker B: Wow, what a magical experience. Who said bitcoin is useless? Do you know what? Here's what I feel about this debate, though. Like, transaction fees are real down. Oh, I just got shot, dude. I'm escaping out of this game. Let's go to crypto fees for these guys. Kill me.
00:38:14.506 - 00:38:19.526, Speaker B: Go to cryptofees info. Let's look at the transaction fees. So Ethereum is selling.
00:38:19.718 - 00:38:22.860, Speaker A: You haven't seen bitcoin this high in such a long time.
00:38:23.650 - 00:38:45.666, Speaker B: Bitcoin is selling. This is average daily fees, 4.2 million for Ethereum. Average daily fees are 328k for bitcoin. I remember a time I remember a time when bitcoin was way bigger than ethereum in terms of transaction fees. And I remember people like Nick Carter would actually talk about this and say how good this was for bitcoin, showed the strength of bitcoin. Now it's way down.
00:38:45.666 - 00:39:05.850, Speaker B: If you are a bitcoiner, don't you want to increase bitcoin block space sales? Because over time, your issuance goes to zero. It's going to go to zero. And then the only way you can actually secure your network is through block space fee sales. So you want these to be as high as possible, don't you? What am I missing here?
00:39:05.920 - 00:39:40.210, Speaker A: Well, so the bitcoiner philosophy is that this removes the moneyness of bitcoin. So the comparison here is that gold, the value of gold is like 99.99% monetary premium and like 0.1% use in industry, like gold wires, like gold teeth, gold plating on stuff like that. And bitcoiner philosophy is that it's bullish that to have only monetary premium and no utility because you're just a money. And that is that immaculate conception story. It's all about premium, premium, premium.
00:39:40.290 - 00:40:02.510, Speaker B: I get that. But in order to do that, you actually have to win that narrative battle and make bitcoin enough money so that the bitcoin transactions crowd out all of the other use of bitcoin block space. You have to earn that. You can't just this is the way we want it. Bitcoin has to earn those blocks, doesn't it?
00:40:02.580 - 00:40:21.234, Speaker A: Sure. Yes. So what's happening here is that bitcoin is actually growing in utility, as in, hey, we can use the bitcoin block space to store data and do things with those data. Now, fun fact, this is actually the same philosophy as bitcoin satoshi's vision, which is definitely not, I don't claim to.
00:40:21.352 - 00:40:24.734, Speaker B: Understand the scam project by Craig Wright.
00:40:24.862 - 00:40:53.394, Speaker A: Yes, that's right. Yeah. Whether it's definitely not satoshi's vision, not that I know what satoshi's vision was, but no one knows what satoshi's vision was. But the idea of satoshi's vision is, like, they had something like gigabyte sized blocks or something like 256 megabyte sized blocks, something crazy. And they would just have it weather, like, just log the weather date of the world. And they started with weather data. But the idea was that you would just be able to put all the data on bitcoin, bitcoin SV.
00:40:53.394 - 00:41:10.174, Speaker A: And so this is a little bit on that spectrum, right? Like enough, like four megabytes for NFTs on bitcoin so that you can host data on bitcoin and generate block space demand for that. So that's kind of what's happening here. And then bitcoiners are like, no, bitcoin is for money and money alone.
00:41:10.302 - 00:41:13.406, Speaker B: We should say some bitcoiners more the fundamentalist tribe.
00:41:13.438 - 00:41:16.610, Speaker A: Sorry, I don't mean to blanket all bitcoiners.
00:41:17.190 - 00:41:21.206, Speaker B: It's interesting. It's very interesting to see how this kind of evolves over time.
00:41:21.228 - 00:41:45.546, Speaker A: David and in order to facilitate these conversations, because that's what bankless does, we like to facilitate conversation. I'm hosting Eric Wall and Casey Rodimer. Rodimer we're recording tonight. We might be live streaming. And if we're not live streaming, then we'll release it later. But the creator of Ordinals Plus, Eric Wall, who's my Bitcoiner substitute co host on Bankless, to come in and talk about this. So we're recording that tonight.
00:41:45.546 - 00:41:46.830, Speaker A: That show will be out soon.
00:41:46.980 - 00:42:05.982, Speaker B: That will be fascinating. All right, let's talk about FTX. So, FTX creditor list, it was released, and it includes a whole bunch of star athletes, crypto firms, and state governments. David, who does FTX owe money at this point? What are some of the names? Give us the juicy details.
00:42:06.046 - 00:42:08.118, Speaker A: I think I can do this all in one breath. You ready?
00:42:08.204 - 00:42:09.062, Speaker B: Yeah, go.
00:42:09.196 - 00:42:39.886, Speaker A: Okay list of creditors are apple, Amazon, Web Services, meta, LinkedIn, Twitter, Netflix, Adobe, Coinbase, binance Capital Management Chainalysis, yuga Labs, doodles, BlockFi, Silvergate Bank, Wall Street Journal, CoinDesk, ben Zynga, Tom Brady, david Ortiz from the Red Sox, the Prime Minister of Bahamas, other government officials for other island nations as well as US. State tax, consumer affairs and Attorney general offices. That was just the names that we decided to say. There are other names as well.
00:42:39.988 - 00:42:58.758, Speaker B: Nice job. You need a breath. This just in as well. A judge rules the identities of two people who helped secure SBF's $250,000,000 bail can be made public. So outstanding question is, how did SBF get the money for bail? Because I thought his account was down to kind of zero at this point.
00:42:58.764 - 00:43:10.618, Speaker A: And everything else was 100,000. He has 100,000, so he says. We are about to find out who posted $250,000,000 of bail. Probably also where that money came from, but no, we do not know yet.
00:43:10.704 - 00:43:12.454, Speaker B: Who do you think it was? Any guesses?
00:43:12.582 - 00:43:13.450, Speaker A: CZ.
00:43:15.310 - 00:43:20.378, Speaker B: The least likely person to do it would be CZ. Gotta have some friends with a lot.
00:43:20.384 - 00:43:23.934, Speaker A: Of money, I guess is who still.
00:43:23.972 - 00:43:27.198, Speaker B: Is SBF's friend with a lot of money at this point.
00:43:27.284 - 00:43:28.746, Speaker A: I hope he's a Democrat.
00:43:28.858 - 00:43:31.280, Speaker B: A lot of the friends. Why do you hope this?
00:43:31.730 - 00:43:33.418, Speaker A: Because of peak drama.
00:43:33.594 - 00:43:36.674, Speaker B: Okay. David is optimizing for peak drama right now.
00:43:36.712 - 00:43:38.180, Speaker A: Optimizing for drama, right?
00:43:38.710 - 00:43:47.282, Speaker B: Like, because he's lost his friends a lot of money. It's hard to imagine any friend who would have this kind of yeah, yeah.
00:43:47.336 - 00:43:51.522, Speaker A: That'S a good point. There's zero people who have to consider themselves SVF friends anymore.
00:43:51.666 - 00:44:21.502, Speaker B: I don't know, maybe still got some friends for some reason. There's also some maybe evidence. It's hard to know of witness tampering here. This is a tweet from Tier Ten K, the account I should mention. We haven't checked this as a source, so I'm not sure 100%. But this is allegedly an email from Sam Bankman Fried, to possibly a witness in the entire FDX case. And this is SBF saying, hey, Blank, I know it's been a while since we've talked.
00:44:21.502 - 00:44:39.110, Speaker B: I know things have ended up in the wrong foot. I would really love to reconnect and see if there's a way for us to have a constructive relationship, use each other as resources when possible, or at least vet things with each other. What do you think is the implication of this type of an email? Assuming it's true, david.
00:44:41.210 - 00:44:49.286, Speaker A: It'S easy to tell an email when the through line is, hey, I have a request of you. That's basically what this email he's saying.
00:44:49.308 - 00:44:51.914, Speaker B: Let'S get our story straight before we go in there.
00:44:52.032 - 00:45:07.018, Speaker A: Yeah. Also, can you please help me spin my narrative? What's interesting, apparently there was multiple emails like this. So this is just one email. There's other emails like here, here's another one. Almost the same copy pasta. So here's a different email to a different person. Hey, Ray.
00:45:07.018 - 00:45:21.280, Speaker A: Hey, Mr. Ray. Who is this? Ray. John Ray. I know things haven't gotten off on the right foot, but I do want to be helpful, whether on the funds or on anything else. Hopefully it's just you guys moving the funds. I don't know what that means, but it's not good.
00:45:21.280 - 00:45:36.342, Speaker A: As I'm guessing you heard, I'm in New York City for the next day. I'd love to meet up. I'm here. Or even if just to say hi. Why does SPF have enough time on his hands to just say hi to people? In case you're available, I'm free before noon Eastern, or from roughly four to six tomorrow. Tuesday in the city.
00:45:36.476 - 00:45:38.354, Speaker B: Why is he writing New York?
00:45:38.492 - 00:45:42.410, Speaker A: Yo, SBF. Come over to my place.
00:45:42.560 - 00:45:44.490, Speaker B: You want SBF to come over to your house?
00:45:44.560 - 00:45:55.440, Speaker A: Yeah, I've got a studio here in the back. I'll sit right there, and SBF will sit right there and we'll do a podcast. SBF. Come on, send me an email.
00:45:55.890 - 00:45:57.150, Speaker B: Send me an email like this.
00:45:57.220 - 00:45:57.742, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:57.876 - 00:46:11.906, Speaker B: Dear Mr. Hoffman, I know the last conversation you had was somewhat contentious. I'm here to make amends. First, I wanted to say I'm sorry. I'd be happy to swing by your place. Don't do it, David. Well, you know what? This is what's happening.
00:46:11.906 - 00:46:31.114, Speaker B: Of course, some things like that, rumors like that, maybe these are real emails and correspondences. So a federal judge just barred SBF from contacting any of these people, any of the people at FTX, and any of the people at Alameda via Signal. Apparently he was doing this via Signal as well. So to try to put a stop.
00:46:31.152 - 00:46:44.794, Speaker A: To that, to add on to that, in addition to he is now banned from contacting FTX and Alameda employees, he is also banned from using Signal at all to contact anyone because he is not allowed to use Signal.
00:46:44.842 - 00:46:48.330, Speaker B: Yes. Dad says no more signal. Sorry, SBF.
00:46:48.490 - 00:46:58.514, Speaker A: So allegedly, he reached out to FTX US's general Counsel Ryan Miller via signal. And I'm guessing Ryan Miller went straight to the authorities, which is probably why we know that.
00:46:58.632 - 00:47:06.786, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you'd probably want to do that at this point. By the way, David, if you do get DM'd by SBF, you should probably like I don't know, would I get.
00:47:06.808 - 00:47:14.242, Speaker A: In trouble for not reporting that to the authorities. If SBF DM me on signal and he was like, let's do a podcast, do I have to report that to the authorities?
00:47:14.306 - 00:47:16.210, Speaker B: What else he said after that sentence?
00:47:16.290 - 00:47:17.686, Speaker A: I think SBF hit me up.
00:47:17.708 - 00:47:33.114, Speaker B: Brother and brother are not cooperating with the financial probe, apparently. It's very weird how his family is tied up into this. And I'm sure we'll see some more Unfolding there as soon as the documentary comes up. Produced by Mark Wahlberg.
00:47:33.162 - 00:47:34.142, Speaker A: This is Marky Mark.
00:47:34.196 - 00:47:38.320, Speaker B: This is not a rug. This should be your rug like news article. Marky Mark.
00:47:39.250 - 00:47:46.190, Speaker A: That's a difficult ask, Ryan to make the rug produce the most ridiculous headlines in this space. That is a hard ask.
00:47:46.340 - 00:48:00.600, Speaker B: So I've heard there are many different documentaries. So Marky Mark's going to have his work cut out for him if he's going to produce the canonical documentary. This one's about FTX and Binance, though. Some sort of rivalry. Wow. How weird is this?
00:48:01.050 - 00:48:05.622, Speaker A: Mark Wahlberg making a documentary about FTX. This is a great time.
00:48:05.676 - 00:48:07.320, Speaker B: I just wish he starred in it.
00:48:10.010 - 00:48:11.126, Speaker A: We deserve this.
00:48:11.228 - 00:48:11.926, Speaker B: We deserve this.
00:48:11.948 - 00:48:18.582, Speaker A: Crypto deserves this in a good way. Yeah. We've gone through so much pain. We need Marky Mark to Marky Mark. He's only producing it, David.
00:48:18.646 - 00:48:19.210, Speaker B: I need him.
00:48:19.280 - 00:48:20.170, Speaker A: He's not in it.
00:48:20.240 - 00:48:33.470, Speaker B: No, he's fine. I mean, he would make a great let me see marky Mark, who's he the most like in crypto. He can be. There's no one like Marky Mark in crypto. Do you have any analog?
00:48:34.530 - 00:48:36.762, Speaker A: I'm not very good at Brian Armstrong.
00:48:36.826 - 00:48:38.340, Speaker B: No, I can close.
00:48:39.110 - 00:48:40.818, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know.
00:48:40.984 - 00:48:51.320, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. Anyway, Marky Mark's only producing and he's not acting in it. So that's the news this week. Those are the big news items. David, what do we got coming up next? Why should people stick around?
00:48:52.170 - 00:49:22.634, Speaker A: You should stick around because this is apparently a very giggly episode. Ethereum OFAC compliance. Is it up or down? Place your bets. Also, after that, which communities are willing to self limit their staking percentage for the sake of the ethereum economy? We also got talks about optimism, bedrock staking withdrawals testnet, immutable, X harmony, mismanaging funds and bullying workers. We're going to talk about that. It doesn't look good. The Blur and open Sea Wars cardano stablecoin.
00:49:22.634 - 00:49:56.182, Speaker A: We are able to look inside of WorldCoin Orb. There's so many reasons to stick around, so don't go anywhere. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this episode possible. Uniswap is the largest on chain marketplace for self custody digital assets. Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange, but you know this because you've been listening to Bankless. But did you know that the Uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat onramp? Now, you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in DFI inside of Uniswap. Not only that, but polygon Arbitrum and optimism.
00:49:56.182 - 00:50:29.590, Speaker A: Layer twos are supported right out of the gate. But that's just DFI. Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, letting you find more listings for the best prices across the NFT world. With Uniswap, you can sweep floors on multiple NFTs, and Uniswap's universal router will optimize your gas fees for you. Uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across Ethereum, and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor. So go to app Uniswap.org today to buy, sell, or swap tokens and NFTs.
00:50:29.590 - 00:51:23.878, Speaker A: Arbitram One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web Three landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems. With a recent addition of Arbitrum, nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home. Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees. With Arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro, it's also now ten times faster than before. Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum experience, web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap, and friction free.
00:51:23.964 - 00:51:44.218, Speaker B: Let's start this off with some good news. Did you know, David, OFAC compliant blocks are now down? They're less than 60%. That is down from something like 80% to 85% at their peak. First of all, refresh people, what are we talking about when we say OFAC compliant blocks? We're talking the context of Ethereum. And why is that being down a good thing? Why are we saying that's a good thing?
00:51:44.304 - 00:52:15.746, Speaker A: Yeah. So there are certain sets of block relayers. There's not that many of them. And some of them have stated, hey, we are an OFAC compliant relayer, as in we will not process any Tornado Cast transactions in our blocks. And so the percentage of blocks going through these relayers is what we're looking at here. And so, over time, more and more of these relayers were processing more and more of the Ethereum blocks being OFAC compliant that hit 85% at the peak, I think is what you said. It's worth noting that it only takes one relayer to process non OFAC compliant blocks.
00:52:15.746 - 00:52:22.954, Speaker A: So Ethereum doesn't like your Tornado Cast transaction if you're outside of the US. Doesn't get Censored, unless one can never.
00:52:22.992 - 00:52:25.450, Speaker B: Really be Censored, it can never really be slowed down.
00:52:25.520 - 00:52:45.200, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. And so even at 99.9% of OFAC compliance, you are still able to get your transaction in. You just have to wait longer. Like you said, peaked out at 85%. We are now down to 60%. And this number is falling because there are more and more non OFAC compliant relays coming up and online.
00:52:45.200 - 00:52:55.950, Speaker A: Ultrasound money. The ultrasound website that we love so much has a relayer. There's Agnostic Boost, which has a relayer. And this is just going to trend towards zero over time. Not totally.
00:52:56.030 - 00:52:57.220, Speaker B: It'll never be completely.
00:52:58.230 - 00:53:11.174, Speaker A: People will want to maintain compliance with their nation state like shocker. But the fear and FUD around this thing was always totally misguided. And like Ryan and I said, it was going to inevitably fix itself and we are currently watching that play out.
00:53:11.292 - 00:53:20.982, Speaker B: A lowest it's been since October 2022. Why do we care so much about this is because the credible neutrality and censorship resistance of a layer one blockchain matters.
00:53:21.046 - 00:53:21.910, Speaker A: Yeah, all right.
00:53:22.000 - 00:53:47.954, Speaker B: If it's not OFAC, it's somebody else trying to censor you. And that's a bad thing for a credibly neutral settlement layer for the world. David Ethereum news as well. The Staking withdrawal testnet has just gone live. That means it's coming, right? We said that last week, but still on track. It looks like the upgrade to Ethereum that will enable withdrawals, withdrawals of stake is coming pretty fast. Yeah.
00:53:47.992 - 00:54:12.166, Speaker A: Users will be able to try out the various withdrawals and deposit features six days after the testnet launches when it will be implemented in the Shanghai and Capella testnets. And so users will can try out depositing to validators, get a sense for how the user interface will behave, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, on track for withdrawals in late March. But that late March timeline is a timeline. That is my speculation. That is not any official timeline.
00:54:12.358 - 00:54:23.962, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm sure we'll have a lot of content about what's going to happen to ETH Price around that. Could it go up? Could it go down? We will see some news from optimism bedrock is to be deployed. What is bedrock?
00:54:24.026 - 00:54:57.382, Speaker A: Bedrock is the new optimism main net and so it is the first application of the Op stack which I am super bullish on. And so the optimism's bedrock is their flavor of the Op stack. Op stack is like this uniform skeleton for producing any sort of optimism chain. And so optimism bedrock is the proposal to have the optimism layer two upgrade to bedrock is now being put forth to the Token house. So this is the optimism dual house governance model. You have the citizens house and the Token house. The Token house is of course the Op token holders.
00:54:57.382 - 00:55:32.630, Speaker A: The Citizen house is the holders of a soul bound NFT that makes you part of the optimism collective. It's basically like non fungible governance plus fungible governance. So not just token vote but also known citizens of the Citizen house making proposals and then the Op Token house voting and to approve or not approve. So this is bedrock is the next crucial upgrade to a modular, simplified and performant multi chain future. And like I said, it implements the modular architecture that separates the Op stack into its three components consensus, execution and settlement.
00:55:33.290 - 00:56:13.026, Speaker B: Yeah, pretty cool. The way I think of it, very simply, is it turns optimism into sort of an app chain ecosystem where anybody can spin up an optimistic roll up chain. Yes, it sets to have an EVM for that. Yes. This is some interesting culture wars between RPL, the rocket pool community and lido. This is the tweet from Nixo saying, absolutely wild how different two protocol votes can look when one community is active, invested in long term health of the chain, and the other is there for dominance and short term gains. That might be a rocket pool sided tweet there, but what is actually happening? What is the neutral way to interpret what's happened? Some on chain vote, what were they voting about? Yeah.
00:56:13.048 - 00:56:46.590, Speaker A: So lido voted as to whether or not they should self limit. And what this means is that if you are above a certain threshold of the percentage of ethereum stake, that threshold being 33%, you have more powers than you would have if you had less than 33%. So things are more decentralized if something like lido were to have 33% of all ethereum stake. So lido, once upon a time, voted, do we self limit ourselves to preserve the credible neutrality of ethereum? And 99.8% of lido voters said, no, don't self limit.
00:56:46.930 - 00:56:48.286, Speaker B: That was back in June, by the way.
00:56:48.308 - 00:57:20.166, Speaker A: This was a long time ago. Yes, but what's news is that? Rocket pool just did the vote for the same vote, saying, should rocket pool self limit ourselves and not go above that 33% threshold? And 100% of rocket pool votes said yes. And so this is just the difference of culture here. And so the Anthony cesano take is that it shouldn't need to be said, but that lido is a for profit company, while rocket pool is a protocol that attempts to establish credible neutrality. So culture wars, here we go.
00:57:20.188 - 00:57:22.682, Speaker B: Yeah, culture wars. I mean, both approaches will be tried, certainly.
00:57:22.736 - 00:57:44.106, Speaker A: What is the it's also worth noting, and just to check our biases here, ryan and I and bankless are part of the o dao for rocket pool. So we do own a supply of rocket pool. We do own a supply of RPL. We also stake with rocket pool. So we have exposure to the rocket pool side of things. The reason why we do that is because rocket pool tends to be more aligned with ethereum. So bankless tends to be more aligned with rocket pool.
00:57:44.106 - 00:57:45.806, Speaker A: I think that's a fair take. Is that a fair take?
00:57:45.908 - 00:57:50.462, Speaker B: That's a fair take. But we also have some lido tokens, too, david and lido has been a sponsor in the past.
00:57:50.516 - 00:57:51.694, Speaker A: Yeah, I did not know that.
00:57:51.732 - 00:57:52.766, Speaker B: The more you know, I did not know that.
00:57:52.788 - 00:57:54.106, Speaker A: We own lido tokens.
00:57:54.218 - 00:57:57.026, Speaker B: We're we're bullish staking generally.
00:57:57.058 - 00:57:58.438, Speaker A: Bullish staking? Yes.
00:57:58.604 - 00:58:28.160, Speaker B: Immutable x, they rolled out a passport. This is instant wallet onboarding. It says the immutable passport is a noncustodial wallet and authentication solution that streamlines user onboarding through passwordless sign on. Here's a problem. If you're trying to onboard a whole bunch of gamers, David, you have to make them create private keys. And remember, a twelve word seed phrase or 24 word seed phrase, that's pretty hard for gamers. I just want to play my game, right? What are you giving me these words if I lose and they're gone.
00:58:28.160 - 00:58:46.546, Speaker B: Well, this is instant. Onboarding takes care of that through Immutable X and it creates an authentication solution. I'm also reminded, you know, of our news last week where Doodles was like, hey, we're moving blockchains. We're moving from ethereum to flow. Why? Because we want people to be able to sign in with their Gmail account. Just an email account. Flow gives us that out of the box.
00:58:46.648 - 00:58:48.278, Speaker A: And also money.
00:58:48.444 - 00:59:14.938, Speaker B: Well, maybe that's the cynical take, maybe the accurate take. It's also the cynical take. But Immutable X is graduating to that as well. Obviously, a core requirement to Onboard the world is we have to make private key management a lot easier. So that's what they're doing. David Harmony execs mismanaged funds and bullied workers ex staff claimed that is the headline. What is going on in Harmony? And by the way, what is Harmony? Another layer one ETH killer from the previous cycle.
00:59:15.034 - 00:59:42.274, Speaker A: Harmony is one of those many EVM clones out there that tried to fight for relevancy in the alt layer one mania, they were at ETH Denver. They flew in some DJ, some famous DJ, for like half a million dollars at ETH Denver. And the DJ this is a story that I've heard from previous Harmony employees. The DJ was like, you have to buy me a complete DJ set for this one set. And they did. Cool. Anyways, mismanagement of funds, not no surprise.
00:59:42.274 - 01:00:14.126, Speaker A: So some quotes from the article. Former contractors accused Harmony co founders of misconduct and mismanagement. There's one of the founders of Harmony, I don't know how to pronounce his name, Tse had this kind of Adam Newman type cult mentality around him. So he exhibited some particular behavior which I would consider extremely toxic. Shutting staffers laptop in the middle of work to command attention. Employees were forced to play over an hour of basketball every single day, despite how busy or productive you were trying to be.
01:00:14.228 - 01:00:15.514, Speaker B: Wait, that's not normal.
01:00:15.642 - 01:00:44.794, Speaker A: No. Then there was multiple stories about how, say Tse again, I don't know how to pronounce the name would grab staff by the arm and move them around like chess pieces at company events, talk behind their backs and belittle them in front of colleagues and associates. And also, quote, would often stand up in front of us and say, I want to cry. Make me cry. And he would ask us to tell a story to try and make him cry, which was very weird. They were hiring full time employees and paying them as contractors. And the contractors didn't get time off or other benefits.
01:00:44.794 - 01:00:52.940, Speaker A: Again, from the article say was physically assaultive in Harmony's Palo Alto office by One Wallet co founder. I don't know how to pronounce that name. Sorry.
01:00:53.390 - 01:01:01.946, Speaker B: There was a fight. He was physically assaulted. Man. The amount of documentaries you can make in crypto, you just got to find the right one to do that's.
01:01:01.978 - 01:01:55.534, Speaker A: Not the end of this. One Wallet was an application, I think, that was given a bunch of money? Yes. Was promised $1 million grants to build a social Wallet, say ignored messages from One Wallet about this funding promise, and so promised funding didn't pay them, and then, yeah, it's pretty bad. The other story I have, which is a story from a friend of mine, is that the employees or contractors of Harmony were paid in the token, and so they were given a token at a certain price to compensate them for their salary as a contractor. So the token was marked at a certain price and then was sent to the contractors a few weeks later. And over the course of 2022, that token price was down only. And so they were never actually receiving the amount of money that they were given in their contract because they didn't pay them in USDC or Stablecoins.
01:01:55.534 - 01:02:32.458, Speaker A: They paid them in the L one token. The issue that is going that this particular person who used to be a contractor for Harmony is having is that they are now, two days before the deadline, having to they were given some W two some IRS statement saying, like, okay, here's how much we paid you. You have to pay this much in taxes. But the Harmony incentive is to inflate how much compensation they had so they can write it off for tax benefits, which means that all of their statements, their claimed amount of compensation paid to contractors is overinflated because they're trying to.
01:02:32.464 - 01:02:34.718, Speaker B: Overinflate to pay tax on the overinflated money.
01:02:34.804 - 01:02:57.618, Speaker A: Exactly right. And they never actually got the money out. And so the story of Harmony is like, you have this cult leader, l one founder, and the token price went way too high. They mismanaged money. They paid for DJs. They're throwing their contractors under the bus. And the reason why I really wanted to pay attention to this is this is some of the stuff that, as an industry, we have to make sure does not exist in our industry, and we need to self regulate against it.
01:02:57.624 - 01:03:21.006, Speaker B: And it's such a hard, so dumb last cycle. Like, last cycle, people are so dumb. I mean, in Harmony, even specifically, people are like, why does Bankless not have Harmony on the podcast? Were you guys ETH maximalists? Why don't you cover other l one ecosystems? I'm like, we don't have to cover every l one ecosystem. I don't know anything about this. The way it's presenting seems a little strange. It seems a little anti crypto values. Now you find out all of this.
01:03:21.006 - 01:03:39.678, Speaker B: This is why we're not bringing everybody on bankless and advocating for their projects. There's a lot of toxicity here. What a poorly named project, though? Harmony. Everything you described is a little bit the opposite of Harmony, I'd say. And yeah, it's a shame.
01:03:39.774 - 01:03:52.280, Speaker A: Yeah. Big cringe, Harmony. So the idea is, like, Harmony is trying to get compliant with the US government because they know the eye is on them. Meanwhile, they're just throwing all of their previous workers under the bus in order to do so. Harmony be better.
01:03:53.530 - 01:04:09.066, Speaker B: I'm just happy to kind of move on, leave projects like that, founders like that in the dust. Bit of history here. NFT stuff, though, there is a war going on. Did you know, David, between Blur versus OpenSea? Tell us about it. This is a tweet from Panda Jackson giving us the TLDR. What is it?
01:04:09.168 - 01:04:31.086, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is a really good Tweet thread. So I'm going to try and speed run this, but I'm going to read the whole thing. OpenSea and Blur are the top two NFT marketplaces. Three months ago, OpenSea defended against Blur by requiring new collections to block Blur in order to get enforced royalties. This was not necessarily like, hey, don't use our competitor. This is Opensea's enforcing royalty philosophy.
01:04:31.086 - 01:04:34.286, Speaker A: And Blur doesn't enforce royalties. And so these are antagonistic.
01:04:34.318 - 01:04:44.034, Speaker B: Royalties for the creators, royalties for the creative. I'm a creator. I have an NFT. Every time that gets sold, there's a 5% royalty. I get that money. Openc is like, we want to enforce.
01:04:44.082 - 01:05:20.302, Speaker A: That for the creators, right at the smart contract level. Enforce it at the smart contract level. And so Openc trying to enforce that at the smart contract level is asynchronous with what Blur is trying to do, which is trying to have the best NFT trading experience for the lowest prices, which means they don't enforce royalties. Blur tried to get itself removed from Opensea's block list, but it failed three days ago from this Tweet thread, which was two days ago. So five days ago, six days ago, since the time of listening sorry, blur took a free ride on OpenSea Seaport protocol to bypass Opensea's block list. I'll explain what that means. So now all collections are now accessible for trading on Blur.
01:05:20.302 - 01:05:53.020, Speaker A: And so the idea is that NFT collections would have to pick one or the other. OpenSea or Blur, do you want to incentivize trading? And then you go to Blur. Do you want to incentivize and enforce royalties? You go to openc. Blur found this clever way to embed itself into Openc and open up the doors once again so collections can go back to Blur. So in November of 2022, Openc implemented a new policy. Collections seeking enforced royalties must block marketplaces that don't fully honor them. Since Blur didn't honor royalties, they are on the block list.
01:05:53.020 - 01:06:42.826, Speaker A: After Blur's launch in ten of 2022, October, it was on the rise and even surpassed Opensea's daily volume for some time, becoming a threat to Opensea's dominance. Opensea's new policy effectively created a defense line to defend its dominant position from emerging competitors like Blur. In the short term, Opensea's defense line has been proven effective as new collections like Liuca's sewer Pass chose to align with OpenSea and they blocked Blur. Blur responded by promising to enforce royalties for new collections, and then they made a request claiming that Blur met Opensea's criteria so that they'd be removed from the block list. OpenSea, however, replied that its policy required enforcing royalties for all collections, not just new collections. As a result, Blur could not defeat its offenses and still existed on Opensea's block list. So Blur finds a loophole by leveraging Opensea's Seaport to create a new exchange system.
01:06:42.826 - 01:07:09.634, Speaker A: As Seaport, which is a product out of OpenSea, it's a smart contract is not on Opensea's block list. It makes sense. Collections blocking Blur become tradable on it through the new system with enforced royalties. As a result, Blur now has two systems to execute two different kinds of trades on its marketplace. The old one continues to handle collections that do not block it, while the new one manages collections previously blocked. User experience is smooth as Blur chooses the system automatically. So basically, Blur has two systems.
01:07:09.634 - 01:07:21.830, Speaker A: One that is OpenSea compliant and the OpenSea uncompliant one uses the CPORT smart contracts, which makes it OpenSea compliant. So, like, Blur basically snuck into OpenSea and can still do no.
01:07:21.900 - 01:07:23.642, Speaker B: Why do we care? Why does any of this matter?
01:07:23.696 - 01:07:49.940, Speaker A: David, I think the answer to that is really just summed up by Legion's Tweet here. She says, It looks like we're converging on zero creator royalties. This likely leads to higher initial Mint prices and more frequent Mints. Creators reserve or withhold more of their collections to capture ongoing value. And they also incentivize carrots to incentivize optional royalties with more perks utilities. This is really about the conversation of, can we enforce royalties? And does the market want that?
01:07:50.870 - 01:08:48.734, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's really interesting, right? Because there's an element where I could see some creators wanting royalties. It's almost like copyright in the kind of the nation state world, if you're an author, maybe you want copyright laws to protect your work so you can make the most money out of it. There's an element I could see creators would want to enforce that royalty. But assets, liquidity markets want to be free, don't they? And so if they can bypass royalties, they absolutely will. And so that's why Legion is saying, well, when you have Blur fighting against OpenSea, the one that bypasses the royalty is ultimately going to win, because these royalties are not really enforced deeply at the protocol level, and so they can be bypassed, which is interesting. And that just means the market will respond differently. Creators will be like, okay, I'm not getting royalties, so what am I going to do? Maybe I mint a collection, but I reserve a bunch of that for my treasury because I know I'm not getting royalties in the future.
01:08:48.734 - 01:09:02.858, Speaker B: Maybe I do smaller, more frequent mints. That's sort of the creator response to this. But in general, I'm not concerned about this. I just think the market will figure it out. And these are good things to have be figured out in the market.
01:09:03.024 - 01:09:25.802, Speaker A: Cardano has a brand new stablecoin over collateralized stablecoin called Djed djed djed pegged to the US dollar, backed by Ada, with Shen as its reserve coin. Congrats, Cardano. You've made it to 2018. Ethereum. Sorry. Moving on. WorldCoin is opening up the hardware powering the orb.
01:09:25.802 - 01:09:39.126, Speaker A: So if you want to take a peek under the or under the hood of the orb, you can see how the orb works. This is something that has been kept secret, the secret sauce behind how WorldCoin works, which is why I've never stuck my eyeball in there.
01:09:39.148 - 01:09:43.350, Speaker B: Stick your eye socket in this and they give you coins. Are you going to do it? Yes.
01:09:43.420 - 01:09:44.518, Speaker A: Absolutely not.
01:09:44.604 - 01:09:44.998, Speaker B: No.
01:09:45.084 - 01:09:46.962, Speaker A: That is way too dystopian.
01:09:47.026 - 01:09:50.034, Speaker B: Yeah, you would never do this. Real world identity.
01:09:50.162 - 01:10:06.174, Speaker A: I don't even care if, like, I'll just put my bias on the table here. I don't even care if they come out on the table and be like, yo, we don't collect any data. We don't use your data. We can prove that to you. Don't make Sci-fi Dystopian toys. Don't do that.
01:10:06.292 - 01:10:24.030, Speaker B: This image alone, right? I don't know. That's going to be an uphill battle, I think, for them. People don't even like to go to the optometrist. You ever been an optometrist, David? On behalf of all the glasses wearers, you know that thing where they test your eye pressure and they shoot, like, a burst of air into your eye?
01:10:24.110 - 01:10:26.500, Speaker A: I don't know that I hate that thing.
01:10:27.350 - 01:10:35.462, Speaker B: Literally. They make you, like, you have to hold your eye open and you don't know when it's coming, and then just like, a burst of air right in your eye. That's what this sounds.
01:10:35.516 - 01:10:36.082, Speaker A: Awful.
01:10:36.226 - 01:10:40.566, Speaker B: Sorry, WorldCoin. Maybe it's way better than we're saying. Who knows?
01:10:40.758 - 01:10:48.954, Speaker A: I'm sorry. You made a Dystopian looking orb thing that I'm supposed to stick my eye into. That's your guys'problem? Wow.
01:10:48.992 - 01:10:58.318, Speaker B: Dave's not even willing to embrace the tech. It's hard to go mainstream that way. All right, Celsius just listed the names of people eligible to withdraw. What did we learn here?
01:10:58.404 - 01:11:06.686, Speaker A: Celsius has published the names of users who are allowed to withdraw 94% of their assets locked on the platform. Ryan, have you tried to get your money back out of Celsius?
01:11:06.718 - 01:11:09.266, Speaker B: No, they haven't contacted me. Where do I go?
01:11:09.448 - 01:11:10.850, Speaker A: I don't know, dude.
01:11:11.350 - 01:11:23.350, Speaker B: It's only users under a certain criteria. Transfers had to be less than some amount. $7,500. What else? And only specific. I don't know. Some subset were able to get some money out.
01:11:23.420 - 01:11:23.974, Speaker A: Let us know.
01:11:24.012 - 01:11:25.734, Speaker B: Congrats. Hey.
01:11:25.772 - 01:11:27.686, Speaker A: 94% recovery. If that is what it is.
01:11:27.708 - 01:11:48.560, Speaker B: That's great for ten, dudes. Got this david that's probably it. Who knows? I'm not very happy about like I'm sure Celsius users are not happy about what's going on with Celsius for sure. The money ain't there is the big problem. This is something I saw which was interesting, but I didn't get a chance to dive in. Maybe you know more. Elon Musk wants Twitter's payment system to be built with crypto in.
01:11:49.730 - 01:12:02.802, Speaker A: So he is alleged to wanting to make Twitter into an everything app. Sounds like the China apps like the WeChat. That includes having money in there. Not necessarily crypto, but not crypto. And that's the news.
01:12:02.856 - 01:12:06.610, Speaker B: What else do you use besides crypto? Use a stablecoin or something.
01:12:06.680 - 01:12:10.226, Speaker A: Everything else you can do, like venmo stuff you can do like nation state payment rails.
01:12:10.258 - 01:12:14.066, Speaker B: I know, but that's all connecting into the banking system and plaid.
01:12:14.178 - 01:12:17.122, Speaker A: He's not a crypto person. He's elon musk.
01:12:17.266 - 01:12:28.970, Speaker B: Come on, Elon. I don't understand why he doesn't get on board. David, what do we got here? Amazon NFT initiative coming soon. The exclusive from Blockworks. What is Amazon doing with the NFTs?
01:12:29.390 - 01:12:35.598, Speaker A: No one knows. They just said that they're doing an NFT initiative. It's coming in the spring. That's the news.
01:12:35.764 - 01:12:38.846, Speaker B: Really exciting. We'll see what that is. David, what do we got?
01:12:38.868 - 01:13:02.962, Speaker A: Coming up next incoming is questions from the nation. If we have privacy in crypto, will the bad guys be able to get away with it? And also open NFT mints. Are they an open thing? And then also Ryan is going to talk to us exactly what Max Payne is. It has to do with taxes. So stay tuned for all of that and more. But first, a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. The phantom wallet is coming to Ethereum.
01:13:02.962 - 01:13:41.854, Speaker A: The number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved UX to Ethereum and polygon. If you haven't used Phantom before, you've been missing out. Phantom was one of the first wallets to pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for ethereum and polygon. But that's just staking. Phantom is also the best home for your NFTs. Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your NFT experience, pin your favorites, hide the Uglies, remove the spam, and also manage your NFT sale listings from inside the wallet.

01:15:13.892 - 01:15:38.178, Speaker B: We're back with the questions from the nation. This is a question from Abraham Cr. They say I listened to the news on the wormhole hacker activity during last week's roll up. What will happen when we have fully deployed ZK rollups? Will we lose track of how the hacker is behaving? Do you have an hourglass to catch these people before ZK is fully implemented? So what happens, David, when we get privacy on chain? Do the hackers just get away with everything? Is that a bad outcome or a good outcome?
01:15:38.354 - 01:15:45.574, Speaker A: First, I want to make sure that we're not mixing up something. ZK rollups are not private by default.
01:15:45.622 - 01:15:46.182, Speaker B: Necessarily.
01:15:46.246 - 01:16:03.582, Speaker A: Yes, necessarily, they can be. Aztec is a ZK ZK roll up, and Aztec is private. But anything like the Polygon or ZK Sync or any other ZK roll up isn't necessarily it's not privacy technology. But you can do privacy technology on a ZK roll up. So I just want to make sure that is true.
01:16:03.636 - 01:16:10.818, Speaker B: Aztec is really the only one that we're aware of that is kind of farthest beyond that. Is privacy on a ZK roll up?
01:16:10.904 - 01:16:21.800, Speaker A: Yeah. You know how actually this tornado cache smart contract on the ethereum layer one is banned by OFAC, but can't you just deploy tornado cache on a layer two and then use that because it's a different contract address?
01:16:23.370 - 01:16:31.370, Speaker B: I don't know. I don't know what happens if you do that? It's going to have trouble. I don't know. Did you anyways, what's legal in this country? I don't know.
01:16:31.520 - 01:17:06.038, Speaker A: I think the spirit of this question is in the future, we're probably going to have a bunch of privacy tools. Correct? And the answer to that is 100%. Yeah. If that is the case, will we just lose track of the hackers? The answer to that is probably, but it's also going to be a cat and mouse game. It's going to be just like an arms race, like everything else. So privacy tools will get better, and then tracing tools will get better, and then privacy tools will get better and tracing tools will get better. I will say that cryptography always tilts power to the hands of the individual.
01:17:06.038 - 01:17:18.954, Speaker A: And so I would say individuals over institutions have the advantage here, but that does not mean that institutions can't brute force this and figure out where that stolen money went. They can figure it out.
01:17:18.992 - 01:18:02.434, Speaker B: Honestly, I'm fine with an internal cat and mouse game. I feel like that balance of power where a little bit individual side, a little bit the state and back and forth, back and forth. I mean, a lot of things about crypto and blockchain make things more easily traceable. A lot of things about the internet make things more easily traceable. But if you remove crypto and if you remove privacy on chain right, then, oh my god, it is complete surveillance. The individual has no protection against this. And then it's just like there is no mouse, there's just cats kind of controlling everything, right? And so I sort of like the back and forth of the surveillance tools get smarter, crypto gets a little better invent solutions.
01:18:02.434 - 01:18:27.022, Speaker B: I think that's important for a society like this. And let's also remind folks, listening to this is think about cash. We have had the existence of cash money which is not digitally traceable for hundreds of years. And before that, we had other nontraceable analog forms of money for thousands of years. The world didn't end. It was okay. Like we're all fine.
01:18:27.022 - 01:19:02.140, Speaker B: I mean, of course there was some illicit activity, but authorities found ways to go find where that illicit activity was in real life and bust the bad guys that'll be the same. What we're talking about in the absence of onchain privacy solutions is a complete surveillance of every single transaction that every person in the world ever does. That does not feel like a good balance of power. That feels very scary to me. So this is why bankless, we are advocates of on chain privacy, even acknowledging that there is some trade off there and some bad guys may get away with some things some of the time.
01:19:02.750 - 01:19:25.818, Speaker A: And we know that nation states are going to make it harder for individuals to access privacy. But as an industry, we will fight back about this. And eventually I have very strong confidence that individuals will be able to fully access total and complete privacy tools because that is our constitutional right. We just have to have this phase of time where we fight where we fight them.
01:19:25.844 - 01:19:44.034, Speaker B: Yeah, let's fight for the social norms. I mean, imagine if the nation state said all communication should be unencrypted, right. Let's ban signal. Sorry, we need a copy via our Prism database of all electronic communication. That all of our why? To make sure we don't have domestic terrorism. Right. Or international terrorism.
01:19:44.034 - 01:20:03.210, Speaker B: Right. I mean, I'm not an advocate for that. And what does it mean? It means that some bad people will communicate bad things and organize using these communication technology. But yeah, that's just the trade off that we have to live with if we're going to have a free society. My take on it. Anyway, here's a second question from Zero X redden. Hey, guys.
01:20:03.210 - 01:20:19.534, Speaker B: Curious to get your thoughts around the open edition meta that is happening in the NFT space? Feels like creators are moving away from the traditional NFT 720 Ones, and you feel like open editions make NFTs more accessible to the mainstream. What's your take on this? What's? An open edition. David.
01:20:19.662 - 01:20:46.570, Speaker A: Yeah, an open edition is an NFT mint that doesn't have a cap. And so anyone can come and mint it. Sometimes they close it in time. So, like, you have 24 hours to mint this, but there's no supply cap in the world of NFT. Twitter right now, people are talking about do they like open mints, and I've heard a lot of collectors say they don't really like open mints. It kind of takes the magic out of it. But I think creators do like open mints.
01:20:46.570 - 01:21:18.126, Speaker A: Why that is true, I think is interesting to unpack the question. Do you think open editions will make NFTs more accessible to mainstream? I don't really think that's the secret sauce. I think there are reasons to do open mints. I think there are reasons to do closed mints. I think we will ultimately settle on whatever the market will figure this out. And it's kind of up to the creator, right. Because they're the one who gets to do this choice, and they're probably going to pick the one the mechanism of NFT minting that puts the most amount of money into their pockets, if that's.
01:21:18.238 - 01:21:50.794, Speaker B: A new experiment to try. Right. So this is a NFT, I believe this is a producer and artist on the music side of things who tried an open mint experiment. And this is a thread I ran across David, I was thinking of when I read this question. He did an open mint for open edition drop of some music, I believe he said, with just under 2 hours left and 200 editions sold, here are a few of his takeaways. His takeaway was the pace of an open edition felt overall healthier. He had his OG collectors waiting at the doors, eager to collect.
01:21:50.794 - 01:22:16.802, Speaker B: But he was surprised with the trickle effect he got through the rest of the day. He sold close. To 75 additional NFTs after the first hour. He said it was way less stress for the collector because as a collector, you can take the time to buy the NFT. You don't have to go to the store being bummed that everything is on back order. And he said there was less pressure on the artist as well. He said the price and quantity dynamic goes out of the window, making the decision for the artist way easier.
01:22:16.802 - 01:22:38.110, Speaker B: So there were some benefits. And he summarizes this thread in his experience, saying open editions aren't necessarily the end all, be all model, but the overall steps forward for both the artist and collector feel like a net positive for most cases. So this particular artist, liked the experiment, will probably try it again. And that's what's going to happen, is a lot of experimentation around open editions and that's kind of bullish, kind of healthy.
01:22:38.450 - 01:23:04.290, Speaker A: I think that's a good perspective. You and I both missed the Chris Berniski Bankless Mint because it was our podcast mint. Our podcast mint the Bankless NFT podcast collectible. And we missed it. We were recording another podcast, which bummed me out because I really wanted to collect that one. If it had been an open mint, I wouldn't have felt rushed. All of the Bankless NFT collectibles have sold out inside of five blocks.
01:23:04.290 - 01:23:18.250, Speaker A: So if you are not there ready to mint, then you're probably not going to get it. And then it's also kind of a problem for collectors on the other side of the world. So sorry. People in Asia who want to collect the bankless podcast, we do it in Eastern times. Perhaps an open mint fixes.
01:23:18.670 - 01:23:26.430, Speaker B: Maybe. I mean, maybe it's something we try in the future. David, let's get some takes of the week. McDonald's saying we're all going to make it.
01:23:26.500 - 01:23:27.438, Speaker A: Oh, no.
01:23:27.604 - 01:23:28.750, Speaker B: Why are you mad about that?
01:23:28.820 - 01:23:55.842, Speaker A: This is finance. God, I hate it when corporate Twitter accounts talk to each other. I don't know why McDonald's tweeted this, but in January 26, they tweeted out, what did I miss? I don't really know the context behind that tweet. Finance. The Twitter account behind Finance responds, a lot of green candles. And then McDonald's responds to Binance saying, Wagami, we're all going to make it. It's like, oh, come on, guys, that's cringe.
01:23:55.986 - 01:23:57.302, Speaker B: That's cringe for you.
01:23:57.436 - 01:24:01.820, Speaker A: Yeah, especially when markets are pumping. They're going to cause the top.
01:24:02.430 - 01:24:03.642, Speaker B: Well, that's your take.
01:24:03.696 - 01:24:09.082, Speaker A: All right, guys. Ryan's talking about tax. All right, here we go. Tax time.
01:24:09.136 - 01:24:50.294, Speaker B: Do you know what people know? I had some funds stuck in Gemini Earn account. Lots of fun. They sent me this email and it says, we are writing to inform you that Gemini has requested a 30 day extension from the IRS to provide forms 1099 MSK MISC to Gemini Exchange account holders for the tax year 2022. I was like, oh, what is that? Oh, it turns out, of course, because of taxes, the interest you earn in Gemini Earn is all taxable at the time you receive that interest. Okay? So it's taxable, you receive income. So if you receive $100 in the month of May last year in your Gemini Earn account, then you owe the taxes on that $100 that you receive. Right.
01:24:50.294 - 01:25:02.378, Speaker B: This is how most accountants would kind of interpret these tax rules. Well, the pain of all of this, David, is you're a Gemini Earn customer. You lost all of your money, probably, in Gemini Earn. Maybe you get some of it back later. Who knows when?
01:25:02.464 - 01:25:03.174, Speaker A: Perhaps years.
01:25:03.232 - 01:25:24.934, Speaker B: For all intents and purposes, you lost it all. Guess what, David? You still have to pay IRS taxes on your interest. That, to me, is the definition of Max Pain. It's this wojak right here. Tears, crying, coming out. And like and this applies for celsius or BlockFi Gemini Earn, any of the C Five lenders you.
01:25:25.012 - 01:25:28.002, Speaker A: It's like you have to pay taxes.
01:25:28.066 - 01:25:37.314, Speaker B: On money that was stolen from you. And that, to me, is like peak pain. And I don't know, sometimes it's back to, like, if you don't laugh about it, you're going to cry.
01:25:37.362 - 01:25:37.670, Speaker A: Right?
01:25:37.740 - 01:25:41.622, Speaker B: Or maybe do a bit of both. But that is my definition of Max Pain, my friend.
01:25:41.676 - 01:25:47.482, Speaker A: See, this is why I have to get somebody else to do my taxes, because I would be like, oh, I'm not paying that. I didn't actually receive any of the money.
01:25:47.536 - 01:25:50.518, Speaker B: Oh, because you're going by rules of fairness.
01:25:50.614 - 01:25:51.930, Speaker A: Yeah. Common sense.
01:25:52.080 - 01:25:57.674, Speaker B: Oh, rules of fairness and common sense. Sorry, that's not what the IRS does. They have their own set of rules.
01:25:57.722 - 01:26:06.946, Speaker A: Because the IRS doesn't go by rules and common sense. I have to pay someone, an accountant, to care on my behalf or else I'll go to jail because I know I won't do it.
01:26:06.968 - 01:26:17.298, Speaker B: Right. Yeah. Anyway, I'm sorry for anyone listening who's in that position. I'm somewhat in that position, too, and it kind of sucks. That's Max Payne, my friend.
01:26:17.384 - 01:26:27.218, Speaker A: Okay, this is the favorite tweet I saw of the week. This was not added to the agenda by Ryan. This was added to the agenda by me. But this was Ryan's Tweet. So congrats, Ryan. Favorite tweet of the week. Ryan sean Adams.
01:26:27.218 - 01:26:34.506, Speaker A: Tweets out. Money and government will exist in greater purity the less they are mixed together. I got shivers when I read this one.
01:26:34.528 - 01:26:35.194, Speaker B: You want to like this.
01:26:35.232 - 01:26:36.874, Speaker A: Oh, I loved it so much. Yeah.
01:26:36.992 - 01:26:42.614, Speaker B: What if I told you this was a stolen tweet? No. Yes, this is a stolen tweet.
01:26:42.662 - 01:26:48.606, Speaker A: I was about to comment. It's like, man, this is not very AI of you, but it is pretty AI of you to say this is.
01:26:48.628 - 01:26:49.962, Speaker B: A James Madison quote.
01:26:50.026 - 01:26:50.414, Speaker A: Who's that?
01:26:50.452 - 01:27:02.478, Speaker B: Okay. Frame of the constitution. Founding father, James Madison, way back in the 17 hundreds. Like one of the originairs the Constitution. Madison did Jefferson Church in government. Camel existing.
01:27:02.494 - 01:27:03.762, Speaker A: Great. Is that where it came from. Wow.
01:27:03.816 - 01:27:12.774, Speaker B: He said his quote was, church and government will exist in greater purity the less they are mixed together. And I just subbed that out for money because I think the same is true.
01:27:12.972 - 01:27:19.474, Speaker A: You know how this is uncharacteristically human of you. But then you gave me that explanation. I said, no, that's the most AI thing I can think of.
01:27:19.532 - 01:28:19.590, Speaker B: It's such a good take, though. It is such a good the thing about the framers, the constitution is money was already separated from state at the time they wrote this. Their big thing was trying to get religion separated from state, which turned out to be a really good idea and a very strong protocol design for a democracy, for a republic governed by the people. Well, now we've got money injected into the state, and I bet if some of the framers were around today, people who really think about power dynamics and government, they would be advocates for this position, too. It's like we'll have money and government in greater purity if we don't mix them together as much, if we can separate them. And that is definitely the take of crypto. But money and politics, isn't that such a terrible combination? Money and state? Isn't that such a corrupting force? It's just like these things should be separated, shouldn't they? And yeah, that's why I'm bullish crypto, David.
01:28:19.670 - 01:29:10.246, Speaker A: Yeah. For any bankless listener that wants some light weekend reading, read the article a most peaceful revolution by Nick Carter. It all talks about when, and this also fits with the sovereign individual thesis, is like, crypto is going to unbundle money from the state, and it's going to force the state to be market competitive with the services that they provide when they can no longer issue money and print money out of thin air. They have to be market competitive with social, the, safety net, infrastructure, stuff like this. And so it takes away the privilege of them being able to just print money to pay for their mistakes and forces them into being at the whim of the market. The market makes them good, which I think when you don't have to adhere to the rules of the market, you become corrupt and stagnant and you rest on your laurels.
01:29:10.278 - 01:29:15.630, Speaker B: Do you know you're making me want to have rowan gray back on the podcast and argue with him a little bit about this?
01:29:15.700 - 01:29:16.554, Speaker A: Bring on a status?
01:29:16.602 - 01:29:39.086, Speaker B: Yeah, well, he would take the exact opposite position. He'd be like, no shit, brain. He'd probably say that actually. It's like having money tied in the state actually makes money accountable in a democracy to the people. And that is the way you should actually do things. Get your capitalist ideas out of here. Get your free market kind of ideas.
01:29:39.118 - 01:29:44.594, Speaker A: Out of know, I actually don't really think rowan gray and, like, disagree. We just have a roundabout way of coming to the same conclusion.
01:29:44.642 - 01:30:01.770, Speaker B: But we're I think the one thing we disagree on. He's way too optimistic on the incorruptible power of the nation state. And I'm like I think we are much anyway, that's a good debate. If you want to go back in the bankless archives, look up Rowan Gray and bankless. David, here's another take. What's this?
01:30:01.920 - 01:30:18.514, Speaker A: This is from lido. And just because this is so aligned with what we say, lido is doing the all caps. Lower caps. Caps, lower caps. Like making a farsa statement. And he's saying, I don't understand the tokenomics of layer two. Tokens? And he continues, mate, they have better business models than alt layer ones.
01:30:18.514 - 01:30:39.498, Speaker A: Like salana. The business model is easy. They sell block space on layer two, and they buy block space on layer one and pocket some nice spreads on the difference while still offering end users ten times cheaper transactions. I thought that was a great way of summarizing the layer two business model. They buy block space on the layer one, they sell block space on the layer two, and with compression technology, they can pocket the difference.
01:30:39.664 - 01:30:43.740, Speaker B: Yes, they are value added resellers in the supply chain of block space.
01:30:44.110 - 01:30:52.030, Speaker A: Player two is value added resales. Last take of the week. Who wrote this report? Fortune?
01:30:52.850 - 01:30:56.922, Speaker B: Let's see. This is from the Financial News of London.
01:30:57.066 - 01:31:01.870, Speaker A: Financial News of London. Meet the 20 most influential people in crypto. I'd love to.
01:31:01.940 - 01:31:02.782, Speaker B: Who are they?
01:31:02.916 - 01:31:12.354, Speaker A: Who are these people? I have no clue. These are awesome. Like stock image headshots of people. No clue who they are.
01:31:12.392 - 01:31:14.100, Speaker B: These are real people right here.
01:31:14.790 - 01:31:17.006, Speaker A: These are some LinkedIn ass photos.
01:31:17.038 - 01:31:23.286, Speaker B: Diana biggs ombre. I've never seen any of these people around people. But they are the 20 most but.
01:31:23.308 - 01:31:31.626, Speaker A: They are the movers and shakers in the digital asset sector. They haven't been on bankless. We should get them on.
01:31:31.728 - 01:31:33.114, Speaker B: I think we've been missing a whole lot.
01:31:33.152 - 01:31:37.500, Speaker A: How come they all have these same uniform headshots? These are all Fed plants, bro.
01:31:38.830 - 01:31:48.510, Speaker B: I don't know. I'm excited to I don't know what this full list includes, but this is a joke around crypto. Twitter about the 20 most influential people in crypto that no one's ever heard of.
01:31:48.580 - 01:31:51.210, Speaker A: These people were on crypto twitter. We would eat them alive.
01:31:51.370 - 01:31:52.030, Speaker B: Really?
01:31:52.180 - 01:31:56.126, Speaker A: Yeah. Anyone with that kind of, like, curated headshot, get the hell don't judge a.
01:31:56.148 - 01:32:01.634, Speaker B: Book by its cover. What do you have against curated headshots? You ever seen my Twitter profile picture? Let me show you this.
01:32:01.672 - 01:32:15.314, Speaker A: Yours is okay because it's kind of meta because yours is look at this. You getting a picture of the lighting. Yeah. You put your MFR as a profile picture for a while, and then you took it away, and I was disappointed.
01:32:15.362 - 01:32:20.330, Speaker B: You're mad about that. This is why bitboy called me a suit, is because of this photo.
01:32:21.310 - 01:32:23.802, Speaker A: You know what? He was right. He's right.
01:32:23.936 - 01:32:25.258, Speaker B: Bitboy had a point.
01:32:25.344 - 01:32:41.946, Speaker A: Those glasses, dude, what are you bullish on? David? Speaking of MFers. I'm bullish on MFRS. And so this was a bracelet that I'm now wearing. I'll put it up on the screen. It's kind of hidden behind my watch, but it's my MFR bracelet. I've always looking for a nice bracelet. So now I've got this MFR bracelet.
01:32:41.978 - 01:32:42.942, Speaker B: Where'd you get that?
01:32:43.076 - 01:33:08.834, Speaker A: So an MFR made it for me. This is me, an MFer buying MFer swag from MFR who made it for me. So you can go link. There's a link to this in the show notes. This is like an online store from Idanco. So if you're an MFR, you can buy an MFer bracelet. You can also upload your specific MFer and he'll make you a silver MFR figurine that is your MFer.
01:33:08.834 - 01:33:10.290, Speaker A: And you can get a nice little bracelet.
01:33:10.370 - 01:33:10.566, Speaker B: Right.
01:33:10.588 - 01:33:29.918, Speaker A: And so we had that take a while ago, that the Nike swoosh of web three will be a decentralized meme. And so this is an MFR who's made a business side hustle making MFer swag for MFers who want to wear MFR stuff. And this is how this meme propagates. And the cool thing is this isn't owned by MF or Inc.
01:33:30.004 - 01:33:33.082, Speaker B: This is just a little brand. It's a headless brand.
01:33:33.146 - 01:33:40.100, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think it's super cool. Also, can you go back to the picture of my watch? Yeah, can you zoom in on that?
01:33:40.550 - 01:33:42.818, Speaker B: I don't know, I don't have the power to can you read it?
01:33:42.824 - 01:33:43.380, Speaker A: No.
01:33:44.950 - 01:33:46.530, Speaker B: Is this Hoffman on your watch?
01:33:46.600 - 01:33:48.242, Speaker A: Yeah, dude, hoffman watch.
01:33:48.376 - 01:33:50.166, Speaker B: Wait, is this a brand name?
01:33:50.268 - 01:33:56.214, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw it on Instagram and it's like Hoffman watches. I'm like, wait, my name's Hoffman and it was a $100.
01:33:56.332 - 01:33:59.750, Speaker B: There can only be one David Hoffman in every industry.
01:34:00.110 - 01:34:04.442, Speaker A: Your boy wears a Hoffman watch? Yeah. Greatest Instagram purchase of all time.
01:34:04.576 - 01:34:17.870, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I'm really happy for your watch and see this, guys. So, you know, just so you know, whoever you are, the financial news, this is the wrist of a real crypto influencer right here. Sport and Hoffman watch.
01:34:17.940 - 01:34:19.578, Speaker A: Hoffman MFRS.
01:34:19.594 - 01:34:23.294, Speaker B: Yeah. That's how you know. That's how you know you're dealing with the influential crypto person.
01:34:23.412 - 01:34:34.466, Speaker A: Yeah. So that's what I'm bullish on MFers and I guess my last name. Also, I'm going to Starquare sessions tomorrow. So I'm also bullish on Starware sessions. So shout out to all the people who are going out there.
01:34:34.568 - 01:34:36.740, Speaker B: Cool. I'm glad you're taking that trip, man.
01:34:37.270 - 01:34:52.506, Speaker A: Me too. Going to learn as much as possible, literally. I have like eight interviews lined up and I'm going to bring them all back for the bankless nation. Going to turn them into content because that's what we do. So I guess I'm also bullish on content out there as well. So I got three things. Ryan, what are you bullish on?
01:34:52.688 - 01:35:12.160, Speaker B: I'm going to say it this week. Bitcoin blockspace. David unironically. I'm going to say that. Look, honestly, I mean, you're selling blockspace, more use cases. Some of these NFTs on bitcoin could actually be something. What else could you put in these blobs? I mean, you're not doing D five, but you can store some interesting things in it.
01:35:12.160 - 01:35:28.994, Speaker B: You mentioned going to the starquare conference. That is actually something that starkware wants to do, is it wants to bring layer twos Starkware tech to bitcoin. You still have this look of shock, but maybe you should be bullish on bitcoin block space.
01:35:29.112 - 01:35:32.406, Speaker A: I'm more bullish on bitcoin block space than I was previously, I will tell you.
01:35:32.428 - 01:35:40.358, Speaker B: That's it, man. I'll just leave it right there. And that takes us to the meme of the week. This week. What are we looking at, David?
01:35:40.534 - 01:36:05.130, Speaker A: So this is utility in an airplane just chasing down Peter Griffin from family guy. Utility in the airplane trying to gun down bitcoin, and bitcoin being Peter Griffin. Utility is coming from bitcoin, and bitcoin just wants running away from it. Running away from utility. Yeah. So that's the negative take here's. The positive take, which is you have the cringe crying guy and the cringe crying guy is ETH ethereum.
01:36:05.130 - 01:36:15.490, Speaker A: The cringe crying guy is like, we have a roadmap, and then you have, like, the vitalik roadmap piece. And then there's the bitcoin chad. And bitcoin says, looks like we've accidentally fixed the security budget.
01:36:17.110 - 01:36:28.294, Speaker B: That's a great take on it. I'm getting a kick out of this whole debate is bitcoin blocks based sales going up and people mad about it? I don't know. It seems like it's helping to me.
01:36:28.412 - 01:36:40.942, Speaker A: My favorite thing about it is that bitcoin is a permissionless protocol. Now, you can put NFTs on bitcoin. It's just going to play out the way that organic nature is going to allow it to play out. And we're just going to watch it every step of the way.
01:36:40.996 - 01:36:58.586, Speaker B: There you go. And I'm going to be busy playing doom on the ti 83 while everyone watches risks and disclaimers. Guys, we've got to tell you, none of this has been financial advice. We don't know the use cases of bitcoin block space in the future, but we hope to find out soon. Crypto is risky. You could lose what you put in. But we're headed west.
01:36:58.586 - 01:37:03.900, Speaker B: This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
