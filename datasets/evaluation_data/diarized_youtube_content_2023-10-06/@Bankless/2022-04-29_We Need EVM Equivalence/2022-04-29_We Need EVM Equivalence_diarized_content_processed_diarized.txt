00:00:00.170 - 00:00:51.082, Speaker A: My mind has been invaded by this concept called EVM equivalent. And the idea here is that optimism has been working towards making not an EVM compatible layer two, which is what people are used to, but an EVM equivalent layer two. The nuance behind that is that the values and the actual ethereum layer one starts to bleed into the layer two itself. The difference between the layer one and the layer two starts to blur. The point is that the optimism layer two, because it's EVM equivalent, whenever some public goods funding thing works, because of the equivalence, it is so easily transferable. It can go back to the layer one, it can go up to other layer twos. And so these public goods that optimism are generating via retroactive public goods funding, and the things that these new Silicon Valley of the web3 world build on optimism, they get immediately and freely transferable to the rest of the ecosystem.
00:00:51.082 - 00:00:58.620, Speaker A: That is something I think is just so beautiful. And again, how I think that we go from where we are now, where we're going to be dominated by climate change and war, to a Star Trek future.
