00:00:04.170 - 00:00:40.354, Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Dexs on Solana. Today we're talking to Meow from the Jupiter project, which is perhaps the super Dex, the super exchange on Solana. We'll talk about what that is. Earlier this week, the Jup token, the highly hotly anticipated token out of Jupiter, has actually launch. This token was announced back at Salana breakpoint in November of last year, and it's been hotly anticipated ever since. It just came in at a $6 billion fully diluted valuation, which is equivalent to uniswap on Ethereum. So a very big launch.
00:00:40.354 - 00:01:00.906, Speaker A: We got about $800 million of that actually circulating. So that is the actual market cap. And we're bringing on Meow, the founder. That is his pseudonym. Apparently it's very close to his actual real name, but people just call him Meow. He is a cat in a spacesuit on Twitter. We're bringing on Meow to talk about what is Jupiter, what is Jupiter under the hood? And then also the token launch.
00:01:00.906 - 00:01:46.030, Speaker A: So this will, I think be a hybrid episode for the Ethereum community, which bankless of course has, is the majority of the bankless audience who have never experienced Jupiter before, or maybe only touched it once or twice, have heard about it, but don't really know what it is. That would be, I would call the first part of the episode the first half, and then the second half of the episode is going to be more geared towards the Solana people who are interested in the details of the launch of Jupe. There was a bit of controversy about the launch of Jup that I heard. I am not super tapped into these conversations, so I'm coming at a very high level. Meow will give his account an explanation of the mechanism for the Jup launch. He will give his side of the story. I do not have the capacity to give what might be the other side of the story, so you'll have to search for that elsewhere.
00:01:46.030 - 00:02:20.866, Speaker A: Whatever Solana circles are discussing this. So there's a disclaimer there. I guess overall found it a pretty fascinating. There are definitely some differences about what Jupiter is on Solana versus what the typical Dex aggregator is on Ethereum. Meow walks through all of those things and then we also just get into the other conversations like the load on the Solana network. What's next for the Jupyter team with the liquidity that they have sourced as a result of the token launch? And also what's next for Jupyter teaser? They are hiring if you are looking for a job. And now let's go ahead and get right into the conversation with Meow from Jupiter.
00:02:20.866 - 00:02:54.158, Speaker A: But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. Especially Kraken, our preferred crypto exchange in 2024. If you do not have an account with Kraken, consider clicking the links in the show notes. How else are you going to get your boomer fiat bucks into the much more Sci-Fi world of crypto? Other than using Kraken? Click the link in the show notes to getting started with Kraken today. Kraken knows crypto. Kraken's been in the crypto game for over a decade, and as one of the largest and most trusted exchanges in the industry, Kraken is on the journey with all of us to see what crypto can be. Human history is a story of progress.
00:02:54.158 - 00:03:26.334, Speaker A: It's part of us, hardwired. We're designed to seek change everywhere, to improve, to strive. And if anything can be improved, why not finance? Crypto is a financial system designed with the modern world in mind, instant, permissionless, and 24/7 it's not perfect and nothing ever will be perfect.

Doing business as Kraken Cello is the mobile first EVM compatible carbon negative blockchain built for the real world. And now something big is happening. Introducing the cello L2. It's a game changing proposal that's going to bring cello's rapidly growing ecosystem home to Ethereum.
00:03:46.414 - 00:04:11.482, Speaker A: Vitalik has shared its excitement for the cello L2 on the cello forum. So has Ben Jones from optimism. But why? The cello L2 will bring huge advantages, like a decentralized sequencer offchain, data availability, and one block finality. What does all that mean? Rock solid security, a trustless bridge to Ethereum, and more. Real world use cases for Ethereum without compromise. And real world adoption is happening. Active addresses on sello have grown over 500% in the last six months.
00:04:11.482 - 00:04:30.414, Speaker A: With the cello L2, gas fees will stay low, and you can even pay for gas using ErC 20 tokens. But cello is a community governed protocol. This means that cello needs you to weigh in and make your voice heard. Join the conversation in the cello forum.

00:04:30.414 - 00:04:35.922, Speaker A: I'm here with the founder of Jupiter named Meow. Meow, welcome to the show.
00:04:36.056 - 00:04:37.430, Speaker B: Hey, how's it going?
00:04:37.580 - 00:04:51.994, Speaker A: Nice to meet you, meow. So you just had a gargantuan token launch. A $6 billion app just launched. A token coming in at $6 billion, fully diluted value. Yeah. New value into the world. Congrats on that.
00:04:52.032 - 00:04:52.282, Speaker C: How.
00:04:52.336 - 00:04:52.714, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:04:52.752 - 00:04:54.810, Speaker A: Does it feel to be post launch.
00:04:56.670 - 00:05:05.054, Speaker B: Man, thanks for asking. No. Anyone asked you that yet? No, seriously, thanks for asking. Because no one's really asking yet.
00:05:05.092 - 00:05:05.294, Speaker C: Right?
00:05:05.332 - 00:05:15.866, Speaker B: So thanks a lot for asking. We know that the team has worked really hard, right? And certainly the funny thing is we don't control the value. Right? We don't.
00:05:15.978 - 00:05:16.506, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:16.628 - 00:06:06.626, Speaker B: In fact, if you ask me and stuff, it's like, okay, the market gave us this value. Right? Then on our end, I think we are incredibly lucky and fortunate to be a recipient of this value. I think it is, on one hand, okay, we are grateful that things didn't mess up. We are extremely grateful that we were able to give a present, right. To a lot of people. Lots of people are like, obviously, I wish they kept that juke, right? But lots of people are like, hey, I could pay for my meal. Hey, I could finally buy my iPhone, right? And I feel like, obviously we hear a lot about people, they're playing a gaming system and getting lots of capital, but there's all these many small stories, right? And that's pretty happy for me.
00:06:06.626 - 00:06:41.226, Speaker B: So I think it feels very grateful on my hand, I think it's like accumulation of a lot of work done. So we are very happy to do a manifested also giving present people. And last but not least, I think it marks the beginning. I think this whole process has been this amazing community process, right. Because value is not generated by team, right. If you're making a pencil, for example. Maybe, right? But if you're making a coin, a currency, a token, right.
00:06:41.226 - 00:06:43.798, Speaker B: Then the value is generated by community ecosystem.
00:06:43.894 - 00:06:44.442, Speaker C: Right?
00:06:44.576 - 00:06:49.760, Speaker B: So last not least, obviously incredibly grateful to community ecosystem for doing.
00:06:51.010 - 00:06:51.422, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:51.476 - 00:07:18.422, Speaker A: And I think Solana as an ecosystem is learning how to do airdrops. We had the Jito drop. This is like the second big drop after Jito. There's been others as well. But really, these are kind of the two big ones. And so one of the things I've been curious about is just learning about how Solana app teams learn to navigate a very difficult process of beginning actually to decentralize their whole app. I want to get into that subject later.
00:07:18.422 - 00:07:59.618, Speaker A: But as you probably know, and as listeners definitely know, we have a more of an Ethereum focus on bankless. We are familiar with Ethereum. We know how these systems work on Ethereum. So I want to unpack what Jupiter is under the hood for our more Ethereum centric audience. So the next bit of questions is like, if I were to pop open the hood of Jupiter, what would I see? How is it different? And then I'll ask, how does Jupyter uniquely leverage Solana? But for people that don't know what Jupyter is or don't know what it is and they haven't used it before, what is Jupiter? It's an exchange on Solana. But take it from there. If I were to look under the hood of Jupiter, what would I find?
00:07:59.784 - 00:08:20.910, Speaker B: Okay, so if you don't look under the hood, just look at the car, right? We are a full service exchange. We have swap limit orders with BCA. We have herbs, and we serve a gateway to Solana, onboarding to Solana. And we also have a launchpad, which is just launched. So that's what I see on the outside.
00:08:20.980 - 00:08:21.406, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:21.508 - 00:08:44.978, Speaker B: And what you see on the inside is that you see this extremely meticulously designed, elaborately engineered over three or four years. Over two or three years system, right. Meant to find the best routes across the whole sauna network in a way that is as fast as possible.
00:08:45.064 - 00:08:45.746, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:45.928 - 00:08:49.150, Speaker B: Because as you guys know, Sona's rock time is 400 seconds.
00:08:49.230 - 00:08:49.714, Speaker C: Right?
00:08:49.832 - 00:09:09.046, Speaker B: And also, Sana, transaction speed is very fast. And also transaction fees are very much lower. Right. In many ways compared to other networks, whereby we have to aggregate across all the markets and then also find routes not just for larger trades, also very small trades.
00:09:09.078 - 00:09:09.322, Speaker C: Right?
00:09:09.376 - 00:09:18.814, Speaker B: So our goal is that simple. Right. Whether you're doing a two cent trade or whether you're doing $100 trade or million dollar trade, right. We want to kind of effectively kind of route through the system in a much more effective way.
00:09:18.852 - 00:09:19.440, Speaker C: Right?
00:09:19.970 - 00:10:08.400, Speaker B: And one big difference to Ethereum is this. So Ethereum's constraint is gas fee. Right? Or we know that. So Swan has a different set of constraints, right? It's like the account size limit is smaller and different. So it's like, basically, how do we kind of constantly navigate that? So how do we kind of build a system that's extremely optimized for speed and cost at a balance handle its limitations so that's kind of what we see. And that's the sort aggregation. So that sort aggregation powers a number of systems, right? It powers the soap, obviously, it powers the limit orders, it powers the DCA, but it also powers certain key things about the pubs as well, right? I think a number of things.
00:10:10.690 - 00:10:11.006, Speaker C: On.
00:10:11.028 - 00:10:45.142, Speaker A: The surface, you have these different ways of swapping. You have the swaps, a limit order, dollar cost averaging and perps. These are all just ways to make a trade happen. And then under the hood, you said that it's a Dex aggregator. We have Dex aggregators on Ethereum, right? They do exactly what you say. They find liquidity across Ethereum and then they package it into the best execution for their users. Is Jupiter a source of liquidity as well? Is it like an amm, like uniswap as well? Or is it more just of an aggregator of liquidity? And it finds liquidity elsewhere on Solana.
00:10:45.142 - 00:10:47.082, Speaker A: Where is the liquidity coming from?
00:10:47.216 - 00:11:05.330, Speaker B: So three different ways, right? The first way for the swap, limit on DCA, there's no liquidity for the purps. We have liquidity, actually, we actually have one of the most largest by volume platforms in DeFi. Our perps be about 1.4 billion in volume last week.
00:11:05.400 - 00:11:09.042, Speaker A: Okay, so Jupiter hosts its own liquidity for its perps product.
00:11:09.096 - 00:11:38.470, Speaker B: Yes, precisely. Precisely. Right. For launchpad, we source liquidity from teams to host on our platform. Right. And also, obviously, we also host airdrop as well, for people as well. I would say this, by the way, I think one thing that I'm very proud of at Jupiter is that we really push the limitation of Solana to a limit.
00:11:38.550 - 00:11:39.082, Speaker C: Right.
00:11:39.216 - 00:12:14.646, Speaker B: For example, there are a few things, like, for example, Solana in the past had this problem where transactions can be so big when they send the transaction in and they implemented local tables. So we're the first to implement local tables. We're the first to implement priority fees and first to implement. And basically anything that Solana does, we're the first to incorporate into our system. I think we are a really good example of composability on Solana because you can basically go through like six or ten markets on Solana for transaction fee of 0.2 cents. So I think that's actually one really cool thing, I think that we really focus on.
00:12:14.748 - 00:12:30.810, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely want to lean into that. But really, just to round out the liquidity question, the swaps and the limit orders, where does Jupiter source its liquidity if it's not everywhere on Solana? So there's other amms or other order limit orders on other apps. And then Jupiter finds.
00:12:34.590 - 00:13:30.174, Speaker B: Interesting. It might be interesting for your audience, right. Because on swana you also have, for example, you know, sick and sticking, right? So for example, if you go from liquid six or marinate, so ever, right? So Jupiter also integrates something called sanctum, which essentially allows for immediate staking and unstaking. So on Jupyter, you can immediately go from a very large soul order to a very large, to the very large liquido in the same transaction. So you got through the amms and also that one thing. And so the way back, right. So I think there are actually a number of really interesting and obviously clobs is actually very professional sauna, right? But you don't really see them anywhere else.
00:13:30.174 - 00:14:13.422, Speaker B: Actually integrating all these different systems, right. The amms and clobs and things like sanctum into one system, it's actually quite challenging. Also, another kind of amms that you have on sauna is like a single sided liquidity pools, right? So basically, I think because the cost of that section is so low, you do see a bigger variety of possible liquidity systems that you don't see elsewhere, right? Yeah. So I think that's actually something quite interesting about Jupiter dust is that we actually spend an incredible amount of time and effort, right. Trying to. Okay, I'll put you in. We are where the amm sick of the trading rules, right? Because they debute and view and build, but they're not sure what breaks, right.
00:14:13.422 - 00:14:46.390, Speaker B: So the moment they plug in our system, the first 2nd there is like hiring the order starting in, right, in the first minute, right. Sometimes they break. So we work with the team to really try to fix them everything. And because a lot of these systems are very novel, right? So we work at them a lot. So under the hood. So if you look beyond under the hood to the people working under the hood, I think you will see a team that is very committed. It's not me, by the way, it's the engineers, right.
00:14:46.390 - 00:15:09.390, Speaker B: They are very committed to making sure that the whole system works as well as possible, that really understand every single detail about the amm and how to integrate everything, right? And we had the same level of dedication to all products, order swaps and NDCA and pubs and everything. I think that's what I see under the hood.
00:15:10.210 - 00:15:28.360, Speaker A: Okay, so you were about to get into it and then I wanted to go back and just tie off that liquidity question. But I want to ask about how does Jupiter leverage Solana? Solana has unique properties that no other blockchain has, it's extremely fast. It's got some parallelization to it. What are the strengths of Solana that Jupiter really leans into?
00:15:29.290 - 00:15:52.010, Speaker B: I mean, the most obvious one is cost. Right. It's cheap to execute a complicated trade on Solana. I will say this. Besides the technical. Right, there's also ecosystem. Solana actually has a very well developed ecosystem.
00:15:52.010 - 00:15:59.834, Speaker B: And so it's actually two things. So you have a lot of different amms and with people who are investing, like, real technical effort into designing new systems.
00:15:59.882 - 00:16:00.190, Speaker C: Right.
00:16:00.260 - 00:16:18.370, Speaker B: For example, Phoenix is an extremely different system from Openboat and Openboat V two is a very different system from Phoenix. And a bunch of other open books come coming as well. So you really have a lot of people who are investing a lot of time and effort into their own system, but obviously you don't have volume right at the start of new system.
00:16:18.440 - 00:16:18.674, Speaker C: Right.
00:16:18.712 - 00:16:34.874, Speaker B: So what we do is that we plug you in and immediately you get all the retail flow and everything. We do that. So I think to us, it's not just about leveraging the speed of know, but also the ecosystem as well, which is very. Yeah.
00:16:35.072 - 00:16:35.482, Speaker C: Okay.
00:16:35.536 - 00:16:51.840, Speaker A: So one of the big stories about Jupiter was that there was no VC funding. It was bootstrapped just from you and from the team. Can you talk about the genesis of how. How did the idea get started? How did the project get started and when did it get started? Tell us about the Genesis story.
00:16:55.170 - 00:16:56.014, Speaker B: Let me go way back.
00:16:56.052 - 00:16:56.640, Speaker C: Right.
00:16:57.750 - 00:17:00.818, Speaker B: So actually, I did a lot of stuff in Ethereum. Right, as well.
00:17:00.904 - 00:17:01.346, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:01.448 - 00:17:02.370, Speaker A: Pretty typical.
00:17:02.790 - 00:17:11.686, Speaker B: Everyone generally has their starter, and I also started WBTC when I was working them with Bitgo and everything.
00:17:11.788 - 00:17:12.102, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:12.156 - 00:17:36.480, Speaker B: So I was actually really active in Ethereum. I just didn't talk that much. We started a project called Mercury, and then Mercury was a project I started as well. And then that project took funding. That project took funding. And over time, initially, the project didn't do that well. Didn't do that well.
00:17:36.480 - 00:17:56.614, Speaker B: Eventually what happened was that from there, we started Jupiter as a completely new project, while Matura became so now with a project called Metora. Right. So it's also doing extremely well as well. It's also doing extremely well right now.
00:17:56.652 - 00:17:56.950, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:57.020 - 00:18:05.826, Speaker B: So basically, I think the genesis of Jupiter started as mercurial, which did take funding. Which did take funding.
00:18:05.858 - 00:18:06.006, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:06.028 - 00:18:07.522, Speaker B: And then he had a token as well.
00:18:07.596 - 00:18:07.882, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:07.936 - 00:18:24.186, Speaker B: And then it transitioned. And then in about February 2023, we took a snapshot, and now 5% of total Jup supply goes to mercury stakeholders.
00:18:24.298 - 00:18:24.622, Speaker C: Okay.
00:18:24.676 - 00:18:31.834, Speaker B: Right. While 100% of the circulating supply of Metara goes to the mercy holders.
00:18:31.882 - 00:18:32.094, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:32.132 - 00:18:33.780, Speaker B: A snapshot taken in.
00:18:36.470 - 00:18:44.354, Speaker A: Okay, so there were some other applications, some other startups that you started before Jupiter. Eventually you pivoted into Jupyter and then.
00:18:44.552 - 00:19:15.006, Speaker B: Would you call it a pivot? No, it's a new project. But the original project became Mitora. We documented all these things in excruciating detail in many different places. I think eventually we were able to. It was a long process, right. But I think eventually we were able to come up with. We were able to kind of like, I believe, and it's my personal belief, right.
00:19:15.006 - 00:19:28.850, Speaker B: And certainly I think a lot of people appreciated it to create, I think, two projects, Jupiter Metro, that had a lot of value, I think funneled that value to the original.
00:19:29.910 - 00:19:36.440, Speaker A: Okay, okay. All right, so where did the idea, the inspiration for Jupiter come from and how did the team form?
00:19:39.530 - 00:19:49.178, Speaker B: The inspiration of Jupiter was quite simple, right. Is that like. Okay, so obviously aggregation is not a new idea, right?
00:19:49.344 - 00:19:51.020, Speaker C: It's not a new idea. All right.
00:19:52.110 - 00:19:56.394, Speaker B: But it turns out to be excruciating hard to do.
00:19:56.512 - 00:19:57.180, Speaker C: Okay.
00:20:01.810 - 00:20:09.098, Speaker B: The first few order book systems on, for example, one major source of liquidity for Solana early on was serum.
00:20:09.194 - 00:20:09.840, Speaker C: Right?
00:20:10.290 - 00:20:54.982, Speaker B: And serum works completely different from regular amm, right? Basically, the very first step that you had to do to even integrate this major source of liquidity was to understand serum. So basically, I think what will happen was that we were playing around with a number of different ideas. No idea. Okay, so one thing is, Bessemberg actually, as part of my Ethereum background, right. I've always known something, right. Essentially, whichever, if you have the best price, the best token selection and the best ux, you win.
00:20:55.056 - 00:20:55.246, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:55.268 - 00:20:58.286, Speaker B: You tend to win over time. Might not immediately, but over time you win.
00:20:58.388 - 00:20:58.702, Speaker C: Right?
00:20:58.756 - 00:21:19.314, Speaker B: So I know that because I was part of that system. Right. By the way, David, just to let you know, I'm very happy to talk to you because I've been, obviously been on more Solana podcasts, right. So talking to you is really fun because it's kind of bringing back to Ethereum. Thanks a lot for that.
00:21:19.352 - 00:21:19.746, Speaker C: Right.
00:21:19.848 - 00:21:30.278, Speaker B: But back with the point. So I feel like I knew very well what will be, right. And one of the things that I always notice is like, okay, why don't people use aggregators on Ethereum more?
00:21:30.364 - 00:21:31.000, Speaker C: Yes.
00:21:33.310 - 00:22:18.966, Speaker B: And then while on the l tools, there's just not that many, not that many different amms. So you just go directly there. Right? So anyway, with that understanding, I was like, okay, you know what I was thinking? Hey, you know what aggregator on Swana will probably be effective but you must have bid it well, right? So anyway, back then there was actually three or four different aggregators on already they were trying to make it but then we were looking around at them and they were like they can't do it because they couldn't figure out the most basic thing about how do you make Amm work with a clob, right. That is very different because they work completely different. Completely differently.
00:22:18.998 - 00:22:19.580, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:25.230 - 00:22:27.194, Speaker B: It started out more as a curiosity thing.
00:22:27.232 - 00:22:27.900, Speaker C: All right.
00:22:28.590 - 00:22:53.298, Speaker B: Hey, you know what? Hey, how do we can actually be done? How do we do it in a way that. Okay, so another thing is important is that we are very ux focused team so we have a lot of hardcore engineers and stuff but we are all very ux focused. Right. And I think that combination is very important. Being able to do the hard hanker work but also being able to really care about the user experience. Right. Because that was very difficult.
00:22:53.298 - 00:23:13.494, Speaker B: So I think eventually, I think after two months, I think it was two months and it was really two months of raw work just to do one integration, right. But then at some point I understood, wow, I get it now. I get why no one else is doing this because it took us two months just to do that simple integration.
00:23:13.542 - 00:23:14.140, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:15.230 - 00:23:24.800, Speaker B: I think after we did that I think that gave us a lot of confidence to spin up Jupyter as a new project and we went from there.
00:23:26.450 - 00:23:32.078, Speaker A: How many people are on the team? Like how many engineers or front end devs give us a snapshot of the.
00:23:32.084 - 00:23:33.630, Speaker B: Team now or back then?
00:23:33.700 - 00:23:39.474, Speaker A: Now, yeah. Or maybe if there were other important phases to talk about too. What was it like in the past and what is it now?
00:23:39.512 - 00:23:45.060, Speaker B: Oh yeah, probably six, seven in the past. Six or seven in the past. When we started on this whole.
00:23:47.050 - 00:23:47.366, Speaker C: We.
00:23:47.388 - 00:24:41.510, Speaker B: Kept pretty small for a long time and then now we are like 16 1718 around there and growing quite rapidly because we do actually plan to do a lot of things. But yeah, it was a period of very intense experimentation and again I feel like it's one of those things that I feel like there are a lot of teams that hop between Ethereum and Solana and other things I feel like don't do that. I feel like it's very difficult because to win in any ecosystem requires a lot of very deep faith in the community. I mean, you know this, right? A big part of whether your product gets interaction is if the broader community accepts you or not, right. I think that was actually one problem, right. But one thing that's just interesting here is that I think back at the peak of the Solana hype. I think a lot of other more prominent aggregator.
00:24:41.510 - 00:24:50.614, Speaker B: Everyone signed, they want to enter and then Indian. Only one did Kyber, but I think the others didn't. And it's because of what I talked about.
00:24:50.652 - 00:24:50.950, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:51.020 - 00:24:59.462, Speaker B: There's a really big tanker hurdle to even get a functional product working and even after they get it working to kind of iron out all the different details.
00:24:59.526 - 00:25:00.586, Speaker C: Right. And again, wrong.
00:25:00.608 - 00:25:08.846, Speaker B: You know, it's funny, I feel like the process that we went through was probably very similar to the process that the early if guys went through.
00:25:08.948 - 00:25:09.166, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:09.188 - 00:25:19.554, Speaker B: I mean, can you imagine life before, er, 20? I mean, come on, seriously. Right. You'll be crazy. Or even before a lot of this new thing came up. Right. Yeah. So I feel like we kind of went through that phase together.
00:25:19.554 - 00:25:30.422, Speaker B: Right. I think that's the reason why over time we built up a very strong understanding. That's about it. That's how it works.
00:25:30.556 - 00:25:55.760, Speaker A: Sure. Let's get into the launch of Jupiter. You actually announced the Jupyter airdrop incoming at Salana breakpoint last November. And that's when the snapshot was, at least for phase one. We'll talk about what phase two and beyond looks like. 955,000 addresses were eligible with almost a million. And just for comparison, the largest airdrop of all time was the arbitrum airdrop at 600,000.
00:25:55.760 - 00:26:12.770, Speaker A: Optimism had 250,000. I know that it's pretty cheap to spin up a new Salana wallet and then start transacting on it just because the fees on Salana are so low, but what do you make of this very high address? Like, why are there so many active addresses that were eligible for the Jupiter Airdrop?
00:26:13.430 - 00:26:29.542, Speaker B: Yeah. So just to recall it a bit, right. I think in breakpoint we announced a number of things. We announced the token, we announced a token sale. We announced a launch pad, and we also announced a bunch of other. We also announced pubs as well. Right, okay.
00:26:29.542 - 00:26:56.080, Speaker B: We also announced a new stablecoin GT. So it was a very cool down for us because over the last two years you've been building. Right, just building. So it was just really cool to just be out there for the first time in two years. I think it was also really great because everyone used Jupiter before. Right. So it's a product that they had already had a very close touch with and they knew very well.
00:26:56.080 - 00:27:05.406, Speaker B: I feel like it was a combination of knowing the product and wanting a new token in the ecosystem. And that's actually why I think it was actually extremely biased that.
00:27:05.448 - 00:27:06.040, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:10.650 - 00:28:02.198, Speaker B: I think a big part of that, I think it relates to your question you're asking, right. I feel like most expert users have one or two wallets, at least two or more wallets, right? And certainly we do know of bot farms, found some bot farms that actually ran about like, I think ten K or the Max we had. And now actually we know pretty well. We actually know pretty well right now because we start claiming, right? And everyone started coming out, right? So actually we have a pretty clear now. So the good thing is this. So let me give it to you in the most no bullshit way possible, okay? I hope you trust me on that, right? In a sense that I do believe that roughly half was really legit, because the number of excitement that we had about our token. And we see it now, right.
00:28:02.198 - 00:28:21.710, Speaker B: To sustain a 600 million dollar airdrop, it's actually not easy. You actually need a real community to actually give us a fee also to get it right. There's real excitement, right? This call has been crazy, everything, right? So I think I would say that. I would say about like half rulers. That's my best guess, if you ask me.
00:28:21.780 - 00:28:24.320, Speaker A: Half of addresses are real. Half our.
00:28:26.130 - 00:28:28.234, Speaker B: Duplicates, duplicates. Not farm duplicates, duplicates.
00:28:28.282 - 00:28:28.880, Speaker A: Okay.
00:28:29.570 - 00:29:41.030, Speaker B: User having two or more wallets, right? And I'll say this, we only found, we actually did extensive cluster analysis on it, right? Because we wanted to make sure that. So we actually didn't find David, remember this, right? We didn't announce an airdrop at all. One of the things that we were very careful about was that I hate promises. I hate promising things, right? Because certainly I think in my past experience, whenever I promise something, things fail, right? Because there's expectation and then domestic things fail, right? So I think one of the things that I was very careful about over two, over years was that no token talk, no adopt talk. So I'm actually very convinced that no one actually did that. And then when we did the clustering analysis, we did find some clusters, but then it wasn't that much, right? But then something interesting happened. What sipped our attention, right? I'll tell you this, okay? What sipped our attention was that there was a big bum, about 10,000 addresses that came in the last minute.
00:29:41.030 - 00:30:48.682, Speaker B: Because what happens that approaching breakpoint, right? November 2, right? The hype became real, very high, right? The token wasn't announced yet. Nobody's a lot of hype, right? So I think what I think happened was that someone started farming, then he spun out like, spun up like 10,000 wallets and stuff and traded everything crazy, right? And that happened like a few days before bitcoin, right? And that was only when the token top became real, right? So that's the only big one that we found. And Elder is very annoying for me, right? Imagine someone running a script taking out 2 million, right? Then dumping in the market. I love the fuck. If you're interested, I mean, since you're interested in details, right? I will tell why I missed that. We missed that because we divide the adult into two categories, okay? The first category is like hit base, right? That means if you trade $1,000 above and stuff, you get a lot more. It will mean a lot more things like that.
00:30:48.682 - 00:31:57.998, Speaker B: It's not really 1000, but it's based on the top number of people traded, right? And some modifiers, right? And then we did. And then because we wanted to be as inclusive as possible, right, we allocated 200 joke to everyone, right? That means that whether you trade a dollar or $0.50 or whatever, you get 200 group, right? And because I had this mentality of being as inclusive as possible, which, by the way, I still think that's right strategy. By the way, I still think it was the right strategy for me to give 200 dupe to everyone. However, I think, unfortunately we ran the cluster analysis only for the ones that got large amount of juke and we didn't run the cluster analysis for those 200. So we missed out on that, on that big fat cluster, mainly because I was like, okay, you know what? Everyone should get something, right? But what I didn't expect was that there was this big fat fucking cluster. Fucking annoying for me, right? Because we tried really hard, right? Because, you know, cluster analysis, analysis is never accurate, right? You can never get it precisely right.
00:31:57.998 - 00:32:14.422, Speaker B: So I was, okay, whatever, I'm just going to give the benefit of doubt to everybody and stuff and just give 200 to everybody. But as a result of that, we did miss out on this giant cluster that probably came last minute. That's a big miss for me. I think there'll be future address.
00:32:14.476 - 00:32:49.650, Speaker A: I'll do it better for the historical addresses that used Jupyter. When did Jupiter go live? When were some of the first trades that were eligible for receiving? And then overall, over the span of Jupiter's history, for the people that got the airdrop, what were they trading? Were they trading Solana for other tokens on Jupiter? Was it usdc being traded on Jupiter? Kind of like, what's the qualitative nature of the activity on Jupiter? For the span of time that Jupiter has been like, what are people trading on Jupiter?
00:32:50.550 - 00:33:01.654, Speaker B: They actually trade a lot of different things. For a long time. It was, I think we went live on November, about October 21, right?
00:33:01.692 - 00:33:02.646, Speaker A: October 2021.
00:33:02.668 - 00:33:05.750, Speaker B: Okay. And then close to the peak of.
00:33:05.820 - 00:33:08.074, Speaker A: Salana mania in 2021.
00:33:08.112 - 00:33:08.746, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:08.928 - 00:33:34.734, Speaker B: Some say down, but yeah, I feel like that's actually why I think the community appreciates us so much. It's because I think we started at the peak, and even when the markets looked really bad and everyone ran away, we were committed to it. Right. And we were the most front facing example of that. Right. So I think that's the reason it goes two ways.
00:33:34.772 - 00:33:34.974, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:35.012 - 00:34:11.086, Speaker B: I think they were appreciative of us, and we are appreciative too. So there's this harmony, which is why I think we have a high level trust, right. Because we were there. But back to your point. Yeah, I think it was October 2021 and then October 21, I think. And back then, if I'm not wrong, most of we, which are trading sole USDC, right? And back then there was like this first generation tokens. For example, you had the first generation mincoins, right? And you had tokens like Oka and radium mango, things like that.
00:34:11.086 - 00:34:30.366, Speaker B: So that was actually the ones that were kind of traded, right? And that was true for a while. Pretty big as well. And some level of wombhole tokens too. That was the first phase.
00:34:30.398 - 00:34:30.546, Speaker C: Right?
00:34:30.568 - 00:34:52.854, Speaker B: First phase of first phase. And then you have second phase. Obviously everything crashed and died after the FTX thing. So activity actually pretty much went to the burning was horrible. Really fucking bad, right? But Bonk came up, right?
00:34:52.892 - 00:34:53.186, Speaker C: Bonk.
00:34:53.218 - 00:34:55.914, Speaker B: Bonk came out. So Bonk came out and it was big, right?
00:34:56.112 - 00:35:04.415, Speaker A: Bonk came out, like not too long after the FTX implosion, right? It was something like December of 2022 or January a.
00:35:04.415 - 00:35:04.727, Speaker C: A bit bit later.
00:35:04.727 - 00:35:05.280, Speaker B: Later.
00:35:05.890 - 00:35:09.680, Speaker A: A bit later. Early 2023 Q 120 23.
00:35:12.130 - 00:36:17.454, Speaker B: But that was big, right, because that was like the first fucking coin, right? That showed that tokens at life on Swana, right. What was also very important was that and big credit bong here, right, is that I think the Bong team, like norm and primitive and KZ and Casey, this whole gang, we love them, right? Because I think they really, I think, embody a lot of the community etos, right, and learn from them, right? But essentially, I think that came out, I think that was important, that showed that Sona had life, right? Because I remember, it's funny because I think people are saying I was talking to some friends, right? And they were like, yeah, but it's just a meme coin, right? I'm like, yeah, dude, but it shows that Solana has capital to deploy, right? It definitely showed that Solana had capital to deploy and even outside of Solana people was paying attention to know, right. Those two things are not nothing.
00:36:17.592 - 00:36:19.734, Speaker A: There's a canary in a coal mine for sure.
00:36:19.852 - 00:36:47.870, Speaker B: Precisely. What if you have capital to deprive, right. And then you have a community willing to AP, right. And then you have attention when you look into it and stuff, right. It's something, right? And obviously bong went through tremendous ups and downs, peaking recently and stuff. Right to autumn high. Amazing for them, right? I love them for a long time that was like Bong and other smaller meme coins for what they got added to the mix, right.
00:36:47.870 - 00:37:15.046, Speaker B: And then recently obviously the meme coin thing went crazy, right. And recently went crazy, right. Went crazy. I would say now since a few months back I think it was like the whole, it's pretty exciting because our volumes, not just us but everyone's volume went up quite crazy, right. Because you had these audience and meme coins, the dog with hat, the gently use Honda. Gently use Honda. Obviously.
00:37:15.046 - 00:37:40.400, Speaker B: Peace Jito and our jup came out as well. I think what we're going to see is that we are kind of entering the fourth phase right now whereby Jupe and whereby you have these I will call really good projects. They're all not launched tokens yet come to launch tokens, right. I feel really excited about that because I think that all those tokens are going to bring a lot of excitement and vitality to the trading space.
00:37:41.490 - 00:38:39.102, Speaker A: Mantle, formerly known as Bitdao, is the first Dow led web3 ecosystem, all built on top of Mantle's first core product, the Mantle Network, a brand new high performance Ethereum L2, built using the op stack, but uses Eigen layer's data availability solution instead of the expensive Ethereum layer one. Not only does this reduce mantle network's gas fees by 80%, but it also reduces gas fee volatility, providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications. The Mantle treasury is one of the biggest Dow owned treasuries, which is seeding an ecosystem of projects from all around the web3 space for Mantle. Mantle already has subcommunities from around web3 onboarded like game seven for web3 gaming and bybit for TVL and liquidity and onramps. So if you want to build on the Mantle network, Mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone based funding to promising projects that help expand, secure and decentralize mantle. If you want to get started working with the first dowled L2 ecosystem. Check out Mantle at Mantle XYZ and follow them on Twitter at zero xmantle.

00:39:26.622 - 00:39:55.740, Speaker A: slash bankless or click the link in the description below. So part of the Jupiter token launch was the Jupyter launch pad, which is one of the things that you announced at Solana Breakpoint. Now, launch pads as a product, these are tried and true products in the crypto space. They even exist in the tradfi space. We just use banks for them. And so this is just like a new primitive that Jupiter is bringing into the Solana ecosystem. Can you talk about what the launch pad does and then talk about how the Jup token leveraged it?
00:39:56.750 - 00:39:57.786, Speaker C: Okay, great.
00:39:57.888 - 00:41:35.818, Speaker B: Thanks for asking. So I think at breakpoint I announced the intention to build a launch pad, right, because I really, really wanted a launch pad, mainly because I think I wasn't too happy with exiting launch pads in the sense that you must be very familiar with the token get the model right, whereby you had to hold FTT in order to buy the tokens. And then they do what we call a supply squeeze. That means that they limit the amount of supply available at the start and ramp up the demand. And so the FPT holders benefit because obviously happens that later on the people that, who believe in token the most buy the token, right, but they get them dumb into right things like that. So you see these really big spikes, right? All that is caused by what I call the supply chains, where you don't have enough supply in the market right? Now, another launching model that's famous as well is what we consider to be the, I call them the isolated pool model, whereby it's not in the open market yet, but you pool capital together right? And this can be as simple as the ones that mango did, which is like you had x number of market, x number of USDC, and then the end pool is what you get. Or it can be like the LDP model, the balance of the LDP model, where we start high, it starts low, and then you have other models like you allow multiparties, including airdroppers, to put the tokens in there.
00:41:35.818 - 00:42:44.466, Speaker B: Many ways to do it, right? But I think what I didn't like about that model was that it was impossible to predict what happens. Because think about it, right? With that model, right? With those isolated pool models, your most enthusiastic believers bind to that pool. And then based on how fast the pool goes and stuff, and then a price forms, right? But then the thing is that your most enthusiastic believers and stuff doesn't equate the market, right? You don't actually know how the market will react, right? And the Airdrop meta and the airdrop thing. But I actually believe that the adro is way to go in terms of just a fantastic way of rewarding users and benefiting community, right? And I can get to that. That's a very important thing too, essentially, I think. And then you add on to this airdrop thing, then you just can't predict how you go. So the isolator pool model, right? You have this really big problem of like, okay, so quote unquote, you have price discovery in a very isolated pool, right? But then when you go to the market, it just goes down or go up, you don't know.
00:42:44.466 - 00:42:45.362, Speaker B: And most I go down.
00:42:45.416 - 00:42:46.020, Speaker C: Why?
00:42:46.390 - 00:43:19.306, Speaker B: Because your most active supporters already bought in the pool, right? Those are two things that I think. And then thirdly is that you have the adro meta, right? The adopt thing is where you just airdrop and they sell in the market. That works. However, demand is extremely erectic and liquidity tend to be very thin, right? So a big selling that dumb token, right?
00:43:19.328 - 00:43:19.882, Speaker C: Way, right?
00:43:19.936 - 00:44:11.210, Speaker B: And then as a new token, you don't really want that, especially if you're on chain. I think our launch pad is, okay, our launch pad basically says that, okay, given that the open market is the best way to discover tokens, given that a team often needs capital, but I want to do it in the most transparent way possible. And thirdly is that given that we don't know what the demand dynamic looks like, maybe a lot of people dumping, but no one start buying things like that. How do we develop a launch pad that is relevant for this new meta of open market recovery? Sufficient liquidity and also team capital so that was the basis that went on building this launch pad.
00:44:11.790 - 00:44:21.258, Speaker A: Okay, so for the price discovery of the Jup token, what were some of the economics on launch? What did that look like using the launch pad and for the token?
00:44:21.434 - 00:44:30.670, Speaker B: So essentially, I think there were three components. There were three components to it, right? So the first component is obviously, so we call the LFG launchpad.
00:44:31.410 - 00:44:31.870, Speaker A: Nice.
00:44:31.940 - 00:45:44.810, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. Essentially everybody starts at the same slot, right? So basically the airdroppers can claim and sell, right? People can buy into the pool. So what we did was that the way the Jupyter RFG platform works is that projects can set up a price curve, a liquidity curve, a sell only pool, right. It actually works exactly like providing liquidity anywhere on ECLM or DLM. You set up one side liquidity, right? But there are two differences here, right? The first difference is that we have a tool that allows the user to specify treatings, right. The projects, the project specifies the initial price, the max price and the curve, right? So a looks like this, right? That means that, okay, your initial price, your initial price can be low, but it goes high really fast, right? A low curve, it goes like this, right? So I think for per Jupyter, I think we set up a pool that looks like this, right? The initial price was like 0.4, which was like roughly half or about asylum and a half of the perps price.
00:45:44.810 - 00:45:46.620, Speaker B: And then the max price was 0.7.
00:45:47.630 - 00:45:53.310, Speaker A: So the Jupyter perps product allowed for some amount of price discovery ahead of the launch.
00:45:59.170 - 00:46:02.670, Speaker B: Our pubs only does token that exist.
00:46:03.410 - 00:46:11.860, Speaker A: Right, okay, so there's other perps like Avo on Ethereum, I think maybe. Okay, so you had some information about what the market was pricing ahead of time.
00:46:12.630 - 00:47:52.798, Speaker B: We're two information points, right? By the way, guys, I'm so happy by the way, because I feel like so interesting, it's so interesting to kind of think about this thing, right? Because I'm getting a bit excited. So let me just share with detail, there are two points of point discovery, right? The first was Avio and the second was the wills market, right? So those two things allow us to, and honestly they went to big fluctuations, right, in the previous over last two weeks in Singapore of the thing, right? We are very new to this, right? So one thing I kept emphasizing my tweets was that we are using joke as an experiment for Launchpad. The reason for simple is that a lot of people are onset got a lot of shit for that, right? Because, oh, why don't you launch in December when the hype was so high, right? Whether just launch a token, right? And the reason we did launch a token was this, if I didn't build a launch pad, if I didn't launch using my own launch pad, then how can I ask any project to use a launch pad, right? It's not possible, right? So what people don't realize is that we actually spent the whole of January bringing Launchpad. I kept telling people, and David, I'm telling you, I learned so many lessons. So many lessons. And a lot of the backlash that you see about Launchpad is a result. Lessons, right? Like lessons in communications.
00:47:52.798 - 00:47:56.774, Speaker B: I learned a lot. I apologize if I didn't communicate properly. I really do.
00:47:56.812 - 00:47:57.254, Speaker C: Okay.
00:47:57.372 - 00:48:48.178, Speaker B: And secondly, I apologize if people didn't understand mechanics enough, which is why I'm topping my audit to try to explain it right back to the point. But I need the point that jube we experimented, right? And I can talk more about the price curve later on because that's very important, okay, but we have this tool to our interview, right? This tool to allow you to turn a simple price curve with three parameters, initial, max and curve, right? And they'll show you how much you translate into a graph to show you how much you raise, how much usage, and who is inside in your moment, right? So you create and then you pass the team these parameters, and the team will load the tokens according to these parameters, right? That's how it works, right? But I think it sounds a bit abstract, so let me break down for the detail what happened in the load to launch.
00:48:48.274 - 00:48:48.870, Speaker C: Okay.
00:48:49.020 - 00:49:40.920, Speaker B: By the way, David, I'll just share something with you. I actually described a lot of these mechanics in theory, over many long poles, right? But I think it's very helpful to understand kind of like this thing. And don't get me wrong, it's not just them, it's me too. If I read something, I don't understand it, right? But if I see something happen, I get it, right? Let me break down what happened during the launch. Okay, so at a certain slot. So Sona is a slot, right? Things started going, right? And then, so people were over the claim, and then the market started moving, and we severely trotted the first few slots to prevent too much bought in. But otherwise anyone can buy and sell right into the thing.
00:49:40.920 - 00:50:03.946, Speaker B: There was a lot of bots going to the pool and taking the liquidity, right? Because the first part of liquidity was always cheaper, much cheaper, right? So in many ways, what we did was that we as a team offered tokens for sale starting at 0.4 to 0.7.
00:50:04.128 - 00:50:04.858, Speaker C: Right.
00:50:05.024 - 00:50:08.586, Speaker B: But remember, it's an open market pool, by the way, right. It's not a closed like a pool.
00:50:08.618 - 00:50:08.814, Speaker C: Right.
00:50:08.852 - 00:50:32.546, Speaker B: So everyone was interrupting at the same time claimers were dumping, right. And then they could dump into right away. They could dump tokens in right away. That's actually very important because that actually gave a real time view of what's actually happening. Right. Let's fucking go. Right, so initially the price only increased.
00:50:32.578 - 00:50:33.160, Speaker C: Right.
00:50:33.530 - 00:50:41.878, Speaker B: What does it mean? It means that the price just kept increasing initially, which means that initially there are a lot of people who are willing to buy at $0.40.
00:50:41.974 - 00:50:42.282, Speaker C: Right.
00:50:42.336 - 00:51:22.034, Speaker B: And not enough people dumping it and not enough people selling at it came crazy. And at some point, the centralized exchanges, similar as well. And then we started seeing quite a bit of selling. I think when it hit like 50 something cents, 60 something cents, I think it went to about 70 century cents somewhere else. And then it started backtracking. Backtracking, right. Basically the demand, basically, people started selling more than they're buying.
00:51:22.082 - 00:51:22.678, Speaker C: Right.
00:51:22.844 - 00:51:40.678, Speaker B: At the 70 cent mark, we actually didn't finish the pool. There was 2 million Jup left in the pool. Right. And started retreating back to like sixty five cents. The last two days, it has been about two days now. It has been like, going this range.
00:51:40.854 - 00:52:05.694, Speaker A: It's actually been relatively stable of a price. And to me, it's actually been kind of incredible because uniswap is currently valued at something like four or five or $6 billion, and uniswap is on the bigger network. Granted, uniswap is only one application, it's an amm, and Jupiter has many more apps on it. But being valued above uniswap is pretty monumental. So in my mind, you tell me, above.
00:52:05.742 - 00:52:07.966, Speaker B: I don't think we are above uniswap.
00:52:08.078 - 00:52:09.334, Speaker C: Aren't you? No.
00:52:09.372 - 00:52:12.278, Speaker B: We have 800 million market cap now or something.
00:52:12.364 - 00:52:16.226, Speaker A: Oh, I'm talking about fully diluted valuation. I always talk about fully diluted valuation.
00:52:16.418 - 00:52:17.670, Speaker B: Just a meme, right?
00:52:17.820 - 00:52:22.410, Speaker A: Yeah, it is a meme, but. Yeah, but it's the price that people are able to get, right?
00:52:22.560 - 00:52:23.260, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:23.710 - 00:52:27.690, Speaker A: $825,000,000 market cap, fully diluted, 6 billion.
00:52:28.110 - 00:52:32.662, Speaker B: Yeah, around that. Around that. Do you mind if I finish something real quick?
00:52:32.736 - 00:52:33.246, Speaker A: Sorry, go ahead.
00:52:33.268 - 00:52:49.474, Speaker B: Yeah, that's important for me to explain this, right. The pool actually worked as intended, right. Because what the pool does is that it created a backstop so people can sell into.
00:52:49.512 - 00:52:49.666, Speaker C: Right.
00:52:49.688 - 00:53:03.480, Speaker B: And that's actually very important for two reasons, right. Number one is that airdroppers that wanted to sell the tokens always. And they created sell into that to me was important. I mean, I don't know why, but to me that's important. Otherwise it's not a real present. Right. If you don't.
00:53:03.480 - 00:53:23.054, Speaker B: And secondly is that I believe, right. I don't know yet. Right. But my belief is that it gives buyers a lot of confidence, right. Because if liquidity is very bad team and you have very big airdrop, remember, we are giving away. One thing to remember is this, right? We are giving away like at current 600 million, right.
00:53:23.092 - 00:53:29.594, Speaker A: So the airdrop was 10% of the total supply, right. Total supply is 10 billion. You gave away 1 billion.
00:53:29.722 - 00:53:30.634, Speaker B: Yeah, 1 billion.
00:53:30.682 - 00:53:30.846, Speaker C: Right.
00:53:30.868 - 00:53:35.726, Speaker B: So for example, 1 billion tokens. 1 billion tokens are available claiming.
00:53:35.838 - 00:53:36.500, Speaker C: Right.
00:53:38.150 - 00:54:02.614, Speaker B: And there were some, as I mentioned, the farm as well. The farm that claimed 2 million tokens. So he literally dumped a million into the. So in any other model you will see the price go to crazy fluctuations. Crazy. Because there's no new pool that can take a million. But what happens that this pool, because it had a lot of capital built up, it was able to adopt the damage.
00:54:02.662 - 00:54:02.874, Speaker C: Right.
00:54:02.912 - 00:54:10.294, Speaker B: So basically it also gets buyers confidence too. And that. Okay, cool. I can buy into this pool without getting wrecked.
00:54:10.422 - 00:54:11.100, Speaker C: Right.
00:54:11.630 - 00:54:16.640, Speaker B: Certainly that's what people told me. Right. And I don't have any scientific proof for it, but it makes sense to me.
00:54:19.090 - 00:54:31.922, Speaker A: You're much more familiar with just markets and just what goes on under the hood. But somebody, I look at charts, I can tell a stable chart from an unstable chart. And looking at the Jupiter chart, that is a stable chart. That is not crazy.
00:54:32.056 - 00:54:51.770, Speaker B: It's crazy. It literally followed the exactly the liquidity curve and just came up. And not just that. Yesterday. Yesterday when there was a lot of criticism, right. And a lot of. I consider them unresearched comments.
00:54:51.770 - 00:55:21.746, Speaker B: It went down a lot, but it didn't go all the way down. Right. Because there was enough people who could be in there. Right. I think at the end of day I feel like it's a good system because the people that bought the tokens early, they believe that was the price they willing to pay. Right. Certainly in our case and stuff, it didn't go too far in.
00:55:21.746 - 00:55:33.202, Speaker B: Right. It was like it stayed in a relatively high range. And secondly is that this pool is team liquidity, but it's not just for Jupiter.
00:55:33.266 - 00:55:33.638, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:33.724 - 00:55:46.570, Speaker B: We are also, as I mentioned, we are experimenting, right. So for all launchpad projects, right. We are locking it for seven days. So any project that uses launchpad, the condition is that they must lock the liquidity for seven days.
00:55:46.640 - 00:55:47.500, Speaker C: Okay. Right.
00:55:49.710 - 00:55:54.320, Speaker B: That means that if the founder goes crazy and starts, like, dancing naked in Times Square.
00:55:56.290 - 00:55:57.710, Speaker A: Do you have these plans?
00:56:02.050 - 00:56:26.120, Speaker B: But whatever the case is, whether that's some big news, whatever stuff. Right. There's also that seven days for the price to stabilize before liquidity can be taken out. So I think it also acts as a backstop pool for stabilizing things like that. Obviously, I think it's up to a team and we have our plan to do so. Certainly when you take out a lot of liquidity. But it depends, for example, the price could be way above it already.
00:56:26.120 - 00:56:35.722, Speaker B: Taking liquidity doesn't matter. Right. Or it could be still within a range for Jupiter. It looks like it might be within a range when they get out.
00:56:35.776 - 00:56:35.994, Speaker C: Right.
00:56:36.032 - 00:56:44.926, Speaker B: So we have to be very careful, right. About communications. We communicate very carefully. Okay. About how we're going to. And that's my bad. So that's actually my bad.
00:56:44.926 - 00:56:45.680, Speaker B: Okay.
00:56:46.050 - 00:56:47.934, Speaker A: Maybe can we just unpack this a little bit more?
00:56:47.972 - 00:56:48.174, Speaker B: Okay.
00:56:48.212 - 00:57:05.060, Speaker A: So there's the initial bootstrapping liquidity, which is the mechanism that we've been talking about that's producing the price discovery for Jupiter. This is part of the launchpad product. This is also where Jupiter, the team gets some of its funding in the future. But it's locked for seven days. Is this all?
00:57:07.270 - 00:57:31.838, Speaker B: Let me. Do you mind if I clarify something? It's really important for me because it's also quite hard to understand. It's not hard to understand, but it's quite obvious. But let me show you. So the curve, the price curve that we have is not price recovery because there's a lot of people dumping elsewhere, everything. So price coverage everywhere. Okay? But what it does is that it ensures a lot of, it ensures sufficient liquidity at every price point.
00:57:31.924 - 00:57:32.270, Speaker C: Right?
00:57:32.340 - 00:58:18.810, Speaker B: Now, remember what I talked earlier about the supply squeeze, where the launch pad suppresses supply in order to create the spike which benefits a small cell. People, I hate that. I really don't like that. Right? I really don't like that. Because I think what that leads is to, it leads to a system whereby the people that I call this anti, again, I'm trying to figure something. It might not work, right? But I want to do an anti promoting whereby along every single step of the way, there is sufficient liquidity. Jupiter, it was priced low initially.
00:58:18.810 - 00:58:39.250, Speaker B: Another mistake that made was actually priced lower. Okay, so I made a bunch of mistakes, but it's okay because future projects can learn. But I think for me, I did a few mistakes. I should price it at like zero point 25 and 0.5. And the reason I was scale of being bought it, but I think I was too scared of being bought it. Right. But long story short is that along every single.
00:58:39.250 - 00:58:54.280, Speaker B: So it's not really price discovery, but more like this curve is there to make sure that there's sufficient supply at every step of the price discovery so it doesn't go crazy, you know what.
00:58:56.410 - 00:58:58.886, Speaker A: Like secondary discovery.
00:58:59.078 - 00:59:03.066, Speaker B: Yeah. Secondary stable discovery. Sure.
00:59:03.168 - 00:59:03.482, Speaker C: Okay.
00:59:03.536 - 00:59:24.322, Speaker A: And so this is the liquidity coming in from the Jupiter team, would you call it? Because the Jupiter team is supplying the Jup tokens, and then over that seven day period, the Jup tokens get sold for USDC or Solana or what's the other USDC? And this liquidity is locked for seven days.
00:59:24.456 - 00:59:25.140, Speaker C: Yes.
00:59:28.790 - 01:00:14.654, Speaker B: Another mistake that I made in communications, right, is that I wasn't careful about how I was using the words, right. And I also didn't appreciate how LP, single sided LP. So I kept, in my long blog post, I said that single sided LP and blah, blah, I didn't answer all the things I didn't communicate well. Right. And I think that led to a lot of misunderstandings. But long story short is that the team provided, and by the way, one thing I would really encourage everyone to check out because we really spent immense amount of time on, right, is our token accountability. Okay.
01:00:14.654 - 01:00:47.606, Speaker B: We really spent our time making sure that every single dupe is accounted for. So I encourage everyone to check those things out, okay? And we also label all the wallets and everything very close, very clearly. So anyone that wants to track anything that goes in and out, they can just track it very easily. Okay. In our case, I think we had about 3.5% of tokens that was taken out. We have four community observed wallets.
01:00:47.638 - 01:00:48.220, Speaker C: Okay.
01:00:48.670 - 01:00:53.386, Speaker B: The team code, committee code. Timothy sick community. So those are the community observed wallets.
01:00:53.418 - 01:00:53.662, Speaker C: Right.
01:00:53.716 - 01:01:07.294, Speaker B: And we consider those to be not part of the circulating. Okay. As part of that, we took out 10%. We took out 10% for the adro. So that's considered circulating.
01:01:07.342 - 01:01:07.698, Speaker C: Right.
01:01:07.784 - 01:01:30.300, Speaker B: We also took out three by 5% and of which 2.5% went to the pool. Right. And then we have 0.5% for Mm loans and other sex needs. And then we have 0.5 for.
01:01:30.300 - 01:01:52.030, Speaker B: In case the pool ran out and we need to provide liquidity to other systems urgently. Right. So that is the extent of other tokens that we have. Long story short, was that. Long story short, there is 1.35 billion right now in circulating. 10%.
01:01:52.030 - 01:02:18.898, Speaker B: Ready. I think 69% is claim ready? I think it's claim ready, but we consider all the intercalating. Okay. And then 2.5% is in the pool right now. And so about, I would say 80% of the tokens are already having the pool right now. I think about 80% or 85% is UTC.
01:02:18.994 - 01:02:19.590, Speaker C: Right.
01:02:19.740 - 01:02:36.766, Speaker B: And the rest are joke tokens. Right. So assuming the price remains the same at the end of seven days, the team, which is us in this case, has the right to take the tokens away. Actually, honestly, it was three days. Right. But then I think we are making seven days.
01:02:36.868 - 01:02:39.840, Speaker A: Okay, how much total value is that?
01:02:40.530 - 01:02:48.306, Speaker B: Total value? I mean, in USDC, that's about 100 in there right now. But that's the price days, right?
01:02:48.488 - 01:02:49.940, Speaker A: Current prices. Correct.
01:02:50.390 - 01:03:10.920, Speaker B: Because the way it works best. Simple. Another mantra is December. We believe that the team should. Again, I'm trying to develop a model, not just for Jupiter, right. But a model I think me as a retail participant and as an ecosystem player, want to see, right, which is okay. The team should get whatever the price set us at.
01:03:10.920 - 01:03:26.862, Speaker B: Not the peak price or whatever. Not. Right. Because actually, okay, I mean, we all know what happens in these kind of situations, right? The supply squeeze and the ding palms. And then the team sells atom. Very common things like that. We're the opposite of that, right? Basically.
01:03:26.862 - 01:03:50.822, Speaker B: We're the opposite of that, right? Basically, the team only gets. It's very simple, right? Now, if the price setters at 0.7, setters at 0.7 and stuff, then I think then the team will get, I think, 125,000,000. But if the price setters at like right now is 98.5, is at 50, and then so and so forth, things like that, essentially. I think that's fair.
01:03:50.876 - 01:03:51.206, Speaker C: To me.
01:03:51.228 - 01:04:28.100, Speaker B: That's fair. Remember, we actually took a pretty big risk in pricing at 0.4 to seven, right? Actually, we should price it over, right? That will actually have reduced. But again, I think I regret overcompensating for boss because there were so many bots on social media, they're bragging that they're going to retire and shit. No, seriously. So I was like, okay, fuck it, right? So I think I wanted to avoid the nightmare of having the early thing all being gobbled up, but on hindsight, I feel like I could have done like 25 to .5 and they'll be fine.
01:04:28.100 - 01:04:38.200, Speaker B: I'll give advice to projects right in the future. I think we did, actually. That's how I think about it.
01:04:38.890 - 01:04:47.122, Speaker A: So at the end of the seven days, what are your plans when you have the window open to take liquidity.
01:04:47.266 - 01:04:48.520, Speaker C: Are you just going to take.
01:04:50.090 - 01:04:52.682, Speaker A: What are the plans here? Are you going to take all of it or like a little bit?
01:04:52.736 - 01:04:53.514, Speaker C: What's the deal?
01:04:53.632 - 01:05:07.630, Speaker B: I don't know yet. I don't know yet. No plans yet. I think what I'll do is that I'll communicate very clearly what I'm going to do. I feel like the important thing here is for me not to sending right now. I don't know where it's going to be at.
01:05:07.700 - 01:05:07.982, Speaker C: Right.
01:05:08.036 - 01:05:23.906, Speaker B: If it's at 0.7 and 0.4, it's very temperance. Right. I think that's very nice. I feel like that's the nice thing about this model, right. Is that you are literally letting the market do things decide for you right before you actually pushed up.
01:05:23.906 - 01:05:31.774, Speaker B: Right. I think it's great. Any long story short is that. Long story short is that. I don't know. Because I don't know. I can set the ad.
01:05:31.774 - 01:05:34.726, Speaker B: It could be 0.4.5 or. .7 I don't know.
01:05:34.748 - 01:05:34.982, Speaker C: Right.
01:05:35.036 - 01:05:53.766, Speaker B: But one thing is for sure. I think one thing for sure is that I'm not going to sell a single juice. Any juice that's not sold will go right back into the stay there. But obviously, if I, .4 I don't sell anything. That might do some OTC.
01:05:53.798 - 01:05:53.994, Speaker C: Right.
01:05:54.032 - 01:06:03.726, Speaker B: Obviously. But I'll be open about it. I'll be like, hey, I didn't get any stables here. I only need to put on your CC here. I think the community will understand.
01:06:03.908 - 01:06:04.446, Speaker C: Right?
01:06:04.548 - 01:06:18.820, Speaker B: Yeah, it's fine. But obviously at 0.7 that I might do something else. I think it depends. But what I'll do is once I have a clear signal of what is going to be, then I think I will overcommunicate. I learned my lesson. Things like that.
01:06:20.970 - 01:06:41.878, Speaker A: Let's talk about the load on the Solana network. So Solana didn't miss a block. It didn't go down, which is under stress, which is great. There were some failed transactions. There were. People were talking about not being able to get some of their transactions through. How would you give a report card a grade to the performance of the Solana network during the launch of the mean?
01:06:41.904 - 01:07:01.070, Speaker B: I would say it's great. I think it's great. I would say that Sana has improved a lot through this. Right? I think there was 1.17 was brought recently. Actually. We actually tamed the joke launch to happen after 1.17
01:07:01.070 - 01:07:26.650, Speaker B: because there was actually a lot of improvements, including some algo box and also some CPU limit improvements. Semi competition improvements. I think 1.18 is coming out soon, which will really make the local fee markets a lot more effective. So I think in many ways, I think it's very nice for us to stress as network. So I think ideally, every single launch pad we stress as network. What's actually interesting was that a lot of other things broke.
01:07:27.310 - 01:07:28.060, Speaker C: Right.
01:07:30.270 - 01:07:43.658, Speaker B: Some waters didn't work as well, and some of our systems, because we were overstressing the sound. But it's not so understandable. We were overstressing our own RPCs. Right. Orders.
01:07:43.674 - 01:07:43.806, Speaker C: Right.
01:07:43.828 - 01:07:45.146, Speaker B: And we're trying to fill those orders.
01:07:45.178 - 01:07:45.434, Speaker C: Right.
01:07:45.492 - 01:07:54.834, Speaker B: So we were stressing. But it's actually our bad because, for example, instead of pre caching a lot of the orders, because we knew what those orders were ready.
01:07:54.872 - 01:07:55.122, Speaker C: Right.
01:07:55.176 - 01:07:58.386, Speaker B: So we could have cached them beforehand and then execute them.
01:07:58.408 - 01:07:58.642, Speaker C: Right.
01:07:58.696 - 01:08:16.300, Speaker B: Instead we were like fetching them real time, which created a reload, unless it's reload on our network as well. So we just fucked up a lot of things anyway. I would say the network itself went pretty well. I will say that a lot of other infrastructure didn't work that well.
01:08:17.950 - 01:08:27.470, Speaker A: The core of Solana, which is the actual Solana network, did just fine. Maybe the next concentric circle out, which is the RPC layer around Solana, still needs some improvement.
01:08:28.130 - 01:08:35.966, Speaker B: More like how people use RPCs, but how people use are fine. They didn't scale out appropriately or the load balance didn't work properly, things like that.
01:08:35.988 - 01:08:36.270, Speaker C: Right.
01:08:36.340 - 01:09:09.034, Speaker B: And the core network thing, I would say that there's still some errors in terms of it's still hard to estimate gas, like what was the right gas to use. But generally speaking, I think the core network went up pretty well. Everything saw a big spike, obviously. But remember this, right? What was actually interesting was this, because we priced at 0.4, which is a level that people that like Jupiter would buy, but not something that spammer bots would necessarily buy. Right. So we didn't actually get as aggressive if we went like.
01:09:09.034 - 01:09:25.266, Speaker B: Because original promise go to one 10th of my utopian. Original. My utopian idea was to start 110. Let's go. Right. 110 will actually be a lot of like. Then we get spam like crazy, right? In many ways.
01:09:25.266 - 01:09:27.860, Speaker B: Right. So I think that's the reason. Yeah.
01:09:28.390 - 01:09:28.754, Speaker C: Okay.
01:09:28.792 - 01:09:38.446, Speaker A: So at the end of this seven day period, in theory, the Jupiter team will have capital, be able to enter the next phase of Jupiter.
01:09:38.638 - 01:09:40.366, Speaker B: Hopefully. Hopefully, yeah.
01:09:40.408 - 01:09:55.340, Speaker A: Right. In the ideal scenario, this is like the plan. There are some edge conditions we can talk about, but just like the whole idea is like, Jupiter now has capital to enter the next phase of its development. What are the next phases for Jupiter? What does the roadmap look like moving forward?
01:09:59.230 - 01:10:15.920, Speaker B: I think, first of all, I think it's about improving infra, right. Our core products, right. A lot of things are incredibly boring. By the way we scale our customer support team. I'm not kidding. Very serious here.
01:10:17.570 - 01:10:20.074, Speaker A: People love teams with customer support teams in crypto.
01:10:20.122 - 01:10:34.418, Speaker B: I spend one month on this shit, man. It's not easy cutting everything, making sure everything is in, getting right people in and stuff. Some fucking stupid shit, man. I'm not kidding. I'm not fucking kidding, man. I spent so much time on stupid shit. It's not stupid.
01:10:34.418 - 01:10:51.946, Speaker B: It's just what people might consider not exciting, right. But to me, we are very proud of this. We reply to everything compared to things like that. So we spent time on like. And we also need people who actually can answer questions, can read blockchains, right? And I think. I think having a high EQ, I'm going pretty boring.
01:10:51.978 - 01:10:52.414, Speaker C: Okay.
01:10:52.532 - 01:10:53.614, Speaker B: So bear with me.
01:10:53.652 - 01:10:54.094, Speaker C: Okay.
01:10:54.212 - 01:11:21.286, Speaker B: But one of my big goals is to have a high EQ, high IQ support team that is able to engineers and the users as well. Because things get pretty fireweed, right? And because it's very technical, the people might not know what they're doing. And then if you get into. So you need to have a high EQ to handle them, handle these complaints. Also high IQ to understand what's going on, right? So I think my goal is to have a high IQ, high EQ support team that is able to drop products, right. Because here's the problem. If you don't have.
01:11:21.286 - 01:11:54.754, Speaker B: And also to report the issues to engineers so they can actually see the problem, right. Because the reason for simple, I feel like when we first started, we have very small number of users, right? So the user interfacing the engineers is good enough done, right? But in this case, as the number of product scale and stuff and the engineers remain, right. To be small, you can't do that. So what you need is that you need that layer to allow the users to allow the engineers to still feel the pain, but also do that stuff, right. So I think trying to build a layer is very important. So that's the first thing I want to do.
01:11:54.792 - 01:11:55.042, Speaker C: Okay.
01:11:55.096 - 01:12:16.054, Speaker B: I want to make sure that we have an extremely good community team that's able to kind of address community, address the use complaints and things like that. We're looking at real money, right? Real money here. Maybe to ask higher bucks is not such a big deal, but to someone else. It's a huge deal.
01:12:16.092 - 01:12:16.198, Speaker C: Right.
01:12:16.204 - 01:12:55.750, Speaker B: And so I think we have to be sensitive to that. Right. The second thing we're building is that I think we definitely want to improve our core products across swap, limit order, DCA, gateway pubs and launchpad. Those are a very comprehensive set of features for onchain exchange already. Right. So I don't think the next step is so I think 90% of the effort would not be new products, but just be okay making sure that those things are good and getting better every single day. So that's the second key focus.
01:12:55.820 - 01:12:56.102, Speaker C: Right.
01:12:56.156 - 01:13:21.340, Speaker B: And obviously we do actually want to experiment doing things as well. And this includes scaling our infra and getting involved with sauna core, which is something that we haven't been able to do because we haven't had the capital to do it. But if you do all with this initial launch, then we will definitely have capital to kind of get a couple of in house people to work on.
01:13:23.090 - 01:13:23.840, Speaker C: Right.
01:13:25.890 - 01:13:40.562, Speaker B: Also to build up some cross chain expertise as well. Because actually I personally has been very interested in crossing for a while now. I think we are definitely going to focus 100% on Swana being the home in our Jupiter, but at the same time, there are many mentions around.
01:13:40.616 - 01:13:41.074, Speaker C: Right.
01:13:41.192 - 01:13:52.226, Speaker B: So how do we kind of better. I'm not a chain Mackie, by the way. I'm not a chain Mackie. I do believe that focusing the product and ecosystem building on sauna is the right thing to do. And also, obviously I love the ecosystem.
01:13:52.258 - 01:13:52.454, Speaker C: Right.
01:13:52.492 - 01:14:13.820, Speaker B: That'd be very nice to me at center. I think it's very important to connect with other ecosystems as well. So trying to figure out what's the best way to do that is important for me. So those are things that I want to have people attempt to work on as well. Those three things like making sure that we scale up in terms of. So in summary, three things, right? Making sure we scale up in terms of the basics. Right.
01:14:13.820 - 01:14:23.538, Speaker B: To me, one important basic that the engineers would grow because they need more people. So they will grow on their own.
01:14:23.624 - 01:14:24.018, Speaker C: Right.
01:14:24.104 - 01:14:38.126, Speaker B: But then what no one will explicitly do unless someone do really push that. Right. Is this like community support. So that's my focus. And you're not engineers hiring.
01:14:38.158 - 01:14:38.900, Speaker A: All right.
01:14:39.350 - 01:14:39.822, Speaker B: Okay.
01:14:39.896 - 01:14:47.880, Speaker A: So the hiring, you guys are going to be hiring for a bunch of roles. If people are interested in those roles, what types of people are you looking for.
01:14:50.110 - 01:15:09.086, Speaker B: Different? I think we are interested in interested in people with proven like people with proven expertise. There are two kinds, right. The first kind, you are generally where you can learn right. And then that's kind of the high EQ. High Q guys are talking about.
01:15:09.108 - 01:15:09.246, Speaker C: Right.
01:15:09.268 - 01:15:09.486, Speaker B: In this.
01:15:09.508 - 01:15:09.758, Speaker C: Like that.
01:15:09.764 - 01:15:33.990, Speaker B: Right. So that's the first category. And very often those guys are sourced from a community, pretend to be great. I think that the second ones are those that have a proven expertise, whether it's in terms of running infra, running high scale infra, sauna infra, or having or contributed to the sauna core work, those two sets of people.
01:15:34.140 - 01:15:46.460, Speaker A: Beautiful. Well, yeah, it's always a big day when you launch a token, so congrats on that. If people want to just learn more about Jupiter, or maybe some Ethereum people want to use Jupyter for the first time, where would you send people?
01:15:47.710 - 01:15:51.120, Speaker B: Okay, so thanks for asking. I appreciate it. Go to.
01:15:56.930 - 01:16:01.280, Speaker A: Our site, jup ag, Jupiter aggregator. Is that what that is?
01:16:01.810 - 01:16:45.920, Speaker B: And then there's a gateway, and then there's a bridge or gateway link there. Go to and over there you can find all of the different ways you can bring to Solana. We have this comparator can compare what's the best way between different bridges to bring your campaign in. Or you can do it via credit card, or can do it in as well and get some sold. So we have a very comprehensive way for you to bridge Nasaana. And if you're interested in learning more about the things I was discussing, right, you can check out my Twitter or even for more concise information. Look at I shit on Twitter, but I can check out Jup research, right.
01:16:45.920 - 01:16:49.726, Speaker B: I copied if research here.
01:16:49.748 - 01:16:49.886, Speaker C: Okay.
01:16:49.908 - 01:16:55.758, Speaker B: So it's literally j u p r e a r c h. Okay.
01:16:55.924 - 01:16:59.170, Speaker A: We'll get all these links into the show notes for listeners who just want to.
01:16:59.240 - 01:17:26.794, Speaker B: But the due research is very sad because that's actually okay. I'm personally committed to doing two things. Okay. I'm actually very apologetic for all the misunderstands out there. So I'm personally apologetic for that. So I'm committed to writing to doing two things right, to writing out a lot of the information into the research post, and also to post a simplified version on Twitter as well. So I'll do those.
01:17:26.992 - 01:17:30.880, Speaker A: Okay, well, meow. Thank you so much. Where did the name meow come from?
01:17:31.810 - 01:17:46.546, Speaker B: Oh my God. Okay, first of all, I wish. I love cats. Check it out. Of course, actually, my full name is actually very similar to Meow. Very similar to Meow. So it just came out together.
01:17:46.546 - 01:17:58.660, Speaker B: And then I think it's just fun because not everyone like founders, right? But everyone loves cats, right? Not everyone like tech bros, right? But everyone loves cats. I said okay, sure.
01:18:00.710 - 01:18:07.480, Speaker A: All right. Well, once again, congrats on the token launch and thanks for coming on the bankless nation telling us your story.
01:18:08.410 - 01:18:42.930, Speaker B: Thank big fan of yours, really. Thank you so much for bridging the tours. I know how hard it is for you to bridge the tours because there's a lot of things going on, but I really appreciate it for doing that to everyone. Ethereum, I would say that Ethereum was my home for a long time and I continue to really appreciate community. The research community is way ahead of anybody else and the amount of decentralization there is amazing as well. Things like that. So I continue to be a very big fan, even though I do most I will in say, of course, of course.
01:18:43.000 - 01:18:43.282, Speaker C: Thanks.
01:18:43.336 - 01:18:53.346, Speaker A: Meow. Bankless nation. You guys know the deal. Crypto is risky, Defi is risky, new tokens are risky. Everything's risky here. But sometimes that's why we're here, because we're headed west. This is the frontier.
01:18:53.346 - 01:18:56.820, Speaker A: It's not for everyone. But we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
