00:00:15.730 - 00:00:30.742, Speaker A: It is a big day for the Bankless nation. We've got a special episode for you. To celebrate the news, arbitram is dropping a token, the ARB Token. We're going to talk about that and many of the announcements from today. David, who do we have on?
00:00:30.876 - 00:00:55.390, Speaker B: We have two of the co founders of Arbitrum, stephen Goldfeder and Harry Kalodner. If you are familiar with the Arbitrum ecosystem, them, these men need no introductions. They have been with Arbitrum since day one. And the day has finally arrived. I think today is unofficially going to go down in ethereum history as Arbitrum Day, or at least Arbitrum Token Day. Every March 16. We'll remember today.
00:00:55.390 - 00:01:18.954, Speaker B: Well, it is a big day because of course we all like to talk about tokens. The tokens are a very big deal. People love to talk about tokens. More than that, it is not the only announcement that Arbitrum is bringing to the table today. There are other things that we must discuss. So there is the Arbitrum constitution, there is these cool things called Arbitrum orbits. And these things all are what the Arbitrum token governs over.
00:01:18.954 - 00:01:34.302, Speaker B: Remember, these are responsibility tokens. And now there are things to be responsible over. And there is a way for people to express that responsibility, which is the token that we all know and love, the ARB Token. And that is what's happening today.
00:01:34.436 - 00:01:42.826, Speaker A: Well, I can't wait to accept my responsibility and I can't wait to dive into this episode. Guys, we will be right back into the episode with Stephen and Harry.
00:01:42.858 - 00:01:43.858, Speaker C: But before we do, we want to.

00:04:44.750 - 00:04:56.560, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation. We have Harry and Steven on this arbitram day. Happy ARB day, guys. It is great to have you back on. Bankless, we've heard you got a few things to announce, so we're super excited to have you on. How's it going?
00:04:57.010 - 00:04:59.438, Speaker C: Good. Happy ARB day. Thanks for having us on here.
00:04:59.524 - 00:05:13.990, Speaker A: All right, so every time you come on, we ask the exact same question. At some point during the conversation. Usually we save it to the end. Today, I'm going to bring it to the very front of this episode. When token? When arbitram token?
00:05:15.210 - 00:05:16.310, Speaker C: March 23.
00:05:16.380 - 00:05:17.880, Speaker E: Did you guys not see the news?
00:05:21.930 - 00:05:24.262, Speaker A: Tell us about it. Yeah, congratulations, guys.
00:05:24.316 - 00:05:48.480, Speaker B: Yeah, congrats. Yeah. I'm sure this has been a long time coming. Of course. So, Steve and Harry, we were on a Twitter space today, so people that were tuning into that Twitter space as well, they might hear a rendition of these same questions. So when was it known that a token would exist? And then so that's the first question. Second question, when did you know that it was going to be launched in March 23?
00:05:49.570 - 00:06:20.998, Speaker C: Yeah. It's funny, because if you look back a bunch of years back, we were vehemently against a token love to post this little snippet of Ed, I think it's maybe 2020 or so where Ed said there are no plans to launch a token in discord. And that was the truth at that time for us. It was really a technical decision that drove us. And we realized if you went back in history the whole vision of what Arbitrum was was different. They read the Arbitrum paper. Every chain was an app chain.
00:06:20.998 - 00:07:15.180, Speaker C: So as the vision emerged and there was like one public chain for many applications, for many projects it became clear that decentralized governance was the only way to actually have a secure, decentralized layer. Two. Again, in the app chain world everyone could just control their own environment. But in the shared environment it was clear to us that a token plays in a very important role to decentralization. So I think it was a gradual process over time but probably sometime, I would say maybe probably in the year and a half, two years ago is when we coalesced and realized that at some point in the right time when the technology is ready to be decentralized this is an important step towards decentralization. When do we know? It was March 23. We've been targeting this vicinity for a while but was only in the last week or two that we actually honed in on this day.
00:07:15.180 - 00:07:31.520, Speaker C: And part of it is there was a lot of turmoil earlier on. We wanted to make sure that the world wasn't failing on the day we did it as well. But probably in the last week and a half, two weeks is when we really honed in on this day and planned for this day.
00:07:31.890 - 00:07:33.454, Speaker B: Beautiful. Yeah.
00:07:33.492 - 00:07:34.490, Speaker A: Go ahead, Harry.
00:07:34.650 - 00:08:06.460, Speaker E: The other thing there being I think there are a lot of projects out there that kind of I don't mean in the Lt's, I just mean in general where they kind of announce token plans and then there is kind of like a long, long journey to actually sort of execute on those plans. Whereas I think kind of from the beginning we felt as though if we're going to do the thing, we're going to do the thing and sort of take it seriously and come at it with kind of fully prepared which was kind of, I think, critically important for us.
00:08:07.310 - 00:08:36.450, Speaker B: I remember just talking to people out in the Twitter sphere and in various discords that y'all, waited long enough that some people had given up hope that Arbitrum would ever issue a token. And that's when I said that's the moment that they will issue a token when all hope seems lost is when the token will arrive. And it seems to be that today is the day. Steven, Harry, I'm wondering if you can kind of just place us in history for Arbitrum. Right. And also ethereum history.
00:08:36.520 - 00:08:36.718, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:36.744 - 00:09:07.840, Speaker B: And so it's 2023 in Ethereum. We have 4844 ish around the corner. We have understood Ethereum to have this roll up Centric Roadmap. Then in Arbitrum history, we have Arbitrum, nitro is launched, we have Arbitrum Nova. There's other future things in Arbitrum on the Arbitrum roadmap. Why is now the right time for Arbitrum of all times, of all milestones that Arbitrum could achieve? Why is this the right milestone for the Arbitrum Token to arrive? Why now?
00:09:09.650 - 00:10:05.310, Speaker C: Yeah, so it really falls into the right place in the technical roadmap. So you mentioned Nitro. Nitro was a critical upgrade, an important upgrade, an upgrade that gave us better compression, but for users, better throughput and lower fees and really allowed Arbitrum to handle the capacity that's come to it. Yesterday, anecdotally Arbitrum one had about 40 TPS sustained for a while. I think someone was like trying to test the waters there. And so Nitro is really a critical component to making sure that Arbitrum could handle the traffic that's coming today and the traffic that we imagine will continue to steadily increase in the future. A few months after Nitro so I think it was in November, just a few months ago, we announced that about a dozen institutional validators have been validating.
00:10:05.310 - 00:10:39.190, Speaker C: The arbitrary have agreed to validate the arbitrary one chain. And that included companies like Unit 410 via Coinbase, the Ethereum Foundation, Google Cloud really strong validator set, which was a very important step in the decentralizations. They were added to the whitelist for the validators and they are providing security to the chain. So naturally the next step for us was, okay, so there are independent validators. There's a fraud proof mechanism that actually gives the chain the connection to Ethereum. Now is the time to give up chain ownership. And we at off chain labs don't want to have control over the chain.
00:10:39.190 - 00:11:32.954, Speaker C: We want to give this chain to the Dow and to the community. And it was a natural progression. Now there is this mature technology that is validated by roughly a dozen independent parties and it made sense to remove the most glaring remaining point of centralization was the ownership of the chain. And some people might ask, well, why don't you just get rid of the ownership of the chain? You don't need an owner of the chain works. And the answer for that is upgradability and upgradability can be for new features of a Dow should choose to deploy on the chain, but also it's for emergency situations where there's hopefully not but a security incident and the chain needs to be upgraded away from that. So you have these two things that are sort of in conflict a little bit. On the one hand, you want someone to be able to upgrade the chain.
00:11:32.954 - 00:11:48.690, Speaker C: On the other hand, we don't want there to be any centralized entities to have that power. And the natural solution is don't have a centralized entity but give that power to the down to community. And this was the largest point of centralization remaining of the chain. And naturally, it was the one to tackle.
00:11:51.350 - 00:12:28.250, Speaker B: Beautiful. I want to get into some of the details of the actual Arbitrum token, the actual AirDrop distribution and AirDrop criteria. So I'm going to share my screen here and pull up this pie chart. And I'm wondering, Steven, if you could just walk us through this pie chart. Right, so we got a various set of participants here investors, team and future team plus advisors, dows and Arbitrum ecosystem, individual wallets and Dow treasuries. So let's start with individual wallets because that is, quote unquote, the AirDrop. Can we start there? And we'll walk through this pie chart and then we'll go into how people became eligible for the AirDrop.
00:12:28.410 - 00:13:08.842, Speaker C: Absolutely. So individual wallets, like you said, is the typical AirDrop. Those are the tokens that will go to user wallets. These are arbitrary users and I'll explain soon. Or we can get into what the criteria is, how they're eligible, but fundamentally look at different types of usage in the chain and try to find the real users and eliminate some of the sybils or the AirDrop farmers to get remember, the point is to give governance power to the user, to the community. You want to really get the actual users that are invested in the protocol to be represented. I'll go clockwise, I guess the Dow Treasury is next.
00:13:08.842 - 00:13:54.860, Speaker C: That's also a community portion. It goes to the community fundamentally, but it goes to the Dow Treasury. It's not given out on the AirDrop that will be used to fund the Dow over time given to the community via grant programs. Part of that will also be a discretionary budget to the foundation, which will be proposed in AIP one, which is already proposed to give $750,000,000 sorry, 750,000,000 ARP tokens to the foundation. And the foundation will be able to do discretionary grant programs as well. Again, all approved by the Dow. But should it be approved by the Dow EIP One, but give the foundation an operating budget as well to execute on the will of Dow, hire people, et cetera, to do that.
00:13:54.860 - 00:14:35.350, Speaker C: The next bucket is team and future Team and Advisors. And this is basically current and future people that are affiliated with Off Chain Labs, which is the initial company that built Arbitrum. And also future employees of Off Chain Labs will also be eligible for upside there. So there's a bucket reserve for them too. And that's 26.94%. And then investors these are the arbitrary investors sorry, the Off Chain Labs investors. We raised three funding rounds to date, a seed round, the Series A and a Series B.
00:14:35.350 - 00:15:04.770, Speaker C: And all those investors, besides for their equity, which they'll keep, will also get tokens. And it's 17.53% of what they get. It's important, though, for these two. I just want to clarify, whereas the AirDrop, which we discussed, that will be available March 23, users will be able to claim it, transfer it, do what they want with it. The investors and the team portion have some more restrictions attached to them. And number one is they are locked up.
00:15:04.770 - 00:15:56.530, Speaker C: It's a four year lockup with a one year cliff. So what that means is for the first year their tokens will remain locked and no one will get any of them. Come the first anniversary, they will get one quarter of their tokens and then they'll gradually every month, the remainder will vest for the next three years. So four years, first year, nothing. Then there's sort of a large amount which is everything they would have gotten monthly over the first year given them at the end of the first year and then monthly from then on. That's true for investors and that's true for the team and future Team Bucket as well. The second restriction on the team is we've instructed everyone at Offchain Labs not to vote directly with their tokens, but to really empower the community and increase the community, say by going through the delegation process.
00:15:56.530 - 00:16:33.274, Speaker C: And this will be part of the claiming process, will be the ability to delegate tokens to community members. So the team will not be allowed to vote their tokens themselves, but they will be encouraged to delegate them to community members that apply them for themselves as delegates. The next last slice, I guess, is the Dow AirDrop. And this is a really interesting part of the AirDrop. We consider it part of the AirDrop as well, but it doesn't go to individual users. Instead it goes to DAOs in the Arbitrum ecosystem. So Arbitrum ecosystem projects that have DAOs, that have their own communities.
00:16:33.274 - 00:17:22.590, Speaker C: And the idea is the know, we can talk about eligibility criteria, but the individual wallets, you can never be perfect. And we at Offshoot Labs, together with the Arbitrum Foundation as well as Nansen, worked very hard over the course of many months trying to build criteria that sort of optimized for getting a large number of users but also giving them something meaningful. And these things are in conflict, right? You can try to give every user every touch of the chain and then everyone gets something very little. Or you can try to focus on a smaller but still significant set of users and try to give them something more significant. But of course there will always be people that are missed. For example, someone that recently started using Arbitrum might only have a transaction or two and they might not be eligible for the AirDrop or for the individual AirDrop. And it's hard to discern from them sometimes from an AirDrop farmer and so this gets a little bit difficult.
00:17:22.590 - 00:18:26.050, Speaker C: So one thing that we've done is the Dow AirDrop which gives the tokens to these Dows and they can decide how they distribute and use those tokens and how ultimately their community gets the benefit of those tokens. So another distribution channel, but ultimately from communities that know their users much more intimately than those designing the AirDrop for the entirety of the chain does do so much more targeted AirDrop as well. And together, those two buckets make up the AirDrop. So if you look at the pie chart, though, that little one and the two next to it, those are the community portion, portion of the distribution. And the left side is the sort of what they call insider, which is investors, team, future team, advisors. And you can see that the majority of the tokens, roughly 56%, will go to the community. Twelve point 75% initially, and then over time, more via the Dow treasury.
00:18:26.550 - 00:19:11.262, Speaker B: Yeah. And this Dows in the Arbitrum ecosystem airdrop, I think, is actually particularly interesting because I don't think we've particularly seen that before. And this is actually a prediction that I made. So I'm going to go ahead and give myself a small pat on the back here. That Arbitrum was sufficiently as a community, as an ecosystem, as its own ecosystem is large enough that there were actually now Dows inside of Arbitrum that have their own native communities. And so I think really what this is meant to do is giving certain power over to the DAOs to decide from themselves who and how they should distribute the last of the ARB tokens. And so, Harry, I'm glad you went clockwise from the individual wallets because we could end up there.
00:19:11.262 - 00:19:25.090, Speaker B: And I also just want to just double tap on the Dow treasury, the 43%, which I think is the largest part of that supply here. This is really just about empowering the community with future tokens to do future things.
00:19:25.160 - 00:19:25.358, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:25.384 - 00:19:46.506, Speaker B: And so to me, I see the individual wallets and the Dows in the Arbitrum ecosystem as rewarding past behavior. And then the Dow treasury is like, all right, well, this is for future growth of the ecosystem, future allocations towards whatever the community decides. And the Dow treasury will be up to the community. Right? Is that the right idea here?
00:19:46.688 - 00:20:11.806, Speaker C: Absolutely. Yeah. The Dow treasury will be fully up to the community, to allocate. And it belongs to the community. It's given to the community, and the community will have to say where it goes over time. And, yeah, we expect the community to do very interesting things and build the Arbitrum ecosystem and act in the best interest of the Arbitrum ecosystem with its tokens.
00:20:11.918 - 00:20:49.920, Speaker A: So this is a governance token, which also brings the question of what exactly in the Arbitrum ecosystem does this token govern over? And so I think you were saying earlier, Stephen, that upgrades is a key feature. Right. If you want to have some sort of human driven upgrade, then there requires some sort of governance decision and that governance can have degrees of centralization or decentralization. This makes it more decentralized. But what exactly are they governing over? What are they kind of sovereign over? Is it the Arbitrage one chain? Is it Arbitrum Nova? Is it anything else beyond that?
00:20:52.290 - 00:21:25.318, Speaker C: Yeah, so it's arbitrary one and arbitrary Nova. So actually, an interesting detail. The actual governance of voting will happen in Arbitrage One, but it will govern both Arbitrage one and arbitrary Nova. And you sort of want it to be in one place because imagine that there is stuff going on in one inova you don't want users to have to move over their tokens. So all those users that want to take place in either of the governance will happen in Arbitrage One, but fundamentally, it will govern both of those chains. And it could be that the Dow will adopt a new chain to govern over time. You mentioned before, earlier, and I'm sure we'll get into later, that part of this announcement was making it easy for people to launch their own layer threes permissionlessly.
00:21:25.318 - 00:22:02.520, Speaker C: That doesn't mean the Dow will govern them. If you actually want the Dow to say, hey, take ownership and own this chain, that would obviously require the Dow to agree to that. But the other two big items that it governs is the direction of the arbitrary ecosystem via its technology. So via upgrades, but also via the spending and aligning, right? So we can foster the ecosystem by giving grants or trying to align with other projects and other developers. Today we off chain labs. What is our role? We're a service provider to the Dow. If the Dao asks us to build a feature and we know how to build that, we'll build it.
00:22:02.520 - 00:22:31.002, Speaker C: But fundamentally, we're servicing the Dow. I imagine over time that will become a more competitive space. But in a good sense, there will be others as well that want to build technology for the Arwicham ecosystem. We don't have a privileged role there. And those tokens will be able to align with other service providers as well. And the last one, which I touched on, which I think is really interesting, is the Dow will have the ability to license additional layer two chains. So this is a bit of nuance.
00:22:31.002 - 00:22:56.530, Speaker C: There are two parts of Arbitrum orbit. One is layer three chains and layer three chains. These are roll ups or any trust chains. It could be either one of our technologies that settle onto a different Arbitrum chain that's approved by the Dow. So, like, Arbitrage One and Arbitrage Nova. Those are permissionless open. You can, without going to the Dow, without asking anyone by nature of the license that exists today, go ahead and launch your own layer three chain.
00:22:56.530 - 00:23:28.766, Speaker C: You can modify the code, you can customize the chain to do really whatever you want. But it may be a time where someone says, I don't want a layer three chain. I want a layer two chain. And the Dow might say one might say, hey, does it make sense for the Dow to share Arbitrum has best in class technology? Does it make sense for the Dow to share this with a different layer two chain? Is that competitive? Is that a good idea. And different people have different this is deep philosophical argument and many people have different opinions on this. But fundamentally our thought was it shouldn't be our opinion on this. It's a controversial topic.
00:23:28.766 - 00:23:58.806, Speaker C: It should be the community's opinion. So the community, via the Dow governance, will have the ability to launch, to license other L two chains on Ethereum. One of the principles of the Dow, though, that is Ethereum aligned in the constitution, there's a series of values listed and one of them is Ethereum alignment. So it will by nature of that constitutional value look to approve layer twos that are on Ethereum. But whether or not it approves them is fully and grants that license is fully in the discretion of the Dow.
00:23:58.918 - 00:24:14.674, Speaker A: So just to make sure I can repeat back what I heard and understand so if I want to launch three, then that is completely permissionless. I can just go do that on top of Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nitro. Is that correct so far?
00:24:14.872 - 00:24:16.286, Speaker C: Yes. Arbitrum one or nova.
00:24:16.318 - 00:24:28.840, Speaker A: Yes, or Nova. Excuse me. And if I want to launch my own chain using Arbitrum technology, then it goes to ARB Dow vote. Basically it goes to kind of token vote for this.
00:24:30.810 - 00:24:47.658, Speaker C: So, yeah, your own layer two chain, your own layer. Yeah, exactly. Your only two chain that settles directly to Ethereum, that's basically equivalent to Arbitrage One in terms of where it sits. That would have to be proposed to the Dow and it would be up to the Dow to decide whether it wants to grant that license or not.
00:24:47.744 - 00:24:59.440, Speaker A: Is the ARP token being used to pay for gas fees or anything else? Has that changed? Or is the Arbtram ecosystem still using ETH as its unit of account and exchange here?
00:25:00.530 - 00:25:17.430, Speaker C: That has not changed and that's enshrined one of the ETH alignment values enshrined in the constitution is that that won't change. ETH is the gas token of the chains and the ARP token will not be used for that as enshrined to the constitution.
00:25:18.010 - 00:26:12.518, Speaker E: By the way, just to kind of quickly circle back to that first category just because to expand slightly protocol upgrades and kind of protocol control because I think it's useful to sort of unpack it a little since it sounds relatively dry, but I think there's a lot of stuff in there that's pretty interesting. So that includes kind of permissioning over who is validating the chain and adding validators it includes control over who actually runs the sequencer potentially kind of control over sort of alterations to kind of how kind of the sequencer handles things like strategy around mev. It controls certainly kind of protocol upgrades and sort of to what degree sort of new EIPS are adopted. So there's kind of a huge amount of kind of pretty important control there where the Dow will be kind of fundamentally in the driver's seat because I.
00:26:12.524 - 00:26:44.154, Speaker B: Want to get into a little bit of the eligibility for how people got their tokens. And one thing we didn't talk about on the Twitter space this morning was how difficult it was to prune away all of the farmers. But I'm going to load up this website here, this brand new Spiffy website, Arbitrum Doubt Foundation, which is where you go to check your eligibility. So I'm going to go ahead and hit this button. And I've got a wallet loaded up here, and I've got 3125 tokens. And I think these are all the categories here. And each one of these categories has different teams.
00:26:44.154 - 00:27:00.374, Speaker B: And Steven, if you don't mind us walking through, you can speed run this pretty quickly. But just like sort of the strategy here for how these tiers were selected and then some of the strategy also pruning away all the farmers. Can you just talk about the strategy for eligibility here?
00:27:00.572 - 00:27:34.306, Speaker C: Yeah. So Bridging funds is obviously one of the key metrics that we use, which is, do you have funds on the network? And you'll see also these top ones are for Arbitrum One. So transactions over time. So what that means is this is another way to see real sustained users from users that may come and go. Some users sometimes do their transactions over a day and they come. That might be typical of an AirDrop farmer. They come, they transact once, and they never come back.
00:27:34.306 - 00:28:23.134, Speaker C: But users that transact over two months or even more, that shows some sustained usage of the chain. And it's reasons to believe that this is a more aligned user transaction. Frequency and interaction that says how many transactions or how many smart contracts in a single transaction do one interact with? Which, again, goes to be a metric of how deep was the usage of the chain, was it a single interaction, was it a much more complex interaction? And there are different levels of that transaction. Value is exactly what it sounds like. And the idea being that it's not the only category because we don't want to overemphasize that. There are ways to get larger drops by using lower value, but one input is how much value was transacted and more points are given for more assets. Bridge arbitrage one.
00:28:23.134 - 00:28:50.762, Speaker C: Just how much did one bridge and then the same thing. Those are for all for Arbitrage One, Arbitrage Nova. And the reason, by the way, by Arbitrum Nova is not that it's a less important chain. It's just a chain that had a much smaller lifecycle. It's only been around since August. So it has a sort of minimized criteria, which is a single point system that sort of mashes in whether or not one interacted on Arbitra Nova. All these are added up to a point system.
00:28:50.762 - 00:29:20.850, Speaker C: And we have these in our docs, the conversion. And there are also ways that people can lose points, right? Those are sort of the positive ways. But if people do certain things, like create patterns. That look very much like civils and farming, they can lose points as well. And so, again, the idea being looking to align to the real users, not those that were to give the governance power to the real users, not those that were just trying to farm the AirDrop. And all those go into criteria. There's a set of points.
00:29:20.850 - 00:29:54.318, Speaker C: And the nice thing is, so I mentioned that off Chain Labs worked with the Arbitrary Foundation, and Nansen, with this nansen is actually putting out, I think, a large blog post on this and their process. And we worked very closely together and we're also publishing actually we've already published all the data around this. So it's not like this opaque box. Like these are the criteria, these are the categories. They're pretty broad. And any user that's so inclined and so technically inclined can go ahead and actually do the analysis themselves and repeat the analysis and say, okay, this is actually correct. This is the amount of points that I have.
00:29:54.318 - 00:29:57.130, Speaker C: And this was done correctly and fairly.
00:29:57.210 - 00:30:04.902, Speaker A: I always think it's funny. We've come on an awful long way since the Uniswap AirDrop, haven't we? Which is, did you use Uniswap? Okay, you're getting token.
00:30:04.986 - 00:30:05.620, Speaker B: Okay.
00:30:06.390 - 00:30:24.294, Speaker A: Now that would be game, that would be farm, that would be impossible to do. And so we're much more complicated. And it sounds like the criteria you guys put forth was just necessarily complicated to kind of wean out all of the farmers and the mercenaries and get to the actual users in the community.
00:30:24.492 - 00:30:26.310, Speaker B: Uniswap had it real easy.
00:30:26.460 - 00:30:50.938, Speaker A: But I almost wonder is so this is obviously open source. This is posted, right? Guess what happens? They adopt for the next one. I mean, a year or two later, the next Airdrops are going to have to get even more complicated still. That just definitely seems to be the trend, but well done on the work to kind of weed out and focus on the good users.
00:30:50.954 - 00:31:23.980, Speaker C: Here one thing I like, though, which I think to counter that, which might be helpful, is we didn't only give positive points for things that look good, we actually took away points. And this might be a deterrent from the future. If you just didn't do the farming, you'd actually get more points and more tokens. So by nature, these additional activity lose. So maybe I hope for additional Airdrops, people might think twice and say, I actually may not only not be helping myself, I actually may be actively hurting myself by doing this. So we can only hope that that might have some effect.
00:31:24.510 - 00:31:26.170, Speaker E: Feels like an arms race.
00:31:26.830 - 00:31:29.786, Speaker A: Totally. Is definitely an arms race, guys.
00:31:29.808 - 00:31:57.080, Speaker B: There's a lot more to talk about. There's a new constitution. And the word constitution gets me up and going because it implies some sort of network state, some sort of community ownership. I think there's still a lot more to talk about with the phase of decentralization that arbitram is in, as well as things like the Committee of Validators and the Security Council, and we've talked about layer threes at a high level, but I want to go into that a little bit more. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.
00:31:57.930 - 00:32:39.074, Speaker D: Uniswap is the largest on chain marketplace for self custody digital assets. Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange, but you know this because you've been listening to Bankless. But did you know that the Uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat onram? Now, you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to Tokens in DFI inside of Uniswap. Not only that, but Polygon Arbitrum and optimism. Layer twos are supported right out of the gate, but that's just DFI. Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, letting you find more listings for the best prices across the NFT world. With Uniswap, you can sweep floors on multiple NFTs, and Uniswap's universal router will optimize your gas fees for you.
00:32:39.074 - 00:33:12.986, Speaker D: Uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across Ethereum, and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor. So go to app Uniswap.org today to buy, sell or swap Tokens and NFTs. The phantom wallet is coming to Ethereum. The number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved UX to Ethereum and Polygon. If you haven't used Phantom before, you've been missing out. Phantom was one of the first wallets to pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for Ethereum and Polygon.
00:33:12.986 - 00:33:48.854, Speaker D: But that's just staking. Phantom is also the best home for your NFTs. Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your NFT experience, pin your favorites, hide your Uglies, burn the spam, and also manage your NFT sale listings from inside the wallet. Phantom is of course, a MultiChain wallet, but it makes chain management easy, displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or phishing websites. Phantom has already saved over 20,000 users from getting scammed or hacked. So get on the Phantom Waitlist and be one of the first to access the MultiChain beta. There's a link in the show notes, or you can go to Phantom app.
00:33:48.972 - 00:33:51.302, Speaker B: Waitlist to get access in late February.
00:33:51.446 - 00:34:25.426, Speaker D: Hey, bankless nation. If you're listening to this, it's because you're on the free Bankless RSS feed. Did you know that there's an ad free version of Bankless that comes with the Bankless Premium subscription? No ads, just straight to the content. But that's just one of many things that a Premium subscription gets you. There's also the Token Report, a monthly Bullish bearish neutral report on the hottest tokens of the month. And the regular updates from the Token Report go into the Token Bible, your first stop shop for every token worth investigating in crypto. Bankless Premium also gets you a 30% discount to the Permissionless Conference, which means it basically just pays for itself.
00:34:25.426 - 00:35:02.542, Speaker D: There's also the AirDrop guide to make sure you don't miss a drop in 2023. But really the best part about Bankless Premium is hanging out with me, Ryan and the rest of the Bankless team in the Inner Circle discord only for premium members. Want the alpha? Check out Ben, the analyst, Djen Pit, where you can ask him questions about the Token report. Got a question? I've got my own Q and A room for any questions that you might have at Bankless. We have huge things planned for 2023, including a new website with login with your Ethereum address capabilities. And we're super excited to ship what we are calling Bankless 20 Soon TM. So if you want extra help exploring the frontier, subscribe to Bankless Premium.
00:35:02.542 - 00:35:08.770, Speaker D: It's under fifty cents a day and provides a wealth of knowledge and support on your journey west. I'll see you in the discord.
00:35:10.790 - 00:35:36.726, Speaker B: And we are back because it's Arbitrum day. Talking all things arbitram. Especially ARB. Tokens. One thing that we missed, though, when we were talking about the Token distribution is that one particular guild, one particular Dao got a token AirDrop of the ARB Tokens. Steven, walk us through Protocol Guild and why it was determined that they should, whoever they are, should get some ARP tokens. So what's Protocol Guild, who are they and why did you decide to give them some tokens?
00:35:36.838 - 00:36:40.286, Speaker C: Yeah, Protocol Guild is a collective of ETH, core developers and contributors from, really the Ethereum Foundation and around the ecosystem in a variety of companies. I think it's roughly 100 individuals, if I'm remembering correctly. And they do really important and often thankless, thankless and sometimes really community work that's important for everyone. And we definitely have benefited tremendously from their work, both by the fact that Arbitrum is built on Ethereum and also the Arbitrum technology uses GEF, uses pieces of the Ethereum code base, and when designed, the Airdrop. I think the thought between us at Offchain and the Arbitrary Foundation was this is something that would make sense and is owed to them almost because of the fantastic work that they do. And really, we'd like to include them in the AirDrop even though they're not technically eligible. Right.
00:36:40.286 - 00:37:21.934, Speaker C: They're not an Arbitrum dow, they're not on Arbitrum. I'm actually not even sure how they're going to have to figure out how to get their tokens because they are on Ethereum. So that's going to be I'm sure they'll get there, but they definitely didn't meet the official criteria. But again, when you think about the principle, the point of the Arbitrum governance and distributing the AirDrop is to put the governance and the power in the hands of individuals and people who are acting in the best interest and who better the chain and will work to further the interest of Ethereum and Arbitrum. And who better to have representative governance than the folks at Protocol guild, just.
00:37:21.972 - 00:37:55.430, Speaker A: To be clear to everyone. Steven so Protocol Guild is working on general ethereum public goods, right? Ethereum infrastructure stuff related to Arbitrum but not part of Arbitrum. It benefits the entire ecosystem. This is a group of builders that are building that public good and they are also a Dow as well. So it's very cool to see layer twos step up and start to support the OG layer One ethereum where all of this stuff is built and originates.
00:37:56.090 - 00:38:55.370, Speaker E: I think that start well, for a long time, obviously we've been kind of deeply had a ton of respect for kind of ethereum development and l one development and in a personal capacity for a long time. I think that our acquisition of Prismatic Labs last October now maybe really kind of getting the chance to sort of work with core developers on a kind of day to day basis. Really sort of just drove home kind of this idea of this extremely tight alignment between layer one and layer two where we're all really solving the same problems and we're all kind of very interdependent on each other and that kind of I think there's a lot of hope that sort of as the arbitram dow kind of grows and expands and I think kind of one of the principles of the dow is ethereum alignment to try to hopefully kind of maintain that ethos in perpetuity.
00:38:57.230 - 00:39:28.342, Speaker B: So one of the big stories here is the constitution. Arbitrum's got a constitution and the only way that a constitution comes about if there are things to govern over and people to govern whatever we're governing over. But Harry, you want to walk us through just like at a very high level. I think at some point listeners and viewers will have to read the constitution for themselves, especially if they have their newfound responsibility, but just give us the ethos, the social contract that the Arbitrum constitution has set in stone for us.
00:39:28.396 - 00:39:29.846, Speaker A: Does it start with? We the people.
00:39:29.948 - 00:39:31.414, Speaker C: Is that how we start this?
00:39:31.612 - 00:39:33.110, Speaker B: We the Arbornauts.
00:39:34.010 - 00:40:17.126, Speaker E: That's a lost opportunity. Kicking myself now come on, guys. This is supposed to be a good net note. Yeah, I think it's funny it's the last section in the constitution, but a large chunk of the constitution has to do with kind of very kind of technical details of the governance of the chain and kind of the idea of there's kind of constitutional and non constitutional proposals. There's kind of the different categories of actions have various different sort of pathways to going through. I think it's kind of quite in line with kind of what people expect from how Dows function. I think that in the ethereum ecosystem where people participate in a lot of dows, there's a lot of value in not forcing people to learn some completely new system every time.
00:40:17.126 - 00:41:17.946, Speaker E: And so kind of staying within sort of expectations in terms of kind of maximizing participation and understanding was valuable. But then you get to the bottom, to the Community values section, which I think is kind of really important and is this kind of idea of what does it mean to be Arbitrum, which I think we hadn't really kind of talked about a ton in the past. We tend to be kind of relatively heads down building and that's the sort of thing that requires sort of really sort of zooming out and introspecting a lot. And I think kind of the development of the foundation sort of found a series of values that I think kind of really align the whole community. Ethereum alignment is number one there that fundamentally kind of being part of ethereum is sort of the whole thing. It doesn't really make sense to kind of be sort of a roll up project without that. I think in my personal view, sustainability is a really interesting one.
00:41:17.946 - 00:41:57.720, Speaker E: That's kind of the second thing listed there. The idea being that off chain labs has been around since, I think, 2018 now that will soon look like nothing in the lifetime of the Dow. That fundamentally this is building a structure that should survive decades, centuries more. It's hard to know. But having that long term vision is kind of incredibly important. Secure security is fundamentally like the thing that makes roll ups matter. And so kind of maintaining that as a central focus is kind of fundamentally just critically important.
00:41:57.720 - 00:42:49.960, Speaker E: Socially and technically inclusive. The kind of fair launch ethos that we started with quite a while ago now, I think has really just grown and spread in the Arbitrum community in a way that sort of having it be a open, welcoming place. Where kind of new projects and new people can enter easily and feel at home is kind of just incredibly important and kind of core to how people think about it. And that also goes to the last principle, kind of neutral and open and then last, but certainly not least, user focused, that fundamentally all of this eventually comes down to the users and having Arbitrum be a place where people actually want to be and interact and kind of live their digital lives online. And that really kind of, I think, sums up to me in a big way kind of what all of this is about.
00:42:50.490 - 00:43:10.720, Speaker A: So the Arbitrum values, ethereum aligned, sustainable. And to me that means oriented towards the long term, secure, socially inclusive, technically inclusive, user focused and neutral and open. Those are the values that this community stands for.
00:43:16.040 - 00:43:17.172, Speaker B: Big thumbs up.
00:43:17.306 - 00:43:18.390, Speaker A: I like those.
00:43:20.120 - 00:43:54.464, Speaker B: And it's also important that Harry, you said it and I'll just double tap on it really quick. The reason why we need a constitution is that this ship is sailing. This is you guys casting off this ecosystem to maintain itself. And so the internal, I don't know, rules and laws and self regulation that you guys have at off chain labs does not matter anymore. This is now in the hands of the community. And so this is like this code of conduct, if you will, for the Arbitrum network state. And so this is really why we need something like this.
00:43:54.464 - 00:44:02.384, Speaker B: It's like, hey guys, this is what we stand for, this is what we value, this is what we want. And that can change with a constitutional update.
00:44:02.512 - 00:44:08.870, Speaker A: The bird has left the nest, right? It's set on its own course.
00:44:09.480 - 00:44:30.156, Speaker E: What I really like about these principles is I feel like they're the sort of thing that's kind of obvious in hindsight that when you see it written down, at least personally, I would not expect there to be kind of a lot of dissension and debate. I think that probably these are things that people in the arbitrary ecosystem just kind of felt day to day, even if they hadn't sort of put words to it.
00:44:30.338 - 00:44:49.868, Speaker A: It's almost like it's more important for the future, right? When you onboard the next 10 million people and there's difficult decisions to make, then you can point back to the founding values of this thing and you say, hey, you could check that decision against these values. That's where it becomes more important to scale that culture.
00:44:50.044 - 00:44:50.770, Speaker E: Exactly.
00:44:52.180 - 00:45:21.790, Speaker B: I think one of the last subjects we'll have to talk about is one of the things that Arbitrum governance can actually govern over, which is who validates the Arbitrum chain. And so this gets into the conversation of phases of decentralization of our roll ups, which I think we all know in the ethereum ecosystem is something that we can improve upon and do better. Ethereum critics really like to talk about how centralized our layer twos are. So, Harry, can you walk us through what today means for the overall state of decentralization for Arbitrum and layer twos in general?
00:45:23.200 - 00:45:49.332, Speaker E: Yeah, absolutely. So kind of fundamentally, like you were saying, sort of roll ups. The path to decentralization for roll ups has been one that has taken time. We all wish that from day one all of it had been perfectly decentralized. But obviously the tech is complicated and vitalik some number of months ago. Now time in crypto is very hard to deal with. Great.
00:45:49.332 - 00:47:04.700, Speaker E: A great kind of template for how we kind of think about roll up decentralization. And I think kind of with this change the state that the chain had been in where kind of we still and before and after this change there's upgradability. But the great thing about the kind of movement over to the dow is that the only sort of instant upgrade mechanism that is left is this entity called the Security Council, which is elected, which is selected through elections. Every six months by the Dow and has twelve members with a nine person threshold where the members are from all sorts of organizations and all sorts of locations all over the world, in order to create as kind of strong a set as possible. And that sort of decentralization is kind of key to the actual real security properties of the chain because fundamentally, in a lot of ways, security is your weakest link. And kind of strengthening up that link is sort of this critical step to being in Stage one where we are now the second stage of decentralization, along with having working fraud proofs, which is of course, something that we started with actually when we first launched the chain. So we had that one very early.
00:47:04.700 - 00:47:12.930, Speaker E: But the kind of second tier of how we control upgradability or how the Dao controls upgradability now is kind of the big change today.
00:47:13.540 - 00:47:27.510, Speaker A: So, Harry, you guys are at stage two of decentralizing. The Arbitrum roll up then and refresh listeners. So how many stages are there in Vitalik's model that he put together and what's kind of the end state? How close are we to.
00:47:29.480 - 00:47:38.552, Speaker E: In? It started with stage zero. We're now in stage one, which is the second vitalik, he's got to start with zero, right?
00:47:38.606 - 00:47:45.404, Speaker A: Okay. He's being a decentralization hardass, he's being a programmer, right? Like rays start at zero, don't they? Okay.
00:47:45.602 - 00:48:43.228, Speaker E: Exactly. So kind of stage one is, like I described, basically the combination of having working fraud proofs and having a kind of sufficiently large upgrade multisig with a kind of sufficiently decentralized and high threshold. And that's where we end up today. The last stage is basically kind of making good on sort of an even more decentralized promise and getting to sort of the final state. The kind of two big tiers of which one is completely permissionless validation, where kind of today the Dao controls who can validate. But the goal would be that power is removed from the Dow because everybody can validate, so there's no need to permission it at all. And the second part is to remove instant upgradability, which there has been a lot of very interesting kind of conversations about sort of methods by which that can be done.
00:48:43.228 - 00:49:10.736, Speaker E: There's kind of a clear and difficult balance here in terms of ability to kind of respond to security risks in the system and kind of desire for sort of strong kind of trustlessness and decentralization. And it'll be kind of really interesting to see the Dow sort of explore those trade offs and kind of find the best ways to sort of if you can have a best of both worlds as kind of things move forward and evolve.
00:49:10.928 - 00:49:48.832, Speaker A: Okay, so can we talk about this too? So we've got the ARB token. We've got governance in place. So this entire ecosystem is more decentralized. We've got Arbitrum One. We've got Arbitrum Nova. What are these things you were talking about called orbits? Is this related to the concept of layer three? I feel like the entire concept of I mean, just when crypto is getting its head wrapped around layer twos, we're throwing layer threes at them. And I want you guys to help us imagine what layer threes will be like, what they can do in the same way.
00:49:48.886 - 00:49:49.104, Speaker C: Wow.
00:49:49.142 - 00:50:17.470, Speaker A: Was it like a year and a half ago, two years ago, when you first came on? And Arbitrum was one of the very first layer twos to kind of launch, and you were painting the picture the two of you guys were painting the picture for the Bankless community of like, we're doing this thing called a layer two here's. What it's going to be like? And I remember being very excited and blown away by that episode. Are we looking at a similar type event for layer threes? What are layer threes and are orbits related to them?
00:50:17.920 - 00:50:21.640, Speaker E: Before we go into that, I was just thinking the amusement park metaphor.
00:50:21.800 - 00:50:30.924, Speaker A: Yes, that's right. So for Bankless listeners, you remember this episode. God, when was that? I don't know. 2022 destroyed me from a 2021.
00:50:30.962 - 00:50:32.364, Speaker B: Yeah, this episode was in 2021.
00:50:32.402 - 00:50:52.052, Speaker A: This was in 2021. It was like late August or September, I think. We had this analogy of a layer two was coming theme. It was like a theme park on Ethereum. And we didn't have the rides open yet, but builders were going to go build the rides and let everyone in. It would be amazing. This is basically what we have.
00:50:52.052 - 00:50:56.116, Speaker A: I mean, I look at the small brain community, the treasure ecosystem.
00:50:56.228 - 00:50:59.080, Speaker B: These are the really want you to give an E, Brian.
00:50:59.580 - 00:51:17.470, Speaker A: They got to earn it, all right? You got to earn it with those likes. What's layer three going to be like? Is this like an amusement park inside of an amusement park? Like an underground type of experience that that we can all go and use? How is it going to be different?
00:51:18.740 - 00:51:50.984, Speaker C: So one way to, I think, describe it is like a priority lane. You have projects that they want to be secured by Ethereum, but they want their own priority lane. They don't want to congest with others. They don't want to share capacity with others. One of the coolest things about layer threes and layer twos is Arbitrum has roughly an order of magnitude. So ten times the capacity of Ethereum, any layer three chain would itself have that same capacity as well. So these layer three chains have the same capacity as the chain that they're built on.
00:51:50.984 - 00:52:17.964, Speaker C: And what I see in conversation with projects, who wants this and why do they want this? It's a few different types of projects that want it. One is projects that are doing really well. For example, there's been a lot of public conversation about Yuga Labs where they had the other side launch and they're congested Ethereum. And there are a lot of people saying, hey, you need your own priority lane on Ethereum. That could be a layer two, but it could be a layer three as well. And they have their own priority lane. They get the security of Ethereum.
00:52:17.964 - 00:53:03.836, Speaker C: They're in the Ethereum Ecosystem, but they have priority capacity and app developers or chain developers can customize this, right? So Yuga Labs or someone else could say, hey, we're going to launch a chain, a layer three, and anyone can launch on this chain, but it's sort of our ecosystem by branding. Or they can actually lock that in and say, we're going to launch a chain. And the only contracts allowed on this chain are ones that are deployed by Yuga Labs. It could still be secured by Ethereum, it just wouldn't have permissionless application deployment on it. Those are customizations that we've heard projects. I'm using Yuga Labs as an example because it's a lot of public conversation around it, but those are some of the conversations we've had. And the other big one is a lot of times projects want to make their token the center of a particular chain.
00:53:03.836 - 00:53:42.616, Speaker C: So whereas our values say ethereum ETH, we're ethereum aligned and ETH will remain the token of the public chain. So arbitram one and Arbitrage Nova, that doesn't mean that a different team that's building a layer three will say, hey, we want our token, or their token, I should say, to be the fee token of this chain. And I think we'll see a lot of that happen as well. That's a conversation with teams, that's something that comes up as well. But I think, again, it's either about wanting to build an ecosystem that's tailored for them or wanting to have that specific and reserved capacity for them. And layer three, you might say, oh, this sounds like it's good for everyone. Everyone should have their own chain.
00:53:42.616 - 00:54:20.084, Speaker C: Why do we even have public chains? It's not the case for some projects. It's good, but there's also you have to think about the infrastructure, right? Etherscan chainlink node providers like Alchemy Inferior, Quicknode, et cetera, et cetera. Are they going to go ahead and support hundreds or thousands of other chains? Probably not. They might support the big ones. So if you're sufficiently successful, you might be able to get that infrastructure. But there is a benefit of being on the public chains, to have access to the public infrastructure and also to have access to the synchronous interactions. You might say, hey, I want to be on the chain where uniswap is like my protocol taps into uniswap liquidity.
00:54:20.084 - 00:54:53.424, Speaker C: That's another right, so it's not like a silver bullet. Everyone wants their own chain. It's better, really. There are some developers and some applications, depending on who they want to be co located with, what their capacity is, et cetera, whether or not it makes sense for them to have their own chain. But that's sort of the vision and why some of the projects that we've spoken to want this and we're putting this out there just as an option and a tool for developers. And the other thing is, it's good for experimentation. There are EIPS that are proposed, but not yet on Ethereum, sometimes controversial.
00:54:53.424 - 00:55:17.290, Speaker C: You can go ahead and launch an arbitrary l Three chain on main net. And you do it in a way that EIP an experimental chain with different changes and sort of run them in a main net environment, sort of a main net testnet environment. So a lot of, I think, room for innovation here and testing grounds as well for changes that may make themselves into other chains, even Ethereum itself.
00:55:17.840 - 00:55:55.860, Speaker E: I just want to add a kind of so when we launched Arbitrum One, the things that I think were the coolest were the things we didn't see coming were just kind of like the innovative, weird uses of the tech that just like, who came up with that stuff? And I really sort of am looking, hoping, and looking forward to sort of that being the case with sort of arbitrary ability to use the Arbitrum code base to deploy L3s S, I fully expect people to come up with some crazy ideas that we couldn't possibly think of right now, which I'm very excited for.
00:55:56.010 - 00:56:19.632, Speaker B: Right? And this is what happens, of course, when you put code out into the universe, people do crazy things. And this is kind of the cool thing that keeps crypto fun and interesting and weird. Right. Like, you don't know what happens next. But that's also kind of the point. The only comparable that I really know about is Uniswap v three code is under license for a certain amount of time. I think that time is like four years that we are one year into or something.
00:56:19.632 - 00:57:01.870, Speaker B: And a DFI app on the ethereum Layer 1, volt Protocol made a submission to Uniswap dow to use the Uniswap v three license to use a Uniswap v three code. Uniswap dow said, yeah, you can use it because in the proposal, volts Protocol gave Uniswap 1% of their tokens. And so that's what convinced the Uniswap dow to vote, yes, you can use our code. And we don't know what comes next with this Arbitrum code base. But now the point is that it's in the hands of the Arbitrum token holders because now the token exists. And so that weird, future unknown state will be determined by the people that have all of the responsibility, which is what we are celebrating here today.
00:57:02.240 - 00:57:03.870, Speaker C: Responsibility, definitely.
00:57:04.880 - 00:57:51.660, Speaker A: So, guys, as we draw this to a close, I'm just curious. This has been a huge moment, of course, and a lot has gone into bringing the Arbitrum ecosystem to this point. This is distribution of responsibility. This is distribution of ownership. This is distribution of governance. But what is next for Arbitrum after this? Like, are you excited about EIP 4844? Is that a thing that's interesting or coming kind of the blossoming of the layer Three? Is that what you're most excited about? Arbitrum Nova? Is that a thing? What is the next thing the crypto community should look for from Arbitrum?
00:57:53.760 - 00:58:21.008, Speaker C: Yeah, so I guess this is the first time we're on. Here where I say we don't have control over the answer to that question, which is the interesting part. Right? Fundamentally, I can tell you what excites me. So I'm very excited about EIP 4844. I'm also very excited and hope the Dow continues to take steps and expect the Dow to decentralize and get rid of that whitelist which you've mentioned, which is really one of the last steps of decentralization. So those to me are really excited.
00:58:21.184 - 00:58:26.744, Speaker A: In terms of and why 4844 for people who aren't aware of what's going to happen there.
00:58:26.942 - 00:59:24.296, Speaker C: Yeah. So roll ups like Arbitrum, but really all roll ups, they put a lot of data on Ethereum and that's critical to the security. So we talk a lot about the fraud proofs, but in order for the fraud proofs to work and even actually for validity proofs of DK roll ups, you need the transaction data in a compressed form put on Ethereum. And it turns out that that's actually the largest cost, at least for Arbitrum and optimistic roll ups is just putting that data on Ethereum. And if you have a transaction fee and a five cent transaction fee, the majority is actually just passed through to Ethereum to put data on chain. And what EIP four, eight four or will do will have introduce a really targeted at roll ups, a cheaper path to put data on chain and lots of different estimates out there. But I don't want to get into that because I'm not entirely sure myself of which is correct and how much cheaper it will be.
00:59:24.296 - 00:59:45.344, Speaker C: But it's fair to say it'll be many times cheaper and significantly reduce the cost of using roll ups and really make Ethereum even more competitive with other chains. You have the security, you have decentralization, you have the scalability that comes from layer two, but now we're talking about scalability that comes from layer one and these two working together will really make the fees even lower.
00:59:45.542 - 00:59:47.760, Speaker A: Harry, how about you? What excites.
00:59:50.260 - 01:01:02.330, Speaker E: You know, in a lot of know certainly just like the unknown of what will the future. I don't think the future has ever felt more kind of just unknown which after four years now of kind of being in the company position and kind of stewarding the chain ourselves, it's kind of like really a great feeling to sort of not be in that position anymore. I think certainly, like Steven said, 4844 is very exciting. I think for me, probably the thing I would list as most exciting is basically the kind of prospect of kind of finding a path to hit stage two of that decentralization roadmap. I think getting to stage one, I think, was a lot harder than getting to stage two. I think the general feeling is that sort of getting to stage two is a very feasible thing with some technical challenges but very much something that is kind of very possible. And sort of getting to that would obviously mean kind of actually making good when sort of ethereum kind of created this image of a roll up centric future.
01:01:02.330 - 01:01:14.060, Speaker E: I view that it has almost created a debt that the roll up protocols owed to be worth being that future and kind of getting to stage two would be making good on that promise.
01:01:15.520 - 01:01:24.530, Speaker B: Guys, I'm sad because this is the last time in this episode that anyone will have ever asked you when token? You'll never hear that again.
01:01:26.340 - 01:01:32.630, Speaker C: The Twitter replies, usually I can't tweet without a billion of when tokens. And now they've all gone away.
01:01:35.720 - 01:01:37.104, Speaker E: Or dinner. What was it, Steven?
01:01:37.152 - 01:01:40.308, Speaker C: Dinner. Oh, the main course.
01:01:40.474 - 01:01:41.670, Speaker E: The main course.
01:01:43.240 - 01:01:51.816, Speaker B: Oh, guys. Well, congratulations for getting all the way to this point. And thank you for being pioneers as the frontier and taking so many of us along with you.
01:01:51.998 - 01:01:53.832, Speaker C: Thank you for having us, as always.
01:01:53.966 - 01:02:09.656, Speaker A: Thanks for having us. Nation, you can go check your eligibility for the ARB token at Arbitrum Foundation. We'll include a link in the show notes. As always, risks and disclaimers. None of this has been financial advice. ETH is risky, so is crypto. So are layer twos.
01:02:09.656 - 01:02:18.444, Speaker A: Like arbitram. All of DFI is. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.
01:02:18.444 - 01:02:19.756, Speaker A: Thanks a lot, Ryan.
01:02:19.788 - 01:02:21.360, Speaker B: They're all asking for it, man.
01:02:21.510 - 01:02:28.724, Speaker A: Wait, did we get 248? Nine likes? I think we need one more, like before this.
01:02:28.762 - 01:02:31.412, Speaker B: Oh, it's coming in. Oh, they're liking it right now.
01:02:31.466 - 01:02:32.596, Speaker A: I don't see it.
01:02:32.778 - 01:02:33.476, Speaker B: They want it.
01:02:33.498 - 01:02:34.836, Speaker A: Given the official signature, I'm not only.
01:02:34.858 - 01:02:38.704, Speaker B: Am I watching the YouTube chat, but I'm also watching the small brains discord.
01:02:38.752 - 01:02:44.790, Speaker A: How did you say it? How do you say? All right, let's do it together. One, two, three.
01:02:45.200 - 01:02:48.650, Speaker C: E close.
