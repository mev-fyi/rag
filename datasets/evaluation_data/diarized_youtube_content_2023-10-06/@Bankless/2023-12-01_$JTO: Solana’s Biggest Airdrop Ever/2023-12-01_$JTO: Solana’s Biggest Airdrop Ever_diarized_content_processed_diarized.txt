00:00:00.250 - 00:00:19.950, Speaker A: The Solana community is getting an airdrop, and it looks to be absolutely massive. Jito is launching a governance token. It's called GTO. David, can you give us a recap of what Jito even is? For folks that are unfamiliar? Bankless station. It's time for your Friday weekly roll up. David, what are we talking about this week?
00:00:20.020 - 00:00:31.734, Speaker B: All of the news across all of the chains, Ryan, it's non Ethereum airdrop week. This week, Solana is getting a token, perhaps one of its biggest cosmos. Adam getting a new token as well. What else is going on?
00:00:31.772 - 00:00:45.386, Speaker A: We got Kyber. They got hacked. This is one of Defi's oldest protocols, so it's not good news, David. But you know the craziest thing? I don't know. Did you read the message from the Kyber hacker? It is pretty unhinged. It is completely unhinged. So we got to talk about that.
00:00:45.386 - 00:00:45.930, Speaker A: What else?
00:00:46.000 - 00:01:06.030, Speaker B: Some chains are getting some upgrades, lots of more TPS coming into the fold, say a layer one is getting an upgrade, a move. Layer two is coming to Ethereum, a new flavor of L2 on Ethereum, and also a large Ethereum validator is starting to play shenanigans with the blockchain. I'll tell you this story. I think it's pretty cool.
00:01:06.100 - 00:01:29.490, Speaker A: And speaking of shenanigans, we got to give him an update on CZ. What's he doing this week? Is he still in the US? Is he somewhere else? And while we're talking about locations, where in the world is Richard Hart? That's what the SEC really wants to know right now. And if you're listening to this, wherever you're listening, make sure you give us a review. A like. If you rate it, subscribe. If you're checking this out on YouTube.
00:01:29.570 - 00:01:36.550, Speaker B: David, you know, Spotify wrapped season one of the best seasons to be a podcaster, I would say, is when you get all the appreciation.
00:01:36.710 - 00:01:44.090, Speaker A: Well, I saw somebody, I think the biggest Spotify wrapped bankless listener moment, like minutes was something. 14,000 minutes.
00:01:44.160 - 00:01:55.146, Speaker B: 14,000 minutes. Yeah. So if you are on listening to this on Spotify, and you have more than 14,000 minutes on listening to bankless tweet at us, we will send you some swag. We'll send you something, David.
00:01:55.258 - 00:02:01.378, Speaker A: I did the numbers on that. 14,000 divided by 60 is something like 233. 233 hours.
00:02:01.464 - 00:02:02.994, Speaker B: 233 hours.
00:02:03.192 - 00:02:05.414, Speaker A: Is that crazy or what have we done that many?
00:02:05.452 - 00:02:12.200, Speaker B: Podcasts have ten days? I think that's how math works. Ten days. Ten days of our voice. Wow. I'm sorry.
00:02:14.490 - 00:02:21.138, Speaker A: But also thank you. I'm humbled and honored to have so many people listen to this podcast. We do it for you.
00:02:21.244 - 00:02:21.786, Speaker B: Do it for you.
00:02:21.808 - 00:02:32.202, Speaker A: We do it for you guys. We do it for you guys. Okay, David, speaking of things that we do for people, our friends and sponsors over at near, this is super cool.
00:02:32.336 - 00:02:58.926, Speaker B: We had a Twitter space with ilya from near where we got to ask a little bit more about this data availability layer. Yeah, tell me about it. You want to share screen. So the way we've been expressing this, like, oh, near data availability, near is a layer one. It is also supplying data availability to ethereum L2 s, which is exactly what's happening. There's just like a bunch of second order, very positive second order effects that come with this. And that is cross chain composability for Ethereum L2s.
00:02:58.926 - 00:03:31.774, Speaker B: They've also been working with Eigen layer for fast finality. And Ryan, I've been talking to you about this. I'm like on a quest to understand how Ethereum rollups become recomposed. Like eventually we need Ethereum to become invisible. And that means whether your assets are on optimism or arbitrum or future chains, all of that needs to be abstracted away. How does that happen? What is the mechanism for doing that? One of the silver bullets for getting that done is like low latency finality, which is how chains can talk to each other. This near DA, along with their partnership with Eigen Layer, is helping achieve some of that.
00:03:31.774 - 00:03:46.734, Speaker B: And so this is one of the reasons why I'm really excited about what Nier has been up to. They announced this about like two weeks ago. Anyways, there is a link in the show notes that is bankless Cc slash Nier. If you want to learn more about Nier's data availability solution and how they are bringing cross chain composability to Ethereum.
00:03:46.862 - 00:03:54.182, Speaker A: And thanks to NIr for getting this message out to the bankless nation. David, let's talk about prices. You ready for this? Yeah.
00:03:54.236 - 00:04:11.334, Speaker B: So the prices have just up all month. When you measure it for the last seven days, it's actually just flat. But that's like measurement error. Bitcoin is up 1% on the week. 37,300 where it started. 37,700 is where we're ending ether price. Also relatively fat flat.
00:04:11.334 - 00:04:12.698, Speaker B: 2030 to start.
00:04:12.784 - 00:04:13.322, Speaker A: That works.
00:04:13.376 - 00:04:24.910, Speaker B: Yeah, 2030 to end. Pretty flat in the week. And then the ETH BTC ratio, also pretty flat on the week. And also no major big movers of the week. I mean, like Iota had a big pump, but honestly, who cares?
00:04:26.370 - 00:04:44.310, Speaker A: What do you think of December? Do you think December is going to be good to us? I remember some December's in crypto have been very bleak, and it felt like coal in my stockings. December 2019 may have been this. However, December 2020 was not bleach huge. It was very happy.
00:04:44.460 - 00:05:04.226, Speaker B: That was the month in which we had, like, six months of why do you need ETH? You just buy bitcoin and DfI tokens after DFI summer. And that was the month. I remember we were talking about this, actually, and we were talking about this take on the weekly roll up, and you're like, what do you think about that take? And I'm like, well, it really just takes one strong week of price movement in ether.
00:05:04.278 - 00:05:08.302, Speaker A: Wait, you're saying we were talking about this in 2020? You remember an episode from 2020?
00:05:08.356 - 00:05:09.200, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:05:10.130 - 00:05:12.062, Speaker A: That feels like decades ago, right?
00:05:12.116 - 00:05:44.786, Speaker B: So we were talking about that thesis. And what do you think about thesis about the barbell of no ether, just bitcoin and DFI tokens. And I was like, yeah, sure. That's like the narrative that's in vogue in the moment because that's what the price action has been. But all that, really, that could just be very quickly invalidated by a massive ETH run. And then literally the next week, ether broke out of its three year bear market range and broke through to $425, which hadn't broke through in forever. And then it ran to, like, $700, and the narrative just completely flipped.
00:05:44.818 - 00:05:48.146, Speaker A: And then. Wait, was that 2020 or did that happen in 2019?
00:05:48.258 - 00:06:08.690, Speaker B: No, that's 2020. That was December of 2020. Because by the January of 2021, ether had broken is like $1,100 in the first week. I remember this very, very well. It was like one, $100 in the first week, and we were on our way to $2,000. And the whole Barbell idea looked super cringe in hindsight. And it was when ultrasound money really became a huge thing.
00:06:08.840 - 00:06:11.758, Speaker A: Yeah, good times, David.
00:06:11.854 - 00:06:12.626, Speaker B: Good times.
00:06:12.728 - 00:06:22.054, Speaker A: We'll see if Santa Claus is coming town this month. I'm hoping for good things. I think we've got a fantastic set up. We'll finish this out. Tell us, what's the cryptocurrency market cap?
00:06:22.172 - 00:06:28.374, Speaker B: 1.48 trillion. We are narrowing in on a one and a half trillion dollars in market cap, but we're not there.
00:06:28.492 - 00:06:48.426, Speaker A: Do you want to give us some perspective on all of this? So when you say stuff like $1.5 trillion. Right, that sounds like a very large number. But here's a tweet giving some context on the size of the entire crypto industry relative to another asset that probably many of us know. What's this tweet?
00:06:48.458 - 00:07:20.040, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is a tweet from a chameleonaire works at serotonin. A dear friend of mine. She tweets out daily reminder that the entire crypto industry is still a small boy by market cap. At our peak in autumn of 2021, at the peak of the bull market of last cycle, we were equivalent. The whole industry was equivalent to the market cap of Apple, not a small company. But it's insane to think that an industry about crypto networks that's disrupting money and finance itself is equivalent to an equity. We're still small.
00:07:21.130 - 00:07:32.846, Speaker A: You remember when you asked me what my prediction was for the cycle for the market cap? I'm still going to stick with it. Do you remember what I said? 12 trillion on the low side. Twelve to 15 trillion was my number, yeah.
00:07:32.868 - 00:07:34.686, Speaker B: Okay, so we got a ten x in market cap ahead of us.
00:07:34.708 - 00:07:35.598, Speaker A: What's your number?
00:07:35.764 - 00:07:36.990, Speaker B: Oh, gosh.
00:07:39.570 - 00:07:40.234, Speaker A: You can't.
00:07:40.282 - 00:07:42.000, Speaker B: I'm going with ten.
00:07:44.130 - 00:07:48.218, Speaker A: Your gas. I'm breaks, but gas is under my prediction.
00:07:48.314 - 00:07:52.606, Speaker B: If you do, the whole log curve, like cycles are always smaller. Cycles are always smaller.
00:07:52.638 - 00:07:52.786, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:52.808 - 00:07:54.450, Speaker B: And we have higher interest rates now.
00:07:54.600 - 00:07:59.794, Speaker A: All right, you might be right. Are you counting, though? Are you counting, like, stablecoins, real world assets?
00:07:59.842 - 00:08:05.000, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm counting treasure number that is reported by Coingecko in that banner that it reports it in.
00:08:05.770 - 00:08:26.522, Speaker A: Fair enough. We will see either way. Pretty bullish. And speaking of bulls, can you get any more bullish on a particular asset than Michael freaking Saylor, who just put in another acquisition of a cool 16,000 bitcoin? If you're curious, I could do the math for you. That's about $600 million. Shut up.
00:08:26.576 - 00:08:27.898, Speaker B: Worth of bitcoin.
00:08:28.074 - 00:08:29.200, Speaker A: Get out of here.
00:08:29.570 - 00:08:30.846, Speaker B: Well, I'm doing the math for them.
00:08:30.868 - 00:08:45.298, Speaker A: I didn't say I was doing the math myself. At an average price of 36,000 per bitcoin. So there he is. He's just continuing with that dollar cost averaging in strategy. But these numbers are huge, David, huge 600.
00:08:45.384 - 00:08:47.714, Speaker B: Huge million. Where does he get the number from?
00:08:47.832 - 00:08:48.114, Speaker A: A.
00:08:48.152 - 00:09:36.574, Speaker B: First off, congrats on Michael Siler for first having one of the first major purchases of bitcoin, where the reported average price of bitcoin is significantly under the actual current price. Usually it was the inverse. Where does he get all this money from? Where does he just start pulling $600 million out of his pockets? Well, okay, so the answer is leverage. It's leverage. And so when bitcoin goes up in price, microstrategy stock, MSTr, it's basically a bitcoin ETF in a roundabout way, because it's a software company. It sells software, but really, it's just about exposure to bitcoin. So when bitcoin pumps and pumps up to $38,000, all of a sudden, microstrategy trades at a much larger premium, goes up in price, and all of a sudden, he can borrow against it to buy more bitcoin.
00:09:36.574 - 00:09:38.302, Speaker B: So he's just taking, like, he's just winding.
00:09:38.446 - 00:09:46.034, Speaker A: Why don't we do that? We got a little media company. We'll go public. We'll have bankless as a publicly traded asset. We'll just buy a dollar cost, average.
00:09:46.082 - 00:09:53.046, Speaker B: Every single week into ether and just announce it. Yeah, we'll start small, but we'll just wind our way up and wind up.
00:09:53.068 - 00:09:54.114, Speaker A: Big and take some debt.
00:09:54.162 - 00:09:57.442, Speaker B: Just free money, right? We're just printing money, right? And there's no risk, honestly.
00:09:57.506 - 00:10:16.082, Speaker A: It's a fantastic business model. I think a so long as bitcoin continues to go up. But we've already given our takes on that. We think it will. But did you see this tweet, dude? Actually, I know you did, because you sent this to me. Icebergy given a take on what sailor is doing. Because I don't know if you looked at sailor's Twitter feed recently, but stuff like this.
00:10:16.136 - 00:10:27.558, Speaker B: Yeah, he just types mid journey. He goes into mid journey and goes like, imagine, which is how you prompt mid journey. It's like, imagine bitcoin to the moon. And then he just posts it and.
00:10:27.564 - 00:10:28.802, Speaker A: Gets bitcoin to the mountain.
00:10:28.866 - 00:10:33.640, Speaker B: Gets, like, 10,000 likes on Twitter. Just like these stupid AI generation things.
00:10:34.250 - 00:10:38.066, Speaker A: Look at this. Show me a picture of America. Eagle.
00:10:38.178 - 00:10:40.470, Speaker B: An american eagle with some bitcoin.
00:10:41.290 - 00:10:53.870, Speaker A: And that's what you get. And he just pumps them. And these tweets do so well. David, look at this. Oh, well, almost 10,000 likes for this just robot mid journey thing, I'll be honest. Low effort. Mid journey artwork.
00:10:53.870 - 00:10:59.050, Speaker A: What's the type from iceberg?
00:10:59.130 - 00:11:11.634, Speaker B: Just tweets out. Taylor starts t whopping half a yard on coinbase, does a line, then immediately goes to mid journey and types, imagine bitcoin to the moon. 4 hours. 4 hours.
00:11:11.752 - 00:11:14.626, Speaker A: I don't know if that's what he's doing, but I do picture that in my head.
00:11:14.728 - 00:11:28.120, Speaker B: I mean, bro, you remember the super unhinged clip we played, like, two weeks ago? How many chairs are you sitting on right now? When people's like, why don't you diversify out of bitcoin? And he goes like, well, how many chairs are you sitting on?
00:11:28.570 - 00:11:29.426, Speaker A: Sitting on one chair.
00:11:29.458 - 00:11:31.130, Speaker B: You're sitting on one chair. Like, there's only one.
00:11:31.200 - 00:11:40.266, Speaker A: Are you sitting on ten? I love it. All right, GBTC, give me an update on this record lows discount. What are you talking about?
00:11:40.288 - 00:11:50.686, Speaker B: Yeah, record lows for discount. So in June, the discount was like negative 40 of this year for bitcoin. The bitcoin spot discount for GBTC now at just 8.6%.
00:11:50.868 - 00:11:59.780, Speaker A: That's closing. And what was our prediction? That that will continue to close, and once it does, what will spill over into the spot price? Yeah.
00:12:00.150 - 00:12:12.482, Speaker B: As it approaches closing, people are just more likely to buy spot in the first place because the incentive is lessened. So as we are approaching zero, just all of that demand is going into spot, which is bullish.
00:12:12.626 - 00:12:22.086, Speaker A: You know, what's after December, David, is January. That's how in January, I was promised a bitcoin spot ETF by Mr. James Sefert.
00:12:22.118 - 00:12:28.346, Speaker B: Well, that's what I'm going to go do when I go climb my mountains in the first week of January, so.
00:12:28.368 - 00:12:31.830, Speaker A: Okay, you're climbing mountains in January? The first two weeks of January.
00:12:31.910 - 00:12:32.962, Speaker B: 1 week of January.
00:12:33.046 - 00:12:42.750, Speaker A: Okay. So it's very likely, bankless nation, that Gary Gensler is going to take a massive l and have to give us bitcoin spot ETF while David's in the mountains.
00:12:44.530 - 00:12:50.210, Speaker B: I got to go to the mountains because that's where he has the Horcrux. The bitcoin ETF Horcrux. I have to go smash.
00:12:51.030 - 00:13:07.238, Speaker A: This is a down. Bad story, David. And these numbers are pretty stark. This is from Kumar. Openc revenue, January 2022. Speaking of January, that was not too long ago. Their revenue was 387,000,000.
00:13:07.238 - 00:13:26.842, Speaker A: That's monthly revenue for OpenC. Top of the NFT cycle, January 2022. You know what it is today? I know you do because you're looking at it. But bankless Lister, imagine you go from 387,000,000 to now, last month, 1.9 million. Wow, that's a big drop, David.
00:13:26.906 - 00:13:32.910, Speaker B: Well, hey, like, $1.9 million a month is a lot of money. I don't want to believe all that. That's still a lot.
00:13:32.980 - 00:13:35.102, Speaker A: That's a lot of money. It's just like, just a lot less.
00:13:35.156 - 00:13:53.830, Speaker B: Came down so hard. Okay, so why did this happen? Well, a, the NFT market just dried up, obviously. Easy come, easy go. NFT is totally not dead. They'll be around forever. Of course, it's just like, that was the first mania, and so that was them selling picks and shovels of a tulip mania. Right.
00:13:53.830 - 00:14:11.914, Speaker B: And so they were making all their revenue then. And so actual demand for NFTs have dropped off, but then also OpeNC has been disrupted by blurt. And so their market share back then was like 90 plus percent, and now it's only like 35%. So the revenue from the industry has disappeared and they're also taking only a third of it.
00:14:11.952 - 00:14:42.582, Speaker A: So between those two things, they're doing fine at 2 million a month. That's fantastic. That would be a fantastic business. What's difficult about crypto is this whipsaw and bankless listener, you know, because you hold these whipsawing assets and the volatility of them. But if you're an entrepreneur, if you're a project trying to start this, you see 400 million in revenue and you're like, hey, even if that goes down 80%, we can hire another 100 people, 200 people. There's market demand for this, it's growing, and then you get the other side.
00:14:42.636 - 00:14:46.422, Speaker B: When all of this crashes, doesn't go down 80%, it goes down 98%.
00:14:46.556 - 00:15:07.598, Speaker A: It's difficult to ride out these markets. So that's why the key thing to do in crypto, whether you're running a project or whether you're an entrepreneur, whether you're a startup or whether you're a lowly holder, is just to hang on for the ride, don't get liquidated. That's the key to survival, as we say so often.
00:15:07.764 - 00:15:16.100, Speaker B: I did just do the math just now. Well, yeah, I'm bad at math, so I don't know if I did it right, but 387,000,000 down to 1.9 million is 98%.
00:15:16.870 - 00:15:24.370, Speaker A: I mean, that's what a lot of assets got. A 98% hit, too. David, what do we got coming up next?
00:15:24.440 - 00:15:54.266, Speaker B: Coming up next, a bunch of news. We're going to start with the jeto airdrop and its governance token on Salana. I think Salana is by far biggest airdrop of a very esteemed protocol. And also Cosmos Hub is having a civil war. It's entering its. You remember the block size wars of bitcoin? I think that's what's going on with Cosmos Hub. So an airdrop, what does that mean for a chain split for atom holders? We're going to talk about that, but first, a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible, especially Kraken, our preferred exchange for crypto in 2023 and 2024.

Whether you are a developer, an enterprise, or a user, arbitrum orbit lets you take your project to new heights. All of these technologies leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum experience. Web three development the way it was always meant to be. Secure, fast, cheap, and friction free. Visit Arbitrum IO and get your journey started in one of the largest Ethereum communities.
00:18:32.130 - 00:18:45.550, Speaker A: The Salana community is getting an airdrop, and it looks to be absolutely massive. Jeto is launching a governance token. It's called GTO. David, can you give us a recap of what Jito even is? For folks that are unfamiliar?
00:18:45.630 - 00:19:12.790, Speaker B: Jito is a project on a solana that is one of these app layer projects that actually has to do with the Solana chain itself. So it's like these app infra projects. Jito Sol is like the staked ETH version. So Lido, we have staked ETH on Ethereum, Jito Sol on Solana. But it's not just that. It's also Mev extraction as well. So you can run the Jedo client to get the MeV trading done, like inbuilt, kind of like the block proposer system of Ethereum.
00:19:12.790 - 00:19:24.138, Speaker B: And so it combines MeV extraction plus the staked Sol, and then it combines that in together to optimize your soul yield. And this is called the Jito network. The Jito client.
00:19:24.314 - 00:19:38.606, Speaker A: All right, so it's like when you said Mev boost, that is a product from flashbots that basically helps to create a marketplace for all of the MeV buying and selling on top of Ethereum. And Jito does something similar for Solana.
00:19:38.638 - 00:19:52.422, Speaker B: It democratizes access to Mev rewards. So instead of actually giving it to the most of it to MeV extractors, it gives it to people who just run the clients. And Jito now puts it into the. And it's spreading out Mev capture on Solana.
00:19:52.486 - 00:19:59.626, Speaker A: So it's that. And plus it's also lido, as you said, for so.
00:19:59.648 - 00:20:06.238, Speaker B: So you can imagine why the Solana community is very stoked about this. It's like a very deep integration with the Solana system itself.
00:20:06.404 - 00:20:10.558, Speaker A: And how deep is the airdrop? Does it go to everybody or who gets this?
00:20:10.644 - 00:20:34.678, Speaker B: Yeah, so probably some more granular distributions into internal jeto community members. But really, the big one is if you are a holder of the Jeet soul token, which is like the staked ETH or our ETH of Ethereum, but for salana, if you hold Jeto soul because you're getting the yield of Salana in judo soul, then you're getting airdropped. That's probably the big one. There's other ones as well. 10% of the total supply is being airdropped to its community members.
00:20:34.844 - 00:20:46.140, Speaker A: Fun fact for you, David. The ETH maximalists over at bankless. Bankless, right. They've got an airdrop hunter, and they actually predicted Jito, and they predicted the drop of.
00:20:46.990 - 00:20:51.286, Speaker B: So wait, so people using the ETH Maxi product got the Solana airdrop?
00:20:51.318 - 00:20:51.770, Speaker A: That's right.
00:20:51.840 - 00:20:52.086, Speaker B: Wow.
00:20:52.128 - 00:21:13.474, Speaker A: Bankless.com slash airdrop hunter. And you would have known about that in advance, David. Fortunately, I didn't, because I didn't actually take the time to use this fully. David, let's talk a little bit about cosmos. So we talked about Solana and their airdrop, but we also said that the cosmos community is getting some sort of a new token. Tell me about this.
00:21:13.474 - 00:21:17.314, Speaker A: I used to be pretty active in the cosmos community back in the day. Yeah.
00:21:17.352 - 00:21:38.966, Speaker B: So Cosmos is entering its block size wars era. Block size wars is this era in bitcoin, in which there was the civil war between the big blockers and the small blockers, and it fractured into bitcoin and bitcoin cash. It was the largest split of bitcoin ever. And bitcoin cash was, like, decently relevant for a while, and it's just, like, slowly faded off into irrelevant.
00:21:38.998 - 00:21:57.198, Speaker A: Can I ask you something about this? So when you say the block size wars, it wasn't just about the size of blocks, was it? It was about something a bit more fundamental in terms of what bitcoin was supposed to be. Was it supposed to be this store of value asset, or was it supposed to be this kind of payment network?
00:21:57.294 - 00:21:58.034, Speaker B: That's exactly right.
00:21:58.072 - 00:22:05.426, Speaker A: Yeah. Is Cosmos actually having a war of block size, or is it about some fundamental philosophical divide here?
00:22:05.448 - 00:22:30.762, Speaker B: It's a philosophical divide. It's not about the size of blocks on the atom chain, but it is about what is the identity of the cosmos hub, the atom token. And so it's like kind of the fractal equivalent. Right? And so it's not about the size of blocks. It is about the moneyness conversation, though. So the block size wars for bitcoin was like, well, small blockers are like, bitcoin is a store of value. And big blockers are like, bitcoin is a payments network store of value.
00:22:30.762 - 00:23:00.854, Speaker B: People won. Payment networks is bitcoin cash. That's completely relevant. Now, Cosmos is entering a similar phase in which the token of atom is like, what is the purpose of atom? Is it meant to secure cosmos? Or is it the money of cosmos? And this is the divide that is happening right now in Cosmos. And unlike bitcoin, there is a on chain voting for cosmos. So we actually get to see these votes show up and take place. And that vote did take place.
00:23:00.854 - 00:23:40.546, Speaker B: And so the question is, is the atom token good collateral for defi, or is it meant to only serve the security of the atom hub? And this was the vote that happened. And this is a question of inflation. How much do we inflate the atom currency? And so this vote went through to cap the inflation of atom at 10%. Right now, it's at about 14 plus percent. And the vote was to lower inflation and to cap it. So it only inflates so much over time. At 10%, that vote went through and passed, and so not by a crazy amount.
00:23:40.546 - 00:23:48.614, Speaker B: There was a clear division in the community. It was 41% supported it, and 32% voted against it.
00:23:48.732 - 00:23:49.734, Speaker A: That's really close.
00:23:49.852 - 00:24:09.850, Speaker B: A clear victory. That shows a very strong division in the community. Right. And 80% of the validators participated. It wasn't like, binary. And so now, adam, the token will be capped at 10%. What does this do? How do we analyze what this means for the atom ecosystem? Here's something that was helpful to analyze this.
00:24:09.850 - 00:24:28.318, Speaker B: People out here are thinking that lower inflation equals less supply equals higher atom price, and they are voting yes. The other camp is saying lower inflation doesn't affect price and are voting no. Meanwhile, traders big and small are like, oh, yield is going down. Maybe I should move Adam into DeFi.
00:24:28.414 - 00:24:28.782, Speaker A: Adam.
00:24:28.846 - 00:24:44.146, Speaker B: Liquidity goes up. Adam. DeFi strategies become more reliable, and DeFi protocols start earning more revenue. Basically, lowering inflation takes away Adam from staking and incentivizes it to be more productive in DeFi because they are lowering the productivity of atom as a staking.
00:24:44.178 - 00:24:46.870, Speaker A: Asset, because yields are coming more like money.
00:24:46.940 - 00:24:48.498, Speaker B: It's becoming more like collateral.
00:24:48.594 - 00:25:12.110, Speaker A: Like, ethereum has gone through this. Remember, minimum viable issuance, right? Decreasing the issuance all the time until we kind of put a permanent monetary policy in place that is based on demand for block space and the amount of staking and turned ether into a much more monetary type of unit that accrues value. And a similar type of conversation is happening in Cosmos, right?
00:25:12.180 - 00:25:33.458, Speaker B: That's exactly right. Jay Kwan, who is the founder, one of the main core founders of Cosmos, wrote the tendermint white paper, like built IBC. He is not pleased. So this is like the Satoshi, if you will, the original inceptor of Cosmos, the guy. And is like, I don't agree with this vote.
00:25:33.554 - 00:25:44.378, Speaker A: And my understanding, too, David, is he's been kind of checked out of the cosmos community for the last couple of years. He's been kind of on the periphery, not as actively involved. So that's some other context going into this, I believe. Sure.
00:25:44.464 - 00:26:26.454, Speaker B: So Jaequan says despite the vote passing, which is something not too surprising, it would be good to know whether the later votes came from newly purchased Adams or not. Now let's coordinate a split, he says. He's like, wow, yo, that's great for you guys. You guys, do you. I'm forking. And so Jaequan is going to fork Adam, and now there's going to be atom one. Like atom number one, as in, they're going to make a new atom cosmos hub, and it's going to be the one that doesn't support atom as money and instead optimizes for chain security by issuing high yields, high inflation for atom holders who stake, which is how you get high security.
00:26:26.572 - 00:26:28.406, Speaker A: I don't understand how that gives you.
00:26:28.428 - 00:26:33.926, Speaker B: High security, though, because it incentivizes all the atom to stake to the atom hub.
00:26:33.958 - 00:26:38.410, Speaker A: Yeah, but if the value of your atom is lower, then the economic security is lower.
00:26:38.480 - 00:26:40.830, Speaker B: And that's why we are ETH Maxis brother.
00:26:42.930 - 00:27:19.206, Speaker A: I mean, this is an argument we've had for a long time, many times. Bitcoin did this, ethereum certainly did this. And the core argument was, if you are a layer one and you're trying to optimize for security money, then what you have to do is also, if you want to fully optimize for security, you have to fully optimize to have your layer one assets be a monetary instrument and be a money. Actually, that's one of the things that kind of pulled me away from the cosmos community is I was just like, I don't understand how atoms accrue value in this world because you all keep.
00:27:19.228 - 00:27:22.458, Speaker B: On inflating it into infinity. Inflating it 14% a year, bro.
00:27:22.544 - 00:27:48.770, Speaker A: Well, the answer was always, it's not money, it's something else. And what is moneyness really, anyway? And if we need money, we'll just import bitcoin into our system. And if you do that, you won't have economic security to actually support all of the things that you. It was just a circular argument. And it sounds like now the debate is being settled the crypto way, which is fork choice, you get to decide. So I haven't seen a good old fashioned fork in a very long time. David, remind me what happened.
00:27:48.770 - 00:27:53.138, Speaker A: All right, I have some atom tokens back to our. Do I get Adam one?
00:27:53.224 - 00:28:07.080, Speaker B: You get Adam one. If you are an atom token holder, your blockchain is just going to split in two. The historical state will be copied, and then you will have both Adam and adam one. It should be called adam two. But I get it.
00:28:08.830 - 00:28:10.182, Speaker A: It's adam classic.
00:28:10.326 - 00:28:20.570, Speaker B: Classic, yeah. Jay's vision. Yeah. If this fork does happen, you'll have atoms on both chains, and one will have more value than the other. And one.
00:28:20.640 - 00:28:21.606, Speaker A: The market will decide.
00:28:21.718 - 00:28:32.954, Speaker B: The market will decide. And one will likely pro. Jay. I love the philosophy, man, but you're going to lose to money. Like, capital begets capital. Liquidity begets liquidity. Governance begets governance.
00:28:32.954 - 00:28:34.110, Speaker B: Like, you're going to lose.
00:28:34.770 - 00:29:00.874, Speaker A: I just feel like we've seen this experiment play out with for enough. Yeah, but who knows? Maybe this time it's a little bit different and the cosmos community, to be fair, is a little bit different than other communities. So I don't know, but I'm pretty excited about getting those fork tokens with my atom one. And I can't wait to hit sell because it's not money. Sorry, Jay. I mean, bankless listener, you do whatever.
00:29:00.912 - 00:29:15.260, Speaker B: You know, our stance on this whole thing, when do our thesis just become just like, if this plays out the way that the bankless thesis about money and layer ones plays out, I declare that it is no longer a thesis and it's just.
00:29:15.630 - 00:29:29.506, Speaker A: No, no. We're going to retest that every single cycle for infinity. Infinity cycle. We got to retest all our assumptions. Okay, this last thing, remember we talked about learning.
00:29:29.608 - 00:29:29.874, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:29.912 - 00:29:37.310, Speaker A: Speaking about learning lessons, what was the learning lesson for paradigm? We talked about this new L2 that had some pyramid.
00:29:37.390 - 00:29:38.978, Speaker B: Not L2. It's not a layer.
00:29:38.994 - 00:29:51.834, Speaker A: Oh, it's not a L2. This multi sig calling itself a L2 called blast, which was basically pyramid scheming. The whole thing. Like, I'll use this term, ponzifying incentives. Yes, incentives. Right.
00:29:51.872 - 00:29:53.050, Speaker B: Incentive ponzies. Yeah.
00:29:53.120 - 00:30:04.654, Speaker A: Not necessarily bad, not necessarily good. I'm personally neutral on that. It's a growth mechanic. You have to understand that it comes with risk and all sorts of things and easily up, easily down.
00:30:04.852 - 00:30:28.146, Speaker B: It doesn't really come with risk because you're depositing your assets in. And then other people get rewarded more if they referred you in the issuance of new blast tokens, rather than just paying new incoming money being paid to support old money. That's a true ponzi. No one's ether is being redistributed. It's just the ponzi. Incentives of blast tokens are the ponzi.
00:30:28.178 - 00:30:49.386, Speaker A: What I mean is risk to the ecosystem in that. It's cocaine, man. It's a sugar rush. And so you shoot all the way up, and you know what's going to happen? It's going to come crashing down at some point in time, because it's not. Anyway, that aside, the bigger issue we talked about last week was it's not actually a L2. It's a multi sig of some sort.
00:30:49.488 - 00:30:52.486, Speaker B: Even worse, it's a one way multi sig. You can't withdraw.
00:30:52.598 - 00:31:01.006, Speaker A: And so, David, we are on a dune analytics board, and I am seeing some numbers here that are very big. How much value is actually locked in.
00:31:01.028 - 00:31:05.902, Speaker B: Blast at this point, $620,000,000 has been deposited to blast.
00:31:05.966 - 00:31:08.674, Speaker A: Is that product market fit on a.
00:31:08.712 - 00:31:21.346, Speaker B: Three of five one way multi sig? That's not a L2. And they're being advertised as a L2. And so at this point, it's just like, why do L2s go do these engineering challenges?
00:31:21.378 - 00:31:22.310, Speaker A: Why do we do the hard stuff?
00:31:22.380 - 00:31:37.546, Speaker B: Bytecode, EVM equivalents and distributed sequencers. Why are we doing the hard stuff? You're getting $600 million for being a three or five multi SIG that you can't withdraw from. Is this an insult to all the actual hard engineering teams out there?
00:31:37.728 - 00:31:43.342, Speaker A: Anyway, my take is it's just a shortcut. But anyway, a lot of money has piled into this. Right?
00:31:43.476 - 00:31:47.550, Speaker B: For comparison, that is the equivalent of the entire TVL of Solana.
00:31:48.690 - 00:31:49.246, Speaker A: What?
00:31:49.348 - 00:31:50.094, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:50.292 - 00:31:53.710, Speaker A: They did the entire TVL of Solana in, like, a week.
00:31:53.780 - 00:31:55.326, Speaker B: Yeah. A couple weeks, yeah.
00:31:55.508 - 00:31:56.238, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:31:56.324 - 00:31:56.622, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:56.676 - 00:32:03.650, Speaker A: Well, there we go. That's a lot of money that's already been injected in this. And I got to imagine most of this is ETH. Yeah, look at this.
00:32:03.720 - 00:32:05.790, Speaker B: It's Ethan stables. Yeah. But mostly ETH.
00:32:05.870 - 00:32:15.266, Speaker A: Yeah. Ether is just so massive. Okay, so Paradigm has been associated with this project because they're a key investor this project. They were also a key investor in Frontech.
00:32:15.298 - 00:32:15.446, Speaker B: Right?
00:32:15.468 - 00:32:46.158, Speaker A: So they're starting to get this reputation of, like, if you want your token to go up, if you want to experiment with these Ponzi economics, paradigm's the name, right? And so, like, Paradigm plus new project equals number go up, token. Go up, TVL go up. Paradigm, it looks like, is trying to distance itself maybe a little bit from that. And we've had Dan Robinson on before. We think very highly of many of the folks at Paradigm and many of the research that they. Much of the research that they do and the projects that they support. Georgia, we could go on with.
00:32:46.244 - 00:32:47.870, Speaker B: Couldn't say better words.
00:32:48.020 - 00:32:50.706, Speaker A: Okay, so what is Dan saying here? What's the gist of this? Yeah.
00:32:50.728 - 00:33:14.314, Speaker B: So he goes, there are a lot of components of blast that I'm excited about and would be interested in engaging with people to work on. That said, we at Paradigm think that the announcement this week crossed lines in both messaging and execution. What we don't agree with is the decision to launch the bridge before the L2. So you launch the deposit contract before the network exists and then also not allow withdrawals for three months since we.
00:33:14.352 - 00:33:17.446, Speaker A: Oh, I forgot about that. You can't get your money out of, huh?
00:33:17.478 - 00:33:52.754, Speaker B: Right. Dan says it sets a bad precedent for other projects. Yeah. To draw another lesson out in history, like, why did blockfi go under? Why did genesis go under? Because Alex effing Machinsky was doing an actual ponzi and paying ridiculously high yields. And so all of the legitimate competition had to be dragged into the cesspool of fraud and illegitimacy because of one player who was playing unfairly. And so this is what Dan is saying is like, it's a bad precedent. They're incentivizing deposits.
00:33:52.754 - 00:34:00.498, Speaker B: The network's not live. It's a one way multi sig. It's a bad precedent. Don't encourage this behavior. So I'm pretty proud of Dan for making this statement.
00:34:00.594 - 00:34:35.922, Speaker A: Even if blast isn't doing this right, the bad precedent is the key language here, because this is like, trust me, bro, security. And we already had that. We had that with all of the crypto banks, and we don't need that again. So even if blast doesn't screw people over, the next project to follow this new, well trodden path, that kind of works from a growth perspective. Totally will and totally could. What else does he say here? Because this is interesting. This is an investor basically throwing some shade at a set of founders that they invested in.
00:34:35.976 - 00:34:39.586, Speaker B: It's a VC publicly, like, denouncing the actions of one of their portfolios.
00:34:39.698 - 00:34:40.082, Speaker A: Typically.
00:34:40.146 - 00:35:08.574, Speaker B: See that generally. That's generally a no no. Which means that this is really egregious, bro. There's also emphasis on Pac man, who is the founder of Blur, who's now also the founder of Blast, who's really been like the guy leading this execution of these strategies, really leaning into the gamification thing. This guy's like 24. He's had this crazy history, like just operator of operators. I think he's gone too far.
00:35:08.574 - 00:35:16.290, Speaker B: I think he should reel in a little bit and become a little bit more tame. We have seen when people go too far in crypto. I don't want him to follow that path.
00:35:17.110 - 00:35:31.090, Speaker A: Yeah, well, that's what the social layer of crypto is telling them. The non existent social layer, I believe. I think paradigm was maybe on the hot seat a little bit more than bankless last week, but it was between paradigm and bankless.
00:35:31.250 - 00:35:37.826, Speaker B: Yeah. You know who else needs to reel it in? Those goddamn bankless guys submitting proposals.
00:35:37.938 - 00:35:47.354, Speaker A: Well, you're welcome, paradigm, for absorbing some of the heat for you guys. We're happy to do that. Anyway, don't want to revisit memory lane. We did a whole episode on this. What do we got coming up next?
00:35:47.472 - 00:36:23.522, Speaker B: Someone is up to some shenanigans with the Ethereum blockchain playing some timing games with blocks being added to the chain. We'll talk about what that means. Also, where in the world is Richard Hart? If you know, the SEC would like, give him a phone number. Yeah, call Gary, because the SEC would like to know exactly where Richard Hart is. And also the Kyber network is exploited for $55 million, and now the exploiter wants to take control of the company. I don't know if it works that way, but apparently he does. We're going to get into all of these stories and more, but first, a moment to talk about these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible, especially Metamask and its new spiffy metamask portfolio.

00:38:19.494 - 00:38:44.562, Speaker B: Vitalik has shared its excitement for the cello L2 on the cello forum. So has Ben Jones from optimism. But why? The cello L2 will bring huge advantages, like a decentralized sequencer, offchain, data availability, and one block finality. What does all that mean? Rock solid security, a trustless bridge to Ethereum, and more. Real world use cases for Ethereum without compromise. And real world adoption is happening. Active addresses on sello have grown over 500% in the last six months.
00:38:44.562 - 00:39:02.730, Speaker B: With the cello L2, gas fees will stay low, and you can even pay for gas using ERC 20 tokens. But cello is a community governed protocol. This means that cello needs you to weigh in and make your voice heard. Join the conversation in the cello forum. Follow@cello.org on twitter and visit sello.org to shape the future of ethereum.
00:39:03.230 - 00:39:06.502, Speaker A: David, you promised us shenanigans. Tell us about the shenanigans.
00:39:06.566 - 00:39:31.374, Speaker B: Oh, I got shenanigans for you. Here's a tweet from Tony, who works at the EF and he says p to p.org announces he is not associated with p to p.org. P to p.org announces that it will call get header later in this slot. These are technical terms trading off chain stability against more MEV profit. This is exactly the centralized behavior that we should not tolerate as long as we as users have the choice about where to stake our assets.
00:39:31.374 - 00:39:35.342, Speaker B: Okay, what is going on? This is something that I'm an ethereum.
00:39:35.486 - 00:39:37.906, Speaker A: I feel like I should know what this tweet means. I have no idea.
00:39:38.008 - 00:40:07.280, Speaker B: Yeah, so this was something that was predicted once as something that is possible to do by this guy Casper, who also works at the EF, as well as a few other people who put this paper together called time is money strategic timing games in proof of stake protocols. Every once in a while I do put on my research hat and open up some research papers. So I read this one. It's actually pretty good. There's a big mathy section that I skipped. But basically if you go down to slide eight, page eight, Ryan, it really shows you went past it.
00:40:08.690 - 00:40:10.638, Speaker A: Am I an ethereum researcher now?
00:40:10.804 - 00:40:19.714, Speaker B: Right there. Cool. Okay, so this is showing. This is the x axis, is that the horizontal axis? The x axis is the flat one.
00:40:19.752 - 00:40:19.954, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:19.992 - 00:40:55.006, Speaker B: And so that's time. And then the y axis is level of ether extraction based off of time. If, Ryan, it is your turn to propose a block. You have 8 seconds, 12 seconds or something, some number of seconds to propose that block before you are late and you get minorly penalized for being late and not proposing a block. Usually people honest behavior. And just like not playing any timing games, when it becomes time to propose block, you just propose it, right? You're collecting the transactions, you put them all together, you get the header of the block, which has all the transactions in it, and then you propose it.
00:40:55.108 - 00:40:57.326, Speaker A: Because I'm an honest validator. That's what I do.
00:40:57.428 - 00:41:13.314, Speaker B: If you wait, you can kind of capture some more MEV and more transactions because you're having inbound transactions, transactions are coming into you. If you wait and delay your proposer, you can kind of steal some MeV from the next guy.
00:41:13.432 - 00:41:14.898, Speaker A: You skim a little bit off the top.
00:41:14.984 - 00:41:33.914, Speaker B: Yeah, right. You're just collecting more transactions that would otherwise have gone to the next guy in the queue. And so you're just taking it from them. And this is a rational economic strategy that these Ef researchers were like, yo, this is possible. We are not observing this yet, but this is possible. And this paper was released like half.
00:41:33.952 - 00:41:36.218, Speaker A: A year ago, and it's happening now.
00:41:36.304 - 00:41:44.186, Speaker B: And now P to P is announcing, proudly announcing that we're going to play some timing games, and we're going to have a higher yield than our competitors.
00:41:44.218 - 00:41:47.502, Speaker A: Is p to p oric, what are they?
00:41:47.636 - 00:41:51.870, Speaker B: They are. You can validate and stake with them. You can go stake with them. Yeah.
00:41:52.020 - 00:41:54.722, Speaker A: Okay. How much ETH stake do they have?
00:41:54.776 - 00:42:09.960, Speaker B: Institutional grade staking solution, $2.5 billion. I'm assuming that is mostly all ETH. Yeah. I think this is Kobe's project, bro. I think Kobe is like one of the founders of this p to p.org. Yeah.
00:42:09.960 - 00:42:15.240, Speaker B: And also another one of the lido founders. I can't remember, Vasili. I can't remember.
00:42:15.610 - 00:42:23.610, Speaker A: But they're able to give their validators, basically the stakers who stake with them, an edge, right. A bit more yield.
00:42:24.750 - 00:42:37.962, Speaker B: It's dangerous to play timing games because if you say you wait to propose your block right up to the edge, and then you have some sort of latency hiccup, then your block doesn't get proposed, and then you get penalized.
00:42:38.026 - 00:42:38.206, Speaker A: Okay.
00:42:38.228 - 00:43:11.160, Speaker B: And so you don't get any money. And so it really benefits people who have better latency and better connectivity, which is why it doesn't really benefit solo stakers. If you are somebody who's like P to P, you can wait the maximum amount of time, which is like 4 seconds, whereas solo stakers risk, can't take that level of risk because they don't have the same connectivity. And so they can only take a few seconds. And so it benefits high connectivity. And then P to P is like, yo, we're going to play timing games, come stake with us because we're going to get more yield. And it's basically just like, yo, we're going to just take the transactions from the next guy and give it to us.
00:43:11.160 - 00:43:16.090, Speaker B: This is generally considered rational but shitty behavior.
00:43:16.750 - 00:43:18.378, Speaker A: It's an MEV problem, basically.
00:43:18.464 - 00:43:19.142, Speaker B: It's an MEV.
00:43:19.206 - 00:43:26.174, Speaker A: I have a take about that, but I almost don't want to get into this whole take. I think we got to save it for our takes episode. Okay.
00:43:26.212 - 00:43:40.814, Speaker B: Yeah, but one little bit more of data. 65 ether per second is the price of time on Ethereum block production. So if you wait 1 second, you on average will obtain zero point 65 more ETH.
00:43:40.942 - 00:44:01.242, Speaker A: Here's the problem with this, right? And the tweet frames it as like, we shouldn't tolerate this, don't do that. It's bad behavior. Right. I agree with all of that. And yet also our protocol has to be hardened against that kind of bad behavior. Again, David and I were just playing at E three searchers, so somebody call the devs. It's not you and I who are going to solve this.
00:44:01.242 - 00:44:34.450, Speaker A: But my take is that we can't use these values like the idea of Ethereum alignment as a crutch because we have to accept that there will be people out there that will cheat, that don't share these types of values. And Ethereum is strongest when it actually harnesses stuff like that, when it harnesses the human greed, when it harnesses the MeV to accomplish its goals. This is why you and I have been in favor of mechanisms like ultrasound money, right? Like the more ETH we burn, the more numbers should go up. Right? More security for everybody. What does?
00:44:34.520 - 00:44:39.638, Speaker B: You take the MEV from the extractors and you give it to the ETH holders. There's a wider pool of people.
00:44:39.724 - 00:45:06.430, Speaker A: Yeah. So give me that greed, all that greed. ETH number go up and then we'll convert that into decentralization. We'll convert that into economic security. Anyway, it's a general observation that I think that it's good to make this visible, but we shouldn't go over the top in the crypto community, in the Ethereum community, and wrap people's knuckles and just say bad builders, bad validators do not do this. We have to repair it at the mechanism level and at the root. Yeah.
00:45:06.500 - 00:45:10.974, Speaker B: That is the power of crypto economics that we have the power to do that. Okay, moving on.
00:45:11.012 - 00:45:11.742, Speaker A: Ready? Yeah.
00:45:11.796 - 00:45:44.886, Speaker B: Kyber network, which is a DFI liquidity protocol, started in 2017 as an ICO. Just been in the background invisibly providing liquidity. OGs like super competent team, been around for a while, sadly, was exploited for $55 million. 20 million from Kyron Arbitrum, 15 from optimism, seven from the ETH layer one. And the exploiter, this is the same exploiter. If you saw this on crypto Twitter, who was like, who exploited Kyber and then wrote this on chain message saying, negotiations will begin after I've had arrest.
00:45:44.998 - 00:45:45.466, Speaker A: Wow.
00:45:45.568 - 00:45:54.862, Speaker B: People are like, oh, he's just exploiting now he's going to go take a nap. So here are the demands. He wrote this very long on chain message. It goes to all relevant and or.
00:45:54.916 - 00:45:58.682, Speaker A: This is the hacker who has that 50 million from Kyber Network.
00:45:58.826 - 00:47:01.154, Speaker B: Yes. To all relevant and or interested parties, I thank you for your attention and patience during this uncertain time for Kyber as well as the company of Kyber Dow and company below, I have delineated a treaty for us to agree to. My demands are as follows. Complete executive control over Kyber, the company, temporary full authority and ownership over the governance mechanism Kyber Dao in order to enact legislative changes, my current wallet address is fined for this. All documents and information related to company and protocol formation, structure, operation, revenues, profits, expensive assets, liabilities, investors and salaries, and the surrender of all Kyber the company assets both on and off chain, including but not limited to shares, equity tokens, partnerships, blogs, websites, servers, passwords, social channels, and any and all creative and intellectual property of clever. He's saying, hey, in order for this money to return, you got to give me the company. Like I'm the captain now.
00:47:01.352 - 00:47:11.640, Speaker A: This is so stupid. First of all, whoever this is is obviously a complete dick. But also these are impossible demands to meet.
00:47:12.650 - 00:47:19.074, Speaker B: I think technically they would be possible, but he needs to, like, then he would get arrested. He would get arrested.
00:47:19.122 - 00:47:40.954, Speaker A: Then here's my equity. Where is Kyber organized? It's like Singapore or Hong Kong or something, if I recall correctly. What email address should I send this to and what name should I put? Oh, here's my name. It's settled in. Meat doesn't. This is impossible. And I would rather just send the authorities to his house rather than send him legal documents.
00:47:40.954 - 00:47:42.510, Speaker A: If you know exactly who he is.
00:47:42.580 - 00:47:46.170, Speaker B: And so it's got to be a troll then, right? It's got to be a troll.
00:47:46.250 - 00:48:04.098, Speaker A: This has got to be a troll. So maybe it's a negotiation tactic, but he ends with this. He says, this is my best offer. This is my only offer. I require my demands to be met by December 10. Otherwise the treaty falls through and I guess he keeps the 50 million. Actually, I don't think this person's in a good position to negotiate.
00:48:04.194 - 00:48:11.030, Speaker B: In so many cases, most exploiters end up getting in trouble. It's really hard to hide your tracks.
00:48:11.110 - 00:48:23.626, Speaker A: Yeah, FBI. Somebody hunts them down, finds them. Maybe he strong arms them, exist for a while. But how's he actually going to exit these positions? It's going to be tracked on chain anyway.
00:48:23.728 - 00:48:29.774, Speaker B: The only thing I can think of is like, he just threw a big old distraction their way and he's trying to figure out what his next move is.
00:48:29.812 - 00:48:36.162, Speaker A: Yeah, you think? Some of these hackers, they do the hack and they're like, oh, I caught the car and I don't know what I'm going to do.
00:48:36.216 - 00:48:37.282, Speaker B: Right? Yeah, exactly.
00:48:37.416 - 00:48:46.418, Speaker A: Yeah. A dog chases car and catches it. David, we've got some execution layers on the scene. The first one, it's called movement, I believe. What is this?
00:48:46.504 - 00:49:01.820, Speaker B: Yeah, movement is a move based L2 on Ethereum with Celestia data availability. I think if you're a developer. You really think move is super cool? I guess. I don't know. Cool programming language. Great stuff over there.
00:49:03.950 - 00:49:06.506, Speaker A: It's non EVM. It's just like not solidity, right? Yeah.
00:49:06.528 - 00:49:09.526, Speaker B: It's not solidity. Yeah. Is move like the Facebook language?
00:49:09.638 - 00:49:10.506, Speaker A: It was. Yeah.
00:49:10.608 - 00:49:27.682, Speaker B: Oh, look at me. Look at this guy. Anyways, move based ethereum L2 on the scene got launched with Celeste. Data availability. That's pretty cool. Also say V two, say is like one of those big high valued chains that raise a ton of money towards the end.
00:49:27.736 - 00:49:28.574, Speaker A: Killers and quotes.
00:49:28.622 - 00:49:29.022, Speaker B: Killers.
00:49:29.086 - 00:49:30.050, Speaker A: High tps thing.
00:49:30.120 - 00:49:37.254, Speaker B: Yeah. They are announcing, say, v two, parallelized EVM. So this is also what Monad does as well.
00:49:37.292 - 00:49:38.838, Speaker A: Parallelized. Right?
00:49:39.004 - 00:49:41.030, Speaker B: Parallelized EVM.
00:49:41.610 - 00:49:43.938, Speaker A: Not parallelized. It's parallelized.
00:49:44.034 - 00:49:45.074, Speaker B: Parallelized.
00:49:45.202 - 00:49:46.354, Speaker A: It happens in parallel.
00:49:46.402 - 00:49:53.002, Speaker B: Yes. If we could get the parallel EVM to the Ethereum layer one, that would be super cool. I don't know how much of an engineering lift that is.
00:49:53.136 - 00:49:56.762, Speaker A: Anyways, if we could get that by next week too, guys, that'd be great.
00:49:56.896 - 00:50:06.030, Speaker B: That'd be fantastic. And so. Yeah, some cool new chains. Yeah. All the Cheney, Cheney stuff. Ready to move on to NFTs.
00:50:07.010 - 00:50:17.682, Speaker A: I just want to say one more thing. I think there's a lot of experiments going on in parallelized EVMs. Right. One is this say thing. It's a L2. Another is monad. We've talked about that before.
00:50:17.682 - 00:50:25.682, Speaker A: They're doing like a parallelized EVM that can very high transactions per second.
00:50:25.736 - 00:50:35.282, Speaker B: Also, one of the big things that the Salana people flex about the Solana virtual machine is it's like localized fee markets and parallelization. Yeah, they've got a great, this is that for the EVM?
00:50:35.346 - 00:50:44.202, Speaker A: This is that for the EVM. And also eclipse, who we've brought on before, which are basically doing salana virtual machine only on a L2. Anyway, a lot of cool innovation going.
00:50:44.256 - 00:50:44.950, Speaker B: Data availability.
00:50:45.030 - 00:50:47.606, Speaker A: Okay, we could talk about NFTs now. Tell me about it, David.
00:50:47.718 - 00:51:00.880, Speaker B: Okay, so we, Ryan, like the cats. That's a phrase that the cats say. These are the cool cats. They got a big blow up balloon on Macy's Thanksgiving holiday day parade, and I think that's pretty cool.
00:51:01.970 - 00:51:07.982, Speaker A: One of my kids was watching this, and she said, dad, it's a cool cat is. Yeah, they know what a cool cat is.
00:51:08.036 - 00:51:30.934, Speaker B: Oh, cool. We don't have the picture up, but there's a video of Clon, who is the creator of cool cats, like doing like a selfie video as he's walking. Oh, really? Yeah, I met him at the cool cats meet up in LA when I lived in San Diego, and there's like 200 people there at this cool cats meetup in LA. And there was like this cat drawing station, and he was just like, there just drawing some cats with some other cool cat owners, doing it for the art.
00:51:30.972 - 00:51:34.570, Speaker A: We're not doing it for price anymore. We're just doing it because we want to support the art.
00:51:34.640 - 00:51:35.834, Speaker B: Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool.
00:51:35.952 - 00:51:38.454, Speaker A: David, where in the world is Richard Hart from hex?
00:51:38.502 - 00:51:40.922, Speaker B: I feel like that's an probably trolling someone online.
00:51:41.056 - 00:51:47.818, Speaker A: All right, so we got a block story. It says the SEC is having trouble serving hex founder Richard Hart with its lawsuit.
00:51:47.914 - 00:51:48.842, Speaker B: I'm just shocked.
00:51:48.906 - 00:52:03.186, Speaker A: The SEC has some lawsuits for Richard Hart, I guess, and they can't find information about the location of Richard Hart. Gary Gensler wants to know about that.
00:52:03.288 - 00:52:24.460, Speaker B: Yeah. So the SEC has said that it underscores the legal hurdles in prosecuting international cases involving digital assets. The Eastern District Court of New York City claims jurisdiction as many of the crypto asset transactions hex herein took place on uniswap, a so called decentralized crypto asset trading platform whose developers are headquartered in.
00:52:26.750 - 00:52:29.466, Speaker A: The. Are they trying to implicate uniswap here, too?
00:52:29.568 - 00:52:33.978, Speaker B: Yes, they are so called decentralized. Those are the words of Elizabeth Warren.
00:52:34.074 - 00:52:40.366, Speaker A: I don't know, man. I don't know who I dislike more. Is it the scammers or some of these kind of regulators that are trying.
00:52:40.388 - 00:52:45.618, Speaker B: To say, uniswap Labs needs to rename to something else?
00:52:45.784 - 00:52:46.450, Speaker A: What?
00:52:46.600 - 00:52:48.782, Speaker B: Well, because uniswap.
00:52:48.926 - 00:52:52.594, Speaker A: Are you trying to get into a bankless, bankless dow thing again?
00:52:52.792 - 00:52:56.660, Speaker B: Oh, my God, I am confused. Oh, my God, I am doing that.
00:52:58.390 - 00:53:13.866, Speaker A: Can't get it out of my head. Yeah. Uniswap and Uniswap labs, are they the same thing? What? Are they too confusing? How about Cz? He has been ordered to stay in the US for now. I suppose. U. S. Authorities think he is a flight risk, so they're saying, you gotta stay here, you can't leave.
00:53:13.968 - 00:53:24.762, Speaker B: Well, he has a massive amount of wealth, and also where he's from, the UAE has no extradition treaty with the United States. So you put those two things together and they're like, you know what, CZ, you're going to stay here.
00:53:24.896 - 00:53:30.938, Speaker A: And so he is waiting for his court case, right, to actually determine his sentencing. Like his jail sentencing.
00:53:31.034 - 00:53:35.870, Speaker B: Right. How many years, months he will stay in jail, which will happen in like, February 20 something.
00:53:36.020 - 00:53:36.710, Speaker A: February.
00:53:36.810 - 00:53:38.162, Speaker B: February, yeah. Okay.
00:53:38.216 - 00:53:45.134, Speaker A: Wow. So there you go. David, we got a meme of the week to end this weekly roll up. What are we looking at here? Elizabeth Warren.
00:53:45.182 - 00:54:25.098, Speaker B: How are we looking at Elizabeth Warren tweet saying, okay, we do not need another private equity deal that could lead to higher food prices for consumers. The FTC is right to investigate whether the purchase of subway by the same firms that own Jimmy John's and McAllister's deli are creating a sandwich shop monopoly. And it is a political serious tweet. It is a serious is going. She's not only recruiting an anti crypto army, she's also recruiting an anti sandwich shop monopoly army as well. Yuga y who works at Coinbase, who goes. Senator, as one of your constituents, I would like to thank you for your tough stance on sandwich shops.
00:54:25.098 - 00:54:35.634, Speaker B: These crumb jugglers have been wreaking havoc in our communities for too long. The election will be decided by issues of bread and fill, and I'm happy to see you understand that.
00:54:35.752 - 00:54:51.158, Speaker A: Oh, my gosh. That is great. That is what Elizabeth Warren is spending her time on. Hey, better sandwiches than crypto. I think she's maybe more productive over there, that's for sure. All right, we're going to end with risks in a minute. But first we disclose neither David nor myself have ever held the token called hex.
00:54:51.158 - 00:54:53.174, Speaker A: Important disclosure there. But we do own east.
00:54:53.222 - 00:54:57.020, Speaker B: Why is that in there?
00:54:57.630 - 00:55:06.346, Speaker A: I thought it'd be funny. May's not risky. Disclaimers, guys. Crypto is risky. You definitely lose what you put in. But so are sandwich shops and delis. We are headed west.
00:55:06.346 - 00:55:11.340, Speaker A: This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
