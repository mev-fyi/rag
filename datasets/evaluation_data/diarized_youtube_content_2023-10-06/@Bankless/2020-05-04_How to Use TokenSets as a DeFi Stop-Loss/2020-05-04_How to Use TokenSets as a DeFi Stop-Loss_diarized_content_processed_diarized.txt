00:00:01.450 - 00:01:02.682, Speaker A: Hi everyone, this is defi dad. I wanted to explain a concept I posted about the other day called the defi stop loss. So the idea is that you can use a token set with a trading strategy that you want exposure to, but because, let's say the price of ether is close to meeting the criteria for that token set to sell out of ether into, in this case compound USDC, you can ultimately treat it like a defi stop loss. So just a little background. If you're not familiar with what a stop loss is, when you look at a traditional exchange like Coinbase that's centralized, or if you look at something like DydX, which is decentralized, the concept of a stop loss is you can basically put in what is a price point where you would like to sell out of ether at that price point or below. So in this case, I have a stop loss set for one eth to sell. If the price falls below 200 die.
00:01:02.682 - 00:01:43.790, Speaker A: Just give me whatever the best price is at that point. I'd rather get back into die, and then hopefully I can buy back ether at a lower price. Another way to do this using Defi tools would be gelato. So in the future, when this has been audited, which it hasn't been, and it's still in its alpha version, so I would not recommend using this just yet. Unless you're playing around with really small amounts of money that you're willing to lose, you can set a condition of whatever the price is, let's say, of ether. Let's say it's 200 die or less, I'm going to then set an action to trade that ether into die. So back to the original idea of using this token set.
00:01:43.790 - 00:02:24.010, Speaker A: I'm looking at the 20 day moving average crossover yield set. The criteria for this is that two days have to have gone by since the last rebalance. And then if the price of ether, currently around $207, goes below the 20 day moving average, which is around 190, then let's go ahead and sell ether into compound USDC, which is the interest earning form of USDC in compound. So you'll see this actually in action. If you look at the chart. What you want to pay attention to is look at these numbers here. Oh, I'm sorry.
00:02:24.010 - 00:02:57.960, Speaker A: This right here, this is the current price allocation. It shows basically whether this is made up of ether or compound USDC. So you notice as I scroll along this, the green line represents the set. The purple line below is ether. So the price of ether is fluctuating, but the set is constant because we're currently in 100% compound USDC. Then we get to this dotted line where the criteria has been met for the token set to buy back ether. So at this point below, you can see that now that big purple line shows up there.
00:02:57.960 - 00:03:58.962, Speaker A: So you can see now that we're in 100% ether, we've essentially bought back all of our ether with the compound USDC that we were holding on to in the set. So the reverse situation is currently in place where what's going on right now is we're in ether. So this set is mirroring the purple line, the aqua and the purple line. The aqua line being the set, the purple line being ether. They follow one another because we're in 100% ether. However, if you are concerned about the price of ether falling, and if you'd like to use a stop loss to prevent yourself from losing more money in terms of dollar value, you can put your money into this token set and it will ultimately sell out of ether whenever that price falls below 191. Thing you want to be aware of is the risk of this is that the price could fall, it could rebalance into USDC, then the price could rocket upwards.
00:03:58.962 - 00:04:58.802, Speaker A: So ideally it goes below the 20 day moving average, and you get a chance to buy back ether at a higher price, or I'm sorry, at a lower price. But a bad situation would be that the price goes upwards and now you're buying back ether at a higher price. So you just need to be really cautious about what it is that you're trying to accomplish here and whether or not the strategy makes sense to you. So anyways, that's how a Defi stop loss would ultimately work. Normally I would just set a stop loss again with DyDX, or if you use a centralized exchange, you would use that and you'd say, in this case, the 20 day moving average here is around 190. And so I would be setting a stop loss myself manually, but I think it's much easier just to put my ether into the token set, the ETH 20 day moving average crossover yield set. So anyways, I hope this is helpful.
00:04:58.802 - 00:05:09.100, Speaker A: Let me know if you have any questions. And hopefully we'll be posting more videos like this with tips and tricks to use Defi on the bankless YouTube channel.
