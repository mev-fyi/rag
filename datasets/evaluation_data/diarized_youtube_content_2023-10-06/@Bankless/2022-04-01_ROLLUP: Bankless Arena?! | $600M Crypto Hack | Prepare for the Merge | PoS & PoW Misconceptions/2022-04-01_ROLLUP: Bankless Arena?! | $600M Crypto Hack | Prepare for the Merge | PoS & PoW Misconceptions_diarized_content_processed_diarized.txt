00:00:00.170 - 00:00:07.194, Speaker A: We can't wait to tell you who put their name on the next crypto sports arena. I'm super excited about this, David, and I know you're smiling, too. I know you're excited.
00:00:07.242 - 00:00:11.070, Speaker B: I know, I know. I kind of want to skip right there, but it goes in the news section.
00:00:13.970 - 00:00:23.534, Speaker A: Happy Friday morning, bankless nation. It is the last week of March, or is it the first week of April? I'm not too sure, David. But I do know one thing. It is time for.
00:00:23.652 - 00:00:44.618, Speaker B: What? The bankless weekly roll up, Ryan, where we cover the entire news in the last week in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless, covering everything that happened in the markets, the news, what's going on, the NFT shenanigans, the regulation shenanigans. We cover it all here on the Friday bankless weekly roll up.
00:00:44.704 - 00:00:49.914, Speaker A: Absolutely. Fastest way to get your crypto digest and some hot stuff. Hot Topics this week.
00:00:49.952 - 00:00:51.726, Speaker B: It's going to be a fun week. It's going to be a fun week.
00:00:51.828 - 00:00:58.590, Speaker A: Look, we got to talk about more crypto companies putting their names on sports stadiums, okay? Who could that be happening?
00:00:58.660 - 00:00:59.920, Speaker B: Who could that be?
00:01:00.370 - 00:01:15.246, Speaker A: April 1. It's happening. We're going to tell you about the biggest one yet. I think this is bigger than FTX. I think this is bigger than crypto.com. This is the biggest one yet. And we can't wait to tell you who put their name on the next crypto sports arena.
00:01:15.246 - 00:01:18.670, Speaker A: I'm super excited about this, David. I know you're smiling, too. I know you're excited.
00:01:18.830 - 00:01:27.400, Speaker B: I kind of want to skip right there, but it goes in the news section. It's not the biggest in terms of deals, in terms of money deals, but it's the biggest in terms of culture. I would say.
00:01:27.770 - 00:01:50.158, Speaker A: I totally agree with that. Also, one of the biggest hacks maybe in crypto history, the ronan side chain. There was an exploit. So this was a 600 million dollar plus hack. We got to cover that. What happened? What went wrong? Are side chains really safe? What does this mean for Axie? Infinity, of course, because that's the Ronin side chain. Also, David, there are so many misconceptions out there about two things.
00:01:50.158 - 00:02:11.042, Speaker A: Number one, the ethereum merge. Number two, proof of stake. We're going to lay those misconceptions to rest and also talk about traditional finance institutions waking up to the merge, waking up to proof of stake. Lots of reports there. So a number of things to cover. I'm excited to dive in. Dave, before we get there, we should talk a little bit about permissionless.
00:02:11.042 - 00:02:16.230, Speaker A: This is a conference and we are getting closer and closer. I think we're like two months away. Is that correct?
00:02:16.300 - 00:02:37.486, Speaker B: Yeah. The drum roll for permissionless is getting louder and louder. May 17 to 19th, Palm Beach, Florida. It's just going to be insanely fun. This is gearing up to be a reunion of the bankless podcast and also so many more guests and panelists and speakers. Some insane content. All of your favorite bankless previous podcast guests are going to be there.
00:02:37.486 - 00:03:12.102, Speaker B: Justin Drake, Chris Dixon, Nick Carter, Eric Peters, who's huge in the traditional finance world. We had him on the podcast, Jiho from Axie, of course, Jake Schravinsky, for all the people who are trying to get downloaded with the legal and regulatory side of the crypto industry, Ryan Selkis, of course. What would a conference be without him? Donnie from Ave just had him on the show. It's going to be the who's who of crypto events. Smack in the middle of the year, May 17 to 19th in Palm Beach, Florida, bankless is throwing a party. I'm going to be there vibing. Ryan and I are going to meet for the first time.
00:03:12.102 - 00:03:31.982, Speaker B: The number of things that is going to happen at permissionless is off the charts. There's not even enough time to talk about it here. So you got to get your ticket. There is a link in the show notes to go get your ticket. If you are a bankless premium subscriber, you get 30% off, which pays for your entire bankless premium for the year. So there you go for that. And you got to come.
00:03:31.982 - 00:03:38.930, Speaker B: You got to come. It's going to be a huge event. I'm really looking forward to it. Ryan, I know you're excited for permissionless. Why are you excited for permissionless?
00:03:39.350 - 00:04:11.562, Speaker A: I'm excited to meet you, David. That's really why I'm going. Well, the conference is cool and everything, but let's finally meet in person, I guess. Hope the podcast doesn't end as we're talking about David, something else going on. Our friends at consensus on the NFT side wanted to give the bankless nation a heads up. So on April 10, it is National Youth HIV AIDS Awareness Day. And Mac Mac, the makeup company, is actually releasing an NFT collection.
00:04:11.562 - 00:05:05.226, Speaker A: This is going to be powered by consensus NFT. It's going to be dropping on April the 10th, and it's featuring art by Keith Herring. The cool thing about this, I think, is some of you listening have kind of dabbled around in nfts, haven't really gotten into it, but this is an opportunity for the NFT, the first time buyers of nfts, to get a cool NFT and also support a great cause, because all of the proceeds of this NFT actually go 100% to support youth impacted by HIV and AIDS. And this is in two forms. So one, the initial purchase price of the NFT, and then because nfts are so badass, every resale of that NFT, 2.5% also goes to the cause of HIV and AIDS and the youth impacted by it. There's three rarity levels.
00:05:05.226 - 00:05:23.282, Speaker A: So there's like a bottom tier of like just $25 NFT all the way up to $1,000 NFT at the rarest level. Only 25 of those. And all of these, of course, are super scarce. The art is not released yet. Okay. It's not released yet. I can't wait to see what these look like.
00:05:23.282 - 00:05:45.434, Speaker A: But if you want to partake in this, at least check it out. What you got to do is go sign up. I've got the website in front of me right now, but a quick link to that would be bankless, CCMAC, capital m, capital a, capital c. That'll get you there right away. I'm going to pick up one of these, David, because it's a good cause, man.
00:05:45.552 - 00:06:09.634, Speaker B: In Vitalik's blog post about legitimacy, he talked about ways that NFT projects can gain legitimacy, and it was through donating to causes. We saw this with people pleasers effort in her nfts, like some portion of the proceeds going to charity to establish legitimacy, 100% of the revenue is going to this charity. So extremely legitimate, I think is how the conclusion to that.
00:06:09.832 - 00:06:10.958, Speaker A: Very legitimate.
00:06:11.054 - 00:06:11.362, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:11.416 - 00:06:26.102, Speaker A: And this is cool to see companies partaking in this, too. So it's also a crypto saturation story. A lot of wins here for everyone. Speaking of wins, are we getting wins in the market, David? Let's flip to market stuff. Bitcoin price, any wins there on the week?
00:06:26.156 - 00:06:47.198, Speaker B: Yeah, we got some wins. We started the start of the week at $43,000, hit a high of $48,000, of which it almost was at the time of recording. Except in the last like hour or so, we tanked. We tanked from 47 and a half down to $45.7 thousand. Still though, Ryan, up 7% on the week. Maybe a little bit less, maybe like 6.5%.
00:06:47.198 - 00:06:50.702, Speaker B: It's a good week. It was a good week. It's been a good month. It's been a good month.
00:06:50.836 - 00:06:53.854, Speaker A: It's been a really good month. Like, look at this and I'll take it.
00:06:53.892 - 00:07:02.722, Speaker B: I have to say, the bearish, David weekly roll up, which people have definitely tapped into and have been teasing me about so far, has painted the bottom look.
00:07:02.776 - 00:07:05.426, Speaker A: Some people are calling that a top signal. David, I hate to break it to.
00:07:05.448 - 00:07:07.406, Speaker B: You, man, but what's a top signal?
00:07:07.438 - 00:07:12.690, Speaker A: You mean a bottom signal of you? Excuse me? Bottom signal of you being bearish.
00:07:12.770 - 00:07:13.302, Speaker B: I'm sorry.
00:07:13.356 - 00:07:14.598, Speaker A: For the first time ever on a.
00:07:14.604 - 00:07:23.450, Speaker B: Roll up, you go back three to four weeks, and you look at the fundamentals of the macro market and tell me how hard it was to be bullish in that moment. Like, give me a break.
00:07:23.600 - 00:07:31.914, Speaker A: It was difficult. Some of us managed to do it, though. Okay, David, let's talk about Eth price. Hopefully, we're going up, too. Are we?
00:07:31.952 - 00:07:53.634, Speaker B: Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. Started the week at $3,050, hit a high of $3,450, up $400 for the peak, but also has kind of retraced in the last few hours here. We always record these on Thursday morning. Thursday, March 31, down, or, excuse me. Up 9% on the week. Down, like, two or 3% in the last hour to where we are now at roughly about 3300.
00:07:53.634 - 00:07:56.990, Speaker B: Ryan, you're showing the bitcoin price chart, just FYI. Am I? Oops.
00:07:57.070 - 00:07:59.362, Speaker A: Let me flip that ether. Here we go.
00:07:59.416 - 00:08:06.342, Speaker B: There you go. Yeah. So chopping around. Had a really bullish week. Kind of retraced a little bit just now, but again, up 9% on the week.
00:08:06.476 - 00:08:13.302, Speaker A: Yeah, I was just looking at the shape of the chart, and I was like, that looks a lot like bitcoin. How about the ratio ratio?
00:08:13.366 - 00:08:24.910, Speaker B: Bitcoin ratio ratio, up about 2% on the week. Started last week at zero seven. We are up to zero. 7117. 2%. Up 2%.
00:08:25.060 - 00:08:27.950, Speaker A: That means I'm 2% more bullish. How about you?
00:08:28.020 - 00:08:29.534, Speaker B: That's about right. That's about right.
00:08:29.652 - 00:08:30.874, Speaker A: There's also market signal.
00:08:30.922 - 00:09:00.646, Speaker B: We got some candidate charts to show. And then market Monday this week, put a bunch of charts into the newsletter. And there's just the same pattern that you see across the three most important charts in crypto in my mind, which is bitcoin, ether and the ETH BTC ratio. Starting all the way back, I guess. I think this chart starts. It really gets bullish in the start of 2021, where bitcoin zoomed from, like, $20,000 up to almost $70,000. And then it went from 70, went down to 36.
00:09:00.646 - 00:09:22.030, Speaker B: From 36, went back up to 70 ish. I'm kind of rounding these numbers here. And then after it hit, like, 69, the high of $69,000. It then went back down to $36,000. But now it's again retracing, bouncing off that bottom. So there's a channel here with higher highs and higher lows over time. This is a one year long channel, and the same channel is seen in the ether price.
00:09:22.030 - 00:09:49.026, Speaker B: If you scroll down to the ether price, it's the same thing. It's the same thing. Higher highs over time, higher lows over time, over a really long time frame. This is like an 18 month long channel, but we bounce right off of that bottom. And if this channel is something to take guidance from, what is the current top of the channel? For bitcoin, it's $75,000. For ether, it's $5,200. And the same channel you can see in the ETH BTC ratio.
00:09:49.026 - 00:10:08.862, Speaker B: And so if you scroll down once again, Ryan, you can see, yeah, just a little bit more. It's there, too. And so what happens if the ETh PTC ratio bounces, which it did off the floor of, like, 6.55 as the absolute bottom? Again, higher lows and higher highs. What if it goes up to zero nine, where the top of the channel.
00:10:08.916 - 00:10:16.002, Speaker A: Is like, question, what happened to bearish data, David? He's nowhere to be seen. That guy's gone.
00:10:16.136 - 00:10:22.350, Speaker B: Well, Putin is absolutely effed. He's got no options, like Ukraine's fundamentally winning.
00:10:22.430 - 00:10:24.446, Speaker A: There's, like, peace talks, there's peace talks.
00:10:24.478 - 00:10:34.454, Speaker B: Like commodity prices are coming down. All of the bearish reasons have dissipated. And so if you were the person that bought into the fear, congratulations. That worked out for you.
00:10:34.652 - 00:10:51.126, Speaker A: Look, my co host just makes decisions based on the data, and the data has changed. Right. Information coming has changed. Macro looking a bit brighter. I don't know about the Fed in inflation, though. I don't know if that's changed. That data point still feels a little bit bearish.
00:10:51.238 - 00:10:55.680, Speaker B: But the question there is, does that even matter, though? Well, sometimes it doesn't matter.
00:10:56.130 - 00:11:09.854, Speaker A: Maybe heavy inflation is actually good for crypto. Do you want to store your value in dollars, or do you want to store it in crypto assets that have nice channels like this? Let's talk about the bet index. So that's a third. A third, a third. We must be up on the week. It looks like we are bigly.
00:11:09.902 - 00:11:23.014, Speaker B: Yeah, actually, this is up more than bitcoin and ether. DFI won the week this week, up 11%. Started the week at $107, ending the week at $128. So DFI leading the way this week.
00:11:23.132 - 00:11:24.770, Speaker A: You ready to call it DFI season.
00:11:24.850 - 00:11:29.270, Speaker B: Oh God, no. I would not ever curse.
00:11:30.970 - 00:11:35.578, Speaker A: How about Eth gas? That's always fun to talk about on a weekly basis. We up or down?
00:11:35.664 - 00:11:46.618, Speaker B: Yeah, gas prices are up on the week, and the last week the average was 22 gwe for the week. We are up to 40. Up to 40 average gas for the week. So gas markets are up again, which is a bullish indicator.
00:11:46.794 - 00:12:10.518, Speaker A: It's always funny to me because I don't know how to feel about gas prices rising because at one level I'm like, oh man, my ether transactions going up at the same time. It's like also a bull market signal. ETH block space more valuable. Ethereum is not like revenue going to staking in the future. Bullish for ether, the asset. So I'm always of a divided mind with respect to that. And I think the market is too.
00:12:10.518 - 00:12:19.830, Speaker A: Market can't figure out whether high ETH gas prices are good for ether or bad for ether. Right. It's like people calling it in either direction.
00:12:21.310 - 00:12:31.574, Speaker B: Sentiment. I think market analysis is definitely when gas prices are up, ether value is going up. I think that's pretty strongly correlated, yes.
00:12:31.632 - 00:13:00.854, Speaker A: And I think that's a bankless thesis as well, that on the main chain, gas fees have to continue to increase over time. Right. Transaction fees will decrease in L2, but they have to continuously increase on Ethereum main net. And that is actually exactly thumbs up. Yeah, exactly one direction or the other. And that is actually the bullcase for ether, the asset when you run the numbers, when it becomes a capital asset. Anyway, we'll get to more of that later, but let's talk about some other market news.
00:13:00.854 - 00:13:05.122, Speaker A: One is that anchor, which is a DFI protocol.
00:13:05.186 - 00:13:06.630, Speaker B: Money market. Terra money market.
00:13:06.700 - 00:13:25.782, Speaker A: Money market borrowing and lending. So similar to comp, similar to Ave, compound or Ave. It just topped ave leapfrogged Ave with 14 billion in total locked value. You can see it here on DFI llama. So there's Ave, there's anchor. Only maker is higher. Lido and curve.
00:13:25.782 - 00:14:21.054, Speaker A: Those are the protocols that are higher than anchor at this point. And this is all coming off of this terra explosion, this UsT explosion that is terra stablecoin Ust. And of course, the last two weeks we've been talking about how doquan and the terra ecosystem is planning to backstop this algorithmic stablecoin rather than being backstopped by the meme narrative price of the luna token, backstopping it with billions of dollars of bitcoin. And that process has started with these bitcoin buys I put this tweet out there because I feel like this is a conversation we need to have on bankless. Is terra Ust the future of crypto money, or is it a ticking time bomb waiting to explode? I think those are two sides of the spectrum. Maybe the truth is in the middle. I'm not sure, but I feel like that's an episode we need to have.
00:14:21.054 - 00:14:26.966, Speaker A: David and I think we have some guests lined up for that. We're in the process of doing that. So hopefully an episode next week on this topic.
00:14:27.018 - 00:14:45.974, Speaker B: Yeah, Wednesday. Wednesday. We're going to figure it out. We're going to get the right guests. We're going to have one bull versus one bear. We've already had multiple very qualified people, very intelligent people, well informed people to raise their hands saying they want to argue either for the bull or the bear side. So we're going to pick out the best candidates, throw them into a Zoom together, and they're going to fight, see what happens.
00:14:45.974 - 00:15:13.470, Speaker B: They're going to fight. And so that's going to happen on, you know, just some comments. Ryan Doe Kwan on Twitter has been like, I'm going to call it icarusing. He's been icarusing pretty hard and he's been kind of a bully. This has been something that people have noticed is like Doe Kwan's being a bully on Twitter. And it has been, it seems to be as a function of terra price, Luna Price. As Luna goes up, Doequan gets even more confident.
00:15:13.470 - 00:15:21.940, Speaker B: I think he's icarusing, man. I think this is like, there's so many top signals right now for Terra. But what do I know? I'm just an.
00:15:22.950 - 00:15:52.854, Speaker A: There is a thing called bull market goggles, I think. And your price has exploded in the way that it has. It's hard not to let that make you feel like you have this sense of invincibility. But look, this panel is for us to really discover this, this bear and bull markets. To understand a bit more about the Ust ecosystem arguments on both sides. I'm always worried about algorithmic stablecoins, just in general. It's because all of the past experiments have failed.
00:15:52.902 - 00:15:55.934, Speaker B: If I had an explosion sound on my soundboard, I would have played it by now.
00:15:56.132 - 00:16:24.854, Speaker A: They have, right? In various ways. And maybe this time it's different. If it is different, let's try to understand how. And I do think that there are successful models for algorithmic stablecoins out there. It's just, let's see. I prefer the ones that are maximally trustless when we're doing that and certainly transparent. Anyway, we're going to dive into this and hopefully surface both sides of the argument for you guys in bankless so we can all learn together.
00:16:25.052 - 00:16:27.126, Speaker B: See if this is icarus or if.
00:16:27.148 - 00:16:30.378, Speaker A: This is like, the next new thing, and this time it's different.
00:16:30.544 - 00:16:52.010, Speaker B: One last comment on this. Ryan. Pop quiz. Who was the last extremely confident person on Twitter? Doe Kwan put out a tweet by my hand, die will die, as in die from maker. Know, he just wants to have ust be the perfect, decentralized, trustless stablecoin to dominate the market. So he tweets out by my hand, die will die. So, pop quiz.
00:16:52.010 - 00:17:01.086, Speaker B: Who is the last extremely confident agro builder on crypto Twitter to talk negatively about makerdao?
00:17:01.278 - 00:17:04.286, Speaker A: Well, that's got to be Danny Sesta.
00:17:04.398 - 00:17:06.338, Speaker B: And what happened three weeks later?
00:17:06.504 - 00:17:23.562, Speaker A: I mean, I don't know. Where's Danny? He didn't come on the podcast. I don't know where he is. I don't know where the frogs it does. I'm feeling a little bit of that energy. Right? Maybe it's different. Look, there are some personalities that are just like, know Elon Musk of the world.
00:17:23.562 - 00:17:28.170, Speaker A: He's actually, like, building things. But we'll have to see. We want to unpack this a little bit more.
00:17:28.240 - 00:17:36.942, Speaker B: Another similarity is that Dokwon also has an invitation out in his Twitter dms to come on bankless, which he has not yet replied to. So there's that.
00:17:37.076 - 00:17:41.034, Speaker A: Well, we'll see. Defi pulse index, the DPI.
00:17:41.082 - 00:17:42.014, Speaker B: This is huge.
00:17:42.212 - 00:18:14.966, Speaker A: This is an index put together by a Defi protocol called index co op. We're big fans of it. DPI is actually part of the bed index as well. It's an assortment of the top blue chip defi assets on Ethereum. It was just listed by Gemini as a coin. So along know index itself and Maple and Frax and some other coins, they are listing the first defi index. And I think, David, this is the first defi index to be listed on an exchange.
00:18:14.966 - 00:18:16.234, Speaker A: Pretty big milestone here.
00:18:16.272 - 00:18:57.782, Speaker B: Yeah, this is something that the index co op and just defi in general has really been looking for for a really, really long time. It's hard to get liquidity and demand for DPI, the Defi index, when it's stuck inside of DPI. Stuck inside of Defi, like, you have to actually go buy it on uniswap, which means you have to take self custody of it. A lot of people want indexes, products like DPI, but they also want it to be inside of their centralized exchange with centralized custody. DPI has been around for over a year now and hasn't been able to break into the centralized exchange marketplace for reasons. There is some risk involved because in theory, the index co op can just change everything about the. There's some, there's some risk involved for centralized exchanges to list this.
00:18:57.782 - 00:19:10.586, Speaker B: That's why it's been slow. But finally, we're getting the DPI into Gemini. So hats off to Gemini. Thank you for getting that. We love you. Love you guys. And just like, come on, let's get more going because there's all.
00:19:10.586 - 00:19:11.630, Speaker B: List them all.
00:19:11.780 - 00:19:35.134, Speaker A: I mean, look a year old. But this does also demonstrate, like, lindy effect in indexes. Right. You wouldn't necessarily, as an exchange, want to list an index product that's like two months old, right. Like 60 days into this thing. You have to give it some time to work out the kinks, figure out what it's doing. And I think DPI has reached that point, so it should be a mainstay.
00:19:35.134 - 00:19:49.814, Speaker A: Right. Gemini lists it. All the other exchanges are going to have to compete to list it. Really cool that D five products are breaking in here. Let's talk about Germany for a second. Almost half of Germans are now invested in crypto. Hats off to Germany, the richest country in Europe.
00:19:49.814 - 00:20:36.210, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. And this is great. I think once you get 50% of your population, and this is like 44%, almost 50%, it's kind of over. For anti crypto regulators, it's kind of over because the people are speaking with their wallets, they're voting with their wallets, and they're saying, we want crypto. And so if you try to push through anti crypto legislation, you're going to have a much stiffer resistance than when you tried to do that in the first decade of crypto, when everyone thought it was like scam money and only 1% of the population owned it. So to me, the most bullish thing is for crypto to, a, be understood, as we've said before, but b, to be owned, that is super Bullish.
00:20:36.290 - 00:20:38.120, Speaker B: So easy. Yes.
00:20:38.970 - 00:20:39.478, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:39.564 - 00:20:50.460, Speaker B: Germany and really Europe at large has always been, I think, a little bit ahead of the curve. A lot of developers in Germany, so very strong, just community there. So cool.
00:20:50.830 - 00:21:01.146, Speaker A: That's cool. I wish we could get there in the US. I don't think we're at 50% yet, but this is cool. This might take us there. Stuff like this. This is RAC. Grammy award winning artist.
00:21:01.146 - 00:21:03.594, Speaker A: Had him on bank list before. Do you want to read out this tweet, David.
00:21:03.642 - 00:21:28.454, Speaker B: Yeah. He goes, I've personally made 12.5 e, about $40,000, which is equivalent to almost 10 million plays on Spotify. RaC would have needed 10 million plays on Spotify to make $40,000, and he just made 12.5 ETH in his number of drops. If you scroll up, Ryan, it'll show up what he's talking about. But like his NFT drop on sound, XYZ made ten EtH, 100 additions for 0.1
00:21:28.454 - 00:22:01.300, Speaker B: ETH each for $310 apiece. And so in addition to royalties, on top of that 2.5 ETH and royalties, this would have taken him 10 million plays on Spotify. Now, I am a huge RAC fan. Since I already have Spotify up, I'm going to go to LraC on Spotify. We're going to see how many plays that he got on his number one song. 44 million plays on his number one song, and he's only had three songs above 10 million plays each.
00:22:01.300 - 00:22:14.434, Speaker B: And that took years for him to establish those plays. And he did this in mere minutes. Nfts and crypto and just tokens and decentralized, trustless, programmatic finance, putting money into the hands of artists.
00:22:14.562 - 00:22:49.390, Speaker A: Yeah, this is super cool. He said this, too on the tweet. So, yes, 100 people generated more income than 9.75 million users. Let that sink in. This hearkens back to our conversation we had, and I would encourage listeners to go listen to it, if you haven't, with Lee Jin, where she talked about, forget the 1000 true fans thing, 100 true fans can make you for you in nfts. You can have a narrow fan base of the hundred most passionate people about the thing you're creating.
00:22:49.390 - 00:23:09.110, Speaker A: Completely fund everything you're doing as a creator, because these are sort of like the most passionate individuals who are willing to spend any amount, and not just spend this amount, but actually invest this amount in you because they believe in you. This is the power of nfts in the creator economy. And I think that's what RaC is saying here and demonstrating.
00:23:10.010 - 00:23:23.854, Speaker B: And we did a show with Rac, Amit, the nation. If you guys want to meet Andre, great guy, great music. Listen to his music in college. And then also the episodes that we did with Blau also come to mind if you guys are interested in this subject matter.
00:23:23.972 - 00:23:27.310, Speaker A: Super smart guy, both of them. Aztec's roll up.
00:23:27.460 - 00:23:28.030, Speaker B: This is hot.
00:23:28.100 - 00:23:34.158, Speaker A: 200. No, sorry. 20K eth in deposits shielded. What is Aztec? Why is this hot?
00:23:34.244 - 00:23:52.294, Speaker B: Yeah. So Aztec is a L2 privacy roll up. It also has a layer one smart contract system. But this is, I believe, yeah, this is the layer. 220 thousand ether is now in Aztec shielded. So that's 20,000 shielded ether, as in private ether. This is basically like to take Zcash, the blockchain, but make it into a L2.
00:23:52.294 - 00:24:40.886, Speaker B: That's basically what this is. And there's some other smart contract functioning as well. And so this is like tornado cash, but even better, using ZK technology to have private ether transactions, which sounds like we're going to be needing even more and more as we go into this highly authoritarian future that we kind of see ahead of. Like, remember Ryan? I think it was last week, or maybe the week before, but we were talking about Elizabeth Warren being super cringe when she was asking somebody in Congress, I'm hearing about, like, if you have these cross chain bridges, can't you just obfuscate all the ether? And she was making the point that crypto is making it easy to obfuscate, but she was getting her details wrong about how crossing bridges are obfuscation. Anyways, it was super cringe. She was trying to paint a narrative. The thing I'm a little bit concerned about, Ryan, is, like, what she was looking for.
00:24:40.886 - 00:25:05.870, Speaker B: She was attacking the wrong source. What she thinks all of crypto is, is what Aztec is building. And so this is a regulator's worst fear, is private L2s that has complete assurances as to privacy and ownership and payments. So once regulators get their minds around ZK technology, which is going to take a while, I'm a little bit worried that they're actually going to have some real fodder to fight.
00:25:05.940 - 00:26:02.880, Speaker A: All right, but here's the problem. Why in the world is it regulators worst fear that citizens actually have privacy on their crypto assets? They don't have access to a list of all of the physical property I own. They don't know how much cash I have in my wallet, in my physical wallet, or gold bars I might have in a vault somewhere in my basement. Okay? But they need to know everything about my digital transactions. The problem is establishing this as a norm, like, an outrage norm that Elizabeth Warren and any politician has no right to be angry about privacy of crypto transactions. We need to bust through that as a like, it's absolutely ludicrous, authoritarian and ridiculous that free private speech in the form of money on the Internet would be a thing that's controversial in any western democratic country.
00:26:04.290 - 00:26:06.800, Speaker B: You don't need to convince me. Right. I'm sorry.
00:26:07.990 - 00:26:14.514, Speaker A: That was for me. I'm not saying that for bankless listeners either. I just needed to say that you're totally right.
00:26:14.552 - 00:26:18.542, Speaker B: That should be the approach. I have zero faith that that's going to be the approach.
00:26:18.686 - 00:26:27.366, Speaker A: Exactly. Same here. This is why we need to be active, guys. We'll get to that when we get to the regulatory section. But first, man, we're going to talk about the sponsors and when we get.
00:26:27.388 - 00:26:29.254, Speaker B: Back, we got to talk about that.
00:26:29.292 - 00:26:38.186, Speaker A: Breaking news. This is happening. Arenas being purchased by crypto companies. We're going to get right into it. Before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:26:38.288 - 00:27:18.946, Speaker B: Arbitrum is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs. Over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrum, and the DFI and NFT ecosystems are growing rapidly. Some of the coolest and newest NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home. All the while, DFI protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity. Using arbitrum has never been easier, especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitrum through all the exchanges, including Binance, FTX, Huobi and crypto.com. Once inside, you'll notice arbitrum increases ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee. If you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users, visit Arbitrum IO slash developer to start building your DaP on Arbitrum.

Go to bridge Arbitrum IO now to start bridging over your ETH and other tokens in order to experience DFI nfts in the way it was always meant to be, fast, cheap, secure, and friction free. The Brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 Internet, with over 50 million monthly active users. Control your digital footprint with built in privacy and ad blocking. Inside the brave browser, you'll find the brave wallet, the first secure crypto wallet built natively inside of a web3 crypto browser. Web three is freedom from big Tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy. But there's a weak point in web3, your crypto wallet.
00:27:58.814 - 00:28:32.862, Speaker B: The brave wallet is different. Bravewall is built natively inside the brave browser, no extension required, which gives the brave wallet an extra level of security versus other wallets. With the brave wallet, you can buy, store, send and swap your crypto assets, and it can even manage your nfts and connect to other wallets and DFI apps, all from the security of the best privacy browser on the market. Whether you're new to crypto or a seasoned pro, it's time to switch to the brave wallet. Download Brave@brave.com bankless and click the wallet icon to get started. Ave is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol, and now Ave V three is here.

00:29:18.196 - 00:29:23.514, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back with the releases of the week. This is a hot release, David.
00:29:23.562 - 00:29:24.970, Speaker B: It's been a long time coming. Ryan.
00:29:25.050 - 00:29:39.942, Speaker A: Look, I feel like we should just maybe get right to the press release here, because this just dropped this morning. This morning. Okay, first save April this morning. Wells Fargo arena is now the bankless arena. David, do you want to read this press release here?
00:29:39.996 - 00:29:50.282, Speaker B: Yeah, but the arena for the Philadelphia Flyers and the 76 ers, that arena in Philadelphia is now bankless arena. We got it. We got the name.
00:29:50.416 - 00:29:59.366, Speaker A: We did it. The bankless arena. Okay, first FTX did it, then crypto.com, now bankless. We are just taking it back from the bank.
00:29:59.398 - 00:30:15.186, Speaker B: Fargo, we didn't care about any other arena, but it was the Wells Fargo arena that their naming rights happened to have ended this year. And so we submitted the bid. We won the bid. It's not the biggest naming rights deal. We don't have FTX money. We don't have crypto.com money.
00:30:15.186 - 00:30:26.702, Speaker B: But we were early to eth. We have some money. And so Wells Fargo arena, now bankless arena, sick as f. Sick as f. Yup.
00:30:26.846 - 00:30:30.898, Speaker A: Last minute bid as well. Citadel CEO Ken Griffin tried to beat.
00:30:30.914 - 00:30:31.970, Speaker B: Us out for this Internet.
00:30:32.050 - 00:30:32.818, Speaker A: That was a nail.
00:30:32.914 - 00:30:34.486, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
00:30:34.588 - 00:30:50.842, Speaker A: But managed to do it. Guys, all of the details are here for you in the press release that we just published on banklist. So we'll include a link to that. But look, this is more evidence that crypto is here to stay. What should we get next? We got an arena. What's next?
00:30:50.896 - 00:30:53.360, Speaker B: Oh, God, I don't know. Let's get a whole country.
00:30:54.530 - 00:30:58.926, Speaker A: Buy an island. Start with an island. The bankless island. Totally worth it.
00:30:58.948 - 00:31:17.118, Speaker B: Hey, congratulations, man. Pass on the back. Thank you to the bankless community and everyone that has listened to bankless and all the sponsors for bankless. We couldn't have done it without you. This is crypto taking over. We're putting our names on places and bankless is next up. Bankless arena.
00:31:17.118 - 00:31:18.998, Speaker B: It just has a great ring to it.
00:31:19.084 - 00:31:28.214, Speaker A: Yeah, I can't wait to see the flyers play, man. It's going to be awesome. I love sports. Anyway, we should move on. Okay. Because that's a big deal. That's a big deal.
00:31:28.214 - 00:31:38.170, Speaker A: But there are some other things that are happening in crypto as well. Apple Pay integrating with metamask, this is not a super big deal, but it feels like a big deal. Tell us about this.
00:31:38.240 - 00:32:25.674, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is an integration with wire wyre right into Metamask. And Wire has this widget that allows you to buy, I think, up to like $500 worth of ether using Apple Pay. And now that's hooked right into metamask. So you can now get Apple Pay into metamask to buy ether and other tokens straight from your credit card, straight from your debit card using Apple Pay. And so I think this is going to be especially useful for activities on L2s because $500 of ether on the layer one isn't too useful. But then things like gaming where people don't really care about Ether or Ethereum, but they need to fund their wallet to play games, that's going to be really useful. This has always been what wire has always been building towards this integration has been.
00:32:25.674 - 00:32:29.494, Speaker B: Apple Pay via wire has been a thing for a while. It's just now it's in Metamask.
00:32:29.622 - 00:33:02.982, Speaker A: Yeah, it's cool. It's just greater access to fiat and onboarding that into crypto is awesome. OpeNC just added Salana NFTs this week, and of course, Salana NFTs shot up in price, many of them. The floor prices have risen for sure. OpeNC calling this the best kept secret in web3 multichain NFTs. That is a thing now. And OpeNC is supporting them, whether it's arbitram, optimism, polygon, Salana, avalanche nfts everywhere on all of the chains seems to be the direction we're moving in.
00:33:03.036 - 00:33:31.694, Speaker B: Yeah, OpenSea is just killing it on the execution layer. Kind of a bummer that Solana isn't EVM compatible. Right? Because then you have to have an alternative wallet. Like, I have my trustless state Opensea account where everyone can go check out my nfts and that's my Ethereum address for my nfts. But that's a different wallet for my Solana wallet, which I don't have. But if I did have one, it would be different just because it's not an EVM thing. But I'm assuming they're eventually going to integrate avalanche and that will be the same wallet, so things like that.
00:33:31.694 - 00:33:37.860, Speaker B: But anyways, Opensea blockchain, agnostic, integrating wherever there's NFT demand, as you would expect.
00:33:38.390 - 00:34:30.510, Speaker A: One of the features we were talking about earlier is like, how do we get privacy on chain? So we're talking about aztec. This is another interesting solution to privacy on chain. It's privacy, it's also identity. Polygon just unveiled an identity service that leverages ZK proofs. So this is the ability to check credentials of an individual polygon user without revealing private information. Kind of useful. Also, I think my take on this too is that some of these side chains and ecosystems like polygons and these L2s are going to compete by adding on interesting services, right? So this is like a L2 sidechain adding identity as a service on top of their chain.
00:34:30.510 - 00:35:02.430, Speaker A: Of course, Ethereum doesn't have that natively baked into the protocol. Some chains L2s might decide to add oracles, for instance, price oracles. I think this is going to be an evolving landscape of all of these L2s and side chains kind of competing on the feature level in order to win against the competition, because it's a pretty competitive world out there, survival of the fittest, and so everyone's trying to carve out their niche in their area. I think adding features like identity are one such way to do that. What's your take?
00:35:02.580 - 00:35:38.374, Speaker B: Unlocking and solving identity in ways that developers can build on that and build just using that. Identity primitive is going to unlock so many use cases, some we already know about, but many, many more we don't know about because we haven't had that unlock yet. So many people are working on this. Polygon is working on this, Disco XYZ is working on this. Identity as a primitive is absolutely massive and it's really going to be one of the things that elevates the metaverse to the next level. This is kind of why some people are starting to meme social summer 2022. They're seeing the writing on the wall is the infrastructure is starting to be built out yet.
00:35:38.374 - 00:35:43.786, Speaker B: I think summer is a little bit early, but like social web3, it's on the horizon and it's going to be great.
00:35:43.968 - 00:36:19.102, Speaker A: Yeah, it's fascinating to me that all of these features seem to be being built on the execution layer as well. We'll never see an identity service on Ethereum main chain. We'll probably never see like a centralized oracle service on Ethereum main chain either, which is in my opinion a good thing. Keeps the protocol, base level protocol less complicated. BNB, formerly binance chain, they are launching application specific side chains to reduce network strain. So this is BNB chain, which is a side chain, also launching side chain. What's a side chain?
00:36:19.246 - 00:36:21.830, Speaker B: Okay, right. That's a semantic semantics thing, right?
00:36:21.900 - 00:36:51.422, Speaker A: What is a side chain? Right. And I don't personally see b and B as kind of competitive with more decentralized even layer ones, but even alternative layer ones, it's like 21 validators, all of which are mostly owned or somehow carteled by finance. So effectively, to me this is a side chain. Some might call it an alternative layer one semantics. But it's funny that they are expanding by launching other side chains, right?
00:36:51.476 - 00:37:08.838, Speaker B: As soon as BNB chain gets congested and demand in too much demand, they start to become modular. So plus one to the modular blockchain thesis, this is what this is. Centralized version of modular blockchains. Probably has a niche to fill, I.
00:37:08.844 - 00:37:24.860, Speaker A: Guess this is less modular. Blockchain to me like modular blockchain to me is where you're actually building a stack in modules. This is like a network of monolithic blockchains to me. You're just like stringing together monolithic blockchains as side.
00:37:25.790 - 00:37:32.650, Speaker B: It's a small step on the spectrum of modularization towards the modular side. But yeah, it's like one step on a very long journey. You're right.
00:37:32.800 - 00:37:35.534, Speaker A: Why not be a L2? I don't know. You could do that too.
00:37:35.572 - 00:37:38.666, Speaker B: They don't want to bend the knee. Opera don't like bending knees.
00:37:38.778 - 00:38:05.400, Speaker A: Opera taking a giant leap into web3. They are adding salana, polygon, Starkx and others. This is opera, the browser. It's like a low percentage of market share browser. It's like 2%, let's call it browser. But what I love about this is the other web3 friendly browser is brave. And now we have Opera and we have brave and they're both competing against one another in a race to build features fastest, where Google Chrome just sits there and is like, I have all the markets here, I don't have to do anything.
00:38:05.400 - 00:38:16.380, Speaker A: I'm just like the incumbent here. And these two browsers are like battling it out to be the winner of the web3 movement and the change that's happening.
00:38:16.830 - 00:38:46.146, Speaker B: Web three integrated web3 native browsers has got to be the way forward in the browser landscape. It can't just be with extensions. And so I think we are on the very beginnings of a new age of what a browser actually looks like. And like you said, it's just opera and just brave. And opera is doing things that brave's not doing. So, like, opera kind of like the dark horse browser, I guess because they were basically in last, in terms of market share, they had to kind of do something, but they're doing the right things. So, like, nice job.
00:38:46.248 - 00:38:56.994, Speaker A: I always thought it would be cool for a wallet to become big enough to go back in the other direction, like go buy a browser or go build a browser or something like this metamask browser.
00:38:57.122 - 00:38:58.834, Speaker B: That's a great brand for a browser.
00:38:58.962 - 00:38:59.842, Speaker A: That'd be badass.
00:38:59.906 - 00:39:01.000, Speaker B: I would love that.
00:39:01.550 - 00:39:31.538, Speaker A: I don't know. Anyway, it's good to see we're starting to see it also, defi saver. So this is an app built on Maker. They are adding automated stop and loss and take profit options for maker vaults. What's cool here is just we don't talk about it very much, but on all of the base protocols, particularly ones that have been around for a long time, like Maker, an entire application infrastructure is being built out on top of these things to make the protocols easier. I think we've got something else on Maker later in the episode, but it's just cool to see.
00:39:31.624 - 00:39:35.826, Speaker B: Cool, yeah. Features being built into DeFi, more power for the users. You'll have to see it.
00:39:36.008 - 00:39:37.934, Speaker A: Raises, raises. Ready for raises. Raises.
00:39:37.982 - 00:39:39.414, Speaker B: Some big raises this week. Yeah.
00:39:39.532 - 00:39:43.106, Speaker A: A layer zero raise. $1 billion valuation.
00:39:43.218 - 00:39:47.366, Speaker B: Yeah. Ryan, I raised billion dollars for my podcast. Did you know, where do you think we got.
00:39:47.388 - 00:39:48.850, Speaker A: So that's how you afforded the arena?
00:39:48.930 - 00:39:50.120, Speaker B: That's exactly right.
00:39:50.970 - 00:39:58.810, Speaker A: Okay, so this is a 16 z FTX and sequoia leading $135,000,000 round for this layer zero thing. What is layer zero?
00:39:58.960 - 00:40:17.762, Speaker B: Layer Zero is, other than the bankless podcast. Exploring the culture behind the people behind projects rather than projects themselves, is also a blockchain interoperability network. It's like, considered layer zero, as in the subterranean network between blockchains it's kind of a semantics debate as whether that's a layer zero or just a different L2.
00:40:17.816 - 00:40:19.060, Speaker A: It's a bridge, man.
00:40:19.430 - 00:40:39.000, Speaker B: Just a bridge. But anyways, cross chain composability, layer zero enables developers to build decentralized applications that simply weren't possible before, says Ali, a general partner at Adrissen Horowitz. But yeah, I mean, if you believe in the blockchain, multi chain, polychain interoperability world, this would be right up your alley. This makes a ton of sense.
00:40:39.690 - 00:41:14.702, Speaker A: I'm bullish bridges in general. Bullish bridges. You know, in our conversation with Olaf, though, which. That episode is coming unreleased, not next Monday, but the Monday after. This is Olaf at Polychain. Actually, his thesis was that bridges could actually become competitive with L2s and layer ones and actually host their own applications, which was kind of a novel idea to me, but maybe explains the aspirations for a $1 billion valuation because this is definitely L2 territory now. It's like a $1 billion valuation.
00:41:14.702 - 00:41:18.502, Speaker A: We already have a unicorn in the bridge world, which is pretty crazy to see.
00:41:18.556 - 00:41:18.870, Speaker B: Yes.
00:41:18.940 - 00:41:29.258, Speaker A: Congrats to those guys, avalanche. They just launched 100 million dollar creator fund with Grimes. That's Elon Musk's. Are they still together? I think they are, yeah.
00:41:29.344 - 00:41:30.250, Speaker B: They're married, right?
00:41:30.320 - 00:41:30.794, Speaker A: Okay, cool.
00:41:30.832 - 00:41:34.310, Speaker B: Yeah, they named their kid hello. Weird.
00:41:34.470 - 00:41:44.394, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. That's all I remember. Anyway, Grimes is in it. It's a web3 platform. What's interesting about this story, David?
00:41:44.522 - 00:42:14.614, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is 100 million dollar fund coming out of the Avax token and they are just building out web3 social. Open op three n. Kind of in the same vein as the web3 social that we talked about just a second ago. But also on the panel that we had 100 million dollar initiative for creatives to build projects on avalanche as the blockchain network grows its profile with non crypto natives. That is the story. I got some takes about the token, Ryan, tell me about the takes.
00:42:14.812 - 00:42:33.786, Speaker A: My only first take is like, web3 social is hot. This has a little bit of. Do you remember when eos, the US platform, announced voice, right, and they bought like a domain name and everything and they invested millions of dollars. It wasn't $100 million at that time. It was less. Now we're at $100 million. But what do you think this means for the token for Avalanche?
00:42:33.818 - 00:42:54.622, Speaker B: Okay, look at that next paragraph. Named the Culture Catalyst Initiative. The first of these funded projects paid out of the network's native token, Avax. Right. So this wasn't a raise really. Actually, this was just a token sale of $100 million of the Avax token to fund this initiative. Ryan, do you know the inflation rate for the avalanche blockchain and the Avax token?
00:42:54.686 - 00:43:00.374, Speaker A: Why don't you tell me? Because it's hard to divine that. I've looked in a few places, haven't been able to figure it out yet.
00:43:00.412 - 00:43:49.698, Speaker B: According to Mizari, the Avax token is inflating at 26% per year. And so that means that in order to sustain its current price, 26% of the value of the market cap of avalanche needs to be turned into buying demand for Avax to maintain its current price. At the same time, they are selling the Avax token to fund all these development initiatives, investments, investments into the ecosystem. You got to invest in yourself to grow out the ecosystem. But I'm just getting flashbacks of the 2017 Ethereum ICO mania where so many icos had just stockpiles and stockpiles of ether. And that is the reason why ether went from one $400 down to $90. Because so many icos had to sell their ether to pay for taxes, just to sell it at all, just to give to fund their teams consensus had to do this to stay alive.
00:43:49.698 - 00:44:06.166, Speaker B: And so I'm seeing the inflation rate of Avax, which if Missari is correct, at 26.6%, and they're doing all of these raises by selling the token. And that is a lot of selling pressure, bro. How is that getting absorbed?
00:44:06.358 - 00:44:41.922, Speaker A: That's the thing, I think that people need to remember that issuance isn't free money, it's selling pressure. Issuance is selling pressure ultimately, and at some point that can catch up to you. And so the thing is, I guess maybe the lesson is not never do this sort of thing, but make sure when you do it, you're very strategic and you've got a return on capital story. But that is a lot of issuance. And some people might say, well, this is the problem with Ethereum. Ethereum never does these sorts of investments. That's why more like centralized alternatives like avalanche and Terra will overtake Ethereum.
00:44:41.922 - 00:44:46.230, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't know if I'd buy that. I guess we'll have to see what happens.
00:44:46.300 - 00:45:15.146, Speaker B: I mean, they can definitely pay developers way better than the Ethereum ecosystem has because of decisions and actions like this, and also because they have just a ton of vc backing. If you go look at the Avax price chart, you don't need to pull it up. It doesn't look like there's any selling pressure. It's a bullish looking chart, which is kind of confusing to me. That is a discrepancy in my mind of the chart looking kind of bullish ish. But there's so much issuance, there's so much inflation. It's insane.
00:45:15.338 - 00:45:22.978, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see. Maybe. I don't know. Maybe that kind of thing doesn't really catch up to you. Unless there's a bear market shows up.
00:45:22.984 - 00:45:24.146, Speaker B: In bear markets, for sure.
00:45:24.248 - 00:45:38.530, Speaker A: If we're back in bull market territory, they may have a long Runway still. Let's talk about this. Delphi Digital, they just led a $5 million seed round for another money market protocol called ZK lend. This is on, I think, starkware.
00:45:38.610 - 00:45:39.490, Speaker B: Starkware.
00:45:39.570 - 00:45:41.820, Speaker A: Okay, starkware. What's this?
00:45:42.910 - 00:45:54.318, Speaker B: I'm assuming it's like, an Ave type compound money market, borrowing and lending, but on a ZK roll up. So lower transaction fees, higher speeds, the things that we all know and love.
00:45:54.484 - 00:46:01.040, Speaker A: There's got to be some consolidation here at some point in time. Does every single chain, every single piece of technology need its own money market?
00:46:02.610 - 00:46:19.346, Speaker B: As soon as there are ZKE evms, then things like Ave, which have been battle tested and hardened and have also been progressing in their own roadmaps, can just deploy there, too. So lots of competition to be had. And you know what happens when there's a lot of competition. Good things happen for the users.
00:46:19.458 - 00:46:39.286, Speaker A: That's true. That's true. Okay, let's talk about this last one. This is nifty chat. Yeah, nifty chat. I was actually in on this full disclosure, but they just raised a million dollars. And nifty chat is kind of cool because it's basically like discord and chat room meets web, three nfts.
00:46:39.286 - 00:47:10.710, Speaker A: So you can kind of go here, log in your NFT, and then you get like, let's say you have a cryptopunk, right? It will pull the fact that you have a crypto punk and create a cryptopunk specific chat room, or, like, mini discord for you, which is kind of neat. There's another app that does this, too, called Metalink, which I also like, but it's kind of cool, right? It's going to give discord, I think, run for its money, which needs to start adding some NFT features. Remember they tried to do that and then backed off of it a few months ago?
00:47:10.780 - 00:47:20.486, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. So can, like, put on my cryptopunk hat and chat as my cryptopunk and then rip off my cryptopunk mask and put on my Mfer hat and then chat as a different account. Is that how this works?
00:47:20.588 - 00:47:29.222, Speaker A: Yeah, and it's pretty cool. The idea is trying to bring these communities together, too. So it's like you and all the crypto punks. And if I don't have a crypto punk, I can't get in. I'm not welcome to the chat. I'm not the party man.
00:47:29.276 - 00:47:32.458, Speaker B: No, I don't have a crypto punk. I do not have a crypto punk.
00:47:32.474 - 00:47:44.554, Speaker A: Yeah, but I do have an MFEr, so I could come chat with you there. Jobs time. This is the time of the week where David and I remind you to get a job in crypto if you haven't already. Go get a job in crypto.
00:47:44.602 - 00:47:47.026, Speaker B: It's fun over here. It's a good time. We have a good time.
00:47:47.128 - 00:47:50.834, Speaker A: It's real fun. It's real fun. We're buying arenas over here.
00:47:51.032 - 00:47:52.850, Speaker B: You too can buy an arena.
00:47:53.670 - 00:48:06.898, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about it. A few jobs. We're going to read them out because these are hot. A co founder for an innovative omni chain, Defi Primitive. This is ominous. Who is the hire to be announced in Paris?
00:48:06.994 - 00:48:07.750, Speaker B: Oh, okay.
00:48:07.820 - 00:48:26.826, Speaker A: This sounds too good to be true. Wow. So go check out that job description. Masari is hiring a blockchain engineer for Daos. A software engineer for market data Syndicate is hiring an operations manager, smart Defi, senior product designer. Senior go rust engineer at Syndica, senior full stack engineer. Syndica, senior software engineer.
00:48:26.826 - 00:48:46.194, Speaker A: Airdrop Labs, product manager at Nori Bankless, web developer for bankless. A bankless editor for bankless as well. Community manager for bankless Academy. I could go on. We've got uniswap Labs listings, Ethereum foundation listings, a whole lot more. Go check out the bankless job board. Here's the thing.
00:48:46.232 - 00:48:52.370, Speaker B: For those that are curious, this is actually how I dance in the club. So you'll be able to see that at permissionless at our party.
00:48:52.530 - 00:49:05.322, Speaker A: I can't wait to see that in person. Look, this job board really works, too. This is somebody from smart d five saying bankless was responsible for over 75% of our core team hires across all positions. It's pretty cool.
00:49:05.376 - 00:49:27.854, Speaker B: It felt like using cheat codes. You can't leave that part out, Ryan. It felt like using cheat codes. Yeah. Just letting me know that the talent that is listening to bankless is significant. And if you want to tap into some of that talent, the jobs board is a place where you can, as a talented person, post your resume with a talent collective or as a employer and post your job. There's a link in the show notes.
00:49:27.982 - 00:49:32.594, Speaker A: Yeah, very cool. Let's keep going here. David, you ready for news time?
00:49:32.632 - 00:49:35.406, Speaker B: Yeah. This is definitely the news of the week other than the banquet.
00:49:35.438 - 00:49:43.622, Speaker A: Serena, big news of the week. All right, take a breath with me. $600 million. Probably over $600 million.
00:49:43.676 - 00:49:45.560, Speaker B: That's like three stadiums this week.
00:49:46.650 - 00:50:10.446, Speaker A: Yeah. The Ronan Bridge has been exploited for 173,000 ETH and 25 million USDC. The Ronan Bridge, of course, is a side chain that axe has been building out, responsible, I think, for a lot of axe growth over the last twelve to 18 months after it launched. Like, cheap transactions. But what happened here, David, tell us the story.
00:50:10.548 - 00:50:38.578, Speaker B: Yes. So this was not a smart contract exploit. This was not a bridge exploit of the actual bridge. What happened here was that this bridge was a multisig bridge, which is relatively common, and there was a five of nine multisig that controls the bridge. It just so happens that the private keys. This was basically a private key theft. So the attacker, the exploiter, found a way into the nodes that actually maintain the keys.
00:50:38.578 - 00:51:05.538, Speaker B: So rather than just, like, having these seed phrases written down somewhere, the way that this bridge maintained, I'm assuming, or at least this is in the spirit of accuracy. The details are to be determined, but these are, like, nodes in the cloud. And these nodes, these five of nine nodes, or the validator nodes for the Bridge, are verifying transactions, making transactions to make this bridge work. But the private keys are in the nodes. They're in the cloud. And so the attacker was able to.
00:51:05.624 - 00:51:06.846, Speaker A: They're, like, in hot wallets.
00:51:06.878 - 00:51:31.782, Speaker B: They're hot wallets. Yeah. Five of them. And the attacker was able to access the cloud servers, the nodes, directly, and just basically get five of the nine multisig private keys. So basically, there was no malicious attack. There was no just, like, smart contract exploit. The attacker just got all of the private keys, and so then he just withdrew all of the ether and USDC down to the main chain.
00:51:31.782 - 00:51:39.882, Speaker B: And so we haven't really seen an attack like that because it's pretty easy to secure that. This is kind of like one on one security, I think.
00:51:39.936 - 00:51:52.954, Speaker A: Well, people remember the last bridge hack, which actually wasn't that long ago, which was the wormhole bridge hack. What was that? Like, $200 million? This is a bridge from Ethereum to Salana, something like that. And that was actually a smart contract code hack?
00:51:53.002 - 00:51:54.134, Speaker B: Yes. That was a bud.
00:51:54.282 - 00:51:55.714, Speaker A: This was not that.
00:51:55.832 - 00:51:58.398, Speaker B: This was multi sig theft of private keys.
00:51:58.494 - 00:52:07.666, Speaker A: This is. We got your private keys type of hack. So I think a lot of implications from that that we should probably talk about the first one.
00:52:07.688 - 00:52:11.826, Speaker B: Ryan, pop quiz. Do L2 roll ups have private keys?
00:52:12.018 - 00:52:14.354, Speaker A: They do not, sir. They do not have private keys.
00:52:14.402 - 00:52:17.282, Speaker B: They do have upgrade contracts, which is an asterisk. So there's.
00:52:17.346 - 00:52:43.002, Speaker A: Yes. Well, I mean, this is kind of a lesson, I think maybe we'll get to the learning lessons later, but this is a lesson on sidechain security for the crypto ecosystem, maybe a very difficult lesson to learn, but let's talk about this, too. So hacker goes, steals $600 million. The crazy thing about this is imagine you're a bank robber, and you go and you steal from a bank.
00:52:43.146 - 00:52:45.442, Speaker B: But what's the last thing you do?
00:52:45.576 - 00:53:06.598, Speaker A: Well, what you're doing, everything you do with that money is like. It's as if you're broadcast on YouTube, live streamed, like, whatever you do. So everyone knows what you're doing with the money. We can't get to you, but we know what you're about to do. We can watch it, and that's what's happening. We can actually see what this hacker is doing with the $600 million.
00:53:06.684 - 00:53:36.450, Speaker B: Okay, so you're a bank robber. You steal $600 million from a bank. What the attacker does next is he deposits all of this. I don't know if all the money, but a lot of this money into FTX. That's like a bank robber robbing $600 million and going to a different bank and depositing it while being live streamed. Okay, so why did the attacker do this? People have come to the conclusion that this is not just some novice, oh, I get to have this money now. I'll send it to FTX and cash it out.
00:53:36.450 - 00:53:49.538, Speaker B: No, what's very likely happening is that the account that it was deposited to in FTX was, like, purchased. Right. It was somebody else's account that they got the password or email address for. So they were able to access somebody else's KYC.
00:53:49.634 - 00:53:50.230, Speaker A: Fake id.
00:53:50.300 - 00:54:12.282, Speaker B: Fake id. Right. And then maybe, I don't know what they were doing in there. I can't imagine that they sent it outbound to a bank account because they have to send it to their bank account if they want the money. What is more likely happened is they sent it into FTX and then withdrew it from FTX, which made it invisible to the chain, but it made it very visible to FTX. So FTX knows where this money. We actually.
00:54:12.282 - 00:54:22.046, Speaker B: There was a tweet out of Sam Bankman fried that said, I acknowledge that this is happening. We are investigating and taking action if and where appropriate. So they're up to something.
00:54:22.228 - 00:55:06.922, Speaker A: It just doesn't seem like a good strategy, though. I don't know. You go steal from a bank, and then you deposit it into another bank, and the other bank knows, has your funds for some period of time. Maybe it's been withdrawn, but sort of knows all of your transaction history, can freeze your account, can track this down. I don't know if this is a good way to escape with the money, and that's kind of the flaw, I guess, if you are a black hat crypto hacker right now, it's not easy to go hack money in crypto, but we see these things every week. This is just one of the biggest. But if you're smart enough to hack, are you smart enough to get away with it, too? Get away with the money and somehow withdraw it? We haven't seen many hackers complete that last circuit.
00:55:06.986 - 00:55:22.222, Speaker B: No, definitely not. The other very interesting thing about this story that is just a complete curveball. Ryan. The ronan side chain was exploited. This hack happened on March 23. Wednesday, March 23. No one noticed until the 29th.
00:55:22.286 - 00:55:23.410, Speaker A: I forgot about that.
00:55:23.480 - 00:55:28.114, Speaker B: Six days later, people. No one noticed when somebody tried to withdraw.
00:55:28.162 - 00:55:32.354, Speaker A: They were like, somebody trying to withdraw my eth, and it's failing.
00:55:32.402 - 00:55:33.014, Speaker B: Yeah. Why?
00:55:33.132 - 00:55:37.574, Speaker A: The eth's not there. It's not in the bridge vault anymore. Right.
00:55:37.612 - 00:55:48.540, Speaker B: And so people were probably sending eth into the chain, because that was probably fine, but, like, getting back out, there was an empty vault. Six days. $600 million went missing for six days.
00:55:50.670 - 00:55:51.542, Speaker A: Crypto.
00:55:51.686 - 00:56:11.682, Speaker B: There's a joke going around Twitter. I think Kobe was the spawn of this joke where he said, oh, yeah, I noticed that the ronan side chain got hacked. Therefore, I went and shorted axe, but then the token pumped, and it pumped, and I got liquidated. Because no one noticed. Right, exactly. Sorry for the laughter. That's $600 million.
00:56:11.682 - 00:56:24.390, Speaker B: A lot of people have lost money. Axi has stated that they are going to reimburse people. I don't know how they're going to do that, but they have stated that that is their intentions. It's always unfortunate when we see $600 million getting lost.
00:56:26.570 - 00:56:37.974, Speaker A: That is the reason I'm laughing, though, is because I expect everyone to be reimbursed. I mean, axe has massively deep pockets, and we've seen this before, right, with the Salana wormhole hack. True. Everyone was just reimbursed.
00:56:38.022 - 00:56:42.330, Speaker B: Is this ultimately just coming out of a 16 z? Is a 16 z footing the bill for this one?
00:56:42.400 - 00:56:59.838, Speaker A: I don't know, actually. I actually think that what will happen is they'll get the money back, because the black hat hacker will find it's impossible to actually. And so we'll cut a deal in some fashion, or it'll get frozen. I think they'll get their money back. But if not. Yeah, then I suppose that comes out of somebody's treasury.
00:56:59.934 - 00:57:05.830, Speaker B: Give $580,000,000 back and have $20 million, your life is going to be the same.
00:57:05.980 - 00:57:09.634, Speaker A: Black hats. It's easy. Don't be greedy. Okay, congrats.
00:57:09.762 - 00:57:18.950, Speaker B: Congrats. You pulled it off. Give it back. Take the $20 million or whatever number you can settle with, and then have a good life.
00:57:19.100 - 00:57:25.782, Speaker A: Well, some people are worried because this is not the only side chain, of course. With a bridge, there are many, one of which is Polygon.
00:57:25.846 - 00:57:26.122, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:26.176 - 00:57:27.114, Speaker A: And so this is from.
00:57:27.152 - 00:57:27.542, Speaker B: Oops.
00:57:27.606 - 00:57:28.662, Speaker A: Account muted.
00:57:28.806 - 00:57:33.694, Speaker B: Chris Black. I also have it muted, by the way.
00:57:33.892 - 00:57:52.174, Speaker A: Polygon is secured by a five of nine multi sig, just like the Ronan network, he says. And they've refused many, many times to answer any questions about how these keys are secured. Somebody from the polygon team, that's a legitimate concern. Okay. If this can happen to Ronan, can this happen to Polygon in the same way? Why don't you read the response, David?
00:57:52.222 - 00:58:18.086, Speaker B: Yeah. This is somebody who's on the Polygon team. So has actual information about this CISO, chief security officer or something. I don't know. Says polygon keys are secured in a very different way than Ronin. All polygon keys are on offline hardware wallets, like a ledger, not on a server connected to the Internet, which is the vehicle for exploit of the ronin sidechain. For that reason, cold storage.
00:58:18.086 - 00:58:36.706, Speaker B: Good. Like how it should be. For that reason, it's impossible to do a ronin like attack on polygon. And this person continues in the next tweet. No backup is stored digitally on a device connected to the Internet. Unfortunately, there's no way for me to prove this to you, so you just have to take my word for. So, like, obviously, the just have to take my word for.
00:58:36.706 - 00:59:11.580, Speaker B: It is kind of like a hotline in trustless crypto. We don't want to trust people. It just needs to be the way that it is. But also, we can't have the details of the polygon security mechanism public on Twitter, because then that just informs the attackers on how to do it. So it's appropriate that this is not information that's publicly known, because then that is a risk vector. So, in my mind, the current state of polygon security, if it is indeed in offline cold storage wallets, that perhaps not all of the multi six signers know the locations of the other multi six signers. That makes sense.
00:59:11.580 - 00:59:20.830, Speaker B: As far as we can tell, the security for polygon is grade A level security. They've done it right, and they're taking it seriously. Yeah.
00:59:20.900 - 01:00:16.698, Speaker A: It's got to be better than Ronan. But also, I think there are some learning lessons here, right? And the top learning lesson for everyone listening is side chains do not inherit the security of the base chain. Okay, so let me just repeat that for a second. Side chains do not inherit the security of the base chain. So if you move your assets from something like ethereum to another chain, and if that's a side chain, realize that you are incurring some risk in that move, in that transaction. You are now in a different security paradigm than you were. And I think this is just like, I'm very careful with what I do on side chains, right? It's like, I know some of the risks, and I'm not going to be, like, putting my net worth on a side chain or significant amount of my net worth on a side chain at this point in time.
01:00:16.698 - 01:00:45.260, Speaker A: I think at some level, the same goes for L2s. I mean, they don't have the Lindy. So just be careful where you're moving your money and your assets. The second thing I think I took away from this is, again, a reflection that it's really hard for hackers to get away with funds on chain. Right. In this case, I don't know that the hacker is going to be able to get away with it. And they really weren't in the Wormhell coal case, either.
01:00:45.260 - 01:01:32.266, Speaker A: And then the third thing, I don't know if this is a good lesson for us to take away, but it is a lesson that the market's taking away is that if the chain is capitalized well enough, the pockets are deep enough, you got some of that vc money, you got a nice treasury. Then when something bad happens, oftentimes people get reimbursed. Is that a good thing? Is that a bad thing? Like, I'm happy for the scenario, but it does set a precedent where people sort of expect to be reimbursed, and we tend to become more reliant on this trust dependency here. Some people say that's a feature, some people that it's a bug. I think it depends. I sure wouldn't want to see that on layer one chain. I guess on a side chain, maybe that's a compromise that you're willing to make.
01:01:32.266 - 01:01:40.860, Speaker A: But I do get worried when everyone expects a bail, starts to expect a bailout. There's a big enough amount of money that's lost where it can't be bailed out.
01:01:41.470 - 01:02:02.798, Speaker B: I guess it's appropriate for bailouts to happen in the beginning stages of this whole bridging bridge or ecosystem. As bridges get more hardened, as users get more informed. We would probably simultaneously expect bailouts to happen less and less and less, but we are at the very beginning stages. So I guess bailouts are appropriate, but we don't know if there's a bailout coming on this one. That seems. That's just speculation.
01:02:02.974 - 01:02:07.380, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a promise from Axe, but, yeah, we don't know the mechanics of it.
01:02:08.550 - 01:02:39.358, Speaker B: Just to wrap up this conversation, just some market chatter, the ronin token, the Ron token was $2.40 before the hack, and it is now currently at $1.0.70. So down like 30 ish percent. Not that crazy for how big of a loss it was. The AXS token, kind of unfazed, really. It's mostly just down 4% or it's up 9% in seven days, which is a little bit nuts, but it peaked at $72. And then the hack happened, and now it's at like $63.
01:02:39.444 - 01:02:47.970, Speaker A: Look, this is the market telling us it's not really worried about this event. Market saying it's going to get resolved without big losses, big incident.
01:02:48.550 - 01:02:49.810, Speaker B: That's a big hack.
01:02:51.110 - 01:03:15.082, Speaker A: All right, let's move on. Let's talk about some Ethereum stuff. David and I think it's time to clear out some misconceptions here. And we want to do a few misconceptions. The first, there are some misconceptions going on about the merge right now, and we're going through a tweet thread from Trent Van Epps, but I think we're going to focus on maybe five things. Five misconceptions of the Merge. Do you want to take the first one?
01:03:15.136 - 01:03:34.190, Speaker B: Yeah. The first one is that stakers get unburnt fees. And so not all of ether is burnt in a transaction fee. And in proof of stake, it actually doesn't change. Versus proof of work versus proof of stake. EIP 1559, on average, burns about 75% of a transaction fee. In the future, stakers will get this 30%.
01:03:34.190 - 01:03:39.646, Speaker B: So unburnt fees, tips on the execution layer will be sent to stakers.
01:03:39.838 - 01:03:47.670, Speaker A: That's pretty awesome. I don't know that many people know that post merge, if you stake, you actually get those tips. You get the transaction fees, passive income.
01:03:48.250 - 01:03:57.202, Speaker B: In addition to new ether that's minted as a block reward. You also get 30% of all transaction fees, which in bull markets can be very significant.
01:03:57.346 - 01:04:15.866, Speaker A: Absolutely. The second thing wanted to highlight this is a misconception. A lot of people think that once the merge happens that they will be able to withdraw their ETH from the staking contract. Can't not post merge. Okay. Not immediately post merge. I should say so.
01:04:15.866 - 01:04:27.838, Speaker A: Staking an ETH right now is a one way ticket. It still will be post merge. You will not be able to withdraw your ETH post merge. There will be another update that happens. I don't know. This could be three months later. Six months later.
01:04:27.924 - 01:04:30.066, Speaker B: Six is longer information that I've heard. Yeah.
01:04:30.168 - 01:04:48.194, Speaker A: So we'll have to see how long it takes. But at that point in time, you will be able to withdraw. Not immediately. I think there's some pros to this, which is a lot of people are saying, well, post merge, a bunch of the staked ETH is going to get sold. No, it's still going to be locked. It's going to be locked up. But also keep in mind that when you stake that ETH is going to be locked.
01:04:48.194 - 01:04:53.834, Speaker A: It's a one way ticket. You're not going to be able to withdraw your ETH post merge. So that's the second misconception to clear up.
01:04:53.872 - 01:05:23.380, Speaker B: Yeah. The alpha here is that post merge, there is zero net new ether introduced into the secondary market. The block reward issuance is going to stakers, which is locked because they can't withdraw. The fees are going to stakers, which is locked because they can't withdraw. The reason why they can't withdraw is just reduced complexity one step at a time. This is a very big deal to merge to proof of stake. And so we're just keeping it simple, doing one thing at a time, letting things sit, letting things stabilize, and then the withdrawals will be unlocked roughly six months later.
01:05:23.380 - 01:05:46.966, Speaker B: In that time, in that six months, staking the yield on staking goes from like 5% to probably like 15%. And the demand to stake will be three x because the yields are going to be three times higher. And so there's going to be three times more demand to stake ether, pull ether out of the secondary market to stake it, and no ability to withdraw for six months. Bullish. Bullish.
01:05:47.158 - 01:05:53.354, Speaker A: I think so as well. Why don't you take the next one? Number three, third misconception, the merge will.
01:05:53.392 - 01:06:09.810, Speaker B: Not reduce gas fees. I think people got this conflated when we started talking about Ethereum two versus Ethereum one. And once we merge, we're at Ethereum two, that's no longer the case. Sharding will reduce gas fees, but that's later. That is phase two. This is currently phase one, which is the merge. So the merge is not going to reduce gas fees.
01:06:10.630 - 01:06:23.606, Speaker A: I'll take the next one. This is just a reminder. I think if you've been listening to bankless, you probably know this, but the ETH issuance is about to drop from 4.3% in proof of work to 00:40 3%.
01:06:23.708 - 01:06:25.000, Speaker B: That's a smaller number.
01:06:25.530 - 01:06:33.494, Speaker A: It's crazy though. 4.3% to 00:40 3%. This is far lower than bitcoin. Like post havenings.
01:06:33.542 - 01:06:36.166, Speaker B: It'll take the lowest of any blockchain.
01:06:36.358 - 01:06:57.090, Speaker A: Lowest of any blockchain, and at zero point 43%, a significant portion of that is going to be burnt. That's where we get to ultrasound money deflationary ETH as an asset. Because if the amount of ETH burnt exceeds 4.3%, then we're in deflationary territory. Negative ETH burnt on the year. So think about that. 4.3%
01:06:57.090 - 01:07:02.370, Speaker A: to zero point 43%. That is the ETH issuance in the post merge world.
01:07:02.520 - 01:07:42.606, Speaker B: You want to do some comparisons, Ryan? The current ETH issuance rate inflation rate is 4.3%. As you just said, salana is a little bit above 9% in inflation rate. And avalanche, as we said earlier, is at 26% inflation rate. Both Salana and avalanche are proof of stake, but their much higher issuance rate comes from the centralized, monolithic blockchains that they have. They have so much throughput that they need to issue a ton of currency in order to secure that very high rate of block space issuance. The more you create block space, the more you have to spend on security because you have more block space to secure because they are very, very high throughput blockchains. Because they're centralized, they have to issue a ton.
01:07:42.606 - 01:08:16.330, Speaker B: Ethereum is much more limited in block space because we want to maintain decentralization at the base layer. That's how you do that. Therefore it doesn't have to issue as much. So it's as low as 4.3%. The point though, Ryan, of why I'm doing this is that this is comparison 4.3% of Ethereum in proof of work mode in comparison to other proof of stake blockchains. And so when Ethereum joins Salana and Avalanche in proof of stake, it's going to be zero point 43% inflation rate on ether versus Salana's inflation rate of 9% versus avalanche's inflation rate of 26%.
01:08:16.330 - 01:08:18.310, Speaker B: We are in different categories, killer.
01:08:18.390 - 01:08:19.946, Speaker A: It's different categories, man.
01:08:19.968 - 01:08:23.050, Speaker B: And that's not including the burn. That's not including the burn.
01:08:23.570 - 01:08:28.350, Speaker A: Let's talk about the fifth misconception. And why don't you do this last one?
01:08:28.500 - 01:09:01.158, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a good one. Running a node post merge does not require any ETH. You can be either a staking, validating node and you can add transactions to the blockchain, or you can be a listening node and you can send your own transactions to the mempool via your own node. But you do not. In order to run your own node, you do not need to add any ETH to it. It is free and accessible to anyone to run a node. Do you know that's not actually true, Ryan, for avalanche? I know I'm trying to not be an east maxi here, but in order to run a node on avalanche and.
01:09:01.164 - 01:09:02.186, Speaker A: Be a validator, you have to be.
01:09:02.208 - 01:09:22.058, Speaker B: A validator in order to access the mempool and see what's going on in the mempool. To participate in, you have to stake avalanche tokens, which is reminiscent to order flow for people that own the shares of the network. It's concerning to me as to the gating of that information away from the public, because the public can't run their own avalanche node.
01:09:22.234 - 01:09:40.470, Speaker A: Yeah, I am also concerned about that. But this point is really important because some people say no. Well, it's going to cost thousands of dollars worth of ETh to run a node. No, it's not. It just costs hardware and anyone can run it from a consumer machine. That's, by the way, always been a case. Anyone can run a node on Ethereum today.
01:09:40.470 - 01:09:51.882, Speaker A: Just go download Geth and set it up dap node or something else. David, you know what's cool about these misconceptions is they're starting to fade on the institutional side. Okay?
01:09:52.016 - 01:09:53.706, Speaker B: People are starting to get it.
01:09:53.808 - 01:10:30.646, Speaker A: I don't have a Bloomberg terminal or a subscription or whatever is required, but there is now an analyst at Bloomberg who covers Ethereum and he is writing some fire content about Ethereum. And there are a few articles that someone forwarded me this week. This is one on how Ethereum is transitioning to a global asset. This article absolutely nails it. There's another article on how the DCF model suggests the network asset for Ethereum ETH is undervalued. We just did some episodes with Ryan, Alice and others on the DCF model.
01:10:30.828 - 01:10:33.654, Speaker B: We did our DCF model with Justin Drake over a year ago.
01:10:33.772 - 01:10:35.686, Speaker A: Yes, we did that year ago, our.
01:10:35.708 - 01:10:38.630, Speaker B: Conclusion was that I think Ether might be undervalued.
01:10:38.970 - 01:11:06.730, Speaker A: This is what this analyst says, too conservatively. Ether could be worth 6100. Well, you plug in whatever numbers in the DCF and you spit something out, but it's sure a lot higher than it is today, depending on the numbers you put in. But like any obvious number, it'll be higher. And then here's an entire Bloomberg article on the merge, how the merge will be a super catalyst. I guess all this to say is the institutions are starting to get it. And it's funny to me because we've been talking about the value proposition.
01:11:06.730 - 01:11:41.638, Speaker A: ETH is a triple point money for probably two years. I would say longer than that if you go back, but on bankless for about two years. And it's interesting to me to see kind of the lag time of institutions starting to get on board and starting to understand these narratives. This is from our friends at one river asset management, and they bought one of the biggest bitcoin buys in history about a year and a half ago. They are an institutional hedge fund who is now very crypto focused. This is what they say about ether. Ether is being transformed into a low risk bond asset, and it is cheap.
01:11:41.638 - 01:12:08.920, Speaker A: Remember Ethereum, the Internet bond? Remember all those articles we wrote about? Remember what we were talking about? I remember the largest institutional investors are now saying it, okay, it is increasingly clear, this is a quote that the future of finance runs on Ethereum. With ETH as a reserve asset to the ecosystem, the institutions are now repeating it. The narrative is cementing still an early set of institutions, but it's out there now. We did our job.
01:12:09.370 - 01:12:58.190, Speaker B: One of the things I've been hammering about as to one of the most underappreciated aspects of proof of stake with EIP one five nine, and basically Ethereum versus bitcoin is like. Bitcoin is really hard to value. It's hard to put like numbers and models around demand for bitcoin. It's just like, do you take it on faith that people value? This is really the bitcoin investment thesis. With Ethereum, you have the issuance rate, you have the burn rate, you have the stake rate, you have active addresses in DeFi, you have demand for ether. In DeFi, there's so many metrics and numbers, especially when, first off, the appropriate numbers to actually make a DCF analysis, which is very comfy zone for institutions. But the sheer number of just things to measure metrics for ether, the asset just is enabling institutions to be comfortable.
01:12:58.190 - 01:13:12.366, Speaker B: It makes it feel like it's in their wheelhouse, which kind of is. And it's definitely one of the most bullish things about ether is like, you can actually reason about it with metrics and numbers rather than just assuming that there's going to be sufficient demand for an asset.
01:13:12.498 - 01:13:28.480, Speaker A: Yeah, they're like, oh, yeah, we know bonds, we know equities, and we know capital assets. Oh, and this thing performs like a bond, like an equity, like a capital asset. Okay, we can value that thing. And oops, when we plug it in the spreadsheet, it spits out a much higher price than the price of ETh. Now, that's what's going on.
01:13:28.850 - 01:13:32.670, Speaker B: Look at the words that they use. Low risk bond asset. And it is.
01:13:32.740 - 01:13:33.182, Speaker A: I know.
01:13:33.236 - 01:13:35.700, Speaker B: That's all you need to know. That's all you need to know.
01:13:37.670 - 01:14:09.530, Speaker A: Let's keep moving, though, because the merge is coming, and there's still a lot of misconceptions about this transition from proof of stake to proof of work. And I hope bankless listeners got a chance to tune into our episode with Lyn Alden and Justin Drake. That was kind of a debate on the merits of both sides we put together, and you wrote a post on bankless this week that dives into four misconceptions about proof of stake versus proof of work. And I think this is information that's worth getting out there. Why don't we hit all four of these points? David, what's the first one?
01:14:09.600 - 01:14:51.958, Speaker B: Yeah, the first one is the rich do not get richer in proof of stake. This is a common critique of proof of stake, is that it's a rich get richer system. And actually, it's completely the opposite. The fact that yield is baked into the asset allows everyone in the world to democratize access to the upside. So there is no difference in rate of return for somebody that invests $1 billion into ether versus $1 million into ether versus $1,000. Everyone gets the same rate of return. And actually, in proof of work, that is the actual rich get richer system, because of how much complexity and middlemen there are between $1 of capital and proof of work getting translated into $1 worth of hash power.
01:14:51.958 - 01:15:29.394, Speaker B: You got to invest in the ASICS, you got to invest in the mining facilities, you got to get the ASICs through the supply chains, you got to have relationships with manufacturers. You got to power your facility, you have to cool your facility. And all of these things have respond to economies of scale. And that means that there's significant competition around bitcoin miners, which bitcoiners really like, but it is actually indoctrinating who can invest more capital into proof of work most. So that's a misconception, number one. The next one is that proof of stake is like equity money and proof of work is commodity money. These are mental models, but in terms of actual definitions, it's not empirical.
01:15:29.394 - 01:15:58.666, Speaker B: There are no empirical definitions. So I go through this and I actually make the claim that ether has both commodity like and equity like characteristics, and bitcoin has mostly neither. And I explained in the article about that. So that's number two, proof of stake does not give governance powers to stakeholders. There is a difference between on chain governance and token vote governance and proof of stake. These are different things. There are systems that have on chain governance like Tezos and DCRed, and Tezos is proof of stake.
01:15:58.666 - 01:17:09.842, Speaker B: DCRED is a hybrid proof of work proof of stake. But the consensus mechanism and on chain governance are completely different things, and ethereum does not have on chain governance. And lastly, dealing with 51% attacks, how does a proof of work system deal with a 51% attack if the time comes? Basically the answer is if somebody can generate enough hash power to 51% attack a proof of work network, they have enough hash power to do it infinite in forever. So if the honest miners can't source enough honest hash power to overcome that 51% attack, that proof of work chain is dead because the attacker has enough hash power to attack it into infinity. The exact opposite thing is true with proof of stake, where if somebody is attacking the proof of stake network because ether is registered to Ethereum, unlike ASICs, ether is actually at a specific ethereum address, the network it can identify who is the attacking address, where is the attacking eth coming from, and we can coordinate around a fork to do something about that, whether it's forcibly exiting them from the validator queue or slashing their ether. It's just so much easier to discover and route around an attack in proof of stake than it is proof of work. So those are the four big misconceptions that I address in this article.
01:17:09.842 - 01:17:18.454, Speaker B: I did my best to make this extremely digestible, so I highly encourage everyone to go read it. If you are trying to get your learn on about why the hell we're doing this whole proof of stake thing in the first place.
01:17:18.652 - 01:18:23.342, Speaker A: I think there is a difference between sort of an opinion on proof of stake versus proof of work and which produces a better money. I think there can be some variation in opinion there, but there's also some fact that I think you lay out in these misconceptions, right? It's a fact that proof of stake is not more rich get richer than proof of work, right? And it's like empirically a fact that proof of work can lead to economies of scale that help the rich to get richer. So I think it's important when you're looking at this to separate the fact versus the opinion. And some of these misconceptions can be refuted just with like, hey, have you actually thought deeply about this? And here are the facts as we lay them out. Now, there are some disadvantages with proof of stake versus proof of work, like weak subjectivity. There's some more deeper answers to some of these things, but I don't think these misconceptions actually hold up under any scrutiny. Anyway, go take a look at that.
01:18:23.342 - 01:18:36.746, Speaker A: David, let's flip to some NFT stuff. A few things happened this week. Number one is Tiffany and company. Apparently they just acquired an NFT. So Tiffany and company. Tiffany rings, diamond rings and nfts.
01:18:36.778 - 01:18:49.350, Speaker B: I guess this is the same NFT that Budweiser bought. Like this is one of the rocket ones where you can kind of build your own rocket and each one has their own different brand. This seems so off brand for Tiffany, but the metaverse is weird, so. All right, cool.
01:18:49.420 - 01:19:02.170, Speaker A: Do you think somebody's like, there's some consultant out there who's like, hey, I have my ten easy steps to how a corporation can enter the NFT game and lays out exactly the strategy for what they should buy first.
01:19:02.240 - 01:19:24.690, Speaker B: Could you imagine being that consultant? Imagine this NFT on a PowerPoint is like, all right, like Tiffany board of directors, we're going to buy this NFT for the podcast listeners. This is a kind of a shittily drawn, excuse my language, a poorly drawn, hand drawn rocket with different components looks like a flash game from like the late, the early thousands. And now it's part of Tiffany and company.
01:19:24.840 - 01:19:30.882, Speaker A: Yeah, well, the consultant recommends you buy a cryptopunk or a board ape. That's what you should do next.
01:19:30.936 - 01:19:31.970, Speaker B: Or a stadium.
01:19:34.230 - 01:19:38.434, Speaker A: Budweiser. They have beer eth cans. Look at this, man.
01:19:38.472 - 01:19:40.858, Speaker B: Oh, that's a real can. I thought that was Photoshop.
01:19:40.974 - 01:19:41.974, Speaker A: Nah, that's a real can.
01:19:42.012 - 01:19:43.270, Speaker B: Oh, I gotta get one of those.
01:19:43.340 - 01:19:59.420, Speaker A: I don't know where you can get these. Okay, this is an NFT beer fest, so I don't think they're cranking these out of the factory. I don't think you can go to your supermarket and buy these, but they do exist. Beer eth, king of NFTs, Budweiser going all in with their ETH address. Right.
01:19:59.870 - 01:20:09.022, Speaker B: If I saw a beer eth on a beer can in my local supermarket, I would just absolutely die. That would be way too cool.
01:20:09.156 - 01:20:11.114, Speaker A: It might actually get me to drink a Budweise.
01:20:11.162 - 01:20:13.598, Speaker B: Oh, my God. It says the king of NFTs on it.
01:20:13.684 - 01:20:14.530, Speaker A: I know.
01:20:14.680 - 01:20:19.362, Speaker B: That's great. Oh, there's a GM badge. There's a GM badge right in the middle.
01:20:19.496 - 01:20:20.418, Speaker A: Where? Right?
01:20:20.504 - 01:20:26.866, Speaker B: Yeah, right in the center. That's great. Just. Well done, whoever's. Well, Budweiser is just killing the NFT game.
01:20:26.968 - 01:20:36.114, Speaker A: They totally are. Totally are putting craft beers to shame. Okay. Just crack open a bud. Bitcoin stuff. Okay. Macro strategy.
01:20:36.114 - 01:20:43.974, Speaker A: Macro strategy. Macro strategy. Yeah, macro strategy. A $205,000,000 loan. To do what? To buy bitcoin.
01:20:44.022 - 01:20:44.394, Speaker B: For who?
01:20:44.432 - 01:20:47.590, Speaker A: I saw this title and I was like, who is macro strategy?
01:20:47.670 - 01:20:48.966, Speaker B: Is this a typo?
01:20:49.158 - 01:20:56.078, Speaker A: Well, it turns out it's a subsidiary of microstrategy. It's Michael Saylor again.
01:20:56.164 - 01:20:56.830, Speaker B: He's here.
01:20:56.900 - 01:21:07.314, Speaker A: He's got a subsidiary of microstrategy. And when they asked him what we should name it, Michael, he said macro strategy. And he's using that to buy more bitcoin. Of course, dollar cost averaging in.
01:21:07.352 - 01:21:12.530, Speaker B: It's the perfect name. It's the perfect name. Michael Saylor living up to his total chadness.
01:21:13.510 - 01:21:41.030, Speaker A: $205,000,000 on a loan worth of bitcoin. I do still think that'll pay off for him. Let's talk about this. There was a campaign that launched this week called change the code, not the climate. You've heard bitcoin fuels the climate crisis. But did you know a software code change could clean it up? Wow, that sounds enticing. What can I do? How can I upgrade bitcoin and get rid of the environmental waste? Is that a way to do that? This is the campaign.
01:21:41.030 - 01:21:50.618, Speaker A: Estimates show bitcoin uses more electricity than all of Sweden. I mean, at a surface level, this is super damning, right? Bitcoin alone could help warm the planet by more than two degrees.
01:21:50.714 - 01:21:52.574, Speaker B: Love to see the details on that one.
01:21:52.692 - 01:22:25.862, Speaker A: Bitcoin is resurrecting fossil fuels. A software code could change it, could fix it by 99%. Why aren't they doing it? Right, like, at a surface, if you're kind of mainstream, if you're sort of a normie, you already don't like crypto because you don't own any. You've heard some bad things and you read this, you're like, this is terrible, right? I hate bitcoin. This is the campaign that is being pushed out. And guess who's funding it in part? Greenpeace, of course, EWG, but also ripple, the ripple foundation.
01:22:26.006 - 01:22:27.850, Speaker B: Oh, those bastards.
01:22:29.870 - 01:22:31.660, Speaker A: Ripple is in on it.
01:22:33.710 - 01:22:36.560, Speaker B: Has been a friend to the industry. Like, think again.
01:22:37.010 - 01:22:40.640, Speaker A: Okay, well, give me your take on all of this. What do you think about this?
01:22:41.330 - 01:23:19.274, Speaker B: Okay, so when I was reading that, I was like, wow, this feels like it's coming from somebody who knows something about the industry, right? Bitcoin. Maxis would point to this and be like, because it labels Ethereum, why isn't bitcoin doing proof of stake like Ethereum is? And it's like, this is probably interpreted as like a narrative attack against bitcoin by ethereums. It turns out it's ripple. Wow, I didn't know that. Yeah, it's ripple. My take on this is that it is really probably spinning a lot of narrative, and it's probably way more not true than it is true for sure. At the same time, the rest of the world is totally ready to hear this.
01:23:19.472 - 01:23:21.218, Speaker A: This narrative just resonates.
01:23:21.334 - 01:23:51.400, Speaker B: Land so hard. Even if it's wrong, I'm conflicted on this, because if bitcoin was what bitcoiners would believe it to be, a lot of this stuff could actually become true. Imagine if bitcoin was a 100 trillion dollar network and it's still proof of work. It would be consuming an absolutely insane amount of energy. And so that is true. What is not true is that there's any amount of evidence that bitcoin, the network, is increasing the average global temperature. There's no evidence to that.
01:23:51.400 - 01:23:58.070, Speaker B: And so this is really just a narrative campaign. Oh God, ripple. Goddamn bastards.
01:23:59.790 - 01:24:23.578, Speaker A: Look, it doesn't show the totality of the picture. The drying industry, just like drying your clothes consumes more electricity output, the entire industry, than bitcoin has in its existence. Right? It's just stuff like this benchmarks you don't really see. It's not telling the full story. Can you just click a button and upgrade a software code to reduce bitcoin's energy use by net? No, you can.
01:24:23.684 - 01:24:25.954, Speaker B: It's not how this simple, right?
01:24:26.072 - 01:24:35.710, Speaker A: Bitcoin is resurrecting fossil fuels. Maybe in some places, but in others it's incentivizing actual green usage, total usage.
01:24:35.790 - 01:24:37.582, Speaker B: Yeah. This is ridiculous.
01:24:37.726 - 01:24:50.322, Speaker A: But here's the thing, I guess when you're thinking about the narrative battle that we're all fighting, we just talked about proof of stake. I'm very glad that crypto proof of stake does not have to fight these types of battles.
01:24:50.386 - 01:25:00.170, Speaker B: Yeah, it's one of those things where I'm very frustrated with ripple for doing this, but at the same time, like, yo, bitcoiners, this is your fight to fight. Good luck.
01:25:01.230 - 01:25:05.050, Speaker A: Ethereum has six more months. I don't know. Three more months. I don't know. We'll see.
01:25:05.200 - 01:25:06.334, Speaker B: Three to six more months. Yeah.
01:25:06.372 - 01:25:09.114, Speaker A: It's not even fighting it though. It's just like we're going to switch.
01:25:09.162 - 01:25:11.754, Speaker B: Okay, so here's a great tweet out of Missouri.
01:25:11.882 - 01:25:14.554, Speaker A: This is what I was saying with tumble dryers. Look at this. Less than bitcoin.
01:25:14.602 - 01:25:50.202, Speaker B: Yeah, this more than image is a little fuzzy, so I'll read it out. Carbon emissions of bitcoin compared to other industries. Bitcoin, 41 million tons of co2 per year or something. Gold industry, 122 to bitcoin's 41. Global banking, 130 to bitcoin's 41. Tumble dryers, 53 to bitcoin's 41. So do you wash your clothes or do you dry your clothes in a dryer because you are producing more or consuming more energy than you don't have to? Aviation industry 1982 to bitcoin's 41.
01:25:50.202 - 01:25:53.020, Speaker B: So what are we really being concerned about here?
01:25:53.470 - 01:25:57.630, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's some takes here, of course.
01:25:57.700 - 01:26:01.710, Speaker B: But again, you remember the leave Britney alone memes. Like leave bitcoin alone.
01:26:02.930 - 01:26:04.574, Speaker A: Yeah, there's an element of that for sure.
01:26:04.612 - 01:26:09.266, Speaker B: But also bitcoiners. Good luck. Nick Carter. Wish the best for you. Wouldn't want that.
01:26:09.448 - 01:26:27.810, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's a hard thing to defend. Proof of work, I think, over the next decade for sure. But we have other battles to fight in the regulatory front. And I think one of the main battles that everyone in crypto should be concerned with is this attack on our bankless wallets, on noncustodial wallets.
01:26:27.890 - 01:26:29.446, Speaker B: Here's the fight that bitcoiners don't have.
01:26:29.468 - 01:26:36.698, Speaker A: To fight, but they should also. They don't, I guess. Well, they do. Bitcoiners want their private key access, of course.
01:26:36.784 - 01:26:38.906, Speaker B: I guess so. I was mainly referring to DFI, but.
01:26:38.928 - 01:27:16.678, Speaker A: Yeah, this is super important. Okay, so last week a Coinbase user in Canada sent me this letter. And this is an email rather, from Coinbase. Starting on April 4, Coinbase will introduce some changes required by canadian regulators. Specifically, when you send crypto to another financial entity or money services business, then transaction is over cad1000. We legally require you to ask for the information about the recipient of that transactions, their name and address. This is like the question I have.
01:27:16.678 - 01:27:27.430, Speaker A: So this is first on the menu. Aml KYC they want to know who you're sending funds to if it's over a $1,000. But what's next on the menu? Just disable withdrawals to crypto wallets altogether.
01:27:27.510 - 01:27:27.850, Speaker B: Right.
01:27:27.920 - 01:28:02.006, Speaker A: Like they could very easily do this. This is a nexus to do this with crypto banks, essentially. And my concern is that governments like the canadian government want to trap crypto into the existing financial prison system that we have. Digital financial prison system, this panopticon where they get to monitor all of the transactions and with a click of a button they can shut them down. That is not a good system. There's not the bankless, decentralized finance money for the system that we are fighting for. I think some canadian politicians, to be fair, are pushing back on this.
01:28:02.006 - 01:28:26.480, Speaker A: So this is one. His name is Pierre Puliev, I think. Come on, Poliev. I think this guy has a good shot, from what I've been told, at becoming Canada's next leader in Canada's conservative party. I'm not sure to what extent that's true. But look at this campaign. Let's make Canada the blockchain capital of the world.
01:28:26.850 - 01:28:38.590, Speaker B: This is going to be the new division in politics. Are you pro or anti crypto? And it's going to be the incumbents who are already politicians. That's going to be anti crypto and it's going to be the newer politicians. They're going to be pro crypto.
01:28:38.670 - 01:29:02.058, Speaker A: And this doesn't break down in left and right. To me. A progressive candidate in the US wrote a fantastic editorial piece on why the left should embrace web3 and embrace crypto this week that I read too. So that's a counter force. But the EU as well, they're coming down against unhosted wallets. This is just breaking today, I believe what's happening here.
01:29:02.144 - 01:29:31.810, Speaker B: Yeah, the tweet says that's from Patrick Hansen. The econ and libe committees. I don't know what that is. Of the EU parliament voted in favor of the FTR compromises d e that cracked down on unhosted wallets. Entire regulation drafted to be voted on later today, but we'll certainly go through breakdown of the vote and more updates in this thread. Basically, the EU voting to basically control unhosted wallets, restrict withdrawals to unhosted wallets. The unhosted wallet thing, that's basically like.
01:29:31.810 - 01:29:35.490, Speaker B: Is your wallet custody by an institution that has an address.
01:29:35.560 - 01:29:36.530, Speaker A: They don't like that.
01:29:36.680 - 01:29:47.000, Speaker B: They don't like unhosted wallets. It's such like a nanny state thing. Like, oh, you need to have a wallet that is taken care of by somebody else. No, I don't. I can host my own wallet. That's kind of the point of.
01:29:49.850 - 01:30:17.146, Speaker A: Terrible. So this hasn't gone through yet, but I'm not sure the process for which this sort of thing becomes a law in the EU, but it's on its way. And another example of kind of regulators and government officials not liking unhosted wallets and the battle that's ahead. Patrick Hansen ends it like this. This information comes straight out of the EP. I will share an official link overview of the vote here ASAP. We have lost the battle.
01:30:17.146 - 01:30:50.326, Speaker A: That's this. But this is far from over. So there's still some steps in the process through which we could get something like this shut down. But you could see it, right? Last week we were talking about some of this talk in the US from Elizabeth Warren wanting to do similar types of actions. Now we're seeing it in Canada, we're seeing it in the EU as well. This is the SEC who has come up with this very expansive definition of the term exchange. And it's very unclear what an exchange actually includes.
01:30:50.326 - 01:31:33.914, Speaker A: Is it code? Is it a non custodial wallet? Is it something like uniswap, something in DFI? The language that they are trying to put in place in the proposed rule in the US is very unclear. And so they've asked for comments. I think there's like maybe 20 days remaining, 30 days of comments. This is some action we can take, is actually to comment against this. We'll include a link in the show notes where you could tell the SEC, don't create more uncertainty for DFI, but the language around what's an exchange and what's not is incredibly unclear. And I think it's also unclear by design. So we don't know if this is more of the same kind of energy of a rejection non custodial wallet, but it sort of feels like it.
01:31:33.914 - 01:31:54.062, Speaker A: And in all of these places, I almost feel like the boat's kind of leaking. And the people in the crypto industry are like, where's the leak? We're just trying to bail it out. We're just trying to get the water out of the boat and we have to do this on a weekly basis. They're just kind of wearing us down. There's always something that's trying to slip by and get past.
01:31:54.196 - 01:32:06.434, Speaker B: Yeah. The number of things that they can do is probably more than we can probably patch the holes for. So the solution for this has always been to build our way out of it, which is what we are doing.
01:32:06.632 - 01:32:16.822, Speaker A: Germany 50% with crypto. That's how we do this. That's how we do this. What's this story, David? In good news, Maker Dow is hooking up with traditional bank. What's that mean?
01:32:16.876 - 01:33:14.918, Speaker B: Yeah, so Maker Dow is really innovating in ways that other organizations are not. They're taking this very real world approach of getting real world assets into Makerdao through a combination of just like llcs and trusts to custody real world property and then have these loans be using the makerdao system, loans generated against these real world assets. No one else is doing this. And it's one of the most bullish things about Makerdao that no one really understands. There is controversy about Makerdao, as in it's kind of like the banked version of DeFi, but I would contend that it's actually quite decentralized in the model that they are doing this. But there is so much value out in the real world, and the only organization that is going after that to put that into Tvl inside of contracts is maker. So you go to something like DeFi llama, and you look at Aave, it's got ether and uni tokens and link tokens inside of its balance sheets.
01:33:14.918 - 01:33:31.786, Speaker B: Only Maker has real world property, real world real estate inside of its vaults with Dai backing it or no backing is it's in a league of its own. And maker is, in my mind, one of the most underappreciated things in DFI.
01:33:31.898 - 01:33:35.482, Speaker A: This is kind of, I think your words are like, it's a back end for banks.
01:33:35.546 - 01:33:35.726, Speaker B: Right?
01:33:35.748 - 01:34:09.238, Speaker A: And what's cool about this is this small bank based in the suburbs of Philadelphia. It's a 151 year old community bank. Not one of the big ones, not like a Wells Fargo or an HSBC. It's just kind of a community bank, local community bank. They are trying to put $500 million in assets inside of makers so you could lend and borrow against that. And that would be collateral forms of basis for DAi. So it's creating some innovation for some of these credit unions and banks that are much smaller.
01:34:09.238 - 01:34:32.098, Speaker A: And it's sort of a bridge for these banks to DeFi, which is really cool. I think this is a counterforce against all of the regulatory scrutiny and pressure is just like, hey, look at the value that we can drive, the efficiency we can bring to our financial markets. These small banks are able to use these deep fry protocols and provide benefits to the world.
01:34:32.264 - 01:35:14.270, Speaker B: And this is in stark contrast to the algorithmic stablecoins of the world, which are kind of backed by a fractional reserve backed by nothing to some portion of them or aren't fully backed. This is a direct, in my mind, the equal and opposite force for that where it's backed by extremely real things. And that $50 million loan that this HBV bank is asking for, there's going to be a steep fee with that. The risk of the real world assets is going to come with a maker Dow stability fee and TBD on what that number is. But that's $50 million, which the MKR token is going to get burned as a function of that stability fee. There's going to be some sort of interest rate on $500 million and it's going to go to burning MKR.
01:35:15.410 - 01:35:21.022, Speaker A: That's kind of cool. I'm just excited that we get to see all these experiments play out right, as I've long said with Maker.
01:35:21.086 - 01:35:50.394, Speaker B: And so we will be covering all of this and more in a live stream happening today, Friday for the listener. Makerdao, like I've said, I think is one of the most underappreciated things because of the existence of the centralized foundation of Maker Dow. They haven't been able to market themselves in the way that other organizations have. So we're giving three Dow members a chance to give the most bullish case for maker Dow and MKR. That is happening as a live stream, 09:00 a.m. Pacific 12:00 p.m. Eastern time today Friday as you are listening to this.
01:35:50.394 - 01:35:57.946, Speaker B: So if you want to hear the case as to why maker Dow is so fundamentally bullish, we're going to hear it from three DAO community members who are bullish.
01:35:57.978 - 01:36:01.482, Speaker A: MKR, I think you should ask him if Doequan is going to kill Dai.
01:36:01.546 - 01:36:02.640, Speaker B: I think I will.
01:36:03.650 - 01:36:09.026, Speaker A: Guys. We will be back with the raises of the week. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:36:09.128 - 01:36:43.438, Speaker B: If you're trying to grow and preserve your crypto wealth, optimizing your taxes is just as lucrative as trying to find the next hidden gem. Also, IRA can help you invest in crypto in tax advantage ways to help you preserve your hard earned money. Also, crypto IRA lets you invest in more than 150 coins and tokens with all the same tax advantages of an IRA. They make it easy to fund your alternative IRA or crypto IRA via your by contributing directly from your bank account. There is no setup or account fees and is all you need to do to invest in crypto tax free. Let me repeat that again. You can invest in crypto tax free.

To invest in crypto tax free, just go to altoira.com bankless, that's altoira.com bankless and start investing in crypto today. The L2 era is upon us. Ethereum's L2 ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a L2 life.
01:37:08.210 - 01:38:00.242, Speaker B: Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge. With across. You don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from L2 back to Ethereum, a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum, where community members will decide on the token distribution. You can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a co founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of a crops if you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely, go to across to bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, arbitram or Boba networks Makerdao is the OG Defi protocol. The Makerdao produces Dai, the industry's most battle tested and resilient stablecoin using maker you don't need to sell your collateral if you need liquidity.
01:38:00.242 - 01:38:27.390, Speaker B: Instead, you can spin up a maker vault and use your collateral to mint Dai directly. With Maker, the power to mint new money is in your hands. The maker protocol is extremely hardened and operated by one of the most experienced daos in existence. They've been here since the beginning. They've seen it all. And so you can mint Dai with the assurance that your collateral is safe. Soon, Maker will be present on all chains and l two s so minting Dai can take place on Oasis app, Xerion, Zapper or any other d five protocol that you use.
01:38:27.390 - 01:38:32.750, Speaker B: Follow Maker on Twitter at makerdao and learn from the oldest and most resilient dow in existence.
01:38:33.730 - 01:38:43.582, Speaker A: All right guys, we are back with the takes of the week. This is from someone on the institutional side, Mike McGlan. He says what? Why don't you read this out, David?
01:38:43.646 - 01:39:06.666, Speaker B: Yeah. Demand is increasing, supply is declining, and Ethereum's position at the epicenter of the digitization of finance and money suggests further price appreciation. Ethereum, the denominator for nfts and the top platform for tokenization is becoming the collateral of the Internet. This is a good take. This is nothing new to bankless listeners. But the cool thing about this is this is coming from Tradfi. That's why we're talking about this.
01:39:06.666 - 01:39:23.262, Speaker B: This is a tradfi guy, Mike McGlone, who's at Bloomberg, 46,000 followers on Twitter. Probably none of those followers are the same followers that we have on crypto Twitter. Those are brand new followers. And we got trad five people speaking bankless language about ether. People are waking up. Tradfi is waking up.
01:39:23.396 - 01:39:40.294, Speaker A: Bankless. Quoting Bloomberg, quoting bankless. Exactly. Let's talk about this. This is a Reddit thread that I ran into this week and something about it resonated for me. So it was this, or at least caught my attention. Yes, I am in it for the money.
01:39:40.294 - 01:39:59.206, Speaker A: I don't care what people think. Cryptocurrency from the perspective of a male in his thirty s. That is the title of the post. The poster goes on to describe the conditions today. There's no wage growth, no prospects in many countries. Constant financial crisis that keep hitting and hitting us from all sides. Now inflation is going to melt our savings.
01:39:59.206 - 01:40:24.834, Speaker A: That's if we're lucky enough to have savings in the first place. Education system, that's a joke in most countries. Crippling deaths, high cost of living, rents going up and up and up and so on. Crypto for a lot of us is the only way out, the only way to be able to afford a house or a flat in the future. So yeah, you bet I'm in it for the money. And I don't give a damn what people think. Priority number one for me is to provide for my family.
01:40:24.834 - 01:40:41.322, Speaker A: What do you think about this? I'm in it for the money 100%. That's why I'm in crypto. It's because there's no better way to get money for someone who's early in their life, like all of the other opportunities have been already extracted. What do you think about this take?
01:40:41.376 - 01:41:15.570, Speaker B: Oh God, I could talk about this for hours. He talks about so many things and I'll just reiterate them. No job prospects, constant financial crises, new inflation, melting savings, crippling debts, high cost of livings, rents going up. So yeah, he needs to be about the money. But the system that is creating all of these things is a result of the centralized, captured financial system that we are leaving. And the reason why crypto works, because why crypto number is going to go up and why this guy is going to make money is because Crypto is fixing all of those problems. One of those problems is not having any money.
01:41:15.570 - 01:41:41.174, Speaker B: One of the best use Cases of Crypto, Ryan, is number go up. And so that is the first thing that solves so many people's lives with crypto. Number go up is the most freeing thing possible. And so being in it for the money is the bootloader to talk about everything else about crypto. Crypto is not here to make you rich. It's here to set you free. But in order to be free, it really, really helps to be rich.
01:41:41.174 - 01:42:16.840, Speaker B: And so that is like, the first step. And so once this guy finally gets rich off of crypto, he's going to start to realize that. And this is what Kevin awakee talks about with regenerative crypto economics. The reason why crypto works is because we're all in it for the money. And instead of the old banking system, the old government system, the old institutions capturing us, everyone being here in it for the money is actually enabling for these systems to work. Bitcoin is secured because people are greedy, and they need to mine bitcoin. Ethereum works because people are greedy, and they want to stake as much ether as possible.
01:42:16.840 - 01:42:43.930, Speaker B: These systems, these democratized systems where everyone wants to be greedy and for number to go up is how this industry is powered. There's why there's energy in Daos. There's why there's energy in ethereum. There's why there's energy behind the uniswap dao. This is why crypto works. And so this is always the first step in people's journey into getting into crypto. First you're here for the money, then you get the money, and then you understand the values behind how this industry is powered.
01:42:44.090 - 01:42:46.610, Speaker A: We got to get you wealthy before we get you healthy.
01:42:47.990 - 01:42:49.780, Speaker B: Why did I say all of that?
01:42:50.710 - 01:43:37.614, Speaker A: Look, man, it's like this is the first step to freedom, right? We've said it before that crypto is a journey towards freedom, and you can't have financial freedom unless you have some level of financial independence. But the thing is, I think the important thing to remember is sometimes we've said it before, decentralization is kind of a luxury for the wealthy, right? I think decentralization hopefully becomes more important to people over time. But at first, the way you got into crypto, the way I got into crypto, it was very much about, how is this an opportunity to achieve some level of financial freedom? And it's totally fine if you're in it for the money, at least at first. Just don't stop. When you have the money right, then be in it for everyone else. Lend a hand downward. Don't pull up the ladder.
01:43:37.614 - 01:44:15.934, Speaker A: Help other people. Decentralization is a public good for everyone that keeps this system free of corruption and cancer and corrosion. And that's definitely what we need. So it's almost like, David, my expectations are higher for people who know better and have been in this industry for a long time. And a lot of when we get a little bit, maybe preachy on decentralization, it's not talking to people who haven't made it in crypto yet and are just trying to get wealthy. It's talking to people who are here already wealthy and know better. Know that if we don't create systems that are sustainable in the future, there is no future for this industry, and it won't do the good capital g that we think it can.
01:44:16.052 - 01:45:03.418, Speaker B: The way that you said that, where you're kicking the ladder out as you go, that's a really important point. And that's why after you get yours, it's important to reach your hand down and pull someone else up with you. And a way to do that is to promote decentralization because that is how these systems are going to generate wealth for our kids and our kids kids. So this guy needs to focus on getting as much money as possible, because like he said, his number one concern is providing for his family. Once he has done that, he has the luxury to consider more things. And going from number, going up on bitcoin and ether, because these assets are decentralized to turning into promoting centralized systems is akin to getting yours and then shutting the door behind you. So that's why once you get yours, you got to promote values.
01:45:03.594 - 01:45:16.330, Speaker A: There you go. How many jobs you have in crypto? This is a great tweet, actually. I love this tweet. The three in web, three stands for three full time jobs. That's the tweet.
01:45:16.490 - 01:45:31.926, Speaker B: Hey, when you think about that, how many jobs do you have when you can work for 50 dows? There is no limit as to what you can do. And sometimes when you work for multiple dows, you can do work that is doing work for multiple dows at once, really blurring the lines between what's a job and what's not a job.
01:45:32.028 - 01:45:38.514, Speaker A: Yeah, we tell you to get a job in crypto. We're not telling you to be less busy. I mean, you will be more busy when you get a job in crypto.
01:45:38.562 - 01:45:40.390, Speaker B: That's a good point. That's a good point.
01:45:40.540 - 01:45:50.726, Speaker A: All right. Proof of stake will go down in history. It's one of the most democratizing forces of power that has ever been invented. I feel like I read that from someone this week. Great quote, David.
01:45:50.918 - 01:45:52.326, Speaker B: Whoever said that is a genius.
01:45:52.438 - 01:45:56.954, Speaker A: Just complete genius. What did that genius mean by this quote?
01:45:57.002 - 01:46:28.150, Speaker B: Yeah, Ryan, earlier you tweeted out this week and you flashed on the screen, what is the entire point of crypto? What is the point of crypto? And I said, pushing power to the margins. So what we were just talking about with decentralization, the way that crypto works is over the long term, the structural balance of crypto is stable so that future generations do not feel disenfranchised. And the way that we do that is we push power into the individual who are always at the margins. You've got the institutions at the center, you got the individuals at the margins. Crypto is here to put power at the margins.
01:46:28.730 - 01:46:35.594, Speaker A: David, I think we're going to skip what we're excited about this week because I know we're both excited about the same thing. Super obvious.
01:46:35.712 - 01:46:36.380, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:46:36.990 - 01:46:37.814, Speaker A: Bankless arena.
01:46:37.862 - 01:46:42.822, Speaker B: I've always wanted my name on an arena, but I think I'll settle for bankless's name on an arena.
01:46:42.886 - 01:47:04.020, Speaker A: It's way better. Way better. So let's just jump to the meme of the week. And there was a lot of meme fodder this week that we could get into, but this is the one we chose because this is the iconic Will Smith slap Chris Rock week that kind of shook the world. I woke up to this on Monday and I was like, wait, what happened?
01:47:05.190 - 01:47:05.970, Speaker B: It was crazy.
01:47:06.040 - 01:47:07.910, Speaker A: Can you believe that happened? First of all?
01:47:08.060 - 01:47:29.050, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that was a surprise. That was a surprise. It was a little bit refreshing. Here's some. Just like good old classic Hollywood drama, slapstick don't promote violence. But if I have to choose between the drama of the week being Will Smith slapping Kevin Rose and Russia invading Ukraine, I'll go, wait, will smith slapping Kevin Rose? Oh, excuse me, sorry. Kevin Rose.
01:47:29.050 - 01:47:43.550, Speaker B: Who's the guy. Who's the guy that got slapped? Chris Rock. Chris Rock. I don't know why I said Kevin Rose. That's funny. Has nothing to do with Kevin Rose. Yeah, like a little bit more light hearted of drama in the news.
01:47:43.620 - 01:47:44.202, Speaker A: Not heavy.
01:47:44.266 - 01:47:59.430, Speaker B: Anyway, this meme is of bitcoin slapping the shit out of the bear. Bear market's over. So that's why this meme of the week. And Ryan, you have a fantastic caption. I'm going to swear here. So cover your kids'ears, keep my coin out of your fucking mouth.
01:48:01.050 - 01:48:15.462, Speaker A: I can't believe he said that at the oscars, man. That's hilarious. Guys. That's it for the weekly roll up I hope you enjoyed. We're going to get to the moment of Zen stumping. You got to stick around for. But of course, got to end with our disclaimers.
01:48:15.462 - 01:48:27.882, Speaker A: As usual, none of this has been financial advice. Bitcoin, ETH and Defi, they're all risky. You could lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.
01:48:27.882 - 01:48:28.766, Speaker A: Thanks a lot.
01:48:28.868 - 01:48:29.146, Speaker B: Yo.
