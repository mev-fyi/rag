00:00:05.450 - 00:00:57.930, Speaker A: What up, coordination? How you doing on the pod? Today we got Jed, who is going to be joining me to talk about how we can make refi real. So, really interesting conversation. Jed is co founder and general partner at Cerulean Ventures. So he's an investor, also is a product guy in the space stewards of Prime, Dow and Gnosis Guild. And basically we are talking a lot in this episode about how can we regen the world with Web Three. What are the opportunities in the bear market? What kind of stuff does Jahad like to see in the space? And specifically this question of how do we make regen web Three investable? Because if there's money there and it's investable, then you're going to see more talent and capital and attention flow into the space. We talk about his experience at the Cop 27 climate change summit.
00:00:57.930 - 00:01:17.346, Speaker A: We talk about post capitalist network societies. Towards the end, what needs to happen in the next one to five years for Web Three to become more regenerative for the world? So just making refi, making regen real is the theme of this episode and I think that you're going to enjoy it. So without further ado, I give you making refi real. Enjoy.

00:03:10.410 - 00:03:12.166, Speaker C: Hey, man, good to see you again.
00:03:12.348 - 00:03:28.478, Speaker A: Yeah, great to have you. So I remember just viscerally going on for a hike with you when I was writing the Green Pill Book and we were talking about our various regen theses. So maybe I'll just tee it off with an extremely broad question. How can we web three regenerate the world?
00:03:28.644 - 00:04:06.300, Speaker C: Oh, man, that's a big one, too. It's a good thing I gave this talk many times this year. So this reminds me of probably the one I did at ETH Barcelona, where it was like I think it was legit. That title was like, how can Web Three regenerate the world? Or something really think boy like that. But basically, how can it? I think it's a number of things, man. But one, when I'm explaining this to other investors or to people like, what the hell is refi? I'm like, well, basically you have this economy that exists that doesn't really give a shit about do you cuss on this podcast, by the way? I should have asked that first.
00:04:06.990 - 00:04:10.090, Speaker A: Not gratuitously, but sometimes cool.
00:04:10.160 - 00:04:24.218, Speaker C: So I think this is apt. This economy really doesn't give a shit about it's hard to make that care about people, about carbon dioxide, about environmental degradation and stuff like that what we.
00:04:24.244 - 00:04:26.862, Speaker A: Call the externalities in our spreadsheets.
00:04:27.006 - 00:05:14.500, Speaker C: Exactly. And wouldn't it be great if we could design a system that could internalize some of those externalities, price them and make it such that we could decide, make decisions about how much of them we want or don't want? Right. So I think that when you really dig into that sentence and you're like, well, what does that actually have to do with web three? There's some things that stand out, right? You need accounting, you need the ability to make some things legible that aren't. You need to have one of the proven web three cases, which is just being able to trade or have markets and stuff. That's actually one of our really well proven out use cases. Basically, you put all those things together. And I just like to say that we need more people in the space, we need more money in the space, and we need to turn those things to positive ends, positive sum ends, right?
00:05:15.830 - 00:05:53.670, Speaker A: So it seems like kind of price the externalities, put them into a market, and then try to internalize some of those externalities into the economy. And then once it's proven that that can be working in one place, then channeling more talent and capital and resources into market pricing lots of different externalities. And then once the market is pricing them and then there's money flowing into correcting whatever asymmetry was wrong with the externalities, then you're starting to have web three, regenerate the world and bring in the things that it was not otherwise. Is that a valid summary?
00:05:53.750 - 00:06:59.234, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so. And then the big part that I left out, which I'm always actually embarrassed that I did, one of the things that I think you and I vibed on early too, is just ownership too. Like making sure that all of the people who are involved in these systems, one, have governance systems that kind of reflect their participation in it, polycentric governance of some kind, and then ownership that reflects their contribution in it. Right. So the thing I'm thinking about in particular is I just came out of the UN's Cop 27, the Climate Conference. And one of the things that stuck with me is we were at this little side event called the World Climate Summit, the world's biggest capital, allocators in public and private partnerships. And one of the things that they said during that was, hey, did you know that roughly 80% of the world's biodiversity is stewarded by a small amount of indigenous people spread across the world? And did you also know that they get paid next to nothing for this? And all of that stewardship is basically an input to the economy, right? It's this ecosystem services that people talk about.
00:06:59.234 - 00:07:12.280, Speaker C: So going back to you kind of you're like when you kind of remixed and presented to me what I had said. I think the big missing piece too is also making sure that people have ownership and upside in all of these systems, right?
00:07:13.930 - 00:07:37.774, Speaker A: What would you say? I think that there's a certain bad taste in people's mouth, particularly people who are traditionally on the left when it comes to taking markets and applying them in these new vectors. And I'm wondering if we could talk about that a little bit because I think there are some valid criticisms there and we should unpack them. Anything to say about that?
00:07:37.892 - 00:08:36.290, Speaker C: Oh, for sure. I think you and I did a panel on this too, I think at East Denver, right, in February. And one of the things I said there, well, it's like the first thing actually is two things that stick out to me. I think that one, you are going to I would say in some ways we already have markets and we have really bad markets and things, right? Like, you mean think about let's take even the sort of indigenous people right there's across let's take South America in places like Paraguay and Brazil, you have various indigenous people like the Cayapo and other folks who are stewarding basically forest in those regions. And you today can only value those forests by what they are worth when you cut them down and sell them for timber on a market. Right. So I'd say the market art in that in their instance for what those folks depend on already exists and is existentially threatening them right.
00:08:36.290 - 00:09:15.920, Speaker C: It would be great to have another market or another market force that says actually the things that these folks are doing, living their lives normally as they would anyway, Matt has another contribution that's much bigger than letting illegal loggers, and in some cases paramilitary, go out and steal their land and kill them. Right. So that's just one sort of toy example, right? I'd say in some ways the market forces have already happened to them, so it'd be great if we could find a way to include them and create either opposing or orthogonal market forces that can offset some of that stuff.
00:09:16.450 - 00:09:56.234, Speaker A: So I guess the argument here is that in the case of the loggers, the market forces have only made the forest legible to the market, wherein if they cut it down and they sell it, then that's how it's legible to the market. And what if there was sort of a stewardship stipend that was given to people who were maintaining the trees and maybe that was offset by some sort of carbon credit system because the trees weren't being chopped down. That's where it gets funded. So basically making it legible to the market in an opposing way to the traditional extractive capitalist way is what you're talking about here.
00:09:56.352 - 00:10:47.162, Speaker C: Totally. And I think carbon is just the tipping point or just the very tip of it, right. Because you could zoom out and say this is a thing people have been talking about for a couple of decades, if not more. What is the value of ecosystem services? Right, so what is the value of carbon captured, oxygen produced, biodiversity supported, watershed quality, all that kind of stuff, right. So I think when you take that today, some of the numbers that are thrown around by economists are anywhere from $16 to $54 trillion is the worth of the input of nature into the economy. And so when someone says like, well, markets have been really, traditionally, really terrible, I'm like, yeah, a lot of the problem with them is that they're dominated by the interests of a few. They become distorted by price making, by price making versus price taking.
00:10:47.162 - 00:11:24.870, Speaker C: Literally, they just become dysfunctional markets. And then lastly, a bunch of people are just shut out from you and participating in them. Right. If I came today, actually, thankfully, there are a couple of refi projects who are kind of working on this. But if you wanted to do that exact thing that I said where someone said, hey, actually, I would like to not cut down this forest, and I would like to actually make its value legible to you in other ways and have that market value be available such that someone can say, oh, I would like to purchase the ecosystem services of this region and not cut down the trees. That would actually be, I think, game changing, right? At least from my perspective.
00:11:25.370 - 00:12:11.942, Speaker A: Yeah. One of the things I run into sometimes when I'm talking about this, which I'm doing a lot, is where's the money going to come from that sort of creates that opposing market force to the loggers. And I didn't know the answer for a little while, but then Griff Green started talking about how there's tens of trillions of dollars of money going into public goods if you count all of the existing charities and local government and state and national government in the United States. And sort of like one of his ideas. Is that the money that would have gone into some hierarchical, high administrative overhead program to regenerate the world coming from the state? Or I guess, regenerate your local economy? Since states.
00:12:11.996 - 00:12:12.454, Speaker C: Have.
00:12:12.572 - 00:12:42.110, Speaker A: Local jurisdictions could then be channeled into these kinds of stipends and they can just be more efficient because they're being deployed through a network based system and smart contracts and stuff like that. So I guess like two part question. What do you think of the question of how do we fund this world regeneration? What do you think of that? And also what do you think of Griffith's thesis about that trillions of dollars that was going to the state now being channeled through smart contracts?
00:12:42.690 - 00:13:41.698, Speaker C: Well, I have talked to Griff about this quite a lot, actually and I'll take that part of it first. I think know, when you think about all the folks involved in this, it is and truly is like it's just a mess, right? Like when you think you have to zoom into what level of the ontology are you talking about with respect to jurisdictions and states, right? And at every level it gets more convoluted. But in theory I actually do agree with that. That is public good spending. Right. The problem much like you've probably done a couple of episodes on decentralized science, right? I see the problem as similar to science in that you have the production of an epistemology facts, a bunch of things, scientific facts being put out there that is also entangled with reputation, prestige, career advancement, all these other things, right, because of the bureaucratization of science. And that's not to say it's good or bad, it's just a fact.
00:13:41.698 - 00:14:32.530, Speaker C: Right. So then take that and say maybe look at your local jurisdiction. The thesis for Griff here is that a lot of the funding and a lot of the projects are actually tied in these hierarchical structures to things other than their outcomes, right? They're tied to things like this person gets a promotion for getting it through. The other person on the other side might back scratch the private sector employee to come in and run the thing on the public side in the next go round and all this, right? I think that's the real promise of if Griff's thing leads anywhere, that's the real promise of it, right, is that it disentangles these status hierarchies that actually prevent us from making what people would ostensibly say are objectively better impact based outcomes. Right. So I'd say I mostly agree. And if I'm curious, I'm really curious to see if that plays out right.
00:14:32.530 - 00:15:06.160, Speaker C: If you can actually say, let's make a local city dow or a neighborhood dow, even that says, hey, we're actually going to take the local actors as being the experts on what needs to happen here and we're going to let them maybe use something like Gitcoin's Quadratic funding primitives to decide what needs to get out there for them. Right. And now that is a super cool experiment. Now the only thing, only problem it runs into is how do you bootstrap that system and how do you make it like either city, state, global? That's the hard part.
00:15:07.010 - 00:16:15.454, Speaker A: Yeah, for me, each of these mechanisms, you need a mechanism to distribute capital and then according to who's doing the most public good or regenerative work? I think public goods are a horizon. They're a little bit technocratic because as soon as you start giving out something that's excludable or rivalrous in some dimension, then but anyway, you need a mechanism that gives out the money to people who are doing good, and then you need a mechanism for raising the money. And I think it's easier for people to grok that, oh, some of this money that was coming in through taxes, which was designated for the public good, could be used to fund these dows. But there are more advanced mechanisms of raising that money. Like you could create a dow for that local neighborhood and create a local currency for that of which most of the treasury goes to. But then you get into all these problems of bootstrapping a new local currency and why is that worth anything? And it's just simpler to say, oh, we're going to take some of the taxpayer money to bootstrap it. But I actually think it's really interesting to think about the mechanism Legos on the distribution side and then the plurality of ways that you could raise money to go into the Legos.
00:16:15.454 - 00:16:22.470, Speaker A: And then eventually, through all the permutations, we'll eventually find something that works and then starts to work at scale with these things.
00:16:22.620 - 00:17:06.930, Speaker C: Absolutely. And I think for me, the real interesting question is can an investor of any kind, whether it be a venture, a debt, or even just patient capital, which is kind of becoming a popular term these days, can a person like that come in and bootstrap these systems? Can a group like that come in and say, hey, this is a super interesting outcome. The potential market is in the trillions and we actually care less about having like 12% of it at IPO. The notion of IPO doesn't exist here. It's actually just more of a network play and we could take 1% of it and create massive economic benefits for everyone. Right. That's really a big part of my experiment in this whole regenerative economy thing.
00:17:06.930 - 00:17:09.880, Speaker C: Is that possible? I don't know yet.
00:17:10.410 - 00:17:14.950, Speaker A: Well, do you know, any investors we could ask, how do we make regen stuff investable?
00:17:15.370 - 00:18:09.606, Speaker C: Oh, well, actually, it's funny you say that. That's literally what I think about. And all in my free time, I'd say maybe. It's got to be maybe at least 50% of my deal calls are just trying to figure out with the entrepreneur or the founder, like, hey, how can we shape this into a thing that offers some clear value to investors, but also isn't so hideous that it just takes over your whole network and makes it the VC chain? Right? Because nobody wants that. I don't want that. But how do you make things? I mean, really, it's a great question because I think this is fresh on my mind, too, coming out of Cop, because like I said, you have all these huge capital, allocators who are sitting here going like I'm talking just to be clear, right? Like Schroeders, which is one of the UK's biggest asset managers, 700 billion under management. You have like, Cafe Holdings, which is near a trillion in management.
00:18:09.606 - 00:19:51.594, Speaker C: You have LGT, who is the world's biggest family office, sitting on like 5 billion. And these people are coming together and saying, hey, we've realized that we've learned some interesting things about impact, specifically about climate in the last 20 years, but all of the things we've kind of done are just little Dinkin and Duncan here and there. They're not tied together like in a cohesive vision. There's no technology behind it that can really help scale it up, right? And so I think making region stuff investable, some of it has to do with kevin, you're a multi time founder, right? They have all these things in Silicon Valley and such around customer development, understanding the various folks in your customer segmentation, understanding the various parties involved in your network. I think some of that stuff applies almost one to one to what we're building here, but some of it doesn't, right? And so making region stuff investable, the first thing I always ask is, like, one, why does this have to be a blockchain? Right? Because a lot of the stuff we talk about, even I think you did an episode on carbon Credits, right? A lot of the stuff around Carbon Credits, even, it's unclear to the market players why it has to be on a blockchain, right? Because you can do a lot of it with a database. So I think, really, number one, there is like, why does it have to be a blockchain? And there has to be a really compelling reason for that and there are compelling reasons for it, right? Like, you want to make something that's difficult to make legible to computers in a way where it can't be spent, in a way where the data can be tracked with Providence. Great, we're in business, right? You're probably on the right tack to something that's going to be investable the other thing, too.
00:19:51.594 - 00:20:50.698, Speaker C: Next thing I kind of look at is, are you solving a real problem for an actually existing human and how do you justify that belief? Right? It's like what you'll find I asked this question just because upstream of it is going to be the next thing, which is can you go to market or go to community? Right? Like when you actually launch this thing, what I see from a lot of people building refi protocols as well is I think this is starting to get better. But what I've seen in the past year is just honestly a lot of opium, man. People are like, hey, we're going to put this thing together. We're going to launch it and people are going to start using it. And I'm like, well, this is where some of the most heinous technology companies in the world, like Facebook and Google have really understood behavioral loops and how to get people engaged. So I'd say that ends up being a really big determinant of who are the markets involved, who are the people involved, and how do you get their attention in a way that isn't just extractive and nonsense. Right?
00:20:50.864 - 00:21:35.706, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a little bit in there about how you have to play Game B, game A to get over to people. You have to play game A to get people to build in Game B, which is one of those sort of paradoxes of Malachian paradoxes of doing something a little bit naughty in order to get people into your more regen stuff. I guess I'm wondering, I think I sort of playfully asked that question about how do we make region web three investable? But you're actually a professional investor working on this. What's your investment thesis? How's it going with Cerulean VC? I'm just curious what kind of trends you're seeing as someone who's been a capital allocator in this space.
00:21:35.888 - 00:22:40.794, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. So I think the thesis you can maybe even have sussed out from a couple of other answers. But really I just think that we need you, and I think we kind of agree on this, is that we need to build a regenerative economy and we need to build it because our lives depend on it in this century, basically our lives and our children's lives. Right. And what does that entail? I think it entails basically when we touched on this a little bit with Griff, but how do we get the attention of the biggest capital allocators just in the world, period, to realize that they all realize they need to build a new economy, but they don't know necessarily where to do that and how to do it. And so for us, one of the big things, we look at basically three things. How do we make blockchains and interacting with them easier, safer, more secure? So we look at a lot of stuff around user experience, smart contract, wallets, decentralized custody, stuff like this, because we deeply believe in what actually is happening under the scenes.
00:22:40.794 - 00:24:16.026, Speaker C: But we need to make sure that, dude, if you have like Deloitte or someone in here coming in to meet their net zero commitments on toucan, they're not going to use a wallet. And if they are going to use a wallet, their CFO is going to have a conniption that's got to have access control permissions and a bunch of security features, right? That doesn't mean that we need to obscure or not build it on blockchain. It means that we need to actually figure out maybe with multiparty computation or other fancy things, how to make that viable for them, right? And so we look at stuff like that. The next step really for us is that there exists right now in these natural asset markets like carbon and other things, there's no real way to help capital make a return on its risk, right? So what I mean by that is you go to any of these account managers or ESG managers, sustainability managers, and you say, hey, what's your carbon strategy, what's your net zero strategy? And they'll be like, great, I basically just have to buy the stuff that's a huge cost center on my balance sheet at the end of the day because either the government said so or we did it because of the volatility carbon markets and being pulled into it by net zero pledges. It would be really great, and it's a thesis area for us if you could make investing in the refi economy something where you might actually get a return. So, like you look around at even the commodities markets for carbon, it's really hard for you to get into things like Chicago Merchant Control Exchange. There's three different types of carbon futures, right? There aren't perps, there aren't options, there's no way for you to hedge really on your positions.
00:24:16.026 - 00:25:18.002, Speaker C: And I'm talking about in the normal world, not in crypto world. And we know this stuff pretty well. Even with the FTX collapse, crypto drives a ton of volume in perps, right? So we look at stuff like that and say, how can we look at this through the lens of a person who's trying to allocate capital to this asset class? If they own a bunch of nature based solutions, how can they actually say, how can they treat it as risk capital and not just a cost center on their balance sheet? That involves building new DeFi primitives with decentralized custody and the trust that you need for enterprises to engage in this market. And so we are very interested in folks who are building cross chain perps, cross chain options, cross chain refi assets, basically. So we look at a lot of that stuff and then lastly, we're just looking at what I'd call the actual refi solutions themselves, right? So we work really closely with Region Network, who's basically the community owned registry for eco asset issuance. And we've touched on a lot of stuff this year. We've made like 16 investments in refi this year.
00:25:18.002 - 00:25:36.454, Speaker C: Actually, sorry, we made 1610 of those are refi. We would call you put in that refi bucket. And for us it's very much just saying how can we begin to build on that vision of more people, more liquidity and price discovery and more actual regenerative solutions, right? Yeah.
00:25:36.492 - 00:26:55.578, Speaker A: It just feels like there's this loop where if we can get like a regen market category leader, it can kind of create this gravity well that pulls in more attention and talent and capital. And then if you go up the food chain from talent and capital to Dows that are successful and then you get to funds that are having good returns through regen, then there's like this copycat effect where you see one Dow that's successful and then 100 other Dows launch. We saw it with ohm, we saw it with Yams. And there's the same effect with funds where if Cerulean could generate outsized returns by investing in Regen Web Three, then that creates this domino effect where all these other funds are just going to follow into it. And so for me, it feels like the highest thing that we can do is create a market success and returns in this category and that'll just create this gravity well that pulls more and more people into regen. Now there's a little bit of like a draw the rest of the owl here because how do you create a giant market success when you're working with public goods and you're competing against projects that are extracting in order to create higher returns? So I think that there's a little bit of an uphill climb to do it, but that's at least how I think about this movement growing bigger.
00:26:55.754 - 00:28:02.886, Speaker C: I think you're spot on, Kevin, because the thing I had this little almost aside in that last bit talking about the thesis where I was like, oh yeah, and Region, the community owned registry. It's like, well, it's a big part of our strategy just because we think, like, look, you can go out there and sort of dink and dunk with your 5 million, $10 million rounds here when you have your interoperability, you can make a pine to interoperability and cooperation. But you really have to ensure that if there is a natural asset issuance happening in the Web Three economy that it is going through, like Dows have governed how it's issued. Those Dows are composed of people who are scientists, land stewards, people who actually understand what's happening with this asset and that it isn't just cornered by one VC chain only that owns all the upside in it and then they'll dump on retail. I don't think that's an outcome anyone wants, basically. Right? We have to find a way to in my opinion, I think we have to have polycentric governance for all of these things. We have to make sure that most people, many of the people who.
00:28:02.886 - 00:28:20.630, Speaker C: Are involved in a cross chain economy for maybe if you just take carbon credit issuance have bags in each other so that we all have pieces of each other and are not just well, it seems like they've aggregated all the demand and they have aggregated all the supply. We should just go with those two and then we have another monopoly dynamic emerging.
00:28:20.710 - 00:28:24.494, Speaker A: The opposite of monopoly. This is pluralism as far as capital goes.
00:28:24.612 - 00:28:25.134, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:28:25.252 - 00:29:04.022, Speaker B: Working in web three is awesome. It's freeing, powerful and so much fun. But working outside of the typical W two employee structure is a deal breaker for so many people. Opolis is helping the self sovereign worker focus on what they do best their work, while Opolis manages the back end. There's a lot of nation state overhead when working in web three, and Opolis takes care of all of the back end stuff, freeing you up to do what you do best your work. Opolis leverages group buying power through a community employment coop, helping you save 20% to 50% on high quality, affordable healthcare options through Cigna. So do what you love and maintain your financial security with Opelis.
00:29:04.022 - 00:29:46.370, Speaker B: You must be authorized to work inside the United States to receive Opelis's benefits. But Opelis is expanding its services to Canada starting on June 1 of next year. So book a 30 minutes free consultation with Opolis experts and join Opolis by December 31 to get 1000 work and a thousand bank tokens go to connect Opolis Co bankless to get started. The world has woken up to refi and Celo is here for it. Celo is the layer one for the regenerative finance movement. It's fast, planet positive, and built for the real world. Celo has committed to producing a sustainable future from day one, and has built its technology around one of the lowest carbon impact consensus mechanisms and is the world's first carbon negative EVM compatible layer one blockchain.
00:29:46.370 - 00:30:20.226, Speaker B: Celo is a movement to create the conditions of prosperity for everyone. Whether it's tokenizing carbon credits with Toucan, providing capital to underserved communities with unicorn, or building for millions of users around the globe. Celo was created to transform crypto enthusiasts into a movement of change makers. Follow along on Twitter@cello.org to learn more about how Celo is accelerating refi for a positive, lasting impact on people, communities and the planet. And if you're a builder interested in refi, be sure to join the build with Celo hackathon live now with a prize pool of over $100,000.
00:30:20.328 - 00:30:39.674, Speaker A: So one of my ideas of how this space can beat the other space is because it's so antifragile. The pluralism creates antifragility. And the other thing that it does is that I think that it creates a better system over the long term. So can you tell me about the meme of patient capital and what that means to you?
00:30:39.872 - 00:31:27.762, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So I just came back from this big impact conference in Zurich called Noa. It's probably all of the major impact investors from the UK, from Germany, and from Switzerland all in the same building. And this is like a very specific phrase that you keep hearing people say, mean, I had entrepreneurs approach me and they're like, oh, you're a crypto VC. Well, we're looking for patient capital. And I was like, on what horizon do you think I'm talking about here? Right. To give you an example, what is patient capital? There is a group that we invest in called Odyssey Network, and they're building a multiparty computation blockchain to power, amongst other things, decentralized custody, but also the types of permissions and access control that normal human beings are used to on the Internet for wallets.
00:31:27.762 - 00:32:26.570, Speaker C: And one thing that really caught our attention was that their founders all gave themselves ten year vests. Right? And so that's an easy deal where actually we're trying to get a lot of our other group, a lot of our other folks, to actually look at this and say, we will take this with you. Right? Like, patient capital is not sending me a pitch deck for a refi project where it's like, hey dude, you get 18 month cliff and three year vest or two year vest in your tokens, then you can dump. Right? That's the opposite of patient capital. I think it's very much making sure that your founders and their teams are adequately capitalized such that they can have some breathing room for 24 to 36 months at a time in terms of capital, and that you're there to support them in their pivots with your eye on a vision of something that's maybe seven to 15 to 20 years out. Right. Like, yeah, our funds life is ten years like everyone else.
00:32:26.570 - 00:32:53.940, Speaker C: But at the same time, we're talking about, if I remind the audience of some of these numbers, a $20 to $54 trillion natural asset economy that's basically unaccounted for. For the most part, carbon accounts for 2 billion of it and there's maybe a little bit more of it tied up in ocean and offsets around that, but not much. Right. So if we are patient with this, we can all win. Pretty much.
00:32:54.950 - 00:33:12.342, Speaker A: Can you tell me where that trillion dollar number comes from? Because I got griff on one shoulder talking about this $10 trillion of public goods if you add up all the spending yearly from local governments. But that sounds like a different number of the market size of region web three.
00:33:12.476 - 00:33:47.746, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I'll send that. Maybe if you have show notes too, you can stick it in there. But there's this paper that was published in Nature, like in 1997 or so. It's called the value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital assets. And they basically go through this framework where they try to look at the oceans, the forests, soil, air quality, and try to price like the economists they are. What is the impact from let's take air quality, right? Air quality is a really difficult one to price.
00:33:47.746 - 00:35:09.722, Speaker C: So they actually take the opposite view of it and say, what is the impact of negative air quality in terms of deaths per year? And then what is the price of a human life? Right? And they basically come up with something like negative air quality takes $2 trillion away from the global economy every year because of early deaths, childhood deaths, lung diseases, all that kind of stuff, right? So then they'll move on to stuff like forests and they say, great, what is the economic value of forest? Well, if we price it straight up on timber only, this is the number we get at now, let's try to include in that as well. Let's try to tie what if they kind of walk through some scenarios here and they say, well, forests produce X amount of oxygen. They also capture particulates. So the stuff that is actually coming into the other side for the air quality argument is kind of coming in on this side with the particulate matter capture that forests and other things do, forests and trees and all that. So through this framework, I'm like summarizing a huge paper, but that's essentially the kind of thing they walk through and say, great, forests do x, oceans do y. Let's then also look at fishery shellfish, all the value that comes that feeds people out of the ocean. Let's also try to look at the value of carbon credits and how much carbon the ocean captures.
00:35:09.722 - 00:35:33.640, Speaker C: It's a substantial amount, something like, don't remember if I'm making this up, so maybe they'll call bullshit on me in the comments, but it's something like 70% to 80% of all of the carbon on Earth is captured by the ocean, right? So that's a substantial amount that we're just walking around going like, hey, isn't it great the ocean does that? Most of us have no idea, right? That's kind of where these numbers come from.
00:35:34.010 - 00:36:57.220, Speaker A: Yeah, well, it just seems like it kind of reminds me of Gitcoin started off focused on open source sustainability and has since grown in scope to think about lots of different types of public goods. But it reminds me of the study that was done in 2014 that basically figured out that the value of all open source software is that it contributes something like $400 billion per year in economic value to society. I think that we've got these similar situations where the economic value of the oceans, the biosphere, as you said, and in my case, coming from open source of open source software these things are public goods that generate value for all of us, but they're not integrated into the markets in such a way that people have an incentive to steward them. And it feels like that's the great question that's a great question of our time is how do you basically reward the people who are stewarding the we could put it in economic terms the generators of this economic value. But there's also moral. We want to support them because they're good in their own. But how do you find the funding for that in the information age? Does that come from taxes? Does that come from Dows? The sustainable funding I think is the missing part in just creating experiments that work at a small scale and scaling those up and proving that it can happen I think is the big opportunity.
00:36:57.590 - 00:37:46.446, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. And I think part of my answer is that it has to come from corporate balance sheets. These guys, many of them to be clear, through no real fault of their own, right? I'm not saying they're blameless, but you run the simulation and you have the agents take the steps in front of them and you're going to lead to many of the same choices, right? You can't rely on people to be like, well I'm just trying to make some clothes bro. I'm trying to do fast fashion here. I don't have my impact on this river priced in because I don't care. I'm just going to do this. But I think I really turn to corporates in a lot of my arguments because I think that they're already participating in some of these markets to a certain degree and we just have to make this more palatable for their risk capital because there's just so much of it man and it can be massively sustainable.
00:37:46.446 - 00:38:24.554, Speaker C: I want to give you an example actually. So one of our portfolio companies is Thalo. They're building a carbon registry and marketplace cross chain on a number of chains. But what's interesting is they've locked up some supply with some very specific partners that no one else has kind of looked at biochar registries. I won't get into exactly what Biochar is. Maybe I'll send you something for the show notes. But what's really interesting here is that they also have built a token and staking dynamic where they're really trying to court traders, commodities traders, right? They want them to have incentives to trade.
00:38:24.554 - 00:39:09.754, Speaker C: They want them to come in and see token go up. But what doesn't exist today. And just to kind of peg this to a real life example, I went to S P Global Carbon Markets which is a conference here in Barcelona and CME Group, Chicago Mercantile Exchange was talking about the types of options and futures that they offer in carbon and what they're building. And you need a very specific type of asset to trade in these markets in my opinion. Because you don't actually just want people to come in and speculate. You want people who will speculate but then are actually going to participate in the market fully. And what I mean by that is if you have an option running, even option position running, you should have to claim the asset underlying it and retire it.
00:39:09.754 - 00:39:45.250, Speaker C: You should have participation in the market, right? You shouldn't just be a guy. Like, I'm trying to make some money off of this. And so Thallo has thought about this quite a bit and then also designed a dynamic with the credits in their marketplace such that they actually do want people to make secondary and tertiary transactions on these. And they're going to basically collect because they are eventually going to build an options marketplace too, or something like it. They're going to have a fund that collects percentages of each transaction and delivers that to project developers on their marketplace. Right. This is the kind of stuff that I really want to see in the world where you have, hey, we're going to have some serious dgen behavior.
00:39:45.250 - 00:40:17.410, Speaker C: We're going to actually make it a safe place for that. We were going to make it plausible. We think it's good. At the same time, we're going to make sure that some of it goes back to the coffers of the people actually developing the carbon projects in real life and we might even begin funding our own projects. Right. I think that's super cool. And that's the kind of thing where you can say, how do we make this a sustainable public good? Well, we've got this place where everyone is incentivized to take the degen action and then we can kind of slice off a little bit of the top for some regen action.
00:40:19.350 - 00:40:46.266, Speaker A: I love that. There's a question on my question list that I've wanted to ask you as we've been going through this, and I think that it might poke at your larger vision in a different way. Why is your Twitter handle against Utopia is question number one? And then the second question is, why is your Twitter name post capitalist network society? Let's unpack both of those.
00:40:46.368 - 00:40:57.962, Speaker C: Oh, for sure, man. So, I mean, I made up the handle on Alark, like, I don't know, seven years ago, six years ago. You've read. Seeing like a state, right? James C. Scott.
00:40:58.106 - 00:41:01.486, Speaker A: Yeah, but the audience may not have.
00:41:01.508 - 00:41:31.354, Speaker C: So just make sure you yeah, sure, I'll unpack it a bit. So we use some terms here that these are the terms when you hear someone use a term you're like, they probably read X book. So legibility has become one of these terms. It predates blockchains by at least 25 years. And it really was popularized by James c Scott. And seeing like a state where the overarching sort of point of that book is that is how plans for modernist authoritarian visions fail. Right.
00:41:31.354 - 00:42:23.418, Speaker C: And one of the key points is that they fail by this concept he calls a heroic simplification. Right? Like, in order for a group to make a decision about a really complex territory, they have to radically simplify the information that they actually are looking at. So this leads to a lot of really adverse outcomes because central planners, you've probably heard this argument before, have to cleave away at information. And some of that information is really meaningful to the local actors on the ground. And so you end up with really what ends up being the exact situation for adverse outcomes, things no one planned for. Right? And so for me, I looked at that book and I was like, whoa, this is the first time I've actually felt what I am like as a person. It actually very much made me realize that.
00:42:23.418 - 00:43:22.422, Speaker C: And I had this sent me on a longer sort of down a longer rabbit hole around a area of philosophy called Epistemological Anarchism, which basically I'm not going to get into, but that's where the name kind of originated. Because Scott's really what I took as Scott's main point is that almost all technocrats who have to sort of radically simplify to make these types of decisions, whether they're in municipalities, localities, states, whatever, are really utopian in their visions. But if you talk to them about this, they'd be like, absolutely not. I did means testing. I did this, that and the other. But at its heart, trying to do these things on this grand of a scale without the feedback loops of local actors and the people who are actually being affected is, in my opinion, very much utopian. And so I look around at a lot of the systems that govern our lives and I think they're like hideously utopian, sometimes with really bad outcomes.
00:43:22.422 - 00:43:42.482, Speaker C: Right. And I think you may have even talked about some of these in your pod before. Right. But that's really where the name comes from. I am against that entire idea, and I think there are none. There are not really any of them. And I think the only ones that exist are the ones that can include as many people as possible and then integrate these visions in a polycentric way.
00:43:42.482 - 00:43:43.330, Speaker C: Pretty much.
00:43:43.480 - 00:44:04.618, Speaker A: So, I mean, I guess the definition through the Oxford Dictionary of Utopia is an imagined place or state of things where everything is perfect. That's the definition of utopia. So the idea here, that is that's a mirage and you're actually like Trojan horsing in Dystopia when you're imagining that you're going into utopia. And that's the thing that we all need to check.
00:44:04.784 - 00:44:09.500, Speaker C: Yeah, and actually that was a really good remix, my friend. That's exactly right.
00:44:10.030 - 00:44:13.630, Speaker A: Okay, cool. And tell me about post capitalist network society.
00:44:14.770 - 00:44:18.720, Speaker C: I kind of play with my Twitter name here and there, but this is the latest one I like.
00:44:19.730 - 00:44:23.274, Speaker A: I'll also say there's a black flag there. Post capitalist network society.
00:44:23.322 - 00:44:29.666, Speaker C: Black flag emoji, of course, not to be mixed up with the bankless Dow, to be clear.
00:44:29.848 - 00:44:30.674, Speaker A: Okay.
00:44:30.872 - 00:44:33.714, Speaker C: Because I do think that I don't know how that works.
00:44:33.752 - 00:44:34.894, Speaker A: Different group of pirates.
00:44:35.022 - 00:44:49.542, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. For me, it's very much the old school plumb line anarchist flag. Right. Basically, what is anarchy? To me, it's maximizing the agency of every human being against hierarchies. Right. That's all it is. And so it isn't anything more than that.
00:44:49.542 - 00:45:17.314, Speaker C: And for me, when I think about a lot of the stuff that's come out in our space in the last year, I think know you had Bellagio on. I actually still have to chat with him. We were in DMs and Twitter about him coming on my pod to talk about network state, which is funny. I just went out there and I don't know, I hadn't read the book yet. And I was just like, network state. It's got the word state in it? No, I was just being stupid, right? But he was like, hey, actually you're going to like chapters four or five or whatever. And I was like, all right, fine.
00:45:17.314 - 00:46:24.274, Speaker C: I'll read it before I talk shit, palagi. But anyway, like, post capitalist network society, basically that's what I think you're trying to bootstrap with this network of impact. Dows man. Basically, how do you get to a point where I don't actually think that capital is such a shit word for where we're at post 20th century? So I do think it just scrambles people's brains when you even talk about it, right? We're like, Are you a capitalist? Are you not? Are you a socialist? Are you this, that and the other. I'm like, honestly, capital is just things that we have all decided are meaningful and we want to dedicate some of those resources for people to support themselves while they do some things that we want them to do, right? And I would like us to get past kind of like this oh, is that a capitalist thing? Is it not a capitalist thing? It's like, how can we just bootstrap new systems of agency, that's all. And then how can we make sure that everyone who kind of wants to move roughly in the same direction can have a network of support that does that? Because I do not think that the state is society, though. I think that some people really try to make that argument.
00:46:24.274 - 00:46:58.290, Speaker C: And it's like, this thing is 200 years old. It doesn't represent all of this. Right? We need to have for me, going back to the original thing around the Black Flag, I would like anyone to have the ability to say, to what degree do I want to participate in the money system? Or in this system where I have to go to this one office and get a passport because I was born in this arbitrary plot of land and I have to because they said so. Right? So that was a bit of a rambly answer. But that's kind of all that's wrapped up in those three words. Yeah.
00:46:58.360 - 00:47:41.502, Speaker A: Well, no, it's reminded me of I've been listening to this lecture series on YouTube called Post Capitalist Desires by Mark Fisher and it's this really beautiful vision know, what comes after capitalism. But it's also a critique of the left and sort of the overconsumption and the it's a critique of that critique of capitalism in order to arrive at what a more post capitalist society could look like and then how do our desires get handled in that? So I think it's a really interesting idea space that maybe I want to explore more in the future, for sure.
00:47:41.556 - 00:49:36.622, Speaker C: And I think Mark Fisher check out Capitalist Realism. If you haven't read it, it's a quick little read and it definitely changed my mind, a lot of things. But the point of it is basically he had been dealing with a lot of depression at the time and basically thinking, like, how is it such that in his time, I think he had committed suicide in 2017 or so, but this was like 2012. His whole point with the book was essentially, how is it that whenever we try to imagine new possibilities, they all happen within market based capitalism? How is it that capitalism subsumes how and why, right? And so that ends up being a quick little study on that. And the other thing, too, like you're talking about with the left, that was the last few years of his work, I'd say the last two or three years of his work was very much focused on that. Not like necessarily punching left, but more just saying, like, how can the various groups of people who call themselves the left work together through the left and get past this concept to something that's a bit more viable? Because I'll tell you, why do I do what I do? I think that there's a lot of folks who are going back to an earlier thing you had said about charities or what have you, right? Like, are some of these things charities or not? One of my thesis is that if we open up participation to these systems to more people, expand the agency of humans, we should be able to compete against market capitalist firms, monopolist firms, duopolist parts of the economy because we are better information processors, we're more resilient. And some of the things you touched on earlier, too, with antifragility and all we need is the right, is just to be able to compete and see what happens, right? In my opinion.
00:49:36.622 - 00:49:43.286, Speaker C: And that's really what I see as like the promise of the stuff. Yeah.
00:49:43.388 - 00:49:53.580, Speaker A: Well, I think it's been really great to have you on and to have this conversation. Is there anything that I didn't ask you that in the last couple of minutes we should jam on?
00:49:55.550 - 00:50:13.214, Speaker C: I don't think so, man. I think we touched on all of it, to be honest, because we could have covered that thing. I did have one thing, like what it needs to happen in the next year or two through the bear for refi builders to really concentrate on. But I really think we covered that, man. I think so. I think we're good. Great.
00:50:13.252 - 00:50:14.900, Speaker A: Well, where can people find you? Online?
00:50:15.670 - 00:50:34.454, Speaker C: Yes. So we already did the quick little study on my Twitter handle against Utopia. You can find me there. I've been pretty quiet lately because it's end of the year, there's just a lot to do. But, yeah, you can find me there. You can find us at Cerulean BC. If you're building in the space, please find us.
00:50:34.454 - 00:50:40.934, Speaker C: Let us know what you're building. Always happy to look at anything related to refi. And that's it. Yeah.
00:50:41.132 - 00:50:43.650, Speaker A: All right. Cheers, man. Thanks for joining.
00:50:43.810 - 00:50:55.820, Speaker C: Thank you for having me, sir. Channel.
