00:00:01.610 - 00:00:12.650, Speaker A: All right, David, we are getting into the roll up section for takes. This is the long awaited moment where we talk about what is going on with GameStop. Why don't we start there, dude? What is going on with GameStop?
00:00:12.730 - 00:00:56.030, Speaker B: All right, so I'm going to explain the backstory here because it's important to understand the story going on here. For those that have watched the movie, the big short, the big short movie depicted this guy who manages a hedge fund who just did some math and saw that there was a problem in the housing market. Right? So he basically called the housing market. And so he opened up a short on the american economy, basically. And then the big short is about just all the people that saw the coming collapse of the housing market. And this guy particularly made his fund a bunch of money. This same guy in the movie, the character that the real person, this is a true story.
00:00:56.030 - 00:01:23.254, Speaker B: That real person made a similar call. So now that he's a legend for calling the eight crisis, people follow him, people pay attention to him. And what he did with this GameStop call is that he looked at the GameStop share price. He noticed that it was trading at a particular value, and then he went and he tallied up all of the assets that GameStop owns, like the real estate, the property, all the real assets, never mind the business model.
00:01:23.372 - 00:01:24.630, Speaker A: This is like their book value.
00:01:24.700 - 00:01:48.270, Speaker B: The book value? Yeah, the assets on the balance sheet. And he said that he thought that the share price was not inclusive of all the value that the company actually owned, like the straight physical assets. And so he said that he is going to make a long position on GameStop because the value of the asset, the value of the company is trading well below the actual value of the underlying assets that they own.
00:01:48.420 - 00:01:59.700, Speaker A: Okay, and where did he say this? Because I remember the big short in 2008. No one would listen to him. He kept going to all these people and everyone was like, yeah, whatever, shut up. We're not listening. Where did he start saying this?
00:02:00.470 - 00:02:39.370, Speaker B: I don't know the answer to that question. I just do know that it was public and it started brewing in the Wall street bets subreddit server. So for those that aren't familiar with the subreddit server, Wall street bets, it's kind of Defi ggens will find themselves very fit, very well in there. It's people that try to make, like, Yolo bets, where they put a ton of money on the line and they mainly do it for engagement, and they either make a ton of money or they lose a ton of money. There's memes it's a little bit like four Chan culture. There's memes, the degeneracy, just like all the memes that you see coming out of corners of the Internet like this was present in Wall street bets.
00:02:39.450 - 00:03:13.606, Speaker A: Okay, so I want to understand the Wall street bets culture, because I think this is important before we go on to the rest of the story. Right. So my impression of Wall street bets culture is they're djens. They're trying to make money, but they know this is all a game, right? They very much know that the system is rigged and is set against them, and that money printer is going burr, and it's distorting the fundamental value of all of these assets, including stocks. And they're just like, what the hell? We might as well benefit from this, too. Is that the culture? Is that the philosophy of Wall street bets?
00:03:13.718 - 00:03:49.910, Speaker B: I don't think it was. It certainly is now. I think it wasn't necessarily that. I think maybe the money printer go Burr was in there just as a casual meme. It was mainly just a meme of just, like, degenerate yoloers, who I think mainly very wealthy people would just yolo $100 into options. And options, for those that don't know, are a way to make or lose a bunch of money all at once. But I would say in order to understand Wall street bets culture, you would need to understand it's very similar to some of the green frog culture that we see in the crypto space.
00:03:49.910 - 00:04:25.406, Speaker B: There's very much this headless movement. It's a cohort, it's a community, right? There are no leaders. It's just what the community thinks. And so if you've ever participated in, like, a chain link community or four Chan community, these are very similar communities. No one is the leader, but there kind of arises a similar energy, a similar just community out of these people, right? And so back to the story. And so this guy that's famous for calling the eight crisis says that GameStop is worth more than what the share price is. And so he buys a position, and that information leaks out into the Internet, public knowledge.
00:04:25.406 - 00:04:56.742, Speaker B: And the Wall street bets subreddit grabs a hold of this, and they start kind of piling on. There are some extremely savy, informed investors who do their own analysis in Wall street bets. And some of the Wall street bets community listens to these people. And so this trade became more or less public knowledge inside the Wall street bets subreddit. And so that means that a bunch of these Wall street bets, they all put their capital into the same spot. And that's a very interesting phenomenon that we're seeing inside of Wall street bets. We're seeing inside of projects like Chainlink.
00:04:56.742 - 00:05:34.870, Speaker B: We're seeing that in projects that are run up by green frogs on four chan, people are coordinating and injecting capital in specific places to collectively pump bags. That's what it's going on here. But at the same time, there's also this fundamentally true and sound trade beneath all these things. So GameStop, or, excuse me, for Wall street bets, they identify this trade in GameStop, and they all start buying spot. They all start taking and putting GME stock into their portfolios. And what that does is that increases the price of the GameStop stock. And so now we have to talk about hedge funds.
00:05:36.570 - 00:05:41.414, Speaker A: So where do the hedge funds fit into this picture? Like shorts. We've heard that term as well, right?
00:05:41.452 - 00:06:24.710, Speaker B: So we need to understand the concept of a short squeeze. And so when you are going short an asset, that means you are hoping that the price goes down. And what that means is that when you short an asset, you borrow it from someone. And so say I have a stock that's worth $100, and you want to short that stock, Ryan. And so you borrow that stock from me, and it's at $100, and then the stock goes down to $50. And then when you borrowed that stock from me, you actually sold it on the market for $100. So you put that $100 into your pocket, kept that there, and then the stock went down $50, and then you bought that stock back off the market and gave that stock back to me, and then you pocketed that $50 difference.
00:06:24.710 - 00:06:57.650, Speaker B: Right. That's a short. That's ideal. If you want to short an asset, it goes down in price, and you get to pocket the difference based off of the moment you shorted it. It can go really wrong in the opposite direction, because, say you borrow a stock from me at $100, and then you sell it, and you're going to return that stock to me at a later date. But instead of that stock going down from, goes up from maybe $300 or maybe $500, I have to pay that entire disc. You have to pay any number.
00:06:57.650 - 00:07:42.142, Speaker B: It could be, it's an infinite level of risk. It could go to a million dollars, and you have to pay back a million dollars even if you just shorted that stock at $100. So there's a large amount of risk. And the thing that funds were doing is many large hedge funds, very wealthy, which are just made up by wealthy investors, were shorting GameStop basically into the ground. And what the important point about this story is that there are alleged accusations of naked short selling, which is short selling the stock without actually borrowing the underlying stock in the first place. Right. Which means that more than the total supply of Gamestop shares were being shorted, which means it's like a fractional reserve system.
00:07:42.142 - 00:07:43.614, Speaker B: It's kind of like, how do people.
00:07:43.652 - 00:07:45.678, Speaker A: Get away with naked short selling?
00:07:45.774 - 00:07:54.354, Speaker B: Because it's illegal and done behind the scenes. I'm pretty sure it's illegal. Is it illegal? YouTube comments let us know if it's illegal or not.
00:07:54.472 - 00:08:22.842, Speaker A: Yeah, I would think that would be definitely illegal. Okay, so these funds are doing possibly naked shorts, which is like, super, any risky super. Right. It's not only illegal, quite possibly. They're betting essentially that this stock does not go up in value at all. And they don't even have the stock backing that bet, essentially. Okay, so they're completely exposed here.
00:08:22.896 - 00:09:13.130, Speaker B: Completely exposed. And they think that they can just short this stock into the ground and make a bunch of money on these shorts. Right. And honestly, maybe it's not right to put sentiments into this, but GameStop is a brick and mortar business during times of COVID I think if somebody said, fuck you for shorting a stock, a brick and mortar company during COVID times, I would agree with that. Markets are supposed to be efficient, but kind of fuck you. And anyways, okay, the thing about shorts is that a short squeeze can happen. And so if you are exposed to a short, as in you owe shares back to someone and those shares double in price, all of a sudden you have to buy back the shares that you borrowed at a higher price.
00:09:13.130 - 00:09:46.114, Speaker B: But if you buy back those shares, say, you're saying, like, all right, I don't want this trade anymore. I've lost money. I'm just going to buy back the shares. I'll cut my losses and I'll pay bet and I'll return the shares to their owner. If you do that, you buy back the shares and that increases the price because you bought them back. Which means further shorts are then pressured even more, because as shorts buy back their shares off the secondary market to cover, they push the price up and up and up, which causes more and more shorts to be influenced to buy back shares. And so it's called a short squeeze.
00:09:46.114 - 00:10:16.350, Speaker B: This thing is explosive. It can turn into a positive feedback loop of people buying back shares off the market. And remember, there was more outstanding short interest than if the floating supply of stock, of game stock, the shares. And so this thing just rocketed from $20 a share up to, like, $350 a share in, like, three days. Right? And so all the companies that were cut short are down, like, 99.9% on their position, right? And these are all hedge funds. And so this is where the drama starts.
00:10:16.510 - 00:10:30.582, Speaker A: Okay, let me ask you here. So Wall street bets culture, obviously, they want to benefit from this trade, right? Totally understand that rationale. Do they also want to screw the hedge funds? Do they want to screw the bankers? Was that part of the motivation behind this?
00:10:30.636 - 00:10:47.674, Speaker B: No, that is a secondary after effect. They just saw a position. They just saw a heavily shorted stock, and they all decided, as a community saying, like, hey, if we all buy GameStop, so many of these hedge funds will have to cover their shorts, that it could trigger a short squeeze. That's exactly what happened.
00:10:47.792 - 00:10:53.870, Speaker A: Okay, what happened to these hedge funds, David? I'm looking at the first headline, fucking wrecked.
00:10:54.290 - 00:10:54.734, Speaker B: All right?
00:10:54.772 - 00:11:20.550, Speaker A: GameStop short sellers lost 1.6 billion in a single day as Reddit traders rebelled against them. That's a 2021 headline. I feel like this is a pretty massive event. This is like main street investors, retail investors, kind of sticking it to the funds in a way that's been kind of the net effect. But the funds got to be pissed about this.
00:11:20.700 - 00:11:23.560, Speaker B: I'm sure I'd be pissed if I lost money, too.
00:11:24.970 - 00:11:47.274, Speaker A: But this sort of thing is, let me say outside of the rules of play, it's a complete off script move. No hedge fund trader. They're all aware of the other traders, another hedge funds who might be coming after them, but none of them anticipated an online community would take this kind of an action. So they were completely caught off guard.
00:11:47.322 - 00:12:09.954, Speaker B: Completely caught, yeah, but they shouldn't be caught off guard if they were paying attention to the fundamentals of GameStop, because they should know that there was a massive amount of short interest out on GameStop. And everyone knows what a short squeeze is. This is not, like, esoteric information. A short squeeze is public knowledge. Right. And the other interesting thing is, Wall street bets is a public discord. Well, it's also a discord.
00:12:09.954 - 00:12:53.514, Speaker B: It's also a subreddit. So all the coordination in the subreddit was done in a public forum where the hedge funds and all their naked short selling is done behind the curtain. Private knowledge. You don't get to know that information. And so this is absolutely a story of just, like, the little guy versus the big elites who have access to financial instruments and have access to financial resources and capital that no one else has access to yet. The Wall street bets, subreddit, they saw the weakness in the armor, and they all realized if they all just go buy the stock, they're going to be able to short squeeze these funds who are trying to wreck this company into the ground. They're going to short squeeze them into oblivion.
00:12:53.514 - 00:12:55.200, Speaker B: And that's exactly what happened.
00:12:55.610 - 00:13:27.134, Speaker A: Okay, so fair story so far it sounds like, right? Fair story. This is all within the rules of play here. Hedge funds are taking massive amounts of risk in taking out these kinds of positions naked. Short selling aside, it's still a massive amount of risk when you're shorting something. And this online community, Wall street bets, is just doing what it normally does. It's seeing an opportunity, and it's pouncing on that opportunity as a community. And the market responds and the stock goes up.
00:13:27.134 - 00:13:29.950, Speaker A: End of story. Right? But it's not the end of story.
00:13:30.020 - 00:13:31.440, Speaker B: It's not the end of the story.
00:13:31.810 - 00:13:45.906, Speaker A: Because the hedge funds and the banking class has something that this Wall street bets rabble, right? This crowd, this online community does not have. They have connections pulled it up.
00:13:45.928 - 00:13:47.170, Speaker B: They have connections.
00:13:48.710 - 00:14:02.140, Speaker A: They have institutional prowess. They have people that they can call on the phone to get to take certain actions against the unwashed masses in the subreddit. So what?
00:14:03.390 - 00:14:42.742, Speaker B: So a large amount of these Wall street bets traders trade on Robinhood, right? This is the retail trader, the little guy, right? So they use the Robinhood application to make their trades. Robinhood shut down trading on the GameStop stock and also the AMC stock. AMC theaters, right? Another asset that has heavy short interest that started to become a target of further Wall street bets. Short squeezes saying, like, hey, like, we just short squeezed the shit out of GameStop. We could probably do it for AMC. And that began to happen. And yet, Robinhood canceled all trading activity on GameStop and AMC as of this morning.
00:14:42.742 - 00:15:28.662, Speaker B: And not only that, but also TGA, Ameritrade. And it gets even worse. We're going to show some tweets and some links in a second. They even took their clients positions and sold them for them. While the trading activity was halted, Robinhood and TD, Ameritrade and other brokerages made orders on behalf of their customers to sell the stock because of market volatility and market risks. So they did other things with other people's money because allegedly, from what we think is true, is that people who had connections at these funds that got wrecked, I can't remember the name of the fund, called up Robinhood and said, yo, shut this down. And we think that's what happened.
00:15:28.662 - 00:15:41.910, Speaker B: And we think that's exactly what Robinhood did. They shut down trading first. They tried to pause the market two days ago, I think when the GameStop share price went up too fast, they halted.
00:15:42.070 - 00:15:44.474, Speaker A: This was like Nasdaq was threatening to use.
00:15:44.512 - 00:15:55.342, Speaker B: Nasdaq halted trading. That was after funds started screaming that they needed to recalibrate their positions, and so they wanted to halt trading. What is that other than.
00:15:55.396 - 00:15:57.882, Speaker A: Because these funds were going bankrupt.
00:15:57.946 - 00:15:59.674, Speaker B: Going bankrupt, getting bankrupt.
00:15:59.722 - 00:16:05.810, Speaker A: Absolutely destroyed. So not only losing billions, but it's costing them their entire fund.
00:16:05.880 - 00:16:09.886, Speaker B: The entire fund. Because there is no cap on risk on short selling.
00:16:09.998 - 00:16:23.640, Speaker A: Right. They're making phone calls, and then they stopped trading for a while, or they threatened to stop trading. So that happened. But this morning was the action that you're talking about, which is kind of like the.
00:16:25.850 - 00:16:26.722, Speaker B: Unprecedented.
00:16:26.786 - 00:16:44.242, Speaker A: Yeah, Robin Hood. Like Robinhood. This is what all the Wall street bets traders use. This is kind of their lifestream into finance, basically, that was being shut down completely from these assets, and their assets were being sold without their permission.
00:16:44.326 - 00:17:17.510, Speaker B: Exactly right. And so this is why when we talk about Uniswap and we talk about being able to control trading and you can't turn it off and you can't permission the assets and you can't permission the network. This is why this is important. Because a bunch of hedge funds made a bunch of calls to a bunch of their market running friends saying, like, hey, I want this to stop because I'm losing money. And they did it, and they listened. And not only that, but Discord, which is one of my favorite applications, canceled. The Wall street bets discord server, private company.
00:17:17.510 - 00:17:53.970, Speaker B: Sure, they get to cancel whoever they want because it's a private company, but like, fuck, where are all these people supposed to meet? The Wall street bet subreddit had to get locked because it was getting briganded by just a bunch of randos. Discord is canceling their server, preventing them from being able to coordinate as people. There's nothing more than oppression and silencing than just being able to cancel the place that these people meet and congregate. It's a violation of what makes America so great. And maybe it's not a constitutional violation because private companies get to silence speech as much as they want, but it's still fucking.
00:17:58.170 - 00:18:40.910, Speaker A: People are angry about this injustifiably. So it's because basically, the banker class and the elites and the people with connections and billions of dollars in funds were able to do things that you and I, or normal people, average Joe's people that are on r Wallstreetbets, cannot do. They don't have these connections. It's like a different set of rules applies for one group of people versus another. Imagine the power. Just because you are getting wrecked on a trade to go delist an asset, that's an insane amount of power. And what's so crazy about this, David, is like, they just did it in broad daylight.
00:18:40.990 - 00:18:42.478, Speaker B: They did it in broad daylight.
00:18:42.574 - 00:19:11.386, Speaker A: So brazen. Did they think that people weren't going to be pissed, that we weren't going to talk about this, that there wasn't going to be massive anger? They just delisted the assets. I mean, these are Robinhood's own customers, right? I can't imagine the amount of pressure that was on Robinhood to get them to turn against their own customers. That affects their business model economically. There must be a massive amount of power here or leverage here to do something like this.
00:19:11.488 - 00:19:25.300, Speaker B: Yeah. People are making calls to say, delete Robinhood. Delist Robinhood. Or delete it from your phone. That's a hashtag that's getting trending on Twitter. Ryan, let's go through some of the tweets and links that we have pulled up. Ready to go.
00:19:25.300 - 00:19:48.790, Speaker B: Representative Talib, actually the same person behind the stable act, calls for congressional hearing on Robinhood's GameStop actions. Nice job. Yes. This is a securities market violation. If we believe in free markets in this country, in the United States, then people actually need to get summoned to Congress. They need to go to court. Somebody needs to go to jail or get fined.
00:19:49.610 - 00:19:55.642, Speaker A: So it's good to see representation talking about this issue. Okay, what's the next tweet here?
00:19:55.696 - 00:20:16.162, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, this is from Russell. He's a football player. I'm not into sports, so I'm not going to try and mispronounce his last name, but this is what's going on. This is a starting pistol for this entire industry, especially for DeFi. Russ is a big bitcoiner. He is one of the few players in the NFL to get paid by bitcoin. I don't think he knows about Ethereum or Defi yet, but if he did, he'd be bullish on it.
00:20:16.162 - 00:20:28.846, Speaker B: Gamestop. Get the dirty fiat and turn it into bitcoin immediately. There's values, virtues, and ethos that are exuding out of this industry that the rest of the world needs, that we need to export to the rest of the world.
00:20:28.968 - 00:20:30.214, Speaker A: All right, let's go to the next.
00:20:30.332 - 00:20:42.280, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Ramp capital. He's a fun meme account. Looks like Robin Hood woke up today and chose violence. Yeah, fuck you, Robin Hood. Tyler Winklevoss. You want this one?
00:20:42.810 - 00:21:16.674, Speaker A: Okay, so what does he say? What kind of a soulless human being do you have to be to short a brick and mortar business during a pandemic? These companies are not even allowed to legally operate. These suits have no solidarity. They care nothing about America. I'm glad Wall street bets is punching back, right? Like he's basically saying, look, they're not good guys here, right? They're just trying to make money. And so when they lose money, they take on this risk and they lose money. So what? Who cares? Put on your big boy pants. This is what the markets do.
00:21:16.674 - 00:21:25.174, Speaker A: You got wrecked. You've wrecked a whole bunch of other people in the past too. This time you got wrecked, you lost. That's how the game's played. Bye bye. See you later. Yeah.
00:21:25.212 - 00:21:27.062, Speaker B: No do overs in public markets, bro.
00:21:27.116 - 00:21:34.410, Speaker A: There's no do overs. You can't pull this kind of thing. I agree with Tyler there. Okay, how about this one AOC is talking about?
00:21:34.480 - 00:21:48.314, Speaker B: This is Dave Portnoy. This is Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports. He goes, when AOC and Donald Trump Jr. Are on the same side, you know you fucked up at Robin Hood app. Yeah. AOC and Donald Trump Jr. Both are populist individuals.
00:21:48.314 - 00:22:03.570, Speaker B: One's a populist for the right, one's a populist for the left. This is a populist issue. This is a few against the many or. Yeah, a few against the many issue. And both AOC and Donald Trump Jr. Are populist leaders for their respective camps, and they're, funnily enough, aligned.
00:22:05.030 - 00:22:11.074, Speaker A: This is the Wall street bets chairman here. Is this a meme account or is this an actual representative from Wall street bets?
00:22:11.202 - 00:22:20.042, Speaker B: Definitely. Well, no one can truly represent Wall street bets yet. This guy is one of the leaders of the community. Yeah.
00:22:20.096 - 00:22:49.054, Speaker A: Okay, so what's he saying here? They can only control us because we use their currency. So Wall street bets historically has not been a crypto friendly community or subreddit. Right. So if you post something about crypto on Wall street bets, it gets auto banned. I'm not sure if this was an outcropping of, like, 2017 or something where there were so many crypto spains like Bitconnect. It was just simpler for Reddit moderators to just ignore the. But they still maintain that posture.
00:22:49.054 - 00:22:57.634, Speaker A: And yet this is kind of making the Wall street bets community open up to crypto, open up to people as a solution. That seems to be what this tweet is.
00:22:57.832 - 00:23:17.126, Speaker B: Mean, we are certainly open to Wall street bets. I hope members of the Wall street bet community understands that this industry is young and nascent, and it's not the industry that it was back in 2017. We have grown a lot, and all of a sudden, a lot of the things that we find valuable, I think the Wall street bets community would also find extremely valuable.
00:23:17.318 - 00:23:20.502, Speaker A: Absolutely. All right, let's go to this next one.
00:23:20.656 - 00:23:52.518, Speaker B: Yeah. One hedge fund blows up a million retail investors. Efficient market instead, a million retail investors blows up one hedge fund. Market manipulation. This is a disk towards people that are for the same reasons that the Wall Streetbets discord server got canceled, because they, the powers that be, are claiming that Wall street bets is manipulating the market. If buying spot is manipulating the market, I guess we're all market manipulators. I guess when you buy something, the price goes up.
00:23:52.518 - 00:24:02.678, Speaker B: Is that market manipulation? No, it's market manipulation to call up Robinhood and say, cancel trading. That's market manipulation. Buying spot is not market manipulation.
00:24:02.854 - 00:24:07.578, Speaker A: Yeah, totally agree. It's crazy that they would even propose that. What's this one?
00:24:07.664 - 00:24:44.854, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a screenshot of somebody who tried to place an order inside of Robinhood. And Robinhood gives them an error message. They wanted to cancel the order that Robinhood placed on their behalf. Robinhood shows them an error message saying, we're sorry, this order can't be canceled, as we placed it to mitigate the risk to your account. Who the fuck are you to control other people's money? You don't know what risk is. The only reason why markets know what risk is is because a diverse set of market participants all bear their own individual risks and they all place their own individual bets. You don't get to determine what other people's risk is.
00:24:45.052 - 00:25:24.482, Speaker A: We're screwing you over for your know, this kind of reminds me, we've talked about it so often, but like the SEC credited investor laws, where you have to have a certain net worth in order to invest in million dollars or over in order to invest at a startup. It's reminiscent of this sort of thing. It's like, sorry, retail investor, you're not smart enough, you're not sophisticated enough to do this, you're not elite enough to do this. So we're going to wall you off from this little corner of finance. We're going to handle this for you. We're going to sell your shares in the brokerage account because it's too dangerous. Absolutely insane that this is the error message that they would put up.
00:25:24.536 - 00:25:26.738, Speaker B: Dude, this one's even worse. Read this one out.
00:25:26.904 - 00:25:41.450, Speaker A: We don't let you buy, only sell. And even if you don't sell, we will sell it against your will. This is Robinhood Terms of service. Is this an email that someone got? So that was a Twitter comment about an email. What's the email say?
00:25:41.520 - 00:26:19.782, Speaker B: Yeah, the email is from Robinhood to this user's inbox, I'm assuming and says important information about your Robinhood account. In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only. Aka, you can only sell. However, due to the unreasonable risk involved in brokering your position, we have closed your 14,500 shares of GME. That's Gamestop for an average price of $118 on January 18, 2021. They just executed orders with their customers money on their behalf. That's crazy.
00:26:19.782 - 00:26:22.306, Speaker B: That's absolutely insane. That's absolutely insane.
00:26:22.418 - 00:26:41.070, Speaker A: All right, so what does this all mean? Right? So, like populism, people are pissed. Banks are doing things with political connections. Bankers and hedge fund managers and the wealthy elite are doing things that retail can't do. David Defi fixes this.
00:26:41.140 - 00:26:45.280, Speaker B: DeFi fixes this. This is what we have been chanting for so long.
00:26:45.970 - 00:27:23.482, Speaker A: So you can't delist an asset from Uniswap. In fact, anyone in the world can list an asset on uniswap. It hasn't happened on Uniswap. It can't happen on uniswap. This is the idea behind protocols rather than banks. This is the idea behind outsourcing. This sort of like creating institutions that are not based on corruptible human beings, right? This is what DeFi is all about.
00:27:23.482 - 00:27:53.620, Speaker A: This openness, this transparency, this access to the world. Everybody has a fair playing field. It doesn't matter what country you're from. It doesn't matter what bankers, you know, what politicians you can call how much money you have. Everybody is treated equally. Everybody is treated the same. This is an institution that makes way more sense to build on top of than the corrupted banking institution right now.
00:27:53.620 - 00:28:01.222, Speaker A: Is this a DeFi moment? Maybe mainstream doesn't realize it yet, but is this a defi moment for us?
00:28:01.276 - 00:28:49.410, Speaker B: This is an absolute defi moment. And I think if people were more savvy to what's going on, I think we would see, because markets are supposed to be efficient. If some news breaks, then assets tend to move. The reason why I think that it's going to take a while for people to digest this information and then connect it to defi on Ethereum, because if people did make those connections, we would see assets like you and I just absolutely mooning right now. I think that's the case. And the important thing, I think, to take away from this whole ordeal is that things that are deep in the protocol sync, the protocol sync thesis that we chant about all the time on the bankless program, the things that are deep in the protocol sink. The things that are neutral are inherently flat.
00:28:49.410 - 00:29:27.314, Speaker B: They are flat landscapes for economic activity, right? And that flat landscape means a neutral playing field, a flat playing field where no one has advantages over any others. And that's what scares all the legacy institutions, is because they have built systems that are not flat. They have built systems that privilege themselves over their users, over other people. And the elites are on the peaks when everyone else is in the troughs. Right? And this is what Ethereum can bring to the world, a loving playing field. Bitcoin is famously known as the separation of money and state. And Ethereum is the separation of economy and state.
00:29:27.314 - 00:29:58.262, Speaker B: There's no reason why the economy, the quote, unquote the market, should be under control of Robinhood or TD ameritrade or anyone that can pick up a phone call, make a phone call and stop canceling. If somebody has the ability to stop trading of something, then the market is controlled. And the market inherently does better when it's not controlled. And unless the free market is not free, unless it actually manifests itself on Ethereum, there's no other place in the world to have a free market other than Ethereum.
00:29:58.406 - 00:30:10.510, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so here's the thing. Listeners of bankless will know that we are bullish. Bitcoin. Like, we like bitcoin. It's a good asset. But bitcoin doesn't fix this.
00:30:10.510 - 00:30:44.954, Speaker A: It doesn't have the answer to this problem. Right? Coinbase, binance, anywhere that you can purchase bitcoin today can still delist those assets with a phone call with government regulation. Right? So, like, bitcoin is one part of the defi story. But if you just stop with bitcoin maximalists and maximalism, you don't get what we're talking about. A censorship resistant, permissionless, open financial system that solves the problem of GameStop and Robinhood. You need something like uniswap. You need money protocols in order to do this.
00:30:44.954 - 00:31:06.942, Speaker A: I've seen many kind of maxillist thought leaders say, yeah, bitcoin's the solution. And it's like, no, it's not, dude. It's not like defi is the solution. I was glad one of the Winklevoss twins said that. It's bitcoin, Ethereum and Defi. Without all of these things, you can't actually solve what we're talking about today. We've been saying this since the beginning.
00:31:06.942 - 00:31:57.438, Speaker A: You need a bankless money system if you're going to have a free money system, or else you get the same system that we've already built. It's just built on a different store of value. New set of bosses, new set of bankers. That's not what we want. Ethereum really does solve this, David, maybe you've got a comment on that. But I also want to ask you about what is it really going to take for the world to start seeing this? Is the user experience just too hard on Defi now? Is it just like for somebody who's used to Robinhood, and they switch over to crypto and Defi, and they have to do metamask, and they have to do private key management, and there's gas fees on uniswap. Is that just all too much? Or why haven't we seen this influx of retail coming from the disenfranchised Wall street bets crowd?
00:31:57.534 - 00:32:35.950, Speaker B: Well, I think a very simple answer is to say that GameStop is not available on Ethereum. That's not where the GameStop, the asset trades. And so first, we just need assets on Ethereum that people are interested in. And while many of these DeFi tokens that we are so hyped about, I think are truly revolutionary, they are unfamiliar to the legacy market participants who are looking to. Because when Wall street bets chats, they're not chatting about Defi tokens, they're chatting about things on Robinhood. Robinhood has actually done a terrible job adding new assets, crypto assets, into their platform. They actually have a category in crypto assets called the Ethereum family.
00:32:35.950 - 00:32:38.334, Speaker B: You want to know what's in there, Ryan? Yeah.
00:32:38.372 - 00:32:39.982, Speaker A: What's the Ethereum family?
00:32:40.036 - 00:32:41.818, Speaker B: Ethereum and Ethereum classic.
00:32:41.994 - 00:32:43.200, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:32:43.890 - 00:32:44.886, Speaker B: Terrible. Terrible.
00:32:44.938 - 00:32:51.618, Speaker A: So correct me if I'm wrong, but with Robinhood, David, you can't actually withdraw to an ETH address.
00:32:51.704 - 00:32:53.966, Speaker B: Basically, you don't get access to underlying.
00:32:54.078 - 00:33:26.190, Speaker A: What they're selling you is ious of something. They could pull the same shit they just pulled on GameStop, which is like, sell your eth out from under you, take it, like cancel it, delete it. They can pull all of that because they are purely a bank selling ious. They're not selling actual ether that you can withdraw from their exchange. Robinhood is not the place. If you're a millennial, if you're a zoomer, go level up on DFI. We're going to need this tech for the hope this week made it obvious we need to be leveling up on these things.
00:33:26.190 - 00:33:32.926, Speaker A: And I feel like sometimes, David, people just like, it's too hard, right? It's not that hard.
00:33:33.028 - 00:33:38.420, Speaker B: Yeah. And you got paid $20,000 if you use DFI in 2020. What do you mean it's not hard?
00:33:41.910 - 00:33:57.830, Speaker A: Your friends outside of crypto, right? What do you think their reaction is going to be as a result of this? They say something about this. I know they're going to talk about this. And you say, yeah, this is why DFI exists. So what's their objection to coming on board of DFI? What are they going to say?
00:33:57.900 - 00:34:27.618, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good question. There is a group chat that I'm in of roughly twelve people who are people that are DFI curious, but many of them come from the legacy markets. And there was just general consensus that this pissed them off, this just riled them up. And I think that's the energy that we need for people to feel. That is motivation. That's pure motivation. They're angry at something, and Defi allows that anger to be expressed in productive ways.
00:34:27.618 - 00:34:52.582, Speaker B: Right. We can take that riled up energy and we can put it into the DeFi ecosystem. I think that the barrier to adoption and the barrier to understanding just got a lot lower. It's a frequent phrase that we say on the bankless program that the most bullish thing about this industry is to become understood. And this is one of the most exposing pieces of news that has ever come across the news cycle at all.
00:34:52.636 - 00:34:52.866, Speaker A: Right?
00:34:52.908 - 00:35:14.730, Speaker B: The canceling of an asset on an exchange, that's insane. I don't think there's ever going to be this one magic moment where all of a sudden all of Wall streetbest is like, yo, let's go trade on uniswap. It's just going to be a slow trickle, but like I said, the barrier is getting lower and lower and lower, and it's allowing more and more water to fall over it faster and faster.
00:35:14.890 - 00:35:49.062, Speaker A: Yeah. And at the same time, Defi is getting more and more. So the truth is, if we had that influx now from Wall street bets, we couldn't take it. I mean, too many transactions, gas fees would spike. But at the same time, Ethereum, Defi is developing layer two, right, to start to add other containers for this liquidity and for these users. So we also don't want it to happen all at once. It's better for it to kind of trickle in but look, man, this is populism.
00:35:49.062 - 00:36:23.240, Speaker A: This is the feel like, this is not going to go away. It's only, if anything else, it's coming from the right, it's coming from the left in politics, it's only going to get worse. And one of the reasons, David, I'm in this industry, and I think this is true for you, is because this allows us to channel populism and this anger into something productive. We're not just focused on tearing it down. Right. Because you could look at this and get pissed like, I want to revolt. I want to occupy Wall Street, I want to storm the banks, I want to get the hedge funds who did this.
00:36:23.240 - 00:36:49.502, Speaker A: That's one approach. The DeFi, the crypto approach is we're going to build a new system that's credibly neutral and doesn't have the dependencies of the old system. And all that anger that we feel, we're going to channel that into something productive. We're going to build an entirely new financial system from the ground up. Right. Because populism can get really ugly for human beings. Like, famously, the 1930s, populism led to a world war.
00:36:49.502 - 00:37:07.026, Speaker A: Right. That could happen here. But the reason I'm in Ethereum, the reason I'm in DFI and crypto, is because it's a way to channel that populism into a movement that is all about building new structures and institutions for the world. So it's exciting from that perspective, too.
00:37:07.128 - 00:37:26.650, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right. Another concept that we talk about on the bankless program frequently is that before 2008, there was no place to exit to. Right. And then bitcoin came. Right. And in 2021 and the financial crisis of 2000 and 22,021, because of COVID there is actually a place to exit too. Right.
00:37:26.650 - 00:37:32.250, Speaker B: There is actually a way for that populist angst and that populist energy to be expressed, invented.
00:37:32.330 - 00:37:32.574, Speaker A: Right.
00:37:32.612 - 00:38:03.954, Speaker B: We actually have solutions for this. To me, this really echoes sentiments of the fourth turning concept, where there is distrust in legacy institutions. No better of a more salient example of institutions canceling their customers orders against their will to profit, to make sure that the elites can keep their money. Distrust in institutions. And meanwhile, we are erecting new institutions for people to adopt instead. So we are changing the guard. It's not going to happen overnight.
00:38:03.954 - 00:38:13.702, Speaker B: It's going to take a decade. But people are looking for new institutions these days because their old institutions are failing them. And there's no better, more salient of example than what happened recently.
00:38:13.846 - 00:38:39.700, Speaker A: Absolutely. Well, this is turning into an interesting year for sure, with 2020. I think this is going to be a big year for crypto, a big year for the social movement that is crypto, the technology that is crypto, and probably the price in the bull market that is crypto right now. So very exciting. We're glad to have you on bankless, David. You feel like you got that out of your system, man, this is catharsis for you. I know you were angry this morning.
00:38:40.150 - 00:39:01.590, Speaker B: I was pretty angry this morning. And the thing is, my one final comment on this is there's no reason to think that this was a one and done. The Wall street bets community just figured out that they are a force. They are a fund, just like actual funds. They are a collective community of people that have the ability to allocate capital.
00:39:01.750 - 00:39:02.758, Speaker A: They are a Dow.
00:39:02.854 - 00:39:26.978, Speaker B: They are a Dow. They are a Dow. They are literally a Dow. And they are only going to grow massively. First off, all of them just got really rich, even though some of them kind of got wrecked by Robinhood. People that were making the trade before the short squeeze just made massive upsides. Like if you were in options, you could have turned $1,000 into $20 to $50,000, depending on your position.
00:39:26.978 - 00:39:47.400, Speaker B: So now they're well funded. Now they realize that they are a force. They are more organized. They are more coordinated with each other. And I think that this is just going to be the first of many coordination attacks on legacy institutions like this. Legacy markets. I think this is going to be only the first of many episodes like this to come.
00:39:47.850 - 00:40:07.002, Speaker A: Well, I can't wait for that group to start to get their minds wrapped around Defi, and I'm excited to help in any way. So, David, this has been our roll up. As always, guys. Risk into disclaimers. DeFi is risky. ETH is risky. Apparently, so are the traditional financial markets.
00:40:07.066 - 00:40:07.710, Speaker B: Weird.
00:40:09.410 - 00:40:17.530, Speaker A: But you could lose what you put in, of course. But this is the frontier. We are headed west. Thanks for joining us. This has been the weekly roll up from bank.
