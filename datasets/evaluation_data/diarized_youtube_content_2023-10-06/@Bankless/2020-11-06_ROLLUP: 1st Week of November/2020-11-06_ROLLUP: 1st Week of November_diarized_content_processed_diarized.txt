00:00:08.570 - 00:00:56.622, Speaker A: If you want to live a bankless life, you need to get a hardware wallet. There is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self sovereign fashion. That's why I have four ledgers that I use to manage my different crypto assets using the Ledger live account as well. Ledger live is like your home base for managing your Ethereum, Defi and crypto accounts. It does a really good job of aggregating all of your different Ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one. But you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is, and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page. One thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and Ryan talk about with the bankless Guildcube enabled in the Ledger Live app.
00:00:56.622 - 00:01:34.666, Speaker A: So right now in the Ledger live app, you can buy, sell and stake your crypto assets, which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skillcube. Something that's new to Ledger live is Ledger swap, where you can swap assets one for another directly inside the ledger live application, ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity. On Ethereum and on bitcoin, there's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet. I personally like the Ledger Nano X, but I also have both. They're both great options. When you own a ledger, you own your own assets in the way that.
00:01:34.688 - 00:01:36.902, Speaker B: They have been designed to be held.
00:01:37.046 - 00:01:42.566, Speaker A: By the user and the user alone. So go get your ledger today to make sure that you are as self.
00:01:42.608 - 00:02:14.866, Speaker B: Sovereign as possible, bankless is brought to you by Wyrn. Wyrn is Defi's first self building, community run project which I just get really, really excited about. Wyrn is a system that seeks out yield in DeFi, and it does that in a number of different ways. A very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different DeFi experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token, right? And so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in Defi.
00:02:14.978 - 00:02:16.546, Speaker A: For those who want to just earn.
00:02:16.578 - 00:02:22.874, Speaker B: Yield on their stablecoins, the earn system is for you, where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and Wyrn will go.
00:02:22.912 - 00:02:24.986, Speaker A: And figure out which money market on.
00:02:25.008 - 00:02:36.734, Speaker B: DeFi in DeFi is producing the best interest rate, whether it's dytx, it's compound or Aave. It looks around Defi to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stablecoins automatically so you don't have.
00:02:36.772 - 00:02:40.302, Speaker A: To check them out at yearn finance to get started.
00:02:40.356 - 00:02:43.118, Speaker B: And also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing.
00:02:43.204 - 00:03:08.818, Speaker C: Hello bankless nation. Welcome to the first week of November. This is your weekly roll up, a show where David and I go through all the essential things you need to know about that happened in the past week in crypto. We release this, as always, on Friday morning. So you can enjoy it with breakfast, enjoy it with your morning cup of coffee, and get caught up on all the news. As always, we try to do this in 25 minutes. So 5 minutes per section.
00:03:08.818 - 00:03:22.278, Speaker C: We're going to cover market releases, news, hot takes, and finally end with what we are excited about. This comes out on YouTube, also comes out on the podcast, so you can catch it both ways. David, how are you doing today, man?
00:03:22.464 - 00:03:46.950, Speaker A: Absolutely fantastic. There's just so much energy in the crypto industry right now and we are trying to get some of that energy and why we are so energetic injected straight into your brain in a roll up fashion. So if you don't have the time or energy to pay attention to everything that goes on in this super fast paced world, then we are going to bundle that information up and in eject it right into your brain.
00:03:47.610 - 00:03:50.358, Speaker C: All right, David, you ready? Shall we roll them up?
00:03:50.444 - 00:03:51.126, Speaker A: Rolling them up.
00:03:51.148 - 00:04:02.026, Speaker C: All right, let's roll them up. Roll them up. All right, we're starting with Market. David, what is the market saying? You want to start with bitcoin here and I'm going to show something on my screen. Show some bitcoin price action while we are talking about it.
00:04:02.128 - 00:04:43.506, Speaker A: Yeah, bitcoin is just marching up and to the right. Maybe it had to do with the election, maybe it was going to do this anyways. But it is really pushing up against its all time high, at least with regards to how long it has spent above the $15,000 mark. So it is currently, at the time of speaking, $15,200. As far as bitcoin goes, that's basically its all time high in terms of time. It has spent very little time above this number, very few sellers is the theory above 15,000, what is this election?
00:04:43.618 - 00:04:55.914, Speaker C: So we've got probably a Republican Senate probably. And we probably have Biden as president. I don't know. It's looking that way. That's what the prediction markets are telling us is that part of the reason you think?
00:04:56.032 - 00:05:05.066, Speaker A: I think so. A republican controlled Senate means that we are probably not rolling back Biden's tax cuts, tax plans.
00:05:05.098 - 00:05:05.294, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:05.332 - 00:05:18.606, Speaker A: Which is bullish for asset prices. And a Biden led presidency means we are definitely adding more stimulus into the economy, which both of those things are bullish for assets and bitcoin specifically.
00:05:18.798 - 00:05:22.866, Speaker C: All right, quick take. Do you think bitcoin is going to hit all time high in 2020 or no?
00:05:22.968 - 00:05:33.602, Speaker A: Oh, God. I wouldn't be surprised if it did. I couldn't say. Because the thing is, it's going so fast and it's really accelerating. I think it's in the cards.
00:05:33.746 - 00:05:42.402, Speaker C: It's going to start hitting headlines soon, and then it sort of becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Okay, let's talk about the next thing. Bitcoin on Ethereum. What's happening there?
00:05:42.556 - 00:05:46.522, Speaker A: The number is higher. It's always higher number one, than it was last week.
00:05:46.576 - 00:05:47.546, Speaker C: It's gone up. All right.
00:05:47.568 - 00:05:52.442, Speaker A: It's gone up. Last week is 149,000, and this week it's 153,000.
00:05:52.576 - 00:06:07.406, Speaker C: All right. From 2 billion to 2.3 billion. It's going up. All right, next, you want to talk a little bit about bitcoin futures volumes, because that's been crazy as well. This is CME future volumes, which is CFTC regulated. That's hitting some all time highs too, right? Crazy.
00:06:07.508 - 00:06:18.686, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just all time highs left and right. And that's one of the reasons why there's so much energy and excitement in this space. We are just getting more and more external validation that people are interested in bitcoin.
00:06:18.878 - 00:06:30.998, Speaker C: All right, let's get to ETH price. Eth. How are we doing, little guy? So ETH is 413 as of right now. It hit a bit of a bump. Not quite as large as bitcoin. What's going on with ETH price?
00:06:31.084 - 00:06:48.190, Speaker A: Yeah, well, naturally, the ETH price hit a bump, hit a little pump when the deposit contract got announced, but it looks like it struggled to really follow through on that. We're going to talk a little bit more about that, but all of crypto seems to be moving up into the right, and ETH is no exception.
00:06:48.690 - 00:07:09.110, Speaker C: Yeah, it might be sort of just waiting for the realization of staking to come out there. We'll talk a little bit more about that right now. But so far the pump has been a bit underwhelming. Do you want to talk a little bit about total value locked in DFI? What's that hanging out? Right now? We've got 11.7 billion. That's about flat, isn't it?
00:07:09.180 - 00:07:32.730, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty flat on the higher side of flat, I would say. But like we've known, DFI is still doing its retracement. Some people have called the bottom on DFI yet to be seen. I'm in that camp that the bottom on DFI is down. But that means that the fact that total locked in DeFi, the fact that that's flat, is actually kind of bullish. While Defi retracts total locked in DeFi is flat.
00:07:33.170 - 00:07:56.146, Speaker C: I guess going back to ETH, I know one thing we wanted to mention is this tweet of yours. We constantly talk about the three value accrual mechanisms of ether, and we've got one which is store of value in DeFi that we just talked about, value locked in Defi. But there's two more that are kicking in here. And you tweeted this out here about ETh's three pillars of value accrual. What are the two others, David, and when are they coming?
00:07:56.248 - 00:08:31.760, Speaker A: Yeah, so we got the green check mark. Next to a store of value in DFI, we have the capital asset in proof of stake on the horizon that's happening on December 1. We have an actual date for that, assuming enough ether gets deposited into the deposit contract. Both Ryan and I on our alpha leak episode indicated our bullishness that that's going to be met by December 1, and then on the horizon after that is consumable asset in EIP one five. Five to nine, which Tim Baco, the most informed individual on this matter, predicts a nine month time horizon for that?
00:08:32.290 - 00:08:57.394, Speaker C: Yeah. All right, very cool. So the three pillars, and it might be the case that we've often said 2020 is 2016, and then next year is 2017, where everything kind of explodes. It looks like the plan is coming together on ether value accrual. Hey, we don't have much time to talk about this, but you want to talk about other markets, which is prediction markets for the presidential election. That's been crazy. In crypto.
00:08:57.394 - 00:09:05.002, Speaker C: There's some markets where you can actually bet on Biden versus Trump, and we've seen some pretty heavy volume. Here's one on FTX. What's your take?
00:09:05.136 - 00:09:42.966, Speaker A: Yeah, I think prediction markets were the unsung hero of the crypto world during the election. They did their jobs right. They had high volume, high liquidity, and they really allowed people to express their version of the future and make a trade against that. And one thing I think was really cool was this catnip project, which was a combination of money legos between balancer and Auger that allowed you to buy no Donald Trump tokens or yes Donald Trump tokens through the balancer interface, KYC free using them that everyone knows and loves. Using the money legos that people know how to use.
00:09:43.148 - 00:10:15.902, Speaker C: Yeah, and I understand you put a bet on the DeFi prediction market polymarket, and tried that out. And it's cool that all of these markets are changing in real time. So at one point when it looked like Trump could win this, they were trading Trump, but likelihood very high. And when things have switched around now they're trading pretty low. So they're saying that the ods of Trump winning are about 10% or so, 10% to 15% at this point in time, which feels about right. Very cool to see them respond this way. All right, David, that's markets.
00:10:15.902 - 00:10:23.106, Speaker C: Let's talk about the next thing. What's going on with releases? Let's talk about the big release first, shall we?
00:10:23.288 - 00:10:51.370, Speaker A: What is the most obvious release other than the release of the deposit contract for Ethereum 2.0? If you've been following the bankless media or other Ethereum people in the space, you should have been seeing this coming from a long way off. But if you're perhaps new to the space or you're coming from people that don't really speak about Ethereum, maybe this is a surprise to you. Either way, this really locks in how the fact that Ethereum 2.0 is so close and we're starting with phase zero. And we actually have a date for.
00:10:51.440 - 00:11:20.322, Speaker C: Phase zero, phase zero, December 1. And David, we are just pumping out content on staking in particular and ETH two at bankless. So we've got our alpha league videos, of course, we've got the staking how to become a validator and stake your ETH that we just published on bankless as well. And just today we released a whole economics article on ETH 20 staking, comparing it to a bond, which we can talk about later. Man, that's such a huge release. This has been like five years, five years coming.
00:11:20.376 - 00:11:22.034, Speaker A: The genesis since Genesis of Ethereum.
00:11:22.082 - 00:12:01.106, Speaker C: Yeah, we've said this before, this is absolutely huge news. I think the biggest news, at least of this year, if not of the past several years. All right, we've talked about that enough in other places, but maybe let's look in the FTX news. So saw this on coindesk, David. FTX, which is an exchange, we call them crypto banks, is going to list beacon chain Ether. So that means that they are going to list and start trading not ether in ETH one, but this actual derivative ether in ETH two as a product, and they're going to somehow trade it. What's your take on that?
00:12:01.208 - 00:12:10.370, Speaker A: Yeah, so some people said that something like this was inevitable. The point about the deposit contract is when you put your ether from the ETH one chain into it, it's a one way bridge.
00:12:10.450 - 00:12:10.694, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:10.732 - 00:12:24.870, Speaker A: And so then you have your ether on the e two chain, and you can only have it on the e two chain, and you can't go backwards. But some people might want liquidity between eth one and e two, and the only way to do that is through a centralized operator.
00:12:24.950 - 00:12:25.146, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:25.168 - 00:12:54.482, Speaker A: And so FTX is going to enable you to stake your ether, put your ether from eth one into eth two through their centralized system, and then allow you to trade what is essentially a derivative of ether on their centralized exchange. I really just don't think this is a big deal. The people that are going to be putting their ether from eth one to eth two are the stakeholders of Ethereum who are just in it for the long haul by definition. I don't really see who's going to be speculating on this. I don't really see what this is for.
00:12:54.616 - 00:13:25.622, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. And I think the launch of e two is really geared towards hardware centric folks that are just running their own. So there will be these crypto exchanges that do it, too, which is good. I mean, the more stakers, the better, and the more we have, the better. I kind of agree. We'll have to see how it pans out, but I don't think there's any fear, uncertainty and doubt associated with that. Speaking of eth two, Trent put together this fantastic graphic of how all of the phases relate.
00:13:25.622 - 00:13:39.554, Speaker C: We were showing the graphic on YouTube, but for folks that are listening on audio, David, could you just give a quick, like, what's going to happen in phase one? Phase zero. Phase one. Phase one five at least. How is it going to blend together?
00:13:39.672 - 00:13:58.210, Speaker A: Yeah, Trent did a good job of kind of bundling everything up, because in addition to going from phase zero to one to 1.5 to two, there's also the parallel roadmap of roll ups, which kind of have their own place in the roadmap. Right now. We are at phase one. We are at the point where people are putting money into the deposit contract.
00:13:58.290 - 00:13:59.254, Speaker C: Phase zero, right?
00:13:59.292 - 00:14:19.822, Speaker A: Excuse me? Phase zero. Phase zero, yes. People are putting ether into the deposit contract, and then that heartbeat of ethereum, which is phase zero, gets up and running. And then the prediction, therefore, after that is phase one will come in nine months to a year after that. That's what Preston van Loon said on our previous video. So check that out. And then we get into phase 1.5.
00:14:19.822 - 00:14:47.014, Speaker A: And the reason why phase 1.5 is so important is think of Ethereum 2.0 as a rocket ship with 63 rockets on it, right? And then this 64th rocket, which is Ethereum one, comes in, docks and it loads into the rest of the bigger rocket ship. And then all of a sudden there's 64 rocket ships. And once it's in there, once the Ethereum 1.0 gets loaded into the Ethereum 2.0 ship, then it's all one entire thing.
00:14:47.014 - 00:14:56.582, Speaker A: And we have ethereum one rolled into ethereum two. And that's how we do the seamless transition. That's the roadmap ahead of us. Trent did a really good job illustrating that in this graphic.
00:14:56.726 - 00:15:27.922, Speaker C: Dude, nice analogy. And the reality is we could have phase one five done sometime in maybe 2022. So that's going to be fantastic. And that's when the old proof of work dies and eth issuance drops to below 1%. How crazy is that? All right, David, we don't have time to talk about all of these things, but loop ring just put out some cool stuff. We'll include a link in the show notes. And Verizon is doing more with the blockchain.
00:15:27.922 - 00:15:53.174, Speaker C: I guess that bleeds into the news. Let's talk about what's going on in the news. Australia joining the club. They are running a central bank digital currency pilot right now with consensus. So that would be on a private version of Ethereum, but we're seeing all the central banks do something in this space, and it feels like they're all crowding into it in the last six months, I think that's only going to accelerate. Yep.
00:15:53.222 - 00:16:26.066, Speaker A: Central bank digital currencies are hot. There's been at least two central banks doing a central bank digital currency in the last two roll ups, right? So this is like our 6th or 7th or 8th central bank digital currency, right? And also, tip of the hat to consensus is always there behind the scenes, helping these banks do their thing. We got into an argument, Ryan, in the bankless discord about are these central bank digital currencies going to be based on ether. On Ethereum, or are they going to be their own totally centralized ledger? That's going to be an interesting discussion.
00:16:26.258 - 00:16:48.574, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. And it might be a little blend of both where they use their own totally centralized ledger and then settle on Ethereum for some things. But let's talk about the other signals that are going on. This is a massive one, dude. This is PayPal, right? In their Q three earnings report. This is their earnings call that they have with investors. If you read this snippet of the transcript, I want to talk about.
00:16:48.574 - 00:17:17.986, Speaker C: This might be their CEO talking. It's one of their executives. Anyway, he says this. Finally, I'd like to discuss our recent announcement to increase the utility of cryptocurrencies as well as embrace new forms of central bank digital currencies. Again, PayPal is adding the ability to purchase crypto in PayPal. And then in 2021, they're adding it to venmo. And he says this, we are entering a new era of financial services where our wallets and all the services around them are moving from physical to digital.
00:17:17.986 - 00:17:31.930, Speaker C: Sounds like he's listening to bankless. David, what do you think? Man, that's pretty bullish. Largest corporations, largest payment processors, they're coming to crypto. Same time, central bank digital currencies. Central banks are signaling this way. Everybody is coming to crypto.
00:17:32.510 - 00:17:37.022, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just a massive convergence upon this new realm of money.
00:17:37.076 - 00:17:37.294, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:37.332 - 00:17:52.990, Speaker A: This new way to host and have money. So not only is the central bank digital currency room crowded, the companies jostling to serve central bank digital currencies are also playing that same game. There's a lot of competition for companies who want to serve these central banks.
00:17:53.150 - 00:18:17.690, Speaker C: Yeah. Mastercard joining the fray. Their president this week says their crypto patents will pay off when the central bank digital currencies arrive. Everyone thinks central bank digital currencies are coming. Even the biggest banking processors, payment processors in the world right now. Fidelity also is doubling down. They're hiring 20 crypto engineers to work on their blockchain side of things.
00:18:17.690 - 00:18:21.862, Speaker C: 20 plus, that's a very large amount. All crypto blockchain.
00:18:21.926 - 00:18:28.606, Speaker A: That's a large amount. Yeah, dude, there's not that many blockchain crypto. Where are they going to find out there? Yeah, where are they going to find them?
00:18:28.628 - 00:19:02.214, Speaker C: Find them. So this is a trend that's happening. I expect we'll update more on this in the rollups to come real quick. David, we should talk about this story, too. Us officials just seized more than $1 billion. It was funny on Tuesday, everyone kind of woke up to the fact that some money was getting transferred, old money, billion dollars worth of old bitcoin that hadn't moved since, like, 2012 or something was being moved. And it was one of the largest holding addresses in all of bitcoin.
00:19:02.214 - 00:19:05.546, Speaker C: We just found out what that was. What was it, David? Yeah.
00:19:05.568 - 00:19:34.180, Speaker A: So it was an outgrowth of Silk Road bitcoins. Apparently whoever controlled the private keys for these bitcoins stole them from the Silk Road, stole them from Ross Ulbrich himself. And because of that, the US government was like, this is ours. Thank you. The unknown about this story is how the US government identified this individual and then got him to willingly forfeit the funds to him, probably with threats of jail time for life or something like that, because that's what they can.
00:19:35.990 - 00:19:38.738, Speaker C: Ross is living example.
00:19:38.904 - 00:19:50.930, Speaker A: Yep. And so now the big takeaway of the story is that the US government has a billion dollars worth of bitcoin. They're probably going to have to auction it off, and that's going to be an interesting development.
00:19:51.090 - 00:20:27.726, Speaker C: That's what they did with their last dash. I wonder how long it takes them. I'm sure they'll find lots of institutional buyers this time. Even last time they did this, in 2013, folks from their venture capital world like Tim Draper, stood up and bought some and that turned into a very brilliant investment for him. David, it's kind of the same story, right? Nation state is raising its head and taking some action in crypto along with embracing all of these technologies at the same time. So it's an interesting, I guess, mechanism to sort of watch. Yes, interesting juxtaposition.
00:20:27.726 - 00:20:29.142, Speaker C: You found the word for me. All right.
00:20:29.196 - 00:21:34.870, Speaker B: If you are looking for a mobile wallet to hold and access your crypto, you need to go to Argent XYZ and download their smart contract wallet app right onto your Android or iOS device. Argent is the most secure way to hold money on your device while still being able to access defi services that we all know and love. On Ethereum, through Arjun, you have one tap access to the beloved Defi apps like compound, Uniswap, Aave, and you can even invest directly into some yield generating assets right from your Argent wallet. Crucial to maintaining security over your assets is Argent's guardian service, which allows you to use a friend to make sure that you can always restore access to your funds in case you were to ever lose your phone or for your device to break. You can also use a local hardware wallet to ensure that you can always restore access to your funds yourself. One of Argent's newest features is their ability to route trades through ten decentralized exchanges, including Uniswap and Kyber, to make sure that you are always getting the best trade on your assets. Similarly, pushing the fold on what we can do in Ethereum and Defi.
00:21:34.950 - 00:21:37.014, Speaker A: Argent has replicated some of the legacy.
00:21:37.062 - 00:21:46.846, Speaker B: Financial services that you would expect from your bank, but put it directly into the hands of the user, such as send limits and whitelisted accounts, ensuring that if anyone were to be able to.
00:21:46.868 - 00:21:48.634, Speaker A: Access your funds in your Argent wallet.
00:21:48.682 - 00:22:29.974, Speaker B: They could only send up to a certain amount and only be able to send them to approved addresses, which is creating one of the most safe environments to hold your assets in. Which is why people have put millions and millions of dollars into the Argent wallet that they use on their device. In order to see the argent wallet in action, go to Argent link slash bankless and download the argent wallet on iOS or Android today. We're also brought to you by monolith. Monolith is your cool new DeFi account, your defi savings account, your defi checking account. Except the cool thing about the monolith DeFi account is that it gets software updates, right? You actually get to increase the usefulness of this over time. So here are some of the features.
00:22:29.974 - 00:22:32.522, Speaker B: Monolith is a smart contract wallet with.
00:22:32.576 - 00:22:33.750, Speaker A: A lot of the features that you.
00:22:33.760 - 00:22:45.006, Speaker B: Would expect if you've come to know DeFi and what it is, you can add money to it. You can put that money to work in compound and accessing yield, and you can also swap through uniswap.
00:22:45.038 - 00:22:46.706, Speaker A: What's cool with monolith is that they.
00:22:46.728 - 00:23:30.442, Speaker B: Will send you a very sexy monolith visa card that connects to your monolith smart contract wallet on Ethereum. So it's a really awesome tool to live a bankless life with a savings account that gets software updates. So this is something that you're never going to find out in the real world, but you can still do real world things with real money, like buy your groceries. So that's just fantastic. Coming soon to monolith. Actually already here to Monolith is now you can buy Dai and get it sent to your wallet directly, right? So it's also being an on ramp, so you don't have to go through your centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini or wherever. You can just go straight from your bank account right into your monolith checking account smart contract wallet.
00:23:30.442 - 00:23:33.450, Speaker B: So check them out at Monolith XYZ.
00:23:33.610 - 00:23:41.330, Speaker C: Let's go to take. Speaking of what's happening, what's on your mind right now? David, what are some of your hot takes for the week?
00:23:41.400 - 00:24:15.850, Speaker A: Yeah, my hot take for the week is that we constantly hear about how there's just this lack of trust in institutions, right? No one knows who to trust anymore. The central government isn't really doing the job that we want it to. The companies, Facebook, Silicon Valley, we don't trust them either. And as we all know, 2020 has been just a year of just reorgan your brain to a new reality. Right? People are just. Things are different now for many, many different reasons. And the underlying theme is a lack of trust, right? A lack of trust in institutions.
00:24:15.850 - 00:24:38.370, Speaker A: And so I want to pose to the listeners, what's more likely to get new trust back? Is it going to be that we are going to improve our old institutions or that we adopt new institutions? And what are new institutions other than bitcoin, Ethereum and defi applications? Specifically institutions that are trustless, that you can trust by default?
00:24:38.710 - 00:24:58.890, Speaker C: You know what, I don't know of any other. Like you asked that question. What are the new institutions? It's either the old governments that we have to change from the inside, or honestly, it's these digital corporate overlord nations, like the nation of Facebook, the nation of Mark Zuckerberg, the nation of Twitter. Right. I don't trust them. Bezos, do you trust them?
00:24:58.960 - 00:24:59.802, Speaker A: No, not at all.
00:24:59.856 - 00:25:00.822, Speaker C: They could be worse.
00:25:00.966 - 00:25:02.010, Speaker A: They're part of the problem.
00:25:02.080 - 00:25:02.314, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:02.352 - 00:25:23.918, Speaker A: And so where are we going to get new trust? Well, what about trustless systems? That's the whole point of this revolution. And the 2020 world has been so crazy. I don't think it's that far fetched anymore. To ask people to learn about bitcoin, to learn about Ethereum, to offer them a new platform because their world's already been turned upside down in 2020. That's not that much of an ask anymore.
00:25:24.094 - 00:25:33.202, Speaker C: No. This feels very much like a new puzzle piece fitting into the whole list of things we trust. Yeah, nice insight, dude. Fascinating.
00:25:33.266 - 00:25:35.160, Speaker A: Thank you. Ryan, what about you?
00:25:35.690 - 00:25:50.234, Speaker C: All right, so one thing. I've got three. All right, but I'll make them quick. Right. The first is this, David. So I feel like for a long time, people have been talking about, like, Ethereum will never work. Smart contracts will never work.
00:25:50.234 - 00:26:12.978, Speaker C: DFI is just a toy. It will never work. Well, guess what? Uniswap is now doing 4 billion in volume in trading volume on a weekly basis, which is more than Coinbase, by the way. Right. We can verify that on Ethereum. And it's no longer an option for you to say Ethereum is pointless and DFI won't work. Right? It's no longer an option.
00:26:12.978 - 00:26:30.922, Speaker C: Uniswap was a protocol built two years ago. In 24 months now, it's doing $4 billion. My hot take is shut up. If you're saying Ethereum smart contracts, DFI don't work, just look at uniswap and then shut up because onus is on you, not on.
00:26:30.976 - 00:26:31.354, Speaker A: Prove it.
00:26:31.392 - 00:26:38.410, Speaker C: Yeah. What are you talking about? It doesn't. Okay, like one developer did this, right? Like barriers to entry. It's crazy.
00:26:38.480 - 00:26:40.762, Speaker A: Anyway, can't argue a billion dollars.
00:26:40.896 - 00:26:47.418, Speaker C: My other hot take is this. I don't think a whole bunch of things are priced into Eth right now. The asset.
00:26:47.514 - 00:26:48.062, Speaker A: That's right.
00:26:48.116 - 00:27:02.578, Speaker C: I'm a bull on Eth. You guys know that. David, I know you're a bull on Eth. But look, EtH two is not priced in right now, in my opinion. I don't think EtH staking is priced in. I don't think EtH as a store of value money is priced in. I don't even think the potential of DFI is priced in.
00:27:02.578 - 00:27:08.820, Speaker C: And I know 15 five nine Eth feeburn is not priced in either.
00:27:09.210 - 00:27:10.118, Speaker A: No way.
00:27:10.284 - 00:27:18.840, Speaker C: I don't think any of this is priced in. So if you know this stuff feels like some alpha. All right, ready for spicy takes now.
00:27:19.530 - 00:27:20.374, Speaker A: Here we go.
00:27:20.492 - 00:27:37.870, Speaker C: Okay, here we go. I said, I tweeted this out. We don't need a bitcoin v two because it already exists. It's called ethereum. And before you say, ryan, I disagree with that. Let me say I also partially disagree with this. Right? So I don't fully 100% agree with it.
00:27:37.870 - 00:28:11.734, Speaker C: I don't think you can actually replace bitcoin. That's really not what I'm saying. But I do think that Ethereum is executing on a few things that now bitcoin doesn't need to execute. So if bitcoin ever thought it should add expressivity or smart contracts to bitcoin, it doesn't need to because ethereum is here. If bitcoin ever thought it should create a L2, it doesn't need to because ethereum is a better L2 than it can come up with. Right. If bitcoin ever wanted to transition to proof of stake, it doesn't need to because Ethereum already has, essentially.
00:28:11.734 - 00:28:23.898, Speaker C: And I do think Ethereum is kind of taking this bankless vision right to the max. And that was part of the vision of the Satoshi white paper. So. Yeah. Is that spicy or is that. Now I've muted it down and nerfed.
00:28:23.914 - 00:28:56.002, Speaker A: It and it's not spicy. Yeah, I think the second one, actually, all innovation that is trying to do something on bitcoin, it just works better on Ethereum. Right. And so it seems to be that bitcoin is being whittled and whittled and whittled down to just the main l one bitcoin chain, which is just fine because again, bitcoin isn't trying to do anything else other than support BTC, the asset. But you're totally right. Like, all the value of all the other innovations are going on to Ethereum. Ethereum is an evolution on bitcoin.
00:28:56.002 - 00:29:04.842, Speaker A: It doesn't replace bitcoin, but it's a 3d movement upon a 2d historical, whatever bitcoin is.
00:29:04.976 - 00:29:28.190, Speaker C: Totally agree. I feel like it's all part of the family of religions, the crypto religions, basically just another branch. All right, let's talk about lastly, I love ending with this, David. So we've given you guys news, some hot takes, some releases, but what are you most excited about at this point? First week, November 2020? What's exciting?
00:29:28.350 - 00:30:09.710, Speaker A: Yeah, so again, we're permit bulls, I guess, on the bankless podcast. We don't mean to be, but I guess we are. But what I'm excited about is that just the arrival of Ethereum 2.0 brings in so many just positive n order consequences, second order, third order consequences that just are really helpful. In 2017, people kept on talking about what is Ether? How do we define Ether? And people for some reason to this day still cite John Feffer's ether investment analysis, which is basically summarized as ether is gas. And the velocity of Ether is not going to make it valuable. But then people in the Ethereum community, like people like you and me and Eric Connor and Anthony Suzano, would raise their flag and be like, that's not correct.
00:30:09.710 - 00:30:20.706, Speaker A: For these reasons. And all of the reasons that we would give were actually hypothetical dependent on future success of Ethereum reasons. Right. And so now that it's to refute almost.
00:30:20.808 - 00:30:24.242, Speaker C: Yeah. Right. Because somebody could say, yeah, show us when it ships. Right?
00:30:24.296 - 00:30:51.978, Speaker A: Right. And you're like, damn it. Good point. But once it's here, if anyone at this point in time is citing, like the. The days are numbered, right? The days of the John Feffer investment thesis of ether are out and the days of the triple point asset are in. And again, the triple point asset was just a thesis and we are seeing it turn into reality, and that is just going to ultimately be reflected in the price of ether.
00:30:52.154 - 00:31:07.166, Speaker C: Yeah, it feels like that old ETH is oil, ETH is gas kind of analogy has totally broken down. It almost feels as old and dated as Defi will never work. DFI has no use cases when Uniswap is doing 4 billion in weekly volume.
00:31:07.278 - 00:31:15.718, Speaker A: Yeah, right. So far, the bankless takes for the past, like two years have been on point. We've been saying it from day one.
00:31:15.884 - 00:31:18.280, Speaker C: All right, I feel that way. We'll see.
00:31:18.650 - 00:31:20.294, Speaker A: What are you excited about?
00:31:20.492 - 00:31:26.498, Speaker C: All right, you know what? You stole mine. David, I'm just kidding.
00:31:26.674 - 00:31:28.010, Speaker A: To go into more detail.
00:31:28.160 - 00:32:07.582, Speaker C: Look, I think maybe my focus is this, like ETH two launched, right? And what this ETH asset is becoming is a productive asset. Ran a piece by Stefan Kulikin, who actually runs a publicly traded company in Canada. You know what? They just buy ETH. That's their investment thesis. They buy ETH and sometimes they invest in other companies. So it's a publicly traded company with a balance sheet full of ETh. And he wrote this great post called the birth of the digital bond, about how Ether, the asset in staking, becomes a digital bond, a yield bearing instrument.
00:32:07.582 - 00:32:45.298, Speaker C: This is somebody with a traditional financial background who is talking about this. We just put out a post today. So this will be yesterday by the time you listen to this called ETH, the Internet bond. And this basically goes through how you can think about Ether, the way you would think about a traditional sovereign bond. For instance, when it's staked, it has basically the same elements of a bond. It has a face value, it has a present value, it has a market value. And those can be kind of discounted based on time, based on the horizon, based on sort of the market value, and there's a discount rate.
00:32:45.298 - 00:33:36.634, Speaker C: So what's cool about this, I think, is staking will lead to traditional investors, institutional investors being able to understand ether, the asset. I think they don't quite understand it right now. I think over the past three years or so, we've seen institutional investors start to understand bitcoin. It's like, oh, okay, digital gold. Okay, now they have digital scarcity embedded in their head. The next journey for institutional investors and for mainstream investors is to understand ETH as an Internet bond, a digital bond as a yield bearing instrument, and a whole non sovereign, open, decentralized economy. So I think we're at the very start of that narrative kind of picking up and institutional investors starting to understand that, David.
00:33:36.634 - 00:33:53.142, Speaker C: So that's what I'm excited about. And by the way, we're going to have Andrew Keys, I think, on next week to talk a little bit about that. And the folks that helped write this white paper on ETH as an Internet bond to talk about that on state of the nation. So more on that soon.
00:33:53.276 - 00:34:14.762, Speaker A: Yeah, there's no shortage of ETH staking and ether related content in bankless nation. And that's because that's exactly what ether deserves. Like, ether is the most insane asset of all time. And just to keep on hammering on this point, we have never seen a bond market with a hard money before. That is something that will be brand new to this universe.
00:34:14.906 - 00:34:19.310, Speaker C: Yeah. Speaking of which, David, you get your validator prepped by hardware?
00:34:19.890 - 00:34:37.430, Speaker A: Absolutely. Apparently, according to Preston, who again, you guys got to listen to the episode with Preston. I'm going to make a link happen right around here in the corner of YouTube. You can apparently stake 10,000 validators on, like, a MacBook pro. I won't be needing that many validators.
00:34:40.330 - 00:34:42.418, Speaker C: How much of a whale are you, David?
00:34:42.594 - 00:34:47.606, Speaker A: 320,000 eth on my MacBook. Yeah, that's what I'm doing. Getting ready for that.
00:34:47.628 - 00:35:03.294, Speaker C: You can almost boot up the network by yourself. Well, that's awesome, man. All right, dude. Well, I think that is all our time. We kept our promise. We gave you guys the week in crypto. Everything you need to know from a news release, market perspective, and also some hot takes to end it with.
00:35:03.294 - 00:35:18.480, Speaker C: Hope you enjoyed the first week of November. This has been our roll up. As always, none of this is financial advice. The assets we talk about are risky. You could lose what you put in. But thanks for joining us on the bankless journey. We're signing off.
00:35:18.480 - 00:35:19.130, Speaker C: Bye.
