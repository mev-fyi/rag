00:00:00.410 - 00:00:32.134, Speaker A: Hey guys, the next sponsor is ledger and Ledger is running a 40% off Black Friday week sale. So if you haven't gotten your ledger yet, you are in luck. For the week of the 23rd through the 30th, you can get 40% off of all ledgers on the Ledger website. So if you are still using a hot wallet or you're just looking to get a backup, maybe for a multisig or just for some more redundancy, now is the time to go get that ledger. There's a link in the show notes that can get you that 40% off Black Friday deal.
00:00:32.252 - 00:01:20.454, Speaker B: If you want to live a bankless life, you need to get a hardware wallet. There is no alternative for storing your crypto in a self sovereign fashion. That's why I have four ledgers that I use to manage my different crypto assets using the Ledger live account as well. Ledger Live is like your home base for managing your Ethereum, defi and crypto accounts. It does a really good job of aggregating all of your different Ethereum wallets if you are the type of person that uses more than one. But you can also add other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or cosmos or whatever your preferred blockchain is, and then it will display an aggregate portfolio of all your accounts at the main page. One thing that ledger is doing a really good job of is enabling all the money verbs that me and Ryan talk about with the bankless Guildcube enabled in the Ledger Live app.
00:01:20.454 - 00:02:10.806, Speaker B: So right now in the ledger Live app, you can buy, sell, lend, swap, and stake your crypto assets, which is doing a really good job of fulfilling all of the money verbs in the bankless skillcube. Something that's new to Ledger Live is ledger swap, where you can swap assets one for another, directly inside the ledger live application, ensuring trustlessness in your financial activity on Ethereum and on bitcoin. If you want to learn more about what you can do with a ledger, go to the blog post the power of Ledger Live on the Ledger website where they share some of the more advanced things that you can do with your ledger that you might not have known about. There's a link in the show notes that will take you to the ledger shop where you can get your preferred ledger hardware wallet. I personally like the Ledger Nano X, but I also have both. They're both great options. When you own a ledger, you own your own assets in the way that.
00:02:10.828 - 00:02:15.474, Speaker C: They have been designed to be held by the user and the user alone.
00:02:15.522 - 00:02:17.238, Speaker B: So go get your ledger today to.
00:02:17.244 - 00:03:18.490, Speaker C: Make sure that you are as self sovereign as possible. The bankless state and the nations are brought to you by Wyrn. Wyrn is DeFi's first self building, community run project which I just get really excited about. Wiren is a system that seeks out yield in DeFi and it does that in a number of different ways. A very aggressive way is with the vaults where you can deposit your preferred asset of choice and different DeFi experts will come in and generate a strategy for what to do with your deposited token, right? And so it'll go find ways to get yield in that deposited token in Defi. For those who want to just earn yield on their stablecoins, the earn system is for you where you can deposit your preferred stablecoin and Wyrn will go and figure out which money market on DeFi in DeFi is producing the best interest rate, whether it's Dydx, it's compound or Aave. It looks around DeFi to see where the yield is coming from and it directs stablecoins automatically so you don't have to check them out at yearn finance to get started.
00:03:18.490 - 00:03:21.726, Speaker C: And also check out the stats page to see what other people are doing as well.
00:03:21.828 - 00:04:17.466, Speaker B: What up bankless nation? Today, Andre Cronier of Wiren released this blog post called Daraswap Capital Efficient swaps, futures, options and loans. And so, understanding that Andre is just this rock star developer that has some firsthand experiences with building on Ethereum and making things really capital efficient on Ethereum, as well as the precedent of Wyron, I really wanted to understand this more into greater detail. And so I hit up Andre. I talked to him in his DMS and said, hey, let's make a video on the Bankless podcast so we can broadcast what this thing is to the world around it. So before I bring Andre on, I just want to go over this blog post really fast to get our foundations built. So Dariswap, Andre presents this Dariswap as this attempt to improve capital efficiency on Ethereum. And if you've been paying attention to what Andre's been doing and the activities that he's been up to, that's really the core problem that he's trying to solve.
00:04:17.466 - 00:04:44.674, Speaker B: He really likes solving capital efficiencies. We have this legacy financial world. We have legacy financial tools. We have Ethereum, which is this new financial platform. And there's actually more things that we can do on this new financial platform than just port over the old world onto the new world. There's new things like Uniswap Amm models that are new primitives that allow for new and better things. So if we just bring on the old world onto the new world, we actually haven't done very much innovation.
00:04:44.674 - 00:06:08.226, Speaker B: And I think this is what Andre is really getting at with this whole deriswap thing, which is really putting a bunch of financial instruments all into one stack, right? And so we have swaps, options and loans, and then also we have futures as well, all built into this one single protocol that Andre has specked out. And so in the conversation you're about to get into with Andre, we go through these details, but basically it's kind of like Wyrn. It starts at this very basic primitive, and then it builds out the rest of its products from there. And the core thing to understand is that Andre combines receiving fees from providing liquidity to Amm markets like Uniswap or balancer, and also the ability to provide capital onto futures markets, like derabit. Right? And so what Andre is trying to do is he's building out a system that can access both fees from Amms, like Uniswap, like providing liquidity to Uniswap, and also collecting fees on providing liquidity to options markets, like therapy, right? I'm not an expert in options markets, so the terminology I'm going to use is probably incorrect. But when you provide liquidity in the same way that you provide liquidity to Uniswap, if you make offers available on futures markets, you also can collect premiums, right? You can collect fees. And so Andre's built out a protocol that lets you do both at once.
00:06:08.226 - 00:06:26.226, Speaker B: He uses this with the standard Uniswap Amm model, plus oracles. And the Oracles gives you the pricing knowledge of information, which allows you to produce options, right? That's how you get an option. And so this is an on chain option. All of the logic is held directly on Ethereum.
00:06:26.338 - 00:06:26.614, Speaker C: Right?
00:06:26.652 - 00:07:08.402, Speaker B: So we're not using some off chain order book or some off chain, like matching engine. It's not centralized. All the logic happens on Ethereum. And then all you have to do to build off of options is put a time parameter in options, and then you have futures, and then you can also get loans and secondary swaps out of this single product. And so I get into the conversation with Andre, trying to figure out, is this a little experiment, or is this like the next big thing? Right? And so my big takeaways was that Andre's on this mission to make capital more efficient, and he's done this with what he's calling Dariswap, and he's also building more things for his baby wyrn to use.
00:07:08.456 - 00:07:08.722, Speaker C: Right?
00:07:08.776 - 00:07:47.058, Speaker B: So successful Dariswap means successful wire, right? If Dariswap can be leveraged in the ways that Andre describes it, then Wyrn just has a new place to find and seek yield, right? And so what I find Andre to be up to these days is really, he's building out different things around Wyron that makes Wyron more valuable. And that's what I see Darrowswap as. That's what I see it to be. So let's just get into the interview and conversation with Andre Cronient. Before we get into the conversation with Andre, we're going to have to take a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible.
00:07:47.144 - 00:08:44.094, Speaker C: If you are looking for the front page of Defi, look no further than Xerion IO. Xerion is your home base for managing your defi portfolios. Xerion offers a central place for you to engage with all of the Defi protocols and assets that you engage with on a daily basis, but all in one central spot. Here you can see I've loaded up a wallet and Xerion is giving me the portfolio performance of all the assets in this wallet over time, as well as a breakdown of all the assets that I own, as well as all of my transaction history that I've ever done. In an easy to view fashion, Xerion also lets you invest right into DeFi's best yielding financial opportunities right from their homepage. Xerion also makes it super easy to access interest in DeFi using applications like compound and Ave in the background. And you can also exchange your assets using the Xerion app, using an exchange aggregator in the background to make sure that you always get the best rates.
00:08:44.094 - 00:09:09.530, Speaker C: You can even use the Xerion mobile wallet to add your metamask or argent or another Ethereum address right into your mobile wallet so you can see your portfolio and engage in Defi on the go. Here, I just loaded up my argent wallet and now I'm going to load up my metamask as well. And Xerion will do the same thing. It will add all of my assets and wallets together, all in one space and give me a portfolio summary of what's going on. Adding wallets is trivially easy.
00:09:09.600 - 00:09:10.906, Speaker B: If you already have a metamask, you.
00:09:10.928 - 00:09:15.390, Speaker C: Can get it right into the Xerion app, and it can sync with your desktop app as well.
00:09:15.460 - 00:09:16.526, Speaker B: And the best part is you can.
00:09:16.548 - 00:09:48.930, Speaker C: Also buy ether right into the app itself. Use the invest tab to look at all the things that you have invested in, as well as other opportunities. And coming soon to the Xerion app is the ability to buy and sell your assets straight from your mobile device as well. So download the app. It works on iOS and Android. Go to Xerion IO, plug in your wallets and get a historical report of your portfolio over time, as well as a comprehensive breakdown of all the assets that you own and how much yield they're generating for you. We're also brought to you by monolith.
00:09:48.930 - 00:10:35.522, Speaker C: Monolith is your cool new Defi account, your defi savings account, your defi checking account. Except the cool thing about the Monolith Defi account is that it gets software updates, right? You actually get to increase the usefulness of this over time. So here are some of the features. Monolith is a smart contract wallet with a lot of the features that you would expect if you've come to know Defi and what it is, you can add money to it. You can put that money to work in compound and accessing yield, and you can also swap through Uniswap. What's cool with monolith is that they will send you a very sexy monolith visa card that connects to your monolith smart contract wallet on Ethereum. So it's a really awesome tool to live a bankless life with a savings account that gets software updates.
00:10:35.522 - 00:11:04.282, Speaker C: So this is something that you're never going to find out in the real world. But you can still do real world things with real money, like buy your groceries. So that's just fantastic. Coming soon to Monolith. Actually already here to monolith is now you can buy Dai and get it sent to your wallet directly. Right? So it's also being an on ramp, so you don't have to go through your centralized exchange like Coinbase or Gemini or wherever. You can just go straight from your bank account right into your monolith checking account smart contract wallet.
00:11:04.282 - 00:11:07.330, Speaker C: So check them out at Monolith xyz.
00:11:08.310 - 00:11:34.890, Speaker A: Okay everyone, I am here with Andre Cronier. Andre has just released a blog piece on his website on his medium, Deraswap capital efficient swaps, futures, options and loans. So this looks like a new money Lego out of Andre. So Andre, congrats on making another new money Lego. Maybe we can start with the inspiration for why you wanted to build this particular piece of infrastructure.
00:11:35.630 - 00:12:06.126, Speaker D: Sure. As always, thanks for having me. And I'll just jump into this stuff. So it started with everything is about how do we make more yield in year? That's the goal. Looking at something like Dai, and this idea started three, four weeks back. So back then, something like Dai ETH in uniswap was the highest yield, upwards of 30% APY. So we wanted to do die EF, but now a depositor just gives us die.
00:12:06.126 - 00:13:00.326, Speaker D: Now we can't take that depositor's die, sell half of it to e, put it in the strategy, and hope Eth is going to stay on point. In hindsight, they would have gotten back a lot more money if we sent half of their dai into EF because it's been on an absolute tear. But we couldn't bet on that. So I started looking at ways of how can I provide Dai ETH for the LP, but the LP not have risk. And this sent me down the options rabbit hole. Worked a little bit with open, worked a little bit with hedgek, worked a little bit with primitive, a little bit with Euler, and learned a lot because it was a market I knew nothing about. But options started looking like a very valid fit, not necessarily the way something like open or derebit does it, which is they predefine the series they're going to write.
00:13:00.326 - 00:13:56.022, Speaker D: So there's a fixed every Friday settlement date, and then you have your strike prices and you trade on them. So something closer to hedgek, which is a pool to peer system, which lets the lps sort of like a uniswap amm. The lps can provide liquidity, and then the contract writes the options based on the needs of the user. And that looked really good. One problem with that was you constantly have to settle the options because you don't get perpetual options, basically is what I wanted to get to, which you can just put something in kind of like a perpetual funding rate on a long or a short, where as long as I keep that margin account up, it'll take the funds. And when I need to settle it, I can't settle it because I never know when a user wants to withdraw or settle their amount. So it's not something I want to continuously do.
00:13:56.022 - 00:15:22.322, Speaker D: And the other problem there is with something like urine depositors, these people are normally fairly long term depositors. It's not four weeks at a time, so you need something that's going to span over three months or whatever. But now, the one thing that I noticed when working with Molly, with the hedgek stuff, was the hedgek formulas are designed to be very well positioned when it's at the money. So strike price and current price are the same, but it starts deviating quite on the expensive side when you start moving to out of the money positions where the strike is further away from the current price. That led me to differences between american and european options and starting to code on chain calculations for stuff like black shoals or binomial pricing. And that led me down to a complete different rabbit hole because the math on chain is just not that well developed yet. So I had to end up writing things like base log math from scratch, stuff like linear walks, norm distribution, cdfs, and a bunch of other low level things.
00:15:22.322 - 00:16:06.734, Speaker D: And that was actually the most painful part, because you only have unsigned integers to work with. You don't have fixed points, you don't have decimals, so you have to do such a bunch of filthy hacks to actually get the math to work. But anyway, that's a sideline. Ended up finally managing to write these libraries. So now we had stuff like realized variance and realized volatility. And the reason I needed these was because you need implied volatility. Now, technically implied volatility you can only get when you have an options market trading on chain, because you actually take things like the maturity date and the price, and then you put that into sort of a reverse black scholes calculation, and that gives you the implied volatility.
00:16:06.734 - 00:16:56.526, Speaker D: But I came across this research called realizing smiles, that allows you to use realized volatility to predict that smile surface of implied volatility. So that's why I needed the realized variance to get the realized volatility. And the realized volatility gives you the implied volatility, which you can then use as input for the pricing. Now, this is all happening on chain. To facilitate this, I needed a bunch of pricing points, so that's why I ended up creating uniquote and keeper oracle, which is the uniswap price feeds for anything in uniswap. So they just use the time weighted oracle, the twap from Uniswap, and every 30 minutes they take a reading and they take it at specific times so that the volatility snapshots can work between those times. So that that's always sort of realized.
00:16:56.526 - 00:17:47.698, Speaker D: So that was the keeper oracle. And the keeper system actually emerged out of that as well, because it needed something to manage these jobs frequently and create an incentive layer to pay them. And all of this stuff. As you can already hear, there's been a lot to try and get to this point. And now I finally managed to be able to quote options but now the one thing I started struggling with, with the current pool to pure designs is they are cash settled, so they're USD denominated. So even if you do an Eve option or you do a BTC option, you're going to have the dollar value profit settlement. And this is currently how most of them works.
00:17:47.698 - 00:18:20.330, Speaker D: Open allows you to settle the underlying asset, but hedge only does the profit settlement. Now, I didn't want that. I wanted the asset settlement specifically because as an LP, if I give you profit settlement, then that's a permanent loss. There's no way I'm going to make that back. I gave you money. If I have the underlying asset set settled, then that actually turns into impermanent loss where the loss is only realized when I take the asset out. And that from an LP perspective is already better.
00:18:20.330 - 00:19:11.574, Speaker D: So I started looking and here at one point I was at an NPAss because on the one side and I actually ended up with two viable option solutions. The one used cash settlement as the LP. Now this was cool because I could use Urinevault lps as liquidity for these options. So I could take Ydai and use it as the backing for writing Dai denominated options for anything in uniswap and then settle that with you. But the other option, which my capitalist brain said is good, it's good for urine, it's good for LP, all of this stuff. But my coder and decentralized purist brain told me, look, that's a shit solution. The correct solution is to follow in uniswap steps and have option pairs.
00:19:11.574 - 00:19:58.806, Speaker D: So like you have with Uniswap, you have a BTC ETh pair, and that's trading BTC to ETH and ETH to BTC. And you could do the same with options. So now you have a BTC ETH option pair, BTC rights to ETH, Eve rights to BTC, and that's what they're settled in as well. And that's good for the lps because now when those options do get settled, they're not taking that permanent loss, so it looks better for them as well. Now, the next thing is, as I was starting to learn all of this stuff, I realized that options is a volatility game. When something is highly volatile, that's when options get settled. Because an option is basically just a hedge, is a directional bet at how the volatility is going to swing.
00:19:58.806 - 00:20:53.470, Speaker D: So started doing some simulations, started doing a lot of napkin math, and it showed that being a uniswap LP liquidity provider, right is actually a volatility hedge, because the more volatile, the more trading fees. So if I combine that uniswap trading principle with the options underwriting principle, then when the market goes sideways, I'm not getting a lot of trading fees, but I'm getting option fees. And if the market goes volatile, I'm getting a lot of trading fees, but I am taking some of the option losses, but it actually offsets the amount of options I'm losing. So just by combining those two, I have a much better solution from the LP perspective, because they're hedging their volatility with trading and they're hedging sideways movement with options. So just more fees all around. And it actually does cover losses even in highly volatile moments with option trading.
00:20:54.610 - 00:21:09.490, Speaker A: So just to reiterate that, just to make sure I get it, so this architecture can maximize for fees for both options and providing liquidity in the same product.
00:21:09.560 - 00:21:09.794, Speaker C: Right.
00:21:09.832 - 00:21:15.490, Speaker A: It's trying to integrate both of those two ways of generating revenue into the same instrument.
00:21:16.090 - 00:21:16.646, Speaker D: Correct.
00:21:16.748 - 00:21:17.400, Speaker B: Okay.
00:21:18.250 - 00:22:09.954, Speaker D: That's where the capital efficiency comes in. Now, the next part was futures, which even though the pricing model is a little bit different, it still sort of comes down to actually, let me take a step back. Now, because you have options as part of the swap, it means you have time as part of the swap. Now, time is the next sort of dimension you add to the normal Uniswap directional trade. So, being time aware means I can do something like a future where we agree right now that you are going to give me BTC, and I'm going to give you ETH at a future date, at the current spot price, but you're going to pay me a premium based off of that. And that's based on your dividend and the risk free interest rate and the normal futures calculation in there. But it's still a normal trade.
00:22:09.954 - 00:22:53.618, Speaker D: It's no different than me trading BTC to ETH. I'm just giving you the BTC now, and I'm getting the ETH later. Now, because you have that model, thanks to futures, you can apply the same to loans where I'm giving you the BTC, but I'm giving it to you as collateral, which then different calculation tells how much if I can borrow at this point in time, and if I give you that ETH back, I get my BTC back. If I don't give you the ETH back, then the BTC is settled. So it just adds that t value, and then it uses that same fee calculations, which integrates time. And now that I've got all of this gaussian math and stuff on chain capable of reading within their own oracles. Now I can actually facilitate all of this stuff.
00:22:53.618 - 00:23:29.120, Speaker D: So now you have what essentially the core code is the uniswap pair. That's still what it comes down to. But now, from the same pair, you can offer loans from the one pair to the other pair backed by the other one. You can offer futures and you can offer options. So the reason why this is more capital efficient is if I have BTC and ETH right now, I'll put 25% in Ave, I'll put for borrowing, I'll put 25% in hedgek for options, and I'll put the other 50% in uniswap for trading. And what fees I get is the fees I get. But this way it's all in one.
00:23:29.120 - 00:24:25.870, Speaker D: The loan fees you're getting, the option fees you're getting, the future fees you're getting, the trade fees you're getting. And the risk surface is still only that one additional variable, which was t. Now, obviously it comes with caveats trading. If any of the fee systems is underneath what they're supposed to be, then the LPS start taking the risk. But this is also why I went with the settlement approach and not the profit approach, because they're always on that impermanent line, which in this case is actually better. But that's really it. If you ignore all the shitty math and stuff I had to reinvent, and you take all of the oracle and realize volatility and realize variance and all of that stuff out of the code, you're talking about 150 lines of code that's actually added to current uniswap.
00:24:25.870 - 00:24:40.278, Speaker D: It's still clean as far as I'm concerned. And it's correct in terms of decentralization, the way it's designed and. Yeah, that's it. It's as basic as that.
00:24:40.444 - 00:25:01.378, Speaker A: As basic as that. So, Andre, it doesn't seem like this product is really built for anyone. In specific, it seems like this product is not something that a legacy individual could really think up because of how it uses certain things on Ethereum, like Uniswap, like amm pools, to really leverage itself and work as intended.
00:25:01.414 - 00:25:01.710, Speaker D: Right.
00:25:01.780 - 00:25:19.266, Speaker A: There's not one specific party like this product is meant for option traders or this party is meant for liquidity providers. This really seems like something brand new that is more of a hybrid approach for a lot of different activities that we see in the DFI and crypto space. Would you agree with that?
00:25:19.288 - 00:26:01.120, Speaker D: Take 100% I actually wrote about this quite a lot. End of last year on another blog I was busy with, where I kept complaining about how capital inefficient Ethereum currently is. Because even if you just take EtH, there's so much eth segregated in so many different places that if we could sort of. At that time, I was doing a lot of layer one work building layer one chains. So I had come up with this concept of a chain that has this liquidity pool at the bottom. And then all of the protocols sort of borrow from this liquidity pool and they pay interest rates. And all this time I've still been trying to design that.
00:26:01.120 - 00:26:54.894, Speaker D: So this is finally a step towards that. Now, one important caveat to add is obviously the more features you add, the more attack surfaces you add. So as always, this is not something when it launches, even after audit that you want to rush into, you want to let it chill, go through a few attacks and motions. So as always, very important distinctions that need to be made, because just adding in options into the pool is already enough of an attack vector that could potentially drain it if something goes wrong with how the oracle is manipulated. So adding in two other things as well, that's complete insanity. But anyway, risk statement aside, yes, you would be correct. Not necessarily a new primitive, because I don't think this doesn't unlock anything you can't do.
00:26:54.894 - 00:27:40.270, Speaker D: Now, right now, you can go get options at hedge, you can put your liquidity in uniswap, you can go lend it out at compound, or just if you don't know which one to pick, pick this. Because in aggregate, it's going to give you better yields if it's used. Obviously, if it doesn't get used, then it doesn't matter. But yeah, its core problem it's trying to solve is that capital inefficiency so that we can move away from that segregated liquidity and start having consolidated liquidity. Because as we've seen in things like uniswap as well, the better the liquidity, the lower the slippage, the greater the fees. Everything just starts working better when we consolidate this liquidity.
00:27:40.770 - 00:28:07.240, Speaker A: So say, for example, that there's somebody who is trading options on some platform like derabit, and they're also providing on a totally separate activity, they're also providing liquidity in uniswap. Why would this particular individual be compelled to participate in this product instead? What would really be the incentive for them to come over?
00:28:08.010 - 00:28:44.274, Speaker D: Well, let's say they're underwriting options at derebit and they're providing the liquidity, as you mentioned. And let's say they have 100 e. So right now, they're sitting with 50 e in uniswap, earning 0.3% fees, and they're with 50% in derbit, earning variable fees based on their trade activity. But let's simplify it and say it's also 0.3%. In this case, they are earning 0.3% in aggregate over 100 e, right? With the consolidated example, they're earning the 0.3%
00:28:44.274 - 00:29:15.674, Speaker D: on their 100 with the trading, and they're earning 0.3% on the 100 with the options. So their nut result is 0.6% over the full sum. And that's where capital efficiency starts becoming important, because you want to put the same sum of money to work at different things. And that's why these specific tools are important to play together. Because when there's low volatility, that's when you start looking at things like options and loans.
00:29:15.674 - 00:30:05.870, Speaker D: When there's high volatility, that's when you start looking at trading activity and futures. The four chosen tools complement each other in terms of their periods of when they get used. So if we go back to the same example, let's say it's currently a quiet market and there's not a lot of trading in uniswap. So now this guy isn't earning anything on that 50% e he has in uniswap, but he is earning slightly better on his 50% on his 50 e that he has in derabit. So let's say he's earning 0.4 now, but he's still actually, in aggregate, down over what he could have been earning if he had his whole sum in either one of those two. But making that choice is a very difficult one, because like I said, it depends on when the market becomes volatile or when it isn't volatile.
00:30:05.870 - 00:30:45.420, Speaker D: And now, I'm sure there are traders on crypto Twitter that will tell you that they've always been able to predict this, but I claim bullshit and say, flip a coin, see which way it lands. And that's what the market is going to do. It doesn't replace any of these things, it just tries to make them more functional, cheaper. And I always like talking about lazy liquidity. Everything I build, I try and accommodate. For the lazy LP. This is the guy that just wants to drop his stuff and come back in six months, because he doesn't care about the day to day.
00:30:45.420 - 00:31:28.886, Speaker D: These are the users I cater for. And one of the worst things, as a liquidity provider is trying. And this is the same reason I started urine originally, because one of the most annoying things is trying to jump between these platforms the whole time to chase yield. So we've managed to sort of flatten that yield curve with urine, but there's still too many disproportionate opportunities between do I go eth dai sushi? Or do I just go eth and leverage my dai and maker? Or there's so many bloody options. So, again, trying to simplify it for those guys so that they do get a little bit of everything.
00:31:29.068 - 00:31:29.462, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:31:29.516 - 00:31:44.350, Speaker A: This very much feels very on theme with the projects that you've been working on in the past. And now that you brought up yearn, I'd actually like to ask, how does yearn fit into this new product? And how does this new product fit into, like, how do those things become complementary?
00:31:46.370 - 00:32:08.534, Speaker D: That, unfortunately, I'm going to have to leave as a teaser, because it's this plus yearn and another entity not yet to be named. There's some pretty cool back office stuff happening there that I think people are going to be excited about. I'm going to have to tease a little bit, but more details on that later.
00:32:08.652 - 00:32:16.040, Speaker A: Well, maybe I can get you to come back on the show when that third piece of the puzzle comes out and we can talk about all of these things all at once.
00:32:16.410 - 00:32:18.006, Speaker D: Yeah, sounds good. I'm good.
00:32:18.108 - 00:32:18.422, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:32:18.476 - 00:32:23.638, Speaker A: Thanks, Andre. I really appreciate your time to help us learn what this new thing is. Appreciate it.
00:32:23.804 - 00:32:26.130, Speaker D: Sure, man. Anytime. Ping me when you need. Cheers.
