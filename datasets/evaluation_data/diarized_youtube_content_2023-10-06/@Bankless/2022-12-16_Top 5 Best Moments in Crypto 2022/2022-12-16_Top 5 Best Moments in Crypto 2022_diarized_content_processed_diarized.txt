00:00:00.170 - 00:00:02.554, Speaker B: Top five best moments. What are we looking at, David?
00:00:02.602 - 00:00:34.946, Speaker A: $54 million of crypto donated to the entire country of Ukraine. While all the banks and all the traditional payment rails were too slow to do anything effective. USDT bitcoin, ether stablecoins, a crypto punk was all donated. The ethereum L2 ecosystem finally passes the layer one in transaction activity that happened just earlier this year. Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, TikTok all adopted. NFTs. NFTs really are the Trojan horse for all of crypto to get into these social media giants.
00:00:34.946 - 00:00:55.274, Speaker A: The merge. The merge finalized probably the greatest, most significant upgrade to any public blockchain ever. Went off without a hitch. I never thought it would actually happen. May 16 of this year, absolute history was made where Ryan, Sean, Adam was confirmed a real human being. And I met this man in West Palm Beach, Florida.
00:00:55.322 - 00:00:57.118, Speaker B: By the way, I'll note that David put this ahead of the.
00:00:57.124 - 00:00:57.946, Speaker A: Merge.
00:00:58.138 - 00:00:59.210, Speaker B: Sorry, vitalik.
