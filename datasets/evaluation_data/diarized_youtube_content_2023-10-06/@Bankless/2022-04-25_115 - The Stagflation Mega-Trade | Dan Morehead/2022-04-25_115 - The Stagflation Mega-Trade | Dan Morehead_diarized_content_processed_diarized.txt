00:00:06.250 - 00:00:28.210, Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, and how to front run the opportunity. This is Ryan. Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman, and we're here to help you become more bankless. Guys, we have a fantastic episode with Dan Moorhead. We're talking about the year ahead for crypto, how to survive this bond bubble.
00:00:28.210 - 00:00:53.242, Speaker A: We've got inflation at all time highs. What do we make of this? Dan is the perfect combo of macro plus crypto investor to help us navigate these uncharted waters. A few takeaways to look out for. Number one, we actually talk about why inflation is 8.5% right now. Number two, we talk about this thing he calls the bond bubble and the coming great unwinding of that bond bubble. Figure out what that means as we do the episode.
00:00:53.242 - 00:01:12.754, Speaker A: Also, are rising interest rates bad for crypto? Maybe not. Maybe not this time. That's what Dan makes the case for, how to structure your crypto portfolio in the midst of all this. And finally, little bonus tidbit. Somewhere mid show, you'll have to look for it. How to short bonds. If you believe what Dan is saying, bonds are going to go down.
00:01:12.754 - 00:01:43.738, Speaker A: He talks about how to short them. David, this was a really fun podcast. I learned a lot, brought a lot of pieces together. I think, with what's going on in the current macro environment, which is hugely relevant to the crypto industry and the crypto story over the last decade, it's been in existence and will continue to be massively relevant into the future. I mean, Dan was actually talking about when the nation states of the world, central banks, would start purchasing crypto. He thinks that's coming in the future. What were some of your thoughts?
00:01:43.914 - 00:02:43.742, Speaker B: I think this moment in history is the moment that Dan himself, Dan specifically, was really meant for. Dan has been paying attention to just the macro markets, I think, since he became an investor in general, back in the, back in the. He started Pantera as a macro fund, but pivoted into a crypto fund in 2013 because he saw the writing on the walls that so many who were early in this industry saw, and realized that crypto is macro. But he dropped this one line that I think explains it well. Crypto is like buying gold, but back in the BC era, right, back when people were trading just like apples for gold, right? Like, imagine buying gold before it even had a dollar price. And that's what Dan saw in 2013. So a macro person who saw the writing on the wall and saw that crypto was eventually going to become a macro relevant crypto asset class, so pivoted entire fund to become a crypto fund.
00:02:43.742 - 00:03:29.002, Speaker B: And this moment right now, where inflation is at 8.5%, the timing of this podcast couldn't be better because Dan has been paying attention to the bond markets. What the Federal Reserve is up to, and what is now what he is calling the great unwinding of $9 trillion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet is going into the bond market, which usually would spell the death for a lot of risk on assets. But Dan's making the case that not this time, people are waking up to that. Perhaps it's time to vote with your dollars and exit the system and the crypto. While this is very similar to stagflation in the 70s, which is another topic that we got into, the main difference this time is we didn't have crypto in the 70s, Ryan. Like, we have the escape route, we have the escape hatch, and that is crypto.
00:03:29.002 - 00:03:38.234, Speaker B: So how is this similar to the 70s? Is a big theme of this episode, but how is it different? Because crypto is here, is also a big theme of this episode. And I just learned an absolute ton with Dan here.
00:03:38.292 - 00:04:06.614, Speaker A: Yeah, you guys are going to absolutely love it. Of course, after the show, Dave and I are getting ready to record our debrief where we talk about our thoughts on the show that we just recorded our thoughts with this Dan Moorhead episode.

00:06:39.456 - 00:07:05.614, Speaker A: Bankless nation, we are super excited to introduce you to our next guest. Dan Moorhead has spent 25 years managing global macro funds. He had a career at Goldman, then he founded Pantera. Later he pivoted into crypto. Still early in 2013. He went all in on crypto at that time and at beglist. We just think macro plus crypto is such a deadly combination, particularly for navigating this next decade.
00:07:05.614 - 00:07:19.270, Speaker A: And we think you need the skills to navigate this next decade because it's going to be different than all of the decades preceding it. That's why we're having Dan on to help equip us with some of the insight and skills. Dan, welcome to bankless. It's great to have you.
00:07:19.340 - 00:07:20.662, Speaker C: Hey, thanks for having me.
00:07:20.796 - 00:07:35.598, Speaker A: Hey, man. We're going to cover like, two things today, if that's cool. The first is sort of like what's happening, the big macro landscape, inflation bonds, the Fed, that sort of thing. And the second is once we understand what's happening, how to position for that. Does that sound good?
00:07:35.684 - 00:07:36.686, Speaker C: Sounds great.
00:07:36.868 - 00:07:57.382, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about what's happening then. Inflation bonds, the Fed. All right, so the big thing right now in the news this week is inflation. It's been in the news for the last months, but I think this is the highest inflation. Something like 40 years, 50 years, something like this, 8.5% CPI. What's happening here? Can you tell us what's going on?
00:07:57.516 - 00:08:28.926, Speaker C: Yeah, so it's actually 35 years I've been doing this, so I've seen a lot of cycles. This is the craziest one ever. The Federal Reserve pumped up a bubble in bonds that is just really off the charts. Got the bond market so far ahead of where it could or should be. And the bond market is obviously what fuels the mortgage industry. And a record number of Americans took out a mortgage last year and bought property. Not surprisingly, houses are up 19%.
00:08:28.926 - 00:08:58.546, Speaker C: So if you are a homeowner, that's a good thing, but 35% of Americans are not. So I think it's a terrible thing. So the Fed's pumped up this massive bubble and it's created a massively overheated economy. And the chairman of the Fed about a year ago said it was a transitory blip in inflation. This is not transitory. This is a massive, massive problem. Each month since Powell said it was transitory, it's printed a new record high.
00:08:58.546 - 00:09:43.030, Speaker C: And as you said, we're back to inflation rates as measured as high as 1982. Here's the wild thing. The inflation rate really isn't a very good measure of the cost of housing. In 1982, coincidentally, the government decided to replace the cost of houses, which is a very obvious thing you would use in housing inflation, with a very arcane formula called owner's equivalent rent. And if you use a normal index of house prices, you'll see a much higher inflation. So, for example, right now, the year on year change in owners equivalent rent is only 4.2% and for anybody out there trying to buy a house and only trying to offer 4% more than last year, they know that doesn't work.
00:09:43.030 - 00:10:04.774, Speaker C: And anybody trying to rent an apartment knows 4.2% does not work. So that if you used any kind of housing index, like case Schiller, for example, which is a very widely respected index, the inflation rate is already 11% in kind of, I consider true terms. So we really are back to the craziest bit of the 70s.
00:10:04.832 - 00:10:23.714, Speaker A: So this is kind of a question about the 8.5% figure. Do you think that's really the lower bound then you're saying maybe the CPI, that the metric that the Fed uses to, quote unquote, measure inflation is somewhat off in some ways. What do you think the actual range of inflation might be? If that's the case?
00:10:23.832 - 00:10:41.062, Speaker C: Yeah. So I have been doing this a long time. There's all kinds of nuts talking about inflation. The government doesn't fairly measure things. And sometimes people make the argument for maybe an affluent consumer basket. It's higher and all that stuff. And so what my argument here is not to take any of those kind of little things.
00:10:41.062 - 00:11:06.286, Speaker C: It's just to focus on 35% of people's expenditure. Their biggest expenditure is housing. You have to rent an apartment, you have to buy a house. And so it's by far the most important thing in inflation. And the way the government currently calculates it with this owner's equivalent rent thing is very, very slow. It'll all come through over the next two or three years. All that pressure will actually show up, but it resets very slowly.
00:11:06.286 - 00:11:41.774, Speaker C: And so if you take the current core inflation rate, because the Fed likes to exclude food and energy, but again, those are very big expenses for us. So I think it is somewhat suspect to exclude those. But if you exclude food and energy and take the core inflation rate, but use case Schiller's index, which is currently running 19.2% year over year, you get a true core inflation rate of 10.7. And we have overnight Fed funds at 25 basis points. That's the problem. The Fed is fueling a massive overheating of the market.
00:11:41.774 - 00:12:08.526, Speaker C: And frankly, it's shocking how far behind they are on this that they're talking about maybe getting to neutrality. The US is clearly overheated. Like today's front page newspaper has the highest inflation rate in 40 years, and they're talking about maybe over the next year or two in these little quarter point increments getting back to 2%. I mean, honestly, it's really shocking. How far the Fed is away from reality.
00:12:08.718 - 00:12:40.030, Speaker A: Dan, I think a lot of listeners are feeling this, right. It's one thing when you see the numbers, it's another when you actually feel them. And so grocery bills going up in price, like gas and energy, housing, cost of living, all of these things. Americans, and I think not just the US, but people around the world are really starting to feel these numbers in a way I think a lot of people who've been alive have never experienced before. What do you make of this? That we're starting to feel these numbers more?
00:12:40.180 - 00:13:22.522, Speaker C: No, it is totally true that when inflation is very low, single digits, it's kind of easy to not notice it. But so many things now have a surcharge for whatever all these expenses. And in our, I think, November investor letter, I used a really cool index. I think because people can relate to it, the cost of ubers has doubled. And to me, that's such a great indication of the tightness in the labor market, because gig economy workers are obviously people that are kind of right on the edge of wanting to work, not wanting to. You know, a few years ago, a lot of people wanted to do that. And various government programs and the booming economy have taken a lot of people out of the gig economy.
00:13:22.522 - 00:13:50.406, Speaker C: And so people are actually literally seeing it every time they go ride. It costs twice as much as it did two years ago. And used cars now are higher priced than when they were brand new. That's super crazy. Never happened in history. The price of a 2021 average model year car is more expensive today than when the person drove off the lot. And that one, there's a little bit of a supply chain issue there.
00:13:50.406 - 00:14:00.790, Speaker C: But it's just there are things happening right now that literally never happened before. And it's happening across the know, basically everything is on fire and more expensive.
00:14:01.450 - 00:14:17.486, Speaker B: And this is the thing that everyone is experiencing for themselves, Dan. So we all know this to be true. We can see it in the gas prices. We can see it in the milk prices and the grocery. So no one really questions that. Everyone knows, oh, yeah, we have inflation now. This is the paradigm that we live under.
00:14:17.486 - 00:14:44.070, Speaker B: But for a lot of people, I think a lot of bankless listeners, including myself, who kind of got educated on money and finance through crypto, are kind of confused as to how we got here. You started this conversation off saying there's a bubble in the bond market, and I actually don't really know what that means. Can you explain how did we get a bubble in the bond market? How did this bubble just emerge? Where did it come from? Can you explain how we actually arrived to this point?
00:14:44.220 - 00:15:15.018, Speaker C: Sure. So there's really two sides to the same coin here. First, is Congress essentially approving $9 trillion worth of spending. The US's deficits in the last two years have literally been bigger than any year in World War II. World War II, we were fighting fascism. It was a big thing. Right? And here, the amount of money that's been spent fighting this invisible virus is staggering and very inefficient.
00:15:15.018 - 00:15:49.034, Speaker C: It's literally been 50 grand per family in the United States. I mean, that was just an enormous amount of money. And obviously there were some policies that needed to happen and there's some people that really needed help, but most of the people that got stimulus checks saved them. The savings rate went up in a recession, again, something that never happened in history. So 9 trillion new pieces of paper dollars were printed and sent around to everybody. Again, some, a minority of whom really needed the help and probably needed more help, but most of the people didn't. So what they do with it? They bought stuff with it.
00:15:49.034 - 00:16:20.886, Speaker C: They bought stocks. Stocks are at record highs. They bought gold, they bought bonds. So people invested all that free new printed money. And there's a great line from Milton Friedman in the 70s. Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. And I know there's some sticklers that say it's not totally always true, but in this case, if you print 9 trillion new pieces of paper money, it takes more pieces of paper money to buy a 2021 car or a median home in the United States or a share of the S and P 500.
00:16:20.886 - 00:16:53.278, Speaker C: It just really is that simple. And so if you print all this money, there's just more dollars running around to buy things. And we put a cool graphic up on our Twitter feed a while ago, which really inverted the price of money. Right? Normally we see the price of a bushel of corn in us dollars or we see the price of an ounce of gold in us dollars. You can flip that upside down and you can put the price of a us dollar in ounces of gold or bushels of corn. It's the same story. It's the dollar that's being debased and going down in value.
00:16:53.278 - 00:17:02.078, Speaker C: And ironically enough, all the rest of those things are kind of constant. So it really is, the value of paper money is being debased.
00:17:02.174 - 00:17:24.220, Speaker A: Is there also some difference here in how we printed it? Because people will remember we've been printing a lot of money for a while. In 2008, the bailouts, quantitative easing, I imagine it was less, maybe you might say, in order of magnitude less, but you can kind of educate us on that. But have we done something different? We didn't experience inflation in those years.
00:17:24.590 - 00:18:11.078, Speaker C: Yeah. So a couple of really important points there is we've tinkered with money printing since we went off the gold standard, right? And so we had a bout of a lot of money printing in the. We had a ton of inflation, and then we kind of got everything under control for a while. And then in the 2008 nine great financial crisis, there was a bit of that, and the Fed started doing something then that had never done before, not just managing the overnight cost of money, but actually starting to manipulate the bond market, which is a very, very interesting and strange thing to be doing. And so the Fed did it, but they did it in much smaller sizes. And as you said, it was an order of magnitude smaller. So we saw a little bit of an impact.
00:18:11.078 - 00:18:41.522, Speaker C: This time, though, we've had a twin policy surge of printing enormous amounts of money and literally mailing it to every american, whether they needed it or not, at the same time that the Fed was then. And so in the old days, there used to be a term called bond vigilantes. It would be when the government kind of got out of control. Bond investors would say, hey, I don't want to buy this debt at a ludicrously low yield. So we're going to wait until yields rise to an appropriate level. And they wouldn't buy it. This time.
00:18:41.522 - 00:19:27.730, Speaker C: The Fed manipulated the market instead of allowing the free market to figure out where interest rates should be. And interest rates are not this kind of esoteric concept that don't impact anybody. They're where you can borrow and a mortgage, right? Like they're really directly impacting the economy and construction and all that stuff. And the Fed decided to buy 9 trillion of long dated bonds, both government bonds and mortgage bonds, literally buying mortgages. So, I mean, there's only one little intermediary between the Federal Reserve and a guy getting a mortgage. Buy a house, right? The Fed really became the lender for our entire country. And people are rational, right? The Fed manipulated the rate of mortgages down to at 1.2.5%,
00:19:27.730 - 00:20:21.378, Speaker C: which is astronomically small. And the case Shiller index right now is at 19.2. So if the Fed is going to loan you money at two and a half percent and you think a house is going to go up 19%, they're basically daring you not to buy the house, right? They're making it hard to be responsible and reasonable or whatever, because they're providing money absurdly below its true value. And that's creating a bubble. One of the consequences of the bubble is it's driving up the price of homes. So they have a ton of work to know. One of the issues I see is somehow the Fed has this kind of sense that there's some kind of kabuki theater about how they have to do forward guidance and tell everybody what they're going to do and steps know some kind of minuette that happens over the next two years or whatever.
00:20:21.378 - 00:21:06.026, Speaker C: When I was a kid, the Fed reacted in real time to reality, right? Like if something happened, they just changed rates. And now we have this thing that, oh, you can only do 25 basis points, you can only do it every six weeks at an FOMC meeting. And it's only going to add up to 2% over the next two years, which is as well, totally surreal. Rates should be at 5% right now. It is a fascinating occurrence. In 35 years of trading, I've never seen something both so extreme and so massive, right? I've seen some weird trades in small little corners of the world, some emerging market where something weird is happening, but like the Federal Reserve is doing it 9 trillion sized. I mean, this is the biggest bubble.
00:21:06.026 - 00:21:29.974, Speaker C: In our December investor letter, we said it is a bubble. And we weren't talking about bitcoin, which is what most cynics are always saying. Bitcoin's a bubble. It's the US mortgage and bond market, and it's the Federal Reserve that's manipulating. And they were literally buying bonds a month ago when everything's already obviously overheated and out of control?
00:21:30.092 - 00:22:27.286, Speaker A: Dan, by the way, what's crazy about that mortgage trade that you're talking about where a two and a half percent or 2.25% mortgage in return for an asset that's going to appreciate has 20% per year, daring the average American not to go buy a home and get a mortgage and lever up as much as they can, right? Basically that's been the trade. And then also a backdrop of, let's say you take $100,000 mortgage out if you anticipate inflation is going to be high in their future, 8.5%. It's all denominated in dollars, right? Well, now the amount you have to pay back, at least in real terms, has just decreased according to whatever inflation is. So it really is just like for again, the 35% of people who aren't in that position can't do it. But for the remainder of America, it's just like, why the hell wouldn't I go get debt from the federal government? It's like more free money on top of stimulus checks, on top of all of the other things that they've pumped into the economy.
00:22:27.398 - 00:23:18.474, Speaker C: It is, it's a massive subsidy from one group renters to another group homeowners. Right? It really is crazy because it's totally disadvantaging people that don't own a home. And yes, for the people that have the circumstances to be able to buy a home or already own a home, it's free money, right? Like the Fed is subsidizing homeownership at a time when construction delays, we're maxed out. There's no rational reason to want to induce more housing construction. Here's my favorite stat on how crazy the Fed got the housing market is. There's a stat on the median time between when a house is listed and is sold. And in the old days, that was months, right? Because you put your house on the market, it takes a while.
00:23:18.474 - 00:24:00.442, Speaker C: You finally sell it a few months ago, that hit the bottom bound. They only measure it in weeks, and it hit one week across the entire United States. And not just like super know, Phoenix or whatever, Kansas, everywhere. The median time to sell a house is one week. And the really crazy irony is home sales are now declining, literally because there's not any more homes, not because there aren't more people that want to buy a home. It's, the inventory is now so small that even if there's 100 people running around a neighborhood trying to buy a house, there's only like five houses available. So the number of housing sales is declining, literally because we're running out of homes to buy.
00:24:00.442 - 00:24:04.394, Speaker C: And capitalism works, that means price of homes is going to go up, right?
00:24:04.592 - 00:24:38.838, Speaker B: Yeah. This is all quite unprecedented. Dan, in your investor letter in December, you had this graphic calculating a $15 trillion overvaluation in the bond market and forecasting a very steep drop off from like the $40 trillion back down to below $30 trillion. I'm wondering if you can kind of walk us through that math of that $15 trillion overvaluation. And then what happens next when the Federal Reserve tries to reduce the size of their balance sheet? Can you kind of walk us through what you think happens next with all of this?
00:24:39.004 - 00:24:39.286, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:39.308 - 00:25:16.622, Speaker C: So the main way to evaluate the value of a bond is to think about how much interest you're being paid above the rate of inflation, right? Because as you said, if you give somebody $100 and there's 10% inflation every year you got to make more than 10% to break even. And so the term is called real rate. So it's the rate above the inflation rate. And it makes a lot of sense. And that's why it's called the real rate, because it's actually the true rate you earn. And that historically has been about 2% positive. So you normally get about two percentage points more than inflation.
00:25:16.622 - 00:25:49.526, Speaker C: And over a 50 year period, it's average 2%. And that's what people think is relatively fair. That only works when there's arm's length. Economic actors in a market, we don't have that right now. We have a non economic actor, the Fed, manipulating the bond market. And so they drove rates down to, gosh, now they're -600 basis points. So they're 800 basis points below its long term historical average.
00:25:49.526 - 00:26:29.202, Speaker C: And so the graphic we did that shows the bubble and the 15 trillion overvaluation is the value of the entire bond market, both treasuries and mortgages. If the market were priced at its normal 2% real rate. And right now, well, when we first said it was 15 trillion overvalued, I think it's about 12 trillion now. And we said, hey, maybe the past doesn't totally predict the future, so maybe it doesn't go exactly back. But what if it went halfway back? That's 8 trillion of market cap that's going to evaporate. I think that's like a 90% chance of happening. It's very likely.
00:26:29.202 - 00:27:03.982, Speaker C: And the analog that we used for the old timers out there is a wild e. Coyote moment. And I think that's what it is, is financial gravity doesn't work when someone as big as the Fed can manipulate it. And so they're hanging out there with bonds completely disconnected from where any rational independent actor would buy them. And then they just stopped buying them. And then I think the Fed is soon going to realize they have to start selling bonds and get rates way back up. And so we're in that moment where you're levitating above the chasm.
00:27:03.982 - 00:27:53.666, Speaker C: And I think in about two months probably the Fed's going to realize, hey, this thing's really getting out of control. Instead of just kind of waiting around for these bonds to slowly mature, which is going to take a long time because the majority of their bonds are like 20 year maturity, they're going to have to start selling bonds. And so when you go from the Fed buying billions and billions of bonds every month to now selling tens of billions, the bonds are going to get crushed. I said in our letter, it's the first non blockchain trade I've done in eight years because it's so asymmetric. It's just like bitcoin or blockchain. And so I think it's like a 90% chance. Rates go way up, and I think tenure rates are going to quadruple from where they were when we first started this, which doesn't happen very often.
00:27:53.666 - 00:28:27.022, Speaker C: And the punchline of bonds is if you're a homeowner and you're borrowing it at two and a half or you're short, say you get short a ten year treasury note at 2%, right. In ten years you can only be down 20 points. Right. That's absolutely the worst. And I think bonds could drop 20 points in the next four or five months. So it's one of those trades where it really has so much more upside than downside. And again, with the tiny exception of 2008 nine, when the Fed did do a little bit of manipulation in the bond market, they've never done it before.
00:28:27.022 - 00:29:06.634, Speaker C: And frankly, I just don't know why they're doing it. It's not their mandate. And so I think this is getting badly, unfortunately. And then you can imagine congressional hearings, blah, blah, blah, and people just realizing, hey, that was a one and done experiment, right? And so I don't think the Fed's ever going to buy another bond again, but they might be kind of compelled or somehow decide they need to sell their portfolio. And until rates get way above 5%, I think they have to keep encouraging rates to rise. And since they own 9 trillion of bonds, they could certainly do it. Right.
00:29:06.672 - 00:29:38.520, Speaker B: Okay, so one of the reasons why there's a big bubble in the bond market is because the Fed has been buying the bonds, right? Like raising the floor. Just a fake economic actor buying bonds. So that's adding to the bubble. But you just had $9 trillion on the fed balance sheet and bonds. But I think that's like only one third of the total market cap of bonds. So who else is owning all of these bonds, and why aren't they scared? If I was owning bonds and I saw the Fed turn from a buyer to a seller, I'd get really scared. So who's about to be holding the bag right now?
00:29:39.130 - 00:30:42.310, Speaker C: Well, the largest owner is called the People's Republic of, you know, the biggest owners of U. S. Bonds, other than the Federal Reserve, are other central banks who themselves are manipulating their currency price, right? So China and others accumulate reserves because they're trying to keep their currency from floating at a free market rate, which would be higher or more valuable. So it is a funny situation where the Fed is obviously manipulating the bond market. So is the People's Republic of China and other large. And that's a whole nother topic. Know, with the russian invasion of the Ukraine and sanctions, can't imagine there's going to be a marginal increase in the number of nation states that want to own bonds that can be forfeited, locked, whatever, which we'll get to crypto at some point, but I think that's net positive for crypto.
00:30:42.310 - 00:31:26.486, Speaker C: But the punchline is there aren't many, like, you probably don't own a lot of treasuries. There aren't many kind of normal people, normal investors that do. When I was growing up, there was the whole kind of 60 40 normal asset allocation mix, 60% bonds, 60% stocks, 40% bonds. I can't imagine. I'm sure there's pension plans and insurance companies that have kind of legacy portfolios that still have a decent amount of bonds. But if you're looking at all the facts that we can see today, as a normal free market investor, it just is so hard to say, hey, at 2.7% for the next ten years, with inflation reported at 8.5,
00:31:26.486 - 00:31:43.040, Speaker C: but really, at like 10.7, I'm going to buy a 2.7% tenure note. I really can't imagine how anyone would do that. I think the penny is dropping, but it's dropping very slowly. And I think. Ryan, you mentioned a line that's very important.
00:31:43.040 - 00:32:23.894, Speaker C: There is no working age American that has invested in a rising rate environment. I mean, that is so important to keep in our heads that I'm 56 and it was already six years into the bull market when I got to Wall street. Right? And the tenure note was at 10% when I got to Wall street. Right. So it could easily be five or ten again. Right? But most people your age have literally never even come close to seeing a 10% tenure note, right? And I think we're just all used to the Fed just bails you out, like, oh, you bought a little too much real estate, or, oh, you invest in something that's not great. Well, we'll just keep lowering rates.
00:32:23.894 - 00:33:09.202, Speaker C: And as you lower rates, it just decreases the discount factor and just everything just kind of has been going up for 40 years because rates just keep going down and down and down. In July of last year, rates, tenure rates hit 54 basis points. That's it. That was the end of the bull market. Rates certainly aren't going any lower than that. And then I think we're in like a five year bear market on bonds and we all have to get our head around that. I'm still trying to figure out what that means in our portfolios, but I just think, like you said, that most people are investing today, never even thought about inflation and probably couldn't care less about the Fed and don't really have never had to think about any of these things.
00:33:09.202 - 00:34:10.406, Speaker C: And I think unfortunately, it's going to be thrust upon us. We're all going to have to deal with like, well, what do we do with persistent double digit real inflation? What do we do with rising Fed rates? And then I actually think the Fed's inserting a lot of uncertainty by being so far behind the ball and still talking about trying to get to neutrality when it's patently obvious that we're way overheated and we haven't even talked about the labor market. Like the labor market is the thing that's totally impacted here. So all those things are going to take a long time, like years to deal with. And then the last one added this whole list of things that are changing. The way we're investing is for hundreds of years we've been globalizing and we've been just in time manufacturing. And all of these trends, all of whom like the peace dividend at the end of the Cold War, 2 billion people came into the labor pool.
00:34:10.406 - 00:34:49.746, Speaker C: So all these things have been wonderful for the secular decline of both inflation and yields. Right? They're all reversing right now. Hopefully it's all temporary. Hopefully the world kind of gets back to normal. But there's some trends where we're talking about localization and reshoring that supposedly the way America is going to get out of all this is like building more manufacturing in the US or whatever. None of those things are good for lowering inflation and lowering yields. And again, hopefully all this is that that bit is kind of a temporary blip, but many of these other things are very permanent.
00:34:49.746 - 00:34:59.450, Speaker C: And I think that's the thing that we all have to get our heads around. A lot of big things are changing and most are for higher yields and higher inflation for a while.
00:34:59.600 - 00:35:38.834, Speaker A: Okay, so just maybe to kind of recap, because we've talked about a lot so far, right? But we have these unprecedented inflation rates. The Fed, for whatever reason, has seemed surprised by this, caught flat footed or like post facto sort of reacting about this. And they've been buying bonds since COVID started, like massive amounts. And so now we have this big bond bubble and a fed balance sheet to unwind. And that's what's maybe beginning to happen. That's starting to sink in, that no longer purchasing bonds, but maybe the Fed will actually have to unwind its balance sheet. And also interest rates are increasing.
00:35:38.834 - 00:36:14.062, Speaker A: So the Fed is trying to increase interest rates. And to your point, fed rates have been basically down only for the past, I don't know how many decades, for very long time, probably for most people's lifetime who are listening to this. So that's all happening right now. And I'm wondering how unprecedented this actually is because I think the Fed chair recently said this was unprecedented. Right. Sort of like a different time. But haven't we seen something like this before in us history? And I know you were harkening back to, like, World War II spending.
00:36:14.062 - 00:36:52.670, Speaker A: Certainly there's some of that with COVID but also the 1970s. That was an era of very high inflation. And I noticed in one of your recent letters, which are fantastic, by the way, Dan, really enjoy reading those whenever I receive them, is your group did a pantera, did a comparison of the 1970s versus today, and there were some eerie similarities between that decade, I think, February 1979, and where we are today. I'm wondering if you could talk about this. Is this unprecedented, or have we seen elements of this in the decade that was the 1970s?
00:36:52.820 - 00:37:24.122, Speaker C: Yeah, it's such a great question. And I've been shocked at how slow the Fed has been to see what's happening in real time. I mean, statistics have been very clear for at least six months, maybe longer. And so their original line was it's transitory and it's a supply shock. And I think that perception was always wrong. The problem isn't there's like a couple of ships stuck outside Long Beach harbor. Right.
00:37:24.122 - 00:37:48.546, Speaker C: The supply shock is there is 2 million less americans working than before the pandemic started. Right. And that's by choice. The unemployment rates as low as it's ever been. Right. There's policies that have induced a lot of people that just leave the workforce. So that's the problem, man, that can't be solved by just waiting for transitory time to kind of go by.
00:37:48.546 - 00:38:16.266, Speaker C: So I do think the Fed's been really slow in seeing this. And then they've just said that it's unprecedented. And I don't know, it looks just like the. So that's what we titled our last investor layer. It's called the precedent is the 1970s. And basically all the stats are spot on. The, it's honestly, and maybe no.
00:38:16.266 - 00:38:47.620, Speaker C: But most of the Fed governors, they're my age or older, they should have some sense that this is pretty similar. And so many things are the same. The amount of money printing is the same. We even have wars and oil crises, which are unfortunately exactly the same as 70s. So if you look at the stats, GDP growth is exactly 5.5 where it was in 1979. Everything is the same.
00:38:47.620 - 00:39:07.654, Speaker C: Inflation core CPI at the time was 11.3 in 1979. If you take the real housing price, it's 10.7. So all these stats are similar. Wage inflation very high, all that. The difference is fed funds at the time were 10% and they're 25 basis points. Now, that is the disconnect.
00:39:07.654 - 00:39:20.730, Speaker C: That's the thing that's just so hard to understand. There's literally never been a time that the gap between the inflation rate and the overnight federal funds rate has been this wide. That's the only unprecedented thing, is that the Fed's so far behind the curve.
00:39:20.810 - 00:39:47.190, Speaker A: Yeah, what's crazy? So we'll include a link to this chart, and I think this is for homework. Bankless listeners, go take a look at this chart from Pantera on the February 1979 versus today, and you'll notice there are two columns comparing all of these metrics that Dan was just saying. Like CPI, for instance. Then it was 11.3%, now 7.9%, maybe 8.5% at this point in time.
00:39:47.190 - 00:40:18.834, Speaker A: Core CPI, again, comparable to the 1970s. Go down this list and you'll see a ton of comparisons to the 1970s, except three different rows. The first is the fed balance sheet. 1979, it was 3.6%. Now we have a reading of 115%. All time highs by far. Okay, Fed fund rates in the 1970s, it was more reflective, maybe of the real market reality at 10%, and now it's zero point 25%.
00:40:18.834 - 00:40:46.986, Speaker A: Okay. And then ten year bond yield. Again, that was more reflective of the reality of rewarding investors for the risk they're exposed to and taking a bond. It was 9.1% in 1979. Now it's 2.4%. So we have the inflation of the 1970s, but we have a much less healthy fed balance sheet and a massive amount of manipulation that we didn't have in the 1970s.
00:40:46.986 - 00:40:48.714, Speaker A: That's the picture you're painting, right?
00:40:48.832 - 00:41:33.026, Speaker C: Oh, it is. I think back, if you would ask an economist at that point, should the Fed be the only net buyer of bonds, people would say, oh, that sounds super banana Republic. Right? So the central government prints all this money, and then the other side of the government buys all that printed money and they just kind of keep doing this and there's no impact anywhere. That's the big difference. People would have freaked if you would have said, hey, why doesn't the Fed take the free market interest rate of ten and ram it down to two and a half? Why don't we try that? People would have said, oh, that's the world. That's such a banana republic thing to do. And the way we're behaving is total banana republic.
00:41:33.058 - 00:41:48.800, Speaker A: Well, what happened? Did the Overton window just shift? Like 2008, we were like, oh, we printed some money and everything turned out fine. There's no inflation. And society kind of accepted that this is the way things are. And we do have the get out of jail free cards and we can use this at any time we want.
00:41:49.410 - 00:42:44.030, Speaker C: Yeah. So I actually don't totally know what shifted, but one of the things is I think we've all collectively gotten so used to, oh, well, if rates just always keep going down, it doesn't actually matter how much debt we accumulate, right? Because if rates keep going down and down and down, even if you have 140% of GDP in debt, if you're only paying 25 basis points, it's kind of almost zero anyway, so it doesn't matter. And I just think somebody forgot to kind of take a step back and realize, well, maybe if rates do go up, all this positive spiral actually starts cranking in the opposite direction, becomes a very negative spiral. And that's the tricky math. Back in the debt to GDP was probably in the 50s, maybe something like that, and it's 140. Now you can kind of do anything with debt at a 50% of GDP because it's not that impactful. At 140%.
00:42:44.030 - 00:43:45.778, Speaker C: It's hard, right? All the numbers get there. And so I just don't know what happened with the Fed that I think they got so into this forward guidance kind of thing that talking about when they're going to taper like a couple of months ago, talk about tapering, the amount of bond manipulation, they would know. It should have been tapered, it should have been selling, it should have been like crushing the bond. It would have been way healthier for America if the Fed started selling bonds six months ago rather than tapering. So I don't know why they've been so slow at it. But honestly, I think there's going to be a lot of PhD thesis written about this, right? They're so far behind that, unfortunately, I think the damage is going to be greater than had they done this at the appropriate time. Six or nine months ago, gotten rates to a more appropriate level because we're now swinging at such extremes, 19.2%
00:43:45.778 - 00:44:32.834, Speaker C: housing inflation. That's got everybody keyed up. They're all running to buy a house, right? Humans are pavlovian, man. You give them a little treat and they just keep doing it. So if you keep giving people 19% appreciation on a house, they want to buy another one or they want to buy a bigger one, and it's going to take a lot more to unwind that, right? Because we've gotten this thing so frothed up. And one of the great lines that we put in an investor letter is there's a line that encapsulates all the arcane logic of central banking by an old school fed governor, William I think Micheson E. Martin in the, he said the role of the Fed is akin to a chaperone at a party that as soon as the party gets going, has to take the punch bowl away.
00:44:32.834 - 00:45:01.274, Speaker C: So it doesn't really get out of hand. And what the Fed's been doing here is like an f one racer with the champagne spraying like, they are the opposite of taking the punch ball away. They are just like spraying champagne on everybody. And a lot of people get it. Like, if the Fed is going to loan you money right now, still the Fed's loaning money at 5% to mortgages. Like, you can get a mortgage at five and houses are going up at 19. I don't know why I'm sitting here on this call.
00:45:01.274 - 00:45:21.602, Speaker C: I should go out and get a mortgage and buy a house. Right? You feel like you're missing out if you're not doing it. And so that's why I am afraid it's going to take a lot more to slow this down. It's like a rhinoceros. The housing market is like a rhinoceros. And they got this little peace shooter. They're trying to stop it with 25 basis points, not stopping the housing market.
00:45:21.602 - 00:45:37.558, Speaker C: Right. Honestly, frankly, and I originally said six months ago they were going to have to raise rates to at least 5%. Even if that were happening today, I don't know if that's enough. Right. There's so much pent up power in the economy right now.
00:45:37.724 - 00:46:05.090, Speaker B: So using that metaphor of just like the champagne just being flowing everywhere, it feels like the hangover is coming. But the hangover doesn't necessarily have to be felt by the same parts of the economy. Right. So if we're going into stagflation, Danny, you've said that this isn't unprecedented. We've seen this all before. But me personally, I was born in the, Ryan was born in the. That's going to encompass like 90% of bankless listeners.
00:46:05.090 - 00:46:11.374, Speaker B: For us. That is unprecedented. We've never had to navigate through stagflation.
00:46:11.422 - 00:46:15.342, Speaker A: Before, and a lot of people don't even know what stagflation means, by the way, Dan.
00:46:15.486 - 00:46:15.842, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:15.896 - 00:46:25.750, Speaker B: So what parts of the economy are going to feel the hangover the most? And how should people look towards the 70s for guidance here? Like, how can we survive stagflation?
00:46:26.170 - 00:47:12.966, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a great question, and that's why I certainly don't think most of your listeners should know anything about this. But the Fed governors, they're around for the, they also have phds in economics, so even if they're not that old, they should know. And so to say it's unprecedented, I think is kind of a cop out. I think the stagflation thing is coming. That's a portmanteau of the word stagnation and inflation together. And it's a tricky problem when you have not much growth and lots of inflation. And there is an index in the 70s which is potentially going to come back called the misery index, which is an addition of the unemployment rate and the inflation rate.
00:47:12.966 - 00:47:39.790, Speaker C: And luckily, I think we're probably going to be close to full employment for a while. So that's not the biggest problem. It really is the inflation side of it. But to combat that, the Fed's really going to have to get engaged and not just stop buying bonds, but essentially let the market determine. I mean, America is supposed to be this big free market economy. Right. And we have a totally manipulated the largest market in the United States is weird.
00:47:39.790 - 00:47:47.922, Speaker C: It's really a weird place for us to be. And I forget the second half of your question. You had another part of it that I spaced on.
00:47:48.056 - 00:47:51.374, Speaker B: Yeah, it was just like, which parts of the economy are going to be hit with this hangover?
00:47:51.422 - 00:48:21.130, Speaker C: The saw member of Congress just said something. Know, we got these twin issues to deal with. The COVID hangover and inflation. I'm like, they're actually the same thing is the policy response to Covid is why we have inflation? Right. They are the same thing. And I think that's what is frustrating for me as a taxpayer and supporter of our economy here. It still doesn't seem like Congress is getting it.
00:48:21.130 - 00:49:11.342, Speaker C: They're still talking about more stimulus and the economy is totally overheated. I think the unfortunate reality is it is going to have a very disproportionate impact on people. And the kind of sad irony is the Fed has actually spent a lot of time talking about the kind of inclusiveness of their policies and to help lower and middle income Americans. And frankly, their policies have been terrible for those people, and they're great. If you own stocks and a house, you love the Fed, right? The majority of Americans don't directly own stocks, and 35% of Americans don't own a house. So I actually think the Fed's policies have really been quite terrible for the majority of Americans or young people, right. Coming out of college, you don't have a house.
00:49:11.342 - 00:49:57.642, Speaker C: So you don't want the Fed artificially inflating the value of the housing market. So the reality is it's definitely beneficial to anybody that owns stocks or crypto or a house. And it's essentially disadvantaging people that either don't own all those types of assets or on normal wages. And so while the government has tried to tout the wage gains and the ECI wage index is 5.7%, which is the best measure of wages in the United States, and benefits and everything people get, which sounds great. Like, wouldn't you love to get a 5.7% raise? That would be totally awesome if everything didn't cost 8.5%
00:49:57.642 - 00:50:31.666, Speaker C: more. And so your net negative 250 basis points. And again, they're not surprisingly, real wages, which is wages above inflation, used to be positive. It used to be positive, 1%. And so it really is tricky. This policy mix, which is unprecedented and totally extreme, is disadvantaging people. And I would say that the Fed, we did talk about their word just now, neutrality, do no harm.
00:50:31.666 - 00:50:51.194, Speaker C: Right? Just get back to doing less. The Fed's doing too much. And again, there are some segments of our society that are loving it. It's been great. And actually, a record number of people have retired. Right? So there's a lot of people. There's a million Americans have a house, have their retirement plan set up.
00:50:51.194 - 00:51:06.166, Speaker C: They got to retire. So they think this is great. Right? So it's certainly good for some people, but for our country as a whole, I just don't think it's good. And it's definitely disadvantaging huge segments of our society.
00:51:06.298 - 00:51:13.602, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the millennials and Gen Z's are listening, watching baby boomers retire, and realizing they can't even afford rent and they'll be able to buy.
00:51:13.656 - 00:51:18.580, Speaker C: Honestly, I hope you guys help make this be kind of a generational issue.
00:51:19.670 - 00:52:17.590, Speaker A: I think here's the thing, Dan. I think so many of us definitely need to get involved in politics and kind know shape things, but at the same time, so much of this just feels like we're all bound up on the wheel of fate. Like, what can we possibly do? Go stand outside somewhere in Washington DC and just protest what Jerome Powell is doing, an unelected bureaucrat and the other powers that be. I think there's some systemic issues that feel so much out of our control right now. But one difference between the 1970s and now is now we have crypto. We didn't have crypto in the 1970s. And so let's kind of transition to the second part of this conversation, which is now that we've established what's going on, what's happening, let's talk about what we can do individually, how to prepare again, it would be really nice if we had a plan in this conversation on how to fix fed monetary policy, but that's too broken.
00:52:17.590 - 00:52:50.802, Speaker A: I don't even know if Powell or any Paul Volcker of the 2020s will be able to actually fix all of this shit that's going on. Okay, so now it's back to kind of the individual. What do we do as individuals to try to save ourselves and those around us? So how do we position for all of this, Dan? What's going to happen in the great unwind? What should we be buying? What should we not be buying? How should we position ourselves in life? Do you have any thoughts for us?
00:52:50.936 - 00:53:30.894, Speaker C: Yeah, that's an important statement and question, and that is one of my lines. It's like, nobody asked me to vote on whether to spend 50 grand per family fighting an invisible virus. I would probably said, no, that's not very efficient. But with crypto, you get to vote with your wallet. And so that is the advice is like, if you're frustrated with policies that the Fed is doing, one is you can definitely vote for candidates for elected office that share whatever views you have. So although you can't influence the Fed, you can influence Congress and your governor or your president. So you can definitely do that.
00:53:30.894 - 00:54:25.522, Speaker C: But a practical way to do that is to opt out of debasement of paper money and opt into hard assets like crypto. Right? And that's why it's been so popular. My favorite stat to show how popular crypto is, is at the beginning of 2021. If you got a bunch of investors and economists in a room and you told them all those stats that we've just been over, the inflation rate, the wage inflation, the house prices going up, all those stats. And you said you just have to pick which direction gold is going to go, up or down. There's no one in the room that would have said down and gold went down. In 2021 it was down 4% because everybody's buying digital gold, right? Like everybody's gone past the old school gold gold and bought digital gold and ethereum, polka dot, whatever.
00:54:25.522 - 00:55:22.450, Speaker C: So that is the right answer, right? It's to opt out of the old system, opt into the future payment rail of the world. And so blockchain, and that's why everyone loves it so much, honestly, and that they're so positive and hopeful, is blockchain a from a financial standpoint, allows you to manage your finances better and invest in things that won't be debased. But then ultimately, obviously, collectively governed protocols are way better than the kind of representative government ones that we currently have. And that's going to take 20 or 30 years. I'm not saying dows are going to replace Congress tomorrow, but in like 20 or 30 years, I think the world's going to be way better. There's so many things about either centrally owned data monopolies or even governments that aren't really great for all the people, which will be better when it's done in a blockchain based, decentralized version. And that's why blockchain keeps growing.
00:55:22.450 - 00:55:38.650, Speaker C: The more people that realize that it's empowering and you're opting out of a system that you don't have any control over and it hasn't works very well. And we're just at the beginning of that. Right. I think we have a couple more decades of people moving into blockchain.
00:55:39.230 - 00:56:30.442, Speaker B: So looking externally from the macro situation of the Fed and the US dollar, there's other macro events that are going on that are relevant to crypto, like the Ukraine war and all the fallout from that with regards to wheat production and food production and oil production and energy production is also part of this overall macro picture that's impacting the crypto markets. But that story has been pretty well digested, I would say, over the last three weeks, people have come to terms with what's going on. And the general sentiment that I've gathered is that the crypto markets are holding up far better than people expected them over the last two to three weeks. And we've also at the same time digested and accepted the unwinding of the Federal Reserve treasury. Right. We're trying to unwind $9 billion. Interest rates are going to go up.
00:56:30.442 - 00:57:06.338, Speaker B: And again, the crypto markets. After internalizing and digesting these news, we are still at 3000 ether. We are still in the $40,000 bitcoin level. And so what do you make of that? The crypto market response to what seems to be just a huge 1234 punch of macro to the crypto markets. And the crypto markets are, I mean, they're not doing anything like they were doing in 2021 right now, but they are also not going down in the same way that they went down in 2018. What do you make of the crypto markets and how the crypto markets are digesting all of this macro news?
00:57:06.504 - 00:57:30.714, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a great question. It just shows everybody has their own perspective. I would actually say crypto has done a lot worse than I would have expected, given all this. And so it's cool that you think it's the opposite. And the take I would have on this is we called the bond bubble of Ponzi scheme on December 7, I think, which was the high print of the bonds. Spot on. Couldn't have called it better.
00:57:30.714 - 00:58:03.382, Speaker C: It was awesome. But I had no idea everything was going down 27%. Right. Like in the crypto industry, when you're trading and it doesn't work, you have to think about whether you're wrong or the markets are wrong and they're going to revert. And I really think that I'm massively bullish on crypto right now. And I think that the reason I am partly is because, hey, every two years for the last ten years, an order of magnitude more people come into crypto. So I think that steady flow of just smart people reading about it is coming.
00:58:03.382 - 00:58:55.798, Speaker C: But the other asset classes being destroyed, I think, is going to sink in. And basically there's almost nowhere to hide. Right. And that's why we called it the great unwind. Everything except crypto, I think, is really going to be impacted. And if we're even partly right, that bond yields are going to go to 5% or higher, that obviously crushes bond prices, but it has to impact stocks and real estate and anything else that has a discounted cash flow. And so I think for a normal investor that's looking at all the kind of normal asset classes like stocks, bonds, real estate, whatever, and cryptocurrencies, and it might take another few months, maybe they're going to just say, hey, if we have money to put to work, it's hard to imagine putting it to work in any of these other things.
00:58:55.798 - 00:59:33.950, Speaker C: And crypto should be completely disconnected from interest rates. Right. There really isn't any reason that a utility token like bitcoin should really care if rates are zero, 510 percent. Really, I don't see why it should matter. So I do think they will decouple, which is a story we've been all talking about for a decade. And the reality is bitcoin is typically not correlated with everything else, but it does get really correlated in these stress moments when the s and p comes off a big bunch. So I think that the macro story ultimately would be seen as hugely positive for crypto.
00:59:33.950 - 01:00:49.110, Speaker C: And again, I'll admit I've been very surprised that crypto hasn't done as well so far this year as I would have imagined. And even one of the points you raised, which is an important one, it's a confusing one, is the russian invasion of the Ukraine and then all of the policy responses, it's hard to really know how everything's going to play out. And obviously it's a huge international or humanitarian catastrophe, but it seems like when the dust clears, it's probably going to make more people want to use crypto. And I'm not saying that just from both sides. Basically, individual citizens who, like, they didn't get to vote on whether russian citizens didn't get to vote on whether to invade Ukraine. And so there's going to be a lot more people around the world that are going to want to insulate themselves from their own dictators, bad decisions. So individual citizens are going to want to own more crypto, and then governments are going to want to own assets that are not controlled by kind of central payment rails, like any kind of treasury would be or us dollar.
01:00:49.110 - 01:01:39.514, Speaker C: And so in the old days, they buy gold, right? Because the Nazis try to put a bunch of gold bricks on a japanese sub and send it to Argentina and know old school things like gold are obviously not connected to the payment rails of the west. But, man, crypto, it's living in the cloud, right? It's a way. And so I would have said before the war that it'd probably take maybe five more years for a central bank to buy bitcoin. I think it's me in the next couple of years. And once the first one does, I think a lot are going to do it. And I'm not saying everybody's going to sell all their dollars and go 100% bitcoin, but global fx reserves being 5% bitcoin in ten years, I think that could easily happen. And again, those are big numbers.
01:01:39.514 - 01:02:25.238, Speaker C: And that's why blockchain is such an amazing trade. All the tams, the total addressable markets are all so stupidly big, so I do think it's probably going to be. In hindsight, when we look back, it's probably going to have been seen as a catalyst for more people kind of thinking through the concept of the separation of money and state, right? We're just all used to, oh, money has to be issued by our government. Not really. Computer programs can issue money too, and bitcoin has only been around for 13 years and Ethereum for seven or whatever, so it's not forever. And gold's been around for 5000, so gold's got a long track record. But I think the tide's changing.
01:02:25.334 - 01:03:13.690, Speaker B: The layer two era is upon us. Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day, and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge. With across, you don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer two back to ethereum, a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum, where community members will decide on the token distribution. You can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a cofounder and helping to design the fair, fair launch of across. If you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely, go to across to bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, arbitram or Boba networks.
01:03:13.690 - 01:03:55.106, Speaker B: Arbitrum is an Ethereum layer two scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs. Over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrum, and the DFI and NFT ecosystems are growing rapidly. Some of the coolest and newest NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home. All the while, DFI protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity. Using arbitrum has never been easier, especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitrum through all the exchanges, including binance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com. Once inside, you'll notice arbitram increases Ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee. If you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users, visit Arbitrum IO slash developer to start building your DaP on Arbitrum.
01:03:55.106 - 01:04:36.446, Speaker B: If you're a dgen, many of your favorite dapps on Ethereum are already on Arbitrum, with many moving over every day. Go to bridge arbitrum IO now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience defi Nfts in the way it was always meant to be. Fast, cheap, secure, and friction free. Living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys, and that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet. And brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the Ledger Nanos plus, a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet. With more memory and a larger screen, the Nanos plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions. And the paired ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your NFT.
01:04:36.446 - 01:05:06.830, Speaker B: What you see is what you sign. The Nanos plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things. So go to the Ledger website to check out the features of the new Ledger Nanos plus and join the waitlist to get yours. And don't forget about the crypto life card. Also powered by Ledger, the CL card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app, right next to all the defi apps and services that you're already used to doing, like swapping tokens and staking. So if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet, go to ledger.com, grab a ledger and take control over your crypto.
01:05:06.830 - 01:06:23.526, Speaker B: Yeah, the tide is certainly changing, and one of the lines that we frequently say on bankless is that as the world becomes more and more and more chaotic, the volatility and chaos of the crypto world just seems less by comparison. And all of a sudden, the use cases just are illuminated when the Federal Reserve and a bunch of money printing happens, or like you said, no russian citizen voted for the invasion of Ukraine, causing a collapse in the ruble, the money that they store their value. And so all of a sudden, the threshold for a lot of the people of the world for understanding why they might be interested in crypto becomes a lot lower. And that's bullish in of itself. But I want to go back and just double click on the decoupling between the interest rates and the crypto assets because I didn't totally fully wrap my head around that. And so I want to just ask that question one more time, because everyone that I've heard previously is that rising interest rates is bad for risk on assets. And what is a risk on asset, if not for the whole entire crypto industry? I can go without saying that when the crypto markets are coupled to the equities markets or the macro markets, it's generally to the bearish side, and when it's decoupled, it's to the bullish side.
01:06:23.526 - 01:06:36.758, Speaker B: Why do you think we are decoupled now when we weren't previously? If you do agree that we weren't previously, why are we decoupling? And why can we have rising interest rates which we all see are coming, yet still be bullish crypto?
01:06:36.934 - 01:07:29.190, Speaker C: Yeah, so it did. Just remind me, I first visited the Soviet Union in 1990, right? When Gorbachev was doing his opening his glass notes, and I went to buy some books in the Kremlin bookstore and tried to hand them rubles, and they said, no, only US dollars. And I'm like, you guys are fucked if you won't even accept your own currency. The Soviet Union is over. And like a year later, they were toast. So the decoupling story is historically, in the last eleven years that we have data, bitcoin has had a very high correlation with the S and P 500 in the six big down spikes of the SP, historically for 71 days on average. And so that's my framework, is that there's this kind of instinctual desire to, like you say, risk on risk off asset drop.
01:07:29.190 - 01:08:24.720, Speaker C: And it has historically worked in very short time periods. But the reason I don't believe it has to work over long time periods is the whole concept of risk on risk off, which I even heard chairman Bernanke once use in his speech, which is very wild, that a very educated PhD in economics is talking about risk on risk off is the reason that happens is not because certain assets have any underlying reason to be correlated, it's because the same people own the same stuff. And I started out when hedge funds were called alts alternatives. They're not alternative anymore. Everybody owns the same stuff, right? And so when somebody wants to sell bonds, they also have to sell stocks, they have to sell gold, they have to sell every. If an institutional investor is told by their boss, you got to reduce risk by 4% or whatever, they just sell stuff across the board. And that's why things are correlated, not because there's any economic reality to be.
01:08:24.720 - 01:09:16.298, Speaker C: The reason I'm still convinced that blockchain can have a very low correlation with everything else is most people don't own any of it, right? Like most institutional investors really don't own a material amount of cryptocurrency assets. So some of the biggest endowments maybe have one or two or 3%. In blockchain, there's a lot that still owns zero. Most major insurance companies basically own zero. And so that's how they can stay uncorrelated, I think, for the next, say, five years, if we're right, and blockchain is a really important thing, and in time, it becomes an asset class, I think everyone will have, like, 8% of their portfolio on blockchain. So in ten years, blockchain will be as correlated with the SP as anything else, commodities or bonds or whatever. But for now, I really think it can be uncorrelated.
01:09:16.298 - 01:09:57.014, Speaker C: And one of my other thoughts that we did just put in the last investor letter is I think the cycles are going to be much more muted than they used to be. So in my nine years of trading, we've seen six bear markets, I think, and they averaged earlier, 83%, which tests your conviction. So that's the thing. I don't think we're going to have anymore. I don't think we're going to have any more 83% bear markets. Right. I think that as more and more institutions come into the industry and very importantly, invest for a much longer time frame than kind of most retail type people is, I think we're now going to see bear markets that are something like 50%, which in the real world would be catastrophic.
01:09:57.014 - 01:10:40.710, Speaker C: But in bitcoin, that's shallow, and that'd be really nice. So I think the bringing in institutions will ultimately, over time, increase the correlation with the rest of the asset classes, but will mute the amplitude of these swings. And then the big thing is, like you said about the uncertainty and the chaos in the world, I think we've been so used to just dampening volatility, dampening uncertainty, and even the Fed predicts where they're going to be two years from now. I don't know where I'll be next week. Right? Like, it's so crazy to be trying to say what your policy is going to be two years from now, that literally is going to be all blown up. The whole forward guidance thing six months from now, you'll never hear that word again. That's over.
01:10:40.710 - 01:11:14.462, Speaker C: That's such a crazy concept. And so, unfortunately, I think they've injected a lot of uncertainty, and if rates have to rise to 5% or more, like, I think, wow, I don't even know what all the impacts are going to be. There's going to be a lot of weird things happen. And that's why we called it the great unwind. Like, as you do a rate move that hasn't happened in 40 years, you're going to expose strange leverages that people didn't know about. So I think there's going to be a lot of volatility. And like you said, as crypto becomes less volatile and everything else gets crazy volatile, crypto is not going to look as weird anymore.
01:11:14.462 - 01:11:57.646, Speaker C: It used to look really scary because, hey, there was a year, I think it was 2020. The biggest drawdown, the s and P 500, was 2.3%. Like, literally peak to trough, it never went down by more than 2.3%. So why not just keep putting more money in equities, right? Like, if you're a retail person or institution and you just put your money in and the worst time you ever have is you're down 2.3%, and on average, you go up 20% every year, you just keep buying more of it. And the same thing with houses, right? If they always go up and they're going up 19%, you buy more of it. If stuff starts getting squirrely here, which I think it will, people realize that crypto is not that scary.
01:11:57.646 - 01:12:30.998, Speaker C: And here's a cool factoid for your listeners. Although bitcoin's had all those crazy bear markets, there's only one calendar year. It printed a new low in the last eleven years. Like, even though it went down 83%, it ended up higher than it started. And so even though crypto has this vision of being so crazy and so many bear markets and nuclear winters and all this stuff, there's only one calendar year where it printed a new low. And so crypto isn't as wild as some of these other things in reality. And then I think the other things are going to get kind of strange.
01:12:31.094 - 01:13:04.722, Speaker A: It's kind of crazy. It's only volatile if you sell. Come on, guys, just buy and hold and dollar cost average in if you need to, across all of these years, and it's basically been up only. And so, Dan, just to zoom in on that, though, I think you said in your most recent letter is I think we're done with the bear market, negative 50%, and we're onto a new rally. And you're talking about the bear market in crypto. The next six to twelve months are likely to see massive rallies. Investors flee stocks, bonds and real estate for blockchain.
01:13:04.722 - 01:13:17.180, Speaker A: So that's what you've just been describing. But are you calling the bear market over? I mean, some people, this is their first cycle in crypto, and they're like, oh, my God, it's a bear market and it's going to be down. Do you think the bear market is over?
01:13:18.590 - 01:14:02.490, Speaker C: I really do that we've gone through these cycles where it's typically like 150 days or so of bear market, and then the bull markets have been like 300 days. So the bear markets are half as long as the bull markets, and this one's been 107 days or something to the low. We often hit lows kind of after big rally years and before tax day. And so all those things are just intuitions that it feels like we've done as much. And like David said, we've had some big news. Fed going from crazy accommodative to now tightening a war. Some big things have happened and we've kind of digested that.
01:14:02.490 - 01:14:38.338, Speaker C: I don't know what else could come out that's crazier than that. Right? Like the Fed going from 40 years of cutting rates to five years or whatever of increasing is big news. And now that we've digested that, I think we have seen a base also. To the extent there's leverage in the system, it gets cleaned out after a down 50% move. So anybody that needs to sell has sold. And so I do think the low we had in February, I guess, is it, and it's time to get going. A couple of other points on the stability of crypto.
01:14:38.338 - 01:15:14.282, Speaker C: Anybody that's held bitcoin for just over three years has always made money and past doesn't guarantee to predict the future, but I'm willing to bet it'll keep going for a while. So crypto is less scary than people think. And, yeah, I really want to emphasize to your new investors out there, really just put as much in as you can. Hold down like 80% and still have your spouse like you is what you should put in crypto. And then just hold it, and it's going to go up. It's going to go down. But, yeah, you got to have like a five to ten year view, and you can't be like day trading.
01:15:14.426 - 01:15:41.126, Speaker A: You never want to be a forced seller, that's for sure. Okay, so we've talked about what's happening, and now we're just kind of concluding how to prepare. But it feels like, dan, the answer to this is definitely like, don't be buying bonds. Be worried about bonds. If you have those in your portfolio, be very worried. It sounds like you're actually doing some trading where I don't know if you're shorting bonds or sort of what. But then the other answer is buy crypto.
01:15:41.126 - 01:15:59.758, Speaker A: And so listeners are going to be like, oh, a crypto podcast. Telling you, crypto is a fantastic asset class. But honestly, Dan, is it really that simple? Is that what we should do to prepare? Again, none of this is financial advice, of course, but your perspective on this, is it really that simple?
01:15:59.924 - 01:16:06.260, Speaker B: Or ask, alternatively, is this what crypto has been preparing for its entire life?
01:16:07.270 - 01:16:51.902, Speaker C: Yeah. So here's one last little tip, in case anybody wants it. I did invest and buy an ETF called TBT that is two times short the 20 year bond market. And so if anybody actually does want to get short, that is a very convenient way to do it. So in the crypto market, yeah, it's a crypto podcast and I'm a crypto investor. So, yeah, buy crypto is what you would think somebody would say, and I want to put some perspective in that, is that I have been doing this for nine years, and there have been some kind of dangerous times to buy crypto and some great times to buy crypto. And so I would say there's way more the great time to buy crypto rather than a dangerous time.
01:16:51.902 - 01:17:39.806, Speaker C: And so some of the yardsticks I would use is, on average, crypto. I'll use bitcoin as a proxy for the industry, just because everybody knows those prices. On average, bitcoin has gone up ten x every two years for eleven years, right? So it has a log growth rate of 145% a year. So it goes up 2.5 x every year and goes up ten x every two years. So if you take that as kind of something that always, at least for a while, can keep happening, we are way behind that pace. And to put it in perspective is bitcoin is basically double where it was four and a half years ago, which rarely ever happens, where you can buy bitcoin at only twice where it was a long, long time ago.
01:17:39.806 - 01:18:20.454, Speaker C: And then the price of bitcoin today is about, I think it's 55% right now, cheap to that long term trend. And again, these are just yardsticks for value. It doesn't prove it's going to go up in the next 27 minutes or whatever, but it just feels like today is definitely not a stupid time to buy a crypto because it's relatively cheap. It's half of where it was a few months ago, which was right on its trend. So it feels like it's a better time than most. But again, I think people should be buying and holding and only putting in an amount they could afford to lose most of if it all goes sideways.
01:18:20.502 - 01:19:13.390, Speaker A: For a while, can I ask if you agree with this? Because I guess maybe crypto podcasts, we're talking about crypto and how it's an amazing asset class, right? But it's not like we've only been doing this for like two years. Okay. So I feel like the crypto community has largely called what is happening now for the last decade, at least, and you've been in this space for approaching a decade. I know you pivoted, Pantera. It was not a crypto fund, but you pivoted completely to crypto in 2013, I believe, because you were seeing what was happening, what was going to happen in the future. Now it's the 2020s where crypto people are calling for like, hey, this money printing is not going to end well, everyone. And it's not showing up in inflation, but we're seeing inflation in asset prices, and now we're showing inflation.
01:19:13.390 - 01:19:44.854, Speaker A: Maybe people wouldn't ever criticize the crypto community for being humble, but I think we can be confident about this, right? We've called it right for the past ten years, haven't we? And so it's not like a bunch of crypto guys who have no track record. Can you tell us a little bit about that, about the last ten years and kind of your calls and maybe back to your original decision of why you decided to pivot Pantera into crypto in the first place? Is this WHat YoU expected would know?
01:19:44.892 - 01:20:06.746, Speaker C: I have to say that as an industry, we should be proud of ourselves. It's pretty much what we were calling the whole time, and it keeps happening. And all the skeptics that are always like, saying that, the negative stuff, I'm just like, I don't know, I think I've seen this movie before. I think I know where it's going. ANd web3 is like the most obvious trait I've ever seen. It will definitely happen. There's no doubt.
01:20:06.746 - 01:20:50.266, Speaker C: And so my history was, prior to this, I was at Tiger management and focus on very asymmetric trades around the world, looking at interesting things. And like I said, I went to the Soviet Union in the early ninety s to invest in Gazprom and some other privatizations and things. And so every few years, a trade like that would come up. Argentine farmland or Middle east equities or whatever. And the key is always looking for trades where the upside's way more than the downside. And I just put in our last investor letter that the prior trade we did to bitcoin was investing in TESla Motors. I had had dinner with one of the founders of Tesla, and he told me about this electric car.
01:20:50.266 - 01:21:26.850, Speaker C: And I was so jazzed up about it because for a lot of reasons, I thought it'd be very successful. And then PAntera's chief economist is a guy named Ron GlAnce, and he was a partner of mine at Tiger, and he used to be the number one auto analyst in the United States. And so I got him to help me on it. He was super negative, and he was talking about all these Tesla fanboys and blah, blah, blah. Why? It's a dumb idea. And his line, which is pretty amazing, and it's true, he's like, hey, the last car company to go public is Ford Motor company. Oh, that's bad, right? All the other ones have gone bankrupt.
01:21:26.850 - 01:22:03.394, Speaker C: Every DeLorean and di Tomaso with their Pantera and all these guys have tried to build car companies, always failed. And so he was super negative. We did a ton of work on it, and I just came to the conclusion that the auto industry and even the dealership model, all that's just super crazy. How that's built in the future, obviously, is electric and solar and everything. So we did that trade. And the reason I mentioned is the cool irony is in the early part, we're all of 2013, both bitcoin and Tesla traded the same dollar price per share. So when bitcoin is $40 a share, Tesla is $40 when bitcoin is 90.
01:22:03.394 - 01:22:28.906, Speaker C: And so during that period, I was investigating bitcoin. My friends Pete Berger and Mike Novogradz at Fortress asked me to help him think about it. And I had a bit of knowledge because my brother, who's an aerospace engineer, he had gotten some free bitcoins from the bitcoin faucet, which your young viewers wouldn't understand this. They were giving away free bitcoins because nobody knew about it.
01:22:28.928 - 01:22:30.454, Speaker A: That's nobody. Airdrop.
01:22:30.582 - 01:22:47.566, Speaker C: They're doing the first airdrop now. So funny. And so he told me about it, and I kind of have a little bit of libertarian streak. So I read about it, and there wasn't much you could read, but I read about it. I was like, that'd be awesome. I hope it happens. But I didn't really do anything about it.
01:22:47.566 - 01:23:26.874, Speaker C: And then when Pete Mike asked me to help think about it, I came in for a coffee, and it lasted like 6 hours. I was like, oh, man, there's something huge going on. And it took about four or five months to know think it through. But I came to believe that it was going to be one of those asymmetric trades. Right? Obviously, a lot of ways it could go wrong, but if it worked, you could make not four or five times your money, but like ten times your money, maybe 100 times your money, or maybe 1000 times your money. And actually, that's the funny thing, is the first price forecast in our first memo was 1000 x. I thought it'd go to $5,000 per bitcoin.
01:23:26.874 - 01:24:06.410, Speaker C: And so it is fun to go back and read those old memos because they're still right. I did an interview with Bill Miller, famous value investor, and he was talking about how sometimes people say, hey, bitcoin's stupid. It's just like buying gold. And this was a line from that first memo nine years ago. No, it's like buying gold in 1000 BC is what it's like. Gold was great for a while, but now everybody has it, and still not that many people have bitcoin. So bitcoin is still early, and then it's going to transform almost everything.
01:24:06.410 - 01:24:44.040, Speaker C: There's some things that won't transform, but blockchain is going to transform most businesses, definitely. Everything financial is going to be done on some kind of blockchain. Voting rights, refugee aid. Just so many things are going to transition to a decentralized digital version that the upside is still just enormous. Although the industry has done well, it's still tiny compared to the rest of the world. DFI is great because it's at 250,000,000,000 now. There's 120,000,000,000,000 bonds, right? So there's 500 x to go.
01:24:44.040 - 01:25:12.302, Speaker C: And one of the cool ways to think about it is, like, new technologies don't just kind of replace the market cap of the previous thing. The value of Amazon is greater than the value of every little mom and pop bookstore in 1995. Right? So bitcoin, blockchain, DFI, still being one 500th of the bond market, it could easily do all that 500 x plus more or whatever. So that's why I'm still so bullish that it's still so early.
01:25:12.436 - 01:25:40.194, Speaker A: Can I ask you this? Because you probably hang out in these circles much more than David and myself and most bankless listeners. What about the institutional appetite? Are they finally understanding this? Are they starting to see crypto? What are the conversations that we never get to hear in these institutional corners where they're debating crypto and debating this asset class? Are they on board yet? Or they still think it's like drug money and the ponzi schemes?
01:25:40.322 - 01:26:08.334, Speaker C: Yeah. So that's a great question that people have been asking for a long time. The answer is, I think right now, it's changing. Like, literally right now. And if you think back in the early days, I went and pitched all the biggest endowments, and you'd get the CIO and, like, 20 people in a room, and you'd go in and you do the show. But in retrospect, it was total wasted time, right? Because there was only one fund manager in the industry. We only had one fund, and that fund only had one asset, bitcoin.
01:26:08.334 - 01:26:22.934, Speaker C: That is a terrible thing for an asset allocator, right? Like, putting all the downside on them. And I was honest at the time. I was like, hey, you could lose all your money, but you might make, like, 50 times your money, and that doesn't sell. That doesn't sell.
01:26:22.972 - 01:26:24.406, Speaker A: So no one took you up on that?
01:26:24.508 - 01:26:49.120, Speaker C: No endowment at all? Not at all. The funny thing is, it went up 600 x. Right. So it would have been an insane trade to put just a tiny, tiny fraction of their assets in there. But it's terrible from, like, a career management standpoint, because it could have gone to zero. And I was very frank that it could have. But the funny bit would be, you get kind of the end of the meeting, and you're feeling nothing happening.
01:26:49.120 - 01:27:41.946, Speaker C: Nobody's going to invest in your fund, but they're walking out to the elevator, and everybody's like, what's the minimum? Because they all want to invest personally, but there's no way they would put XYZ University's endowment in it. And so a lot of them did invest personally, and now many are invested professionally. But what I would say is, even up until a couple of years ago, there was a long list of fake reasons to not invest. Oh, didn't a silk or a guy use bitcoin or whatever? So there was a bunch of those. We did put a list last year and a letter of all the reasons that people used to say, no, there's no custodian, it's a fraud, all this stuff. And so, luckily, almost all those got crossed out. And really, the only one I would say left is regulatory risk.
01:27:41.946 - 01:28:21.206, Speaker C: And it's really almost uniquely the SEC in the United States. So there's only really one kind of unknowable anymore. And that, I think, is a small one. But the point of the story is there used to be, like, custody was a very obvious excuse or reason to not invest, but now we have fidelity and Coinbase and bitco and all these big custodians. So most of those have gone away. You still hear some of the kind of negative occasionally, people in my heart, I always think it's an excuse for why they're not yet long. I don't think it's a very deeply held intellectual belief.
01:28:21.206 - 01:28:35.650, Speaker C: And that's one thing for a challenge for your listeners, is if anybody knows of a well written paper that's negative on crypto, I would love to read it. And I'm not talking about, like, just Warren Buffett going, oh, it's rat poison or something. I'm talking about somebody who actually writes down a couple paragraphs.
01:28:36.630 - 01:28:44.242, Speaker A: I think that, look, that's a call that if there's a good negative crypto critic, we'd love to have them on the podcast as well.
01:28:44.376 - 01:28:53.398, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd like to hear that, because I'm drinking the Kool Aid, and I'd love to hear the other side. Right? Like, if a smart person wants to argue the other side, I'd love to hear it.
01:28:53.484 - 01:29:01.874, Speaker B: But the crypto bull case for that is anyone who can articulate a negative opinion or a negative case for crypto can't really do it because they just become bully owned.
01:29:01.922 - 01:29:03.222, Speaker C: Some. Yeah.
01:29:03.356 - 01:29:05.340, Speaker B: No, they just pill themselves.
01:29:07.230 - 01:29:44.566, Speaker C: I had a fun conversation with one of the rarest animals on earth, a person who's supposedly smart and negative on crypto. And there's only a handful out there. And this guy's a professor at Johns Hopkins, and it was on CNN back when you actually went to studios, and it was real. So on the way to the studio, I was reading one of his research pieces, and he said, bitcoin, the pets.com of our era. And I'm like, oh, that's hysterical. And so when we got on the show, I asked him a trivia question that almost nobody ever knows the answer to is, who's the dope? Who was the majority owner of pets.com,
01:29:44.566 - 01:30:17.630, Speaker C: the poster boy of terrible investments in the.com boom. Nobody ever knows that, but it's this guy who thought the Internet was going to be disruptive and that maybe beetle sell canned pet food on the Internet, which we all know that was a dumb idea. But books worked, and Jeff Bezos is doing fine, even though he was the owner of pets.com. And so, as I said to this guy, he's the last name, wadwani, that bitcoin, and all these cryptos are like that. It's like, I don't know. I wouldn't bet 100% of my life savings on one particular cryptocurrency.
01:30:17.630 - 01:30:44.666, Speaker C: You should own a basket of 30, 40 different really interesting projects. And if one goes to zero, that's going to happen, right? That's totally cool. But as long as you're in a basket of these really important protocols, you're going to do great. And so even a person who's supposedly smart and writing papers that's negative on crypto even got his whole model wrong. That it is like pets.com, you should be buying a bunch of different crypto protocols. And some are going to be very.
01:30:44.688 - 01:30:57.886, Speaker A: Important, by the way, is that your overall take, just like the easy button is sort of like a bitcoin eth and then an index of a bunch of other crypto assets is kind of the easy button portfolio. Or how would you describe an easy button portfolio for exposure here?
01:30:57.988 - 01:31:28.390, Speaker C: Yeah, unfortunately it's not as easy as it used to be. Really. It's the sad answer, if we wanted a quick answer, is obviously bitcoin is everything for a long time and it's great. Just tell people, buy some bitcoin. And then for a long time I was like, hey, buy half eth, half bitcoin, and you're going to be fine. The world's way more complicated than that now. And so the kind of theoretical answer, and obviously it's not super pragmatic for all your listeners, but is to be invested in a lot of different things.
01:31:28.390 - 01:32:19.766, Speaker C: And we probably invest in 200 different things across all of our funds. So that is the reality is that there are going to be probably ten or so really important layer one blockchains and then, as your listeners know, but the SEC chairman doesn't. All the other things are actually just kind of companies basically built on top of other protocols. And there is a great line that the chairman of the SEC said four or five months ago that we don't need 5000 new private monies and used some examples about the continental era of the US where we had different colonial dollars and then we got $1 and it was all great. And I think he and lots of people misunderstand it. There aren't 5000 layer one blockchains, right? Like, there just aren't. There's ten or so that are important.
01:32:19.766 - 01:33:03.574, Speaker C: And then almost all the rest of those are just protocol applications built on somebody else's protocol. And the US has 4500 public companies, so I have no problem with 4500 tokens. Right? We're not there yet. There aren't 4500 real tokens yet. But in ten years there will be. And so the punchline of all that is a portfolio should be many things more than just one or two things. And one of the things I think about when I talk to institutional investors is I sometimes find myself in these meetings where they just keep kind of drilling at like, but which protocol is going to be the winner and is it going to be polka dot is going to be ethereum? Just really just can't just accept that.
01:33:03.574 - 01:34:03.702, Speaker C: I actually don't know. There's a lot of interesting ones, right? There's going to be there. And the analog I try and use with them is like when they're interviewing an equity manager, they don't sit there and say, hey, I'm not going to invest a dime until you convince me which one company is going to take over the entire world, because that's how I want to invest in stocks, and that's not the way people should invest in crypto. It's like you invest in a portfolio and the manager buys a bunch of different things. And so the theoretical answer is to invest in a broad portfolio of things, because there are a lot of things going on. Like, for example, last year, bitcoin was up 70% and our liquid token fund was up 325%. There's just a lot of things going on, one of which is bitcoin, but there's 30 other important things in the liquid side, and there's 80 or whatever in the private token side of our portfolio.
01:34:03.702 - 01:34:29.858, Speaker C: So for those that can, investing in a fund manager like ourselves, there's a bunch of great managers in the space is probably now better than the old days. When I say, hey, just buy some bitcoin and eth, you're probably fine these days. I think you do need a broader exposure. There's a ticker, I think it's called DPI, that has the DFI, like ten top DFI. Something like that is a great way to get more than just one thing.
01:34:29.944 - 01:34:30.382, Speaker A: Totally.
01:34:30.446 - 01:34:39.394, Speaker C: Certainly, because you certainly hate to have gotten crypto right, invested some money. Crypto happens, and then you're in the Myspace of crypto or whatever.
01:34:39.432 - 01:34:40.654, Speaker A: Like pulse chain.
01:34:40.782 - 01:34:42.450, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Pulse chain.
01:34:42.890 - 01:35:17.730, Speaker B: Dan, we've been focusing this conversation generally, mostly from the outside, in, about crypto, the macro side of crypto, and then the broad strokes. But as we just wrap this up, and I want to ask you kind of just the internal side, what thematic themes are you paying attention to in the crypto industry moving forward in 2022 and beyond? What really captures your attention? Is it layer two ecosystem? Is it dows? Is it DFI? Is it the NFT side of things? What are this many, many themes that have emerged in the last twelve months or so that have really captivated your attention.
01:35:18.310 - 01:35:37.538, Speaker C: Yes, and that's why I'm so excited about crypto is there's so many super important things. Everything you mentioned there is something that is very important and that we're working hard on and investing in. And so although that sounds overwhelming, that's totally different than two years ago. Like, half the things you just mentioned didn't even exist two years ago.
01:35:37.644 - 01:35:38.198, Speaker B: Totally.
01:35:38.294 - 01:36:23.990, Speaker C: That's why I like crypto, that it's always changing. Definitely. Layer twos, roll ups, scalability is coming on now. There's a lot of projects like Arbitrum and Starquare that are really important and obviously have to happen. When there was only a couple of crypto enthusiasts using bitcoin or ethereum, it didn't matter that it only did ten transactions per second. But if a billion of us all want to do some video game and at the same time it's not going to work, right? So scaling is massively important. So for a long time we were pretty much focused on just two blockchains, three bitcoin eth, and then we're investors, equity investors in ripple.
01:36:23.990 - 01:37:05.894, Speaker C: So we were focused on those three and that kind of did cover it for a long time. But now there's a lot of interesting layer ones out there. Salana Terra near. There's a bunch of things out there that are important for their own use cases because there are different use cases now, not just storing digital gold. Right? Bitcoin is really good at that. The other one, honestly, I said this before, web3, it's the most obvious trade I've ever seen in my life. And we might mess up and invest in the wrong projects or whatever, but like ten years from now we are not going to have these big centralized data monopolies sucking all the value out of our lives, right? And the other thing they're not going to be doing is governing our lives.
01:37:05.894 - 01:37:58.798, Speaker C: That's so important. And I don't think probably people talk enough about it that there's a lot of bad stuff happens from these very centralized data monopolies that just won't happen in the long run. And again, it's going to take ten years or whatever. So web3, massively important. And I think probably it's going to have the biggest impact on our lives, right? Like kind of the number of people out there. And then NFTs is a fascinating sector, that a new art form is being created, just like each of the last 50 years has had its new art form and then the whole concept dows of letting people actually govern themselves is superior to the representative democracy and definitely superior to monarchies and dictators. Right? So I'm a huge fan of the Constitution Dao.
01:37:58.798 - 01:38:19.114, Speaker C: And people say, oh, it. I'm like, no, no, it was massively successful in the end. Ken Griffin had a few more dollars than they had, and so he won that particular bidding. But it took Ken Griffin 30 years to accumulate that money. It took the constitution down like a week. That's massive. And they went out with the best tweet ever.
01:38:19.114 - 01:39:10.390, Speaker C: Their last tweet was, how much for Citadel? And in my mind, that is such a great way to encapsulate how the world's changing. It's like we used to have centralized things, like citadel, which I have nothing against Ken Griffin, any of those people, but centralized things where one or two humans controls an enormous amount of power. And ten years from now, we're going to have entities that are. Democracy is going to control and the citizens are going to actually get to do things. I'm really excited about that. Another thing that I don't see people think enough about is Satoshi gifted to the world one of the most important things of all time? Right? Like, in 20 years, when we look back, it's going to blow people's minds that Satoshi just handed this thing no patents, didn't take any money. It's pretty wild.
01:39:10.390 - 01:39:24.080, Speaker C: And I think within five years, a billion people are using bitcoin or crypto and maybe even three years. Honestly, it's happening so fast. And that's really cool to be involved somewhere. It's going to touch a billion people's lives.
01:39:24.530 - 01:39:59.818, Speaker A: It is really cool. We are at, I think, the right place at the right time in history. And even though there's a bond bubble and a great unwinding ahead, I think with crypto, there's maybe a light at the end of the tunnel here and how a civilization and society reorganizes on the other side of this, and that's certainly reason for optimism. So, Dan, you've led us through some dark corners, some, I guess, obscure things that not a lot of people understand, and you've painted the picture of how to position ourselves through these to the other side. So thank you so much for joining us on bankless. We really appreciate it.
01:39:59.984 - 01:40:01.690, Speaker C: Hey, thanks. It's been a blast.
01:40:02.030 - 01:40:25.346, Speaker A: Bankless listeners, some action items for you today. One thing I recommend you subscribe to is Pantera's letter, their blockchain letter that they send out. We'll include a link to the show notes. Also, the latest letters from Dan has a hand in writing them himself. It's called the 70s is one of them. Includes some of the links to the charts that we talked about today, and also the next megatrade. So take a look at that.
01:40:25.346 - 01:40:42.822, Speaker A: Of course, as always, risks and disclaimers guys, none of this has been financial advice. It never is on bankless. Bitcoin eth are risky. So are the other crypto assets. You could definitely lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.
