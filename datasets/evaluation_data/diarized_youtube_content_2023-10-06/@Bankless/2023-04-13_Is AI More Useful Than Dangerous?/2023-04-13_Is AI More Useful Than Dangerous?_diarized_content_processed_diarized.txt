00:00:00.090 - 00:00:03.898, Speaker A: And do you think the web3 technologies really supercharge a creator's ability?
00:00:03.994 - 00:00:23.930, Speaker B: Web Three is the ultimate expression of this. You're aligning economic incentives, but also you're aligning ownership. It just gives you control over your own property, and you can maybe go to an alternate. The longer term expression of all of this is governance, which is how do you have a say? I want to pick a different path for this company. So I think web3 in some ways kind of the ultimate expression of the creator control journey.
