Smart contracts would never work. DFI is not a thing. Don't even talk about it now. Uniswap today. Okay? Tuesday, May 24, just hit over a trillion dollars in cumulative trading volume.
00:00:20.346 - 00:00:32.802, Speaker A: Okay? A trillion dollars. And so this is another, I guess, piece of evidence that we can add to to the list of people being wrong about technology and being wrong about the power of the open permissionless Internet.
00:00:32.866 - 00:00:47.410, Speaker B: I remember a lot of people saying, basically, you're never going to have a successful Dex until we have much more performed blockchains. And then, sure enough, I think it speaks to when you create permissionless systems with 8 billion people, interesting things happen, and smart people come up with things that might be unexpected.
