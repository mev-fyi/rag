00:00:00.330 - 00:00:12.750, Speaker A: Stablecoins are one of the $3 trillion narratives of crypto, and I think the $3 trillion narratives are bitcoin, eth and stablecoins.
00:00:15.250 - 00:00:43.366, Speaker B: Hey, bankless nation, we've got a fantastic episode for you today. This is the stablecoin wars. We're talking to Sam from Fracs, who is deep in the Stablecoin wars. He's one of them. You know, his framing is maybe not so much wars, but we're going to talk all about Algo stablecoins. We're going to talk about ust the four pool curve pool that was just launched, what all this means, how it turns into. Actually, we are pre recording this entire episode.
00:00:43.366 - 00:00:49.046, Speaker B: So we've already had our conversation with Sam, and it's a fantastic conversation. David, what were some of your takeaways?
00:00:49.158 - 00:01:28.214, Speaker C: Well, first off, Sam starts the conversation with a story about central banking, kind of a made up story, a parable, but really grounds, we like to say a number of times before in bankless, that crypto is just speedrunning the history of money and finance. And so Sam speedruns through the history of central bank management. Right. In a very fantastic story that really frames the whole rest of the conversation. And I had a fantastic time just sitting and listening to that story and had so much to learn just in that one story. And I kind of understood exactly how the rest of the conversation was going to unfold because of that story. So I'm excited for listeners to be able to, because that's where this conversation starts first.
00:01:28.214 - 00:01:38.278, Speaker C: But then we even get to lean into, again, the four pool, the USC, the Doquan spiciness, and how Frax has gotten caught up in the middle of this to Frax's benefit.
00:01:38.374 - 00:02:03.422, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm going to be honest, David, I walked away from this conversation really bullish on Frax. Like really actually excited. It's been a while since the project. It was just like, wow, this is really neat. And so we were in education mode that entire time, actually, like on the receiving end learning guys, we're going to get to that conversation. One quick announcement, though. We've been telling you for the last week or so about these Mac NFTs from consensus.
00:02:03.422 - 00:02:27.994, Speaker B: Keith Herring, NFTs. We're telling you that that would be released on April the 10th, which is national HIV, youth awareness, HIV and AIDS Awareness Day. Those NFTs have been released. Okay. A whole bunch of them are sold out. I managed to get my Keith Herring Red just now because I think the yellows are sold out, but the reds there are still some reds left. At least right now.
00:02:27.994 - 00:02:36.462, Speaker B: I minted this baby. You could pay in credit card, David, so I didn't have to spend any eth on this. What? No gas fees? Just paid with the credit card.
00:02:36.596 - 00:02:38.394, Speaker C: You bought one, you didn't have to spend any eth.
00:02:38.442 - 00:02:38.954, Speaker A: Yeah, dude.
00:02:39.002 - 00:02:57.810, Speaker B: So no gas fees and it's minted on polygon. So this is it. This is my openc account. It says the floor price is 179. Okay, but I'm sure there's no liquidity on this. These red you pay $25 for. And of course, all of the proceeds go to 100% of the revenue.
00:02:57.810 - 00:03:09.606, Speaker B: I should say go to support AIDS and HIV, youth affected by that disease. So super cool there. And there's still time.
00:03:09.708 - 00:03:24.186, Speaker C: There's 195 owners of it and there's 250 total left. So that is 55 of these ones left. And you say there's no liquidity on it, but that's because no one's buying $180 nft that they can go and buy for $150. Right? Yeah, that's no liquidity.
00:03:24.298 - 00:03:39.150, Speaker B: Well, there you go. So anyway, there's still an opportunity to do that. Just enter your email address. Again, no gas fees. So quick PSA there. That's the status. David, I want to ask you the question I ask you before all of these episodes, which is, what is the state of the nation?
00:03:39.310 - 00:03:57.480, Speaker C: Oh, the state of the nation. Today Ryan is learning. We are learning, we're learning every single bankless episode, but we're learning a lot. Sam had a lot to teach us. He's a great teacher, he's a great orator. And so I just felt like I was in the middle of both a history lesson and a lesson in finance and economics. And it's my favorite type of show.
00:03:57.480 - 00:04:04.746, Speaker C: I am not only learning, but also being entertained at the same time. And so the state of the nation today, Ryan is learning.
00:04:04.848 - 00:04:12.970, Speaker B: All right, great episode. Learn with us, guys, on the state of the nation. We'll be right back with Sam, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.

00:06:39.744 - 00:07:16.434, Speaker B: Bankless nation we are super excited to introduce our next guest, Sam Kazmian. He's the founder of Frax Finance. A lot of f's there. He previously got into crypto same way David Hoffman, my co host, did via GPU mining he also worked on the decentralized Wikipedia project Everpedia. But in 2019, he started this really interesting algorithmic hybrid stablecoin project called Frax Finance, which is the topic of today's show. Because we're going to talk about stablecoins, maybe some of the stablecoin wars that are going on, and what Sam thinks of the situation. Sam, welcome to bankless.
00:07:16.434 - 00:07:17.282, Speaker B: How are you doing?
00:07:17.436 - 00:07:28.678, Speaker A: I'm doing great. Thanks for having me. This is awesome. Huge listener and excited to be on, discuss everything. Stablecoins, crypto economics.
00:07:28.854 - 00:07:29.338, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:07:29.424 - 00:08:23.310, Speaker B: Well, we're going to get, I think, in the back half of this conversation to some of what people are calling the stablecoin wars with the introduction of this four pool on curve and sort of what that means. But I think we should start with maybe the top explaining fracs a little bit. But before we do, I want to talk, maybe get some context on why the stablecoins are in the focus of all of crypto right now. So there seems to be like this narrative of stablecoin wars and a lot of conversation around Ust these days and algorithmic stablecoins. This wasn't the case in 2019 when you started fracs, right? Like, stablecoins weren't as talked about and certainly algorithmic stablecoins weren't in the limelight. Why do you think everyone is having this conversation now? Sam?
00:08:23.730 - 00:08:59.346, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. That's a great question. So, like you said, I've been in the crypto space for a while, kind of like how David got into it. I got in around 2013, 2014 ish. I was at UCLA, a college student, and I started kind of just mining cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin was actually the first one I started mining. I still remember being like one of the first people to sign up for the ETH newsletter when it was announced in 2014 when Vitalik started talking about ETH.
00:08:59.346 - 00:09:58.490, Speaker A: And back then it was counterparty and colored coins were the thing, right, as you guys probably remember, and stablecoins were not even in the conceptual framework back then. Right. The earliest thing that's kind of, I think I like to call the stablecoin white paper is Robert, Sam's signer at shares white paper, which some people might have read. I actually like to call it like, it's one of the most kind of important pieces in stablecoin design because it introduced the two token system of, you have a stablecoin on a blockchain and then you have a share token, or like the volatile token that represents future cash flow or signage or whatever, and you could try to stabilize these things. And that was even before smart contracts came out. His thing, his white paper was about proof of work blockchain. You just have a proof of work blockchain and you have two tokens in it instead of one.
00:09:58.490 - 00:10:52.826, Speaker A: One volatile one. And so the industry has come a really long way, right? And just like how there's really important trends that grow exponentially, like DFI summer 2020, right? Like all of the yield, farming, DFI primitives and all these things, and then nfts. I think the next big thing is stablecoins. And the reason for that is, I think the infrastructure and the ability to launch your own stable asset is finally mature enough to have that kind of cambrian explosion, right? Like I actually like to kind of say there's like a WordPress of stable coins now, right? You could create your, you need like a deep curve pool or univ. Three pool or something, some really concentrated liquidity. You have to make sure to give enough yield there. And it's like a cookie cutter playbook now, right? The infrastructure is there.
00:10:52.826 - 00:11:16.466, Speaker A: Just like how the infrastructure for nfts with openc and minting and generative art and stuff was there. And then you have this kind of curve, right? We're at the point where you have the infrastructure to kind of cookie cutter stablecoins. So there's going to be a cambrian explosion of these kinds of things, I think, from now until the next twelve months, basically.
00:11:16.648 - 00:11:27.990, Speaker B: Do you think? We had a guest recently who said stablecoin is crypto's killer app. Would you go as far as to say that, like, stablecoin is the big thing that crypto is meant to deliver?
00:11:28.510 - 00:12:30.106, Speaker A: I think stablecoins are one of the $3 trillion narratives of crypto, and I think the $3 trillion narratives are bitcoin, Eth, and stablecoins. That's my view. And so that's why I got really interested in stablecoins. That's why I look at it from a historical point of view. Like the first stablecoin white paper, this and where Frax falls in line and maker and all these things, I try to actually almost study it like evolution, right? And I think it is a trillion dollar narrative. And so I actually am of the belief, like, for example, bitcoin is a different kind of asset and ETH is a different kind of asset and stablecoins are a different kind of asset. All three have such large potential that they're the three, in my opinion, multitrillion dollar narratives, the t size narratives of.
00:12:30.128 - 00:13:19.322, Speaker C: Crypto people have spent their entire careers focusing in on stablecoins. When there's so much to pay attention to in the crypto industry, sometimes people just get compelled by stablecoins, and that's just the thing that they are interested in. And inside of that algorithmic stablecoins have had their own very rich history in the crypto industry. There's plenty of history lessons to learn as algo stablecoins have tried to get out the door. There's the story of basis, then there's the exploding stablecoins of empty set dollar and dynamic set dollar. And it really took a while for the algo stablecoins to really get their engine revving. I think FraCs being one of the first models of the stablecoins that the kind of algorithmic stablecoins that really started to work and then ust being the second one.
00:13:19.322 - 00:13:48.150, Speaker C: But correct me if I'm wrong, Sam, but we've never seen a pure algo stablecoin actually work. Frax has algorithmic components, UST has algorithmic components, but they all step away from the purely algorithmic stablecoin model. And I'm wondering if you think that the algo stablecoin model is actually impossible just based on perhaps some of the design decisions that goes into algo stablecoins. Do you think it's at all possible to produce a purely algorithmic stablecoin?
00:13:48.810 - 00:14:31.778, Speaker A: That's a good question. In fact, I think a short story about central banking is a good way to frame this conversation. And I actually got this short story from JP Koning blog, who's like a money blogger, but basically this should kind of answer your question. This is like a short story about a central bank. So it goes like this. At the beginning, there's a central bank, and they issue pieces of paper that say 1oz of gold on them, right? And everyone's familiar with this, right? And every single day there's a redemption window at the central bank, physically, and people are able to come and give their pieces of paper to the central bank and get an ounce of gold for each one. Okay.
00:14:31.778 - 00:15:09.402, Speaker A: And the next part of the story goes that central bank says that, hey, there's a two month renovation at the central bank, and so we have to close the redemption window. But the gold is all there. For every one piece of paper that says an ounce of gold, there's an ounce of gold at the central bank. But we're closing redemptions for two months because the central bank has renovations and it's going to open after two months. After two months, the central bank officials come and say, okay, actually, the renovations are taking much longer than we thought. It's going to take six months more. And the central bank is still closed.
00:15:09.402 - 00:16:02.542, Speaker A: But we can't just have these piece of paper that say they have 1oz of gold written on them, not trade for an ounce of gold, right? Especially because there haven't been redemptions for two months. So what we're going to do is every day the central bank officials are going to go in the central bank, grab some of the gold, go out into the trading markets and buy and sell the pieces of paper for an ounce of gold from the gold that they take out of the central bank. Aka, they're going to provide liquidity at the exchange rate of these pieces of paper. And every day they're going to go back and get more gold if they need to, or they're going to buy more of the piece of paper for an ounce of gold to make sure that the exchange rate of the pieces of paper that say an ounce of gold stay there. But no redemptions, right? The central bank is under construction. No redemptions, no one to one getting from the central bank. But the gold is still there.
00:16:02.542 - 00:16:48.270, Speaker A: It's all one to one, backed by gold. Okay, so after the six months of the renovation turnaround, and six months later, the central bank comes out and says, okay, look, there's actually not one to one gold in the central bank. We actually lent it out during construction and sold some of it. But we have assets. We've sold it out for loans, bonds and these things. We have some gold, which is what we were continuing to go every day and market make the pieces of paper so that they are always worth an ounce of gold per piece of paper. But we don't have 1oz of gold for every single piece of paper in the open market.
00:16:48.270 - 00:17:10.066, Speaker A: So construction is done, but no more redemptions. There's no more redemption window. No one can come to the central bank and actually ask to be redeemed for. But we will keep doing the thing we're doing where we take some of the gold we have and we're going to go buy and sell pieces of paper for an ounce of gold. We have a commitment. We're a central bank. We're the largest market player in the entire economy.
00:17:10.066 - 00:17:50.018, Speaker A: We will make sure those pieces of paper trade at an exchange rate of an ounce of gold per piece of paper. And so after a while, the final part of this story. One thing I actually want to say here is the gold standard that everyone talks about. Like 1972, when Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard. The gold standard everyone really likes. Is this part of the story right now where you can't redeem dollars for the actual backing because there isn't one to one at Fort Knox, there isn't enough gold ever. Right.
00:17:50.018 - 00:18:31.038, Speaker A: But the government has a complete duty to maintain the exchange rate of the piece of paper as best they can. Right. So where does our story end? The final part is after a while, the central bank says, okay, look, it's really hard to keep these pieces of paper that say an ounce of gold pegged at an exchange rate of an ounce of gold with very little gold. We sold most of the gold. We have a bunch of loans that are making money, but that's not gold. Right. The prices of those things change and stuff.
00:18:31.038 - 00:19:24.834, Speaker A: So what we're going to do is forget that 1oz of gold per piece of paper we were no longer going to market make at that price and guarantee that what we're going to do is that we realize that an industrialized economy, the most important thing is not that our pieces of paper are pegged to an ounce of gold. What we have to make sure to do is the people that are getting paid in these pieces of paper, we need to make sure what is the most important thing in an industrialized economy that people need, such as food, such as rent, medical care, cars, electronics. Just good consumer items. Right. Things that keep your standard of living the same. You need to be able to afford medical care, rent, all of this stuff. And what we're going to actually do is we're going to compile all the prices of those things against this piece of paper.
00:19:24.834 - 00:20:08.734, Speaker A: And if the price of those things are going up, right, then what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to buy some of the piece of paper back with the assets that we have, which is very little gold, but a bunch of other stuff. Right. And if the economy is becoming more and more productive, so more food is being produced and more cars and all these things, and the prices of those things are going down. Actually what we'll do is we'll just print more pieces of paper to make sure the price actually stays the same. Right. And so we'll buy more balance sheet assets, forget the gold exchange rate. Right.
00:20:08.734 - 00:20:42.458, Speaker A: And that's what happened after 1972. Right. And I wanted to tell this story to actually frame this full conversation about stablecoins, because obviously this is actually the full, true story of central banking evolution. Right. You start with one to one redemption, and then you stop the redemption. You say, you can't actually come to the central bank and get stuff from us. And then that's when the central bank can be like, we can sell some of it, right? There's no longer need one to one.
00:20:42.458 - 00:21:47.246, Speaker A: We can invest it in stuff and make money, but we have to make sure we have some to market make and make sure the exchange rate is always the same thing we want. And then you start realizing, or the government starts realizing, like, holy crap, it's really hard to keep the peg of something when you don't have a lot of that thing, right? And then they're like, it's actually much better to just peg to a consumer basket of items. And that does actually have obviously certain advantages. Right? But back to the stablecoin question. The reason I wanted to say this is that every financial thing, including stablecoins, evolves somewhat similarly and has properties of these things. You look at, for example, tether, right? Tether started out as saying, look, we have pieces of paper. They're called USDT tokens, and each of them have $1 behind them, right? After a while, tether was like, okay, actually you can't redeem them anymore because you just promise that we will keep the exchange rate the same, but you can't redeem them from us.
00:21:47.246 - 00:23:09.542, Speaker A: Only some people can or whatever. And then after a while they're like, actually, we don't have one to $1 for the pieces of paper, our USDT tokens, right? It all looks the same. And obviously there's laws that are passed as a society where people are like, look, if you issue a piece of paper that say there's something behind them, right, you need at least 10% of that thing at least, right? Otherwise you're committing a crime, right, as called reserve requirements, right? And so back to your question. I think it's interesting because at first people thought that you could have algorithmic stablecoins with absolutely no anything, right? The equivalent of this would be the central bank with zero gold, with them saying the pieces of paper have to have 1oz of gold exchange rate. That's not going to happen, right? So the answer to that, I think, is no. Unless there's a lot of market making going on. So someone's got to pay for it, right? And so that's actually where Frax falls in line here is like, we like to call ourselves the inventor of the fractional stablecoin, right? And the thing is, Frax is named after that.
00:23:09.542 - 00:23:57.160, Speaker A: The name is a portmanto of the word fractional and algorithmic, right? And the idea behind it is it actually sits right in the kind of second to last point, which is you can have a fractional banking system that works pretty well. Obviously, there's constraints, right? If you don't have enough of the thing, things start to fall apart, right? But most of our financial system revolves around the fact that if you keep a currency stable, you need some of it, right? You need some of the gold. If you're pegging to gold, you need something very similar to dollar equivalents if you are pegging to a dollar. But you can have an algorithmic supply or expansion, contraction kind of thing. And that's what Frax did. Frax actually invented that before Frax. No one else was talking about that.
00:23:57.160 - 00:24:29.538, Speaker A: And I think if there's one thing in terms of crypto economic design that we're hopefully going to be known for, is that we invented the fractional algorithmic design. And one thing is that we've never broken our peg. And our definition of the peg is each side. So, 1.1 and 99, $0.00. And we only look at on chain stuff because all of our liquidity is on chain. So, like, centralized exchanges can trade whatever they want.
00:24:29.538 - 00:24:46.630, Speaker A: But on uniswap on curve, which we're the largest pool, on uniswap, we're number five or six. We have never broken our peg, and we have billions of dollars of liquidity on chain. So that's one thing we're very proud of that we've designed. So that's kind of where Frax falls along.
00:24:46.700 - 00:24:54.826, Speaker B: Sam, I think we want to get into the design of fracs a little bit more. But that was a really interesting story, and I think for a lot of.
00:24:54.848 - 00:24:58.410, Speaker C: People, I really enjoyed that. That was lovely.
00:24:58.990 - 00:25:37.398, Speaker B: JP coning, by the way, is really fantastic on this space. Interesting. Sometimes JP coning is crypto skeptical, which I actually enjoy as well. But the story also reminded me of this chart from Ray Dalio. I don't know, Sam, if you've ever seen this, right? It's like, he's like the macro cycles of money, where you start with the hard money, like metal coins, and then society inevitably goes to claims on hard money. So from type one, hard money, to type two, claims on hard money, which is banknotes, and then you get to type three, which is fiat money, just the US dollar today, where it's not really backed by any claim on hard money. It's certainly not hard money.
00:25:37.398 - 00:26:15.426, Speaker B: And it strikes me, in crypto, we have all three of these experiments kind of brewing at the same time. We have the hard money, which would be the first two pillars of trillion dollar use cases, you might say, which is the bitcoin and eth. And there are maybe some other examples in crypto of hard money. And then you've got the claims on hard money, and then you've got, like, fiat money. And I'm wondering what Fracs is in this. Is it sort of a type two claim on hard money, would you say? It's certainly not full type three fiat money, where it's more kind of algorithmic? Is it something more like a claim on hard money?
00:26:15.528 - 00:27:28.746, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is actually a great thing as well. The cool part about the story, like you're saying, is we can actually ask that question, right? Like, where in the story that we just talked about does fiat money come into play? Is it where you can no longer redeem the pieces of paper that, say, an ounce of gold for gold from the issuing entity? Or is it when the issuing entity says that they no longer have one to one behind it, but they'll do everything they can with the assets that they have to maintain the exchange rates in the open market? Is that where fiat money is? Or I think personally, from the question, I think it's when you, as, like a government, say, okay, we're no longer maintaining even an exchange rate to something that's hard. Right. Something that is something like gold and doing something like the basket of consumer goods. Because when people talk about the gold standard, right, when Nixon took us off and stuff, the US government did not have enough gold for the circulating supply of the money stock. Right.
00:27:28.746 - 00:27:56.600, Speaker A: The monetary base. And so the way they were doing it is they're just stabilizing the exchange rate. Right. And I think that right now, most people would think that fiat money is when you just completely float against an exchange rate of any hard asset. Right. And so that's interesting because, as you guys probably know, and we'll talk about Frax is a two stable coin system, right. There's the fRAcs price index that we actually released last week.
00:27:56.600 - 00:28:10.490, Speaker A: But I think that fracs basically right now is partial claims on hard money. Right. Because we have hard assets. Right. And we try to keep an exchange rate to the dollar.
00:28:11.230 - 00:28:45.006, Speaker B: Can we actually look at this? I know David wants to get to more talk about stablecoins in general. More triangles, more trilemmas ahead of us, but just really quick so we understand. So I'm pulling up app Fracs finance. This is sort of a chart of Fracs and FXS and a few other things, wondering if you could just kind of decompose us a little bit. So we see here fraCs, we see this number, market cap of $2.6 billion. We see this other number over here of 85% collateralization ratio.
00:28:45.006 - 00:29:00.662, Speaker B: We also see this other asset called FXS, which is a 1.8 billion market cap. Can you explain some of the things that we're seeing on the dashboard so that folks can understand fracs with the numbers and what it's actually composed of?
00:29:00.796 - 00:29:24.250, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So Fracs launched with just two tokens, Fracs and FXS, all the way until last week, actually, when we launched the Frax price index, stablecoin. So Frax is just the dollar, stablecoin. Each Frax is $1. Super simple. Price is great. Frax shares is the governance token of the Frax ecosystem.
00:29:24.250 - 00:30:05.262, Speaker A: And it's actually named after the Robert Sam's white paper that I think is his historical one, because it's called signerid shares. We named this Frac shares. And so that's just the governance token. The collateral ratio there is actually the hard assets that are in the reserve or in the smart contracts. In the series of system smart contracts, we started out 100%, as you can see, and then quickly kind of stabilized or kind of moved around between 90 to 80. And those are the hard assets that the protocol can lay claims to. A lot of them are curve lp tokens, as you can see right under the value there.
00:30:05.262 - 00:30:51.310, Speaker A: A lot of them are collateral from lending operations, which we call Amos, algorithmic market operations. Those are just very similar to Makerdao, right? You have a bunch of fracs that you can borrow, and you collateralize it with over. Collateralize it with Eth or everything else. Right? So that's kind of like the Makerdao dai kind of system. The algorithmic section is the section that is kind of. The supply is expanded and contracted based on minting or burning Frac share tokens. Right? Like the actual governance token, some people like to call it fracs is 100% collateralized, but there's just some of it that's collateralized by its own governance token.
00:30:51.310 - 00:31:13.694, Speaker A: It's not just semantic, but I think it's important to think about. I would never say something is necessarily backed by itself, because you can't say the dollar is collateralized by other dollars at the Federal Reserve. I don't know, it seems a little nonsensical.
00:31:13.822 - 00:31:22.360, Speaker B: Help us understand that again. So these curve Amos, these are curve LP tokens, right? So these would be composed of other stablecoins, basically.
00:31:22.810 - 00:31:25.574, Speaker C: Basically it's a yield bearing stablecoin position, right?
00:31:25.692 - 00:31:26.630, Speaker A: Yes, exactly.
00:31:26.780 - 00:31:31.418, Speaker B: So dai, USDC, tether, that sort of thing.
00:31:31.504 - 00:31:33.382, Speaker C: Plus trading fees and curve.
00:31:33.526 - 00:31:37.686, Speaker A: Exactly. And CRV emissions and CVX emissions.
00:31:37.798 - 00:31:42.634, Speaker B: Got it. And this liquidity Amos, you said that was more like maker Dow collaterals.
00:31:42.762 - 00:31:54.290, Speaker A: Those are like protocol and liquidity. So we have some eth as collateral that we don't keep idle. In a smart contract, we actually deploy in uniswap pair or other places.
00:31:54.630 - 00:31:57.502, Speaker C: Dive uniswap V three LP positions.
00:31:57.646 - 00:32:23.066, Speaker A: Exactly. So there's a lot of protocol owned liquidity just outside of curve. And we're on many chains. So a lot of these are actually on different chains that are like natively protocol owned liquidity fraxes, mintable and issued on twelve different chains, a lot of them EVM and l two s. Like arbitrum, optimism, polygon, moonbeam, phantom, all of these things. So a lot of that is on those other chains as well. Cool.
00:32:23.088 - 00:32:27.770, Speaker B: And this algorithmic section, which is about like, I don't know, 15% or so, is that about right?
00:32:27.840 - 00:32:29.002, Speaker C: That's the unbacked side.
00:32:29.056 - 00:32:56.882, Speaker B: That's the unbacked side. Or it's backed by the value of fxs, which is basically the fracs governance token. Now, if you were to contrast this with, like, UST, for example, UST would be like almost entirely this algorithmic type section, which is like all kind of luna tokens, aside from maybe you might start to count the bitcoin reserves that the LFG group purchased recently.
00:32:57.026 - 00:32:59.350, Speaker C: Is that the contrast off chain LFG group?
00:32:59.420 - 00:33:00.134, Speaker B: Yes.
00:33:00.332 - 00:33:40.334, Speaker A: Yeah, I would say that that's correct. In fact, I think a lot of stablecoin projects, especially terra, which is like the largest decentralized one currently, are seeing there's a lot of important strengths to the fractional model, right? So, yeah, I think that basically before the bitcoin announcement, if you were to make this chart with Terra, most of it would be black, right? Most of it would be algorithmic, right? And now there would be a big slice. I'm not actually exactly sure. I think it's like anywhere between ten to 30% or something like that would be bitcoin, right? There would be a slice of bitcoin.
00:33:40.382 - 00:33:53.960, Speaker B: It's funny because we see ust moving in your direction, they're moving more in the fractionalized direction and less algorithmic. So it's almost like, I don't know if frax is moving more algorithmic, but they're certainly coming more towards your.
00:33:55.770 - 00:35:08.910, Speaker A: So, like I said, our name is literally after the fractional stuff we invented. But I don't really even think we own the idea or anything. I think what's interesting is, like I said, financial evolution has the same kind of evolutionary pressures. It's just economic, right? So as things progress in an economy, they start looking the same in terms of what the kind of right answer is in terms of efficiency and kind of like how everything will work. I think most things will look a lot like this. The only difference is what collateral ratio they'll keep stuff at, right? And in fact, you could argue that makerdao, for example, is not algorithmic, it's over collateralized. But the other way that I like to compare Makerdao actually, is that going back to our kind of central bank story, right? Makerdao started with a very fundamentally sound thing, right? They were like, we're going to issue pieces of paper that say a dollar, but we can't actually hold dollars, right? So what we're going to do is we're going to back the pieces of paper with like $2 worth of other stuff.
00:35:08.910 - 00:37:22.938, Speaker A: For every one dollars that we have piece of paper that needs to be a dollar, we're going to have $2 of other things, right? Or like a loan on $2. Basically, after a while, again, everyone, whether you come from the algorithmic side of like 0% or the maker dow side of over collateralized, the theme here is you start realizing it's extremely difficult to issue pieces of paper that have an exchange rate for something without holding a substantial amount of that thing, right? And so that is part of the reason why the closest thing to dollars, USDC, both maker has exposure to it and as do we, right? You can look, and there's curve lp tokens in this stat. And so for example, even Terra, right? Like Terra works with jump and all of the largest market makers, right? If you don't have the actual asset in your central bank inside of the building or whatever, you have to at least pay someone that does to go out into the market and make sure that the unit is trading at that amount, right? And so it's like jump is absolutely massive, right? They're absolutely huge. If you recall the wormhole, the unfortunate, which was really unfortunate, I was saddened to see that. But the wormhole hack of like, what was it, 300 million or something, east jump was like, all right, no problem, here's 300 million, let's make everyone whole, which was great and respectable. The same place where all that money comes from is also the same place that market makes the biggest of stablecoin markets, right? And so the thing is, if you want to actually autonomously and internally be a central bank, which I think Terra is going to be the biggest and most impressive one with fracs. And probably, you know, these are the big three right? Now, you need to actually have stuff to go out and do that, right? You need to have the actual assets, the hard assets, rather than having other people kind of do it.
00:37:22.938 - 00:37:35.466, Speaker A: And I think that's where the evolution of this stuff is going. Right, where that's what we're seeing, honestly, both with maker, with frax, with Terra, with everyone. Right? And that's the honest truth, Sam.
00:37:35.498 - 00:38:06.310, Speaker C: So there's a bunch of different collaterals in the fracs reserves, right? And this is the ammo that Frax has to defend the peg. Right? Going back to your story about the credit window, right, where I've got my frax tokens and I go to the Frax decentral bank on Ethereum and I say, hey, I would like some assets. Do I get to pick which of the assets I redeem for, or how does the peg get defended? When I come and come with my stable coins of frax tokens and I would like to redeem them, how does that work?
00:38:06.460 - 00:38:48.550, Speaker A: Yeah, when the redemption window is open, which is like, if the peg is even one third of a cent off. So like literally zero point 33 of actually go and redeem them on the redemption tab. And what it is is that you get a mixture of assets. Like you could see here if it was open. You get USDC and FXS minted to you at the ratio of the collateral ratio, so that there's never, like no reserves, even if you're the last 5% to redeem. Obviously. The thing is, everyone gets a piece of the fxs, which they sell, right, which might have like, negative price action and things like that.
00:38:48.550 - 00:40:06.606, Speaker A: But the idea behind the way we've done redemptions is everyone gets a ratio of the balance sheet, right? And so it actually is an anti kind of bank run mechanism in the sense that it's not that the first redeemers get one USDC per frax or $1 worth of assets, and then the last get all of the governance token. That's like plummeting. It's actually equal. It's egalitarian. And so the collateral ratio also, as you could see, is dynamic, right? So the collateral ratio has moved up and down across all the times that we've launched, and the collateral ratio will go up during times of market turbulence and volatility, so that we give back a higher ratio of assets and it'll actually sell fxs to stabilize at that collateral ratio, even if there's no redemption, even if no one's actually dreaming to make sure there's actually that much assets if the collateral ratio is at 90%. Right. So it's actually been a very good at dampening what people like to call the reflexive bank run spiral, since we've never had one.
00:40:06.606 - 00:40:06.926, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:06.948 - 00:40:12.346, Speaker C: Yeah, that was one of my questions. Is there risk of people running for the door?
00:40:12.378 - 00:40:12.574, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:12.612 - 00:40:49.370, Speaker C: And this was a conversation that we had in our UST episode, where people are fearful that if there ever is a lack of confidence in UST, there would be a rush for the door. And if you are unfortunately later to get through the door, you end up holding these tokens that don't have any collateral in the reserves. But what you're doing with fracs is saying, well, it doesn't matter if you're first through the door, you get a pro rada share of what you are owed, which disincentivizes going in through the door in the first place. So kind of instilling confidence in the value that you would get in the first place. Kind of disincentivizing the actual run on the bank.
00:40:50.030 - 00:41:14.238, Speaker A: That's exactly correct. And not only that, but if there's times where there's a lot of redemptions happening, or if the peg is even off by a third of collateral ratio will go up. Right. And so, like, the actual amount of hard assets and the share token you're getting is actually going up, you're getting more hard assets. So it's like an anti bank run mechanism.
00:41:14.334 - 00:41:38.138, Speaker B: And all of these assets here, are these all like sort of on chain, or does some off chain entity have to maintain custody of some of these were we're talking about UST, and the LFG group actually has to maintain custody of bitcoin. It's not like on chain. It's not kind of smart contract backed. Is this all on chain, or is.
00:41:38.144 - 00:42:00.306, Speaker A: There a portion that's not entirely on chain? In fact, we take an extremely decentralized and autonomous kind of approach. There's no actual legal entity. Right. Because there's amazing off chain. Yeah, there's no off chain assets. Everything you see here is not only on chain, but also readily available. Right.
00:42:00.306 - 00:42:19.318, Speaker A: It's not like, oh, there is some assets here, they're on chain, but they're over there, and we'll go get them or something. It's entirely on the system. Smart contracts. It's entirely, readily available in terms of. You can actually go see exactly. In real time, literally per block, where everything is where you can.
00:42:19.404 - 00:42:20.220, Speaker B: It's amazing.
00:42:20.910 - 00:42:24.220, Speaker C: It's crazy you even have to ask that question, Ryan, why?
00:42:25.470 - 00:43:08.566, Speaker B: The reason I have to ask it is because UST doesn't have it on chain. Well, so what's interesting about this? So Dave and I just finished up last week, we did UST episode, just unpacking that and learning all about it. It was a pretty good episode, but there was kind of the contrast point of sort of the dichotomy behind, like a maker Dao type design, a maker design, and a UST design. I guess I walked out of that episode seeing the trade offs on both sides, right? So one of the strengths of maker is it's far less prone to these tail risk type of events and deepgging in a catastrophe, a run on the bank, because it's collateralized, right?
00:43:08.588 - 00:43:20.450, Speaker C: So it's more safe for illustration, the collateralization ratio that we see, the 85%, which is very strong for an algo stablecoin maker dow, is something like 250%. So very safe.
00:43:20.630 - 00:43:49.826, Speaker B: Right? And so it's got safety. But the maker bear, and I guess the UST bull was saying, yeah, cool, it's safe. Good job, bro. But it's not scalable. It's not scalable at all, right? And so they're saying the UST design, look how fast this thing got to $16 billion. And it's because of this kind of memetic utility demand sort of aspect. And the UST bear was saying, yeah, cool, but hold on, that's not safe.
00:43:49.826 - 00:44:31.602, Speaker B: And it hasn't actually been tested. What's interesting about the fracs design is it sort of maybe takes the best of both worlds, or takes a little bit of column, a little bit of column b, and it says, hey, we want to bring some of the scalability of an algo stablecoin design model without having the tail risk event of it being fully uncollateralized and there being a run on the bank that could absolutely wreck this thing. I'm wondering if that is sort of the trade off space. So is frax more scalable than something like maker and likely a little less safe, but maybe acceptable risk parameters. But tell me about the scalability profile of something like fracs. Can it scale in the way that a UST can?
00:44:31.736 - 00:44:47.174, Speaker A: Yeah, I thought that episode was great, by the way. I think that everyone was too polite against each other. I was like, well, I think that this is a great point, but I was like, where's the animosity you see on crypto oh, my God.
00:44:47.212 - 00:44:52.250, Speaker B: People thought we were terrible. Like Eth Maxis asking even the questions we asked.
00:44:52.320 - 00:44:53.018, Speaker C: That was just.
00:44:53.104 - 00:45:01.680, Speaker A: No, it was actually very polite, in my opinion, for everyone. I thought it was great.
00:45:03.650 - 00:45:04.922, Speaker B: What about the scalability?
00:45:05.066 - 00:45:43.690, Speaker A: Yeah, so, like you said earlier, I think a lot of these stable coins will probably look something like fractional, algorithmic, like Frax's model. The question will be like, what collateral ratio? Right? Is it something that's very conservative, fractional, like Frax? Like 85, 80? Like right now, Terra is moving upwards a little bit. I think there's ten to 20% BTC. I don't know. They're increasing it, that's for sure. Right. But I think it just depends on the actual protocol's aggressive growth strategy right now.
00:45:43.690 - 00:46:47.242, Speaker A: One thing I will say is that people focus too much on the actual collateral ratio and less on the actual ability to keep the exchange rate of the thing at the actual desired peg. Right. Going back to our story about the 1oz of gold per piece of paper, it's really hard. It's really hard. And let's be real, both fracs right now and maker Fracs has less, but still they have exposure to USDC, right? And so maker has like, what, 60 something, 60%, 57 or something like that. It depends on how much leverage for ETH there is in terms of that. But the reason that's there is because it's really hard to keep an exchange rate to a dollar, even if you have $2 of other stuff or $2 worth of loans.
00:46:47.242 - 00:47:28.602, Speaker A: And you can't actually still keep an exchange rate without having some of that thing, and no one's been able to fully exactly figure it out. Now, I will give really big props to Terra's guys, and they're really smart and they're really good at strategy and getting Terra adoption. The thing is, they obviously have a lot of market making activity from people that have a huge interest in UST working out. Right? They have billions of. The people have billions of dollars of Luna, right. Luna is like the number seven largest cryptocurrency. Right.
00:47:28.602 - 00:48:28.350, Speaker A: It's absolutely massive. Right. And so when you have a lot of other people that have billions of dollars of dollars, and they have a huge interest in making sure to buy and sell the stablecoin at that peg, then it becomes a little bit easier. Right? But when, for example, Frax and Maker, what you see on the chain is what you get. There's no market maker. None that we've ever talked to or that I'm aware of that for the goodness of their heart is like deciding to keep fracs at a dollar peg. And so what you notice is the two stablecoins that have every single thing on chain, they do have some USDC exposure, right? Again, it's very difficult to keep a piece of paper that says 1oz of gold trading at an ounce of gold if you don't have a bunch of gold, like a lot of the gold itself.
00:48:28.350 - 00:49:11.754, Speaker A: Right. But we actually are doing a lot of stuff to lower USDC exposure. In fact, don't quote me on it right now on the spot, but I'm pretty sure if you actually do the calculation going down underneath. Again, don't quote me on it now, but I think we have significantly less USDC exposure than Dai currently does. I think we have like 40 something or low forty s in terms of actually USDC and tether exposure. When you check the actual lending amounts, the algorithmic amounts, the curve pool, which some of it is dai itself as well. Right? So like Dai underneath it is half or 50 60% USDC.
00:49:11.754 - 00:49:33.858, Speaker A: But when you go through it, we've actually done a fairly good job of being entirely decentralized and consistently weaning off as much as we can. Fiat coins. Right. USDC and tether, while making sure everything is on chain. Everything is what you see is what you get, which is an extremely difficult thing to do.
00:49:33.944 - 00:49:37.730, Speaker C: This is really cool decentralization. Maxi and me likes the on chain words.
00:49:37.880 - 00:50:11.966, Speaker B: Yeah, same here. I might be getting Frax pilled right now. It's really cool. I want to just draw our attention to this chart really quick because you said there were three elgo stablecoin designs and we're looking at them here. For people we're seeing on YouTube, this is ust in proportion. Looks like a market cap of about $18 billion. So the largest now, and Dai is kind of second, if you sort of count Dai as an algorithmic stablecoin, right? Maybe it's a d five stablecoin, as some people would say, 9 billion die and then fracs up here is about $2.7
00:50:11.966 - 00:50:25.620, Speaker B: billion worth. But there's also mim here, which I didn't realize that has gone up as well. This is a 2.7 billion. Can you tell us a little bit about Mim? Is that Danny Sesta's project?
00:50:26.390 - 00:50:56.462, Speaker A: Yeah, Mim. I think it's an over collateralized model, actually. And this kind of goes back to what we might talk about with stablecoin drama or news and stuff, but we love everyone. We tried to work with mim a while ago. And they weren't really that interested. And then, I don't know, they had the weird sifu episode or whatever. And I think their liquidity is kind of a little bit weird these days.
00:50:56.462 - 00:51:15.006, Speaker A: But it is an over collateralized model. It is fairly large. I think that part of the thing is it's used for a lot of Degen leverage. Right. And so this is actually a good example of like, you can be over collateralized. I believe Mim is significantly over 100% at least. Right.
00:51:15.006 - 00:51:55.746, Speaker A: But it doesn't mean that it's not risky. Right. So that's actually a really good counterexample of just looking at the CR of how much of this thing is immediately redeemable for hard assets. Like if there was like a redemption window or something. Doesn't actually give you a very good picture of the full risk because the risk is an entirely summation of all of the possible market activity. Right. And so for example, I think actually, to be honest, obviously I think fracs is as safe as dai, right? I really do.
00:51:55.746 - 00:53:01.206, Speaker A: In fact, I think Dai is extremely safe. I actually think that, to be honest, I think UST is way more safe than people think. And hopefully people don't think I'm saying that because we had the four pool partnership and stuff, because there's a lot of people that have a very strong interest in the UST peg, right? And so even though that's a very difficult thing to measure, it's difficult to model because it's hard to actually quantify. It's much safer than what people think about, like there's nothing here other than the governance tokens, volatility. If that were the actual truth, right? If that was the entire picture, there would be way more times that the UStpeC, something that big, would have collapsed in all of these crazy downturn markets whenever we wake up one of those days. And then crypto markets like negative 30, right? And everyone's like, oh my God. Right.
00:53:01.206 - 00:53:16.982, Speaker A: It would have happened way more than that, right? So I actually think the big three, and I like to call the big three, is like UST fracs and die. They are much safer than people actually think. That's my personal opinion.
00:53:17.046 - 00:53:45.794, Speaker B: One last piece, Sam, because we talked about this in our UST episode. Of course, part of the backing of UST is a big part of the backing is the luna token itself, which is driven by utility value, right? Which is of course, we've talked about this in layer one chains. But presumably aside from kind of the meme monetary store of value potential behind the Luna token. There's also some utility of luna being used in the luna ecosystem.
00:53:45.842 - 00:53:46.246, Speaker A: Right.
00:53:46.348 - 00:54:05.914, Speaker B: What are the drivers of FXS price? Why would that go up or down in terms of value? Is it purely sort of like meme value, monetary premium value? Are there some fees that FxX holders get? Can you tell us about the drivers behind this?
00:54:06.032 - 00:54:33.758, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So the FXS token can be staked as Ve FXs. So a lot of people that are familiar with curve know that this is a model that's fairly popular. And what that is, is you come and you can. Yes, exactly. You come and you can stake your FXS tokens for anywhere between one week to four years. Once you stake them, you can't transfer them, right? They're staked, they're not tokenized.
00:54:33.758 - 00:55:07.294, Speaker A: And then you have a ve FXS balance proportional to how long you've staked your FXS tokens. And you actually get cash flow from the profit of the market operations of fracs. We call them algorithmic market operations. And you could see right now the APR is 4.74% down there. It goes anywhere between three to 20%, depending on how profitable things are and yield opportunities that the protocol is actually conducting. Stabilizing market operations in.
00:55:07.294 - 00:55:29.170, Speaker A: And this is entirely self sufficient, actual profit, not token emissions, not inflation. And one statistic that I put out is like, so Fracs has about 2.7 billion supply. The protocol makes about right around $200 million of annual revenue.
00:55:29.250 - 00:56:25.334, Speaker B: Oh my God. That's a strong ratio in our USC conversation. Apologies to keep going back to that, but I think it's useful context. So just let me say to everyone's listening, if you haven't listened to our bull and bear case of UsT go listen to that, because I think that's also helpful to understand this entire sector. But one conversation we had, which a big driver of UsT value and market cap, I think has been the 20% yields that are being distributed from the anchor protocol on the terra network. And the conversation there is, that's basically marketing spend, right? So like the jump capitals of the world, we're not sure exactly who the sources are, but those who are incented to push out UST into the world are subsidizing that and heavily subsidizing that. The 20% rate, it's not necessarily long term sustainable to do that, but maybe it's worth it for now, this 4.7%,
00:56:25.334 - 00:56:31.702, Speaker B: that's not coming from the marketing spend large, not at all.
00:56:31.756 - 00:56:35.642, Speaker A: Issuance, entirely cash flow? Yeah, that is entirely cash flow. Wow.
00:56:35.696 - 00:56:39.190, Speaker B: All on chain cash flow, then economic sustainability.
00:56:39.270 - 00:56:40.330, Speaker C: You love to see it.
00:56:40.400 - 00:56:41.290, Speaker B: Love to see it.
00:56:41.360 - 00:57:05.802, Speaker C: Very good, Sam, just a last few set of questions before we get into the spicy side, the four pool, the stablecoin wars, and why you think do Kwan has it out against DaI. We'll talk about that. But first, just the remaining roadmap that's on the roadmap for fracs. Let's talk about that. Can you explain what the FPI is and what it is, how it works, and how it helps increase the adoption for fracs?
00:57:05.966 - 00:57:49.982, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. The FPI is the second stablecoin in the frax ecosystem. It's the first ever stablecoin pegged to the CPI consumer price index, which is the prices of a basket of consumer items. In fact, we started working on this last year, and last week, coincidentally, we launched and there was a very successful launch, and it was highly anticipated. Again, going back to kind of the grand vision. Right? Like the thing I said, stablecoins are the third trillion dollar narrative of crypto. The evolution of stablecoins will probably look like the evolution of central banking.
00:57:49.982 - 00:58:35.698, Speaker A: Right. And remember, the last part of the story of the central bank was that after a while they said, okay, let's not actually peg to some external exchange rate that we can't control. Let's peg to an exchange rate that is our definition as a society and a government of a standard of living, of items that we want this piece of paper to be able to afford. Right. And that's where the FPI is. The FPI is basically, in my opinion, like the final evolution of stablecoins on chain. We'll probably see a lot of stablecoin projects kind of taking inspiration from the FPI design.
00:58:35.698 - 00:59:00.202, Speaker A: In fact, we are working with Volt protocol, which is led by Kirk and a few of the guys close to Faye, which is another project. And I think there will be a lot more of these. And that's a great thing. Right. And again, I think evolution, no, know what you think about it. It's going to evolve in that direction. Right.
00:59:00.202 - 00:59:28.146, Speaker A: And I think it's really powerful because we're going to basically be able to be kind of the bitcoin of a self sovereign pec. Right. And so the idea is, at the beginning, we're going to have the CPI of the federal government, right. And a lot of people have a problem with that. They think it understates inflation or all this stuff. Eventually, the idea is having the weights of the basket of goods be entirely governed on chain. Right.
00:59:28.146 - 01:00:33.970, Speaker A: Like basically a self sovereign economy with a self sovereign definition of standard of living and inflation. Right? Inflation is defined as the actual price divergence of the currency you use against the basket of items, right? Against the thing that you need. That's exactly what the Fed actually defines inflation to be. Right. And coincidentally, today was the Fed and BLS gov report on CPI, right? Which is every month the US government releases the prices of the basket of consumer goods in dollars. And the inflation rate is defined as what are the prices of those things in dollars? Compared to what were the prices of those things last month in dollars, right? If the prices of those things went up, if you need more dollars to afford the same things as you did last month, there is inflation of the dollar, right? Its value is going down. You need more dollars for the same consumer goods.
01:00:33.970 - 01:00:59.760, Speaker A: And coincidentally, today is, I think, the highest CPI reading in like 45, 50 years in the United States, which is very concerning, obviously. But that basically means that in the past 30 days, the value of those pieces of paper to what they were supposed to track is not doing very well, right?
01:01:00.210 - 01:01:02.094, Speaker B: Can I just break this down for people?
01:01:02.132 - 01:01:02.334, Speaker A: Right?
01:01:02.372 - 01:01:36.810, Speaker B: So it's like crypto has just produced something really cool and new in the FPI and in fracs, right? So if everyone saw the headline, it was a headline around the world this week, CPI now 8.5%, and that's a lower bound estimate, as Sam just said, but your dollar is worth eight and a half percent less than it was a year ago at this time. So did you get an 8.5% raise in your paycheck? The answer for just about everyone is probably no, I didn't. Maybe I got a two or 3% if I'm lucky. Well, you lost money, you lost 5% as a result.
01:01:36.880 - 01:01:39.098, Speaker C: Less money every making less money going forward.
01:01:39.184 - 01:02:13.810, Speaker B: By holding it in the dollar, you're making less money. By getting your paycheck denominated in the dollar, you're actually making less, unless you got a raise to compensate. So what does crypto produce? This thing called FPI, which doesn't actually track the dollar, it tracks CPI inflation. So that 8.5% that everyone's like, oh, shit, I just lost 8.5%. If you held in FPI, you would have actually been neutral, you wouldn't have lost that 8.5%. If you got paid in FPI, you would still preserve your purchasing power versus getting paid in the dollar.
01:02:13.810 - 01:02:30.138, Speaker B: That's something new that crypto is producing, that no other system on the planet is producing, because central banks don't produce that. They're not in tune with what consumers actually want and demand. And this is what's so neat about this project.
01:02:30.304 - 01:02:58.358, Speaker A: Yeah, and that's exactly correct. You said it better than me. Actually. The thing is, that's exactly what it is. We actually just launched it last week and we see a lot of people minting FPI. You can mint it with fracs at the actual peg price. So obviously the growth of the FPI stablecoin will be going higher and higher as the actual peg track CPI itself.
01:02:58.358 - 01:03:35.694, Speaker A: Right. In fact, it's kind of interesting because it's almost like currently, it's almost like a dollar coin that is growing at the inflation rate because we use the exact same CPI basket as the Fed uses for the dollar right now. Obviously, the trillion dollar vision here again is like eventually crypto is this self sovereign digital global economy. We can vote on the weights of those things, right. And then at that point the FPI could float against the dollar. It could grow higher than what the Fed defines as inflation or lower. It depends on what they vote on.
01:03:35.732 - 01:03:53.622, Speaker B: I think we'll take it. I mean, projection from even the 8.5% in this climate, this is like back to the 1970s, that's definitely worth it. And I guess the one dependency that this is introducing as well, is this connected to like a chain link oracle or something like that to get the CPI data on chain, yeah.
01:03:53.676 - 01:04:18.286, Speaker A: So they actually use a custom chainlink oracle that we design with Chainlink and vault projects. And the good news there is there's usually two issues with oracles, right. One is the actual publisher that needs to be honest. And then two is the place they're getting the actual data. Correct. Right. And so since we're using the government currently.
01:04:18.286 - 01:04:36.290, Speaker A: Right. It's unlikely the government is going to lie about what the government actually says. It's more about like, is what the government is saying, is it unbiased or non political? That is obviously just going to be fixed when there's, you know, ability to have governance on the CPI gauge.
01:04:36.710 - 01:05:15.454, Speaker C: All right, guys, so that was the deep dive into the fracs. Got way deeper than I thought we were going because we got excited. Because we got excited. And like we always say, we haven't said it recently, so I'll say it here, crypto is always speed running. The history of money and finance and fracs really seems to be like skipping right to the end, like right to the point of the frontier. So that's really what gets me excited about this story. In the second half of the show, we got to talk about some of the current events going on because Doe Kwan's recent proposal for the curve four pool caused eventually the FXX token, the frax token to go from $22 to over $40 inside of a day.
01:05:15.454 - 01:05:58.158, Speaker C: And so now there's a bunch of just like clamor about what's going on in the four pool. So we're going to get to those subjects and also just the long term equilibrium of the stablecoin wars. Or what Sam thinks that the long term equilibrium is going to be right after we get to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. If you're trying to grow and preserve your crypto wealth, optimizing your taxes is just as lucrative as trying to find the next hidden gem.

Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life. Across is the fastest, cheapest and most secure crosschain bridge with across. You don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice. Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across bridges are powered by UMA's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer two back to Ethereum, a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum, where community members will decide on the token distribution.
01:06:55.258 - 01:07:39.582, Speaker C: You can have your part of across the story by joining the discord and becoming a cofounder and helping to design the fair fair launch of across. If you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely, go to across to bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, arbitram or boba networks. Arbitrum is an Ethereum layer two scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs. Over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrum, and the DFI and NFT ecosystems are growing rapidly. Some of the coolest and newest NFT collections have chosen arbitram as their home. All the while, DFI protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity. Using arbitrum has never been easier, especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitrum through all the exchanges, including binance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com.
01:07:39.582 - 01:08:33.290, Speaker C: Once inside, you'll notice arbitrum increases Ethereum's speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee. If you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users, visit Arbitrum IO slash developer to start building your DaP on Arbitrum if you're a dgen, many of your favorite dapps on Ethereum are already on Arbitrum, with many moving over every day. Go to bridge arbitrum IO now to start bridging over your eth and other tokens in order to experience alright guys, and we are back. This is a tweet that Doequan put out at the very start of this month, and he writes, introducing the four pool between Frax finance TfL redacted, pretty much. We own all the CVX, the governance tokens for curve. And he's introducing the four pool, a new curve stablecoin liquidity pool between UST, Frax, USDC and Tether. And he says the curve wars are over, all emissions are going to the four pool.
01:08:33.290 - 01:09:12.330, Speaker C: And so this is one of the spicier tweets that's come out lately, because what it's doing is it's removing a lot of liquidity from Dai, and it's redirecting the liquidity from the former dominant three pool out of curve and saying it's going to be pointed towards this four pool, which instead of dai, the dominant decentralized stablecoin inside of Ethereum, it's pointing it towards ust a decentralized stablecoin that is non native to Ethereum fracs, another decentralized stablecoin that's on Ethereum, and then USCC and tether. And so, first off, Sam, did this surprise you, this proposal? Surprise?
01:09:14.110 - 01:10:21.074, Speaker A: So first, yeah, I think some background. No, it didn't surprise me because I've been talking with Doe for a while. Doe, as I think everyone knows, is one of the smartest and most ambitious guys in the entire space. I mean, Luna is, like I said before, literally one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the entire space, in the entire industry, right? I've known Doe since, like, 2018 ish, right? When they started Terra, we briefly talked about stablecoins and stuff, and then we went off and worked on our own things. And one of the things that's really impressive about Doe that I think a lot of people might not get is like, he's a very good strategist, but know, taking everything literally. And I think Jose said this, too, right? Like, I don't think he straight up means the classic meme of it's not like I should succeed, but it's everyone else should die or fail. I don't think you should take that super seriously in that literal way.
01:10:21.074 - 01:11:13.300, Speaker A: But the backstory here with the four pool is that fracs and Terra are very methodical and aggressive about how we want to grow and actually permeate. If you're a currency issuer, which is what Terra is, and Frax is and maker is, right, you want to get your currency out where there's economic activity. So people can take debts denominated in your currency, they can trade in your currency, they can hold your currency, they can save in your currency, they can do all of these things, right? And there's multiple ways to do that. But at the end of the day, the success of how big a currency is, is how much of economic activity and people are actually using your thing, right? And a good mixture of it. Right. Everyone's using ust right now to save and anchor again. It's great.
01:11:13.300 - 01:12:16.550, Speaker A: But if you're a currency assurer, you need to get your currency everywhere else. We're willing to do really big things with the four pool, basically giving a lot of yield, working with other projects to actually use forpool as their metapool of choice. And curve, like I said, curve is kind of like the WordPress of stablecoins or making pegged assets, whether it's stablecoins or eth and steeth or whatever, right? And, like, correlated assets, curve is a really important piece of infrastructure because it's basically allowed this kind of cambrian explosion of these projects to evolve. We want to support that. We want to actually give incentives and actually spend part of the money that frax makes, right? Or part of the money that Terra's foundation and they all have access to. Right? And there's nothing wrong with Maker not wanting to do the same thing with. So, for example, I'm not going to come up here and be like, I hate maker and stuff.
01:12:16.550 - 01:13:00.054, Speaker A: Actually, I think I tweeted, like, if maker does want to actually do a dye for pool. We will give maker the same thing we're willing to spend on every other project. And I know that maker guys, I talked to Nick at Maker, I've talked to Seb, I've talked to a bunch of them. They're all great guys. They have different execution opinions. I've tried before to see if there's appetite for a frax, PSM, or just kind of a lot of different things. And I think they take a very thorough, slow, methodical, and I don't want to really say like bureaucratic, but sometimes it might feel that way, approach to governance and things like that.
01:13:00.054 - 01:13:39.486, Speaker A: And it never really went anywhere because I think there's just kind of know desire for it. But Doe and I have a really good relationship and we like to strategize, we like to move fast. Yes, our kind of risk to growth tolerance is higher. I don't think that means we're in any case like enemies or not. At least I'll come up here and say like, frax is not, but it's just something the dai is not interested in. And if they are, at least from Frax, we're always willing to outstretch the hand. And I think so is Doe.
01:13:39.486 - 01:13:58.210, Speaker A: I mean, obviously I can't put words in his mouth, but I think knowing him and knowing both how strategic and smart he is, I think that was his way of saying the same thing I'm saying just in his personality. And I think that's what Jose said on the show as well. I think this kind of lines up.
01:13:58.380 - 01:14:33.858, Speaker C: Okay, so there is like this one piece of real estate, which is curve, which is really, really important for liquidity with stablecoins. And curve is designed to be fought over, right? It's called the curve wars for a reason. And so do you think this stablecoin wars, where do you think the equilibrium of the stablecoin wars ends up? Is the war word even appropriate? Or is that just like the clickbaity headline that people like to talk about? So where do you think the long term equilibrium of the stablecoin fight for liquidity in defi ends up at?
01:14:34.024 - 01:14:58.054, Speaker A: Yeah, I think curve is more important than some people think. In fact, part of the reason maybe that maker is not that interested in working with us is. I think their opinion of how important curve actually is, is different. They're like, okay, this is just like a Dex. It's like losing money on all the crv emissions and stuff. And it's just a funny game people can play. We're doing real world assets.
01:14:58.054 - 01:15:31.378, Speaker A: And our focus is over there and stuff. And that's fine. That's actually fantastic difference of opinion. But we want to focus on this, because like I said, we do think curve is more than just a Dex. At least I do. I think it's an algorithmic savings account where people can deposit the ratio of stuff that's in the curve pool, and they get a yield on that in CRV and CVX, which is a convex governance token. And then anything else, right? Like if you do the bribing system or whatever, like you're saying.
01:15:31.378 - 01:16:05.406, Speaker A: But some people don't think that's actually interesting. Some people think that it's just a ponzi game of a Dex that's not profitable or something like that. I think it's an incorrect assumption, because curve is not just a Dex. And we could have an entire podcast just describing mechanisms that look like something, but are entirely different. And I think curve is one of those. But that's the thing. Frax has the largest CVX holdings, which is the convex token, which does control parts of curve.
01:16:05.406 - 01:16:48.638, Speaker A: Terra also has a very large amount maker does not. They could purchase it if they want to, but I doubt they will based on their strategic opinions. They could also work directly with us in terms of that, but I don't think they will, and there's nothing wrong with it. I think, though, that the four pool is going to be absolutely massive once things get going. We just actually launched the forepool on arbitrum, and the gauge for that, which is the thing that earns the CRV emissions, should be going up any hour now, literally. And then the one on Phantom is already out this period. There will be emissions to it.
01:16:48.638 - 01:17:21.370, Speaker A: The one on, I believe on Polygon is actually also already out, and then the emissions will start soon. So I think this will take the entire stablecoin world by storm. I think it's actually going to be bigger than what the headlines say once everything is rolled out, it's going to take slightly longer than people think to roll everything out. Like this week, and then the next week, and the week after that. But once it all comes together, I think it's going to be the savings account of a very large part of the crypto industry.
01:17:21.710 - 01:18:01.314, Speaker B: That is cool. And yeah, thanks for explaining that. I guess one thing to impress upon our listeners is we call it the stablecoin wars, but that can be the focus. But there's also a massive amount of stablecoin synergy here. So even like, Frax itself is backed partially based on Dai, that's in these lp tokens and curve. And what is Dai backed by? Well, increasingly these other real world assets. So at some level, fracs wins when Dai makes a deal with Tesla, as they did like two weeks ago, to provide lending protocol services to Tesla.
01:18:01.314 - 01:19:03.420, Speaker B: So all of these real world assets coming into defi actually strengthen fracs as well. And I do think this lattice approach of all of these different experiments and different strategies to address stablecoin actually makes the defi space more resilient and stronger because we don't just have one strategy, we have like five different strategies, right? And they're all happening at once. And yeah, some will win, some will lose, some will prove more successful over time, but there's strength in having this plurality of approaches here, I think. I guess, Sam, as we draw to a close, and this has gone on longer than we thought, just because I think we've been intensely interested in what you've had to say and learning more about this project. So thank you for your time. I'm wondering if you could give us some predictions on what happens next in stablecoins, just like you're thinking about this day in and day out. Do you have any hot takes, any predictions for the next one year, the next three years in terms of how the space evolves and what happens next? Just anything that comes to mind?
01:19:03.870 - 01:19:50.550, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So first thing is, I actually always like to say we're positive some players at Fracs, and I think a lot of this is actually catching on because I always like to say stablecoin pegs are stronger together than they are trying to actually take from each other. It's always a good idea to grow the entire economic piece of the pie rather than take other people's piece of the pie, whether it's liquidity, whether it's like size, market cap or users. But basically that's the philosophy we always do at fracs, right? So we love Terra, we're willing to work with them and we are going to do this absolutely massive four pool. We're willing to work with pretty much anyone. We love Faye and those guys as well. Joey is a great guy.
01:19:50.550 - 01:21:41.834, Speaker A: And the people building Volt, which is the other project in terms of where we see the space going, I think that, I don't want to kind of toot my own horn, but we've been pretty spot on with the things like looking like fractional stablecoins. US releasing fracs is like the first fractional algorithmic one, and then also releasing the first CPI pegged stablecoin in the FBI I think what's going to happen is that in the next twelve to 24 months, there will be consolidation around three, maybe four decentralized stablecoins. And by consolidation I mean it's going to increasingly look like things like UST fracs, Dai probably Faye maybe, and stuff are going to be kind of the ones that all the new projects are using as collateral. Right. Like what we might be using for USDC. I think there's going to be a consolidation on the decentralized stablecoin level, right. And second thing is, I think there's going to be a lot of the narrative of these inflation resistant assets talked about in terms of is bitcoin and ETH better for inflation resistance or are they better central bank reserves on these decentralized central bank protocols like FPI and Terra and stuff? Because one thing that's really important that Doe started the narrative on is like BTC is like the new gold, right? And they're using that as Terra's basically gold, right? And we think the same thing for ETH and basically some BTC to have some kind of exposure to.
01:21:41.834 - 01:22:48.334, Speaker A: But I think that ETH is basically the same kind of trillion dollar asset as bitcoin. And what's going to happen is there's going to be a lot of shifting of the narrative of inflation resistance is where you go with bitcoin and ETH. And instead it's going to be you go to these stablecoins because they literally have an inflation resistant peg, and then you invest in ETH and BTC and stuff to increase your net worth denominated in these FBI stablecoins or dollars, if you still use those. That's my kind of hot take. And the reason that people call me like a stablecoin maxi or something like that. And I always try to not take the maxi moniker, but I think that for stability and inflation resistance, stablecoins or currencies with an actual algorithmic monetary policy are superior. But I believe that the two big other trillion dollar narratives, which is Ethereum and bitcoin, make the perfect reserves for those kinds of stablecoins.
01:22:48.334 - 01:22:52.034, Speaker A: So that's kind of the way to end this. I think that's a really good take.
01:22:52.072 - 01:23:29.098, Speaker B: And I think bankless is definitely the bankless thesis agrees with what you're saying. And certainly I think our listeners can relate to how painful it is to spend their ETH and spend their bitcoin, right? You'd rather be sending something like, is it FPI? Which is kind of like an earning an FPI and keeping kind of your one to two month reserves in that and never having to spend. Just stack your ETH stack and stake. And the same with bitcoin as well. Thank you so much Sam. This has been a lot of fun and I think you turned on the light bulb for a lot of listeners. So we appreciate you coming on bankless and telling us about the stablecoin wars.
01:23:29.098 - 01:23:30.986, Speaker B: Talking to us more about fracs.
01:23:31.098 - 01:23:32.926, Speaker A: It was my pleasure. Thanks guys.
01:23:33.108 - 01:23:46.962, Speaker B: We'll include some links in the show notes to the frax dashboard. Also the elgo stablecoin market share dashboard that we displayed on YouTube. Risks and disclaimers as always. ETH is risky. Bitcoin is risky. Stablecoins are. That's for sure.
01:23:46.962 - 01:23:59.858, Speaker B: Crypto is risky. You could definitely lose what you put in. But hey, is it any riskier than fiat? I'm not sure these days. The truth is we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.
01:23:59.858 - 01:24:00.678, Speaker B: Thanks a lot.
