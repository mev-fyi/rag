00:00:00.090 - 00:00:13.774, Speaker A: Arbitrum has finally announced the long awaited AirDrop. Is it layer two season? Are we finally here? Can we say that? Bankless nation. It is the third Friday of March. David, what time is it?
00:00:13.812 - 00:00:28.598, Speaker B: Ryan? It's the Friday Bankless weekly roll up, where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor. Yet we persevere nonetheless into the frontier with an AirDrop. This week, the frontier has brought us an AirDrop. We found an AirDrop. Big one.
00:00:28.604 - 00:00:29.238, Speaker A: We got one.
00:00:29.324 - 00:00:30.486, Speaker B: We got one.
00:00:30.508 - 00:00:52.426, Speaker A: That was much anticipated. Guys, we're going to tell you about the Arbitrum AirDrop. It's happening and we've got all the details. We're also going to talk about some of this fallout from this little banking crisis that seems to be going on. It happened after we recorded the last roll up and it's been going on till then, so talk about that now. Maybe the contagion has reached Europe. David, what else we covering?
00:00:52.538 - 00:01:28.454, Speaker B: The New York attorney says that Ether is a security, but should we even listen to them at all? Gary says Staking is also security ish we have to listen to him a little bit more. The CFTC says hold up, hold up. So we'll talk about all those details and then sad, sad news out of DFI protocol. Euler was a big hack. 200 million dollar DFI hack from a beloved bear market building team. So we'll cover those details and more.

00:01:35.174 - 00:01:57.440, Speaker A: Speaking of going bankless, david, this is a question for everyone in the Bankless Nation who is listening right now. Are you a Bankless citizen yet? David and I told you about the release of our new website Bankless.com last week. I think we must have said it about ten times. We're trying to get our quota of a dozen launched last Friday. Fantastic. Getting a lot of great feedback from the community.
00:01:57.440 - 00:02:01.982, Speaker A: What the section I have open right now is our Just for Citizens section.
00:02:02.046 - 00:02:03.826, Speaker B: So if you were listening, only if.
00:02:03.848 - 00:02:30.966, Speaker A: You were and you are not a citizen, there is an option to upgrade and become a citizen right now. One thing I'll draw your attention to is something that drops at the time you're listening to this. It should drop today. That is our AirDrop guide. All right. Every month we issue an exclusive AirDrop guide to all Bankless citizens that contains some alpha. It's our best guesses on which airdrops are happening next.
00:02:30.966 - 00:02:51.390, Speaker A: And they're still happening. People said the airdrops were dead. Not the case. We just got probably our biggest AirDrop of the year. Of the last, like, I don't know, the last long time just happened this week. And the AirDrop guide has a whole bunch more. I don't know, there's a few dozen anyways.
00:02:51.390 - 00:03:12.794, Speaker A: And so if you missed out on Arbitrum, or even if you got the arbitram opportunity, there are more opportunities to unlock. Because as we always say, David, crypto pays you to learn about crypto. You use some of these protocols, you implement the strategies, and you can be eligible for these in the future. Potentially. These are just our guesses. Anyway, citizens, get our track record is pretty damn good.
00:03:12.832 - 00:03:26.670, Speaker B: Dude, our track record is great. Yeah. And you definitely hear about it in the feedback inside of the Bankless Nation discord. Like, the bankless premium subscription is designed to pay for itself, and this is just one of the many ways in which it does that.
00:03:26.820 - 00:03:31.726, Speaker A: Here we go. Let's get to markets. David, the price of bitcoin this week, we up or we down?
00:03:31.908 - 00:03:48.126, Speaker B: We are very up 15%. When's the last 15% green week that you've seen in bitcoin? We started the week at 21,650, and that was before we dumped. So right when we this always happens, Ryan. We concluded the weekly roll up last.
00:03:48.168 - 00:03:49.334, Speaker A: Week right about here.
00:03:49.372 - 00:04:28.226, Speaker B: Right about there is when we recorded, and then that big red candle happened, and then it went down even more and then it resurged all throughout this last week. So we started the week at, like, 21,600, hit a low of below 20,000, which is not a number we want to be below. And then as soon as this banking cris resolved itself, sunday night, Monday morning, bitcoin had a massive run, a 20% to 25% run inside of half of a day or something. Look at this. Yeah. Below 20,000 to almost 27,000. We are currently at $24,700, up 15% on the week from where we started at 21,000.
00:04:28.226 - 00:04:37.298, Speaker B: So one of the most volatile weeks in crypto price action, probably, of the year, ending the week positive over the last seven days by up 15%.
00:04:37.464 - 00:04:41.960, Speaker A: So, as a tradition, I'm sure by the time you hear this, we'll be down another 20%.
00:04:44.330 - 00:04:53.686, Speaker B: After that candle down, like, we need to just change this section. It's like, all right, Bankless Nation, please pull up in your charts, open your price tracker, checker that's the price of bitcoin.
00:04:53.798 - 00:05:05.198, Speaker A: Recite bitcoin to yourself, recite ETH yourself. Insert here. How about ETH Price? That tells a story, though, which is different than bitcoin. It's also up as you'd expect, but not up as much.
00:05:05.284 - 00:05:27.166, Speaker B: Not up as much. Yeah. ETH price starting the week at 1530, fell down to below one $400, moved up almost to one $800, and now is at one $660. So a very volatile week overall, up eight and a half percent on the week bitcoin. Almost doubled the appreciation of ether this week, David.
00:05:27.278 - 00:05:28.694, Speaker A: Can you believe that?
00:05:28.812 - 00:05:30.082, Speaker B: Let's get to this chart.
00:05:30.146 - 00:05:34.440, Speaker A: This is the ETH to bitcoin ratio. And I'm wondering if you're a little salty about this.
00:05:35.690 - 00:05:37.094, Speaker B: Salty? Look at this.
00:05:37.132 - 00:05:46.838, Speaker A: Ratio, man. So bitcoin, of course, appreciated much faster than the price of ether this week. And so that means the ratio goes down. Where are we on the ratio?
00:05:46.934 - 00:06:11.698, Speaker B: Down 6%. So it actually was, like, doing really, really well. We almost got up to zero 74. We are down to zero 76, which is a huge move for the ratio. I mean, we're used to dollar moves, bitcoin versus ether versus the dollar, but the ratio does not usually move much. I don't remember the last time the ratio moved 6%, but yeah, down below zero 67. So we are touching the lows of the recent times now.
00:06:11.784 - 00:06:16.458, Speaker A: Look at this. I am learning to become a charter on Kraken Pro and I'm just zooming out, cracking.
00:06:16.654 - 00:06:18.086, Speaker B: Doing God work here.
00:06:18.188 - 00:06:26.626, Speaker A: Yeah, you've really helped. Kraken Pro, of course, bankless sponsor, our favorite place to go chart and to exchange coins.
00:06:26.738 - 00:06:58.770, Speaker B: Only place that he charts, the only place that he's been able to. It's great, though, we haven't seen this lows in the ETH bitcoin ratio since the Three Arrows Capital liquidation back in June. And the reason why the Ether price was so suppressed then was because ether is just used as the collateral of the internet, just in DeFi and across, even in Solana. Right. And so when three zero's capital liquidated itself and many others, ether had so much sell pressure and it bounced right back above that. But now we haven't seen lows since then.
00:06:58.920 - 00:07:18.626, Speaker A: Okay, well, so this chart really tells a story. I think this might be one of the stories of the week. Why did bitcoin appreciate so much relative to Ether? It's not like some catalyst event happened for bitcoin. This is all on the back of these bank runs and the resolution of the bank runs. But bitcoin appreciated more almost double Ether. Why?
00:07:18.748 - 00:07:42.826, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's right. I can only really explain it by the banking crisis. And I think the very simple take is that, oh, banking crises, banks are collapsing. Bitcoin, bitcoin good. Yeah, right. And whether or not this is new capital who are like, oh, the banks are collapsing, therefore I'm going to warm up to bitcoin. Now, I don't know how much capital is saying is like, coming to that conclusion.
00:07:42.826 - 00:08:07.494, Speaker B: The other take is like, oh, the traders of crypto are like, oh, other people are going to think that and therefore we're going to buy bitcoin because people are going to think that, oh, banks collapsing, therefore bitcoin. I think when something so big in the trad world that proves out crypto's use cases happens, I think the simple take is like, oh, buy bitcoin. That's my only explanation. That's my only take.
00:08:07.532 - 00:08:37.166, Speaker A: Let me throw another take at you. I don't know if this is later in the agenda, but you know Binance's reserve fund, their insurance fund, the binance insurance fund that they've been stacking dollars in, usually it has been denominated in stablecoins. CZ announced that binance is going to I don't know if they've begun this yet, David, but is going to, rather than denominate this insurance fund, if an exchange attack or something goes wrong, the Binance bailout fund, he's going to move that from stablecoins into Bitcoin and ETH.
00:08:37.278 - 00:08:37.698, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:37.784 - 00:08:42.926, Speaker A: And could that be running of that or could that be that sort of activity?
00:08:43.038 - 00:08:57.574, Speaker B: I don't know. I mean, over in the long term, if we just bounce off of this low, because we haven't broken down lows, back down to the Three Arrows capital liquidation levels, if we just bounce back up, then this will become noise. I don't know. I don't know how to interpret this.
00:08:57.612 - 00:08:59.234, Speaker A: What are you doing? Are you still holding that ratio trade?
00:08:59.282 - 00:09:04.378, Speaker B: Oh, God. Yeah. I've held my ratio trade down way below this. I've held it down to 0.5.
00:09:04.464 - 00:09:05.094, Speaker A: You're not worried?
00:09:05.142 - 00:09:14.426, Speaker B: I held it through the Three Arrows capital liquidation. Look, by the way, your boy's not here for the short term narrative.
00:09:14.458 - 00:09:20.814, Speaker A: Traders are excited right now, but David continues to hold. How about the global crypto market cap? How are we doing?
00:09:20.852 - 00:09:23.342, Speaker B: 1.125 trillion dollars.
00:09:23.476 - 00:09:24.062, Speaker A: Wow.
00:09:24.196 - 00:09:27.266, Speaker B: Up bigly. We almost fell below a trillion, but we have not.
00:09:27.368 - 00:09:50.714, Speaker A: Yeah, so we're up about 100 billion just on the week. Kind of nice, casual. Let's talk about CPI inflation. Got to talk about the quote unquote, real economy. No, it's not the real economy. I guess this is the traditional economy, the non crypto economy, inflation. So the long awaited US CPI numbers, that is the Consumer Price Index numbers came in.
00:09:50.714 - 00:10:15.330, Speaker A: What are they reading? Annual inflation down to 6%. So recall over the summer we were at like 9%, eight or 9%, something like this. And then CPI grew less the last month, so that would be the month of February than in January. It grew less by 0.4% than February and less by 0.5% in January.
00:10:15.830 - 00:10:26.210, Speaker B: So my interpretation is that the core inflation is down and it's down a predicted amount, not above or below that predicted amount. Is that the interpretation?
00:10:26.550 - 00:10:40.854, Speaker A: It seems to be kind of in line with what analysts expected, maybe down a little bit more than analysts expected, but like, nothing surprising here. So the market wasn't reacting to this this week, it was all bank crisis time. Do you have a take about inflation here for us?
00:10:40.892 - 00:10:49.366, Speaker B: So if I ask you to tell me how to feel about this, your answer is you got nothing, I mean, nothing new, right? Tell me how to feel about this, Ryan.
00:10:49.558 - 00:11:35.254, Speaker A: Inflation is, I think, trending downwards. Trending downwards, but also is probably more persistent than the Fed or anyone else wants to admit and is probably still not going to be pushed downwards by monetary policy any further. So I'm still in the camp of like 2%? Nah, that was for the 90s. We got like some three 4% new normal, maybe like a 5%. That's still the camp I'm in. But we'll have to see where things go. And we've had macro folks on the podcast like Lyn Alden, who I consider very good in this area, and she talks about, hey, the next ten years we're going to have cycles, volatility of inflation periods.
00:11:35.302 - 00:11:37.354, Speaker B: Years where inflation yeah, we have large.
00:11:37.392 - 00:11:57.042, Speaker A: Spikes and then we kind of ease back down. But when we ease down don't get comfortable there. We're not returning to like a ten to 20 year period of time where we have two digit inflation. We're going to continually get real inflation in the economy. And by the way, CPI is just feel like it's almost the wrong metric to look at anyway.
00:11:57.176 - 00:12:42.640, Speaker B: Yeah, right. The takes I've been hearing about inflation is that we actually don't know to what degree is it a supply side problem or a demand side problem. One take I heard recently was that, okay, we're increasing interest rates just to destroy capital, destroy demand. But also there's the whole supply chain thing and all of that. And so there's the other side of the equation that the Fed doesn't have control over. And to what degree that actual inflation is responding to Fed interest rate policy versus just normal consumer and supply chain and supply side things is still unknown. And perhaps the Fed's involvement here is lessened, meaning that inflation will just naturally subside just by some of these idiosyncrasies of the COVID era just play out.
00:12:43.170 - 00:12:56.590, Speaker A: We will have to see that's what the Fed wants to be true. I don't know that that's going to play out. David, let me give you some good news on your ETH bitcoin ratio trade. All right. Ultrasound money still continues to be ultrasound.
00:12:56.670 - 00:12:57.634, Speaker B: Oh, thank God.
00:12:57.752 - 00:13:09.480, Speaker A: You can go look at ultrasound money at the burn. We just hit 3 million ether supply burnt as a percentage of the network. What's that just under like 2%?
00:13:10.330 - 00:13:12.120, Speaker B: No. Over 2%, I think.
00:13:12.510 - 00:13:20.810, Speaker A: Sorry, just under 3%, 2.72.8%, something like that. That's incredible. Incredible.
00:13:21.550 - 00:13:25.578, Speaker B: 3 million ETH burns since EIP 1559. Not since proof of stake.
00:13:25.674 - 00:13:29.310, Speaker A: How has block space demand on ethereum been lately?
00:13:29.970 - 00:13:56.434, Speaker B: Up only? Yeah, so 120,000,000 and we've burned 3 million because of EIP 1559. That is a significant amount. And EIP one five nine burns ether at the margins. Right. So the people that still have their ICO ether and are just holding on it, that ether is not being burnt. It's like the active transactors that have to re up their supply of ether that's being burnt. And so it actually does show up in the price slowly, very slowly.
00:13:56.482 - 00:14:14.182, Speaker A: It's fundamentals. Yes, these are what we call fundamentals. David, some interesting volume fundamentals as well. Uniswap volume is up big. This is a tweet from Hayden Adams. Uniswap at almost 12 billion in daily volume hitting eleven digits for the first time ever. That's a crazy amount of volume.
00:14:14.182 - 00:14:16.662, Speaker A: I feel like that's silently happening in the background.
00:14:16.806 - 00:14:24.986, Speaker B: Well, no, not so silently. That is people fleeing out of USDC and then back into USDC.
00:14:25.018 - 00:14:26.798, Speaker A: Silently happening in the background is what.
00:14:26.804 - 00:14:27.982, Speaker B: I would no, it's quite loud.
00:14:28.046 - 00:14:43.314, Speaker A: No, people are like, oh my God, USDC is over. There was a lot of that this weekend, by the way. We'll get to it later. But of course, USD deeped to $0.90. Never seen that happen. Actually below ninety cents. Eighty eight cents.
00:14:43.314 - 00:14:47.090, Speaker A: Never seen that before. So I guess that's why the exchange activity was busy.
00:14:47.170 - 00:15:26.194, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly right. But this is in line with other things. So here's synthetics, $100 million in daily volume for synthetics perpetuals, which is almost a two x bigger amount than it's ever had on a daily. So like synthetics on layer two, on optimism, coming back with a force, and this has always been a big constraint on synthetics, is layer one gas fees really hamstrung the whole entire synthetics ecosystem. Now that it's on optimism, it is seeing a rise of the phoenix for synthetics MetaMask swaps, also hitting all time highs over the weekend. So activity is in blockspace, demand is in.
00:15:26.312 - 00:15:47.606, Speaker A: You know, I'm going to do a quick shout out for our friends and sponsors at MetaMask here. Seems like an appropriate time. Did you know Bankless Nation, inside of your MetaMask wallet there's this really cool feature called the swap you could do inside of MetaMask. Don't need to go to an exchange, you just swap one asset for another, really reasonable prices and you get that done inside of your wallet.
00:15:47.638 - 00:16:00.158, Speaker B: That's what does the whole order routing thing to go through all the exchanges so you don't have to deal with it. It's like kayak for hotels.com. Yeah, it's just like Kayako or whatever that is.
00:16:00.244 - 00:16:01.818, Speaker A: Kayak for digital assets.
00:16:01.914 - 00:16:02.670, Speaker B: Yeah, right.
00:16:02.820 - 00:16:07.922, Speaker A: There you go. And thanks for MetaMask, for supporting Bankless, as always. David, what do we have coming up next?
00:16:08.056 - 00:16:42.938, Speaker B: Coming up next, what do we have? The Arbitrum AirDrop is what we're going to talk about. So we're going to talk about all those details today. In about two and hours and ten minutes we're going to live stream with the Arbitrum team so that is available for those that are listening to this on Friday. But then we're going to talk about the banking crises and all about the fallout from that. The joint statement from the FDIC signature bank, whether this is an attack on crypto, tom Emmer's letter to the FDIC, jeremy Alair's, USCC and Credit Suisse because the banking crisis hit Europe. And then after that we got to talk about the New York Attorney General. That alleges that ether is, a security.
00:16:42.938 - 00:17:28.022, Speaker B: But do we even care about that person? I don't even know. Anyways, all of that and more as soon as we get back from some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. Kraken has been a leader in the crypto industry for the last twelve years.

00:18:46.504 - 00:18:53.718, Speaker A: Arbitrum has finally announced the long awaited AirDrop. David, is it layer two season? Are we finally here? Can we say that?
00:18:53.804 - 00:19:12.218, Speaker B: I think so. So Arbitrum is releasing their token optimism. Just had their base announcement with coinbase two. Count them ZKE EVMs go live next week. This is the layer two summer that we have been talking about for like two years now. Finally coming. It's happening.
00:19:12.304 - 00:19:19.262, Speaker A: It was the summer, just not in summertime. Anyway. The ARB token. That's what they called it. ARB. So not ARB. I like that.
00:19:19.262 - 00:19:40.010, Speaker A: ARB will be used to govern over the Arbitrum ecosystem. And yes, it will be airdropped early to users. It launches next Friday as March 23. So the announcement is today. We know what's going to happen, we know some of the details. David's getting into that. The actual token goes live next Friday.
00:19:40.110 - 00:19:40.642, Speaker B: Next Thursday.
00:19:40.706 - 00:19:51.186, Speaker A: Actually, it was it next Thursday. Okay, sorry guys. So next Thursday, by the next roll up, we'll have some actual token information. But David, you know all about this because you've been talking to Arbitrum and we have him on later. Give us the deets.
00:19:51.298 - 00:20:25.822, Speaker B: Yeah. So, okay, 10 billion token supply. Eleven point something percent airdropped to users of Arbitrum. One point something percent airdropped to Dows on Arbitrum to give to their communities a significant percentage being given to the Dow Treasury, something like 45%. So if you count the Dow Treasury or 43% excuse me. So if you count AirDrop to Dows users and the treasury, which the treasury is like, up to the community to decide that's something like 56 ish percent, and then investors and the team get something like 45% of total tokens.
00:20:25.886 - 00:20:28.038, Speaker A: How do you like that? Good distribution. What do you think?
00:20:28.124 - 00:20:47.686, Speaker B: I'm waiting for the community to respond to that. I know Polenia said that this was a bad distribution, but it's very hard to appease Polenia these days. We would know. I went into the small brains discord. I was like, Yo, how's your reactions.
00:20:47.718 - 00:20:49.782, Speaker A: To this Arbitrum community? Small brains?
00:20:49.846 - 00:21:04.350, Speaker B: Yeah, small brains. The treasure dow ecosystem. I just went in there and asked for their gut takes, and everyone was very excited. And so the sentiment is good. Strong morale, strong sentiment. I think the community is accepting this. Yeah, that's my take there.
00:21:04.420 - 00:21:11.150, Speaker A: Okay, that's the supply. Now how are they actually distributing the AirDrop portion of it? David, who's getting this? How do I know if I'm eligible?
00:21:11.230 - 00:21:21.174, Speaker B: Okay, so there's a bunch of different reasons why one could be eligible for the Arbitrum token. I think you're going to go ahead and hit that button and we can look at this happen live. Ryan, how many tokens you got?
00:21:21.292 - 00:21:24.520, Speaker A: All right, how many tokens? The wallet I've been using, let's see.
00:21:26.730 - 00:21:27.938, Speaker B: 3000 tokens.
00:21:28.034 - 00:21:30.486, Speaker A: I did five things out of the six things.
00:21:30.588 - 00:21:46.778, Speaker B: Yes, but those five things also have tiers inside of them as well. So six different things, each one's with internal tiers. So did you bridge to Arbitrum? So that's pretty binary. Like yes or no. It looks like you did not bridge to Arbitrum Nova, so you did not get that qualification. Two different chains.
00:21:46.874 - 00:21:48.670, Speaker A: Not with this wallet. Okay.
00:21:48.740 - 00:22:01.826, Speaker B: Not with all of your 17 other wallets. Yeah. Transactions over time. So you've conducted transactions during two of distinct months. If you did it with six months, you got more if you did it with nine months, you got even more than that.
00:22:01.928 - 00:22:04.674, Speaker A: So that's like a usage type thing. How often are you doing this?
00:22:04.712 - 00:22:52.686, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Next one, transaction frequency and interaction, more than four transactions or interacted with four smart contracts, the base tier, and that goes up to 100 transactions with more than 100 smart contracts for the big power users out there. And so there's four different tiers inside of this criteria. Got it. Below that is transaction value 10,000, 50,000 or 250,000 in aggregate transaction volume. So if you only had $1,000, but you transferred that $1,000 around 250 times, you would have gotten the top criteria and then bridged to Arbitrum One. So assets bridged if you deposit more than 10,050 thousand or $250,000 of assets to Arbitrum One, and then activity on Arbitrum Nova as well the other Arbitrum chain.
00:22:52.686 - 00:22:54.146, Speaker B: So those are all the criteria. Yeah.
00:22:54.248 - 00:23:01.986, Speaker A: So I got 3000 ARB tokens, and again, they're not awarded right now. So I can't come claim these. I can go claim them next Thursday?
00:23:02.098 - 00:23:34.670, Speaker B: Yes, next Thursday. And you will also delegate to a delegate for governance. Which brings us to the conversation of governance. So Arbitrum is licensing Arbitrum technology to the Arbitrum Dao. And so this is actually pretty cool. Not only did they launch their token, they've also launched what they are calling Arbitrum orbits, which are Arbitrum layer threes. So if you choose to build if you choose to build an Arbitrum roll up and deploy it on the ethereum layer one.
00:23:34.670 - 00:24:03.286, Speaker B: So separate from the Arbitrum ecosystem, you must first get approval from the Dow. If you choose to build an Arbitrum roll up and deploy it on Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova, that is completely permissionless. So you can use Arbitrum technology freely to build on top of Arbitrum pre existing chains. But if you want to take the Arbitrum technology and build your own independent roll up, that settles directly to the ethereum layer one, you must first get Dow approval by token vote.
00:24:03.318 - 00:24:27.266, Speaker A: Okay, let me make sure I understand this. So if we were to create a bankless Arbitrum roll up and our own, apart from Nova, apart from Arbitrum One, it has to go to Dow vote. Yes. The ARB token holders have to give us 51% or more. Right? Okay. So if we want to do that but it is completely permissionless. If we want to build our chain like a chain on a chain, a.
00:24:27.288 - 00:24:32.978, Speaker B: Layer three, a layer three on Arbitrum tech, on top of Arbitrum on top.
00:24:32.984 - 00:24:36.702, Speaker A: Of Arbitrum One or Nova permissionless or Nova correct brain permissionless.
00:24:36.766 - 00:24:37.054, Speaker B: Yes.
00:24:37.112 - 00:24:40.966, Speaker A: Interesting. All right, what's the intent behind that, do you think?
00:24:41.148 - 00:25:02.342, Speaker B: Well, naturally, the value of the Arbitrum chain gets contained by the ARP token if you build on top of Arbitrum One or Nova. But if you build an independent chain, you need to justify why you aren't building inside of the Arbitrum network. And so the doubt will determine whether that effort is legitimate.
00:25:02.406 - 00:25:12.058, Speaker A: Fascinating. I think that's very fascinating. Nice experiment. Okay. What else does the ARP token do besides vote? Anything. Do I pay transaction fees for it, or is that still ether?
00:25:12.154 - 00:25:35.618, Speaker B: Oh, no, that's always going to be ether. Yeah. The other big thing is that there is a multi SIG that backstops the fault proofs for Arbitrum. So Arbitrum fault proofs are actually operational and running. So the chain is legitimately decentralized. We are now in what really would call a phase one of roll up decentralization out of four, which is live fault proofs.
00:25:35.714 - 00:25:39.138, Speaker A: Are we seeing that one l two beat the risk.
00:25:39.314 - 00:25:41.210, Speaker B: I don't know if they have that updated that fast.
00:25:41.280 - 00:25:41.900, Speaker A: Okay.
00:25:43.230 - 00:25:58.686, Speaker B: That is live and running, and it's backstopped by a nine of twelve multisig. So it's like when your kid is learning to balance on a bicycle, but you keep your hands there, that's what's going. So the kid's balancing, but you still keep your hands to catch them there. That's what the multi did.
00:25:58.708 - 00:26:02.330, Speaker A: I read this group of multisig holders. It's called the Security Council.
00:26:02.410 - 00:26:03.738, Speaker B: That's correct. A Security Council.
00:26:03.754 - 00:26:17.958, Speaker A: So if they're attacked, then there is a multisig way to kind of like, do a fast upgrade, some sort of very fast reaction. Okay, but fraud proofs are happening now, correct? Yeah, that's big.
00:26:18.044 - 00:26:38.938, Speaker B: Yeah. And then also the cool thing about Arbitrum governance is that this is not snapshot vote. This is direct on chain executable governance. And so you don't have to wait for the team to be like, oh, this is what the community wanted, let's do it. No, Arbitrum governance is executable on chain directly, which is pretty cool.
00:26:39.024 - 00:26:42.860, Speaker A: Yeah, okay. But like, directly on chain, what does that mean?
00:26:43.790 - 00:26:49.854, Speaker B: As opposed to Dow governance, which is like, all right, let's do a snapshot vote. Like, oh, this side won. That means we're going to do this. No.
00:26:49.892 - 00:26:51.706, Speaker A: Where it's like social contract.
00:26:51.818 - 00:26:58.610, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. No, the Arbitrum Token governance is live on binding. Is binding. Correct.
00:26:58.680 - 00:27:00.370, Speaker A: It's on chain binding. That's really cool.
00:27:00.440 - 00:27:24.118, Speaker B: There's also this brand new thing called the Arbitrum Constitution. I mean, you can kind of expect what that is. It's the social contract of the Dao. It also sets some terms. AIP Arbitrum improvement proposal. There's a Dow Treasury govern chain, non govern chains, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And so this is all found at Docs Arbitrum Foundation, and there's now an Arbitrum Foundation that exists.
00:27:24.214 - 00:27:50.866, Speaker A: Very cool. They really gave this a lot of thought. I can certainly tell this big rollout. Okay, let's talk about this. We don't know what the price of the token is at this point in time, but we will by the next roll up. Are there any guesses? Do you have any estimates on what we might be looking at? I guess you could just do comparables of other layer two ecosystems. What would the value of my 3000 ARB tokens be?
00:27:50.968 - 00:28:12.738, Speaker B: Yeah. So 10 billion Arbitrum tokens, coincidentally, conveniently, maddox and optimism are roughly valued kind of close to each other. Maddox is valued at $11.4 billion. Fully diluted optimism is valued at $10.7 billion. Fully diluted optimism has a lot more of dilution to go.
00:28:12.738 - 00:28:34.574, Speaker B: The market cap is much lower than the fully diluted value, but the fully diluted value, I think, is the one to pay attention to for the time being. So if we think that Arbitrum is going to be about valued, like, these two comparable, like for like, one to one ish, that would mean that one ARB token is going to be about $1.10 ish. If you think that. Arbitrum is equivalent to Maddox and optimism.
00:28:34.702 - 00:28:37.570, Speaker A: So just above a dollar is what.
00:28:37.720 - 00:28:38.354, Speaker B: I think that is.
00:28:38.392 - 00:28:39.006, Speaker A: Reasonable prediction.
00:28:39.038 - 00:28:46.062, Speaker B: Safe base case could be as a conservative estimation, in my opinion, as like $1.10.
00:28:46.126 - 00:28:53.926, Speaker A: How much supply is hidden? This will be more similar to optimism than to Maddox in terms of the liquid supply that's on the market. Is that right?
00:28:53.948 - 00:28:57.810, Speaker B: Yeah. Maddox has gone through price discovery.
00:28:57.970 - 00:29:08.026, Speaker A: It's an old token. That's why the older the token, the more distribution is in the hands of kind of the open market, the less is locked up in kind of insiders and investors and that sort of thing.
00:29:08.128 - 00:29:26.722, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. And so the market cap of Maddox Polygon is 10.3 billion, where the fully diluted value is 11.3 billion. So it's like 90% issued, right? Yeah. Optimism is a fully diluted value of 10.5 billion with a market cap of 750,000,000 under 10%.
00:29:26.722 - 00:30:02.890, Speaker B: So under 10% totally issued. Arbitrum is coming in with a 12% AirDrop. So they are going to be a little bit ahead of optimism in total amount, actually live circulating and trading. And so they'll still have a lot more to go in terms of price discovery, optimism's. Price discovery is there's a lot of price discovery in the optimism token, like already baked in. Arbitrum is going to be about a little bit more ahead, but about the same. And so I think there's a lot more DeFi and financial activity on Arbitrum than optimism.
00:30:02.890 - 00:30:21.330, Speaker B: I think it's safe to assume. This is my estimation. I have no idea what the market is going to do. Obviously a like for like comparable of one to one for Arbitrum to optimism in polygon is very safe and conservative. I think it would be reasonable to assume a two to one valuation.
00:30:22.150 - 00:30:23.550, Speaker A: Two to one valuation.
00:30:23.630 - 00:30:31.478, Speaker B: So $2.25 for ARB, depending on how manic the community is and how many tokens they want to purchase on the.
00:30:31.484 - 00:30:47.786, Speaker A: Secondary, who knows and who knows what the initial price might be. Right? That's all up to the market to decide. We have a fantastic report that Bankless put out, if you want to get the details on that, because I think if you received AirDrop, the not financial advice question is, what do I do with it? Do I hold it? Do I sell it?
00:30:47.888 - 00:30:49.194, Speaker B: Definitely. Delegate it?
00:30:49.312 - 00:31:12.226, Speaker A: Definitely. Well, that would require not selling, sure, but yeah, I think you have to delegate the claim. However, arbitram's DeFi Moat. That is a really interesting thing for me personally. I would not sell my ARP tokens. I mean, layer two, we're holding that one. Just getting started, my friends.
00:31:12.226 - 00:31:37.386, Speaker A: And Arbitrum is one of the most promising layer twos out there. Not financial advice never is, of course, but we have some videos on the Bankless website you can go check out. We're talking to their team, we're recording that a little bit later. That should be live by the time you get this episode and the last thing I'll say is if you want an automatic notification system of when your Arbitrum AirDrop dropped, you just got to.
00:31:37.408 - 00:31:38.140, Speaker B: Go to.
00:31:39.890 - 00:32:07.926, Speaker A: Earni Fi. So that is E-A-R-N-I-F-I. Type in your Earnify is the ultimate AirDrop finder for you. Okay. It's like a super robot that just alerts you when you have an AirDrop in your particular address when you're eligible because most Airdrops people never get an opportunity to claim. So go check that out. There'll be a link in the show notes of course.
00:32:07.926 - 00:32:18.280, Speaker A: Earnify is a bankless property now so we're really excited about that tech and the value it's delivering to the bankless nation. Wow, cool.
00:32:20.570 - 00:32:26.346, Speaker B: It's nice to have fun things to talk about, fun and happy things. But now we're going to have to go on to the sad things.
00:32:26.528 - 00:32:38.330, Speaker A: This is a joint statement by the treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Those are all the big ones. Big gov telling us something on March twelveTH. Well is that Sunday? Did they issue that on a Sunday?
00:32:38.410 - 00:32:47.506, Speaker B: Sunday evening at 615 Eastern. Basically the last moment that they had to issue the statement before people were going to get real crazy monday morning when markets opened up.
00:32:47.528 - 00:32:59.382, Speaker A: All right, so what happened for people who didn't catch our episode that we did on Monday about the banking crisis, can you just give us the highlights of what actually happened from the last roll up until now?
00:32:59.516 - 00:34:20.458, Speaker B: So right after we recorded their last roll up, silicon Valley Bank had a run on the bank and people realized that this bank was going to legitimately run out of money to give to people that had cash in Silicon Valley Bank. And so that caused just a bunch of just fear because many of startups in the crypto space and just overall startups in general bank with Silicon Valley Bank, some of the startups that you and I Ryan, have invaded, invested in, have used Silicon Valley Bank as their bank no longer because that bank is gone. But people were very, very worried that this would create contagion. And so this run on the bank would create runs on other banks. Because the reason why Silicon Valley bank went under was because of a common theme, a common structure that many, many banks have, which is long dated securities, long dated maturity securities treasuries that are like ten year treasuries, five year treasuries, long term treasuries versus short term treasuries. And so when they bought these long term Treasuries and then the Federal Reserve jacked up interest rates, those long term Treasuries and other securities that were all like long term time horizons went down in value quite a lot. And so that created a big hole.
00:34:20.458 - 00:34:24.446, Speaker B: And then people needed to withdraw their cash at some point in time, and.
00:34:24.468 - 00:34:25.358, Speaker A: They did it fast.
00:34:25.444 - 00:34:29.460, Speaker B: And they did it fast well because people started to realize that there's not a lot of money left. So they had.
00:34:29.830 - 00:34:38.962, Speaker A: And because we can, it was social media. When the VCs are typing in all caps like there's a run on the know, withdraw your funds, guess what happens?
00:34:39.096 - 00:34:39.954, Speaker B: A run on the bank.
00:34:40.002 - 00:34:57.306, Speaker A: Yeah, people don't literally show up, although there were some people actually showing up at the branches of Silicon Valley Bank, but people are just withdrawing electronically, wire transfers, doing it as fast as possible. That's what the run on the bank was. So we had Silvergate, then Silicon Valley Bank, there was another one as well.
00:34:57.408 - 00:36:02.174, Speaker B: So this was the surprise in this statement here from the joint statement was that Signature Bank was also announced in this statement that they have also shuttered Signature Bank in addition to Silicon Valley Bank. So which surprise? The Fed. The FDIC and so not only did they take control, seize Silicon Valley Bank, and then here's the big thing about the statement, is that FDIC insurance, which is usually a quarter million dollars, they effectively just raised it to infinity for these two banks. So the Fed took over Silicon Valley and Signature Bank and said, hey, if you have money in this bank, even if it's over $250,000, you will totally be insured and we will give you your money back starting on Monday. And that's what quelled the fears and that's what stopped the bank. It's the Signature Bank shutdown, which was kind of a surprise because it wasn't Signature that had a run on the bank, it was Silicon Valley Bank. And so the Feds said that, well, Signature Bank was also under stress and so they seized that one as well.
00:36:02.292 - 00:36:21.122, Speaker A: All these banks that start with an S I think are cursed. So just quick recap. So last week, early last week, Silvergate Bank dead. That was a crypto focused bank. Next Silicon Valley Bank run on the bank that happened Friday was shut down. The Fed came in and then all weekend, everyone, the entire market was left to panic.
00:36:21.186 - 00:36:22.086, Speaker B: Right, right.
00:36:22.268 - 00:37:00.382, Speaker A: VC, trades office peg VC shouting like what's going to happen, what about the depositors? Everyone's panicking because they still have funds in Silicon Valley Bank and we don't know if depositors are going to have that deposit guaranteed. And then the Fed comes out late in the evening on Sunday before markets start, at least traditional markets start. Crypto is trading during this whole time, never shuts down. And they say, nope, depositors, we're going to make them whole for Silicon Valley Bank. Oh and by the way, we're shutting down preemptively Signature Bank. That's what this is. So the question is like signature bank.
00:37:00.382 - 00:37:07.394, Speaker A: Why Signature Bank? Was this a targeted attack or was Signature Bank just as weak as Silicon Valley Bank?
00:37:07.522 - 00:37:38.222, Speaker B: So when I read this statement, my initial reaction was, well, the reason why they would take over Silicon Valley Bank and promise infinite insurance to all depositors is because the worry of a contagion event of many, many runs on many banks is legitimate and that's why they would do this. So therefore it does make sense that there is another bank that is also under duress that is not sufficiently liquid to give depositors their money back. So that to me makes sense.
00:37:38.276 - 00:37:40.030, Speaker A: It could be signature, anything.
00:37:40.100 - 00:38:29.530, Speaker B: Right, right. Other takes have come out with other information that this was an opportunistic takedown of a crypto bank, which, if you take the other side of this perspective well, we were starting January and February talking about Operation Choke point two, point zero and how the Fed and the treasury was trying to come after politically banking services that would bank crypto customers. And so, well, now it kind of makes sense that they would do this regardless of the actual financial condition. And so people have passed this back and forth. And so this is part of this story here. Here's Nick Carter's take, which is talking about former Senator Barney Frank of Dodd Frank. The Dodd Frank Act openly admits that Signature was arbitrarily shuddered despite no insolvency because regulators wanted to kill off the last major pro crypto bank.
00:38:29.530 - 00:38:43.486, Speaker B: He is not a crypto person. He does not care about our industry. So this is like a decently unbiased take is that he said that there's no real objective reason that Signature bank had to be seized, which is a big statement from the Frank of Dodfrank.
00:38:43.518 - 00:39:03.370, Speaker A: To say this is Barney Frank, like pointing the finger at the Fed and the US government and saying this is a direct quote. I think part of what happened was that regulators wanted to send a very strong anti crypto message. Barney Frank saying this. This is not cryptozealot. Saying this, we became the poster boy because there was no insolvency based on the fundamentals.
00:39:03.710 - 00:39:07.718, Speaker B: The reason why he's saying we is because he is at Silvergate.
00:39:07.894 - 00:39:08.970, Speaker A: He's at signature.
00:39:09.550 - 00:39:09.974, Speaker B: Signature.
00:39:10.022 - 00:39:13.550, Speaker A: Oh, get our s's. There's so many S's here with these banks.
00:39:13.890 - 00:39:29.298, Speaker B: So officials, Fed officials saying crypto had nothing to do with a Signature takedown. But then in this article, it stated that any buyer of Signature bank who wants to buy this distress bank must agree to give up all the crypto businesses at that bank. Okay.
00:39:29.384 - 00:39:31.234, Speaker A: Oh my God, I didn't know that. Know that.
00:39:31.272 - 00:39:33.620, Speaker B: Not looking great. Not looking great.
00:39:34.790 - 00:39:52.210, Speaker A: The traditional way to kind of, I'm going to say bailout, but save depositors as a bank is to have a bigger bank buy it, buy all the depositors assets. Right. And this is saying that maybe any buyer of Signature has to agree to give up all the crypto business at the bank.
00:39:52.290 - 00:39:53.430, Speaker B: Businesses fail.
00:39:53.770 - 00:39:55.074, Speaker A: How is this legal?
00:39:55.202 - 00:40:11.274, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. So here is zero hedge commenting on that recent nick card undertake. Crypto is now a political issue. The Democrats want to crush it and the Republicans GOP will use that in 2024. We'll see what that happens when the election.
00:40:11.322 - 00:40:13.454, Speaker A: I hope this doesn't become a left versus right.
00:40:13.492 - 00:40:33.430, Speaker B: Thing is, Congressman Tom Emmer, Republican, saying, today I sent a letter to FDIC Chairman Grumberg regarding reports that the FDIC is weaponizing recent instability in the banking sector to purge legal activity from the United States. So tom Emmer, Member of Congress. Also, we are in talks with him about coming on bankless, so we will talk to him directly soon.
00:40:33.580 - 00:40:35.106, Speaker A: I think he's coming on next Friday.
00:40:35.138 - 00:40:59.738, Speaker B: David, but that is not all. So here's Jake Shravinsky tweeting out today, the Blockchain Association sent FOIA requests, that is, Freedom of Information Act requests to the Fed, the FDIC and OCC demanding information about the unlawful banking of crypto companies. We are collecting evidence of debanking. Share your story with us. And he gives an email to do that. Debanked@theblockchainassociation.org plus a thread.
00:40:59.738 - 00:41:19.430, Speaker B: So whether or not that this was a run on Signature Bank or this was a targeted political takedown of one of the few remaining crypto banks, sounds like we're going to get down to the bottom of it, because we have the blockchain association with Freedom of Information, because we live in a democracy, and also a congressman going after this as well.
00:41:19.500 - 00:41:21.862, Speaker A: So the Sleuths are on the case.
00:41:21.996 - 00:41:23.526, Speaker B: We will find this out.
00:41:23.628 - 00:42:00.094, Speaker A: We'll see if the allegations are true. Yeah, Jake Trevinsky here tweeting there are troubling reports of crypto companies having their bank accounts closed with no notice and explanation. And this is a disturbing trend suggesting that regulators are trying to cut crypto entirely out of the banking system. Not legal to target an industry like that and to target a specific set of depositors. David, let's go back to the USDC story, though, because that hit crypto. Of course, crypto didn't stop trading. USDC was still trading against other stablecoin assets, dropped down to $0.88.
00:42:00.094 - 00:42:14.902, Speaker A: We had Jeremy Alair on the podcast earlier, but this is his statement that he issued right after that Fed letter was sent out that all depositors at Silicon Valley and Signature Bank would be made whole. What's the story for USDC here?
00:42:14.956 - 00:42:57.394, Speaker B: Yeah, so I've pulled out three tweets out of his thread that I thought were worth stating. 100% of USDC reserves are safe and sound, and we will complete our transfer of remaining SVB Silicon Valley Bank cash to BNY Mellon much bigger, bigger bank. With the closure of Signature Bank announced tonight, we will not be able to process minting and redemptions through Signet, which is a product from Signature Bank. Signature Network is what it was. It was a product to facilitate inter customer transfers instantaneously inside of Signature Bank. So, like, Winter Mute, I believe, is a customer of Signet no longer because it's down. And so you could have instant bank transfers across clients since that is isn't Signet still up?
00:42:57.432 - 00:43:01.074, Speaker A: It's just being operated now by Mellon.
00:43:01.122 - 00:43:45.474, Speaker B: Apparently it's still up and running, but they are no longer depending on that. So they are now taking on settlements through BNY Mellon and then lastly, indeed, the Payment Stablecoin Act, which remains a very active pursuit in Congress, would enshrine a law, a regime where stablecoin funds, aka USDC, would be held with cash at the Fed and short term T bills. We need this law now more than ever if we truly want a safe financial system. I think it's worth noting that two banks that served Circle went down and Circle persists and is trading at a step ahead. All you got to do and now it's at BNY Mellon. Man and so they are just climbing the ladder of bigger and bigger and safer banks. Like USDC is an increasingly safe place.
00:43:45.512 - 00:44:04.490, Speaker A: To hold your money. Well, now, basically, one USDC is as good as a bank in a too big to fail financial banking system. Basically, you know, USDC is going to get deposit or bailed out if anything goes wrong as long as the US. Banking structure holds and as long as.
00:44:04.560 - 00:44:07.418, Speaker B: Don'T become overly draconian about crypto. Yeah, right.
00:44:07.504 - 00:44:14.458, Speaker A: Exactly. Anyway, the full story with Jeremy Alair is actually on the bankless podcast. I learned so much about USDC that.
00:44:14.464 - 00:44:19.998, Speaker B: Was one of the hardest, the most hard hitting 30 minutes podcast, a very short podcast. And he listened to it ROP in.
00:44:20.004 - 00:44:22.654, Speaker A: The yeah, he was like, here's what happened over the last five years.
00:44:22.772 - 00:44:27.506, Speaker B: Let me tell you two questions in 30 minutes. And he answered more questions than I had.
00:44:27.608 - 00:44:36.100, Speaker A: Yeah, go check that out. Of course, this is a centralized stablecoin. This is not a decentralized stablecoin. But that is still important in the crypto system as well.
00:44:36.470 - 00:44:41.186, Speaker B: Jeremy is a crypto person. He is our Trojan Horse into TradFi.
00:44:41.298 - 00:44:51.466, Speaker A: Yeah, that's how we do it. They're still paying ETH gas fees. They're still burning ETH, aren't they? Okay, so this contagion has maybe spread to Europe. What's the story here as we record this? David yeah.
00:44:51.488 - 00:45:00.486, Speaker B: So Credit Suisse under duress in Europe, credit Suisse perhaps not the most legitimate bank out there, perhaps did some money laundering.
00:45:00.518 - 00:45:02.910, Speaker A: Are you causing a run on the bank right now, David?
00:45:03.250 - 00:45:32.242, Speaker B: Perhaps could have facilitated more legitimate financial transactions. I don't know. Could have been better. Anyways, the shares of Credit Suisse hit all time lows, but then the stock price resurged because the Swiss central bank agreed to loan the bank up to 50 billion francs, $54 billion to bolster confidence in the country's second largest lender following the collapse of two other banks. Is the article. So Credit Suisse not looking great, but they also needed a bailout from a central bank.
00:45:32.386 - 00:45:50.554, Speaker A: The weak banks are shaky. Right. But I do think I mean, central banks, whatever country you're in, are going to bail out depositors. They can't afford to have banking contagion spread across all of their respective countries. So I think that's the story here. There's a story about stock prices of the big banks as well. What are we looking at here?
00:45:50.752 - 00:45:55.738, Speaker B: A bunch of lines going down into the right of JPMorgan. Bank of America.
00:45:55.754 - 00:45:56.138, Speaker A: Citigroup.
00:45:56.154 - 00:46:00.880, Speaker B: Wells Fargo, morgan Stanley, goldman Sachs. Not one of them is better than negative 10%.
00:46:02.050 - 00:46:36.490, Speaker A: Bank stock slide. Ryan Selkis had a take here while bank stock slide. What was crypto doing last week? Up 10%, down ten to 20% versus up 10% for crypto. Doesn't this expose is this a narrative trade? I think it's a few things. I think, one, it's a little bit of a narrative trade. People waking up and being like, well, how safe is my money? Number two, I think this indicates a more dovish Fed moving forward. How much can Powell actually increase rates? Which is, of course, good for risk on assets like crypto.
00:46:36.490 - 00:46:42.654, Speaker A: Here we go. Fed now. What is fed now? And how does that link to the story of what we've been talking about?
00:46:42.692 - 00:46:50.160, Speaker B: David, fed now is like, as close as you get to a CBDC without actually making a.
00:46:51.890 - 00:46:59.946, Speaker A: A it's not a CBDC in itself, is it? It's like a side chain for digital bank. Yes.
00:46:59.988 - 00:47:28.246, Speaker B: Yeah. It's like a transaction side chain for the Fed. Instant Payment Service from Fed Now, starting in July, aims to reduce the gap in payment time between United States financial institutions. This instant payment network will settle payments in seconds and support transactions between consumers, merchants, and banks. Does not rely on blockchain. So the conspiracy here, Ryan, is that Signature Bank was taken by the Fed. Conveniently, Fed Now service is announced.
00:47:28.358 - 00:47:34.542, Speaker A: Just rolling it out. Fed now is government tech, right?
00:47:34.676 - 00:47:36.330, Speaker B: It's government signet.
00:47:36.410 - 00:48:15.210, Speaker A: It's a government sidechain. It's like Signet made their own private side chain to facilitate these banking transactions and to settle kind of, I guess, crypto payments in the US. Banking system. This is Damon NAMM expressing that silvergate had silvergate exchange network signature had signet. Both were private networks for companies to transfer value between each other using digital assets. Where are both now? These companies enabled alternative currencies that threaten a CBDC and Fed now, that's the conspiracy theory that maybe the Feds were trying to take this new network down before it blossomed into something bigger.
00:48:15.950 - 00:48:19.030, Speaker B: I will leave this up to the imagination of the listener.
00:48:19.110 - 00:48:27.360, Speaker A: David is etha security. All right, this was buzzing last week as well, because New York Attorney General alleged that Ether is a security.
00:48:27.810 - 00:48:34.590, Speaker B: Someone who does not get to determine what a security is. Alleged that Ether is a security. That should be what the headline is.
00:48:34.660 - 00:48:36.946, Speaker A: Okay, so what's the take here? What's going on?
00:48:37.128 - 00:49:15.360, Speaker B: So the New York Attorney General is suing Kucoin, an exchange, saying that it violated securities laws by offering tokens that meet the definition of a security without registering with the Attorney General's office. What were those tokens? Luna? Well, no one's going to defend that one. UST and Ether, like, just lumping all those things together as if they're the same. And they have argued that Ether is a security. Why is Ether a security? Well, because the value of Ether is dependent on efforts of others, including co founder Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation, which man are we talking to a Bitcoin Maxi, or are we talking to the New York Attorney General? I can't tell the difference.
00:49:16.050 - 00:49:39.480, Speaker A: It's important to realize these are just court filings to try to prove a case. So it's not even necessarily cringe. Actually a statement. I feel like it made headlines because of the name. It's a New York Attorney General of the name, not that this is actually she doesn't have the power to do this. Basically, it'd just be like, me tweeting bitcoin is a security. I don't have the power to I declare a security.
00:49:39.480 - 00:49:51.400, Speaker A: Doesn't work like that, guys. This is pretty bad. Yeah, the statement, you can read the details, and there's some analysis this week of what happens if Ether is a security.
00:49:53.230 - 00:50:00.122, Speaker B: It's just an illegitimate question. Like, what happens if Ether is a security? Nothing's going to happen.
00:50:00.256 - 00:50:33.862, Speaker A: Well, I guess if somehow the US. Government all colludes as part of this extended operation choke Point to choke off crypto and somehow is able to declare Ether security and that is not defeated in the court system, then what happens? The US. Is eliminated from the crypto race. It's not going to kill Ethereum long term. And by the way, I think that I give the ODS of that happening, like 1%, 2% maybe. It's probably not worth thinking about. That's my current take.
00:50:33.862 - 00:50:35.014, Speaker A: I mean, I could be wrong about.
00:50:35.052 - 00:50:37.414, Speaker B: That, thinking about yeah, but it's just.
00:50:37.452 - 00:50:45.420, Speaker A: A lot of noise. And speaking of noise, gary Gensler is saying some of the same noise as well. What's Gary saying?
00:50:45.790 - 00:51:20.120, Speaker B: He's saying that proof of stake tokens are securities and so returns that token holders see from stakings indicate that these tokens are securities, according to Gensler, and would need to be registered under US. Securities laws, whether they're promoting or putting into a protocol and locking up their tokens in a protocol that often a small group of entrepreneurs and developing are developed. That often a small group of entrepreneurs and developers are developing, I would suggest that each of these token operators seek to come into compliance. And the same with the intermediaries at this point, this is just the Gary Stump speech, like, oh, crypto is security.
00:51:20.490 - 00:51:21.846, Speaker A: I declare a security.
00:51:21.948 - 00:51:27.366, Speaker B: I declare also Gary can't also. Does Gary get to determine who what is a security?
00:51:27.468 - 00:51:28.194, Speaker A: No, he doesn't.
00:51:28.242 - 00:51:33.398, Speaker B: No, not even Gary gets to determine that. What is that determined by courts? Right.
00:51:33.564 - 00:51:42.758, Speaker A: Am right. I mean, that one, it should be I think Gary can prosecute, but then he has to prove his case in court. Who are you going to prosecute with Ethereum?
00:51:42.854 - 00:51:45.770, Speaker B: How does that I guess Vital into court?
00:51:46.610 - 00:51:48.206, Speaker A: Man, I wouldn't like to see that.
00:51:48.228 - 00:51:50.906, Speaker B: But at some level to see Vitalik.
00:51:50.938 - 00:51:51.086, Speaker A: Okay.
00:51:51.108 - 00:52:00.498, Speaker B: So when Congress brings out I've seen Vitalik bring out clause sometimes, like against Bitcoin Maxis or when he claws in.
00:52:00.584 - 00:52:05.058, Speaker A: A way that's like, I'm going to rationally destroy your argument in front of.
00:52:05.064 - 00:52:24.842, Speaker B: You, sort of in a very concise way. I'm going to verbally pants you. Maybe that's the right way to do it. Verbally. Vitalik has I've seen Vitalik verbally pants people a number of times. It is just an absolute dream of daydream to imagine that he could be able to do that for Gary Gensler one time.
00:52:24.896 - 00:52:35.710, Speaker A: I think this could happen in Congress one day. But anyway, I don't want to put Vitalik in that situation. This is all stupid noise anyway. It's not worth anyone's time. David, we got a lot coming up next. What are we covering?
00:52:36.050 - 00:52:48.066, Speaker B: Starbucks sold 2000 NFTs inside of 20 minutes. We have a withdrawal date. Did you know that Ryan in the middle of the Arbitrum AirDrop? Like everyone's talking about Arbitrum today. We also got the date for I.
00:52:48.088 - 00:52:51.298, Speaker A: Just learned that by reading the roll up agenda today.
00:52:51.464 - 00:53:12.742, Speaker B: So we're going to talk about when withdrawals are going to be enabled. We're sadly we're going to have to talk about Euler and the hack there. And Aztec is sunsetting. Aztec connect. But perhaps for something better. So we're going to get to all these updates and more as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Uniswap is the largest on chain marketplace for self custody digital assets.
00:53:12.742 - 00:54:00.214, Speaker B: Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange, but you know this because you've been listening to Bankless. But did you know that the Uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat Onramp? Now, you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to Tokens in DFI inside of Uniswap. Not only that, but Polygon, Arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate, but that's just DFI. Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, letting you find more listings for the best prices across the NFT world. With Uniswap, you can sweep floors on multiple NFTs and Uniswap's universal router will optimize your gas fees for you. Uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across Ethereum, and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor. So go to app Uniswap.org
00:54:00.214 - 00:54:26.382, Speaker B: today to buy, sell or swap tokens and NFTs. The phantom wallet is coming to Ethereum. The number one wallet on Solana is bringing its millions of users and beloved UX to Ethereum and Polygon. If you haven't used Phantom before, you've been missing out. Phantom was one of the first wallets to pioneer Solana staking inside the wallet and will be offering similar staking features for Ethereum and Polygon. But that's just staking. Phantom is also the best home for your NFTs.
00:54:26.382 - 00:54:59.738, Speaker B: Phantom has a complete set of features to optimize your NFT experience, pin your favorites, hide your Uglies, burn the spam, and also manage your NFT sale listings from inside the wallet. Phantom is of course, a multi chain wallet but it makes chain management easy, displaying your transactions in a human readable format with automatic warnings for malicious transactions or phishing websites. Phantom has already saved over 20,000 users from getting scammed or hacked. So get on the Phantom Waitlist and be one of the first to access the MultiChain beta. There's a link in the show notes. Or you can go to Phantom app Waitlist to get access.
00:54:59.824 - 00:55:04.986, Speaker A: Here we go. When is the next Ethereum hard fork? David. When can I withdraw staked ETH?
00:55:05.098 - 00:55:15.726, Speaker B: Specifically at block number 6,209,536? That is your answer. Thank you. Maybe you're asking, when is that? Thank you.
00:55:15.748 - 00:55:18.802, Speaker A: Chat David. GPT. Very precise. Yeah.
00:55:18.856 - 00:55:30.182, Speaker B: That is going to be April twelveTH. So a little bit over. Under one month away from today. Today is the 16 March. April twelveTH is when withdrawals happen.
00:55:30.236 - 00:55:30.774, Speaker A: We have a date.
00:55:30.812 - 00:55:45.434, Speaker B: Lido, however, also has to upgrade its own smart contracts to enable withdrawals. To enable withdrawals. Right. And so Lido is targeting mid May to allow for Ether to come out of the Lido dow. So that's the news there.
00:55:45.472 - 00:55:51.502, Speaker A: So there could be a delay that's happening in May, even though the rest of the Ethereum protocol is upgrading earlier. Right?
00:55:51.556 - 00:55:52.014, Speaker B: Correct.
00:55:52.132 - 00:56:02.798, Speaker A: Gotcha. Let's talk about some sad news. This is, I think, really devastating for a really cool DeFi builder team, euler Labs. What happened, David? What's the news?
00:56:02.884 - 00:56:43.022, Speaker B: Yeah, Euler, it's a money market, kind of like Compound and Aave with some cool new mechanisms, much more governance minimized with new liquidation schemes that all of the big brains out there think is pretty cool. It was definitely growing in popularity. It was dominating in a Staked ETH world. Really great team. Ryan and I are investors in oiler, so disclaimer, I guess, for that $196,000,000 drained in Dai, USDC, Staked ETH and WBTC, this is so far the largest hack of 2023. And so they did their best to plug the hole, but not before 196,000,000.
00:56:43.076 - 00:56:45.440, Speaker A: How did it happen? How did it happen?
00:56:47.490 - 00:56:51.358, Speaker B: I'm beyond my capacity to understand the exploit here.
00:56:51.524 - 00:56:53.006, Speaker A: It was a flash loan.
00:56:53.118 - 00:57:04.100, Speaker B: Yeah, it was a flash loan to start and then some sort of exploit in the code. It has since been plugged, so that vulnerability is now gone.
00:57:05.350 - 00:57:46.146, Speaker A: But here's what's crazy. So they had audits six of their smart contract, six audits of their smart contract, and this functionality was existing eight months. So it had a lindy of about eight months live with tens of millions of dollars, and this whole amount has been drained. So a lot of DeFi users affected by Is, I should emphasize, some of the hacks that we've seen over the years are kind of like protocols that are just fast and loose. They don't take security into account, they're making obvious trade offs and they're obviously flawed. Euler is not one of those.
00:57:46.248 - 00:57:46.658, Speaker B: Right.
00:57:46.744 - 00:57:51.682, Speaker A: These are one of the teams that are doing it the right way. And it happened to them.
00:57:51.816 - 00:58:09.814, Speaker B: Yeah. When you. See six audits and it still gets hacked. That's just man, like smart contracts. The only good metaphor I've heard for smart contracts is they're like the steam engine. They just blow up a bunch and then one day they start working. This one, sadly, blew up.
00:58:09.932 - 00:58:27.002, Speaker A: Devastating. And I guess we have to emphasize, right, just DeFi is taking this on the chin. Of course this was a mistake. Obviously, there was a flaw in the way that this was constructed. And what we always end every episode with is crypto is risky, so is DeFi.
00:58:27.066 - 00:58:29.198, Speaker B: You could lose everything put in.
00:58:29.284 - 00:58:37.426, Speaker A: That's what we say. And this is another reminder of that. Be careful. In these new crypto ecosystems, the new frontier, people get hurt sometimes.
00:58:37.608 - 00:59:01.122, Speaker B: So Euler is offering a $1 million bounty that goes to anything that leads to the arrest of this hacker as of this morning. Ryan we are watching the funds go through tornado cash, which more or less indicates that the hacker has no intention of returning the funds whatsoever. The likelihood that this is North Korea is bit.
00:59:01.196 - 00:59:04.860, Speaker A: You think it could be a state actor? You think the FBI is on the.
00:59:05.950 - 00:59:18.826, Speaker B: Already they've they've talked to chain analysis, they've talked to law enforcement, they've talked to Coinbase's, like Chainalysis equivalent. I mean, the fact that it's immediately going through tornado cash, my money is on this is North Korea.
00:59:18.938 - 00:59:32.514, Speaker A: Wow. Upsetting, definitely. David. What about Aztec? So they are Sunsetting Aztec Connect. I don't think this is bad news necessarily, but I was confused when I saw this.
00:59:32.632 - 00:59:39.746, Speaker B: Yeah. People are like, oh, Aztec. They're getting shut down by law enforcement or regulators because they're a privacy protocol.
00:59:39.858 - 00:59:41.234, Speaker A: A layer two privacy protocol.
00:59:41.282 - 01:00:13.086, Speaker B: Yes. So, like tornado cash, but if it was in a whole entire chain so they are Sunset Aztec Connect and ZK Pay. Aztec Pay, which is like basically tornado cash, but better. But they are doing this to build a next generation encrypted ZK roll up. And so they are basically sunsetting this thing that was a really good stepping stone for what is about to come, which is probably like the most sophisticated privacy technology on ethereum. And so this is just the prelude to that, if you will.
01:00:13.188 - 01:00:19.940, Speaker A: NFT stuff. Starbucks sold 2000 NFTs in 20 minutes. This is pretty big, what happened here?
01:00:20.390 - 01:00:31.862, Speaker B: 2000 NFTs priced at $100 each. Sold out in 20 minutes. 2000 digital stamps. Journey stamps. I can't say that I know what these do.
01:00:31.996 - 01:00:34.194, Speaker A: Yeah. Did they get you coffee? They don't get you coffee.
01:00:34.242 - 01:00:36.006, Speaker B: I don't know what they get.
01:00:36.188 - 01:00:44.540, Speaker A: Let me look at these. Journey stamps. Secondary marketplace. Look at this floor price of $650. They're very pretty.
01:00:45.550 - 01:00:46.490, Speaker B: Those are pretty.
01:00:46.560 - 01:00:48.838, Speaker A: It's like the Starbucks mermaid.
01:00:48.934 - 01:00:49.482, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:00:49.616 - 01:00:50.754, Speaker A: Different manifestations.
01:00:50.902 - 01:00:52.960, Speaker B: Yeah. What do they get you?
01:00:53.650 - 01:00:56.030, Speaker A: What do they get you? Starbucks clout.
01:00:58.130 - 01:01:02.490, Speaker B: Starbucks odyssey Member You can join a waitlist, so something about a Starbucks Odyssey.
01:01:02.570 - 01:01:02.942, Speaker A: All right.
01:01:02.996 - 01:01:06.190, Speaker B: I mean, Starbucks doesn't have great coffee, but they hey, they got great NFT.
01:01:06.270 - 01:01:09.858, Speaker A: Too much of a coffee snog to buy this Starbucks. NFD exactly right.
01:01:09.944 - 01:01:10.194, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:01:10.232 - 01:01:17.534, Speaker A: Epic, the creators of Fortnite have also close to 20 crypto games in their store pipeline. That's pretty big, David.
01:01:17.662 - 01:01:41.578, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, so over the last like six, nine months, I've been like, oh, everyone's talking about crypto. Gaming is the next big thing. And I was like, okay, that's a fun narrative. Let's see if it plays out. After going to ETH Denver, after hearing news like this and talking to some other people about what's going on, this in my mind has gone from narrative to no, this is real. There was a game at ETH Denver that was absolutely beautiful.
01:01:41.578 - 01:01:49.614, Speaker B: For those who like Dark Souls, it looked a lot like Dark Souls that all the assets in the game were NFTs on a blockchain. I'm like that. Did not know.
01:01:49.652 - 01:02:09.490, Speaker A: All I got to say is, well balanced economic games are fun. They're just fun. Even when I'm playing, crypto feels like a game sometimes it's just one giant economic game and it's a lot of fun. It's cool that Epic is doing stuff here. On the opposite end of the spectrum, though, meta is ending NFT support on Instagram.
01:02:09.570 - 01:02:11.078, Speaker B: Meta what?
01:02:11.244 - 01:02:32.278, Speaker A: Instagram? It seemed like only yesterday you just deployed this this product news from product lead at Meta, some product news across the company. We're looking closely at what we prioritize, including our focus. We're winding down digital collectibles to focus on other ways to support creators, people, and businesses. I'm disappointed by this.
01:02:32.384 - 01:02:35.854, Speaker B: Yeah. Were people just not using it very much?
01:02:35.972 - 01:02:39.310, Speaker A: I don't know. Maybe people weren't using it. Maybe.
01:02:39.380 - 01:02:40.202, Speaker B: Kind of a bummer.
01:02:40.266 - 01:02:56.594, Speaker A: I mean, they got in at the top and they're leaving at the bottom. The simple take is just tourists are tourists and settlers are settlers. And it seems like Meta is maybe acting like a tourist in crypto right now.
01:02:56.712 - 01:03:16.646, Speaker B: Man well, they say at the bottom of this, they say and look forward to supporting the many NFT creators who use Gold pass it but they said looking forward to support. Yeah. Who using Instagram and Facebook to amplify their work. Well, but you just took away the feature. They support you though, like, morally.
01:03:16.838 - 01:03:35.950, Speaker A: I don't know. My take is this is a big opportunity for web3 social. If web two social is going to say bye bye to NFTs, that's fine. It's bigger opportunity for decentralized networks. This is, by the way, like the same week that Meta and Zuckerberg announced that they're going to build some sort of decentralized social media thing.
01:03:36.020 - 01:03:37.514, Speaker B: Right. Some Twitter alternative.
01:03:37.642 - 01:03:38.734, Speaker A: All confusing to me.
01:03:38.772 - 01:04:12.970, Speaker B: Well, speaking to that fourth tweet because this doesn't make any sense, let me be clear. Creating opportunities for creators and businesses to connect with their fans and monetize remains a priority. And we're going to focus on areas that we can make impact at scale, such as messaging and monetization opportunities for reels. Maybe I am an NFT daydreamer optimist. Yes, you are, but this seems to be the opposite of that. Hey, we're going to not do anything in web3, and we're going to go back to web two and focus on that to help support our creators.
01:04:13.050 - 01:04:22.282, Speaker A: Pretty regressive. Tourists leave, settlers stay. That's all I got to say. It's a good time to shout out the bankless collectors. We're doing experiments in NFTs and collectibles.
01:04:22.346 - 01:04:24.910, Speaker B: It's working for us. Meta. We're doing it just fine.
01:04:24.980 - 01:04:28.146, Speaker A: Look at the top collectors here. Should we shout them out for a second? Absolutely.
01:04:28.328 - 01:04:36.142, Speaker B: Who do we got here? How many podcasts have we actually tokenized yet? I think like six or excuse me, like ten or every Monday.
01:04:36.206 - 01:04:40.726, Speaker A: And then we did five last year. Our Genesis collection. Who are the top collectors, though? You want to read them out?
01:04:40.828 - 01:04:50.226, Speaker B: Liword ETH. We've just figured out how to pronounce his name. Liberty 36. Tokens. 36. Coming in at number 136. Coming in at number two.
01:04:50.226 - 01:05:09.790, Speaker B: At 32. Tokens is Landrin ETH. So thank you for guys, for being one and two. The race is on. We also got Coker ETH at 20 tokens, Vault, Dietercrux ETH and Automagic ETH 2019 and 18 tokens. So they're the top five collectors. We really appreciate the support, guys.
01:05:09.860 - 01:05:18.930, Speaker A: Thank you. Bankless nation collectors. Fidelity Crypto quietly went live, giving millions of retail customers access to bitcoin and ether.
01:05:20.310 - 01:05:21.214, Speaker B: This one was quiet.
01:05:21.262 - 01:05:22.014, Speaker A: This was a quiet.
01:05:22.062 - 01:05:23.550, Speaker B: Uniswap was not quiet.
01:05:23.710 - 01:05:34.534, Speaker A: This was quiet. Okay, so Fidelity is absolutely massive. 37 million retail accounts. What do they do? They just added a buy button for bitcoin and ether inside of their app.
01:05:34.652 - 01:05:35.250, Speaker B: Bullish.
01:05:35.330 - 01:05:37.718, Speaker A: Where are they custodying this? David, do you know this?
01:05:37.884 - 01:05:38.614, Speaker B: I do not know.
01:05:38.652 - 01:05:43.754, Speaker A: I think Fidelity has their own custody thing, too. Don't they wonder if they're using that or something like Coinbase? I don't know.
01:05:43.792 - 01:05:54.974, Speaker B: I do not know. I do not know. I mean, this isn't bullish yet because no offense to Fidelity customers, but I will call them the herd. They're not early.
01:05:55.172 - 01:05:57.070, Speaker A: Hey, I'm a Fidelity customer.
01:05:57.220 - 01:06:16.734, Speaker B: Yeah, but you also have a Kraken account, I'm assuming. So where do you do your buys, Ryan? In Fidelity or so the people that are buying, like, the idea is that when the herd does come, they don't have to leave and they can stay inside of their close comfy cozy zone of protection, which is Fidelity with the buy button for Ether.
01:06:16.862 - 01:06:27.746, Speaker A: When MetaMask integration fidelity. When are you doing that? When can I sign in with ethereum? All right, what do we got? Releases uniswap on the BNB chain.
01:06:27.858 - 01:06:30.680, Speaker B: That happened, and that's the story.
01:06:31.610 - 01:06:51.438, Speaker A: All right. We also have a raise this week we wanted to mention. Soul Wallet, backed with $3 million. Aims to bring self hosted crypto wallets to the next billion. Big fan of smart contract wallets. I think we are going to see a wallet renaissance. Do we want to call a wallet summer, because if we do, it's going to be two years later that it actually happens.
01:06:51.524 - 01:06:52.510, Speaker B: But it does happen.
01:06:52.580 - 01:07:06.614, Speaker A: It will happen. There will be a wallet summer. Maybe Seoul will be included in that. But we're starting to see a lot of smart contract wallet and wallet funding in general. It's really exciting to see great teams doing this. And this is from a previous bankless guest, right?
01:07:06.732 - 01:07:19.810, Speaker B: Yeah. So whoever listened to the layer zero with JJ Xi Zhang? Zhang, who descended out of China because he worked for Baidu, which is TikTok's parent company, and he isn't it tencent.
01:07:19.890 - 01:07:21.654, Speaker A: Not Baidu. Not wrong about that.
01:07:21.692 - 01:07:22.694, Speaker B: I thought it was Baidu.
01:07:22.742 - 01:07:23.530, Speaker A: Okay. I don't know.
01:07:23.600 - 01:07:25.462, Speaker B: I mean, did you comment, Ryan?
01:07:25.526 - 01:07:29.482, Speaker A: I did. I don't remember, though, but I think it was Baidu commenter, correct us.
01:07:29.616 - 01:07:52.594, Speaker B: Yeah, but he refused to build an algorithm that could identify Uyghurs for Baidu, basically because the Chinese government wanted to suppress them. And he was like, I don't agree with that. Now he lives in San Francisco and is building a smart contract wallet. And Ryan and I are investors in Soul Wallet as well, because we believe in it.
01:07:52.712 - 01:08:11.218, Speaker A: Fantastic jobs this week, guys. Check them out on the bankless jobs board. I'll read a few. A marketing manager at Rise, a sales development representative for Web Three, and crypto at Rise as well. Uniswap hiring like crazy. Senior product designer. They need an application security engineer and a senior mobile engineer that is React native.
01:08:11.218 - 01:08:18.970, Speaker A: All the jobs are always available for you at Bankless Palette.com. Go check them out, David. We got questions coming up. We got takes coming up. What else?
01:08:19.040 - 01:08:59.974, Speaker B: And what else after that? Of course, what you and I are bullish on, it might perhaps have to do with Layer Twos, I don't know. And of course, the meme of the week. So all of this and more as soon as we get back from some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible. Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web Three landscape.

01:10:41.712 - 01:11:06.722, Speaker A: With the questions of the week from the Bankless Nation. You can ask those in the Bankless Discord if you are a citizen as USDC starts looking more and more like a state backed currency. Totally agree there. Do you trust it? More or less. I feel like I trust the Fed to prop it up like any other bank, but does that go with the vision of decentralization? Xerox, Caesar, Severus asked this question, so.
01:11:06.776 - 01:11:44.042, Speaker B: I think this starts off a very big conversation. And one part is do we trust USDC? The second part is how much do we want our DFI ecosystem to depend on the USDC? So USDC looking more and more like a state backed currency? 100%. Do I trust it? More or less. I trust it to be $1 and to always be able for me to have a claim on $1 of value. More and more and more it is becoming closer to being the CBDC that will never actually come about from the central bank. It is doing like this backdoor strategy.
01:11:44.106 - 01:11:45.354, Speaker A: It's a proto CDBC.
01:11:45.402 - 01:11:55.902, Speaker B: It's a protoc and that's very bullish for it being strong guarantees about always having $1 no matter what happens, even if cryptography gets broken.
01:11:55.966 - 01:12:02.850, Speaker A: For example, it's close to the base layer of the money printer, basically. It's always going to be redeemable, it seems like.
01:12:02.920 - 01:12:22.334, Speaker B: And it is doing its job of being $1 no matter what the back end looks like. So I trust that more and more and more every single day. And I think the market is going to understand that too. Like people who sold USDC at $0.88, they're going to remember that if USDC ever loses its peg again, USCC is starting to become antifragile.
01:12:22.402 - 01:12:24.506, Speaker A: It's coming up stronger out of this, right?
01:12:24.528 - 01:12:58.754, Speaker B: So I trust it more and more and more. Does that go with the vision of decentralization? We watched Dai DPEG because it was dependent on USDC. A lot of DeFi apps don't actually ingest Oracles for USDC price. They make it an implicit assumption that one USDC is $1, which is making DeFi. And all apps that do that enshrine USDC as $1. In the same way that USDC is trying to become enshrined in the Fed.
01:12:58.802 - 01:13:01.906, Speaker A: As the proto CBDC makes DeFi a bit more fragile.
01:13:02.018 - 01:13:39.266, Speaker B: It makes DeFi more dependent on the Federal Reserve and more dependent on USDC. Is that good? Well, it depends on how radical you are, I think. And so I'm of the opinion that our current financial system and our new financial system will integrate and hopefully be friendly with each other. Other people are more radical than myself and they say not $1, rye not die. Even to this point, some people don't like how USDC is inside of MakerDAO. Everyone finds themselves on a particular place in the spectrum. I think it is definitely something to be wary about.
01:13:39.266 - 01:13:52.434, Speaker B: But I do think that accepting USDC and allowing for it to grow does offer very big adoption tailwinds from people who we would otherwise not be able to convince about crypto. What's your take on this, Ryan?
01:13:52.482 - 01:14:29.170, Speaker A: My take on it is USDC is generally good for crypto because the more USDC that is settled on crypto networks like Ethereum, the more gas fees they pay and the more our decentralized native currency, currency like ethereum. Ether, the asset can thrive and grow. Every time somebody transacts with USDC on ethereum, they pay tax to ETH holders, which increases the value of ether. So like backdoor we win. We don't get that sort of treatment in the US banking system. So it's totally a net win for crypto. Now, does that mean we should become dependent on it? Absolutely not.
01:14:29.170 - 01:15:00.870, Speaker A: But you got to look at the long game here. The long game is we are only going to have two types of digital currencies. Type one is central bank digital currencies, of which USDC is a proto version of that. It's like that. Type two is crypto, internet native, real, non central bank backed assets. The best assets that fit that profile right now are ether and bitcoin. Those are the only two assets kind of in the running for that sort of treatment.
01:15:00.870 - 01:15:46.038, Speaker A: And then you can create more stable derivatives on top of them. And so that's the bifurcation. As long as we preserve both, and as long as our decentralized native currencies get stronger and stronger over time, we are winning relative to the position we are in. So I would much rather see the Fed adopt something like USDC that pays transaction fees to Ethereum than to go the Chinese central bank route of creating their own blockchain network and their own super central bank digital currency and not deploying on a decentralized network entirely. It's good. It's not perfect, but it's better than them not doing it. So it's a net win for crypto.
01:15:46.134 - 01:16:05.470, Speaker B: Right? I think USDC is more of a Trojan horse for crypto into TradFi than it is for, like, the Fed. I think Jeremy Alair is a crypto person more than he is a banker. Although he is a banker, he is more of a crypto person.
01:16:05.540 - 01:16:06.250, Speaker A: He's a crypto.
01:16:06.330 - 01:16:07.454, Speaker B: He's on our side.
01:16:07.572 - 01:16:18.422, Speaker A: He's on our side. Well, look at if you have USDC, how much? So, by the way, USDC is basically I count USDC as it's just as secure as a dollar in my Wells Fargo account. It's kind of one and the same.
01:16:18.476 - 01:16:24.562, Speaker B: Except it almost was more secure than dollars inside of Silicon Valley bank and signature bank.
01:16:24.626 - 01:16:45.162, Speaker A: So this dollar is now it's tokenized. And guess what? I have easy access to trade this dollar anytime on a decentralized exchange called uniswap. In fact, that's why we saw uniswap volume out there. So it's another on ramp to crypto. I can't do that with my Wells Fargo dollar. I can't go on uniswap and do my savings account dollar. Trade that with ETH.
01:16:45.162 - 01:16:56.718, Speaker A: I can with USDC. We could go on about this, but I think you guys get the point. This is why we are still excited about stablecoin adoption. Even if it's not fully decentralized, it's still in the win category.
01:16:56.894 - 01:17:16.360, Speaker B: You know, when the FBI went to Apple and was like, hey, let us through the backdoor of this person's phone, and Apple no F off. I hope that that's what USDC does for its holders. As in, like, somebody comes in and say, hey, blacklist this address, and USDC is like, give me a court order to do that. Right.
01:17:16.810 - 01:17:34.634, Speaker A: Even if they don't. Well, let's talk about the reason Apple does that. Because if they don't, people abandon the it's bad for shareholders. People abandon iPhone. If USDC does start blacklisting, guess what? We abandon it in a heartbeat. Right? Trade my USDC for some ETH. It's easy on uniswap.
01:17:34.634 - 01:17:47.154, Speaker A: See you later. Or another stablecoin that doesn't do that. See, now the bankers are playing in our world, in our game market forces. Yeah. If they adopt crypto protocols, they adopt crypto values. That is the backdoor here. That's what Dave and I believe.
01:17:47.154 - 01:17:50.706, Speaker A: Anyway, we got another question here. This one is from sneak up.
01:17:50.808 - 01:18:18.774, Speaker B: Yeah. Can you clearly differentiate ZK and optimistic rollups and the different narratives they hold? Oh, that clearly Prefects is doing a lot of work here. So optimistic roll ups, think of them as a fractal off of ethereum. They are ethereum. But as a layer two, they do everything that ethereum does and they settle down to ethereum. Ethereum as a layer two. A ZK roll up is ethereum with zero knowledge.
01:18:18.774 - 01:19:07.020, Speaker B: Cryptography as a layer two. Man getting to the nuances of this is actually pretty hard. Think of ethereum with ten x, better cryptography and compression and faster and cheaper fees that allow you to have so much computational resource that the limitations for putting almost anything on chain are basically gone. And so, for example, you will see web3 games on an optimistic roll up, like Arbitrum or optimism. And what that means is that there are games that have assets inside of them. On ZK roll ups you will have fully on chain games where the game engines and game logic themselves are actually smart contracts. That is perhaps one way to illustrate this.
01:19:07.020 - 01:19:08.314, Speaker B: That's all I got.
01:19:08.352 - 01:19:40.402, Speaker A: Ryan that makes sense, I think if you are a bankless listener and you want to go down the crypto rabbit hole a little bit and when I say crypto, I mean cryptography. Go check out an episode we did probably, I don't know, a year, year and a half ago, maybe longer. David with Justin Drake. It's called Moon Math. And that, I think, is the philosophy around this. What David was saying is there's two types of ways to sort of scale things in crypto. One is economic games that we can play like fraud proofs.
01:19:40.402 - 01:20:06.240, Speaker A: This is what optimistic technology does. And the other is pure math. Pure moon Math. Pure cryptography. And that is what ZK roll ups do. Anyway, if you want some more context for that, you'll find it there. But ZK technology is kind of the Moon Math equivalent way where we get all of the crypto economic guarantees, but through cryptography rather than having to pay for it.
01:20:06.240 - 01:20:09.998, Speaker A: David we got some takes of the week. Let's take this first one.
01:20:10.164 - 01:20:33.490, Speaker B: What's this, Jim? I'm going to skip the first part of this tweet. Jim tweets out banks are sovereign roll ups that post data availability to the Fed. I think that's a great take. Okay. Sovereign roll ups, as in they control their own ledger. A bank is a sovereign roll up. It has control over its own ledger and that it posts data availability to the Fed.
01:20:33.490 - 01:20:41.974, Speaker B: So it takes the state of that ledger and tells the Fed about it. That is a sovereign roll up with data availability posting to the Fed and.
01:20:42.012 - 01:21:05.954, Speaker A: It'S actually works out quite literally. We were talking earlier about Fed now technology, which is basically a big settlement chain. That is the chain through which these bank sovereign roll up ledgers actually post to they post back to Fed now, right? Yeah, accurate. David this is a tweet from you. The crypto class of 21 and 22 have really earned their stripes. God, I'll say. Yeah, we have, haven't we? Yeah.
01:21:06.072 - 01:21:30.370, Speaker B: 3 Hours Capital Liquidation voyager Celsius, FTX, a bank crisis of our banks, the banks that we actually care about now oiler man. In the first half of 2022, I was like, man, these kids got it easy. And then the second half of 2022 came, I was like, oh, man, these guys got it rough.
01:21:30.450 - 01:21:30.930, Speaker A: Totally.
01:21:31.010 - 01:21:39.946, Speaker B: And so I follow up with this tweet saying, in 2025, when you're all millionaires, they will say that you got lucky. Remember what it took to get to there.
01:21:40.048 - 01:21:41.734, Speaker A: Nice. Sweet. Not financial advice.
01:21:41.782 - 01:21:57.194, Speaker B: Not financial advice. Yeah, I don't know how that's financial advice, but it probably is somehow. Ryan Shad Adams tweets out a whole bunch. We just had podcasts. We just read our own tweets. We should do more of these. A whole bunch of tech entrepreneurs and builders just learned why we need crypto.
01:21:57.194 - 01:21:59.666, Speaker B: I wonder what they're going to do next. What do you mean by this?
01:21:59.688 - 01:22:54.974, Speaker A: Ren I do think that's part of the narrative shift that we're seeing here is like, you have the startup bank of the United States of Silicon Valley, basically, and all of the founders of all of these startups just got temporarily unbanked and then permanently unbanked. Didn't know whether they were going to get rug pulled or not from all of their they have to stop and think these are builders, these are engineers. These are people who want to create a different world and have the skills and talent to actually do that. I think some of them, some portion of that population probably got crypto pilled last weekend, and maybe some portion of them will understand why we're here, why crypto exists in the first place, and will use some of those skills to help us build out this crypto future. That's what I mean. This is when you learn, right, when PayPal locks you up. Remember Paul Krugman? Last week? He was like he didn't say, now I understand crypto.
01:22:54.974 - 01:23:11.946, Speaker A: He got locked out of PayPal, though. Now he knows what the use case is. He's probably going to consider that the next time he assesses what we're trying to do here with uncensorable financial transactions and the value of that bullish. There we go. Speaking of bullish, David, what are you bullish on, man?
01:23:12.128 - 01:23:31.690, Speaker B: I am bullish Ryan, on layer twos. But here's what I mean by that. Arbitrum finally Releases Token It's like the most anticipated AirDrop of all time. In 1 hour from right now. I don't know why I'm saying this. 1 hour from right now, Ryan, you and I are live streaming with the Arbitrum team. So all the listeners that is already live and available for you to go consume.
01:23:31.690 - 01:23:44.594, Speaker B: Op Stack already has two major chains. Coinbase is building on the op stack. We have two ZKE EVMs launching in the next ten days. We haven't even talked about that.
01:23:44.712 - 01:23:48.098, Speaker A: Do people know about that? Do they remember that? Two in ten days?
01:23:48.184 - 01:24:12.714, Speaker B: Yes. Main net, ZKE, EVM, main nets we haven't even talked about. Everyone's focused on the arbitrary AirDrop people are forgetting about the Zkevm are getting launched. And those are going to have tokens, too, by the way. Well, one of them is polygon, so that token already exists. There's also some alpha, an embargoed thing that I am recording don't say tomorrow. Don't say that will be released on Monday about layer twos.
01:24:12.714 - 01:24:21.678, Speaker B: So that's happening. Like, man, all of the innovation is happening in layer twos. We said layer two summer was going to happen. When did we say that?
01:24:21.844 - 01:24:25.150, Speaker A: 2021, I think. We called the first layer two summer.
01:24:26.150 - 01:24:28.130, Speaker B: We called it the second one. Here we are.
01:24:28.200 - 01:24:30.100, Speaker A: But we're calling it for 2023.
01:24:30.470 - 01:24:44.994, Speaker B: It is currently happening. This is what layer two summer looks like. Perhaps two years late. Sorry. But here we are. I'm bullish on layer twos.
01:24:45.042 - 01:24:58.010, Speaker A: Yeah, it's super bullish. I think it's played out how we hoped it might and down to do you remember that episode we did about the modular blockchain thesis? Yeah. This playing out. That was a while ago, but it's playing out that way.
01:24:58.080 - 01:24:59.066, Speaker B: Cool. What are you bullish on?
01:24:59.088 - 01:25:04.330, Speaker A: Ryan david I am bullish on regulators that do their jobs.
01:25:04.410 - 01:25:06.766, Speaker B: Oh, how many of their let me.
01:25:06.788 - 01:25:34.214, Speaker A: Introduce you to Hester Purse. All right. She is an SEC commissioner and the antithesis of Gary Gensler. You know, it occurred to me when Bankless put out this Tweet, I was like, we spend a lot of time on Gary Gensler in our roll ups and our content and just his crypto. We really do spend too much time on him. I want to take a minute to just thank regulators who are actually doing their job. Hester Purse is one of them.
01:25:34.214 - 01:25:53.754, Speaker A: She is a certified American badass. She is principled. She is smart. She's willing to engage the crypto community, and we are lucky to have her. I am thankful for this person that was, I think, re echoed to me as we had this interview. We had a conversation with her earlier in this week. That episode is going to come out on Monday.
01:25:53.882 - 01:25:55.882, Speaker B: It's already out for citizens.
01:25:55.946 - 01:26:10.242, Speaker A: She just calls it like it is. She's very honest. We asked her questions like, what is a security? She's like, you know, I don't know. And I don't think the SEC has done a good job actually communicating with any clarity on this. Right.
01:26:10.296 - 01:26:13.682, Speaker B: She said, sorry, I know this is what you're excited about.
01:26:13.736 - 01:26:14.674, Speaker A: No, say it.
01:26:14.792 - 01:26:23.222, Speaker B: She said that the SEC is primarily interested in increasing its jurisdictional reach. She just said it how it was.
01:26:23.276 - 01:26:53.646, Speaker A: Flat out said it. She said focused on that rather than what they should be focused on, which is principles. And I just want to be thankful for regulators that are actually doing their job. And this is a broader thing that I think is important for us to realize in the United States, and I think across the world, there is a growing frustrated majority that just wants everyone else to behave like grownups. Right. Stop playing the power games and let's. Actually build something for the future.
01:26:53.646 - 01:27:49.598, Speaker A: Let's actually build something we care about. Hester, in the conversation described a scenario which it just seems so simple, but in some way it was also a utopia of just like, the crypto community and regulators coming together and having a conversation about imagine that. About a new asset class and how this should be governed and regulated moving to the features and what parts were really decentralized, what parts were centralized, where the scammers and bad actors were and how regulators could go side by side in the crypto industry and move this technology of freedom forward. Wow. That can actually happen. And I think there is a majority of people who are sick of our institutions failing us, sick of the power games, want to get back to building a productive society. And so I'm just happy and bullish that people like this exist and I'm thankful for our good regulators.
01:27:49.598 - 01:27:52.210, Speaker A: They don't get enough credit and I think they should.
01:27:52.360 - 01:28:01.094, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. As much as people like Gary Gensler make us lose our faith in humanity, people like hester purse build it right back.
01:28:01.212 - 01:28:03.910, Speaker A: There you go. Meme of the week. David, what are we looking at?
01:28:03.980 - 01:28:14.818, Speaker B: Meme of the week. This is from CMS Holdings. Doe Kwan makes basis cash and 17 dominoes later, the US. Banking section is available. Thanks, Doe.
01:28:14.914 - 01:28:18.502, Speaker A: That was his original stablecoin, by the way. Fun fact if you didn't realize that.
01:28:18.556 - 01:28:21.226, Speaker B: Yeah, that was the one domino before terra luna.
01:28:21.338 - 01:28:32.654, Speaker A: Absolutely. Guys, we got to end it here. None of this has been a financial advice. It never is. Got to reemphasize that crypto is risky. So is DeFi. You could lose what you put in the banking system.
01:28:32.654 - 01:28:35.034, Speaker A: Is kind of risky though, too. But we are headed west.
01:28:35.082 - 01:28:35.834, Speaker B: Everything is risky.
01:28:35.882 - 01:28:41.180, Speaker A: It's all risky. This is the journey that we're on. It's the bankless journey. And we're glad you're with us today. Thanks so much.
