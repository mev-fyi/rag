00:00:00.090 - 00:00:08.410, Speaker A: Ooh, yes. Here we go. Six individuals are suing the Treasury Department and Coinbase is footing the bill and basically coordinating everything. Here we go. Nice job, Coinbase.
00:00:08.570 - 00:00:15.290, Speaker B: So six individual citizens like you and I, and they are funding, they're paying the legal bills for these individuals. It's badass.
00:00:15.450 - 00:00:17.738, Speaker A: Super Chad. Super Chad of Coinbase.
00:00:17.834 - 00:00:24.346, Speaker B: Coinbase to do this, they don't have to do this. This is crypto native values above and beyond, in my opinion. Pretty excited overall.
00:00:24.378 - 00:00:56.346, Speaker A: I actually do expect this to be like expected value, positive for Coinbase from brand perspective, but also ensuring that Coinbase can integrate with other defi projects. Coinbase's legal officer told CNBC it sets a dangerous precedent. If this code can be designated without any limits imposed by law, any technology, any tool or system could be fair game for also being banned. So this is what I was saying is like, maybe Coinbase is cool with tornado cash being banned, but they know more than tornado cash. And so in order to protect their future business models, ones that might not be alive today, they are doing this. Thank you. Thank you, Coinbase.
00:00:56.346 - 00:00:56.540, Speaker A: Well done.
