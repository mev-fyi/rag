00:00:04.490 - 00:00:04.846, Speaker A: What's up?
00:00:04.868 - 00:00:47.370, Speaker B: Coordination? How you doing? We are continuing our series on civil resistance. Viva la civil resistance. The point of civil resistance is to get to more one human, one vote dows, more democratic dows that could enable genie coefficient measurements. Ubi quadratic voting, quadratic funding and I have as a guest on the pod today, Victor from human node, which is a quite interesting civil resistance project. They are working on a biometric approach to civil resistance and have a decentralized network that they're going to be launching soon related to that. So Victor is extremely smart. He's got skills in all these different areas and is pushing forward human node, which is one human, one node system.
00:00:47.370 - 00:00:53.354, Speaker B: So I hope that you enjoy this episode with Victor from Humannote. I found it quite interesting. Enjoy.

00:02:40.004 - 00:02:43.150, Speaker B: All right, I am here with Victor from Humanode. What's up, Victor?
00:02:43.490 - 00:02:44.494, Speaker A: Hey, doing great.
00:02:44.532 - 00:02:45.866, Speaker D: How about you, Kevin?
00:02:46.058 - 00:02:55.250, Speaker B: Pretty good, yeah. I'm really excited to talk to you about human node. So, can you tell me how you got into crypto and how you came to be a part of human node?
00:02:56.010 - 00:03:43.394, Speaker D: Well, crypto was pretty on hype at our university in 2013, that's when we got it. But there was nothing but bitcoin and a few others. So we didn't really get into that full time until the smart contracts became a thing. In 2016, when we started to research nonstop, we gathered team of analysts still working there. And actually, now we're doing not only crypto research, but on other convergent sciences, because the innovation is always in between. Right now had a few projects in crypto. The previous one was to facilitate the staking, basically for regular users to make it easy.
00:03:43.394 - 00:04:16.030, Speaker D: But since 2017, me and my founder, Dato co founder for ten years already, we clearly understood that, unfortunately, the crypto infrastructure is not pretty decentralized due to its capitalistic nature. And we always wanted to change that, but had no idea how. And this is how in 2020, we started working on humanoid, which I will tell you about later, I suppose.
00:04:16.450 - 00:04:17.326, Speaker A: Right, got it.
00:04:17.348 - 00:04:26.930, Speaker B: So it's not just about crypto only, it's more about a convergence. And it was these insights that led to human node. So, I mean, what got you pulling the thread of human node specifically?
00:04:29.190 - 00:05:23.780, Speaker D: Well, I'm one of the co founders, right? So it was looking through different sciences to solve the question how we can create a system where one person cannot launch more than one node to finally bring proper distribution to the most important thing, to the crypt infrastructure and the servers it runs on. And we've been following biometrics for a while, and there were so many achievements in that field in terms of increase of accuracy, in terms of finding out if there is a real human in front of the camera, as well as a lot of research and privacy of biometrics, which is crucial for the crypto. When we understood that it is finally there and it's getting better each year with a great pace, we kind of started to think about the architecture of how we can create network like that.
00:05:26.710 - 00:05:27.266, Speaker A: Got it.
00:05:27.288 - 00:05:37.126, Speaker B: Okay, so it sounds like sort of solving the not one human, one vote question, but one human, one node. I'm just piecing it together from the Dave human node here.
00:05:37.308 - 00:06:06.594, Speaker D: Well, it also applies to the one human, one vote. Right. But in our heads, if the crypto infrastructure is not decentralized itself. Right. All the one person, one vote system. We build on a capitalistic system, which is not decentralized, what's the reason for it? I think we should care about each of the layers, including the most basic one. So it goes two ways.
00:06:06.594 - 00:06:48.110, Speaker D: We're talking about private biometric solutions here, where we can verify that the person is unique and real with pretty high accuracy. But at the same time, it works both for the infrastructure, so we can check it before granting access to launch a node to the person. That's what we focused on. But as we were building this, one of the first private biometric solutions in the whole biometric industry, not talking about crypto particularly, we understood that it can be applied to so many projects that's needed right now to fight Sibil in order to save their economies.
00:06:50.210 - 00:06:50.910, Speaker A: Got it.
00:06:50.980 - 00:07:02.100, Speaker B: So how does the mechanism work? I'm kind of poking through your deck right now, and it talks about a uniqueness check and aliveness check. I'm curious how the mechanism works.
00:07:03.030 - 00:07:42.640, Speaker D: Yeah. These are the two major things that biometrics are based on. So, first thing is matching one person, like comparing it to all the other people to see if he's unique. This is a neural network, basically, that checks if you are same or not. And this is a probabilistic neural network. But as you can see, the accuracy has gone pretty high. So a chance that another person would enter, for example, your account is 125,000,000 this year.
00:07:42.640 - 00:08:34.766, Speaker D: So last year, it was just one in 10 million. And soon, it will get to 7 billion, where we can be pretty sure that we can check that this is you. And the other part, which actually why we didn't do that in 2017, because it was not there at all, is called in biometrics, liveness checks. It checks whether there is a real human being. Through many computer vision models, like in front of the camera, we're talking about facial recognition only because it's the most accurate for now. And, well, it uses 50 different modules to see how the light bends on your face, to see the small movements of your face. And it captures this liveness data during the session.
00:08:34.766 - 00:09:10.890, Speaker D: And it actually protects us from spoofing an identity that doesn't exist. So we call it artifacts in biometrics. This can be a face mask. That's how we usually try different biometric providers. This can be a walks doll. This can be a hacker trying to bypass the video feed and inject a deep fake, for example. So this is also something that we can check during the five to ten second process of taking your biometrics.
00:09:10.890 - 00:09:30.930, Speaker D: So these are the two things that all major biometric companies are doing. And the thing that they didn't care a lot before recently is privacy. And this is completely another task to complete in order to achieve private biometric solutions for sibo resistance.
00:09:31.830 - 00:09:32.482, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:32.616 - 00:09:52.570, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Do you worry at all about the, sort of, like, dystopian problems with biometrics if they're not sort of like, the data is managed in a private way? You have biometric stuff that's kind of immutable, attached to you. And I know that there's a lot of privacy concerns around biometrics. How do you think about privacy?
00:09:53.470 - 00:10:51.370, Speaker D: Well, actually, our developers think that this is a battle we already lost, but we still have to fight for it, because right now, there is no privacy in biometrics whatsoever. Companies don't care about it. Even large banks don't care about it. This is something we fight for. This is something that we have already implemented in the first version, where we base it on hardware like trusting decision environments. Right. But in the second version, what we want to do is completely open source biometric neural networks, which do both liveness and uniqueness checks, and they are processed by the nodes who have no idea what's inside, because every layer of the neural network is encrypted.
00:10:51.370 - 00:11:38.060, Speaker D: Well, this is something what we need to do to protect us from this dystopian future you're talking about. Some of the dystopian events are, of course, the control of your biometrics by governments or corporations. But if we go further and think about the general AI problem, right, basically, if we don't have that control of the infrastructure by people, that means that, well, if we still have capital based control, he can buy it out and control all the ledgers we have. And if he has our biometric data, if it's not encrypted, he can again use our biometric data to get control.
00:11:38.990 - 00:11:39.658, Speaker A: I see.
00:11:39.744 - 00:11:47.760, Speaker D: Okay. Both blockchains and biometrics can lead to dystopia or for the future we strive for.
00:11:49.570 - 00:11:51.102, Speaker A: Got it. Okay, cool.
00:11:51.156 - 00:12:05.940, Speaker B: So it sounds like you're working on it, but you're at kind of like a disadvantage because there's other projects working in the space that aren't spending a lot of time on privacy. So it sounds like it's sort of something that you're managing, at least trying to.
00:12:06.250 - 00:12:08.358, Speaker D: Yeah, at least a year ahead.
00:12:08.524 - 00:12:11.414, Speaker B: How many people are using human node right now?
00:12:11.612 - 00:13:22.234, Speaker D: So our testnets were running for ten months now. We had more than ten k people participating as human nodes, participating in consensus validating transactions. And we also made them scan their faces regularly, every three days, actually on the first testnet in order to make sure that these people are still there to fight the problems of dead people running notes and receiving fees when they don't need it anymore, or to fight the problems of indian farmers who just, we call it. So because we had an inquiry like that a year ago, the person wanted just go to many, many farmers out there and make them human nodes. So over ten k people ran nodes. Right now we have proper consensus with finalization, with 800 people running it for now. The interesting part was that we really cared about privacy, but it wasn't there ten months ago and we explicitly told everybody, well, we have no privacy and you will have no incentive.
00:13:22.234 - 00:13:42.706, Speaker D: So you're doing it completely because of the idea and people still went for it. Most of them don't really care about privacy. Only anonymous developers and privacy geeks who really read the cryptography papers every week, I think really care about it. The majority of does not.
00:13:42.888 - 00:14:11.340, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like one of those things where you're going through one of these use cases. Maybe you just want to get a reward for putting in your biometric data and you're not thinking about the second order effects of what if my biometric data is out there? And especially we're very privileged to not be living paycheck to paycheck working in this space. But I think that there might be people out there who are just trying to survive week over week. It's like a second order effect. That's how I think about it. I'm curious if you think about it differently though.
00:14:11.970 - 00:15:05.870, Speaker D: Well, I don't have problems to paychecks really, but I also don't care about my privacy a lot. Sometimes if the biometric protocol is really bad, right, and you take the data from it, then you bring it to another really bad biometric protocol. Well, it actually can be used by just using your photo. But if you're talking about a good biometric protocol, well, liveness and your unique traits, they go together only. So if you take my unique traits, if you even make a mask out of my face, but I won't be there as a human, you won't be able to enter the account. It's all about education of people on how biometrics work, especially because they all work differently.
00:15:06.530 - 00:15:07.840, Speaker A: Right. Okay.
00:15:10.290 - 00:15:12.510, Speaker B: So what's next for you all? What's on the roadmap?
00:15:13.090 - 00:16:07.726, Speaker D: On the roadmap is actually the main net launch pretty soon, in September, October, because we've been testing that lot and we finally think already launched the first network. Without proof of stake, proof of work, anybody can join and participate. The thing is that, of course, there are scalability issues. As for any project out there in the crypto market, and if there will be too many people that want to go and join the network, they will have to go through other different actions to get there. So it's not only about biometric checks in current blockchains. It's all about capital, right? It's all capital incentive. It's capital you have to bring to participate.
00:16:07.726 - 00:16:33.450, Speaker D: We're taking other forms of capital, not financial capital, for people to take part in the network. It's not only about checking the human existence, but also are they participating in governance? Yes or no? Are they proposing ideas or executing on them? Yes or no. And by this way, you're able to stay in the validator set because it will be limited until we update the consensus.
00:16:33.950 - 00:16:35.420, Speaker A: Okay, got it.
00:16:35.870 - 00:16:47.230, Speaker B: Seems like the details are fairly ironed out at this point. Is there any alpha you can leak about the network and the main net launch at this point, or should we all wait for the main announcement?
00:16:49.410 - 00:17:13.320, Speaker D: Well, there is not the exact date. So join the network right now, try it out and see what. Is it becoming humanoid? Because otherwise it's hard to understand even from people who have been crypto industry for three years, unless they go through it themselves. And now biometrics are private. You can understand what bitcoin is unless you send the first one.
00:17:15.530 - 00:17:16.774, Speaker A: Okay, got it.
00:17:16.812 - 00:17:22.206, Speaker B: So where could you go play with it? I think the website is humanoid.
00:17:22.258 - 00:17:24.250, Speaker A: IO. Yes.
00:17:24.320 - 00:17:26.700, Speaker D: You can see the testnet there.
00:17:27.230 - 00:17:27.980, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:28.910 - 00:17:40.958, Speaker B: I wanted to say, people who are listening this on audio probably can't see it, but your brand is just really incredible. You've got these really kind of futuristic line art, and it's very beautiful, the brand that you all have put together for this.
00:17:41.124 - 00:17:41.918, Speaker A: Thanks. Yeah.
00:17:42.004 - 00:17:49.090, Speaker D: The only task we gave to our designer is do something completely different. Not like crypto, not this node.
00:17:50.230 - 00:17:52.740, Speaker A: Yeah, that's great.
00:17:53.750 - 00:18:32.110, Speaker B: So how do you sort of see civil resistance in the web three ecosystem evolving? My sort of take is that there's a bunch of different players trying a bunch of different approaches. And some are biometric, some are web of trust, some are proof of liveliness. And I'm just kind of curious to see how it all fits together when we start spinning this flywheel of more users who have one human, one vote expectations, and that drives more dapps to have one human, one vote as part of them. What is your sort of vision for human node being maximally successful or civil resistance and web three being maximally successful?
00:18:33.250 - 00:19:29.678, Speaker D: Well, of course, you shouldn't rely just on one technology. It's all about cooperating together. I actually have seen the proof. Humanity also trying the biometric checks, but they just put the simple neural network there, which could be fooled by photos. But still, we're working with projects in Ubi space as well who have web of trust model, which works pretty fine unless you can spoof a lot of identities that all trust each other. And the only way to get it really secure is the combination. Of course, I do not believe a lot into Turing tests where you have to go and do the tests that can be bought for solve them on mechanical Turk.
00:19:29.678 - 00:19:38.850, Speaker D: But the web of trust with certain thresholds combined with biometric checks is great. Tandem.
00:19:40.630 - 00:19:41.186, Speaker A: Got it.
00:19:41.208 - 00:19:57.514, Speaker B: Okay, so getting out of the mechanics of civil resistance, though, what is the utility you think this brings to everyday users in the space to have these passports out? Like, once we've solved the checks, what do people get? I mean, I guess like, Ubi is one thing that you talked about.
00:19:57.632 - 00:20:55.600, Speaker D: Yeah, Ubi is just one thing. We can solve the airdrop problem, right? Because it is Sibila is a big problem there. I mean, we already had project on using our biometric tech, creating NFT minter, so to say, which checks that NFT goes just to one person, not like ten NFPs to one person. And there are things we can do in d five when the whales come and they repol the rewards out of the reward pool so that you could limit them per person. Then we had like 20 ideas of what you can build with civil resistant tech. We think that there is no proper MMORPG still on blockchain with normal gaming economy because MMO economies are broken with rapid inflation. Right.
00:20:55.600 - 00:22:12.118, Speaker D: And the only thing you can do that is by also limiting the activity of the bots who lead to this inflation. I mean, the ideas come every week to us what else we can do with civil resistant tech. Of course, Daos is the most evident thing, and we will see a lot of dows even emerging on top of current dows because you have seen awful cases when team just says this wallet is under our control now because we have enough votes to do anything with our network. Well this at least if not changed right away. It should be indicated by real community where you have this signaling one person one vote dows which do not really execute anything but steal. The community can clearly see that the direction of the community is different from the direction of the whales or the founders. What else? With civil resistance we can actually establish the checks for proof of stake networks as well.
00:22:12.118 - 00:22:58.542, Speaker D: So in ethereum, due to the fact that there is 32 ads per node, you never know how many nodes one person keeps, right? You also have the centralization points due to those who help people with less Ethereum stake their eth through the third provider. We could tell hey people, if you want to see how really this network is decentralized and who it belongs to, please go and verify that you're a validator of these nodes and only one person stays behind it. Otherwise we will never really know the commodity coefficient of Ethereum and how many people is needed to coordinate to hold the network.
00:22:58.686 - 00:23:46.434, Speaker C: Coinshift is a leading treasury management and infrastructure platform for Daos and crypto businesses who need to manage their treasury operations.

This is why world class companies and projects have decided to deploy on immutable x like GameStop, Embersord, Planet Quest, Alluvium, TikTok, and many more behind the scenes. So start building your game on immutable x today@immutables.com.
00:24:40.156 - 00:25:04.080, Speaker B: So it seems like you're sort of pretty long on Ubi and one human one vote dows. Civil resistant airdrops would be huge. Maybe staking some of these l ones could be civil resistant. And it's sort of like that horizon of apps is what is going to be enabled if human node and other apps are successful here.
00:25:04.450 - 00:25:29.250, Speaker D: That's something right now in my mind as major problems. But there's also a lot of fun you can do, though. One of our team members came up with a wonderful game, which for some reason wasn't yet created. That is like when you enter the game, you have just one life per one person, then you die, and that's the end of the game. So there are more interesting, funny things you can do with civil resistance.
00:25:32.230 - 00:25:33.220, Speaker A: Got it.
00:25:33.670 - 00:25:44.090, Speaker B: And how do you think about, are you all going to build some of those apps at human node, or you just want to expose an API, the civil resistance layer, and enable other developers to do that?
00:25:44.240 - 00:26:06.320, Speaker D: Well, of course, that's what we already did in the demo mode because we're not on the main net yet. But there are like five good projects that have already built in us on the hackathon. Of course. Yeah, we're providing them with the, so to say, API, more like biometric service.
00:26:07.190 - 00:26:07.794, Speaker A: Got it.
00:26:07.832 - 00:26:19.080, Speaker B: Okay, cool, man. You should talk to the people at Gitcoin Dao. They just launched a proof of personhood passport called Gitcoin Passport. And that'd be an interesting integration for Dao to consider.
00:26:19.850 - 00:26:38.602, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. May I ask you a question regarding this? So this is what and my friends, analysts from Republic, were really interested in. In Gitcoin passport, you have, for example, eight options of proving you're a real person, right?
00:26:38.656 - 00:26:39.260, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:41.330 - 00:26:55.870, Speaker D: Well, is there at least one which you have to go through 100% or not? Because, for example, if there are eight options, I could have eight identities.
00:26:57.970 - 00:26:58.382, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:58.436 - 00:27:39.566, Speaker B: So I think that bitcoin Dow is still working through a lot of how this is going to work. And I should say I think I'm known as the founder of Gitcoin, but I've actually just affiliated from leadership in the DAO. So I'm not speaking on behalf of the DAO when I answer here. Yeah, well, working on it. But yeah, basically part of the idea I think is on Gitcoin Dow, there's a trust bonus which basically every Gitcoin grants contribution will be metered up or metered down by. How about civil resistant? You are. And then there's also a fraud defense team that is doing data analysis and looking for the civil attackers and trying to find them.
00:27:39.566 - 00:28:31.070, Speaker B: But I think that the final destination of where this is going might be around something like a cost of forgery for an identity or a personhood score. And basically the idea is that you've got eight stamps in your passport and maybe each individually stamp is worth ten cents, one dollars, ten dollars, one hundred dollars. So if you do all of them, then you have $111.10 worth of civil resistance and that would enable you to get that much amount of matching. And so if you're that one person and you have eight different identities with eight different stamps, then you would have an identity with ten cents, one dollars, ten dollars, one hundred dollars worth of matching. And so choose which way, how you want your identity to compound. So it's early days, but I think that's how they're thinking about doing it.
00:28:31.070 - 00:28:37.220, Speaker B: And if you have any feedback, there's Gitcoin Dow. People who listen to this podcast, I'm sure who may have comments on that.
00:28:37.830 - 00:29:20.734, Speaker D: The feedback is that if there is a person who came, he registered like he got three points out of ten, right? But he was a scammer indeed. And he just took the money he never delivered. For some reason. It happened. Of course there are some protection things that you put in place, but still, how can you ban this person from creating another account going through the verifications of other civil resistant providers? There is no way. This is why asking this question, because if you want to really ban a person, there should be one at least method which should be used 100% by every grantee. So this is the only thing I wanted to say here.
00:29:20.932 - 00:30:20.850, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that is interesting feedback and maybe we can pass that along to the people at getcoined out who are working on this. I do think that whether there's and gates or, or gates on each of those individual stamps is something that's subject to intense, vigorous debate. But then there's a question of who even makes the legitimate decision of how these stamps compound with each other. And then you get into kind of like some governance questions there, but also acknowledging that anytime you have an economic system that has any value in it, that there's going to be people who attack it. And so looking away from trying to create the perfect system to creating this red team, blue team type exercise in which the attackers attack the system, the blue team studies the data, goes back to governance, makes changes to it, and then the system evolves like every epoch is kind of, I think how getcoin Dao is thinking about it, but maybe there's a more solid way to solve it in one fell swoop with biometrics.
00:30:21.670 - 00:30:22.626, Speaker A: Any comments on that?
00:30:22.648 - 00:30:33.830, Speaker B: I feel like we've flipped the switch and now you're interviewing me, which is not what I intended, but the TikTok between Gitcoin and human node might be sort of interesting for people since they're both working on civil resistance.
00:30:34.250 - 00:30:44.186, Speaker D: Well, I really don't have a clear answer to this, but I think I would just go to Gitcoin Dow and talk on the forum, sort it out.
00:30:44.208 - 00:30:58.480, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. That's how Gitcoin Dow does its governance. Any sort of preview on how human node is going to do its governance? I mean, obviously there'll be civil resistance sort of baked into it, but how is that going to work?
00:30:59.090 - 00:32:13.798, Speaker D: Well, we wanted to make the network democratic, right? So that one person has one vote, but at the same time there are certain limitations. I mean, let's start with the fact that many people can launch nodes, but not all of them will vote. This leads to the fact that you can get enough votes on proposals, the proposal gets stuck and your system is ineffective. That's why we decided that those who do not actively vote, and the threshold is 22% of all the proposals, they are out of the quorum. To always have the quorum out of at least active voters. Those who are not active can just delegate and the quorum will be reached better then. The next point is that imagine tomorrow there will be like one small village anywhere in the world will coordinate, put another 5000 nodes on the network and it gets all the power now, right? So this way it could do anything to the network and we should protect from this thing as well.
00:32:13.798 - 00:34:01.500, Speaker D: So what we did is that still everybody has one vote, but not everybody can propose on the things that can damage the network, on the things that are crucial to the network. If you just entered the validator set, you can propose only on some minor things which are really crucial for community at the same time, product marketing, I don't know, partnerships, whatever. But if you want to put proposals on, on chain voting for, for example, changing the structure of the Dow, changing the fee structure, or changing the blockchain tech itself, consensus, for example, you have to have a certain tier of governance, which we base on two things, proof of time, running the node and participating in the voting, and proof of devotion, which is just an on chain check, whether you proposed something and it got accepted, or whether you executed something as a developer of another person proposal. And by that you earn yourself a certain tier throughout time. So, for example, well, we keep the network more or less autocratic during the first tier because otherwise it can all go wrong and the network will halt and die. We don't want to do that. But in the four years time, many people will have the same rights as the founders and they will be able to propose the things on changing the tech, changing the dow itself and the economic system.
00:34:02.430 - 00:34:06.906, Speaker A: Okay, got it. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
00:34:06.928 - 00:34:10.090, Speaker B: I was just going to say it sounds like progressive decentralization.
00:34:11.390 - 00:34:22.160, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. It usually takes four years to build a republic, but you have to have autocracy in the beginning to bootstrap it.
00:34:23.330 - 00:34:24.080, Speaker A: Cool.
00:34:24.850 - 00:34:29.620, Speaker B: That's all the questions I had for you. I'm curious if there's anything that I didn't ask that you want to say.
00:34:31.030 - 00:35:39.080, Speaker D: Well, actually, as with other people on the podcast, I thought we'd be talking more about the world as this, how we can change it and what want to change in crypto, because apparently it went wrong way, right? A little bit apart from few projects that often are underfunded, that's what, of course, Gitcoin wants to solve. But I wanted to command of where the industry went wrong. So first it was all right. Even when we came up with and started proof of stake network, it still seemed all right. But when we had this defi tokens, reward on reward on reward coming out, I think that people are thinking too much about the positive loops. But the positive loops in their systems, like you do this, you get more, then you get more from the other source. And the positive loops work great.
00:35:39.080 - 00:36:34.070, Speaker D: If it goes up right, if everything is going well, it is getting better and better accelerates. But as in our, today's like boom and bust credit cycles, right? In traditional economy, when things go down, the positive loop makes things go down really far. And I think that I had that idea in my mind that we should do it in completely opposite way. We shouldn't create positive loops, but negative loops, to have stable growth and sustainable growth without much of ups and downs for the network to grow at the pace of its productivity growth, not the pace of its hype growth.
00:36:35.530 - 00:36:43.086, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah, I, I don't know how to.
00:36:43.108 - 00:36:45.440, Speaker B: Engineer that, but it's quite an interesting idea.
00:36:45.970 - 00:37:11.910, Speaker D: Yeah, sorry, I'm an economist. Yeah. I mean, this is something you can get from the complex system modeling as an engineer. Right. And actually test out those systems. We actually think that eventually, if we will be wise humanity. Well, this is what we should think on a macro scale of our economies, of national economies.
00:37:11.910 - 00:37:37.920, Speaker D: You see, we should make the cycles smaller, not bigger. Otherwise you went up a lot, then you wasted a lot of money that you created on the stuff that you don't need, and then you go down a lot. And you also had a lot of environmental impact while going through that.
00:37:39.730 - 00:37:50.322, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that there's a lot of criticisms of web three. I feel like it's evolving in a bunch of different directions at once. And you can program your values into your money.
00:37:50.376 - 00:37:50.642, Speaker D: Right.
00:37:50.696 - 00:38:38.690, Speaker B: And there's a whole spectrum of human values and they're going to evolve in multiple different directions. But what I think is neat is that someone like you can take the value system that you have and bootstrap an economy based off of that, and there's kind of a merit based approach of what's the GDP of the human node economy, and there's an evolutionary sort of fitness game between it and someone else. So I'm not saying that I don't want to brush aside your criticisms. I think they're valid, but that's kind of like my macro view on the space is that everyone's sort of experimenting and hopefully the ecosystem selects for the right winners. But I'm actually not very optimistic on that. You see the growth of stuff like terra Luna and meanwhile there's public goods that can't get funded. It makes you a little bit less optimistic about the market selection mechanism.
00:38:39.670 - 00:39:13.066, Speaker D: Yeah, but if we keep developing and with this more stable systems, eventually in five years time we could match those who are growing on hype, like mushrooms. We just have to survive and keep building, I think, without getting a lot of hype for no reason. Because eventually those things that starting slow are those who survive, right?
00:39:13.248 - 00:39:44.710, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think that slow and steady wins the race is the children's tale of the tortoise and the hare. But one of the things that I sort of saw with these giant Ponzi things like Tara is that they collapse sort of on their own. And then the ones that are left standing are the ones that were sort of slowly and steady. You know, there's everywhere in between those two things. So maybe it's not even going faster than them. It's just waiting for them to implode because their growth was cancerous and unsustainable.
00:39:45.530 - 00:39:56.038, Speaker D: I just hope that after all these lessons, we won't do the same things again and kind of research negative loops instead of positive loops.
00:39:56.214 - 00:39:57.110, Speaker A: Yeah, totally.
00:39:57.190 - 00:40:36.230, Speaker B: What's that whole saying? Once bitten, twice shy? So at least within human memory of what's recently happened, then at least hopefully people will not make the same mistakes. But I find the idea of the fourth turning quite compelling. Basically the idea that there's only three living generations in my family, my kids, myself and my parents. And so you have a fourth turning every fourth generation of human memory of people forget history. And so maybe it's going to differ as people have shorter attention spans with the Internet and everything like that. But that's kind of how I think about that evolution.
00:40:37.050 - 00:40:52.700, Speaker D: Yeah. Unfortunately, I think it will be even less soon. And the only thing we can change it with is education. This is the main thing that we have in our world. This is the root thing that can change how we live.
00:40:54.370 - 00:41:18.550, Speaker B: Yeah, it's quite interesting to see the evolution, and I'm really interested to see human node evolve and can't wait to see how it turns out in the end. So we'll be looking forward to the main net launch. Let me know if you want an intro to the people at Getcoin Dow to do an integration from the Dow side of things, I guess. Is there anything else to say? Any sort of parting thoughts?
00:41:21.050 - 00:41:47.818, Speaker D: Well, not really. I said everything. But I just wanted to share with you that pretty interesting thing we came up with. So humanode is looking for its future, like, long ahead. We're also fans of neurotechology. Just for a final note and for people to have something to say to their friends. As you have heard, Neuralink is testing its technology mostly on pigs.
00:41:47.818 - 00:42:11.800, Speaker D: So one day we think we will have the biometric authorization and biometric signatures right from our brain and from the brain computer interfaces. So we actually one day want to launch the testnet on proof of pigs, not proof of humans, to test out the blockchain running on.
00:42:12.970 - 00:42:16.600, Speaker B: There's probably a lot of memes in there. Sorry, go ahead.
00:42:16.970 - 00:42:23.180, Speaker D: Just one day want to test out blockchain running on brain computer interfaces because we think that's where we're going.
00:42:23.790 - 00:42:40.910, Speaker B: Yeah, that's really crazy. I studied HTI, which for the uninitiated, stands for human computer interaction, in college, and there's some really wild stuff that you can do there. But as soon as you said proof of Fig, my mind was just filled with one pig, one vote memes.
00:42:42.770 - 00:42:48.740, Speaker D: Well, I think they won't vote, but we at least can get some universal, basic income for them.
00:42:49.110 - 00:42:49.810, Speaker A: Okay.
00:42:49.960 - 00:42:51.810, Speaker B: Universal, basic truffles.
00:42:52.310 - 00:42:52.914, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:42:52.952 - 00:43:10.570, Speaker B: This is probably a good place to wrap the episode because we're descending into delirium, but it was so great to have you on the pod, man. I'm just really passionate about civil resistance, and I know you are, too. And I think it's going to create a more democratic web three. So thank you for your work in the space and looking forward to seeing how it grows.
00:43:11.310 - 00:43:14.460, Speaker D: Thank you for it, Kevin. We'll make it together.
00:43:15.470 - 00:43:22.000, Speaker B: Okay, so last question. Where can people find you online? Humannode IO. Is there anything else?
00:43:22.530 - 00:43:28.990, Speaker D: Humanode IO. And then you go to social channels, Twitter, discord. Discord is very active.
00:43:30.130 - 00:43:30.974, Speaker A: Got it. Okay.
00:43:31.012 - 00:43:35.200, Speaker B: And so just human node on Twitter, is that.
00:43:35.650 - 00:43:37.774, Speaker D: Sure? Sure it is.
00:43:37.972 - 00:43:41.470, Speaker B: Cool. All right, well, thanks so much, Victor. See you on the ethernet.
