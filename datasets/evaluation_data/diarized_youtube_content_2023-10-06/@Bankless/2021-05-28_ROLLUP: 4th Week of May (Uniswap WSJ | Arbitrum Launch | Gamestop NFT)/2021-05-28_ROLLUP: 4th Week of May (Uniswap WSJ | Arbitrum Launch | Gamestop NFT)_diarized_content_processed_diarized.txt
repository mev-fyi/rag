00:00:08.170 - 00:00:11.230, Speaker A: Happy Friday morning, bankless nation. David, what time is it?
00:00:11.300 - 00:00:28.600, Speaker B: It is Friday morning weekly roll up time, where we take a whole entire week in the crypto cycle and put it right into your brain as fast and densely as possible, which is an ambitious endeavor in this industry. Yet we try to do it every single week and we have fun doing it left and right.
00:00:29.050 - 00:00:40.994, Speaker A: Markets releases, news takes. We end with what we're excited about. No, we don't. We end with the meme of the week, of course, every single week. So stay tuned for that. Wow. A lot going on in the bankless nation.
00:00:40.994 - 00:00:48.458, Speaker A: As always, a lot going in crypto. This is the last week of May. We are excited to get you downloaded. David, you ready to get started?
00:00:48.544 - 00:00:49.494, Speaker B: Let's do it. Ryan.
00:00:49.622 - 00:01:04.590, Speaker A: All right, man. We got to start with the market. The markets have been crazy these days, David. Absolutely insane. Crazy. Last week, around this time ish, did it feel like a bear market? To some people, it felt like a bear market. Suddenly.
00:01:04.590 - 00:01:05.970, Speaker A: Are we out of the bear market?
00:01:06.040 - 00:01:07.314, Speaker B: People got spooked last week.
00:01:07.352 - 00:01:22.806, Speaker A: People got real spooked, like on Twitter last weekend, David. A lot of anger, I would say, even about this market. Like the sudden drop. Anyway, we'll get into that. Let's start with bitcoin. What happened?
00:01:22.908 - 00:01:53.710, Speaker B: Yeah. From the start of this week, at its lowest low, bitcoin touched right below $32,500 and is currently trading just above $40,000. People seem to be kind of comfy with bitcoin being at $40,000. People, I think, are sighing a breath of relief. But when bitcoin got below $33,000, people were freaking out. And there's a bunch of news to go along with this, which we will be getting into. But people are starting to get bullish.
00:01:53.710 - 00:02:13.222, Speaker B: Let's not say too bullish, but people are starting to, I think, believe that, oh, yeah, this bull market is not over. This is not the start of a bear market. And so there we are, bitcoin trading right above $40,000. If it can hold the $40,000 level, I think that's going to instill a lot of confidence in the people that got spooked last week.
00:02:13.356 - 00:02:21.898, Speaker A: And yet some people are still saying this is a dead cat bounce. Of course, we don't know for sure until the market plays out. But tell us what's going on in ether price.
00:02:21.984 - 00:03:05.446, Speaker B: Yeah, ether got fucking wrecked. Coming down from $4,300 at the top all the way down to one $733, which is a big drop off the top over the eleven days between $4,300 and the bottom at 1733, now trading at $2,810. So a huge rebound over $1,000 off of the bottom. Just the fact that ether is moving in $1,000 increments is absolutely insane. And I would say an ether has a bigger bounce off the bottom than bitcoin did. We'll get into looking at the ratio in a second. But the bounce off the bottom was definitely in ether's favor, which is pretty interesting.
00:03:05.628 - 00:03:17.578, Speaker A: I got to say. On Sunday, people were freaking out, David, at these prices, like ether, price went 66%, was 66% off all time highs. Bitcoin was over 50%. Something like this.
00:03:17.664 - 00:03:24.970, Speaker B: It's one of the biggest drops in crypto history. If you think that this is normal, this is not normal. This is a huge drop.
00:03:25.130 - 00:04:00.280, Speaker A: It is a huge drop, but also not unprecedented, at least on ether side. And again, last week, we talked about 2017, right? So this drop from 420 all the way to, like, the 130s or so, again, this kind of feels like that. And it's even fitting the rhythm of that, where there was a strong recovery, not back all the way to all time highs, but a fairly quick recovery from those 130s lows. Of course, some people are still thinking this is like dead cat bounce and we're going to go lower still. That might play out. That might be the case. What's your take?
00:04:03.070 - 00:04:27.294, Speaker B: It would be just what would seem to be a really premature end to this bull market. But again, the listener is listening to two critics would call, I don't trade perma bold critics. We're always bullish, but to some degree, there's always so many fundamentals. Right? And this is going to be a theme for the rest of this market section. But there's still so much energy left in this reallocation towards crypto assets.
00:04:27.422 - 00:05:15.794, Speaker A: This is why some people were angry about this move on Twitter, because on Sunday, I said something to the effect of, like, some of you seem to feel entitled to crypto gains every week of the year. That's not how this works. And I wasn't trying, David, to downplay anyone's stress or suffering with a 66% loss and drop. That is a big deal. Right. But the reality is also, David, we just moved to prices of 45 days earlier, right? So if you bought more than 45 days ago, you were doing okay. And if you want to take the ten x gains, you have to be comfortable with days or weeks where you're getting these kinds of dips, 66% dips or more.
00:05:15.794 - 00:05:38.440, Speaker A: It just goes with the territory. So at some level, if you're a unicycler, this is your first bull market. You're not used to these things, but also get used to them, right? Like the market doesn't owe us anything. We're all along for the ride. This is what volatility looks like. This is what you signed up for when you bought even good blue chip crypto assets like bitcoin and ether. This is what happens.
00:05:39.210 - 00:06:03.182, Speaker B: It's a commitment to, this is world changing technology. It will absolutely change every single paradigm that we know and love. And that's why we're all super bullish on it. That's why there's 1000 x over the next x number of years and you're getting 60% drops every now and then. You don't get 1000 x upsides without huge massive pull downs. You just got to take it. You just got to take it.
00:06:03.236 - 00:06:18.694, Speaker A: Also, David, we're going to have a bear market someday too, and I want these folks to be ready for that. Right? We're just not going to go on a straight march to a million dollar bitcoin. And there's going to be some bumps in the road as well. Anyway, people have to get used to this.
00:06:18.732 - 00:06:50.080, Speaker B: But let's talk about this, David, before we move on. Ether went from $730 at the end of January almost straight up to $4,000 at the end of May. And so I think people got really spoiled behind number go up. It's like, oh, yeah. It literally was up into the right with very minimal dips and everyone's like, oh, making money left and right. And then all of a sudden we dumped 60%. If you are making money left and right for months and months and months dips coming, it doesn't work like that.
00:06:50.080 - 00:06:52.798, Speaker B: You're going to get punched in the face.
00:06:52.964 - 00:07:04.674, Speaker A: Yeah, just being real. Of course. And you got to be in this game for the long term, for the long run. That's what we're about. That's what the bankless journey is all about. So anyway, guys, I know it's painful. We'll get through it.
00:07:04.674 - 00:07:11.842, Speaker A: Just zoom out, expand your time horizon. And don't panic. Sell. Don't give into those immediate reactions.
00:07:11.906 - 00:07:13.606, Speaker B: No euphoria without pain.
00:07:13.708 - 00:07:18.550, Speaker A: All right, David, let's go to the ETH bitcoin ratio. This is doing some stuff. What's it doing?
00:07:18.620 - 00:08:08.914, Speaker B: Definitely doing some stuff, that's for sure. There was some commentary about how well the ETH BTC ratio was holding up while BTC kind of led this downtrend BTC started to dump off and trade off, sell off sooner than everything else. And ETH BTC held up, and then the rest of the market started to sell off, too. And then it went from its high of zero eight, which is really high in ETH BTC terms, all the way down to 00:57 which, in the grand scheme of things, still pretty high. It's still pretty high. But ETH BTC does sell off when the market sells off. So if bitcoin sneezes, ether is sick in bed, I would say overall, though, it didn't really nuke as we have seen it before, and it recovered pretty strongly.
00:08:08.914 - 00:08:22.998, Speaker B: And so we hit the high earlier while we were super bullish, while everyone was talking about the flipping, and flipping was in, it was at 0.8. Now we're at 0.7. So I would say really strong recovery by the ETH BTC ratio still feels.
00:08:23.014 - 00:08:29.326, Speaker A: Like bull market stuff. I don't know. You never know. Could be a dead cat, but still feels like bull market stuff.
00:08:29.428 - 00:08:33.698, Speaker B: Lots of people saying dead cats, but between you and me, Ryan, it's just you.
00:08:33.864 - 00:08:57.058, Speaker A: Yeah. Is it really? I'm the only guy. All right, Ryan Watkins. ETH volumes have been exploding recently and surpassed bitcoin volumes. This might be some of the reason for that healthy eth to bitcoin ratio here. So this is actually spot volumes on centralized exchanges. And bitcoin has always led from a volume perspective.
00:08:57.058 - 00:09:05.658, Speaker A: Now ETh is taking the lead. That's something new we haven't seen in the past. I'm not sure if we've ever seen this, David. What does that tell us?
00:09:05.744 - 00:09:48.822, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a big narrative shift for bitcoin, right? Because bitcoin talks about itself as one of the world's most liquid assets, right? You can make large bitcoin buys and sells from anywhere in the world at anywhere in the time. And one of the reasons why that's true is because the bitcoin volume is insane. It's always been the largest in crypto. Ether has been taking the lead since, I would say, the last two weeks, I think is where I'm looking at on this chart, where ether has had surpassed bitcoin in trading volumes. That doesn't necessarily mean that ether is more liquid, but it definitely, over the long term, if trading volumes are higher, then overall liquidity follows that. And so this is what it takes to become a money is significant liquidity globally. And that's what we're seeing out of ether in the last two weeks.
00:09:48.956 - 00:10:06.958, Speaker A: It's also interesting, maybe starting to position ether as a reserve currency for crypto, which bitcoin has still been king of. You could argue that Eth was the reserve asset of DeFi, but bitcoin has still led all of crypto. Maybe that's changing as well. Yeah, you have to wonder about how this shakes out into the future.
00:10:07.044 - 00:10:15.730, Speaker B: And this is what the flipping looks like, by the way. The flipping is one big flipping, which is represented by like a thousand little flippinings, and this is one of them.
00:10:15.880 - 00:10:32.646, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed. That's an important one. Okay, let's talk about DFI for a minute. So the first is total locked value down and then up as the market went down and then back up. We are sitting at 65 billion total value locked in DFI protocols at this moment. What does this mean?
00:10:32.748 - 00:10:38.630, Speaker B: I mean, it basically looks like the ether price chart, which makes sense because everything is super correlated right now.
00:10:38.780 - 00:10:46.460, Speaker A: More eth just keeps going down, though, in DFI. I wonder if that's going to be a long term trend that plays out here.
00:10:48.910 - 00:10:52.406, Speaker B: Only in the short term. Yeah, we'll see how that short term noise.
00:10:52.598 - 00:11:04.106, Speaker A: Okay, defi tokens, we measure that by the DPi, which is many of the top, most blue chip DFI tokens out there. How's that held up? I'm going to scroll to the weekly.
00:11:04.138 - 00:11:46.734, Speaker B: Here, except for that one brief moment in time Sunday night, where DFI tokens got cut by 60%. They rebounded pretty well, and they were doing pretty well, kind of resisting the bitcoin sell off pretty well, and the ether sell off. And then the market just took everything for a ride Friday through Sunday, but rebounded down up to $420. Relatively, again, still relatively flat over. Let's see the one month period. I would say down a little bit. How about the three month period, Ryan? Yeah, flat over three months in the grand scheme of things, but coming off of what was a pretty strong high at just like above $600.
00:11:46.932 - 00:11:59.106, Speaker A: Yeah, year to date, we're still definitely up 421. Year to date, that's up almost like three or four x, so not doing too bad on the year. What about the DPI to ETH ratio? That's important.
00:11:59.208 - 00:12:23.114, Speaker B: God, here we are. And I haven't actually seen this chart since the last time we talked about it, but I called the bottom at ETH DPi at zero point 13, and it's barely holding on. It barely held on, but the bottom is still in on ETH DPi. And so I almost didn't call it. I almost became wrong. But so far, there's still some more.
00:12:23.152 - 00:12:47.970, Speaker A: Weeks left in the year, David? Yeah, I wonder what happens if we enter sort of another defi summer type period, but we certainly haven't yet. ETH has been performing very well. Defi tokens have yet to follow. We'll see what happens in the future. All right, let's jump to Raul. Paul, this is a really interesting take. You lead with this take, David, and I'll throw some comments in.
00:12:48.040 - 00:13:06.130, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we should put the frame of mind of 2008 into the listener as we read this thread. So 2008 was cascading liquidations that set off the global financial system to the point of just like we need the world's largest institutions to take action or else the world is going to explode.
00:13:06.210 - 00:13:07.442, Speaker A: That was what bail out the Bankers.
00:13:07.506 - 00:13:24.014, Speaker B: Bail out the bankers, print money. Like, fix it, fix it, fix it. Things are broken, things are dried up. So let's use that for context. Granted, DFI is not the world's largest industry or economy, so this is a microcosm. But let's use that as a frame of mind. Here's what Raul says.
00:13:24.014 - 00:13:46.062, Speaker B: Something to get your head around. Headline. A major asset class crashed 42% in 14 days, wiping out a trillion dollars in value in an orgy of liquidations of people up to 100 x leverage with very low regulation. Many tokens fell up to 70%, including unregulated lending and borrowing businesses. Beneath the headline, crypto.
00:13:46.206 - 00:13:58.118, Speaker A: That headline, by the way, is what people freak out about. Right? Mainstream media, I saw it was like, how can institutions buy such a volatile asset? This is not ready for mainstream. All of these headlines came out right.
00:13:58.204 - 00:14:07.494, Speaker B: Beneath the headlines, though. So this is what Ralph says. Here's the real through line that you should pay attention to. Crypto had a major, major VAR. Do you know what that is? Ryan?
00:14:07.542 - 00:14:09.658, Speaker A: Variant VAR. Variance, I guess.
00:14:09.744 - 00:14:15.006, Speaker B: Volatility, something. I don't know. And nothing happened. It had a shock test and nothing happened.
00:14:15.108 - 00:14:15.482, Speaker A: Leverage.
00:14:15.546 - 00:14:31.710, Speaker B: Liquidations was offset by over collateralization. Over collateralization is fundamentally safe. No one was left holding the baby. No firm went under. The Fed didn't need to step in. Defi didn't break and carried on near normal. The markets cleared.
00:14:31.710 - 00:14:44.054, Speaker B: The markets worked. DFI apps worked. Nothing broke. That is absolutely fantastic. And nothing broke. And it dropped 60% in eleven days. In 2008, it didn't drop 60%.
00:14:44.054 - 00:14:56.038, Speaker B: It dropped like 40% over like two weeks or something. I don't know, my memories, I was like a kid during that. But the point is, it took a harder punch and it came out swing.
00:14:56.214 - 00:15:22.514, Speaker A: It did. I think people overestimate the risk of Defi sometimes. Not that there isn't smart contract risk and rug pull risk and theft risk, but all of this lending, at least right now, none of it is credit based. All of it's over collateralized. So that is a very open, honest market. You can see all of the activity on chain as it happens. So, yeah, I mean, good for Defi, good for crypto, for sustaining some of this.
00:15:22.514 - 00:15:39.078, Speaker A: It shows that it is possible to do so in an open, unregulated market. Maybe this is what open markets really look like. If the fed and regulators peeled off the veneer and stopped moving all of the dials around, maybe that's what we're seeing here.
00:15:39.164 - 00:16:04.270, Speaker B: And he continues saying there was no daisy change of collateral losses. Stablecoins remained stable. A few centralized exchanges went down for an hour or two. No exchange, big losses occurred. No protocol failed. Mainly no protocols went down overall. Just like people get spooked by this 60%, and a lot of people just aren't ready to see the value of their investments drop by 60%, and that's their thing.
00:16:04.270 - 00:16:15.380, Speaker B: But things worked, right? And so to some degree, there is less risk in things that can take a 60% drop and rebound without completely dying. That's not something we've seen in the world before.
00:16:15.850 - 00:16:32.438, Speaker A: Good acid test. Here's another take on this. On DFI, decentralized exchanges had an absolutely incredible set of days. This is actually from May 20. So it was before the Sunday, the big sell off. But look at these volumes. Decentralized exchanges, David.
00:16:32.438 - 00:16:49.646, Speaker A: I mean, they held up, they supported the trading that needed to occur for this volatility and they crushed it. In terms of volumes like super impressive. Over 10 billion in decentralized exchange volume on May 20. I bet there was even more on May 23.
00:16:49.748 - 00:17:04.580, Speaker B: The sushi swap plus uniswap dominance is absolutely insane. And just the amount of straight up pink on this graph, and for the listeners, pink means uniswap is really, really strong. I wonder how much extra volume came into DeFi because all these centralized exchanges were shut down.
00:17:05.270 - 00:17:20.762, Speaker A: Agreed. That's super interesting. Anyway, that's the story of the dip so far. I mean, we'll continue to cover it, see what happens next week. I don't know if we'll be lower or higher. No one knows this, of course, but we'll continue to keep you updated on the markets. This is an interesting take.
00:17:20.762 - 00:17:39.598, Speaker A: While we're talking about numbers, David from Amin, tornado cash, maybe you can explain what that is, but tornado cash is within ten x of flipping zcash in terms of total locked value of eth versus market cap of zcash. What does this mean to you?
00:17:39.684 - 00:17:45.822, Speaker B: Yeah, so zcash is a eth tumbler. It's an ETH mixer. And so you deposit zcash, tornado cash.
00:17:45.876 - 00:17:46.094, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:46.132 - 00:18:04.518, Speaker B: Oh, is that what I. Yeah, I meant to say tornado cash. Tornado cash is a EtH mixer. Right. And they also are working on Dai and USDC mixers, but right now just eth. And so you deposit lots of one or ten or 100 ether into tornado cash. And then you wait because you're waiting for other people to also do the same.
00:18:04.518 - 00:18:47.502, Speaker B: And when you deposit it, you get this note, right? You get a note back, which is just a cryptographic hash. And you save that on your computer, you save that not on the Ethereum blockchain, you save that in meat space, right? Then you wait for other people to come in, put their ether into the tumbler. You allow entropy to happen. So you just are patient. Then you come back with your note at a later date in time, and then that note is a right to claim an equivalent amount of what you deposited into the tumblr. And you can send that to a different address elsewhere. And so it's a privacy mechanism, right? So one of the biggest pain points about Ethereum and Defi is that if you need to pay someone or transfer money to someone, or just like if you need to do something, no privacy.
00:18:47.502 - 00:18:48.046, Speaker B: There's no privacy.
00:18:48.078 - 00:18:50.982, Speaker A: And you have that with cash. With cash money, you have privacy in the real world.
00:18:51.036 - 00:19:28.190, Speaker B: Exactly. Right. And so if I pay you for my wallet, you can go and check out my wallet and see what else I've been doing in the world of crypto, right? It's just like giving you complete inspection ability into my personal finances, and we don't like that. And so what tornado cash does is it lets you put ETh in and receive like a note. Think of literally a piece of paper, but just like in digital form, like a note. And I can pass that around, and that just passes around in meat space. But then you can come back to tornado cash and redeem that for actual ether, send it to a different wallet, and you cut off that connection back to your OG wallet.
00:19:28.190 - 00:20:21.666, Speaker B: Zcash does a similar thing, except ZCash is an l one. It's a native currency to the zcash ecosystem, and they have similar transaction capacities. But the difference is zcash is something non native to Ethereum. And so really the through line here is, is privacy an l one asset, or is privacy an application in DFI? I've always been of the opinion, and I'm pretty sure, Ryan, you agree with me that privacy is an app, not an asset. Privacy is something that you can bestow into assets, all assets, not just one specific asset. And so what Amin is saying is that tornado Cash has $200 million of ETH deposited into it, versus zcash, which has a $2 billion market cap. And so what he's saying is he's keeping an eye on the TvL of tornado cash in ether terms, versus the total market cap of zcash, which is an l one.
00:20:21.666 - 00:20:28.610, Speaker B: And this is a really good comparison. And I expect TvL and Tornado cash to pass Zcash over the long term.
00:20:28.970 - 00:21:07.282, Speaker A: Yeah. For those who weren't here in 2017, 2018, this was very much an open question. Right? There was very much the idea that if we wanted to have privacy in crypto, we would need privacy chains, essentially completely separate l ones. And so the valuations of many of these privacy chains were based on this. And this looks like Ethereum is just kind of swallowing up the privacy use case. And if there is a flipping tornado cash to Zcash, I think there's, like, some conclusive evidence that privacy is better off as an app, not as a whole separate layer. One.
00:21:07.282 - 00:21:26.390, Speaker A: Nothing against Zcash. I mean, that team is fantastic. They're doing great work putting out pioneers of research, pioneers of cryptography. But we're just putting on kind of an investor hat and sort of a thesis hat of how this space shapes up. And it looks like Ethereum is like swallowing up some of these apps. So we'll continue to monitor that.
00:21:26.460 - 00:21:49.840, Speaker B: The thing is, and this also is really awesome. Tailwinds behind ether the asset, right? Because not only is ether the asset, ultrasound money, but if it can match or exceed zcash in market cap, inside of tornado cash, it's also ultra private money. Right? Like, literally, ether gets all of the features. And that's why we're all bullish on ether, is because every single app that DFI comes to build benefits ether the most.
00:21:50.610 - 00:22:10.886, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so let's look at this, too. This is an interesting tweet I thought was worth pulling up. Wifi trades at a price to earnings ratio. PE ratio used in stocks of twelve. Currently twelve with annualized earnings of 85 million, based on May data. Price to earnings of twelve.
00:22:10.886 - 00:22:16.370, Speaker A: David, you don't see that anywhere. Anywhere, like in capital assets. Nowhere.
00:22:16.530 - 00:22:38.814, Speaker B: Even in a normal stock market, twelve is low. What about a high growth industry like Ethereum and DFI? I remember in 2017, we were all talking about how prices got so far ahead of their pe ratios. People, pe ratios of these stupid 2017 tokens were like in the bajillions. And YFI, which is generating a ton of revenue, is hitting at twelve. Like what?
00:22:39.012 - 00:23:21.514, Speaker A: It's just a reminder that we have real capital assets this cycle that are producing real revenues and profits that you can easily track on chain, totally different than 2017. Now, some people will say, yeah, but David, these earnings are based on token valuations elsewhere. Right? And so, like yield coming from all of this token farming, incentivized farming, and that is temporal, that will dry up at some point in the future. And that might be true. Right. I certainly understand kind of that take, but yet we're still at twelve. If you're going to compare this to something similar that happened in.com
00:23:21.514 - 00:23:45.310, Speaker A: where Yahoo had a crazy valuation. It's based on advertising generated from all the other dot coms, and it was all a big bubble anyway, at that time, Yahoo was not trading at twelve pe ratio, it's trading in the hundreds, if not the thousands. So I don't know, doesn't feel like a bubble to me. These are real capital assets. These are undiscovered assets, if you ask me. Pretty impressive.
00:23:45.390 - 00:24:00.760, Speaker B: And importantly, urine is putting on its balance sheet both its own equity. Right. The YfI token, but also eth. Right. So it's a pe ratio of twelve for ether, not for dollars. Right. And so that hits different, at least in my mind.
00:24:01.070 - 00:24:21.194, Speaker A: Yeah. And we're going to get to that. And it takes a wifi governance proposal that is going to do that. Let's take a look at this from David Mihal. This is Money movers, which blockchain is settling more value. We've got Ethereum here now surpassing bitcoin. And I think this is just stablecoins, David.
00:24:21.194 - 00:24:30.078, Speaker A: So stablecoin value on Ethereum has now passed bitcoin value settled on bitcoin for the first time since defi.
00:24:30.174 - 00:24:51.498, Speaker B: Oh, I see, right, okay, so what's going on here is not bitcoin stablecoin settlements because there used to be, and perhaps still is omni on bitcoin transferring stablecoins. What this is saying is stablecoins being transferred on ethereum is equal to the volume of BTC being transferred on bitcoin. Wow, that's crazy.
00:24:51.664 - 00:25:29.394, Speaker A: Yeah, it's crazy and it's huge. This is very much ethereum becoming the kind of the settlement layer for the world, I will say, although I will also say it's not quite an apples to apples comparison because we make this distinction with bitcoin on. Bitcoin is a bare asset. It's completely trustless. Right? Stablecoins on Ethereum, some of them are maybe like liquidity, the protocol we talked to earlier, but some are USDC and tether, and their settlement doesn't just happen on Ethereum, it also happens in meat space. So an interesting comparison, I think. Also not quite apples to apples, but maybe yet another flipping interesting.
00:25:29.512 - 00:25:46.630, Speaker B: I kind of think that's beside the point, beside the point of this particular take. This particular take is that Ethereum is being used to settle value. We can talk about the nature of that value and the banklessness of that value being settled, but I actually think that's a separate conversation to some degree. It's just like dollar settled versus dollar settled.
00:25:46.790 - 00:26:07.380, Speaker A: I actually think we'll get into some of that conversation when we talk about some of the layer twos that are popping up because I see a lot of this transaction settlement activity for low trust stablecoins or for less trustless stablecoins might start to happen on layer twos. Anyway, we'll get to that. All right, guys, we're going to be back with the hot releases next, but first we want to thank the sponsors who made this episode possible.
00:26:07.750 - 00:27:10.070, Speaker B: Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's V two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them.
00:27:10.070 - 00:27:45.594, Speaker B: Check out the power of aave@aave.com that's aave.com balancer is Defi's most powerful automated market maker. Typical Amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool, which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs. In defi, with Balancer, you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm, which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibilities. This makes balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases. Balancer pools can make asset indexes, but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers, Balancer lets you collect fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity.
00:27:45.594 - 00:28:32.010, Speaker B: Additionally, balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules, such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions, or even liquidity bootstrapping pools, which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity. At bankless, we used a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our Bap t shirts to much success. Balancer V two brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you. In V two, idle tokens are capable of generating yield in DFI without sacrificing liquidity in the pool. To top things off, balancer is reimbursing all gas costs with valve rewards, meaning that all your gas costs are returned to your wallet. With the balancer governance token, balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in DFI by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange. Dive into the balancer pools at pools.
00:28:32.010 - 00:28:33.790, Speaker B: Balancer exchange.
00:28:35.090 - 00:28:47.758, Speaker A: Here we go, guys. It is release time. David, we gotta start by talking about layer two. Layer two summer. Layer two. It is the night before layer two and all through the like, it feels.
00:28:47.774 - 00:28:50.566, Speaker B: Like everyone is stirring and waiting for it.
00:28:50.748 - 00:29:06.906, Speaker A: Everyone's talking about when's it coming? When's it coming? I feel like it's actually about to hit us like a tidal wave. And let's talk about why that might be the case. The first is arbitram launching maybe today. Today, as you're listening to this, not.
00:29:06.928 - 00:29:09.626, Speaker B: The day of recording, the day of you listening to this, the day of.
00:29:09.648 - 00:29:21.870, Speaker A: You listening to it, May 20. Eigth was supposed to be the day. Of course, we have arbitram on state of the nation on Tuesday, so we'll get the full update there. Make sure you tune into that. But why is arbitram interesting, David?
00:29:22.210 - 00:30:07.870, Speaker B: Because it is one of the two big l two s that is really true to the values and ethos of ethereum. Right? So we got optimism and we got arbitram. There are other l two s as well, but those are really the two pioneers in the world of cryptography that are extending the base layer security of Ethereum into the l two s with uncompromising decentralization and security. And there's about to be, in my opinion, a just rush to grab new real estate. Right? Like we've already seen applications deploy on Polygon ave sushi swap. Really competing with each other to get like TVL and liquidity inside of Polygon. And Polygon isn't even really the complete version of l two s that we all have been talking about for the past like six months.
00:30:07.870 - 00:30:26.770, Speaker B: That's optimism. And arbitrum. And Arbitrum launches tomorrow for developers, and there's just going to be a race to get in and start deploying on arbitrum. And the magnitude of how this is going to change the user experience for the general defi user can't be understated. Everything is about to change. Everything is about to change.
00:30:26.920 - 00:31:11.522, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. So this take a new scaling project has entered the sidechain chat. Arbitrum is not a side chain, interestingly enough, so coindesk not quite right. Arbitrum is what we would call a layer two. That means it is secured by the Ethereum mainet, similar settlement guarantees, and economically secured by eth, the asset first one of these to launch with an EVM. So that means all of the Defi projects you know and love on Ethereum mainnet can be fairly seamlessly ported over to Arbitrum. And I think they're not just launching like hey, we're live, they're going to be launching with a whole bunch of projects and we'll find out more, I guess tomorrow or today maybe for the listener, and then also on Tuesday when we talk to them.
00:31:11.522 - 00:31:45.850, Speaker A: But this was interesting from Hayden Adams. The Uniswap community has spoken and with overwhelming support in favor of an arbitram deployment of Uniswap v three. Uniswap deploying an arbitram david it was not too long ago where we talked to Hayden about his layer two plans, and Uniswap was very much of the opinion that like, hey, we want to maximize for decentralization, so roll up solution is the way to go. They were thinking optimism at the time. That is definitely still the path forward. But now it looks like the community is pushing them to explore arbitram as well, and Uniswap is going to be there. Very exciting.
00:31:45.850 - 00:31:46.878, Speaker A: What do you make of this?
00:31:46.964 - 00:32:22.810, Speaker B: I mean, to some degree you literally have no costs, few costs to deploy on every viable l two. Why not? Plus let the market decide, like deploy everywhere let the market choose. But you can't let the market choose without deploying to every single possible spot. And arbitrum is a very viable spot to deploy. You literally have no reason not to. And maybe they both work out, and it's only beneficial to uni token holders to have surface area on optimism and arbitrum and polygon, for that matter, wherever people are, just allow the market to express itself. And so I think defi apps are about to be deployed everywhere.
00:32:23.230 - 00:33:04.770, Speaker A: It does seem uniswap so far has opted to deploy in the most decentralized chains only, which means, like, roll up chains, optimism, and arbitrum. But maybe polygon at some point too, a little like it's less. Polygon is, of course, more of a side chain, less of a layer two at this point, but they're moving in that direction as well. This kind of brought it home to me. That optimism is coming as well. Okay, so optimism on Etherscan, David, I know you've used polygon, right? So this is also why it's so exciting to see these roll up solutions, because defi on polygon with no gas fees is like, it's really fun, and it's great. You can experiment.
00:33:04.770 - 00:33:09.254, Speaker A: It just works with metamask, the same defi tool used to.
00:33:09.292 - 00:33:20.682, Speaker B: It's great. No cost for experimentation, because transactions are basically free and instant. It's like, oh, do I want to try this thing out? I don't even have to think twice because it's free. I'll do it. I'll do it. If I don't like it, I'll also undo it. No cost.
00:33:20.816 - 00:33:45.202, Speaker A: Yeah. The people who are priced out of Ethereum can use polygon, but it makes some trade offs, of course. But to me, polygon is sort of a proof of concept. Will there be demand for an EVM roll up chain? Yes, absolutely there will. Why? Because we've seen polygon, we've seen even binance chain with the EVM. Massive amount of demand on both of those chains. So to me, we've got product market fit.
00:33:45.202 - 00:33:54.214, Speaker A: Anyway, this is about optimistic roll ups on ether scan. So when you use Polygon, you don't have the ether scan block explorer, which.
00:33:54.252 - 00:33:56.146, Speaker B: I personally really annoying.
00:33:56.178 - 00:33:58.966, Speaker A: Yeah, but here it is. Right, you can click here.
00:33:59.148 - 00:34:31.330, Speaker B: And this is what the UI of this roll ups are going to be. Right? With your metamask, if you want to go and use polygon, you go to metamask, and instead of using the Ethereum main chain, you take the drop down bar and you hit polygon. That's going to be the same exact thing for both arbitrum and optimism. You're just going to select a different network. And the fact that you can just fork ether scan and do like, oh, yeah, the optimistic ether scan, which ether scan is like one of the great blessings just given to. And the fact that we can just have the same thing on optimism is so awesome, so exciting.
00:34:31.910 - 00:34:50.326, Speaker A: This is why we're excited about layer two summer. This is why, David, I feel like this is coming like a tidal wave, because this stuff is not just going to launch, it's going to launch with actual defi projects that we use today that already have product market fit. Let's go to the next take here. Oh, here's a question that came up that I think we should address.
00:34:50.428 - 00:34:58.426, Speaker B: And before we do, listeners, if you have questions that you want us to address, and they're good questions, we will address them. So that's a through line here.
00:34:58.608 - 00:35:22.770, Speaker A: Yeah, here's a question. Love what you guys do at bankless. My question, how can eth's value benefit from layer twos? Wouldn't scalability decrease gas and therefore also the coming deflationary burning of gas compared to current state? So that's the question, David, is like, are these layer twos actually competitive with Ethereum and with Ethereum block space? Why don't you take a first stab at this question?
00:35:22.840 - 00:36:07.966, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, this is a really awesome conversation. First off, there is this concept of induced demand, right? And so this is one of the big reasons why bitcoin, with its scaling debate with bitcoin versus bitcoin cash, and also Ethereum with raising the block size too much, is also relevant here. If you just scale up the Ethereum blockchain, you don't actually relieve fees at the base layer because people just become to use it more. Like the more scale you have, there's a basal level of what people will pay for, and people are going to pay for that no matter what. And so if we scale the base layer, people are just going to use that more. And so moving volume activity off of the base chain onto l two s means that other people are free to use the base layer because there's more freedom there. And so there's just going to be this induced demand.
00:36:07.966 - 00:37:19.170, Speaker B: And that's why we just don't skyrocket the block size to infinity to allow for that transactional capacity. That's why we don't do that because we know the fees are just going to come regard or the transactional demand is going to come regardless. The other thing is that if you are on an Ethereum l two, like optimism or arbitrum, you are still committed to the Ethereum base layer, right? Your transactional activity and optimism and arbitram and all these l two s, the volume of economic activity can be really, really hot, but it's still like locked into the ethereum ecosystem, right? If you ever want to get off of the arbitram l two, you're going back to Ethereum. And so we talked about this with Nick Carter and on his block space Cycle podcast article, which is really good article and podcast. To understand the Ethereum gas markets, he uses concept of a governor and how a governor, a governor is a mechanism, not like a governor of a city governor is like a tool. And a governor is how the steam engine began to work, where if the steam engine gets too hot, it puts a bunch of energy into these weighted spinning, like metal balls that have a lot of mass and they spin around really fast. And that's how a steam engine can self regulate.
00:37:19.170 - 00:38:41.582, Speaker B: And that's the metaphor I use for the Ethereum base layer, where if the Ethereum base layer is getting too hot and fees are getting too high, it expends energy by putting it into the l two s, right? And then the l two s suck up some of that demand to transact. Then if the Ethereum base layer starts to cool off, the spinning governors, the spinning weighted balls, those are allowed to decrease in energy and put potential energy back into the main chain. And so once the fees on the main chain come down, people can come back from the l two s. And because the fees are cheaper, and so they come back from arbitram, they come back from optimism, and they say, oh, the fees on Ethereum just went from like a bajillion gas to a much more reasonable amount of gas. Let's go back to the main chain, right? And so it keeps economic activity on Ethereum really, really sticky, and it allows for a much broader set of economic use cases overall, right? And so like arbitrum and all these l two s where transactions are going to be free and instant, all of a sudden that opens up a brand new domain of economic activities that we have never been able to do before on the Ethereum base layer. And so it's creating new economic activity and it's stuck on Ethereum, it's sticky to Ethereum. And so overall, just more activity on Ethereum that is ultimately secured by ether.
00:38:41.582 - 00:38:57.800, Speaker B: The asset at the main chain is always good. Maybe there's some relief of gas fees and there is literally less gas fees being burnt. But the stickiness and the centrality of this economic activity to Ethereum is the through line, and that's what we should be focusing on.
00:38:58.330 - 00:39:44.614, Speaker A: I'll note also that chains like arbitrum and optimistic roll ups, optimism, they literally require ETH as a bonding mechanism in order to have them operate, and for some of their security guarantees. We'll talk with the arbitram team about that next Tuesday. But because of all you said, David, what tends to happen is there's an important concept of economic density, right? There was a time when really ridiculous transactions occurred on bitcoin. When I say ridiculous, I just mean like, very low volume, low value activities occurred on bitcoin. Like, there's kind of like a bitcoin pixel type game where you just select a pixel and that would be a know transaction. Satoshi's place. Yeah, Satoshi's place.
00:39:44.614 - 00:39:47.734, Speaker A: Right. Eric, did Eric Voorhees, was he behind that? No, I can't remember.
00:39:47.772 - 00:39:55.162, Speaker B: It's Satoshi's dice. Satoshi's dice, right, but same point. Weird. Like, low value transactions that are just.
00:39:55.216 - 00:40:36.498, Speaker A: Locked space was cheap. Why not? Now it's permanently on the bitcoin ledger. We would never imagine a Satoshi's dice game like today. Similarly, it doesn't really make sense to have low value transactions on Ethereum today. The idea of breeding a crypto kitty the way that we did in 2017 and issuing that on Ethereum that would not work, does not fly today. So what tends to happen is what will tend to happen is higher economic density transactions will occur on Ethereum. These are the transactions that are high amounts, like high value, and also require high degrees of trustlessness and decentralization.
00:40:36.498 - 00:41:14.226, Speaker A: And so the transactions will get more and more and more dense over time until you might be left with entire transactions that occur on Ethereum that are compilations of entire chains, like economic activities of entire chains. I think of this kind of as the suburbs versus cities analogy too, David. It's like when New York City starts building other suburbs, it doesn't take away from New York City. It actually is additive to New York City and the metropolitan inner city type area and the economic activity of that.
00:41:14.328 - 00:41:18.806, Speaker B: People are so committed to living in Manhattan, even though they can't, that they just live next to.
00:41:18.988 - 00:41:45.486, Speaker A: Exactly, exactly. So I think that all of these, even the side chains, David, like, even Binat smart chain, is actually additive to Ethereum, right? Because it's using the EVM, it's know onboarding people into Defi, and they eventually graduate into Ethereum or another roll up. It's like all additive. So great question. Hopefully that answers some of it. We'll see how it all plays out. But I'm excited at the end of.
00:41:45.508 - 00:42:11.030, Speaker B: This conversation is the protocol sync thesis. Right? Like, the reason why binance smart chain is additive to Ethereum is because things settle down to the most secure and strongly held settlement assurances in the planet. And that's where Ether and Ethereum is. And so the more things we could do that's proximate to that, the more things fall down. The protocol sink. We haven't talked about the protocol sink in a while, Ryan, we should kick that up again.
00:42:11.180 - 00:42:40.350, Speaker A: We definitely should. Guys. We'll try to include some resources on that in the show notes to talk about another time. David, another thing is Polygon has released some really interesting news. They are announcing a Polygon SDK. And here's why I think this is interesting, is because this SDK allows you to build other polygon side chains. So, David, we talked earlier about Ethereum kind of eating apps, like eating privacy as an app.
00:42:40.350 - 00:43:16.662, Speaker A: One other interesting concept that was birthed in 2017, 2018 was this idea of the cosmos, which is a separate chain. And it takes a different approach than Ethereum. You have sort of all of these different side chains, essentially, that pay for their own security and that essentially are transmitted through the Cosmos hub. That was a really interesting project. I think remains an interesting project. There's some cool stuff being built on that. Essentially what Polygon is doing here is giving you an SDK.
00:43:16.662 - 00:43:45.890, Speaker A: So if you're a developer, you want to create your own app chain. You can create your own app chain as a sidechain. So there might be the idea of Ethereum through Polygon kind of eating this whole app chain. Cosmos idea, except settlement occurs through Ethereum rather than a cosmos hub. That's why I think this is an interesting move for Polygon. We'll see how it plays out.
00:43:46.040 - 00:44:17.354, Speaker B: Yeah. There's a famous through line that was originally created by bitcoiners, which is anything that's actually useful will ultimately become built on bitcoin. Some bitcoiners still say that that's actually becoming true on Ethereum. We talked about Zcash. Zcash is being built on Ethereum in the form of tornado cash. EOS was built on Ethereum as well with this loom network, but neither of those things worked out. The thing is, if it is a good idea, the whole point of what Vitalik calls functionality, escape velocity.
00:44:17.354 - 00:44:31.220, Speaker B: If it can be built and it's useful, it will be built on Ethereum. And that's the power of the EVM. That's what the EVM can do. If it's useful, you can deploy it on the EVM. And if it is useful, you might as well deploy it onto Ethereum because that's where everyone else is.
00:44:31.750 - 00:44:52.118, Speaker A: Yeah, this kind of reminds me of the cosmos model, except with the EVM, basically. And so you get some of that network effect. All right, David, let's move a bit faster here so we get through the releases. Gitcoin just released a gitcoin Dow governance token. We've talked about that a ton on state of the nation. Go check that out. Any words on this release?
00:44:52.214 - 00:45:41.986, Speaker B: Yeah, Kevin Owalki is really pioneering what it means to Dow. And I think the cool thing about gitcoin token, and maybe I'm biased here, but Gitcoin is a off chain Dao in the sense that like uniswap, yearn, sushiswap, those are on chain daos. They have protocols that they operate with gitcoin, bank, bankless Dao, metafactory, these are off chain daos. These are different kinds of daos where people collect in the meat space world, usually on discord, and they figure out what to do and they figure out how to progress. And so these are really just digital organizations that don't necessarily have smart contracts on Ethereum, yet still operate as a distributed organization. And so I'm really optimistic about the future of Gitcoin Dow. There is a ton of reasons to be really excited.
00:45:41.986 - 00:45:59.200, Speaker B: It's kind of like the Dao of daos in the sense that gitcoin as a platform funds other public goods and dows are kind of like public goods. There's a whole incredible bullish thesis that will never ever come out of the Gitcoin team because of reasons. But I'll say it.
00:46:00.290 - 00:46:20.294, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And by the way, quick PsA. If you've ever given to a Gitcoin grant or opened one yourself, you should go check out to see if you're eligible to receive GTC tokens as well. All right, last release here. Coinbase Institutional is announcing the unveiling of some new offerings here. David, what's this about?
00:46:20.412 - 00:47:07.678, Speaker B: Yeah, basically they are. I think this is kind of like, there's some real products here, but more of this is just a rebrand of Coinbase's traditional products in an institutional package. All of Coinbase's products are just being kind of reorbed into a little box and then presented to institutions and like, oh, we have Coinbase institutional now. I think really the main feature is this integration between deep cold storage with insurance, which gives institutions peace of mind, but allowing that cold storage to fluidly interact with Coinbase the. So it allows for safe and secure and insured custody, but also liquidity when the time comes for it. And so this is now Coinbase institutions like next to Coinbase Pro and Coinbase custody. And Coinbase.
00:47:07.694 - 00:47:17.782, Speaker A: Yeah, look, they want to be the crypto bank for institutions, right? So they want to replicate Michael Saylor's we're buying bitcoin for our treasury success over and over again with every single.
00:47:17.836 - 00:47:20.950, Speaker B: Institution and company powered by Coinbase institution.
00:47:21.110 - 00:47:39.882, Speaker A: Exactly. So it's definitely a good play. We'll get more institutions into crypto. All right, David, that is it for releases. Let's switch over to news man. I think the leading news this week is two billionaires, Carl Icann, Ray Dalio, talking about crypto and also China. China Fud.
00:47:39.882 - 00:48:03.014, Speaker A: Maybe not unrelated to the billionaires going on. China, unrelated. Two separate topics. Let's talk about the billionaires first. This is Carl Icann. So he is a famous billionaire activist, investor, corporate raider, some would call him. I just remember times where he has basically invested a whole bunch of money into companies and totally shaken them up.
00:48:03.014 - 00:48:27.758, Speaker A: Like remove the CEO, install a new management team, write a letter to shareholders. He is an activist investor. Now he's talking about Ethereum, and now he's talking about bitcoin. And some of the quotes here are pretty phenomenal, pretty crazy. So he says with Ethereum, it's the underlying blockchain. So Ethereum has two things. You can use it as a payment system and you can use it as a store of value.
00:48:27.758 - 00:48:38.370, Speaker A: Payment system and store of value. Ethereum, he's talking about. Not bitcoin. So he says. So Ethereum and bitcoin are different. Bitcoin to me is just a store of value. Wow.
00:48:38.370 - 00:48:45.026, Speaker A: He's getting into the store of value versus, like, what's a blockchain? Can there be more?
00:48:45.128 - 00:48:52.086, Speaker B: Basically, the through line that I'm hearing there is that ethereum has an app layer and it's a store of value.
00:48:52.188 - 00:48:52.454, Speaker A: Right?
00:48:52.492 - 00:49:02.098, Speaker B: That's what he's really saying. The blockchain is like, oh yeah, there's things to do there. And there's a native store of value. That's the through line that I think he's clueing into.
00:49:02.284 - 00:49:39.474, Speaker A: He also says he wants to get into crypto in a relatively big way. Right. So what does he say? I mean, a big way for us would be a billion dollars. A billion and a half dollars? I'm not going to say. Exactly. Which leads to the question, right? Carl Icann operated in these markets for who knows how long, knows how to manipulate media, knows how this game is played. If Carl has not already bought a billion dollars worth of ETH and bitcoin, like, already, why in the world is he announcing that he's about to do something big in crypto and maybe, like, hinting buy a billion dollars worth of Ethan bitcoin?
00:49:39.522 - 00:49:42.838, Speaker B: Are you saying that this is like psyops and he's actually already done it, or what?
00:49:42.844 - 00:49:58.378, Speaker A: Are you not? Yes, that's what I'm saying, David. If he's on media tv doing this, I don't know for sure. He's got to have positions in some of these assets. Why is he saying this?
00:49:58.544 - 00:50:06.426, Speaker B: I mean, incentives would align with your thesis, right? Who has the incentive to shill before they fill their bag?
00:50:06.538 - 00:50:15.134, Speaker A: Incentives. But also, like, this is what this guy does. It's his playbook, right? Like, he's an activist investor, implying that.
00:50:15.172 - 00:50:21.698, Speaker B: Over a billion dollars of buying demand is going to be coming into these assets, even though it maybe has already happened.
00:50:21.864 - 00:50:24.818, Speaker A: Look, I'm just asking the question. Who knows what Carl's done?
00:50:24.904 - 00:50:32.950, Speaker B: Maybe Carl filled his bags during the Sunday drop when everyone got spooked and he bought their spooked bags.
00:50:33.370 - 00:50:55.146, Speaker A: Some are predicting that he plans to manipulate it further. So he's just saying that, and then he's going to, like, game on down and then whatever. We've already seen a 66% drop. You can't scare us, Carl. Let's talk about Dahlia. This is a bit more of a long term thinker investor. A lot different class of billionaire, I guess, than Carl Icann.
00:50:55.146 - 00:51:24.920, Speaker A: But he came out, I watched his presentation of Coindesk on Monday, and he said this. I have some bitcoin. He talked about crypto. He talked about bitcoin. He talked about bitcoin being a better buy than bonds. Man. Dahlia is one of my favorite thinkers in this space, right? Because he thinks historically about money and how macro currencies have changed over history.
00:51:24.920 - 00:51:58.158, Speaker A: So he goes back to the british pound and before, and then he talks about fiat as sort of a passing regime. All fiat monies have failed eventually. And so he thinks we're in a late credit debt cycle. Late debt cycle, basically. And that fiat and the US is the world reserve currency is on its way out, about to be replaced by something else. So his message is like, position yourself. Historically, the positioning has been all about commodities and gold, but now he is getting crypto friendly.
00:51:58.158 - 00:52:42.286, Speaker A: He also talked about DeFi, being very excited about Defi, and he also mentioned Ethereum in that conversation. And he was, like, asking to be educated further on Defi and Ethereum. So he also said he wasn't convinced that bitcoin could win. He said bitcoins could be a victim of its own success. So he was worried about bitcoin and other crypto assets becoming large enough to start threatening nation states, and the nation states reacting to them in a very negative way. Of course, the crypto response to that is like, yeah, when that's a problem, crypto is going to be really big, so maybe you should still buy now. But anyway, really good conversation with Dahlia, and it feels like he's definitely warming up.
00:52:42.286 - 00:52:45.070, Speaker A: He owns crypto. That's pretty crazy.
00:52:45.140 - 00:52:54.690, Speaker B: It sounds like Dalio is ready to come on bankless. It sounds like it's time for us to finally talk to Ray Dalio. I know he's been itching to come on. I'm sure he has been.
00:52:54.760 - 00:53:01.954, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm sure he's listening. So, Dahlia, if you're listening, we'd love to have you on bankless. Love your thesis for the space, David.
00:53:02.082 - 00:53:09.160, Speaker B: I think he bought bitcoin a while ago. I think he bought bitcoin before he accepted being a speaker at consensus. And that was, like, months ago.
00:53:09.690 - 00:53:16.714, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, got to be, had to have. I don't know if his fund has, though. Just different. Bridgewater. Bridgewater. I don't know if his fund has.
00:53:16.714 - 00:53:22.634, Speaker A: If that's personal or what. All right, let's talk China. So, David, you know more about this. You start.
00:53:22.752 - 00:53:44.242, Speaker B: Right, okay. So there is this meme of China bans bitcoin, happens in bull markets. It happens once every two to three months. Happened like, seven times in 2017. It's already happened, like, two or three times so far this cycle. This time, apparently, it's different, and specifically not bitcoin, but bitcoin mining, I think. And so the rumors are.
00:53:44.242 - 00:54:18.240, Speaker B: And if you really want to dive deeper into this, go follow Nick Carter and listen to what he's been saying. But bitcoin miners are leaving China out of fear. Of fear. Out of fear, I guess. And so the bitcoin mining hash rate has been noticed to have been migrating out of certain areas in China elsewhere. And that's perhaps one of the big reasons as to why bitcoin fell off and dumped off, because bitcoin miners needed to liquidate their positions to fund their costs of moving entire operations. So this is a big deal.
00:54:18.240 - 00:54:27.554, Speaker B: There's a lot of hash power in China. And so getting moving hash power out of China is a costly endeavor just because of the magnitude of how.
00:54:27.592 - 00:54:28.862, Speaker A: Where are they going, David?
00:54:29.006 - 00:55:02.302, Speaker B: I don't know. I don't know. Elsewhere. But the through line is elsewhere. And so bitcoin miners are leaving, and this has really changed the narrative game. Bitcoiners are trying to change the narrative game with this, and rightfully so. This is words out of Nick Carter, where hash power leaving China is really bullish for bitcoin from the american United States perspective, because hash power gets cleaner, because we are killing dirty hash power, and it's migrating to cleaner sources, and it's also influxing into the United States.
00:55:02.302 - 00:55:26.420, Speaker B: And so chinese mining hash power dominance is coming down, and more decentralization, more decentralized hash power is rising up. And then it's also greener is the throughline narrative. And so this has caused short term pain, but long term optimism for the world of bitcoin mining and green mining. That's the TLDR. Okay, all right, here we go.
00:55:27.030 - 00:56:19.094, Speaker A: What's interesting about this, of course, I could see bitcoiners wanting to get ahead of the narrative and saying, this is dirty hash power going to clean. Of course, you've made the point that, hey, it's super clean is proof of stake. It's not consuming 9.9% reduction in energy use. But that aside, what's interesting about this is it is a regime, a nation state led regime, cracking down on block validation through miners. What would this look like in an e two staking sort of world, where you don't have these large servers, like mining facilities, consuming bundles of energy? You've got a staking rig, maybe at your house, right? Does an authoritarian nation state crack down on that? That feels a lot different to me.
00:56:19.132 - 00:56:19.718, Speaker B: Right?
00:56:19.884 - 00:56:29.660, Speaker A: Rather than a handful of companies that you can go target, you're actively targeting your citizens. Crazy dystopian stuff to think about, right?
00:56:31.390 - 00:57:08.298, Speaker B: One thing to take away from this is that the footprint of bitcoin mining is always a liability. What's the opposite of liability? An asset. It's never an asset. It's a liability through and through. And not only is the physical footprint, but, like, the energy consumption, it doesn't matter if it's green or whatever, or if it's literally solar powered coming from a Dyson sphere, it's a footprint either way. How many people are googling Dyson sphere right now anyways? Energy consumption liability. That's why we like proof of stake, because you can stake your ethereum node through Tor.
00:57:08.298 - 00:57:15.446, Speaker B: And I mean, if you're a computer science expert, you can stake inside of China and they'll never find out. Not advice, though.
00:57:15.548 - 00:57:37.118, Speaker A: This is not, don't listen to me. I'm not an expert. This is not a big deal, though, for bitcoin. I don't think, like, miners leave from China, they go elsewhere, right? There's a hash drop, maybe, but we get some more decentralization out of good. All good seems like good trade, but.
00:57:37.204 - 00:57:43.482, Speaker B: Not an asymmetric trade, just like positive linear trade, but it's not moving the needle over the long term.
00:57:43.626 - 00:57:57.982, Speaker A: There you go. All right, let's talk about this Ethereum stuff. Cuban is investing in polygon. That's our friend Mark Cuban, who's been on the podcast before. I was a polygon user, and I find myself using it more and more. He said an email. So what does he do? He invests.
00:57:57.982 - 00:58:03.718, Speaker A: It's a pretty big name to draw into a side chain layer, two type project. Kind of cool.
00:58:03.804 - 00:58:26.762, Speaker B: Yeah. And again, once again, it's always really cool to see Mark Cuban using this stuff. And I kind of feel like that's been the through line of polygon over the last month is like, oh, people just find themselves on polygon because of reasons. They buy it cheaper gas fees like Ave on polygon, like matic token yield farming. And then all of a sudden like, oh, I guess I should just buy this because it's real estate. It's real estate. It's a suburb of Manhattan.
00:58:26.762 - 00:58:30.522, Speaker B: And if people are there, people want the real estate. And so that's why they're buying matic token.
00:58:30.666 - 00:58:49.718, Speaker A: That's definitely the narrative. Let's talk about this, David. You see the Wall Street Journal front page? I don't even think it's the headline. The headline is upstart peer to peer crypto exchange takes aim at Coinbase. Who are they talking about? Wall Street Journal. Finally talking about uniswap, right? But this picture, dude, is Hilarious. Describe this picture for people.
00:58:49.804 - 00:59:08.586, Speaker B: It's not the headline. That's the headline. It's the picture. That's the headline. And the real headline is, bankers, meet your worst fucking enemy. A nerdy looking white guy in a unicorn t shirt, Hayden Adams is coming to destroy your fucking banks. Oh my God.
00:59:08.586 - 00:59:13.418, Speaker B: Yes. Meet your worst enemy, a software developer on top of Ethereum.
00:59:13.594 - 00:59:32.850, Speaker A: It's good. Didn't ask for permission, just built this thing. Two years later, it's already threatening the banks, making the Wall Street Journal, doing hundreds of millions in transaction revenue annualized. How many assets on there. 50,000 different assets. Like, crazy stuff. I love it.
00:59:32.850 - 00:59:34.638, Speaker A: I love these types of headlines.
00:59:34.734 - 00:59:40.870, Speaker B: Hayden Adams is like, hey, banks, that's a nice TDL you got there. It would be a shame if somebody came and took it.
00:59:41.020 - 00:59:44.690, Speaker A: Yeah. Hey, NAsdaq. Nice volume, guys. Oops.
00:59:44.770 - 00:59:45.362, Speaker B: Oops.
00:59:45.426 - 01:00:01.722, Speaker A: It's all on uniswap now. Too fun. All right, this is fun, too. NFT gamestop.com. Gamestop.com is the URL. GameStop is entering the NFT game, entering the blockchain game.
01:00:01.722 - 01:00:04.254, Speaker A: They're doing so on Ethereum, it looks.
01:00:04.292 - 01:00:06.190, Speaker B: Like with Ethereum branding.
01:00:06.690 - 01:00:09.966, Speaker A: What's this? Why? What's happening here? Do we know?
01:00:10.068 - 01:00:37.442, Speaker B: I copied that address and I put it into the ether scan and it's got a GameStop token that people are trying to interact with, a contract address, but nothing's happening. I don't know what that is. But importantly, this is just a landing page. NFT gamestop.com. And it says, we are building a team. We welcome exceptional engineers, solidity react, python designers, gamers, marketers, and community leaders. If you want to join our team, send your profile or something you've built to NFT.
01:00:37.442 - 01:01:09.326, Speaker B: Okay, nFt.com. Just one t shout out to Matt Finestone for leading this goddamn charge with GameStop. Congratulations for landing that gig. Matt Finestone, formerly at loop ring, is the guy that is leading the NFT charge into GameStop. Fun fact, GME is the only asset that I own that's not a crypto asset. And the reason why I buy it was 100% a political reason. I bought one share at like $330, which is like, literally the top when it first pumped.
01:01:09.326 - 01:01:13.634, Speaker B: And I was like, oh, I clued into the story. Fuck the hedge fund.
01:01:13.672 - 01:01:16.034, Speaker A: That was. We talked about it after the hedge fund, right? Yeah.
01:01:16.072 - 01:01:38.618, Speaker B: Literally bought it as, like, I'm doing my part. And then it dropped to like $130. And I bought you help. And I bought two more, bought double down. And now, right in this moment of time, the short squeeze is on again. The price of GameStop right now is at like $240 or something. And the fact that it's happening during this NFT release is so fucking perfect.
01:01:38.618 - 01:01:42.726, Speaker B: It's so awesome. Let's see what the actual current price is right now. $240, right?
01:01:42.768 - 01:01:48.720, Speaker A: This is David getting addicted to the Wall street bet stuff. Different show. No longer going to be d fight.
01:01:49.250 - 01:02:07.234, Speaker B: Gamestop. We're adding a Gamestop section back into the weekly roll ups. Anyways, Matthew Finestone, congratulations for leading this NFT team. If you liked nfts and you want to help out GameStop, squeeze the shit out of some shorts, go sign up for them and help them build out nfts. In the world of gaming, you know.
01:02:07.272 - 01:02:29.414, Speaker A: Whatever it's going to be built on, if Matt's involved, it's going to be on a roll up of some sort. So we got that to look forward to. And maybe the GME community will start to wake up and Wall street bets community will start to wake up and join Defi. I think there's a kindred spirit there that hasn't been tapped into. All right, let's talk bitcoin stuff. Michael Saylor, did he buy bitcoin this week? No, that's not the headline.
01:02:29.462 - 01:02:30.442, Speaker B: He probably did, but.
01:02:30.576 - 01:02:40.800, Speaker A: He probably did. But he is hosting with Elon Musk a bitcoin miners in North America sort of council, I guess.
01:02:41.570 - 01:02:43.066, Speaker B: Mining council.
01:02:43.258 - 01:02:44.462, Speaker A: Not cartel, sir.
01:02:44.516 - 01:02:46.838, Speaker B: Not council. Different. Seaweed.
01:02:46.874 - 01:02:57.694, Speaker A: Different. Okay, so what's this about? This is like a handshake with Elon Musk sort of thing from Michael Saylor. I get that. What is the mining council overall?
01:02:57.742 - 01:03:31.246, Speaker B: I'm wary that Elon Musk is still talking about bitcoin stuff and dabbling in the bitcoin world, but I'll patiently wait to see this play out. Elon Musk says spoke with north american bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current and planned renewable usage to ask miners Ww don't know what that is to do. So, potentially promising worldwide. Ask miners worldwide to be more green. So this is a rebranding exercise, like, hey, bitcoin miners, we're going to get effed by mainstream media and public opinion about the dirtiness of bitcoin. So we got to do something about it.
01:03:31.246 - 01:04:13.946, Speaker B: We got to get green. And so then Michael Saylor retweets this and says, the miners have agreed to form the bitcoin mining Council to promote energy usage, transparency and accelerate sustainability initiatives worldwide. This is, in my mind, a capitulation on the green energy narrative, where we have people like Nick Carter, who is fighting and saying, bitcoin mining is way more green than you think it is, and it's actually going to incentivize completely renewable green energy. Really tall order for trying to get that narrative to stick. And I can't really, even though Nick Carter has been doing a valiant effort and praise Nick Carter, like Saint Nick Carter, it's not working. It's not working. And so Michael Saylor and Elon Musk are capitulating and say, like, all right, we're going to have to take bitcoin mining.
01:04:13.946 - 01:04:19.566, Speaker B: And not passively just say that the narrative is green, but we're actually going to have to make this green.
01:04:19.748 - 01:04:24.062, Speaker A: Okay, well, the Council of bitcoin Miners is somewhat different.
01:04:24.116 - 01:04:24.622, Speaker B: Through line.
01:04:24.676 - 01:04:49.766, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, here's another through line, then. This is from Mariano, so I think he's doing some satire here, but maybe coming to a future near you is sort of the angle in quotes. After careful consideration, your address has been flagged as suspicious by the North American Bitcoin Miners association. Unfortunately for you, our decision is final and cannot be appealed. Thank you for using bitcoin. Trademark powered by Tesla.
01:04:49.766 - 01:05:06.202, Speaker A: Registered trademark. This is Mariana's take on a possible future. Right. Like, you may not disagree with this, but the fact that a cabal is forming of bitcoin miners, that is, like, not a cabal.
01:05:06.266 - 01:05:07.546, Speaker B: A council, Ryan. A council.
01:05:07.578 - 01:05:13.310, Speaker A: A council, sir. Sorry. Where do cabal start? Do they start as councils? I don't know.
01:05:13.380 - 01:05:14.900, Speaker B: Just blurry line.
01:05:16.950 - 01:05:22.350, Speaker A: They start. I mean, Star wars has taught us. Star wars there. Like a council that evil.
01:05:22.430 - 01:05:22.866, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:05:22.968 - 01:05:45.898, Speaker A: Okay. All right. Anyway, this is not an evil council, but Mariano is not sure where this is going. And it would be not a good thing if a set of miners could start censoring transactions or colluding in some way to make bitcoin a whole lot less decentralized. Is that a possible future here, or is that kind of, I guess, overplaying it? Absolutely.
01:05:45.984 - 01:06:26.102, Speaker B: This is exactly. Going back to the conversation of footprint is a liability, right? Because now miners are under the nation state purview, because they are completely just like, open and known to public entities by the nature of proof of work. You kind of have to join this council and be a part of it, right? And all of a sudden, all these decentralized miners are coming to become part of one single council. Where's the decentralization there? That is just an attack vector. It's like, oh, the United States government wants to interact more aggressively with the bitcoin blockchain. It'll just go to the bitcoin mining council and tell them to do exactly what they want them to do.
01:06:26.156 - 01:06:29.238, Speaker A: Look, man, the problem is, because you can't run a minor in your house.
01:06:29.324 - 01:06:31.210, Speaker B: Can't run a minor, it's not profitable to do.
01:06:31.360 - 01:07:01.060, Speaker A: Like, readers should know. The same thing could happen with Ethereum if we were only staking through crypto banks, for instance, Coinbase and Kraken and Gemini and binance, and there was no ability or appetite or interest in running validating nodes like on a consumer laptop, or maybe even the blockchain. Didn't have that capability. Be the same sort of attack vector. Same sort of attack vector. That's why decentralization of these networks is so important.
01:07:02.390 - 01:07:04.094, Speaker B: Anyways, good joke, Mariana.
01:07:04.222 - 01:07:08.198, Speaker A: There you go, Mariana. We made it. Not funny, but it was funny. All right.
01:07:08.284 - 01:07:13.170, Speaker B: It's not funny. It's a funny joke. It's not funny, though. It's an existential threat to our industry.
01:07:13.250 - 01:07:44.958, Speaker A: Agreed? Yeah, agreed. All right, let's talk regulatory. Traditional finance businesses need to report crypto transfers. That's what the US treasury is saying. If you are an exchange or some sort of crypto business, and there's a crypto transfer of more than ten k, you have to report that to the IRS. A lot of tax news in the headlines this tax season, but the IRS is definitely trying to crack down on people who are not reporting their gains or their crypto transactions. I think that's partially where this is coming from.
01:07:44.958 - 01:07:55.394, Speaker A: This does not extend to individuals right now, but it definitely does to businesses. Right? This is like bankless always says, pay your taxes, guys. It's all in the blockchain. They're going to find out.
01:07:55.432 - 01:07:55.918, Speaker B: Don't fight that.
01:07:55.944 - 01:08:08.098, Speaker A: Don't screw with it. Don't fight that fight. But, yeah, maybe a mark of things to come. IRS getting more serious about crypto. Definitely getting exchange transactions into the mix.
01:08:08.194 - 01:08:26.960, Speaker B: Right. I want to draw up this important point. It's just $10,000 in and out of reporting entities like businesses. Right? So $10,000 to Coinbase, to Gemini, to cash app, whatever. Those entities have to report that $10,000. You sending $10,000 to your buddy directly, peer to peer. That's not what this is talking about.
01:08:26.960 - 01:08:40.914, Speaker B: However, there is something to say about this $10,000 level. I think this is also true for banks. Right? So if you come and deposit $10,000 into banks, they do a report as well, saying like, hey, this person deposited $10,000.
01:08:41.032 - 01:08:43.700, Speaker A: Wait, do you have a bank story this week?
01:08:45.030 - 01:08:45.538, Speaker B: No.
01:08:45.624 - 01:08:47.538, Speaker A: Do you want to tell that story? Okay, never mind.
01:08:47.624 - 01:09:13.002, Speaker B: Here's a story I do want to tell. And once again, it's another Nick Carter story. The $10,000 limit was set in the 70s where the real value of $10,000 in, like, the 60s or 70s or whenever this law was created was roughly $65,000 now. Right? And so this is a story of inflation as a hidden, oppressive force upon the people, where privacy used to be up to $65,000 in real terms.
01:09:13.056 - 01:09:14.230, Speaker A: Just the big transactions.
01:09:14.310 - 01:09:27.230, Speaker B: Just the big transaction. $65,000 and like $65,000. Not a lot of people send $65,000. Even people that are the average citizen at some point will send a $10,000 transaction.
01:09:27.310 - 01:09:29.170, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a car, man. You buy a car.
01:09:29.240 - 01:09:57.994, Speaker B: Right? Exactly. Yeah. I bought a car earlier and it was over $10,000. And so that is now a reported transaction. Right. Because I bought a car, it wouldn't have been in the 60s or 70s because I wouldn't have been buying a $65,000 car. And so this is a hidden, oppressive antisecracy force by the nature of inflation, because the threshold for what is getting reported is nominally the same, $10,000, but meaningfully is getting lower and lower and lower.
01:09:57.994 - 01:10:13.774, Speaker B: And again, we just printed like 29% of the outstanding us dollar supply in the last year. So if inflation keeps up, again, all of a sudden it's going to be like $500, not in real terms. $500 transfers, everything gets reported to the all seeing eye of siren, which is the nation state.
01:10:13.812 - 01:10:32.262, Speaker A: Well, let's see where this goes too. Right. The Fed possibility of a central bank digital currency. I'm showing some breaking news as of May 20 from CNBC. They've been talking about a central bank digital currency for a while. But David, what's different here is this is coming directly from Jerome Powell. He issued a statement about this.
01:10:32.262 - 01:11:05.374, Speaker A: So it seems like the US is getting serious about it. But even if you don't think the US is getting serious about it, if you're like, yeah, sure, whatever, China is definitely serious about. And like, I don't know, I feel like it comes down to this, David, there's only going to be two types of money in the world. Both are going to be digital. It's going to be central bank digital currency, it's going to be crypto. And one is going to be completely controlled, non sovereign by the nation state. The other is going to be free and open.
01:11:05.374 - 01:11:11.726, Speaker A: And those are the only two monies that we're going to have. It feels like it's all inevitable. Do you have a different take?
01:11:11.828 - 01:11:30.502, Speaker B: I think the whole possibility of issuing is like, oh yeah, like I'm going to continue to sit on my hands. We talked about this the last time we talked about CBDTs on the weekly roll up, which is like over a month ago. We haven't talked about it in a while. But again, at some point, this is a meme point taken that Jerome Powell saying this, but again, possibility of issuing whatever.
01:11:30.636 - 01:11:57.262, Speaker A: I just think China makes the US react in some way. But there is a different take on this, which is the Brian Brooks take. And he said this even Coinbase earlier this week. He's like, hey, the US approach is not going to be to develop a central bank digital currency. It's going to be let the private market do it. His take is let USDC and consortiums and crypto bank digital currencies thrive. And there shouldn't be a centralized Federal Reserve backed digital currency.
01:11:57.262 - 01:12:03.490, Speaker A: So we'll have to see how it plays out. It's almost like de facto kind of happening with some of these stable coins.
01:12:03.830 - 01:12:06.902, Speaker B: Preferable to crypto dollars. Crypto dollars? Crypto dollars.
01:12:06.956 - 01:12:30.730, Speaker A: Thank you. All right, this is interesting. Crypto fighting back banks. Coinbase hires a former Goldman Sachs executive as chief policy officer. We've seen exchanges and crypto banks hiring people from Washington. Now we're seeing them hire literal bankers to run their policy offices. What's happening here?
01:12:30.800 - 01:12:57.990, Speaker B: Old boss, same as the new boss, or new boss, same as the old. Right? Like, that's why the Hayden Adams on the front of Wall Street Journal is so deadly, because that's the new thing. That's what's new. Crypto banks buying regulated bankers and regulating bankers. Whoever regulates bankers, same thing. Same thing we've seen since the dawn of time. Like buying your way into just like, positive regulations that's beneficial for your industry.
01:12:57.990 - 01:13:01.510, Speaker B: Same like new banks? Same as old banks.
01:13:02.010 - 01:13:17.718, Speaker A: Cool. I don't trust it, man. I totally don't trust it. Yeah, that's definitely the take. I do think that crypto banks and exchanges are super useful now. They can serve as a bridge. Some will benefit decentralization, but others will actively take it away and try to centralize.
01:13:17.718 - 01:13:24.734, Speaker A: And we'll become a new boss if we don't fight back with this decentralized money system. Hayden Adams on the front.
01:13:24.852 - 01:13:27.022, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what we like to see. That's the new stuff.
01:13:27.076 - 01:13:28.842, Speaker A: Protocols. Not bankers.
01:13:28.906 - 01:13:34.960, Speaker B: Software developers, not regulators. Cypher punks, not nation states.
01:13:35.650 - 01:13:45.458, Speaker A: Let's drive some ultra, let's do some drive bys here. PayPal is going to let people withdraw crypto. That's a big step. Hopefully we get Robinhood on board next.
01:13:45.544 - 01:13:48.022, Speaker B: Robinhood. Let's get with it.
01:13:48.156 - 01:13:50.530, Speaker A: Yeah, they're not listening though. They don't listen to bank lists.
01:13:50.610 - 01:13:51.730, Speaker B: They definitely don't.
01:13:51.890 - 01:13:52.790, Speaker A: What's this one?
01:13:52.860 - 01:14:36.978, Speaker B: Apple looking for crypto experience in alternative payments job post Apple payments unit. Looking for a crypto savvy biz dev specialist to lead partnership efforts. I know Apple is really doubling down on their Apple Pay ecosystem. And the problem with payments is lack of settlement assurances. The reason why there's 1% to 3% on visas and Mastercards is because they don't have settlement assurances. One of the big benefits of Apple Pay and Google Pay is that you have some sort of assurances that the actual payer is who they say they are because they own the device. Positive settlement assurances as a feature of crypto assets is really, really awesome and beneficial towards all payment providers everywhere.
01:14:36.978 - 01:14:54.380, Speaker B: So Apple doesn't need to depend on visa. They can use stable crypto dollars on Ethereum, or more likely on Ethereum. L two, maybe that's completely not what's happening here, but that is the logical conclusion of where this could go.
01:14:54.750 - 01:15:14.282, Speaker A: They definitely will get here eventually. A VC firm, one confirmation whom we've had on the podcast, great folks. Raised another 125,000,000 for their third fund. They are now an 800 million dollar asset manager. Super impressive. Best of luck to one confirmation. That's going straight into DFI.
01:15:14.282 - 01:15:18.066, Speaker A: I know that. It's going straight into crypto. I know that. What's this next one?
01:15:18.088 - 01:15:37.494, Speaker B: David Goldman starts Coinbase coverage with buy rating. Sees more than 30% gain. Coin did not really do so well since it initially got listed. It's taken a beating. It's down in the 200 price range where it started. Opened up at like 350 or something. But Goldman Sachs says coin is a buy and I would agree.
01:15:37.692 - 01:15:46.570, Speaker A: There you go. All right, guys, we're going to be back with some hot takes and of course, the meme of the week. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:15:46.720 - 01:16:22.374, Speaker B: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on Ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while, and we'll say it again.
01:16:22.374 - 01:16:50.462, Speaker B: Dows have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap? Dow no matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a Uni grant@unigrants.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
01:16:50.462 - 01:17:20.626, Speaker B: That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you, Uniswap, for sponsoring bankless. Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make. My crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens.
01:17:20.626 - 01:17:58.706, Speaker B: And it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset. When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH. So whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of eth bonus back to me.
01:17:58.706 - 01:18:13.706, Speaker B: At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com.
01:18:13.808 - 01:18:49.634, Speaker A: Gobankless all right, guys, we are back on the recap with the takes of the week. Let's start with our friend Chris Berninsky. He says this the more vested interest in existing systems a person has, the more likely they are to be, in quotes, skeptical of crypto. Keep this in mind as you read expert opinions. David, is Chris talking about bag bias here? That's like the cloak wheel crypto name for it, bag bias. Right. Like you only care about your bags and you only talk about those and seems like he's saying that, hey, people in the traditional finance, they have bag bias towards traditional assets.
01:18:49.634 - 01:18:50.406, Speaker A: What's your take?
01:18:50.508 - 01:19:19.114, Speaker B: Right, yeah. So this is just cognitive dissonance. Classic. If you and your industry is about to be disrupted by crypto, you're going to hate it and you're going to shit talk it and you literally can't buy it. You can't buy the thing that's going to disrupt you because you can't legitimize it. Right? So you have to talk poorly about it. And I see the same sort of effect when people miss out on bitcoin, like going from one hundred dollars to sixty thousand dollars, and they say it's a Ponzi scheme, it's bad for the environment.
01:19:19.114 - 01:19:39.674, Speaker B: I'm never going to buy bitcoin because of these reasons. And the real answer is you're just upset that you missed the run and you're refusing to buy into it now. And so now you're justifying why you're not buying it. Right? Chris is talking about something more like institutionalized. Right? So bankers, all the industries that crypto is about to disrupt, you literally can't.
01:19:39.742 - 01:19:47.880, Speaker A: Elite baby boomers. Elite. Many elite boomers don't need all of their money in the stock market. Like Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, those.
01:19:49.610 - 01:19:58.550, Speaker B: You can't listen to the powers that be because literally, crypto is about disrupting the powers that be with new institutions. So you can't listen to the old institutions.
01:19:58.630 - 01:20:07.578, Speaker A: Let me flip that on you, though, okay? Because somebody from outside would say, yeah, shut up, david, because you're talking your bags, too. Isn't that what you do every week on bankless?
01:20:07.674 - 01:20:08.320, Speaker B: Absolutely.
01:20:09.170 - 01:20:15.070, Speaker A: It's a giant ponzi. It's a giant ponzi game. You just want people to buy. They have a point.
01:20:15.220 - 01:20:54.830, Speaker B: Totally, totally bag bias through and through. You guys listen to bankless, you're listening to literally no one cannot talk their bags. But to some degree, the reason why I'm invested in ether is for reasons, and I think they are good reasons. And so to some degree, there's at least one person, or like, one realm of thought, that is the correct thought, and there are bags to go with that thesis. There is a correct thesis out there, and there are assets that fall in line with that thesis. And that's why bankless is a thesis. First media company protocol, seeing thesis, legitimacy, money, Legos.
01:20:56.050 - 01:21:32.390, Speaker A: We believe these things. Why would we not hold eth right? We would be biased in the worst direction if every week we were talking about bitcoin and ethereum and Defi and we didn't have any skin in the game in these. Like, that's bag bias working against you. I think what you want to have is long term bag bias here, not short term games, not pump and dump. Long term bag bias. That's what's called for here. The other thing I'll say, david, is one thing I say is, first, buy some bitcoin and eth, spend the next six months figuring out why they're useful.
01:21:32.390 - 01:21:49.534, Speaker A: And some people have said, well, why buy first? Shouldn't you figure out why they're useful first? Actually, no. Buy a little bit first, because once you actually purchase some, you become more interested in learning. Right? So I'm not saying go all in right away in these assets, but you have to have some skin in the game.
01:21:49.572 - 01:21:51.230, Speaker B: You have to have the incentive to learn.
01:21:51.380 - 01:21:58.162, Speaker A: You have to have the incentive to learn. And crypto economics, price, number go up, number go down provides great incentive to do that.
01:21:58.216 - 01:21:58.482, Speaker B: Right.
01:21:58.536 - 01:22:12.262, Speaker A: So you can also have bag bias work in your favor. If you want to learn about something and spend the time, actually make it worth your while, maybe go buy a little first and figure out why it's going up, why it's going down. Like, figure that out.
01:22:12.316 - 01:22:40.922, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. The best way to get over your cognitive dissonance about crypto assets is just to capitulate and buy some. I had a friend who was giving me resistance as to getting into ether, like, when Ether was pumping from $2000 to $4,000. And so I sent him, like, 0.1 Eth. And I'm like, okay, here's a small little gift. You can have this ETH, and loaded him up with metamask, put EtH in his wallet, and all of a sudden, his resistance to buying more ETH just went out the window.
01:22:40.922 - 01:22:50.690, Speaker B: And so then he started dumping money into ether. I'm like, okay, fine. That's a sacrifice. The 0.1 e sacrifice to the gods. Now, we have converted an ETH person.
01:22:50.760 - 01:23:00.446, Speaker A: If just put money in, it's not a bad plan, right? So even use this for Defi tokens. Right? Okay. DFI protocol. You like, go use it. See if it works. Oh, cool. It's useful.
01:23:00.446 - 01:23:14.858, Speaker A: It works. Now maybe I'll buy a little bit, and then I'll learn about it. But, like, just a little bit. You don't go all in on something, but then that gives you an incentive to learn more about the protocol. I think that can work in your favor. But, yeah, Chris is right on there. Don't believe the media that you hear.
01:23:14.858 - 01:23:15.146, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:23:15.168 - 01:23:21.102, Speaker B: So tldrs all the institutional experts that I know don't listen to bankless. Just by a little bit.
01:23:21.156 - 01:23:37.300, Speaker A: Just by a little bit. There you go. Here's volatility. Volatility, bad. Volatility good. Here's MipO. Crypto might be volatile, but at least it doesn't need 120,000,000,000 injected into it every month just to function.
01:23:37.300 - 01:23:46.514, Speaker A: Of course, the treasury, the fed, puts 120,000,000,000 these days into the US dollar market, into the fiat, the banking system.
01:23:46.632 - 01:23:55.160, Speaker B: Crypto doesn't need that liquidity in that anyway. And the reason why crypto functions is because no one can do that. And that's why it works.
01:23:55.850 - 01:23:57.234, Speaker A: That's also why it's volatile.
01:23:57.282 - 01:23:58.594, Speaker B: It's also why it's firestall. Yeah.
01:23:58.652 - 01:23:59.030, Speaker A: Feature.
01:23:59.110 - 01:24:01.370, Speaker B: Feature is not a bug, except the volatility.
01:24:04.110 - 01:24:37.694, Speaker A: Here's an interesting take. Okay, this is from me, but I saw this from a proposal somebody in the Wi Fi community basically put forward, banteg, put a governance proposal forward in wire and Wi Fi, saying that, hey, guys, we should use our Wi Fi treasury to buy some eth, because we want to own the land in which we operate. And I don't know if you read this proposal, David, but it's really. It goes through. If you're a restaurant, right. You don't just want to own the restaurant, necessarily. You also want to own the land, like around your restaurant.
01:24:37.742 - 01:24:38.098, Speaker B: Right.
01:24:38.184 - 01:24:40.702, Speaker A: That's like a development. Own the real estate, own the property.
01:24:40.776 - 01:24:48.310, Speaker B: Traffic surface area. Like optimum real estate for where your restaurant is. It's one thing to have good food, but you want to be where all the people are.
01:24:48.460 - 01:25:18.254, Speaker A: Exactly. And so he's like, hey, since we're here, we should actually invest in real estate, too. And what is that real estate for YFi? Well, they're on Ethereum, so the real estate is ETH. So he made the case for the Wi Fi community to go buy some eth, put that in their treasury. And my take was, on top of this is, my God, Defi protocols are going to be the Michael sailors of ETh. David, we're going to buy all of this real estate. Successful defi protocol on Ethereum.
01:25:18.254 - 01:25:39.466, Speaker A: Then on Ethereum's roll up infrastructure, they want to own some ETH in their treasury. So this is almost like the reverse ICO. Remember the icos? They would raise an ETH, and then many of them would sell it. These aren't icos. These are successful defi protocols. Now they're going back to ETH, and they're like, oh, we want a piece of this Ethereum economy. We want this real estate, too.
01:25:39.466 - 01:25:43.100, Speaker A: And we're going to pack our treasury with eth. Kind of cool.
01:25:43.470 - 01:26:20.470, Speaker B: There are so many takes to talk about. First off, here's some recent crypto culture that many people might not be familiar with. The whole few understand meme came from. I think it came from Pierre Richard, when Pierre Richard, who's a big bitcoiner, was like, owning BTC is owning a piece of Internet real estate. Few understand. And people were making fun of him because how ridiculous of a comparison is owning BTC to owning Internet real estate? Because in bitcoin, maxi land, literally, bitcoin is the Internet, right? Is the currency of the Internet. So if you own a bitcoin, you own a piece of the Internet.
01:26:20.470 - 01:26:47.790, Speaker B: What Ethereum is, is literally the decentralized Internet. BTC is an asset on a proof of work network. Ethereum is the Internet tech stack in a decentralized fashion and is literally a piece of the Internet. And so many things that bitcoiners say about bitcoin are actually true about Ethereum. It's crazy. But ether as an asset is a piece of Internet, of equity in the Ethereum network, which is literally the reconstruction of a decentralized Internet, literally real estate.
01:26:48.610 - 01:27:23.738, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like that's true, like what bitcoiners say about Ethereum, but it's also true of bitcoin, too. It's just like, more true of ethereum. I think somebody asked you, David, like, I saw this tweet from you, asked about, hey, David, because we're going to have somebody. Preston, Preston Push. Yeah, Preston push from the bitcoin community. We're going to talk about bitcoin and Ethereum and differences and similarities between the networks. And somebody asked you, like, hey, you've had your bitcoiner hat on to you before.
01:27:23.738 - 01:27:37.790, Speaker A: You have a podcast where you regularly talk to a bitcoiner. You're sort of the ethereum, and he's kind of the bitcoiner. It's like, david, what are your takeaways from that? And you just said this. It was like one line, like, bitcoin is dope, eth is doper.
01:27:39.490 - 01:27:44.562, Speaker B: That's it. Bitcoin's great. Ethereum's just really cool. And it's a little bit cooler. That's fine.
01:27:44.696 - 01:27:45.970, Speaker A: It's kind of how I feel, too.
01:27:46.040 - 01:27:56.446, Speaker B: Okay, takes on this take are not done because I want to show some piece of David's previous writing. And, Ryan, do you have that pulled.
01:27:56.478 - 01:27:59.026, Speaker A: Up next is that I can. Which one is it?
01:27:59.048 - 01:28:01.698, Speaker B: Oh, money game landscape.
01:28:01.714 - 01:28:03.046, Speaker A: Yeah. Set this up for us. Yeah.
01:28:03.068 - 01:28:22.966, Speaker B: Okay, so I wrote this piece in 2019, this is not too long after DFI pulse came out. And so I wrote this piece called the money game landscape and talking about how DeFi apps are all in heavy competition to put Eth on the balance. Have it. Is there a screenshot of Defi pulse?
01:28:22.998 - 01:28:23.146, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:28:23.168 - 01:28:45.826, Speaker B: Okay, so here's OG Defi pulse. And I use this as a metaphor of, like, this is literally the leaderboard of Ethereum is like, at this point in time, Maker had 1.9 million ETH in it. So maker at the lead of 1.9 million points. And what is money, other than a point system, of who is owed what value? Right. Money is a point system.
01:28:45.826 - 01:29:13.230, Speaker B: And all the DFI apps on Ethereum are competing to put ether on the balance sheet because ether is the most credibly neutral points in the Ethereum world. And so we now see yearn, which wasn't even an application when I wrote this piece, saying, like, hey, we want some of that Ethereum real estate. Like, we're going to put some eth on the balance sheet. And I'm like, yes, this is the money game landscape. Every single application is in a competition to get high scores. And that high score is scored in ether.
01:29:13.970 - 01:29:27.620, Speaker A: It's scored in both total locked value of ether, but then also, like, purchasing it on their balance sheet. So, yeah, both these places. That article is held up, by the way, 2019. David, you're thinking ahead, man. It's coming true.
01:29:28.150 - 01:29:34.418, Speaker B: The other way that held up is yield farming. Big game to collect TVL yes.
01:29:34.504 - 01:29:38.222, Speaker A: Now we're seeing that game on layer two. I think pretty soon, layer two summer.
01:29:38.286 - 01:29:39.718, Speaker B: Layer two summer happening.
01:29:39.884 - 01:29:50.194, Speaker A: All right, this is another take. Tyler Reynolds eth is circled on the left, non cash flow alts circled on the right. For people who are listening on the podcast, you might need to describe this. What are we looking at, David?
01:29:50.242 - 01:29:56.154, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a pretty classic chart in the crypto space. It's the classic. Here's what a classic bubble looks like.
01:29:56.192 - 01:29:56.394, Speaker A: Right?
01:29:56.432 - 01:30:21.438, Speaker B: And so we have this stealth phase where things are. Only true believers are there, but then things start to bubble up, and then there's this awareness phase, and there's a mania and a blow off top phase, and then there's the absolute crash. This is the 2017 bubble. This is the 2013 bubble. This is the tech.com bubble. And so what was circled on the left is ether in its first sell off bear trap phase.
01:30:21.438 - 01:31:07.138, Speaker B: But then on the right is the non cash flow assets. I will also say these are like the doggy tokens, right? Doggy tokens are in their bull trap phase, as in there's like this blow off top, small crash, a little bit of a recovery, but those things are dying. Those things are not coming back. Non cash flow. You don't think they're coming back meme coins? I mean, I'm not 100% convicted in this, but I do believe that there's a massive discrepancy between tokens with real underlying lying value and real cash flows versus doggy tokens. Doggy tokens could have just had their day, and then they're never coming back. Ether is in a different phase of the cycle, and the reason why we say this is because there's a significantly different cohort of people that are putting money into crypto right now.
01:31:07.138 - 01:31:30.678, Speaker B: Institutions and big money are not putting money into doggy tokens. They're putting money into BTC and ETH and DeFi assets. All the meme coins, like Cardano's, like dentacoins, like whatevers, those things are not getting allocations right now or ever. And so there's a completely massive fissure between the two cohorts of people that are buying these two classes of assets.
01:31:30.854 - 01:32:22.330, Speaker A: This reminds me kind of of the crypto super cycle thesis that the three arrow skies were talking about, which is like, you might have bulls and bear markets for specific classes of assets, right? But crypto their thesis anyway. Or this idea is crypto is never going to globally go into a massive bear zone where you've got, like, 80% to 90% off all time highs. I don't know if I believe that, but it's kind of the idea. Similar idea of what you're saying is like, yeah, some assets might be in crypto assets, where general market calls all of this crypto might never come back after this most recent crash, while others, well, to other assets, it might be just a temporary dip and then a recovery. So on different timelines is sort of the idea here.
01:32:22.400 - 01:32:22.822, Speaker B: Totally.
01:32:22.886 - 01:32:28.470, Speaker A: All right, let's go to the next one. Rethinking work. Is this a job description? What is this job description?
01:32:28.550 - 01:33:03.686, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is originally pioneered by Amin Soleimani, who made a job posting forever ago for spank chain for a meme lord. And Gitcoin is following in the suit. Meme artist, shipposter, plus community manager, remote full time job, $80 to $120,000. And the Nat is retweeting this image, and it goes, this is a six figure meme making job at a legit company. No matter how silly your kids interest seems, don't ever tell them that they should give them up for a real job. Rethink what work is. Work is different now.
01:33:03.686 - 01:33:29.646, Speaker B: Like, memory and memes, like cmos chief marketing officers are now chief memory officers. Right? Get your company with the times. Get yourself a meme lord on your company's marketing team and a community manager. That's rethink. The future of work is being done at home. It's being done from the comfort of your own computer and is being done with memes and community management and just engagement with the people that pay attention to your company.
01:33:29.828 - 01:33:45.646, Speaker A: This is just it. Memes are powerful, right? It's like, I remember when the job description of, like, old enough to remember the social media manager came in vogue and people were like, what, paying to do Facebook and paying to tweet, like, what is this? This is not a real job. Well, now meming is a real job, apparently.
01:33:45.758 - 01:33:52.006, Speaker B: Fun fact, episode number five of the Bankless podcast is all about memes, one of the most underappreciated bankless podcasts there is.
01:33:52.028 - 01:34:02.102, Speaker A: I think that is a fun fact. A lot of fun. All right, this is Udi, our friend. What's he doing? He's tweeting about etherlite. Is this New York Times billboard?
01:34:02.246 - 01:34:15.870, Speaker B: New York Times Square. Yeah, billboard. A billboard for etherlight.org. Don't go there. Because the reason why we're talking about this is because this is a PSA of. This is a warning. It's very scammy looking.
01:34:15.870 - 01:34:27.662, Speaker B: It's advertising, basically. What is an ICO? This is like 2017 Ico nostalgia. If you want to go and look at what an old 2017 ICO kind of looks like, that's what this is.
01:34:27.796 - 01:34:32.974, Speaker A: This is Udi calling them out, by the way, not advertising. I just want to make clear. He's calling them out like, this is sketchy.
01:34:33.022 - 01:35:16.234, Speaker B: This is sketchy as fuck. And they're advertising in Times Square, right? And so they're latching on to the tailwinds of Ethereum, and they're using a lot of Ethereum words, right? So Etherlite's network native token, eTl, is used to run the network, starting with the adopted proof of stake consensus mechanism, whereby ETL is necessary for one to become a public validator node. In addition, ETL is used for network governance and payment of fees, very much using similar terminology as Ethereum proof of stake. It's got ether lite as the name. It's trying to get you to deposit your ether in order to get ETL. I'm willing to bet that it's actually an ERC 20 token on Ethereum. Don't fall for scams like this.
01:35:16.234 - 01:35:36.550, Speaker B: Scams like this are coming. They target new people who don't know what they're listening to. They think that they can get 1000 x gains. This is what an ICo looked like in 2017. That was scammy and terrible. So, PSA, there are monsters out there, and they're trying to gobble up your ether. Be wary of people that are trying to convince you to part with your ether and your other monies.
01:35:37.690 - 01:35:44.986, Speaker A: Well said, david. Be careful out there. Guys, it's time for what we're excited about. David, let's start with you. What are you excited about, man?
01:35:45.088 - 01:35:46.700, Speaker B: What am I excited about?
01:35:47.070 - 01:35:48.054, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Swap.
01:35:48.102 - 01:36:25.846, Speaker B: Uniswap v three. Uniswap v three is sick as fuck. Okay, so we have amin Soleimani, who tweeted this week, we're not going to pull up the tweet, but we're going to talk about something else in a second where Amin Soleimani says, uniswap v three is lit. AF earned $5,000 on a $350,000 concentrated position, a $250 range between ETH and USCC in 16 hours. So he made $5,000 off of $150,000 in 16 hours. Earned about the same on ten x, the capital with ETh you would see on a wide 4k position over the same period. This is definitely the future.
01:36:25.846 - 01:36:44.286, Speaker B: Robert Leshner is just talking also about how uniswap v three is cool af. I love uniswap v three, he says. And here's what is really cool about Uniswap v three. Ryan, go to that liquidity page right next to it. This is what so many people is it not letting you do that? There you go.
01:36:44.308 - 01:36:44.990, Speaker A: There you go.
01:36:45.140 - 01:36:52.958, Speaker B: This is why so many people are excited about Uniswap v three. Yeah, let's zoom in on that. This is the new order book.
01:36:53.044 - 01:36:58.978, Speaker A: This is how new orderback the CN tower, right? Just one pinnacle up.
01:36:59.064 - 01:37:29.158, Speaker B: Instead of order books looking like a v, this looks like an upside down v. And you can see where people are placing their liquidity at different price ranges. And so, Ryan, if you press that plus sign, we can even zoom in more and more and more. But this is the game that people are playing. So this is the new liquidity profile for ETh USDC in Uniswap v. Three, because each one of these, each people have different ranges that they add liquidity to. This kind of chart where there is specific liquidity across different ranges.
01:37:29.158 - 01:37:39.390, Speaker B: Get used to that chart. That's the new future. This is a new paradigm. Inverse order books based on concentrated liquidity positions inside of amms. That is the future of liquidity.
01:37:39.970 - 01:37:48.802, Speaker A: It worked. V three just surpassed v two. Uniswap v three surpassed v two this week. In terms of trading volume, pretty impressive, man.
01:37:48.856 - 01:38:00.166, Speaker B: And I keep on using Uniswap. I mean, I use Uniswap almost every single day, and more often than not, I'm continuing seeing more and more times where the better price is on uniswap v three. People are figuring it out, and they're figuring it out quick.
01:38:00.348 - 01:38:01.542, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
01:38:01.676 - 01:38:02.950, Speaker B: Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:38:03.020 - 01:38:05.154, Speaker A: You know what I'm going to say. Layer two, Summer.
01:38:05.202 - 01:38:05.906, Speaker B: Layer two, summer.
01:38:05.938 - 01:38:27.674, Speaker A: Excited about. I'm excited about summertime. We said this a little bit in the last podcast, but I think it's absolutely true. Binance Chan Polygon showed the appetite and is showing the appetite for EVM. Scalability, enterprise virtual machine scalability, defi scalability. Now we've got arbitrum coming. Optimism coming in July.
01:38:27.674 - 01:38:55.906, Speaker A: This is summertime. All of these side chains, roll up chains, they're going to have liquidity incentive programs. The major DeFi protocols will have liquidity incentive programs. On top of that, it feels very much to me like it could be a setup of the previous Defi summer where I remember that in May we talked with Dan Elliser about this new thing. What was it? Compound governance token.
01:38:56.018 - 01:38:58.498, Speaker B: Oh, interesting. Liquidity, mining, yield, farming.
01:38:58.674 - 01:39:19.582, Speaker A: Yeah. And then explosion. Right. There is a setup for layer two to absolutely explode. And I think it's because this time it's not like a hypothetical, how should we scale Ethereum type of solution. Do you remember plasma in 2017? It's always like, plasma is coming. State channels are coming.
01:39:19.582 - 01:39:42.338, Speaker A: This is how we'll scale Ethereum. No, this time it's different. These roll ups are launching with partners with D five protocols. Right. Might take some time to get the kink cell, but I think some of these launches will happen this summer. And it's setting up for a pretty exciting summer, like a tidal wave, tsunami type of summer. Layer two protocols, layer two solution.
01:39:42.434 - 01:40:14.350, Speaker B: And importantly, optimism. And arbitram, they have tokens. They are going to have tokens that control over this system, and everybody's going to have tokens. Everyone's going to have tokens. And this is real estate, right? This is really important, critical real estate that everyone's going to want a piece of. And it's important both optimism and arbitrum are very, very true to the nature of an ethos of ethereum and decentralization and crypto at large. And so they need to figure out a way to get these tokens that are in extremely high demand out and proliferated and have high entropy and get the ownership of the asset also decentralized.
01:40:14.350 - 01:40:17.662, Speaker B: You know that the way they do that, Ryan. Yield farming.
01:40:17.726 - 01:40:20.546, Speaker A: Distribute yield farming. Exactly. They distribute it.
01:40:20.568 - 01:40:23.778, Speaker B: So, bankless nation, get your fucking farms ready.
01:40:23.864 - 01:40:27.906, Speaker A: Because here's the thing. Yeah. Your farms will have farms this summer.
01:40:28.098 - 01:40:29.762, Speaker B: Farms on farms, on farms.
01:40:29.906 - 01:41:14.654, Speaker A: But here's the thing that also will happen, okay, guys, before you get too overhyped, is if layer two summer happens, d five summer happens, it's going to shoot way higher than it should. Like, valuations and token prices will probably overextend, like things always do in crypto. And then maybe months later, I'm not sure, there will be a crash, there will be a pullback as well. Right? Again, you got to approach these things from a long term perspective as well. But I think it makes sense to get started, try these protocols out. This is the next frontier, right? So, like, we have bitcoin. First frontier, we have Ethereum.
01:41:14.654 - 01:41:20.630, Speaker A: Second frontier, we have Defi. Third frontier. Next frontier. Fourth frontier is layer two.
01:41:20.700 - 01:41:22.422, Speaker B: Go explore on layer two.
01:41:22.476 - 01:41:27.190, Speaker A: Yeah, Defi on layer two. Go explore, guys. That's the message. I'm excited about that.
01:41:27.260 - 01:41:39.994, Speaker B: Get your farms ready. And I think the alpha that I think is true is that it's going to be much better to farm these tokens than it is going to be to purchase these tokens. Go farm them. Don't buy them, farm them.
01:41:40.032 - 01:41:41.210, Speaker A: Except for taxes.
01:41:41.630 - 01:41:42.314, Speaker B: Is that true?
01:41:42.352 - 01:41:42.746, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:41:42.848 - 01:41:45.246, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Tax on income, right?
01:41:45.348 - 01:41:48.666, Speaker A: Anyway, yeah, not fun anyway. All right, memes. Memes.
01:41:48.698 - 01:41:49.134, Speaker B: Meme of the week.
01:41:49.172 - 01:41:50.942, Speaker A: David, which meme are we looking at?
01:41:50.996 - 01:42:13.654, Speaker B: We are looking at a four panel meme. We have an angry pigeon being offered a cracker, and that pigeon is yelling at that cracker. And that pigeon is BTC Maxis. Bitcoin maxis. And that cracker is Defi, and the pigeon is yelling, get that thing out of my face. And then, of course, because it's a pigeon, it eats the cracker. And so it noms on the cracker a little bit, and then it has this uh oh moment, this awakening moment.
01:42:13.654 - 01:42:42.670, Speaker B: These eyes go wide moment. All of a sudden, it falls in love with the cracker. And you might think that this is a political meme, as in, we are telling bitcoin maxis that they need to love Defi. It's kind of true. But they can still be bitcoin maxis. You can still be a bitcoin maxi and use Defi. And in that same vein that we were talking about cognitive dissonance, where bitcoin maxis want to shit on Defi because they feel it as a threat to bitcoin.
01:42:42.670 - 01:43:01.714, Speaker B: You don't have to feel that you can use Defi. I know not. The only asset that you own is bitcoin. You also have cash in the bank. See what it's like to go lend out that cash and return an interest rate while also yield farming matic tokens on polygon or something. Right? You can use Defi and still be a bitcoin maxi. It's not blasphemous.
01:43:01.714 - 01:43:02.600, Speaker B: It's okay.
01:43:03.370 - 01:43:23.946, Speaker A: Also, look, guys, bitcoin is the original. Like, I believe that. I see that all the time. Peer to peer, no intermediary transmission of value that is defi. Right? But don't just stop there. Go try out the full spectrum of defi. And I think what this meme is saying is, like, you might fall in love with.
01:43:23.946 - 01:43:25.626, Speaker A: It might fall in love with Defi.
01:43:25.738 - 01:43:36.302, Speaker B: Plus you can use some versions of. I know it's compromised, WBTC, like RenBTC, whatever. You don't have to use all of your bitcoin bags, but you can still have bitcoin denominated yield farming on Defi. Go try it out.
01:43:36.436 - 01:43:52.166, Speaker A: Bitcoin could still be your store of value. All right, guys, we are going to lead out with a moment of Zen clip, so stick around for that, especially if you're on YouTube. But first, disclaimers, none of this was financial advice. ETH is risky. Bitcoin is risky. Defi is risky. You could lose what you put in.
01:43:52.166 - 01:43:59.898, Speaker A: But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
01:43:59.984 - 01:44:06.714, Speaker B: And now, the moment of Zen. Guys, these scam coins are getting so out of hand.
01:44:06.832 - 01:44:19.982, Speaker A: Someone just shield me this. Today, 27 trillion in circulation. Unlimited supply cap. There's only one node, so it's completely centralized. 25% of the supply has been minted in the past six months.
01:44:20.116 - 01:44:21.854, Speaker B: And last but not least, the top.
01:44:21.892 - 01:44:24.618, Speaker A: 1% of holders own 30% of the supply.
01:44:24.714 - 01:44:25.558, Speaker B: No, I'm just kidding.
01:44:25.594 - 01:44:27.570, Speaker A: That's not a coin. That's the US dollar.
