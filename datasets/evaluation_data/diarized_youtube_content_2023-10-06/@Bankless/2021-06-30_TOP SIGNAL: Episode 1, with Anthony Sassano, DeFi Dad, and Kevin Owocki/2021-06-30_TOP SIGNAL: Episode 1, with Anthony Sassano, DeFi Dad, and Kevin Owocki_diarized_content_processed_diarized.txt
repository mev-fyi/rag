00:00:09.190 - 00:00:51.682, Speaker A: All right, ladies and gentlemen of crypto, Twitter, the bankless nation, and the wider crypto industry, welcome to top signal, the crypto show that brings you the same guests and personalities that you all know from the podcasts and videos that you listen to. But instead of information, data, and analysis, top signal is entertainment, comedy, and live shipposting. Keeping up with crypto is work, and top signal is not that. The only rule that we have at top signal is that there is no fact checking. Everything you hear on this show by the guests or the hosts is in a superposition of a ship, post psyops, a factual statement, and perhaps the world's best alpha. No one knows because we don't check. I'm David Hoffman.
00:00:51.682 - 00:01:03.500, Speaker A: I'm here with my budy, Michael Wong, and we're here to help serve you crypto comfort food. And we got a great show lined up for you guys today, along with some great guests. But before we get to the guests, Michael Wong. How you doing today, man?
00:01:04.190 - 00:01:19.994, Speaker B: What's up, everybody? What's up, bankless nation? And welcome to top signal. That was super energetic, dude. You got a lot of energy. Tonight. I want to tell everybody about what top signal is going to be about. It's a variety show from the get go. I want you to understand the format.
00:01:19.994 - 00:01:39.398, Speaker B: We're doing different stuff every day. Today, we have a batch of guests I think are going to be perfect for everybody. Everybody loves these dudes. I just got to meet them for the first time. Nobody's ever met in real life, I don't think. But, yeah, we're going to run into it. If you think about Jimmy Fallon, if you think about the.
00:01:39.398 - 00:01:42.578, Speaker B: Forgot the dude's name, lots of different sketches.
00:01:42.674 - 00:01:45.314, Speaker A: Let's get into there's.
00:01:45.362 - 00:01:45.686, Speaker B: We got.
00:01:45.708 - 00:02:04.350, Speaker A: We got some games that we're going to play, and so this is going to be some orchestration. There's some things going on in the background, some plans, some gimmicks, some skits that we've got. And first, I think there's a good question as to what we should start with is what the hell is top signal? Mike, what the hell is top signal?
00:02:06.210 - 00:02:34.982, Speaker B: I think it's an intersection of bullshit. It's an intersection of trying to give crypto a place to kind of relax and kind of unload. I know there's different places. People enjoy doing that online, but this is going to be the living room for some of your favorite crypto personalities. And kind of like how on Jimmy found if a movie star comes on there, he's not talking about the movie till the end. They're doing a bunch of different things. We're going to be doing that stuff with.
00:02:34.982 - 00:03:06.066, Speaker B: Listen, expect us to do stuff like, we're trying to bring on a police sketch artist, right? A veteran police sketch artist, 25 years in the force, and we're trying to draw, like, some of our favorite anon crypto Twitter account identities based on their tweets. Trying to run stuff like that. Give crypto a place to do things that they haven't done before. You know what I mean? There's no rules, no fact checking. I'm not looking anything up, dude. Things we're saying are hot takes. Invest on it if you want to, but you know what mean, like, don't do just.
00:03:06.066 - 00:03:07.278, Speaker B: We're just shooting the shit.
00:03:07.374 - 00:03:43.120, Speaker A: Something that is new out of the top signal show is that this is actually a Zoom webinar that we are in. We got the bankless dow in the audience, in the fans, and when it comes time to call on the audience, it's the bankless dao that we will be calling upon. So if you are in the YouTube troll box, and if you want to be a participant in the audience, make sure you go to the bankless dow discord. Click on the zoom webinar link, because we got a bunch of people in the webinar attendees, and those are the people that if we ever choose to engage with the audience, those are who we are calling upon. Michael Wong, any last things before we get to the show?
00:03:44.050 - 00:03:46.990, Speaker B: Why do you think you can host a crypto comedy show, Dave?
00:03:47.650 - 00:04:26.700, Speaker A: I have no clue, dude. I have this YouTube account that a lot of people subscribe to, and I know how to stream stuff, and I really think that there is a world where a world of content that has not really been breached yet. And actually, the original inspiration for Topsoil came out of my Friday livestreams with Anthony Suzano, who is one of the guests. You're going to bring him on in a second, but just the different vibes that you get when you have this unscripted live stream is pretty fun, and I kind of want to bring those vibes with a little bit more intent with some crypto comedy. What about you, Mike? What makes you think you can host a crypto comedy show?
00:04:27.230 - 00:04:53.238, Speaker B: Listen, nobody knows who I am that you're watching this. You're like, who's this dude? What's he going to talk about? That's the point, right? You don't need to know. That's top signal for you, right? I've been in this game as long as David has been his path, has taken his own path, and thankfully, he's taken me along. I'm the person that works at culture. I am the culture chief at bankless. Get that for a title on my LinkedIn. Thank you.
00:04:53.238 - 00:05:09.900, Speaker B: And I got this cool shirt as a payment. So we thought one day while we were in a pool in San Diego, while crypto was literally, let's, let's, let's make a show where we can shoot the shit and talk about some crazy things and be a top signal if we want to.
00:05:10.670 - 00:05:28.586, Speaker A: That is the through line, isn't it? All right, guys, enough talking about top signal on top signal. We're going to go ahead and get right into the show. We got a great show lined up for you guys. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. Rug pull. Here we go. Alchemyx is one of the coolest new defi apps on the scene.
00:05:28.586 - 00:06:07.942, Speaker A: It introduces self paying loans, allowing you to spend and save at the same time. Deposit the dai stablecoin into the Alchemyx vault in order to get an advance on the interest it generates. Borrow up to 50% of the total amount of your deposited die in the form of Al USD stablecoin. Here's the craziest part. The loan pays itself back and you cannot be liquidated. Unlock your assets potential in the ultimate DFI savings account and brand new to Alchemyx is the eth vault where you can deposit eth into the application. Borrow al ETH against your deposits while having your advance gradually paid back over time.
00:06:07.942 - 00:07:03.690, Speaker A: V two is rapidly approaching, which will allow for even more collateral types, plus a variety of yield strategies to choose from. Harness the power of Alchemyx at Alchemyx f I that's A-L-C-H-E-M-I-X-F-I follow alchemyx on Twitter at alchemyxfi and join the discord to keep up to date with Alchemyx V two and to get involved in governance. When you shop for plane tickets, you probably use kayak, Expedia or Google to compare ticket prices. So why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto? When you make your trades, you want to make sure that you are getting the best possible price on your trade and that you aren't paying high gas costs that you could have otherwise avoided. That's why you should be using matcha. Matcha routes your orders across all the various defi exchanges on Ethereum, polygon, Binance, smart chain and gives you the best possible prices without taking any commission. Matcha has smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources.
00:07:03.690 - 00:07:44.410, Speaker A: If matcha sees that, it gets you better pricing. Trading on matcha is super easy because it pools the liquidity for me into a single, easy to use platform, and that has even saved me multiple times from accidentally picking the wrong decks to trade on and accidentally getting a bad price. Matcha also allows for you to make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defi trades, and they will go through automatically while you're away. New to matcha is an integrated fiat on ramp. You can purchase crypto directly with your credit or debit card and have that fiat be instantly traded for any token that has liquidity. When you're making a trade, head over to Matcha XYZ slash bankless, and connect your wallet to start getting the best prices and most liquidity when you trade your crypto assets.
00:07:56.350 - 00:08:13.522, Speaker B: Well, I wasn't lying, guys. I wasn't lying. I brought the hitters today. I brought the hitters today. For our first episode of Top Signal, I'd like to introduce you to everybody. I'd like to introduce everybody to them. First up on this graphic made by Logan Craig is Mr.
00:08:13.522 - 00:08:25.770, Speaker B: Kevin Owaki. He is here pictured, or he was in quadratic lands. He is the inventor and founder of Gitcoin. Everybody knows this gentleman right here. Hello, Kevin. Awake.
00:08:25.950 - 00:08:26.246, Speaker C: Hey.
00:08:26.268 - 00:08:26.502, Speaker B: Hey.
00:08:26.556 - 00:08:27.654, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:08:27.772 - 00:08:47.466, Speaker B: That's his voice right there. And Defi dad. This is Defi dad. Everybody pictured just by himself. No kid here has seen his profile picture. We all of our fathers, though, all of our fathers, in some sort of way, he's taught everybody something. If you know a little trick on metamask, he probably came from this.
00:08:47.466 - 00:08:48.986, Speaker B: Fellas, thank you for coming, Defi dad.
00:08:49.018 - 00:08:49.854, Speaker D: We appreciate that.
00:08:49.972 - 00:09:04.066, Speaker E: Yeah, thanks for having me, guys. Before we started, I mentioned I'm on a vacation, but it looks like I've been kicked out of the house, and I live in my parents basement. So this is the state of the market we're in right now.
00:09:04.088 - 00:09:06.020, Speaker A: We're not quite bear market.
00:09:07.590 - 00:09:11.762, Speaker E: It could be a vacation home if crypto goes up, but if crypto goes.
00:09:11.816 - 00:09:15.086, Speaker A: Down, it could be home ticket.
00:09:15.118 - 00:09:17.538, Speaker C: Spider, though, feels like psyops to me.
00:09:17.624 - 00:09:38.190, Speaker B: Okay, he's buying right now, guys. Okay. Last but not least, you might not recognize him without his beard. We couldn't find a good jpeg to put on the graphic without the beard, but here he is, Anthony Cisano in the pixel flesh. Thanks for coming, sir. All the way digitally from across the ocean.
00:09:38.850 - 00:09:40.880, Speaker D: Yeah, I just woke up 20 minutes ago.
00:09:41.970 - 00:09:46.270, Speaker B: We saw you online on discord moments ago. We appreciate.
00:09:46.770 - 00:09:51.086, Speaker D: Woke up just for this. So I hope you guys feel special about that.
00:09:51.188 - 00:10:07.202, Speaker B: There you go. Well, you know what? Let's jump right into a game. First and foremost, each of you are going to get. Just to get a little bit of color, right. We're going to introduce you to some of these. Me and David are going to pitch each of you in Ico. Two of them from 2017.
00:10:07.202 - 00:10:25.418, Speaker B: One of them is real, one of them is not. So I forgot that I was supposed to do this with each guest as I was introducing them. So here we're doing it in reverse order. But let's start with Kevin Owalki. David, why don't you show or pitch Kevin Owalki these two icos and let's see if you can determine which one is real.
00:10:25.504 - 00:10:40.506, Speaker A: And the background on this is that Mike and I actually, Mike hired me at my first crypto job for an ICO advisory agency. And so we got exposure to some really quality, terrible icos made over a hundred ICO websites.
00:10:40.538 - 00:10:47.234, Speaker B: And how many announcement posts on bitcoin talk? How much I paid to get special accounts on bitcoin talk?
00:10:47.352 - 00:10:50.290, Speaker C: This is why you're hosting a podcast called the top signal.
00:10:52.470 - 00:10:56.130, Speaker B: If I had any experience in it, it's just top signals. Go ahead, Dave.
00:10:56.210 - 00:11:34.990, Speaker A: All right, so we got fire token and we got carbon. So fire token, we'll start with Firetoken. Fire token is an ICO for a gated forum community that would use token voting to generate a wisdom of the crowd evaluation service for other icos users would stake the token in correspondence to how legitimate the ICO was. Positive people, you would build up your reputation with positive voting history and you would be able to show a resume of positively reviewed icos and the reviews would be instantiated and verified by the blockchain. So that's fire token. Carbon. Carbon.
00:11:34.990 - 00:11:39.380, Speaker A: This ICO would have any question. Yeah.
00:11:42.330 - 00:11:47.830, Speaker C: It'S like a Ponzi scheme on top of a Ponzi scheme, which makes me think if it's going to exist anywhere, it's crypto.
00:11:49.530 - 00:11:50.280, Speaker B: Quite.
00:11:50.650 - 00:11:53.314, Speaker C: Yeah, I got to hear carbon.
00:11:53.362 - 00:12:14.560, Speaker A: We'll compare carbon. This ICO would give you membership access to an online blockchain enabled e commerce store. Owning a token would allow you to own a share of the revenue going through the blockchain. All product reviews would be verified with the blockchain and all sales would be an immutable record to carbon's propriety. Blockchain technology.
00:12:17.250 - 00:12:19.760, Speaker E: It's scary how real they both sound.
00:12:20.610 - 00:12:27.140, Speaker D: I was going to say all the icos use the word blockchain a million times in their pitches back in the day.
00:12:28.790 - 00:12:39.862, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like, what was the food company that changed their name to be like Long island blockchain? Yeah. Finance is so weird like that. Am I allowed to Google?
00:12:39.996 - 00:12:41.094, Speaker B: No. Hell no.
00:12:41.132 - 00:12:42.886, Speaker A: I don't think either of these would show up.
00:12:42.908 - 00:12:44.442, Speaker B: No. Fact checking on this show.
00:12:44.576 - 00:12:51.014, Speaker C: I googled both of them and I found both of them already. Are they science?
00:12:51.062 - 00:12:52.700, Speaker A: One of these I just made up.
00:12:54.830 - 00:12:59.180, Speaker B: Everything is just either going all the way the fuck up or all the way the fuck down right now.
00:13:00.430 - 00:13:09.314, Speaker C: I think fire token has got to be the real one. Just because it seems like something someone would try to do with a prediction mark is like use an ICO to predict an ICO. So I think that's real one.
00:13:09.432 - 00:13:15.762, Speaker A: If I had a ding sound, a sound effect, which we will in the future, I would be playing it because Kevin Owaki. That is the correct answer. Nice job.
00:13:15.816 - 00:13:16.242, Speaker B: Good job.
00:13:16.296 - 00:13:22.082, Speaker A: That's also why I gave it to you for a token voting with some sort of reputation system. It felt right to give that one to you.
00:13:22.216 - 00:13:25.430, Speaker B: Look at the intention we have with our guests. Look at that. Look at that.
00:13:25.500 - 00:13:28.114, Speaker C: Wow. One for one. You guys going to beat that sassel?
00:13:28.242 - 00:13:31.160, Speaker A: Kevin Awakey's got one point. Congrats. He's on the board.
00:13:31.530 - 00:14:06.254, Speaker B: Okay, who's next? I think this is going to Anthony Cesano. Allow me to pitch you spot token or pet community. All right, spot token. Here's my notes. Owning an allotted amount of spot tokens would enable a user to be able to claim parking spots around the world. So this is kind of tokenizing your real estate that you have ownership over as a renter or as an owner. Spot stakers can earn spot from renters and the treasury for maintaining listed parking spots like people's driveway on the marketplace.
00:14:06.254 - 00:14:42.586, Speaker B: So that's how spot is generated and people that stake spot can own or have the ability to list a parking spot on the spot marketplace. Pet community. This is from a company that makes and wants to make a smart pet caller a community. Shared pet data on the blockchain. A decentralized database for pet health data derived from smart callers and manual user entry. So there are also people just putting in that my dog took a shit over here. Meant to provide a global resource to builders, owners and healthcare providers.
00:14:42.586 - 00:14:53.090, Speaker B: Constantly updated resources. The pet token coordinates and incentivizes activities on the pet community blockchain. All right. Anthony, Sasana, do you have any questions about either of these blockchains projects?
00:14:53.590 - 00:14:56.962, Speaker D: Spot token sounds less real than pet community.
00:14:57.096 - 00:14:58.100, Speaker B: Less real?
00:14:59.030 - 00:15:03.390, Speaker D: Yeah, well, they both sound like they could have been real. That's the problem, right? It was 2017.
00:15:03.470 - 00:15:06.200, Speaker B: What's real? It's just a white paper and a website.
00:15:08.010 - 00:15:34.394, Speaker D: Actual kind of, like, not completely made up. Obviously, most of them were made up or like something that you pulled from 2017, but I don't know. It sounds like it's less real because of the fact that you said staking, and staking wasn't really a thing in 2017, as big as it is now, right? It was like master nodes and stuff like that. So I don't know. This is tough. This is tough. I don't want to lose.
00:15:34.394 - 00:15:41.460, Speaker D: I don't want Kevin to have one up for me. I think spot token is a fake one, though.
00:15:41.830 - 00:15:44.370, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah, spot token is a fake one.
00:15:44.440 - 00:15:48.930, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Spot token was Michael Wong's brainchild.
00:15:50.310 - 00:16:03.442, Speaker B: We thought it was a hot play in 2018, but we didn't do anything with it. It was just lived on discord. All right, nice pressure on this one. Go ahead, Dave.
00:16:03.586 - 00:16:54.860, Speaker A: All right, so first one is health sapiens. Health sapiens is an ICO that will take care of your blockchain based healthcare records management system, so you could never lose access to your healthcare records. You would use the health sapiens blockchain to upload and store your healthcare records in an immutable fashion. And you would use the health sapiens token as an incentivization tool to facilitate coordination between doctors and other care providers, as well as your own healthcare records. You could also sell your healthcare data to any buyer of the data, and you would receive health sapien tokens for people who wanted to access your health data in order to run research, experiments, or whatever people do with healthcare data that is health sapiens fastpass. Do you have any questions about health apiece before we move on?
00:16:55.390 - 00:17:14.010, Speaker E: No, I'm just listening to the language because there's, like, language I've recognized. That's how I know that it's not real, because it's, like, 2021 language that we all use. We'll see here. Maybe I'll get this right or wrong, but, yeah. Tell me about FastPass.
00:17:14.170 - 00:17:45.314, Speaker A: Fastpass. FastPass is for the world of autonomous driving cars who need to pass other cars. And you would use the FastPass token in order to pay other cars to move aside so that you could drive through the cars. And so it was literally a fast pass, and you would load up your car with the fast pass tokens and the autonomous driving vehicle would just send fast pass tokens to other autonomous vehicles in order for them to part and allow you to Fastpass. Fastpass. Join the ICO now.
00:17:45.452 - 00:18:08.240, Speaker E: It's scary how real they sound. I think FastPass is the fake one because I want to remember that 2017, there wasn't a lot of talk about using tokens with basically Internet of things. So I think that's the slip up there. But it sounded real. I think FastPass is the fake one.
00:18:09.090 - 00:18:16.722, Speaker A: Fastpass was my brainchild that I never decided to ICO in 2017. So correct healthiens is the real ICO. That actually happened.
00:18:16.776 - 00:18:17.650, Speaker E: There we go.
00:18:17.800 - 00:18:24.290, Speaker B: I brought the hitters. I told you guys I would bring the hitters. I gave them layups, though, with that. That was nice. Good job.
00:18:24.360 - 00:18:25.154, Speaker A: Good job, guys.
00:18:25.272 - 00:18:34.998, Speaker B: Well done. In the experimental show. We would have some applause sounds here, guys. Come on. We're bootstrapping it. We're bootstrapping it. Okay.
00:18:34.998 - 00:18:45.418, Speaker B: Hey, I think we're ready for our first event. That was just a little warm up, little layup. Excuse me, crypto fantasy drafts. All right, Michael Fancy, I have to.
00:18:45.424 - 00:18:46.906, Speaker A: Explain the rules for the audience.
00:18:47.098 - 00:19:35.254, Speaker B: Okay, folks, so this is similar to any sort of draft, if you're familiar with a major league sports draft, especially if you're familiar with a fantasy leagues draft. But if you're not, each of us, all five of us, are going to be picking a team, a roster of three team members. We're not going to be drafting any football players or anything. We're going to be drafting today. The topic is to draft our favorite anonymous crypto Twitter accounts. When you do this and you make your choice for first pick in the first round, you need to make your case to the top signal audience, all 22 of us watching this right now. And then also to the other participants on the panel.
00:19:35.254 - 00:20:00.500, Speaker B: Okay, we're not voting, though. Nobody here is going to say, yo, that's not right. Don't choose that there. We can neg you, but we're going to post this as a crypto Twitter poll and we'll let everybody else decide there. So we're going to be drafting teams. It's also in a snake format, so 12345 and then 54321 in the second round, and then again on the third round. 12345, 4th round back.
00:20:00.500 - 00:20:03.560, Speaker B: Any questions? Any questions?
00:20:05.050 - 00:20:08.166, Speaker E: Did you say it has to be an anonymous account or can?
00:20:08.188 - 00:20:08.422, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:08.476 - 00:20:09.640, Speaker A: So this is account.
00:20:10.570 - 00:20:24.554, Speaker B: Great opportunity to define the rules. What's anonymous? Who's anonymous here? Right. If they have a podcast and they've shown their face. Who's anonymous. If we do that, we know their voice. I think it should be someone. I'm going to only choose people.
00:20:24.554 - 00:20:29.482, Speaker B: I don't know what they look like. Yeah, I'll try my best on that.
00:20:29.536 - 00:20:36.000, Speaker A: But you can make the argument for somebody that's on the edge. If you want to make the argument for it, you can do that. It's part of the game.
00:20:37.250 - 00:20:49.554, Speaker E: Now that makes sense. Yeah, I got you. There could be some on the edge that are like, they're co founders of a popular protocol, but they're less, like, in the media, so. Yeah, makes sense.
00:20:49.672 - 00:20:55.400, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah, I hear you're going with that. Should we get started? If anybody else have any questions.
00:20:57.610 - 00:20:57.926, Speaker A: I.
00:20:57.948 - 00:21:08.294, Speaker B: Have a format here, let me start populating. Oh, it's supposed to be five also. Crap. Well, anyways, how do we want to do the order? Dave, can you dictate it to me?
00:21:08.412 - 00:21:23.470, Speaker A: Yeah, why don't we start with. Because on the stream we have Kevin awakee to the far left. We have Defi dad in the middle. Then we have Anthony Cesano on the right. And then we have you right above Anthony and then me to the left. And so I think that should be the order. So I think we should start with Kevin awakee, followed up by Defi dad.
00:21:23.470 - 00:21:31.540, Speaker A: Okay, so Kevin awakee, first pick. Who's it going to be? Don't ruin your first pick. It's important.
00:21:32.950 - 00:21:38.660, Speaker C: Oh, man, I feel like I got a ringer because I got the first draft. But I'm going to take.
00:21:40.470 - 00:21:42.774, Speaker A: Banteg. All right.
00:21:42.892 - 00:21:43.762, Speaker C: From Wifi?
00:21:43.826 - 00:21:48.550, Speaker A: Yeah, why Banteg? You got to convince us that it's the right pitch.
00:21:49.370 - 00:22:07.334, Speaker C: I respect the ship. I mean, Anon Dev working for Wifi, shipping, since been shipping. He's like, andre's not right hand person. I just think that Benteg is crushing it. I don't know how to pronounce their handle. Benteg. Benteg.
00:22:07.382 - 00:22:08.380, Speaker A: I think that's right.
00:22:08.830 - 00:22:20.350, Speaker C: But, yeah, they're just crushing it. They're shipping. So much for urine. And they rescue other protocols. Of course. That's going to be my first pick. He's going to rescue if anything ever bad happens to be in the blockchain.
00:22:21.170 - 00:22:22.802, Speaker A: All right, pretty compelling pick.
00:22:22.936 - 00:22:25.634, Speaker B: Future collab, bitcoin, banteg. Collab coming up.
00:22:25.672 - 00:22:26.626, Speaker C: Yeah, there you go.
00:22:26.808 - 00:22:28.046, Speaker B: Top signal, baby.
00:22:28.158 - 00:22:32.802, Speaker C: I hope they're not listening because if so, I'm going to sound like a total stand for Bante.
00:22:32.866 - 00:22:39.190, Speaker B: They're totally not listening. It's okay. Nobody's listening. It's okay. Okay, first round overall.
00:22:39.610 - 00:22:40.706, Speaker A: Off the table.
00:22:40.898 - 00:22:41.730, Speaker B: Off the table.
00:22:41.810 - 00:22:43.880, Speaker A: All right, Anthony Sadano, who's your pick?
00:22:44.330 - 00:22:45.286, Speaker B: It's dad, right?
00:22:45.308 - 00:22:50.506, Speaker A: Or you said, oh, no, excuse me. It's his dad. It's c five, dad. Sorry, apologies is the way I listed it.
00:22:50.528 - 00:22:51.210, Speaker B: Stupid.
00:22:51.710 - 00:23:37.962, Speaker E: Mine might be on the edge here. So he kind of maintains a pseudo anonymous identity, but obviously I know him from working at Zapper. He goes by kryptono milk. I'm not going to say his first name because he actually does try to maintain a private identity. Yeah, but he's a co founder and he's basically CTO of Zapper, this guy, he builds everything and he's got that personality where you're like, hey, man, can you build a rocket ship? And he's like, oh, yeah, it's fine, I'll just do it over the weekend. So, yeah, I would nominate him, even though I'm probably a little biased just working with him.
00:23:38.016 - 00:23:44.138, Speaker B: Yeah, a little bit. What value are we getting from his Twitter, though? Let's take a look. Did I spell it right here?
00:23:44.224 - 00:23:59.806, Speaker E: So he does comment, but he tends to be like. He's in the bantig category. He's like one of those few people who has coded smart contracts where more than a billion dollars has moved through it. So, yeah, it's cryptono milk is his.
00:23:59.988 - 00:24:01.280, Speaker B: Did I get that right?
00:24:01.730 - 00:24:03.680, Speaker E: Yes, you got it.
00:24:04.610 - 00:24:07.300, Speaker A: You have to work on that URL real quick.
00:24:08.630 - 00:24:12.280, Speaker E: Let me find it for pain.
00:24:13.370 - 00:24:15.080, Speaker B: Sorry. We'll move on.
00:24:15.770 - 00:24:16.390, Speaker E: All right.
00:24:16.460 - 00:24:22.280, Speaker A: And no Ian Bandag. Michael Wong, just the G. All right, thank you, sir.
00:24:23.210 - 00:24:25.670, Speaker B: All right, sass, you're up, baby.
00:24:26.430 - 00:24:52.434, Speaker D: I mean, for my first pick, I'm going to pick tetranode. This guy is the ultimate eth, Chad. He sets bottoms, he saves us from the depths of hell with the eth price. If I had to pick anyone to be on my squad, anyone anonymous, it would be tetronode for sure. I mean, I don't know how many people follow him, but he is hilarious. I'm assuming it's a he because he's one of the ones that are truly anonymous. So I'm just assuming here it's a he.
00:24:52.434 - 00:25:10.920, Speaker D: And I don't think anyone really knows who he is, but, yeah, he's just hilarious on Twitter. He's like a pure eth, Maxi. And I mean, he's not a laugh either. He actually has like a nine figure net worth, I think, from what I've seen. I'm pretty sure you can see it on chain. So, yeah, that's my first pick.
00:25:12.090 - 00:25:22.060, Speaker A: Solid first pick. I think it's kind of a mic drop pick, if you ask me, but I won't show my opponent too hard. All right, Michael Wong, you're up.
00:25:22.590 - 00:25:37.630, Speaker B: Wow. In the style of tetranode, the guy. Excuse me. I don't want to assume the gender of this account. I am so appreciative of antipro synthesis.
00:25:38.690 - 00:25:39.440, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:41.410 - 00:25:44.570, Speaker B: Anti pro synthesis.
00:25:44.650 - 00:25:45.870, Speaker A: Antipronthesis.
00:25:46.790 - 00:26:07.586, Speaker B: Listen, thank you for lifting everybody up with your retweets. We need to see that you gave me some followers. They needed to see that. I appreciate you, anti prosynthesis. Thank you for your eth chadness. As Sass said, you show us the things I want to see inside of my little echo chamber. That is my timeline, so thank you so much for that anti protests.
00:26:07.586 - 00:26:11.050, Speaker B: If you're an eth person, you love their retweets. Thank you so much.
00:26:11.120 - 00:26:11.354, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:26:11.392 - 00:26:15.340, Speaker A: You can call him anti pro for how. That's how everyone knows, you know. Anti pro.
00:26:16.670 - 00:26:24.238, Speaker B: Wow. Well, he's on my team now, so I don't know. I'm not on anti pro basis with him yet, but. All right.
00:26:24.404 - 00:26:31.910, Speaker A: All right. You guys ready for mine? It's got to go with Djen. Spartan. Who else, man? Who else? He single handedly.
00:26:31.930 - 00:26:33.714, Speaker E: I am surprised no one said that.
00:26:33.832 - 00:27:10.814, Speaker A: Single handedly ended the bear market. You hate him and you love him all at the same time. He's definitely one of the inspirations for the line of superposition between psyops or the best alpha you've ever seen. He's a creative Twitter account where if you follow his tweets, you really have to think about his tweets, like, oh, am I getting psyops, or am I getting, like, I don't really know. And he teaches you through that form. He teaches you how to navigate crypto Twitter. Also, he got in at synthetics in well under a dollar, and memed it straight to $7, and then didn't even go far enough.
00:27:10.814 - 00:27:16.880, Speaker A: Yeah. Djen Spartan. Good team member. Thanks, Djen, for being on my team.
00:27:17.570 - 00:27:18.720, Speaker B: I appreciate that.
00:27:19.730 - 00:27:22.020, Speaker A: Oh, shit. I get two. Okay.
00:27:24.150 - 00:27:33.746, Speaker B: That concludes the first round. Okay, so, first pick overall, Kevin Awaki, Defi dad, chose Zapper, co founder, cryptono milk.
00:27:33.938 - 00:27:36.950, Speaker E: I screwed up. I can see the trend of this. I was.
00:27:37.020 - 00:27:37.522, Speaker B: Hmm.
00:27:37.586 - 00:27:42.070, Speaker E: I want to build the future of defi. I choose cryptono milk.
00:27:42.810 - 00:27:47.740, Speaker B: I got you. No, that was dope for that. But, yeah, no, you could have got that the third round, probably.
00:27:49.630 - 00:27:52.140, Speaker D: My a on account could beat up your a on account.
00:27:52.750 - 00:28:01.546, Speaker B: Yeah, we got tetranode from SAS, anti pro from me. And David chose G. Go ahead and pick the first pick of the second round.
00:28:01.578 - 00:28:06.400, Speaker A: David, I'm going to have to go with. Oh, gosh, I just lost it.
00:28:06.930 - 00:28:08.560, Speaker B: Take some time. Take your time.
00:28:11.950 - 00:28:31.150, Speaker A: Guess I'll go with loom dart. I'm going to go with Loomdart because we're talking about crypto Twitter personalities. Like, what the hell? He's a couch slurping the dip with laser eyes, and it's loomdart. He's a crypto Twitter personality. What else does he do other than be a crypto Twitter personality?
00:28:31.310 - 00:28:38.040, Speaker B: That's true. I saw what he looked like in real life, though, so it kind of kills it for me. You know what I mean? He had an admin reveal once.
00:28:39.610 - 00:28:43.400, Speaker D: Everyone knows what he looks like now. I think there's pictures of him everywhere now.
00:28:43.930 - 00:28:49.866, Speaker A: No Twitter account for sure. He was ain't on for a lot.
00:28:49.888 - 00:28:51.466, Speaker D: Longer than he's been known for, so.
00:28:51.488 - 00:28:55.930, Speaker A: I think it counts, and that's my pick. And on crypto or loom dart.
00:28:57.230 - 00:28:57.690, Speaker B: Okay.
00:28:57.760 - 00:28:59.030, Speaker D: Pump at loomdart.
00:28:59.190 - 00:29:20.590, Speaker B: We like that. This is going to be semi controversial, potentially. We'll see what people have to say about it. But if you were around last defi summer, you know this person, you appreciate this person, and for all the work that they did for us that summer, I'm going to have to say blue kirby. Blue Kirby.
00:29:20.670 - 00:29:21.250, Speaker D: Oh, God.
00:29:21.320 - 00:29:23.602, Speaker A: I thought you were about to say andre about to get in a fight.
00:29:23.656 - 00:29:24.514, Speaker B: It could have been so many different.
00:29:24.552 - 00:29:26.066, Speaker A: Whether he's anonymous or not.
00:29:26.168 - 00:29:35.800, Speaker B: No, I would not say andre that. I want to say blue kirby for specifically yiffy from price I bought to price I sold that summer. Thank you so much for that.
00:29:37.850 - 00:29:39.306, Speaker D: They also rugged in the end, but.
00:29:39.328 - 00:29:45.660, Speaker A: Anyway, he did rug. Yeah. It sounds like you're picking him because you got out before he rugged you.
00:29:46.910 - 00:30:03.550, Speaker B: The people who are going to vote for me, they know what kind of value to derive from it. I also just respect the husk, dude. Respect the husk from someone who. Hello. You know, why so respect the husk? I respect the husk, sir, but do not respect the rug. All right, go ahead, dad.
00:30:05.270 - 00:30:07.620, Speaker D: I think it's me now. Yeah, it's me.
00:30:09.830 - 00:30:10.242, Speaker A: Easy.
00:30:10.296 - 00:30:11.826, Speaker D: Next pick. Chain link God.
00:30:11.928 - 00:30:14.820, Speaker E: The link chat God you took.
00:30:16.710 - 00:30:43.946, Speaker D: Mean. If you're going into war against anyone that's saying anything remotely bad about chainlink, this is the guy that you want, and he is my favorite follower because I don't need to follow anyone else to get the chainlink. Alpha, if I want to know what's going on I just follow chainlink God. And not only on Chainlink, but he knows a lot about Ethereum and a lot about just like a lot of other stuff happening. And generally I view him as kind of like my Maxi mirror, where I would be considered an eth. Maxi. He's a link maxi.
00:30:43.946 - 00:30:49.680, Speaker D: And he just goes to fight for link like I would go to fight for Eth. So, yeah, he's my second pick.
00:30:50.850 - 00:31:01.278, Speaker E: He's a great representation of the community. I love the guy, too. I'm going to go with, mine's pretty easy. I was going to pick Hasu. I mean, he's just brilliant.
00:31:01.454 - 00:31:02.820, Speaker B: Yeah, that was hot.
00:31:03.990 - 00:31:51.700, Speaker E: Well, he's one of those people too who, he maintained an anonymous Persona and he's just smarter than most people. Yeah, and I wouldn't say that about most people just have an expertise that they focus on and they become better and better at whatever they do. But he is just scary good at everything. And yeah, I would definitely credit him with some of the growth of the crypto industry as a whole over the last few years, but he definitely was one of the few brave bitcoiners who saw the light with what was going on with Ethereum and I mean, he's really become one of the best educators of Ethereum and Defi now. Thank you.
00:31:52.950 - 00:31:56.866, Speaker B: Deep into the second round, Hasu got, wow, that was a snipe.
00:31:56.978 - 00:32:00.040, Speaker E: No, that was a mistake. Yes, he should have been like, first or second?
00:32:02.890 - 00:32:05.320, Speaker A: It makes up for your first round pick.
00:32:07.850 - 00:32:22.726, Speaker D: You know what, it's funny thing about Hasu is that I totally agree with you. He's an amazing pick. But for some reason in my mind, he doesn't strike me as like the Ainon crew that petronode. And like, I think of the Ainon as like the meme mean, doesn't Hasu.
00:32:22.758 - 00:32:24.170, Speaker C: Work at paradigm or something?
00:32:24.240 - 00:32:30.734, Speaker D: I think, no, he's independent, but he helps out paradigm, I think, like with writing blog posts and research for them.
00:32:30.852 - 00:32:33.130, Speaker B: Yeah, okay. I thought he was a researcher at paradigm.
00:32:33.290 - 00:32:56.230, Speaker E: Heteronode will talk about the wealth that he has, and he's one of the few people I actually believe. Most people, I think, are full of shit, but he's like a whale, beyond a whale. At this point I'm imagining he's still at nine figures while prices are where they're at. So could be one of our first trillionaires, anonymous trillionaires.
00:32:56.730 - 00:33:01.014, Speaker D: He slurps the dipperino, my friend, slurping it up.
00:33:01.212 - 00:33:03.080, Speaker A: Where did that meme come from?
00:33:04.910 - 00:33:09.260, Speaker D: Ct? Like where all these beautiful shit memes come from.
00:33:09.710 - 00:33:12.714, Speaker C: That's a new one too. I haven't seen it more than like three days ago.
00:33:12.832 - 00:33:14.190, Speaker B: Yeah, it's kind of fresh.
00:33:14.610 - 00:33:21.760, Speaker D: This is why bear markets. I mean, bear market down markets are good because the memes are just so much better. Shared hope is better than shared hope.
00:33:23.010 - 00:33:24.610, Speaker A: Wow, nice one. Nice.
00:33:24.680 - 00:33:25.058, Speaker C: Wow.
00:33:25.144 - 00:33:25.346, Speaker E: Nice.
00:33:25.368 - 00:33:30.290, Speaker B: That's, that's the kind of content you're getting on top signal, folks. Let's round out the second round. Kevin awakee.
00:33:32.950 - 00:33:34.002, Speaker C: Inverse bra.
00:33:34.136 - 00:33:34.914, Speaker A: You start back.
00:33:34.952 - 00:33:35.540, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:39.210 - 00:33:45.880, Speaker C: People keep on tagging him in my mentions and I don't know what it is. I keep saying things and people just keep tagging. Inverse bra. What is that?
00:33:47.470 - 00:33:52.380, Speaker A: That's it. That's the joke. After you see it, the joke's already over.
00:33:53.550 - 00:34:07.386, Speaker B: Exactly. Good pick. So let's round. Let me, let me recap. David chose loomdart for the first pick of the second round. I chose blue Kirby. You know why? Chain link God the summoner Hasu so deep into the second round.
00:34:07.386 - 00:34:17.380, Speaker B: Good. Great pick. And inverse broad. I think that is squarely a great second round pick to round it out. Yeah. If you see him in your mention, someone's dissing you. Go ahead.
00:34:21.350 - 00:34:22.434, Speaker C: That's what it is.
00:34:22.552 - 00:34:23.460, Speaker A: Oh no.
00:34:26.070 - 00:34:36.630, Speaker B: And they could also be dissing themselves trying to inverse brawls somebody. So that happens. All right, so let's round out your team here, sir. Who's the last pick in the third round or your first pick in the first?
00:34:36.700 - 00:34:43.638, Speaker C: Okay, I'm going to start. What I'm going to hope is the precedent by just having a total shit post for my third pick. Because it's the third pick. Who cares?
00:34:43.654 - 00:34:44.890, Speaker B: Passion pick. Passion pick.
00:34:44.960 - 00:34:52.254, Speaker C: Passion pick. And this one only has 150 followers. So I'm going weird and esoteric with it.
00:34:52.292 - 00:34:52.880, Speaker A: Wow.
00:34:56.210 - 00:35:03.098, Speaker C: It's called Zuko Googling. And it's just a Twitter account of like, do you guys know?
00:35:03.204 - 00:35:03.474, Speaker B: No.
00:35:03.512 - 00:35:27.906, Speaker C: Zuko Zooko is the founder of Zcash. And he's like this famous privacy nerd and carnivore. So it's all just like things he would be googling, like zero knowledge, meat distribution. Like just stupid stuff like that. So I don't know, only 150 followers. I feel like I'll have pumped it if he gets up to 160 tonight. Zucco googling.
00:35:28.098 - 00:35:31.100, Speaker A: God. Way too good.
00:35:34.030 - 00:35:36.410, Speaker B: Okay, Mr. Dad.
00:35:36.830 - 00:36:04.306, Speaker E: It's funny because I had this ongoing list here, but I was thinking about drafting people that would ensure that Defi Ethereum crypto is successful. And I've realized I was failing at what the task is here. So one of the most obvious picks, which, odly enough, is here on this is called up only again, that's the name of the show.
00:36:04.488 - 00:36:06.580, Speaker B: No, this is the other one. The other one.
00:36:07.350 - 00:36:14.438, Speaker E: Whatever the other one is. No, man, I would pick Kobe. I think he's actually done all of this.
00:36:14.604 - 00:36:16.114, Speaker A: He's anon. He's not anon.
00:36:16.242 - 00:36:19.666, Speaker B: I don't know if we could choose that. So this is where the group's like, yo, I don't think that's anon.
00:36:19.698 - 00:36:20.810, Speaker E: No, he cannot.
00:36:22.670 - 00:36:26.940, Speaker C: He's pioneered so much crypto content. Know we should let him on just for.
00:36:32.510 - 00:36:33.018, Speaker A: Right?
00:36:33.104 - 00:36:52.738, Speaker D: No, I don't know if he ever was. He had the other account, his other account. And he'd been on Max Kaiser's show back in the really early days because he was the actual one of the. There's a video clip of him going on to Max Kaiser's show and talking about it. So I don't know if he was ever actually ain't on.
00:36:52.824 - 00:36:55.250, Speaker B: Okay. We respect your work. Wow.
00:36:55.320 - 00:37:02.354, Speaker E: Yeah. Didn't realize. But I'll throw in our friend DC investor.
00:37:02.402 - 00:37:09.080, Speaker A: I think we know his name. His name's off top and I've seen his face.
00:37:14.410 - 00:37:19.980, Speaker E: I wouldn't dig into DC investor's NFT portfolio. I'm pretty sure that's going to zero. But.
00:37:21.710 - 00:37:24.694, Speaker A: I do admire, I think you're chafe.
00:37:24.742 - 00:37:25.426, Speaker D: You cannot chase.
00:37:25.478 - 00:37:28.526, Speaker C: Yeah, you're choosing Don Enon so you can get more than one pick.
00:37:28.628 - 00:37:34.366, Speaker B: There's literally just one rule, bro. Anonymous. That's the only rule.
00:37:34.558 - 00:37:36.146, Speaker E: Are these like people that I just.
00:37:36.168 - 00:37:39.346, Speaker B: Don'T know the name of everyone you.
00:37:39.368 - 00:37:40.978, Speaker D: Don'T know DC investors name?
00:37:41.064 - 00:37:42.100, Speaker C: This is your.
00:37:45.110 - 00:37:47.540, Speaker D: Tough tub. He had it on his twitter for like.
00:37:51.270 - 00:37:52.434, Speaker E: Do I still need to pick one?
00:37:52.472 - 00:37:53.700, Speaker A: Yeah, you still need to pick.
00:37:55.050 - 00:37:56.166, Speaker B: You can go in with two.
00:37:56.188 - 00:37:58.018, Speaker D: But like my boy Tetranode is going to.
00:37:58.044 - 00:38:06.182, Speaker E: I got one. I'll stick with my legit list of builders and educators. I love Scoopy trubles.
00:38:06.246 - 00:38:07.850, Speaker B: I was going to say Scoopy.
00:38:08.190 - 00:38:24.660, Speaker E: I think he's a really good one. And if you haven't learned about Alchemyx, I personally do not hold any Alcx bags, but I just love the way that Alchemyx works with self paying loans. So check that out.
00:38:25.590 - 00:38:42.454, Speaker B: Nice. Also our sponsor, thank you for that. He just posted something like the other day was like, I like sex or sex is great. And I texted Dale. I was like, I love our sponsors, man. It's just best hop signal sponsors in the game. We appreciate it.
00:38:42.454 - 00:38:47.590, Speaker B: Thank you very much, Scoopy. All right, Sass with your last pick for the third round.
00:38:47.930 - 00:39:01.840, Speaker D: Yes. So if you're going into a yield farm and you've got tetranode and Chainlink God backing you up, they're going to suck out all the yield. They're going to bring the whale power. You're going to need someone to check that those smart contracts are safe. So my boy Samsung is my third pick.
00:39:07.170 - 00:39:08.106, Speaker A: Sam Ainon.
00:39:08.138 - 00:39:09.710, Speaker C: His name is in his Twitter account.
00:39:09.860 - 00:39:26.510, Speaker D: No one knows who he is. Even on Paradigm's site. His picture is like his anime picture. No one knows who he is. Out of us, I assume paradigm probably does, but he's ain't on for sure. Sam Cz's son is his Twitter.
00:39:26.590 - 00:39:28.440, Speaker C: I was just figured that was his name.
00:39:29.050 - 00:39:32.358, Speaker D: I mean, it could be his name, but do you know who he is? Yeah.
00:39:32.524 - 00:39:35.720, Speaker A: Are you sure about that? Are you sure that's his name?
00:39:38.510 - 00:39:44.058, Speaker D: It says Cz in it. Maybe he's the CEO of binance and he's been siopsing us this whole time.
00:39:44.224 - 00:39:44.940, Speaker C: Wow.
00:39:46.990 - 00:39:48.634, Speaker D: Sunsun.
00:39:48.752 - 00:39:51.894, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, thank you. Obviously, I don't know this dude, but.
00:39:52.032 - 00:39:55.614, Speaker D: You don't know Samsung. Well, you never been rugged before, sir.
00:39:55.732 - 00:39:56.720, Speaker B: There you go.
00:39:58.530 - 00:39:59.710, Speaker A: He's the hero.
00:40:00.770 - 00:40:02.922, Speaker D: Yeah, he saves people from being rugged.
00:40:03.066 - 00:40:12.260, Speaker A: You know that Futurama episode where the line is like, if God is talking to Bender and he's like, well, if you do things right, people won't know that you've done anything at.
00:40:13.910 - 00:40:23.286, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, he's the you up guy. If you get a telegram message from Sam and you're like a founder of a Defi protocol and he white hat type energy.
00:40:23.468 - 00:40:23.910, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:23.980 - 00:40:27.590, Speaker A: You want to be up, you're getting up immediately.
00:40:28.970 - 00:40:42.330, Speaker B: Understand? Okay. It's my feeling I was going to pick Scoopy here. I did not think dad was going to pick that, especially with the third bullet in the chamber.
00:40:47.390 - 00:40:48.640, Speaker A: You'Re running out of.
00:40:49.490 - 00:41:04.798, Speaker B: I have. I have one to fall back on and I just. Okay, I'm going to use it. First episode, I'm going to call out, I'm a sandwich. You don't know this person. Maybe Defi dad does. I'm a sandwich.
00:41:04.798 - 00:41:23.878, Speaker B: I'm a sandwich is a dev on Zapper. And I appreciate you because one day I bought Ren Doge on Polygon and it wasn't showing up. And I tweeted at you and you literally dm me like, let me do that real quick. Thank you for doing that. This is the power of Zapper. His dudes like that or people like that. I'm a sandwich.
00:41:24.054 - 00:41:35.406, Speaker E: He's a really good one. He's so responsive. He's one of the few devs that's always in our support and just. Yeah, he's one of the best. Good pick.
00:41:35.508 - 00:41:40.750, Speaker A: And he's literally a sandwich. No, I'm a sandwich on his Twitter account. It's actually a sandwich.
00:41:41.330 - 00:41:45.358, Speaker B: Yeah, he's a sandwich. All right, Dave, let's round out this game.
00:41:45.444 - 00:41:58.466, Speaker A: All right, he's been with us through 2017. He went through the 2018 2019 bear market with us. He feels a little bit like comfort food on Twitter. You got to go with the wolf of Ethereum.
00:41:58.658 - 00:42:00.598, Speaker D: Luca, good pick.
00:42:00.684 - 00:42:01.030, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:01.100 - 00:42:02.550, Speaker A: Wolf of Ethereum.
00:42:03.290 - 00:42:07.202, Speaker D: Yeah, he's definitely like the 8th maxi's. 8th maxi.
00:42:07.266 - 00:42:24.890, Speaker A: Yeah. The anti pros like cousin, I would say probably. He's got these lyx token bags that he really shills, but other than that, full blown eth Maxi, left and right, man. And that's my lineup.
00:42:25.390 - 00:42:35.760, Speaker B: Good game. Good game, folks. That was our first crypto draft signal. GG, we're going to let. I'm going to screenshot this. I'm going to fix it up. We'll let crypto Twitter decide later on.
00:42:35.760 - 00:42:39.954, Speaker B: Dave, did we run into the next one? Should we just do it?
00:42:39.992 - 00:42:42.066, Speaker A: Let's keep on going, man. Let's keep on doing it.
00:42:42.088 - 00:43:07.690, Speaker B: All right, we're powering right through around the horn, so take a breath, everybody. We just finished draft. Good job, everybody. And all the participants around the horn, we're going to get hot takes on a number of topics. Just like if you've seen the ESPN show, a lot like that. I'm going to moderate everybody else, sas, d five, dad, Kevin and David. I'm going to show a prompt on the screen and everybody's going to have 30 seconds to respond to that prompt.
00:43:07.690 - 00:43:26.942, Speaker B: It's going to go in order of. I guess we're going to go in this order since I wrote it this way. Sas, DFI, Dad, David and Kevin. And then just keep going around again. I'll have a prompt on the screen. We're going to play the thing for 30 seconds. You guys are going to have hot takes.
00:43:26.942 - 00:43:49.318, Speaker B: You can respond to each other's takes. Try and be polarizing. That's kind of the point of the game here. You don't have to be. And whoever we are all going to decide, the Dow chat is going to decide inside of the chat who should win the round. And right here, I'll add a point to your score and whoever wins at the end gets to show whatever they want at the end of the game for 30 seconds. Whatever you want could be non crypto related if you want it to be.
00:43:49.404 - 00:43:57.558, Speaker A: Before we get started, I would like to say that Googling Zuko apparently has gotten over ten followers in the last few minutes, according to Daniel from bankless Dow. Thanks, Daniel.
00:43:57.654 - 00:44:20.480, Speaker B: Top signal, baby. That's the top signal effect. Sponsors top signal hug. That's a top signal effect, baby. All right, I don't know that I'm just going to do the timer on my phone, but let's start. First question to sas, you have 30 seconds. How long will the DFI, or, sorry, will the NFT bear market last?
00:44:21.890 - 00:44:50.134, Speaker D: I mean, I don't even know if it's like a bear market. There's still a lot of stuff going on in the NFT space. But in terms of what happened during, I guess, the real mania with nfts, it's come down a lot. But I think that the NFT kind of like bull market, whatever you want to call it, was a consequence of everyone making a lot of money. So it was going to last until people make a lot of money again from ETH, defi assets, whatever other crypto assets, then they're going to come back and feel all rich and they're going to ape into all these random nfts. They've got no idea what they're doing. But they're like, I'm going to buy.
00:44:50.172 - 00:44:51.094, Speaker B: This because this is cool.
00:44:51.132 - 00:44:53.600, Speaker D: And then that's where we're going to get another NFT bull market.
00:44:54.210 - 00:44:57.150, Speaker B: Nice. Okay. What do you have to say to that, defi dad?
00:44:58.050 - 00:45:36.678, Speaker E: Yeah. I don't think that nfts are in the type of bear market that the rest of the crypto market is used to experiencing. The NFT market was always less liquid. I think it's still exponentially more liquid than it was a few years ago. So it's going to be another blip. Like you're going to look back and look at the dip and say, jesus, we didn't appreciate how early we were with nfts. That being said, though, I have little to no exposure to NFT.
00:45:36.774 - 00:45:39.020, Speaker B: Yeah, you're done. Your time's done. There you go.
00:45:43.070 - 00:46:08.182, Speaker C: Well, I don't know if you guys know this, but nfts stand for non fungible tokens. That means that they're all different from each other. And so I think that there's going to be some nfts that the bear market lasts forever until the heat death of the universe. They will go to zero and they will be bad. But if you have a brand, a following, and you know how to engage them and you do a good job of telling stories, creating luscious entropy with your art. Then you're going to see an NFT bull market very soon, my friends.
00:46:08.316 - 00:46:11.462, Speaker B: Oh, nice, my friend. I'm David. Wrap it up for us.
00:46:11.516 - 00:46:37.226, Speaker A: What's with all these goddamn bulls on this show, dude? The NFTs are going down, man. The NFT market. I'm going to tell you, this is the alpha for the show. It bottoms the moment I buy my first crypto punk and then it's going up. But until then, the NFT show is over. Dump your bags, sell it all, and then I'm going to get my first crypto punk.
00:46:37.418 - 00:46:38.160, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:38.850 - 00:46:39.454, Speaker A: Hot.
00:46:39.572 - 00:46:42.160, Speaker B: What does the chat have to say right now? It's blowing up.
00:46:42.530 - 00:46:46.420, Speaker C: What's the opposite of pump it loomdart? Like dump it? David, I think.
00:46:50.150 - 00:46:55.620, Speaker D: I didn't say it was bullish. I just said that I don't think know it's in like a traditional bear market. Like everyone.
00:46:57.450 - 00:47:00.710, Speaker C: I think heat death of the universe is pretty bearish.
00:47:03.370 - 00:47:09.970, Speaker D: David is just like a bear in Bull's clothing because he wants to get a cheap crypto, allegedly.
00:47:10.130 - 00:47:28.510, Speaker B: In the future, I'm going to be giving points just to everybody at different times, not just at the end around. That would be a perfect example. I'm going to give the point here to Kevin. I liked what you said about both sides of the coin. There's still so much opportunity for people, if they really have an audience to sell NFTs to. It's not just a free man's game. Next, the news.
00:47:28.510 - 00:47:49.750, Speaker B: Mark Cuban regrets not doing the math on Titan crypto investment as team denies rug. Know we love Mark Cuban on the bankless podcast. Gentleman, days after he posts a bullish blog post about yield farming and liquidity pools, gets rugged himself. What do you have to say to that? Let's start with this one. Let's start with Kevin.
00:47:51.370 - 00:47:52.920, Speaker C: Sorry, Mark, who?
00:47:55.610 - 00:47:56.360, Speaker A: Wow.
00:47:56.970 - 00:47:58.280, Speaker B: Do you yield the rest?
00:47:59.210 - 00:48:02.150, Speaker A: Kevin? Just 1 second to that joke.
00:48:03.130 - 00:48:18.266, Speaker C: What if I just let it sit for the rest of the time? I think if you're a fucking billionaire, you could afford to get rugged once. Or just to learn like the rest of us get rugged with. Like, I don't know. I got rugged with like $1,000 and that's how I learned he's a billionaire and he got rugged with a million. Like, it's all proportional.
00:48:18.458 - 00:48:19.998, Speaker B: Okay, what do you have to say?
00:48:20.084 - 00:48:23.760, Speaker E: Defi dad, is that how much he lost? A million?
00:48:24.930 - 00:48:27.406, Speaker A: I don't think anyone made that.
00:48:27.428 - 00:48:28.866, Speaker C: I just made that up. I'm just assuming he.
00:48:28.888 - 00:48:32.306, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it was a million. He lost a million dollars.
00:48:32.488 - 00:48:50.726, Speaker E: My answer is easy. Mark Cuban, who is an investor in Zapper. I have no comment. I mean, I wouldn't presume to know what Mark was thinking, but I respect whatever decisions he makes and what mistakes he makes. And I yield the rest of my time to the next person.
00:48:50.908 - 00:48:55.098, Speaker B: Excellent answer. Let's go, David, on this one. Let's wrap it up. After you.
00:48:55.184 - 00:49:15.120, Speaker A: Oh, Mark Cuban. We want you on the show eventually, but congratulations on getting your cherry popped in the world of Defi. You just got the battle scars like the rest of us. The calling for regulation. Controversial move, sir. Read the room. Read the room that you're in.
00:49:15.120 - 00:49:21.410, Speaker A: Take responsibility for your rug pull, sir, and I yield. My 2 seconds.
00:49:21.750 - 00:49:27.938, Speaker B: Do you have anything to say about the. Mark Cuban? The last part of what David just said there.
00:49:28.104 - 00:49:39.986, Speaker D: I mean, getting rugged in Defi is a rite of passage. You haven't been rugged. You haven't done Defi. So, yeah, it doesn't matter how much you've been rugged for. I guess it's proportional for sure. But also, yeah, calling for regulation. Hilarious.
00:49:39.986 - 00:49:54.702, Speaker D: That's just like the typical thing that people do, right? They go into something that they didn't really know about. They get rugged and money know, lose money, and they're like, oh, we need to regulate everything. Well, this is how we get shitty financial regulations. Mike Cuban, I hope you're listening to me. We don't want this, right?
00:49:54.836 - 00:49:55.520, Speaker B: Okay.
00:49:56.130 - 00:50:02.430, Speaker C: Someone should really do something about how bad my decision making is. Someone else should do something about it, though.
00:50:02.580 - 00:50:07.780, Speaker D: But only when you lose money. If you make money, it's all on you. If you lose money, well, then it's the government.
00:50:08.630 - 00:50:14.820, Speaker B: Okay. Defi died. Gets the points for that round. No doubt about it.
00:50:15.270 - 00:50:16.606, Speaker D: Is this arbitrary?
00:50:16.638 - 00:50:19.202, Speaker A: I've got no idea what judging criteria even is here.
00:50:19.256 - 00:50:20.242, Speaker B: There's no one. There's none.
00:50:20.306 - 00:50:22.840, Speaker A: Kevin, I'm so sorry I had to bring up this question.
00:50:24.570 - 00:50:27.762, Speaker B: Why does paradigm, as in valueless governance tokens?
00:50:27.906 - 00:50:29.640, Speaker A: Sorry, Sassel on that one.
00:50:32.670 - 00:50:35.066, Speaker D: I don't even know what to say.
00:50:35.248 - 00:50:36.620, Speaker B: 30 seconds, though.
00:50:37.230 - 00:50:55.774, Speaker D: They really believe in holding valueless governance tokens. I mean, who doesn't want to hold them? They're not worth anything. They don't do anything. And everyone should have a valueless governance token in their life. So I think that they're just trying to be like all of us, trying to relate to us. So, yeah, they invest in those to be on that level.
00:50:55.972 - 00:51:13.602, Speaker B: Sass, we're going to end it there. You get the point for that one. We need to go any further. Thank you for wearing that one for us. Let's go to the next one. This is cool. Jayz puts a crypto NFt, or, sorry, a crypto punk Nft as his Twitter profile picture.
00:51:13.602 - 00:51:27.180, Speaker B: NFT. Well, I don't think they need to add that last. And I think shortly after this, he was on a space, Twitter space with Jack talking about nfts and music. Let's see who should talk about this first. David, why don't you start us off?
00:51:28.990 - 00:51:52.114, Speaker A: This is the top signal, man. Jay Z's got the crypto punks. Like, it's time to, like, what more of a signal do you want? Dump your bags. This is the time that you get to dump on Jay Z and you get to say, like, oh, yeah, I dumped my crypto punk bags on Jayz. I don't know what more of a signal that I can give you guys. Yield my time.
00:51:52.152 - 00:51:56.714, Speaker B: He's talking to specifically whoever has the blonde NFt. Crypto punk.
00:51:56.782 - 00:51:59.640, Speaker A: The one with a gold necklace. That one. Dump that one.
00:52:00.490 - 00:52:02.550, Speaker B: Okay. Defi dad.
00:52:03.450 - 00:52:35.870, Speaker E: I've been worried about the same thing. Is this yet another top signal? I will say this is a reminder that NFTs actually bring culture to Ethereum, and that's one of the things that really sets us apart from everyone. This is why so many musicians and artists and creatives are getting involved. So my mind was blown. It's probably one of the best tweets I've put out in the past year in terms of impressions. Like, whatever. I noticed it and was like, holy shit, he's got a crypto punk.
00:52:36.870 - 00:52:41.170, Speaker B: Flex on the alpha drop. Thanks for that, Defi dad. Kevin.
00:52:42.950 - 00:53:01.900, Speaker C: Well, I think it's nice that he has a crypto punk, but what I want to know is, why doesn't he have an. Can't you just. Why can't you just buy Jay Z e and then hold it ransom until he tweets about you and then give it to him then? Pretty standard playbook for Mike. Why doesn't he have an Ens name? Mike, I yield my time.
00:53:05.710 - 00:53:09.654, Speaker B: Okay, sass, please give us 30 seconds on Jayz NFT.
00:53:09.782 - 00:53:16.270, Speaker D: No, I just want to make one edit to this title. It should say, jay Z's Twitter intern changes his profile picture to an NFT.
00:53:16.930 - 00:53:17.534, Speaker A: That's it.
00:53:17.572 - 00:53:18.720, Speaker D: I yield my time.
00:53:19.730 - 00:53:20.960, Speaker A: Just give me the.
00:53:23.890 - 00:53:30.690, Speaker B: To. I gotta give that one to Kevin. Give that one to Kevin.
00:53:32.070 - 00:53:33.294, Speaker D: Getting destroyed.
00:53:33.422 - 00:53:34.994, Speaker A: We're talking about on the board.
00:53:35.192 - 00:53:53.658, Speaker B: We're talking about culture here. I love his. You pulled an ens, that was super strong. That's the NFT to have right now. Okay, this is a good one, David. Maybe you can get this one and you'll start us off. What's the most bullish, unexpected thing that could happen to ethereum this year? Make it up.
00:53:53.658 - 00:53:57.050, Speaker B: Make it up. You got 30 seconds.
00:53:57.790 - 00:54:29.430, Speaker A: Shit. The Federal Reserve starts to tap into DFI to get yield on their dollars and bonds actually start pumping because the yield on the dollars are so strong because of defi. And for some reason there's enough demand, it triggers actually a demand loop because the Federal Reserve is getting yield in Defi. All of a sudden, DeFi is legitimized and the Federal Reserve actually fixes its balance sheet issues and bonds actually start appreciating and then bitcoin just drops to fucking zero because everyone realizes we don't need it anymore.
00:54:30.250 - 00:54:32.150, Speaker B: Wow. Straight bullet.
00:54:32.650 - 00:54:33.960, Speaker A: Just give him the point.
00:54:37.210 - 00:54:40.040, Speaker B: Okay, does anybody want to go next?
00:54:42.330 - 00:54:51.740, Speaker D: I was just going to say that if El Salvador removes BTC as legal tender and replaces it with Etha's legal tender, that's the most unexpected thing and the most bullish thing, I would think.
00:54:52.210 - 00:54:54.720, Speaker A: Happens right after my thing happens.
00:54:55.250 - 00:54:56.320, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
00:54:57.730 - 00:55:01.550, Speaker B: That's strong. Okay, Kevin awakey.
00:55:02.610 - 00:55:12.050, Speaker C: I think every new technology is pushed forward by pornography. And so I would like to see Spank chain get a ton of adoption, like Pornhub.
00:55:13.030 - 00:55:18.322, Speaker D: But you were going to say you're going to do something to lead this effort, Kevin, you are going with this.
00:55:18.456 - 00:55:21.766, Speaker C: I'm still holding my spank bag. My spank bags. Isn't that enough?
00:55:21.868 - 00:55:25.590, Speaker A: Spank was the only ico I actually invested in in 2017.
00:55:26.090 - 00:55:26.694, Speaker C: There you go.
00:55:26.732 - 00:55:28.050, Speaker A: I dumped my bags.
00:55:28.210 - 00:55:30.930, Speaker B: Metronome bro. What are you talking about? Metronome bro on the plane.
00:55:31.010 - 00:55:33.946, Speaker A: Oh, that's right. Well, no transaction, everyone.
00:55:34.048 - 00:55:34.940, Speaker C: Oh, God.
00:55:35.790 - 00:55:38.570, Speaker B: Okay, wrap it up for us. Defi dad.
00:55:39.390 - 00:56:18.710, Speaker E: Man, there's so many things that have already happened that I just never thought would. And I actually continue to be blown away by the billionaires that are chiming in who are very vocal about Ethereum being a potentially better investment or with more upside than don't. I don't have to imagine. Like, I think Carl icon having come out and I was joking around earlier about Mark Cuban, but Mark continues to be one of our best allies. So you got to pump that to the mainstream and help people start to dig into why we're legit. So, yeah, that's it.
00:56:18.780 - 00:56:25.414, Speaker B: I love the answer. All right, let's see what the chat has to say here. Anything chat.
00:56:25.462 - 00:56:27.660, Speaker A: Any opinions on who gets a point there.
00:56:28.750 - 00:56:29.722, Speaker B: Who gets that one?
00:56:29.776 - 00:56:33.818, Speaker D: I mean, I feel like we have to give a pity point to was.
00:56:33.824 - 00:56:35.610, Speaker A: A, that was at least in an entertainment.
00:56:36.910 - 00:56:38.170, Speaker E: It was a creative.
00:56:40.190 - 00:56:43.098, Speaker B: Guy. Thanks. Crowdsourced.
00:56:43.274 - 00:56:44.800, Speaker A: Dave's not getting left behind.
00:56:46.710 - 00:56:59.890, Speaker B: All right, here's the next one and the last one. Who is crypto person of the year? Who is crypto person of the year? And let's start with dad.
00:57:00.470 - 00:57:35.086, Speaker E: God, man, that's so hard. I have too many people I want to call out. Would Kevin Awwocke? I believe that we would still have been in a bear market if it weren't for and, and the quadratic funding and just all the work that you guys did. So it might, you know, I'm leaving out some other obvious folks, but I cannot thank Gitcoin enough. So you, my man. You are my person of the year.
00:57:35.188 - 00:57:36.234, Speaker B: Nice, Kevin.
00:57:36.282 - 00:57:41.566, Speaker A: You made a proud, proud, proud dad.
00:57:41.758 - 00:57:47.700, Speaker C: Quadratic funding, I have to say, is not my idea. We're just standing on the shoulders of giants. But thanks. That's very nice of you.
00:57:48.070 - 00:57:56.070, Speaker B: He quoted that from another podcast on the Bankless podcast. Kevin, why don't you go next and you don't have to pick Defi dad.
00:57:57.530 - 00:57:59.320, Speaker E: But if you don't, it would be.
00:58:03.370 - 00:58:41.330, Speaker C: Man, crypto person of the year other than Defi dad. Oh, man, this is such a hard decision. I guess it's not this year, but I've just really loved watching sushi swap and the vampire attack and so Xerox maki just for the reasons of, like, he's so horrible. But the fireworks were amazing. I guess that was in the last twelve months, but maybe not in 2021. Chef nomi. Yeah.
00:58:41.860 - 00:58:45.360, Speaker E: To clarify, if anyone heard that, it's no me. Bad.
00:58:45.510 - 00:58:46.880, Speaker B: Xerox Mackie.
00:58:47.540 - 00:58:49.148, Speaker A: We like Xerox Mackie.
00:58:49.244 - 00:58:53.284, Speaker B: Yeah. Perfect. All right, chef nomi then.
00:58:53.322 - 00:59:26.030, Speaker D: Yeah, man, this is like the hardest question ever. But if I had to just think of something off top of my head that basically has caused euphoria and divide and just like pure shit posting all the time. And it's DJ Sparta because he has managed to piss off absolutely everyone and then no bout while sitting on massive bags that he dumped at the top. So yeah, it has to go to him. For someone who's just like fun to, I mean, if you just take him non seriously, just take him as a joke and a shit poster with a lot of actual alpha sprinkled in, he's a fun guy.
00:59:26.640 - 00:59:31.608, Speaker B: Super choice there, David. If you don't pick the person I think you're going to pick, go ahead, dude.
00:59:31.704 - 01:00:05.224, Speaker A: I actually DM'd and Michael to say, make me go next, because I knew I thought Sazel was going to rug me, but he didn't. But Justin Drake is the absolute crypto person of the year. There's like a thousand people on Twitter that have the bat signal ultrasound money emojis in their names. The ultrasound money meme just skyrocketed into public consciousness. It's the first successful meme that just made it all the way to CNBC. It went from the Bankless podcast to CNBC in like, two months or even less, like six weeks. And it was older than that.
01:00:05.224 - 01:00:16.110, Speaker A: But it wasn't until the bankless podcast where the ultrasound money meme became what it was. And yeah, Justin Drake just completely changed the game with the narrative around Ethereum. Crypto person of the year.
01:00:16.960 - 01:00:18.792, Speaker B: Wow, that's a great choice.
01:00:18.936 - 01:00:23.132, Speaker D: I think the points got to go to David for that. That's a dope choice.
01:00:23.196 - 01:00:30.530, Speaker A: Yeah, I thought Sazzle, I was just on the edge of my seat, like, ready for Sazzle to say ultra. This show's fucking over.
01:00:31.300 - 01:00:35.428, Speaker D: Just give us all the points. Like, fuck it.
01:00:35.514 - 01:00:36.870, Speaker B: Yeah, let's just.
01:00:39.160 - 01:00:45.940, Speaker C: Inflation. These points are going. They're getting inflated. All right, David, we're going to fight to the death for the ultimate championship.
01:00:46.020 - 01:00:48.040, Speaker A: Oh, shit. Do we need a tiebreaker?
01:00:48.620 - 01:00:54.090, Speaker B: Yeah, what's the tiebreaker, Dave or sass? Anybody have a tiebreaker? I wasn't ready for this.
01:00:56.220 - 01:00:58.396, Speaker A: You guys are the hardest. I'm going to rug you until you.
01:00:58.418 - 01:00:59.630, Speaker D: Have to come with that.
01:01:01.360 - 01:01:04.968, Speaker A: I think Kevin just gets invited back for the death.
01:01:05.144 - 01:01:06.732, Speaker B: I think Kevin gets the win.
01:01:06.866 - 01:01:11.710, Speaker C: I'll be like, that guy won jeopardy. Who won several of them, but, like, way less.
01:01:12.400 - 01:01:24.740, Speaker B: Oh, what's his name? Won the most money, but was like, is not or not the James. Yeah, I know what you're talking about. Okay, can we pin Kevin while he gets his 30 seconds?
01:01:25.160 - 01:01:26.150, Speaker A: Yeah, sure.
01:01:26.920 - 01:01:32.736, Speaker B: All right, go ahead and take 30 seconds to talk about whatever you want. You have the spotlight on you. Go ahead, Kevin.
01:01:32.928 - 01:01:42.650, Speaker C: Oh, man. I would have planned something if I had known I was going to get a 32nd monologue. Open source is good. Let's regen all the dgens. Public goods are good.
01:01:46.540 - 01:01:49.390, Speaker D: Round ten is still on. If you haven't done it yet, go do so.
01:01:50.800 - 01:01:58.460, Speaker C: I should talk my own book fund, open source on Gitcoin grants until Thursday night at midnight.
01:01:58.800 - 01:02:00.348, Speaker B: Three, two, one. Nice.
01:02:00.434 - 01:02:09.200, Speaker C: All right, guys, I don't have to show Gitcoin grants because you all do it for me on Twitter all the time, so I've forgotten I'm out of practice.
01:02:09.620 - 01:02:26.192, Speaker B: All right, Dave, that wraps up the portion for our guests today. I hope everybody enjoyed their time on the top Signal show today guest wise. And thank you for participating in what was a very experimental show in the crypto world especially. What do you have to say, dave?
01:02:26.256 - 01:02:49.552, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks, everyone for being here. Like Mike said, this is an experiment. We're kind of flying by the seat of our pants. But because cryptoculture is tight and because we brought on really awesome guests, it's going to be a fun show no matter what. So, Kevin Awakey, Anthony Cesano, Defi dad, thanks for being our first guest on this first experimental show. And I hope things only go up from here until we reach the top.
01:02:49.686 - 01:02:59.216, Speaker E: Because it's this top, guys. Where is Kobe and ledger status, though? Thanks for having us, guys.
01:02:59.238 - 01:03:01.730, Speaker B: It was really fun. Bye, guys.
01:03:02.580 - 01:03:18.616, Speaker A: All right, guys, let us know what you think. Both you guys, the guests, and also people, the viewers and listeners, let us know what worked, what didn't work. We want to improve and refine this. We have some infrastructure coming. I'm going to have some dj stuff or some sound effects. We're going to get more creative here. This was pretty bare bones, but at least we know we can do it.
01:03:18.616 - 01:03:23.720, Speaker A: So once again, thanks, everyone for joining top signal and we will be back with episode two later.
01:03:23.790 - 01:03:27.770, Speaker B: We had fun because we have sponsors. Thank you for those. Thank you.
01:03:29.820 - 01:03:30.310, Speaker A: Peace, everyone.
