00:00:01.690 - 00:00:38.434, Speaker A: Bankless Nation. We've got another segment for you, something special today, something different, something I guess we need to talk about. We had a regular state of the nation planned, but events overtook it once again. It's been the story of the last three weeks. I think what people want to know in today's episode is what's happening with Genesis, this large institutional crypto lender. Is this the next domino to fall? If that happens, what happens next? And then higher level. As David was pitching me this episode, I don't know if you guys have ever seen that picture of Charlie from Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and he's got like, let me share the picture.
00:00:38.434 - 00:01:18.390, Speaker A: As I'm talking, he's like in front of some kind of a board, like a half crazed detective. This is David coming into this episode. All right, because I think David, you feel like this has linked this last series of events with Genesis, has linked a whole series of things in your mind and is helpful to explaining for you to explain what happened. Everything last two years in crypto, everything. I mean, the question is like, I'm coming to this episode and David's like, yo, I think the last two years, solid twelve to 18 months at least, have been a ginormous Ponzi game.
00:01:18.460 - 00:01:23.538, Speaker B: Dude, the whole 2021 bull market was a gigantic Ponzi scheme.
00:01:23.634 - 00:01:29.634, Speaker A: Can you make the Charlie face? The whole thing, dude, that's going on a thumbnail.
00:01:29.682 - 00:02:00.206, Speaker B: The whole thing. The whole thing was a Ponzi scheme. And now we're at the end. It's completely unraveled. And now we're at the final conclusion. And so I was going to make a show about all right, is Genesis insolvent? What's going on with Grayscale? What's going on with Barry Silver and Digital Currency Group? And answering that question, what's going on in the last seven days has been the final puzzle piece that fits over the broad category of 2022. Contagion.
00:02:00.206 - 00:02:05.086, Speaker B: Contagion. Contagion. Why was there so much contagion? We now know we have all the answers.
00:02:05.118 - 00:02:07.106, Speaker A: The good news, I think we have.
00:02:07.128 - 00:02:08.718, Speaker B: All of the answers.
00:02:08.814 - 00:02:40.234, Speaker A: If you had any question coming to today's episode, you'll leave with the answer to your question. But really, I think we're going to walk through it. We're going to end with the last domino we hope is one of the last dominoes to fall, which is Genesis Digital Currency Group. What's going on with kind of it even ties into retail products like Gemini Earn. People still have funds stuck on that. What's going to happen to all that? We end with that. But in order to explain that, we're going to take you through 2021, 2022, and the series of dominoes that led to this final domino falling.
00:02:40.234 - 00:03:22.794, Speaker A: So this is going to be an interesting episode. And guys, I just got it. I looked over some of David's notes real quick coming into this, but at some level, I'm along for the ride with you, too, all right? Because I think David's going to unpack his brain. And I'm just here asking questions. Before we get in, want to tell you about our friends and sponsors at Consensus, more specifically at Infiora. If we're going to rebuild crypto, which we absolutely are going to do, we have to build it on decentralized infrastructure. And Infjiora is an Ethereum infrastructure provider that is doing God's work to make sure that all of our DeFi tools load in the pages and in the ways they're supposed to load.
00:03:22.794 - 00:03:37.838, Speaker A: They are taking steps to further decentralize this infrastructure as well. And they wanted us to let you know that there's an opportunity to find out more about what they're doing. David, take it from here. What does Infura want to communicate to the Bankless nation?
00:03:37.934 - 00:04:08.186, Speaker B: Yeah, so Infuria has been this critical infrastructure provider for all of Ethereum, like running a node. If you just want to easily build something, you would just plug into Infuria in order to access Ethereum. Well, they themselves want to decentralize their own stack. So they want you to help them foster a brand new decentralized infrastructure ecosystem. And so we can get this journey done. We need all these people. We need more people to come and help Inferra in this role of decentralizing themselves.
00:04:08.186 - 00:04:18.110, Speaker B: So there is a link in the show notes so you can plug into the Infura stack as an independent infrastructure provider so we can decentralize a core piece of Ethereum.
00:04:19.010 - 00:05:05.390, Speaker A: Good stuff there. All right, let's talk about the high level of the episode that we're about to get into, kind of the daisy chain of events. And I'm going to bring up a tweet from Barry Silbert, who is kind of, I bet, the first player in this story, but also one of the last players of this story. Why did you want us to look at this Tweet? And this is from June 24, 2021, a tweet from Barry Silbert, who, of course, we'll introduce the actors in a little bit, but he is the leader of digital currency group Genesis. What else, David? I guess I'm going to bring up the GDBC and the ETH trust that people can buy in their retirement accounts. What is Barry saying here and why is this relevant to the story?
00:05:05.460 - 00:05:41.242, Speaker B: Yeah, so this was June 24, 2021, which, if you remember, was this first big crash in Crypto. After a meteoric rise of basically all crypto asset prices, ether hit $4,300. Bitcoin hit like $60,000. And then in one or two days, we lost like 50% to 60% of the crypto market cap. And then as the dust settled, the bull market actually resumed. Again, this was in the middle of 2021. And Barry Silbert tweets out there is a daisy chain of borrowers and lenders in the Crypto space, most well capitalized, but some are not.
00:05:41.242 - 00:05:59.470, Speaker B: Lots of leverage still in the ecosystem, including in some nonobvious places important to understand counterparty risk and where the weak links are in the chain. Now, this tweet was the indication of all things to come over the next.
00:05:59.540 - 00:06:04.770, Speaker A: It's foreshadowing to 18 months in our Shakespearean tragedy story. This is the foreshadowing.
00:06:05.190 - 00:06:38.218, Speaker B: This is foreshadowing. This was the tweet to pay attention to. At this to. No one really knew how to unpack these things because all of these were centralized lenders. So it was a black box, so we didn't have that information. But this tweet became true in fantastic fashion. And the irony, Ryan, is that Barry Silbert tweeted it and that daisy chain of borrowers and lenders has come full circle back to his own trading desk, Genesis, which is part of his company digital currency group.
00:06:38.218 - 00:06:41.638, Speaker B: Okay, the full circle nature of this story is absolutely insane.
00:06:41.734 - 00:07:11.522, Speaker A: Back to Barry. This is where the story starts. This is where it's actually going to end when we get into it. I'm going to pull out a few phrases here. Daisy chain of borrowers and lenders, he says most well capitalized, some aren't. Lots of leverage, he says important to understand counterparty risk and where the weak links are in the chain. What do we have here, David? This is a diagram I think you put together for this episode and maybe is kind of the different sections.
00:07:11.522 - 00:07:14.694, Speaker A: All of these layers maybe represent domino's. Explain this for us.
00:07:14.732 - 00:07:20.790, Speaker B: Okay, so I stayed up, like, late last night because I was going down this rabbit hole. So I made this pyramid. Brian.
00:07:20.870 - 00:07:22.330, Speaker A: Happy Thanksgiving, by the way.
00:07:22.480 - 00:07:57.282, Speaker B: This was the 2021 bull market. The 2017 bull market was determined by ICOs printing tokens out of thin air to fundraise, and they would buy Ether and USCC. And it was a bunch of printing tokens out of thin air. And that's what the ICO mania was. I regret to inform you, Ryan, that the 2021 bull market was the same damn thing. We had these yield farming DFI yield farming, pool twos. Remember pool twos with, like, 500% APYs if you were willing to take the risk of other yield farmers to dump on you.
00:07:57.282 - 00:08:29.834, Speaker B: So, like, pool twos with incentivized APYs, and farmers would play chicken after everyone would want it to farm. And that was like crazy. 100% to 1000% APYs that rested on top of the pool ones where it was lower risk. You weren't providing liquidity, you were just incentivized to stake your tokens. Whether it's like, whatever DFI yield farm, you would just stake your tokens and you get a yield. You didn't really have to have as much risk. Moderate ten to 90% APYs, that was the top of the pyramid.
00:08:29.882 - 00:08:31.354, Speaker A: That was DFI summer.
00:08:31.402 - 00:08:39.650, Speaker B: That was DFI summer. And then Salana, Avalanche, Phantom, that was their game as well, after Ethereum took it over.
00:08:39.720 - 00:09:02.842, Speaker A: Okay, hold on, hold on. You're saying top of the pyramid, but actually, the way you're describing it, I almost think that this pyramid should be flipped on its head. Do you know what I mean? So the top should be kind of like the weakest part, but that's where it really starts, right? It's like pool twos and pool ones. The DFI summer is actually kind of like the start of the pyramid and what the full 2021 bull market builds into. Is that right?
00:09:02.896 - 00:09:33.822, Speaker B: Sure, it depends on your perspective. Okay. What we are looking at here is a risk spectrum as well, where if you are at the top of the pyramid, you are on the highest end of the risk curve. You are the things with the most APYs, with the most risk, and then the risk actually gets lower as you go down. Which is why perceived risk gets lower. No, the real risk, this is why people are concerned about Genesis and Digital Currency Group because they are the foundation of all yield. All that yield, all that crazy speculation all fell down at the end of the day to Genesis.
00:09:33.822 - 00:10:12.910, Speaker B: And that's why we are talking about Genesis today, and why we feel, I feel confident that this is like the last big domino to fall. Okay, so pool twos, pool Twos and DeFi yield farms were supported by pool Ones. Pool ones which were the basic yield farm. That's where Alameda and Three Zeros Capital got a lot of their money. In the second half of the bull market, hedge funds maxed out lines of credit from anyone that would allow them to borrow from them. This is what Alameda and three years capital did. And this is where so much contagion came from because 3 Hours Capital and Alameda borrowed from as many different lending desks as possible, BlockFi Voyager Celsius.
00:10:12.910 - 00:10:52.582, Speaker B: And then when 3 Hours Capital and Alameda went under, they took all the lending desks with them except for Alameda and FTX found a way to print a bunch of FTT to support all the lending desks. But ultimately all of that money, all the capital to block Five Voyager Celsius. Where were they getting their yield? They were getting their yield from Genesis, the GBTC, Arbitrage, and ultimately the whole entire Digital Currency Group system. And that, Ryan, was the 2021 bull market. All of these high risk yield farms ultimately was supported by the largest player in the game, which was Genesis and also the arbitrage for the Grayscale premium.
00:10:52.646 - 00:11:10.674, Speaker A: So you're telling me everything that happened in 2021, all of the price appreciation that we've now by the way, walked back and reset was just smoke and mirrors, was almost like a Ponzi scheme of stacking risk and stacking interest that wasn't really real?
00:11:10.792 - 00:11:45.198, Speaker B: Yes, and it was all in. The whole reason why this whole thing worked was because we were able to print tokens out of thin air, which is the way that every single crypto bull run has gone since its so like you want to go to then click on that tweet. Remember this tweet that caused a bunch of crypto Twitter murmurings because this was the one that Richard hart responded to Richard Hart like, I tweeted out, okay, 3 hours. Capital is insolvent. Alameda is liquidated, FTX is insolvent. If all these people are insolvent, I ask, then who made all the money? Richard Hart comes in like, hello there. It was me.
00:11:45.198 - 00:12:31.654, Speaker B: Well, it wasn't him, Ryan. The actual answer is the next tweet. The actual answer is this guy who used this illustration of a neighborhood with 100 houses and has one sale for a million dollars. Therefore, the collective houses are worth $100 million, but then the remaining 99 houses only sell for 10% of that. So actually, $91 million of equity is actually gone. This is what happens when all these eliquid shitcoins, all the DFI yield, farming, all of the degeneracy high APY, pool one and pool twos, when all of those tokens go down in price, the entire system gets wiped out because of all of the systemic risk that got built up by players like Three errors capital and Alameda. And so that's what happened, Ryan.
00:12:31.654 - 00:12:34.970, Speaker B: That's where the money went. We printed all these bitcoin.
00:12:35.650 - 00:12:51.954, Speaker A: The money was just not real. It was just money was not real fabrication. It was just numbers on a and there there may have been some people, by the way, that cashed out close to the top based on those valuations. Few people walked away with some amount of money. But what you're saying is the price.
00:12:51.992 - 00:12:53.630, Speaker B: Of they walked away with bitcoin, Ether.
00:12:53.710 - 00:12:58.062, Speaker A: USDC, the real monies, like hard monies.
00:12:58.126 - 00:12:58.740, Speaker B: Yes.
00:12:59.050 - 00:13:36.994, Speaker A: And left everyone else kind of holding the bag. And that's where we are. So now here we are. Genesis has what's reported to be like a $1 billion hole. People are now worried about the solvency of Grayscale and Digital Currency Group empire. We're going to talk about that and when we get back, david, I want you to walk us through this whole story, if you could. I think we just saw the preamble, if you will, and I think what we're going to go through is show you domino by domino, how these pieces were stacked and what caused their fall and what's going to happen next.
00:13:36.994 - 00:13:43.700, Speaker A: So, guys, stick with us. We'll be right back. But first, we want to tell you about the fantastic sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:13:44.390 - 00:14:37.666, Speaker B: Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web three landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems. With a recent addition of arbitram nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home. Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees. With arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro, it's also now ten times faster than before. Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum experience Web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap and friction free.
00:14:37.666 - 00:15:21.858, Speaker B: The Brave Wallet is your secure multitrain onramp into Web Three and is built directly into the Brave privacy browser. Gone are the days of managing multiple wallet extensions that put you at risk of phishing, spooks and tracking. With the Brave Wallet, you can securely manage your crypto assets across more than 100 different chains, including Ethereum, Layer Twos, Salana and more, all without downloading risky extensions. The Brave Wallet is easy to set up and removes the headache of jumping between wallets and extensions. It's lightweight, but packed with great features like built in token swaps, buying and holding NFTs with a gallery view and support for hardware wallets. But also much more than that, because Brave is shipping new features every single month with a mission to make Web Three easier to navigate. For its over 55 million users, wallet extensions are a thing of the past.
00:15:21.858 - 00:16:02.122, Speaker B: So get started with Brave's Web Three ready browser today and experience a decentralized web seamlessly without all the clutter. You can download the browser@brave.com bankless and click the wallet icon to get started. If you've been listening to Bankless, you know that we're fans of the modular Blockchain thesis the idea that Blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus, allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves. And Fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry. By supporting parallel transaction execution, Fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the Web Three world. Fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the EVM with its own Fuel VM, which is more efficient and optimized, opening up the design space for developers.
00:16:02.122 - 00:16:24.018, Speaker B: And lastly, Fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain specific language Sway, and a supportive tool chain called Fork. With Fuel, you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like Solidity while adopting the improvements made by the Rust tooling ecosystem, letting the Fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the EVM. If you want to learn more, there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a Fuel network.
00:16:24.114 - 00:17:16.790, Speaker A: Was the 2021 Bull market just a gigantic Ponzi scheme in crypto? That is the central question we're raising in today's episode, and David has brought some of the receipts going to take us through the timeline here, all the way back in January 2021, when this Shakespearean tragedy started to first unfold. I think in order to set this story up, David, and do it justice, we should do a couple of things. First, we should set the stage where we were in January 2021 the feeling of the market, the prices, that sort of thing. And then we should talk about the key players as any good. I guess tragedy does. We have to lay out the background and the actors and the players, the characters that are going to be in this that are somewhat reoccurring as well. So let's talk about where we were.
00:17:16.790 - 00:17:47.246, Speaker A: And I remember it actually coming out of December 2020. ETH was low in December 2020. We had a show four to, we had a show that was kind of like the bullcase for ETH. And what was really interesting is DFI had had its moment back the previous summer. This was a summer that came to be known as DFI summer. This is summer of 2021 where people realized that DFI tokens were real things. Previous to that, all tokens were kind of dead.
00:17:47.246 - 00:18:25.866, Speaker A: There was bitcoin and there was a little bit of ETH, but then all of the other tokens, nothing mattered. DFI summer 2020 showed people that no tokens did matter. And talk about yield farming, that sort of thing, but ETH was still kind of lingering in the 400s. Bitcoin had seen a moment and there was this move of to say, all we need is bitcoin and DFI tokens, and there's no real use case for ETH. So ETH had not yet popped at the end of December 2020. So take us back to that feeling as we start this story in December. In January 2021, what had the market done with DFI? What was the price of bitcoin? What was the price of ETH?
00:18:25.978 - 00:19:08.870, Speaker B: Yeah, so at the time, DFI summer compound really announced the governance token, and that was the new primitive that everyone was super stoked about. This is how we're going to decentralize ownership and control over these systems to as many people as possible. That was the shiny new object that really incurred DeFi summer and the concept of yield farming to begin with. Like I said at the beginning, yield farming, liquidity mining was this era's ICO. Before the ICO era, there was the proof of work fork and fair launch phenomenon, which, like, almost zero tokens made it through. So this 2013 bull market was the proof of work fork and fair launch. We just made a bunch of tokens.
00:19:08.870 - 00:19:53.260, Speaker B: 2017 bull market was the ICO mania, where we just made a bunch of tokens. The 2021 bull market, Ryan, was the DFI yield summing era where we made a bunch of tokens, this time with yield. This was the thing yield was the thing that identified the 2021 bull market, not just at the very high risk end of the spectrum, but down all the way into how regular institutions got involved in crypto. And why they got involved is because there was demand to borrow assets. And this is the story of how everything got built up and how everything fell apart. So if we're injecting ourselves into this story in January of 2021, which is kind of when the story starts, ether began January at about $900. It ended January at one $700.
00:19:53.260 - 00:20:06.800, Speaker B: Bitcoin started January around 2520 $5,000. It ended that January somewhere around $35. To $40,000. And so it's on. The bull market is on 2021.
00:20:07.170 - 00:20:22.530, Speaker A: People felt like the bull market was fully on, and they were also hungry. I feel like maybe we could start to inject terms like greedy. And they were certainly hungry for more yield. Things were frothy, like, oh, let's do that 2020 DFI Summer thing again.
00:20:22.600 - 00:20:24.626, Speaker B: That felt great. Let's do it all over again.
00:20:24.728 - 00:20:51.978, Speaker A: Yeah. And this starts to inject, I think this idea that we've seen in many cycles, David, is the concept of a metaphor we call the Euthanasia roller coaster. This is a picture of the Euthanasia roller coaster. And it's a theoretical construct, but the physics of it would actually work. And basically, you start the roller coaster, and by the end of it, after all of the loops, you're kind of dead. It's just been a one way ride. There's no life left in you.
00:20:51.978 - 00:20:59.710, Speaker A: But each of these loops describe this in some more detail and where's the analogy fit, because we've seen this in previous cycles as well.
00:20:59.780 - 00:21:24.018, Speaker B: Yeah. So, again, proof of work. Fork and fair launch. What happened? Somebody, Charlie Lee, made Litecoin by forking bitcoin, and that created a billion dollars in market cap. People saw that and they did that on repeat. They did that over again. Another loop like, oh, that worked for Charlie with Litecoin, let's make 17 other forks, and then let's make 17 forks of that fork.
00:21:24.018 - 00:21:53.658, Speaker B: Eventually, it created a mania. And then eventually people got fatigued and people just got done. And so they left the bull market. Same thing with ICOs. What was the great big ICO that triggered the 2015 ICO mania? It was the 2015 Ethereum ICO, followed by the very successful 2016 Auger ICO. And all of a sudden, people realized that they could do ICOs to mint tokens, and that would generate a bunch of hype, and that's how you could do things. So it started off legit.
00:21:53.658 - 00:22:24.534, Speaker B: It ended in tragedy. And so as the ICO mania went on, ICOs got the loops got faster and faster and faster until people just got fatigued. These things were just way too scammy. Retail investors just lost all their money, and no new inflows of money came into the system. And then we had a bear market. This was, of course, DeFi Summer. The first OG yield farm, the first liquidity mining event was compound, followed by every other DeFi app that had yet to issue a token, followed by copycats on Ethereum.
00:22:24.534 - 00:22:46.098, Speaker B: Think about SushiSwap, which, I mean allegedly was sam bankman fried. And then we had avalanche. Solana phantom. All of these Ethereum killers show up and then start doing yield farms on their chains. And eventually people got fatigued. People stopped making money, and the energy ran out of the system. But this is the pattern of every single bull market so far.
00:22:46.264 - 00:23:20.934, Speaker A: The first few loops in the Euthanasia La coaster are fun, and the last couple actually kill you. That's how all bull cycles end, including this one. So we're going to talk about some of those loops. But as we get into this, the other thing to introduce is, I think, the players here, the reoccurring actors that are important, I want to talk about a few of them. First is the house of Barry Silbert. Okay? This is like the Montagues and the Capulets, right, in their Shakespearean tragedy, the House of Barry Silbert. So Barry has been a crypto OG from the very beginning of crypto.
00:23:20.934 - 00:23:51.046, Speaker A: I don't know, he might have been in crypto as long as like, Eric Voorhees and people like this early Bitcoin holder for sure. But he decided to go the institutional route behind things. So he formed this company called Digital Currency Group. There's a group within that called Genesis, which maybe can explain some details. Also, Grayscale, which is a trust type product, maybe you can explain that to us. And there are some other products he owns, including media. So like, CoinDesk is actually owned by Digital Currency Group.
00:23:51.046 - 00:23:55.634, Speaker A: So talk about the House of Silbert and who is Grayscale and who is Genesis.
00:23:55.762 - 00:24:38.854, Speaker B: So Grayscale is this trust that what allowed people to have Bitcoin exposure on the traditional stock market. If you didn't want to go and set up an exchange that maybe you didn't trust, maybe Coinbase is too sketchy for you because you are an institutional investor. You could just buy access, buy exposure to Bitcoin via the Grayscale Bitcoin trust. The thing is, it doesn't trade one for one. And so the GBTC share on the traditional stock markets are subject to market forces in the same way all assets are, even though that they are backed by Bitcoin, they do not represent a one to one redeemable share for Bitcoin. Why not? Because we aren't able to have a Bitcoin ETF. That an ETF would have solved this problem, but we don't have one of those.
00:24:38.854 - 00:25:09.290, Speaker B: So we have to have the next best thing, which is a Grayscale trust. There's the BTC trust, there's the Ether trust. There's a few other trusts, but the Bitcoin and Ether are the very big ones. So that's Grayscale, that is owned and operated by Digital Currency Group, which is where Barry stillbert started. Also part of Digital Currency group is Genesis. And Genesis is Crypto's only like full service prime brokerage. What is a brokerage? It's a Custodian, it's an OTC desk, it's a lending desk.
00:25:09.290 - 00:25:12.686, Speaker B: Basically all financial services, all under one roof.
00:25:12.868 - 00:25:25.554, Speaker A: It's like a Fidelity account or an E Trade account or Charles Schwab account, except for big institutions. Not for everyday users, not for mom and pops, not for retail, but for big institutions. It performs all of those services. Yes, correct.
00:25:25.752 - 00:25:47.942, Speaker B: And so these are the two big players. CoinDesk is also related here because they were actually the ones that published that Alameda report, but not really a key player here. But that's the house of Barry. Silbert. That's the House of Digital Currency group. Ryan, this story starts there. It also ends there because that is where the contagion has finally come home to roost, back to where this whole thing began.
00:25:47.942 - 00:26:19.458, Speaker B: But we'll get into how it began in a second because how it began was some players in this game. The next house we're going to talk about are the house of the Hedge Funds, three Years Capital, Alameda. Both came into fame in 2019, 2020. And these are the people that spread out all the contagion. They are the things that connect everything. Because of how this bull market progressed, they ultimately borrowed from whoever they could get their hands on money, that wherever they could get their money from, they would borrow and borrow and borrow. And they are the middlemen of all the contagion.
00:26:19.458 - 00:26:28.780, Speaker B: And so we'll get to that story as well. There's also, of course, the house of Do Kwan and Terra Luna, which probably started the casket, was probably the first domino to fall.
00:26:29.150 - 00:26:29.574, Speaker A: There's.
00:26:29.622 - 00:26:55.918, Speaker B: The ETH killers. I think you remember the acronym Soluna Vax, if you remember that. And then of course, there's the House of Sam bankman fried also Alameda FTX. And all of the Sam coins. FTT SRM. Solana and also ryan the last player in this game is the SEC and Gary Gensler, or what they chose to not do rather than do. So these are all the players, the.
00:26:55.924 - 00:27:37.034, Speaker A: House of the regulators, the cops on the beat. Okay, so we've got our players, we've got our background, people hungry for yield, traveling on that Euthanasia roller coaster. Take us to domino one right now. I think what we're going to do is we're going to lay out the major dominoes that haven't fallen yet, but that are being stacked in a row and they're being set up right now. So the first domino is back to December 31, basically January 2021, three Arrows Capital and the GDPC premium. Let's talk about this. And I think it begins with the SEC, our cop on the beat.
00:27:37.034 - 00:27:46.302, Speaker A: We're looking at an SEC filing for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust for this product called GDBC. Why are we looking at this? And why does our story start here?
00:27:46.356 - 00:28:10.874, Speaker B: So this is actually a filing by Three Arrows Capital at the start of 2021. And if you scroll down, you'll see that Three Arrows Capital is declaring that they have become an owner of 6.1% of the total GBTC supply. As in they own 6.1% of the trust. How did they get 6.1% of the GBTC trust?
00:28:10.992 - 00:28:12.220, Speaker A: They bought it, right?
00:28:12.910 - 00:28:38.066, Speaker B: They put up some money, okay, but not with Grayscale. They had some money. They had investors. 3 Hours Capital got investors somewhere. They probably put up some of their own money. And what did they do? They gave that money to Genesis as collateral to borrow Bitcoins because they could take those bitcoins. Because at this moment in time, Ryan, the GBTC, like I said, it.
00:28:38.066 - 00:29:14.286, Speaker B: Doesn't trade one to one. It's not equivalent to one bitcoin. It is at a premium or at a discount to bitcoin based off of the net present value of all the assets in the trust. And so for a long time, GBTC traded at a significant premium to actual bitcoin. And so what could you do? You could take one bitcoin, you could deposit it into the trust. Six months later, you could receive and redeem a GBTC share, which had a premium associated with it versus the bitcoin that you deposited, and then you could sell that premium and pocket that arbitrage. Okay, makes sense.
00:29:14.308 - 00:29:22.014, Speaker A: So far, this is an arbitrage opportunity for three years capital, and it seems like a riskless arbitrage opportunity, right, with.
00:29:22.052 - 00:29:22.734, Speaker B: Six months of time.
00:29:22.772 - 00:29:54.806, Speaker A: But yes, the context of this is 3 hours Capital just made a boatload of money in D Five Summer and all of the yield products and degenning away over there. And now they're like, where's our next hit going to come from? And they're seeing this big, juicy ARB opportunity in between the spot price of bitcoin and GBTC. And by the way, they're the only ones that can kind of access this. And when I say the only ones, I mean large institutions like Three Arrows Capital are the only ones because retail investors cannot buy this product from groups like Grayscale, OTC over the counter.
00:29:54.838 - 00:30:03.718, Speaker B: That is, they cannot produce this arbitrage. They can only buy GPTC on the secondary market. Right. They cannot mint new Gptcs.
00:30:03.814 - 00:30:14.206, Speaker A: Okay, so suzu Kyle Davies are like licking their lips. Here's another arbitrage opportunity. That's what our fund is set up to do, is make money through our capital. It goes in and buys 6% of.
00:30:14.228 - 00:30:51.258, Speaker B: This, but it's not like this coming in like ape into 6.1%. What do they do? They take whatever winnings they got throughout 2000 and 22,019, starting at February 2020. After the COVID crash, it was up only from there. So if you were in at February 2020, you're making money, especially DFI summer was probably the most lucrative time in the last, like, three years. So three Zero's Capital takes all their money and they gives it, again, not to Grayscale, but to Genesis. They put up their capital in Genesis as collateral, and they buy as many bitcoins as borrow as many bitcoins as possible, and they take it and they give it back to Grayscale to produce GP.
00:30:51.274 - 00:30:52.826, Speaker A: So they're buying this on margin.
00:30:53.018 - 00:31:59.826, Speaker B: They are borrowing bitcoins on margin from Genesis. However, the thing that is crazy is that Grayscale and Genesis, again, are both under Digital Currency Group. And so, hang on, let me open up a document to make sure I get this right. Since they are both owned by Digital Currency Group, there's this unique position that Genesis has because Genesis is like the only genesis is the only authorized participant, aka in Crypto native speak, the only party that can mint and burn shares of GBTC. So when Three Errors Capital borrows bitcoin from Genesis, they were actually giving it straight back around to Genesis because Genesis is the one that's minting GBTC in the first place. And so it's this very incestuous relationship between Genesis and Grayscale that is the linchpin of this whole thing. And why there's so much contagion because Genesis would do is they would just like, hey, Grayscale, come put up capital and then have this free arbitrage opportunity.
00:31:59.826 - 00:32:14.806, Speaker B: And why is Genesis incentivized for this? Well, when you can take and Genesis is like giving out people for depositing their bitcoins or giving them a yield, Gemini Earn, for example, if you come and deposit your bitcoin in, Gemini earn, gemini gives it to that's how it.
00:32:14.828 - 00:32:16.150, Speaker A: Flows down to retail.
00:32:17.770 - 00:32:48.894, Speaker B: So retail gives their bitcoins to Gemini earn. Gemini earn pays retail a yield. Gemini gives that bitcoin to Genesis. Genesis pays Gemini an earn, gemini takes a percentage, passes that onto retail. Genesis allows Three Arrows Capital to take that bitcoin and then convert it into GBTC through their sister subsidiary company, Grayscale. And the thing is, when that happens, grayscale takes 2.5% yearly fees of all assets under management.
00:32:48.894 - 00:33:42.754, Speaker B: And so there is this huge question as what are the incentives of Genesis? Why does Genesis think about this as a system, part of this overall system? It's digital currency group. Digital Currency Group makes more money the more assets are under Grayscale's management. So if Genesis can get all the bitcoins into Grayscale, that means revenue engine, right? And so all they have to do, all Genesis has to do is create this arbitrage opportunity that allows people like 3 hours capital to come in and arbitrage. And so they do. And so 3 hours capital milked the absolute f out of this premium. And so at some point in the early 2021, that premium, which is what we're looking at here, us all premium, and you can like all of that premium on the arbitrage opportunity is the arbitrage opportunity. At some point in very early 2021, it gets milked and the premium goes.
00:33:42.792 - 00:33:46.526, Speaker A: To a discount because everyone's doing the same trade.
00:33:46.558 - 00:34:19.742, Speaker B: Basically everyone's doing the same well, 3 hours capital is like leading this trade, but everyone starts to follow them because of how incredibly lucrative and profitable it was. It's actually a big problem when the premium goes to a discount because this was Ryan's, the original yield farm, the GBTC premium arbitrage opportunity was 3 hours capital yield farming as much possible out of this premium. And who is buying that on the other side? It's any retail investor or anyone who's buying GBTC on the other side of the trade. And so that is who 3 hours.
00:34:19.796 - 00:34:40.706, Speaker A: And they're doing it, retail is doing this because their money is generally stuck inside a retirement account, for instance, or some sort of locked institution that doesn't have access to Spot. This is not a real ETF type product. It's just a trust type product. So they kind of have to buy if they want to buy here. What are we looking at here, David?
00:34:40.738 - 00:35:18.620, Speaker B: What is this is well, this is the Barry Silbert that tweet that we talked about earlier. This is when after this week, we go from January to May and we have that first crash. And Barry Silbert starts to see why is Barry Silbert the one that has all this information about this daisy chain of borrowers? Because he created it digital currency group device. The creation of this daisy chain. That's why Barry Silbert can see it. And so when going back to the discount versus premium on the GBTC, this was the first domino to fall. But it actually didn't cause too many problems in that moment where all of the GBTC that through Aeros Capital and others that held as.
