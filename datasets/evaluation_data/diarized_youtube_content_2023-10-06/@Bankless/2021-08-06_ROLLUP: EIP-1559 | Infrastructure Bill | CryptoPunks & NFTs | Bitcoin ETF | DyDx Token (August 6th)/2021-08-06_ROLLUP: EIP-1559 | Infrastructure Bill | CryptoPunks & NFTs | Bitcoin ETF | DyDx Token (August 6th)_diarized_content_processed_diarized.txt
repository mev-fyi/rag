00:00:07.690 - 00:00:19.262, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation. Happy Friday to you. It is the first week of August, David. It's roll up time. This is the EIP 15 five nine edition. 1559. 1559.
00:00:19.262 - 00:00:30.930, Speaker A: However you say it, it is the day that we have deployed EIP 15 five nine. Actually, we will have deployed it one day after you guys are listening to this. David, that's pretty exciting. Dude, I'm pumped.
00:00:31.010 - 00:00:48.874, Speaker B: There is so much to talk about, and so I'm going to try and refrain from talking about it right now. But it has been a long time coming and the fact that Eip one five nine is here and we have things to talk about that it's actually live is just absolutely stellar. And I'm really stoked to get into the weekly roll up this week.
00:00:48.992 - 00:00:55.870, Speaker A: Okay? Yeah. Do not drink a swig of coffee every time you hear EIP 15 five nine or you will be coffee drunk by the end of the episode.
00:00:56.210 - 00:01:38.922, Speaker B: Before we get into the show, we got to talk about pool together because it is summertime and it's all time to get into the pool. If you don't know pool together, it is a no loss lottery, which means you put your stablecoins, your comp tokens, whatever tokens that pool together accepts into a pool, and then you have a chance to win the accrued interest that accrues weekly from everyone's collective funds. So you don't lose your principal, you might lose your opportunity cost of money, but you also might win everyone else's interest as well. It's a fun no loss lottery on Ethereum. Every single week, roughly 50,000 thousand $60 gets awarded in USDC. And that is just the USDC pool. There is usually a drawing every single day of the week.
00:01:38.922 - 00:01:56.394, Speaker B: They have also recently deployed their Polygon implementation where you can deposit TUSD tether into the polygon pool together pool. And they are also rolling out their l two s coming soon in the future. So check them out. There's a link in the show notes so you can have fun in the pool.
00:01:56.522 - 00:02:11.062, Speaker A: That's a lot of pool time, guys. If you haven't yet tried many DFI apps, this is one to try and tell your friends. Super easy to use, and you can't lose. It's a lotto. You can't lose. So check that out, guys. All right, David, you ready to get into bitcoin markets, my friend?
00:02:11.116 - 00:02:27.270, Speaker B: Yeah, let's do it. Bitcoin is down on the week starting at the high prices of roughly $42,000. Touched the low price of just below $38,000. To where we are currently at right now at $39,300 for one bitcoin.
00:02:27.430 - 00:02:29.626, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about ETH price.
00:02:29.808 - 00:02:58.530, Speaker B: ETH price doing a little bit of the opposite. Started at right around $2,500 on the week, and that was roughly about the low. And it is currently at the high price of roughly $2,800. Feels like it's pumping on the news of EIP 1559 finally going live, which is always kind of funny to me because there's no way you've been able to pay attention to Ethereum without understanding EIP 1559. We talk about it all the time and now it's live and now people are buying.
00:02:58.690 - 00:02:59.362, Speaker A: Weird.
00:02:59.506 - 00:02:59.814, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:59.852 - 00:03:12.700, Speaker A: Why did you wait so long? People who just bought EIp bought ETH after EIP 15, five, nine. Why do they wait? Do you think there's some worry that maybe it wouldn't ship, maybe the hard fork wouldn't go right?
00:03:13.870 - 00:03:18.250, Speaker B: I have no clue, man, but I know I wasn't waiting.
00:03:19.950 - 00:03:31.838, Speaker A: We knew this was coming, guys. We also know the merge is coming on the horizon, too, so that'll be another catalyst in the future. We'll get to a bit more of that later, but let's review some more metrics. So ETH bitcoin ratio. How's the ETH ratio doing?
00:03:31.924 - 00:04:11.146, Speaker B: Yeah, listeners will remember last week that we talked about how there was a descending wedge, if you want to use again, trader terminology, which I'm not very good at using trader terminology, but I'm going to do it anyways. There was a descending wedge that Ether looked like it broke out of versus bitcoin. And turns out that that continuation just happened even further this week. Ether is above zero seven ETH per BTC at the price of 0712. Looking really, really strong. There's a lot of traders that I know, a lot of people that are looking at the ETH BTC ratio looking like, oh, man, it just looks like it's going to resume going higher versus bitcoin. Back to the highs of maybe 0.1
00:04:11.146 - 00:04:19.646, Speaker B: ETH versus BTC. Just speculation here, but ETH BTC looking really strong, as you would expect during EIP 1559 week.
00:04:19.748 - 00:04:31.406, Speaker A: Yeah. Also not surprising given these ETH tailwinds. Right. These ETH catalysts. Let's talk about total value locked in DFI. That is also up on the week. I remember hanging in the 50 to 60 billion range.
00:04:31.406 - 00:04:33.070, Speaker A: Now we're at 70 billion.
00:04:33.150 - 00:04:52.630, Speaker B: Yeah. That is the theme of markets this week, at least on the ethereum side of things is up. It's really nice to see that seven number leading a total locked value back in DFI. I remember, I think the peak that we set back in May was just around 90 billion locked in DFI. We are back up to 70 billion locked in DFI.
00:04:52.790 - 00:05:03.786, Speaker A: All right, let's take a look at the dpIs. This is the DFI pulse index. This tracks some of the top DFI tokens in crypto. To give you a sense of that, we are up on the week as well, David.
00:05:03.898 - 00:05:15.594, Speaker B: 18% on the week, 18% green for DPI at the price of $362, which is the local high for the week. So congratulations to DPI holders.
00:05:15.722 - 00:05:25.700, Speaker A: Okay, well, it seems to be ETH season over bitcoin season. That's what that ratio is telling us. But is it DFI season? David, what are we looking at? Oh, are we below your amount? We're below your number.
00:05:26.870 - 00:05:39.250, Speaker B: Horseshoes, hand grenades. Like, we're around my number. We are currently at zero point 128 ETH DPI ratio, which means that it is ETH season, not necessarily DFI season.
00:05:39.410 - 00:05:58.494, Speaker A: I'm okay with that. Give DFI a breather for a bit. Okay, let's talk about the bed index. So, the bed index, of course, composes all of these assets together. You get one third bitcoin, one third ETH, one third DPI, all in one token that you have to hold. That is up on the week, because all three of those assets are up on the week. Where are we right now?
00:05:58.612 - 00:06:18.500, Speaker B: We are up 10% on the week. Bed started at $113, and we are currently at $130. So that is the summary of the crypto markets at large. Up 10% on the week. Again, the bet index, the best DFI crypto index that there ever will be, I'm pretty sure.
00:06:18.810 - 00:06:30.130, Speaker A: Tell your friends, guys. Easiest way to get exposure to crypto, at least the premium assets. At least the assets you want to be part of on the bankless journey. David, let's talk man Eip.
00:06:30.210 - 00:06:35.210, Speaker B: What do you want to talk about, Ryan? Look, do we have something to talk about?
00:06:35.280 - 00:06:43.962, Speaker A: I know you flew all the way to San Diego last night, but you woke up early in the morning to be available for this. It was like, what, 05:00 your time?
00:06:44.016 - 00:06:55.342, Speaker B: Yeah. Woke up at 430 because Eric Connor and Anthony Suzanne was like, why isn't the zoom up yet? I'm like, an hour before the fork. I guess they were really excited to get the live stream up and running. Yeah.
00:06:55.396 - 00:07:31.674, Speaker A: Kids in front of the Christmas tree, just, like, waiting for Santa to come down the chimney. I mean, they were really excited about this, but we're excited too. So EIP 15 five nine got deployed today as part of the London hard Fork for Ethereum. This is a massive event. There are a slew of other feature updates in that, but EIP 15 five nine was the one we've all been waiting for. That means a number of things, but one thing it definitely means is we are burning etH. Effective 830 or so eastern time this morning, we have started burning ETH, and we will continue to burn EtH until maybe the end of the Ethereum network.
00:07:31.674 - 00:07:54.798, Speaker A: Like, this is going to last into the future upgrades and has become a core part of the protocol. And David, there are so many dashboards where you can see Eth getting burnt in real time that I've become addicted to these things. So, like, here's one. Etherchain orgburn we can see, look, man, almost 800 ETH burnt.
00:07:54.894 - 00:08:03.526, Speaker B: And we are only like four and a half hours into this. 800 Eth in four and a half hours burnt, gone.
00:08:03.628 - 00:08:14.522, Speaker A: And remind folks, why is Eth getting burnt? When people are asking the question that seems weird, why are you burning Eth? Are you wasting it? Why is this a good thing? Why are you so excited about burning money?
00:08:14.656 - 00:09:08.630, Speaker B: Yeah, so here is like a kind of a 400 level bankless content take is that if you listen to our podcast with Vitalik Butyrin on legitimacy, the same reason why bitcoin has a shelling point of zero issuance and a hard cap is the same reason why we burn eth. It is just the best default option. Because if we didn't burn EtH, then we would have to figure out where we should send it to, who gets it? Who gets it. And that is a very heavy political decision that bestows a kingmaker. That's a kingmaker decision, like who gets the ETH. And so instead of just deciding who should get all of this ETH, which is a ton of money, or like $3 billion or $3 million every 4 hours or so. It's just easiest to say that no one gets it or everyone gets it or everyone gets it right, because if no one gets it, then everyone gets it right, and everyone, I mean, like, ETH holders, which is one of the benefits of holding ETH.
00:09:08.630 - 00:09:56.134, Speaker B: So EIP 1559 changes the way that we allocate Eth. When you pay for a transaction, you used to pay for a transaction, and that money used to go to miners. And now instead, because we have decided that EIP 1559 is a stronger security mechanism and an overall Ux upgrade for Ethereum. We've decided that the best thing that we should do is we should burn that ETH and not give it to anyone. And if you want to dive deeper into the subject, definitely listen to our podcast with hazu E-I-P 1559 and that will go into further depth as to why we burn EtH. And when Ryan, you and I talked about this like multiple years ago, we really just framed it in a conversation of the last puzzle piece, the last really important component of Ethereum's monetary policy. It makes ethereum more secure.
00:09:56.134 - 00:10:12.494, Speaker B: It makes ether more valuable. It's just overall a net beneficial change. And now it's finally live. In the time that I have been ranting, we have burned nine more etH. The ticker just went up from 799 to 808. Now it's at 810. That is a lot.
00:10:12.494 - 00:10:15.854, Speaker B: We burned $5,000 in the time that listeners listen to this.
00:10:16.052 - 00:10:31.414, Speaker A: Remind me, we got to check it again at the end of this episode or maybe continuously throughout the episode. I don't know. We will every 5 minutes. There's so many places you can look at this burn rate. This is probably my favorite. David, ultrasound money. Go check this out.
00:10:31.414 - 00:10:44.540, Speaker A: Like, fantastic memory around this ultrasound money not only has the cumulative eth burn rate, but also has a burn leaderboard. So we see like, some of these NFT platforms are burning the most eth. Openc, how crazy.
00:10:45.310 - 00:10:52.266, Speaker B: Nfts burning more eth than defi. Not cumulatively, but just as openseas burning more eth than uniswap, like cool.
00:10:52.368 - 00:11:16.354, Speaker A: I'm less mad about high gas fees from NFT launches now. I'm a lot less mad about that. I might be okay with it. You can also see it on, of course, your favorite block explorer, like Etherscan, for example. And this is cool because you can dig into the actual block, David pulling it up here, and you could see the block reward, of course, that is issuance. But then you see the amount of ETH burnt on this block, which is super cool. Nice breakdown for you.
00:11:16.392 - 00:11:27.990, Speaker B: And there's so many new metrics in the block explorer now, and this is kind of front running what I'm going to say later in the episode with what I'm excited about. But there's new things to look at, which means more things to talk about, which makes me so excited.
00:11:28.490 - 00:11:46.090, Speaker A: More numbers, more metrics. Of course it's open and available to anyone. I think Micah put together a fantastic dashboard on dune analytics where you can see ETH burnt per block base fees over time. All of this is open and available. So check that out. They'll be in the show notes. And this is cool, too, David.
00:11:46.090 - 00:12:22.934, Speaker A: We had this morning our first deflationary ethereum block, you might say our first ultrasound. Ultrasound block, ethereum block, because while we issue just over two ETH or so every block, according to the protocol, exactly two eth. Exactly two Eth. That generally goes to miners. We burnt more than we issued in this particular block. So the amount burnt per block will fluctuate based on kind of the formula and algorithm that's set up in EIP 15, five, nine. This particular block, I'm not going to say the number 12 million something, you guys can look it up yourselves.
00:12:22.934 - 00:12:48.510, Speaker A: But there was an ETH burnt of 2.78 and an ETH block reward, of course, of two. So the net is actually deflationary, that block. Now, that's not to say ethereum as a whole is deflationary right now, because it's not. It seems like we're issuing like we're probably burning, what would you say, 25 or 30% of proof of work issuance.
00:12:48.590 - 00:13:06.630, Speaker B: I say that's about a good estimation. I think there's a lot of settling that needs to happen. We are still kind of in this period of a little bit of chaos because miners still have to update wallets. Still need to update, shaken out. Yeah. So we are still settling. We are watching this play out in real time.
00:13:06.630 - 00:13:40.574, Speaker B: And that's going to be one of the fun things about the next week is seeing where things settle, seeing how full blocks become, seeing miners get on board, seeing wallets get on board, because something to talk about is that there's actually two transaction types now. There's the legacy transaction types, and then there's EIP 1559 transaction types. Both types burn eth, but one is just a little bit better for the user, one's a little bit easier. And so it's really up to wallets to update how they allow transactions to occur on Ethereum. And they should update to the EIP 1559 over time because that's beneficial to the users. Metamask is now updated. My crypto is now updated.
00:13:40.574 - 00:13:47.574, Speaker B: So people are doing this pretty quickly, but it's going to take at least a few days for everyone to get on board and synced up with EIP 1559.
00:13:47.692 - 00:14:13.694, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And so the net of that is Ethereum is not net deflationary at this moment, but it is more deflationary. So we are burning maybe 25%, 30%. As David said, this will take a while to pan out, but post merge, it's sure looking like things are going to be deflationary when that happens. That merge we're referring to is when proof of work gets fully turned off. That 4% or so issuance per year goes to zero. That's going to happen.
00:14:13.694 - 00:14:50.934, Speaker A: A fly just buzed my head, David. Anyway, you were talking about wallets. So for the typical user, right, this is all backwards compatible. So if you're using metamask and it has not updated, then you can just send a transaction the way you always no change. No change. It might be a bit more expensive relative to using the new transaction that David was mentioning, but once metamask rolls out, they've got a fantastic EIP 15 five nine helper page to show you how to set transaction priority. I think it's going to be more intuitive and easier to use if you're doing that second transaction.
00:14:50.934 - 00:14:53.622, Speaker A: Type the EIP 15 five nine transaction.
00:14:53.686 - 00:14:55.622, Speaker B: Have you made a transaction yet on Ethereum, Ryan?
00:14:55.686 - 00:14:56.490, Speaker A: I haven't.
00:14:57.790 - 00:15:11.342, Speaker B: It's like this pseudo speed update. It actually feels faster just because your transaction gets included into the next block by, almost by default. So it's not faster, but it feels like it is, which is kind of actually the more important part.
00:15:11.476 - 00:15:22.882, Speaker A: Yeah, that's awesome. And gas fees aren't going down as a result. Right? This is not an improvement probably in terms of gas fees. There's some intricacies there that we don't have time to touch again.
00:15:22.936 - 00:15:25.774, Speaker B: Listen to the Hazoo EIP 1559 episode with bankless.
00:15:25.822 - 00:15:28.770, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. But you noticed this, David.
00:15:29.350 - 00:15:54.640, Speaker B: Well, you can actually see it twice. You can see it on the lower right hand side of the screen as well. EIP 1559 is straight up trending on Twitter. Think about that for a second. That's ethereum improvement proposal to this random, esoteric, little known piece of Internet corner, which is going to be larger in the future, is trending on Twitter. EIP 1559 is on the front page of the Internet. That is absolutely crazy.
00:15:55.170 - 00:16:07.654, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really cool. And such a strange, esoteric name. What is EIP 15 five nine? But that's the question they should be asking right now. David, let's get this take from Hayden Adams.
00:16:07.802 - 00:16:47.278, Speaker B: Yeah, Hayden tweets out it has been 2 hours since the launch of EIP 1559 and he tweeted this out a few hours ago and he says, uniswap, both v two and v three is doing its part, burning 80 eth so far. Again, these numbers are already outdated. At this rate, Uniswap alone is burning 350,000 eth, close to $1 billion worth per year. And then he says, congratulations to everyone who made EIP one five five happen. Huge win for ethereum, and great tweet, great piece of content. But also what I want listeners to take note of is this is just uniswap. Just Uniswap is burning 350,000 ether per year.
00:16:47.278 - 00:17:11.462, Speaker B: Just reminder, there's roughly around 115,000,000 ether total. And just Uniswap is burning a little bit over one third of a million ether per year. That's just uniswap. And so imagine when there's just more applications. Imagine all the other applications. Imagine the applications into the future. Imagine the killer apps that we haven't even thought about yet.
00:17:11.462 - 00:17:25.322, Speaker B: Imagine when completely trustless, composable oracles comes online and we can get any data from the world onto Ethereum. Think about that, because imagine how much ether we will be burning at that point in time. It will be a large number.
00:17:25.456 - 00:18:02.198, Speaker A: I'm thinking about it. You know what? And this is absolutely a massive upgrade to Ethereum's monetary policy. And it's kind of the conclusion of a lot of work that a lot of people have been put in at the time. I just want to give a special bankless shout out and thank you to all of the developers in the Ethereum community, coordinators, even some of the people who are sharing the gospel and spreading the news of this and garnering community support. This community are the people who made this happen. And it's like hard to get work done in a way, in a decentralized community. But it's also better, easier in some other ways.
00:18:02.198 - 00:18:28.734, Speaker A: And the fact that the Ethereum community pulled this off is pretty phenomenal, pretty exciting. I mean, this is a live network, right? Like a $250,000,000,000 network. And this is a pretty major economic upgrade to it. And it took literally years of research to come to this point and a ton of work went in. So thanks to the community, thanks to the devs that made this possible, thanks to the researchers, we did it. We did it, fam.
00:18:28.852 - 00:18:54.802, Speaker B: Did it fam. The Ethereum upgrade, Yip 1559 upgrade. It feels like we are having this $250,000,000,000 jet that we upgraded the engines on while in flight. And so that's kind of the degree of complication and that's also the degree of the skills of the developers that we have in this community. So just like Ryan said, thank you for everyone who played a part in getting this out the door. The world is literally better for it. I will make that argument.
00:18:54.946 - 00:19:01.282, Speaker A: Yeah, that's super cool. By the time we started talking about this, let's see how much eth we burnt.
00:19:01.346 - 00:19:07.546, Speaker B: 55 more ether since the last time we brought it up in conversation. Let's just keep on doing that every few minutes.
00:19:07.568 - 00:19:13.966, Speaker A: There you go. All right, guys, moving on from EIP 1559, which is hard to do. So we're very excited about it.
00:19:13.988 - 00:19:14.462, Speaker B: We'll be back.
00:19:14.516 - 00:19:30.290, Speaker A: Do this. We'll be back. 221,000,000 crypto users. All right. That's how many crypto users we have. This is according to a study put out by crypto.com, kind of charts, crypto users over time, the market size.
00:19:30.290 - 00:19:50.562, Speaker A: Of course, these are all estimates. No one could tell for sure, not sure the exact methodology they used for this, but it feels ballpark. It feels about right. And that's an absolutely massive amount of crypto users. Now, we say users. That's super broad. We're talking about anybody who has ever purchased a crypto asset.
00:19:50.562 - 00:20:15.482, Speaker A: This is not defi users. These are not people who even necessarily know what they bought, but these are people who have interacted with, maybe purchased a crypto asset, possibly done something more. It's not just a fad 221,000,000 that is starting to become critical mass. This is moving from early adopters, like the very early stage adopters, to kind of this mid stage adopters. Mid stage adopters range.
00:20:15.546 - 00:20:35.560, Speaker B: Yeah. 221,000,000 is not a low number. Like you said, this has got to be, like the lowest threshold for what is considered a crypto user. Right. So if you've bought $20 worth of bitcoin on coinbase and then you left it and didn't do anything, you're a crypto user, I'm guessing. I would like to know more methodology about how crypto.com came about these numbers.
00:20:35.560 - 00:21:14.820, Speaker B: Maybe on the website they have more details. The other important point to make out is that this is in June 2021 and in January 2021, just six months ago, it was 106,000,000 users. So we have more than doubled the entire user base of this entire industry in just six months. And so that kind of illustrates, kind of how crypto moves in waves, it moves in step functions. Nothing will happen for two years, and then all of a sudden, it's an order of magnitude better, more order of magnitude more users. And Ryan, 221,000,000 users. That's a lot of people that can go and make transactions on Ethereum and burn ETH with vip 1559.
00:21:15.130 - 00:21:39.322, Speaker A: That's right. All right, let's talk about OpenC. Speaking of more burning of ETH, OpenC, which is one of the top in the ETH burn charts right now. This is a tweet from Devin Finzer, who's been on the podcast before. In 2020, Openc did about 21 million in total transaction volume. That's the total for the year. In the last two days.
00:21:39.322 - 00:21:57.422, Speaker A: He's tweeting this August 1, we did 95,000,002 days, 95 million in an entire year. In 2020, they only did 21 million. The growth curve for nfts is insane. Yeah, it is insane. Absolutely going bonkers. And OpeNC is crushing it.
00:21:57.476 - 00:22:18.054, Speaker B: Yeah, no wonder OpeNc had that monster raised not too long ago. Nfts are definitely hot. Turns out the bear market was. This was what I wrote in the market Monday, this week. Turns out the NFT bear market was just a meme. And it turns out it was an NFT land grab opportunity for the people that believed in it. And then the market realized it all in the last two days that Devin was talking about.
00:22:18.054 - 00:22:29.382, Speaker B: Sadly, those two days where OpenC had such insane amount of volume was before EIP 1559. So we didn't burn that ETH, but all future volume going through OpeNC will indeed burn more ETH.
00:22:29.526 - 00:22:41.546, Speaker A: Look at this. This is worth a quick gander, too. Ethereum addresses using DFI rose 65% last quarter. So more ETH addresses going bankless using DFI up into burning ETH?
00:22:41.658 - 00:22:43.838, Speaker B: Wait, is that not what you're going to say? Okay.
00:22:44.004 - 00:22:51.922, Speaker A: No. All right, guys, we will be back with some more burning eth talk, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:22:52.056 - 00:23:27.726, Speaker B: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while, and we'll say it again.
00:23:27.726 - 00:23:55.862, Speaker B: Dows have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap? Dow? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a Uni grant@unigrant.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
00:23:55.862 - 00:24:43.986, Speaker B: That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you Uniswap for sponsoring bankless the Ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on Ethereum, which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets. Ave version two has a ton of cool features that makes using the Ave protocol even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have supplied collateral here, you can see me borrowing 200 USDC against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens.
00:24:44.018 - 00:24:44.738, Speaker A: In ETH.
00:24:44.834 - 00:25:13.920, Speaker B: I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently. V two also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets, trade them on uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. With Ave, users can do this in one seamless transaction, saving you time and gas costs. Check out the power of ave@ave.com. That's aave.com.
00:25:14.370 - 00:25:36.242, Speaker A: Hey guys, we are back with the releases. Dave, there's so much to talk about. We still have some EIP 15 five nine to cover, but we want to get to regulatory, so we're going to burn through some of these releases and get to the regulatory section. Get to the news. The first is this. Starkware and so rare are teaming up. They are releasing the so rare scalability solution on starware.
00:25:36.242 - 00:25:47.706, Speaker A: So, so rare is another NFT project for soccer football in Europe, and it's been doing super well. It's good to see them deploying on layer two with Starkware as their scalability tech.
00:25:47.888 - 00:25:53.054, Speaker B: Layer two summer continues, and so does NFT summer. So awesome. Let's keep going.
00:25:53.092 - 00:25:54.014, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
00:25:54.132 - 00:26:20.920, Speaker B: Brand new ethereum application now on mainnet Thales, a binary options trading platform has deployed. It's got a seed investment from synthetix, so communities seeding other communities. So that's pretty cool. There's a lot to talk about there, but unfortunately we don't have the time. If you are interested in binary options trading, go to Thaleys T-H-A-L-E-S market and see what it's like. I have not tried this out yet, so if you are a binary options trader, ping us on Twitter and let us know what you think.
00:26:21.770 - 00:26:56.526, Speaker A: Guys, speaking of the synthetics world, the derivatives world, DyDX just dropped their token this week. So this is a governance token for DyDX. David we've written tactics about DyDX a number of times, most recently when they deployed their layer two technology. I think that was like April or May or so. And the good news is they're doing a retrospective airdrop. So if you have ever used DyDX, you might be eligible. We actually put out what we call an alpha alert to bankless premium subscribers on the newsletter with all of the details of this retroactive airdrop, what it includes.
00:26:56.526 - 00:27:38.590, Speaker A: You can also find some of this information on the Dydx website. Again, you're eligible if you paid fees DyDx and then you have to use layer two. It looks like they are also receiving some bumps in adoption post governance token launch so this again is a story of kind of the previous DFI summer when the comp token launched and comp usage went off the charts. This is now also happening with DyDx. So go check that out. You might be eligible for that retrospective airdrop. There's also future ways to earn DyDx token if you are a liquidity provider and some other things, so make sure to check that out.
00:27:38.660 - 00:27:57.586, Speaker B: Here's a quick bankless self shill. We told you this was going to happen like six months ago, so shout out to the guys in the bankless discord who said that they started using DyDx when we guessed that DyDx was going to list an airdrop, and they got the airdrop because of that. So sometimes listening to the bankless weekly roll up gives you alpha.
00:27:57.698 - 00:28:33.310, Speaker A: David one sad part for residents of the US is that residents of the US are not eligible for this retrospective airdrop. So this is Jake Trevinsky saying I feel so safe and protected in response to Anthony Cisano saying the US investors are missing out on this airdrop because of stupid regulations. David this doesn't feel great that the SEC is protecting us investors from free money. I mean, they're definitely here to prevent scams and to help make sure that markets are transparent. This does not feel like either of those two objectives.
00:28:34.050 - 00:29:09.050, Speaker B: That's exactly right. Us investors are people, just like the rest of the world. I was a previous user of DyDx before they implemented the IP ban, so I did not get my DyDx tokens, which I feel like I should have gotten because like I said, I'm a user, but I'm glad other people were able to get the tokens. Dydx, unfortunately, but also fortunately for them, did a very good, meticulous job of tracking IP addresses and linking that to Ethereum addresses. And so if your Ethereum address was associated with the US IP address, you did not get the Airdrop. And you can thank the SEC for that one.
00:29:09.200 - 00:29:39.606, Speaker A: There you go. In other news, Bitwise has just launched two new DeFi funds, one for Uniswap, one for Aave. So investors who are credited investors, because of course bitwise is kind of this bridge from old finance to Defi. They can invest in these assets without having metamask, without taking self custody. Sort of an easy way to do this through kind of brokerage accounts and traditional finance. Great to see bitwise investing further and expanding further in the Defi space and giving more exposure to traditional investors there.
00:29:39.708 - 00:29:55.658, Speaker B: Yeah, basically this is just a wrapper around aave and uni tokens, making them available to accredited investors in the tradfi world. It's progress, I guess, but again, limited and hampered by regulation. So we're going to be talking about regulation here in a second, Ryan, soon.
00:29:55.744 - 00:30:13.866, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like we got some access to grind here. Okay, Argent though, this is great news. Argent, one of our favorite smart contract wallets. They are now going to layer two. This has been probably the biggest feature. This is the UX problem with Argent Wallet. Smart contracts wallets in general is high gas prices.
00:30:13.866 - 00:30:29.590, Speaker A: Well, no longer. Right now they have a layer two waitlist. You can enter that. They've got prizes, almost 300k in crypto sweepstakes to celebrate. So it's not out yet, but you can enter that waitlist. And I can't wait to see what they have in store. I'm pretty excited about this one.
00:30:29.660 - 00:30:57.310, Speaker B: Yeah, also definitely go listen to Vitalik's smart contract wallets on layer two. That was a fantastic episode about why specifically layer two is very good for enabling smart contract wallets. I was a heavy user of argent wallet when back in the early days. But as soon as gas fees on Ethereum stopped being one guay and for the Ethereum newcomers, it used to be one guay. Which is kind of a thing now. The Argent worked pretty well. Gas fees were basically nothing, and you didn't have to wait too long.
00:30:57.310 - 00:31:08.546, Speaker B: But now gas fees with Argent are really expensive and the Transactions take a really long time. This is something that really needs layer two to work. So I'm really excited to see what argent on layer two is like.
00:31:08.728 - 00:31:29.650, Speaker A: I'm going to keep us moving. David, rocket pool is going to testnet, which is super exciting. A new decentralized staking protocol. Rocket pool going to testnet on August 2. I hope they can keep shipping. There are a lot of, I think, staking organizations that have come up and deployed solutions ahead of them. We've been super excited about rocket pool because of their focus on decentralization.
00:31:29.650 - 00:31:38.602, Speaker A: It's good to see them progress to testnet. David, do you want to talk about this? This is a new ETh modeler. Like a risk modeler of some sort. What is this?
00:31:38.656 - 00:32:03.858, Speaker B: Yeah, this is an ETH supply simulator. A little bit like ultrasound money, but just a few more things to tinker with, a nice little graph. And so you can change the validator. How many validators there are, you can change. When the proof of stake activation comes, you can change the gas fee, and then it will model out the future supply of ETh for you. So don't let anyone tell you that you can't predict the future supply of ETH. It is capable of being done.
00:32:03.858 - 00:32:08.050, Speaker B: And you can also see how low that number goes, which is where I get excited.
00:32:08.210 - 00:32:23.740, Speaker A: Yeah, you can model this based on your own assumptions, whatever. Those are also cool. David. In continuation of layer two, summer diversify, which is a decentralized exchange, is now bridging directly to polygon, which is super cool to see.
00:32:24.110 - 00:32:45.426, Speaker B: Remember, Ethereum is an economic nexus. We have the main chain, we got layer twos, we got side chains. All those things are going to interconnect with each other in different ways. And so this is one of those many bridges that just got built. You can now go straight from Polygon to diversify without even touching Ethereum. And so no longer can you say that gas prices are an issue, because you can just go to the l two and stay there.
00:32:45.608 - 00:33:40.286, Speaker A: Absolutely, David, let's get to raises. So this just in, Masari, which is a crypto media company, crypto analysis company, just released information about their 21 million series A funding, which is cool in and of itself. What's also cool is that another billionaire has joined the banks, is investing in that series A, Steve Cohen. So you might know him from zero point 72 a large kind of crypto capital, or, sorry, a large traditional capital firm. In July, there was news released that zero point 72 is hunting for a crypto chief after saying it would be remiss to ignore digital assets. So it's a link there, too. Again, this is the story of traditional finance billionaires starting to get into crypto and deploy capital there, not just in the assets themselves, but in some of the infrastructure companies, in this case in massares.
00:33:40.286 - 00:34:04.620, Speaker A: It's kind of cool to see another DFI protocol. Sense Finance announced their raise of $5.2 million. They're saying to add a new dimension to DFI. So this is essentially creating fixed income types of markets. So similar to element finance, if you're familiar with that sense, has kind of a different take on it, but also building out that fixed income primitive. It's super exciting to see.
00:34:04.620 - 00:34:11.402, Speaker A: David, you want to talk about crystal? This is a DFI platform that raised 6.1 million. What are they up to?
00:34:11.456 - 00:34:48.422, Speaker B: Yeah, this is crystal out of Kyber. So Kyber moving out of just being the liquidity provider to Ethereum, to also being a kind of a Defi dashboard. We've seen a bunch of emergences of new DeFi dashboards out on the scene, especially as DeFi becomes more rich and more complex. So crystal is going to be a new place to interact with all of DeFi we've been joking about, and Jim Bianco really gets credit for this joke is like, people are looking for, like, all right, I downloaded Coinbase. Where's the Defi? And there's actually more and more people out there working to provide the DeFi for people. And this is the new product out of Kyber called Crystal. And let's see where it goes.
00:34:48.556 - 00:34:50.006, Speaker A: People want their Defi button.
00:34:50.108 - 00:34:51.560, Speaker B: Where's the Defi button?
00:34:52.250 - 00:35:30.134, Speaker A: We say it every time, but if you are looking for a job in crypto, the way to check that out is through the bankless job. Sports. We've got a lot of fantastic jobs featured there. Senior product manager at Immutable Gaming, crypto gaming company, full stack engineer at Palette, a senior solidity engineer at Quant Finance, chief investment officer at Yield App, a software engineer at Arbitrum, a designer at pool. Together, of course, bankless is still looking for its editor, so there's tons of opportunities to plug in during this season. This, I guess, crab season. Bull market season is still on, but crypto firms are hiring like crazy.
00:35:30.252 - 00:35:34.070, Speaker B: Crab market with big bullhorns. Big bullhorns on that crab.
00:35:34.410 - 00:35:36.358, Speaker A: All right, David, you ready to get to the news.
00:35:36.444 - 00:35:37.446, Speaker B: Yeah, let's do it.
00:35:37.548 - 00:36:05.938, Speaker A: All right, man, let's start with this. This is a blog post entitled the road to trustless ETh staking. We've been doing a lot of deep dives on ETH staking. Recently we had that ETH staking panel. One of the panelists was from Lido, and this is a blog post from Lido. They are kind of moving really quickly in the ETH staking industry, and they just rolled out this post about becoming more trustless. David, what's the TLDR of what they're attempting to do here?
00:36:06.024 - 00:36:46.910, Speaker B: Yeah, basically the TLDR is that there is a few low hanging fruit things to become completely trustless as a staking as a service provider. And maybe just to back up as context, there are two main significant staking as a service providers that aren't just like a centralized exchange. One of them is Lido, which we're talking about now. The other one is Rocketpool, which we talked about earlier. Rocket pool has always had the ethos of being maximally and completely decentralized without compromise. From day one, Lido has made some sort of compromises to trustless staking by starting with a dao multi sig model. This is the same critiques that Polygon has been getting for being secured by a multi sig rather than being a protocol.
00:36:46.910 - 00:37:34.394, Speaker B: But the ethos behind Lido is that, well, if we wait to become a completely decentralized protocol, the centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken might gain too much of a lead. And that is kind of a threat in of itself. And so in order to get out the door quickly, Lido started as a dao with permission, validators. And now this blog post talks about the way that they are going to further their trustlessness, further their decentralization, and turn into something closer to what the ethos behind rocket pool is. And so they talk about the problems that they have ahead, how they're going to tackle them, and what the various routes towards the trustless future that they want out of Lido. It's really awesome to see Lido have that commitment, have that ethos. And so that makes me excited.
00:37:34.394 - 00:37:56.110, Speaker B: There's also some pretty cool cryptographic ethereum stuff. Shared secret validators is something that I am paying attention to, which has a mention here in the post. So if you are interested in seeing how a dao can turn into a protocol, shared secret validators is one of the points here. And if you are into that world, definitely check out this blog post. It's a very just educational one to read.
00:37:56.280 - 00:38:37.390, Speaker A: We definitely have to make sure eth staking remains decentralized, remains trustless. So this is an initiative we will continue to support at bankless. David, interesting news. Zoku, who is kind of Zuko, sorry, who is the lead founder of Zcash, asked this question on Twitter. This is a governance question. Should Zcash switch from proof of work to proof of stake? It's kind of interesting here, right? Even that this question is being posed. I have to ask myself, does this mean proof of stake has won, or is winning like when a long standing proof of work chain raises this question, you have to ask yourself why, right? Totally.
00:38:37.470 - 00:39:28.980, Speaker B: And Zuko, the Zcash community and the ethereum community have always been really close. You and I have critiqued Zcash in the past about does privacy need its own l one? And to some degree I think this is actually an illustration of that, because proof of stake is just like just a leaner consensus algorithm, which is just like making the whole thing just leaner and smaller and more condensed, which kind of goes to show that, no, you are just trying to optimize for zero knowledge proofs, which should be an app on Ethereum. That's really a different story. I take your point that a long standing proof of work blockchain, and it just started with proof of work because that's what Zcash had to work with at the time, is now saying like, hey, proof of stake might work better for us. And there is definitely a very strong argument to link proof of stake with cryptography. Cryptography is easier with proof of stake. I'm not technical enough to explain how.
00:39:29.750 - 00:39:57.050, Speaker A: Mean, but there's a huge efficiency gain and that might be it. I know Zcash spends a whole lot of money in terms of block rewards in order to fund the security of itself. Zcash. And so if you transition to proof of stake, you don't have to spend as much. Maybe like one 10th the amount is kind of the estimates that Justin Drake gives for a switch from proof of work to proof of stake. So we'll see how that goes. David, let's talk NFT stuff because that is a big story this week as well.
00:39:57.050 - 00:40:13.518, Speaker A: Crypto punks are just pumping cryptopunks. Price rise 53% in the week after Ethereum whales feeding frenzy. That is the title. Half of the top ten crypto punks have been sold over the past two days. This happened last week. What is going on in the crypto punk world?
00:40:13.604 - 00:40:55.774, Speaker B: Yeah, this is what I wrote about again in the market Monday people thought it was the NFT bear market, but the convicted knew that it was an NFT like land grab opportunity. And so there was a bunch of people that were bullish on nfts that were buying up the cheap nfts as people left the NFT like mania from earlier. And then enough people realized what was going on, that nfts weren't actually bearish and they were quite bullish. And then all of a sudden, the market kind of all realized it at once. And people descended upon first cryptopunks, which are kind of like the bitcoin of nfts. The OG nfts and the cryptopunks got bought up first. The first event that happened was that Gary Vee paid $2.7
00:40:55.774 - 00:41:24.338, Speaker B: million for a knitted cap ape. And then he tweeted out something like here we go or something. And then people connected it. And that kind of kicked off the frenzy. I was part of that frenzy. I got the fomo. So I bought my crypto punk right after I saw this frenzy pick up because I kind of felt I was part of that environment where people thought that nfts were bearish and then realized that everyone else is also bullish on nfts.
00:41:24.338 - 00:42:00.754, Speaker B: So I fomoed into a punk, and I fomoed into a punk Friday morning. And the punk mania just absolutely continued for the next like 48, 72 hours, where if you go, there's a Duna analytics dashboard for punks that compare to all time volume. And just the last week of volume is like three times higher than any other candle. And then millions and millions of dollars got purchased or got spent on crypto punks after Gary Vee bought the ape knitted cap NFT for 2.7 million. Another ape gold chain, crypto punk, got sold for 5.5 million.
00:42:00.754 - 00:42:30.166, Speaker B: An alien punk got bought yesterday for 1000 ether. A new alien cryptopunk got listed available to be sold for 90 million. We'll see if that gets purchased. And then we also saw three arrows capital come in, throw in a bunch of money cryptopunks and art blocks and some other NFT projects. We saw the floor price, which is the lowest price that you can buy a specific NFT for. So many different NFT projects, run up board apes got purchased. Like art blocks got purchased, cool cats got purchased.
00:42:30.166 - 00:42:38.062, Speaker B: And so there was just a bunch of reallocation rotation into the NFT industry. And that all happened last weekend and is still kind of happening to this day.
00:42:38.196 - 00:42:40.394, Speaker A: Are you ever going to sell your crypto punk, David?
00:42:40.522 - 00:43:01.398, Speaker B: Well, so I realized right after I bought my crypto punks, like, great, I got a crypto punk. Now I'm really bullish crypto punk. Now I'm going to put it as my avatar. And now I realize that I only have one and I can't ever sell it because it's my only one. It's part of me now. And so I can't ever sell my one cryptopunk. So I bought relatively expensive cryptopunk and now I can't ever sell it.
00:43:01.484 - 00:43:03.574, Speaker A: You do expect us to appreciate over time, right?
00:43:03.612 - 00:43:07.394, Speaker B: In ether terms, yes, in ether terms. Not just fiat terms.
00:43:07.452 - 00:43:08.426, Speaker A: Absolutely ether terms.
00:43:08.448 - 00:43:09.542, Speaker B: In ether terms, totally.
00:43:09.606 - 00:43:11.542, Speaker A: More bullish cryptopunks than eth.
00:43:11.606 - 00:43:14.650, Speaker B: Wow. Crypto punks are just wrapped ether.
00:43:16.110 - 00:43:30.366, Speaker A: Interesting. Wrapped ether in pixel form is, I guess. Okay, cool. Yeah. Anything else on crypto bucks? Bullish. Bullish. Talk about this more.
00:43:30.366 - 00:43:39.762, Speaker A: Nfts. Polygon has become a sponsor of the New York Knicks. That seems super big. What? Wow.
00:43:39.896 - 00:43:41.298, Speaker B: New York Knicks Twitter account.
00:43:41.384 - 00:43:42.610, Speaker A: I say sponsor.
00:43:43.430 - 00:43:46.622, Speaker B: Yeah, you said sponsor. Yeah. Proud to power the NFT collection.
00:43:46.686 - 00:43:56.630, Speaker A: Sorry? They are powering the NFT collection. Yes, I read sponsor, but yes. So they are powering. So New York Knicks are using polygon tech in order to deploy nfts. That's what this looks like.
00:43:56.700 - 00:43:57.270, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:43:57.420 - 00:44:00.822, Speaker A: While we're talking nfts, David, tell me about Treverse. What is that?
00:44:00.876 - 00:44:27.582, Speaker B: Yeah, Treverse, I've heard. I haven't played this myself. This is a new game on Ethereum that is token enabled. I've heard this described as like a runescape, a new runescape, which I definitely played when I was younger. And it is a token enabled game played to win axie infinity type game. And while this is kind of in its early stages, just wanted to call attention to this. If you want to explore the play to earn games version of Ethereum, side of Ethereum, check out Treverse.
00:44:27.582 - 00:44:30.050, Speaker B: The Twitter account is the Treverse.
00:44:30.790 - 00:45:32.114, Speaker A: All right, David, let's talk regulatory. You want to start with the infrastructure bill, man? So this infrastructure bill has been just huge. Seems like there's momentum to pass it. And the problem with it is there was a provision that got added to the infrastructure bill in part of the pay for section that putted some handcuffs, I'll say some just stringent requests, unrealistic requests on crypto, in particular tax reporting of crypto that could extend to individual wallets, maybe wallet providers, maybe even exchanges like uniswap doing things that none of these protocols actually have the capability to report. The requirements don't even make sense in the bill. And so there was a huge crypto rally and pushback against this. We had folks from coin center, for example, working with senators to try to change this information, change this bill, have it amended.
00:45:32.114 - 00:45:37.494, Speaker A: And it looks like there's some progress here. Could you update us on what that progress is? Yeah.
00:45:37.532 - 00:45:56.778, Speaker B: First off, just to reiterate, the bill made anybody that ever provided any service to any user of any cryptocurrency, it labeled them as a broker, which means that they had to do reporting on all of their users, which to some degree is really, really hard and not even relevant. And then best case scenario, and then worst case scenario is actually straight up impossible.
00:45:56.874 - 00:45:57.086, Speaker A: Right?
00:45:57.108 - 00:46:37.562, Speaker B: So it would make metamask defined as a broker, which means metamask would have to do reporting requirements. Jerry Britto, who is at coin center, he tweeted out that they have made improvements into the language, and so they were able to exclude validators, which means, like node operators are no longer required to report, hardware and software wallets are no longer required to report. So that's like ledger and Metamask. There's still many more things, many more battles to be had to make this legislation make any sense at all, but it's made a step in the right direction. I've heard some interesting takes about just straight up the logistics of this.
00:46:37.616 - 00:47:21.370, Speaker A: The other thing about this, David, is it's really nice to see some us senators on our side. So, Senator Wyden, Senator Loomis, Senator Toomey, they were part of working through this amendment, changing the language, working with coinsetter to really understand the crypto industry. So we do have some senators that are crypto sympathetic and seem to understand this. And of course, Senator Loomis was the individual who in Wyoming, had some DAO legislation passed in her home state. So that's cool to see. That said, I mean, this is a great example of the crypto industry kind of rallying and saying, like pushing back against this. I heard tons of people call senators, tweet about this, write letters, this sort of thing, write emails, this sort of thing.
00:47:21.370 - 00:47:56.366, Speaker A: And I think part and parcel of that, like part of that action was actually why we were able to get this amendment language in place. It was definitely put out there as a fire alarm. Like, everybody in crypto come react to this and make sure that this legislation doesn't go forward. And at the end of the day, it seems like it is being resolved. There's still some action that people can take to call their senators. In fact, we have a link in the show notes to call your senator, to save crypto and make sure that this doesn't happen, that this amendment does go through. And I'm curious to hear your perspective on this, David.
00:47:56.366 - 00:48:21.662, Speaker A: Do you feel like this is a crypto success story, or do you feel like at some level this is, I don't know, a bit of a false alarm or like the crypto industry was overly worried about language that was going to be changed at some stage anyway, and there was too much regulatory fud going on. What's your take on this?
00:48:21.716 - 00:49:22.234, Speaker B: Yeah, so the take that I kind of agree with, but I'm not really highly convicted in this belief, is that the legislation was so incredibly, just nonsensical. And I feel like you could see this in the markets, because the markets did not negatively react to an legislation that could, in theory, completely break the industry. But the legislation was so bad, was so uninformed, was so nonsensical, didn't even make sense that as soon as regulators would try to enforce this legislation, they would realize what absolute shitstorm they accidentally caused for themselves. Imagine going to Dan Finley at Metamask and saying, hey, Dan Finley, give us all of the reporting tax details of all 50 million of your users, which you don't collect tax information on by default. And that's just one example, right? The ledger doesn't know what your addresses are in your ledger. Like, ledger can't report, so it can provide you the wallet. And therefore, in theory, it should be a broker in providing that information to regulators.
00:49:22.234 - 00:49:45.906, Speaker B: But it has no idea. So to some degree, this regulation was so incredibly nonsensical that as soon as any enforcement attempt would come, it would be so easy to defend in court. It would be so easy. Regulators would just be overwhelmed with what to do. And that's why I think the markets didn't react, because the nonsensical nature of this was so incredibly crazy that it was going to be impossible to be enforced anyways.
00:49:46.018 - 00:49:48.786, Speaker A: It didn't seem malicious, it just seemed inept.
00:49:48.978 - 00:50:38.710, Speaker B: It seemed like just straight up like, what's the word? Inept is a great word. Inept is a great word, right? And so to some degree, while very important efforts were taken to rally the community to get good legislation in, and we should always, as an industry, always get good legislation in when we can, I'm very glad to see that the crypto community, the crypto industry, rose to the occasion and actively participated in governance over a nation state which impacts our industry. Our industry is kind of branded as this anti state, antiregulation, anti government industry. And to be fair, the crypto world is a straight up anti nation state. Is it really anti. It's a non nation state technology. So that's what you get.
00:50:38.710 - 00:51:12.830, Speaker B: It's extra nation state, right. Non biased to the nation state. It just is. And the crypto community, regardless of that branding, showed up to senators telephone, showed up to where regulation gets done and participated. And so that makes me bullish on the community. When we need to, we will rally and get what we need to done. That being said, was this not a drill or was this a drill? And it's one of those things where if this wasn't a drill, we acted accordingly and we kind of turned it into a nothing burger.
00:51:12.830 - 00:51:15.602, Speaker B: At the end of the day, I think that's a take.
00:51:15.656 - 00:51:31.846, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, it's like you have to treat every fire drill as if it's real because one of them will be real. Right. So you have to react to everyone. And I'm really proud of what the crypto community has accomplished, guys. But still, we'll have a link in the show notes for Fightforyourfuture.org where you can contact your senator.
00:51:31.846 - 00:52:12.434, Speaker A: It's like pre made information. They will help you through the process to make sure this amendment sticks in. But, like, I think part of the reason we're so worried, David, is because it just seems like coming out of us lawmakers, they just don't understand this asset class at all. So this is a headline from. She said crypto markets might need bailout someday without the proper regulation. So she's making the case essentially that, hey, if we don't regulate crypto, us taxpayers are going to be on the hook the next time crypto wants a bailout. And I'm like, what? No, literally the opposite.
00:52:12.434 - 00:52:21.226, Speaker A: You're thinking of banks, Elizabeth Warren. Banks are the groups that need bailouts. Crypto has never asked, can't even ask for.
00:52:21.328 - 00:52:26.570, Speaker B: Too proud to ask. I wouldn't dare ask regulators for a bailout.
00:52:27.070 - 00:52:59.334, Speaker A: But how could that work? It's just a fundamental mismatch. Understanding if this is part of the reason you're saying this is a case you're making to support crypto regulation because crypto regulation might need bailout some days. No, I mean, we've gone through 95%, 99% price drops, not asking for a bailout. DFI gets hacked all of the time. No bailouts. Was there a bailout for Mount Gox, David? No bailouts are coming. We know that.
00:52:59.334 - 00:53:03.138, Speaker A: Everyone in crypto knows that. And that is a feature. It is not a bug.
00:53:03.234 - 00:53:04.518, Speaker B: And that is absolutely right.
00:53:04.604 - 00:53:23.186, Speaker A: It's a feature we need inside of our existing financial system. This is why we're going crypto is because big banks and plutocrats and oligarchs cannot be bailed out. That's why we're doing this. So it's like swinging a miss, man. Totally whiff on the. That's why we're worried.
00:53:23.238 - 00:53:54.706, Speaker B: This just gives you such a great insight into the inner workings of Elizabeth Warren's brain, thinking just like, oh, they might need a bailout. That is straight up inner circle, just like incumbents paying off regulators. The reason why bailouts happened is because people who are insiders were able to make them happen. Who is literally the not insiders of the world? It's the Crypto people. We are the outside. That's why we are here. We are too proud of an industry to ask for regulations.
00:53:54.706 - 00:54:23.562, Speaker B: We would never want them in the first place. We are building our protocols to be regulation resistant and bailout unnecessary. And so the fact that Elizabeth Warren even would associate bailouts with crypto just tells you what mindset she's in. She is in an MMT mindset. She's in a nanny state mindset. She thinks that we're going to ask for bailouts and therefore we deserve regulation, when really we want neither of those things. We don't need bailouts.
00:54:23.562 - 00:54:39.794, Speaker B: We get rug pulled and then we carry on the next day. That's what it means to be a crypto person. It just puts you too much insight into how Elizabeth Warren doesn't understand at all what the ethos of this industry is. And she's using this whole, like, oh, they're going to ask for a bailout now. We need to regulate them.
00:54:39.992 - 00:55:33.170, Speaker A: You know, know, I also want to lend the hand of like, hey, come learn about this to us senators. I don't trust other people. I don't necessarily trust it. I don't know, but I just want them to know that this open finance thing is not a way to escape regulation. This brings me to maybe the Gary Gensler letter, and we should talk about this for a a. So he is the new SEC chair and he put out a letter, and I think this is a speech given at the Aspen security Forum. And there were some concerning things in know, one of the things he said that stuck with me is that some people in crypto are trying to shirk the legal system and that is the reason why they use crypto.
00:55:33.170 - 00:56:06.398, Speaker A: Like, David, I don't see very much of that at just, we're not trying to shirk the legal system in crypto, we're trying to shirk the shitty banking system that we have in place. If the banking system was better and if it was digital, if it had the features that crypto had, we would be using the banking system right. It's because the banking system failed that this bottom up movement is happening. That's one thing that stuck out for me from this letter. But what are some of the other things for you, David?
00:56:06.494 - 00:56:47.054, Speaker B: One point that I'll make on that is one of the reasons why there's this inherent tie to being anti regulation, is that banks, the incumbents, are making the regulations to protect themselves. And so if we want to be anti regulation, we don't want to be anti regulation, we want to be anti banks. We're just frustrated that banks are buying regulations that they want that protect them. And so who do you think turn everything into banks? They turn everything into banks. They take away our individualism, they take away our self sovereignty, and then they just extort us. That's the natural, organic pattern of banks over the centuries, and that's what we want to get away from. And so let's make good crypto regulation happen.
00:56:47.054 - 00:57:31.126, Speaker B: And this was my last rant on the last weekly roll up, is that the crypto industry would love. Fantastic, good, precise, clean regulation. Please provide that. Regulate us in an educated fashion so you can come get your tax money. But if you come and regulate us by saying that any wallet provider or any node is a broker and needs to provide information, you're not going to get any tax money because it's nonsensical and you're just going to eff it up and then there's going to be resistance. So we should shake hands. We should rally behind people like Jake Shravinsky and the other lawyers in this space who are informing regulators about how to properly do this, so that the regulators can get the tax money from this industry that they want to pay for the infrastructure bill, just do it right rather than come in heavy handed.
00:57:31.126 - 00:57:56.382, Speaker B: I think the mistake that this tax bill made was thinking that the crypto people are just like this corner of the Internet. They don't care about society, they don't care about government, and we'll just tax them just because we can and we'll bully them like, oh, no, wrong. Crypto people are some of the most politically engaged people on this planet because people think that this is a revolution in money and finance, and it totally is. But this is also a political revolution. These are all political people in this industry.
00:57:56.526 - 00:58:25.662, Speaker A: Social revolution. We're fighting for hearts and minds here. And I think the big question with this Gary Gensler letter is like he's the new SEC chair taking over from Jay Clayton. The question is, is he crypto friendly or not? So there's some takes around the crypto universe. On the back of this mentioned, Gary Gensler mentioned that he agrees with the previous SEC chair, that most icos, he said in the letter, are probably securities. Right. So that was one point that stuck out.
00:58:25.662 - 00:59:09.126, Speaker A: There are a few other points here, but here's a take from Nick Carter. Somebody asked him, what's your explanation? What do you think of this letter? And he said, it's not clear that the SEC can actually fulfill its agenda given current resources, but at minimum, a crackdown on exchanges both onshore and offshore might be coming. This is sort of what he took from Gary Gensler's letter. He also said Gary Gensler, it seemed, was expressing a need for additional legislation. So it could be the case that the SEC actually doesn't have the power or authority to do some of the things that Gary Gensler is suggesting. But there were some more upbeat takes here. David.
00:59:09.126 - 00:59:16.366, Speaker A: So this is a take from a crypto Twitter lawyer, Preston Byrne. What did Preston think about this?
00:59:16.468 - 00:59:53.750, Speaker B: Yeah, and I've heard this sentiment echoed by other lawyers as well, is that Preston said that Gensler's speech today was straight down the middle and entirely consistent with what more conservative legal advice in this space has been for years. This guy at the top 100% understands crypto. We knew that. And Preston finishes saying, I think this is actually bullish for prospects like the bitcoin ETF. And so what he's saying is that there has been generally more conservative legal advice in this space. And if you were following that legal advice, then Gary Gensler is not doing anything unexpected for you. And so no erratic, know your customers don't sell the investors, sadly.
00:59:53.750 - 01:00:07.134, Speaker B: But then I think the take here is that Gary Gensler, he's going to be a stickler, he's going to be strict, he's going to be a bit of a hard ass, and he's going to let this industry progress forward at the same time, which, fine, I'll take it. I'll take it.
01:00:07.172 - 01:00:43.242, Speaker A: Yeah, it's definitely not the worst it could be, for sure. This is a headline in Bloomberg saying Gensler signals pathway for bitcoin ETF with tough rules. This is partially from his speech, and I think the key clip here is this. Gensler is hinting that he'd like to see a filing. This is an ETF filing. All of the previous ETF filings have been denied for a bitcoin ETF, but he's hinting he'd like to see a filing that seeks approval through a 1940s law that governs mutual funds. Most of the pending applications have been filed under a 1930s law.
01:00:43.242 - 01:01:07.426, Speaker A: Back to your point about being a stickler, right. It's like, hey, if you fill out the right forms and you do it the right way, then I'll give it to you. But you have to do it the right way. Right. This is maybe the signal that he's sending to crypto, in addition to the signal of, like, I want more legislation in this space. Unless he gets the legislation, I'm not sure how much more the SEC is going to be able to do. Right.
01:01:07.528 - 01:01:39.450, Speaker B: And I think another very telling comment towards the bottom of this article is he says we don't have enough investor protection in crypto. Gary Gensler said, it's more like the Wild west. And this definitely shows you the difference in mindset and disposition of people in crypto, because he's saying this, it's more like the Wild west, as if it's a bad thing. And, Ryan, you finish off every single bankless episode, is we are heading west. It's not for everyone. But we are glad you are with us on the bankless journey. And so kind of, yes, we don't have enough investor protection in crypto.
01:01:39.450 - 01:01:46.330, Speaker B: Sometimes to some people, when you say the words investor protection, we hear incumbent protection, not investor protection.
01:01:46.410 - 01:01:47.438, Speaker A: That's exactly it.
01:01:47.524 - 01:02:00.594, Speaker B: Exactly it. And we like the Wild west. It's fun out here. There's 10,000 x gains and rug pulls. Who knows what comes next? But we're here for it because we're self sovereign and we're individuals in control of our own money.
01:02:00.712 - 01:02:22.214, Speaker A: It is the wild west. But we do have an investor protection that they don't see. They think investor protection means regulatory action and new legal codes. Right. Investor protection is an open source, transparent financial system where you can view source into every asset. You can see exactly what's inside of it. That's investor protection.
01:02:22.214 - 01:02:47.042, Speaker A: Right. So, yeah, it's the wild west, but you know what? I'll take that over the closed financial system where I have no idea how the money is moving. Right. This is all open. This is transparent. That is our investor protection. I wish they would acknowledge that more in some of these know Senator Warren and even Gary Gensler's like, take some of the good that is coming out of the system.
01:02:47.042 - 01:02:56.702, Speaker A: We've built a more transparent financial system from the ground up. And regulators, again, should be falling over themselves in support of a system like this. It's going to make their jobs easier.
01:02:56.766 - 01:03:37.170, Speaker B: You know what the best investor protections are is financial services are built by code where no one is allowed to break the rules. And so that code is enforced equally transparently across everyone. And so the whole point about ethereum is that no one is the admin, everyone is a user, everyone is treated equally, everyone can audit the code. That is the best investor protections that money can buy. It's code. Protecting investor protections is a human to human thing. Where's privileged information? Somebody like big wealthy whale has privileged information, entices a lot of retail people, and then rug pulls them and takes all their money in code.
01:03:37.170 - 01:04:05.974, Speaker B: If we can enforce that against that. And I've never been rug pulled. I've stuck to the major defi apps like compound maker and Aave. I've never been rug pulled. Code has protected me from rug pulls and also my own due diligence. And so to some degree, there's going to be the same tricks in every single financial market, and we need to avoid scammers and fraudsters and all that. But the lack of appreciation for the fact that code is protecting all of us is frustrating.
01:04:05.974 - 01:04:08.422, Speaker B: But I also understand that's a complicated subject.
01:04:08.566 - 01:04:33.540, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. All right, so that's what the take, the US is taking right now. It's a little bit of this, a little bit of that, some vitriol against crypto, maybe some support, kind of wishy washy. Definitely not a policy towards crypto yet, but China definitely has a policy to crypto, and I want crypto out of here. We want crypto outside of our borders. They've been putting pressure on miners, on exchanges. We've talked about that in the past.
01:04:33.540 - 01:05:14.062, Speaker A: And they say the PBOC, that's the people's bank of China, is saying it's going to continue to keep high pressure on crypto trading. David, I just want to highlight our podcast that's coming out on Monday. It's already available. If you are a bankless premium member, you can listen to this podcast now. We recorded it last week. This is with a gentleman by the name of Richard Turin, who wrote a book called cashless, all about what China is doing, their plans for digital currency, a digital currency revolution, as he calls it, in China. And something that's interesting that I learned from this book and from the podcast is that China's digital currency strategy is explicitly a deterrent against cryptocurrency.
01:05:14.062 - 01:05:40.086, Speaker A: Okay. They don't want capital flight. They don't want a free money system that is outside of the PBOC's control, inside of their borders. So in addition to pushing it out, they're actually trying to build a controlled, centralized crypto alternative. This is the China central bank digital currency. Essentially. It's explicitly part of their strategy.
01:05:40.086 - 01:06:15.506, Speaker A: Instead of not replacing it with, they're replacing all of the crypto stuff with something that looks a little bit like crypto. It's digital in the same way, but it's completely controlled and centralized. That's their approach, and it's a pretty smart approach if you are a, know, authoritarian kind of power and you want to go down this route. So anyway, eye opening podcast. Fantastic podcast. I think we need to learn about China's approach because it's going to make waves in terms of what the US does next as well, and it's going to be pretty important to the world.
01:06:15.608 - 01:06:32.314, Speaker B: Yeah, I can't recommend this podcast enough. It opened my eyes to what, really the true story is behind the chinese central bank digital currency. And if you thought the last section made you question a regulator's competency about how to approach DeFi, listening to this will make you question it even more.
01:06:32.432 - 01:06:35.930, Speaker A: Because of how it's all over it.
01:06:36.000 - 01:06:41.722, Speaker B: China's all over the central bank digital currency recently. I can't remember what it was.
01:06:41.776 - 01:06:43.002, Speaker A: Smart contracts, dude.
01:06:43.066 - 01:07:24.214, Speaker B: Yeah, they have smart contracts coming. And meanwhile, not too long ago, there was, like, a us banking regulations panel that was headlined cryptocurrencies. What are they even good for? Meanwhile, China saw crypto and applied it to the central bank digital currency and is releasing one of the most powerful forces that this world has ever seen in decades. In the east and then meanwhile in the west, people are questioning if crypto is even useful. It's just a fad. And then just allocating, like, terrible regulation to it when they have forced themselves into a corner where their only option is to leverage DFI to combat chinese bank digital currency. I need to stop or else I'm going to explode.
01:07:24.342 - 01:07:29.066, Speaker A: Well, look, man, this is what happens when your average senator is 65 years old, right? This is exactly what happens.
01:07:29.168 - 01:07:29.820, Speaker B: Nice.
01:07:30.510 - 01:07:32.198, Speaker A: All right, let's move on. David.
01:07:32.294 - 01:07:33.850, Speaker B: Yeah, we got to burn through this drive bys.
01:07:33.930 - 01:07:55.598, Speaker A: All right. Wealthfront is offering grayscale bitcoin trust. That is a robo lender. Wealthfront, a lot of people use. Pretty cool to see them doing that as continuation of the story. Also, Germany, institutions, they are allowed to hold, I think, up to 20 million in crypto now. So Germany is coming down the pike with some crypto friendly regulation legislation.
01:07:55.598 - 01:07:57.870, Speaker A: It's kind of cool. You want to get this last one? David?
01:07:57.950 - 01:08:25.534, Speaker B: Yeah. Richard no, excuse me. Ricardo Spagny, one of the original members of Monero, not the OG Monero person, because that's a very interesting story. Was actually arrested for things unrelated to crypto. Apparently defrauded a company in South Africa and was extradited to South Africa. So basically he's considered basically the founder of Monero, even though that's technically inaccurate. Got arrested for unrelated to crypto reasons, which is an interesting side quest of the story.
01:08:25.652 - 01:08:37.538, Speaker A: Look, there are still some shady people in crypto. Definitely have to acknowledge that for the regulators listening in here. Okay, guys, we're going to get to the takes in just a minute, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:08:37.704 - 01:09:29.730, Speaker B: Balancer is a powerful platform for flexible automated market makers. Typical amms just have two tokens inside of one liquidity pool, which can lead to fractured liquidity across the many pairs. In defi with Balancer, you can access the full power of multiple tokens inside of one single amm, which unlocks an entirely new playing field of possibility. This makes Balancer an awesome building block for so many different use cases. Balancer pools can make asset indices, but instead of paying fees to portfolio managers, balancer lets you collect the fees from traders who use your portfolio for liquidity. Additionally, balancer smart pools can be programmed to have properties that change according to predetermined rules, such as changing the swap fee based on market conditions, or even liquidity bootstrapping pools, which can help you launch and distribute your token with day one liquidity. At bankless, we use a liquidity bootstrapping pool to sell our bap t shirts to much success.
01:09:29.730 - 01:10:16.782, Speaker B: Balancer V two brings powerful new features that makes your money work even harder for you. In V two, idle tokens are capable of generating yield in DFI without sacrificing liquidity in the pool using balancer's asset managers. Balancer's vault architecture lets you trade between balancer pools at a fraction of the cost versus trading on other platforms. Balancer's mission is to become the primary source of liquidity in D five by providing the most flexible and powerful platform for asset management and decentralized exchange. Dive into the balancer pools at app Balancer fi Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make. My crypto buys and sells.
01:10:16.782 - 01:10:57.818, Speaker B: Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens. And it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset.
01:10:57.818 - 01:11:30.374, Speaker B: When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH. So whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of eth bonus back to me. At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com. Gobankless all right, guys, and we are back into the ecosystem takes that have come out in the last week. This one comes from Eric Connor, who has a bunch of screenshots from a different bitcoin maxis.
01:11:30.374 - 01:12:37.498, Speaker B: And he says the bitcoin community has gotten so pathetic that they have actively begged regulators to classify ETH as a security. This has been going on for years. And then he has some examples. And so he has some examples of some of the most maximalists of the bitcoin Maxi camp, Samson Mao from Blockstream, Neil Jacobs Pierce, I can't remember his last name, talking all about how ether is a security and making jokes about how ether is a security and then asking Gary Gensler to classify ETH as a security. And I want the listeners to, and here's why I feel so passionate about this. I want the listeners to think about the SEC is supposed to protect individuals, investor protections. Who is protected? If ether gets classified as a security or if ether gets classified as a security, is this just bitcoin maximalists being really happy that the second largest, biggest threat to bitcoin is being classified as a security? Do they care about investor protections, or are they trying to cope with the fact that Ethereum is extremely successful.
01:12:37.498 - 01:13:05.574, Speaker B: And so I really just want shame on bitcoin maxis who are trying to protect their own bags by begging Gary Gensler to classify ether as a security when they should be focusing on themselves, focusing on their own merits, focusing on their own blockchain, rather than looking over the fence and being jealous about all the cool things happening on ethereum. And they get jealous about it. And so they beg Gary Gensler to classify ETH as a security because they're insecure about their bags. That's my take about Eric's take about the bitcoin maxi takes.
01:13:05.772 - 01:13:10.394, Speaker A: Yeah. And ultimately I would just say it doesn't really matter what they think, right?
01:13:10.512 - 01:13:12.170, Speaker B: They don't get embarrassing.
01:13:12.510 - 01:13:51.894, Speaker A: The CFTC chair also pushed back in general, and this is partially in response to, I think, Gary Gensler's comments about certain icos being securities. And he hey, like many cryptos are actually commodities and the SEC has no jurisdiction over the things that are commodities. Bitcoin is a commodity. CFTC has said as much, so is ether. The CFTC has said as much. So I'm not even sure why this is a conversation. Maybe you could have this conversation in certainly 2015, 2016, maybe 2017, but this conversation has already been had, right? It's over, it's done.
01:13:51.894 - 01:14:06.006, Speaker A: The CFTC are the regulators for ether, the asset, and bitcoin maximalists don't get to decide. So it just seems like a bunch of cope and I don't know, man, massive cope.
01:14:06.038 - 01:14:49.090, Speaker B: Massive. Understand, Samson Mao is the guy behind liquid, which is basically trying to be the ethereum version of bitcoin as a sidechain, which is already just compromised on the values. But bitcoiners are known for being the cipher punks who are very anti regulation like extremely nation state. They're one of the anti nation state. There's one of the reasons why this whole entire industry has that branding in the first place, even though I don't agree with it yet, they are begging the nation state to protect their incumbent investments by classifying ETH as a security. To me, it's no different than the bankers having regulation against our industry trying to protect them. The bitcoin maxis are just trying to do it for their own purposes.
01:14:49.090 - 01:14:55.260, Speaker B: It's just embarrassing. It's a compromise on their values, compromise on their ethos, and it's just a bad look for the space.
01:14:55.790 - 01:15:16.138, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. Ultimately won't amount to anything, but I agree it's a bad look. David, let's take Jeff Dormant's take. So what's his take? Away from everything that's going on. So all of the news, he said his internal slack is blowing up with tons of positive information about crypto, but also negative information about crypto. What's his takeaway? David?
01:15:16.234 - 01:15:36.018, Speaker B: Yeah, Jeff, dormant. We had him on to talk about Coinbase when Coinbase went public. That was a fantastic episode. His takeaway is that it doesn't matter. Positive negative news. Every single news outlet and investor in the world is now talking about digital assets every single day. And he finished this up with betting against growth from here would be insane.
01:15:36.018 - 01:15:48.026, Speaker B: And so this is why I've been saying, like regulation, it's finally here and it's bullish. It doesn't matter what it is. Good regulation, bad regulation. We prefer good regulation. It's bullish either way. Just because the attention is on the.
01:15:48.048 - 01:16:10.322, Speaker A: Space, they are not ignoring crypto any longer. They are forced to reckon with it. And that is bullish for the space, for sure. Let's do this take. It's kind of a regulatory take, I suppose, but this is from Joseph Young. Binance futures trading, not allowed in Germany and Italy, is one of the biggest advertisements for DeFi this year. I could not agree more.
01:16:10.322 - 01:16:36.150, Speaker A: That binance squeeze we've been talking about, where binance has to delist assets, is not available in certain countries. That's just pointing the world to defi. This is why we need Defi. We need something that is outside of the borders of a nation state, that doesn't have a geographic jurisdiction or a geographic location, that's just public, freely available to anyone with an Internet connection. Huge advertisement for Defi.
01:16:36.230 - 01:16:54.160, Speaker B: And this also largely impacts binance smart chain just as well, because the only on ramp to binance smart chain is through binance. And so if binance gets restricted, binance smart chain gets restricted. Which is why we were always harping on binance smart chain in the first place, because it's just a masquerading as decentralized, even though it's actually not.
01:16:54.610 - 01:17:06.050, Speaker A: Yep, absolutely. Let's see this next take. This is from Tasha. She has a whole thread about this. I just thought it was a fantastic thread. And the crux of it is this. Maybe I'll read the first tweet or so.
01:17:06.050 - 01:17:33.610, Speaker A: The US is in big trouble with twin deficits and high debt. We know that, but few realize that Fed issued digital currency USD token can change the fate of America. How? She says, grab a coffee and read on. Do not have time to read the entire thread, but she makes the case that actually the biggest export from the US is not technology export. It's not a manufacturing export. It's not like military arms dealing. You know what the biggest export is, David?
01:17:33.690 - 01:17:34.634, Speaker B: The dollar.
01:17:34.762 - 01:18:11.394, Speaker A: The US dollar. That's what the US is exporting to the world right now. Everybody wants the US dollar right now. That's not necessarily a long term product. So Tasha says we might have, like, 15 to 20 years or so left to go on the US dollars reserve currency status. But she said the US should use that while it can essentially, and create a central bank digital currency of some sort, support crypto in some way, and export this to the world to stay ahead. If they don't, per our previous conversation, man, China will, and they're in it to win it.
01:18:11.394 - 01:18:18.762, Speaker A: The US has this asset. Why not use it? They absolutely should. I thought it's a brilliant take. We'll include that thread in the show notes here.
01:18:18.816 - 01:18:31.274, Speaker B: The TLDR is that the american empire has its interests and it can use crypto to leverage those interests rather than fighting it. And if it does choose to fight it, it's just going to hasten its own demise.
01:18:31.402 - 01:18:32.080, Speaker A: Absolutely.
01:18:33.250 - 01:18:35.438, Speaker B: All right, David, this is a good one.
01:18:35.524 - 01:18:50.146, Speaker A: Yeah, I thought this was. Look, so we've been talking about EIP 15 five nine. By the way, David, how much have we burnt since the start of this recording? While you're looking that up, I think EIP 15 five nine. I said, this is the ultimate jujitsu move for Ethereum.
01:18:50.258 - 01:18:51.426, Speaker B: Why, God, dude?
01:18:51.538 - 01:19:18.814, Speaker A: Because in order to copy it, competitors have to get the one thing they've never had, and that is actual block space demand, David. So you can't copy and paste this EIP 15 five nine feature. Like, sure, you can start burning some of your transaction fees, but you have to have transaction fees to burn in order for it to be meaningful. Now, you're about to tell me that the number of eth that has been burnt since the beginning of this episode, how much is it? Yes, I'm going to say it was.
01:19:18.852 - 01:19:23.680, Speaker B: 880 since we last talked, I believe. How much do you think is that now?
01:19:24.050 - 01:19:28.210, Speaker A: Okay, so I said 200. 950. How about that?
01:19:28.280 - 01:19:34.002, Speaker B: So gas prices have jumped significantly since then. Gas prices are currently at 277. So something's going on.
01:19:34.056 - 01:19:34.462, Speaker A: Yikes.
01:19:34.526 - 01:19:47.382, Speaker B: Whoa. And the most recent block that just got mined burned five ether. We are at 1500 ether. We are at 1500 ether. What happened for the last few? I don't know. Something's going on. Something's going on.
01:19:47.436 - 01:19:47.990, Speaker A: Check the price.
01:19:48.060 - 01:19:59.290, Speaker B: Nft. Yeah. Holy shit. Is it up or down? I have no clue, but, yeah, for the last, like, 1020 all the blocks that I can see right now have burned more ether than issued.
01:19:59.870 - 01:20:00.614, Speaker A: That's insane.
01:20:00.662 - 01:20:03.702, Speaker B: That's insane. I don't know what's going on, but bullish. Bullish.
01:20:03.766 - 01:20:06.302, Speaker A: Okay. And here's the thing that's not the price.
01:20:06.356 - 01:20:07.178, Speaker B: Price is stable.
01:20:07.274 - 01:20:51.402, Speaker A: The thing that's impossible to emulate and the reason why this is a jujitsu move for Ethereum versus all eth killers other competitors is Ethereum's biggest strength, blocks based demand. People will pay to get a transaction in, and they've been building this for the last five or six years. It's already flipping a bitcoin by far on that count. No other chain is even close in terms of transaction volume. Right? Like, in terms of block space revenue or demand, Ethereum is the only chain that can essentially pull off EIP 15 five nine and use it and pump it into its asset. So, dude, gameset match, right? I mean, you got to work hard and get that block space demand. That's how you compete against Ethereum if you want to do that.
01:20:51.402 - 01:20:51.818, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:20:51.904 - 01:21:17.902, Speaker B: The avalanche community has always been teasing Ethereum about how they implemented EIP 1559 on avalanche like nine months ago. And in the first 3 hours of EIP 1559 going live on Ethereum, more ether was burned than in all of nine months of avalanche's EIP 1559 being live, right? And so, like, cool, you guys got it first, but it takes 2 seconds for us to catch up with you once it goes live. And that's the power of blocks based demand.
01:21:18.046 - 01:21:26.086, Speaker A: You got to put the hard work in, and the hard work is block space demand. So get there. Let's see this last take from Hasu. David, why don't you read it out? Yeah.
01:21:26.108 - 01:21:52.762, Speaker B: Hasu says success is a muscle. Every important upgrade that Ethereum has successfully merged, the beacon chain. Now EIP 1559 increases the chance that future important upgrades, the merge, sharding block proposer builder separation, will also be successful. Another way of framing it, Eth prices in a ton of execution risk. I know because that was a big part of my own thesis. Every milestone makes that execution risk go down. This is what we have been saying on bankless forever.
01:21:52.762 - 01:22:33.982, Speaker B: If you're cool with execution risk, buy Eth early. But every time we successfully hard fork, that execution risk goes down. Right? And so you should plan for that accordingly in your valuation of ether. And honestly, at this point, with the beacon chain behind us and EIP 1559 behind us, two very complicated updates in the rear view mirror. The last major update is the merge and maybe sharding but not that major and very distant off into the future. How much execution risk is left before people Fomo? And maybe that's why people have been definitely fomoing into ether. Right after EIP 1559 went live and ether went from 26 to 2800 in just an hour or so.
01:22:33.982 - 01:22:46.974, Speaker B: Success is a muscle. Ethereum is proven out that it executes upon its roadmap. Maybe late, but it does execute. And so betting against Ethereum at this point is just completely irrational in my opinion.
01:22:47.102 - 01:22:51.266, Speaker A: There you go. Got nothing to add. David, what's exciting this week for you?
01:22:51.448 - 01:23:33.262, Speaker B: EIP 1559, sir, I would like to go back two years and say there was a time where EIP 1559 got introduced. A few people latched onto it. You, me, Anthony Cesano, air Connor who introduced it, DC investor, a few others. They all saw the power in this. We all wrote articles, we made podcasts, we tweeted about it, we tried to do our best to shout from the rooftops like this is coming. And now it's finally here, which makes me feel really good, is one important step forward to ether as ultrasound money. And what really excites me that's specific and nuanced, other than just saying EIP 1559 is here, is that EIP 1559 has so much metric surface area.
01:23:33.262 - 01:24:06.422, Speaker B: There are so many new metrics that have come alive now that EIP 1559 is here. Eth burn rate, the base fee, the tip amounts, how full the block is. There are so many things and numbers and variables to talk about. And honestly, what gives more people more confidence in an unknown asset are like numbers and metrics to consume and analyze and discuss. And not only that, it gives new people confidence, it gives older people like us more things to talk about. This is what I said earlier. There's so many more metrics that we get to talk about on the weekly roll up.
01:24:06.422 - 01:24:31.810, Speaker B: So we're going to go back and talk about how much ETH has burned. It's probably going going to be part of every single week. Since we last talked about how much ETH was burned, we have burned 70 more ETH. So that's pretty cool. And so all of these metrics are legitimizing in of themselves, even though we literally invented them out of thin air. The industry invented this thing called crypto economics. Ethereum invented this thing called EIP 1559.
01:24:31.810 - 01:24:39.186, Speaker B: Now we've invented this metric called ETH burn rate. And now because we get to talk about it, it's legitimizing, it's cool. People get to talk about it.
01:24:39.288 - 01:24:48.710, Speaker A: I can't wait to read all about it in Goldman Sachs next white paper on why you should invest in ETH. We're going to see burn metrics in these analyst papers now. Super cool.
01:24:48.780 - 01:24:52.326, Speaker B: Yeah. Ryan, I think I have a guess what you're excited about. Why don't you tell me?
01:24:52.428 - 01:24:54.682, Speaker A: Look, man, it's got to be EIP 15 five nine.
01:24:54.736 - 01:24:55.258, Speaker B: Oh, really?
01:24:55.344 - 01:25:19.678, Speaker A: EIP 15 five nine. Roll up. And I'm just going to riff on what you said. I feel like coming off of the 2017 2018 crash, right? I think a lot of people recognized that the Ethereum network was amazing. And there was this whole mantra of Ethereum, not ETH. Like Ethereum, the network is amazing. Ethy asset, who cares? That thing sucks.
01:25:19.678 - 01:25:43.658, Speaker A: Buy bitcoin instead. Just a means to an end. And some of us felt like that was a massive mistake. It didn't even make sense. Doesn't make economic sense. If you are striving to become a strong, highly secure economic network, you need the price of ETH to reflect that as well. That's where you get your economic security.
01:25:43.658 - 01:26:20.162, Speaker A: And so we pushed back against that. I think there was this concept, David, do you remember, of economic abstraction, right? The idea that we don't even need ETH to even pay for miners. Why is it even there? It can collapse to basically zero and no one would care. We can use stablecoin or maybe bitcoin to pay miners. We pushed against that. Well, now we no longer have economic abstraction like, I think we've never had it in reality, but the protocol has enshrined what's the opposite of abstraction like concreteness. Now have economic concreteness of ethy asset.
01:26:20.226 - 01:26:21.666, Speaker B: I don't think that meme is going to stick.
01:26:21.778 - 01:26:59.070, Speaker A: I don't think it's going to stick either. But that's what we have. And this is really exciting because I think there's been a renewed emphasis at the protocol level on ethy asset that we've been pushing for since 20 18 20 19 20 20 20 21 now it's here. It's being baked into the protocol and it's just super exciting to see. And this is why it's important is because the end game, we want to build a bankless, open financial system for everyone. And in order to do that, we need high security. Right? We need the economic bandwidth to support all of the world's assets, all of the world's transactions.
01:26:59.070 - 01:27:25.350, Speaker A: And man, that chink in the armor that ETH had, where it had a great network, didn't have a great asset completely, like, equalizing. Now. You got the ying and the Yang. You got a great network. You also have a fantastic asset, and people are starting to realize that, and I think they'll realize it more as those metrics are going to be displayed everywhere. And we're going to keep refreshing those burn pages to see how much eth we're going to burge. And then it's onward towards the merge.
01:27:25.350 - 01:27:38.542, Speaker A: That's the next live stream we're doing. David, in the live stream this morning. Last question for you. Did you hear the dates? What are the anticipated dates for the ETH to merge? And the end of proof of work. What do you think that's going to be?
01:27:38.596 - 01:27:59.350, Speaker B: Yeah. Justin Drake, who's famous for giving out dates a little bit ahead of consensus, said Q one 2022, which is the date I've been giving out more or less. If we hit it in Q one 2022, that would be actually the first hard fork that we actually got on schedule for some reason. Maybe I'm naive. I actually believe in it. So Q one 2022.
01:27:59.500 - 01:28:16.618, Speaker A: All right. I thought we had a good shot of hitting July for EIP 15 five nine. And that was like some early estimates, like two months off. So still pretty close. Right. And I think this is going to be, if it's not Q one 2022, it's got to be Q two. It's going to be really close to Q one anyway.
01:28:16.704 - 01:28:23.238, Speaker B: Just like Hazu said, success is a muscle. And now our core developers are getting better and better and better at hitting hard fork deadlines.
01:28:23.334 - 01:28:24.326, Speaker A: Yeah, totally.
01:28:24.438 - 01:28:27.598, Speaker B: Even though there's on a deadline, but, like, not delaying too much.
01:28:27.764 - 01:28:37.006, Speaker A: David, let's talk meme of the week. Man. What is the meme of the week? I'm going to share my screen. This is one from Robert Leshner and some of the Defi builders, some of the crypto native builders. Right.
01:28:37.028 - 01:29:11.174, Speaker B: So Robert Leshner randomly tweets out who is in crypto in New York City right this second and wearing blue, I need you for a mission. And then later, Hayden Adams tweets out this photo, how it started, and then new photo, how's it going? And so the first photo is that weird meme going around of Bill Murray, plus three other actors, kind of just like all awkwardly standing weirdly, plus with interesting outfits. And there's this one lady in this very vibrant, fiery blue suit, looked like an absolute rock star. And then everyone kind of has their own deal going on. Nothing really makes any sense.
01:29:11.232 - 01:29:13.520, Speaker A: Feeling on this. This is definitely a vibe going on.
01:29:14.450 - 01:29:39.842, Speaker B: Looks like there's four vibes going on for every four actors. And then Robert and Hayden Adams tweets this out from left to right. We got Hayden Adams, we got Kane from synthetics. We got James Johnson from Pleaserdale, and then we got Robert Leshner on the right. And they are just recreating the meme, which is hilarious because this is a decentralized industry. Kane is from Australia. Hayden is from New York.
01:29:39.842 - 01:30:08.730, Speaker B: Robert Leshner, I'm pretty sure, is from San Francisco. And they all made it happen. And then, interestingly, Kane was the only person that had a white haired crypto punk before this image. But for some reason, they all decided to buy white haired cryptopunks and put it as their avatar. And so now this is the white haired crypto punks moment. The other cool, interesting little bit, little Easter egg in this photo is that Bill Murray, for some reason, is wearing two watches, and so is Robert Leschner, the person that's Bill Murray. Correlate.
01:30:08.730 - 01:30:24.594, Speaker B: Yeah, Robert Leschner got two watches on. I think this was a fun little moment when Robert Leshner tweets out who's in New York City wearing blue. Right this moment, we get James Johnson showing up looking like an absolute g in a blue suit. I thought that was pretty cool.
01:30:24.712 - 01:30:39.302, Speaker A: Yeah, that's awesome. All right, guys, this has been the weekly roll up special edition, Eip 15, five nine. As always, none of this was financial advice. ETH is risky. Crypto is risky. All of DFI is risky. You could definitely lose what you put in.
01:30:39.302 - 01:30:48.106, Speaker A: But we are headed west and we like it west. We're okay with heading west. Thanks for joining us on the bankless journey. See you later.
