00:00:03.130 - 00:00:39.586, Speaker A: Welcome to Layer Zero. Layer Zero is a podcast of unscripted conversations with the people that make up the Ethereum community. Crypto is built by code, but it's composed by people, and each individual member of the crypto community has their own story to tell. The cipherpunks understood that the code they write impacts the people that use it, and Layer Zero focuses on the people behind the code, because Ethereum is people all the way down and always has been. Today on Layer Zero, I'm talking to Amin Soleimani, and I've said his name on the bankless podcast a number of times before. He's been on the bankless podcast a number of times before. He helped meme Molok into existence in 2018 and 2019.
00:00:39.586 - 00:01:50.560, Speaker A: He's the creator of Molok Dow, one of the first dows to come out of Ethereum after the Dow. And he makes this joke about how he made Molok Dow with many purposes, one of them being to help the Ethereum community get over what he calls PTSDao, as in PTSD over the 2016 Dow that caused the Ethereum classic hard fork. So we talk about Molok coordination dows, and what dows can do for the landscape of both Ethereum when it comes to coordination, but also for the broader world. And really why Ethereum is just coordination tools all the way down. But then we get into some broader subjects, such as his recent fight against the Federal Reserve and how the Federal Reserve has this relationship with the broader world that is unsavory and how we as a people need to resist what is going on with this Federal reserve. And Amin has always been a very big patterns thinker, a big philosophical person who can see the biggest patterns that the world has put in front of us and sees them for what they are. And he's a pretty controversial guy.
00:01:50.560 - 00:02:59.042, Speaker A: He's pretty sharp around the edges. He's definitely not afraid of putting his foot down and making people be very uncomfortable. So I actually do not recommend that you listen to this episode with kids in the car or young ones who aren't ready for very mature subjects. But even though Amin definitely has his controversies, he's a hero of mine through and through for the way that he thinks and what he thinks about and the lessons that he brings to the table, because they're very emblematic of this particular podcast, why I call it layer zero, because he gets down to the bottom of things in a very fast, sometimes crude but effective way. So I hope you enjoy this episode with Amin Soleimani, and we'll get to that conversation right after we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. Arbitrum is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution that is going to completely change how we use DFI and NFTs. Some of the coolest new NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home, while DFI protocols continue to see increased liquidity and usage, you can now bridge straight into arbitram from more than ten different exchanges, including finance, FTX, Huobi and crypto.com.
00:02:59.042 - 00:03:44.974, Speaker A: Once on Arbitrum, you'll enjoy fast transactions with cheap fees, allowing you to explore new frontiers of the crypto universe. New to Arbitrum for a limited time, you can get Arbitrum NFTs, designed by the famous artists Ratwell and Sugoy, for joining the Arbitrum Odyssey.

You can also bridge your assets to Arbitrum at Bridge Arbitrum IO and access all of Arbitrum's apps at Portal Arbitrum one in order to experience DFI and nfts the way it was always meant to be, fast, cheap, secure and fiction free. The Brave browser is the user first browser for the web3 Internet with over 60 million monthly active users. And inside the brave browser, you'll find the brave wallet, the secure, multitrain crypto wallet built right into the browser.
00:03:44.974 - 00:04:10.534, Speaker A: Web three is freedom from big tech and Wall street, more control and better privacy. But there's a weak point in web3. Your crypto wallet and most crypto wallets are browser extensions which can easily be spoofed. But the brave wallet is different. No extensions are required, which gives brave browser an extra level of security versus other wallets. Brave wallet is your secure passport for the possibilities of web3 and supports multiple chains, including Ethereum and Salana. You can even buy crypto directly inside the wallet with ramp.
00:04:10.534 - 00:04:39.042, Speaker A: And of course, you can store, send, and swap your crypto assets, manage your NFTs, and connect to other wallets and DFI apps. So whether you're new to crypto or you're a seasoned pro, it's time to ditch those risky extensions. And it's time to switch to the brave wallet.

How's it going?
00:05:05.940 - 00:05:07.918, Speaker B: Great. Thanks for having me.
00:05:08.084 - 00:05:10.462, Speaker A: It's quite the eccentric background you've got there.
00:05:10.516 - 00:05:13.150, Speaker B: Yeah, had to fit the unicorn into the picture.
00:05:13.990 - 00:05:16.034, Speaker A: Is that a chair that you're on?
00:05:16.232 - 00:05:20.660, Speaker B: Yes, this is a nice little pink throny chair thing.
00:05:22.310 - 00:05:47.420, Speaker A: We'll get into all of that and more. But for listeners who came in perhaps in 2021 or beyond, the most recent cohort of crypto listeners, content consumers, they might not be as familiar with you as I once was when I first got into this space. Can you explain your perch in the Ethereum and broader crypto ecosystem? What would you say that you do here?
00:05:49.710 - 00:06:34.060, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm the CEO of Spank chain, which was one of the first attempts to bring the benefits of crypto to the adult community. So from that perch, I get to sort know. It's like a libertarian viewpoint, how to make things useful for everyday people. Not so much like the grander things, too. But, yeah, that stuff's more about helping sex workers use ethereum tools, keep their money safe and so forth. Sell nfts. But we do some other things, too.
00:06:34.060 - 00:07:19.370, Speaker B: We made the first l two spank live, so that was a fun opportunity to learn about putting l two s in production four years ago, a lot of lessons learned that we've been able to use. Now, four years later, when it's like, finally time for L2s, I try to focus on the types of things that people aren't and where the blind spots were, too. So we started Malik dao. Back in the day, ethereum was very utopian, and I was concerned that our utopianism wasn't going to be very scalable or sustainable forever.
00:07:21.710 - 00:07:45.700, Speaker A: Yeah, go into that a little bit more. One of the things that brought me into Ethereum is just how optimistic and perhaps utopian is the right word, everyone is. It's like. It's infectious, like everyone's really generally happy and accepting but I think perhaps somewhere to our own naiveness. Naivete. When you come into Ethereum and you see the culture here, what do you see?
00:07:47.270 - 00:09:20.090, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw a lot of well wishing sort of people, right? It's like we prided ourselves for years about being a very welcoming community, about being very friendly. And it led to the Ethereum community getting hacked in sort of predictable ways by people who were upfront, very friendly, but then had sort of their own intentions and goals that were maybe not aligned with the Ethereum community. And so a lot of the Kumbaya culture isn't very well designed around adversarial thinking and things like that. And so the idea of Malik was very appealing to me because it described these sort of like game theoretic traps where you have to make some sacrifice of something you value because everybody else does. And Ethereum doesn't exist in a vacuum. It would be nice if it did, but it's still subject to the competitive forces that drive everything else. And so if we want our values of pro social and positive sum to expand to the rest of the world, we sort of have to compete to protect them and to advance them against other things that might try to outcompete them that don't have those values.
00:09:20.090 - 00:09:54.810, Speaker B: And I saw a lot of people taking this idea for granted that Ethereum was just like the best. It was going to dominate forever and it was just going to win because we're the good guys. And in my experience, that's not how anything works. It's nice when the good guys win, but it's typically because they're more powerful than the bad guys. It's not because they are nicer than the bad guys. I don't know, you could make the case that they could coordinate better, but yeah, that's getting sort of deeper into the subject.
00:09:58.910 - 00:10:59.470, Speaker A: Having watched you being a leader for me in the space with just like how you think and your writing, it seems very appropriate that you are the person to be beating this drum of adversarial thinking of this guy who's doing this Ico Spang chain that really just throws people off. And we're supposedly doing this very professional thing of trying to build a platform for payment channels. But what do we do with that thing? Oh, we apply it to making sex workers lives easier. And then you have this air about you that's very. I kind of find Ethereum aligned in that we're here to move the needle of humanity, but we're not going to take ourselves too seriously while we do it. While this started off as like, what am I going to do with this payments technology? I'm going to go straight into sex work in 2017. And then that kind of also, I think, also relates to how you interface with the broader Ethereum community.
00:10:59.470 - 00:11:20.838, Speaker A: It was like, oh, everyone is in this growing the pie mentality, but I'm going to be like the hard liner that enforces adversarial thinking and thinking of everyone as an enemy, because all of you people aren't doing that. That's kind of how quickly and roughly summarize your activity in the space. Does that resonate with you?
00:11:21.004 - 00:11:58.258, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. It was basically a reaction to the prevailing utopianism that drove me to embrace the Moloch meme and feel compelled to share it. Because to be clear, I like the utopianism. I like the aspirational nature of Ethereum. I like the optimism. I think it's important to sprinkle it with a dose of realism. And also, there's other communities where the slang Moloch meme wouldn't have worked out because they don't care.
00:11:58.258 - 00:12:51.378, Speaker B: So maybe in other communities that are less mission oriented and more mercenary oriented, they don't care about slaying Molok. They're like, wait, I can trade my values for competitive advantage? Fuck yeah, that sounds great. Let's worship Malik and do that. Right? Is there a point to this whole blockchain stuff that beyond getting ourselves rich, I don't know, but who cares? But that's not what you feel in Ethereum. What you feel is like, we are advancing something that matters, right? And I also care about that goal, and I wanted to help advance it how I could. And that also meant acknowledging that it's not always going to be sunshine and roses. Sometimes it's not going to be great.
00:12:51.378 - 00:13:47.550, Speaker B: We actually have to make sacrifices. And if we want to keep advancing these values, then we have to fight for it. We have to outcompete the rest of the world. And so the paradox of Malik that I talk about sometimes is that we talk about slaying Maloch, but the paradox is that in order to get the power to do so, we sometimes have to worship at his altar, right? If we didn't at all strengthen ourselves or become competitive, then we just auto lose, right? So there's some middle ground between. And this is why it's a paradox is like, it doesn't fit very cleanly. You're like, I just want us to be the good guys. But it's like, no, it's like, if you have this value thing, you want to preserve, protect, advance.
00:13:47.550 - 00:14:03.020, Speaker B: You have to compete for it, fight for it, do all the things that you'd normally do. You just have to also preserve it, because that's the core thing that you're trying to. Yeah, I don't know if all that made sense.
00:14:04.110 - 00:14:41.014, Speaker A: We'll have to actually explain this Moloch meme. This is a meme that bankless has been just like, it's the banner that we kind of live under. But again, we haven't really talked about it in 2021, 2022, nearly as much as we did in earlier times. But maybe we could actually explain the Moloch meme by giving a history of its relationship with Ethereum, which is an intimate part of your own story with Ethereum. So maybe we can go back to where the Moloch meme was really just getting incepted into Ethereum culture for the first time, because you were really leading that charge. Could you take us back in time and start the story there?
00:14:41.132 - 00:15:22.510, Speaker B: Yeah. Malik means a couple things. So, I read the blog post, meditations on Malik by Slatesar Codex Scott Alexander. It's his rationalist blog post, and it describes the rationalist God of coordination failure. Put a word on anxiety I've had my whole life, which is like, why can't we all get along? Why can't we have nice things? And it's like, because people, and in these competitive situations, they have something that they can sacrifice, that they value in order to get an edge. And the end results is, everybody does it. And so you end up in these sort of unfortunate equilibriums, where, as a country, we want to spend money on guns and bombs and planes.
00:15:22.510 - 00:16:25.958, Speaker B: I'm sorry, we want to spend money on health care, education, and infrastructure, but we end up spending it on guns and bombs and planes, because we can't coordinate with everyone else to disarm at the same time. And even if we did coordinate with everyone else on the planet to disarm, then whoever is the last person with all the guns takes everybody else over. And then the world reflects their values, which is like, secretly amass a bunch of weapons. And so the whole disarmament wasn't very effective. Right? And Moloch is used as a shorthand to describe these coordination failures, where if we could all just work together and had some mechanism to do that, that would be great, and maybe we could reach better equilibrium. But because we don't, we have to compete and fight, and we're trapped in this less good equilibrium. And the story of how it relates to Ethereum is that I also discovered Ethereum, in the same week, discovered Molok, and then tried to bring these ideas because I realized that Ethereum was a platform for building coordination technology.
00:16:25.958 - 00:17:20.006, Speaker B: So, like, if you're in one of these unfortunate equilibrium, you want to get to the better equilibrium. How do you do it? Well, you need to come up with some game to coordinate with everybody else in order to advance this sort of better coordination stage. And so the tools for doing things like that are what Ethereum is all about, in my opinion. And so I was like, how do I get people to feel this thing that I feel right now? I'm going to call this Dow Molokdao. Hopefully, it'll get all these people to read this blog post, and we're like, several years downstream from that. And now there's comic books and more literature and memetics that are being developed around the Malik meme. And it's turned into a sort of rallying cry for the Ethereum community to coordinate around what is our own mission, what is our goal, and helped crystallize.
00:17:20.006 - 00:17:55.114, Speaker B: It's like, well, what do we do here, right? We build coordination tools. It's not about my country, my faith, whatever. It's about building things that allow us to progress past the coordination systems that we can even imagine today. Countries are great, but they have borders. Outside of the border, you're not really our friend. So it has a scalability limit to how far it can coordinate people. Same with faith.
00:17:55.114 - 00:19:10.540, Speaker B: Faith have heretics and non believers, so they run into limits on coordination. And so the idea is like, what if the big idea for things like Ethereum is like, well, how do we do better? What if we took country and faith and other types of group, nonprofit corporation? These are our starting points of coordination technology. And so the way that we slay Moloch is we improve on coordination technology itself. And that's a powerful thing, because I think we're used to being raised in this Us versus them mentality. Everybody is. And so trying to identify the traps of the US versus them, us versus them is kind of a psyop. So trying to figure out why is it us versus them in this specific way? How do we unlock more coordination value out of humanity? And when we started making dows, there were three dows, right? Moloch Dao was like Dow number four.
00:19:10.540 - 00:19:50.600, Speaker B: So we've had a great opportunity to sound like, complete, really out there, like heretics, nutcases or whatever. We're like, yeah, there's going to be 10,000 dows. Like, when we're on Dow number three. This is like stuff that we used to say with Eva and Peter and James Young and all the people who are like early Malik Dow because we could see the coordination potential that we could see about to be unlocked. We're like, people are going to flip when they figure out dows, right?
00:19:53.050 - 00:19:55.622, Speaker A: And this was back in 20, 18.
00:19:55.686 - 00:20:17.780, Speaker B: 19 yeah, we're like building it in 2018 being like, oh, my God, this is going to be so much fun. People are going to be so excited. And there's like ten dows by the end of the year. Yeah, 2019. It was like me and Peter in telegram groups, just like starting another dow every couple of weeks, like marketing Dow. And there was like, it was like a Dow for drinking events. It was like the kickback guys made it.
00:20:17.780 - 00:20:51.034, Speaker B: There was all sorts of dows. We made the Yang Dow just to pay some kids in Colorado to put up flyers and pay the deep fake memes for Andrew Yang. So between 2019 and now 2022 at East Denver, I helped Andrew Yang get inside the event because he was stuck outside the event. You were talking to him because you were talking to him about dows and about his lobby three dow. It was like a special event. And I was like, this is sweet. I want to go to Andrew Yang's event.
00:20:51.034 - 00:21:18.214, Speaker B: I helped start Yang Dow. Let's see where he's gotten in three years. So we just roll know. I'm like stuck outside ETH Denver and there's a dude in front of me wearing a suit. Like, who the fuck goes to ETH Denver wearing a suit? And event organizers wouldn't let him in. And I look over and it's like, yang, like, apparently running for president isn't enough to get into Denver. Turns out he'd, like, given somebody his badge or something.
00:21:18.214 - 00:21:59.794, Speaker B: So I was able to give him my badge to get him in and gave a great talk with you guys on stage. Yeah, it feels pretty cool to see all of that stuff happen. And then people research Molok. They're like, oh, look, it's like cool to have put that medic brick in this immutable wall and see that pay dividends in terms of recruiting people to be aligned with the original mission that we were trying to help people frame and understand. That was a long grant. I had a lot of caffeine. Thanks.
00:21:59.832 - 00:22:00.402, Speaker A: No, that was great.
00:22:00.456 - 00:22:03.634, Speaker B: Listening to all that, just to make.
00:22:03.672 - 00:22:32.010, Speaker A: It extremely explicit as to the connections being made here. But you said Ethereum is a platform to build coordination tools. And then you went through the history of Ethereum as it goes from three to 30,000 dows. We can extrapolate beyond 2020 to where we are today, where everyone, you can spin up a dow to buy a constitution if you so choose. But just like, can you just connect the dots on all of these things about Ethereum as coordination tools? Dows and Molok?
00:22:32.350 - 00:23:10.302, Speaker B: Yeah, so like Molok Dow was one of the first dows. The first one blew up, right? It was called the Dao. And it's why we have Ethereum, classic and hard fork. And we had Ptsdao. And so we made Moloch dao to be very simple and to just fund grants with ETH and do very little else. But between Molokdao itself was a whole ordeal. We were onboarding people with Etherscan at ETH Denver.
00:23:10.302 - 00:24:08.380, Speaker B: I was like manually typing in zeros is very early in the whole process. Now there's dow tools for basically spinning up everything, and there's a lot more flexibility. And it took a lot of people just grinding for years. We made Moloch Dao as a nonprofit just to do the grants with ETH, right? So it didn't have any of the other features. The original design for my investment, Dow, Molok Ventures, is closest to what is being released just now with Molok version three. So the version one was like just grants, just deposit ETH, couldn't do any other tokens, didn't have any proposal types, couldn't change the governance, couldn't do anything right. And that was to help address the security issues around launching these things because the last one had blown up and stuff.
00:24:11.230 - 00:24:39.560, Speaker A: It was what we really needed to get over what you just called our PTSD of just like, okay, let's eliminate all complexity and do one thing and one thing only, which is agree to coordinate as to where to send ether. And so all much surface area was just like stripped away because we as a community, still, when you said the word Dow, people would flinch because we almost blew up Ethereum had to hard fork away. So we needed this. Don't do that.
00:24:40.010 - 00:24:56.700, Speaker B: Sounds scary. Why would you do that? Did you see what happened to the other guys who did that? They got blown up. We're like, okay, relax. We'll just do it the dumb way, the simple way. We won't do anything complicated. And then other people would be like, we got this great feature idea for your dow. And we'd be like, that's a great idea.
00:24:56.700 - 00:25:35.734, Speaker B: We're not going to do it. Talk to me in a year. And so we had to run a grant stao for just a year, and it turned out to be the right thing to do, to advance the coordination culture, to have more people who'd done dows. And I have this mental model of progress. Maybe it's more relevant for open source stuff, but progress is a series of motivational equilibrium. I don't actually have to solve everything myself. I just have to push the ball to push the state of affairs to the next motivational equilibria, where there's more people, more motivated to solve all the problems.
00:25:35.734 - 00:26:17.282, Speaker B: And I feel like that's kind of what we accomplished with Molok v one. Just grants. Ran it for a year, got hustled basically, like 20 people for 100 ETH early on, raised a couple of mil, got ef consensus. Vitalik, Joe Lubin, put in a couple of mil, made some grants. Tornado, probably most important, bunch of other grants around e two. Helped give the first grant to the thing that is now protocol guild, back in its inception, did all that, but also helped meme dows, help people recover from PtsDao, helped educate people about how to dow. What does it mean? There's proposals.
00:26:17.282 - 00:26:54.926, Speaker B: There's a grace period you can exit, popularize the rage, quit as a way of embedding minority protections into your dow so that participants can leave with their share of assets at any time. And it took years for these concepts to proliferate and percolate in the ecosystem until now. There's lots of dows, there's investment dows, there's protocol dows. There's nonprofits, there's social clubs, and they run using different types of systems. Some are multi sigs. I'm like a Dow boomer at this point. So I'm like, all right, that's a multi sig.
00:26:54.926 - 00:28:07.960, Speaker B: Get off my lawn. But, yeah, people started coordinating, right? All of these are examples of coordination with Molok Dow. We raised money from, like, I don't know, 25, 30, some people in 1012 something different countries with no paperwork. Nobody signed anything. It would have been a lot harder to do the same type of thing in your meat space. I talk about these things as, like, your jurisdictional stack, right? So, in order to do the thing which Malik Tao did, which is allow you to pool money with a group of people, but also vote on proposals, and if you at any time, don't want to spend your money anymore, pull your money out without asking anyone, is impossible to do in Meadspace because you have to set up a bank account, hire lawyers, come up with bylaws, and then you have several people to do every process. You're like, oh, we would like, to collect signatures on a vote on this thing, okay, you have to go through some software carda, some management thing to collect signatures and authenticate people.
00:28:07.960 - 00:28:56.802, Speaker B: And you have to do that every time you want to spend money on anything. And then if somebody wants to leave, they have to ask for permission, and then you have to go through their lawyer to go through the banker and send a wire. And any of those steps could fail for whatever reason or get held up or frozen or censored. And the reason that people trusted the Malik Dao smart contracts was because they knew that they could push a button and the smart contract would release their money. They didn't have to talk to anybody. There's no jurisdictional stack of things that can fail, and that unlocks a lot of value. That overhead that isn't there now makes it so that it's viable to create a group like this to solve a problem that would otherwise have been not worth making a group like this to solve.
00:28:56.802 - 00:29:53.126, Speaker B: And so when I'm talking about unlocking coordination potential, that's the kind of stuff I'm talking about specifically, the coordination overhead is a number, and it gets smaller across all of the participants, needing to verify that other people have done stuff, that the treasury is accurate. These are all trust things that allow us to trust each other more quickly and allow groups to scale trust more quickly and execute their goals more easily. Nothing has changed, right between 2018, 2019, and now some more code has been written to make these things easier. But really what's happening is stories. I remember interviewing a coindesk reporter last year at MCON. I just got back from MCOn in Denver. So that's the Metacartel conference.
00:29:53.126 - 00:30:25.010, Speaker B: So they did MCon two this year. Last year, they did Mcon one. And I talked to this journalist, and they asked me what the limiting factor was for growth and more people thinking it's a good idea. And I said that the code is mostly there. The limiting factor is stories. People need to see the narratives develop. People need to see the story of somebody doing a dow, being successful, raising money for some cause, and then being able to imagine themselves as part of that story in their own way.
00:30:25.010 - 00:31:28.200, Speaker B: And until that happens, you can't recruit people because they don't have any examples of how to work with the framework. They're like, okay, you have a Dao. What do I do? Right? And so it's really important, I think, to push narratives forward. And so with Malik Dao, the story was an ETH dev didn't feel like going through the EF for grants, made his own dow for grants and started funding things to advance the ecosystem, and eventually got other people, including the EF, to buy in and operated his nonprofit using this technology with a community of people that were into it and protected their own minority rights, you can too. It was basically a non starter to consider using things like dows for nonprofits and stuff, until we had an example of us doing that in a successful way. So a lot of times you just got to go first.
00:31:31.130 - 00:32:01.540, Speaker A: One of the elements of why this works so well, you touched on it, and I want to double down on it, is this free ability to exit as an individual. And it's truly something that only is possible because of private keys, because of really the invention of being able to custody your own funds and have people ask you for permission, rather than you being the person to ask for permission. Let's double down on that. Why is that such a fundamental part about why all of this coordination stuff works in the first place?
00:32:02.310 - 00:32:32.460, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a great question. Custodying funds is great because it means you don't have to ask people for permission to use your money. Just very high level. Like, custodying funds is one of the core things that blockchains, specifically cryptocurrencies are about. Right. Even if DeFi and stuff doesn't work, it's like you don't want to have to call your bank to send a wire, and they're like, no. Right.
00:32:32.460 - 00:33:08.474, Speaker B: Basically, you never want that outcome. And the bitcoin network, so long as it remains censorship resistant, will never say no to you. Ethereum network will never say no to you. And then we can piggyback off of this custody property to do other cool and useful things. Right. So one of the differences between something like Malik Dao and something like a nonprofit with a bank account is that you have custody of your funds. This is also different.
00:33:08.474 - 00:33:46.222, Speaker B: If you use the multisig. Right. The operators, the signers of the multisig, are custodians of the funds. Right. But Malik Dao had this very unique new property called the rage quit, and that allowed you to maintain custody and sovereignty of your funds even while you pooled it with other people. And so that's an important thing, because it turns your donation to this nonprofit into more like a pledge, a revocable pledge. And so you can choose to exit.
00:33:46.222 - 00:34:04.202, Speaker B: If a proposal isn't going the way you wanted, you voted no. The rest of the Dow is like, well, we really just do want to spend money on this, and if you don't like it, so be it. You can be like, well, okay, fine. I accept that you guys are still going to fund this. I disagree. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm taking my money.
00:34:04.202 - 00:34:19.630, Speaker B: I don't want it to go for this cause. And I'm rage quitting. I'm exiting with my prorata share of the remaining funds. And so I'm out, right. And I had custody of my money. I didn't need to ask them for permission to do that. But it does also change this game theory.
00:34:19.630 - 00:35:18.820, Speaker B: If you've heard about the voice and exit, custodial systems have no exit. Right. You can have a voice. You can complain or ask for help or permission, but at the end of the day, unless you can exit, you're sort of trapped, and then you can be coerced. You can be forced to do things with your money that you do not consent to. And so being able to have custody over your money, even while it's in a dow, even while you've pooled it with other people, even while we can submit proposals and decide how to spend it together, but also retaining that ability to exit whenever you want, super important, because it makes it a lot easier to join in the first place. I'm basically willing to join any Malik Dao, because if it has a rage quit, I'm like, well, what's the worst that could happen? They submit a proposal, I don't like it, and I leave.
00:35:22.390 - 00:35:27.890, Speaker A: The cost of joining any Dow is as close to zero as it's basically a gas fee.
00:35:28.470 - 00:35:35.906, Speaker B: In theory. There's some social landscape of, like, oh, I joined now. I had to leave. I had to talk to people. But. Exactly, it opens up the landscape.
00:35:36.018 - 00:36:05.950, Speaker A: Right. And so joining a nonprofit has overhead. Right. So how many nonprofits can one person really manage their relationship with in their lives? Probably a single digit number. Probably even on the average person, no more than, like, two. But with dows, your participation in dows is really as many discords as you feel compelled to pay attention to, basically, yeah. And how does this change the relationship of the broader.org
00:36:05.950 - 00:36:29.402, Speaker A: with its individual members? Because now this is all about putting power into the hands of the individual. Right. Like the individuals always have. Well, maybe they don't have the most power, but organizations don't have power over the individual if there is that rage quit mechanism. So how does that change the nature of the organization? When that is the new equilibrium, it.
00:36:29.456 - 00:37:42.640, Speaker B: Makes it much more likely that the decisions of the organization will reflect the values of the individual members. You sort of get this. Like, all proposals are consensual implicitly, because everybody has the opportunity to leave if they disagree with any proposal. So the game theory of it works out that the organization is not incentivized to pass any proposals that they think will make a lot of the people leave. Because even if I can make this proposal pass, if you guys all leave, then I'm stuck paying for it and I might end up being paying more for it, right? So to the extent that I want to share the cost of things with you, it would behoove me to make sure that we're spending the money on things that generally benefit everybody. And if there's any imbalance, even per received imbalance, then the people will have the opportunity to rage, quit and make that known. And that disincentivize provides a feedback mechanism for the group.
00:37:42.640 - 00:38:12.662, Speaker B: Maybe the group just doubles down because now there's less outside conflict within the group, but also that's a good outcome for the group. For the remaining members. It's like we can actually build alignment over time by shedding some of the members who might be less aligned as we go. And so I think it's actually a good system for both the individual goals and the goals of the group.
00:38:12.796 - 00:38:57.782, Speaker A: ZK Sync is an Ethereum L2 network that is pushing the frontier of high performance blockchains that don't compromise on security or decentralization. Zksync has combined the power of zero knowledge rollups in the Ethereum virtual machine, enabling developers to build the greatest web3 projects possible, ones we haven't even seen yet. Crypto needs its killer applications to onboard the world, but crypto killer apps need Zksync as a platform to build on first. It's generally accepted that zero knowledge rollups are the conclusion of crypto blockchain scaling technology. And Zksync is leading the charge into the final frontier of crypto economics. So if you're a developer who wants to build your app on a future proof foundation which gives your users the best UX possible, check out zksync's website at zksync IO. And yes, there's also going to be a token, so give them a follow on Twitter too.
00:38:57.782 - 00:39:40.626, Speaker A: At zksync, Rocketpool is your decentralized ethereum staking protocol. You can stake your ETH in Rocketpool and get our ETH in return, allowing you to stake your ETH and use it in DFI at the same time. You can get 4% on your ETH by staking it with rocket pool, but you can get even more by running a node rocket pool is the only staking provider that allows anyone to permissionlessly join their network of validating ethereum nodes. Setting up your rocket pool node is easier than running a node solo, and you only need 16 e to get started. You get an extra 15% staking commission on the pooled ETH that uses your node to stake. You also get RpL token rewards on top. So if you're bullish e staking, you can boost your yield by adding your node to the decentralized rocket pool network, which currently has over 1000 independent node operators.
00:39:40.626 - 00:39:58.454, Speaker A: It's yield farming, but with Ethereum nodes, you can get started@rocketpool.net and you can also join the rocket pool community in their discord. You can find me hanging out there sometimes in the chat, so I'll see you there. Lens Protocol is an open source tech stack for building decentralized social media applications. It is the new era for social media. We all have toxic relationships with our web. Two apps.
00:39:58.454 - 00:40:20.414, Speaker A: We want to break up with them, but we can't. These applications own our digital lives and all the relationships that we've made. We need to break through to a new paradigm of social networking applications that we control rather than them controlling us. Lens isn't a social media app. It's a protocol to let a thousand web3 social apps bloom. Lens is a permissionless and transparent social graph that is owned by the user. In crypto, we say, not your keys, not your crypto.
00:40:20.414 - 00:40:58.094, Speaker A: And on lens, we say, not your keys, not your profile. With lens, your followers go with you to whatever social media application you want to use. And instead of being trapped by an algorithm chosen by that app, lens lets you choose the way you want to experience your social media. Lens is the last social media handle that you'll ever need to create. So in order to get started, there is a secret code word in the show notes. Enter that code word in the Google form link, and you'll be well on your way to entering the world of web3 social. And we can do a quick compare and contrast of other social systems, right? Where say, there's a Dow, maybe let's take the constitution Dow, just because that's kind of the big one that everyone knows about.
00:40:58.094 - 00:41:37.130, Speaker A: That's the most modern. And say, like the constitution, Dow leadership voted to pay themselves half the money in the treasury, and that's like eight of them. And say this vote actually goes through. Well, then there's the rage quit mechanism that all these people can rage quit before half their money gets paid to the leadership, right? Which makes this vote not even feasible in the first place to ever do. But we can compare this with, I don't know, maybe a nation state where the leadership of a nation state, since they're the ones that control the military, they can just say, hey, all gold is now illegal. You must pay it to us. And we now own all the gold.
00:41:37.130 - 00:41:55.218, Speaker A: It's harder for these individuals to exit, because it's one thing to exit from a dow by processing a transaction on Ethereum to get your money back, but it's another thing to process the exit from a nation state where you have your home and your family and your life and your culture. And so this thing is.
00:41:55.304 - 00:41:57.458, Speaker B: And they just took your gold. Yeah.
00:41:57.544 - 00:42:15.160, Speaker A: Right. We're doing an apples to oranges comparison here. But this is the difference between what is a systems that are free to exit and systems that have high cost to exit. It's like high cost to exit systems allow for opportunity to bully you around.
00:42:15.850 - 00:42:54.210, Speaker B: That's right. Yeah. The first question people ask is, when you try to get them into this type of thing, it's like, how do I leave? And the concern is, like, I don't want to be bullied by the other members. I don't want my funds to go to stuff that I don't want. So I either have to trust the other members or trust that I can leave. Trust the mechanism. And when you can trust the mechanism, it's a lot easier to spin these things up and start making grants and see how they go without as much overhead, without as much risk, without as much opportunity for coercion.
00:42:55.190 - 00:43:23.020, Speaker A: There's a line that I go back and forth with Kevin Owaki, and I believe also you, is that you don't actually kill Molok. You don't actually magically solve all coordination failure, but you can make Molok retreat. Right. Can you help us draw this connection between, like, all right, well, we didn't exactly buy the state of Dows in 2022. It's not like we've really solved coordination failure. We kind of just made a bunch of ponzies. Now we're in the bear market.
00:43:23.020 - 00:43:42.480, Speaker A: But also we have created a new system where Molok retreats. Right. Can you just explain going where? We have this new coordination platform, which is Ethereum. Now we have this new coordination primitive, which is Daos. How is Molok less deadly as a result of this?
00:43:44.450 - 00:44:16.510, Speaker B: I think, think the cool thing, maybe this is, like, a frustrating thing, but I started saying this more recently, is that I think it captures this concept fairly well. Slaying Molok is an infinite game. And what that means to me is that looming behind the rotting corpse of the most recently slain Moloch is like shadowier, deadlier Moloch waiting to strike.
00:44:17.170 - 00:44:20.238, Speaker A: Right? Moloch level two, Moloch level three.
00:44:20.404 - 00:45:10.634, Speaker B: And so it's like this endless series of boss fights, and we can just keep going and see what happens. And it's still worth playing this game because it still seems worth advancing coordination, because I think that's what it means to be human. The opposite of that is just like winning some intermittent zero sum game. We did all this dow stuff. Now we have to sort of, the way I see it now is we have Dow veterans now, right? So last year it was like freshman year, activity fair. Activity expo. You show up to college, there's booths everywhere.
00:45:10.634 - 00:45:50.720, Speaker B: You want to be in every club. You sign up for ten, you make it to the end of the semester, and you're lucky if you're still showing up to three or four, maybe less. And then this year is like sophomore year, right? Everybody's like, okay, we know how last year went. We will sign up for a couple of clubs, and we will stick with them, and we will make sure it's useful and not too much to handle and blah, blah, blah. And by junior year, you're, like, leading clubs. You have a leadership position. And I see everybody going through the same sort of progression that we did, which is like, we start out, we have no idea what we're doing.
00:45:50.720 - 00:46:52.266, Speaker B: We hope we're doing useful stuff, and then after a while, we figure it out. It's like, oh, flat organizations are kind of hard, or like, oh, this isn't just like a corporation on a blockchain. People who come from both sort of sides are having sort of trouble and are learning to build structures within the context of dows and figure out what processes work, how to do compensation. Right? And so there's cultural knowledge being built up in a thousand different groups at the same time about how to do all of this stuff. And that is what is going to anchor the next generation of Dao contributors and people. So in the same way that everybody who more or less joined Malik Dao went on to start some kind of dao, right? Peter started a bunch of dows. Cooper started a bunch of, you know, started bankless.
00:46:52.266 - 00:47:51.250, Speaker B: He was in, you know, so a lot of the people who have now come into dows as contributors, as tourists, get to learn and figure out what's going on, that it's not all just like these Dow guys haven't figured everything out. Right. We haven't just solved coordination, but we have discovered useful tools at coordinating better. And you can look at the amount of money raised or number of these groups that have formed and the excitement around them all as indicators that we're making progress. We're doing something right. And the things that will interest me more is like next generation. Right now we have plutocracy for basically everything, like token vote.
00:47:51.250 - 00:48:28.640, Speaker B: Vitalik writes about this inclusion resistance that we need more identifiable systems so that we can vote with people, have some amount of democracy in addition to having all of the plutocracy that we have. Nobody has really done that. Well, optimism is trying. They have their two tiered governance system. That's pretty cool to see. I think we'll see more structures form. Some might even be more centralized and have explicit CEO type or hegemon type.
00:48:28.640 - 00:49:18.874, Speaker B: And I think that if you zoom out, all of the things that we're building dows for right now are like toys and prototypes. The cool things is like, when is the United nations on? It's like, that's like our sort of terminal. When are international agreements on chain? I started reading for fun about the ancient dows, like the greek city state agreements that they made, the Peloponnesian League and the Delian League. These are the athenian and Spartan led Daos that they use to coordinate ancient Greece. And they have interesting policies. Sparta ran theirs differently than how Athens ran theirs. Like, Sparta is like, we're the hedgemen.
00:49:18.874 - 00:49:54.380, Speaker B: We're going to have a deal with every city state, and you sign a deal with us. We might not even really tell anybody else the terms, but you agree to have the same enemies and allies that we do as the sort of foundation of all of these. And then the athenian version, there's a little bit more democratic. They have like a council within Athens that they vote on proposals for. And then if those proposals pass, they go to the greater council with all the other city states, and then they try to pass them there. And Athens would often abstain. And there's interesting things about how they manage them.
00:49:54.380 - 00:50:23.700, Speaker B: And I think that's where this is going. Right? Maybe we aren't paying attention to it as much, but if it's not going there, I'll be really surprised, because this stuff is so useful that it will naturally find a home in the most high stakes environments eventually, once we've built these narratives and once we've done this infrastructure work and all that.
00:50:24.150 - 00:50:37.662, Speaker A: And really what you're talking about is like Ethereum, as this neutral middle ground between nation states or between the largest coordinating entities in the world. Is that the image that should be in listeners heads?
00:50:37.826 - 00:52:04.562, Speaker B: Yeah. Global settlement layer coordination platform for humanity, these kinds of things. When we say that, we kind of mean, yeah, it'll also settle your crypto punks and that stuff. But the goal, why do we care about censorship resistant, right? It's like, why do we care about neutrality? Like, the reason we care about these things is because we're trying to build a system that doesn't give specific advantages to one nation state or religious group or whatever, right? And it just sort of runs on math and does math things and can operate virtual machine and settle contracts, but doesn't care too much about contents of those contracts and so forth. Right. And that's sort of what you need to allow for. I don't know if I talked about this with you, but maybe I watch Vikings and the ancient game theory between kings is like they just have these hostage trades with their children, right? It's like ancient coordination in that era was like the way to make our behavior more mutually predictable to each other is to deposit our children into a two of two multisig such that we both need to work together to unlock the children.
00:52:04.562 - 00:52:26.154, Speaker B: And if we fail, they die. Like, what, everyone just went along with that? Because that was like the best system that had ever existed to that point. It's like savage, right? But it worked. And it's like you're just talking about.
00:52:26.192 - 00:52:35.760, Speaker A: Like, all right, you've got a daughter, I've got a son. We're going to put them in the same room, they're going to have babies, and we're going to stop hating each other. That's what you're talking about.
00:52:36.450 - 00:53:34.690, Speaker B: I'm talking about, I give you my son to raise and you give me your daughter to raise. But a lot of times they did also do marriage contracts, was down the road. And it was like, we'll raise your daughter for a time, or they'll both be in our place for three years and your place for three, and then doesn't serve as much for the coordination with each other, but yes, and if you could coordinate better, you might survive better because you would out coordinate the other guys who couldn't put their sons in a multi sig and therefore had a smaller army, right? It sounds dumb to say like that, but that's like how things worked, right? People were like, yeah, right, whatever. And if you didn't put your kids in a multi sig, you're like, bro, this alliance is suspect.
00:53:36.310 - 00:53:40.180, Speaker A: Our kids are not in multisigs together. There's nothing aligned here.
00:53:40.950 - 00:54:20.362, Speaker B: Yeah, basically. And so the question for things like Ethereum is, like, can we do this without being savages? Like, can we put ETH into a two of two multi thing? But can we make ETH neutral enough that people trust it enough to work as this bearer bond neutrally enforced by the system based on some contract? So in the future, maybe peace treaties or alliances or non aggression pacts would be seen as suspect if they don't have an on chain bond in a neutral currency.
00:54:20.506 - 00:55:08.986, Speaker A: Right. And so my head has gone to sweet. We are definitely beyond the barbaric era of using children as collateral. So we're now in democracies, but actually we have nuclear missiles pointed at every single corner of the globe. And people forget about that when they just are going about their day to day basis. But using children as collateral, definitely barbaric. But if that's barbaric, and we're using that as like, a facetious example of how to force coordination upon warring tribes, what the hell is this push button nuclear Armageddon that we have? How is that not just barbarism to the nth degree? And that's because this physical nation state world is based on physical rules of who's more powerful than the neighbors.
00:55:08.986 - 00:56:11.470, Speaker A: And you already gave the example of just like, we can't really just globally demilitarize because that just leaves the most brutal military as the one that's left standing. But that's because that's the physical world, right? Like an Ethereum and bitcoin, there is no stick. There are only carrots to incentivize coordination, because bitcoin incentivizes coordination by paying you bitcoins to mine it, right? Ethereum incentivizes security by locking up your ether, and then it will punish you if you try and attack the blockchain. And then dows, as we said, dows are like, so long as there's a rage quit mechanism built into them. And that's kind of like table stakes for dows, that there's no stick in the system. There's only opt in incentives. And so I don't know how we get all global tribes to coordinate with Ethereum, but whatever it is, it has to be, by definition, like an opt in carrot based system, because they don't have sticks.
00:56:11.470 - 00:56:15.010, Speaker A: Ethereum doesn't give you a stick because it's stuck inside of the Internet.
00:56:15.590 - 00:56:24.120, Speaker B: Yeah, at the protocol level, Ethereum doesn't have sticks. It only gives out carrots. You can think of a stick as, like, slashing but that's a.
00:56:24.730 - 00:56:26.530, Speaker A: You can opt out of that. You don't have to stake.
00:56:26.610 - 00:56:26.854, Speaker B: Right?
00:56:26.892 - 00:56:31.930, Speaker A: Yeah, you opt into the slashing. You don't have to opt out of the slashing.
00:56:32.510 - 00:57:12.534, Speaker B: If there was like a war treasury as part of the protocol fund, then maybe Ethereum could have a stick. The United States started without a stick too, in some sense, because it started not collecting taxes, like at the federal level. Didn't have a federal tax. It only added that later on. I don't think it's likely that Ethereum adds protocol level funding. I think it's even less likely that if we have it, it goes towards funding sticks. But, yeah, that's what you would need to do.
00:57:12.534 - 00:57:14.550, Speaker B: So it doesn't seem likely.
00:57:15.210 - 00:57:15.960, Speaker A: Right.
00:57:17.470 - 00:57:27.334, Speaker B: The US dollar is a protocol with a stick. Really big stick. It doesn't even really speak softly anymore.
00:57:27.462 - 00:57:28.140, Speaker A: Right.
00:57:30.450 - 00:58:10.790, Speaker B: Yeah, we like to blow up the whole dollar demand. Propping it up. Petrodollar thing is kind of weird. I went on a bunch of rants about this after the tornado stuff because I was angry and people were talking about how tornado was like the bad guys and how crimes are bad. And it's like, I agree that crimes are bad. There's just like nuance there, because a lot of things that were crimes aren't crimes anymore. Or we look back at them and we're really ashamed of them being crimes.
00:58:10.790 - 00:59:06.460, Speaker B: And we don't do the thing where we reward the entrepreneurs for their taking on the risk of breaking those crimes or laws or whatever in order to normalize and make progress for the rest of it. I order Marijuana in a store, I pay taxes. It's FDA approved to make sure it's very high concentration. And there's people still in jail for having small amounts of it, like years ago. A lot of times in the dollar bubble, we're like, we're the good guys because we're America, but we also do questionable things to enforce dollar demand, like blow up a rock to enforce the know, steal everybody's, you know, doing dollar redemptions. And then I'm getting the chronology a little bit out of order here, but.
00:59:07.390 - 00:59:10.700, Speaker A: It'S a long list.
00:59:11.070 - 01:00:04.750, Speaker B: It's not just the US. It's like every country sort of does. This is. This is maybe a segue into Rye. Like my other project, Rye is a fork of to try to see if we can make stablecoins without explicit pegs to the dollar. And so it is pegged to a dollar denominated number, but it's allowed to float. And Rye has been great so far because of what it's been able to teach us, where what we're doing on Ethereum, we want to believe that the systems that we're building are like improvements over the status quo, right? Bitcoin gets to say that, like, because of 21 million, they're transparent and it's not inflationary.
01:00:04.750 - 01:01:06.522, Speaker B: And the inflation doesn't benefit a specific cartel. Right. Ethereum gets to make similar statements, not quite as hard on the currency side, but we take some liberties because we have the utility of the smart contract platform, and so we optimize for making that as useful as possible. But we haven't solved money. And money is like the scam that every country runs on its citizens. And we have the privilege in the United States of not having it be as bad as most countries where the inflation is pretty bad and often increases unexpectedly. And you can't ask central bankers how to operate a central bank right now because the way that they do it is so bastardized from how it in theory should be done because they just have to manage their.
01:01:06.522 - 01:01:21.610, Speaker B: Most of them didn't come up with the scheme. They're just like, inherited some ponzi that they're trying to keep alive for as long as possible. And that's like, what they're judged on their job with Ethereum, with things like die.
01:01:21.630 - 01:01:32.810, Speaker A: The original idea, such an awesomely reductive way of explaining what the fed does is just like, prop up the Ponzi. And good feds promote the longevity of the Ponzi.
01:01:33.470 - 01:02:22.834, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll come back to that point. But, yeah, we haven't gotten past the dollar, right? Like, we have our USDC. We're like, yeah, we're defi. We had our dai, it was backed by ETH. At first we're like, yeah, we've decentralized finance, but it's still mostly dollars, right? And so we want to look at it and we want to be like, well, how do we get away from dollars? And there's a couple of ways, right? There's one which is like, well, back it with something else, right? You can have dollar denominated instrument, but that doesn't come with the USDC block lists. For example, if you use Dai or something, or even fracs. But with Dai, originally it was like, well, let's back it by ether.
01:02:22.834 - 01:02:42.320, Speaker B: And then the collateral can't be frozen, but then they back it with USDC, and then you're like, okay, well, shit, now what? And so that's why with Rye, it's backed only with ETH, but it's still, like, dollar denominated. So it's still somewhat subject to the esoteric policies of the Federal Reserve. It just can float around it.
01:02:42.790 - 01:02:48.334, Speaker A: You mean it's dollar denominated in the sense that if I ask you the price of rye, it would dollar.
01:02:48.382 - 01:03:17.686, Speaker B: And the interest rate is expressed in dollar terms, right? Yeah. And then it started at 3.14. It's like, floated down. I think it's like 2.85 now. And so it has a negative interest rate fairly consistently since the crash, to incentivize people to deposit ETH to help ribe holders or borrowers get out if they need to. That's what the elevated ribe signal on the market tells the system to do automatically.
01:03:17.686 - 01:04:10.380, Speaker B: We don't have to have meetings about this. We just let the controller run, sets the rates automatically. So this kind of thing is nice, because what Rye is, is it's like sort of a central bank in a box, and you can operate your little thing on the blockchain, your toy, first principles developed, central bank thing. And then you can use it, and then look at theirs and be like, how the fuck did you get there? What monstrosity have you wrought? If you try to explain how you get to the Fed and makerdow, starting from something like makerdow, you're like, okay, so first you have to rug pull the collateral. Nixon wants to drop bombs on Vietnam. You told everybody that the dollars were pegged to gold, including all the foreign countries that you promised that you would redeem. So we'd lie to everybody.
01:04:10.380 - 01:04:29.886, Speaker B: We really want to bomb Vietnam. So we print a bunch of dollars, bomb Vietnam, but now there's more dollars. Same amount of know. France comes calling with their battleship. Maybe it's someone else, but hello, Fort Knox. Like, give us the gold. And then Nixon's like, public announcement.
01:04:29.886 - 01:04:34.834, Speaker B: In order to defend the integrity of the US dollar, we are ending redemptions, right?
01:04:34.952 - 01:04:52.986, Speaker A: He did that because he heard that Charles Dugal II or somebody sent the battleship to go get the gold. And so the battleship was on the way to go get the gold, and Nixon was like, I'm closing the window. So you guys didn't make it in? Sorry, we're close. We're close for business.
01:04:53.168 - 01:05:36.710, Speaker B: Yeah, right? And then basically everybody scrambled. People started selling their dollars, and then the US came up with the petrodollar scheme. And so this was like the, let's pump the Ponzi on the demand know, let's find our pool two. And so their pool two was in Saudi Arabia, and they made deals with the Saudis and the other oil producing nations to sell oil exclusively for dollars. And they give discounts to allow the Saudis to reinvest in bonds and stocks and whatever. And they get military bases and f. So forth.
01:05:36.710 - 01:06:31.018, Speaker B: And so we did this to prop up the dollar in the face of. And so then it's like the reason I bring all of this up is because you need all of this context in order to have a moral conversation about the dollar. Because without all that, it's just like dollar good alternatives to dollar bad. And it's just like, oh my God, let's go down the list. And the reason I like to bring this up with Americans is because there's sort of like two places that you get to when you start thinking this through. You're like, okay, either we're like, full real politic, like, fuck yeah, America, World War One, World War II, back to back champs, right? Dollar Ponzi forever. It's the best ponzi ever.
01:06:31.018 - 01:07:37.978, Speaker B: We're winning, right? That's the mentality. Imperialism, we're the best at it, right? Versus the other, which is like acknowledging the dollar as like a cost in your moral balance sheet because you have to occasionally go blow up a rock because Saddam is selling oil for euros and we don't like that. And we want to set an example. And maybe the US empire is like a good thing generally for the world in terms of our ability to combat China, our ability to thwart Russia. If the US wasn't as powerful, Ukraine would have a much harder time, possibly also be Russia right now. Right? And so it's a good thing that the US has the strength to fight off these despotic invaders and authoritarian communists and these types of things. But then at least you've put the dollar Ponzi thing into a moral cost.
01:07:37.978 - 01:08:05.480, Speaker B: You're like, the cost of doing this is like, we have to do this stuff in order to be able to. And then at least that's like a more reasonable conversation you can have out of that because then you can be like, well, what happens when the US stops being like a good policeman internationally or something? Right? Maybe this isn't able to be propped up. It's not morally worth it or something.
01:08:07.290 - 01:08:20.262, Speaker A: But what you're saying is that at least you are having to consider the worth of it, as in, at least we are not just dumbly saying dollar good, we are actually doing a cost benefit analysis on this thing.
01:08:20.416 - 01:08:54.262, Speaker B: Yeah. And there's other things around this too, where it's like the dollar being strong in the sense that post 1970s petrodollar dollar, as the world reserve currency, hollowed out a lot of american manufacturing and middle class jobs and shipped them overseas because the currency valuations was more favorable for that. And so the US became a net exporter of dollars, and so the entire financier class made a killing, and everybody.
01:08:54.316 - 01:09:44.230, Speaker A: Else manufacturing class took the L. And I actually remember explicitly asking Lynn Alden if the Trifin dilemma, what we're talking about here, the fact that the dollar is the global reserve currency, was that the main source, main reason why Donald Trump got elected? And she was like, yes, I do believe that that's why that happened, because Donald Trump ran on that platform of manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Like, all these high manufacturing states that flipped red and elected Donald Trump, they lost all their manufacturing jobs because we just started exporting dollars for free because we were printing then. You know, it's like that domino meme down the line, because we have to export our dollars because of the, like, we lose all our. Of internal manufacturing jobs, and then we elect Donald Trump because we're aggrieved.
01:09:45.450 - 01:10:25.750, Speaker B: Yes, 100%. Yeah. These are like the things that are downstream of the currency scams and discontents. The currency manipulation, the decision that the US made as an empire was like, we're going to switch to being, like, a financial thing. We're going to just export dollars and play with money, and then it becomes really important to prop up demand for the dollar. Right, right. And the only real collateral we have because there's so much dollars, is dollar denominated debt.
01:10:25.750 - 01:10:27.926, Speaker B: Real bad.
01:10:28.108 - 01:10:29.814, Speaker A: Yeah. Right.
01:10:30.012 - 01:11:06.786, Speaker B: There's a story that I like to tell, and this is about Thomas Jefferson and slavery. And the reason I tell this story is because when we think about this, we think about this as a problem, that it's almost intractable. Right. You couldn't go protest this. Right? Okay. A lot of times when I talk to people, they seem to think that working inside the system is the best option for making change. Right.
01:11:06.786 - 01:11:46.302, Speaker B: And that almost every problem you can solve eventually by working inside the system. And I like to bring up the American south and slavery and civil war. Thomas Jefferson, the guy who wrote all men are created equal, he also came up with this really fascinating financial instrument, slave collateralized debt. He basically made maker dow for your slaves. So he rolled up to a bank and was like, yo, I've got all these slaves. I need money. Can I use the slaves as collateral and get cash? And the bank was like, interesting idea.
01:11:46.302 - 01:12:11.586, Speaker B: We're down. And fast forward 50, 60 years. The entire south was using huge amounts of loans backed by slave collateral. And so this was basically a slave ponzi that went out of control. They were yield farming. Like, literally yield farming, and that you'd leverage up, right? Oh, I got some money. Let me buy more slaves.
01:12:11.586 - 01:12:12.790, Speaker B: Let me get more debt.
01:12:14.730 - 01:12:21.226, Speaker A: Yield of the slaves to get more money, to get more slaves, to put more slaves as collateral and cycled it back up.
01:12:21.328 - 01:13:47.506, Speaker B: The slave population of West Virginia, I think, was like 60%, or maybe it was like South Carolina was 60% and Virginia was like 40%. So the slave populations had grown a lot, and every founding father, the banks were trading these contracts fast forward 56 years as if they're like mortgage backed securities today. They bundled. And so it's basically this bank enforced Ponzi at that point, right? Because it's not like the banks are going to let you off the hook, right? The banks aren't just going to allow you to Jubilee, right? So this is one of those cases where it's like, even if the political will existed, even if the moral will existed within that context, within the south, it didn't matter, because the economic reality was that you couldn't get everybody to pay back their debt at the same time in order to release their slaves. And not only that, they were terrified of their slaves because of how poorly they'd been treating them. This is why they made the clan and stuff after, is to continue terrorizing them as, like a first strike. But every founding father died knowing that the civil war was inevitable because there is no way within the system to get out of that slave debt.
01:13:47.506 - 01:14:17.790, Speaker B: Ponzi. Right? If you're a person in the south and you're like, hey, guys, I think this is a bad idea. We should stop doing this. You don't get very far. Everybody sort of has to be opposed to you. Even if they agree with you, they can't help you. Malik has gone too far.
01:14:17.790 - 01:14:21.486, Speaker B: Right, right. And so, like, the only path out is a.
01:14:21.508 - 01:14:23.290, Speaker A: Is a financial crisis.
01:14:23.450 - 01:14:38.600, Speaker B: The only path out is a financial crisis where the collateral, the slaves, are liberated at gunpoint. That's the only way out of that system. It's. It can't stop itself.
01:14:38.970 - 01:14:39.720, Speaker A: Right.
01:14:41.210 - 01:14:50.360, Speaker B: The mental model that comes out of that is like, sometimes wars have to be fought to end ponzies, right?
01:14:50.730 - 01:14:54.714, Speaker A: Oh, shit. I think I see where this is going.
01:14:54.832 - 01:15:28.040, Speaker B: You might see where this is going, because then it's, huh. Do we as Americans, have the political and moral will to end the dollar Ponzi within the United States? Because if we don't, then we should expect that people will try to end it for us. And that's going to look like war, and we probably deserve that war because it's not like we were going to do it ourselves. Right. That's like an awkward conclusion to come to as a good guy.
01:15:32.970 - 01:15:55.680, Speaker A: Okay, so what is this metaphor here? So there's a ton of debt out there, and we have been printing dollars to pay for cheap chinese goods and paying for cheap philippine labor. If we've been printing this dollar, and who are the people that really want the system to end?
01:15:56.450 - 01:16:46.880, Speaker B: So everybody that isn't the United States that has to use the dollars doesn't benefit from their own seniorage as much as they could. Right. Like, to the extent that, like, we go, you know, blow up a rock or something, we sort of, like, you know, like, to the extent that the dollar is the dominant reserve currency, we have exorbitant privilege with our senior edge. Our printing has a much larger market to absorb our printing. And so we're sort of taking that value from every other country that would otherwise be benefiting from their own senior edge in an increased capacity. But of course, it's more about the strategic rivals. Like Russia and China want to.
01:16:46.880 - 01:17:20.700, Speaker B: They're promoting, transacting using the. And the russian currencies. So, yeah, people also say there is no alternative. Like, what else would you do? Right. And I think that's, like, the thing that you else would like. The other thing you would do is, like, not invade a rock to prop up the dollar. You would just allow the dollar to not lose value.
01:17:20.700 - 01:17:58.580, Speaker B: Yeah. You just be okay with some probably serious loss in purchasing power, which would look like high inflation for a while. But at the end of, like, a fair system has America extracting as much value from the global market as it has actually earned with its contribution to the market, not over and above its contribution to the market, because it's extracting a rent for basically the rest of the world using dollars as the currency and the american financial system.
01:18:00.070 - 01:18:16.586, Speaker A: So allowing the dollar to inflate if we hadn't invaded Iraq sounds like, okay, we'll throw up the flag and just, we won't let this Ponzi perpetuate. But instead, we chose the path where we kick the can down the road because we want the ponzi to perpetuate as long as possible.
01:18:16.688 - 01:18:53.730, Speaker B: So this is the thing that's weird, right? It's like, why did we invade? Like, this is what we were saying about voting and coercion and, like, democracy. And it's like, you know, I didn't vote to invade Iraq everybody who was in favor of invading Iraq lied about it. They said there were weapons of mass destruction. They printed it in the New York Times. We believed it. They said, I remember I was ten, I listened to this on the news every day, weapons of mass destruction for years and years, and nothing happened. Right? Maybe the russian people didn't vote to invade Ukraine.
01:18:53.730 - 01:19:43.160, Speaker B: Putin decided to invade Ukraine. Maybe the american people didn't vote to invade Iraq. But the pattern of maintaining the dollar dominance as managed by the Federal Reserve is why we invaded Iraq. How is that different than me as a US citizen being controlled by the Federal Reserve dictatorship? If that is the pattern of war in this country, then it's not like somebody actually threatened America. That was all lies. It was like they threatened the dollar Ponzi, and so we blew them. So, like, that makes me feel like I'm living in a fed dictatorship, right?
01:19:44.090 - 01:20:22.402, Speaker A: This has been the question I've been waiting, kind of like, circling around Jerry Britto, unrelated to all this conversation. Jerry Britto and I talked to him about the tornado cash thing, which was one department out of the global, the larger United States government. One department, the treasury, banned tornado cash. It had nothing to do with the FDA, it had nothing to do with Congress. It was just like one part of this broader machine. And so he said, the United States is not a monolith. It was just this one part of this broader system that did this one thing.
01:20:22.402 - 01:21:08.340, Speaker A: But then if you zoom all the way out and kind of get a little bit more satellite view of the whole entire incentive structure of the broader american system. Yes, the US government is not a monolith. It is a modular set of interwoven agencies and representatives. But at an incentive level, you can talk about the nation state, both the United States nation state, other nation states, as a holistic system. And it works out like, most of the time. As in, if you assume agency by a nation state, you can kind of predict what it's going to do as a whole. And that is weird to me that you can do that, but it works pretty damn well a lot.
01:21:08.870 - 01:21:47.626, Speaker B: One of my favorite models for this is democratic processes. I model by being like, oh, they react too late and then they overreact. So if that's all you knew about the United States, you could model our COVID response pretty well. We're just going to pretend like it's not a problem, and then we're going to shut everything down, right? You can often do that. And that's like, typically our control system as humans. When we think of like, oh, molok. Global warming.
01:21:47.626 - 01:22:19.370, Speaker B: Right. We're going to ignore it, and then we're going to overreact, and then it's going to be like austerity measures for everyone. Right. So it's pretty common. You can model things using. What kind of control system is this? What is the feedback response to things that come up and. Yeah, that helps you predict it holistically.
01:22:20.510 - 01:22:57.078, Speaker A: Tribes, organizations, governments, they're not a monolith, they're independent parts, but they kind of have agency. Right. There's. Who wrote the Leviathan? Thomas Hobbes Leviathan, where all the interdependent parts are part of this larger creature. And it's like the United States has agency because it has its own wants and desires and desire to live. And it's really the dollar that I think is one of the main things that needs to have value, because as soon as the dollar goes to zero, the United States falls apart. And so it's like the dollar that's keeping things together.
01:22:57.078 - 01:23:16.730, Speaker A: So it's like the dollar has its own demand to live, desire to live. And it creates this incentive structure out of that demand. So how does that relate to the. Democracy ignores it and then overreacts. How do those things relate?
01:23:18.590 - 01:24:02.780, Speaker B: Sure. So let me try to apply that theory. Right? It's like, maybe we don't see the egregiousness of the US dollar right now as citizens within the country, so we ignore it. Right? In the same way that it takes a while for us to decide that slavery is worth fighting a war over. It has to grow big enough and oppressive enough. And so maybe one day we realize that the way we're managing the dollar is not great. Also, I just want to pull apart a couple things, right? Not liking the dollar and not liking America are somewhat different.
01:24:02.780 - 01:25:23.060, Speaker B: You could be a dollar ponzi, minimalist, and be like, we should not have this reserve currency that we try to prop up demand for artificially and still like America, and be a US citizen and be a patriot, even. In fact, I think it's patriotic to want a future for the US that is separate from the dollar ponzi that we're fighting wars to maintain. I think a better use of armed force is like, not throwing to help prop up the dollar ponzi. But what do I know, right? But in the future, it could be that we overreact, right? And then we are like, no country can operate the reserve currency. We go all in on neutral reserve currencies or something, and we start propping up bitcoin or Ethereum as collateral, that's like one. Or it's like we ignore BTC and ETH for so long, and then we overreact by banning them completely. Right? They're both outcomes that I think are possible for the government.
01:25:23.060 - 01:26:46.240, Speaker B: The idea is to try and come up with systems that anticipate problems and can work to overcome them. The problem is that it's hard to get people to coordinate around doing that when it's not immediately apparent, then that's a problem, right? So the hope for things like Ethereum is that they can actually solve these global coordination problems. Why are we fighting over? The world is on fire. We have a global climate crisis, right? Things are only going to get more scarce. Supply chains are only going to break down on their own. We could spend our effort to try to solve some of these problems, put our heads together, figure out how to clean water, clean air, restore things. But instead we're fighting over Ukraine, right? Maybe one day there's like a radicalist environmentalist league or something, and they have their own proposals to boycott things or protest things, or there's a bunch of people sitting in the forest in Germany, and they wouldn't get down from the trees, so they couldn't cut them down.
01:26:46.240 - 01:27:10.680, Speaker B: That was pretty cool. Things like that. Or throwing wrenches in the way of people destroying the environment, although that's not great either, because now everybody's dependent on russian gas. And the reality is that's fueling the war in Ukraine. Now, sometimes when you try to get away from these things, they still come back.
01:27:12.570 - 01:27:19.020, Speaker A: And so, to tie a bow on this conversation, how does Ethereum fix all this?
01:27:20.830 - 01:28:12.202, Speaker B: Ethereum fixes all this by inspiring people to try and think about how Ethereum fixes all this. Step one, obviously motivational equilibrium. But I mean that half jokingly, and I actually mean that seriously, too. There is now things like vita Dao that's doing longevity research on the blockchain where they have NFTs as IP, and you can invest in that and help fund longevity things that you want. Okay, this is going to sound weird. So every empire is basically a join or die. Like one of the funny contracts that Athens as part of the Delian League made.
01:28:12.202 - 01:28:40.206, Speaker B: I think it was isle of Lesbos. And this is pretty funny. Maybe it was another one. But the reason Lesbos, like lesbian. It's like they basically showed up to this island and were like, you guys can join the league or we'll kill you all. And they were like, we will not join the league. And they were like, fuck it, we're going to climb the walls, kill all the men, sell everybody to slavery, and sell all the women to slavery.
01:28:40.206 - 01:29:39.290, Speaker B: And Lesbos has no more men. That's why it's Lesbos. But what happens when somebody puts a joiner die Ponzi on chain? What if the joiner die Ponzi on chain is more efficient than the way empires work? The thing that citizenship sells you, in the Maslow's hierarchy of needs of citizenship, the base level is deterrence. Right? Like, I agree to be a citizen of the United States, because if I go somewhere and somebody hurts me, they'll maybe get hurt worse. It means something to me. I feel safe and protected domestically and abroad. Right? And so your main service, your main offer as a nation state is deterrence.
01:29:39.290 - 01:29:59.770, Speaker B: So when I think of Coca Cola, I see, like, sugar water. When I think of a nation state, I think of an assassination guild with a public goods department. Right? Imagine trying to operate a nation state without an assassination guild. You're going to have a really hard time doing any deterrence.
01:30:00.450 - 01:30:02.350, Speaker A: You mean a monopoly on violence?
01:30:03.810 - 01:30:06.446, Speaker B: That's another way of describing it.
01:30:06.628 - 01:30:09.866, Speaker A: That's how we described it on bank list before. Yeah, monopoly on violence.
01:30:09.898 - 01:30:48.570, Speaker B: Yeah. It's just, like, one of those things. I could see citizenship being disrupted, for example, if somebody can offer deterrence as a service more cheaply. Right? If I join some thing, and now I know that I'm protected in this way. Yeah, I'll maybe pay for it a little extra or something, but that's the number one reason. And it's like, maybe you don't need to operate this massive, expensive infrastructure in order to operate it. Deterrent in 2022.
01:30:48.570 - 01:31:38.700, Speaker B: Maybe it's a lot cheaper now. I don't think we're going to see any of that anytime soon. I don't think we're going to see Joiner die Ponzi's where people are like, you have this option, but I'm kind of afraid of it, because when we talk about beating Molec, we talk about these coordination systems. Like, what if we unleash an even better coordination system, right? Something like religion, which I'm sort of diametrically opposed to, given my upbringing. Sort of had islamic fundamentalist father, fought a lot. But it's like, religion is, like, what you get when you solve Moloch for your system. I want the males to not infight over the women.
01:31:38.700 - 01:32:25.180, Speaker B: And so we're going to make a bunch of rules to manage our conflict internally. And now we're a really highly coordinated and more trusting society, and that gives us the opportunity to go take everyone else over and impose our God Ponzi on them and the way we do things on them. And so it's like, from the inside looking in, you're like, oh, man, how do I solve this problem of these monkeys? Just like, fighting over breeding rights and resources and shit. Yeah, and fucking killing each other over this shit. Like, the fucking animals. And then you make some crazy rulebook and you kill everybody who doesn't enforce it. And then you end up with this, like, God Ponzi that lasts 2000 years.
01:32:25.180 - 01:33:05.174, Speaker B: Ah. I think maybe there's, like, positive ponzies that we should be optimistic for, that it's like, join and thrive or something. Like live and let live Ponzi. And that's what we should be trying to help promote. I don't know. I agree to not pay taxes would be funny as a commitment device. I'm not advocating for that.
01:33:05.174 - 01:33:54.566, Speaker B: I think paying taxes is important. I just think if you end up at the point that you're like, okay, the government's just blowing shit up and not saving the world. We need to be saving the world government. I'm now boycott being able to coordinate activism, boycotts movements to try and make our systems more accurately reflect our values, instead of our systems just being ponzies that sustain themselves indefinitely, even when they are opposed to our values, is like the idea, maybe more things need a rage. Quit. It's like every system, it starts out useful and it ends up scam. It exists on a spectrum of useful and scam, right? Like the beginning of its life.
01:33:54.566 - 01:34:09.020, Speaker B: It's like, useful, the end of its life scam. That's why we need that destructive creativity to burn down some of these scams that have outlived their usefulness in 2022.
01:34:12.030 - 01:34:28.420, Speaker A: Well, I hope people's imaginations have been expanded to what it is we're actually doing here, why things are Ponzi's all the way down, and how it's also just coordination. So thank you for telling me, helping me tell this very creative story.
