00:00:12.730 - 00:00:47.450, Speaker A: We are at the Axelar Interoperability series. Next up in this conversation, we're talking to Sriram from eigenlayer. I think you probably might not need to know what eigen Layer is because it has absolutely swept the Web Three world by swarm, at least the Ethereum world, because it's created this thing called restaking, where you can apply your e stake to more things than just Ethereum. Staking getting a lot of the Ethereum community very, very excited, and it's also allowed for new kinds of chains to be interoperable inside of the Ethereum ecosystem. So we're going to go talk to Sriram right now, all about eigen Layer and where eigen Layer is in its development. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.
00:00:47.520 - 00:01:27.734, Speaker B: Kraken is our strategic sponsor for 2023. Why? Because Kraken has been around for over twelve years and has proven itself to be deeply aligned with the crypto industry. Trusted, centralized crypto platforms are hard to come by these days, which makes the few remaining ones even more valuable. With over 9 million users and not a cent lost, choosing Kraken as our strategic sponsor for 2023 was a no brainer. We need exchanges like Kraken to provide the onramps to get people to go bankless, and Kraken's emphasis on security and transparency makes us feel good about having them as a sponsor. If you're unsure about your centralized exchange or onramp, perhaps open an account with Kraken today. And if you're unsure about the rest of Web Three, well then maybe you should get your learn on with MetaMask Learn.
00:01:27.734 - 00:02:13.334, Speaker B: Learning about crypto is hard. There's no one out there to hold your hand to get into this industry. Until now. MetaMask Learn is the best place I've ever seen to send someone to learn everything there is to know about Web Three. If you're a company trying to onboard employees, or you're a son or daughter trying to onboard your boomer parents, MetaMask Learn is the place to send them interactive and engaging lessons, making learning about Web Three fun and easy. Now, once you're through the Kraken's gates and you've taken the MetaMask course on what's a Dex, you're safe to make your first stop into the world of DeFi. Where better to start other than Uniswap? Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange for crypto asset trades and swaps, but it's now also an NFT aggregator as well, making Uniswap some of the best decentralizing trading tech that's out there.
00:02:13.334 - 00:02:31.286, Speaker B: Uniswap's big announcement at East Denver is their Uniswap wallet, which is waiting to get released to the public as soon as Apple stops being a big ol bully about crypto apps in the App Store. Uniswap is basically on every chain that's relevant in the crypto ecosystem. So if you want to use Uniswap, but with the cheapest possible fees, then use Uniswap on Arbitrum.
00:02:31.318 - 00:02:31.846, Speaker A: The Arbitrum.
00:02:31.878 - 00:02:51.358, Speaker B: Layer two is the host of Ethereum's most vibrant DFI and NFT communities. Arbitrum is already surpassing the ETH layer One in transaction volume, and it's not even close to full capacity. With so many vibrant communities on Arbitrum, Arbitrum is a good place to call home for the era of Layer Two. S speaking of settling into new homes, the Phantom Wallet is now available on both Ethereum and Polygon.
00:02:51.454 - 00:02:52.946, Speaker A: That's right, the number one wallet on.
00:02:52.968 - 00:03:07.682, Speaker B: Salana is expanding into the Ethereum ecosystem. Phantom is the one wallet for everything. Displaying NFTs, making NFT, trades, swapping tokens, staking tokens. So if you're a multi chain surfer or an NFT power user, then the Phantom Wallet is for you. It also comes in mobile.
00:03:07.746 - 00:03:09.782, Speaker A: Check it out at Phantom app.
00:03:09.916 - 00:03:11.282, Speaker B: Now let's get into the interview.
00:03:11.346 - 00:03:24.974, Speaker A: Alright, bankrupt nation. We are back at the Axelar Interop summit, and I'm here with Sriram from Eigen Layer. Sriram, last time we talked at DevCon, not many people knew about Eigen Layer. Now it seems everyone knows about Eigen Layer. How does that feel?
00:03:25.172 - 00:03:50.022, Speaker C: It's a little bizarre. It's definitely a more positive outcome than we anticipated. We did expect that over time people will warm up to the idea that actually Ethereum can serve as the security layer for pretty much anything but the speed at which the community has gotten there. Maybe partly thanks to you and the episode we did earlier, but really happy to be here in this position.
00:03:50.156 - 00:04:04.490, Speaker A: Okay, so give us the lay of the land for where we are in the progress of Eigen Layer, because everyone starts being able to wrap over their heads around it. People are starting to see the use cases, but like when main net? Is that the right question? Main net?
00:04:04.560 - 00:04:36.018, Speaker C: Yes. We definitely want to be on main net by Q three this year. There'll be a testnet by Q two this year, so public testnet. We already are on private testnet, as I told you before. And on the team side, we've been growing our team quite a bit. So if any of you out there are builders or want to grow the ecosystem, any of these things, do ping me at the Eigen Layer handle. On the product side, we've been continuing to build the core platform.
00:04:36.018 - 00:04:56.026, Speaker C: And the way we are thinking of doing the launch is because it's such a complicated platform with many sides, like stakers node operators, new services, roll ups, all these different sites. So we want to onboard one side at a time. So we may start with stakers operators services, do a phased launch. So that's what we are hoping for.
00:04:56.128 - 00:05:12.426, Speaker A: And so Eigen Layer has just generated a ton of excitement. The concept of restaking has really opened people's brains to new use cases and new ideas. Have people already approached you guys saying, hey, I want to build on Eigen Layer? What's that been like and what are people trying to build?
00:05:12.548 - 00:05:55.322, Speaker C: Yeah, that has been really again, very enthusiastic response. We have people interested in building decentralized sequences, people interested in building Oracles bridges because you can move data in and out of Ethereum using the restaking layer. You can have IBC bridges or other kind of light client bridges. You can have fast ZK proof verification. So some of the major ZK teams are interested in can you have thousands of DAP rollups, all right, to a kind of intermediate restaked layer where the restake layer just checks the ZK proofs very fast and reports that back to Ethereum. So those are some examples. We're also seeing interest from RPC providers, some of the bigger ones, as well as new players.
00:05:55.322 - 00:06:27.414, Speaker C: We're seeing interest on AI? On ethereum. Can we get a chat GPT type thing to be built? Instead of having a single central party like the OpenAI servers serving it, can we have the Ethereum decentralized node serving open source versions of AI on Eigen layer? So that's the range of interest we are seeing. It remains to see how much we can support. Right now we are constrained by engineering bandwidth and the ability to support these. We want to support all of them, but whether we can support them on day one is thing that we're trying to figure out.
00:06:27.452 - 00:06:45.594, Speaker A: Yeah, and what's the strategy there? Because if you want to support them, that requires resources. There's only so many people at the eigen layer team. Is the strategy to I'm assuming the strategy is to be able to allow anyone to permissionlessly build on Eigen layer. Maybe that's what mainnet is. What's the strategy to enable anyone who wants to build on liganlayer to build on Eigen layer.
00:06:45.642 - 00:07:11.158, Speaker C: So we are building a set of developer tools so that when you're developing a middleware, what is the specification to which that should comply, and trying to build a series of libraries. I don't expect the day one when we launch on Mainnet, it is going to be easy for anybody to build on eigen layer. Maybe the initial launch will be very restricted. But over time, in a year or so, we want to be in a position where many, many other teams have built something, at least on testnet, on.
00:07:11.164 - 00:07:30.090, Speaker A: Eigen layers, when something like this so eigen layer is raising around at a 500 million dollar valuation, which when something like that happens, a lot of people focus on that. It's like, wow, that's clearly a very big deal. All of a sudden you really change the game. Have you seen Eigen layer competitors start to crop up just to follow in the footsteps?
00:07:30.690 - 00:08:07.682, Speaker C: I don't know of any. I'm sure there are some which we don't know about, but the competition is healthy. So if other people want to build, that's always a possibility. And the way we think about a marketplace for decentralized trust from Ethereum is the more the amount of stake and the more the validators that opt in, that increases the power of the marketplace. And having a common marketplace is, I think in general more beneficial to the ecosystem. That's our view. But of course it's a permissionless innovation.
00:08:07.682 - 00:08:09.122, Speaker C: We stand by our values.
00:08:09.186 - 00:08:52.978, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. And Bankless listeners who are listening to Sriram for the first time might be confused as to what we're talking about. We did kind of skip forward ahead of what Eigen layer actually is. But I definitely would encourage you to listen to our talk at Defcon, where we really went through this quite a been. The metaphor I've been using to explain eigen layer is like skyrim mods. And so you have the base game, the base Skyrim game, the vanilla game, which is like base vanilla Ethereum staking, but then you add in another mod to add on to that base game, to do something else, to do something extra that is beyond staking, that's using the base game as a platform. The cool thing about Skyrim mods, or maybe the bad thing about Skyrim mods is that you can only add so many before things get really weird.
00:08:52.978 - 00:09:01.738, Speaker A: I'm assuming that is probably the right mental model to have. Don't add too many mods because things will start to conflict. Is that the right intuition I've got?
00:09:01.824 - 00:10:28.102, Speaker C: Yes. I think if you look at the range of services, several services will be supported by small groups and you will have a long tail of services supported by, oh, I got these validators to run this for me, or this group of stakers. But there'll be some services which are core to the Ethereum ecosystem, like a hyperscale data availability, like a most performant ZK bridge, like a performant light client bridge to the Cosmos ecosystem, like a super performant decentralized sequencer and a super fast settlement layer. There are some services which will be core ecosystem services which we expect everybody should run. So I will agree to the extent that we are talking about services that are run by everybody, there'll be a few, sure, but there'll be many, many services run by a few people so that there is a possibility for a service to be bootstrapped and emerge up to the system level rather than the system level being guarded closely. And I would agree also with this is going to have unpredictable second order effects, right? It very much is reminiscent of the mev discovery by the Flashbots team early on in 2016, 2017, that this is going to be a force and it is going to happen. And the only question that we can think of as a community or the Ethereum community is how do we channel this energy in the most useful way possible so that it's a positive sum game for all of us.
00:10:28.102 - 00:10:33.558, Speaker C: So that's something we're very much aligned to and always solicit the Ethereum community's inputs on.
00:10:33.644 - 00:11:40.620, Speaker A: So one question I have, and we're at this Interoperability summit and it's hosted by Axelar, which is this brand new blockchain that I've been learning about today, which is an IBC chain that connects Cosmos to Ethereum but also all the other blockchains. And that's a lot of the main thread of this whole entire event is interoperability between many, many desperate chains away from Ethereum layer twos, away from the EVM standard but still put interoperability between all these chains. Now, this is a conversation the question I'm about to ask you is a conversation about the push and pull between a horizontal mesh landscape of chains, which is kind of the Cosmos polychain multi chain vision versus concentration down onto one single chain, which is perhaps the ETH maxi or network effects vision that Ryan and I tend toward to lean into. Now, I don't think it's so binary. I think the answer is somewhere in the middle. But I think that Eigen layer pulls towards the Ethereum central one chain, one dominant chain because of what Eigen layer can do for E staking and providing security. And I'm wondering how does that check with you? Do you think that that pulls the pendulum in the Ethereum favor?
00:11:41.230 - 00:12:30.822, Speaker C: Definitely to the extent that there were some features that some layer ones. The main thing that a general purpose layer one was trying to do was to say that there are some technical features not available in Ethereum that we are providing be it consensus, be it like scalability, be it the virtual machine. And what we see with both the layer two vision and a deepening of the layer two vision with the Eigen layer vision is that pretty much all of those things can be internalized back into the Ethereum ecosystem. So then why would one want a separate chain? There may be other reasons other than technical arbitrage. That's how I view it is. Basically any technical innovations can be internalized back into the Ethereum ecosystem. This is analogous to think about companies, right? Like when there is one search company and there's another search company, good ideas.
00:12:30.822 - 00:12:53.458, Speaker C: Google will internalize and run it and the agile mechanism to do this is what Eigen layer provides. And so competing purely on technical arbitrage is not going to be feasible. You need other things. You need a, you know, I'm a DAP and I want my sovereignty. You need some other know. This is a different kind of community. Cosmos has this vision of a community computer.
00:12:53.458 - 00:13:21.542, Speaker C: It's like my village, my know, this is a group of artists and we are running this chain. It's not up to economic security. It's our own reputation and stuff we are putting on the line. So these are all visions. There is a vision of a chain which could be like a proof of personhood chain, right? There's a vision of like it's a proof of space chain which can be more decent. There are all these visions of possible other l ones. But technical arbitrage as like hey, I'm running this proof of stake chain for these features.
00:13:21.542 - 00:14:14.378, Speaker C: This is better. And that's why I'm a new l one. I think that is going to become less and less plausible with the Eigen layer view. I also want to add that since we are in the interop summit, one important thing we have to think about as the Ethereum community is how does Ethereum position itself to be at the absolute center of the interop ecosystem? Whether it is just layer twos or totally sovereign chains, ethereum is the most secure chain, it is the most liquid chain, it is also the most connected chain. How do we make sure we go from this to provide some of the strongest Bridging to all of the other chains so we retain this position? And that's something that I'm excited about Eigen layer can do. There is to provide high quality Bridging in and out of Ethereum. By running light clients off chain and having a lot of re stakers certified, you can actually get a lot of very high quality Bridging in and out of Ethereum.
00:14:14.378 - 00:14:20.730, Speaker C: So Ethereum can maintain the position as the premium center hub of this multi chain ecosystem.
00:14:20.810 - 00:14:58.860, Speaker A: Right? And I think that's articulated very well where, like I said, whether it's a mesh network of many, many chains with no dominant center or a single one center focal point of one chain and no other chains after that, it's not going to be to the extreme, it's going to be somewhere in between those two binaries. But I do think that this technology about Eigen Layer really does have that sun of the solar ecosystem where all the other chains kind of gravitate around Ethereum. And Eigen layer allows that ethereum expression to expand outwards. When people come up to you and ask you questions about the technical questions, the really good questions about Eigen layer, what are those questions?
00:14:59.470 - 00:15:47.306, Speaker C: The questions are one of the most interesting questions on Eigen Layer is everything the crypto economics that you can import due to Eigen Layer has to be on chain and slashable. There are certain things that are on chain and slashable and certain things that are not. Like, for example, if I want to build an Oracle, this is a simple example I give. But if you dig in deeper, the Oracle is one of the harder things to build on Eigen layer. The reason being, when you try to build an Oracle, how do you create a slashing condition? How do you know Bitcoin to ETH is not $1 today? How do you know that in an on chain verifiable manner? Are you going to trust a committee for it that feels like low grade? Sure. But Eigen Layer trust model is actually very dynamic. For example, there are multiple dimensions of trust that exist and slashing or economic trust is only one dimension of trust.
00:15:47.306 - 00:16:19.442, Speaker C: There are other dimensions of trust. And in the Ethereum community we are very passionate about decentralization as a dimension of trust. It doesn't matter how much money you have. Like if there are thousands or tens of thousands of nodes validating and providing independent inputs, it's very hard for them to collude and attack the system. And that itself is a source of trust independent of how much money they have actually put in. And this is the homestaker. Each staker vision, the rocket pool vision of everybody should be able to run a node and eigen layer can supply the trust to things like Oracles.
00:16:19.442 - 00:17:04.034, Speaker C: Imagine an Oracle price feed where every home staker just provides a feed even if they're not slashable. Just the fact that 10,000 independent nodes actually betted something is a source of trust. So when we think about a marketplace for decentralized trust, the most important question is like what are the ways in which we commoditize decentralized trust? Sure, each stake is one dimension of it. Another dimension is how do we vet and validate? Who are the home stakers, how are we going to identify that? This is another important question that we get. How are we going to identify that? I think it's very hard to identify homestakers. It's very easy to identify the exchanges and the major liquid staking protocols and the staking service providers. So the complement of it is already like a pretty decentralized set.
00:17:04.034 - 00:17:54.382, Speaker C: But we imagine the emergence of decentralization Oracles. Oracles which just specialize like a chain analysis, but an analysis of where validators are, how decentralized they are geographically and agency wise. Are they really independent agents, people coming and vetting this? And we don't want to be the source of subjectivity. One of the major platform goals of eigen layer is to push all agency to the edges. If you're a middleware, you should dictate what kind of nodes want to opt in because some would want economic trust, some would want decentralization trust and we want the spectrum of decentralized trust to be expressed on eigen layer. So we imagine that different middlewares will have different subjective decentralization oracles. And once you have that, there may be additional yield accruing to these decentralized nodes.
00:17:54.382 - 00:18:02.854, Speaker C: So these are the two, I would say, major questions. What slashing do we do? How do we get incentivized decentralization on eigen layers? So those are some of the questions.
00:18:02.972 - 00:18:13.898, Speaker A: It's not always when the hey, what question should I ask? Question actually works all that well, but that one works pretty well. Sriram if people have been piqued or they just want to learn about the frontier of eigen layer, where should they go?
00:18:14.064 - 00:18:47.906, Speaker C: Right now the best place is the Eigen layer Twitter handle E-I-G-N-L-A-Y-E-R. But also the Twitter handle points to our forums discourse forums, where we are inviting all the Ethereum community members to participate and engage with us on any aspects of Eigen layer, how that would enhance or deteriorate any aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem. We want to be cognizant of all of it. So please, we want to invite the Ethereum community to come and participate there and slowly we'll be rolling out more and more ways to open up the Eigen layer development to the broader community.
00:18:48.008 - 00:18:53.270, Speaker A: And I'm assuming you're hiring or just looking for partnerships. What are you looking for on the B, D and hiring front?
00:18:53.340 - 00:19:53.958, Speaker C: On the hiring front, like distributed systems, smart contract engineers always we want on a team like this, especially now that there are a lot of teams who want to build stuff up on Eigen layer. We want people internally who can support all of these really interesting creative things. So we're looking for that on the BDN ecosystem growth side, anybody who's creative in growing ecosystems like this, definitely we want to talk to on the broader ecosystem. We are looking for the various sides of our market stakers who have ETH for staking ETH and want to enhance yield. We want to look at node know the major node operators. We are talking to them service builders like whether it is big existing services like Chainlink who want to add on an know the broader decentralization from the ethereum community. Or it could be services that are new and upcoming who want to use this as a way for bootstrapping and differentiating themselves from existing services.
00:19:53.958 - 00:19:56.262, Speaker C: We are very interested in talking to all of them.
00:19:56.316 - 00:19:57.542, Speaker A: Sri on thank you so much.
00:19:57.596 - 00:19:59.640, Speaker C: Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
00:20:00.370 - 00:20:00.860, Speaker A: Thank you.
