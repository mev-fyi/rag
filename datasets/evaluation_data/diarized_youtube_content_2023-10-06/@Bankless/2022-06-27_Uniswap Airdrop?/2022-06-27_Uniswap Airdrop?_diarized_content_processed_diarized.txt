00:00:00.000 - 00:00:03.946, Speaker B: Hayden, there's an airdrop coming. Can you talk about the details of the airdrop associated.
00:00:03.978 - 00:00:23.562, Speaker A: With Genie in acquiring the Genie team? We didn't want to leave the genie community and users behind, and so we allocated a bunch of money to basically airdrop to historical genie users. Airdrop is going to be in USDC. I think it's going to be everyone who's used Genie more than once. You can't farm this airdrop. We checkpointed it before we made the decision to do it. But all the early users of Genie will be rewarded.
00:00:23.626 - 00:00:36.034, Speaker B: This is the first airdrop that I've heard that is of a stable coin rather than like a brand new native token. So there's literally just not a valueless governance token being airdropped straight up like cash. Can you talk about a little bit about that choice?
00:00:36.082 - 00:00:48.820, Speaker A: Historical genie users can choose what they want to do, right? If they want to cash it out to their bank account, whatever they want to do, they can do it. I think it's just about giving the recipients choice and, yeah, we really just wanted to reward the early Genie users and then they can choose.
