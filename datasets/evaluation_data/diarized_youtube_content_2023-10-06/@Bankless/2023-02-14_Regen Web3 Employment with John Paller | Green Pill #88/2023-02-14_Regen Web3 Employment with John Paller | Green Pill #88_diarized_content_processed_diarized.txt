00:00:05.290 - 00:00:46.486, Speaker A: What up? Coordination on the Pod today. We got John Powell. We are talking about regen web three employment. So basically, how is employment going to involve with decentralized blockchain based finance? I know that a lot of people think that Blockchains and Web Three are about the future of finance, and so that lends a lot to talking about decentralized finance. And also art investing and NFTs were a big thing this past cycle. But I think that we got to not sleep on this idea that jobs and employment are going to be an important use case in the future. 95% of humanity, mostly their financial lives is their communities, people that they work with and their employment, how they earn an income.
00:00:46.486 - 00:02:06.170, Speaker A: And so how do we build a bridge from the old world to the new world on employment? How do we get more talent working for Tokens and working for DAOs? And how do we do that in a regenerative way such that they're able to not only support themselves, but support their communities and the causes that they care about? So John's one of those people who's kind of building a bridge. The real practical questions that come along when you start earning tokens from DAOs, like how do I get insurance? I want to buy a house, how do I prove to the bank that I have a certain amount of income are kind of the kinds of things that John Powell's company, Opelis can provide for people. So we talk a lot about the decentralization of the future of work, regen Web Three employment, how the future of work can't be built on the history of work and what younger generations want with employment and how blockchain based employment can provide that for them. So I think this is an interesting episode because John's been thinking about these things for decades now and it's finally coming to fruition with Opolis for him. But also, John is the executive steward behind ETH Denver. So we nerd out a little bit about ETH Denver. We're recording this on Tuesday, February 7, which is about two or three weeks before East Denver biggest biddle a thon in North America for the Ethereum community annually.
00:02:06.170 - 00:02:30.150, Speaker A: So John's the executive steward of that, but also the CEO of Opolis, so pulling double duty for the Web Three ecosystem over there. Also, John is a Colorado native, so him and I have known each other through the Boulder blockchain and the Ethereum Denver ecosystems for a couple of years, so it's been great to follow his progression over the years. Without further ado, I'll give you John Powell on Regen Web Three employment. Enjoy coordination.
00:02:30.230 - 00:03:08.802, Speaker B: Working in Web Three is awesome, but working outside of the typical W Two employee structure is a deal breaker for so many. Opolis is helping the self sovereign worker focus on what they do best. Their work. Tax time is coming up. Opolis helps professionalize your business by helping you form an entity, generate proof of employment through Pay subs and receive a W two at the end of the tax year. Are you self employed and forced to spend money on expensive healthcare insurance with limited coverage? Opelis leverages group buying power through a community employment coop, helping you save 20% to 50% on high quality, affordable healthcare options through Cigna. And finally, Opelis's member owners share in Opelis's success and profits based on their work token holdings.
00:03:08.802 - 00:03:45.342, Speaker B: You must be authorized to work inside the United States in select Canadian provinces to receive Opelis's benefits. Book a 30 minutes free consultation with Opelis's experts and join Opolis by March 31, 2023, to get a thousand work and a thousand bank tokens. Go to Connect Opelis Co Bankless to get started. And if you're going to East Denver, make sure to stop by the Opolis booth or attend their Future of Work Summit hosted by Opolis. The Glow Dollar is a new coin with a very special property. As the market cap of Glow goes up, extreme poverty goes down. Glow is a dollar backed nonprofit stablecoin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty.
00:03:45.342 - 00:04:21.482, Speaker B: Glow is basically the same business model as USDC, with yield generating Treasuries on one side and a stablecoin on Ethereum on the other. But instead of being a for profit company, glow is a nonprofit that donates 100% of all yields from the Glow Reserve to Give Directly's basic Income Program. Give Directly is a charity that gives people money, no strings attached, to people living in poverty, and is a charity that Vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past. With Glow, you can reduce poverty just by holding a stablecoin. Glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist@glowdollar.org. Greenpill. That's Glodollar.org.
00:04:21.482 - 00:04:22.590, Speaker B: Greenpill.
00:04:24.610 - 00:04:26.260, Speaker A: What's up, John? How are you doing?
00:04:26.630 - 00:04:29.314, Speaker C: What's up, Kevin? Good to see you, man.
00:04:29.432 - 00:04:43.030, Speaker A: So we're recording this on February 7, and East Denver is two or three weeks away. You're the executive steward of East Denver. On a scale of one to eleven, what's what's the stress level, like preparing for the biggest ethereum conference in North America?
00:04:43.450 - 00:04:45.686, Speaker C: Well, in the world. How about that?
00:04:45.868 - 00:04:49.814, Speaker A: Excuse me? It's not a conference. I know that. It's a build a thon, right? It's a hackathon.
00:04:49.862 - 00:05:44.982, Speaker C: Well, it's a community innovation Festival is the official taxonomy label that we prefer, because, as you know, we don't really like the conference moniker because it has some pretty lame implications. It depends on who you ask. It's not my first rodeo, so as much as I get a little wound up about particular details, I'm pretty good about not letting it turn me into a basket of nerves or anything. But this is a big year for us in terms of growth. So the big challenge is new venue, lots of people. We had an advantage last year, for example. We were in the same space for four years, so we knew exactly what we were doing and how to lay things out and the problems with the building, any of the kind of nuances.
00:05:44.982 - 00:06:02.560, Speaker C: We'd figure that out now. It's like we're almost starting over. Not entirely. We have a much bigger team and it's going to be fine, but there's just so many details to plan that even with a team that's probably five or six times the size, it's just a lot.
00:06:03.350 - 00:06:04.100, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:06.790 - 00:06:25.346, Speaker C: The team's doing a great job, though. I mean, we have something like 50 core stewards now and meta stewards another 50 or 75 at least, and then volunteers somewhere pushing 400. So I mean, it's quite a community lift nowadays.
00:06:25.538 - 00:07:02.180, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I'm sure I speak for the Ethereum community when I say really happy that East Denver continues to grow year over year and bring so much of the movement to Colorado. So I think on this episode we wanted to veer away from East Denver and talk about your day job, which is Opelis and decentralization of employment. So I think a lot of listeners might be familiar with your work through East Denver, but if they're a member of a Dao, then they might use Opolis to manage their benefits and compliance and stuff. So I'm wondering if we could shift the conversation over to Opolis for a bit and you could tell us what you've been up to there.
00:07:03.110 - 00:08:07.910, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So for those that are listening that don't know much about Opolis or maybe heard about it or not really sure how to use it or why it exists, my background is just a little high level sort of precursor to this is I come from HR Tech and Employment Systems. So in a previous life I built like a big staffing company. I did a few startups in the Uber of Economy back ten years ago and the sort of thesis was trying to figure out how to democratize the activity of employment when I first uttered the words in 2005. Now I'm going to date myself, I didn't really know what it meant, but I understood that there was some pretty market paradigm imbalances when it comes to the relationship between employers and employees and who controls what. Maybe call it permissioned. Employment as the traditional corporate structure, where in the US.
00:08:07.910 - 00:09:24.580, Speaker C: For example, I've got to have this. I got to subjugate myself to a corporation in order to get basic stuff like health care, access to retirement plans, simplify my tax payments. Like, oh, if you get a w two, we'll just do it for you. But if you go on your own, then good luck with all that. Quarterly calculations in the sort of progression of the different experiments and hacks and learnings basically kind of settled on the idea that fundamentally none of this is going to change in terms of how we relate to our commercial experience until self sovereignty comes to employment. And what we mean by that is really who controls the decisions around a person's legal employment. And the minute it's in a dynamic where somebody else is choosing that for you, whether it's an HR department or some team of executives or whoever, you don't really have any sustainable, durable say in anything, really.
00:09:24.580 - 00:10:45.302, Speaker C: So we said, okay, well, the question that then got postulated out of that was, is there a way to redesign an employment structure so that individuals could use it? Call it like a public utility, like how do we create a platform where people could just plug in, use it, but it's kind of set it and forget it? They don't really have to worry about it too much. No one's going to rug them because they plug in and it's their choice. Right. And then that led to a whole bunch of research and legal work and two and a half years of designing an actual legal compliance and technological system that actually could service this. And so the net result is we've built a cooperative platform, or if you want to call it an employment Dao with a legal wrapper of a Colorado cooperative. We can talk about that more later. Colorado co op is actually one of the big advancements that we pioneered with this, but it acts like a public utility.
00:10:45.302 - 00:11:39.846, Speaker C: I mean, if you're in a state that the community can service, which is 49 out of 50, and if you're in Canada, we can help as well, but you can essentially opt in to take control of your own employment. So the notion of self sovereign employment is not really that different conceptually from like self sovereign data or a self sovereign identity. I'm taking control of my stuff. But in the context of your commercial life now, like your actual legal employment is being handled by you through a design that we created that's fully compliant, completely legal, and essentially replicates all of the positive features and hallmarks of traditional employment without actually having to subjugate yourself or give up your independence.
00:11:40.038 - 00:11:58.498, Speaker A: Right. So it seems like if I'm a listener who's working for a Dow out there, I can use Opelis to manage my compliance with my local, city, state, federal government, but also in the United States with benefits and all that kind of stuff. It kind of builds a bridge from the old world to the new.
00:11:58.664 - 00:12:54.786, Speaker C: Yeah, we actually frequently refer to Opelis as the bridge to the future, right, or just the great legitimizer, depending on which side of the bridge you're on. So if you're already working in a Dow and you're sort of YOLOing maybe for multiple Dows making, you're getting paid out of treasury via Stream on Superfluid and USDC or something, how does that turn into, like, hey, I can go rent an apartment and prove I have income. How does that turn into actually getting money so you can pay for your health care? How does that turn into reporting any of that and paying taxes? There's a lot of fun and cute stuff about Web Three in the future, but there's all this necessary evil crap that we have to do as well. So what Opelis essentially does is enable you to do both. You get the best of both worlds. You don't have to give up your independence. You don't have to give up your sort of crypto sovereignty or the fact that you're getting paid in stablecoins or whatever.
00:12:54.786 - 00:13:39.250, Speaker C: But you can plug it into our system and be legitimized. And then on the other end of it, if you're exploring Web Three or if you're hesitant to take the leap into the future of work, I often say that I see Web Three as being synonymous with the future of work. But if you got a young kid or a baby at home and a wife who's like, how are you going to get health care? How are you going to pay rent? What are you going to do with all that crypto that you get? What are you going to say? I don't know, we're just going to yolo it. You're not going to do that. There's no way you're going to do that. So you're going to hesitate and you're not going to jump into the pool. Now forget crypto for a minute.
00:13:39.250 - 00:14:16.170, Speaker C: Let's say you're a twitch streamer and you're getting all sorts of views and you're making money and royalties off your streams and all of this. That person has the same issues as the other two that I mentioned, can't get health care, don't know how to report any of this stuff. They can't rent an apartment because they don't have two years of documented income history. All this stuff is a problem. So whether it's a bridge to the future or it's a great legitimizer of Web Three natives, it works both ways. So it is a bridge. It's a bridge between both worlds.
00:14:16.170 - 00:14:17.360, Speaker C: 100%.
00:14:18.530 - 00:14:51.306, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, I just think it's so neat that if I'm a contributor who makes money off of Bitcoin grants or coordinate or any number of crypto platforms, it feels like in the future there's going to be people earning from a plurality of places and earning might not even be work. I was just showing off before we started recording my validator back here, where I earn a pittance of ETH every month. Right. Plurality of token streams and having a bridge where those can all be compliant, I think is an interesting world.
00:14:51.488 - 00:15:17.506, Speaker C: Well, I think it's not just an interesting thing. I think it's going to become standard. I mean, if you look at the behavior of the youngest generation, I mean, they're working for multiple companies, having different income streams. They're doing side hustles. They don't really want the traditional W Two corporate cube farm job. They don't want it. They're actively opting out of it.
00:15:17.506 - 00:16:19.554, Speaker C: And then you see play to earn, contribute to earn, refer to earn, validate to earn models that create these secondary, tertiary revenue streams like, well, what are you going to do? How do you deal with all this stuff? And most people, I mean, it's kind of like see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. I don't know what to do with any of that. But that's not going to be a good excuse for the taxmen when they start coming around asking questions. So we've got to figure out how to legitimize this new world of work. And unfortunately, the corporate mechanism has been used as essentially a tax payment vehicle. Now what they've done is if you look at the regulatory compliance standards, pretty much all of the responsibility for tax payments lands on the corporation. They're going to do your federal tax withholdings.
00:16:19.554 - 00:17:02.146, Speaker C: They're going to do your 941. They're going to do all the different things. And if you don't pay if you do tax withholdings, say, on a bi weekly basis for payroll, if you don't pay it by the following Tuesday, they can literally issue a bench warrant for you. You can go to jail as an executive of a company, if you don't pay your payroll taxes, you could go to jail. You're like personally liable criminally. So they've put so much responsibility on corporations, which translates to risk, and risk equals cost. And then there's social behaviors that come out of that.
00:17:02.146 - 00:17:54.530, Speaker C: It's become an incredibly unfun sport to play. So how does the average person know how to deal with any of that stuff? They don't. So you've got to be able to replicate know, in the corporate world, they call it shared services, right? So shared services is know, you got a big company like IBM or something, and they've got a huge payroll department, a huge HR department, a huge legal department. Well, these departments service the different business units from those particular core disciplines. Well, Opolis is doing the same thing, but just providing these services to solopreneurs, right? So you get access to your accounting support and the HR stuff and the benefits management and the tax payments and all the different things that need to get done. So you don't have to be the expert. That's the point.
00:17:54.530 - 00:18:19.114, Speaker C: It's not about, well, if you want to be a solopreneur, you should take your life seriously and educate yourself about all these different things that you need to do. It's like that's like a second and third education, man. You go work in a corporate cube farm. You don't need to know any of that stuff. Why should you need to know it as a solopreneur? Seems like an unfair bar. Like, oh, in order to own my life, I've got to know all this other stuff. I'm not saying that you shouldn't know it.
00:18:19.114 - 00:18:25.774, Speaker C: I'm just saying it's an unrealistic expectation for mass adoption. Most people aren't going to do that.
00:18:25.892 - 00:18:49.800, Speaker A: One of the things that I think is really interesting is like this idea of modularity. The Unix philosophy of each component does one thing and does it well. And as an entrepreneur, I kind of like the idea that I can just trust that Opelis is managing my compliance and I can focus on providing value in the marketplace as opposed to jumping through all these hoops with the legal form. So I think that you're kind of taking one for the team by managing the compliance, like the thing that no one else wants to do here.
00:18:50.410 - 00:19:51.498, Speaker C: And then from my view, when you say, I'm taking one for the team, my goal is to build it into an automated platform, cooperative, dow like structure, like a public utility that just sort of is and does it's just like, oh, I'm going to go out and start my own thing. Oh, we'll just plug in Opolis. You kind of don't associate it with any one person or thing. It's just a tool set that aggregates all the things that I need, and I can just plug in. And you're right. I can focus on the thing that my core competency is, which is for most people, not this stuff. No average person has the ability to understand the nuances of the things that I've learned in 20 years of doing this crap, and you don't want to know it, okay? The worthless information that's in my brain that we've transposed into the product, nobody wants to know any of this stuff, okay? You shouldn't have to.
00:19:51.498 - 00:20:22.340, Speaker C: And we're just systemizing it and building it into essentially think about it at scale as a protocolization of these core shared services that people can just plug into, but they can also become part owner in it. So it takes the whole Web Three thesis and bakes it into a very needed service, but also making it accessible globally and incentivizing behaviors that actually create value for the network as a whole.
00:20:24.630 - 00:20:48.410, Speaker A: I'm wondering how much of your clientele is kind of these younger generations that are drawn to independent work, because the hierarchical frame of employment just isn't bringing them happiness and joy and freedom versus older generation. Just by the law of entropy and the directionality of time in the universe, these younger generations are going to become older, and they're going to want to do things like have a mortgage and have psychological safety and financial stability.
00:20:52.930 - 00:21:03.070, Speaker C: It's interesting. This is actually a really interesting and curious phenomenon. So when you say older generations, are you talking about like Boomers or Xers?
00:21:05.170 - 00:21:24.390, Speaker A: I'm assuming that your clientele right now is like younger millennials and gen zers, but eventually they're going to become older and want to get puppies and then get mortgages and then have kids one day. And I'm just wondering how this ecosystem matures to provide that financial stability and all of those things that people just naturally want as they get older.
00:21:24.810 - 00:22:26.390, Speaker C: Yeah. So if you look at the social anthropology of employment, it's very clear that it was designed to cater to the desires of safety and security. So the idea the social contract back in the day, day, post World War II, height of the industrial Revolution was, look, you come and work in my auto factory and in exchange for that, I'm going to give you a pension that you're going to earn over time, come do it for 30 years. You're going to retire completely. Great. And you're going to be able to buy a car for your family, have a really nice home, and it's going to beat the shit out of a 10% mortality rate and working in a steel mill. Okay? So the social upclassing that you saw happening in the early days or even the mid days of the industrial Revolution was there was a clear exchange going on for safety and security was the core.
00:22:26.390 - 00:23:37.246, Speaker C: Now that social desire came from things like the Great Depression, world War II, that created a ton of uncertainty and a lot of social pain, economic pain for people. So they saw this trade off. It's like, well, shit, okay, so if I basically come and do this for you and we sort of build this social contract based on loyalty, you're going to take care of me and my family economically and also from a prosperity standpoint, the quotient of prosperity went up a bunch, right? So there was a really big upgrade in social status that happened around that time, but at the core of it was always safety and security. So what you're talking about was not just in, I'm older, I want to put down roots, and safety and security is more important. But it was the undertone, maybe even the overtone of the social temperature at the time. So now you look at how employment is organized, which is really still supposedly safety and security driven, but there's no pensions anymore. There's no guarantees, there's no promises, there's no social contract of loyalty.
00:23:37.246 - 00:24:02.106, Speaker C: That's all gone. But we still do things the same way. And even the corporate virtue signaling still says a lot of the same stuff. But it's all bullshit, right? So we all know it's bullshit. We've seen the crash of 2008, we've seen the pandemic. We've seen how loyal corporations are. They're not okay, so the point being is the structure is the same, but the social goals are different now.
00:24:02.106 - 00:24:39.810, Speaker C: So freedom and flexibility are now the name of the game and it is in part being driven by a younger generation. But socially where they're getting this attitude is they're not seeing their older populations, their parents in some cases happy. So they're like, wait, this safety and security thing didn't work out well for you, did it buddy? Right, so screw that. I'm going to go, yolo my life, I don't care about the house and this and that. Now they will when they get a little older. So the gen zers will probably have a tendency to settle down a little bit more. But what's really interesting in this is the great resignation.
00:24:39.810 - 00:25:23.006, Speaker C: You look at the distribution of age. Yes, it's mostly millennial and Zetters, but it's still across all cohorts. So when you look at the migration out of the traditional labor force and the estimates in the US are 90 million independent workers by 2028, that's five years. Right now, we're about 45, maybe 40, 45 million. It's going to double, which represents over half of the US labor force because there's 160,000,000 active labor participants. So we're talking about a huge social shift. So the thing that's driving that is the broken social contract of employment.
00:25:23.006 - 00:25:51.894, Speaker C: There's no loyalty, there's no trust, there's no guarantee, so why do it? And then corporations on the other end of it are like, man, this is too risky, it's too expensive. Screw you, I can't do this. So it's like, okay, well, how do you design something that actually works for both parties? What's the next generation social contract around employment and how we create reciprocity and mutualistic relationships? That's where we got to go ahead, man.
00:25:51.952 - 00:25:58.794, Speaker A: You're making my job as host easy. Let me just roll out this one. What's the next generation social contract for web three workers?
00:25:58.842 - 00:26:32.534, Speaker C: John well, I think it's emerging, actually. I think we're experimenting with it right now. I think I've seen a lot of failed experiments where they try to replicate the old sort of subjugated model where it's like, well, when you work for the Dow, it's like, well, you're just trying to replicate employees then, but then they're like, well, but we can't get anybody to do anything. They're not productive. And it's like, well, then you have an accountability issue and you can't just micromanage people to productivity. You've got to be able to align skills, resources and time and actually create results. And it takes a different sort of recipe.
00:26:32.534 - 00:27:38.240, Speaker C: So what do I think it's going to end up being? I think we're going to move into what I would refer to as a statement of work culture, where if I want to engage with a Dow or anywhere really, they're going to tell me, okay, what are you going to do and buy when it's going to be objectively measured? And it's not going to be. So my reputation for work is going to be purely measured by my productivity. And I am going to take another bet that most of this is going to be done anonymously within ten years. I'll just be hiring people with highly skilled backgrounds to do very specific things, and I will have a really good gauge on whether or not they're going to be able to deliver what I need, when I need it. And if they deliver it, they'll get paid. And in some cases they'll get paid ongoingly. The streaming payrolls and other things will be much more real time.
00:27:40.610 - 00:27:55.730, Speaker A: I guess I got to ask, is the person who's trying to engineer this regenerative crypto economics ecosystem is where does the social safety net come from? If it's like, a statement of work culture and it's not going to be the end.
00:27:55.880 - 00:29:01.900, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's going to come from the community of workers. I think you're going to see potentially many different groups like Opelis that pop up that are sort of these guild of workers, like call them next generation unions or something. But we'll see DFI 2.0, maybe 3.0, maybe 4.0, where you have financial systems that are built into these ecosystems that help with things like mortgages or car loans or student loans or whatever, where essentially these communities are financing themselves and you will have a much more regenerative aligned input output system. If You're Doing this inside of communities versus, like, external banks or third Parties that Have Different interests, really, it's Creating These Next Generation systems inside Of These Marketplaces, which that's really What I Think Opolis does best At Scale is it Aggregates People Into A Single System that then Creates That Ability to Leverage that size For Other things.
00:29:01.900 - 00:29:16.270, Speaker C: Whether it's like I said, building next generation banking systems or lending systems or just plugging into other DeFi primitives to create that scale. I think that's going to be the power of it.
00:29:16.420 - 00:30:26.214, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm really interested. One solution I might be answering my own question here, but one solution to that that I had sort of seen is that our legacy insurance infrastructure and social safety net just has so much administrative overhead on it. What would need to be true for me to be able to deploy my own insurance cooperative where the people who are paying the premiums are subsidizing each other's health care and there's not some fat cat CEO who makes $35 million per year off of my insurance premium. What would have to be true to have these more peer to peer mutualistic social safety nets that we deploy together? And I think that the opportunity here is cutting out all the middlemen that have been extracting off of this infrastructure in the old world. And that gets me really excited because it's better for everyday people and not just these financial intermediaries that are on top of these things. And we're probably five to ten years out from that insurance cooperative that I just made up being a thing. But man, every time I see my premiums and how much I get from my insurance company, I just think the load, it can't bear load so much longer.
00:30:26.332 - 00:31:15.010, Speaker C: No, it can't. So I think the simplistic answer is the problem with the existing game design is the game incentives are misaligned. So at scale, if you look at the actors that you're referring to and what they do in terms of extracting value, they're incentivized to do that. That's success for them. In fact, the C Corp legal structure in the US. Mandates that directors and officers maximize profitability for shareholders. And those shareholders are not the employees, right? So the employees are the ones paying the bag.
00:31:15.010 - 00:32:14.946, Speaker C: So one of the things. That we've done with Opolis in the cooperative framework is we've created a for profit cooperative structure that still has incentives around growth, value accrual, and traditional sort of capitalistic endeavors. But it doesn't have at its core the same hardcore drivers around profit maximization, as you would see in a traditional web Two corporate model. But it's also not what I would call like a full nonprofit public good either. Right. Which I have sustainability questions around because you talk about this a lot, the question of how to fund public goods. Public goods are good, but what are the incentives and why don't people want to fund them? It's like nobody really cares about the kumbaya at the end of the day, they want the economic returns.
00:32:14.946 - 00:33:22.782, Speaker C: So the question is, how do you create economic returns in a regenerative model that has durability around aligned incentives for all stakeholders? And then how do you grow that pie so that at scale in Opelis's case? We see that happening at, let's say we got a million members. Well, one, that would make us one of the world's largest employers, literally, because we're aggregating employment from all over the place. Two, from a procurement standpoint, we could pretty much go do whatever the hell we want. And three, from a pooling of economic resources standpoint and underwriting, for example, actuarial analysis and creating funding pools around health care and other things, we could do it much more efficiently than any bureaucratic mechanism that exists that has again, screwed up incentives. Because these bureaucracies, if you look at why they do what they do, they're incentivized to do it. They're incentivized to be inefficient. So why would we expect that they're going to be efficient if they're incentivized to not be, they're not going to you know, I have a saying that I like with don't hate the player, build a better game.
00:33:22.782 - 00:34:07.494, Speaker C: So that's the whole point behind what Opolis is doing. So we feel like these engines that get built like Opolis, that can aggregate these people into procurement pools essentially, is what we're talking about, can then build these secondary layers, these insurance pools. That's the goal we don't want to be subjugated to. Well, let's put it this way. If we got to a million members in the US. We would absolutely, essentially create our own healthcare company and insurance company and we do it through a collective model, 100%. But then our stakeholders, our owners are the members, so we don't have incentive to just screw everybody and be overly extractive.
00:34:07.494 - 00:34:24.980, Speaker C: And then anybody who's a third party has the same incentives because value gets accrued the more we grow. So they want growth just like everybody else wants growth because it makes it good for everybody. So again, it's just figuring out how to durably and sustainably align incentives in a new game design.
00:34:27.670 - 00:34:49.418, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah. I think that we talk about web three as the future of finance in a lot of ways. And I think that where a lot of people's minds immediately go is towards investments. Decentralized finance. NFTs are obviously breakaway use case, which is funding art. But I think that man most people's financial lives is mostly their work.
00:34:49.418 - 00:34:54.250, Speaker A: And so this is such a key unlock for web Three going mainstream.
00:34:55.550 - 00:36:00.830, Speaker C: Well, I always say Opolis is the unsexy underbuildy of necessary evil bullshit that we all have to deal with. But it's the one use case that everybody has to touch. So we talk about NFTs, we talk about DeFi, we talk about next generation DeFi, we talk about whatever, okay, social networks. But at its core, this is fundamental to just doing life, right? So it's kind of like I said, the necessary evil that we all have to do. But it's kind of a great way to Trojan horse adoption and kind of get people thinking about things in new ways and give people optionality around these commercial decisions that otherwise they might not otherwise have it. So I think it's a great I mean, I often sell opolis is the biggest use case for web three. And if you take a giant step back, it makes a lot of sense, right? Like in the moment it's like, it's really like employment.
00:36:00.830 - 00:36:07.410, Speaker C: Some people get it, but some people are like, I mean, it's not the first thing you would think of. It's definitely not sexy.
00:36:08.390 - 00:36:55.650, Speaker A: Well, one of the questions I sort of have is it's one of those great power, great responsibility things? Web Three democratizes finance in so many different ways. And because of that, in a lot of ways, the things that have just been provided for us in the old system are not there. And so how do you not only be compliant, but once you start receiving tokens, what do you do with your tokens? How do you avoid pump and dump? Scams is a responsibility that's placed on users in web Three. And so I think it's like the ecosystem has got to evolve a more responsible way of onboarding people in general. But I think that for employment, opelis is definitely providing a key piece of that regen decentralized employment puzzle.
00:36:56.950 - 00:37:45.166, Speaker C: The word regen is really the crux of this. So my criticism of web Three crypto blockchain up to now is the narrative has been largely degenerative. And I'm not going to name names, but if you look around even the podcast circuit, you're one of the only people talking about Regent stuff all the time. Most of this stuff is still price driven, hype driven, FOMO driven memes, memes and hype. Memes and hype and what is that? Okay, well, it's dopamine it's OOH FOMO, right? Money economics. We're speaking to a very degenerative part of the brain. Now we all have the degen part of the brain, right? Like we're all human beings.
00:37:45.166 - 00:38:29.690, Speaker C: I have it too, but I don't think that we spend enough time talking about it's going to take more time I mean if you look at the last three cycles it's all been hype driven and Dgen driven. So there's a lot of good that comes out of it in terms of awareness, but in terms of durability, sustainability and credibility at the end of those cycles get kind of rugged a little bit. So I think the next cycle we keep talking about well, we haven't learned anything. No we haven't. We're humans. Look at the generational slow progression that we've made as humans. It's not that different in crypto.
00:38:29.690 - 00:39:25.818, Speaker C: So I think the next cycle is going to be slightly better and then slightly better and then slightly better. But it could take a little while. Now I do think there's going to be an inflection point. I'd like to think that a project like Opolis could spur that. I think gaming is another area where, for example, if there were a proven business model, sustainable one where people could participate in gaming and earn real incomes, you would see people flocking to that. Not just dgen stuff, not just like oh yeah, but with shitty economics and no sustainable, but like a real model that actually showed sustainable regenerative value being created in an ecosystem where people could contribute and participate in these gaming systems. Oh dude, people would flock to it, they would leave their corporate jobs in 2 seconds.
00:39:25.818 - 00:39:58.860, Speaker C: Now is that a good thing? Socially, I don't know, I'm not going to get into it. But as far as the behavior itself, sitting at a computer for 12 hours a day playing games probably isn't the best thing for social development for humans, but at the same time, it creates new opportunities. And if that gets replicated into more and more productive things, then it's just like once there's this new paradigm of opportunity, it could really rip the roof off it. And then things like Opolis take off as well. So it becomes a compounding effect. Socially. I think that's what we're going to see.
00:39:58.860 - 00:40:31.640, Speaker C: I think that people are cautious enough around scam coins and hype and bullshit that I don't know and then things like FTX and Celsius and Three Arrows. I think these are things that people are going to be on the lookout for, just be skeptical of which I think it's good. Yeah, I think the next cycle is going to be more real, I think. But when that happens, I don't know, we could be in winter for another two years.
00:40:32.890 - 00:40:43.500, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I think that we're getting towards the end of our time together. John, I'm wondering if there's anything I didn't ask that you want to say about Opelis ETH Denver, anything?
00:40:44.030 - 00:41:33.000, Speaker C: Well, I think for those who are really interested in the regen sort of fundamentals of know, I would recommend that you check out the Work Rewards program which is our tokenization of our community. I'd also recommend you read the off white paper which is sort of the manifesto of this decentralized employment organization's sort of cluster of orgs that will exist into the future. There's a bunch of really interesting, I think, I don't know, kind of the academic research work that we've done. So if you're genuinely interested in understanding more about Opolis as a live action experiment in Regen games, I'd check those things out for then, you know, of course I'll be around Denver, so come say hi.
00:41:34.490 - 00:41:47.440, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, John, thanks for supporting the regen movement. Really excited to see more people earn incomes via tokens and do it in a compliant, responsible way with Opelis. And yeah, see you to eat Denver, like you said.
00:41:47.970 - 00:41:50.110, Speaker C: Yeah, man. We'll have some tequila, dude.
00:41:50.770 - 00:41:52.410, Speaker A: Sounds good. Peace.
