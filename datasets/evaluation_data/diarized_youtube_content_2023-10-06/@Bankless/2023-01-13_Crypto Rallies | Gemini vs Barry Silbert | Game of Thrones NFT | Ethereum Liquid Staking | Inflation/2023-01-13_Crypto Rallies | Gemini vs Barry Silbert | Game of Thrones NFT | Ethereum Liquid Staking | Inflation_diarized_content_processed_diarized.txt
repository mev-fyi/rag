00:00:00.000 - 00:00:24.714, Speaker A: The Winklevi escalate their fight against Barry silbert and Digital currency group, causing Barry silbert to have to release letter to investors. Sam Bankman Freed, our favorite three letter acronym dude is doing more Sam Bankman free things. So get ready to face Palm. And Coinbase lays off 20% of its staff, while Finance is looking to increase its staff by 30%. Bankless nation.
00:00:24.762 - 00:00:31.202, Speaker B: It is the second Friday of January. We're in 2023. I hope you're ready for what are we about to give them, David?
00:00:31.266 - 00:00:43.334, Speaker A: The bankless Friday weekly roll up, Brian, where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless into 2023, which so far has been bullish.
00:00:43.462 - 00:00:44.902, Speaker B: Has been so far bullish.
00:00:44.966 - 00:00:47.770, Speaker A: Numbers are twelve days week, twelve days of green.
00:00:47.840 - 00:01:02.938, Speaker B: Yeah, we got some double digit green, too. We're going to get to that in the markets. Also going to talk about digital currency group versus the Winklevoss twins. The fight has escalated even further on Twitter, of course, because where else do modern people fight? Got to be in public, got to be on Twitter.
00:01:03.034 - 00:01:03.870, Speaker A: We'll cover that.
00:01:03.940 - 00:01:09.250, Speaker B: We'll tell you what's going on there, and we'll see if we can draw any conclusions from that. What else are we talking about today?
00:01:09.320 - 00:01:38.026, Speaker A: Meanwhile, FTX discovers $5 billion under the couch cushions. Wow, that's pretty sweet. SPF requests access to his Robin Hood shares in order to pay for his legal defense. You'll never guess what happens next. Then, sadly, Coinbase has to lay off 20% of the staff ahead of Crypto Winter, but Finance is hiring. And then Ryan's also going to walk us through some CPI numbers as well, because we got that literally this morning, just a few hours ago.
00:01:38.128 - 00:01:41.722, Speaker B: Inflation's deflating. Inflation down. So that's good news.
00:01:41.776 - 00:01:43.210, Speaker A: Inflation deflation.
00:01:43.890 - 00:01:59.010, Speaker B: Let's talk about that in a little bit. But first, got to tell you about our friends and sponsors over at Osmosis. Osmosis is a Cosmos app chain that specializes in DeFi. David, you want to tell the Bankless Nation about this cool app chain and what it can do?
00:01:59.080 - 00:02:42.014, Speaker A: Yeah, it's the liquidity app chain of the Cosmos ecosystem. And so if you ever listen to our episode, why UniChain is inevitable with Dan Elitezer, he gave the case as to why uniswap will eventually produce its own application chain. Osmosis is the instantiation of that thesis inside of the Cosmos ecosystem, and it is perhaps the place to get started. If you are interested in exploring the Cosmos ecosystem, you can bridge right in to Osmosis from ethereum, polygon, binance, polkadot, Arbitrum, all the highly used places. And you can do some things, the normal things that you would do on any sort of dex. You can swap tokens. But because it's an aft chain, you can do some other cool things as well, like liquid staking and other things like this.
00:02:42.014 - 00:02:51.038, Speaker A: So if you want to explore the Osmosis universe and the Cosmos ecosystem, there's a link in the show notes, you can go to Osmosis Zone Bankless.
00:02:51.134 - 00:03:05.350, Speaker B: You know, David, I wouldn't have said this a year ago, but DFI in the Cosmos ecosystem has really matured and I think it's worth exploring some in 2023. At least that's been part of my New Year's resolution. All right, David, let's get to markets. We got the happy music.
00:03:05.420 - 00:03:07.398, Speaker A: I hope it's happy because very happy.
00:03:07.484 - 00:03:09.558, Speaker B: Bitcoin is up. Tell me about it.
00:03:09.644 - 00:03:23.018, Speaker A: Oh, it's up bigly. It's up 8.7% starting the week at $16,800, ending where it is right now at a whopping $18,250.08.7% on the week.
00:03:23.104 - 00:03:27.294, Speaker B: Is this up on CPI? Is this up on Macro? Why are we up?
00:03:27.412 - 00:04:03.420, Speaker A: Well, okay, so if you look in the far right on the screen, you see that big red candle that goes from like $18,000 down like 1800 down below 18. That was right after the CPI print. So CPI print came out and then it jumped $200, down two or $300, and then immediately jumped right back up to where it is now at $18,250. But it's been running up all throughout the last week or so, and especially yesterday. This also happened to Ether too. It went from $17,400 and just zoomed straight up to $18,400 inside of like half a day.
00:04:03.950 - 00:04:08.682, Speaker B: Crypto is kind of following the market a little bit, I think. I wonder what the correlation looks like right now.
00:04:08.736 - 00:04:09.706, Speaker A: You mean trad market?
00:04:09.808 - 00:04:22.926, Speaker B: Yeah, trad market stocks and such, I guess just more so. Well, maybe this was a disproportionately good week for crypto, though, even though trades went up. Okay, what happened with ETH price? That's a big story, too. Yeah.
00:04:22.948 - 00:04:52.714, Speaker A: Ether started the week at one $250 where it's been hovering around being just like the one $200 stablecoin for the past like two months. Up twelve and a half percent all the way up to one $400. It hit a high of one $420, which was the high exact high of 2017, by the way. There's that number again. Yeah, fell down. Did the same thing at Bitcoin. As soon as the CPI print came out, it dropped down to 1350, but has since recovered in that moment back up to one $400, where we are now.
00:04:52.714 - 00:04:55.818, Speaker A: So up twelve and a half percent on the week.
00:04:55.904 - 00:05:09.194, Speaker B: The question David and I are about to discuss in a little bit is have we bottomed yet? Think about that listener as we get to the next section. But first we'll talk about the ETH to Bitcoin ratio, an important ratio in this market. What's that showing?
00:05:09.322 - 00:05:29.574, Speaker A: We are up three and a half percent on the week. It's been a very good week for the ratio. It's harder. So moving it, the ratio is harder than the dollar. Crypto prices move very a lot versus the dollar, but Ether and Bitcoin, they don't move as much in relation to each other. So 3.5% is actually like a decent move.
00:05:29.574 - 00:05:36.214, Speaker A: We are currently clocking in at zero 76. We hit a high of zero, 78.
00:05:36.332 - 00:05:53.998, Speaker B: David, this is not the ETH of the last bear market, is it? This is a totally different ETH. I think we can see it here. Here's ultrasound money. A number you and I were looking at earlier in the week was the supply change since the implementation down 1000.
00:05:54.084 - 00:05:55.230, Speaker A: ETH in a week?
00:05:55.380 - 00:06:23.174, Speaker B: Yeah. So over the last 120 days, guys, ETH has only increased in its total issuance total supply. And this is, of course, selling pressure by 2000 ETH, right? It's not ultrasound, it's not deflationary at this point, but only 2000 ETH versus what it would normally be and what it was in the previous bear market, we would have added 1.4 million ETH supply. What does that equate to? David, run some numbers for me. What does that equate to in terms.
00:06:23.212 - 00:06:27.382, Speaker A: Of rounding up slightly to $2 billion?
00:06:27.516 - 00:06:46.162, Speaker B: $2 billion of sell pressure just eliminated, not have. And that was in last bear market. No wonder ETH went all the way down 94% and way underperformed bitcoin. Different ETH different asset completely. And so I'm actually not surprised to see the gains on the ratio.
00:06:46.246 - 00:06:53.322, Speaker A: Let's zoom out on this chart really quick, if you don't mind. Let's go out. Let's go out. Really? How far do you want to go now? The candles are getting super tiny.
00:06:53.386 - 00:06:55.060, Speaker B: These Kraken charts can do anything.
00:06:55.510 - 00:07:18.982, Speaker A: Yeah. If listeners are wondering, the sexy new interface is the Kraken Pro new interface. Kraken Pro has really got a cosmetic upgrade lately. So thank you for Kraken, for serving us these ever important prices. So we have a lot of time left to start filling out this bear market candles. There's probably if this follows the last bear market, a lot more volatility. Still has to leave.
00:07:18.982 - 00:07:20.230, Speaker A: We're just going to find a bottom.
00:07:20.300 - 00:07:23.494, Speaker B: Yeah, look at this over here, right? Bottom chop back in 2018.
00:07:23.542 - 00:08:00.710, Speaker A: But I mean, if you compare those two peaks, you can kind of tell we're at the tail end of just like the depression of the peaks. Maybe there was that one moment back in June, July of 2018 where ether and bitcoin started to flatten out. I think bitcoin was flattening out at 6000, ether was flattening out at like, 300. And they're like, okay, fine, we established a bottom. And then the bottom fell out and we went down like another 50%. So if we are trying to say that this is the same as last cycle, then that would still be ahead of us. But I don't necessarily think that that's ahead of us.
00:08:00.780 - 00:08:30.990, Speaker B: I do think that ETH is a different asset this cycle. And it might be more apt to compare ETH to bitcoin of previous cycle than ETH to ETH of previous cycle. I don't know if that draws any insight, but I was just looking earlier. So ETH is down 71% from all time high. Bitcoin is down 73% more than ETH. That's certainly not the case. Last bear market where Bitcoin was surviving and doing okay when Bitcoin was and ETH was completely getting destroyed.
00:08:30.990 - 00:08:34.914, Speaker B: Very interesting. Okay, what about total crypto market cap?
00:08:35.112 - 00:08:47.526, Speaker A: We're got to be below above 900 billion. So we were finally back above 900 billion. We were at $919,000,000,000. Okay, well, since we've seen a nine, there it is.
00:08:47.628 - 00:09:14.942, Speaker B: Let's talk about the inflation numbers. They came out earlier this week, they were good. December inflation report. The headline is Consumer price gains continue to cool. Here's the chart for you, David. Do you see this kind of spike for inflation? This is a fully zoomed out chart all the way from 1965 all the way to 2023 where we are now and we're down to 6.5% inflation for December and that of course low number of 6.5%.
00:09:14.942 - 00:09:40.982, Speaker B: Well, it peaked in June 9.1% and ever since we've been going down down. Last month that we saw a report, November was 7.1%, now it's 6.5%. The reason the market reacted favorably ish to that was because it was just exactly at what was predicted by the market. The street was saying 6.5%, we came in at 6.5%.
00:09:40.982 - 00:10:16.966, Speaker B: This of course is still well above the Fed's mission, which is a 2% inflation rate. Maybe they'll increase that to 3%. That's what some are saying powell's holding firm that the target is 2%. And then of note, of course, before the pandemic, before all of this chaos that you see from 2020 onwards, inflation used to be 2.1%, used to be the most boring number in all of finance because for the last decade or two it's always been like 2%, never changed. Quite volatile these days. What do you think? Are we done with inflation?
00:10:17.098 - 00:11:08.814, Speaker A: So we just recorded our podcast with Tyler Cowan, which comes out on Monday, and he mentioned that we really need to see three months in a row of decreasing inflation to really feel okay ish in confidence about the trend was. And we recorded with him a few days ago, and this was the print that we were looking for to see if it would continue to trend down for three months in a row. And it is. And so he said three months is what you need to start having some amount of confidence. So I think we are in the earliest stages of being able to have some amount of confidence about a downwards trend and I think every single month after that, where we continue to print lower, we're just going to start stacking on the confidence and the confidence and the confidence and that's really what it takes for risk appetite to come back. And so we are on to the first of many boxes that are checked but it is the right step in the right direction.
00:11:08.942 - 00:11:32.082, Speaker B: Well, let's switch back to the crypto cycles again. So some people are saying there was a lot of leverage in the system, quite obvious, built up in 2021 and 2022 and now that leverage is gone, it's been washed out, it's been flushed down the toilet. Bye bye. 3 hours capital and all of the margin traders that got completely wrecked. This is a tweet from Jack. Do you want to tell us what he's saying?
00:11:32.156 - 00:12:21.094, Speaker A: Yeah, Jack is saying over leverage was the theme of the year. It was really the theme of the entire bull market being over leveraged. But how much leverage remains in the system this year, he asks. Despite major blows from incumbents like FTX, bitcoin liquidations are down significantly in the second half of 2022, suggesting that the majority of leverage has been washed out. And that's probably also why we're seeing a lot less volatility in crypto asset prices, is that leverage is volatile, leverage adds to volatility and now that things are stable, there's less incentive to take leverage because you can't really trade as much in this market. But you're just seeing a lot lower liquidations, both on the long and short side, meaning that we are in a much more healthy, much more grounded phase in the market, which implies that we are closer to a bottom than we otherwise would be if we had a lot of leverage.
00:12:21.222 - 00:12:42.378, Speaker B: Well, let's just flat out ask the question I did on Twitter, has crypto bottomed? This was a results poll. 44% said yes, 55% .3 said no. So kind of pretty even. I call that even a little more saying no. What's your answer to that? Have we bottomed yet, David? Have we seen the all time lows of this cycle?
00:12:42.474 - 00:12:55.700, Speaker A: Yeah, when we hit below $800 Ether and below $16,000 for Bitcoin, I don't think we're going back there. Ether got down to $870 or something.
00:12:56.230 - 00:12:58.574, Speaker B: That is the question. Do you think we bottomed?
00:12:58.702 - 00:12:59.990, Speaker A: I don't think we're going below that.
00:13:00.060 - 00:13:01.890, Speaker B: I think that was in your predictions.
00:13:02.050 - 00:13:07.960, Speaker A: I think you're still cautiously worried about a three digit Ether and I still don't think that's going to happen.
00:13:08.410 - 00:13:20.762, Speaker B: I don't necessarily think we'll go below the 800. Was it like 800 something? I can't remember what the bottom tick was for ETH, but something really bad would have to happen.
00:13:20.816 - 00:13:22.462, Speaker A: Yeah, it would have to be another event.
00:13:22.596 - 00:13:40.226, Speaker B: I mean, go back and look how strong ETH is from a supply perspective. Right. It would have to be something that utterly shakes the confidence of existing holders. And I can't actually think about what that would be if like, Coinbase would.
00:13:40.248 - 00:13:43.250, Speaker A: Have to go insolvent or Binance would have to go insolvent or something like that.
00:13:43.320 - 00:13:58.726, Speaker B: I mean, I really do feel like, and we'll talk about this a little bit later, that the digital currency group piece is the last bit of contagion. That's really where we ended the year and that still feels kind of to be the case. But can you make Ether bottomed at.
00:13:58.748 - 00:14:00.700, Speaker A: $880, by the way?
00:14:03.390 - 00:14:29.700, Speaker B: I guess I'm making things less interesting by agreeing with you, but I'm also going to say crypto bottomed. Now, that doesn't mean, we're not in for a lot of chop and a lot of stagnation and this whole apathy phase ahead. I still think that's in store. But can you make the Steel Man the argument that crypto has not bottomed yet? What would somebody who is still bearish on crypto say? What do you think would be their main arguments here?
00:14:30.470 - 00:14:55.302, Speaker A: I'm not going to be very good at this. You had the complacency bottom first. We had like, the leverage and flush out bottom, which we think happened. And then you were talking about a complacency bottom or like, sweet. Now crypto is going to be boring for like two years in a row and people are going to be frustrated that nothing exciting is happening in the crypto markets. And then like two years down, people are just like, this is boring, I'm out. There's opportunity elsewhere.
00:14:55.302 - 00:15:18.734, Speaker A: And so people sell for the complacency bottom. That marks actually the beginning of the next bull market. I think there's that. But again, I don't give much credence to that. And then there's actually more contagion that we really know about when DCG, it's totally going to go under. They're going to sell everything that they got. That's going to put a lot of sell pressure into the market and that can do another round of cascading liquidations for over leveraged players.
00:15:18.734 - 00:15:21.440, Speaker A: That would be the other case. I don't think that's going to happen.
00:15:21.830 - 00:15:51.306, Speaker B: I think that would be the Steel Man argument, is just that there's this apathy drop and it's gradual and it's over time and it's basically in crypto. If there's nothing new in crypto, that means down by default, there's nothing new. People lose interest, it's down. And so you kind of have to bet that nothing new is going to happen. Apathy will creep in over the next year or two. David I got to say, I can't get behind the case that nothing new is going to happen in crypto. There's so much building going on.
00:15:51.306 - 00:15:52.886, Speaker B: There's so much mean.
00:15:52.928 - 00:16:12.014, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a big difference between last bull market or last bear market and this bear market. There's so much energy in pockets. There's pockets of very strong energy. Like the Arbitrum ecosystem. I've been hanging out with the treasure ecosystem. The smallers they're crazy, dude. They're nuts.
00:16:12.014 - 00:16:32.630, Speaker A: They have so much energy. And during the 2018 to 2020 bear market, it was just like you and me and the investor and Anthony Suzano and Molochano moloch out was like the most interesting thing that we had. It was just like, hey guys, how's your anyone new? How's your week going? Anything new with you?
00:16:32.700 - 00:16:34.200, Speaker B: Eat this money, right?
00:16:34.650 - 00:16:35.400, Speaker A: Guys?
00:16:36.330 - 00:16:45.566, Speaker B: This is a chart you put together and this is kind of a commentary on on the cycle and where the last cycle actually topped. Can you explain what you're showing here.
00:16:45.588 - 00:17:13.640, Speaker A: David yeah, so this is a little bit of a messy chart, but that's because I had to layer the same charts upon each other over and over and over. So the only thing that is uniform about this is time. Prices are not uniform, of course, but all time lines up. And so we've got the Salana, the Luna, the Polygon, and the Ethereum chart. Salana is the main one that you see in purple. Luna is the gold one that's kind of invisible, but it's different colors, so you can kind of see it. And it's also the one that goes to zero in May.
00:17:13.640 - 00:17:40.766, Speaker A: And then there's Polygon, which is like the cyan color. And then there's Ethereum, which is the normal coin gecko blue color in the very background. And you can kind of just see the progress of the bull market. Go on. We've said it before, it was Ethereum's show for all of 2021 and then the first half of 2022. And that is where I am, like, hovering my cursor over it. Right now you can't really see because my cursor is white.
00:17:40.766 - 00:18:01.906, Speaker A: Yeah, Ryan's got it. That peak right there, it was Ethereum's bull market. And that's also when gas fees hit like $600. And people newcomers were like, I'm so excited about crypto, but I can't use Ethereum. What else can I do? And that's when Salana started its bull run. It's also when Polygon started its bull run. And so then that's when Salana hit all time highs.
00:18:01.906 - 00:18:24.986, Speaker A: At around the same time, Ether hit all time highs, $4,900. Salana hit its all time highs of something like 250. And then Polygon Luna not too long after that. A few months after that hit its all time highs and then went to zero immediately after hitting all time highs. I just think it's a nice way to kind of do an audit as to how these markets progressed.
00:18:25.018 - 00:18:42.566, Speaker B: Well, this is what Vance Spencer Spencer called everything after something like April or May of 2021 was the Low Conviction Rally. So first we had the High Conviction Rally that you see kind of up to here. And I felt like that lasted through kind of like March of 2021.
00:18:42.568 - 00:18:49.782, Speaker A: And that was a lot of bear market OGS like us saying, everything that's happening right now makes sense.
00:18:49.836 - 00:19:11.040, Speaker B: Oh, dude. I remember for months before, I would just tweet out on the regular, like, ETH is stupidly underpriced, right? And I just hit like, it's still stupid. It's 300, it's still stupid. I would keep doing that. And I kept tweeting until about now, that I recall, until about ETH was above 1000 till March of 2021. And then I stopped tweeting. That right.
00:19:11.040 - 00:19:35.182, Speaker B: But that felt real to me. Everything after this was like narrative, clearly, a lot of margin. It was a lot of kind of greed. It was the market getting carried away. They call this the exuberance phase. This is not particular to crypto. This happens in every single market where human psychology is involved, which is all markets.
00:19:35.182 - 00:19:41.590, Speaker B: And so I don't think the market was very honest, past April of 2021.
00:19:41.740 - 00:20:14.714, Speaker A: Past $2,000 ether, which it hit in April of 2021, I think, is when we got carried away with leverage as an industry. And that's exemplified by the fact that Ether goes from inside of like, six weeks, and then it crashed from $4,300 down to $1,700 from May to June of 2021. And that was the first indication that hindsight 2020, that this market is now based on leverage. Everyone is taking leverage. This is now the full blown casino.
00:20:14.762 - 00:20:29.382, Speaker B: It's no coincidence that now if you want to buy ETH, you're paying like, first quarter, 2021 prices, basically, because that was back to the time when the market made more sense in the pre leveraged time. All right, Dave, we got a lot more to talk about other than markets, of course. What's coming up next?
00:20:29.516 - 00:20:56.970, Speaker A: Coming up next, the Winklevi escalate their fight against Barry Silbert and Digital Currency Group, causing Barry Silbert to have to release letter to investors. Sam Bankman Freed, our favorite three letter acronym dude is doing more Sam Bankman free things. So get ready to face Palm. And Coinbase lays off 20% of its staff, while Finance is looking to increase its staff by 30%. So all of these conversations and more. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors to help you. Go, Bankless.

00:21:46.526 - 00:22:05.074, Speaker A: Rarity rankings, no gas fees, and the ability to buy an NFT straight with cash. Does your crypto exchange prioritize its customers the way that Kraken does? And if not, sign up with Kraken@kraken.com Slash. Bankless. How many total Airdrops have you gotten? This last bull market had a ton of them. Did you get them all? Maybe you missed one. So here's what you should do.
00:22:05.074 - 00:22:38.314, Speaker A: Go to Earnify and plug in your Ethereum wallet. And Earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get. And it also does Poaps and mintable NFTs any kind of money that your wallet can claim. Earnify will tell you about it. And you should probably do it now because some airdrops expire and if you sign up for Earnify, they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new AirDrop for it to make sure that you never lose an AirDrop ever again. You can also upgrade to Earnify premium to unlock access to Airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets. And for just under $21 a month, it probably pays for itself with just one AirDrop.
00:22:38.314 - 00:22:45.950, Speaker A: So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get that's Earnifi and make sure you never lose another AirDrop.
00:22:46.030 - 00:23:05.394, Speaker B: Here it is. Digital currency. Group versus Gemini. Round two, round three, round four. I don't know what round we're in, David. Okay. Cameron Winklevoss tweeted another open letter out, this time to the Board of Digital Currency Group, which of course the board appoints the leader of Digital Currency Group, which is the CEO Barry Silbert.
00:23:05.394 - 00:23:44.162, Speaker B: Seems like there is definitely a feud going on. I don't know. David, if you want to pull out any colorful quotes from this open letter, I will say the TLDR is Cameron wants Barry fired. He says he's unfit for duty, basically, and that the board should he's proven himself here's a quote unfit to run DCG and unwilling and unable to find a resolution with creditors that is both fair and reasonable. As a result, Gemini acting on behalf of its 340,000 Earn users wow, that's a lot. Request that the board remove Barry Silbert as CEO, effective immediately. Wow.
00:23:44.162 - 00:23:49.090, Speaker B: Shot across the bow. Actually, that's more than a shot across the bow. Maybe that's a direct shot.
00:23:49.250 - 00:24:34.174, Speaker A: That's a criminal charge from Cameron Winklevoss to Barry Silber. And the things that if you read this full thing, it's actually pretty interesting. He's basically saying that Genesis gave Gemini and Gemini Earn information that made them believe that Gemini was totally solvent and that was only true based off of misleading and fraudulent statements and accounting fraud took the books. Yes. And so whether or not this is true or not, we'll take an investigation into Grayscale and into Barry Silbert. But that's kind of what Cameron is saying. This is what we need because we as operators of Gemini Earn, feel rugged because of misleading and fraudulent statements as of Barry Silbert and Genesis and Grayscale.
00:24:34.174 - 00:24:44.370, Speaker A: And so he's documenting all of these things that he is claiming is true about Genesis and Barry Silbert and putting this into a letter which he then released on Twitter.
00:24:44.450 - 00:25:09.482, Speaker B: There's also some righteous indignation here because it's not just Cameron in Gemini, but he keeps talking about retail. 340,000 Gemini Earn users who effectively are out of money. Their money is locked in digital currency group. So he's kind of shifting that onto DCG. Not all is healthy in DCG world as well. So what is this headline?
00:25:09.626 - 00:26:04.358, Speaker A: Yeah, so there is a wealth management division out of DCG that is shutting down and this actually isn't news. This was released as intention from Barry Silber not too long ago, but parts of the Digital Currency Group are winding down. Genesis is actually laying off a bunch of staff and so they're doing a bunch of cost cutting coming up for the crypto winter. And of course, they have that hole in their balance sheet that everyone knows about. So in the Digital Currency Group side of things, they are just doing kind of the same thing that everyone else is doing, which is trimming the fat, cutting costs, retracting for the winter, and so that's kind of par for the course. Barry Silbert, however, did release letter to investors, a letter to shareholders of Digital Currency Group. And this was basically in response to Cameron Winklevoss, although not actually officially in response, but you read between the lines.
00:26:04.358 - 00:26:05.394, Speaker A: It's like this is being sent out.
00:26:05.432 - 00:26:08.114, Speaker B: To his shareholders, technically, but he said.
00:26:08.232 - 00:26:34.118, Speaker A: Yes, but it's been definitely inspired and motivated by being charged with fraud by the Cameron Winklevoff. So he starts off the letter saying, first, I'm incredibly proud of the role that DCG and I have played as pioneers and builders over the past ten years. He then goes on to list a bunch of accomplishments from DCG. He says, I have fond memories of the early days of our industry, working hard to educate, fighting in the trenches with fellow entrepreneurs and investors, looking to gain legitimacy for crypto.
00:26:34.214 - 00:26:39.658, Speaker B: It's funny because he's been here for a while. I mean, so has the Winkle vostwins, but so has he.
00:26:39.744 - 00:26:48.442, Speaker A: Yeah, he continued and he's kind of like, kind of trying to prop himself up. It's like, hey, I believe in done, I'm an OG. Yeah, I've been here working in the trenches.
00:26:48.506 - 00:26:55.946, Speaker B: Look at this line. Speaking at conferences to rooms with three people, getting snickered at on CNBC. Right? He's like, I am deep crypto.
00:26:56.058 - 00:27:51.058, Speaker A: He then continues, in contrast, the past year has been the most difficult of my life, both personally and professionally. Bad actors repeated blow ups wreaked havoc on our industry, with ripple effects extending far and wide. Although DCG, our subsidiaries and many of our portfolio companies are not immune to the effects of the present turmoil, it has been challenging to have my integrity and good intentions questioned after spending a decade pouring everything into this company and the space with an unrelenting focus on doing things the right way. So this is the part that's like, basically the response to Cameron Winklevoss saying, I am offended that I'm being charged of these things. And he then finishes this letter saying, I hope this letter and the accompanying Q A. There's A-Q-A in this letter, which we don't have time to go into, but it's linked in the show notes that explains other developments and addresses some of the speculation about DCG, some of which is reasonable, and some of that is completely baseless and false. Hopefully this helps clarify our position.
00:27:51.058 - 00:27:53.010, Speaker A: So that was Barry Silver's response.
00:27:53.430 - 00:28:18.278, Speaker B: We don't know the full. Truth yet, right? The easy answer, it would seem, is if everything's going okay, can't you just give the $900 million back to Gemini Earn customers? I'm sure it's definitely not that simple, of course, but we do know authorities are definitely involved. So DCG is being investigated right now by the doga and by the SEC as well. So I'm sure the truth will emerge.
00:28:18.454 - 00:28:40.510, Speaker A: Yeah, but specifically, the report says that neither Genesis nor DCG has been accused of any wrongdoing. So they are investigating, and the Department of justice is investigating along with the SEC, DCG, and they have said that they are not charging Genesis or DCG with anything of wrongdoing. It just feels like taking a peek.
00:28:40.590 - 00:28:59.078, Speaker B: We're kind of in the he said, she said moment of things. We're like one of them's probably right. Or there's some truth in the middle, but we just don't know yet. We don't have kind of all of the facts in this case. So I don't think this will be the last time we talk about DCG. But the last domino has not fully fallen yet. David, what else we got to talk about?
00:28:59.164 - 00:29:23.866, Speaker A: Oh, you know, our good friend SBF. So there's no real rhyme or reason to these flow of stories, so we're just going to go through them one by one. First up, the most comical one, SBF seeks access to his Robin Hood shares worth about half a billion dollars, 450,000,000, because he needs to pay for legal fees. So SBF is like, hey, can I have some of my money so I can pay for legal fees? Guess what happened, Ryan, just a few days later?
00:29:23.988 - 00:29:24.418, Speaker B: What?
00:29:24.504 - 00:29:27.358, Speaker A: The United States government seized the Robin Hood shares.
00:29:27.454 - 00:29:28.100, Speaker B: Wow.
00:29:28.550 - 00:29:43.110, Speaker A: So the answer to that question was no. No, you cannot have yeah. There are now. Thank you for that. Half a billion dollars in other parts of the Sam Bankman. Freed I don't know, debacle, I guess, is when you yeah. Titan.
00:29:43.110 - 00:29:58.090, Speaker A: They found FTX has found over $5 billion of what they call cash liquid cryptocurrency liquid investment securities, and measured at the date in question. So the recent times they found money, they found $5 billion.
00:29:58.160 - 00:30:01.162, Speaker B: They say that's the change in the couch you were talking about.
00:30:01.216 - 00:30:21.214, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. The $5 billion have changed. Have you looked in your couch cushions lately, Ryan? You might find $5 billion. Importantly, in this memo that they've released, they do not ascribe any value to the holdings of dozens of illiquid crypto assets, which are holdings that are so large relative to the total supply that our positions cannot be sold without substantially affecting the market for the token.
00:30:21.262 - 00:30:21.474, Speaker B: Sure.
00:30:21.512 - 00:30:31.414, Speaker A: So they're saying that they're not counting the illiquid tokens that they can't sell, and it's still billion, which implies that, wow, that's 5 billion real dollars.
00:30:31.612 - 00:30:33.782, Speaker B: We're talking people 40%.
00:30:33.916 - 00:30:51.542, Speaker A: People are not buying this. People are not buying this. And so this is a tweet from Connor, who I'm not familiar with but he just says $5 billion. Question mark. I went through every wallet I could find that FTX owns. The biggest positions are 700 million of Sol, mostly locked. 575,000,000 of FTT.
00:30:51.542 - 00:31:10.766, Speaker A: 371,000,000 Ft does not count. Yeah, sorry. A bunch of millions of dollars of other tokens that I'm not familiar with. $90 million of WBTC maps. Maybe they know something about that we don't. And maybe they know Ethereum addresses and other addresses that we don't. But if these are the addresses, then that $5 billion is questionable.
00:31:10.766 - 00:31:36.598, Speaker A: So we are unsure. I think the jury is still out as to how much money was actually found. All right, well, in fantastic FTX fashion. So, the same Connor Twitter account says, my simple model is that the estate, the FTX estate, wants a win and good publicity to talk about all the progress they've made. In my opinion, this $5 billion number vastly overstates what they could sell in an open market and improperly sets creditor expectations of a high percentage of asset recovery.
00:31:36.694 - 00:31:40.506, Speaker B: Don't give us hope yet. Don't give any of the creditors hope. It's probably a lot worse than that.
00:31:40.608 - 00:31:49.658, Speaker A: But they were very clear. We have located $5 billion of cash, liquid cryptocurrency, and liquid investment securities. That's a very clear statement.
00:31:49.754 - 00:32:13.014, Speaker B: That was very clear. Yeah. I hope that would be backed by something more than we saw in those tweets. This is a tweet as well, coming out. This is breaking. As of earlier this week, prosecutors are telling lawyers connected to SBF, the fraud investigation case, that the case is so sprawling that it could exhaust resources of the Southern District since it includes potential bribery. Count them.
00:32:13.014 - 00:32:22.614, Speaker B: That's one, campaign contribution violations, two, market manipulation, three, on top of theft and fraud. That's a lot of things.
00:32:22.732 - 00:32:24.086, Speaker A: Such a lot of things that it.
00:32:24.108 - 00:32:32.446, Speaker B: Could exhaust the entire Southern District's ability to actually prosecute these things. Some, I think, called this a DDoS attack.
00:32:32.548 - 00:32:32.766, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:32:32.788 - 00:32:51.086, Speaker A: I bet you if you scroll down, you'll see Nick Carter. He's like the old legal system. Dos attack, denial of service attack. That's like a loophole inside of the universe. Is like, if you can do so many illegal things that the court system can't finance itself to sue you, you can get away with a portion of them. I mean, you're still going to jail.
00:32:51.118 - 00:32:59.718, Speaker B: For life, but okay, well, yeah, exhausting an entire district's capability to prosecute you, it's crazy.
00:32:59.804 - 00:33:04.230, Speaker A: You are so incredibly illegal that an entire district doesn't have the money to sue you.
00:33:04.300 - 00:33:20.378, Speaker B: So this happened, too, this morning. Just tweeted this out. It's a link to his substack. SPF has a substac? Apparently now brand new. And the title of this article is FTX Pre Mortem Overview. And Sam just gives a complete overview of what happened.
00:33:20.464 - 00:33:31.406, Speaker A: An audit. Did you read this perspective? I was skimming through it to see if there was anything new, but I think it was just like a documentation of all of the stuff that he's been saying on Twitter spaces, you know.
00:33:31.428 - 00:33:58.066, Speaker B: What it was to me because I haven't watched all the Twitter spaces. It's just like shifting blame. Right. Basically the second sentence here, at the end of the day, FTX is just somewhere between that of Voyager and Celsius. We're not that bad in between Voyager and Celsius. Okay, look at all these there's a lot of that conversation about being not as bad as Voyager, genesis, Celsius, Blockfly, Gemini. It happened to all of us, all as a group.
00:33:58.066 - 00:34:27.822, Speaker B: There were comments about down here, David, about how crazy the market actually was, the 2022 market crashes. He goes in this narrative and he says, then over the course of the year, markets crashed again and again and again. And Alameda reportedly fails to sufficiently hedge his position until summer. Bitcoin crashed 30%. Bitcoin crashed another 30%, bitcoin crashed another 30%. And then he lists all of the things that happened in 22. I'm like, yeah, it's freaking crypto.
00:34:27.822 - 00:34:28.818, Speaker B: The hell?
00:34:28.984 - 00:34:31.934, Speaker A: He doesn't know that. Dude, are you new? Sam bakeman friedwood.
00:34:31.982 - 00:34:37.126, Speaker B: Yes. He was a first cycler trader. New. He's a first cycler and he was.
00:34:37.148 - 00:34:38.930, Speaker A: Born in an up only paradigm.
00:34:39.010 - 00:34:59.946, Speaker B: David earlier in this, he was bragging about and I don't know if any of this is justified, but something about that, like Alameda on the book, should have had enough reserves to sustain a 94% market crash. I'm like, 94%. I mean, we've had those before, you know?
00:35:00.048 - 00:35:03.774, Speaker A: Right. That's what you should expect.
00:35:03.972 - 00:35:09.950, Speaker B: That's the base case. That's not the worst case. That's exactly what you should expect, especially.
00:35:10.020 - 00:35:12.094, Speaker A: When you printed a bunch of funny money bro.
00:35:12.212 - 00:35:43.146, Speaker B: This was perhaps the most detached statement in the whole note that I read. He said this, I believe that had FTX International been given a few weeks, it could likely have utilized its illiquid assets and equity to raise enough financing to make customers substantially whole. Even now, he says, I believe that if FTX International were to reboot, there would be a real possibility of customers being made substantially whole. He still thinks this goes back to.
00:35:43.168 - 00:35:55.470, Speaker A: Our conversation last week, where one take is that SBF actually thinks he's innocent and a good guy trying to do the right thing. I think he actually does think that.
00:35:55.540 - 00:36:05.038, Speaker B: We'Ve just given an incredibly diluted person, like, billions and billions of dollars, and he continues to be. Wow. What? What a lesson for crypto.
00:36:05.054 - 00:36:06.020, Speaker A: I am sorry.
00:36:08.470 - 00:36:11.442, Speaker B: All right, what else we got, David? Our third news item this week.
00:36:11.496 - 00:36:34.554, Speaker A: Yeah, sad news out of Coinbase. They are cutting a fifth of its workforce. They also cut 18% of their staff last in June. So just overall, big contractions in Coinbase employees. But I think this is part of the course that's happened last bear market. This is just what it takes to be on the frontier of growth. That means that when the bull market comes, you lay people off.
00:36:34.554 - 00:36:59.534, Speaker A: It's not like a mistake. It's not like a misjudgment. As to crypto, it's just like, oh, the bear market is here. We have to cut costs as a result of all these layoffs. Coinbase says that this is bringing down their operating expenses down by 25% for the quarter ending in March. The company will also be shutting down several other projects with, quote, a lower probability of success. This article continues with general commentary about the tech sector.
00:36:59.534 - 00:37:44.506, Speaker A: And it says coinbase joins a chorus of other tech companies cutting jobs after going on a hiring binge during the COVID pandemic last week, Amazon said it would cut 18,000 jobs. Salesforce reduced its headcount by more than 7000 jobs, which is 10%. Elon Musk slashed half of Twitter's workforce after taking the helm of CEO Meta. Facebook cut 11,000 jobs, about 13%. And also crypto companies Genesis, Gemini, and Kraken also reduced their workforces. And the last line I'll read here is every company in Silicon Valley felt like we were just focused on growth, growth, growth, and people were almost using their headcount number as a symbol of how much progress they were making. Armstrong Brian Armstrong said, the focus is now on operational efficiency.
00:37:44.506 - 00:37:56.226, Speaker A: It's healthy for the ecosystem and for the industry to focus on more on those things. This, to me, is just what a bear market is. As prices go down, as things contract, you operate on efficiency rather than growth.
00:37:56.338 - 00:38:05.830, Speaker B: These are cycles. Things grew too fast and now they came down fast. And that's what's happening. Although although, David, although finance is bucking that trend.
00:38:07.850 - 00:38:09.418, Speaker A: Or posturing, at least at.
00:38:09.424 - 00:38:29.166, Speaker B: The very least true crypto exchange finance plans a 15% to 30% not cut hiring spree this year in 2023, even as rivals jobs. That's what CZ is saying, that they're focused on hiring and they're going to hire another 15% to 30%. What do you think about this?
00:38:29.268 - 00:38:41.300, Speaker A: Yeah. CZ. Says that finance needs to get the company well organized ahead of the next crypto bull rung, and admitted that the exchange was not super efficient yet. Who wants to hire more?
00:38:41.830 - 00:38:44.530, Speaker B: Might be some posturing, I don't know, show strength.
00:38:44.870 - 00:39:04.780, Speaker A: We've definitely seen CZ posture before. Remember when we had him on Bankless and we were like, oh, the question we had was like, CZ, SBF and FTX are buying everything under the sun. Like, what are you doing? And CZ. Was like, Binance has first. We're buying more on everything. On everything.
00:39:05.630 - 00:39:09.290, Speaker B: He's buying our leftovers, he's buying our sloppy seconds.
00:39:10.350 - 00:39:17.150, Speaker A: So there's definitely some posturing out of CZ. We've definitely seen this behavior before. So far, it has not been inaccurate.
00:39:17.490 - 00:39:31.346, Speaker B: And yet we don't know. We don't know one way or another, do we? But CZ has definitely been kind of hard to unseat as the number one exchange. Praying for Binance's Solvency. All right, what do we got coming up next?
00:39:31.448 - 00:40:01.174, Speaker A: Coming up next, optimism takes the number one spot of transaction volumes across layer twos and openc integrates arbitram Nova, which is arbitram's gaming chain, into the openc marketplace. So the L two wars are hot and everything is good for Ethereum. Of course, NFTs had a crazy week. Pleaser. Dow is working with Edward Snowden, rolling Stone magazine is working with Pussy Riot, and Game of Thrones launches an NFT. It's not great. Get your face palms ready because it's going to be funny.
00:40:01.174 - 00:40:40.594, Speaker A: So all of that and more as soon as we talk to some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. Uniswap is the largest on chain marketplace for self custody digital assets. Uniswap is, of course, a decentralized exchange, but you know this because you've been listening to Bankless. But did you know that the Uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat onramp? Now, you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in DFI inside of Uniswap. Not only that, but polygon Arbitrum and optimism layer twos are supported right out of the gate. But that's just DFI. Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, letting you find more listings for the best prices across the NFT world.
00:40:40.594 - 00:41:23.510, Speaker A: With Uniswap, you can sweep floors on multiple NFTs, and Uniswap's universal router will optimize your gas fees for you. Uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across Ethereum, and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor. So go to app Uniswap.org today to buy, sell or swap tokens and NFTs. Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web Three landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems. With a recent addition of arbitram Nova, gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home.
00:41:23.510 - 00:41:57.138, Speaker A: Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees. With arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro, it's also now ten times faster than before. Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum experience web3 development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap and friction free.
00:41:57.224 - 00:42:17.842, Speaker B: All right, guys, we're back. The flipping. No one was talking about optimism overtakes Arbitrum for daily active addresses and transactions per day. So this is Arbitrum still leading on total locked value. So it's kind of like an assets on the chain sort of measure, but optimism leading on transactions. What do you make of this, David?
00:42:17.906 - 00:42:48.334, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, this is just momentary to optimism taking the lead. We'll see if they can sustain think. I don't know how to read into this too much. There's a lot of more analysis that really needs to go into why optimism is getting more transaction volume. But I think it does lend itself a little bit to the philosophical differences between these chains. Arbitrum is very, very DeFi, heavy optimism. And the optimism team are always really focused on literally, how do we build a new world, like a new governance structure, new organizational systems, new economies.
00:42:48.334 - 00:43:03.366, Speaker A: And so the fact that the economy of optimism as a governance system, a two house model, and all the real DeFi and NFT stuff's going on, that kind of tracks versus Arbitrum, which is more like DeFi and NFT and kind.
00:43:03.388 - 00:43:07.640, Speaker B: Of I guess Arbitrum is just getting more finance use cases, maybe.
00:43:08.090 - 00:43:30.014, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll have to get Ben on it. I think we should get Ben on why on this. What's new in the optimism ecosystem? But those charts, the trend here, if you're looking at the screen, the optimism transaction volume chart is just like solid, rock solid. Up and to the right. Arbitrum had a big wave and it's slowly come down since a peak. I bet you these things just leapfrog over and over and over again.
00:43:30.212 - 00:43:38.062, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really interesting to see these economies emerge. OpenSea is now supporting Arbitrum Nova. What does that mean, David?
00:43:38.126 - 00:43:56.146, Speaker A: Arbitrum nova is Arbitrum's second chain. So the first Arbitrum chain is called Arbitrum One because it's the first chain. Arbitrum Nova is the second chain. It's a chain dedicated to social and gaming. And so it's like a roll up, but with off chain data. So there's other data dependencies. Your data is not stored on Ethereum.
00:43:56.146 - 00:44:17.150, Speaker A: It's stored with what's called a Data Availability Committee, which is a committee of data providers that are not Ethereum. So there's different dependencies there. But what do you get from that? Super fast and super cheap. And so this is Arbitrum's gaming chain. And now Arbitrum has two chains that are integrated inside of Openc. So just big progress. Big progress.
00:44:17.650 - 00:44:25.010, Speaker B: Yeah, that is big. What do we got here, David? You're calling this the L two bull market. Why?
00:44:25.160 - 00:44:58.122, Speaker A: This is just a list of very green numbers of transaction volume across Ethereum and all the layer two chains. So in the last seven days, 58% increase in transactions on optimism, 42% increase transactions on Arbitrum one, immutable, 47% increase. dYdX, 113% increase in transactional volume. Now, if you look at the numbers, the actual numbers are Ethereum, 13.7 transactions per second. Optimism, seven transactions per second. Arbitrum, two and a half.
00:44:58.122 - 00:45:22.306, Speaker A: Immutable two and a half. dYdX two and a half. So, like, still actually low numbers, but these aren't capacities. These are what is actually being used. And so the volumes are up, but still have a lot more to go. I expect things like optimism, Arbitrum Immutable to definitely pass because they have the capacity to definitely pass Ethereum in transaction volumes. I expect that to happen.
00:45:22.408 - 00:45:40.354, Speaker B: This bear market, this was interesting, too. It looks like Coinbase is maybe becoming a rocket pool Odao member. Why would they do that? So coinbase has its own ethereum staking service, of course, internal, but they are also going to be working with rocket pool.
00:45:40.402 - 00:46:09.278, Speaker A: Yeah. So Bankless is an Odao member for rocket pool. Sazzle Anthony Suzano is also a new Odao member to rocket pool. What is the odao? It's called the oracle. Dow rocket pool just needs the Oracle price for ether. They just need as a part of the system, they need to understand what the price is for ether and so they get that through the Odao. So people that are trusted and also put up a bond to report the Oracle price of ether two rocket pool.
00:46:09.278 - 00:46:15.394, Speaker A: Coinbase is now being proposed as an Odao member. And so this is that doesn't mean.
00:46:15.432 - 00:46:18.686, Speaker B: They'Re going to stake any customer funds.
00:46:18.718 - 00:46:20.306, Speaker A: No, it does not. That is not what that means.
00:46:20.328 - 00:46:22.134, Speaker B: It does mean they're getting involved in the project.
00:46:22.252 - 00:46:45.386, Speaker A: Exactly. And I think that's really the important point to take home. It's like the Odao membership for Coinbase is them getting their foot in the door because now Coinbase has like governance, if you will, as in like they are part of the system. I think it's the first way that Coinbase becomes comfortable with staking through rocket pool. And if you've been in the rocket pool trading channel inside of their discord, it's like one of the most high energy channels that exists.
00:46:45.418 - 00:46:50.474, Speaker B: Yeah, they probably think this is incredibly bullish and that this has always been sticking is imminent.
00:46:50.522 - 00:47:22.810, Speaker A: This has always been one of thesis of the bullcase for rocket pool. It's part of the DeFi Mullet thesis or the protocol sync thesis which is something that we've been hammering into people's heads for as long as we can. Centralized companies can use decentralized protocols for their services and if Coinbase just stakes through rocket pool, they actually can make more money than if they just run their own nodes themselves. It's profitable for them to stake through rocket pool. And so I think this might be an early indication of that thesis playing out.
00:47:22.880 - 00:47:44.278, Speaker B: That could be cool. I mean, that would be amazing. We also see how much better would it have been if BlockFi, for example, and Celsius and all of the other centralized lending companies used something like Ave or Compound exactly. Rather than kind of the centralized providers for it. That is DeFi Mullet as well. All right, let's talk NFT stuff. David.
00:47:44.278 - 00:47:51.858, Speaker B: So the NFT community seems full of life. This is a new announcement by Pleaser Dow. Can you explain what this is?
00:47:51.944 - 00:48:09.942, Speaker A: Yeah. And also disclaimer I'm a part of Pleaser Dow. Pleaser Dow is working on a Web Three auction house. And so an auction house for the Metaverse is at Pleaser house that's Pleaser without an E in collaboration with Edward Snowden and Daniel Ellsberg. Do you know who Daniel Ellsberg is, Ryan?
00:48:10.006 - 00:48:11.110, Speaker B: I don't. Who's Daniel?
00:48:11.190 - 00:49:15.006, Speaker A: He is the whistleblower that released the Pentagon Papers that started to actually turn the tide of the vietnam War for releasing a lot of the back channel comms in the Pentagon that was like, hey, the Vietnam War is like totally illegitimate. That's Daniel Ellsberg right there. And so Pleaserdao bought the Edward and Snowden piece, the NFT that Edward Snowden made that was about his whistleblower for the NSA. They bought that for four point something million dollars. We bought it and that's an NFT that is inside of the Pleaser vaults. And now that the Pleaser Dow has created this auction house, daniel Ellsberg is making an NFT kind of house edward Snowden did and is going to be auctioned out off today in a few hours. So yesterday for listeners, hopefully it goes for a lot of money because all of the money is being donated, 50% is being donated to the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which was also where all of the money for the purchase of the Edward Snowden NFT also went.
00:49:15.006 - 00:49:25.940, Speaker A: The four plus million dollars. And then the other 50% of this Daniel Ellsberg auction is going to the Daniel Ellsberg's Personal Foundation for also donations. So I think that's really cool.
00:49:26.710 - 00:49:50.842, Speaker B: Very cool. Yeah. And I think you did a show about I haven't caught up with that show, but it's on Bankless with Jamis Jamis talking about that NFT artists. Did you know they are launching on Instagram these days? Yeah. This is a headline from CoinDesk. So top NFT artists are launching projects on Instagram and they're selling out in seconds. This, to me David, is somewhat detached from Crypto native world.
00:49:50.842 - 00:50:09.694, Speaker B: So I don't necessarily see what's going on in these communities. But if you'll recall, Meta and Instagram added NFT functionality at first, the ability to kind of view NFTs, now apparently the ability to mint and sell NFTs and they're selling like crazy. I don't know what we're looking at. This specific one.
00:50:09.732 - 00:50:13.220, Speaker A: Yeah, that looks like a weird NFT to showcase, but okay.
00:50:15.430 - 00:50:32.034, Speaker B: Here'S another one from Sandeep. So a lot of these are based on polygon, of course. This is one called Accutars, I believe. Anyway, what's interesting about this is there seems to be still appetite for NFTs. It's in a new platform on Instagram.
00:50:32.082 - 00:50:34.402, Speaker A: Excuse me, Brian. They're digital collectibles.
00:50:34.466 - 00:50:43.154, Speaker B: Yes, sorry, digital collectibles. And what's interesting to me too is Meta is taking like 15% to 30% of the sales.
00:50:43.212 - 00:50:43.914, Speaker A: All right.
00:50:44.032 - 00:50:52.640, Speaker B: And creators are still doing it. So bullish, question mark, bullish digital collectibles. At least not NFTs. Of course those are bad.
00:50:53.410 - 00:51:07.042, Speaker A: I think it's going to be stuff like this and the combination of Instagram and the branding, digital collectibles, people are just going to get it like, oh, this is a digital collectible on the Internet. That's a cool technology.
00:51:07.176 - 00:51:10.898, Speaker B: When my tribe does it, it's cool. When your tribe does it, I hate it.
00:51:10.984 - 00:51:17.486, Speaker A: Well, sure, yeah. Your NFTs are dumb. Your NFTs on OpenSea are dumb. My digital collectibles on Instagram are great.
00:51:17.608 - 00:51:24.246, Speaker B: Amazing. Why? Because it's from my favorite creator in this amazing fan community and yeah, it's totally tribal, isn't it?
00:51:24.268 - 00:51:49.902, Speaker A: I think this is just like the technology of Ethereum slowly working its way into corners of the internet that already exist. This is again, the Protocol sync thesis playing out. And this is also going to unlock new creators and new communities to have digital collectible powers. And we're not going to hear about it on Crypto Reddit or Crypto Twitter. It's going to be new communities and that's going to be part of the vision of how this whole revolution happens.
00:51:50.036 - 00:52:01.694, Speaker B: Yep. Don't even know they're using. Crypto has always been the vision. Lens Protocol is letting creators issue Token gated content. So what do you make of this, David?
00:52:01.822 - 00:52:31.498, Speaker A: Yeah, this is just following into the footsteps of other platforms that we see in the space, like Mirror. Any sort of content can be turned into a token and be created. But also there are creating tools for Token gating. So posting inside of Lenses Token Gating application, all that content becomes encrypted and only made accessible to users who meet certain conditions. Having a certain amount of reputation, holding a certain token, being a certain, I don't know, thing or person.
00:52:31.664 - 00:52:32.874, Speaker B: It's really smart, right?
00:52:32.912 - 00:52:33.818, Speaker A: It's so simple.
00:52:33.984 - 00:53:12.170, Speaker B: It's like the idea Twitter rolled this thing out, I don't know if I've even seen it news. But the idea that you can subscribe to different Twitter accounts, basically it's kind of a premium service and just receive their premium only tweets. Substack has a similar model in that they'll send out free posts and then premium posts. Well, Lens is just doing like token gated posts, right? Because none of these previous Web Two platforms are doing token gating yet. They're just doing simple subscription payments. I think that creates a whole new incentive model. It's really smart of Lens to do it's like a Web three native feature that only they can do.
00:53:12.240 - 00:53:26.478, Speaker A: I really wish I could tweet out and have a tweet only be read by people with a certain NFT, for example. So if I wanted to tweet out to all my MFRS to be like, no, don't show this tweet to anyone who doesn't own an MFR, right? Yeah, that'd be cool. That'd be really cool.
00:53:26.484 - 00:53:29.242, Speaker B: Or like just the bankless community. There was a bankless NFT.
00:53:29.306 - 00:53:30.160, Speaker A: Oh my God.
00:53:31.090 - 00:53:36.086, Speaker B: There are bankless badge. Badge tokens, of course, which are like our POAP badges.
00:53:36.218 - 00:53:38.034, Speaker A: We did NFTs before. It was cool.
00:53:38.152 - 00:53:40.162, Speaker B: Yeah, digital collectibles, actually.
00:53:40.216 - 00:53:41.730, Speaker A: Well, no, ours are NFTs.
00:53:42.070 - 00:53:47.570, Speaker B: Okay, ours NFTs. What's going on with Rolling Stone Pussy Riot? What's happening?
00:53:47.640 - 00:54:24.178, Speaker A: Yeah, so Rolling Stone magazine is working in collaboration with Nadia, aka Pussy Riot, aka the Dissenter, who made a bunch of fun of Putin and then got kicked out of the country. And so, just in the same vein as Edward Snowden and Daniel Ellis, pussy Riot is selling NFTs on the coinbase NFT platform in collaboration with Rolling Stone. So we got some two ETH bids for a collection of, I think, eleven or twelve of Pussy Riot's pictures. If you don't know who Pussy Riot is and you're looking at these pictures for the first time, and you're like, what the fuck? That's a normal reaction. That's kind of the point. That's kind of her brand. I've hung out with Nadia a few times.
00:54:24.178 - 00:54:31.620, Speaker A: She's deep in the crypto world. She's also a member of Pleaserdao, actually. She is a hoot to hang out with, let me tell you.
00:54:33.510 - 00:54:37.346, Speaker B: She's DM me before. I've never connected with her. But she listens to Bankless, doesn't she?
00:54:37.368 - 00:54:39.380, Speaker A: I think so, yeah. Okay.
00:54:39.750 - 00:54:40.194, Speaker B: All right.
00:54:40.232 - 00:54:46.630, Speaker A: We got she has a necklace that she wears all the time, and it's just a dude big penis. It's a penis necklace.
00:54:47.370 - 00:54:48.242, Speaker B: Fantastic.
00:54:48.306 - 00:54:52.006, Speaker A: Yeah. If you didn't know that blue chip.
00:54:52.038 - 00:54:56.666, Speaker B: NFT Project Moonbird signs with Hollywood talent agencies. What is this about?
00:54:56.768 - 00:55:23.598, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know much of this world. Was it united Talent agencies. Yeah, United Talent Agency is, I think, like a massive deal in Hollywood. It's kind of like the Guild of Actors maybe is like a little bit of a monopoly. I don't know. But Kevin Rose and the Moonbirds have signed a deal with United Talent Agency to just promote the Moonbirds brand. And so what does UTA bring to the table? This is from the article.
00:55:23.598 - 00:55:30.654, Speaker A: They are 1400 people with divisions in film, television, music, video game, sports, books, branding, licensing, speaking, marketing, fine arts.
00:55:30.702 - 00:55:37.190, Speaker B: Like a network of influencers. Like old isn't that what it is? I'm asking a question, actually. I don't know.
00:55:37.340 - 00:56:01.790, Speaker A: They said their job is to vet, broker, and execute partnerships and expansion opportunities across a variety of fields to help promote the Moonbirds brand on a global scale and trying to get out of just being recognized as a big brand. Inside of Web Three. This has, I learned, also already been done by both Larvae Labs and Yuga Labs. So this is not a first in the NFT industry.
00:56:02.290 - 00:56:09.570, Speaker B: Got to do it ethically. With full disclosures, though, as Yuga Labs learned, I think, recently, this is Vance Spencer's take on it. What does he say?
00:56:09.640 - 00:56:52.090, Speaker A: This is a Vance Spencer take from back in the day when Larvae Labs did this deal in the first place. This was August of 2021. So over a year ago, this was raised by Luke on the Bankless side of things, who used to work in Hollywood before we totally poached the hell out of him. And so Vance Spencer says the Larvae Labs UTA deal is great, but the bigger vision is to create IP with open licensing APIs, where anyone can use the IP for anything. Example, UTA goes out of business and Larva Lab stops calling the shots. But then Vance finishes and says, the blockchain unlock will be moving IP licensing from scarcity to abundance mindset. And so I think this is really the early conversations of the decentralized bottom up brands.
00:56:52.090 - 00:57:17.714, Speaker A: And these are. Kind of the NFTs that I really like. Like MFers, for example, is a decentralized headless movement of branding. Whereas Moonbirds in Yuga Labs and Larvae Labs, anyone who signed a deal with UTA is like, hey, UTA, make our brand better. Like ascribing agency to an agency to make the brand better versus MFers. Just go wild. Make infinity derivatives, just be MFers.
00:57:17.762 - 00:57:23.910, Speaker B: Like there's two different anarchy versus top. Right. And like, I don't even know what's more effective.
00:57:23.990 - 00:57:29.210, Speaker A: I think that case by case, facts and circumstances. Yeah, each one's probably got its own facts and circumstances.
00:57:29.550 - 00:57:50.010, Speaker B: I know that this is not an effective NFT. Well, I mean, at least for me. Game of Thrones NFT the Build your Realm experience brought to you by Warner Brothers. So we now have Game of Thrones NFTs. As if the show didn't already jump the shark, now they're getting on the NFT bandwagon.
00:57:50.090 - 00:57:53.950, Speaker A: Wow. Have good things to say about Game of Thrones.
00:57:54.290 - 00:57:59.158, Speaker B: I mean, what do you think of these NFTs, David? Do you have good things to say about them? Any takes here?
00:57:59.244 - 00:58:18.700, Speaker A: So I think what we're looking at here, if you go back to the marketplace, these are like packs, like card packs. Like if you open them up, there's like five of them if you hit filter in the top. Yeah. So here are the animations of the people of Game of Thrones. And man, does it look like a cheap mobile game. Wow.
00:58:20.030 - 00:58:21.670, Speaker B: Did you see this tweet here, David?
00:58:21.750 - 00:58:47.018, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is funky. Donk saying I bought this for 0.7. E. Why might you ask? Do you hate yourself funky? No, it's because I know art when I see it. And these fingers, that's art. And so we are looking at an animation of this guy who's like definitely some junior animator who's got some crazy spindly, like 2ft long fingers that's attempting to grab this spear and it's just like missing.
00:58:47.018 - 00:58:52.850, Speaker A: And the animation's all bad and it kind of feels like a Kevin moment. You remember Kevin?
00:58:52.930 - 00:58:56.466, Speaker B: I remember Kevin. Yeah, but how are they selling, David?
00:58:56.658 - 00:58:59.720, Speaker A: They sold out, dude. Of course they did.
00:59:00.410 - 00:59:03.190, Speaker B: How do they still sell out? They're even calling them NFTs.
00:59:03.270 - 00:59:04.042, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:59:04.176 - 00:59:05.194, Speaker B: Who's buying these things?
00:59:05.232 - 00:59:12.778, Speaker A: I don't know. So there's a game that goes with these things, apparently. So there's like utility. Maybe they can fix the animations.
00:59:12.874 - 00:59:46.262, Speaker B: All right, well, maybe David and I are missing out on these fantastic NFTs. Art is completely subjective. All right, what is backing a USDC? This is a tweet from John Paul Coning, who really follows Stablecoins quite well. It turns out that 30% of USDC is actually BlackRock government money. So BlackRock bonds, I believe. And this is up from 0% in October. So it happened really quick.
00:59:46.262 - 01:00:09.070, Speaker B: From 0% to 30%, that's about $13 billion of USDC reserves. That's the funds, the collateral that backs the coin. USDC, when you use it on ethereum or any network, is actually managed by BlackRock. What do you think, David? Is this a good thing or a bad thing? BlackRock bad. BlackRock is a bank, and so we shouldn't want them in crypto. What's happening here?
01:00:09.140 - 01:00:48.842, Speaker A: Yeah. So John continued this thread and gave a take that I think I agree with. He goes, since the proportion of USCC reserves invested in the Circle Reserve Fund has risen to about $28 billion, he says that this is likely a win for USDC users because Circle is yielding some control over USDC's reserves to an external manager subject to SEC regulation, which ultimately makes USDC safer. Transparency improves since users can now get regular updates from BlackRock. And BlackRock is like a TradFi approved institution, regulatory approved, mega institution. Right. And so it's basically an extension of the state.
01:00:48.842 - 01:01:14.642, Speaker A: And so using BlackRock as, like, a vehicle to put USDC inside of is what he's saying is like, this is just a good use of transparency tools and protections for users. And ultimately, USDC is already an extension of the state anyways. It's dollars in a bank, so it doesn't make it any more centralized. So I think this is just layers of protection around companies that are very much the opposite of FTX, if you will.
01:01:14.696 - 01:01:48.590, Speaker B: Well, I think it's definitely regulatory protection, too, because now someone like the SEC looks at Tether and they're, no, uh uh. And then they look at USDC and they're, Ah, okay, BlackRock, our friends, the incumbents. We know these guys, and they're okay with USDC. I think that's what's probably going um this was kind of disturbing and disappointing to me. David, this is Ben Hunt talking about BlockFi and specifically some of the leadership of BlockFi having cashed out during the last year or so. Do you want to read this out?
01:01:48.740 - 01:02:23.606, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is after we got a report, a transparency report from BlockFi and equity holders in the cap table. So apparently Ben went down this rabbit hole to just look at the data, and he goes tweets out on Twitter. CEO Zach Prince cashed out 9.3 million from his Blockfly account, about 70% of his account in early April 2022. This was right before the Luna 3 hours capital contagion. And then he cashed out another $850,000 in mid August 2022, after Blockfly got bailed out by FTX, I think it was actually Alameda.
01:02:23.606 - 01:02:41.470, Speaker A: And he says he follows, yes, I'm accounting for market declines in the assets. And so cashing out $9.3 million before all the contagion happened. I think you can kind of give him the pass on that. Cashing out almost another million dollars after getting bailed out by FTX.
01:02:42.450 - 01:02:43.600, Speaker B: Doesn't feel great.
01:02:44.070 - 01:02:54.418, Speaker A: Not so great. Yeah, it's like the cost between like, that is his money. That's his money. He's able to withdraw. He's able to press the withdrawal button.
01:02:54.504 - 01:02:56.114, Speaker B: Drawing from his own product, though.
01:02:56.152 - 01:02:58.790, Speaker A: His own withdrawal. Yeah, it's like lack of confidence.
01:02:59.530 - 01:03:08.482, Speaker B: Right. And the second piece, especially in mid August. Right. And even the first piece in April. I mean, BlockFi, I guess I think that was Cajun.
01:03:08.546 - 01:03:25.518, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, an informed person might be able to understand the writing on the walls. He would be able to see how solvent BlockFi was or not. I think it's hard to not give him a pass on that one, but it still doesn't feel great. It doesn't feel great when a whole.
01:03:25.524 - 01:03:28.654, Speaker B: Bunch of people lost money in BlockFi, specifically. Yeah.
01:03:28.772 - 01:03:30.010, Speaker A: And the leader didn't.
01:03:30.170 - 01:03:42.690, Speaker B: Okay, well, speaking of CFI, nexo office was raided by Bulgarian police in a wide investigation. What is going on with Nexo? David? This was breaking as of, I think, this morning.
01:03:42.840 - 01:04:25.694, Speaker A: Yeah, this was kind of crazy. This is out of Bloomberg crypto. Lender's office in Sophia was raided by Bulgarian police on Thursday as a result of investigation into suspected money laundering and tax crimes. More than 300 police officers, prosecutors, and national security agents are taking a part in this operation, which was stated from a Bulgarian chief prosecutor who told reporters in Sofia, nexo used to operate inside the United States. But, like, a few months ago, they closed down their operations because probably, I'm guessing what happened was the SEC was like, hey, that's a security. And they just didn't want to fight it. So they just went offshore, started to be like some smoke out of Nexo.
01:04:25.694 - 01:04:39.240, Speaker A: The article continues saying authorities are investigating London based Nexo on suspicion of money laundering, tax crimes, and offenses involving unlicensed banking activities. Kind of all the same thing that I think the SEC was worried about.
01:04:40.330 - 01:05:17.886, Speaker B: Nexo put together a Tweet thread, which was kind of like a defense of know, I skimmed through this. And the trouble with this, David, is you just really don't know who to believe. Looks like this Tweet thread was centered on AML KYC. And maybe they're kind of implying that's the reason that they're under investigation, I suppose you'd call this. But they said that they've always been abiding by the laws. Now, David, at this point in time, we're hearing things. Whenever something like this breaks, you're hearing kind of bank run types of murmurs.
01:05:17.886 - 01:05:24.450, Speaker B: Right. But we haven't actually seen anything to indicate that people are unable to withdraw their funds.
01:05:24.870 - 01:05:33.682, Speaker A: The knee jerk reaction is Nexo is insolvent. They don't have any money. But that's not what's being reported. What's being reported is tax fraud and banking violations.
01:05:33.826 - 01:05:34.182, Speaker B: Right.
01:05:34.236 - 01:05:46.618, Speaker A: I mean, where there's smoke, there might be fire. And I would suggest if you have money in Nexo to probably withdraw it. But I haven't seen anyone say, hey, I have money in Nexo and I can't get it out. I haven't seen any report like that yet.
01:05:46.704 - 01:06:20.822, Speaker B: I have seen some things on Twitter of critics saying, hey, Bankless, why did you ever do anything with Nexo in the past before? I think we should probably talk about that and address that. And Bankless listeners, longtime Bankless listeners might remember a stint that we did with Nexo as a sponsor of Bankless, they actually booked a podcast sponsorship slot for the entirety of last quarter of Q Four. We cut them short after about six weeks of this when there started to be some fishy stuff going on in the general CFI space.
01:06:20.956 - 01:06:24.194, Speaker A: Nothing by Nexo, nothing by fishy by Nexo.
01:06:24.322 - 01:06:45.854, Speaker B: We met with them, we told them, hey, we don't feel comfortable, given everything that's going on with FTX in continuing this partnership, and we cut them off there and then. I will say retrospectively, and we've kind of talked about this in general, partnering with Nexo at that time in Q Four was definitely a mistake. Right?
01:06:45.892 - 01:06:46.480, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:06:47.170 - 01:07:33.702, Speaker B: I think that our feeling going into it was not all centralized lending companies are bad. There are some good ones, aren't there? There have to be. Nexo had just come through the gauntlet of Three Zero's Capital getting destroyed, and BlockFi getting destroyed, and Celsius getting destroyed, and they were actually talking about acquiring other companies. Right. It felt like a reasonably safe like if you go in with eyes wide open and you understand that giving up your private keys means giving up your coins, but you're willing to do that, you do your own due diligence. It seemed like they might be able to make it, and look, they still might. But I've got to say, this doesn't make me feel good that they have been associated with the Bankless brand.
01:07:33.702 - 01:07:39.166, Speaker B: Like you don't like to see one of the sponsors of your podcast being.
01:07:39.188 - 01:07:42.862, Speaker A: Raided by the police for tax and money laundering. Yeah, not great.
01:07:42.916 - 01:08:25.014, Speaker B: Exactly. So even though the scope of their ad was short and very limited, I got to say, I think you and I have talked about this and we regret it. We wouldn't do it again. I mean, I think there were some lessons learned in sort of all CFI lenders coming out of 2022, and it's something that very few of them are on solid ground, if any of them are on solid ground. I will say, if you kind of zoom out and look at the discernment we've had on sponsors, just in general, I felt pretty good about our discernment with picking sponsors up until this point. This is an industry that's incredibly hard to navigate. Right.
01:08:25.014 - 01:08:54.214, Speaker B: You know, how we end every podcast with crypto is risky. You could lose everything, even picking sponsors. We don't know which ones might have smart contract bugs or shady founders. And we try to do our best. In this case, I think this was probably a big fat fail and I definitely regret it. And so, apologies to anyone we may have let down with this one. You could tell, like, David and I are not perfect.
01:08:54.214 - 01:09:10.406, Speaker B: We do try our best, we hope. And we think that the good outweighs the bad generally on Bankless. I would take this one back if we could, and I hope you guys know we're not going to get everything right on Bankless, but we're going to continue to do our best. I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that, David.
01:09:10.518 - 01:09:50.530, Speaker A: Yeah, just trying to put myself back into the shoes that we were going into. Q Four. 2022 was when we signed on Nexo. Of course, the taste of centralized borrowing and lending desks was not good at that time. And so it was a conversation that we had, is this the right sponsor? And using the calculus of like, well, Nexo wanted to buy everything that Celsius would give them before they got outbid by FTX. And so to me that was like, oh, we just went through the acid test of who was over leveraged and who was responsible and Nexo kind of seemed like the responsible one. So now that we have more information, turns out that that was incorrect.
01:09:50.610 - 01:09:54.746, Speaker B: What was so crazy about it is Dave is like, all of them failed. Yeah.
01:09:54.928 - 01:10:02.074, Speaker A: That's the unreal thing is like not one borrowing and lending desk made it through 2022, they all blew up.
01:10:02.112 - 01:10:34.038, Speaker B: And I was hopeful that there would still be some kind of good guys there that were able to make it and there just haven't been. Anyway, we are leveling up. We're learning from this experience. I think as an industry, we're learning from this. Do not expect us to support any centralized lending companies in 2023 probably ever again unless we get some sort of proof of reserve system down. And we are being much more discerning. We're not going as fast when it comes to sponsor selection and we're adding some new due diligence to the process.
01:10:34.204 - 01:11:40.406, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think the last thing I'll say on this is this whole 2022, aside from centralized companies blowing up, was a massive lesson, I think, for all of the industry, and definitely me as well, is the combination of just like well, interest rates are a very big deal, as it turns out. But also the idea of how toxic yield is when it's paired with a borrower on the other side. But that's like, there's a bunch of borrowing. Money markets are a thing in TradFi and they totally work in TradFi too, but it's the combination of money markets, Gemini Earn, Genesis, like, all that stuff. And then what is downstream of that, which I did not appreciate until after all of this contagion happened, was like thousand APY pool twos and funny money printed out of thin air and basically the entire bull market, which was just like high yield and funny money. And then when all of those pool twos dried up and went to zero, that just slowly worked through the system and it didn't really matter how responsible you were as a money market, there was too much hot air in the entire industry and so every single centralized lender went insolvent.
01:11:40.406 - 01:11:46.462, Speaker A: And that's just like a lesson in economics that me. And I think the entire industry learned this year.
01:11:46.596 - 01:12:07.410, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Well, speaking of which, I guess as long as we're talking about investigations, who is this guy? I remember him from some time last year, but the stablecoin exchange, saber is under investigation by the doga as well. Who's this guy? Ian, I believe his name is, and Dylan. Are they twin? Are they brothers?
01:12:07.570 - 01:12:22.218, Speaker A: Yes, I think they're brothers. Yeah. We reported on this a while ago. You remember the story of the one or two Salana developers that spun up and puppeted like, twelve puppet account, like DFI apps on Salana and it triggered a bunch of TVL and it was.
01:12:22.224 - 01:12:26.314, Speaker B: Like responsible, got lost in all the scams last year. I'm sorry, I just forgot this.
01:12:26.432 - 01:12:51.810, Speaker A: Right. This was the one developer who was actually like eleven different pseudonymous developers that created all these financial interlocking protocols that double and triple counted crypto deposits and it inflated the Salana TVL by like 40%. That guy, those two brothers are the that's what we're talking about. Those two brothers are under investigation. Good surprise.
01:12:52.150 - 01:13:25.102, Speaker B: That's great. One note on raises, of course, is that startup funding levels are now their lowest in almost two years. So VCs is about a 75% drop from last year in terms of funding activity. Look, I think that's a very healthy thing because the private valuations in crypto that were out there and that we were seeing were absolutely crazy and so they needed some cooling down. And I think this is bullish and also not surprising. You have anything more to say on that?
01:13:25.156 - 01:13:49.342, Speaker A: The numbers here is that VC firms invested 2.3 billion in crypto startups during this last quarter, which is a good number, not a bad number, but that is a 75% drop from the same period previous year. So one interpretation is like, oh, VC funding is totally dried up. I think that's actually the wrong angle. You should say healthy. VC funding was insane a year ago and now it's just healthy.
01:13:49.486 - 01:14:09.206, Speaker B: Yeah, it was bad now and now it's much better. Speaking of which, there's still investment going on in crypto and there are still jobs to be had in crypto. In particular, bankless is hiring. We are looking for a director of Business Development. Got some sales experience. Come on, talk to uswap. Labs senior software engineer.
01:14:09.206 - 01:14:19.722, Speaker B: Webassie is software engineer over DApps. Webac. Also a QA analyst. You can find these jobs. You go to Bankless palette.com slash jobs. All right, what do we got coming up next, David?
01:14:19.786 - 01:14:31.742, Speaker A: We're going to get into questions from the Bankless Nation, and this is coming out of the Bankless Nation Discord, which ryan, did you know that we completely revamped the structure of the Bankless Nation discord?
01:14:31.886 - 01:14:43.574, Speaker B: I did know that. It's looking pretty good. The conversation's hot. What's going on? What's the talk for the discord this week? And by the way, how do people get into that discord? Because you can't just click a link right?
01:14:43.692 - 01:15:08.142, Speaker A: Yeah. So there will be one soon. But there is a link in the show notes if you want to go into the discord channel to ask Ryan and I questions. Because every single Wednesday before we record this episode on Thursday, we go into the Weekly Rollups Questions channel. We at everyone and say, hey, what questions do you want us to read out on the Weekly Roll up? And so there's that channel. There's also a bunch of other channels. Like I said, we completely reorg them.
01:15:08.142 - 01:15:14.670, Speaker A: So there's a lot of vitality being injected into the discord. And so, Ryan, are you ready to get into questions?
01:15:14.820 - 01:15:24.110, Speaker B: Okay, so the first question is from Walshy says, the first crypto conference I ever went to was Permissionless. I guess that was last year. Sorry to ask you somewhat shill your own conference.
01:15:24.270 - 01:15:26.306, Speaker A: I'm so glad you asked, but I.
01:15:26.328 - 01:15:52.294, Speaker B: Had an absolute blast and it was my first real Web Three social experience. Everyone I met was so warm, and the vibe is best described as welcoming and galvanizing. I learned so much by following your advice and taking as many people as possible to all of the talks and booths and meetings and everything else. What could we expect from Permissionless V two in Austin later this year? So it's in Austin. When is permissionless v two? And what can people expect? David?
01:15:52.342 - 01:16:22.662, Speaker A: Yeah, Permissionless 2023 coming in hot in September 11 through 13th of 2023. That's this year. So you got eight more months to come. It's going to be a lot bigger. The biggest take I heard was when I told people that Permissionless was a first year conference last year, it was like, what? Which is I'm super proud of that fact. And I know the blockworks team feels similarly. So the second round of Permissionless, Permissionless 2023 is just going to be that much bigger and better because it'll be our second time doing this.
01:16:22.662 - 01:16:36.746, Speaker A: So we got Eric Voorhees locked in as a keynote speaker. We got Mary Katherine Lauder from Uniswap. We got Justin Drake, of course, coming back. Hazu is coming in. Donnie's coming in. Zackie Manion is coming in. And we're eight months out.
01:16:36.746 - 01:17:07.282, Speaker A: So we haven't locked in even all the big super chad speakers that we really want to, which is to say nothing about how Chad Eric Voorhees is. And so I'm super stoked for everything that we're going to do. There's also this year going to be a hackathon as well. And so that is the shiny, sparkly new thing. Out of Permissionless, there's going to be a hackathon leading up to this, which I'm pretty stoked for. And there's one thing that I think people should appreciate about hackathons. They're considered dev oriented, right? These are developers to go compete for prizes.
01:17:07.282 - 01:17:52.574, Speaker A: But a hackathon with a non dev person who can communicate extremely well, who can make a pitch deck, who can present a non technical person, I mean, is super appreciative and devs. Kind of often devs need somebody to do that lift for them. So if you are a non technical person but you want to get involved in very big projects, come out of hackathons, earnify what is now called Bankless Labs, came out of a hackathon. So there's a lot of opportunity there. And in addition to the actual conference, which is going to be some great talks, I'm sure Ryan and I are going to moderate a ton of them. There's the hackathon and then there's also the side events. There will, of course be the Bankless meetup we are organizing for the Inner Circle, for the Bankless Nation Discord.
01:17:52.574 - 01:18:17.286, Speaker A: If you are in there, if you're a premium member, we're going to organize a meetup at East Denver. We'll be doing the same thing at Permissionless in Texas. And also tickets are going on sale every single week. A new batch of tickets is going out, actually just went out. Prices go up every two weeks. So the longer that you procrastinate and don't get your ticket, the more that you pay more money. So if you know that you want to go to Permissionless in September, definitely get your ticket.
01:18:17.286 - 01:18:18.746, Speaker A: Now there's a link in the show.
01:18:18.768 - 01:18:32.110, Speaker B: Notes to get that done. The way that it makes the most sense to get that ticket is to upgrade bankless premium, by the way. And when you do that, you get into the discord we were just talking about and you also get 30% off that ticket. So it kind of pays for itself.
01:18:32.180 - 01:18:38.210, Speaker A: Bankless premium pays for itself because 30% off of Permissionless is more than a year's of bankless premium.
01:18:38.550 - 01:19:04.214, Speaker B: The next question is, with people and crypto companies having PTSD from all the cascades of liquidations, will people be less inclined to take such leverage risk next time? I hope the answer is yes, but at the same time, I wonder if that will make the next bull run less explosive. What chance do you think there will be a next bull run that does not bring new all time highs? Are we going to get a muted bull run? Are we ever going to see all time high again? What do you think about that, David?
01:19:04.262 - 01:19:47.442, Speaker A: And this question is from Yeti 77. Thank you for the question. I think people will totally ape right back into leverage as soon as the bull market comes back. Part of the fact that we are not in a bull market, part of the fact that prices are more stable, they're less volatile, they're also lower, is a symptom of people taking less leverage. When people take leverage, they mint money out of thin air and then they use that money to buy crypto assets, and that makes the crypto assets go up in price. And so the fact that people aren't doing that is why we have settled down to these new lower prices of one $400 Ether and $18,000 Bitcoin. We're kind of monkey brains.
01:19:47.442 - 01:20:23.214, Speaker A: People that participate in markets are using their reptile brains. And so as soon as people get bullish, people are not going to be able to think rationally. They're going to ape right back into leverage. Some of them will be able to make money, many of them will not. But what does the chance that the next bull run does not bring new all time highs depends on what crypto asset you're talking about. I won't consider it a bull run until we do reach new all time highs. However, and the idea that ether and bitcoin won't reach new all time highs again, I ascribe 0% chance to 1% chance for bitcoin.
01:20:23.262 - 01:21:16.366, Speaker B: Yeah, it's basically if that happens, then kind of crypto is dead. It's just like if you believe it's going to hit another bull run, the contrary bet to all of this is like you betting against fundamental human nature, right. To think that another bull market won't play out like the last three or four in crypto, it'll play out similar. There will be some differences, it could be longers, there could be different highs or lows. But fundamentally we're just looking at fractals and we'll see the exact same fractal play out in the next bull market. And if you think that we won't hit all time highs, it's kind of because you think crypto has already peaked is at zero. And if you think we peaked at how many hundred and 50 million people around the world that own crypto, how many people are in DFI right now? The population of a large city? I don't know, maybe five to 10 million, something like that.
01:21:16.366 - 01:21:37.466, Speaker B: It's relatively small. If that's our peak, wow, I would be blown away surprised. We are just scratching the surface. We're still in this early adopter phase. So you have to be patient. Here's the thing. This market will also test your faith or your belief in that because you'll see some jumps and then it'll hit something and it's not quite all time high.
01:21:37.466 - 01:21:46.686, Speaker B: And then you'll go back down and it'll be apathy for like weeks and months. You'll be like, oh, maybe it was all over. Maybe Bankless was wrong about this. Maybe the thesis is not playing out.
01:21:46.708 - 01:21:48.126, Speaker A: How I thought isn't going to ten.
01:21:48.148 - 01:22:13.222, Speaker B: K. Oh, no, maybe none of those things. It's you just have to be patient is the thing. And yeah, that's coming from somebody who we've been through a couple of these cycles. I felt these same things. I asked that same question that you're asking last cycle and I guess I feel like I know how it's going to play out for the next cycle. Not exactly, but I'm making the bet for sure.
01:22:13.222 - 01:22:25.610, Speaker B: David, we got another question from Zen mode. How do you think the Shanghai upgrade will impact LSD narratives? St ETH dominance versus re is the question from Zen mode here.
01:22:25.680 - 01:23:11.050, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is definitely in vogue in conversation, in the ethereum land is like all are when withdrawals are unlocked, what's going to happen? What are the narratives? I think we were talking a little bit about this last week. Lido has a ton of ETH that is locked in its vaults that becomes unlockable. And so we are going to see how much of that Lido staked ETH gets withdrawn, how much of that withdrawals goes into other liquid staking derivatives like rocket pool stakewise, maybe centralized providers? Hopefully not. And so that's like rocket pool super hungry for some of Lido's ETH. Like if you're a rocket pool bull, you think that that's going to become your staked ETH inside of rocket pool. And the only reason why it's not already is because we haven't enabled withdrawals.
01:23:11.050 - 01:23:29.854, Speaker A: And so people are know, they're all chomping at the bit to eat at Lido's ether. And Lido is probably like, you guys aren't going to get any of my ether. This is my ether. You're not getting any of it. And so this is really the fight that's going on right now.
01:23:30.052 - 01:23:57.378, Speaker B: Yeah. I just wanted to find some terms for people right. To make this a little 101. How do you think the Shanghai upgrade? Shanghai is an ethereum upgrade that is probably coming the end of this quarter or early next quarter that will enable people to unlock their staked ETH. Okay, so that's what the question is asking will impact LSD narratives. That is liquid staking derivative narratives for two specific protocols. That is liquid staked ETH and liquid staked rocket pool ETH.
01:23:57.378 - 01:24:19.994, Speaker B: Liquid staking is basically just like once you stake your ETH, you have the ability to then use that staked ETH as a token, do other cool DeFi things. You can hold it in your wallet, you can trade against it. So it's actually fully liquid. It's not staked. It doesn't feel like it's locked anymore. It's a token representation of that stake. And I do think you're right, David.
01:24:19.994 - 01:24:42.466, Speaker B: It's just we've talked about this on Bankless. This is kind of a snow globe moment for liquid staking, which is like you're going to shake the snow globe again and then all the kind of the snowflakes are going to just fall in different places. I don't think it's going to be just down to these two. Right. Lido versus rocket pool. You mentioned a couple of new entrants. I'm aware of a slew of new entrants.
01:24:42.498 - 01:24:46.786, Speaker A: There's a bunch of startups. Some are in stealth mode, some are about to ship.
01:24:46.898 - 01:25:05.774, Speaker B: They all know this date and they're hungry and they know the market's going to reopen after the Shanghai upgrade and they're chomping at the bit. So big opportunity. The games are just beginning. That's right. All right. Speaking of which, David, let's get to some Takes of the Week. Are you ready for the first one?
01:25:05.812 - 01:25:06.942, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it.
01:25:07.076 - 01:25:23.134, Speaker B: All right. Take of the week. This is from Lal. I will read the tweet out. Lal says there are a. Dozen or so Nike Swoosh level memes that could emerge from independent crypto artists in the next decade. Artists is leveraging the power of Creative Commons IP and Immutable Tech to compete with behemoth institutions.
01:25:23.134 - 01:25:28.014, Speaker B: Here are a few in the running at this time. What are we looking at here?
01:25:28.072 - 01:25:37.318, Speaker A: So these are the noggles, the Nouns. Goggles, the nouns. Glasses. Absolutely iconic. They were in a Super Bowl. Coming up next I actually don't know what this one is.
01:25:37.404 - 01:25:40.966, Speaker B: This is Cowboy's Shadow. Not iconic for David and I yet.
01:25:41.068 - 01:26:01.722, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know what that is. This is an MFer, which I'm a huge fan of. And this is X Copy. Right. So these are some of the very identifiable, very decentralized headless brands. And this kind of goes back to the conversation about the talent agency out of Moonbirds versus a headless brand like MFRS. I'm a big fan of the headless brand movement.
01:26:01.722 - 01:26:03.006, Speaker A: I think MF cool.
01:26:03.028 - 01:26:03.566, Speaker B: It's new.
01:26:03.668 - 01:26:14.034, Speaker A: I think MFers are so iconic and so recognizable that calling them the decentralized Nike Swoosh brand of Web Three I think is a great take. That's why I put it in here.
01:26:14.152 - 01:26:14.978, Speaker B: Look at that guy.
01:26:15.064 - 01:26:21.398, Speaker A: Look at that guy. He's so cute. He's being a little MFer. This is like minding his own business, duping around on his computer.
01:26:21.484 - 01:27:03.758, Speaker B: What's cool about this is unlike the Swoosh, no one owns it, right? I mean, Nike owns the IP of the Swoosh and they're going to do the contracts with all the athletes to plus up the swoosh and make it cool. It's up to these communities to kind of do that. It's just a completely fundamentally new model that. Do you remember the take of the professor we had on a week or two ago and talking about copyright? Yeah. Brian Fry, he's basically like, NFTs may kill copyright. You may not need it. Any know if if he's right about that, then I definitely think something is going to emerge as a Nike Swoosh probably even bigger.
01:27:03.758 - 01:27:22.170, Speaker B: Chris Berninski says, if I had to guess, this rally has legs. People were so downcast near the bottom that lots are probably poorly positioned, may end up chasing it. If they can't take the FOMO, doesn't mean we won't get a retest later. But a hated rally for a time makes the most sense here. What do you think?
01:27:22.240 - 01:27:37.086, Speaker A: So he is, quote, retweeting DC investor who is saying, I'd prefer if no one really trusted this rally. So people are going back and forth and like, all right, like ether is up, like a couple hundred dollars. Bitcoin's up a couple thousand dollars. OOH, we're bullish. We're bullish. I'm definitely guilty of this as well.
01:27:37.108 - 01:27:37.914, Speaker B: Back on, baby.
01:27:37.962 - 01:28:02.034, Speaker A: But Chris Berniski is saying, if I had to guess, this rally has legs, implying that there's a real movement here. Like people were overly bearish. And now because we stopped going down, people are saying, well, if we're going to stop going down, does that mean, we're going to go up and that's what is happening. And so Chris is just saying people were overly bearish. And so this rally is real spike.
01:28:02.082 - 01:28:23.920, Speaker B: Up and then a retest probably. That's how it's played out in the past. So we were light on the takes this week. So I'm just going to ask you a question, David, that I'm curious about, because we never discussed this. Now that we're in 2023, we can look back and zoom out and reflect on 2022. Do you regret it? Would you wipe wipe out the year 2022 in crypto if you could?
01:28:24.690 - 01:28:47.186, Speaker A: This is a very deep philosophical question, I think, because all right, would you go back and erase World War II? Would you go back and erase the kill baby Hitler? Yeah. Kill Baby Hitler. I might kill Baby Hitler. I might do that. But then if I didn't, my philosophy on this is like, okay, if I did kill baby Hitler, there would just be another one later.
01:28:47.288 - 01:28:47.554, Speaker B: Right?
01:28:47.592 - 01:28:57.430, Speaker A: Like, you actually don't solve the problem. He wasn't the problem. There was a deeper root problem. Right? Like there was mob mentality in the created the space for that. Right.
01:28:57.500 - 01:29:13.790, Speaker B: So there's a take from history, which is like, look, something like that was inevitable. I mean, the shape of it was definitely shaped by the person. But there's some inevitability about the lesson that people need to learn at that time, something like this.
01:29:13.860 - 01:29:28.114, Speaker A: So who was the biggest villain of 2022? It was like SBF. Right? So would I. Delete FTX and SBF. Well, sure, but then it would just leave the door open for a different person to do the same exact thing.
01:29:28.232 - 01:29:28.514, Speaker B: Right.
01:29:28.552 - 01:30:03.726, Speaker A: And so humans, we learn through pain. If everyone is feeling very has a mindset of pain right now and loss because a lot of their hard earned money is now worth a lot less, this is a lesson that you are now going to learn. And if we didn't learn this as an industry in 2022, then we were just going to learn it at a different time and maybe it would actually be even more painful. And so I'm not really one to say that 2022 brought nothing of value. It definitely brought hardship. You know, that meme of good times. Hard times breed strong people.
01:30:03.726 - 01:30:18.020, Speaker A: Strong people produce good times. Good times produce weak people. Weak people produce hard times. I just see us going through that cycle and you can't skip forward in that cycle. Like, you have to experience, for better or for worse, all parts of it.
01:30:18.390 - 01:30:42.126, Speaker B: I agree with that. I just don't have a dissenting opinion on that. I think 2022 needed to happen. Ultimately, it was healthy. It's going to be good for us long term. We have to kind of zoom out and with all of this stuff, you have to take the bad with the good. I just look at the way we were entering 2023 and I contrast that with the way we entered 2022.
01:30:42.126 - 01:31:15.650, Speaker B: And the way we entered 2022 was very deeply, fundamentally unhealthy. It felt like kind of just a different kind of community that was not in touch with the utility it was providing to the world and was not in touch with its core values. And I feel coming into 2023, like, we've restored some of that. Yeah, it's more quiet. Yeah. We don't have the kind of the mainstream attention, but guess what? We haven't deserved it yet. We're still in the early years of this decade, so let's go and earn it.
01:31:15.650 - 01:31:45.178, Speaker B: So I'm actually happy that 2022 happened. It's unfortunate a lot of people got hurt. If you could win these lessons without that, that would be amazing. But I just don't think life works like that, at least. Yeah. I've always learned through my mistakes and through kind of problems, as long as they're not catastrophic, then we can kind of learn and rebuild and move on and be stronger. So, yeah, I agree with you.
01:31:45.178 - 01:31:48.734, Speaker B: I didn't know what your take would be, though. But that's interesting. That's what it is.
01:31:48.772 - 01:32:39.150, Speaker A: So the only thing I want to add on to this is this should always be a moment of reflection. Like, bull markets make people think and do things and become a different person. Everyone's a different person in the middle of a manic bull market. And so you should think about how did that bull market change you as an investor, as a person, as a character? How did it change your personality? And how perhaps did that impact your decisions to buy or sell? Like, did you FOMO into that? NFT you should have a self reflective moment as to like, how did that impact me? Because we are going to do it again. And if you are not in more deeper touch with yourself that because of this last bull market that we went through, you perhaps will make the same exact mistakes that you made last bull cycle. So that'll be my one message about that.
01:32:39.220 - 01:32:41.626, Speaker B: All right, man. So what are you bullish on this week, David?
01:32:41.818 - 01:32:45.646, Speaker A: Well, this is going to be a moment where I'm glad that I'm going first because I know that you and I are bullish.
01:32:45.678 - 01:32:46.642, Speaker B: You took mine, didn't you?
01:32:46.696 - 01:33:12.218, Speaker A: The same thing. Yeah. So we just recorded this episode with Wayne from Spruce ID, which is the organization working on the sign in with Ethereum standard. It was a good episode. A really, really good episode. I think it's going to be one of these episodes that embeds itself into listeners'brains. They're probably going to be thinking about it for a very long time, about its implications, and they're going to realize that they are here for the tech.
01:33:12.218 - 01:33:33.230, Speaker A: Because I think the best take out of that episode is that Google, Facebook, Apple are just banks for our identity and our data. So you got the banks of TradFi, but the banks of silicon are banks for your data and your identity. And this has all been a part of the grand crypto vision. First money, then identity.
01:33:33.970 - 01:33:37.410, Speaker B: Yeah, look, you took mine, so I'm just going to plus one.
01:33:37.480 - 01:33:38.370, Speaker A: I did, I'm sorry.
01:33:38.440 - 01:34:11.020, Speaker B: But look, our brains are in sync on this. I think we both feel that the time for identity, for decentralized identity, is here. It's just like firing up. It's like 2016 again. The birth of Ethereum and smart contracts and programmable money. Now we have this decentralized programmable identity type of primitive taking hold. And I feel strongly, David, that identity could be just as important, just as profound, if not maybe in some ways more profound than money, than taking back money.
01:34:11.020 - 01:34:43.618, Speaker B: And this is a technology that I think I support. I believe it's net good for the world. What's nice about this, too, is the signing with Ethereum. There's no bags to shill, there's no token. All right? And how can anybody be mad about this? External to crypto, it's literally a net good created. It's a public good created as a byproduct of the existence of Ethereum. If Ethereum didn't exist, I don't think we could have a decentralized identity tool like signing with Ethereum.
01:34:43.618 - 01:34:59.734, Speaker B: And if, by the way, you don't know what we're talking about right now at this point, why this is so great, or why David and I are so excited about it. Stay tuned for that episode. I think it's coming out. Not next week. Next week is Tyler Cowan on Monday, but the week after, I think, is when we have this slated.
01:34:59.782 - 01:35:03.642, Speaker A: David yeah, but it'll be next week for Bankless Premium subscribers who get the early release.
01:35:03.706 - 01:35:13.966, Speaker B: There you go. And, yeah, you tell us if you think it's as important as an episode and a topic as we do. David Meme of the week. What do we got this week?
01:35:14.068 - 01:35:29.010, Speaker A: Meme of the week. Meme of the week. I saw this one on Twitter. We might have actually done this meme before, I think we have. But since it was a CPI print day today, we're bringing this meme back. And it's the meme of the Chad human looking at a monkey. The Chad human is saying, you're such a dumb animal.
01:35:29.010 - 01:35:39.782, Speaker A: And then the monkey responds. You're waiting for the Fed to tell you how much value your anti establishment digital currency will. Well, we are kind of doing that.
01:35:39.836 - 01:35:43.034, Speaker B: We are subject to the gravitational forces of the fed, aren't we?
01:35:43.152 - 01:35:46.570, Speaker A: But that's the system we're trying to disrupt. We're just not there yet.
01:35:46.640 - 01:35:50.634, Speaker B: Yeah, we got a long way to go. Stay tuned for the moment of Zen this week.
01:35:50.672 - 01:36:03.550, Speaker A: By the way, great moment of Zen. If you are listening to this on the podcast, it's a good song, but it is an even greater video. So definitely watch it on Twitter, which is where it's hosted, and that's that.
01:36:03.700 - 01:36:17.122, Speaker B: Well, I'll end, as I always do, risks and disclaimers of course. Crypto is risky, so is DeFi. You could definitely lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey.
01:36:17.122 - 01:36:18.200, Speaker B: Thanks a lot.
