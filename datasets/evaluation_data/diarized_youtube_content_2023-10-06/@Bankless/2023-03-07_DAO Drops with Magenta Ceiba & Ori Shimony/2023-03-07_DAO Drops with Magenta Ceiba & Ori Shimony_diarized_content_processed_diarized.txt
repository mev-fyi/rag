00:00:05.690 - 00:00:06.046, Speaker A: What up?
00:00:06.068 - 00:00:51.622, Speaker B: Coordination. How you doing on the Pod today we have Dow Drops, which is an experiment in retroactive public goods funding built by Diorg and supported by the Ethereum Foundation 250K retroactive Public goods funding Round that is happening in Q 120 23. So I'm joined by Ori and Magenta, who are from Diorg and are administered during the round. I got to say that Dowdrops is just beautiful. I love their website, I love their vibe, I love that they're experimenting with public goods. And so on the Pod, we talk micro, we talk about Dow Drops in Round About. And then we expanded all the way out into the ultimate vision for Dow Drops and the collective vision that we have for crypto regenerating the world with public goods and a pluralistic mechanism.
00:00:51.622 - 00:01:44.478, Speaker B: Of all these different dows and mechanisms that are going to be funding public goods, the ones off the top of my head that I'm thinking of here are dow drops, optimism, retroactive public goods, funding Gitcoin, Clr Fund giveth. There's a dozen others that are building this ecosystem of funding public goods and how crypto, its main export to the world, could be public goods. And then we kind of just focus in on Dow Drops and the experiment in retroactive public goods funding that they are running. And I just think it's such an exciting time to see a beautifully designed app by An.org that I respect so much, Diorg that is working on public goods funding. And so we get really into the why, what, how, who of Dow Drops for that reason. It's one of my favorite episodes on public goods funding that we've done so far.
00:01:44.478 - 00:01:48.026, Speaker B: So, coordination, I hope that you enjoy this episode with Dowdrops.
00:01:48.138 - 00:02:26.742, Speaker C: Working in Web three is awesome, but working outside of the typical W Two employee structure is a deal breaker for so many. Opolis is helping the self sovereign worker focus on what they do best. Their work. Tax time is coming up. Opolis helps professionalize your business by helping you form an entity, generate proof of employment through Pay subs, and receive a W Two at the end of the tax year. Are you self employed and forced to spend money on expensive healthcare insurance with limited coverage? Opelis leverages group buying power through a community employment coop, helping you save 20% to 50% on high quality, affordable healthcare options through Cigna. And finally, Opelis's member owners share in Opelis's success and profits based on their work token holdings.
00:02:26.742 - 00:03:03.474, Speaker C: You must be authorized to work inside the United States in select Canadian provinces to receive Opelis's benefits. Book a 30 minutes free consultation with Opelis's experts and join Opelus by March 31, 2023 to get a thousand work and a thousand bank tokens. Go to connect Opelis Co bankless to get started. And if you're going to East Denver, make sure to stop by the Opelis booth or attend their Future of Work summit hosted by Opolis. The Glow dollar is a new coin with a very special property. As the market cap of Glow goes up, extreme poverty goes down. Glow is a dollar backed non profit stablecoin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty.
00:03:03.474 - 00:03:39.582, Speaker C: Glow is basically the same business model as USDC, with yield generating Treasuries on one side and a stablecoin on Ethereum on the other. But instead of being a for profit company, glow is a nonprofit that donates 100% of all yields from the Glow Reserve to Give Directly's basic Income Program. Give Directly is a charity that gives people money, no strings attached, to people living in poverty, and is a charity that Vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past. With Glow, you can reduce poverty just by holding a stablecoin. Glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist@glowdollar.org. Greenpill. That's glowdollar.org
00:03:39.582 - 00:03:40.770, Speaker C: greenpill.
00:03:43.270 - 00:03:52.040, Speaker B: What's up, y'all? Thanks for joining me. Yeah, so maybe we'll tee off with a round of intros. Magenta, you want to go first?
00:03:52.730 - 00:04:07.770, Speaker D: Oh, sure. I'm Magenta. I'm a project manager with Diorg based in New Hampshire, and I generally work on public goods and refi projects and also Dow tooling with both Diorg and Bloom Network.
00:04:08.910 - 00:04:09.322, Speaker A: Great.
00:04:09.376 - 00:04:55.580, Speaker E: Go ahead, ori yeah, and I generally work on governance. Dows public goods have been in this space since getting my feet wet in 2015 with a cryptography professor I was working with at UVA on researching how you could layer in incentives into the Tor network. And then figuring out how you could do what we'd call Dows now on bitcoin pre smart contracts and then got really excited when Ethereum launched and since then have been writing smart contracts and then shifting over to operating dows and kind of getting people organized around how to solve different coordination problems with mechanism design. So doing that mainly through Diorg with Magenta and 100 other awesome humans around the world.
00:04:58.430 - 00:05:16.414, Speaker B: Well, when I saw Dow Drops on Twitter and just the vibe of coordination and public goods and the sort of vapor wave design for it, I was really excited about us. Can you tell us about Dow Drops and the retroactive public goods funding experiment.
00:05:16.462 - 00:05:19.442, Speaker A: That y'all are doing there? Sure.
00:05:19.496 - 00:06:07.682, Speaker E: So, really briefly, Dowdrops is a pilot. It's an experiment in how to just put the decision making power into the hands of the people who know best what to do with it, and then just dropping money into a mechanism that can aggregate their preferences and giving money out in that way. And so the framing for Dow Drops is to select and vote on people that have already contributed to the public good in the Ethereum ecosystem. So it's not like a grant system for future work, but it's more just a reward system for past work. And the idea is that if you evolve a mechanism like this, you do it repetitively, eventually continuously, then you could actually alter behavior and drive people to spend more time working on the public good because they have an incredibly neutral, reliable mechanism that will reward them for doing so.
00:06:07.816 - 00:06:26.454, Speaker B: Okay, well, we'd love to dive into Round One. It looks like it started on or. You all launched on January twelveTH and Round one is distributing 250K USDC. So we're recording on February 23. Where are you all? What's the status as of February 23.
00:06:26.492 - 00:06:27.670, Speaker A: Of that first round?
00:06:28.110 - 00:07:19.898, Speaker D: So we're just finishing up the KYC and official information gathering from the final nominees. So we gathered a smaller subset of all of the nominees, kind of ruled out folks that weren't quite aligned with public goods funding and kind of optimized for kind of under visible, underfunded sort of corners of the then. So we're just finishing up that info gathering process and then we'll load those finalists into the UI of the app. And then like Ori described, the people who have voting points from their on chain activity will be able to drop those points. It looks like a really cute video game. This part I'm excited for. And you can drop your points into the projects that you want to receive a percentage of the overall funding and that will happen.
00:07:19.898 - 00:07:24.794, Speaker D: We'll probably start that round in a week, maybe two weeks, and that'll run.
00:07:24.832 - 00:07:27.082, Speaker A: For I think we have that running.
00:07:27.136 - 00:07:28.780, Speaker D: For two weeks, possibly three.
00:07:29.550 - 00:07:57.700, Speaker B: Okay, so it's February 23 right now. I've got a couple of East Denver episodes we're going to push out for the next week. And then this episode will probably go out the first week of March. So as the listeners, as this is hitting your ear, then will it be in the phase in which people can actually vote if they have on chain history, which allows them to be voting? And it sounds like it's kind of like a cute, fun game where people can allocate capital to those projects retroactively, is that right?
00:07:58.870 - 00:08:44.500, Speaker D: Yes, and that's the right timing. So be sure to check in the app if you have voting points with multiple different wallet addresses. Likely. We pulled data from the DevCon and East Denver Poaps from the Galaxy shadowy supercoders list. So if you've deployed Smart contracts on Ethereum and then lastly if you participate in Dows, we pulled the data list from Dow Drops or sorry, deep Dows Analytics. So any of those activities, check the wallet addresses and you probably have points there's, I think 113,000 wallet addresses, 130,000 that have points. So definitely take a look.
00:08:44.870 - 00:08:50.166, Speaker B: So the URL, if I'm listening to this, the URL I want to go to is Dowdrops IO, is that right?
00:08:50.348 - 00:08:52.294, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:08:52.412 - 00:09:06.220, Speaker B: I've got it up on a monitor right here. And I got to say it's very beautiful in Vapor Wave. And so I'm excited to see the actual user interface of the game. It looks like you all put a lot of polish into the design, so kudos on that.
00:09:06.670 - 00:09:10.198, Speaker D: Yeah, that was Colin. What's Colin's last name? Maury.
00:09:10.294 - 00:09:11.690, Speaker A: Fence. Fence.
00:09:12.430 - 00:09:14.670, Speaker D: And Maria.
00:09:16.850 - 00:09:17.406, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:09:17.508 - 00:09:51.670, Speaker B: Well, great work, colin and Maria. I'm a simp for Vaporwave kind of design, so great work. Would love to talk a little bit about the origin of the project. So why retroactive public goods funding? How did this project come about? And in a world in which you all are maximally successful, what does Dow Drops look like in, I don't know, round 15 or Round 69? Play us forward a little bit. In a world in which you all are maximally successful, what Dow Drops looks like, definitely.
00:09:51.820 - 00:11:22.870, Speaker E: So, starting at the beginning, I guess the idea has probably been out there in different forms for a long time but I think Vitalik did a good job of crystallizing it like a year or two with a blog post and a talk he gave on retroactive public goods funding. The idea being that most of public goods funding is forward looking, it's people promising to do stuff for a grant but it's actually really hard to vet how well people will do in advance and what the impact they have will be if they're trustworthy to pull it off, if they'll run into roadblocks. So it would be better potentially for certain kinds of work anyways if you could just look in the past and reward people in some way for that. And that way people who did kind of maybe minor things at the time, maybe on their spare time that actually ended up having a big impact, could be rewarded and so this could drive behavior going forward. And so I think Fatali kind of put out there as an idea and then Optimism might have been the first team to really put it into action with their I don't know the exact details, I think it was with their AirDrop. They allocated a portion of the Op supply to projects, individuals that had contributed to the public good according to some sort of heuristic that they used. And then there's other kind of more sophisticated ideas out there for how Rpgf could work in the future and some of them include sort of tokens that you would buy ahead of time that might be not worth anything.
00:11:22.870 - 00:12:18.834, Speaker E: And then if the action ends up being good for the public, then a retroactive public funder which could be big organizations, high net worth individuals or crowdfunded could purchase those kind of tokens in the future. So we didn't go with one of those approaches because I think there's still like regulatory uncertainty and a lot of R and D that has to be done there. But we wanted to do something more straightforward. And most importantly for us is empowering the crowd as the evaluators and doing so in such a way that we're measuring people's past on chain activity to decide how much power different addresses have, and in a way that doesn't actually require us to check identity, to know that it's one person, one account. Since the scoring is just based on actual things you've done. It doesn't matter if you did it through one address or through seven addresses. So that's a little bit more about the context of, I guess, the idea of public goods funding and then the mechanism.
00:12:18.834 - 00:13:44.562, Speaker E: And I guess the short version of the story of how we got here is that someone, Joe J from the EF who was formerly at the EF, basically reached out to us with this problem of the EF is a small organization. They have a lot of money that they have to get out fairly intelligently fairly quickly. And how can this small nonprofit know all of the areas in the ecosystem that most need resources? And so we talked with them and brainstormed ideas. Kind of went really wide at the whole design space, looked at a lot of stuff Gitcoin has done, stuff Optimism did and clr several other projects, and then came away with this as kind of a good way to trial the idea and to do it in a way that's round based, where there could be iteration, where we didn't have to over design or over build the first time before we had any learnings. So the idea really is to do it polished and well thought through, but a little bit quick and dirty, right? Like a little bit get it out there, ship, build in public, get feedback, do a report afterwards with what happened. We've already learned so much and already people have come to us with ideas and we've amongst ourselves come up with them kind of as it's gone. But yeah, really kind of grateful that the EF was willing to run this experiment with us and kind of give us a little drop of funding to kind of get out there.
00:13:44.562 - 00:14:49.820, Speaker E: And hopefully eventually this could I guess to answer your question about the grand vision, I would love it if this went really well. And then round two was slightly bigger and got more sponsors and on and on. And eventually this was, at least for the Ethereum ecosystem, one of the key places that they could just drop money and then they'll know that there's an intelligent swarm that's going to allocate it to where it needs to go. Some other kind of future visions is that mechanisms like this, whether it's us doing it or not, should be kind of really core to large ecosystems, anything from like L ones to large DFI Dows or even like networked states. You need a way to kind of allocate resources towards network goods. And so we think that this is a tool that you could eventually use for, let's say, taking whatever taxation your system has or inflation. So like monetary or fiscal policy, it could be like a decentralized way of allocating resources that are collected in whatever manner an ecosystem has access to.
00:14:50.270 - 00:14:50.906, Speaker A: Thanks so much.
00:14:50.928 - 00:14:52.700, Speaker B: Tori Magenta. Anything to add?
00:14:53.790 - 00:16:19.122, Speaker D: Oh, one of the areas I think feature wise that's interesting for this project to instigate and also develop itself is around algorithmic governance. So how you pull on chain data or even in more real world applications, real world experience, that people have to make sure that diverse stakeholders and diverse mixes of different types of experts or stakeholders are able to make decisions about where finance flows in an ecosystem or a coalition, that sort of thing. And yeah, as we run analytics on on chain activity and start to have all kinds of things of interesting combinations of that. Use machine intelligence to know what would be learned over time. What are good combinations of types of diversity that you need to limit bad consequences? Or a certain small group of people having a disproportionate amount of resources and attention in an ecosystem that kind of, like, shoots the ecosystem in the foot. Right, because they're, like, missing really key ingredients. Or in the case of real world public goods, messing with not getting the market dynamics quite correct, with actually rebalancing local ecosystems and the whole market dynamics of that regionally and globally.
00:16:19.122 - 00:16:29.260, Speaker D: So yeah, the whole field of other governance I think, is very underexplored and I think this project opens up a window into what's possible there.
00:16:30.270 - 00:16:31.286, Speaker A: Yeah amen.
00:16:31.398 - 00:17:58.086, Speaker B: Well, I'm just so long on collective intelligence for network goods. I envision a pluralistic infrastructure for funding public goods where there's a pluralism of mechanisms, quadratic funding, retroactive public goods funding, give backs, dominance assurance contracts, probably a bunch of mechanisms that haven't even been invented yet and people will be earning from completing public goods from these pluralistic set of mechanisms. And each mechanism might be good at X and Y, but bad at Z and A, b and C and it's the pluralism of mechanisms that allows each mechanism to do one thing and do it. ARN McMillan and I ARN started clr Fund. And of course, I'm a founder of Gitcoin, have been talking about this idea of practical pluralism for a long time, about how these public goods funding mechanisms can kind of coexist with each other and inspired by the ethereum clients and how they have client diversity with one another can kind of coexist. The client diversity at the base layer of the ethereum network creates an anti fragility in the ethereum network because if one client gets messed up, then the network doesn't fork. And the same thing should be true with public goods funding is that you should have a pluralism of mechanisms that support public goods in different ways.
00:17:58.086 - 00:18:35.986, Speaker B: And I'm just really here for it. The gestalt of all the different mechanisms together is really cool. And I think the ultimate sort of pluralistic thing that we could do is all be supporting each other in order to creating this world of public goods together. And I really believe that crypto can regenerate the world when we've got a pluralism of these mechanisms and they're well funded and starting to scale to funding the world's public goods. So I think that my vision is somewhat aligned with Dowdrop's vision but I'll be curious if you have any sort of reaction to that or to that.
00:18:36.008 - 00:18:37.300, Speaker A: Prompt in any way.
00:18:38.710 - 00:19:36.354, Speaker E: Yeah, I definitely think that composability is key, that we're all running these little experiments and they're all in an aggregate scale like rapidly iterating spreading or dying. And so we have this nice kind of evolutionary process right now running where the best things get copied and the things that didn't quite work wither away. And so I think the fact that they're happening on these common substrates of open public blockchains makes the composability really compelling and natural. So in the same way that the first couple of airdrops uniswap and then the others, they could quickly copy that mechanism and they realized for a little bit they thought it worked and then it wasn't working as well. And people have refined the way it happens. Gitcoin obviously had a way more sophisticated one because they were able to learn from the pluses and minuses of past approaches. And I think there's still a lot of missing pieces.
00:19:36.354 - 00:20:03.018, Speaker E: And that's why the conversations are important that happen between projects like Gitcoin clr Dowdrops because where ultimately we could be reducing the work by reusing common components. And I think, like a really good example of this, I've been talking to Holke a lot at Hyperserts out of protocol labs, so I think something like that's really cool, where Gitcoin could plug into that and maybe real quick, can.
00:20:03.024 - 00:20:03.974, Speaker B: We just explain what Hyper?
00:20:04.022 - 00:20:04.410, Speaker E: Yeah, exactly.
00:20:04.480 - 00:20:06.266, Speaker B: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. I just wanted to explain what hyper.
00:20:06.298 - 00:20:07.642, Speaker A: Certs were to the audience.
00:20:07.786 - 00:20:40.450, Speaker E: Yeah, let's both try because I'm going to do a bad job. So my attempt will be it's like a way to have an on chain certification that you did something and you don't necessarily know if that thing had impact yet but it's basically a tokenized representation of some attempt at public good that you did and then it could be purchased in the future by retroactive public funder. Did I do a good job? I'm curious what you would say because it's a fairly new concept.
00:20:40.530 - 00:20:43.754, Speaker A: Yeah, I would describe a hyper cert.
00:20:43.792 - 00:21:23.350, Speaker B: As like a carbon credit but on any impact vector. So I took ten tons of carbon out of the atmosphere. Or we could have a hyper cert for I fixed ten potholes in my street. I funded ten months of open source software. And so whatever the plurality of types of capital there are, whether it's spiritual capital or intellectual capital or material capital, you could mint a hyper cert for it. And then once you've got impact owls that are issuing hyper certs, if you can engineer buy pressure for those hyper certs, then what you've done is you've given every impact owl. People are creating value, a way to capture value because they're printing hyper certs and with buy pressure, that means that you're generating revenue by generating impact.
00:21:23.350 - 00:22:31.050, Speaker B: And it gives every impact. Owl a business model from there and like a granular way of tracking impact, which is important for impact evaluation, but also the buy pressure is important for funding public goods. And so the combination of these things is that with retroactive public goods funding if I believe in the present that I'm able to generate $100 million exit for investors by just supporting public goods. Then VCs and angels will start investing in public goods on the expectation that in ten years that between Dow drops and optimism and all these other things, they'll be able to have 100 million dollar exit and that allows in the present people to invest in those projects seeking that exit in the future. And hyper certs could be like a way of connecting the impact that you've created now to that future payout in the future. That's the way I sort of stitch the ideas together but as I'm saying it, I feel like Charlie and Ollie Sonny kind of really try to stitch it together in a crazy way but the sketch is there. I think the skeleton for how web3 can fund public goods in a pluralistic way is all sort of there.
00:22:31.050 - 00:22:32.620, Speaker B: What's your reaction to that?
00:22:33.790 - 00:22:54.110, Speaker E: Totally, and I think hypersits are really nice because they're a data layer and it's really agnostic to what you do with the data. So the way I've understood it is you could have evaluators of different sorts and different sorts of networks or protocols or even centralized bodies acting as evaluators and then there's an even different layer which is the funders.
00:22:54.270 - 00:22:54.594, Speaker A: Right?
00:22:54.632 - 00:23:45.862, Speaker E: So it's nice because it's this building block stack where any one part can kind of fail or be experimented with and it only kind of improves the whole. And so I think hyperstarts are really nice as a bottom layer. And then you have things like Verifiable credentials. Another cool project that reached out to us is like the Ethereum To station service. And I know there's a lot of projects in the Verifiable Credential space, and then you have things like Claros where you can have these subjectivity oracles. And so I really like the way things are going right now, where everyone is in their little pocket of this net and is really trying hard to make it work and then seeing how they can link up to other parts. And every once in a while, I think we'll have these breakthroughs where it's like again, like the Gitcoin quadratic funding, where it's like that was one of many ideas that were talked about in this space.
00:23:45.862 - 00:24:02.860, Speaker E: But it was able to have the right UX, the right mechanism design and the right kind of storytelling to make it actually impact the real world, right? And not just be another idea that's floating around in the mechanism design space.
00:24:04.030 - 00:25:43.402, Speaker D: Yeah, the other thing I would add in that is that those data layers and hyper certs also present the potential for peer learning. So ways to access the data. Like I heard a person from Agroforest Dow describe, like if I was working with a new seed because the climate in my region is shifting and I have to find plants that are adapted to that and learn how to grow them. For the first time I can look into the hyperserts and see who has used that in their verification of carbon credits or some kind of food system sovereignty thing and then maybe even contact them or find how to get in touch and ask for tips on growing this or maybe that's packed into the hypersert. The collective sense making of that, and also the potential for IRL community adoption and leadership with these sorts of tools is the other kind of potential that comes to mind with these open system collaborative approaches to it. Because once those people grab hold of those tools, they're not technology anchored, right? They look at kind of a different mindset and so the creative ways that they use those. Yeah, I'm just excited to see this space now that the UX is starting to be more and more usable by people who aren't engineers, that just opens up a whole nother possibility space of how the public goods funding tools get used, but also the leadership diversifies of who is kind of directing the development of them.
00:25:43.402 - 00:25:51.790, Speaker D: So that's a really exciting cusp of development that's I think happening right now across the ethereum ecosystem.
00:25:53.410 - 00:25:54.590, Speaker A: Yeah, totally.
00:25:55.330 - 00:26:02.640, Speaker B: Anything else that's in the Dow Drops vision or the world that you want to create that you want to say within the next ten minutes?
00:26:03.410 - 00:26:52.586, Speaker E: Yeah, I'll piggyback off what Magenta said about taking this kind of outside the crypto space into IRL. So I think we and a lot of people in the space see crypto as the natural testing ground for these things because they're using smart contracts, they're using cryptocurrency. And so it makes sense to test those with public goods funding in those communities. Right, but people shouldn't forget that that's not the goal. Right, that's one step along the way to the goal. But for us, like I was saying earlier, the vision of having L ones and things like that use mechanisms like this to fund network goods is like one massive important stepping stone. And then we don't want to delay for too long the extension of this into communities that have nothing to do with crypto.
00:26:52.586 - 00:28:13.386, Speaker E: And so I think Magenta and I both in different ways are involved in these IRL communities where people are experimenting with provisioning the commons in new ways and we want to be part of the force kind of bringing crypto in light ways, smart contracts into those spaces. And so I think some interesting people reached out about using Dow Drops, like running it for different kinds of IRL public goods funding. And just generally I think currency design, quadratic voting and all these different things. It's really interesting to start to see where are the first places, what are going to be the first dominoes to fall of where people are willing to experiment with this offline or outside of crypto. So municipalities or federated co ops or maybe there's larger scale kind of like large NGOs or corporates or other kinds of communities like online communities that find this useful, that as the kind of different building blocks get into place, like Wallet UX improves social recovery, account abstraction, all these things that we've imagined for a long time become more possible. And a lot of times as crypto people, we forget about that. We just assume like, oh yeah, there's too high a barrier to entry, but actually that barrier to entry is going down all the time.
00:28:13.386 - 00:28:25.470, Speaker E: So it becomes more and more possible every couple months that go by to try something out like this that touches worlds outside of our smart contract crypto bubbles?
00:28:26.530 - 00:28:27.840, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure.
00:28:29.650 - 00:29:35.298, Speaker B: I did this experiment with Zach Herring and Katie Johnson who are two of my compatriots back when Gitcoin was at consensus and we just yoloed together a 25K round and a completely new platform for doing quadratic funding in downtown Boulder, Colorado in mid 2020. We had saw that our local community, that the retail businesses on Main Street had seen their rent dropped by or sorry, not their rent dropped, their rent stayed the same, which is part of the problem. And the foot traffic for these businesses went down 99%. And so we did a quadratic funding round for downtown Boulder and we abstracted all the blockchain in the back. It was kind of like a blockchain mullet web, two UX in the front and we were able to fund a quadratic funding round with a comic book shop and a yoga studio and a bookstore and a couple other downtown stores in Boulder. And it was just so cool to see this mechanism that was prototyped in crypto as an ecosystem development tool be used for real world public goods. And it was much more nimble, agile and effective than I think what the local municipal government could put together.
00:29:35.298 - 00:30:06.160, Speaker B: It was also way less administrative overhead and I would love to see that Dow drops and retroactive public goods funding and quadratic funding. More and more people hit Main Street public goods because public goods are good and they're an end in themselves. But I also think crypto has a reputational damage. We shouldn't talk about how crypto is good for the world until it actually is good for the world. And this can be like an export, the national export or like the network state export of crypto can be public goods. At least that's how I would state my vision. I don't know how that jives with you all.
00:30:07.330 - 00:30:08.154, Speaker A: That's sweet.
00:30:08.202 - 00:30:09.200, Speaker D: I like it.
00:30:12.290 - 00:30:26.360, Speaker B: Well, anything else to say about the macro vision? I guess I'll just. Ask the question that I asked ten minutes ago in a world in which you're maximally successful, what does this look like? What is the dent in the universe that this has over the next ten years?
00:30:26.730 - 00:31:26.326, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think the point for me of focusing so intensely on mechanism design for the way money works and the way money flows is actually to bring money into the background. So I think today for so many people, whether you're working in for profit sector, public goods, nonprofit, government, money is so front and center to everything you do. Like both organizations and individuals. You work, you spend and everything's a calculation with money. And so I think the big impact to have is if something like this can run in the background and then just be silently allocating money to all the places where they're needed most, where there's been a lot of impact and there could be more impact if money is sprinkled there. So what we want to do away with like the Ten Year Vision is grant writing is not a thing. Organizations that are doing public good don't have to spend 60% of their time asking for money.
00:31:26.428 - 00:31:26.694, Speaker A: Right?
00:31:26.732 - 00:32:23.318, Speaker E: They can just have kind of automated flows reporting what they do, building in public, social media, et cetera. And then various mechanisms, not one grand mechanism, but various mechanisms that they're in like this Internet of public goods or something like that, are spewing out various kinds of tokens at them and they're automatically kind of like reinvesting them in the places where they needed to go. So I think that's what it is. It's like kind of cybernetic, quietly humming money forest where money is just actually growing on trees but intelligently growing. And so to get more concrete about how dow drops could play a role in that is that I think eventually we don't want to see it be rounds. We would like it to be like a continuous flowing stream. So imagine if there's just this black hole, anyone can throw money into it and then it's just getting spewed out in real time to all these different hundreds of thousands of organizations and individuals.
00:32:23.318 - 00:32:45.220, Speaker E: And as they're doing activity, if they do more public good, the evaluator network starts to point at them and their stream goes up and if they stop doing good, they go mia. Their stream gradually winds down. And so you could think of it as like a UBI for all the different micro activities people are doing that contribute back to various sorts of public good.
00:32:46.070 - 00:33:01.126, Speaker B: Yeah, amen I agree with all that, except I'll use the word intelligently routing value instead of spewing out money would be the way I would frame it.
00:33:01.308 - 00:33:02.422, Speaker A: I like it.
00:33:02.556 - 00:33:35.458, Speaker B: Not to troll you too hard. Sorry. One thing I just wanted to add was it's easy to I'm a systems nerd and I get into all these complex systems, but I just want to collapse it down to the agent level view, which is just like if you can make money for supporting public goods, then you can quit your corporate job, you can quit your sort of private job, and you can just work for the public. And we can pay our mortgage by working for the public. So I just want to collapse that down into the agent level design. Also, that's kind of what I view this as, creating an incentive system for the world.
00:33:35.624 - 00:34:12.566, Speaker E: Totally. And I think something that really upsets me is to see so many of the smartest, hardworking, hardest working people I know spending all of their energy investing it into systems that are not doing good for the world or are actively doing harm to the world. And they're just like, yeah, but that's the only way I can keep making X $1,000 a year. And that's like, what else am I going to do? It's so expensive to live in the city that I like. So if there could be alternatives that say, hey, like you're saying you can quit this corporate job, you can go do stuff that is interesting to you and helps people, that's game changing.
00:34:12.598 - 00:34:14.058, Speaker A: If you can do that at scale.
00:34:14.234 - 00:34:20.590, Speaker B: There's this quote that really slaps hard for me. The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads at Facebook.
00:34:21.810 - 00:34:22.446, Speaker E: Sums it up.
00:34:22.468 - 00:34:30.558, Speaker B: I don't know, it hurts my soul a little bit to hear that. Magenta, it felt like you had something to add and I'm sorry if we veered away from the point you were going to make, but I wanted to.
00:34:30.564 - 00:34:31.534, Speaker E: Give you space to say it.
00:34:31.572 - 00:35:27.730, Speaker D: No, all good. I'm just green and huge. It's so fun to be here and listen and dialogue with you both. What was I going to say? I don't know, it was a while back. But also one thing that comes to mind is in that kind of open, ongoing grant sort of system. I often think this came up in our round too, so it takes a bit of effort to make a Gitcoin grant listing, right? And we have separate listings on Dow Drops and so one thing I'd like to see is more I guess hyperserts is one solution, but also when a project has a profile for public goods funding on these different platforms to not have to create that multiple times. I think my Meta from Metagame is working on a kind of open profile system.
00:35:27.730 - 00:36:18.950, Speaker D: I think they're using ceramic, but something like that could be a potential solution. That just came to my mind in the course of talking about because these systems are so much better, right? Like you can see each other, you can build relationships where in a competitive corporate world or a nonprofit world, you have these closed doors in the corporate context. You get between divisions, between sectors and not a good flow of different types of expertise and industry collaboration on the nonprofit side, there's just totally closed process where you can't see the other people. It takes you three months to write an application and so yeah, just that shared profile of projects or individuals that are, hey, I'm available for public funding would be really helpful and maybe I had another thing but I can't remember. It doesn't matter.
00:36:19.100 - 00:37:09.990, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I know that interop between all these different public goods funding mechanisms is going to be something that is in the Web Three Ethos. So I hope to see someone building a grant aggregator where I can apply to Dow Drops and apply to Clr Fund and apply to giveth and apply to Gitcoin and sync my profiles across all the two. All of them. There's this Xkcd comic though, where there's like eleven different markdown standards is the first panel of the comic and then the next panel is like someone should make a standard, that's all the standards. And then the result is like there's twelve different standards. I worry that that's the world that we're going towards, especially with the modular architecture of L two S and everything on ethereum. But even if the systems can talk to each other and you can transpose between one standard or another, I think that would be a step forward for the space.
00:37:09.990 - 00:37:12.550, Speaker B: So that's another area where I think.
00:37:12.620 - 00:37:16.150, Speaker A: That our visions are aligned.
00:37:17.530 - 00:37:40.670, Speaker E: Yeah, definitely transposing them and just not choosing a winner, just being open to, oh, you can plug in all these different identities and then over time the ones that are just more useful for different areas can just keep being popular. So yeah, I agree, we won't get to a clean, like there's one system for this, one system for that, and they just touch each other. It's definitely going to be a messy road, but it's going to get better progressively.
00:37:41.650 - 00:37:44.522, Speaker A: Yeah, it's all right because that messiness.
00:37:44.586 - 00:39:04.250, Speaker B: And that chaotic sort of coevolution and gene transfer and competition between all these things is how progress happens. I view very much web Three in an evolutionary perspective and I think that there's going to be an opportunity for cross pollination for these mechanisms. What I really want to see is not just like interoperability of grants though, is coordination mechanism interoperability. Like could I take Dowdrop style archpgf and put it on Gitcoin grant stack or Gitcoin grant style quadratic funding and take it to some other grants registry? The interoperability of the mechanisms I think gets really interesting in a world in which all these ecosystems are coordinating. Basically that just allows each community, each holon, whether it's like a Dow or a Layer One or the city of Boulder, to just choose whatever coordination mechanism at once and install it in their community. And that's the world that I'm here for because I don't believe that there's going to be one ultimate coordination mechanism for all of humanity. There's going to be all these different rings and groups of humans that have different values and there's going to be different coordination mechanisms that are best for each of them, or maybe like a top three, where most Dows in 2026 will have quadratic funding and Rpgf and give backs and assurance contracts.
00:39:04.250 - 00:39:13.610, Speaker B: I don't think that there's one coordination mechanism for all coordination out there that pluralism, I think is important as a base principle.
00:39:13.770 - 00:39:14.734, Speaker A: Totally, yeah.
00:39:14.772 - 00:39:22.650, Speaker D: And it supports anti brittleness as well. It's scary if you're just relying on one system, if it goes down or.
00:39:22.740 - 00:39:24.754, Speaker A: Gets corrupt, for sure.
00:39:24.952 - 00:40:14.340, Speaker B: Yeah, tell me about it. Well, I think that we've gone wide, we've gone macro. I want to collapse down to the micro, which is Dowdrops Round One. So by the time I am listening to this in early March, there's going to be at Dowdrops IO, I can go and I'm going to be able to vote in Dowdrops Rpgf round One. If I have been participating in a Dow, if I've been to Event ecosystems, and I have a PO app for it, if I've deployed Smart contracts. And that's the main thing that I want the audience to I want them to participate in that. But is there anything else to say about Round One and the actual mechanics of the flow of the round and the Dow drops experiment itself?
00:40:15.990 - 00:40:45.178, Speaker E: Yeah, so, like everything you just said completely, that's actually the full picture of this next round. There's this next phase of the round, and one thing I just want to put out there is that people should really look at the projects. The web app kind of randomly generates the order, but I think it's important to basically look at the different ideas out there and distribute points according to what you think is fair.
00:40:45.264 - 00:40:45.562, Speaker B: Right.
00:40:45.616 - 00:42:05.970, Speaker E: And so the thing that we're trying to avoid with the design of this, which the curation step and the nomination step were really key parts of, is turning it into a popularity contest. And that's one of the hard things, especially when you're decentralizing to the crowd, is how do you avoid kind of people valuating based on selfish or social grouping kind of metrics? And so, yeah, that's something that we'd love to get feedback on once people go through the experience. And so I would definitely encourage people to talk about their experience publicly, positive or negative or any other way, once they go through and click through it. But, yeah, it's really meant to be fast and people can make small decisions and the idea is that we aggregate all these small decisions, so no one has to be an expert, but everyone who has those points is obviously somewhat knowledgeable in some corner of the ecosystem. And then once you allocate all your points, you just click button and it's going to generate a message to sign. And so it's no gas, because all of the scoring kind of just gets aggregated by the app and then the money gets dropped all at once. And that way that was also like a design concept to increase participation as much as possible, to not have the complexity of gas on L One or some sort of choosing which L2 to go on.
00:42:05.970 - 00:42:23.930, Speaker E: And so in future rounds, definitely the idea is to bring more on chain, abstract away gas as much as possible. But for this one, we thought it'd be easiest for everyone if it's like, hey, just sign in, take two minutes, ten minutes, 20 minutes of your day to be a small part of making this decision.
00:42:26.190 - 00:42:26.986, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:27.168 - 00:43:03.750, Speaker D: The only other piece I would mention is and this is for the next round, but it may occur to you as you're playing with the app, we're looking for more data providers to, again, iterate on and improve the algorithm or what on chain data we pull and why. And then also sponsors for the next round so that there's a diversity of people contributing funds into the next one. So data providers and sponsors or financial contributors are two things that we're looking for as we go into the developing the next round.
00:43:05.290 - 00:43:08.200, Speaker A: Amazing. Yeah.
00:43:08.730 - 00:43:24.234, Speaker B: If you're interested, I'm no longer at Gitcoin, I'm just affiliated because it's like a Dow and everything, but I could introduce you to the people who are working on data science within Gitcoin. I think that you all might have some similar problems to solve.
00:43:24.362 - 00:43:25.390, Speaker D: That'd be amazing.
00:43:25.540 - 00:43:26.560, Speaker A: That could be cool.
00:43:27.410 - 00:43:31.040, Speaker B: Well, we've got five minutes left. Is there anything I didn't ask that you all want to say?
00:43:31.890 - 00:43:42.980, Speaker D: I just want to hang out for a weekend and talk about regional regeneration and nerd out on all these things, but also make them happen.
00:43:43.830 - 00:44:44.374, Speaker B: Yeah, that's how I feel. Also, so early on, when I was still at Gitcoin, we used to think about interop with other projects as social interop. And then you would do like, technology interop, which is like our systems integrate with each other, and then economic interop, which is to the extent that any of us is generating revenue, like sharing that with each other. And you start with social interop. And so one of the things that's been really important for me over time and it's the reason why Gitcoin hosts Shelling Point. And we had a conference in 2020 called Sustain web Three is like, convening the people. And once you convene the smart people who are well intentioned and have the resources and hopefully like a pluralism of a diverse group of people, not just like the same old representation that I think that we've seen too often is that once you create that container for the social stuff like the economic and the technological interop and the momentum flows from there.
00:44:44.374 - 00:45:37.654, Speaker B: And that's why I started this podcast, is to try to stimulate that movement and that action. So the Green Pill podcast is one way to do it. Shelling Point at ETH Denver is coming up and that's like our regen web3 conference there's funding the Commons and yeah, it'd be great to see Dow Drops integrated into all the regen web3 refi ecosystem. Regens unite is another one. There's a bunch of great people who are working to stimulate this movement, and I'll just end by saying that I want to live in a world where we're rotating capital, talent, and attention towards regen web3. Like, away from the pump and dumps and the ponzies into regen web3, of which public goods funding is a big part of it. So I think we'll keep doing experiments and having the conversation and trying to meme that world into existence and that's what I'm trying to do.
00:45:37.654 - 00:45:47.340, Speaker B: And I'm glad to be at the dance with you all. So thank you for dow drops. It's really exciting for me and I can't wait to see what you all learn from round one.
00:45:48.430 - 00:45:48.794, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:48.832 - 00:45:51.630, Speaker B: Any response to that rant or anything else you want to say before we wrap?
00:45:52.770 - 00:46:51.354, Speaker E: Definitely second everything you said. I think the community that we're building here is really important and keeping that pluralistic and diverse because we don't want to make mistakes in having tunnel vision around particular ideas that come from a particular subset of the population. And so that's why I think the regen branch of crypto has been really great for kind of bringing the pluralistic nature, because I think DeFi and NFT land and scared away a lot of the people who are excited about decentralized governance. At first, it kind of washed out a lot of those people because it got so loud, but now that's gotten quieter, kind of thankfully, to the bear market and so now the regen thing can flourish. And I've seen this in person also at Regions Unite and going to go to the Crypto Commons hub soon and check out more of these events in person, funding the Commons in Paris at the summer.
00:46:51.482 - 00:47:03.074, Speaker B: Yeah, some of these I work full time in this space. I wasn't even aware of some of those. So we should compile a list of all the different totally circles of regions that you can join. And what I really want to do.
00:47:03.112 - 00:47:05.838, Speaker A: Is if we can route the newbies.
00:47:05.934 - 00:47:28.490, Speaker B: To the next market cycle, if we can route the new entrants to the ecosystem, to regen web3 and around all the ponzi's and the pump and dumps and straight into those communities, man, that's a puck and public good for the space in itself. So it legitimizes crypto, but it also routes the capital attention to where it really matters. So yeah, maybe that's something we could start collaborating on.
00:47:28.640 - 00:47:29.434, Speaker A: Totally, yeah.
00:47:29.472 - 00:47:32.490, Speaker E: How people first come into contact with the space is so crucial.
00:47:32.570 - 00:47:33.600, Speaker A: Sorry, go ahead.
00:47:34.610 - 00:48:32.880, Speaker D: The only other thing I'd add listening to that is the importance of foregrounding grassroots participation in refi. It's still very missing from the, for example, carbon focus or the technology first focus and then also feminine leadership I still find even Refi is very bro y, like culture wise, and I don't know how to articulate it exactly, but there's missing of the feminine ways of organizing and creating a technological business container. There's a lot of possibility there that I think is not as loud as it could be across the space. So that grassroots and women voices in Refi specifically, I think more of that will be nutritive in a very good way.
00:48:33.810 - 00:49:09.180, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think that a criticism of the space that's totally valid is that it's got a lot of overlap with people who are privileged enough to have computer science degrees. And if it looks more like the Global South and the actual communities that it serves, then I think that there's, like, a symmetry there that gets really nice and doing it across a bunch of vectors, not just like gender and race and geography, but many different types of collective or intelligences that pluralism, I think, is an important vector of pluralism as well.
00:49:12.600 - 00:49:13.060, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:13.130 - 00:49:37.640, Speaker B: Well, I really enjoyed this episode. I'm so thrilled about Dow Drops, and as someone who's been working on public goods for a few years, welcome to the party. Really excited to have you and can't wait to see how Dow Drops evolves over the next several years. So Ori Magenta, thank you so much for joining me on the Green Pill pod. Don't.
