00:00:17.200 - 00:01:05.204, Speaker A: Hi everyone, this is Defi dad and this is another bankless tutorial. Today I'm going to walk you through how to use the dharma wallet to beat the high gas prices and trade with Uniswap thanks to the subsidized fees provided by the Dharma team. So trading fees and gas fees are essentially being subsidized. The rates can vary just because dharma is trying to account for slippage to ensure that trades go through. And so the rate that you pay is often a little bit higher than what you would pay on uniswap. But end of day, there's huge net savings in using the dharma wallet with uniswap. So I'm going to show you how to trade from ether to another ERC 20 token.
00:01:05.204 - 00:02:02.656, Speaker A: Like lend. I'm going to show you how to trade from an ERC 20 token to ether. I also have the option of trading from die to another ERC 20 token or ether. Or I can trade from another ERC 20 token back to die or ether. You will soon be able to do trades like this where I go from an ERC 20 token to ERC 20 token, but for right now it's not available. It's just because the dharma team is working to ensure that they can properly represent all of the rates and ensure that these trades go through even when gas prices are sky high. In order for me to take advantage of these subsidized gas and trading fees on Uniswap using the Dharma wallet, I've got to get money into my Dharma wallet first.
00:02:02.656 - 00:02:56.332, Speaker A: So you'll notice there's a deposit button there. If I just click that, this is what enables me to then deposit into my wallet. So that's my public address. It's similar to the email address anyone would use, but it's to enable someone to send money to me in my wallet. So if I have money in my metamask wallet, if I have money in my argent wallet, I want to copy this address below, which use the little share button and it'll allow you to copy the entire address. If folks are using something like Coinbase or finance, you can take this address and you can withdraw your money from the exchange, whether it's ether, die, or another ERC 20 token. One last note on this I want to make sure that I am dealing with an Ethereum based token.
00:02:56.332 - 00:03:29.084, Speaker A: I cannot deposit any token into this wallet. This is only for Ethereum. So that means tokens like ether, like dai, like lend, like SNX. It has to be an Ethereum based token. And if I'm unsure of that. I need to go do some homework, go to someone like Coingecko and check to see whether or not this is an Ethereum based token. Another way for me to get my money into this wallet is to deposit fiat so I could choose the debit card option if I'm based in the United States.
00:03:29.084 - 00:04:33.244, Speaker A: If I'm not, then I don't need to worry about this and I'm strictly going to use the Dharma wallet as a crypto wallet without a fiat on ramp or off ramp, at least for now. So if I'm using my debit card here, I could say let's deposit $10. Now, notice that when I deposit money, us dollars specifically into my dharma wallet using my debit card, it is not withdrawable for up to 14 days. It is available for me to trade immediately, which is, I think, a huge convenience to be able to use that money immediately to trade from dai into one of the other ERC 20 tokens, or even into ether. And best of all, I don't pay any fees to deposit my fiat. The third way for me to get money into my dharma wallet is starting with a centralized exchange. So this is traditionally, I think, where many of us deposit fiat to convert into something like ether or dai or USDC or some other Ethereum based token.
00:04:33.244 - 00:05:25.852, Speaker A: So I'm going to use Coinbase as an example. I'm going to choose portfolio and then I'll click on coin. Although USDC has lots of drawbacks to consider, namely the fact that it is a stable coin with centralized risk that allows the team that backs USDC to go in and freeze USDC in an Ethereum wallet. Although that is reality, I also recognize that it's a very liquid stable coin and it's redeemable for a dollar with Coinbase. So this is a really common on ramp and off ramp to get fiat into the system as an ERC 20 token and then send that to an Ethereum wallet and then be able to trade into other tokens that don't have that centralized risk. So I'm going to use this as an example. I could otherwise buy something like ether or Dai.
00:05:25.852 - 00:06:36.840, Speaker A: What I can do here then is buy USDC with dollars. And what I want to be mindful of is many people will go to Coinbase and they'll buy with a debit card or a bank account, and you'll notice you end up paying fees. And these fees can really add up. I mean, three or dollars, four might not be a lot to someone, but it's the point of paying that percentage away, even on $1,000, you're going to end up paying a lot more money, $38 on $1,000. So the trick to this is you don't buy with a debit card, and that way I will just get $1,000 of USDC and I won't have to pay the same fees and then send that USDC onto my Ethereum wallets. Another way to get to USDC is if you have a Coinbase account, you have access to their Coinbase pro. And once you get there, if you click on portfolio deposit, you have this option then of going and depositing fiat directly into your account.
00:06:36.840 - 00:07:19.460, Speaker A: So if you do that, you would then deposit, let's say in my case, us dollars from a bank account. Once those us dollars hit my bank account after, let's say, three to five days, then I can actually convert that to USDC. So you notice I'm starting with USD here. I think I have like $0.06 in this account, and then I can convert it to USDC and you can go backwards as well. So it's pretty cool. I think this is, again, one of the reasons that USDC is a popular stablecoin, despite the huge drawbacks to it and the centralized risk that I think everyone should be mindful of and actually work to avoid.
00:07:19.460 - 00:08:09.392, Speaker A: So let's assume that I've deposited fiat into my Coinbase or other exchange account. And then let's also assume that I've either bought USDC or I've converted USDC using Coinbase Pro, that converter that's in the portfolio tools. And now I've got USDC. Now I can click on send, which is available in Coinbase Pro or in this more like retail friendly version of Coinbase, and I can then choose to send USDC. There we go. Let's pretend I'm sending 100 of this. Where am I going to send that? I'm going to send it to the zero x address that is in my dharma wallet, just like any other ethereum wallet.
00:08:09.392 - 00:08:44.032, Speaker A: That is the public Ethereum wallet address, the zero x, whatever the heck the rest of it is. That's what I'm going to use to send my USDC back to my dharma wallet. I click deposit and then it's the zero x five fb number. And so I can copy that. And then I can go ahead and paste that into my coinbase account to make sure that I'm sending that USDC to this dharma wallet. So we'll go ahead and paste in that address and we're good to go there. I don't need a note here.
00:08:44.032 - 00:09:21.500, Speaker A: This is just something that's convenient. And then I would go ahead and hit send. One thing I'm not showing here, just because I don't really use Coinbase anymore, is when you do hit send, if you have actual money in your account, it'll take you to a preview screen and then it'll show you whether or not this address is real. It normally shows like a little green check mark. Look for that. Make sure that this is a legit address because it's very possible that someone could copy that address. And then let's say that they delete a digit, or let's pretend that they just copy the wrong address.
00:09:21.500 - 00:10:31.294, Speaker A: That isn't a real address. You just want to be really careful so that once I paste that in, I want to check the first several letters and numbers and those at the very end to make sure that I've got the entire address. Whether I have deposited my fiat into Dai using the dharma wallet's deposit options through the debit card or Apple Pay, or I've deposited crypto into my dharma wallet from something like a coinbase or another ethereum wallet, I'm now ready to trade so I can confirm any of those incoming deposits or transactions by clicking over to the right here and you can see a history of my transactions. So here's me depositing $10 earlier. And then if I scroll to the left. Or I could just click here at the very bottom of the screen on the little arrows that represent an exchange. This is where I can do my uniswap trading using the current version of the dharma wallet.
00:10:31.294 - 00:10:59.910, Speaker A: I have a few options in terms of how I trade. Now I'm going to go ahead and flip it here and start with die. I can trade between dai and any ERC 20 token. I can trade between ether and any ERC 20 token, including die. And then I can trade the reverse of that. I could start with an ERC 20 token, but I can only trade into ether or die. This is a limitation for now.
00:10:59.910 - 00:11:48.586, Speaker A: While this is still a rather new product, and they're trying to ensure that all of these trades can be executed with the right amount of gas and that they're showcasing the correct swap rates from Uniswap. Another thing to be mindful of is notice that it says die under dharma verified. And then under that it says unverified. I would be very cautious to use any token that is not dharma verified. There are lots of fake tokens that are being listed on Uniswap that's because it's permissionless to list a token. If I go and create a fake token called the defi dad dai, I can go on and then list it in uniswap just by providing that liquidity. So let's go ahead and do a trade.
00:11:48.586 - 00:12:30.650, Speaker A: I'm going to go ahead and start with the die tokens that I have and I'm going to trade these for. I could go to ETH, but just to kind of showcase the power of being able to trade from dai or ether into another ERC 20 token, let's choose something else. So we'll do lend. By the way, notice that I've got the ETH lend token. And then what's spelled similarly is the tendies token. But I'm going to choose the ETH lend token. And then let's go ahead and trade tendai for some lend.
00:12:30.650 - 00:12:54.962, Speaker A: So now I'm going to preview the swap. Oh, and there you go. So trade amount minimum is $20. All right, just learned something. Probably has something to do with the amount of gas it takes just to push through a transaction. And then let's go and hit preview swap. So you can see that I'm going to pay 20 die for about 52.3
00:12:54.962 - 00:13:22.710, Speaker A: lend and I'm going to not pay any gas or trading fees. But the conversion rate is 2.6 117 lend per die. Let's go check on uniswap what the difference is. So it looks like for 20 die, I'm going to get 53.58 lend versus the now 52.46 lend on the Dharma wallet.
00:13:22.710 - 00:14:00.386, Speaker A: So there is a small difference. But I would argue that the gas that I would pay for this transaction is probably about $10, minimally. So that's a lot of money saved when I'm using the Dharma wallet. Just be mindful that what I showed you a few minutes ago has already changed because the pricing in these pools is dynamic and they're constantly changing in uniswap. Here's what I'm saving on. I'm not paying that exorbitant gas fee that I'm going to pay. While the gas price today is around 150 gwe, I'm not paying a trading fee to dharma.
00:14:00.386 - 00:14:33.700, Speaker A: And I normally would have to work through two transactions with Uniswap in Dharma, I'm just going to click the confirm button. It's a single click transaction. So let's go ahead and try it. All right, so my trade went through. Awesome. And I think the key takeaway here is I didn't pay those exorbitant gas and trading fees. I mean, I easily saved at least ten dollars to fifteen dollars in gas, which is insane to pay those gas fees to do small trades like this.
00:14:33.700 - 00:15:28.730, Speaker A: I recognize that one of the solutions right now to these high gas prices is that if you aren't trading a larger position and your gas is going to cost that much of a percentage of your swap, you probably shouldn't be doing the swap. That's not the answer, though, that most want to hear. And I think a lot about newcomers to DFI. So this is a really easy way to get around these high gas prices. So if we go back to the swap, you can see now that I have 29 die available. So I'm down 20 die from where I started at 59 die. And if we were to go and flip that, I now have 51 len that I could trade back to die, or I could trade that to something like ether, and then if I hit preview, it'll show me what the trade will look like.
00:15:28.730 - 00:16:26.592, Speaker A: So that's all there is to it. That's how Dharma is saving me lots of money in terms of fees, and I would encourage anyone to check it out. There's no reason to be paying high gas prices when there are other ways around that with trading. All right, so just a few risks to call out. First off, if you use the Dharma wallet, and if you use the deposit option with a debit or Apple Pay, you're going to end up giving up some personal information. Normally, I just use products where I don't have to give up any sort of information, like metamask. However, getting fiat into the system, no matter whether you go through a centralized exchange or through a defi product that has a fiat on ramp, there's no way around it, at least for me in the United States.
00:16:26.592 - 00:17:30.368, Speaker A: So this is a great product for me to be able to easily deposit as much money as I need and be able to do it for free. The second risk is just making a mistake, sending crypto, namely an ethereum token, to my wallet and screwing up this zero x address. I want to be really careful that I copy that by using the share option there and copying that very long hexadecimal address. If I leave just one letter or number out, my funds are lost forever. Another human error that could occur with this is sending a non ethereum token to the Dharma wallet. If I try to withdraw my money from an exchange and it's a non ethereum token, like the binance token, or if you use a wallet like the trust wallet or Coinbase wallet. They both support Ethereum tokens, but they also have other tokens that are on other blockchains.
00:17:30.368 - 00:18:17.290, Speaker A: And I just want to make sure that I don't send something like bitcoin or something like the binance token or any of the other non Ethereum tokens. Another major risk that I think about is loss of my account. So this could happen by uninstalling a browser, deleting my browser's data, or losing a device like my phone or my laptop. And so the way to get around this is I want to add a new device, which is something like an iPhone or whatever phone you use or something in the chrome browser. So the way I would do that is I click add new device and I'm not going to show you it because otherwise it would expose my own wallet. But you get the idea. This is one of the few ways that you can really protect yourself.
00:18:17.290 - 00:18:31.030, Speaker A: Okay, that's all I've got for you today. I hope you find this helpful. Let us know if you have any questions in the YouTube comments or on Twitter. You can also reach us in the bankless discord group and otherwise, I will see you next time.
