00:00:00.170 - 00:00:21.120, Speaker A: The BNB chain was halted, halted after a billion dollar hack. Bankless nation. Happy second Friday of October. It is roll up time. It's also a special Devcon roll up. David, you are hanging out in Bogota, Columbia, at Devcon this week. How's it going, man?
00:00:21.570 - 00:00:44.650, Speaker B: Really good, man. Bogota is a ton of fun, and Devcon is just going absolutely fantastically. There's so much energy here at Devcon, and it does kind of feel like the last bonfire of energy in this bear market in the crypto space. But everyone is just really excited to be at Devcon. The talks and content is just very rich. People are stoked, man. People are really stoked to be here.
00:00:44.800 - 00:01:00.702, Speaker A: David, Devcon is an Ethereum specific conference, or is it wider than that? And then this is the first time it's been in person in a while because of COVID and everything else, right? So this is the first time the entire Ethereum community is theirs. Give us a sense of the vibe and what Defcon actually.
00:01:00.836 - 00:01:38.490, Speaker B: Yeah, Defcon is, I would say, like the foundation of much of the rest of global conferences. Well, it's not only actually anymore, but it is the conference thrown by the Ethereum foundation. So yes, it is ethereum specific. In years previous, however, there has been many other exposures to other chains. EOs and Ethereum classic famously had a significant presence and algorithm has significant presence at. When was it, Osaka, which was the last devcon that happened in 2019. There has not been a Devcon 2019, right? There has not been a Devcon in three years.
00:01:38.490 - 00:02:12.342, Speaker B: And it's actually made this devcon many, many people's first devcon, including myself, which many people are surprised, like, oh, David, you've been in crypto forever. This is your first devcon. Yeah. And many other people have also not been able to go to the Devcons prior. I remember Devcon 2018 in Prague. I had just gotten into crypto, and I couldn't convince my company to send this person that they just hired all the way to Prague to go to Devcon. And then 2019 was Osaka and kind of the same deal.
00:02:12.342 - 00:02:44.720, Speaker B: If soccer was going to be a $4,000 trip and ether was like $100, I was like, I really want to go, but I'd have to sell some east. I'd have to not buy some ease. And so this is my and many others, first Devcon. And Ethereum as an ecosystem is just completely different from last Devcon. Last Devcon was 2019 at like one to $200 ether. And there was no Defi, very little DFI, absolutely no layer no, L2s. Plasma was our scaling solution at the time.
00:02:44.720 - 00:03:12.090, Speaker B: Yeah, right. And so it's just a fundamentally different Devcon. And they made this really cool video. I'm going to see if I can get the video from the EF and just do something with it. But they made this really cool intro video and man, I got goosebumps, dude, of just like the road to Devcon and what it took to get here, going through ETH, dev, connect, the merge, Eip. It was like a speedrun of the last three years of ethereum history in this really cool animated promotion video. It was really, really cool.
00:03:12.160 - 00:03:25.678, Speaker A: And I know this is Ethereum community, Ethereum ecosystem, and it's heavily like Dev. The dev. And Devcon stands for developers. So it's a heavily developer centric kind of conference. How many people are there? We're in the thousands, right?
00:03:25.764 - 00:03:35.600, Speaker B: Oh, in the many, many thousands. I don't know. Numbers. So I'm going to spitball here. I think something like eight to 10,000 people.
00:03:36.210 - 00:03:37.922, Speaker A: Maybe don't quote David on that.
00:03:37.976 - 00:03:39.330, Speaker B: Maybe less than that.
00:03:39.400 - 00:03:40.322, Speaker A: Five to 10,000?
00:03:40.376 - 00:04:11.450, Speaker B: How about definitely 5000? 5000 feels definitely 5000. Yeah, I'm going to go with like 8000 ish. And you're totally right. I was talking to people about this at Defcon. It's not even like application layer stuff. There's not many DFI apps or nfts conversations at all. The conversations are the Ethereum protocol, EIP 4844, account abstraction, post merge stuff, L2s, staking infrastructure.
00:04:11.450 - 00:04:22.240, Speaker B: We are deep in the protocol. Deep in the protocol stack. The focus of this conference is below the application layer. So not even DeFi apps have exposure here.
00:04:23.110 - 00:04:25.598, Speaker A: Are you seeing any suits? Any suits and ties?
00:04:25.694 - 00:04:26.302, Speaker B: No suits.
00:04:26.366 - 00:04:40.498, Speaker A: No suits as it should be. Sorry, all you suit wearing, dapper gentlemen and gentle ladies, it's nice to just kind of chill and be with the developers and kind of wearing whatever is comfortable.
00:04:40.674 - 00:04:42.210, Speaker B: You know what's also been fun, Ryan?
00:04:42.290 - 00:04:42.678, Speaker A: What?
00:04:42.764 - 00:04:54.038, Speaker B: I don't think you know this. No, I. Mute. Quesepa esso hablar unpoco espanol. See? So estar ablando espanol aqui in Colombia. So it's been a little bit of fun. I've been practicing.
00:04:54.134 - 00:04:58.730, Speaker A: Wow. Well done. How is it holding up? How's your Spanish holding up for the native?
00:04:59.390 - 00:05:09.710, Speaker B: Yo vive in Guatemala, parados mesis. Yo vive in Argentina, parados jmanas. So I've been shaking off some rust, but it's been good.
00:05:09.780 - 00:05:25.170, Speaker A: That sounds impressive, actually. Bankless nation rate. David. Spanish right now in the comments, tell him how he did, but you got to appreciate the effort. Right. That was great, David. Well, anyway, we got a lot of topics to cover this week.
00:05:25.170 - 00:05:31.638, Speaker A: The first is, of course, Devcon. What's going on? There have been a slew of announcements coming out of Devcon that we got to talk about.
00:05:31.724 - 00:05:36.278, Speaker B: Also, big announcements. Big announcements that people are super surprised by. Yeah. So we're going to cover that.
00:05:36.364 - 00:05:44.570, Speaker A: Also, we have the BNB chain that was halted after a billion dollar hack. David, are chains supposed to halt?
00:05:46.110 - 00:05:50.134, Speaker B: Not the Ethereum chain, but we'll talk about whether it's appropriate for other chains.
00:05:50.262 - 00:06:07.146, Speaker A: And finally, we've got the ultimate showdown, I think. David Hoffman versus Janet Yellen. Yes. David Hoffman from the Banks podcast. We're going to talk about that. All right. David has been named as a co plaintiff in a case against treasury, but it's not a bad thing.
00:06:07.146 - 00:06:17.586, Speaker A: It sounds like a bad thing, actually, but it's actually a really good thing. We'll get into that. And of course, as always, make sure you, like, subscribe and review wherever you're watching this, wherever you are listening to.
00:06:17.608 - 00:06:23.270, Speaker B: It with your morning coffee. Here's my with your morning espresso with zero sugar or milk. Yeah.
00:06:23.340 - 00:06:26.550, Speaker A: Oh, that's amazing. I bet the coffee in Columbia is pretty tasty, right?
00:06:26.620 - 00:06:27.960, Speaker B: It's pretty decent, yeah.
00:06:28.410 - 00:06:42.734, Speaker A: All right, well, before we get in, I want to talk about our friends and sponsors at Galaxy. They want to invite you on a DFI crypto adventure. It's adventure time in crypto. David, what is Galaxy? What are these guys up to?
00:06:42.852 - 00:07:28.550, Speaker B: Galaxy is your digital passport for exploring the metaverse, exploring web3. They have a bunch of quests and tasks and things to go do in the world of crypto. And once you go do those things, you get to log a little badge, a little gym badge, a little credential in your web3 passport given to you by galaxy. So they are producing little things for you to go do, go and explore the frontiers, if you will, to go and get some tasks done. And then you get to show the world that you did those tasks, that you are an actual frontier explorer and surface area for other opportunities, if you will. And so there is a link in the show notes to go get your web3 passport from galaxy, and you can start exploring different parts, different optimism. Arbitrum.
00:07:28.550 - 00:07:37.418, Speaker B: Wherever people want you to go explore, you can get paid to explore or at least get a badge, sort of like a po op, to go and explore the metaverse.
00:07:37.594 - 00:07:55.334, Speaker A: Yeah. Some of these campaigns, as it were, they have rewards on the other side. So if you are a gold hunter, you can go check out those rewards. Also, that passport you're mentioning, David, that's actually a soul bound token, which is pretty neat. I love these experiments with identity on chain. Using a soul bound token for this.
00:07:55.372 - 00:07:58.920, Speaker B: So go check out don't trigger Evan McMullen too hard.
00:07:59.690 - 00:08:13.770, Speaker A: Just a little hard. It's fine. That's galaxy.com passport. To get to that, galxe.com is the URL. So Galaxy spelled G a l x e.
00:08:13.770 - 00:08:18.154, Speaker A: David, let's get to markets. Bitcoin this week. How are we doing?
00:08:18.352 - 00:08:28.826, Speaker B: It's down. It's down a solid 9%. So start of the week at 20,200, ending the week at 18,400. Oof, oof, oof.
00:08:29.018 - 00:08:32.558, Speaker A: Down week. Sad music okay, how about ETH? Down as well?
00:08:32.644 - 00:08:40.754, Speaker B: Yeah, down a little bit more. Down ten and a half percent. Start of the week at 1370, ending the week where we are now at 1240, 1220 ish, give or take.
00:08:40.872 - 00:08:46.434, Speaker A: David, do you think we're going to dip on ETH below 1000 again? Triple digit E?
00:08:46.472 - 00:08:49.686, Speaker B: It's certainly in the cards. It's certainly in the cards for sure.
00:08:49.708 - 00:08:56.854, Speaker A: It's certainly in the cards. Not going to say no. Not going to say yes. I'm veering towards yes on that doing off.
00:08:56.892 - 00:09:07.530, Speaker B: I mean, if we roll back at the last bear market, we hit $80 and then we hit like $92 and then we hit like $95 across like 18 months of time.
00:09:07.680 - 00:09:11.482, Speaker A: What's our low right now on ETH? I think it's like 800.
00:09:11.536 - 00:09:13.422, Speaker B: 870? Yeah.
00:09:13.476 - 00:09:14.142, Speaker A: And that was a quick.
00:09:14.196 - 00:09:19.840, Speaker B: And your boy bought 897. So that is the best bottom tick I have ever done.
00:09:20.530 - 00:09:24.894, Speaker A: All right, so David timed the market really well at that time, but maybe.
00:09:24.932 - 00:09:26.482, Speaker B: We'Ll know that for now.
00:09:26.536 - 00:09:31.700, Speaker A: For now, I can't wait to beat David and buy 800. And what'd you buy?
00:09:32.550 - 00:09:33.906, Speaker B: Shush. Get out of here.
00:09:33.928 - 00:09:36.260, Speaker A: What'd you buy? 800. I'll do 890.
00:09:36.870 - 00:09:41.640, Speaker B: You're going to set your limit orders for 896? Yeah. Yes, I'm going to set my limit orders for 895.
00:09:42.650 - 00:09:45.510, Speaker A: And on we go. And this is how we end up with no cash.
00:09:45.660 - 00:09:47.510, Speaker B: This is how you get price discovery.
00:09:47.930 - 00:10:09.870, Speaker A: I guess we're laughing about this, but it is a pretty steep bear market. I mean, at these prices, we are below the all time high of the last cycle, which was like 1440, something like that. So we'll talk about why this might be the case. It's all screaming macro to me. How about the ETH to bitcoin ratio. We down on that, too?
00:10:09.940 - 00:10:13.780, Speaker B: Yeah, down a little bit. 2.5%, down to zero point 63.
00:10:14.550 - 00:10:17.950, Speaker A: And how's the crypto market cap holding up overall?
00:10:18.110 - 00:10:27.026, Speaker B: No longer being measured in the trillions. We are now at $934,000,000,000. So well below $1 trillion market cap.
00:10:27.128 - 00:10:28.462, Speaker A: We lost our T status.
00:10:28.526 - 00:10:29.830, Speaker B: We back to the bees.
00:10:30.810 - 00:10:58.878, Speaker A: All right, well, let's talk about macro. Okay. Because this is the cause. Why is this all happening? Yeah, why is this happening to us? Why us right now? Of course, crypto goes in cycles, but I think one of the catalysts and the things that are preventing some of the crypto markets from rising again is uncertainty in macro. And, boy, there's a lot of uncertainty these days. The big news this week was the CPI number. That is the September inflation report just came out.
00:10:58.878 - 00:11:22.278, Speaker A: And, David, the numbers are higher than expectations. The CPI consumer price index rose 8.2% in the year that is annualized through September. I think expectations were hoping for 8.08.1. So a little bit higher on that. And we're still in the eight range, David, so not good. I guess.
00:11:22.278 - 00:11:49.674, Speaker A: Just to recap, in August, we were CPI of 8.3%. That's annualized, of course, in July, 8.5%. In June, 9.1%. So from June to September, from an annualized perspective, we went from 9.1% to 8.2. So we're still down, but we're not down as much as some analysts. And I think the market was hoping for and expecting.
00:11:49.674 - 00:12:13.080, Speaker A: And so do you know what this means, David Powell? Go down, numbers go down. And also Powell wants one number to go up, which is the interest rate. And so the next Fed meeting is November 2. The market's anticipating another zero point 75 basis point hike. So that is definitely coming down the pike for.
00:12:15.130 - 00:12:22.006, Speaker B: Mean. This is just simply like, rate hikes will continue until inflation comes down. Right. So this is like pretty, the beatings.
00:12:22.038 - 00:13:07.014, Speaker A: Will continue until morale improves. And so we've got some more beatings to go through from the Fed. It's an interesting question, I think a question that we want to bring some macro folks here to answer on bankless, which is like, is this actually effective? Can you break the back of inflation by raising rates? I mean, the story, the narrative keeps going back to Volcker, the fed chair of the 1980s, who allegedly broke the back of inflation. Is that really what did it? Were conditions different? Are there other factors at play? I would love to get in a conversation with somebody on the macro side. About whether this strategy is actually effective. But in the meanwhile, David, you could see the sell off, the sell off.
00:13:07.052 - 00:13:18.426, Speaker B: Event, when those are some large down candles. This is the S and P 500, gold, bitcoin and euro all just tanking in a single candle as soon as this report came out.
00:13:18.528 - 00:13:18.890, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:13:18.960 - 00:13:26.126, Speaker B: Global correlation. Yeah, this is one of those moments where, like, correlations all go to one when times are bad. That's exactly what this looks like.
00:13:26.228 - 00:13:58.582, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what's happening. But I will tell you one thing which is kind of interesting, is how crypto is faring relative to traditional markets. Here's kind of one stat. So after the CPI numbers came in, the US 30 year bonds were down 2.5%, as you might expect. So bonds go down, but also ETH was down 2.5%. It was interesting, like the risky asset, you'd expect ETH to go down by 2.5%
00:13:58.582 - 00:14:20.318, Speaker A: or a lot more. It was down the same amount as bonds. Bonds are supposed to be the stable asset and they're not performing as the stable asset in this market. So I start to wonder if we'll have crypto markets bottomed. Is prices and some of the volatility shifting to more of the traditional markets? That could be what's happening.
00:14:20.484 - 00:14:51.018, Speaker B: My take here is that the hot air has already left the crypto industry. And so when macro goes down, we're also going to go down with it, but we're not going to go down in an outsized way. We went down in an outsized way from January to May of 2022, and then everyone got liquidated. And now we've kind of found some sort of floor ish. And as that floor lowers because of macro, we will follow that floor down, but we're not going to puncture through that floor in the same way that we did in the first half of this year. That's my take.
00:14:51.184 - 00:14:58.726, Speaker A: I largely agree with that. I think crypto already took its lickings and got beaten down, and now traditional markets are taking theirs.
00:14:58.758 - 00:15:17.586, Speaker B: This is, people are underappreciating the fact that we do not have another 3 hours capital leverage event, and maybe we do because you don't really know if you have one of those or not. So it's kind of impossible to claim. But I don't know, man, if it would have happened last time, we already did that. I can't imagine there's a second one.
00:15:17.688 - 00:15:49.638, Speaker A: The things that are still standing are now on much more firm, solid foundation. This is a tweet from zero hedge. The Fed finally did it they broke the market. The Dow Jones, which is, of course, the 30 largest industrial stocks on the planet, is now officially more volatile than crypto. This is a volatility index of Dow Jones and crypto versus US dollars. And so the stock market now performing with more volatility than crypto. That lends a bit more credibility to what you just said, I think, David.
00:15:49.638 - 00:15:49.946, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:49.968 - 00:16:44.010, Speaker B: And this is a theme that I have been trying to just get into people's heads because I think it's the right theme. And I've said this in a number of different capacities where crypto is becoming more and more suitable for mainstream, while the mainstream world is needing crypto more and more and more. And this is related to our web two versus web3 apps like Facebook, algorithms, rage, algorithms are pushing us into like, oh, I kind of understand why we need web3 a little bit better. There's an adoption story here. The other time I've articulated this is that the normal world is getting more chaotic as crypto is becoming more stable. This is me taking a victory lap, Ryan, when the Dow Jones is more volatile than bitcoin, the old world is getting more chaotic and crypto is getting more stable. And this is going to be one of the great, it's like the Benjamin Button, like meme, like we were crossing and now crypto would be a stable.
00:16:44.510 - 00:17:31.286, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I totally agree with that. And I think what you're saying is the victory lap is not that you're happy that Dow Jones is going down, but you're kind of saying, like you predicted, that all the naysayers who said, look, crypto is too volatile for mainstream. We've long said, people in crypto have long said, just wait, the whole world's getting more volatile, and that volatility is coming to you as well. And crypto is just a bit more of an honest market in terms of pricing that in early. And I think that is exactly what's happening. This is another tweet from Jim Bianco. He says this, the early 2020 pre pandemic peak in the S and P 500 was 3393, as I write, and he's writing October 13.
00:17:31.286 - 00:17:56.546, Speaker A: So this is on a Thursday. As I write. The S and P 500 is 3493, 100 points away from erasing the entire post pandemic bull market. We just erased that entire pandemic bull market. All of the money printing that went to stocks, it's gone. Now we're back to where we were in early 2020. That's pretty astounding when you think about it.
00:17:56.568 - 00:18:10.570, Speaker B: That way. Yeah, that is quite astounding. And it's also worth noting that in early 2020 ether was $100 and bitcoin was like $4,000 or $5,000. And so crypto has made significant strides in the same time that the legacy markets has just gone full circle.
00:18:10.990 - 00:18:44.094, Speaker A: Yes. And despite it, of course, if we're looking at now the speed of the US interest hikes, look at this 2022, the fastest speed at which the Fed has ever increased interest hikes, at least ever in kind of like modern history, it seems like. So they are on a tear to increase interest rates and no signs of stopping yet. We'll see if something breaks before they do, David. Meanwhile, on the crypto monetary policy side of things, ETH went ultrasound last week. Talk about that for a minute.
00:18:44.222 - 00:19:15.354, Speaker B: Yeah. So last week since the merge, we had issued 13,000 ether, about 13 and a half thousand ether. So last week the post merge ether issuance was 13,000. Today, seven, eight days later, the post merge ether issuance is 7100. We have burned about 6000 ether in the last seven days. And so where we have been previously, up to last week, we were inflationary. The last seven days has been extremely deflationary.
00:19:15.354 - 00:19:48.742, Speaker B: We've almost cut out 50% of all issuance in the last seven days. And this goes back to what I was saying last week. It's easier to burn ether than it is to issue it. And you can recover a significant amount of ether issuance in a short amount of time. So we've taken three weeks of issuance and deleted it inside of one week. Previously, I think the issuance rate of ether, the inflation rate was zero point 22% up until at the very peak, we are now down to zero 8% since the merge. And so this is really cool.
00:19:48.742 - 00:20:18.334, Speaker B: This is really, really cool. The less cool thing about it is, okay, why is this happening? Why are gas prices like sustaining 30 GWE and sometimes getting up to 100 again? It's because of a Ponzi Zen crypto thing. Yeah. I actually haven't looked into it myself, but this is the discussion at Devcon. And so I'm kind of regurgitating. What I heard is apparently this is like the new Ponzi thing. But this also goes back to my other take, that ether is the index of Ethereum and you don't have to buy every single token to have exposure to Ethereum.
00:20:18.462 - 00:20:21.198, Speaker A: Maybe this ponzi just comes and goes, every single token.
00:20:21.294 - 00:20:30.360, Speaker B: Definitely not. Yeah, maybe this Ponzi comes and goes, but it's burnt almost 5000 ether along the way. And so. Yeah, cool.
00:20:30.810 - 00:20:31.782, Speaker A: It is really cool.
00:20:31.836 - 00:20:33.974, Speaker B: Generalized exposure to ponzies. Nice.
00:20:34.092 - 00:21:04.278, Speaker A: Well, this is, and other things among them, but this is an example. So ETH was ultrasound on the week. It's not ultrasound overall since the merge, but it could easily, like, you get another week like this and it basically is. And what we're talking about, of course, is again a 94% issuance reduction post merge. And that has not been priced in from the markets at all. And the reason is because during bear markets like these, demand simply vanishes. For etherist NASA, everyone's kind of scared.
00:21:04.278 - 00:21:21.030, Speaker A: So demand vanishes. But in the backdrop, a lot of supply is getting eliminated as well. And so once that demand recovers, I would expect to see some rocket ships back up because we have much less supply to work with and there's much less availability.
00:21:21.530 - 00:21:32.742, Speaker B: I think that's the right take. I think ether burned, ether removed from the market. I don't think does too much when prices go down. I don't think this ETH burn is going to save ether from setting new lows.
00:21:32.806 - 00:21:33.338, Speaker A: It's not.
00:21:33.424 - 00:21:48.878, Speaker B: But once demand comes back, like you said, the upside becomes highly sensitive and so it is easy to recover price. I think as soon as there's any amount of meaningful new buyer net new buying of ETH. I think that's right, guys, we have.
00:21:48.884 - 00:22:11.798, Speaker A: A lot more coming up. In the roll up, David's going to get to all of the devcon announcements that he saw well in Bogota. And also we're going to talk about the binance smart chain pause. Why did it pause? What happened? Did they roll back the chain talk all about that? And then Hoffman versus Janet Yellen, the fight of the century. It's coming to a court near you. David can't talk about it, but I can. And I'm going to.
00:22:11.798 - 00:22:17.942, Speaker A: All of this and more coming after we talk about these fantastic sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:22:18.076 - 00:23:09.794, Speaker B: If you've been listening to bankless, you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis, the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus, allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves. And Fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry. By supporting parallel transaction execution, Fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web3 world. Fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the EVM with its own Fuel VM, which is more efficient and optimized, opening up the design space for developers. And lastly, Fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain specific language, sway, and a supportive tool chain called fork. With Fuel, you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like validity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem, letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the EVM. If you want to learn more, there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with a fuel network.
00:23:09.794 - 00:24:02.154, Speaker B: The Brave wallet is your secure multichain onramp into web3 and is built directly into the brave privacy browser. Gone are the days of managing multiple wallet extensions that put you at risk of phishing, spoofs and tracking. With the brave wallet, you can securely manage your crypto assets across more than 100 different chains, including Ethereum, L2s, Salana, and more, all without downloading risky extensions the brave wallet is easy to set up and removes the headache of jumping between wallets and extensions. It's lightweight, but packed with great features like built in token swaps, buying and holding NFTs with a gallery view, and support for hardware wallets. But also much more than that because Brave is shipping new features every single month with a mission to make web3 easier to navigate. For its over 55 million users, wallet extensions are a thing of the past. So get started with Brave's web3 ready browser today and experience a decentralized web seamlessly without all the clutter you can download the browser@brave.com
00:24:02.154 - 00:24:04.986, Speaker B: bankless and click the wallet icon to get started a.
00:24:05.008 - 00:24:14.186, Speaker A: Lot of big announcements coming at Devcon, mostly on the protocol layer of things as we were talking about in the intro. David, do you want to take us through a few of these announcements?
00:24:14.378 - 00:24:38.766, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%, because they're the really cool stuff. This is the building being expressed here at Devcon. So we'll start with this one. This is Liam on Twitter last night, and he's from the scroll team. Last night we officially announced the upgraded version of our Zke EVM testnet over at scroll. This is a huge milestone for both the scroll team and incredibly early community. Let's break down what this upgrade means for developers and users.
00:24:38.766 - 00:25:13.090, Speaker B: And there is a tweet thread in the show notes if you want to learn more. Scroll's ezk EVM testnet is debuted, and so if that is interesting to you as a developer or a tinkerer, that is now something that you can go play with. And so congratulations to the scroll team. The ZK roll ups are definitely a very hot conversation here in Bogota and overall in the crypto space. And this is scroll between Scroll Polygon and ZK sync. This is like one of the big three of the ZKe EVM teams, and now we got a Zke EVM on testnet ready to go.
00:25:13.160 - 00:25:15.890, Speaker A: Wouldn't you also add Starkware, maybe as a fourth?
00:25:16.390 - 00:25:18.530, Speaker B: No, starkware is not a zk evm.
00:25:18.870 - 00:25:26.840, Speaker A: Not a Zk evm because they don't actually have an evm, because you have to kind of write it in.
00:25:29.850 - 00:25:36.680, Speaker B: They are a non EVM compatible zk roll up. Yes, correct.
00:25:37.130 - 00:25:39.206, Speaker A: This is actually coming faster than I thought.
00:25:39.308 - 00:25:40.322, Speaker B: Super fast. Yes.
00:25:40.396 - 00:25:45.770, Speaker A: Big move for scroll. And they are purporting to be the most EVM equivalent of them all.
00:25:45.840 - 00:26:12.370, Speaker B: Of course, that is their competitive advantage. That is their angle. They are trying to be as EVM equivalent as possible, beyond EVM compatibility. And so there is a fight for EVM equivalents. Optimism and arbitrum are fighting over EVM equivalents. Scroll and Polygon are fighting over EVM equivalents. Zksync is specifically one firm in the EVM compatible camp.
00:26:12.370 - 00:26:39.094, Speaker B: That is their competitive advantage. A little bit in the same angle as why Starkware wanted Cairo. A little bit highly optimized language or just some kind of tinkering, but zk sync is a little bit in the middle. They definitely want to maintain EVM compatibility, but they think that they can make optimizations that are better than the ZKE EVM or an EVM equivalent roll up. So that's their territory.
00:26:39.222 - 00:26:45.230, Speaker A: Well, speaking of arbitrum, which you just mentioned, they had a big announcement, too. What are they talking about?
00:26:45.300 - 00:27:16.738, Speaker B: Yeah, this is huge. They have acquired prismatic labs, prilabs, Prism, a layer one client. We have a L2, optimistic rollup, acquired a layer one client team, which is crazy. No one really thought that you could really do this. And so this has caused a ton of conversations in this space as to what this actually means. But prism, it's like the most used client in Ethereum. One of the few people, the first teams to come out and build, start building an e two client, which is now what we call prism.
00:27:16.738 - 00:27:34.994, Speaker B: And that got acquired by Arbitrum. So Preston, Van Loon, Raul, all of the prism team, I think there's ten or 15 of them ish, are now under the arbitrum umbrella, and they are, of course, going to continue working on Prism. But now prism is just a product of arbitrum.
00:27:35.142 - 00:28:07.894, Speaker A: This is kind of cool in that it kind of means funding secured. Right? Like business model secured for the team that's building a crucial client. And obviously, this is very good for Arbitrum. And I believe arbitrum, when they say they're going to continue to support this and continue to maintain its credible neutrality. I think there have been some concerns about this, though. Is what happens if a L2 team kind of maybe tries to bias the layer one client in some way, or is this unfair to other L2? So there's been some of that. I don't know what to make of that.
00:28:07.894 - 00:28:29.690, Speaker A: We don't necessarily need to get into the arguments, but what I will say is the feedback that I've heard from Raul and Preston Van Loon and others is they're just excited about this. And I know those individuals are here for the right reasons and I don't think they'd be excited unless they had a path to preserve the values of Ethereum that they really care about. So I'm pretty optimistic about this overall.
00:28:29.770 - 00:29:22.778, Speaker B: I actually had the opportunity. I was in a cab with Preston for like 20 minutes where we kind of talked about this. So I can regurgitate some takes here. I'm going to see if I can get him into an actual interview right after this over at Devcon. But we are also hosting Preston and Steven from Arbitrum and prismatic on Tuesday, this next Tuesday for state of the nation to talk all about this. But Preston, one of the big reasons why he's so excited about this and the whole team is him and Raul were running a company, right? They were managing the grants incoming from the EF, where they were previously getting funding for, and they were doing HR and paying salaries and normal company stuff, but they're builders, they just want to tinker. And so now that they are being put under the larger arbitram umbrella, he doesn't have to do any of the business operations stuff, which I think if you're a builder, you just don't really like to do that.
00:29:22.778 - 00:29:44.950, Speaker B: Also, salaries are going up because they're going from grants to EF grants to, again, under the arbitrum umbrella. And they also get to just be financially compensated for all of their hard work, which grants aren't a business model. Everyone's super happy about it over on the prism team.
00:29:45.020 - 00:30:15.086, Speaker A: That's cool. Look, and if, worst case scenario, they're not going to go evil, but if they ever went evil, it's open source code. Some other team could fork it, take it and run with it. So I think that's a net win for the ecosystem. David, speaking of net wins, the makers of ZK Sync just launched their layer three testnet. Now, Steve from ZK Sync was talking all about layer three on a state of the nation that we recorded with him a couple of episodes ago, and they're already on Testnet for this. What is this announcement telling us?
00:30:15.188 - 00:30:55.946, Speaker B: Yeah, so ZK sync's main net is coming in like 20 ish days. We might actually be in the teens on that. So ZK sync is actually much further along than the other two ZKe EVM teams, Scroll and Polygon. So their main net, their ZKE EVM main net is coming very soon. And so their announcement today is that their layer three test nets, which are their app chains, their hyperchains, whatever you want to call them, their test nets for layer threes, is now going live. So they are like a decent step ahead of the other L2 teams because they are now working on their layer threes. This is the same conversation as to keeping Dydx on Ethereum.
00:30:55.946 - 00:31:20.600, Speaker B: DydX had to leave Ethereum because they wanted to produce their own app specific chain on cosmos because layer threes were not ready yet inside the Ethereum ecosystem. And this layer three testnet is what would have been a solution for DYDX. And so they're calling it Pathfinder. And so this is now whatever it means to have a layer three testnet, I'm not too sure, but it is now available for you.
00:31:21.210 - 00:32:00.350, Speaker A: So another big announcement from Polygon as well, which we weren't really sure when their public testnet for the Polygon ZkE EVM would go live. And it looks like it just went live at Devcon. So while Zksync is close to shipping on Mainnet, it'll be a guarded release. By the way, it's a main net without any apps. It'll be kind of like developers first, so we won't be able to use it for a while until they kind of release the floodgates. But meanwhile, from Polygon ZkevM, their testnet just went live as well. Any takes on this announcement?
00:32:00.510 - 00:32:44.778, Speaker B: Again, this is why the meta right now is the ZKE EVM and Vitalik at roll up day, which was a roll up themed conference, one day conference hosted by Scroll, Vitalik gave his presentation and talked about just like, yeah, the ZK teams have really astounded. They're shipping. They're shipping hard. Yeah. He was giving this narrative about how the ZK EVM, the ZK roll ups were like, going to be here in 2025 to 2030, like sometime around there, but Bam. No, they actually came in 2022. And he said it's the one time that you actually see development super accelerated beyond, like, the merge was delayed.
00:32:44.778 - 00:33:17.402, Speaker B: Sharding is not even here yet everything about Ethereum has been delayed except for the ZKE EVM teams. And you can see this all happening all at once at Devcon. Everyone saved their announcements to Devcon. The Zke Evms are basically here. And so while we're all frustrated that Ethereum development is slow, even though cool, now we have the merge, so I'm not really going to complain too much. The ZK L2 s are here, and they are super exciting. It's not just about cheap and fast transaction fees, Ryan, there's so much new doors that are opened up on a ZK roll up.
00:33:17.402 - 00:33:21.370, Speaker B: More content on that. The overall bankless ecosystem coming soon.
00:33:21.520 - 00:33:26.030, Speaker A: We at bankless are cheering all of these projects on. Way to go, everyone.
00:33:26.180 - 00:33:44.260, Speaker B: Quick disclaimer on all of these projects that we just mentioned. Ryan and I are investors in scroll. Ryan, I believe, is an investor in arbitrum. We are both advisors to Zksync, and Ryan is an advisor to Polygon. So we are very, very involved in this L2 ecosystem. And so those are those.
00:33:45.030 - 00:33:47.558, Speaker A: And also David holds some ETH. He's been known to hold a little.
00:33:47.564 - 00:33:50.706, Speaker B: Bit of also related to ether, I also hold ETH.
00:33:50.738 - 00:34:12.406, Speaker A: Yes. Disclaimer is out. Kevin Owalki, he tweets this. I am pleased to announce the launch of super modular XYZ. We are a venture studio that builds regen web3 projects, often on top of, adjacent and adjacent to Gitcoin's protocols. What is this from Kevin Owaki? What is super modular? This was announced at Devcon.
00:34:12.518 - 00:34:29.778, Speaker B: Yeah. So Kevin Owaki, the founder, former CEO of Gitcoin. Gitcoin is now a protocol. It is now a dao. It is on its own. And he's largely stepped back from the dow kind of in the same way Satoshi stepped back from bitcoin. And Vitalikset has stepped back from, like.
00:34:29.864 - 00:34:31.102, Speaker A: Even made time for a podcast.
00:34:31.166 - 00:35:24.162, Speaker B: Hasn't he even made time for the Green Hill podcast? And so Gitcoin is up and running and just chugging along. And so now Kevin, the perma builder that he is, has founded a centralized company that exists on top of the Gitcoin protocol. So I think super modular, it's a way to explain it simply is like the consensus for Gitcoin, a software studio that builds on top of the Gitcoin protocol. So Kevin Owalki just can't stop building a founder and CEO yet again, back building out something centralized on top of the decentralized protocol that he helps steward. So just Kevin Owalki is just like, well done, sir. And I also think this is just a great model of something that we see. I think we will see, and we have seen before, and we will see again, of founders building something, letting it become decentralized, and then building a centralized company on top of that decentralized thing.
00:35:24.162 - 00:35:40.534, Speaker B: This is what we've seen with Hayden Adams and Uniswap. So Hayden Adams built Uniswap, released it to the wild. Now the Uniswap Dao is in control of Uniswap, and now he's the CEO of Uniswap Labs, a software company that is building on uniswap. And so I think this model is going to be something that we're going to see over and over and over again throughout into the future.
00:35:40.652 - 00:36:06.670, Speaker A: I totally agree, and I think it's a great model. All right, well, meanwhile, this is everything that's going on on Devcon. I think you've got some more stuff to say about Devcon a little bit later, but maybe we should talk about another event that happened this week, and that was on the binance chain. So sorry, the BNB chain, I think they've rebranded. This is not the binance chain. Here's a tweet from BNB chain, the Twitter account. Due to irregular activity, we're temporarily pausing BSE.
00:36:06.670 - 00:36:17.502, Speaker A: We apologize for the inconvenience. We'll provide further updates here. Thank you for your patience and understanding. That happened. That tweet was put out on October 6. Was that last Friday, David?
00:36:17.646 - 00:36:36.982, Speaker B: Yes, I believe that's right. And then they also follow up that tweet to say, to confirm, we have suspended finance smart chain after having determined a potential exploit. All systems are now contained and we are immediately investigating the potential vulnerability. We know the community will assist and help freeze any transfers. All funds are safe. Interesting, because all funds were definitely not safe. Ryan.
00:36:37.126 - 00:37:03.874, Speaker A: All funds were not safe. Okay, so first of all, maybe we'll talk about the exploit itself and what that was, but let me just park this, because we'll come back to it later. How bizarre is it that a Twitter account representing the chain itself can tweet like, hey, something went wrong. We just paused it. It sounds an awful lot like a centralized exchange to me. Like, you'd expect this from Coinbase, you'd expect this from FTX. Something happened.
00:37:03.874 - 00:37:22.678, Speaker A: We're pausing things, but on a blockchain, a little bit weird. The Ethereum foundation. We're pausing the Ethereum chain because someone hacked the Ronan side chain. Like, what the hell? You're not supposed to be able to pause a chain but let's talk about what actually happened. Here's an article from decrypt.
00:37:22.774 - 00:38:02.834, Speaker B: Decrypt reports that $566,000,000 of BNB tokens were stolen from a bridge. So this was a bridge exploit, a bridge attack, and then they froze the chain. And so, as once the attacker got hands their hands on an extremely large sum of money, they started to transfer it out as fast as they could and all the different other bridges. So they bridged out to arbitrum. I think they also bridged out to optimism. They bridged out to Ethereum, but then they froze the chain. So the hacker managed to get away with $110,000,000, and then about $430,000,000 was frozen, and now is back in the custody of the finance smart chain operators.
00:38:02.834 - 00:38:15.500, Speaker B: And so the freezing of the chain did save $430,000,000, but the hacker has, like, $110,000,000 of various crypto assets across the space because they bridged out. And so.
00:38:18.590 - 00:38:53.826, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a summary of the hack. So since the BNB chain was suspended, the $430,000,000 on it cannot be transferred any further. And this tweet goes through kind of all the details and include that in the show notes. This is from Sam Cz son, who kind of goes over the hack and what actually happened. And it appears, David, that the summary here is something went wrong. There was a bug in the bridge, the Binance bridge itself. So there's a bug in the way that the Binance bridge verified proofs which could have allowed any attacker to forge arbitrary messages.
00:38:53.938 - 00:39:02.402, Speaker B: I went through this sun thread, and it was an extremely sophisticated mean. I generally don't understand.
00:39:02.476 - 00:39:03.462, Speaker A: Hard to find bug.
00:39:03.526 - 00:39:13.654, Speaker B: It's a very hard to find bug, hard to reproduce. I think this bug has been in binance smart chain since the beginning, which is kind of the crazier thing. So, yeah, this is like, top.
00:39:13.712 - 00:39:14.554, Speaker A: It's been in the bridge.
00:39:14.602 - 00:39:21.280, Speaker B: Specifically been in the bridge. It is a ten out of ten complexity level bug. So. Wow. Crazy.
00:39:22.050 - 00:39:43.174, Speaker A: So chain halted, everything frozen. The good news is, if you think this kind of thing is good news, is that they were able to get back a lot of the funds, I think. How much of the funds was finance able to kind of, like, recover or freeze, or was the hacker prevented from.
00:39:43.212 - 00:39:52.890, Speaker B: Getting away with about a little over 400 million? $430,000,000. Yeah. So the hacker got away with 10 million, 110,000,000, though. That's a large amount.
00:39:53.040 - 00:40:36.118, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so what do you think about this? I mean, there are some people outside of crypto looking at this and being like, well, I'm glad the hacker didn't get away. Are you guys crazy? The cops were on the beat. They froze the chain. They stopped the hacker from getting. Do you want the hacker to get away with, like, half a million dollars? And who knows who the hacker actually is, right? The last time on the Ronan side chain turned out to be a state apparatus of North Korea. Do you want these types of events to happen? And here you are on bankless saying, like, oh, it's out of character of crypto values for a chain to be able layer one chain to be able to freeze things.
00:40:36.118 - 00:40:42.390, Speaker A: Well, are you sure about that? Do the ends justify the means in this case? What's your take with that argument?
00:40:42.550 - 00:41:04.206, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't really think this surprises many people. Binance smart chain. There's that meme about the captcha of select all the fire hydrants, and then there's the meme of, like, select all of the binance smart chain validators. And it's just CZ's face, like, nine times. We know that this is the state of binance smart chain. This isn't really surprising to anyone that.
00:41:04.228 - 00:41:11.234, Speaker A: Is centralized, that they have the ability to freeze, that they will freeze if an event like this happens. You're saying no one was really surprised we all knew this.
00:41:11.272 - 00:41:39.580, Speaker B: Yeah. And so I think that has been in the social contract of binance smart chain. And so when we say, like, yeah, this is against crypto values. Well, yes, in one way, that's definitely against bitcoin and ethereum values, I don't think it's necessarily against binance smart chain's values. There's a certain social contract that binance smart chain has, and I think there's no secret that it is centralized and plausible. And the fact that we have Ethereum. And again, binance smart chain is an EVM fork of Ethereum, and then it's just juiced up geth, so it goes super fast.
00:41:39.580 - 00:41:46.010, Speaker B: We have the irreversible, immutable, decentralized version of that. It's called Ethereum.
00:41:47.490 - 00:41:49.406, Speaker A: We don't need Bnb to be that.
00:41:49.508 - 00:42:41.502, Speaker B: Yeah, we have that option. So if you would like to express those bankless values, you probably transact on Ethereum, if you prefer the more like a different level of settlement assurances, in the sense that you trust that binance smart chain operators like CZ will be benevolent and do things that will prevent hacking and loss of funds and return. Like, if you're an investor and you see, like, binance smart chain halted and gave money back to investors that were innocent. That might be compelling to you for some certain set of people. And so my take is that because we have Ethereum, I don't really care so much about binance doing this. I would be much more cautious and much more reserved if they were freezing funds of the Uighurs because the chinese government told them to. That's a different story.
00:42:41.556 - 00:43:24.222, Speaker A: Well, but that could happen, right? To be fair, now you have these buttons that centralized validators can press and have the ability to freeze. You'd expect that they wouldn't just be used for hack type situations, right? But largely, I agree with you. I think what this does though, is it really reveals that BNB chain is a separate type of platform, separate type of application, versus something like bitcoin or ethereum. Right? And so it is a bit more like a bank. It is a bit more like kind of fintech. And I actually don't see a lot of difference between something like BNB chain and an actual bank with a set of open APIs that you can build on top of. It's very similar.
00:43:24.222 - 00:44:01.622, Speaker A: It veers in that direction. It's kind of like fintech. Where I have a problem is when people mistakenly think that they're getting into DeFi or that this thing is built on a permissionless base layer. And really what you're kind of building it is on a set of validators, kind of like a bank API. That's where I have a little bit of the issue when it kind of masquerades or cloaks itself as being decentralized. And it's not nearly as decentralized as something like Ethereum you could build on top of it. Maybe it's permissionless, maybe it has some open APIs, but you can't put it in the same category as a bitcoin or Ethereum.
00:44:01.686 - 00:44:38.018, Speaker B: Right? And you touched on it just there. But just to drive that point home, I guess I'm defending CZ today. It's permissionless to access, it's permissionless to build on. It's like permissionless by default, but on a bank, for example, you can only do certain things and you can't do anything else. On binance smart chain, you can do whatever you want with the potential that CZ will stop you from doing that later. But you can enter binance smart chain and do things freely in the same way you can with Ethereum. You just know that, hey, you might get stopped after the fact, where a bank stops you before the fact.
00:44:38.018 - 00:44:44.738, Speaker B: Binance smart chain stops you after the fact, and then Ethereum doesn't stop you at. So, like, it splits the difference between Ethereum and a bank.
00:44:44.914 - 00:45:16.986, Speaker A: Well, what's interesting to me is some people will say, well, David Ryan, that's what users want. I mean, they want some level of protection. And I hear that, and I agree with you. And I would say if you're a user that wants that, go use binance chain. But what I actually think is that the true users of layer one blockspace aren't individuals like you, myself, or the bankless listeners right now. They're actually other chains. And so the true users of layer one block space are going to be the ZKE EVMs, the optimisms, the arbitrams.
00:45:16.986 - 00:45:55.914, Speaker A: Right. And the question for these chains is, what chain are you going to build on top of? Are you going to build on top of a chain where a small set of validators can freeze things? Well, if you are, then you are completely giving up your sovereignty. You're not building on a credibly neutral, censorship resistant base layer. Right. And so that is more kind of what I think. If you're a user, go use whatever chain that makes sense to you, like, recognize these trade offs. But if you're a chain, which is where the big blocks based consumers are going to be in the future, you sure as hell aren't going to build on something like BNB versus something that is much more immutable and has higher security guarantees.
00:45:55.962 - 00:46:32.830, Speaker B: Yeah, basically what you're saying is that these choices, the specific social contract of binance smart chain, puts a limit as to how much value can this thing actually host. What is the total addressable market? The total addressable market of pure strong immutability and strong settlement insurances is much larger than weak settlement assurances. People can trust Ethereum much more, and that's fine. And that's the same take that I have about Solana and why Solana needs to stop going down because of settlement assurances. You need to be able to have assurances that your value is secured. And Ethereum has that market pretty well cornered. I will say ethereum.
00:46:32.830 - 00:46:42.874, Speaker B: If you're using Ethereum, I would consider you a user. If you're using binance smart chain, I would consider you a customer. I would use semantically, that's interesting. Yeah, I would semantically define it like that.
00:46:42.912 - 00:47:04.254, Speaker A: Yeah, I kind of like that distinction. I think it draws the right mental models in people's mind. All right, speaking of distinction, speaking of mental models, actually, there's no segue here at all. I'm just going to say it. David is suing the treasury, guys. All right, I'm going to kind of lead this story. This is a post from the blog.
00:47:04.254 - 00:47:31.082, Speaker A: Coin center sues treasury over tornado cash sanctions. Of course, you know coin center. They are a crypto friendly legal group, lobbyist group based in DC. We've talked about them often on bank lists. We've had folks like Jerry Britto and Peter from coin center on the podcast to explain what's going on in DC. And guess whose name is in this article. Guess whose name is on the lawsuit? My own co host, if I can find it, David Hoffman.
00:47:31.082 - 00:47:45.602, Speaker A: Where are you? There he is. David Hoffman says. And David Hoffman, a digital asset manager. There you go. Digital asset manager, you. But let me read what's going on here. This is from Jerry Britto from Coin center.
00:47:45.602 - 00:48:24.186, Speaker A: He is the lead at coin center. Today, coin center filed suit in federal district court against OFAC. That is a branch of the treasury challenging its authority to sanction tornado cash. Immutable smart contracts. You guys remember that tornado cash was sanctioned so no US citizen can legally use tornado cash. A privacy mixer on chain on Ethereum. Jerry goes on, not only are we fighting for privacy rights, but if this precedent is allowed to stand, OFAC could add entire protocols like bitcoin or Ethereum to the sanctions list in the future, thus immediately banning them without any public process whatsoever.
00:48:24.186 - 00:48:46.598, Speaker A: This can't go unchallenged. Can you imagine that? The slippery slope here. We intend to win this challenge, even if it's necessary to go to the Supreme Court. And we'll keep you posted as the case unfolds. You can read more about our suit here. A big thank you to our co plaintiffs Patrick O'Sullivan, David Hoffman and another Twitter handle here. And this is the actual filing itself.
00:48:46.598 - 00:49:23.950, Speaker A: This is the first page on it. Listed as plaintiffs are coin center Patrick O'Sullivan, John Doe, and David Hoffman as plaintiffs versus Janet Yellen in her official capacity as secretary of treasury, department of the treasury. And it goes on. And the entire complaint is listed here. I might read some sections on it. But David, I know you can't say everything about this case as a co plaintiff, but what can you tell us? Why did you get involved in this? And what specifically is your role as a co plaintiff? Like, what are you filing this complaint?
00:49:24.770 - 00:50:08.558, Speaker B: So I'm suing Janet Yellen and Treasury because I received a dusting from tornado cash to David Hoffman ETH. I don't know who sent it to me. Permissionless Ethereum sent me money that is now against OFAC sanctions. And so as a result of that, because somebody has sent it to my public address, which I couldn't prevent them from doing, to, I had to file a report with OFAC saying, hey, somebody did this to me, had to take time out of my day, file this stupid report, like, do all these stupid things. And then every single year, Ryan, for the rest of my life, I have to do it again. And so next year, I'm going to have to file the same report saying, hey, still have this illegal money. I still control it.
00:50:08.558 - 00:50:46.330, Speaker B: It's still in my wallet. I'm not a criminal. And I have to do that next year, and I have to do that the year after that, and then I have to do it the year after that and the year after that for the rest of my life. And the thing is, Ryan, if somebody sends me ETH from tornado cash again, I have to do that again every single time. And so I'll file two reports and I'll file three reports. And so the treasury, as a result of their, in my mind, illegal listing of a smart contract, which I can't do, in my mind, in my opinion, I have to spend my life, my time doing this stupid bureaucracy stuff that I don't think I should have to do. And so this is an injury, and I'm suing Janet Yellen and the treasury.
00:50:46.830 - 00:51:04.490, Speaker A: It's not only that, as I understand it, David, it's unclear whether those that were dusted, yourself included, but also some celebrities. Right. Jimmy Fallon, I think, was dusted. It's un shaquille O'Neill. It's Shaquille O'Neal. You're fighting for all of them. You're fighting for Shaq.
00:51:04.490 - 00:51:06.138, Speaker A: You're fighting for Jimmy Fallon.
00:51:06.234 - 00:51:08.514, Speaker B: I don't want them to have to waste their time either.
00:51:08.712 - 00:51:42.682, Speaker A: It's not just wasting your time. I know that's a part of it. But it's also, as I understand it, treasury has not said whether they could legally, like, legally, it seems like Treasury's stance is, you are breaking the law even by receiving this. And so if you file, then you are a good citizen. Thank you very much. But they're only committing to deprioritize charging you for this illegal action that you've undertaken. And what is the illegal action? Receiving some dust that somebody sent you and these other individuals without their permission from tornado cash.
00:51:42.682 - 00:51:59.714, Speaker A: So this is awesome. I am so glad that coin center is stepping up here. David, it's awesome that you're doing this, man. I appreciate it. We appreciate it. The bankless community appreciates it. It's bankless af to take this to the court system, and I'm proud of.
00:51:59.714 - 00:52:21.046, Speaker A: Dude, this is really cool. I think this is a cool moment for crypto, by the way. I will say this isn't the only lawsuit that we have. So we have two irons in the fire as a crypto industry. So there's the coinbase lawsuit that's going on in parallel, and then there's this one from coins center. And I think that the hope is we have two irons in the fire. Two approaches.
00:52:21.046 - 00:53:13.610, Speaker A: One of these either wins or it gets all the way to the supreme Court. And then something happens. And the big macro fight here is the question of whether an american citizen can have on chain privacy or we have these. We have these rights on the Internet. I want you to know, every time you use encrypted communication protocol like HTTPs or something like this, you send encryption without a social media company spying on you or without the government spying on you, every time it's encrypted. We have that in our communication protocols, right? Are we going to, as a country in the US, allow citizens to have this in our value transfer digital protocols? That's what's at stake here. And if we lose this, as Jerry Britto was saying, we might lose the larger battle of having a censorship.
00:53:13.610 - 00:53:42.530, Speaker A: They could make it illegal to run an Ethereum validator in the US, for instance. Right. That is kind of the slippery slope. Why? Because unless you're running an OFAC sanctioned compliant ETH validator, you are maybe breaking the law. Right? So we have to take this to the court system. It's a big, bold move. And I just want to say, on the behalf of the whole bankless community, everyone in crypto, we appreciate it, man.
00:53:42.530 - 00:54:06.714, Speaker A: And we're cheering you on. I know you can't talk about it very much more. The good news is I can. All right, so I'm going to be keeping the bankless nation updated a bit more. And in addition, guys, to cheering David on, what you can also do is donate to coin center because they are funding all of the legal expenses to make this happen. David, as I understand, this is not coming out of your pocket. Right? So they're funding this.
00:54:06.714 - 00:54:13.598, Speaker A: They are representing, they're paying all the legal fees to take Janet Yellen and Treasury to court over this. Is that right?
00:54:13.684 - 00:54:22.654, Speaker B: Yeah, that's correct. Yeah. I could not do this without their support. So it's like David's face in the front, but it's entirely coin center in the back.
00:54:22.852 - 00:54:24.298, Speaker A: Coin center, mullet.
00:54:24.474 - 00:54:44.870, Speaker B: Coin center mullet. Yeah. So thank you, coin center, for all of the support and helping spearhead this coinscenter. ETH is where you can send money if you would like to contribute at Defcon, people, this went out while I was walking around at Defcon, and people were going up and, hey, congratulations on the lawsuit. I'm like, oh, I guess congratulations.
00:54:46.490 - 00:54:54.890, Speaker A: But seriously, congratulations. And I think it's going to take all of us kind of standing up if we're going to be able to protect our digital rights in the 21st century here.
00:54:54.960 - 00:55:10.282, Speaker B: And a quick speed, quick speed run through. Remember that before bitcoin episode that we did, cryptography was made available because of a series of lawsuits that individuals sued the government and won in court. And that is why we have cryptography.
00:55:10.346 - 00:55:16.018, Speaker A: And now we're just 1980s, early 90s. It was on the back of giants that we actually had the rights that.
00:55:16.024 - 00:55:19.918, Speaker B: We have today, and now we're doing it all over again. But now with cryptocurrency.
00:55:20.094 - 00:55:44.380, Speaker A: So running it back, let's make history. All right, coming up next, guys, we got a lot going on, including a whole bunch of hacks that happened. October was hack month in crypto. Also, PayPal getting a little authoritarian. Also, PayPal is going to fine you $2,500 if you're politically incorrect, maybe because you said something on Twitter. We'll talk about that story. It's partially true.
00:55:44.380 - 00:55:55.822, Speaker A: Partially. They've walked it back. And also the SEC is coming after the board apes of user labs. We'll talk about all of that and more when we get back. But first, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:55:55.956 - 00:56:49.118, Speaker B: Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum one, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems.

Ryan it is only the second week of October, yet we have hit all time highs in hacks, so not necessarily good news.
00:57:45.498 - 00:58:14.090, Speaker B: But so far, October is the biggest month ever for hacks. $718,000,000 across eleven different hacks. This year, there's been a little bit more than $3 billion across 125 hacks. And of course, it's always cross chain bridges, which has always been the weakest link in this entire industry. It's accounting for 64% of this year's losses. So congratulations, October, for breaking the record of hacks. And just another quick shill of the Ethereum L2 ecosystem.
00:58:14.090 - 00:58:43.950, Speaker B: You eliminate bridges as much as possible. In the L2 kill bridges, you kill the bridges. And so cross chain bridges, layer one to layer one side chains, they're the weak link. They're the reason why we have all these hacks. Optimism, superstructure, or superchain, which we're going to talk about at some point in the future. Zk syncs like hyperstructure. All of these single circuit L2s are the bridged, minimized scaling ecosystems, and that's how we're going to eliminate all of these hacks.
00:58:43.950 - 00:58:49.410, Speaker B: So again, that's why we're always bullish on these L2s. Anyways, congratulations to October for breaking records.
00:58:49.570 - 00:59:09.050, Speaker A: Yes, and not bullish on centralized bridges. Not bullish on bridges. This was another hack that happened this week. A DFI trading platform called Mango just lost $100 million in a hack that's included in those October numbers. And I think the hack here, David, was an oracle attack of some sort. What's crazy is.
00:59:09.120 - 00:59:10.602, Speaker B: Oh, my God, it's so crazy.
00:59:10.736 - 00:59:32.270, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so why don't you read this out? So the hacker stole $100 million in this protocol, exploited some kind of like, an oracle attack where he pumped the price, and then through that exploit, ran away with a bunch of money. And then he said he was sorry, and he posted to the governance form, hey, guys, please don't prosecute me. Why don't you read what this tweet is, David?
00:59:32.350 - 01:00:06.670, Speaker B: Yeah. So the hacker who stole a bunch of these mango tokens posted a governance proposal to the hacker, said, hey, I will pay back the Dow. Certainly, like, a significant amount of the money. Like, most of the money, 70 or 80%. And if the Dow agrees to not pursue legal action, and then because the hacker owns all of the tokens, the hacker voted yes to the governance proposal. To his own governance proposal, using the funds that he stole.
01:00:07.010 - 01:00:11.358, Speaker A: Checkmate mango holders is code law.
01:00:11.444 - 01:00:13.742, Speaker B: I don't know, but. Oh, my God, this is.
01:00:13.796 - 01:00:15.706, Speaker A: I don't think this kind of thing holds up.
01:00:15.748 - 01:00:17.570, Speaker B: I don't think this holds up in court.
01:00:19.030 - 01:00:20.110, Speaker A: What's the analog?
01:00:20.190 - 01:00:22.830, Speaker B: I guess maybe you go, no clue, dude.
01:00:22.910 - 01:00:33.160, Speaker A: Go to Wells Fargo, steal a whole bunch of their money, steal a bunch of their shares, and then go to their shareholder meeting, and are like, hey, don't prosecute me, and I'll give you most of the money back. And then you.
01:00:33.770 - 01:00:44.266, Speaker B: Yeah, like, somehow steal all the certificates. And I now own Wells Fargo because I own their certificates. But you don't own them because you stole them. That doesn't work.
01:00:44.448 - 01:01:08.340, Speaker A: Yeah. Only Warren Buffett could has the Wells Fargo shares to pull this off, I guess. I actually think there's a take here, and that is we got to get really serious about hacks. Okay, so $3 billion this year in hacks. That's a lot. And year is not even over, David. And do you notice when things started to turn ugly in the US, from a regulation perspective, we're just talking about tornado cash.
01:01:08.340 - 01:02:02.446, Speaker A: It happened after the $625,000,000 Ronan side chain hack. Do you remember that? And this was when North Korea, allegedly, some attackers from North Korea made off with millions of dollars and they pushed it through tornado cash. And this is when I feel like the US popped its head up and the defense apparatus of the US said, uh uh, we don't like this. This is know against our national security interests to have these, because what's happened is North Korea just got a new business model, and that business model is hacking crypto. So I want us. One of my thoughts here, one of my messages to crypto here, the industry is we think we're playing with these digital NFTs and these experimental Defi games, but this has actually moved beyond that. I think crypto has taken center stage in geopolitics, the geopolitical scene.
01:02:02.446 - 01:02:23.818, Speaker A: That's what we've entered. We have nation states that are attacking protocols now. Not this guy from Mango, that was just some guy. But in other cases, the runner's side chain. Who did the BNB chain hack? We don't know yet. And while I think this is inevitable, and I think it's progress, hacks really matter. I think we no longer get to, ah, it's going to happen.
01:02:23.818 - 01:02:58.854, Speaker A: Hacks are going to happen. I think that's true, and I understand that's part of the experiment, but could you imagine a hack that was like 3% or 5% of all ETH supply and it went in the hands of a rogue nation state? How is the US national security apparatus going to react to that? It's going to increase pressure and suppress citizen freedoms as a result of that. So I guess my message here is we as an industry, need to get really serious about defense and spend more resources on crypto security and preventing these kind of things moving forward.
01:02:58.972 - 01:03:07.974, Speaker B: Right? And again, it's one part, let's write better smart contracts, and it's another part is let's create systems that have less surface area for attack.
01:03:08.092 - 01:03:09.490, Speaker A: Yeah, less bridges.
01:03:09.650 - 01:03:10.942, Speaker B: Less bridges. Bridges.
01:03:11.026 - 01:03:18.906, Speaker A: Bad bridges, brat. Oh, speaking of bridges, here's a cross protocol. A bridge protocol. They just gave an airdrop. What's going on different, though, it's an.
01:03:18.928 - 01:03:23.126, Speaker B: Oracle bridge that lets you go from a one secure bridge to another secure bridge.
01:03:23.158 - 01:03:25.062, Speaker A: And again, not a multi sig bridge.
01:03:25.126 - 01:04:00.246, Speaker B: It's not a multi Sig bridge. And when optimism and Zksync have their perfect fraud proofs and they have their circuits down the optimism super chain, like the many, many chains where there's a thousand layer three chains, there's not a bridge there. There is a single circuit. There is no bridge. That is the cool thing about optimism. And all these layer threes and app chains on the L2 thesis, the bridges are gone. And so when you use this across, which is this airdrop we're about to talk about, and you hop from one bridge to another, you're using a bridge, but you're only vulnerable in that one moment that you are using it, not persistently, through all of time.
01:04:00.246 - 01:04:35.518, Speaker B: And so anyways, sorry, ACS across has an airdrop. So if you've ever used across, perhaps multiple times. There's a different criteria for being eligible for the ACX token, but a billion tokens has been minted and 125,000,000 tokens will be distributed through an airdrop through the people who have contributed to across. I am not local to my wallet at the moment, so I don't know if I got it, but I'm a frequent acrosser bridge or hopper, whatever you want to call it. Not Hopper, because that's hop. But I think I got this airdrop, so I'm going to go home and claim it. As soon as I'm done with Devcon.
01:04:35.694 - 01:05:05.214, Speaker A: You guys will include a link where you can check that it's across to airdrop and you can see if you're eligible for that. David there was a ruckus on Twitter as well that poured out about PayPal censorship. And the first tweet I saw about this was from David Marcus, formerly Facebook, now he's working on a bitcoin lightning project. I believe he used to work at PayPal, too. He's like an executive at PayPal. And this is as a result of PayPal issuing new terms of service for PayPal users. David Marcus says this.
01:05:05.214 - 01:05:47.494, Speaker A: It's hard for me to openly criticize a company I used to love and gave so much to. But PayPal's new terms of service goes against everything I believe in. A private company now gets to decide to take your money if you say something. They disagree with insanity. And he links to a post that has now been taken down. But the post from PayPal explicitly stated that they plan to target anyone who is sending posting publication of any messages, content, or materials that, quote, promote disinformation. And how would they do this? The company, PayPal would just deduct $2,500 from your PayPal account if they deemed you were in violation.
01:05:47.494 - 01:06:41.386, Speaker A: Okay, so PayPal has since backtracked this, has called it a mistake. It's not clear how these terms actually came to be and why they were published, but they are distancing themselves from this and they are backtracking from it. Here's a headline from fortune and PayPal tells users that will find them $2,500 for misinformation, then backtracks immediately. And of course, there is a take here that maybe PayPal genuinely made a mistake. Who knows how this language got in? It's hard to rationalize an explanation for how this could be accidental, but maybe some internal conversation that they never wanted to get out. Something like this. I guess the devil's advocate take on that is, well, maybe they were just, like, floating this idea and hoping it would go unnoticed.
01:06:41.386 - 01:07:16.262, Speaker A: And there was such a reaction from the entire ecosystem, not just crypto, but outside of it, to this, that they decided to withdraw and detract. But the big concern here is, obviously, imagine a bank. A bank account like PayPal, digital account. You say something on Twitter, maybe I don't like the fact that you're suing treasury, David, and I'm Paypal and it's against my policy. Or maybe you tweet something and it's quote unquote, misinformation. I can then just shut down your account. I could take money out of your account.
01:07:16.316 - 01:07:22.186, Speaker B: Hey, we don't service people who sue the government. Could you imagine why not?
01:07:22.288 - 01:07:29.494, Speaker A: Right? You just don't really know where this kind of things end. What do you think about this? Is this tinfoil hat conspiracy?
01:07:29.542 - 01:08:00.838, Speaker B: Or do you think that there's something here? I'm much less gracious than this. And I think that it's actually quite obvious that somebody chose that number. That number is specific. Somebody said, you know what we should do? We should fine people $2,500. The fact that that number is explicit, it's not that there's this detail of Paypal reserves the right to deduct funds from your account. If you say something like bad or something, maybe, or terrorist, I don't know. But somebody had to choose $2,500.
01:08:00.838 - 01:08:08.810, Speaker B: Somebody wrote that number down and said, this is the amount of money that we are going to deduct from your account under our discretion.
01:08:09.150 - 01:08:11.098, Speaker A: Misinformation, spread, whatever.
01:08:11.184 - 01:08:31.210, Speaker B: Yeah. The reason why this is. So there's that take. But also, we know the world of payments is just a huge era of censorship. This is what Amin Soleimani has been doing with payment channels and spank chain. So, like Mastercard, Visa, they won't support sex work, for example. That is censorship.
01:08:31.290 - 01:08:32.362, Speaker A: Marijuana industries.
01:08:32.426 - 01:08:33.278, Speaker B: Marijuana. Exactly.
01:08:33.364 - 01:08:42.610, Speaker A: Bankless has been kicked out of bank accounts. Bank of America. We're kicked out of bank of America for actually transferring money to Coinbase. And this happens.
01:08:42.760 - 01:09:01.346, Speaker B: Yeah. And so we know the payments industry is ripe with censorship. I don't know why it's so much, but you can't run a sex work company or, like, pot company without getting censored. And so this is part of the big story of why we need permissionless payment systems. Because you don't want to get debanked. Deplatformed.
01:09:01.538 - 01:09:18.874, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think they are right now advertising crypto for us. And this is why we need to go bankless. Of course. By the way, another reason to go bankless is to add insult to injury, David. You know the Celsius hacks. A lot of people with deposits in Celsius lost a heck of a lot of money, myself included.
01:09:18.874 - 01:10:09.278, Speaker A: Rip. It seems like they also exposed all Celsius users to a data leak. Okay. It came about, I guess, in the court system, some court documents that were leaked that basically docked the names, because, of course, with Celsius, every account is AML Kyc, so they have the identity and the amount of money individual Celsius holders actually had. And there's a way you can kind of back through some of that data and find specific crypto addresses, public crypto addresses that these individuals held as well. You essentially just doxed the entire Celsius user base. As if losing your money isn't enough, now you've lost your entire privacy, and everyone knows the net worth that you had on Celsius just kicking you in.
01:10:09.284 - 01:10:13.310, Speaker B: The gut on the way out like, absolutely insane, man.
01:10:13.460 - 01:10:14.494, Speaker A: Can you believe it?
01:10:14.612 - 01:10:37.446, Speaker B: That crypto grifters video I made where I was like, alex McCinsche is the greatest grifter of all time. Thank God that's aging so well right now. The other crazy thing is, like, remember last week we talked about the crypto lark and how he got Zach XBT because of pumping tokens and then dumping them? Crypto lark withdrew $2.5 million right before it froze. I don't know. Right before. I don't think that's a conspiracy here.
01:10:37.446 - 01:10:44.140, Speaker B: Maybe he was just like luck that he withdrew 2.5 before it got frozen. But crypto lark, the scammer got out.
01:10:44.670 - 01:10:47.322, Speaker A: Jeez, man, it doesn't feel right.
01:10:47.376 - 01:10:50.198, Speaker B: But you still have money inside of Celsius, don't you, Ryan?
01:10:50.374 - 01:11:07.294, Speaker A: No, it's gone. I don't know where it is. I had money in Celsius, but, yes, I actually don't know what the status of my information is, but it's not looking good. David. Rip on that too. Double rip. So, yeah, I'm right there with you, bankless nation.
01:11:07.294 - 01:11:14.226, Speaker A: If you got sucked into this. Fortunately for me, it was just like, I was just kind of testing Celsius. And this was play money.
01:11:14.328 - 01:11:15.582, Speaker B: Sure ish.
01:11:15.646 - 01:11:16.260, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:11:16.870 - 01:11:19.122, Speaker B: Wasn't play money for everyone, so that's unfortunate.
01:11:19.186 - 01:11:19.414, Speaker A: Yes.
01:11:19.452 - 01:11:21.698, Speaker B: And also, sorry, people that got doxxed.
01:11:21.874 - 01:11:46.190, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. It's brutal. Board ape creator facing SEC probe over unregistered securities offering. So going after Yuga labs, SEC, maybe going after probing. First you probe, then you kind of drop your kiss. So SEC doing the old probe and Yuga labs, of course, the creators of board apes, very prominent. Is it number one? Number two, NFT.
01:11:46.610 - 01:11:47.374, Speaker B: Number one.
01:11:47.492 - 01:11:48.622, Speaker A: It's number one right now. Okay.
01:11:48.676 - 01:11:52.126, Speaker B: Number one in market cap, not culture in my mind.
01:11:52.148 - 01:12:35.790, Speaker A: But that's just my, what's interesting is one of the line items here is the SEC not only investigating yuga labs or the sale of the digital assets, right. Like they have a token, some other things. But the SEC is examining whether certain NFTs from the company are more akin to stocks and should follow the same disclosure rules. The SEC is also examining the distribution of apecoin. Here's the David, like, I don't know what parts of the apecoin ecosystem and all the various parts, like what parts of those might be securities and what parts might not be, but are they saying that the JPEGs themselves, the Ape JPEGs themselves are securities?
01:12:36.450 - 01:12:37.806, Speaker B: They are investigating it.
01:12:37.828 - 01:12:54.942, Speaker A: Yeah, the JPEG, they're probing it. Let me just say a probe itself is punishment. It's investigation. I mean, it's legal expenses. It's punishment. It has a chilling effect on the industry. And here's my beef with the SEC in this type of action is we don't actually know because they refuse to clarify.
01:12:54.942 - 01:13:10.300, Speaker A: Are nfts themselves the jpegs? Are they securities are baseball cards. Securities are antique card. Securities? Are pieces of art securities? Of course not. Okay. Do monkey jpegs really need a ten k filing? All right, well, okay, do they need.
01:13:11.310 - 01:13:37.154, Speaker B: My SEc hat is Yuga Labs is building out a metaverse, right? They took investment from like, a 16 Z and many other people to build out this Yuga Labs board apes metaverse. And in that metaverse, a financial asset is a board ape. And so the metaverse has some sort of value to it. And the board ape is correlated or associated with that value. So is apecoin. And so it kind of actually does feel like a Howie test.
01:13:37.192 - 01:13:39.826, Speaker A: Ryan, I can't believe I'm taking my.
01:13:39.848 - 01:13:51.270, Speaker B: Side of the SEC. But also, it just goes to show that we need better laws because it's a goddamn monkey picture. It's not a security, and we need to have permissionless building or else this industry is not going to express itself the way it should.
01:13:51.420 - 01:14:08.122, Speaker A: Here's the thing. It's just the SEC, they want to take a leadership position in crypto, but all they're doing is vaguely through these sorts of charges and probes, telling us very obscurely what we can't do, but they're not telling us what we can do, right?
01:14:08.256 - 01:14:09.834, Speaker B: They're just suing us. Yeah.
01:14:09.952 - 01:14:25.780, Speaker A: Yes. They refuse to give us basic clarity. That's my big charge. And I think that as a result of this for mean, it's probably no secret. We'd like to do more with bankless, with some sort of membership. NFT. Right.
01:14:25.780 - 01:14:35.554, Speaker A: What's the status of that thing? How do we make sure that that's not defined? Like, Gary Gensler's position is Ryan, Sean versus the SEC.
01:14:35.672 - 01:14:36.962, Speaker B: That's what happens here.
01:14:37.016 - 01:14:38.740, Speaker A: Lord, do we need another one.
01:14:40.550 - 01:14:42.146, Speaker B: Yeah, you take the treasure, I'll take the treasury.
01:14:42.178 - 01:14:47.378, Speaker A: You take the SEC. Hey, what about this world where Gensler becomes the next Janet Yellen?
01:14:47.474 - 01:14:49.286, Speaker B: Oh, God, that's a world.
01:14:49.308 - 01:14:50.374, Speaker A: That could happen, too.
01:14:50.492 - 01:14:52.570, Speaker B: Can I get a poap for suing the treasury?
01:14:53.630 - 01:15:14.530, Speaker A: Only if you win. Sorry, Dave. You got to win for us. All right. Anyway, craziness again. I'm sure there are things that are clearly securities, probably, but we don't know what the bright lines are. And it feels like our regulators aren't willing to actually talk to the crypto community and give us some clarity here.
01:15:14.530 - 01:15:48.602, Speaker A: I just want some good faith, David, on the releases side. LTB, you know, LTB because they're showing you total value locked for different L2s. Now they're also showing you total value locked for bridges. And they're doing risk analysis of bridges, which feels very relevant. So you can look at the polygon, pos bridge, multichain, Rainbow Bridge, Ronan V two bridge, Avalanche Bridge, all of the bridges, and you can see how risky they actually are. So this feels like a very timely release from L2 beat. And you could find that at L2beat.com.
01:15:48.602 - 01:15:50.838, Speaker A: Pretty badass. What's this one, David?
01:15:50.934 - 01:16:19.314, Speaker B: Yeah, this is nethermind making an announcement that they have taken uniswap. Kind of imported it over to Starknet. So remember when we were going through all of the zke EVM conversations? I was like, zK sync, EVM compatible scroll and Polygon, going after EVM equivalents. And then there's Starknet, which is just like, we don't care about the EVM. We're building our own thing. It's called Cairo. So they have taken uniswap, and they have rewritten it, tinkered it a little bit, because that's what you have to do, and then applied it to the Starknet ecosystem.
01:16:19.314 - 01:16:35.050, Speaker B: So a uniswap sister thing, which is not exactly what uniswap is, because they had to change it, is now on Starknet, and they are calling it what are they calling it? Uni Stark, because they had to rewrite it for Starknet. So uni Stark, which is a uniswap flavor, is now on Starknet.
01:16:35.710 - 01:16:55.730, Speaker A: That's really cool. Obviously get the scalability of Starknet. Do you see this, David? Blockchain address is now available in Google search. So if you just plug in a blockchain address, Google will display it on Etherscan. I like this. Cool. I also worry about Google data surveillance.
01:16:56.070 - 01:17:01.970, Speaker B: And it's just pulling from Etherscan. It's not any more invasive than Etherscan. It's all public.
01:17:02.040 - 01:17:20.230, Speaker A: Sure, I guess this is true. Here's what I worry about, David. You start plugging in all of your ETH addresses. For example, in Google. Google already has a profile for David Hoffman where it knows your search history, it knows your browser history, it knows a lot of data about you. Yeah, but it knows maybe where you are in Google Maps.
01:17:20.310 - 01:17:26.758, Speaker B: You're also complaining about the business model of Zapper. And I. I'm pushing back on complaining.
01:17:26.854 - 01:17:57.410, Speaker A: I'm only complaining because it's Google, and Zapper and Xerion do not have the scope of a data profile on me that a Google has. And so I just worry about these kind of long term effects. I'm happy that Google added just, again, it's kind of like, how do we get out of this Moloch trap of constant surveillance, tech surveillance of us? And that's the part that always gives me pause. But anyway, in the meanwhile, good job, David. You released a new bankless video here. What's this?
01:17:57.480 - 01:18:08.390, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is that new bankless YouTube account. There's new YouTube? New YouTube video. It's like these hyper optimized 15 minutes explanation of what ether is. It's basically my triple point asset thesis. But if you are into these new videos, go check it out.
01:18:08.460 - 01:18:08.726, Speaker A: All right.
01:18:08.748 - 01:18:30.762, Speaker B: Uniswap Labs is announcing $165,000,000 raise in series B funding to bring powerful simplicity of uniswap to even more people. So congrats on Uniswap Labs. They are raising, and I believe that is the only raise of the week. However, Ryan, I can see on the ground at Devcon that definitely there is some deals being made. There are deals being inked on the floor at Defcon. So there is some activity.
01:18:30.906 - 01:18:46.902, Speaker A: It's definitely the biggest raise of the week. I bet there are others that we miss. But one thing that's happening we know is uniswap. As a result of this funding, Uniswap Labs is hiring. The reason we know that is because they're on the jobs board. It's our weekly reminder to tell you to get a job in crypto. As David dances, I'm going to read some jobs off for you.
01:18:46.902 - 01:19:01.278, Speaker A: Uniswap Labs needs a director of product management. David, I think that's non technical. Okay. They also need a developer relations lead. Probably not technical, probably ish. Senior front end engineer. Uniswap senior back end engineer.
01:19:01.278 - 01:19:14.022, Speaker A: Those are definitely technical. Solid world. Dow needs a senior web3 developer. Rubicon smart contract engineer. Bankless still looking for a social lord optimism? Hiring a bunch? So is rabbit hole. So is coinshift. Go ahead on over to bankless palette.com

01:21:10.590 - 01:21:18.530, Speaker A: Guys, we are back with takes. Tip first take. David, you watched the coin documentary. It's called Coin a founder's story. What's your review? How many stars?
01:21:18.950 - 01:21:34.598, Speaker B: Five out of five stars. I thought it was super, super good. And there's also so many more movies about Ethereum, about crypto coming out, like documentaries. And I think it's going to be a really, actually great onboarding and PR tool for crypto movies. Just like, yeah, let's tell you the story. The long term real humans. Real humans.
01:21:34.614 - 01:21:36.170, Speaker A: The shadowy supercoders.
01:21:38.430 - 01:22:15.106, Speaker B: Brian and Coinbase has always kind of been like a black box. It's a little bit, hey, what's going on over there? What you guys up to? Not for any particular reason. Brian's just kind of an introverted person. And every time I learn more about Brian, either through his interview with Peter McCormick and then our podcast with him, he doesn't do very many public things. So this documentary was awesome just to see just the story of Brian and Coinbase. And I tweeted out, every time I learn more about Brian, I discover more reasons to respect him. And so he's just a guy that saw first Coinbase was a wallet, and he was struggling to find a business model because no one had any bitcoin.
01:22:15.106 - 01:22:48.500, Speaker B: So it's like, oh, I'll just put in a buy button in the wallet and I'll let people buy bitcoin so they can use my wallet. And then he learns that actually that's the business, is selling bitcoin to people that want to buy it. And then the ball starts rolling downhill and Coinbase just becomes huge. And him and Fred Erichom started building this thing. So as I've learned about Brian, he's gone from, for me, just a successful founder to an industry leader, to a straight up personal hero. That guy has done so much for the industry, and I don't think we give him enough credit, but that's my take of the week. The coin movie was great, and Brian's a great guy.
01:22:48.870 - 01:23:15.526, Speaker A: That's awesome. I think David in the crypto banks, we're going to have some banks that stand up and uphold crypto values for us. I'm hopeful Brian Coinbase is among those. I think there will be, sadly, some other crypto banks that kind of sell us out to the regulators and politicians and are not going to be fans of DeFi, and those will emerge, too. But I think Brian's always been here for the right reasons. And, yeah, we're excited about that. David.
01:23:15.526 - 01:23:20.630, Speaker A: This is a take from a congressman, Representative Bill Huzenga.
01:23:20.790 - 01:23:48.210, Speaker B: Yeah, and Bill says the fact that Gary Gensler has appeared twice with John Stewart before attending an oversight hearing with the financial crimes and enforcement and also the Democrats, just like doing its job is alarming. Appearing before Congress is part of your job. He says to Gary Gensler, we look forward to seeing you in 2023 under new leadership. So a congressman, a House of Representatives congressman, is saying, Gary Gensler, stop going on John Stewart and start showing up at your job.
01:23:48.360 - 01:23:49.994, Speaker A: Stop trying to be an influencer.
01:23:50.062 - 01:24:03.810, Speaker B: Stop trying to be an influencer. Yeah. God, Ryan. Sean Adams. Here's a take from Ryan saying, apparently the era of easy money is over and crypto was just a speculative asset bubble that will never recover. And there was never real, anything real here to begin with. And you should have sold the top, you idiot.
01:24:03.810 - 01:24:08.198, Speaker B: And then he finished his saying, hello, 2018. Good to be back. What do you mean, good to be back?
01:24:08.284 - 01:24:08.646, Speaker A: Thank you.
01:24:08.668 - 01:24:10.010, Speaker B: And why'd you call me an idiot?
01:24:10.130 - 01:24:39.314, Speaker A: By the way, thanks for enabling the tone of that. It was definitely sarcastic. It just feels very 2018 to me. Like, at a time where everyone's saying crypto is over, it was always a speculative asset. There was never anything really, go to Reddit and try to say something positive about NFTs right now. You just get absolutely brigaded. And this reminds me so much of 2018, honestly, where we had kind of the backlash and the back of ICOs and Ethereum was like nothing and there was no such thing as DFI and all ICOs and all of crypto was a scam.
01:24:39.314 - 01:25:02.810, Speaker A: Feels like 2018 now. I know there are some differences. We've got war in Ukraine, we have massive macroeconomic pressures and things we didn't have in 2018. But that's what everyone says in 2018. People are like, no, this is different than the 2015 bear because in this bear, XYZ. Right. And everyone always says that anyway.
01:25:02.810 - 01:25:15.558, Speaker A: To me, it's kind of home. It's back to 2018. It'll take some time to recover, but I'm super confident we're going to come back stronger. It just might take a little bit. David, what are you excited about this week, man? And why is it Devcon?
01:25:15.754 - 01:25:32.760, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Defcon has just been so fun, man. And this was a picture of me at Ravi last night, Ave's regular party that they always throw. And this is Dankrad. So Dankrad feist. This guy, super german, always wears a collar in the middle of this.
01:25:33.290 - 01:25:36.534, Speaker A: You said there were no suits. He's got the sports coat on.
01:25:36.732 - 01:25:49.258, Speaker B: It's different when it's Dankrad. Dankrad doesn't count. He's just german. So I took this photo with Dankrad at Ravi last night. Yeah, man, it's so great to see all the builders around.
01:25:49.344 - 01:25:53.066, Speaker A: This is like a big brain researcher behind proto dank chart, by the way.
01:25:53.088 - 01:25:58.590, Speaker B: This guy knows crazy polynomial math and rave lasers in the background.
01:25:59.810 - 01:26:01.998, Speaker A: Crypto is great, man. I love it.
01:26:02.084 - 01:26:30.230, Speaker B: And the energy here is so awesome. And even though it's the bear market and people are sad about the prices, and my metaphor for these markets is, like, in the bull market, it's like a bonfire, but in the bear market, the fire starts to dwindle. But the fire at Devcon is really strong. And even the boys club event also last night was just. The energy at Boys club was crazy. And it's cool because boys club is like, I don't really think, like boys club and core layer one ethereum protocol development.
01:26:32.590 - 01:26:37.914, Speaker A: Boys club, by the way, is a web3 dow that.
01:26:37.952 - 01:26:38.998, Speaker B: It's a social organization.
01:26:39.094 - 01:26:51.674, Speaker A: Yeah, primarily, like, representing women and non binary people. So when people hear David say boys Club, it's a joke. It's a play on words. All right? It's not an actual boys for boys.
01:26:51.722 - 01:27:08.274, Speaker B: Yeah, but the boys club showed up, and through one of the most high energy vitality events, and everyone is having a really good time. And so as energy is going out of the space. And it's just a good move by boys club, because that's what they do. They throw really good events.
01:27:08.322 - 01:27:09.058, Speaker A: Parties.
01:27:09.234 - 01:27:26.538, Speaker B: Really good parties. And there's not many other conferences out there that have enough life in them for them to throw a good event, because no one wants to throw a depressing event. So what do they do? Oh, they go to the crypto nerds at the developers convention, and then they throw a really good event there, because that's where all the vitality is in.
01:27:26.544 - 01:27:30.300, Speaker A: This, because developers aren't going to throw their. They're going to buy boxes of.
01:27:32.270 - 01:27:42.606, Speaker B: Like, the cool thing about Devcon and why I'm so excited about Devcon is it's a tech conference. But it goes to very specific cities. It's not San Francisco. It doesn't go to New York.
01:27:42.708 - 01:27:45.146, Speaker A: It goes to off the beaten path Bogota.
01:27:45.178 - 01:28:02.774, Speaker B: It goes to Osaka, it goes to Prague. And it's not just a tech conference, it's also a cultural conference. And that's because Ethereum is not just a technology, it's a social, organizational technology. It's a so. And this is why the Devcon execution team is shout out to Skyler at the ES.
01:28:02.812 - 01:28:10.920, Speaker A: They got a lot of pressure, by the way, for going to Columbia because people are saying, hey, it's too dangerous. You can't throw conference there. It's not large enough.
01:28:11.290 - 01:28:24.742, Speaker B: People do have bodyguards and stuff. But it's also like if you just live with common sense, you don't get yourself in trouble. I haven't heard anyone getting into trouble. But leaning into the culture side of things for every city that we go to, and it's just like the right branding for Ethereum.
01:28:24.886 - 01:28:27.580, Speaker A: What's the next city, David, next?
01:28:28.750 - 01:28:38.450, Speaker B: Like, this is where people start to lobby the EFS. I want to come to my city. So there's like a movement to get the Defcon in Turkey, in Istanbul.
01:28:38.870 - 01:28:41.330, Speaker A: I think it's going to be somewhere you don't.
01:28:41.670 - 01:28:42.898, Speaker B: Oh, definitely. Definitely.
01:28:42.984 - 01:28:47.780, Speaker A: Istanbul would be one of the top places I would not suspect, actually. Right.
01:28:48.950 - 01:29:06.130, Speaker B: Anyway, that's what I'm bullish on, the fact that Devcon is not just a tech conference, it's also a cultural conference. It's important. This is where we come together as a community and hang out and make sure that we're not just like face down, buried in code all the time or in our world, podcasts. Anyways, what are you bullish on, Ryan?
01:29:06.290 - 01:29:20.746, Speaker A: I asked a question this week on Twitter. Sometimes you get good answers. Questions on Twitter, sometimes you get bad. I got a lot of good ones. I said this. From the 2015 to 2016 bear market, we got Ethereum. From the 2018 to 2019 bear market, we got DfI and NFTs.
01:29:20.746 - 01:30:11.870, Speaker A: What's going to be the big thing coming out of this bear market, the bear market of 2022 that we're in? And I was just really excited about the range of different answers to the question because it wasn't just a consistent, like, there wasn't like a group think of, it's all going to be this or it's all going to be that. Impact. Dows DFI science Refi Web Two integrating web3 game Phi broadening of NFTs to research IP and NFTs like music, video and other verticals, more noob friendly, Dfi, social crypto. All of these answers the question. My answer to this question is probably the layup answer, which is like L2s. It seems so obvious that coming out of this bear market, L2s are going to be like the absolute vanguard of crypto. Like, they're going to be stronger, they're going to be in higher use.
01:30:11.870 - 01:30:45.738, Speaker A: I don't know, David, if you saw the Ethereum quarterly report, state of Ethereum report, like earnings report we released on bankless last week. Ben, put this together for our team. Ethereum is down in just about every category, right? Like revenue is down 86%. DFI, total locked value is down 60%. Stablecoin supply down 21%. It's very clear that we are weathering a major contraction. But the bright spot was L2s are up 97%, about 100%, and we're doing that in a bear market.
01:30:45.738 - 01:31:13.618, Speaker A: So this to me is like, these are kind of the early saplings, kind of on the tree of future life and future progress. So that's what I'm excited about, that no one actually knows what the next big thing is going to be. Tells me that it could be almost anything and it'll be unexpected, and that we're pursuing so many different use cases at the same time. And then I just see obvious things like L2s, which are going to.
01:31:13.624 - 01:31:16.846, Speaker B: Be a big deal, 100%. Also bullish.
01:31:16.958 - 01:31:23.174, Speaker A: All right, man, I know you got to get somewhere real soon for Devcon, but let's get to the meme of the week. What are we looking at here?
01:31:23.292 - 01:31:45.142, Speaker B: Yeah, I can't remember what kind of flavor of comic this is, but it's like the guy who's interviewing for a job and the job interviewer is asking, can you stop inflation without causing a recession? And the interviewee says, no, I can't. And then the guy says, okay, you're hired. And then it turns out that this is the federal reserve. Cyanide inhabitants. That's what this is. Yeah, that was pretty good and very implemented.
01:31:45.206 - 01:31:51.406, Speaker A: All right, guys, David's got to get to Devcon. I know he's going to be on stage presenting a few things, actually talking, I think, doing a panel coming up.
01:31:51.428 - 01:32:04.226, Speaker B: I am moderating a panel that is definitely stretching my technical ability. It's account construction. So I have to finish up doing my research. But it is also the only panel that Vitalik Buterin is on on the main stage. So your boy's hosting that panel in a second.
01:32:04.328 - 01:32:19.746, Speaker A: He chose to do account abstraction as this thing that he wants to talk, huh? Yeah, that shows how important he thinks it is. Well, cool. We'll leave it at this then. Risks and disclaimers as always. Got to tell you that crypto is risky. We're definitely on the frontier. ETH is risky, Defi is risky.
01:32:19.746 - 01:32:27.738, Speaker A: You could definitely lose what you put in, but we are headed west. It's the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
