00:00:00.090 - 00:00:33.426, Speaker A: In the 1990s, the Internet came out that allowed everyone on the Internet to communicate with everyone else on the Internet directly. And that led to exponential takeoff in people being able to benefit themselves, like improve themselves, improve each other, cooperate on more and more sophisticated projects. A certain faction of the US government had this intention, which is, okay, the world is going to get an Internet. The Internet's totally taken off. We're going to arrange so that everyone in the world can use the Internet. They can all talk to each other, but the NSA has a backdoor into everyone's computer and can read or control what everyone says on the Internet. That was their plan, and it was called the Clipper chip.
00:00:33.426 - 00:00:41.586, Speaker A: And so there was going to be a law that if you make a device, then it has to have a clipper chip built into it in order to give the NSA control over your Internet.
00:00:41.618 - 00:00:52.890, Speaker B: And this is a pattern throughout history of somebody creates a new breakthrough in cryptography, and as soon as the local government discovers it, they snap it and hide it and keep it from themselves as a national secret.
