00:00:00.090 - 00:00:18.640, Speaker A: You like, looked at all the product launches from inception of Crypto to now see what's going to happen in the next twelve to 18 months. The next twelve to 18 months probably going to be way more than everything else combined up to this point. And if people are launching products they're grinding for product market fit, they're going to get users means Crypto is going to survive. It's just that's going to happen.
00:00:20.850 - 00:00:53.218, Speaker B: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of internet money and internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, how to front run the opportunity. This is Ryan Sean Adams and I'm here with David Hoffman, and we're here to help you become more bankless. Talking about solana today. The chips are down, prices are down, a major public backer of Solana, SBF, he's down for the count as well. He's definitely not helping the sentiment. So we brought on the Solana co founder to ask the question, is Solana gonna make it? A few things to look out for in this episode.
00:00:53.218 - 00:01:28.150, Speaker B: Number one, we go through the full story of Solana back to its earliest moments. Number two, we talk about the state of Solana today, both post FTX, pre FTX as well, and at the bottom of the bear market that we find ourselves in. Well, it might not be the bottom yet. We'll see. And number three, Anatoli's reaction when he first heard the news of SBF. And lastly, we asked the question that I think is on a lot of people's minds in this market, will Solana survive the bear? And if it does, how he thinks it will make it out? David, you really wanted to have this podcast, tell us why.
00:01:28.220 - 00:02:28.726, Speaker C: I've wanted to bring Anatoly on for a long time, and I think right now is the best moment to do that. And that's because of really where Salana is as it relates to its community, its builders, and its leadership. I think right now the Salana ecosystem is going through a moment of self reflection as it looked back upon its own absolutely insane bull market throughout 2021 and 2022. And I see a lot of parallels to how Ethereum progressed through 2017 to 2018. I kind of think as Salana is doing a lot of the same, taking a lot of the same paths that Ethereum took a crazy adoption story of a bunch of just what ultimately ended up to be a lot of hot air. Like Ethereum had ICOs in 2017, salana had a lot of hot air in this last 2021 bull market. And at the end of this very bad year of just downward price action, a big pillar that really held up the Solana ecosystem, FTX and SPF turns out to be a complete fraud.
00:02:28.726 - 00:03:13.946, Speaker C: And so because The Solana community is really going through this Period Of self reflection, that Makes me bullish about the Solana community, that Makes me really Interested in seeing how they Choose To Take on Hardship, how they Choose To go about what Is Going To Be a Very difficult, long bull market to pull Solana out Of The hole that it's in. And that's why I wanted to bring Anatoly on, because Solana is different than almost any other chain that is in crypto. It's different from all the EVM clones, avalanche, phantom, like, whatever in that. It's got multi client architecture. It's the only other ecosystem that has a multi client architecture. And there is a real builder community there. There's a real Solana community there.
00:03:13.946 - 00:04:06.982, Speaker C: And so Ryan, I know you and I have been branded as, and we have a big ETH bias, of course, can't really deny that. But now that we are in this bear market, my walls, I think, come, it feels safe to take down my walls during the bear market because of all of the crap that we flushed out during the bull market. So like, my walls go up during the bull market because a bunch of newcomers come in and don't really understand the deep fundamentals about what makes crypto work. And now that is well behind us. Now that we are deep inside of this bear market, the people that are here are now here for the tech, no longer for the money, they must be here for the tech. And so that's what I see in the current state of the Salana community, people that are here for the tech. And I think now is the right time to bring on Anatoli to tell that story and to ask what's Salana going to do in 2023?
00:04:07.116 - 00:04:52.262, Speaker B: Well, I can't wait to talk about that with you in the Debrief, because there's some things maybe we agree on, but I think there's some things we might disagree on about the first time. And we'll have that discussion, that debate in the Debrief.

00:07:15.580 - 00:07:16.374, Speaker C: Maybe you missed one.
00:07:16.412 - 00:07:39.678, Speaker D: So here's what you should do. Go to Earnify and plug in your Ethereum wallet. And Earnify will tell you if you have any unclaimed airdrops that you can get. And it also does poaps and mintable NFTs any kind of money that your wallet can claim. Earnify will tell you about it. And you should probably do it now because some Airdrops expire. And if you sign up for Earnify, they'll email you anytime one of your wallets has a new AirDrop for it to make sure that you never lose an AirDrop ever again.
00:07:39.678 - 00:07:58.142, Speaker D: You can also upgrade to Earnify premium to unlock access to Airdrops that are beyond the basics and are able to set reminders for more wallets. And for just under $21 a month, it probably pays for itself with just one AirDrop. So plug in your wallets at Earnify and see what you get that's Earnifi, and make sure you never lose another AirDrop.
00:07:58.206 - 00:08:06.246, Speaker B: Bankless nation we have anatoly Yakavenko. He's the creator of Salana and the co founder of Salana Labs. Anatoli, great to have you on Bankless. How are you doing?
00:08:06.428 - 00:08:06.822, Speaker E: Good.
00:08:06.876 - 00:08:07.958, Speaker A: Thank you for having me.
00:08:08.044 - 00:08:24.720, Speaker B: Hey, how was 2023? Are you glad to have 2022 in the rear view window? Dave and I were just talking about this, like, whether we would go back in time and crush 2022, make it so it never happened or not. What's your feeling on the year of 2022?
00:08:26.370 - 00:08:40.882, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm glad it's behind us, but that was the year that I was spent obsessing over priority fees and dealing with spam and Salana. So if I could just take that engineering effort and move it a year.
00:08:40.936 - 00:08:41.540, Speaker E: Back.
00:08:43.270 - 00:08:44.580, Speaker A: That would be awesome.
00:08:45.030 - 00:08:53.590, Speaker B: I mean, how are you feeling coming into this year, though? Are you feeling, like, burnt out? Are you feeling jaded? Are you feeling discouraged? Are you feeling optimistic? Are you feeling energetic?
00:08:54.570 - 00:08:57.590, Speaker A: All of the above. I don't feel burned out.
00:08:57.660 - 00:09:01.686, Speaker E: I think it'll probably take, like, these.
00:09:01.708 - 00:09:12.278, Speaker A: Cycles come and go, right? I think the 1819 cycle was really bad. People were really depressed and I don't.
00:09:12.294 - 00:09:16.062, Speaker E: Know, companies were just, like, shutting down left and right.
00:09:16.116 - 00:09:23.598, Speaker A: Like people that were true believers. So far, that's not happening. So there's a lot of energy that keeps you going. People are still coming up with crazy.
00:09:23.684 - 00:09:27.106, Speaker E: Ideas, like things that seem like they.
00:09:27.128 - 00:09:33.700, Speaker A: Have a one in a thousand shot of working, and they believe they're the ones that are going to crack it. Like Uber and Blockchain, right?
00:09:34.630 - 00:09:38.482, Speaker E: Stuff like that, I think is energizing.
00:09:38.546 - 00:10:03.580, Speaker A: Because that's kind of like evoking all of the promises and all the cool shit and of an open financial system built on open source software. And there's somebody with a lot of energy that's just driving it right now. That, to me, is, like, really energizing. All the shit that happened in 22 definitely is a drag and does burn you out.
00:10:04.350 - 00:10:40.140, Speaker C: Yeah, we definitely feel a lot of that as well. And Natalie, one of the things I think we want to do on this podcast today is tell the story of Salana pre 2021. I think a lot of people, a lot of the Salana community came into Salana in 2020 or 2021, but the story of Salana begins actually much earlier than that, and Bankless listeners will certainly know of mine and Ryan's bias towards ETH. And so for our own purposes, I'd also like to hear this story as well. So let's go back to the very beginning. Where does the story of Salana begin? Where was the inception moment for it.
00:10:42.990 - 00:11:04.180, Speaker A: I've been following crypto loosely. I thought it was cool to figure out if I could build, like, a faster miner. And my first experience, true experience with crypto was when forget the company, but they promised to ship you an ASIC and they mined all the bitcoin with the ASIC before shipping it to you. And I got the first taste of what crypto is all about.
00:11:05.110 - 00:11:07.938, Speaker C: But I the original front run.
00:11:08.024 - 00:11:10.706, Speaker A: Yeah, I thought it was kind of.
00:11:10.728 - 00:11:17.794, Speaker E: Silly, but I got it. My family left the Soviet Union.
00:11:17.842 - 00:11:20.294, Speaker A: They saw the full devastation of what.
00:11:20.412 - 00:11:24.962, Speaker E: A centralized, badly run economy and currency.
00:11:25.026 - 00:11:26.150, Speaker A: Can do to people.
00:11:26.220 - 00:11:29.514, Speaker E: And that belief of sound moneyness and.
00:11:29.552 - 00:11:58.834, Speaker A: What Bitcoin promised, I think, resonated with me. But I wasn't serious about it until 2017. When I saw that one, there was ethereum demonstrated that there's now, like, an application platform. And this is what I did my entire career. I build application platforms, like, everywhere. I worked qualcomm majority of my career. If folks ever had a flip phone and ever played any of those games, I wrote a bunch of code that made that possible.
00:11:58.834 - 00:12:05.410, Speaker A: I was a kernel engineer, brew and learned how to be an engineer in that environment.
00:12:06.390 - 00:12:09.574, Speaker E: So when 2017 came around and the.
00:12:09.612 - 00:12:30.954, Speaker A: Fees spiked across all these networks, is when I started Noodling on how do you make these things, these systems, fast and efficient and cheap while maintaining that property of trust minimization. And I literally had, like, tea, coffees and a beer. This is a true story. A cafe soleil. At that time, I had, like, this.
00:12:30.992 - 00:12:33.966, Speaker E: Cheesy side project with one of the.
00:12:33.988 - 00:12:52.226, Speaker A: Co founders, one of the folks who became a co founder of Solana. We were mining crypto while building deep learning hardware. We were into deep learning. We were putting up racks of GPUs and we were mining crypto with it in the background to pay for the GPUs. And we were just, like, arguing about proof of work.
00:12:52.328 - 00:12:53.886, Speaker E: Is it stupid?
00:12:54.078 - 00:13:00.086, Speaker A: Why are people paying for our GPUs? What is the point of all this?
00:13:00.188 - 00:13:01.398, Speaker E: And I had two coffees and a.
00:13:01.404 - 00:13:11.366, Speaker A: Beer, and I had this eureka moment that there's a way to encode passage of time as a data structure in a similar way that you encode entropy as a data structure.
00:13:11.398 - 00:13:15.210, Speaker E: In Bitcoin, you generate this difficulty like.
00:13:15.280 - 00:13:42.450, Speaker A: You solve the difficulty challenge, right? Like, you generate this long string of zeros. You can infer from that that a certain amount of energy was spent to generate that. And that means you've proven entropy, right there's. Some amount of energy was spent and the timepiece was, like, sequential, just run shaft sequentially. And I couldn't Google for it because I didn't know the term verifiable delay function. I didn't know that Dan Bonet and a bunch of other very smart people.
00:13:42.520 - 00:13:44.354, Speaker E: Working on this and that.
00:13:44.392 - 00:14:13.466, Speaker A: There's very sophisticated versions of this. But that was enough to make me think that I had something interesting, because that time component is very important for optimizing wireless networks. And if you think of censorship resistance as a communication channel, as a means for a user to send a message reliably to all the subscribers, that's what censorship resistance means, right? It guarantees delivery.
00:14:13.658 - 00:14:15.166, Speaker E: You can think of it as a.
00:14:15.188 - 00:14:39.940, Speaker A: Communication channel, and once you start thinking of it as a communication channel, there's a very obvious optimization called time division multiple access. This is what 2G cellular networks run on. The tricky part is the time part. How do you say that everybody agrees in a certain time? And that's a very pain in the ass problem to solve. There's a bunch of papers yeah, sorry, go ahead.
00:14:40.570 - 00:14:58.870, Speaker C: Because Ryan and I aren't developers. We kind of get it. But the Bankless Nation is also going to be largely non technical. Could we just really drill down on this Eureka moment that you're explaining and just make sure that we because this is the inception idea of Solana, so I want to make sure that we get this right. Could you just do this one more time and explain like I'm five?
00:14:58.940 - 00:15:30.138, Speaker A: So Solana came a little later, but I was just really obsessed with this kind of blown away by the Eureka moment that there's a way to encode passage of time as data. Because there's a lot of there is no mathematical explanation of time. There's no proof of arrow time moving in any direction. So it was in that sense, it jarred me and made me like, holy shit. I think there's something really fundamentally cool about these systems. Why it was really important for Solana.
00:15:30.174 - 00:15:34.274, Speaker E: Is because it's really hard to pick a leader.
00:15:34.322 - 00:15:52.974, Speaker A: It's really hard to make a block, to decide who's going to make blocks, and there's a whole bunch of ways to do it. And the way that Bitcoin does it is we solve this challenge. There's a puzzle and there's a difficulty such that only roughly one person in the world every ten minutes gets to solve it. And in Ethereum, they tuned proof of work to be I think as fast.
00:15:53.012 - 00:15:55.966, Speaker E: As proof of work could possibly be.
00:15:56.148 - 00:16:26.690, Speaker A: Was like one in 12 seconds. And that's still much, much slower than wireless five G, right? Or cellular networks or anything that we use in the world. And there's other ways to do this where you run consensus and then we elect a leader. Two thirds of the network agrees that Ryan gets to talk. Then after Ryan is done talking, two thirds of the network agrees that he's done talking, and then David gets to talk. And that's a very stepwise process. It requires a lot of communication, a lot of rounds.
00:16:26.690 - 00:16:28.054, Speaker A: And if you think of it, I.
00:16:28.092 - 00:16:31.002, Speaker E: Have X amount of bandwidth to use.
00:16:31.056 - 00:16:55.126, Speaker A: For messages, and Ryan gets to talk for 5 seconds, and then we run a whole bunch of junk that nobody gets to talk to, to select David that's a very inefficient use of that bandwidth. That's a very inefficiently used channel. And this is why wireless protocols, they basically create a schedule and say from millisecond zero to millisecond 100, ryan gets to talk, then David, then Anatoly.
00:16:55.178 - 00:16:58.274, Speaker E: And if you miss your slot, too bad, right?
00:16:58.312 - 00:17:17.526, Speaker A: The network just keeps going. But as long as everyone is up and running and talking, there is no gaps, right? There's no election process. Nobody has to wait for a random event. You just get to transmit and that basically gives you nearly 100% utilization of the hardware resources that you have.
00:17:17.708 - 00:17:54.706, Speaker C: And just to really drill down on this point, this is the main architectural difference that separates Solana from, I think, almost every single other blockchain that really exists. And this is why, if people have been following me on Twitter, I've given a lot more credence to Solana than I have other EVM clones, like Avalanche phantom EVM clones, I don't really find very interesting unless they become layer twos on Ethereum. This is actually, I think, something that's actually interesting in the fact that it is actually a completely different design space that is unique and specifically created by Solana. Is that a fair take?
00:17:54.808 - 00:17:58.150, Speaker A: Yes. No one else has gone this crazy route.
00:17:59.050 - 00:18:21.610, Speaker C: And the idea is that in proof of work and also proof of stake, the next person to propose a block is pretty random. In Ethereum's current form, it's actually selected, but it's selected randomly, which is different than Solana. Can you go into the difference of how proof of stake leader election is selected and then how that's still different? In Salana?
00:18:22.510 - 00:18:32.014, Speaker A: I don't want to misspeak about Ethereum because I'm not 100% up on the latest design. But tendermint is like the simplest way to think about it is that you.
00:18:32.052 - 00:18:37.358, Speaker E: Have, let's say, 100 validators. In Tendermint, they all have one vote.
00:18:37.454 - 00:18:39.118, Speaker A: And then two thirds of them vote.
00:18:39.214 - 00:18:41.566, Speaker E: And vote on a block.
00:18:41.678 - 00:19:02.246, Speaker A: There's a known block producer that's next. But what's not known is whether the block producer is going to succeed or not. Let's say that's David. So we wait for David to produce a block and then everybody says, hey, I did see a block from David. Let's all agree that we all saw a block from David, okay? We all saw the block. Let's agree that the block was good. And then Ryan gets to do there's.
00:19:02.278 - 00:19:23.810, Speaker C: A there's a block that's proposed and then there's a round of verification, and then there's a round of verification of that round of verification. And that's the last step. And then the next step is another block is proposed and this design structure is able to let Solana optimize for bandwidth versus proof of work or proof of whatever Ethereum's proof of stake flavor is.
00:19:23.880 - 00:19:48.914, Speaker A: Basically, yes, you know all the leaders ahead of time too. But you have this stepwise agreement. Did David succeed or not in Salana? We don't really care. David has 100 milliseconds, 400 milliseconds to transmit. If he transmitted, great. If he didn't, too bad, right? The network moves on and then somebody else goes. Now there's still forks that happen logically.
00:19:48.914 - 00:20:18.074, Speaker A: So when David proposes a block, he's got to attach it to some previous forks that he observed, and then everybody votes and agrees, was that the heaviest fork or not? And stuff like that. But nobody waits for anybody to start transmitting. It just kind of goes no matter what happens. And that's in an optimistic sense, which actually happens 99.9% of the time. Supermajority of the network is live. Nobody votes on a different fork.
00:20:18.074 - 00:20:36.518, Speaker A: There's no forking. Everybody just transmits and votes. And the blocks occur very quickly. And you utilize 100% of the bandwidth available to the node. So if you have 1000 validators, all of them have one gigabit of bandwidth. That's not a lot. That's a 22 year old standard at this point.
00:20:36.518 - 00:21:13.870, Speaker A: I have one gigabit at my house. You have a lot of capacity for transactions. Like, in the most optimal case in my stupid white paper, I said, I think we can stuff 700,000 transactions in there. Realistically. I think with the way Internet operates and erasure coding and all the other stuff, you can cut that in the worst case by four. And it doesn't matter how many nodes you have. If you have 1000 or 40,000, because of how the blocks propagate, we can actually utilize that one gigabit bi directionally between all the nodes.
00:21:13.870 - 00:21:34.934, Speaker A: And let's say that's 200,000 transactions per second of bandwidth available, right? Then how do you use it? That's kind of like the big question is how do you actually process it? How do you manage all the state and all of the signature verification and all this other crud?
00:21:35.062 - 00:21:38.554, Speaker E: And this is where the reason why.
00:21:38.592 - 00:22:10.934, Speaker A: I started building Solana is once I realized that I think we have a design that can utilize all the bandwidth available to the hardware. The other hard problems that are left were basically the bread and butter of my career and all the folks that are worked at Qualcomm. How do you get silicon to process a shitload of data as fast as you can and execute as many programs, system calls, move memory from one part of the state to another as possible? I'm sure you guys can imagine people that work at operating systems, this is what they do day in, day out.
00:22:10.972 - 00:22:13.030, Speaker C: And this is this is a known quantity.
00:22:13.610 - 00:22:22.314, Speaker A: And this is why I was like, okay, I see the light at the end of the tunnel. We have a design that is a.
00:22:22.352 - 00:22:26.486, Speaker E: Unique way of utilizing that gets rid.
00:22:26.518 - 00:22:57.382, Speaker A: Of the overhead of consensus. It can utilize bandwidth that's available to all the machines to whatever limit those machines have. And that's an exponentially growing limit every two years that gets cheaper or bigger. And the rest of the problems are problems that I'm very familiar with. Like I know how to solve the memory problems, the runtime issues, like the parallelism, all of this stuff. And that's what drove me to go, basically take the leap, become a founder, try to raise money. And I got pretty lucky there.
00:22:57.436 - 00:23:01.062, Speaker E: I had basically a bunch of friends.
00:23:01.116 - 00:23:24.462, Speaker A: At Qualcomm that I worked with for over a decade. And at that time, Broadcom was trying to acquire Qualcomm. Apple was suing them, and they had to call President Trump to stop the acquisition. So it's like kind of low morale internally. And I called a bunch of people and I was like, hey, we're going to build an operating system. We've done this before. It's a new developer platform.
00:23:24.462 - 00:23:59.820, Speaker A: It's for these things called smart contracts. Nobody knows what they're for, but Ethereum is worth a bajillion dollars. So I think we can build something cool and unique. So I never thought of building an Ethereum killer. We never marketed as like, this is the fastest smart contract platform. Our pitch was like, we think smart contracts are good for finance. I think there's an application for finance, and I think finance depends on information propagating as fast as possible around the world.
00:23:59.820 - 00:24:03.500, Speaker A: Those are valid assumptions, right?
00:24:04.750 - 00:24:06.860, Speaker C: That's a Solana thesis, right?
00:24:08.190 - 00:24:19.310, Speaker A: The niche that we were trying to build is that because of our unique consensus design, we can guarantee that if you're participating in the network that you're receiving, state as fast as everyone else.
00:24:19.460 - 00:24:23.454, Speaker E: And edits, like, best limit 20 years.
00:24:23.492 - 00:24:52.442, Speaker A: Of the best engineers, like, crank away at building. Salana when you transmit a transaction, it's going to get sent to the nearest leader. You can have multiple leaders at the same time. You don't need to schedule only one. You can actually schedule N, so that gap, geographical gap, that latency is minimized. And then that leader propagates that information around the world simultaneously to everybody. So that information is moving basically as fast as a newswire can travel around the world.
00:24:52.442 - 00:25:31.320, Speaker A: So for markets, that's very important. Some event happens in Singapore, that newswire literally is flying through fiber to a trader in New York. By the time that trader looks at a market running on Solana or one running at Nizi, the prices are the same because that state transition to change the price for the news is already propagating as well. That means that we can be competitive with these monopolies on how execution and finance and everything else happens in tradefi with open source software and hardware, like run by volunteers. So that's the pitch. That was the cool thing.
00:25:31.850 - 00:26:09.250, Speaker B: Anatolia one net effect of this. So this kind of consensus change that Solana has kind of pioneered in that universe, it sounds like it's really kind of maximizing. You said maximizing the bandwidth available, right. And that's specifically a bandwidth for validators. Does the net effect of that mean that if you're running a Solana validator, your bandwidth requirements are going to be higher than, say, a validator from another ecosystem, say an Ethereum validator. It's like, do you need that one gigabit per second kind of connection and do you need that to increase over time? Is that sort of a trade off here?
00:26:09.320 - 00:26:28.226, Speaker A: Well, the way that Ethereum right now works, you kind of have the same bandwidth requirements across all nodes, but with actually, this is where the scalability that goes beyond what Solana can do with Ethereum is when you shard the chain.
00:26:28.338 - 00:26:31.606, Speaker E: You have these quorums that are separate.
00:26:31.718 - 00:26:35.834, Speaker A: They have their own bandwidth requirements and those could be, let's say, much lower.
00:26:36.032 - 00:26:40.378, Speaker E: And they finalize the block. But they don't need to transmit the.
00:26:40.384 - 00:27:11.906, Speaker A: Entire block to every other shard. You only transmit a portion of it. And because you transmit a portion to different parts of the network, you can infer that I have honest minority guarantees that no data was withheld by the shard and if this shard transmitted a faulty state transition, that somebody could detect it because we have guarantees that data was propagated everywhere. But those guarantees you can achieve with sublinear bandwidth. And that's the advantage.
00:27:12.018 - 00:27:15.606, Speaker E: But all of these steps are going.
00:27:15.628 - 00:27:36.746, Speaker A: To be much, much slower than the newswire going from Singapore to A. So like, those are all great and I think that's a pretty clever design. I mean, I love Doncrad. I talk to him all the time whenever I have questions about how did you guys solve this problem in Ethereum? It's like a beautiful design, but doesn't.
00:27:36.778 - 00:27:52.850, Speaker B: Do it's like is it part of the Solana mandate or vision or dream to ever have validators? Being able to run from a phone, for example? Ethereum would say it is like validators should be able to run from people's bandwidth constraints.
00:27:53.190 - 00:27:59.110, Speaker A: Can you define a validator in Ethereum? Because is that like the consensus client or the full node?
00:27:59.690 - 00:28:06.310, Speaker C: Well, that is somebody who adds a block to the chain producer. A block producer? Yeah.
00:28:06.460 - 00:28:10.082, Speaker A: You can run a block producer that doesn't have the full state on Solana.
00:28:10.146 - 00:28:12.898, Speaker E: So that there's like A basically like.
00:28:12.924 - 00:28:17.542, Speaker A: A block producer only really needs to propose transactions that go into a block.
00:28:17.686 - 00:28:19.066, Speaker E: Pick the ones that they think are.
00:28:19.088 - 00:28:27.280, Speaker A: Going to get them the highest ROI so they can guess whether those are valid or not. They don't actually need to have full access to the state.
00:28:27.970 - 00:28:32.400, Speaker E: But trustlessness comes from at least one.
00:28:32.710 - 00:28:38.194, Speaker A: Full node that has the state and can evaluate all the state transitions and.
00:28:38.232 - 00:28:41.122, Speaker E: Say that this is the correct answer.
00:28:41.256 - 00:28:55.446, Speaker A: And then tell you, hey, the majority fucked up. And then either at least say that or find the exact bisect where the majority fucked up and give you a proof that they A. I would love.
00:28:55.468 - 00:29:18.640, Speaker B: A whole separate kind of conversation on this almost from somebody from the kind of the engineering side on Ethereum and you Anatoly. But we'll say that because David and I are not the engineers. I think we'll save that for. Another date. But I can say that kind of the pitch that you just talked about in 2018 is sort of what I heard from what Salana was trying to become. I remember one thing.
00:29:19.330 - 00:29:21.534, Speaker A: Salana is a layer two on Ethereum, right?
00:29:21.572 - 00:29:59.740, Speaker B: Athana yeah, maybe. Did I flip that? Well, I remember hearing about Salana in 2018, and here's the thing that kind of threw me, and this is another maybe philosophy sort of difference. And I can't say that everyone in Ethereum feels this way about ETH, the asset, but certainly many people do. And this comes from a little bit of the Bitcoin school, which is Bitcoin is money. ETH is also money that's central for the economic security of the network. And I remember talking to Salana people in 2018 as this network was being propped up. And I was very, at the time, also interested in the Cosmos ecosystem and a few others.
00:29:59.740 - 00:30:38.300, Speaker B: And I asked the question to kind of the early Salana startup team, hey, is Sol trying to become money? And the answer is always no, not trying to become money. In fact, I heard similar from Cosmos about the atom token. So the atom token was never meant to be sort of a store of value type of thing. And I think that's kind of been consistent with what you've said about the sole token too, is you don't see it as a store of value, as a money in the same way, maybe Bitcoiners certainly see their asset as money. And I think increasingly much of the Ethereum community also sees ETH as money. Can you talk about that difference in philosophy in the early days?
00:30:39.230 - 00:30:39.594, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:30:39.632 - 00:30:50.620, Speaker A: So imagine a world where everyone had a magical radio that can never be interfered with or obstructed and could transmit to everybody in the world.
00:30:50.990 - 00:30:53.738, Speaker E: That's a world without censorship.
00:30:53.834 - 00:31:16.702, Speaker A: Right? I can push a button and transmit to everybody in the world. You don't need proof of work anymore to build a blockchain. You have a censorship resistant channel. I can guarantee that messages arrive to everybody. So the store of value part you can build on top of a censorship resistant channel. I think store of value is a social construct. It's a meme.
00:31:16.702 - 00:31:22.194, Speaker A: It's like something that people believe in. I think that's awesome. And I honestly think it's very useful.
00:31:22.242 - 00:31:24.646, Speaker E: To have a store of value that.
00:31:24.668 - 00:31:32.586, Speaker A: Is not tied to any sovereign, given the shit show that happened in the Soviet Union. Right. If you experience that one time in.
00:31:32.608 - 00:31:33.340, Speaker E: Your life.
00:31:36.590 - 00:31:56.270, Speaker A: You know that it can happen again. Right. But it doesn't need to be tied to the consensus layer. And functionally, what the layer one chain needs to do is to prevent spam. And that's what the token does. It prevents spam. Everything else is like, I can't code it up into a store of value.
00:31:56.270 - 00:31:58.462, Speaker A: There's no code change it can make.
00:31:58.596 - 00:31:59.922, Speaker E: Solana is a store of value.
00:31:59.976 - 00:32:03.266, Speaker A: So I think it's kind of dumb for me to try to meme it.
00:32:03.288 - 00:32:06.280, Speaker E: Into that, doesn't it also, though, provide.
00:32:07.450 - 00:32:18.038, Speaker B: Security for the underlying solana chain? Security of the underlying solana chain. And some of those censorship resistant properties are based on the value.
00:32:18.204 - 00:32:21.260, Speaker A: What is security? The market cap of can you define security.
00:32:23.310 - 00:32:26.598, Speaker C: Blockchain immutability? Yeah. And liveness.
00:32:26.694 - 00:32:32.080, Speaker B: The ability to not like, not reversing blocks is definitely a key property here.
00:32:33.570 - 00:32:39.214, Speaker C: Sorry. The economic cost of how much it costs to go backwards in blocks right. Is economic security.
00:32:39.412 - 00:32:55.730, Speaker A: Well, with the proof of stake network, once a block is finalized, going backwards is invalid. So you can create two forks and that means the majority created a fault and then you got to resolve it. But let's say 100% of the Validators were compromised.
00:32:56.070 - 00:33:00.866, Speaker E: All of them were compromised and there's.
00:33:00.898 - 00:33:06.194, Speaker A: Nothing they can do to convince Circle to wire out your dollars from your bank account without your signature.
00:33:06.322 - 00:33:06.662, Speaker E: Right.
00:33:06.716 - 00:33:08.338, Speaker A: Circle runs a full node.
00:33:08.514 - 00:33:09.514, Speaker E: They're running in there.
00:33:09.552 - 00:33:29.358, Speaker A: It's secure, it's unstaked, it's just seeing what these compromised Validators are sending them. There's no way they can send it invalid state transitions. So security of the network is based on this idea that if I run my full node, I can process all the Valid state transitions and I know the exact state.
00:33:29.524 - 00:33:34.714, Speaker E: Now creating a fork, right?
00:33:34.772 - 00:33:48.646, Speaker A: Creating a duplicate fork, that's an attack that you can think of as like, I'm mining bitcoin in my hidden nuclear bunker and then I'm going to roll back the last 50 blocks or the last 24 hours.
00:33:48.828 - 00:33:49.222, Speaker E: Right?
00:33:49.276 - 00:34:07.142, Speaker A: That's the economic security of a proof of work chain in a proof of stake chain. It's kind of harder concept because once everyone that's finalized finance Circle, all the full nodes finalize something, all the honest full nodes finalize something, they're going to reject any other fork that's proposed.
00:34:07.286 - 00:34:10.654, Speaker E: They don't have this consensus hook that.
00:34:10.692 - 00:34:26.434, Speaker A: Says, oh, if somebody proposes a heavier majority signature, we're going to throw away our state that we accepted and blow away all the money that was made. All the honest nodes that are not.
00:34:26.472 - 00:34:31.826, Speaker E: Partitioned are basically going to halt now the network is stuck and humans go.
00:34:31.848 - 00:34:40.854, Speaker A: In and they're like, well, what the fuck happened? Did the majority double sign invalid? Like make an invalid double signature or something else and they resolve it.
00:34:40.892 - 00:34:44.662, Speaker E: And that process is not based on.
00:34:44.716 - 00:34:52.620, Speaker A: The amount of tokens involved, what percentage or the value of them. It's going to be messy. It's going to involve a bunch of humans. Right.
00:34:53.470 - 00:35:02.480, Speaker B: So then from your perspective and what you're describing, does it make any difference for the economic security of Salana if the sole token is like, say, $0.10 versus if it's $10.
00:35:05.010 - 00:35:16.000, Speaker A: With regards to safety? No, it doesn't. The likelihood of malicious, let's say the token was like 1,000,000th of a penny, right?
00:35:17.350 - 00:35:21.906, Speaker E: The attacker could cause a liveness failure. They could be like, okay, I am.
00:35:21.928 - 00:35:24.686, Speaker A: Going to buy two thirds of the tokens, and then I'm going to halt.
00:35:24.718 - 00:35:26.454, Speaker E: The network or I'm going to create.
00:35:26.492 - 00:35:33.254, Speaker A: A double fork and then cause this messy process to run. And the network is going to have to be down for like, three days.
00:35:33.372 - 00:35:35.560, Speaker E: That sucks, right?
00:35:36.250 - 00:35:56.510, Speaker A: So the value of the coin maybe prevents for these liveness failures that are messy and annoying, but it doesn't in itself prevent. It doesn't guarantee security. There's no way. The value of the coin has impact on circles, dollars that are stuck in a bank that are governed by this full node.
00:35:57.570 - 00:36:12.434, Speaker C: I think listeners can definitely see some of the philosophical differences that me and Ryan share about Etha's money versus the soul token, but I think that's a fun exploration. But I think there's much more of the overall Solana story that I want to get back on track to.
00:36:12.472 - 00:36:14.610, Speaker E: I think a store of value that.
00:36:14.680 - 00:36:16.726, Speaker A: Is awesome could be built on top.
00:36:16.748 - 00:36:20.678, Speaker E: Of Solana and could surpass, like, I.
00:36:20.684 - 00:36:23.974, Speaker A: Don'T I don't see a reason why that wouldn't be right.
00:36:24.092 - 00:36:24.662, Speaker E: Right.
00:36:24.796 - 00:36:45.198, Speaker C: I want to pick up Anatolia, the story back because okay, so we have this inception of Solana, the architecture and the implied existence of the so I want to pick up the story again at the very beginning. Where did Solana go from an idea to an actual Solana labs and all of this? Can you run us through that part of the story?
00:36:45.364 - 00:36:45.694, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:36:45.732 - 00:36:51.518, Speaker A: So I had this idea for a VDF, which I didn't know was called a Verifiable delay function.
00:36:51.684 - 00:36:53.374, Speaker E: But it was like, what jarred me.
00:36:53.412 - 00:36:59.998, Speaker A: Out of being a day to day worker to I think I should go build a company in crypto.
00:37:00.174 - 00:37:01.620, Speaker E: So I quit my job.
00:37:03.110 - 00:37:26.346, Speaker A: Being in San Francisco at the time, you're kind of connected to people in Silicon Valley that are VCs just by being here as an engineer. One of my friends, through underwater hockey it's a weird sport that I play, was working at 500 Startups, and he was like, Dude, I'll give you I forget. It was like, which is more money than anyone has ever given me to.
00:37:26.368 - 00:37:29.174, Speaker E: Do anything just on a handshake.
00:37:29.222 - 00:38:07.398, Speaker A: And I was like, holy shit. That's like, enough money for me to be on Ramen for six months. I can code a lot. If I had, like I can write a lot of code in six months and actually see if this thing could but I with the help of my partner, Laura, she's like, you got to do this for real. There's a moment in time that happened with social networks, with search engines, with whatever, where there's a lot of ideas and a lot of people entering a space and you have to take it seriously and go raise and stuff. And that's when I got connected to Raj. And he has raised money before.
00:38:07.398 - 00:38:11.226, Speaker A: He's not an engineer. He was like, oh, yeah, I'll help you.
00:38:11.248 - 00:38:15.626, Speaker E: And he drilled me on making the.
00:38:15.648 - 00:38:18.380, Speaker A: Deck and doing the pitches and.
00:38:20.510 - 00:38:20.874, Speaker E: That.
00:38:20.912 - 00:38:36.100, Speaker A: Was, like, whole part of the process. It was the first time I ever talked to anyone, and it felt really awkward telling him, hey, I have this idea. Nothing's built yet, no proof, but give me hundreds of thousands of dollars so I can go hire my friends and go build this thing.
00:38:37.190 - 00:38:41.874, Speaker C: What were the initial raise details? Like, how much did Salona raise on day one?
00:38:42.072 - 00:38:49.878, Speaker A: We were trying to raise 500K. That was, like, my target. The price at that time for the.
00:38:49.884 - 00:38:54.214, Speaker E: Network was 20 million, which I thought was ludicrous. Yeah.
00:38:54.332 - 00:38:55.714, Speaker C: Oh, you thought that was ludicrous?
00:38:55.762 - 00:38:56.454, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:56.652 - 00:39:02.006, Speaker C: After going after coming through, 2020 million sounds extremely reasonable.
00:39:02.198 - 00:39:04.470, Speaker A: Think about it as like, a first time founder.
00:39:04.550 - 00:39:08.586, Speaker E: You guys are first time founder, all.
00:39:08.608 - 00:39:09.914, Speaker A: You have is an idea.
00:39:10.112 - 00:39:10.762, Speaker E: Right?
00:39:10.896 - 00:39:30.382, Speaker A: Typical raises in Silicon Valley are, like, for that kind of valuation, is you have traction. You're like, hey, we have this amount of revenue. We have growth. When you guys invest in us, that revenue is going to go up. That's the pitch. But that valuation, that was not, like, my pitch.
00:39:30.446 - 00:39:35.218, Speaker E: But I thought it was, like, scary high.
00:39:35.304 - 00:39:41.480, Speaker A: But if it was any lower, there's no way we could have funded a team to go build anything.
00:39:42.330 - 00:39:51.260, Speaker C: And I'm assuming that's what happened next, like, started building out a team. How many employees did you guys hire in that first wave before you had to do round number two?
00:39:52.110 - 00:40:03.420, Speaker A: About five people, which were all basically co founders because they were so early. And these were folks that I worked with at Qualcomm for a long time.
00:40:04.830 - 00:40:08.110, Speaker B: I think that's still fewer co founders than Ethereum, though.
00:40:08.180 - 00:40:11.054, Speaker C: Yeah, probably have better.
00:40:11.172 - 00:41:01.566, Speaker A: I basically called in all the favors that I had with my colleagues that I've worked with over a decade. Getting folks that are worked ten plus years on GPU optimization to leave their very career effectively, like, pause their career at a big company and go do the startup was like a big ask. But yeah, I got lucky with timing. We did another raise in May, so we built a bunch of stuff, and we built the first Solana node, like, a single node that could show, hey, look, we're processing signature verification in parallel. It's doing profit history. It was doing like hundreds of thousands signature verifications per second because we beefed this box out with GPUs and whatever. And our thesis was like, look, if.
00:41:01.588 - 00:41:03.646, Speaker E: A single node can do this the.
00:41:03.668 - 00:41:27.570, Speaker A: Way that the network is designed, that the network is going to run as slow as the slowest node in the supermajority. So if a single node can be this fast, it means that the slowest node in the supermajority can be this fast. So by design, it should scale to that. And that was enough. I think we caught the last vapors of the 2017 bull market. This was like May 2018. ETH was dropping.
00:41:27.570 - 00:41:33.820, Speaker A: Funds were closing and stuff like that, but we were able to raise an A around, like, about 14 million.
00:41:34.670 - 00:41:36.006, Speaker C: 14 million valuation?
00:41:36.118 - 00:41:38.374, Speaker A: No, like 14 million raise.
00:41:38.422 - 00:41:39.386, Speaker C: Yeah. Right. Okay.
00:41:39.488 - 00:41:39.754, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:41:39.792 - 00:42:06.342, Speaker C: And bankless listeners will know, like, Ryan and I have talked about the depths of the 2018 to 2020 bear market and how different it is from this bear market. That bear market was dry. Funding absolutely dried up. And so to say, I really just want to drive that point home. There were fumes when it came to the private market funding in that era, and so I'm sure fighting for that $14 million was not easy.
00:42:06.476 - 00:42:11.794, Speaker A: So what was cool was that people slam us for being a VC chain.
00:42:11.842 - 00:42:15.398, Speaker E: But even from those early days, there.
00:42:15.404 - 00:42:23.446, Speaker A: Were a lot of validators that were part of it. People out of Cosmos that were like, hey, we run Cosmos validators.
00:42:23.478 - 00:42:25.594, Speaker E: We know how this stuff works, and.
00:42:25.632 - 00:42:37.630, Speaker A: This is cool and weird. That was basically like, they made money on these other networks and were like, this is so weird. Just based on that invested.
00:42:38.610 - 00:42:41.406, Speaker E: Some of those folks were like, they.
00:42:41.428 - 00:42:50.580, Speaker A: Were all the first ones to run nodes and the first ones to go help us find data centers to actually deal with us and stuff like that.
00:42:51.030 - 00:43:25.710, Speaker B: One of the other points I would say about the kind of the VC chain charges, honestly, 2018 for people who are around. There was no other way to do it. How else do you the climate at that time was like post ethereum ICO, which sort of broke the glass on this, but the opportunity really closed up. Like, there was no compliant way to do this, at least in the US. And so it's very difficult to see how a chain could have raised post 2018 in the way the ethereum ICO raised.
00:43:26.290 - 00:43:26.750, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:43:26.820 - 00:43:44.180, Speaker A: And being in the US. Unlike with kids, I was like, I want to just not get arrested. Yeah, exactly. I think lucky enough, but a lot of our competitors raised, like, hundreds of millions of dollars.
00:43:46.010 - 00:43:48.466, Speaker E: Which is who are your competitors, Hashgraph?
00:43:48.498 - 00:43:58.794, Speaker A: I mean, people that you don't remember at this point. There were, like, very big rounds for layer ones being filled, and a lot.
00:43:58.832 - 00:44:02.666, Speaker E: Of folks were, like, thought that we.
00:44:02.688 - 00:44:04.554, Speaker A: Were not just not going to make.
00:44:04.592 - 00:44:07.306, Speaker E: It because there were just too many.
00:44:07.328 - 00:44:09.770, Speaker A: Competitors that were too well funded.
00:44:10.110 - 00:44:42.520, Speaker C: There's an article that an employee out of Salana Labs wrote not too long ago and released it the December 20 eigth of 2022. And there's a line in here that I want to get your get your take on. What exists in the Salana ecosystem now was created by the need to build to build everything fast, launch the network before Labs ran out of cash, ride the wave of the crypto expansion, and create an ecosystem at parity with other older siblings in record time. Would you say that's a fair characterization of the vibe of Salana in the early days.
00:44:43.290 - 00:45:01.050, Speaker A: The lack of 100 million dollar funding in the early days made us prioritize things like wolves, I guess. I wish we had EVM support, but it's expensive to build in a way that wouldn't triple the network's performance.
00:45:02.450 - 00:45:03.566, Speaker E: Would Solana be here?
00:45:03.588 - 00:45:30.486, Speaker A: Would you guys be talking to me now? If we were like an EVM chain that was marginally faster consensus than ethereum, nobody would care. So stuff like that got cut. And how do you bootstrap an ecosystem without piggybacking off ethereum? Devs was like a big unknown. So that was a difficult challenge and we were just throwing everything against the.
00:45:30.508 - 00:45:31.750, Speaker E: Wall that could stick.
00:45:32.890 - 00:45:43.180, Speaker C: Was there a moment where Salana was racing to stay alive and then that moment happened where you realized that you were going to make it? What was that moment?
00:45:45.390 - 00:46:02.094, Speaker A: I hate to say it, but 2020 we were like 910 months of cash left. So the market crashed. We announced your coin list auction march twelveTH, I think, or something like that. We announced that it was going to.
00:46:02.292 - 00:46:03.600, Speaker E: Be a week later.
00:46:04.290 - 00:46:14.146, Speaker A: March 16 is when the markets crashed. And I was like, Fuck, we are so dead. But I was just too exhausted to delay, and we really didn't have an.
00:46:14.168 - 00:46:17.010, Speaker E: Option at that time.
00:46:17.080 - 00:46:30.826, Speaker A: There was no bridge around coming. The funds that we thought could back us were also like, holy fuck, we've never seen anything like this before, so we have no advice to give you. So we decided to launch because I.
00:46:30.848 - 00:46:33.926, Speaker E: Think my theory was that the worst.
00:46:33.958 - 00:47:04.546, Speaker A: Time to launch would have been right before the crash. So if we launch right after, there's a chance that this is like a huge overcorrection. And then we just see at least a medium upswing, and that turned out to be like the bottom of the bottom. And then started the crazy bull run. So that was pretty wild. And then we started seeing, I would say the second hackathon is when I thought that we had real traction, because you saw some teams from the first hackathon that were just fucking around with.
00:47:04.568 - 00:47:07.986, Speaker E: The network and built very cheesy dumb.
00:47:08.018 - 00:47:10.760, Speaker A: Apps that didn't do anything.
00:47:12.010 - 00:47:13.782, Speaker E: You vote to have like a fight.
00:47:13.836 - 00:47:23.018, Speaker A: Or fight chain or something like that. Some of those folks came back and started building like DeFi mango and whatever, and I was like, okay.
00:47:23.104 - 00:47:27.130, Speaker E: People actually didn't hate the runtime.
00:47:27.790 - 00:47:40.190, Speaker A: They got something out of it and they had an idea that was unique and they built it. And I thought there was something there basically after the second hackathon.
00:47:41.090 - 00:47:45.266, Speaker C: And when did Multicoin Capital step into the picture? What round were they?
00:47:45.368 - 00:47:46.514, Speaker A: They were in the early days.
00:47:46.632 - 00:47:46.914, Speaker C: Okay.
00:47:46.952 - 00:47:47.540, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:48.310 - 00:47:51.810, Speaker C: Was that the $12 million or the one before that?
00:47:51.880 - 00:48:18.780, Speaker A: No, the 20,000. Yeah, this was like so we ended up we wanted to raise 500K. We had it verbally committed. Then ETH dropped like 30% in one day and all these funds pulled out. But we managed to actually end up raising about 3 million during that round after a lot of hustling and conversations. But there was like a moment that I was like, okay fuck, I think maybe this is not going to happen.
00:48:20.830 - 00:48:31.870, Speaker C: Okay, so we're coming out of the depths of COVID salon is starting to get traction. You mentioned two hackathons where the second one started to produce real outcomes. How fast did things accelerate?
00:48:35.350 - 00:48:37.842, Speaker A: Yeah, things started moving pretty quickly because.
00:48:37.896 - 00:48:42.850, Speaker E: We were focused on driving more hackathons.
00:48:44.070 - 00:49:28.980, Speaker A: We did another one and twice as many people showed up. I don't know the exact numbers, but it was a significant bump from the previous one, from the second one to the third one. There was a significant number increase in registrations and teams that completed and the quality of the teams went up and that was basically when we had our Announcer conference breakpoint and breakpoint. The first one was pretty cool. There were a lot of people that showed up that were just, I think high in the Euphoria, the bull market and not as many builders. But the cool thing there was that you kind of had like a bunch of the devs on their own.
00:49:29.430 - 00:49:31.186, Speaker E: They got a space and they called.
00:49:31.208 - 00:49:33.780, Speaker A: It a hacker house and they just.
00:49:34.150 - 00:49:37.490, Speaker E: Ran away from all the bull market.
00:49:37.560 - 00:49:42.758, Speaker A: People and just coded on their own.
00:49:42.924 - 00:49:55.978, Speaker C: This seems a lot like the Ethereum community in 2017 where Vitalik got exasperated with I remember Vitalik saying I will leave this space. If we keep talking about Lambos and Mooncoins, it kind of sounds like a.
00:49:55.984 - 00:50:44.298, Speaker A: Little bit like yeah, and that was pretty cool because again, we just then copied that model. It was like, okay, there's a bunch of devs that actually want to go build stuff. Why don't we run these hacker houses from one city to the next? And then we did a bunch of hacker houses and hackathons and that year of doing hacker houses and hackathons leading up to breakpoint, even though the market turned around and everything started dumping, was actually pretty awesome. There's a lot of stuff got built, there was a lot of devs. The whole NFT space happened during that cycle. Magic Indian didn't exist. Phantom actually became, I think, a pretty awesome wallet that everyone I think knows about at this point if not used.
00:50:44.298 - 00:50:56.830, Speaker A: So a bunch of really cool stuff happened and the second breakpoint was awesome. It's like 40 teams that were building games. We didn't have a games things. Even at the first breakpoint.
00:50:58.770 - 00:51:04.142, Speaker E: The number of attendees went up by nearly doubled.
00:51:04.206 - 00:51:05.294, Speaker A: From the first breakpoint.
00:51:05.342 - 00:51:09.806, Speaker E: So despite this market drop of Salana's.
00:51:09.838 - 00:51:31.130, Speaker A: Peak down to whatever, $30 was a 95% drop right by the number of attendees to the conference nearly doubled. The number of devs that showed up was like 1600. It was a pretty awesome vibes up until the very last day is when on the flight back, everyone started seeing the shit show with FTX.
00:51:31.790 - 00:52:16.840, Speaker C: Yeah, we'll get there. But I want to cover really like this throughout 2000 and 22,021, because salana the sole price between the start of 2021 to the end of 2021 did probably perhaps the craziest thing any crypto token has ever, almost ever done, ever, which is like, go up 20,000% in a little bit over a year. And I would imagine that went from like, salana thinking about like, damn, we're running on fumes, are we going to make it? We need to get through this. To like, oh my god, everyone's here, what the hell is going on? Can you walk us through that? Part of that transition from a to?
00:52:17.210 - 00:52:20.586, Speaker A: So, like, I think part of the reason of that is that because we.
00:52:20.608 - 00:52:25.738, Speaker E: Were an underdog earlier, even compared to.
00:52:25.824 - 00:52:43.186, Speaker A: The cohort of competitors like avalanche and ear and all those guys, they raised at higher valuations from VCs, raised more capital at us. When they launched, their entry price was higher. Salana's coinless auction to launch was cleared at like, what is that, 104,000,000 or.
00:52:43.208 - 00:52:45.166, Speaker E: Something like that, which is what bitcoin.
00:52:45.198 - 00:53:11.610, Speaker A: Was worth when it was just listed on mount gox. There was no hype at that point. So the delta from that to, I think we passed the cohort avalanche and ethereum. Not ethereum avalanche and near and a bunch of those other folks in polkadot that I think was surprising to everybody. And that's, I think, part of the reason of these massive multiples.
00:53:12.750 - 00:53:25.040, Speaker C: Do you think it's fair in the contrast to other chains like phantom avalanche, like nier? Do you think calling solana a VC coin is fair if we're not calling those chains VC coins too?
00:53:27.090 - 00:53:28.062, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:53:28.196 - 00:53:32.190, Speaker C: To what degree do you say that that's like a fair branding?
00:53:33.490 - 00:54:18.682, Speaker A: I know that's a hard, very dumb thing about this whole VC narrative is that the crypto VCs in 2018, nearly all of them were people that invested in the ethereum ICO, and that's how they became VCs. These were literally the ethereum backers that believed in smart contract platforms and saw the future of this tech. They made big bets in the ethereum ICO. They wrote it to 1300 in 2017 and they created a fund. Nearly all of these folks that were like the VCs of that era came from that, like a 16 z and a bunch of these other folks were not super active at the time. So that's kind of like, I think, the weird branding.
00:54:18.826 - 00:54:19.374, Speaker E: Sure.
00:54:19.492 - 00:54:36.390, Speaker A: I don't know, I don't really care about the VC branding. I think it's just pretty dumb to begin with. Are there institutionals that hold a shitload of ETH? Probably. Does that make it a trade fight chain? No, it's the people building stuff that make the chain.
00:54:37.770 - 00:55:00.300, Speaker C: So what was it like? Because Ryan and I have experienced this, whenever you experience success, you start to get haters, right? And perhaps Ryan and I contributed to that to whatever degree we did. I'm sorry, but when did the ETH Maxi crowd come in and what was that like to be on the receiving end of that?
00:55:01.710 - 00:55:06.474, Speaker E: It was honestly not, I guess, stuff.
00:55:06.512 - 00:55:32.530, Speaker A: That I see on Twitter. I just take it for granted as this is just people like being on Twitter. Growing up in the forums and bulletin boards, you just like shit post about everything. People were getting in like flame words about Linux file systems, literally. But when I talk to people that are in the ETH community again, a lot of those folks there were early Ethereum backers backed Solana.
00:55:32.610 - 00:55:33.926, Speaker E: A lot of the super early.
00:55:34.028 - 00:55:55.966, Speaker A: Those folks became validators and started businesses that are multi chain. I never felt like there was like a hate coming out from especially not from Vitalik or Justin or Doncrat or any of the core devs. I think they've been awesome and super helpful. So people shit post on Twitter I.
00:55:55.988 - 00:55:57.726, Speaker E: Think is just like I don't know.
00:55:57.748 - 00:56:22.710, Speaker A: I don't even know if they believe what they're saying. Whatever. I don't really let it get to me. Stuff that's I think valuable that comes out of that is like arguing about decentralization, like actually getting to the nuance of trustlessness. Like, how do you minimize trust? What are the trade offs with Sharding? What are the trade offs with big hardware systems like Solana?
00:56:23.290 - 00:56:26.022, Speaker E: I think a lot of value is.
00:56:26.076 - 00:56:40.460, Speaker A: Actually created there by getting the terms right, getting to the nuance of the trade offs. So in some ways, my conversations with Doncrat have influenced Solana's design. That's awesome.
00:56:41.150 - 00:56:46.762, Speaker B: I do think that's an underutilized tool of Twitter and sometimes can be drowned out by all the noise.
00:56:46.906 - 00:57:36.394, Speaker D: Uniswap is the largest on chain marketplace for self custody digital assets. Uniswap is, of course a decentralized exchange, but you know this because you've been listening to Bankless. But did you know that the Uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat Onramp?

00:59:55.174 - 01:00:50.778, Speaker B: So we've talked a lot about kind of the birth and the growth of Salana in 2000 and 22,022, but you said something really interesting about actually 2022 specifically, and that you were at the Breakpoint conference, I believe, when some of the FTX stuff started to bubble up. Can you just tell me about that whole experience? Because I feel like up to that point, the Solana community in general fared fairly well. I mean, it was a rough year for Crypto, right? We had Terra Luna that was really bad for the Terra Luna ecosystem. Of course. Then we had 3 hours capital and we had kind of celsius CFI very shaky through all of that. Solana seemed kind of fine, of course, prices down, but prices down everywhere. But this particular event, the FTX kind of event, and the.
01:00:50.778 - 01:01:13.460, Speaker B: Unfolding of that had to hit the Solana community hard. In fact, I know it did, partially because I think, whether fair or not, sam Bank Mcfried was seen as a champion of Solana. I think he was very much in the early days. So tell us about that event. When did you first catch wind of that? What were the thoughts going through your head and how did that affect you and the Solana community?
01:01:16.250 - 01:01:20.674, Speaker A: It was basically in the flight back is when I started seeing the tweets.
01:01:20.722 - 01:01:24.886, Speaker E: Coming out of Sam and Binance and.
01:01:24.988 - 01:01:37.754, Speaker A: That interaction between Alameda and the balance sheet being leaked. So the first kind of flag, but I didn't take it seriously. It was, huh, this balance sheet, is that really what Alameda has?
01:01:37.792 - 01:01:45.920, Speaker E: That seems like not great. And.
01:01:49.650 - 01:02:15.734, Speaker A: Seeing Binance's reaction and CZ, like making that tweet and then how Alameda responded was when my stomach started churning like, holy shit, this might be a pretty bad event. But again, I was really shocked when it unraveled to the point that it did. Basically when Sam said that he's trying to sell FTX to Binance was like.
01:02:15.772 - 01:02:18.022, Speaker E: Holy fuck, something bad.
01:02:18.076 - 01:02:18.680, Speaker A: Really?
01:02:21.610 - 01:02:33.070, Speaker B: How before that, how would you characterize Sam's relationship with the Solana community? Was he a supporter? He was obviously an investor at some level. But how was he involved?
01:02:33.490 - 01:03:00.466, Speaker A: In the early days? It was a big again, no one really heard of Solana. We just launched trying to get people to code in this weird rust environment where it felt like writing Linux kernel drivers. The Sam saying that they're going to build serum on Solana was a big deal. That actually, I think, got a lot of developers to turn their heads and be like, okay, there's something here that's.
01:03:00.498 - 01:03:04.486, Speaker E: Interesting because I think FTX engineers had.
01:03:04.508 - 01:03:06.840, Speaker A: A pretty high reputation for being.
01:03:08.570 - 01:03:08.886, Speaker E: Ten.
01:03:08.908 - 01:03:12.426, Speaker A: X engineers, if you want to call them that. But being a small team that can.
01:03:12.448 - 01:03:14.394, Speaker E: Ship a lot of product and make.
01:03:14.432 - 01:03:16.650, Speaker A: Good decisions, like engineering decisions.
01:03:18.350 - 01:03:19.174, Speaker E: That drove.
01:03:19.222 - 01:03:32.830, Speaker A: I think, a lot of DFI interests and got a lot of folks in the early days to start building stuff. There was this kind of relationship between us and them where if we had.
01:03:32.900 - 01:03:35.978, Speaker E: Product ideas or something like that, we.
01:03:36.004 - 01:04:01.066, Speaker A: Could talk to them and be like, hey, is this like an API? Can you guys add it? Or something like this? That was based on this assumption that they have a lot of soul, they're aligned with what Solana wants to do, and they will help us unblock stuff that's really, really hard in crypto because of all the regulatory hurdles you have to jump. But they have all the licenses, they do all the KYC checks for their customers. They can build really good experiences for.
01:04:01.088 - 01:04:10.518, Speaker E: People to so, like, for example, the NFT marketplace we wanted to build was open source.
01:04:10.614 - 01:04:18.186, Speaker A: Give the tools to creators, let them fork GitHub and go launch their own auction houses. And that was the birth of Metaplocks. It was like very wordpressy.
01:04:18.298 - 01:04:21.822, Speaker E: They wanted like a centralized one that.
01:04:21.876 - 01:04:47.110, Speaker A: They controlled the experience that ran the markets Nftx, but they used the source code that we built and they built that experience and it was the same data structure so those NFTs could move in and out of Solana. And that was awesome. I think they tried to go get product market Fit for that thing and it failed. Metaplex, I think, succeeded. So stuff like that was more like product engineering flowing.
01:04:48.510 - 01:04:53.466, Speaker E: But that collapse was really painful to.
01:04:53.488 - 01:05:08.878, Speaker A: Watch because I think a lot of people saw Sam as one of the pillars of like why? Why would you build on Solana? Well, because Sam is building on it, right? And therefore I'm in a good group of people that are building awesome stuff.
01:05:08.964 - 01:05:15.326, Speaker B: It was kind of like a Joe Lubin type figure. Not kind of a co founder, but almost like a consensus. It felt like a little bit they.
01:05:15.348 - 01:05:21.826, Speaker A: Could build stuff like consensus could consensus is like 2000 people, right? I think that we are an.org with.
01:05:22.008 - 01:05:23.682, Speaker E: Labs is like 75 people.
01:05:23.736 - 01:05:32.230, Speaker A: We just don't have that scale to go build a bunch of stuff. Having that disappear overnight was pretty shocking.
01:05:33.130 - 01:05:35.874, Speaker E: And Jarring and I was like, holy.
01:05:35.922 - 01:05:40.102, Speaker A: Fuck, is everything going to die now?
01:05:40.236 - 01:06:10.002, Speaker B: Okay, so shocking. And Jarring, I will tell you, 2022 shook my faith in people once again at a level I don't think I felt even in 2018. Kind of like faith in humanity, faith in people that I thought were I mean, many folks were on high pedestals in the crypto community and they just completely failed from a 2022 shook me.
01:06:10.056 - 01:06:13.074, Speaker C: Like 2008 sounded like it shook people.
01:06:13.192 - 01:06:20.514, Speaker B: Yeah. Did you feel that? Are you immune to that? Are you impurities people?
01:06:20.552 - 01:06:21.438, Speaker E: Are people?
01:06:21.624 - 01:06:51.310, Speaker A: Did I get burned down on that? And I don't even know. I'm a very kind of trusting person. I didn't have any reservations with working closely with Sam. And maybe in retrospect, you probably should be cautious about with anyone in crypto. And I don't like being that. I don't like having to think like are there alternative motives or are they doing something shady? Because it's just like it's exhausting.
01:06:52.050 - 01:06:52.714, Speaker E: It sucks.
01:06:52.762 - 01:07:09.382, Speaker C: I think, knowing how developers think and work, I think that you, Anatoly, are a dev who wants to do dev things. And so probably to have to consider, is SBF a good actor or not? You just want to build, right? Is that a fair take?
01:07:09.436 - 01:07:15.782, Speaker A: Yeah, we wanted to make the network faster and get more shit on more people using it.
01:07:15.916 - 01:07:52.370, Speaker C: I think that if I want to put on my super critic hat of Solana, and this is echoed in a lot of the ETH maxi circles, is that Solana just ended up being a place for mercenaries in this last bull market. SBF being one of them. There's that guy that spun up a bunch of that ecosystem of DeFi apps that pumped up the TVL now being investigated by the DOJ. Would you say the ETH criticism, the ETH Maxi criticism of Salana as just like a place for mercenaries to operate? How would you feel about that critique of Salana inside of its 2021 to 2022 era?
01:07:53.350 - 01:07:59.800, Speaker A: I think those folks definitely suck. I'm not disagreeing with you there.
01:08:02.250 - 01:08:04.294, Speaker E: I don't know if Solana had more.
01:08:04.332 - 01:08:34.370, Speaker A: Of them than Ethereum, or proportionately more even, because there was a lot of shit that happened on Ethereum as mean. Would it be wrong for me to say that those were the two growing ecosystems in that era that actually experienced pretty rapid growth? Binance smart chain, too, right? I think BSc came out and grew to a pretty substantial site and also experienced a big pile of shitty actors.
01:08:37.750 - 01:08:39.762, Speaker E: I don't know what we can do.
01:08:39.816 - 01:08:47.430, Speaker A: Better as a community to kind of have an immune response to push those people out faster.
01:08:49.130 - 01:08:51.574, Speaker E: There's just some stuff that's, like, I.
01:08:51.612 - 01:08:55.414, Speaker A: Kind of thought would happen on its own. People would pick open source software over.
01:08:55.452 - 01:08:59.606, Speaker E: Closed source, but they don't. They just pick whatever is like the.
01:08:59.628 - 01:09:09.498, Speaker A: Shiny new thing and they don't really look beyond that. So that was, to me, kind of surprising that you saw the market not resolve that on its own.
01:09:09.584 - 01:09:13.582, Speaker E: And like, simple things like that is the Dev building.
01:09:13.636 - 01:09:33.060, Speaker A: Immutable smart contracts that are open source, that have been audited and was a development done in the open that would probably filter out, like 99% of these folks just because the folks that want to take those shortcuts are the ones are the ones that are trying to take people's money. Right?
01:09:33.750 - 01:09:35.140, Speaker E: And lie or whatever.
01:09:37.350 - 01:10:06.206, Speaker C: That same article that I was referencing earlier titled on Medium, the year that Solana blew up, blew up in a good way. It might have a double meaning when FTX blew up, but there was a part on cultural debt that I thought was really interesting and it's something that I really enjoyed reading, especially when it coming from somebody who worked at Solana. They wrote, as a result, we have a massive cultural debt in our community, one that must be repaid. What do you think when you hear this?
01:10:06.388 - 01:10:31.910, Speaker A: What I think about is that there were a lot of projects that kind of launched as fast as they could to get either funding or product market fit or users, and they didn't audit, they didn't do open source development from the start. They didn't build Immutable Smart contracts, they didn't use governance or like a multi SIG for their upgrades authority. Like, that kind of stuff, I think is very sloppy.
01:10:33.290 - 01:10:38.170, Speaker C: And you think that got instilled a little bit too deep in the Solana culture for that bull market.
01:10:38.240 - 01:10:43.498, Speaker A: I mean, what's weird is that Armani and the core Solana devs that you.
01:10:43.584 - 01:10:53.360, Speaker E: Look at that are Armani, the Cheeto guys, manga, all those folks are doing the right thing.
01:10:54.850 - 01:11:21.240, Speaker A: Labs didn't build the tooling for people to verify their programs on chain. They did right. They did all of the stuff because they wanted to see it. And those are like the people that when I look to who are the core salona developers. There's those folks, and there's like a whole bunch of people in the periphery that were trying to make money as fast as they could that took those shortcuts. I don't know.
01:11:23.050 - 01:11:26.150, Speaker E: How we correct that.
01:11:26.220 - 01:11:35.242, Speaker A: Or is that a self correcting thing? Because over time it's just those DAPs are the ones that are going to be here in the next cycle, and all the other assholes are not.
01:11:35.376 - 01:12:22.058, Speaker B: I'll tell you my take on that. I do think it's kind of self correcting if you can survive. And one of the signs, as somebody who's been interested in the Solana community, but kind of wait and see what happens is I almost feel like bear markets are so good for purifying. I think the charge that David just said, yeah, it's a purge of Salana being full of mercenaries. This is exactly what Bitcoiners said about Ethereum in 2018. Basically, there's all these ICO scams who in Ethereum, who was here for the right reasons, could deny there weren't a lot of people that took advantage of the base layer of Ethereum to raise scammy, ICO, pump and dumps and exit. A ton of that happened, but they weren't the people that stuck around.
01:12:22.058 - 01:13:21.142, Speaker B: And so, from my vantage point, Anatolia, I've very much been paying attention to how the Solana community fares during this bear market season. It's being tested in kind of the fiery crucible of a bear market. And if it survives, if it shows sign of life, if the builders continue to build, that, to me, is a bullish sign that salon is going to persist and continue doing meaningful things for the community. So it's almost in some way when we were talking about at the beginning, how about 2022 was a good year? Would you erase it if you could? I wouldn't. In fact, I think that, and this might sound okay if I were to say something to the salona community, I think that this is a blessing, actually, for salon to actually have to go through this. It was too easy, wasn't it? It can't be this easy. You can't just go from like eleven freaking cents or whatever to like $250 20,000.
01:13:21.142 - 01:13:55.000, Speaker B: You can't just do that. All right? There has to be some trough of dissolutionment. There has to be some washout, there has to be some purification, some testing along the way for Salana to really figure out what its culture is, what its values are, and whether the builders are going to continue to build. So that's what I'm kind of looking for. And I don't know if we're in the section of we have to talk about future for Solana yet. There might still be some other things to cover, but I don't know if you share that sense with me, Anatoly. Like, this is the testing phase for the community.
01:13:55.450 - 01:14:01.210, Speaker A: Man, the testing phase sucks.
01:14:02.750 - 01:14:04.010, Speaker B: It does suck.
01:14:06.350 - 01:14:14.286, Speaker A: It sucks. It sucks because it's like deflating for a lot of the people that are.
01:14:14.308 - 01:14:17.098, Speaker E: Doing the right things that are taking slower.
01:14:17.274 - 01:14:32.420, Speaker A: I think that happened on Ethereum as well. But I think Compound and Ave and all those folks are awesome, right? They built really good products and they're an example that I think everyone should look up to.
01:14:33.110 - 01:14:35.798, Speaker E: I hope we have the same kind.
01:14:35.804 - 01:14:43.638, Speaker A: Of cohort of people survive that can become leaders in the next cycle. But getting through this phase sucks for sure.
01:14:43.804 - 01:14:44.520, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:14:46.090 - 01:15:42.826, Speaker C: So, Anatoly, here we are in 2023 and I kind of want to just do like a snapshot, an audit of the current state of Salana because there are some parallels that I see to the state of the Ethereum community. Not necessarily the Ethereum project because there's philosophical differences that will always make it different, but the state of the Ethereum community and the state of the Salana community. Right. Salana is just coming out of the overhang of SBF, right? And FTX massive forced seller of Sol into the market. I kind of see a similar parallel of honestly like Joe Lubin and Consensus in Ethereum 2018, big forced seller of ETH because of the operating costs of Consensus, to say absolutely nothing about any sort of similarity between Joe Lubin and SPF couldn't be more different. Just the nature of the forced selling of a large holder of the bag. And then also in Ethereum 2018, you had the ICO Treasuries big just sellers into the market.
01:15:42.826 - 01:16:34.154, Speaker C: And between Joe Lubin selling for Consensus, ICOs selling because of their treasuries just drove the ETH price down. And I kind of see that with FTX being a force seller and also funds uncertain, rumors about multicoin being needing to sell their soul and selling their soul into the market as well, and other funds as well. All of the VCs that did own soul. And in Ethereum, when all the ICOs sold their ETH, it was a massive distribution. Same thing with Consensus, same thing with like, Joe Lubin, one of the biggest, most concentrators holders of ETH. All the ICO, Treasuries, big concentrated holdings of ETH had to sell it into the bottom of the market to the few remaining community members who were still bullish on the future of Ethereum. And that has to be what's going on with Solana right now.
01:16:34.154 - 01:16:56.318, Speaker C: Where you had the concentrated VCs, you had the force seller of FTX selling Sol into the market and distributing the Sol token to the last remaining people who are bullish Solana. That's my snapshot of where Solana is. And so is that a fair take? And can you kind of provide your own audit of the Solana ecosystem? How are people feeling?
01:16:56.494 - 01:16:58.020, Speaker E: Where are they at right now?
01:17:01.270 - 01:17:03.250, Speaker A: A lot of the stuff that's happening.
01:17:03.320 - 01:17:08.786, Speaker E: I think that's pretty exciting is development.
01:17:08.818 - 01:17:24.154, Speaker A: Of new DeFi protocols. Ada Drift like folks building new perpetual markets and figuring out how to use the chain to get to that vision of let's replace tradefi and run it on Solana and have a competitive system.
01:17:24.272 - 01:17:28.262, Speaker E: Tonight that's happening. I think that's pretty exciting.
01:17:28.326 - 01:17:36.830, Speaker A: And those are really dedicated teams that are working really hard. And it sucks because DeFi has been.
01:17:36.900 - 01:17:39.594, Speaker E: Hurt the most on the network.
01:17:39.722 - 01:18:07.538, Speaker A: But, like, pretty stoked about that. The NFT community is very thriving. It's like, I think, arguably it's the second largest right in crypto. Would you guys agree with me? It seems like by activity and by numbers, it's half, about half the size of Ethereum. I'm proud of that. I didn't do it. I didn't do anything.
01:18:07.538 - 01:18:32.814, Speaker A: But it's awesome to see that and those folks are having fun and building cool shit and creating memes and trying to build brands or whatever. And there's always constant controversy because it's big enough to where it's just a continuous thing. But that is awesome. A lot of the mobile kits for the Solana mobile, all the dev kits sold out.
01:18:32.932 - 01:18:35.858, Speaker E: So we have a very strong I.
01:18:35.864 - 01:18:55.080, Speaker A: Don'T know how that's going to translate to consumers, but there's a very strong developer sigh of relief that there is like a chance for an app store that isn't controlled by Apple or Google. That's coming from the folks in the community. I think that to me, is pretty awesome.
01:18:56.890 - 01:18:58.358, Speaker E: I don't know if people are still.
01:18:58.444 - 01:19:02.220, Speaker A: Kind of down in the gutter thinking about FTX and all this stuff.
01:19:04.030 - 01:19:05.306, Speaker E: Maybe. I don't know.
01:19:05.408 - 01:19:27.726, Speaker A: I think that the bear market was so bad up until that point that maybe this was bad news in the best possible time. Like, it just happened. The Band Aid is ripped off. Now everyone's thinking about the future. My personal vibes are I'm a bit exhausted from the negative news and I want to see some wins.
01:19:27.758 - 01:19:29.890, Speaker E: I want to see people launch products.
01:19:29.960 - 01:19:37.042, Speaker A: And build cool shit that you can't really do anywhere else. So that, to me, is like, what I'm excited about.
01:19:37.176 - 01:20:13.262, Speaker C: Well, Anatoly, one of the things that make me really optimistic about the current state of Solana is Solana is the only blockchain in crypto after Ethereum that has a second client. And this is one of these things about crypto that makes me feel like I'm taking crazy pills that no one cares about. Having a multi client architecture about their blockchain. It's insane. That bitcoin is like, only one client, and if there's a bug in it, that bug is bitcoin. That's bitcoin, we're going to run with that bug. That's crazy.
01:20:13.262 - 01:20:18.946, Speaker C: And so I see a lot of the fact that Solana is developing Fire Dancer. I think in partnership with Jump, I.
01:20:18.968 - 01:20:20.258, Speaker D: Think maybe you can go into the.
01:20:20.264 - 01:20:43.942, Speaker C: Details, but that's, to me, a huge vote of confidence that we finally have a second blockchain ecosystem that has a multi client architecture. So I kind of want to lead and open up this next conversation. The last bit of this conversation is like the future of Solana. Make us bullish about the future of Solana, entice us to stick around in the community during the bear market and maybe you can also dive into the second client.
01:20:44.006 - 01:21:56.420, Speaker A: So I mean, people are always worried about scalability, how's it going to scale, where are you going to get more throughput if it's a monolithic chain with no sharding? And financer is the example of how you can use software to utilize commodity hardware. Stuff you can buy off the shelf to move a lot of memory and a lot of signatures through these systems and scale the network. They've done demos that are like this is like the block producer stage that can handle like 600,000 to a million transactions per second. And this is on commodity hardware, like dual CPU, like intel systems. They're expensive, but you can buy them and by the time you need that much capacity, it's going to run on whatever desktop you can buy on fries the cool thing about it is that it's just performance optimizations. There's not like protocol changes, there's no magic unknown science fiction that we need to build. It's purely straightforward stuff that every database engineer has gone through when they need to step level the performance of the system.
01:21:56.420 - 01:21:58.242, Speaker A: So it's going to get done.
01:21:58.296 - 01:21:59.490, Speaker E: It's just going to work.
01:21:59.560 - 01:22:42.186, Speaker A: I'm very confident that there's no magic that needs to happen and it's a second client. And why a second client is important in a high performance system. I think you can argue that Bitcoin is so slow that with ten minute blocks, if something goes wrong that the community has enough time to maybe revert 8 hours worth of blocks or something like that. And that's reasonable. What that means about Bitcoin finality is like a whole other topic. But for a high performance system, we need guarantees that the state is final and with two clients, if they ever diverge, network cults. So at a gut level, you're actually trading liveness for safety.
01:22:42.186 - 01:23:30.430, Speaker A: Like if humans wrote this code and humans are failable and they wrote bugs and those bugs are catastrophic to where there's a state invalid state transition exploit then two systems written by two different groups of people in different languages, different tools, it's very unlikely that they'll have the same bug. And if they ever diverge and the network has at least 33% on both clients, then the network will halt and humans will be like are needed to go figure out why. Now if you had four clients, it's even better. And I think the goal for Ethereum is to have four clients, right? It's very unlikely that two of them will have the same bug. So one of them goes down, 75% of the network is still live and you maintain liveness now to get to four clients.
01:23:30.930 - 01:23:32.414, Speaker E: They'll take a lot of work, but.
01:23:32.452 - 01:23:33.934, Speaker A: Eventually the cool thing about what Fire.
01:23:33.972 - 01:23:37.394, Speaker E: Dancer is doing is they are also.
01:23:37.432 - 01:23:50.486, Speaker A: Building a spec of what Solana is. So it's much, much easier to where there's an agreed upon spec of all the definitions of all the protocols and formats that's all in one place for somebody to then go look at, like.
01:23:50.508 - 01:23:52.886, Speaker E: Okay, this is how Labs did it.
01:23:52.908 - 01:23:58.818, Speaker A: This is how Fire Dancer did it. We can rewrite this and go or whatever and make it plenty fast. And now you can have three or.
01:23:58.844 - 01:24:02.074, Speaker E: Four clients that's five years from now.
01:24:02.112 - 01:24:17.118, Speaker A: Maybe will be a priority. But v zero. I think we need to get to a second client simply because safety is paramount. And then what keeps me up at night is the scariest thing in the world is a code execution bug in.
01:24:17.124 - 01:24:20.206, Speaker E: The runtime that causes tokens to be.
01:24:20.228 - 01:24:22.026, Speaker A: Minted or state to be corrupted.
01:24:22.138 - 01:24:25.118, Speaker E: And that's catastrophic.
01:24:25.294 - 01:24:36.338, Speaker A: That's like the scariest thing. And it's code written by humans. The best engineers working on the Linux kernel sometimes introduce zero days. And that's just really frightening.
01:24:36.434 - 01:24:49.514, Speaker C: I think the other unique thing that differentiates Solana from any old EVM clone is its VM. Can you talk about the Solana VM and how it's unique and differentiated from other VMs in the space?
01:24:49.632 - 01:24:49.914, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:24:49.952 - 01:25:50.122, Speaker A: Everyone that used the ethereum VM just got a free ride, which is smart because you're using a VM that's securing a very large amount of dollars. Right, and that's a very large bounty to find every possible bug. But you are giving up a lot of performance, as I earlier described. The whole point of Salon is we remove the cap on bandwidth. If the network has X amount of bandwidth, it can stuff all of it. With transactions, it means you can have very large amount of throughput like hundreds of thousands of TPS on old school one gigabit standards. Now, the hard part is then how do you actually process all of them and how do users actually take advantage of this throughput in a single state machine? It's very tricky to actually write systems that allow for parallelism at the user level.
01:25:50.122 - 01:26:36.218, Speaker A: So the runtime as is designed is built kind of from the ground up with that idea, like we built the system. So when transactions flow through this thing, they can be processed in peril as fast as possible. And that's very different from how EVM is constructed. And that means that we have to build not only just the consensus layer and the tooling and all this other shit, we also have to build an EVM equivalent, like a Turing machine equivalent virtual machine. If we didn't do that, you would basically see kind of a slightly faster Ethereum that could do maybe like 30 to 50 TPS. It would be very limited by how EVM works and how memples work and.
01:26:36.224 - 01:26:50.558, Speaker B: A whole bunch of other stuff so anatoly. Very much like ethereum. I think in the depths of 2018, some people out there, maybe even a lot of people out there, are saying Salana is not going to make it.
01:26:50.644 - 01:26:50.894, Speaker E: Right.
01:26:50.932 - 01:27:10.742, Speaker B: They're not saying that about Bitcoin. I still don't think they're saying that about Ethereum. Some people are saying all of crypto is not going to make it. But let's put those haters aside. All right? Different podcast. He's not a typical bankless listener, but some people have doubts about Solana. Is Solana going to make it through the bear? What is your case for why Solana will make it through this bear market out on the other side?
01:27:10.796 - 01:27:15.538, Speaker E: Stronger Solana, the token or the network? The network.
01:27:15.634 - 01:27:18.300, Speaker B: Also, my answer would be yes to that.
01:27:18.750 - 01:27:20.140, Speaker E: Let's talk about both.
01:27:21.150 - 01:27:35.582, Speaker A: The network will make it. I mean, the tech is there. It's just like go fork it and run Solana new Solana or whatever, right? The code is there. It's awesome. People like using it.
01:27:35.636 - 01:27:38.574, Speaker E: So I think in that sense we.
01:27:38.612 - 01:27:51.506, Speaker A: Have enough traction and enough devs that want to keep this thing going to where it'll keep going. The rest is, I think, very much macro dependent. I think that's like a big question.
01:27:51.608 - 01:27:56.674, Speaker E: For probably all of the smart contract.
01:27:56.722 - 01:28:04.440, Speaker A: Platforms except for Ethereum. Are we going to be in a high interest rate environment for the next five years where everything gets.
01:28:06.410 - 01:28:06.886, Speaker E: All the.
01:28:06.908 - 01:28:12.246, Speaker A: Riskier, bets get squeezed down and there's no traction? That means that there's nothing for Salana.
01:28:12.278 - 01:28:15.562, Speaker E: To do that's useful to the world.
01:28:15.696 - 01:28:28.058, Speaker A: That Ethereum doesn't cover. Even if Salana is 100 times faster, right? Even if we do more transactions and all the Ethereum L two S combined, they're not providing enough value to the world in that environment.
01:28:28.154 - 01:28:30.826, Speaker E: If they're not, that means it's not going to survive.
01:28:30.938 - 01:28:39.234, Speaker A: Now, that's like the big if. And that I don't know. That's a big if for crypto. What is crypto doing right now that is so crucial to the world that.
01:28:39.352 - 01:28:41.220, Speaker E: It can't live without it?
01:28:41.750 - 01:28:44.820, Speaker B: How do you feel about Solana's chances then? How do you feel about that?
01:28:45.210 - 01:28:48.870, Speaker A: Think honestly, I feel pretty good.
01:28:49.020 - 01:28:57.350, Speaker E: I think the fact that we have this thriving NFT community which was built.
01:28:57.420 - 01:29:40.690, Speaker A: Totally accidentally, like neither myself or Raj or like, NFT gurus, it just happened because the UX was better and it was cheap and fast and no one has been able to replicate that and get that going. I think to me speaks that there's something there in the tag that'll continue derive value to the real world from the chain. And if there's companies like Magic Eden or whatever and the long tail of NFT startups that have real world revenues, they're actually making money on the web that excludes the ad tech. It's not Google revenues anymore. It's like Web three crypto weird revenues.
01:29:40.770 - 01:29:45.010, Speaker E: That are people with hundreds of thousands of users.
01:29:45.090 - 01:30:04.634, Speaker A: It means the underlying base layer will survive in some shape or another. And that's awesome. This is like my bear. I put on my worst hat, bear hat, everything's going to shit. Interest rates are 10% is like the web3 NFT business model survive? I think so. And if that's true, I think Salana survives.
01:30:04.762 - 01:30:09.920, Speaker B: You got to feel better about your chances than versus 2018 when you started this whole thing, right?
01:30:14.550 - 01:30:16.306, Speaker E: Chances are I feel like way more.
01:30:16.328 - 01:30:32.520, Speaker A: Bullish now than 2018. 2019. There's so much funding that's still happening in crypto. There's so many smart young people that are not joining the big companies and building awesome products.
01:30:33.610 - 01:30:36.086, Speaker E: My guess is if you looked at.
01:30:36.108 - 01:30:57.194, Speaker A: All the product launches from inception of crypto to now to what's going to happen in the next twelve to 18 months, in the next twelve to 18 months is probably going to be way more than everything else combined up to this point. And if people are launching products they're grinding for product market fit, they're going to get users means crypto is going to survive.
01:30:57.242 - 01:30:59.614, Speaker E: It's just like that's going to happen.
01:30:59.812 - 01:31:14.210, Speaker B: And totally thanks for this conversation. It's way more fun to have this conversation in the bear market, actually. It gives us a chance to kind of take a breath and hear what's really going on and we're excited about what the Solana community is doing. So thanks for joining us.
01:31:14.360 - 01:31:15.266, Speaker E: For sure.
01:31:15.448 - 01:31:16.674, Speaker B: Oh, last question for you.
01:31:16.712 - 01:31:16.914, Speaker E: Okay.
01:31:16.952 - 01:31:22.630, Speaker B: You said monolithic chain with no Sharding. Is that still the strategy? I'm just checking. Sure about that.
01:31:22.780 - 01:31:23.526, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:31:23.708 - 01:31:27.640, Speaker A: There's no way that Sharding is going to get information faster around the world.
01:31:28.170 - 01:31:28.950, Speaker E: There you go.
01:31:29.020 - 01:31:31.242, Speaker B: Still the strategy, still the difference.
01:31:31.296 - 01:31:42.822, Speaker C: And Atolla, you said that if Salana can do more transactions than all the combined, is that do you think that that's going to happen? That Salana can do more TPS than all theorem L two S combined?
01:31:42.966 - 01:31:44.650, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure that, yeah.
01:31:44.800 - 01:32:00.066, Speaker B: You got to admire the confidence here. And game on, brother. I think this is what levels up the entire crypto community is a bunch of builders in competitive games, friendly competitive games with one another. Anatoly, thanks so much for joining us.
01:32:00.168 - 01:32:01.220, Speaker E: Appreciate you.
01:32:02.230 - 01:32:15.782, Speaker B: Bankless Nation will include some links in the show notes with some action items for you, some further research you could do on Solana. Also on the multi client architecture that Anatoly was talking about, that was called Fire Dancer, am I correct?
01:32:15.836 - 01:32:16.114, Speaker E: Yep.
01:32:16.162 - 01:32:17.170, Speaker A: Fire Dancer.
