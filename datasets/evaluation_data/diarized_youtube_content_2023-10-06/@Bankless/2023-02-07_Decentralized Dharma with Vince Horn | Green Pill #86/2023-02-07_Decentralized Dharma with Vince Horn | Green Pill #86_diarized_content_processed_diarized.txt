00:00:04.730 - 00:00:05.086, Speaker A: What up?
00:00:05.108 - 00:00:53.946, Speaker B: Coordination on the pod. Today we have Vince Horn, who is a Buddhist Geek, the host of the Buddhist Geeks Podcast, which is all about figuring out how Buddhism and the Dharma is going to evolve in the digital age. So I've been a longtime listener of the Buddhist Geeks podcast. About nine to twelve months ago, I was on the Buddhist Geeks Podcast and we talked about the sort of parallels with financial sovereignty that can come out of the blockchain space and psychological sovereignty that kind of comes out of Buddhist practice and what are the intersection of those two things. And Vince and I launched this thing called Sangadao, which was basically just a discord channel where people are interested in the Dharma and people who are interested in web Three could come together and figure out what the intersection of that was.
00:00:54.048 - 00:00:56.758, Speaker A: And the hope was that multiple Sangha.
00:00:56.774 - 00:01:27.686, Speaker B: Dals were going to come out of that movement. Now, we might have just had our bull market lenses on. It might have been naive to think that was going to happen, but the songadao kind of piddled out. The activity there did not continue. But I'm really happy to see that there was dozens, maybe about 100 people who are interested in the intersection of these things and what can these practices learn from each other. And I'm really excited to see that Vince continues to go down the Web Three rabbit hole. Even after all the stuff that's happened over the last year.
00:01:27.686 - 00:02:00.180, Speaker B: Vince sees an opportunity to decentralize the Dharma with the work that he's doing with inner being app and inner being protocol. So we talk a lot about that on this episode. We actually do a social meditation halfway through the episode so that you can see what the inner being protocol is, or at least one of the inner being protocols. There's multiple of them. And I think this is a special, unique episode. Vince cares about decentralization, he cares about Dharma, and he's a pioneer in the digital Dharma space. And so that's why this is a really fun episode for me.
00:02:00.180 - 00:02:13.634, Speaker B: We talk halfway through the episode about what are the parallels between decentralizing context in A Dao and decentralizing the Dharma, which is basically how do you augment.
00:02:13.682 - 00:02:15.766, Speaker A: How present you are and how to.
00:02:15.788 - 00:03:01.046, Speaker B: Teach something that's that high context and that important to someone else in your Sangha? And what are the parallels between that and a Dow where you're trying to decentralize power in context from yourself to other people that are in the dow? And there's ways in which those parallels break down. But what is a full node when it comes to Dharma transmission and what is a full node when it comes to A Dao? And we just barely scratch the surface of the things that those two practices have to learn from each other in this episode. So Vince is a special, unique thinker that is pushing forward digital dharma. And I think that you're really going to enjoy this episode about decentralizing Dharma and the inter being app that I did with Vince Horn. So, without further ado, I give you Vince Horn. Enjoy.
00:03:01.148 - 00:03:44.658, Speaker C: Working in Web Three is awesome, but working outside of the typical W Two employee structure is a deal breaker for so many. Opolis is helping the self sovereign worker focus on what they do best their work. Tax time is coming up. Opolis helps professionalize your business by helping you form an entity, generate proof of employment through Pay subs, and receive a W Two at the end of the tax year. Are you self employed and forced to spend money on expensive health care insurance with limited coverage?

The Glow Dollar is a new stablecoin with a very special property. As the market cap of Glow goes up, extreme poverty goes down. Glow is a dollar backed, non profit stablecoin that creates basic income for people living in extreme poverty. Glow is basically the same business model as USDC, with yield generating treasuries on one side and a stablecoin on ethereum on the other.
00:04:23.294 - 00:04:53.530, Speaker C: But instead of being a for profit company, glow is a nonprofit that donates 100% of all yields from the Glow Reserve to Give Directly's basic Income program. Give Directly is a charity that gives people money, no strings attached, to people living in poverty, and is a charity that Vitalik has previously donated to and supported in the past. With Glow, you can reduce poverty just by holding a stablecoin. Glow is launching in early 2023 and you can join the waitlist@glowdollar.org. Greenpill. That's glowlar.org greenpill.
00:04:55.150 - 00:04:55.674, Speaker A: All right.
00:04:55.712 - 00:04:57.050, Speaker B: What's up, Vince? How are you doing?
00:04:57.200 - 00:04:57.562, Speaker A: Hey.
00:04:57.616 - 00:04:58.550, Speaker D: Good morning, Kevin.
00:04:58.630 - 00:04:59.274, Speaker A: Good to see you.
00:04:59.312 - 00:05:00.010, Speaker B: GM.
00:05:00.350 - 00:05:01.706, Speaker A: GM to you.
00:05:01.728 - 00:05:05.210, Speaker D: That's right. We don't say good morning. This show just GM.
00:05:05.570 - 00:05:10.138, Speaker B: US doing podcasts together will just be a continuation of me trying to pull you down the Web Three culture rabbit.
00:05:10.154 - 00:05:15.058, Speaker D: Hole events and vice versa on the Buddhist rabbit hole. So that's fine.
00:05:15.224 - 00:06:01.040, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So you and I did a podcast together maybe nine months ago on the Buddhist Geeks podcast in which we talked about something called Sangha Dow. Sango being your community of Buddhist practitioners, and then Dow being a Web Three provocation of that. And, yeah, we started a discord and we tried to put something together, actually creating a dow, a Sangha dow. And it didn't really turn into a dow on its own, although it kind of created a cultural intersection between people who are into Buddhism and people who are into Web Three. So what has the last nine or twelve months of exploring that been like for you?
00:06:01.810 - 00:07:03.714, Speaker D: It's been really interesting on a couple of levels. I mean, one is just meeting people who are interested in that intersection because it is a relatively small emerging intersection space and there has been some practical stuff that's come out of that. We held a series and I want to hear mentioned Ants Cabral, who's been an important part of this. He brought his sort of decentralized organizing skills and a really nice format that he called the Community Greenhouse to Sangadao. And we held a number of those in which people who were actually working on projects, whether at the very early ideation phase or actually have built something, could come and share and talk about the project at that intersection of Dharma and Dow, Web Three and Budhism. And it was cool to just basically discover that in fact, there aren't that many projects in this space, but there are some, and there are some people who are working at that sort of the edge of those two coming together. So that was quite cool.
00:07:03.714 - 00:07:31.594, Speaker D: And then for me, on a personal level, being a serial entrepreneur, it's been helpful to think through kind of how, if at all, to use Web Three tech for the projects that I'm working on. It's been a nice space to kind of explore that. As a participant, I'd say there's not a whole lot that's come out of Sangadao in terms of formal organization or anything like that, but there's been some cool connections and a space at least where we can talk about these things.
00:07:31.632 - 00:07:33.754, Speaker A: Or start to right.
00:07:33.952 - 00:08:34.574, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that when we did that podcast and maybe we'll link to that podcast in the show notes so that people can go back in time and check it out. But I think that the a priori sort of analysis was that the Buddhist path can create psychological sovereignty for you and that Web Three can create some amount of financial sovereignty for you if you use it responsibly, probably if you use it responsibly in both camps. And so what is the sort of alignment of those two communities? And then we created this meme of Sanga dow. There was a really active discord for like three or six months, but then I think people kind of moved on with their other projects. And so it wasn't a dow so much as a generator of social like an intersection of two different social groups. It sounds like some of your projects have been influenced by that. So it wasn't totally for not, but it was sort of an emergent sort of group that came together there.
00:08:34.574 - 00:08:41.540, Speaker B: I got to stop calling things dows that aren't actually dows. They're like generators of maybe future dows. But yeah, anything to say?
00:08:42.070 - 00:08:44.546, Speaker D: There's a word that needs to be invented there, I guess.
00:08:44.648 - 00:08:53.606, Speaker B: Yeah, you're good at that. Provocation or something like that. But yeah, I guess. Could you tell us what are you working on now, and is there any.
00:08:53.628 - 00:08:55.480, Speaker A: Web three influence with it?
00:08:57.050 - 00:09:56.634, Speaker D: Yes and yes. The main thing I've been working on the last several months is it's a multiplayer meditation app called inter being. And we're building it on the zoom platform because that's where communities already are hanging out virtually. And our intention is to take this past twelve years of training in and doing and then creating interpersonal meditation practices practices that are actually designed to be done out loud with other people rather than silently by yourself and to essentially figure out how to scale that up in a way that's trauma, informed and effective to a larger audience. Because the main problem right now with meditation apps is that they're all like glorified ipods. They just play basically various versions of guided broadcast meditations, which is cool and important. And I've done that.
00:09:56.634 - 00:10:54.106, Speaker D: I've recorded lots of meditations and had them on apps and stuff. And I don't think that's going away. But it's kind of interesting to me that we have yet in the meditation space to realize the paradigmatic power, the shift from the sort of individual one to many broadcast model the 21st century, like TV and radio and newspapers, to the internet age and the peer to peer model. Meditation has not in mainstream meditation has not made that leap yet. And so essentially that's what I'm working on is how to do that. And there is a web3 aspect to this. Although we're starting just with a sort of standard web two kind of approach, our intention is to link back to web3, or to help create, in a sense, a kind of meta game or ecosystem around which these practices could have another level of meaning.
00:10:54.106 - 00:11:06.626, Speaker D: And right now I'm thinking of this mostly as a massively multiplayer meditation online role playing game. Or mmmorpg XYZ. I've actually got the domain that's the.
00:11:06.648 - 00:11:08.334, Speaker B: Web three domain TLDs.
00:11:08.382 - 00:11:09.074, Speaker A: That's it.
00:11:09.192 - 00:11:25.350, Speaker D: That's it. So yeah, there's an idea of how to take some of these inherently relational practices and build a kind of role playing game underneath it or on top of it to help incentivize the actual behavior of doing the practices.
00:11:25.850 - 00:12:09.750, Speaker B: Yeah, I love that. MMM ORPG just is provocative, especially knowing that one of those M's is meditation. And I totally see the analog with multiplayer meditation being a huge mean, you know, figma took design and made it multiplayer. I know that a bunch of people are working on taking coding and making it multiplayer, and just taking meditation and making it multiplayer feels like a totally obvious leap when I put it in that context. And I'm curious, does that facilitate faster learning or faster decentralization of the Dharma to be able to do it many to many instead of just one to many in the broadcast model? What kind of weird stuff have you seen since starting to play with multiplayer meditation?
00:12:10.970 - 00:12:11.910, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
00:12:12.060 - 00:12:48.290, Speaker D: That's actually what's most exciting about it is it is a pedagogical leap. It's a quantum leap in terms of learning because you're not just being given this sort of instructions and then going off on your own and trying to kind of grind through them and figure them out without much feedback in those practices, which I think maybe we'll do a little bit together here to demonstrate them at some point. So it's not just theoretical. In those practices, you actually hear each other practicing. So it takes in meditation. It's normally a black box. Your experience is a black box.
00:12:48.290 - 00:13:40.850, Speaker D: Like, you don't really know what the hell is going on unless you've developed your ultra psychic powers. You don't know what's going on in another person's experience unless they say so. And usually when they do say so, it's being filtered through lots of interpretive abstractions of stories that the people are making up about it. But in these techniques that we do, the techniques are usually very simple. There's not a whole lot of space for story, and so you actually just hear at a very simple level, like what's happening for someone right now as an example. And so that's very powerful to be able to kind of immediately get that instantaneous feedback and modeling. And then the other thing it does is it cuts down mind wandering by a huge factor because there's a peer pressure in these practices, like, you know, when it's your turn or when it's time to go, you can't be like off on a ten minute fantasy.
00:13:43.510 - 00:13:55.880, Speaker B: My favorite way to spend time on the meditation mat, because I'm a novice meditator, I don't have that loop that's like, hey, Kevin, focus on your breath again. But if I was in a social group, then maybe that would kind of be there.
00:13:56.570 - 00:13:57.222, Speaker A: That's right.
00:13:57.276 - 00:14:03.866, Speaker D: The peer pressure can kind of override the tendency to just want to hang out and think about things.
00:14:04.048 - 00:14:04.730, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:04.880 - 00:14:08.170, Speaker B: Should we do one? Instead of just talking about them? Should we do one?
00:14:08.240 - 00:14:08.474, Speaker A: Okay.
00:14:08.512 - 00:14:10.878, Speaker D: Yeah, let's do let's demonstrate it.
00:14:11.044 - 00:14:13.678, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, take us away.
00:14:13.844 - 00:15:01.900, Speaker D: Okay, cool. Well, I think the easiest practice to demonstrate and here the intention is not just for people who are listening to just watch this or observe it intellectually. But actually there's a deeper invitation, if you'd like, which is to witness the practice and to witness with presence, like to actually be present and hear Kevin and I go back and forth as we share our experience aloud and to see how that impacts you, actually to see the effect of doing that. The easiest practice, I think, to start is one that you've done before kevin. It's called? There is noting. I think we did this together in England not so long ago, and that was quite fun. The basic idea here is very simple.
00:15:01.900 - 00:15:07.360, Speaker D: If you want to know what's happening in your experience, you have to stop and check.
00:15:07.810 - 00:15:09.054, Speaker A: So you have to sort of say.
00:15:09.092 - 00:15:20.500, Speaker D: Okay, what's going on right now? And then one way of phrasing it, framing it when you sort of check in with your own sensory experience and you see, okay, what's happening right now is you could just say there is.
00:15:20.870 - 00:15:22.274, Speaker A: And then use a word or two.
00:15:22.312 - 00:15:31.186, Speaker D: To describe whatever there is, whatever it is that you're noticing. So, like, there is seeing, or there is a little tightness in my chest.
00:15:31.218 - 00:15:37.794, Speaker A: Right now, so there is tightness, there's anticipating and so forth.
00:15:37.842 - 00:15:49.910, Speaker D: And I'm just doing that verbally out loud to demonstrate it. But in the social part, we'll actually take turns kind of like ping pong, going back and forth, noting one at a time, whatever it is that we're noticing.
00:15:50.070 - 00:15:51.486, Speaker A: Okay. All right.
00:15:51.508 - 00:15:53.760, Speaker B: Well, I think I've got the idea.
00:15:54.290 - 00:15:56.094, Speaker D: Oh, you're zooming out. This is great.
00:15:56.212 - 00:16:06.518, Speaker B: My camera is bugging out. I'm going to switch to my non fancy camera. Okay, so should we do maybe a minute of noting meditation?
00:16:06.714 - 00:16:16.054, Speaker D: Yeah, let's do a minute. That's a nice amount to demo. It'd be sort of minimum sufficient of time to get it cool. Okay, great. I'll ring a bell at the end. How about that?
00:16:16.172 - 00:16:16.806, Speaker B: That sounds great.
00:16:16.828 - 00:16:18.790, Speaker A: You want to tee us off, Jim? Okay.
00:16:18.860 - 00:16:20.406, Speaker D: I'll tee us off by saying there.
00:16:20.428 - 00:16:30.254, Speaker A: Is starting, there is audio, there is.
00:16:30.292 - 00:16:31.150, Speaker D: Breathing.
00:16:35.010 - 00:16:46.560, Speaker A: There is hearing, there is toothaching, there is grogginess.
00:16:49.460 - 00:16:51.520, Speaker D: There'S adjusting posture.
00:16:56.770 - 00:16:59.040, Speaker B: There is slowing down.
00:17:03.430 - 00:17:05.170, Speaker A: There is trusting.
00:17:11.810 - 00:17:13.550, Speaker B: There is adjusting.
00:17:17.100 - 00:17:17.464, Speaker A: There.
00:17:17.502 - 00:17:18.840, Speaker D: Is exhaling.
00:17:24.120 - 00:17:27.384, Speaker A: There is presence, there is.
00:17:27.422 - 00:17:28.120, Speaker D: Movement.
00:17:35.220 - 00:17:37.280, Speaker B: There is notifications.
00:17:39.860 - 00:17:41.372, Speaker D: It will end on that note.
00:17:41.516 - 00:17:50.432, Speaker B: Yeah, I should have got a notification. I got to go chase that dopamine hit. But now I'm present about it, at least as I'm chasing that dopamine.
00:17:50.496 - 00:17:50.916, Speaker A: Yes.
00:17:51.018 - 00:17:53.350, Speaker D: Now you're aware of how painful it is.
00:17:54.360 - 00:17:57.768, Speaker B: Well, it's different. So that's the first time, I think.
00:17:57.774 - 00:18:01.672, Speaker A: That we've done the meditation together over digital. Right.
00:18:01.726 - 00:18:16.750, Speaker B: Which is just a totally different level of presence than, like, I think last time we were physically in each other's presence, which kind of creates a different dynamic to it. But what should the listener be noting about the noting experience? To ask a meta question?
00:18:19.200 - 00:18:21.120, Speaker D: I think one thing to note here.
00:18:21.190 - 00:18:24.672, Speaker A: Is that in this practice, any words.
00:18:24.726 - 00:19:30.470, Speaker D: You use are okay. The purpose of the notes, we call them notes or labels in this technique, are not to actually it's not about trying to find the right word. Rather, it's trying to keep the noticing function of the mind, the part of the mind and attention that is constantly noticing how things are. This metacognitive capacity, it's trying to link that and bind that to our sensory experience, to actually see what is it that you're sensing? Because there's noticing and sensing and those two are different functions. And oftentimes we're so lost in our conceptualizations about things that we're noticing that we lose touch of feeling our feet on the ground like these very basic experiences that if you lose, it's much harder to stay resilient and stay grounded and stay centered and stay healthy. Because we've lost touch with this basic kind of information that the body is sending us. It kind of reminds me of mentioned.
00:19:31.720 - 00:19:58.168, Speaker B: I'm sort of on the shallow end of the meditation pool. But I do know that after I've done a retreat or I'm feeling really centered that I have this sort of sensing experience. And then either I react immediately or when I'm in my more present moments there's sort of like a tagging or a pattern matching mental process that happens before I respond to things. And it almost feels like what I'm.
00:19:58.184 - 00:20:01.004, Speaker A: Doing with the inner being protocol meditation.
00:20:01.052 - 00:20:29.496, Speaker B: That we just did. It's almost like the noting. It's like building the muscle of tagging and pattern matching my sensory experience and doing it with you allow. I feel like I'm like a level two meditator and you're like a level 99 meditator. There's almost like an amount of social transference. I'm syncing your presence, your ability to note with mine. That's what I think is cool about it.
00:20:29.496 - 00:20:32.330, Speaker B: But again, I'm just a novice. Is that how it's supposed to work?
00:20:32.860 - 00:20:33.752, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right.
00:20:33.806 - 00:21:19.080, Speaker D: Actually that's really interesting observation too, because on the other side, for me it means working with someone who's fairly new to their mind. I feel kind of tugged down to where they are. They might feel pulled up, but actually that's good because at least in my tradition, we talk about two things. We talk about wisdom or transcendence. Transcendent wisdom and then compassion. And both of those movements are important to transcend, to let go of, to become bigger and wider and more free. But then how free can you really be if you're the only one, if you're the only one experiencing that transcendent freedom? It's not that great, it's not that robust.
00:21:19.080 - 00:21:38.060, Speaker D: And so it's great to actually meet people where they are and to work with them where they are. And of course I'm doing the same thing with myself all the time too. It's not like I am a level 99, a meditator. It doesn't feel that way. Level whatever level it is, the higher you go, the more the latter sways.
00:21:39.200 - 00:22:23.144, Speaker B: I love what you said about meditation or enlightenment and presence being much sweeter when you have someone to share it with. I think that there's something profound there. Maybe it's just because I've been watching The Last of US, this new show on HBO. But these people that are fully healthy and living in this world where everything around to them has died and all they are is wishing for a community. Like people that they can commune with. And I imagine that maybe I'm just projecting that on top of what you just said there, but the idea of being enlightened or feeling present, having someone to share that with is better. I just think that's kind of like a profound statement.
00:22:23.144 - 00:22:43.836, Speaker B: And the fact that you're working on live meditation protocols so that people can share those and bootstrap those things kind of like it's an interesting investment, like a high leverage point for creating that world that you want to see. Working on multiplayer meditation, I think is where we'll end this meandering observation.
00:22:44.028 - 00:23:22.610, Speaker D: Yeah, no, thank you for saying that. I appreciate your support in all this, Kevin. Yeah. And to take the word enlightenment, which is also quite problematic in a lot of ways, because we can just project all of our fantasies onto that word. For me, in doing these practices, what I think enlightenment actually looks like is being attentive to your experience and to others simultaneously. That's all it is. It's just the ability to hold your experience in mind and the experience of others without completely collapsing in on yourself, like losing everyone else into yourself or losing yourself into others.
00:23:22.610 - 00:23:55.130, Speaker D: And I've noticed people tend to have one of those two tendencies. And so this practice is about learning how to actually maintain a balanced attention. I call it introspection, where you're both aware of your own feelings and thoughts and sensations and others around you. And this is just hyper functional thing to do. When you're able to do that, you become a better person and more effective. And so it's actually really functional and really useful. And we don't even have to get into the mystical dimension of this, which, by the way, is pretty profound because then you realize you're not who you thought you were.
00:23:55.130 - 00:24:03.420, Speaker D: You're something which is sort of more like networked rather than an individual. And I think that's quite beautiful to realize.
00:24:03.760 - 00:24:08.184, Speaker A: Yeah, well, it'd be nice to realize.
00:24:08.232 - 00:24:19.330, Speaker B: That I'm a networked individual in a presence based mindful way instead of when I'm just scrolling Twitter and blasting myself with everyone else's thoughts. A more mindful networked individual.
00:24:20.020 - 00:24:20.960, Speaker A: Yeah, good point.
00:24:21.030 - 00:24:21.650, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:24:22.500 - 00:24:30.324, Speaker B: So are we still talking about this? I know a name that you were toying with for a little while was Interbeing Protocol. Is that still a name that you're using?
00:24:30.522 - 00:24:30.932, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:30.986 - 00:25:06.690, Speaker D: So the app that I mentioned earlier is called Interbeing, and people can find it at Interbeing US, or at least our landing page there. And the Interbeing Protocol are the set of basic schematics that describe different sort of, to use Daniel Schmachtenberger's term, they're like generator functions for these practices. So they describe kind of what are the kind of key elements that need to be defined when you do a set of practices. And then within that, then one could generate all kinds of different practices as we have in our community.
00:25:09.140 - 00:25:31.370, Speaker B: So there's an app called Inner Being in which you can experience it. But then the sort of web3 pill in you is thinking about how do we abstract the actual practices into credibly neutral protocols that no one owns? So there's a consumer facing experience and there's a protocol centric experience there.
00:25:31.820 - 00:26:15.032, Speaker D: Yes, my current founder and I were a co founder. We're talking about how to make that into an actual role playing game. Like very simple and maybe CryptoKitties meets headspace kind of thing, where it's like you have a basic character that's like a soul bound NFT, so that any practice you're doing using these protocols could be logged on a kind of immutable ledger. And you could more than that, you could see the different qualities that you're developing because they're different protocols. Like the one we just did is called the Social Noting Protocol. And it's really mindfulness centric. It's about developing that capacity to just notice what you're sensing in real time.
00:26:15.032 - 00:26:37.896, Speaker D: But there are other protocols like the social Meta protocol. Meta is a word that means friendliness or lovingkindness. And in that protocol, it's more about cultivating and generating positive mind states and inclining toward well wishing. And that's a different capacity. And so you could see that maybe reflected like on a contemplative character sheet.
00:26:37.928 - 00:26:38.076, Speaker A: Right?
00:26:38.098 - 00:27:02.384, Speaker D: It's like, how much mindfulness have you done versus heartfulness versus inquiry, versus just constant focus meditation. And so I'm seeing there's a potential there to kind of map those things onto a role playing game, Schematic. And I'm excited about that prospect because I think it just taps into our natural kind of inclination as humans to want to see some external representation of our internal growth.
00:27:02.432 - 00:28:01.850, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like Vitalik and Glenn have this idea of DSOC, which is like, you gain all these different badges and this reputation graph that is intersubjective from people giving each other these little NFTs and inter being protocol is like a little Buddhist niche or mindful niche of decentralized society. But I think that there's maybe something else about it being a protocol in that if it's open source, it's not owned by anyone. Which is like the typical way that the Dharma has been transmitted is from teacher to student over years. There's a power imbalance there that just Google meditation teacher student power imbalance, and you'll see some of the things that can go wrong with that, but you sort of freeing that. This comes back to the sovereignty thing is the fact that it's a protocol means that it can be transmitted peer to peer with a profound neutrality to it. So I think that is pretty provocative as well.
00:28:02.700 - 00:28:36.128, Speaker D: I think that's the most exciting part of this from my point of view. But I'm sort of super nerdy in that I am a Dharma lineage holder. I'm part of this sort of formal transmission thing and I'm really interested in figuring out how to decentralize some of the functions of lineage so that it can actually open up to more creative collaboration around these things versus just have a few people at the top who are allowed to innovate and everyone else is just sort of a receptacle for their innovation.
00:28:36.304 - 00:28:48.952, Speaker B: So you can speak both the hierarchical Dharma and the networked Dharma languages and you're looking to translate the latter into the former. I hope that's not pejorative for me to call it hierarchical Dharma, but it literally is.
00:28:49.006 - 00:28:50.212, Speaker D: No, that's accurate.
00:28:50.356 - 00:29:24.196, Speaker B: Yeah, but it is transmitted lineage. I can see why. If you had been transmitted the Dharma by a teacher and you really wanted to do right by them, you would want to pass it down to someone that you could trust, would hold that lineage and that knowledge and that context forward. But by making it many to many instead of one to many, in a way, you're kind of creating even more possibility for that to be passed down. And I think that there's a lot of excitement in that too. Even if it's probably way harder than just finding a student and investing in.
00:29:24.218 - 00:30:00.656, Speaker D: Them, it is way harder. And the other thing is it's passing down some parts of what I've learned from my Dharma practice and communities, but it's obviously not all of it. It's a sliver of the meditation training that I think is really exciting and innovative. But around training in ethics, for instance, there's really nothing about this that is inherently going to help people become more ethical. Maybe a little bit. If you're more present, you might actually be more kind of attuned to these concerns. So maybe there's a slight net improvement, but it's not directly focused on that.
00:30:00.656 - 00:30:08.610, Speaker D: So in that sense, it's an unbundling of the Dharma training and focus specifically on the meditation part of that.
00:30:09.620 - 00:30:09.984, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:10.022 - 00:30:12.536, Speaker A: Well, do you think it's going to.
00:30:12.538 - 00:30:15.600, Speaker B: Be unbundled into a suite of interbeing protocols?
00:30:15.760 - 00:30:16.470, Speaker D: Yes.
00:30:18.200 - 00:30:50.252, Speaker B: I feel like there's a relationship probably between the interbeing protocols and the UDA loop, observe, orient, decide, act loop that people just go through in their lives also. So it's not like this just like this transmission, like in The Matrix where all of a sudden neo is like ayo kung fu. It's not like that with the protocol, but there's like a sort of relationship between your experience and your life and your practice and the transmission there. That's probably true reductionist, but that's at least part of agreed.
00:30:50.316 - 00:30:50.930, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:51.380 - 00:31:47.072, Speaker B: So I have a strange take that I wanted to share with you and it's what I DM'd you on Friday on Twitter, which is like, basically I'm wondering what the differences and the similarities between peer to peer transmission of we're all about peer to peer transmission in the blockchain space. And people who are watching on video will see behind me, I've got an ethereum node right here that's just validating blocks on the world financial system out of my house in Colorado, which I think there's something profound about that. Like, I'm. Not on Wall Street. I'm just some guy, and I have a $900 computer that synced the state of the ethereum blockchain in order to have that context of validating the decentralized ledger that is ethereum. And I'm wondering and we have a protocol for that. There's a consensus protocol for that.
00:31:47.072 - 00:32:51.968, Speaker B: And I'm wondering what the analogs are between Dharma Transmission, which is the transfer of knowledge of the practices of enlightenment from peer to person to person, and transferring that context so that people can live their life with presence and perspective. What's the analog between that and two nodes that are syncing the world financial system so that then they can validate humanity's financial transactions day to day? And then, because it's kind of a stretch to talk about, like blockchain nodes, peer to peer transmitting versus people transmitting knowledge to each other, I think the blend between the two is like my experience with Gitcoin and decentralizing power in a dao from one person to many. There's all these things that are bundled inside of power, like context and behavior and relationships and allowing people to steward a dow by decentralizing that power. And I see this analog between decentralizing the Dharma decentralizing state on a blockchain node and decentralizing power in a dow.
00:32:52.144 - 00:32:58.170, Speaker A: And I'm wondering, am I just crazy for seeing this?
00:32:59.980 - 00:33:30.556, Speaker B: How do you become like a full node with respect to transmitting Dharma from one another? And what can we learn about decentralization of power in a dow from Dharma Transmission? I guess I'll stick the landing on this by just saying, do you see any analogues between these things? And if so, what do people have to learn from Dharma Transmission? Since I think that's probably the language.
00:33:30.588 - 00:33:32.108, Speaker A: That you're most familiar with.
00:33:32.294 - 00:33:56.552, Speaker D: Yeah, okay. It's a really interesting and also a very complex question, I guess, in a lot of ways. Well, it's complex because there are many different traditions within Budhism. So I'm going to kind of oversimplify and squash a lot of differences in order to make a cogent point.
00:33:56.686 - 00:34:11.084, Speaker B: I'll just interject that there's many different types of dows also in my main experiences with Gitcoin. So maybe we can center on just the lineage that you know best. And I'll also talk about the dao that I know best. That'll be our fruitful ground.
00:34:11.212 - 00:34:23.872, Speaker D: Great. So I'm most familiar with the early Buddhist tradition, sometimes called theravada school, the Path of the Elders, and the Zen tradition, which I think you're also somewhat familiar with, too.
00:34:23.926 - 00:34:25.684, Speaker B: I'm a dub. Yeah, but I know a little bit.
00:34:25.802 - 00:35:15.556, Speaker D: But still you know enough to be dangerous. Even within these two that I'm familiar with, there's a bit of difference because one is a little bit more strictly top down. The Zen tradition is very well known for its kind of hierarchicalness, where the early Buddhist tradition is a little more hierarchical in that even the way that the teacher is framed is not as a teacher or a guru, but rather as a spiritual friend. And so there is that kind of like being at the same level. Now, in practice, it's not always like that. There is a vertical relationship or a one up, one down power dynamic. And in the Buddhist tradition, that serves a really important learning function, which is that with that dynamic, yes, we can focus on all the ways it can go wrong, but if we leave out all the ways it can go.
00:35:15.556 - 00:36:31.340, Speaker D: Right. I think that's missing an important piece of the puzzle, which is if you're a skilled guide or teacher and you're working with someone and you see there's something they're missing and they look to you as an authority on some things. Maybe not everything right. But they see, like, you've got skill and you've earned their trust and you've given them advice and they've tried it, and it's worked in the past. Then you can serve as a kind of catalyst in that role of teacher in their spiritual growth and development, without which people can spend a long time just kind of spinning in circles because they're not getting feedback and don't know that they're doing something off. So I would imagine there's corollaries in Dows as well, where without good mentorship or leadership, people may not know that they're spinning in circles or may not have a clear vision to all kind of align around like a common heuristic that people can get on board with. And one of the functions of a leader or in traditional business, a CEO, and I think also a spiritual teacher, is to hold the vision of what's possible here and to help people align to that vision and to give them the resources they need to succeed.
00:36:31.340 - 00:36:50.864, Speaker D: And so without that function, that sort of leadership function, I've noticed things don't really move, there's no traction and learning isn't really that easy or much harder. So I'd start there, see what you think.
00:36:51.062 - 00:38:05.576, Speaker B: I think that what I heard from you is that there's sort of a peer to peer relationship, but there's like an information asymmetry where the Master knows more than the student in the Dharma World. And we would never use the word like Master and student in the Dao space, but maybe like the OG who has the context, the Archive Node versus the person who's being spun up to be the full Node of Governance. Even those are like overly technical language. But there's almost like a feedback loop of interacting with your context that the mentor in both worlds can sort of say like hey, without have a corrective function, but like a mentorship type function of like hey, with this context, which you may be missing, you may have reacted to this somewhat differently. And it's the transmission of that context and how it can be applied in the world that I think over time allows you to sync up to being a full node of understanding how to interact within the Tao, or in your case, understand how to interact with presence in the world, which is the transmission of the Dharma. Those are the analogs that I sort of draw.
00:38:05.758 - 00:39:09.932, Speaker D: Yeah, that's cool. And then in the Dharma context, it's obviously a lot more restrictive and a lot less open, because at least in traditional context, say in the traditional Zen approach, before someone would become a full node, and likely only a few people within a large community would achieve this, you're looking at decades of training with a single teacher. So that's like a really super high bar. And it obviously is not decentralizing in its movement. It's more about preserving or maintaining something through time as a strategy versus kind of distributing it everywhere. Although there's an interesting example here in modern times this is a little nerdy, but I'll just share this. There's a book called The Birth of Insight by Eric Braun where he describes from a scholarly perspective what was happening in Burma country in Southeast Asia whilst the British were colonizing it.
00:39:09.932 - 00:39:49.848, Speaker D: And part of the impact of British colonization on Burmese Buddhism at the time was that it went from being hyper centralized, the knowledge of the texts and the practices in the monastic community, to being something that suddenly they thought might actually be threatened. And so very quickly, all of these meditation practices started being taught broadly and widely to non monastics, and they started teaching texts and stuff. And this led to, in large part, the modern meditation movement. So it's actually when that centralized control thing is threatened, then we have examples in history and Buddhism where it becomes more decentralized.
00:39:50.024 - 00:40:03.100, Speaker B: Yeah, there's probably multiple analogs with what's going on in Dows. The analog that popped to mind for me was just talking about how it takes decades to transmit experience of the Dharma.
00:40:03.180 - 00:40:06.448, Speaker A: And the thing that that popped up.
00:40:06.454 - 00:40:48.030, Speaker B: For me is that anyone who's watching a video can see my Ethnode behind me, validating blocks. This is actually my fifth Ethnode that I've spun up. The first two or three I didn't spec correctly, so I put in hard drives that were too low and memory that was too slow. And because of that, it would take weeks, which is a lot in blockchain time, to sync the node. And then it couldn't even stay synced with the current transactions because it was writing too much and it was thrashing. There's a spec called IOPS, which is input output operations, which it didn't have enough of, and therefore it couldn't sync, and it was falling behind. And so what came to mind for me with respect to talking about.
00:40:49.760 - 00:40:50.328, Speaker A: Transferring.
00:40:50.344 - 00:41:44.450, Speaker B: The Dharma is, is there a way to just increase the I Ops on our minds so that we can be more receptive to the Dharma or within decentralization? Is there a way to increase the I Ops of everyone so that they can more quickly sync to each other the context that they needed in order to be successful in the Dow. If everyone's I Ops were just super high, then what would that world look like in which we could be transmitting this knowledge to each other? And how much more quickly could we decentralize? And maybe that's what inter being protocol is. Or I don't want to put words in your mouth, but how could we create an environment in which we're all kind of catching the Dharma from each other or catching context within a decentralized movement together? And I Ops is, I guess, the technical term for that learning velocity that you could have.
00:41:45.700 - 00:42:26.270, Speaker D: Yeah, that's interesting. I like that. It brings up for me something that is attention, too, in the question where, for me, it does feel like there is something of an inverse relationship between depth and breadth, such that the more breadth you have and the more distributed and decentralized you are. Also, just because a lot of these are organic processes of learning, they actually do take time. We're not digital systems. Then essentially there's a dilution of the depth function by decentralizing, organic analog learning.
00:42:28.320 - 00:42:29.052, Speaker B: Which is beautiful.
00:42:29.106 - 00:43:18.412, Speaker D: It opens up access, and it brings more people into the fold. So you don't have to have spent 40 years in a monastery in order to contribute something or say something useful or build something. And that probably has a net benefit for the collective. On the same token, the Yogification of yoga is a good example of this. And it's happening in the meditation world now, too, which is like, when everyone's doing it, how do you know who actually knows this shit deeply? How do you know who really gets this stuff beyond just the sort of first order of conceptualization? And they actually are like a living, walking, breathing embodiment of this stuff. Just being around these kind of people is like psychoactive. And you're like, Holy shit, this is what's possible.
00:43:18.412 - 00:44:03.064, Speaker D: If I really were to dedicate my life to this thing, I'd use you as one of the examples in the Dow space here that'll make you uncomfortable. But there's very few examples of people that have really been living and walking this stuff from the beginning. So, anyway, I think that's attention that arises for me, and I feel like it's like, how do I when I'm thinking about projects I'm doing, like, inner being or this mmm.org, how to balance that. For example, I think one of the natural developmental things of doing multiplayer meditation is at some point, you start to naturally want to create your own techniques. You get enough of doing the practice with different things. You start to get a sense for what it's about, and you want to generate some techniques.
00:44:03.064 - 00:45:07.936, Speaker D: But I don't think it's really wise to have a zero bar of entry to that. Anyone can just right off the bat, because it took me twelve years to really understand the practices well enough, having done them for thousands of hours on top of tens of thousands of hours of solo meditation beforehand before I felt like I really understood the grammar, the underlying syntax of these things. Now I think because one person understands it more, people can understand it quicker. But I still think there's got to be a little bit of an on ramp where people are actually having to do the grinding that's necessary for the actual deep understanding to emerge. So maybe this is answering my own question here, but having some kind of prerequisites that you have to hit certain kind of achievements that are objectively intersubjectively and objectively obvious. Like everyone can see, okay, he put 50 hours of practice into this thing so that must mean he knows at least enough about it to come up with some new versions or whatever.
00:45:08.118 - 00:45:08.848, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:09.014 - 00:45:12.784, Speaker B: And then is that gatekeeping in a new way, but it's like responsible gatekeeping.
00:45:12.832 - 00:45:26.020, Speaker D: It is, it is still gatekeeping. It's like pushing it up though to another level. But I don't know of any other way to do things if humans are still the one driving it.
00:45:26.170 - 00:45:48.380, Speaker B: I think the fact that you're going to have this inter being protocol that anyone can sort of fork and submit a stream of PR for their own inter being protocol is like at least the ground for that happening is out in the open and decentralized as opposed to within a sangha in which it might be gatekeep kept even proprietary.
00:45:49.920 - 00:45:50.670, Speaker D: Yes.
00:45:51.200 - 00:46:36.844, Speaker B: But it kind of reminds me of there's an analog in the Dow space. David Hoffman from Bankless always talks about how we're speed running the history of finance here. So there's a legacy financial system that's 120 years old and there's been a lot of lessons that were learned from the 1920s and the implementation of securities law and the digitization forget a podcast to get it better at pronouncing three syllables digitization of the financial system after World War II and into everything that's happened since then. And so crypto is kind of like speed running the history of finance because it's permissionless, we're learning all the same lessons but just like faster because it's happening digital and networked now. And the analog that I'm sort of seeing here with inter being protocol is.
00:46:36.882 - 00:46:40.060, Speaker A: That you'll probably have a loop between.
00:46:40.130 - 00:47:35.856, Speaker B: A priority knowledge and empirical knowledge in which people are speed running and learning some of the history of the lineages. And maybe what took you twelve years to find someone will submit a fork and intervene protocol and they'll fuck it up and they'll submit a PR back, but they'll learn it in hopefully months, not years. And because it's networked, it'll just happen faster is the analog for me that comes back there. But is that even responsible? The problem with speed running the history of finance is that there's going to be people who are going to come and they're going to get pump and dumped and dumped on and so there's negative externality to that speed running of evolution. And I guess like the psychoactive version of that inner being protocol is like if you go off the beaten course in meditation, are you going to mess up your brain by being a part of that speed running? So having guardrails around that I think is important too.
00:47:36.038 - 00:48:29.984, Speaker D: Yes, I agree. And yeah, you can mess yourself up with meditation, especially if the dose is high enough. And that wasn't really widely acknowledged when mindfulness was starting to become popular because it's like a panacea. But no, actually it's not. There's well known challenges and difficulties that arise from serious meditation practice and there's some unknown and unforeseen potential ones when we're changing the form of it to be more peer to peer instead of this more top down kind of approach. There's probably a lot of failure modes in that that are also we have to kind of consider around reputation and who's a safe person to be meditating with so that you're not going to feel like someone is just like sitting there fantasizing about having sex with you and noting stuff that's inappropriate, for instance, if that's not what you're there to do. Yeah, that'll be an app.
00:48:29.984 - 00:48:31.490, Speaker D: I'm sure someone will make that.
00:48:34.580 - 00:48:37.088, Speaker A: Well, I'm excited about the work that.
00:48:37.094 - 00:48:41.136, Speaker B: You'Re doing within your being protocol. I think that I first started following.
00:48:41.168 - 00:48:45.296, Speaker A: You twelve years ago, and Budhist Geeks.
00:48:45.328 - 00:49:10.384, Speaker B: I think the original statement, mission statement was like discovering the emerging face of Buddhism, and I think it's maybe since evolved then. But you've always been sort of pressing into the new frontier of the digital with Buddhist practice, which is sort of a heretical thing to do, I think, in many different ways. And so I respect that you're such a pioneer here, Vince, and can't wait to see what's next. Remind me what the Buddhist geeks latest mission statement was.
00:49:10.422 - 00:49:13.330, Speaker D: It was evolving dharma is the purpose of.
00:49:15.140 - 00:49:18.352, Speaker A: Dharma. Yeah.
00:49:18.406 - 00:49:27.476, Speaker B: And so inter being app and interbeing protocol and multiplayer meditation is sort of.
00:49:27.658 - 00:49:29.652, Speaker A: The result come out of that study.
00:49:29.786 - 00:49:33.860, Speaker D: That's right. It's an actual outcome of that purpose.
00:49:36.440 - 00:50:05.648, Speaker B: And I think that I hope to continue the conversation with you. I think that there's a lot of parallels between decentralization of financial power in the web3 space and decentralizing Dharma and that psychological sovereignty. So can't wait to see what's next. And now that we've done this episode, everyone who DMs me every other week and says, what's the latest with Sangrda? I can point them at this episode now. At least something has evolved out of that shelling point that we set up together.
00:50:05.814 - 00:50:06.192, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:06.246 - 00:50:10.528, Speaker D: Great. Kevin, I don't know if we have time for me to share one last thing here.
00:50:10.614 - 00:50:12.624, Speaker B: Yeah, let's do like five more minutes.
00:50:12.662 - 00:50:13.344, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:13.542 - 00:51:00.252, Speaker D: So there's one idea that came up when we were talking about this that I think I want to mention as well. I'm sharing it on your screen so you can see it. But it's a very simple model that one of my early mentors, philosopher named Ken Wilbur, who developed what he called integral meta theory. It sort of describes these four dimensions of what's emerging or what's happening right now. And I think this is a really interesting schema to apply to this conversation as well in terms of how things evolve and how they develop. And I just want to describe it verbally. For those that can't see, you've got a basic two x two grid, and the upper half of the two x two grid describes the individual and the lower half describes the collective.
00:51:00.252 - 00:51:56.000, Speaker D: Then on the left hand side of the grid, the two boxes to the left describes the interior and the ones to the right, the right hand side, describes the exterior. So you end up having the individual and collect the interior and the exterior of the individual and collective. That gives you these four grids. And in very simple terms, the upper left, the inside of the individual, describes subjective first person experience or consciousness. The lower left describes intersubjective experience or culture. The upper right, the exterior of the individual, describes things that are actually observable objectively, like bodies and data, observable behavior. And the lower right, the exterior of the collective, describes things that are interobjective, like organizing rules, principle, laws, institutions, blockchains, things like that, networks.
00:51:56.000 - 00:53:25.810, Speaker D: And so for me, I've often held this as a really helpful meta schema for understanding how these things work, because what you're describing that with the world you're in, it's mostly understood in terms of the exteriors and even more specifically in terms of the inter objective. The lower right quadrant that's a big part of Web Three is kind of the obsession with building better networked mechanisms for coordination, right, whereas spiritual experience is all about the inside experience, like the interior of consciousness and transforming that. But what Ken points out here is that these don't describe different things, they describe different dimensions of the same thing. So if something actually is going to evolve, it has to evolve in all of these quadrants at once. There has to be a correlating consciousness that goes along with what's happening in the body, what's going on with the networks or environment one's embedded in what's going on with the culture that you're participating in. And I think this is a really helpful model to understand maybe the evolution of dows and Web Three too, because what's the real challenge? The challenge is building cultures and building environments where people can kind of get it like they have a realization of why this is important and not just about using immutable ledgers. It's also about the interior consciousness change that would enable people to use those things for good.
00:53:25.810 - 00:53:33.190, Speaker D: And so I just wanted to mention that because I think it's a really helpful model for understanding lots of things.
00:53:34.200 - 00:54:16.720, Speaker B: So I think that's maybe another way of answering our question that we started off that original episode with, which is, how does the work that you're doing, which is more centric in the Dharma space, and the work that I'm doing, which is more centric in technology space? I literally asked, what are the I ops of humans when you're decentralizing to them, is crossing the boundaries between intersubjective and inner objective. And because we're all networked individuals, there's a change of self and a change of system that happens in tandem. When we lean into adjusting our culture and our awareness and our institutions all at the same time, is kind of what I gather back from that.
00:54:16.790 - 00:54:25.220, Speaker D: Yes, absolutely. When you can have things stick on all those levels, then you have an enduring structure that emerges. That's the basic thesis.
00:54:25.560 - 00:54:29.476, Speaker A: Yeah. And I wonder if we don't have.
00:54:29.498 - 00:55:41.130, Speaker B: Time to fully unpack this, but there's been a lot of sort of conniption about how social media can be toxic and just like the arguing that emerges on Twitter. And I'm wondering if things like that are sort of the result of giving us access, but not teaching people the inner subjective shared values in order to use these systems by leaning more into building the inner subjective and the inner objective and all of these things together. What would a networked Sango look like and how would it differ from the tire fire of arguments I get in on Twitter is what gets really exciting to me, because the Sangha just means people who come together to practice together, a community of practice. And it's very regenerative culture wise, in my experience, having been there. What would it look like to be plugging into my digital Sangha? Is kind of how I feel when I get connected to you and the Buddhist geeks and the people that are around you, Vincent. So I think it could be profound for humanity if we can figure out how to carve out those little regenerative cultures together.
00:55:41.660 - 00:55:42.596, Speaker A: Yeah, likewise.
00:55:42.628 - 00:55:43.370, Speaker D: I agree.
00:55:43.760 - 00:55:47.484, Speaker B: Well, is there anything I didn't ask that you want to say? I think we got a few more minutes left.
00:55:47.682 - 00:55:49.372, Speaker D: I covered it, man. And I covered it.
00:55:49.426 - 00:55:50.124, Speaker A: Thank you. Yeah.
00:55:50.162 - 00:56:05.970, Speaker B: All right, well, let's schedule twelve months out. I want to hear how inner being protocol is developing from here and can't wait to see what you do, Vince. I think it's so unique and so important for the world, and you're uniquely positioned to do it.
00:56:06.420 - 00:56:07.168, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:56:07.254 - 00:56:08.480, Speaker B: Keep up the great work.
00:56:08.630 - 00:56:20.660, Speaker D: Likewise. Thanks, Kevin. Sam.
