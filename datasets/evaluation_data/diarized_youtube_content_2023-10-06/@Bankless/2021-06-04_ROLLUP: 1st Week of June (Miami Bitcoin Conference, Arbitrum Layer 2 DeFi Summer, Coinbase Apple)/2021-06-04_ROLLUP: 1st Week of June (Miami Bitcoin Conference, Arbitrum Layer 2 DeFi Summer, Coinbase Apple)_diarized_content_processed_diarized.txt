00:00:07.770 - 00:00:11.390, Speaker A: Bankless nation. It is the first week of June. David, what time is it?
00:00:11.460 - 00:00:28.534, Speaker B: It is roll up time, where we condense an entire week of crypto news, good tweets, and interesting opinions all into one single episode, which we are trying to condense a little bit more this week. Because last week is an hour and 45 minutes. We're trying to keep it an hour and 15 minutes this week. We will see how well we do.
00:00:28.732 - 00:00:57.310, Speaker A: Happy Friday morning to you. We get this to you every Friday, either on YouTube, you can watch it there, or on the podcast. We go through markets, releases, news takes, what we're both excited about, and we end with the meme of the week. David, before we get into this program, we got to talk about Kyber, dynamic automated market maker. That means if you're a liquidity provider or want to be a liquidity provider, you can deposit into Kyber's new automated market maker and receive more fees. Tell us a little bit about that.
00:00:57.380 - 00:01:36.970, Speaker B: Yeah, Kyber is one of the OG's automated market makers in this space. They were an amm before we called them amms. And one of Kyber's really competitive advantage is expressivity. And so they have a bunch of optionality with how fees are collected, how liquidity is provided, and they are opening up their yield farm. KNC rewards for liquidity providers are coming soon. So you can go ahead and front run that opportunity by learning how to be an LP inside of Kyber today and start accruing those KNC fees when those fee rewards get unlocked. So you can go to bankless CC slash Kyber and start LP.
00:01:37.470 - 00:01:41.654, Speaker A: Check that out front run that opportunity, guys. All right, David, you ready to get into the markets?
00:01:41.702 - 00:01:42.554, Speaker B: Let's do it.
00:01:42.672 - 00:01:51.754, Speaker A: All right, let's start with bitcoin. We got to start with bitcoin because bitcoin is still number one market cap. Who knows? Look, if that changes, I guess we start with a different asset now. It's bitcoin.
00:01:51.802 - 00:01:54.846, Speaker B: No, we don't start with bitcoin. We start with whatever's number one.
00:01:55.028 - 00:01:55.646, Speaker A: There you go.
00:01:55.668 - 00:01:56.138, Speaker B: That's the rule.
00:01:56.154 - 00:01:59.122, Speaker A: Bitcoin is number one. All right, what's bitcoin doing price wise? Tell us.
00:01:59.176 - 00:02:35.502, Speaker B: Bitcoin. $38,500 at the time of recording. There is a theme throughout all crypto markets, all crypto assets, where we had that low on the 30th, the 30 may, and we have been in a six day uptrend ever since then. So six days of green, which is starting to get people pretty excited. But bitcoin is still kind of lagging behind the rest of the crypto assets, really trying to claim that $40,000 level, because the $30,000 range just, I don't think, is satisfying anyone right now. People are really looking for 40,000 and above. And so we'll see if bitcoin can get back up there.
00:02:35.636 - 00:03:17.754, Speaker A: David, I don't do much ta, but I got this email this morning from somebody, a newsletter I like called Rec Capital, and they talked about this thing called the Death cross. And they said that bitcoin might be going through the death cross if it just hangs out at its current price as early as June. So I'm not into ta. I think a lot of it is horoscopes. But this was sort of interesting to me because this has happened multiple times before, in November 2013, in December 2017, in June 2019. And the death cross is bad, apparently, because once it happens. So to get to a death cross, there's usually like a 50% to 70% off all time high.
00:03:17.754 - 00:03:39.330, Speaker A: But once the death cross happens, you lose an additional 50% to 70%. So if this happens in June and it plays out the way it has historically, then we could see another 50% off of bitcoin back down to 20k prices. Anyway, explain what a death cross even is for folks, because I'm not sure I totally understand what's going on here.
00:03:39.400 - 00:04:11.418, Speaker B: Yeah. So a golden cross is when the 50 week exponential moving average, and a moving average for those that aren't deep into charts, is a way to kind of take out the local in price actions and kind of do a lagging indicator over time. And so it's kind of easier. It's a lagging number that follows bitcoin price at various levels of resolution. Right. And so the 50 week moving average lags behind bitcoin by just an average over the last 50 weeks. 200 week moving average lags behind bitcoin or any asset by 200 weeks.
00:04:11.418 - 00:04:55.420, Speaker B: And a bullish golden cross happens when the 50 week, the short term price action, crosses the 200 week. The long term price action, that's a golden cross. A death cross is the opposite, where the 50 week crosses below the 200 week, which means that the short term price action has been bearish versus the long term price action. And so, historically in crypto markets, the death cross has predicted, as you said, a very strong, just like, deletion of market cap. And what Rex Capital is saying is that the 50 week moving, exponential moving average is on a collision course with the 200 week moving average. And so if it crosses below it, if history repeats itself, then we lose a pretty decent amount of market cap over the next weeks and months following that.
00:04:56.510 - 00:05:18.866, Speaker A: Yeah. So what's your take on this? Is this certain that it plays out? Because as I said, I think sometimes TA is horoscopes, but again, I'm not a trader. I'm thinking about long term fundamentals of these crypto assets. And long term, of course, the right position has been bullish. I think that's the right position now. But could this mean something bad in the short term for bitcoin, particularly if that death cross happens?
00:05:18.968 - 00:05:41.746, Speaker B: Yeah, it's hard to ignore precedent. Right. And everyone has different opinions as to technical analysis and how legitimate it is, how much it actually works to some degree. I don't really believe in technical analysis. Ryan, I know you don't really believe in technical analysis, and a lot of other people that I talk to also don't believe in technical analysis. Yet we are all looking at the charts doing technical analysis regardless, because we're.
00:05:41.778 - 00:05:42.742, Speaker A: Talking about it right now.
00:05:42.796 - 00:05:55.902, Speaker B: Talking about it right now. Right. And I have my charts up and I like to draw lines on it even though I don't know what I'm doing. But to some degree, if everyone's drawing the same lines and coming to the same conclusions, it can turn into a self fulfilling prophecy. Right. That's kind of the gut take for does.
00:05:55.956 - 00:05:57.200, Speaker A: So then it does work.
00:05:57.650 - 00:06:39.606, Speaker B: If mass psychology, the layer zero, if everyone believes it works, it kind of works. We are bringing on ledger from the Ledger Cast podcast and the up only podcast on the state of the nation on Tuesday, who is much more informed about these things, both with technical analysis and also fundamentals of this space. And so I'm really excited to get his opinion on it. Ledger has been just growing more and more into an ethereum, bro. And so I'm super happy to bring him on the state of the nation for, I think, our first ever charting and Ta themed episode. We've never done one of those on a bankless state of the nation. And so we are going to ask Ledger all of these questions in a much more informed capacity next Tuesday starting 2 hours earlier than normal.
00:06:39.606 - 00:06:47.822, Speaker B: So 09:00 a.m. Pacific time, 12:00 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday for that week's state of the nation. So stay tuned for that.
00:06:47.956 - 00:06:51.482, Speaker A: David, I think I'm going to ask him the exact same question about the death cross.
00:06:51.546 - 00:06:53.470, Speaker B: You're probably going to get a much better answer.
00:06:53.620 - 00:07:00.306, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see. All right, let's go to Eth really quick. So that's bitcoin story. What's Eth doing to us? Eth is for us.
00:07:00.408 - 00:07:34.090, Speaker B: ETH is right below $2,800. Spent a decent amount of time above $2,800 yesterday, dipped right below it. As of the time of recording, we are hovering at $2,796. And just like bitcoin ever since last, the 24 may like six plus days of pretty decent uptrend ever since then. And there is a decent level, which we established on the 20th and 21st at 2800. Then we hit 2850 again on the 27th. And now we are right below 2850 ish again.
00:07:34.090 - 00:07:50.946, Speaker B: But there's this triangle that's forming again. Here's me doing. We got a triangle. We got a triangle and it's trying to break out of it. So we'll see if it breaks out of the triangle and see triangles. Yay. But the sentiment on crypto, Twitter, and especially ethereum Twitter has really picked up steam again.
00:07:50.946 - 00:08:06.662, Speaker B: I tweeted earlier this week, it turns out the cat wasn't even dead. I think if there was a dead cat bounce, it would have dumped again by now. But we are almost on our 7th day of greenness, and so I'm putting, as if I ever took it off, but I'm putting my bullish cap back on.
00:08:06.796 - 00:08:15.782, Speaker A: Short term bull cap back on. What are we looking at here? This is a lot of interesting bars. Some are red, many recently are green. What are we looking at? David?
00:08:15.846 - 00:08:45.778, Speaker B: Yeah. This is the monthly candle. So every candle in this chart is one month. This is the east USD monthly candle chart going all the way back until February of 2017. This is linear. Sometimes when you look at these time frames, it's actually kind of best to look in log terms, but really, the story here is the monthly candle that ether just printed. It's called a doji candle, which has a massive wick to the top, a massive wick to the bottom, but it opened and closed roughly at the same price.
00:08:45.778 - 00:09:00.310, Speaker B: Right. And so the body of the candle is very small. The wicks are huge. And so basically, it's just telling you there's a lot of volatility, but it's just a funny looking candle. And we're going to be looking at this candle for basically the rest of time. Right. Because monthly candles are a big deal.
00:09:00.310 - 00:09:15.358, Speaker B: There's only, like five times twelve of 60 monthly candles. And so one of them is this massive doji candle, which went from, like, $4,300 down to $1,700 and then back up to its close at right around $2,700.
00:09:15.524 - 00:09:51.302, Speaker A: You know what's funny? As I look at this, and I go back in time, if you zoom in, there's, like, a couple of places in 2017, 2018 where this happened. One is June, July 2017. Right? And if you zoomed in on that, it would probably look similar ish. But also 2018, February, where kind of the market just fell off. That looks like a similar candle, like the highs and sort of the lows. So that's sort of the question, right? Are we just at the midway point of the bull market about to spring forward higher? Or is this the end?
00:09:51.356 - 00:09:54.300, Speaker B: No, we're halfway point. Halfway point.
00:09:54.830 - 00:10:22.626, Speaker A: We know the answer to that. We think we know the answer to that. Look, here's a chart that I'm really excited about from a fundamentals perspective to David, and this is the percent of ETh supply on exchanges. It's getting lower. That means there's less ETH on crypto banks, as we call them, on exchanges. More ETH in DeFi, more ETH serving its purpose as a self sovereign money store of value, collateral asset. This is the bankless chart, my friend.
00:10:22.626 - 00:10:47.334, Speaker A: This means that the world is going more bankless as this ratio goes down. So super exciting to see that. It means defi is thriving. It means ETH is not custodied in third parties. So I don't know, it's super exciting. I hope we continue to see it hover around there or maybe go lower. I'm wondering what custodial staking solutions might do to this ratio.
00:10:47.334 - 00:11:06.138, Speaker A: There might be a period of time where staking in places like Coinbase or binance becomes very attractive before we have decentralized staking solutions in place. But we're going to be monitoring this. It's hugely bullish for me to see, and I think hugely gratifying to see that as part of the bankless movement.
00:11:06.234 - 00:11:48.160, Speaker B: Right. If we were seeing this thing go up and to the right, especially, which it would be bad, because that means there's more ether on exchanges. And if we saw that during a bull market, that would be really bearishness for banklessness as concept, right? But we had this massive choppy, like, last two weeks, right? And you can see that chop in both the inflows and outflows. There was just a lot of volatility with people putting ether into exchanges, pulling ether out of exchanges. But one of the reasons why I'm pretty convicted that we are just in the second half, we have just entered the second half of the bull market is because that downtrend is still following the trend that it was following before the big sell off. Right. And so price action and price discovery of crypto assets largely happens on centralized exchanges because that's just the way that it goes.
00:11:48.160 - 00:12:31.814, Speaker B: Ether is unique because it can also come to price discovery in Defi. But Defi kind of has been following CFI and centralized exchange price discovery, because when institutions come in, they're not buying ether on uniswap, right? They're not buying it on sushi swap or any of the Dexes. They go to Coinbase, they go to Gemini, they buy and discover. And ether comes to price discovery from new buyers on centralized exchanges. And so when we are only at 11% of ether supply on exchanges and falling, that means ether price can move really quickly when there are big buyers coming in. And DeFI tends to follow CFI valuations. And so the TLDR is that ether is primed for price discovery.
00:12:31.814 - 00:12:35.118, Speaker B: As soon as any meaningful buyer steps in. It's going up into the right.
00:12:35.284 - 00:12:40.574, Speaker A: There you go, up into the right. Let's talk about ETH to bitcoin, speaking.
00:12:40.612 - 00:12:42.446, Speaker B: Of other things that's going up into the right.
00:12:42.548 - 00:13:04.278, Speaker A: Not quite up into the right, but like going up right since recent. So talk to us about this, because this is not quite a local high, but it's certainly recovered from its lows a couple of weeks ago. So again, the ETH bitcoin ratio is a determiner of the strength of ETH versus the price strength of bitcoin. What's happening here?
00:13:04.364 - 00:13:13.274, Speaker B: Yeah, so when there was basically ethereum flipping week or weeks where everyone was talking about the flipping, we hit that high just above zero, eight ETH per.
00:13:13.312 - 00:13:16.090, Speaker A: BTC, where we had three arrows on.
00:13:16.160 - 00:13:48.630, Speaker B: Three arrows capital, right. All the Ethereum people were gloating, guilty. And then we had that big sell off and ether fell all the way back down to 00:57 ish per BTC. And ever since then, we have kind of resumed the trend that has been established since like April, which is we kind of went up too fast. We corrected a little bit, but we are resuming the trend. And that's why it's not a dead cat bounce. That's why we are in the second half of a very long bull market, and that's why your boy is bullish.
00:13:49.130 - 00:14:04.406, Speaker A: Some strength on that ratio. Absolutely. It's actually really good to see that. Let's talk about the strength of DFI. That's our next section. Total locked value in DFI is recovered some. Its highs were around 88 billion total locked in DFI.
00:14:04.406 - 00:14:08.774, Speaker A: That's in us dollar terms. Of course, now it's back up to 70 billion.
00:14:08.902 - 00:14:32.740, Speaker B: Not doing too bad, 69 billion. Nice. Locked in DFI. And it kind of looks like the same chart as both the ETH USD chart, the ETH BTC chart, and now the TVL and DFI chart went up long, long trend up into the right went really, really fast in May, corrected in late May, early June, and now is resuming an up into the right trend. All these charts kind of look the same.
00:14:33.350 - 00:14:48.838, Speaker A: Let's talk about the DPI index. So this is a good indices measure of how well DeFI tokens are doing. This is looking kind of. I've got the three month pulled up. It's sort of flat on the three month, but if you look at on the weekly, it's also flat on the weekly. What's this showing us?
00:14:48.924 - 00:15:15.898, Speaker B: Yeah, Defi tokens have really lagged behind the bigger crypto assets like bitcoin and ether. They have also recovered from their capitulation lows during the sell off. And then the almost again sell off that happened on the 30 May, 30 May had dropped all the way down to 320. But now we are up to $407 per DPi token and recovering, but not recovering as fast as ether or bitcoin.
00:15:16.074 - 00:15:41.074, Speaker A: You know what, I really think that DFI tokens are in sort of the buy zone. There's some deals out there. I mean we talked last week about the YFI token. Its price to earnings ratio for May was like twelve. DeFi tokens are not getting the love, maybe that they should be. And I'm wondering what layer two actually unlocks for them as far as fees, transaction volume, revenue. Remember, these are capital assets.
00:15:41.074 - 00:15:55.862, Speaker A: So if they were priced based on fundamentals, they would respond quite strongly to that. Of course, the market is all about crypto. Market is all about narratives though. And right now DFI tokens are not the dominant narrative. But that might mean there's some buying opportunities out there.
00:15:55.936 - 00:16:20.360, Speaker B: Yeah, and if we think we'll talk about this later in the roll up, but if we think that we are on the cusp of DFI summer layer two edition, you want DFI assets because people are going to be needing to buy assets to farm with them as they did in DeFi summer round one. And so if you think that yield farming on layer twos is around the corner, you need to start allocating to DFI tokens because that's how you're going to farm. If history.
00:16:20.890 - 00:16:25.426, Speaker A: And you want to allocate to the right ones too, like which ones have great layer two strategies.
00:16:25.538 - 00:16:27.682, Speaker B: Oh, I have opinions on mine. I have opinions.
00:16:27.826 - 00:16:29.190, Speaker A: We'll just talk about that later.
00:16:29.260 - 00:16:29.542, Speaker B: Okay.
00:16:29.596 - 00:16:50.510, Speaker A: Talk about it later. All right, first, let's get to this, because inflows have been really interesting into the DPI. DPi, of course, is an index of itself, of many of the top deFi token assets, led by the index co op, which is a DAO. But this is lemonade Alpha saying DPi inflows are going crazy, mostly led by Wales. He's got some charts here. What are we looking at?
00:16:50.580 - 00:17:35.318, Speaker B: Yeah, we are looking at the increased unit supply of DPi. Right? And so DPI price goes up if the underlying assets go up in price, but DPi supply goes up when people have demand for DPi. Right. And so people buying DPI doesn't make the DPI price go up, it makes the unit supply go up, and the unit supply going up having. It's one of its largest growth periods in its history right now. And what he's saying is what lemonade Alpha is saying, who's part of the index co op team, is that it's primarily led by people that are buying more than 250 dpi units. Right? And so if DPi is at $417 and they're buying more than 250 units, people are allocating $100,000 lots at a time.
00:17:35.318 - 00:17:38.186, Speaker B: And that's more than 50% of the people who are buying DPi.
00:17:38.218 - 00:17:39.870, Speaker A: David just did that math in his head.
00:17:39.940 - 00:17:41.006, Speaker B: I know I didn't. I literally just.
00:17:41.028 - 00:17:41.722, Speaker A: No calculator?
00:17:41.786 - 00:17:46.746, Speaker B: No, I was. That did not make it to the camera. Yeah.
00:17:46.868 - 00:17:48.980, Speaker A: No, this is for the podcast people.
00:17:50.630 - 00:18:02.914, Speaker B: I'll cut it out of the podcast. 50% and above are people buying $100,000 units of DPi. And so whales are accumulating DFI tokens.
00:18:03.042 - 00:18:15.910, Speaker A: There you go. That's the story here. All right, but what's the story with the DPI to ETH index? That's another one we've been tracking. This is sort of an indicator of how hot DFI tokens are relative to ETH. And that's staying flat.
00:18:15.990 - 00:18:35.810, Speaker B: It's staying flat. It's right above the line that I called the low at, which was zero. That's where I called the bottom of the DPI versus eth chart. We are still above it. We are still above it, but not by a healthy margin. And so we are currently at zero six dpi per eth. Per dpi.
00:18:35.810 - 00:18:51.526, Speaker B: Yes, eth per dpi. And it's still in this kind of long term, downtrend channel ish, since April, has not yet broken out of a very long, steep downtrend. It's going to. At some point, it feels like this.
00:18:51.628 - 00:18:56.230, Speaker A: DFI summer ish, the end of defi summer. Look how much higher it was.
00:18:56.300 - 00:19:12.790, Speaker B: Right? And that's the bullcase for DFI tokens, is a returning to DFI summer levels, which is basically a two to three x versus ether. Not versus dollars, but versus ether. And I think there's a ticking time bomb until that happens, in my opinion.
00:19:12.950 - 00:19:36.594, Speaker A: Versus ether is interesting. I mean, if they both go up together, David, then this ratio doesn't move. So we'll have to see how that plays out. Well, let's talk about something that is playing out in a big way. That is DFI exchange volume. Dex volume just shooting right up, like absolutely massive. If you include things like pancake swap, then the volume was over 300 billion last month.
00:19:36.594 - 00:19:38.962, Speaker A: I don't know if I would include pancake swap.
00:19:39.026 - 00:19:40.646, Speaker B: I'll put an asterisk next to it.
00:19:40.668 - 00:20:07.870, Speaker A: There's an asterisk there. But DFI exchange volume is growing. Of course, during the recent downtrend, DFI exchanges were the only ones left standing. For a brief period of time, they consumed all of the volume. They performed pretty spectacularly, I would say, with a 60% to 70% drop. And just like seeing some super impressive volumes that are absolutely dwarfing anything we saw in 2020. Any takes here?
00:20:07.940 - 00:20:34.520, Speaker B: Yeah, liquidity providers during the last two weeks got absolutely paid. And so if you have been learning about uniswap v three, congrats. I bet you got a decent amount of fees in the last couple of weeks since March. So for the last two months or three months, we have two X Dex volumes consistently. So March was just below 100 billion, April was just below 200 billion, and now we are just above 300 billion monthly Dex volume. Crazy.
00:20:35.130 - 00:21:08.162, Speaker A: Yeah. This is another cool way to look at Dex volume, which is the dominance of Dex volume for ETH or ERC, 20 pairs. And this is particularly uniswap volume versus Coinbase volume. Look at this, David. Uniswap is absolutely killing Coinbase in terms of USDC to ETH, 784,000,000 volume on Uniswap versus 59 million volume on coinsbase. Like, absolutely. What is that? I mean, like 15 x or something.
00:21:08.162 - 00:21:34.326, Speaker A: Something close to that. ETH to bitcoin. Uniswap is doing more volume than Coinbase on ETH to bitcoin. This is, of course, wrapped bitcoin, but same, same ETH to USDT. Uniswap is even beating Coinbase on that. These numbers blow me away, dude. I would not have imagined this is possible in 2020 for Uniswap to just start dominating Coinbase in terms of exchange volume.
00:21:34.326 - 00:21:38.922, Speaker A: And we're in the middle of a bull run. Right? So how does this happen? What's going on?
00:21:39.056 - 00:22:04.130, Speaker B: It's the protocol sync thesis playing out. Uniswap is easier to use. Dfi is easier to use than CFI, and if you're a newcomer, that statement might seem foreign to you. But as you become more and more used to how defi works, all of a sudden these defi apps are just like the shelling point as to where to go. Liquidity is straight up better in DFI, and usability is straight up better. And so the protocol sync thesis predicted this.
00:22:04.280 - 00:22:46.690, Speaker A: And guess who wins when that happens? Hayden Adams with another tweet here. Hyper efficient stablecoin trading on Uniswap V three has already resulted in one Coinbase pro reducing their fees by 100%, their maker fees, and their taker fees by 98%, and curve increasing the efficiency amplification across its pools as well. So when a new, better, more capital efficient d five protocol machine, we talked about these things being like money robots. All these money robots are at war with each other for liquidity. Who benefits? Defi users benefit. It's fantastic. Crypto natives benefit.
00:22:46.690 - 00:23:28.670, Speaker A: Keep these wars going, man, because we're just getting better, more capital efficient markets. And this is why, by the way, David, these markets are going to eat the rest of the traditional financial world, because they're in this kind of darwinian jungle here. They're at war, and they're, like, leveling up and getting better, and it's complete survival of the fittest. Traditional finance is outside of the jungle, somewhere else. But once these organisms adapt, and once they break out of the jungle that they're in, they will start eating Nasdaq, eating York Stock exchange, eating the rest of the traditional financial world, and the banks won't know what hits them.
00:23:28.740 - 00:23:29.070, Speaker B: Right?
00:23:29.140 - 00:23:30.394, Speaker A: That's the D five bullcase.
00:23:30.442 - 00:23:59.634, Speaker B: Yeah. The takeaway that I have from this is that Coinbase and another DFI protocol had to forego capturing fees because of the competition that uniswap V three put on the table. Right? It's like, oh. The only reason why Coinbase was able to capture those fees was because there wasn't really a viable alternative. Therefore, they had the best product and they would charge fees for it. They no longer have the best product, and now they had to basically eliminate their stablecoin trading fees because of what uniswap V three brought to the table.
00:23:59.762 - 00:24:15.662, Speaker A: You know what's kind of cool? A byproduct of this, David, is now that Coinbase is a publicly traded company, the Wall street analysts are going to be like, looking into Coinbase's revenue and being like, oh, why did we have to reduce maker fees by 100%? Oh, it's because a D five protocol uniswap, like, what is this thing?
00:24:15.716 - 00:24:17.422, Speaker B: Which has a token that we can buy.
00:24:17.556 - 00:24:30.098, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Wow. That's how they learn about uniswap and DFI and the token. It's all going to play out that way, I think. Totally. All right, let's talk about flipping metrics. Here are a few.
00:24:30.098 - 00:24:31.842, Speaker A: Should we just read these out? Why don't you start?
00:24:31.896 - 00:24:55.782, Speaker B: Let's burn through these. There's eight total metrics with graphs ago on the screen, ETh flipped BTC in several metrics in May. Many metrics are now measured in the trillions or are close to it. First metric is total adjusted on chain volume increased by 35% to a new all time high of $1 trillion. Combined with bitcoin and ether. And ether is the majority of that volume. Like 60 40 ish.
00:24:55.926 - 00:25:11.674, Speaker A: Not other stablecoins. It's ether. Yeah, it's not other years. Two twenty s. All right, this is the second. Adjusted on chain volume of stablecoins increased by 52% to a new all time high of 766,000,000,000. Pretty impressive.
00:25:11.722 - 00:25:32.678, Speaker B: Very impressive. What do we got next up? While BTC minor revenue continued to decrease by 15% to 1.5 billion. Ether minor revenue increased by 42% to a new all time high of $2.35 billion. This is the first time since June 2017 that ether minor revenue exceeded bitcoin minor revenue. And minor revenue is blockchain security.
00:25:32.678 - 00:25:41.658, Speaker B: And security is basically the fundamental reason why this whole industry works. And so Ethereum miners are being compensated better than bitcoin miners in this current month.
00:25:41.824 - 00:25:44.614, Speaker A: David, Ethereum, the more economically secure network.
00:25:44.662 - 00:25:47.980, Speaker B: Now, last month it was for this month.
00:25:48.430 - 00:26:08.274, Speaker A: Yeah. Month of May, legitimate centralized exchange spot volume increased by 38% to a new all time high. Pretty impressive. Making it the fourth time this has ever happened. Wait. Oh, this is on chain volume of ETH as an asset. Is that what we're talking about here?
00:26:08.472 - 00:26:23.046, Speaker B: No. Legitimate centralized exchange spot volume increased by 40%. And so this is just all the exchanges out there are experiencing more volume. So kind of just a bull market indicator. It's just the volume on centralized exchanges going up and to the right.
00:26:23.228 - 00:26:25.766, Speaker A: That's not related to you flipping at all?
00:26:25.948 - 00:26:28.834, Speaker B: These are flipping in general. Flipping.
00:26:28.882 - 00:26:38.060, Speaker A: I see. Okay, so it's not ETH to bitcoin flipping, it's just flipping in general. Okay. Daily average volume of GBDC stabilized at 419,000,000.
00:26:38.830 - 00:26:52.830, Speaker B: That's really good because the GBTC lack of premium, whatever, the dying of a premium, it has been dying, but now it hit a floor so far and starting to resume parity, which is kind of like people are breathing a sigh of relief on that one.
00:26:52.980 - 00:26:56.362, Speaker A: Thought that would happen. I'm glad it is. What's this next one?
00:26:56.436 - 00:27:06.478, Speaker B: Bitcoin future volumes increased by 30% to a new all time high of $2.5 trillion in the month of May. Finance alone traded a trillion dollars in bitcoin futures.
00:27:06.654 - 00:27:26.746, Speaker A: Jeez. I mean, these crypto banks are just crushing it in terms of fees. As for ETH futures volume increased sharply by almost 100%, 94% to a new all time high of 1.7 trillion. Ether as well becoming financialized as a reserve crypto asset. What's the last one?
00:27:26.848 - 00:27:48.802, Speaker B: However, the real story is on the derivatives front continues to be ETH options. The trade volume of bitcoin and Ethereum options in a monthly has increased up to 60% and so ether futures volume going really strong up into the right and is 60% as large as bitcoin volume future volume trading. So pretty cool.
00:27:48.936 - 00:28:15.500, Speaker A: Yeah, David, I saw that ether went from basically nothing relative to bitcoin in futures volume on derabit in 2019 2020 to now getting closer to parity and maybe actually flipping darabit if the trend continues. Flipping on derabit volume. Anyway, lots of good stuff going on, David. We're going to get to releases in just a minute, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this roll up possible.
00:28:16.030 - 00:28:55.938, Speaker B: Synthetix is Ethereum's decentralized derivatives liquidity protocol. What does that mean? Synthetics is a platform for creating and trading synthetic assets, which are assets that are priced via an oracle. Rather than bids or asks, traders can use the quinta exchange, which hosts and trades all of the synthetic assets created by synthetix. Traders on quinta can trade synthetic tokens like SBtc s Oil or SDEFI. Because quinta is powered by synthetics, traders experience zero slippage on their trades. No, I didn't mean low slippage, I meant no slippage because that is the power of the synthetics platform. No slippage on your trades.
00:28:55.938 - 00:30:02.502, Speaker B: You can also easily short assets with isynths, which are synthetic assets that move inversely to their target asset synthetics isn't just for traders. Developers can build on synthetics to access the infinite liquidity offered by synthetic assets, or investors can stake collateral to the protocol and earn fees that the protocol collects. If you're a trader and you're looking for a trading platform not found in the legacy world, check out quenta IO. If you're a developer or you just want to earn yield on your collateral, go to www dot synthetics IO where you can stake your SNX or ETH and earn fees from synthetics. Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol.
00:30:02.502 - 00:30:43.400, Speaker B: If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's v two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on uniswap and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them. Check out the power of aave@ave.com that's aave.com.
00:30:44.410 - 00:31:06.138, Speaker A: Alright guys, we are back with the hot releases. David, we gotta start here. Arbitrum Man, Arbitrum is everything I thought it would be after our conversation with them on City of the nation on Tuesday. I'm super excited about this project, about roll ups in general. They just launched their developer, Mainnet Beta. Can you describe what's included in that launch?
00:31:06.234 - 00:31:55.194, Speaker B: Right, so Arbitrum has cut the red tape and allowed the developers to enter this new land, the new arbitrum real estate, the new suburb of Ethereum. And on the suburb of Ethereum, things go really fast for really cheap. And as far as a user experience goes, we haven't experienced this ourselves because right now it's developers only. But basically this is like if you've used a polygon bridge, much like that, but I think even faster as a bridge but you just go into metamask, and then when your money is over on Arbitrum, you just go and pick the arbitrum network, and then all of a sudden, you're in the super fast highway that is Arbitrum. And so Arbitrum has already had a number of projects. I think they said over 250 projects express interest in building on Arbitrum. There are some projects that have already released the fact that they have finished building and now are almost ready to open up to users.
00:31:55.194 - 00:32:35.520, Speaker B: Sushi swap, Uniswap, dodo decks, alchemy Mc decks. All of these teams are building on Arbitrum, building out the rides for all the users to come on. Right. And so right now, it's developers only because developers have to go build the things for the users to use. But users are coming, like, I think, to Arbitrum, maybe as early as next week. I bet you the first thing is going to happen is sushi swap is going to release, because they are just known for moving really fast. Ryan, we were talking earlier about which particular DFI tokens are going to be well suited to a DFI summer layer two edition, and I think sushi swap is at the top of that list just because they are known to just pound out integrations and new products.
00:32:35.520 - 00:32:57.140, Speaker B: I kind of think that sushiswap is going to be the first thing that is available on Arbitrum. But so many other projects are coming right on the heels of Sushiswap. And so congrats to arbitrum. Congrats to all the teams building on Arbitrum. And congrats to all the users who really have just felt sidelined by high gas fees on Ethereum. Congratulations. Arbitrum may be your new home.
00:32:57.670 - 00:33:18.202, Speaker A: Yeah. And this is happening fast. Like David said, the builders are building out the rides, but the reality is what they can actually do is just port the rides that they had from another area of the theme park into Arbitrum. When we asked the arbitram folks how long it takes to move smart contracts from Mainnet into Arbitrum, they're like, copy and paste. A few hours. Yeah, like a couple days. You got to test it, of course.
00:33:18.202 - 00:33:44.146, Speaker A: But this is EVM compatible, which means you can sort of hotswap some of these contracts, and there are some small changes, but not a lot. So super optimistic that this is coming soon. David said next week maybe might take a little bit longer, but this is definitely a summertime thing. This is definitely a June July thing. So super exciting. Anyway, this is great, great stuff. We're going to talk more about that toward the end.
00:33:44.248 - 00:34:00.586, Speaker B: I said this last week, but this changes everything about Ethereum. Like l two s. And specifically, this type of construction of l two s has been anticipated since even before the first block of Ethereum was mined. And so this is a big deal.
00:34:00.768 - 00:34:14.382, Speaker A: Yeah, well, we just talked to Vance Spencer. That's coming out on Monday, guys. Monday podcast. Tune into that. Vance Spencer is a vc at Framework Ventures. We talked extensively about layer two and what it means. It is a major step change.
00:34:14.382 - 00:34:36.094, Speaker A: So make sure you tune into that episode, too for more. Okay. Coinbase links its visa debit card with Apple Pay and Google pay. So now I'm just questioning why we need traditional could. If I could just use Coinbase and defi, or Gemini and defi. That's all I need, man. I don't need Wells Fargo.
00:34:36.094 - 00:34:40.822, Speaker A: I can pay my bills. I don't think the banks realize what is coming for them.
00:34:40.876 - 00:34:54.060, Speaker B: Right. They don't think of Coinbase as a bank. They think of it as a crypto exchange. And that's their fault. That's going to be their downfall. I would much rather have my gusto direct deposit go straight to Coinbase. That would be fine.
00:34:54.060 - 00:35:00.390, Speaker B: Coinbase. I can choose. Do I send it out to the real world to buy my coffee, or do I send it out to Ethereum?
00:35:00.470 - 00:35:04.190, Speaker A: Let me ask you, what's stopping you? I know you legit have a Wells Fargo account.
00:35:04.260 - 00:35:07.070, Speaker B: Okay, don't dox me like that.
00:35:07.140 - 00:35:12.334, Speaker A: Sorry I doxxed you, bro. Okay, so I know you have one. What's stopping you?
00:35:12.372 - 00:35:13.470, Speaker B: Is that a threat?
00:35:14.550 - 00:35:27.474, Speaker A: I know it exists. I've seen you at Wells Fargo. I know where those checks go, those paper checks. Okay, but what's stopping you from shutting that thing down, man? I know it's not the savings rate.
00:35:27.672 - 00:35:34.440, Speaker B: That's very true. It's because I got to pay rent and I got to pay my credit cards. But after that, nothing stays in my bank account.
00:35:35.450 - 00:35:41.654, Speaker A: There you go. It's over. It's over, guys. They don't know it yet, but it's over anyway. Rip banks. Let's go. Gnosis.
00:35:41.654 - 00:35:42.826, Speaker A: What's gnosis doing?
00:35:42.928 - 00:36:16.646, Speaker B: Gnosis, partnering with the open Ethereum client to make a new Ethereum. One client called Aragon, spelled Erigon. And so this has kind of been an evolution of a long standing ethereum client. A fork of geth turned into Turbogeth turned into open Ethereum, which is now Aragon. And so we have a brand new Ethereum, one client that is being maintained by gnosis. And we have heard some really rave reviews from some developers in this space. Here's Banteg out of the urine team saying Aragon is so with three O's good.
00:36:16.646 - 00:36:28.454, Speaker B: Can you imagine scanning traces from the entire history of Ethereum in under 5 seconds? It can do that. Even Ethereum one innovation still moving forward at a solid tick rate.
00:36:28.572 - 00:36:56.766, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm glad. And this actually means nosis is sort of an ecosystem contributor. The public good, which is the Ethereum protocol, they took over the old parity client. They're shutting that code base down in favor of this turbogeth code base because I think it's just better. So really excited about that. Let's talk about what Argent is doing. Argent, one of our favorite smart contract wallets, now has a more secure and convenient way to provide liquidity to uniswap.
00:36:56.766 - 00:37:19.222, Speaker A: V three, one button. Argent user interface is just immaculate. I feel like David, the thing that has held Argent back to this point is not being on layer two, but once they're on layer two, they have integrations like this where it's one click into uniswap, it's over. It's going to be just a really exciting user experience in defi. Any takes here?
00:37:19.276 - 00:37:42.778, Speaker B: Yeah. The other innovation is that there's actually multiple transactions being bundled all into one. And so that's also really the through line here. When you lp for Uniswap, you have to approve two tokens and then deposit. Right? So one approval, second approval, and then a depositing transaction. Argent has this bundled all into one single transaction. And this is also a story of Ethereum block space being consumed more efficiently.
00:37:42.778 - 00:38:01.958, Speaker B: Rather than three separate transactions, we're bundling it into one. It's less time for the user, it's less block space demand by the consumers. And so people often forget that a very real way to scale Ethereum is to do the same things while finding innovative ways to consume less block space. And that's what's going on here, do.
00:38:01.964 - 00:38:25.662, Speaker A: You know, like custodying your private keys, that sort of thing, with ledger metamask, it's still clunky today, right? People are asking about when's that venmo experience coming? Argent. Any sort of smart contract wallet like Argent plus layer two, plus these d five protocols, right? Give it a year, it's going to be better than Venmo, it's going to be way better than. Give it two years, it's going to be five x better, ten x better.
00:38:25.716 - 00:38:25.982, Speaker B: Sure.
00:38:26.036 - 00:38:45.934, Speaker A: Like this is happening so fast. I'm super excited about it. Vitalik predicted this too, when we had him on the podcast in December. Smart contract layer two native wallets. Okay, let's talk about this. This is Maker's multi chain strategy. This is directly from their governance forms.
00:38:45.934 - 00:39:04.410, Speaker A: I think it's interesting because maker, of course, is one of the oldest D five protocols. They've stayed primarily on Ethereum to date, but now they're looking at a multi chain future. The question for them is, how will defi grow and where will the liquidity go? That's how Defi protocols make these decisions. What's the story here?
00:39:04.480 - 00:39:30.226, Speaker B: Yeah, Maker is actually newly, completely a Dao because the foundation has basically sunseted. There are a few people working for the foundation left really just to wrap things up. But Maker is now completely a non centralized entity. That is dow only. And the Dow is saying, hey, let's capture more fees. And so Maker has started to have conversations about putting Maker dow on different chains. Putting Dai on different chains, right.
00:39:30.226 - 00:40:10.234, Speaker B: So not only Ethereum and not only ethereum l two, like Polygon and XDI, but also non Ethereum chains like polka Dot, Cosmos and Solana. And so this is just a good business first move. If there are fees out there to capture, you should go capture it, because if you don't, someone's going to capture them for you with their clone of your project. So you better just get there first. And so Makerdao, I don't know to what degree are they actually putting the Makerdao facility on Solana or on Polygon or on Polkadot, but at the very least they are putting dai there. And dai demand on polygon. Dai demand on Solana ultimately feeds back to MKR value capture on Ethereum.
00:40:10.234 - 00:40:13.318, Speaker B: And so Makerdao really pushing the fold.
00:40:13.514 - 00:40:53.870, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny because their preference is for EVM compatibility, right? Because they've invested so much and also for permissionless, decentralized chains. That's kind of their preference, but they're open to other layer ones at all. And what I would say is, if you want to truly understand where this industry is going, look where the builders are. Like, that's your map. I mean, at some level, like what David and I say or what some other, like what a venture capitalist who's pitching the Solana layer one, they really want you to buy soul tokens. What they say doesn't really matter. It's about where the builders go and what they believe, because builders are making a huge investment.
00:40:53.870 - 00:41:22.562, Speaker A: Where are we going to spend our precious developer resources next? Is it on an ethereum layer? Two, is it on another competing layer one. We'll see. So read this post. It'll give you great insight. I think there's some alpha leaks there, if you're paying attention, David, let's get directly to the news. My friend uniswap just made CCTV. That's Chinese tv, China Central Television talking about Uniswap.
00:41:22.562 - 00:41:51.018, Speaker A: That's what that is. Okay, so they're talking about it in the context of how to avoid scams. But here's what's so hilarious to me, is actually they're showing you how to use Uniswap on tv broadcast to I'm not sure how many millions of people in China. And Hayden's tweet is kind of funny on this. Step one, China blocks uniswap interface. I guess maybe they have already. Step two, China demos uniswap interface on CCTV.
00:41:51.018 - 00:41:57.920, Speaker A: Step three, question mark, what happens? I mean, like, isn't this just playing into, isn't this the nation state?
00:41:58.390 - 00:42:36.022, Speaker B: Somebody fucked up. You think so? I think somebody had an oopsies. Somebody did not think about. Because the uniswap, if you look on the screen, it says the decentralized exchange. What is more antithetical to China than something that is decentralized? And so I don't think somebody wasn't informed enough to put two and two together about how this technology is extremely subversive to the state and specifically China, which wants to have total totalitarian control. Something like Uniswap is exactly what they don't want. And they are accidentally broadcasting this on their internal closed circuit television channels.
00:42:36.166 - 00:43:28.474, Speaker A: It's hilarious. It's like the more they say, don't look at this, don't talk about this, don't use this, the more people are going to get interested in it. So they are propagating the narrative that is the value of decentralization. But there is a little bit of, I guess, double speak going on in China, I feel like, because here is a story that broke about China's digital yuan effort, and this is a spokesperson for the central bank digital currency that China is building and talking about it potentially being available on Ethereum, too. And I totally understand that, because if you're a central bank digital currency, you want to invade all of the other economies of the world. And by invade, I just mean like, you want your currency to be represented and to accrue value and to be used as a unit of exchange, unit of account, medium of exchange, store value in those economies. And what is Ethereum? Ethereum is just another economy.
00:43:28.474 - 00:43:50.822, Speaker A: But this story is interesting. Because I do see that's an inevitability of central bank digital currencies. They will absolutely want to be on smart contract networks like Ethereum. And it looks like the nation state is paying attention to these developments. They see the power of smart contracts and Defi and programmable money, and they're looking to kind of marshal that as well. Yeah.
00:43:50.876 - 00:44:21.306, Speaker B: China definitely wants its yuan to be as close to the world's reserve currency as possible. They are very jealous that that's what the dollar is. And so naturally, they want to claim defi real estate as, like, the future of economies. Right. If the future economic activity of the world is on DeFi, then the digital yuan needs to be there. I'm reminded of our Josh Rosenthal episode where to some degree, it's a lose lose for China either way, right? Because are they really going to become the world's reserve currency by invading defi? Not really. Not even the Chinese want the digital yuan.
00:44:21.306 - 00:44:41.138, Speaker B: It's forced upon them. And so if they want to claim that real estate, they have to put the digital yuan there. But then that means that they give on ramps and off ramps to people who are using the digital yuan, who want something else, like dollars or ether or bitcoin. Right. And so they are giving an exit opportunity to people that use the yuan. It's damned if you do, damned if you don't.
00:44:41.314 - 00:45:13.386, Speaker A: Yeah. You know what, long term, I think the authoritarian states play is whatever state it is, whether the US goes in that direction or whether it's China continues. I feel like it's a state controlled binance chain, essentially. So you get the programmable money, but you also have the state surveillance and the control over the entire economic system. Right. They're not there yet, but that is the threat. For how? I don't think, at this point nation states ever turn off cryptocurrency because they can't and they know they can't.
00:45:13.386 - 00:45:36.150, Speaker A: And they know, to your point, just plays right into their hands, but they will try to co opt it. And I feel like the binance chain gives sort of early roadmap indication of how that might be co opted. You just make it super useful, easy for everybody, like, integrated in your life. But, oops, we have all of the buttons to stop transactions, censor transactions, cut you out of the world's economic system.
00:45:36.220 - 00:45:39.542, Speaker B: Make you disappear on chain and then off chain.
00:45:39.686 - 00:45:53.100, Speaker A: Scary. Okay. Ether has a high chance of eclipsing bitcoin as Crypto's dominant store of value. Wow. It sounds like something bankless might say, but not bankless. This is banks saying it.
00:45:53.470 - 00:45:58.414, Speaker B: Look, man, let's not provide any legitimacy to Goldman Sachs and their opinion as.
00:45:58.452 - 00:46:02.574, Speaker A: To what they say about crypto. But they must have a position, though.
00:46:02.612 - 00:46:13.730, Speaker B: It's a headline that a lot of people are reading. That's the through line here is like Goldman Sachs. A lot of people listen to Goldman Sachs, even though we don't listen to Goldman Sachs. They are making this headline available to the world. So that's like the takeaway here.
00:46:13.880 - 00:46:16.626, Speaker A: They must have a position too, in order to say that that's usually what.
00:46:16.648 - 00:46:18.114, Speaker B: Goldman Sachs is up to.
00:46:18.232 - 00:46:35.546, Speaker A: All right, here's something interesting that happened bitwise. So this is sort of an institutionally friendly way to get access to all sorts of crypto assets, but in particular in this case, defi tokens. Bitwise. Actually, no, this is their large cap crypto index. Okay, excuse me.
00:46:35.568 - 00:46:38.426, Speaker B: I don't think that it counts as a defi token just because it's on Ethereum, too.
00:46:38.528 - 00:46:53.210, Speaker A: Right on. Bitwise has a whole bunch of more centralized, institutionally friendly indices where you can get exposure to crypto assets. I've long hated kind of their large cap crypto index. Not because it's a bad index, it's.
00:46:53.210 - 00:46:56.334, Speaker B: A fault of their own. They just don't. No fault of their own selection.
00:46:56.462 - 00:47:36.730, Speaker A: Just so much garbage in there. And there's been garbage from the get go, things like XRP, things that don't have a chance to succeed as a store of value. But anyway, Polygon has entered the Bitwise ten large cap crypto index for the first time. And I think that's super interesting. This is the first, number one, I guess it's the first of two things. Number one, it's the first layer, two, or side chain, I should say, from Ethereum to be ported into the top ten. The other thing is, the interesting part of this is the asset that it kicked out is from Cosmos.
00:47:36.730 - 00:48:05.158, Speaker A: Their asset, Atom and Cosmos talked for a very long time about becoming the Internet of chains by creating sort of a parallel universe to Ethereum. So there's some irony here, which is like Maddox is taking a similar playbook and design. It's the same value prop, same value prop, but it's making sort of Ethereum as a settlement layer its Internet of chains, and there's some irony in it. Just booted Adam from the top ten slot. Any takes here?
00:48:05.244 - 00:48:58.706, Speaker B: Yeah, my take here is that this is something that we've talked about in the Ethereum ecosystem for years now. There is a bunch of absolute crap in the top ten of crypto assets. I don't think litecoin or bitcoin cash is there anymore, but they used to be in the top ten, and then there were very legitimate, very real DFI tokens that just were in like 50 and below. And so a big narrative in 2018 and 2019 and even 2020 was that eventually there's going to be a repricing repricing, a repricing between just the crap like EOS and litecoin with actual real DFI tokens with cash flows. What we are seeing here is we are seeing Ethereum native infrastructure being repriced into large cap top ten DFI tokens. To be honest, I kind of wish it hadn't pushed out Cosmos. Because of all the things in the top ten, Cosmos isn't actually kind of a nice asset.
00:48:58.818 - 00:49:00.742, Speaker A: Cosmos has some traction, right?
00:49:00.796 - 00:49:11.834, Speaker B: Yeah, I wish it had pushed out things like litecoin and bitcoin cash. But the comparison between Cosmos getting pushed out by something that is basically the same value prop but Ethereum specific is interesting.
00:49:12.032 - 00:49:59.100, Speaker A: Yeah, it's very interesting. David, NFT world there's always stuff going on in NFT space, but I picked this one out. This was an article written by our own William Pister in Metaversal, which if you're not subscribed to Metaversal, this is a great place to get updates on what's going on in the NFT space. But he wrote an article about how to get virtual land on like, in the metaverse, actually buying digital property. Buying digital real estate, right? So I've long thought about this, like, okay, own cryptocurrencies. When is the right time to start buying digital parcels of land? And you can do that on something called sandbox decentraland, which has been a longtime VR type project on Ethereum crypto voxels, which listeners may be familiar with, I've not heard much about.
00:50:00.430 - 00:50:01.694, Speaker B: How do you say this?
00:50:01.812 - 00:50:29.366, Speaker A: Somnium. Somnium space. Anyway, I started thinking about when there will come a point in time when it is the right time to buy virtual land. Right. I haven't fallen in love with a VR digital environment yet where I'm like, oh, this is so awesome. I can't not have property here, but there will come a time when I anticipate jumping into the space here. What's your take on this? Do you own any virtual land?
00:50:29.468 - 00:51:06.222, Speaker B: Yeah, I do not own any virtual land. I feel like it's the same kind of game as to just nft speculation, right? To some degree, if you own a crypto punk, that kind of feels similar as to owning a little bit of Internet real estate, because of the way that crypto punks are kind of treated as defi users, right. It's like I have a claim on a cryptopunk, kind of feels the same. It's very, very speculative, because we don't know if any of these virtual land real estates comes the canonical real estate. The reason why real estate in the real world is such an easy investment is because there's not seven versions of real estate, like, different dimensions of real estate, there's just actual real estate.
00:51:06.286 - 00:51:08.206, Speaker A: And it can't just be, like, forked or created.
00:51:08.238 - 00:51:27.250, Speaker B: Exactly right. So, like virtual real estate, which we. Virtual estate. Virtual estate. There isn't one virtual estate. There are many, many virtual estates. So if you buy virtual estate, then you are speculating that that virtual estate becomes like the kind of shelling point of virtual estate.
00:51:27.250 - 00:51:36.602, Speaker B: So I'm not ready to start speculating in that world yet, but it's definitely going to be a thing. Virtual estate will absolutely be a real thing. For sure.
00:51:36.656 - 00:51:48.590, Speaker A: It's going to be. Ready, player one. Right. We're moving to that world. So I'm waiting, I'm looking at this. I think there are some pioneers who are much earlier. Maybe these are good deals, maybe they're not, I have no idea.
00:51:48.590 - 00:51:59.394, Speaker A: But I'm sort of waiting myself, David, for that. I enter this world and I immediately fall in love with it. Like, oh, this is it. I would use this. I want to come back here. I want to set up shop here. And I have.
00:51:59.432 - 00:52:01.220, Speaker B: I can see myself retiring here.
00:52:04.310 - 00:52:05.914, Speaker A: Oh, my God, this is so weird.
00:52:05.982 - 00:52:19.862, Speaker B: Dystopian future, though, is something where somebody like some big company like Facebook owns it all or steam or valve makes virtual real estate, and that becomes like it's theirs. I could see that happening as well.
00:52:19.996 - 00:52:22.440, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Well, I'm not buying in those.
00:52:22.970 - 00:52:25.274, Speaker B: Think they'll sell them to you? That's the thing.
00:52:25.392 - 00:52:39.230, Speaker A: Let's talk about this. This is the bitcoin news. I think we're kind of struggling to find something on bitcoin this week, actually, there's generally a lot, but this week was kind of a quiet week on bitcoin. But the bitcoin car is making headlines. What's happening here? What is the bitcoin car?
00:52:39.300 - 00:53:12.954, Speaker B: Yeah, like a bunch of bitcoiners. Crowdfunded sponsorship of like, an Indy 500 car. And funnily enough, NBC Sports Twitter account reported that the Indy 500 averaged a. I don't know what Tad is, but 5.5 million viewers, making it the most watched Indy 500 in five years because there was a goddamn bitcoin car. Like all the bitcoiners, all of a sudden start caring about Indy 500 because there's a bitcoin car. And then Jack Mallers, who was on the DFI panel with me at Coindesk, consensus event, I don't know why he was there.
00:53:12.954 - 00:53:39.250, Speaker B: He represents a little crypto bank. He goes, I wonder why the most popular car at the most watch Indy 500 in last five years arrives at the bitcoin conference tomorrow in Miami to donate to bitcoin open source development. Open networks wins. Bitcoins wins. And so I guess congratulations to bitcoiners. Here's the coolest news that's happened in bitcoin in the last seven days is a bitcoin car in Indy 500, and it'll be at Miami. Like, congrats, I guess.
00:53:39.400 - 00:54:15.322, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, this feels like just a poor man's version of Gitcoin, to be honest, because I'm really excited that this goes to open source development and that the community is coming around and doing something good for a public good, which is bitcoin protocol development, which is a public good. Absolutely. But I don't know. It feels so weak sauce after, you know, about gitcoin and quadratic funding and what's going on in that economy to create self sustainable public goods. It just feels weak sauce.
00:54:15.386 - 00:54:32.050, Speaker B: Right. This is why we say it feels like bitcoin. At least bitcoin macds have kind of lost the plot, right? Because why are you so incredibly excited about a bitcoin sponsored ND 500 car when there is everything going on in DFI, like, happening next door and you are purposefully not paying attention to that?
00:54:32.120 - 00:54:38.502, Speaker A: You know what would have been excited about that? Yeah, it's from 2015, dude. That would have been exciting in 2015.
00:54:38.556 - 00:54:42.680, Speaker B: That's what Dogecoin did it in 2014. Like, doge already did this.
00:54:45.050 - 00:54:45.586, Speaker A: Bitcoin.
00:54:45.618 - 00:54:46.950, Speaker B: They're behind Doge.
00:54:47.930 - 00:55:06.430, Speaker A: We're having Preston pitch on Wednesday. That's going to be fun. It's going to be a good episode. I think that hopefully it's going to be open minded and we'll both talk about these types of things. I won't mention the bitcoin car, though. If you don't, I might make sure you don't. No promises.
00:55:06.430 - 00:55:11.002, Speaker A: All right. Regulation bitConnect. Remember bitconnect?
00:55:11.066 - 00:55:12.320, Speaker B: Bitcoin eight.
00:55:13.250 - 00:55:13.758, Speaker A: Nice.
00:55:13.844 - 00:55:14.500, Speaker B: Hey, hey, hey.
00:55:15.910 - 00:55:46.490, Speaker A: All right. The SEC charged the promoters of bitconnect, which includes a youtuber, a few youtubers. I was not watching crypto scams in YouTube in 2017, but there were a lot of promoters of bitConnect. I guess the interesting thing here is they're finally being charged by the SEC and David one bull market later, like January 2017. That's four years ago. More than four years ago. I think that the take here is that regulators move slow.
00:55:46.490 - 00:56:03.182, Speaker A: I'm glad that they're targeting a complete scam in this case. This is actually protecting consumers. This is within the SEC's mandate. Good job, SEc. Like, seriously, you got that? I legitimately mean that. But, like, four.
00:56:03.316 - 00:56:04.718, Speaker B: Right, right.
00:56:04.804 - 00:56:07.170, Speaker A: Takes regulators a long time to react to what's going on.
00:56:07.240 - 00:56:14.994, Speaker B: Yeah. And should have gone to jail. Should have gone to jail. $2 billion. Didn't have. Beside the point. They wrecked people's lives.
00:56:14.994 - 00:56:16.290, Speaker B: They should have gone to jail.
00:56:16.790 - 00:56:19.158, Speaker A: Yeah, but we got some memes out of it.
00:56:19.244 - 00:56:20.194, Speaker B: We did get some good memes.
00:56:20.242 - 00:56:44.542, Speaker A: Public good. All right, good news from Balaji, our friend. So there have been some disturbing news going on in India about kind of central bank government crackdown on cryptocurrency. But this is some good news. The Reserve bank of India is directing indian banks to stop deplatforming crypto customers. That's what was happening. So if you're in India and you're using your bank account to do something in crypto, they would just deplatform you.
00:56:44.542 - 00:57:02.050, Speaker A: Sorry. Send you a dear John letter, like, sorry, you have no account here anymore. You've been disbanded. Here's a letter where the Royal bank of India is saying, the Reserve bank of India, excuse me, is saying, we need to stop doing that. So some good news there.
00:57:02.200 - 00:57:16.754, Speaker B: And people predicted this. I think Nick Carter really predicted this, is like, oh, yeah, you ban bitcoin, you're just going to roll that back in a couple of weeks or a month or so. And that's exactly what happened. When you ban bitcoin, you actually just ban your citizens from engaging with bitcoin. You don't actually ban bitcoin.
00:57:16.882 - 00:57:30.890, Speaker A: And also, there's money to be made for these banks. Right. Like, are they reading the Coinbase Sec filings? I hope so. All right, some quick drive bys as of today. This is from Anthony Sasano. The e two beacon chain has been live for six months, maybe six months.
00:57:30.960 - 00:57:37.454, Speaker B: Cool. Six months of Lindy under the belt and getting closer and closer to the merge, maybe in five or six months later.
00:57:37.652 - 00:57:49.666, Speaker A: Wow. No major events there. It's gone fairly smoothly. All right, let's talk about this. So stablecoin company earning record levels of investment. This is circle. What's happening here.
00:57:49.688 - 00:58:20.234, Speaker B: Yeah. Circle raised $440,000,000 from investors private investments, from an array of private equity, institutional and strategic investors. That's a large number. And this is just indicative of the tailwinds behind crypto dollars in DFI. Why is crypto dollars in DFI such an awesome opportunity? It's because you're getting yields, consistent yields above, like, 8%. And I'm getting yields as high as 20% on my crypto dollars thanks to Alchemyx and urine. Right.
00:58:20.234 - 00:58:38.114, Speaker B: And so where are you getting 20% yields in dollar terms in the legacy world? Like, you aren't. And so this is a massive opportunity for people who don't really care or want to own crypto assets, but they want to have dollar denominated yields, which is a large part of the world. This is what circle is capturing right now.
00:58:38.232 - 00:58:48.114, Speaker A: USDC is a great product. Fantastic product. Still banked, but it's a great product. All right, Justin Drake has a call out for us. He needs some help. What does he need help with, David?
00:58:48.162 - 00:59:23.294, Speaker B: Yeah, he says that all of these different ether logos, ether characters that people use on Twitter, the greek symbol z, the diamonds, he said they're all hacks. He goes east, deserves a unicode character. In 2015, I helped get the bitcoin unicode character for BTC. Justin Drake asks you, the listener, I need help for a leader to take up the reins and follow the template. He already has the template. He wants you to fill it out and make your argument as to why ether needs a Unicode character. If you want to take the reins on this and do something for Ethereum, which maybe it's just a Unicode character, but we would all use it, that can be you.
00:59:23.294 - 00:59:28.658, Speaker B: So if you are interested in taking up those reins, go to this tweet in the show notes and file that form.
00:59:28.824 - 00:59:35.346, Speaker A: David, Justin Drake helped get bitcoin, the bitcoin unicode character. That's the shocking news to me.
00:59:35.448 - 00:59:36.274, Speaker B: Yeah, fun fact.
00:59:36.312 - 00:59:36.990, Speaker A: Go, Justin.
00:59:37.070 - 00:59:38.254, Speaker B: Write that down for trivia.
00:59:38.382 - 00:59:49.030, Speaker A: He doesn't get thanked for that. All right, we're going to be back with the takes in just a moment, but before we do, we want to tell you about the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:59:49.180 - 01:00:24.866, Speaker B: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries just autonomous code on ethereum. Input the token you want to sell and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while, and we'll say it again.
01:00:24.866 - 01:00:52.922, Speaker B: Dows have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap Dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap Dow no matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a uni grant@unigrants.org and help steer Uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
01:00:52.922 - 01:01:30.502, Speaker B: That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you Uniswap for sponsoring bankless Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make. My crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens, and it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4%
01:01:30.502 - 01:02:16.166, Speaker B: interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset.

01:02:16.166 - 01:02:17.410, Speaker B: Gobankless.
01:02:17.570 - 01:02:29.654, Speaker A: All right, guys, we are back with the hot takes of the week. Let's start with this one from Koopa Trupa. He says this crypto literally pays to always be online. Literally getting paid to be online. What does he mean, David?
01:02:29.702 - 01:03:09.074, Speaker B: Yeah, so the world of crypto and the world of DFI has really turned the web two model of extraction on its head, right? And so the way that DFI apps compete is by rewarding users. And so to some degree, the more you have used DFI apps, the more you have been rewarded. The average DFI participant who came in at least in 2020 got at least three airdrops, currently worth at least like $40,000 in uniswap, one inch tornado cash. Ampleforth, the list goes on. And that's not the only thing. There are more instantiated versions of getting rewards. Basically, the more you use DFI, the more you get rewarded.
01:03:09.074 - 01:03:36.810, Speaker B: That's the new paradigm we are in web. Two apps they take from you. Dfi apps they give to you. You just have to use them. And I actually used this tweet in the bankless article that came out yesterday, Thursday because I talked about the dows and the future of work. And one of the missions of Daos is to lower the threshold for what viable good participation and contributions into dows are good. Dows will make that really, really easy for workers to contribute.
01:03:36.810 - 01:03:54.054, Speaker B: And the bullcase for Dao is that you just stumble into rewards. You just stumble into work and labor. And that is the future of web3, work. And Koopa has this summed up in a tweet. Nicely. Crypto literally pays you to always be online. The more you are in crypto, the more you get paid.
01:03:54.252 - 01:04:06.634, Speaker A: There you go. Good takes there. All right, let's see this next one. Long or short civilization? That's the take. Long ETH is long civilization. Long bitcoin is short civilization. Let me try to parse that out.
01:04:06.634 - 01:04:08.854, Speaker A: I think what this is saying is, that's spicy.
01:04:08.902 - 01:04:09.674, Speaker B: That's a spicy take.
01:04:09.712 - 01:04:46.934, Speaker A: It's kind of spicy, right? So if you are optimistic about the future of humanity, your asset is eth. Progress, like coordination, growth, civilization, societal growth, community improvement. If you are long bitcoin, it's like being short civilization. Right? Short collaboration, doomsday dollar disappears, nation states die. We go back to an era of less coordination, collaboration, where we need this gold like asset. What do you think of that take?
01:04:46.972 - 01:05:03.498, Speaker B: No, that's exactly right. Yeah. People who, coming from the legacy world will feel weird saying this or hearing this, but bitcoin is the risk off asset. Bitcoin is specifically risk off everything. Yeah, like gold. Exactly.
01:05:03.584 - 01:05:03.834, Speaker A: Right?
01:05:03.872 - 01:05:15.562, Speaker B: Like no one can take it away from you. You are completely independent, completely self sovereign. You don't need to trust anyone. You don't have dependencies on anyone else. And that's also true for DeFi. But Defi is much more. It's much more collaborative.
01:05:15.562 - 01:05:52.566, Speaker B: It's like when we come together, even though we have self sovereign money and I have my private keys, my private keys are mine, and no one can take it away from me. We can still create more via collaboration, right? Amin Soleimani has this quote that stuck with me where he goes bitcoin in times of war, but ethereum in times of peace, right? In peace times, we can collaborate and build, but if people are in a deflationary spiral or just like times of mistrust, that's where bitcoin as an asset, the narratives and political alignment behind bitcoin really, really shines. Bitcoin is the I don't need you asset, and Ether and Defi is the let's collaborate ecosystem.
01:05:52.758 - 01:06:54.210, Speaker A: I think that last part resonated with me probably the most of anything that was said and even this tweet, because I also do feel like ethereum is like a network that the developers researchers have said is designed to try to survive World War Three, right? It is designed to be a collaboration tool set and a money system. When all of the other money systems fail, when the nation state fails. Even so, it does have elements of an Ethereum kind of citadel that's built apart from the requirements of the nation state, does live outside of it. And yet what you said is also super true, which is like the theme of Ethereum is all about coordination. How can we pool capital together and do more together? Yes, there's lots of competition, but it's not as individualistic, which is interesting to me. So I guess I see both sides of it. I also think that bitcoin is, in a weird way, also a bet on technology, because it's certainly a bet on cryptography.
01:06:54.210 - 01:06:57.650, Speaker A: So maybe not entirely short civilization.
01:06:59.030 - 01:07:28.090, Speaker B: Bitcoin is a coordination system, but it's a coordination system, so you don't have to coordinate with anyone else. It coordinates for you. Ethereum is a coordination system that allows and propagates further coordination. And that's really the big difference is like the long tail of bitcoin after it coordinates for you, is that you are done coordinating because bitcoin did it for you. Ethereum is like, let me create platforms and software and applications that allow for further coordination. Right. The coordination extends out into the nth degree.
01:07:28.510 - 01:07:44.890, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a really interesting take, for sure. Here's another one. Justin Drake, again, making the roll up twice. Price affects security, he says. I think that's the thrust of the argument. Now he's got a flowchart. I would have died for a Flowchart like this in 2018, 2019.
01:07:44.890 - 01:07:55.442, Speaker A: We were making the argument that price of ETH is so fundamental to the economic security of the Ethereum network, and that was falling on deaf ears. But what is this flow chart showing us?
01:07:55.496 - 01:08:39.566, Speaker B: Yeah, it's showing us all the different ways that if ether price goes up, Ethereum benefits. Right. And so there's four main factors that he has. One of the part later, legitimacy by performance, as in if ether goes up and it continues to go up, there's some amount of legitimacy about that, which attracts builders, which attracts on chain activity, which attracts more fee burn and more staking rewards, which makes ether money more sound, which makes staking inflows even better, which increases the cost of attack, which increases Ethereum security. Then there's more economic bandwidth, same path. Then there's ETH stake appreciation, and also the EF treasury. Just go look at the chart.
01:08:39.566 - 01:08:52.360, Speaker B: I'm not going to try and explain all of it, but go look at the chart. And it's a very concise way, very developer focused way of illustrating the connection between ETH price go up and bullishness on humanity, which is Ethereum security.
01:08:53.130 - 01:09:29.010, Speaker A: The level two analysis here is, again, I strongly believe that the winning, the most economically secure money system, the core asset of that system, has to be a store of value reserve asset, because you get so much of this for free if your asset is priced. In the Justin Drake episode, we called it like the magic meme property, where it gets some of this reserve currency monetary premium for free. So we're starting to see that with ETH. We've definitely seen it with bitcoin. Let's do the Scott Lewis tweet. What's this saying?
01:09:29.080 - 01:09:56.998, Speaker B: Yeah, so Scott Lewis is illustrating the connection between the security of a consensus layer and how much you should pay for transactions, right? So he kind of makes up some numbers, but he goes, Ethereum main net, $50 for a transaction. Ethereum roll up $2 for a transaction. That's like something like arbitram or optimism. And then he goes, Ethereum side chain, $2 per. So 2.2 pennies for one transaction. If you're on a side chain.
01:09:56.998 - 01:10:49.402, Speaker B: And that's like Maddox, right? And he goes, different price points for different levels of security. And that's really what you're paying when you pay your transaction fees, you are paying for security. And it is a good rule of thumb to understand that when you are paying a transaction fee on Matic versus arbitram versus wherever, the amount of fee you are paying is functionally an extrapolation as to the security of how secure that transaction is. And so the real take here that he finished off with is that different price points for different levels of security. But he says complementary options will make all of Ethereum work better. And so he's alluding to this symbiosis between all of these things, offering different options for the markets. Like maybe a $2 transaction on roll up is actually too expensive for your super high throughput microtransaction app.
01:10:49.402 - 01:11:04.690, Speaker B: And so therefore, you need to go to a side chain. But more economic activity bestows more economic activity. Right? And so having optionality with security levels allows people to choose what they want and what works best for them, both as users and as defi apps.
01:11:05.030 - 01:11:29.202, Speaker A: Yeah, it's all great. And that's the thing. It's not roll ups versus side chains. It's not mainet versus roll ups. We're doing them all, and they're all going to not compete against one another, but they're all going to be synergistic. Right? I'm starting to think of Ethereum less as just like, one main chain and more of, like, this ecosystem of chain, like an entire economy.
01:11:29.266 - 01:11:30.754, Speaker B: Suzanne calls it a nexus.
01:11:30.882 - 01:11:57.522, Speaker A: Yes, he calls it an economic nexus, and that's exactly what it is. But when you say, what is Ethereum? Now, what is Ethereum has to extend to all of the ERC. Twenty s on crypto exchanges has to extend to arbitram and optimism. All of the roll ups that they create has to extend to all of the side chains. Maybe at some level it also extends into things like binance chain, though that is less economically linked. It still uses the EVM. So what is ethereum? All of these things.
01:11:57.522 - 01:12:07.042, Speaker A: It's like this Internet of chains guys for stealing another cosmos meme, but there you go. All right, what's this take from Suzu?
01:12:07.106 - 01:12:27.482, Speaker B: Yeah, Suzu talking about the nature of decoupling. He writes, those who doubt decoupling needs to read more history. 99.5% of coins from the previous era are worthless, and the 0.5% that are worth something are up 10,000 x. Since then, it turns out decoupling. It actually has an investopedia page.
01:12:27.482 - 01:12:34.378, Speaker B: That's news to me. And so what Suzu is saying is that decoupling, not a crypto term, I thought that was, like, a decoupling.
01:12:34.394 - 01:12:35.680, Speaker A: What does it mean to you?
01:12:36.450 - 01:12:55.614, Speaker B: So, like, ether and bitcoin have largely had similar price action throughout its history and to this day. But we are seeing some decoupling, and that's why we were paying attention to the ETH BTC ratio. Right? Like, ETH BTC hovered between, like, 00:18 for years, and now we're up to 72. Right. That's a decoupling.
01:12:55.662 - 01:13:01.154, Speaker A: It's when one asset takes off and the other either stays stagnant or, like, dies, goes uncorrelated.
01:13:01.202 - 01:13:01.414, Speaker B: Right.
01:13:01.452 - 01:13:03.942, Speaker A: Uncorrelated assets from a price perspective. Right.
01:13:04.076 - 01:13:09.734, Speaker B: Suzu is saying that the fundamentals is why things decouple, and perhaps that's what's happening.
01:13:09.852 - 01:13:42.750, Speaker A: I think that's such a good take. And it's something to remember, because this doesn't happen overnight. It doesn't even happen in the months timeline. This happens over years. It almost happens every kind of narrative cycle. But when we see things that have survived, like bitcoin, Satoshi's vision, and how is that still around? Or even, like, litecoin to some extent, how is that still around? Right. I think what it is is it's survivorship bias, because we forget the thousands of other cryptocurrencies.
01:13:42.830 - 01:13:45.554, Speaker B: Peer coin, that feather coin. Exactly.
01:13:45.672 - 01:13:48.158, Speaker A: All of these colored coin. Like, all of these things died.
01:13:48.254 - 01:13:49.886, Speaker B: Gold, bitcoin, diamond.
01:13:49.998 - 01:14:09.254, Speaker A: We don't even remember them, but they were a thing. They had their moment, right? But they died. They were part of that 99.5% of coins that did not survive the previous era. Do you remember dragon chain, dragon. I put out this tweet last week, 2017. What's the most embarrassing thing you invested in? Right? I got all these answers.
01:14:09.254 - 01:14:14.220, Speaker A: R chain, dragon chain, dragon chain. There's this theme of, like, oh, my gosh, really?
01:14:14.990 - 01:14:17.038, Speaker B: Somebody says Disney was about it, and.
01:14:17.044 - 01:14:30.846, Speaker A: I was like, oh, I'm in Dragon chain gang. Yeah. So anyway, these are all the coins that died last cycle. Fundamentals do matter. They do matter. This is what Suzu is saying. So make sure you're tracking fundamentals, not just the trade.
01:14:30.846 - 01:14:35.042, Speaker A: Okay, David, you are getting ready to board a flight. What are you excited about, man?
01:14:35.096 - 01:14:41.894, Speaker B: Going to Miami for the world's largest Ethereum meetup event ever thrown by Bitcoin conference 20.
01:14:41.932 - 01:14:42.914, Speaker A: Are you wearing that shirt?
01:14:42.962 - 01:14:52.874, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Shalom. This is the shirt I got when I did my eth triple point asset talk in Tel Aviv. Unrelated, but I got my bap shirt in the bag, so the bap shirt is coming out.
01:14:52.992 - 01:14:53.562, Speaker A: Oh, man.
01:14:53.616 - 01:15:22.846, Speaker B: Yeah. And so it's really funny. I think I got the right numbers from CK, who works at BTC media, which is throwing the bitcoin 21 2021 conference. He said that there are 8000 people attending the conference and 30,000 people going to Miami. If you extrapolate and kind of think that maybe there's more ethereums going to Miami who aren't actually going to the conference, they're just going to the Miami as a shelling point because everyone else is going to Miami.
01:15:22.878 - 01:15:24.660, Speaker A: You're going to go to the conference though, right?
01:15:25.530 - 01:15:26.870, Speaker B: If it's convenient.
01:15:29.130 - 01:15:30.758, Speaker A: What are you going to be doing the whole time?
01:15:30.844 - 01:15:56.906, Speaker B: Well, hanging out with my friends. Everyone's going to Miami, so I'm going there too. That's what happened here. So there is like the D yacht party, which is thrown by a bunch of defi teams, like slingshot upshot. Like a bunch of other teams have a yacht party. So I'm going to that. Going to the diplo concert with a bunch of going to meet Koopa for the first time, going to meet Lucas for the first time, and Luke.
01:15:56.906 - 01:16:04.880, Speaker B: And so there's actually going to be three bankless LLC employees at Miami. And Ryan, we won't see you there.
01:16:05.830 - 01:16:26.962, Speaker A: Do not. I do not like to travel as like, the team calls me the bankless boomer. It's like I'm just, you know, happy at like, you guys have, um, screen share me in or something. Let me know how it. I'm okay. So I had heard that you cannot actually talk about other chains while you're attending the conference.
01:16:27.026 - 01:16:27.650, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:16:27.820 - 01:16:31.942, Speaker A: Is that true? Can you wear apparel from other chains?
01:16:32.006 - 01:16:57.278, Speaker B: I'll let you know. So, yeah. BTC media put out this email that said, please, if you are attending the conference, please keep your conversations on bitcoin themed conversations because this is a bitcoin only conference. And so it's one thing to make a bitcoin only conference. That's great. Requesting the attendees to keep their conversations focused to bitcoin. A little bit controversial.
01:16:57.278 - 01:16:58.690, Speaker B: A little bit controversial.
01:16:59.430 - 01:17:02.014, Speaker A: Well, we'll see what happens to you, David, when you wear that shirt.
01:17:02.062 - 01:17:13.590, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's the other experiment. So bitcoiners, while they're kind of nasty on Twitter, they're a very loving group of people, but it's kind of amongst themselves. Right. Bitcoiners love other bitcoiners.
01:17:14.890 - 01:17:17.906, Speaker A: You are a bitcoiner, though, aren't you sure you're not a bitcoin?
01:17:17.938 - 01:17:42.958, Speaker B: It depends on who you ask. Right. And I've definitely worn my Ethereum shirt inside of a bunch of. Inside of a bitcoiner event where there was like, literally 50 bitcoiners around and I was the one Ethereum people, and people knew who I was. Like, bankless was pretty big at that time, but that was when the Eth bitcoin ratio was like at zero two. Now it's at zero seven. And so I'm going to test the waters to see are they all that loving as they say that they are.
01:17:42.958 - 01:17:44.030, Speaker B: We'll find out.
01:17:44.180 - 01:17:54.206, Speaker A: Hey, you know what Van Spencer said on the podcast, guys? Listen to that one Monday. It's great. The flipping of ETh over bitcoin is actually good for bitcoin.
01:17:54.238 - 01:17:56.306, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm going to bring that argument. I'll let you know how that goes.
01:17:56.328 - 01:17:57.720, Speaker A: Oh, really? You're going to try that?
01:17:58.330 - 01:17:59.720, Speaker B: I tweeted it out.
01:18:00.170 - 01:18:01.654, Speaker A: Let me know how it goes. Yeah.
01:18:01.692 - 01:18:04.054, Speaker B: Social experiment left and right. Yeah.
01:18:04.172 - 01:18:04.790, Speaker A: Very fun.
01:18:04.860 - 01:18:06.520, Speaker B: All right, Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:18:07.130 - 01:18:31.374, Speaker A: I'm excited about arbitrary man. I'm excited about roll ups in general. Like, layer two is finally here. I was worried that when we had arbitram on in Tuesday that they were going to say something like, yeah, we released to mainnet, but it's going to be another six months before the Defi apps are up. And there's some complexity here. We've just been disappointed so many times with layer two and with roll ups, but no longer. No longer.
01:18:31.374 - 01:18:55.960, Speaker A: It's like, really here. And I'm excited about that. The second thing I'm excited about, I sort of picked up in that conversation, too, is arbitram is launching with just one chain right now, but they could launch with a dozen chains. Like, they could launch with 30 chains, 40 chains. You could have a DFI chain, an NFT chain. You could have so many chains. As many chains as you want and all at the same time.
01:18:55.960 - 01:19:33.454, Speaker A: We talked about this with the Polygon SDK. They can produce a whole bunch of different versions of side chains. Right? So now we have all of this additional real estate. We have all of this block space, and we talked about layer two hitting crypto like a tidal wave. This is going to be a wave of new apps that weren't previously possible on main chain. That's going to be part of the tidal wave and a wave of new users. We're going to start talking about monthly active users a lot more, rather than total locked value, and that's going to be exciting.
01:19:33.454 - 01:19:48.694, Speaker A: So more people onboarded through layer two. This is really important for crypto, and I couldn't be more excited. We'll have to have optimism on too. I think they're launching in July, but I'm just really excited about layer two. Summer, baby. Still excited about it.
01:19:48.732 - 01:20:27.234, Speaker B: And this is what Vitala called expressivity, escape velocity. Right? Like, just make the base chain a little bit more expressive, and all of a sudden you have an infinite number of options that you can build on top of it. And that's what we are hopefully on the cusp of a cambrian explosion of available trustless block space and new possible economic activities. Like I said earlier, all of a sudden, microtransactions are back on the table. Microtransactions used to be a thing, realty. When I used to work at realty, we used to send daily rent out every single day at expensive base layer Ethereum. Right back when gas was one gwe that got immediately pushed out.
01:20:27.234 - 01:20:42.454, Speaker B: But now we can kind of return to some of those crazy use cases that we hypothesize about but never actually got to. Ryan, earlier in the show, I talked about tokens that I think are particularly well suited towards a layer two. A layer two edition.
01:20:42.582 - 01:20:43.242, Speaker A: What you got?
01:20:43.296 - 01:21:18.602, Speaker B: I talked about sushiswap, right? A team that integrates really fast and aggressively and moves really quickly. Was also born in DFI summer itself, and so is a defi summer like asset. Born and bred in DFI summer. The other thing that I have my eye on is Ave, again, moves really fast, integrates really quickly, has already integrated on polygon, so already knows what's up with at layer two. And so I've got my sights on Ave, YfI. If there is a bunch of yield to be had on Ethereum, urine is supposed to be able to capture it. Again, another DFI summer token.
01:21:18.602 - 01:21:28.434, Speaker B: So sushi, Ave and YfI, that's kind of where I have my eyes on. As for tokens that are going to be particularly well suited to capture a DFI summer layer two edition.
01:21:28.562 - 01:21:41.082, Speaker A: So the theme here is blue chips. Going to layer two, right. Blue chip D. Five projects with great teams, good layer two strategies. Right. I'm also curious to see what new things we will see that are actually born in layer two.
01:21:41.136 - 01:21:41.498, Speaker B: Right?
01:21:41.584 - 01:21:51.354, Speaker A: Like new creations, new protocols will be born, not on the main chain, but inside of these layer twos. That kind of brings me to the meme of the week. David talking about birth.
01:21:51.402 - 01:21:51.838, Speaker B: Let's do it.
01:21:51.844 - 01:21:53.262, Speaker A: You want to get to the meme of the week. Are we ready?
01:21:53.316 - 01:21:54.834, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we're ready for the meme of the week.
01:21:54.952 - 01:22:00.114, Speaker A: All right, I'm sharing screen. Here's the meme of the week by our friend Mariano Conti. What are we looking at?
01:22:00.312 - 01:22:22.854, Speaker B: Four panel comic. First is a CGI render of a pregnant lady with a baby inside of her, and the baby is crossing its finger saying, God, please ethereum. Please ethereum. Please ethereum. And then next picture is a baby, looks like it just got born. And the baby says, hello, sir, where am I? And then the next panel is binance smart chain. And then the fourth panel is the baby.
01:22:22.854 - 01:22:31.500, Speaker B: Just like, just the look of just like death. Just like. Oh no. Oh no. I'm born in binance smart chain. Oh no.
01:22:32.350 - 01:22:55.854, Speaker A: Well, look, a lot of these new applications, new protocols, probably the next gen ones will actually be born into layer twos. So hopefully they get a good layer two, not a bad one. That's the mean of the week, folks. David, enjoy Miami. I will, I will. Shilling bankless right, bankless listeners, David's going to be in Miami. We're still going to do the recordings.
01:22:55.854 - 01:23:10.726, Speaker A: A regular schedule next week, maybe some different scenery. Thanks for hanging with us. This has been another roll up. I got to end with the disclaimers. As usual, bitcoin and Eth are risky. So is Defi. You could lose what you put in, but we are headed west.
01:23:10.726 - 01:23:17.020, Speaker A: This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
