00:00:00.170 - 00:00:20.698, Speaker A: DeFi is the most dangerous part of the crypto world. This is where the regulation is effectively absent. And no surprise, it's where the scammers and the cheats and the swindlers mix among part time investors and first time crypto traders. Shoot. In Defi, someone can't even tell if they're dealing with a terrorist.
00:00:20.794 - 00:00:35.606, Speaker B: Wow. What do you think of that, David? In Defi, someone can't even tell if you're a terrorist. Going, she said straight to the terrorist thing. It takes her no time at all. It's like, oh, yeah, terrorism. The worst part of crypto, the shadiest parts of crypto, that's what she called it. Spoken like somebody that's never used it.
00:00:35.606 - 00:00:50.810, Speaker B: Elizabeth, I don't understand. So Elizabeth Warren is somebody who speaks, has spoken up against the banks, and then when faced with crypto, when faced with DeFi, the transparent, open financial system that actually provides a way out. No, that's shady. That's for scammers. Yeah. And terrorists.
