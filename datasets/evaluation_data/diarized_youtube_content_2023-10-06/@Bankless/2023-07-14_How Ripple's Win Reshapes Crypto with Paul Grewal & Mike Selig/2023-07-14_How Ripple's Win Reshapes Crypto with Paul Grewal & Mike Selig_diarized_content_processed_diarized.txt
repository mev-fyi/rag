00:00:16.770 - 00:00:57.954, Speaker A: We're going into the details with some crypto legal minds and experts. The news is this the sales of XRP, the asset, do not constitute an offer of investment contracts. This is the words of a judge. Effectively, what this means is a US. Court has ruled that XRP is not a security. The question, of course, is, is if XRP is not a security, how can all of the other tokens that the SEC alleges are securities, be securities, including Matic, including Solana, including Cardano, including ETH? We're going to get into the details of that ruling today on this news. Of course, some of the crypto market has been up.
00:00:57.954 - 00:01:27.034, Speaker A: XRP has been up. The coinbase token has been up as well. I shouldn't say token, I should say stock. That one's a stock. And I promised yesterday in the rollup that we would walk through the details with some legal minds, some folks where we can get into a deeper analysis than I can give you. So here we are, joined today with Paul Graywell and Mike Selig. They are both experts in this field and I think we'll provide some insight into the implications of this and the decision itself.
00:01:27.034 - 00:01:39.086, Speaker A: So guys, we're going to get right to the episode. But before we do, I want to thank the sponsors that made this possible, including our number one recommended crypto exchange, Kraken. Go create an Account kraken Pro has.

00:02:14.752 - 00:03:12.342, Speaker B: Mantle, formerly known as Bitdao, is the first Dowled web3 ecosystem, all built on top of Mantle's first core product, the Mantle Network, a brand new high performance ethereum L2. Built using the Op stack but uses Eigen layer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer one. Not only does this reduce Mantle network's gas fees by 80%, but it also reduces gas fee volatility, providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications. The Mantle Treasury is one of the biggest Dow owned Treasuries, which is seeding an ecosystem of projects from all around the web3 space for Mantle. Mantle already has subcommunities from around web3 onboarded, like Game Seven for web3 gaming and buybit for TVL and Liquidity and onram. So if you want to build on the Mantle Network, mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone based funding to promising projects that help expand secure and decentralize mantle.

00:04:11.010 - 00:04:32.470, Speaker A: XRP is not a security that seemed to be the ruling of a US court just yesterday. It happened. We want to get some legal minds in on this conversation. We've got two of the best in our industry. Mike Selig joins us. He is a counsel for digital asset department at Wilkie, Far and Gallagher, which is a law firm based in New York City. Mike's been on bankless before.
00:04:32.470 - 00:04:39.740, Speaker A: Last time we talked, I think we were talking about the SEC. It's the year of the SEC, I think, Mike, so it's great to have you back.
00:04:40.110 - 00:04:41.242, Speaker C: Good to be here.
00:04:41.376 - 00:04:59.600, Speaker A: We also have Paul Greywell, who's no stranger to bankless. He's the chief legal officer at Coinbase and I think Paul was last on the show to discuss the Wells notice that Coinbase received from the SEC. And now this time we get to talk about maybe happier news, which is this recent ruling. Paul, it's great to have you back.
00:05:00.130 - 00:05:02.426, Speaker D: It's great to be back. Thanks, Brian.
00:05:02.618 - 00:05:29.174, Speaker A: All right, I want to go through this in two parts. First, let's talk about the decision and your legal brains will be able to pick this apart far better than mine. So I want to spend some detail there and then once we do that, once we establish that, we can talk about the implications. But before we do, I want to just spend a moment to maybe celebrate what just happened. I for 01:00 a.m. Very excited and I saw your tweet here, Paul? Most days. I love being a lawyer.
00:05:29.174 - 00:05:46.510, Speaker A: Today is one of them. You were referring, of course, to yesterday, the date you got this news. I think all of crypto was really celebrating in a celebratory mindset, and I want to ask why. Why was yesterday an important day for you, Paul?
00:05:47.170 - 00:07:08.940, Speaker D: Well, it was important because Judge Torres and her decision made several rulings that we think are transformational, not just for Coinbase and our particular issues with the SEC, but for the industry as a whole. But I actually think that the substance of the ruling was only part of the you know, for a long time, a lot of us in crypto have frankly been getting the crap kicked out of us, seemingly on a regular basis. Part of that was from the SEC, and we're going to talk a lot more about that in a minute. But part of it was just the fact that our industry saw just one blow up after another and one scandal after another. That really part a lot of innocent, hardworking, creative, good people with negativity and worth in ways that simply wasn't fair. So I think for many of us, if I can speak on behalf of more than just myself for a minute, the ruling, I think, was a sense for the first time in a long time that we were being heard that someone smart and hardworking and fair and frankly, with no skin in the game was looking at these issues so important to so many of us and saying, are you serious, SEC? Is this really the basis upon which you want to regulate such an important industry in the United States? I think that was as much of it as anything else.
00:07:10.110 - 00:07:43.922, Speaker A: I will definitely agree with you. I felt like it's been a theme of 2023. Regulatory overreach has felt like a theme, this regulation by enforcement, and it felt good to have some checks and balances at play. And that's, after all, is the idea of the court system. That's where they come into play as a check and balance against the legislative and executive branch. I think we saw that today. Mike, what were your thoughts? First of all, were you surprised at this ruling in general? It was not on my radar at all.
00:07:43.922 - 00:07:51.320, Speaker A: I didn't even know that this ruling was imminent. Were you surprised at the timing of it and the result?
00:07:52.170 - 00:08:39.570, Speaker C: So we were all waiting for this ruling to drop and we had no idea when, but we expected it any day. And it came when it came. But I think we've built up over all of these years this notion that the SEC is interpreting the Howie test broader and broader with every case, and they've brought many enforcement actions over the years. Many of these have settled, and there have been a handful of cases where the SEC has been tasked with going to court. The Wahi case, the Coinbase case, now ripple Telegram Kick Library, a number of these cases. And the SEC has kind of gotten its way in some of these. We've not had the monumental ruling where we had a court say that there is no security involved whatsoever.
00:08:39.570 - 00:09:19.278, Speaker C: But we've kind of gotten these breadcrumbs in every case where the courts started to distinguish this idea that there's an investment contract and this crypto asset that kind of sits apart from that, and it may be sold in ways that implicate the securities laws, but it's not necessarily a security in every case. It's not the security itself. And so this was really a surprising win, really, for the Ripple team and for the industry more broadly. I don't think any of us were necessarily expecting that the court would go so far as to say, look, we're separating the crypto asset from the investment contract very clearly here. And there are certain instances when you can sell the crypto asset and it's not going to implicate the securities laws.
00:09:19.454 - 00:09:46.618, Speaker A: So let's get to the what's happened? That was our celebratory round. And Mike, you started talking about this. I want to bring Paul in on this too. This is a tweet from Bill Hughes that I think sums it up. But I'm wondering if you could paint in the shades of detail here. Crypto lawyer Bill Hughes says the SEC versus Ripple, in brief, Ripple putting XRP on exchanges for trading and funding their operation. With those sales, the court found that this is not an investment contract and therefore not a security.
00:09:46.618 - 00:10:21.906, Speaker A: XRP on exchange is not a security. Ripple paying people in XRP is not an investment contract and therefore not a security. So when you pay an XRP, it's not a security. XRP itself is not a security in and of itself, even when offered through a securities transaction. All right, that, I think, are the monumental pieces of this ruling. The last part, though, is Ripple selling XRP directly pursuant to contracts was an investment contract and thus a security. Ripple had fair notice that doing this without registration was illegal.
00:10:21.906 - 00:10:57.826, Speaker A: So I think the idea here is that at some point when Ripple was selling XRP to investors, these maybe institutions, it was a security. And then XRP became not a security at some other point in the process. This piece of kind of the court ruling seems somewhat vague to me, but we've got sort of the start case where XRP starts as a security and we've got the end piece where now it's not security, according to the court ruling. Paul, I'm wondering if you could kind of make sense of this for us. So what actually happened here?
00:10:58.008 - 00:11:50.050, Speaker D: Yeah, Ryan, well, just to be very clear, what actually happened here as a result of this ruling? XRP, the token the asset, was never a security. It was never a security when it was part of a broader investment contract and security transaction. That's what was going on with the institutional investors. It was never a security when it was part of trading on exchanges. And in fact, the trading on exchanges was deemed not to be a security transaction as well. It wasn't a security when it was distributed to employees, and on and on the court went. So I think part of the FUD here, part of the uncertainty, doubt, and fear that the SEC has sown is that through its theory, it has suggested that assets themselves can be securities independent of the context in which they are transacted.
00:11:50.050 - 00:12:10.890, Speaker D: Blows that entire thinking out of the water. And she does it in a very thoughtful, methodical way. That's why I think today so many people are celebrating that we finally have recognition that whatever else may be going on with assets from time to time, these assets themselves are not securities.
00:12:11.310 - 00:12:46.920, Speaker A: Okay, all right, so I think I got that part wrong. And your precision of language, that's why you guys are lawyers and I'm not. I'm just a lowly podcaster. Your precision of language really helped me there, Paul. So you're saying XRP was never a security, but there was this investment contract for XRP, and that investment contract a separate kind of thing, a separate asset, I suppose, or separate agreement. The judge ruled that that investment contract was a security, but XRP was never a security throughout this entire process. Is that correct?
00:12:47.530 - 00:13:25.438, Speaker D: 100% correct. And the way we know this, the reason we know this is Judge Torres understood the law. The law has been clear for a very long time. You got to look at these things transaction by transaction. That's one of the reasons why Judge Torres distinguished the transactions involving institutions on the one hand, and the transactions that took place on the exchanges on the other. And that distinction is everything. And the SEC's refusal for years now to acknowledge that distinction is what created so much uncertainty for a lot of us.
00:13:25.438 - 00:13:37.400, Speaker D: Judge Torres said, enough. Judge Torres said, Let me lay this all out so that everybody can understand. And she squarely ruled in favor of exchange trading in the XRP case not being a security.
00:13:38.570 - 00:13:54.970, Speaker A: Okay, now I see. So thank you for that clarity. So can we be clear on what XRP, the asset, actually is? So if it's not a security, did Judge Torres designate what it actually is as an asset?
00:13:55.550 - 00:14:36.694, Speaker D: He didn't. The burden was on the SEC as the plaintiff in the case to prove what it was alleging in its complaint, which was that the XRP asset itself was a security. And that's what the court considered deliberated on and ultimately rejected. She didn't go so far. And I think this is a reflection of the care with which she wrote her opinion as to say what the asset might be in terms of other regulatory frameworks, for example, a commodity, a virtual currency, or something else altogether. The only thing that mattered in order to evaluate the SEC's claims was, is this a security or isn't it? And she plainly said it's not.
00:14:36.812 - 00:14:42.140, Speaker A: And why? What were her reasons? What were her arguments for XRP not being a security?
00:14:42.830 - 00:15:37.862, Speaker D: Because the law has been very clear that what is at issue when the SEC charges violations of the securities laws is whether the transactions themselves constitute securities transactions that triggered the authority and jurisdiction of the SEC. And so because you can have investment contracts or any other type of security transaction that involves all sorts of things that might be securities on the one hand, Apple stock or debt instruments, those sorts of things. Or on the other, pure commodities. You can have securities transactions that involve transactions such as orange groves or pork bellies or other things that are planning on securities in a certain way. Ryan the underlying asset is kind of irrelevant to the analysis. What matters are the transactions. And that's why we found Judge Torres so laser like, focused on that particular element.
00:15:38.006 - 00:16:18.666, Speaker A: And this seems to we'll talk about the implications, but this seems definitely to fly in the face of something that the SEC has been talking about, both in talking points and then in these individual court arguments and basic idea that tokens, all tokens, are securities. It seems to be this very, I guess, strong position that everything that is not bitcoin is a security or is very possibly a security. So this flies into the face of their argument. Mike, I'm wondering what you might add to this. And in your Tweet thread, you said something similar. You made this distinction between the asset of XRP itself and investment contract. You called this a massive win by the ripple team against the SEC.
00:16:18.666 - 00:16:39.280, Speaker A: Judge Torres clearly affirms the view that the same crypto asset may be sold as an investment contract and therefore security and as a standalone good. So both the investment contract is the security, not the crypto asset. What else would you add to Paul's explanation of what just happened to, your.
00:16:41.090 - 00:17:48.690, Speaker C: Know, it's important to have this distinction because you have all sorts of commodity assets gold, silver, sugar that are sold every day in various types of transactions. The court's decision here really firmly places XRP with these other types of commodities and goods, and of course, they may be sold under circumstances where certain promises and commitments are made by the seller. In the original 1946 Howie opinion, you had a land management contract coupled with the orange groves. And if the orange groves are later resold, why should that be subject to the securities laws? And so I think we've seen Matt Levine kind of saying, well, this isn't how stock is sold. And if you buy stock in a secondary market, it's still stock, but that's a different type of security. And so, really, the investment contract analysis will require the SEC in every instance to do their homework and prove that the commodity was sold in a manner of sale that implicates the securities laws. And of course, certain crypto assets might be stock, they might be notes, they might fit within other prongs of the security definition.
00:17:48.690 - 00:18:21.230, Speaker C: But the Howie test is really this prophylactic catch all that says if it's none of those other things, then we're going to make you prove your work to show that the facts and circumstances dictate protection of the securities laws. And that's no joke. I mean, it's a serious thing for these assets to be within the scope of the securities laws. There's disclosure requirements and all other sorts of compliance obligations around registration and trading in secondary markets. And so it shouldn't be taken lightly that the assets are just grouped within the securities laws because they have some investment characteristics.
00:18:22.070 - 00:18:39.400, Speaker A: So does this mean effectively that the SEC would have to prove for every single asset that it is subject to the Howey test and the ruling just established that that is a fairly high bar to pass?
00:18:39.930 - 00:19:28.514, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, there was just a Supreme Court opinion regarding slack where they're dealing with traceability of securities and some were sold as unregistered and some were subject to a registration statement. And the Supreme Court said you can't mix the two and say they're equivalent. If there's fraud in the registration statement, it pertains to the you have to prove that those securities you acquired were subject to that registration statement. It's the same kind of analysis the SEC is going to have to do here. They're going to have to prove that in every instance the way that was sold was in an investment contract. And that's a really heavy burden for the SEC and it's on exchanges where there's blind trading. It's very difficult to prove that people are kind of undertaking to invest in some enterprise and they understand all of these undertakings and promises when they're just buying something that they think is more of a commodity.
00:19:28.514 - 00:19:56.426, Speaker C: They might be using it to pay gas, they might be using it for all sorts of reasons within the ecosystem. Who knows why they're buying it? But the SEC has to prove in every case that that reasonable purchase is based on an expectation of profits from the issuer or from some identifiable other and that's a difficult burden. So I think this order is very helpful for secondary sale cases as well as some of these other cases.
00:19:56.618 - 00:20:43.920, Speaker A: We'll get more into the implications, I think, in a minute, because I think the implications are absolutely huge, are absolutely massive for crypto in various ways. I want to ask, though, Paul, for those not familiar listening, who are not familiar with kind of how the court system works, how binding is this sort of thing? Is there the opportunity for the SEC to appeal this? Does this kind of cement this type of a decision in precedent for those that aren't familiar with how the court system case law kind of works, can you give us some details on that. Is this, like the end of Story XRP as a security or is not a security can never be called into question again, or there are some ways for the SEC to strike back here.
00:20:44.290 - 00:21:37.786, Speaker D: Well, the empire can strike back, and it's important that we be very clear about this, but this is nevertheless a critical, critical decision. Ryan, in an earlier life, I served as a judge in the United States District Court, so the finality and certainty of a trial judge's decision is something that is kind of near and dear to my heart. Look, Judge Torres in this case issued a ruling on what's called a motion for summary judgment that each party brought. And that's basically a claim by each side that, hey, we don't even need to have a trial on these various issues as a matter of law. You can just decide this because we agree on all the facts that matter. Facts are why you usually have a trial, and if you don't have facts in dispute, you don't need a trial. When the judge ruled, for example, that the institutional transactions were securities transactions, she ruled obviously in favor of the SEC on that and against the ripple defendants.
00:21:37.786 - 00:22:38.274, Speaker D: Her rulings in favor of the ripple defendants on all the other questions were also final decisions that take those issues out of the case for now and park them until the overall or complete case is resolved. What's critical here is that there was a third category of topics, one main topic in particular that the judge considered, which was the aiding and abetting liability of certain individual defendants for the securities transactions that she found earlier in the opinion dealing with institutions there. She said, I can't decide that question purely as a matter of law because you all disagree on what the basic facts are. So I've got to set that for trial. Why does all this matter? Well, before any party can take an appeal of any part of the judgment that they don't like, there has to be a final judgment. And a final judgment can only enter once everything's been resolved. So here there's got to be a trial first in order to wrap up the outstanding issues in the case.
00:22:38.274 - 00:23:51.798, Speaker D: And only then can the SEC on the one hand or the ripple defendants on the other file an appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and argue that there was some error down below. Now, there are ways in which one party or another can request permission to take up a piecemeal appeal to focus on just a part of the case before having to wait until it's all wrapped up. But that bar is super high, very rare, particularly in the Second Circuit. So the SEC could try, for example, pursue an interlocutory appeal of its loss, its massive loss on the sales on exchanges piece of the opinion. But that is not very likely to be accepted. So eventually they will have their chance, as will the Ripple defendants. And at that point in time, the Court of Appeals, which generally sits in panels of three judges, will review this decision and ask themselves, was there legal error here? Not do we just simply disagree with what the judge did, but did she commit certain errors that warrant a reversal? That's a high bar, particularly when you have a decision at the trial court level that's so thorough, so thoughtful as Judge Torres's decision.
00:23:51.798 - 00:24:20.078, Speaker D: The final stop on the train, of course, is the Supreme Court. In theory, the party or any party that loses at the Court of Appeals could go up to the Supreme Court or try to in order to get that court to issue a decision. And of course, if the Supreme Court rules, that's the end. There's no other place to go in our system. But the Supreme Court only takes a handful of cases. The bar to get to the Supreme Court is super high. They have the discretion to say no for whatever reason they wish.
00:24:20.078 - 00:24:37.894, Speaker D: And that's why only a tiny percentage of cases make it up there. And that's why if there's going to be an appeal here, it's going to, for all intents and purposes, be an appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. And that's going to be, absent some unusual situation, the last dance in the Ripple case.
00:24:38.012 - 00:24:40.970, Speaker A: And how long will that take, Paul, if it occurs?
00:24:41.470 - 00:25:14.674, Speaker D: Well, it's going to take many months, I predict, for the trial proceedings to wrap up, because Judge Torres is a busy judge. She's got hundreds of other cases she has to manage at the same time. And so just scheduling the trial is going to be problematic. That could take six months, that could take a year. Now, she might decide to fast track this for other reasons. But my point is, you can't bank on the trial court being done with this case for a while, then you go to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Those appeals can take as much as a year, 18 months, perhaps even two years.
00:25:14.674 - 00:25:35.020, Speaker D: And then if one or more party wants to pursue the Supreme Court option, there you go, you got another 612 18 months on top of this. So we're looking at the possibility here of years before there's a final resolution. But, Ryan, I just want to underscore one other point about the delay in the appellate process. In the meantime, the SEC is stuck with this.
00:25:37.950 - 00:25:49.294, Speaker A: Yeah, this is where we get into implications here. Right. Because there are many. Like, I don't even recall how long the Ripple versus SEC case has been ongoing. It's a matter of years, isn't mean.
00:25:49.332 - 00:26:00.110, Speaker D: This has been it has been a matter of years. And I should be very clear about one point, which is you also asked, quite reasonably, what does this mean for these other tokens in these other cases?
00:26:00.190 - 00:26:00.820, Speaker A: Yes.
00:26:01.830 - 00:26:39.978, Speaker D: So this one trial judge in this one court doesn't have the power to bind any other judge. So it's not as if in a different case like ours, our judge wouldn't have the freedom to make her own determinations on these same questions. But here's the thing. Judge Torres's decision is highly persuasive. It has persuasive authority, while the second or third or 10th judge doesn't have to follow her decision automatically. You've got a thoughtful, what, 30, some page analysis of key issues. You've got a judge who has a great reputation as a thoughtful, careful, deliberate jurist.
00:26:39.978 - 00:26:57.358, Speaker D: And so even if the other courts, for example, in our case or in the case against Finance or Bittrex or whatever aren't strictly speaking, required to follow her analysis, you can bet they're going to be studying it very carefully. And given the respect that she commands among her peers, it's going to carry a lot of weight.
00:26:57.454 - 00:27:34.610, Speaker A: And that's the way our system works, right? Once this is established as some sort of precedent in kind of case law, then it gets kind of reflected in court cases down the road because there are a lot of tokens that are in this state of limbo, as XRP was in, that for some reason thinks that they are a security and there's no clear determination. But this waiting, this precedent, will, I guess, cement the evidence and cement the decision that none of these tokens are securities.
00:27:35.270 - 00:28:23.546, Speaker D: I think it's going to have a massive impact on that. About another way to think about this, Ryan, is do a find and replace in Judge Taurus's decision, particularly the portion dealing with trading on exchanges, and look for all the references to XRP and just swap out the letters XRP and swap in Matic solana cardano. I mean, you could pick any number of assets, including those that are at issue in our cases. The logic holds there's nothing different about the tokens that would change any of Judge Corris's analysis in that portion of the opinion. That's why this thing is such a blockbuster. Obviously, for the XRP parties, it's critical. But this is about much more than just people who happen to be trading in XRP.

00:31:03.430 - 00:31:40.426, Speaker A: Bankless Nation we are back with crypto lawyers Paul and Mike talking through the implications of the case that was just ruled on. XRP is not a security. This is the case of Ripple versus the SEC. And Paul, when we left off, we were just talking about some of the implications of this downstream, and I want to touch on a few of those with both of you. One is existing token teams exchanges, future teams that might want to issue tokens, actual token users. Each of these are stakeholders inside of the crypto ecosystem. Maybe just finish off this thought on existing token teams.
00:31:40.426 - 00:32:15.130, Speaker A: So I know that in some of the cases that have been put forward by the SEC, they have alleged that tokens like Solana, tokens from Filecoin, tokens like Matic, tokens like Atom, tokens like cardano are securities as well. How can that possibly stand up now that XRP is ruled not a security? Does that argument from the SEC just utterly evaporate? Or is it still possible they can make a claim that the facts and circumstances in these types of token projects are different? What do you think, Paul?
00:32:15.710 - 00:32:44.070, Speaker D: Well, I think as to the tokens themselves, there's no difference. The logic holds. Judge Porris was clear in distinguishing tokens on the one hand from transactions involving the tokens on the other. So to be clear, could there be transactions involving those assets that you listed or others that might be deemed securities in the same way as the institutional transactions in the XRP case were deemed securities transactions? Yeah, for sure.
00:32:44.140 - 00:32:48.262, Speaker A: If there's an investment contract, that kind of wraps correct.
00:32:48.316 - 00:33:49.334, Speaker D: And so it's going to be important for new projects or existing projects to be mindful that just because you're dealing or peddling in orange groves doesn't mean you still can't be on the hook for a securities law violation. Right. That's Howie, and that's XRP, at least as to the first class. But separate apart from that on the exchanges themselves, I don't think there is any credible way for anyone to argue that these other tokens are securities when XRP is not in that scenario. Ryan there was one other part of Judge Torrey's ruling that relates to this that's also super important, and some people, I think, in reading the opinion, perhaps too quickly, have confused things on this point. The judge included a footnote that said that she was not issuing a blanket ruling on all secondary trading on exchanges. And some people have said, well, that means that the issue wasn't addressed, and therefore none of the rest of us should take any comfort from anything in this opinion.
00:33:49.334 - 00:34:36.514, Speaker D: But in my mind, I actually think that was an act of judicial humility on her part, because she was recognizing that, in theory, you could imagine a situation where some seller on one side of an exchange transaction was making specific commitments or representations to some buyer on the other side of that transaction. And as a result, the buyer really was expecting profits based upon the reasonable efforts of the seller. I'm not sure what that situation might look like, but it's theoretically possible. And so the judge wanted to make clear that she was not addressing that scenario because that scenario was not before her. What was before her was what we all do day in and day out. We interact with exchanges. We buy and sell assets.
00:34:36.514 - 00:34:47.690, Speaker D: And in that scenario, she could not have been clearer. The assets themselves, they're not securities, and the transactions on those exchanges or involving those exchanges are not securities transactions.
00:34:48.590 - 00:35:36.920, Speaker C: Yeah, and I think you might have the situation like in Gary Plastic which know a seminal securities law case that the SEC references all the time, where you have an asset, a credit, a CD that is not a security by definition and it's traded in a certain way, offered in a certain way on a platform by Morgan Stanley. And so that made it into a security because there were these guarantees on their own platform that they would buy it back and offer liquidity in that product. And so you could imagine if Ripple or somebody else had their own exchange selling their own token, that might be a security under those circumstances, but maybe you take it off and sell it on another exchange. And it's not. It's really the investment contract that you're dealing with that that's the security. It's not the CD, it's not the XRP, it's not any token itself.
00:35:37.290 - 00:35:51.500, Speaker A: So some of the allegations right now by the SEC, I believe they've called Coinbase, I think the Binance case as well, and legal securities exchange, like listing legal securities. Now, I may have the terminology off, but doesn't this completely.
