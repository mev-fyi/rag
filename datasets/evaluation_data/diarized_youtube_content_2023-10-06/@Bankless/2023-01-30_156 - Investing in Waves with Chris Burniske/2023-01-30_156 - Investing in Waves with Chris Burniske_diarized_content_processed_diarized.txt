00:00:00.170 - 00:00:31.830, Speaker A: When I'm looking for a spot to surf on any given day, I'm always looking for the best spot that has the fewest number of people, because I'm not going out there to compete with other people. I'm going out there to ride a wave. And I think that you can draw a parallel to how I invest and how placeholder invests in that. We're not so much in competition with other funds. We're not so much in competition with the leaders of these ecosystems. We want to be intellectually drawn to certain projects and certain value sets, and we want to ride that wave with that ecosystem.
00:00:34.170 - 00:01:03.626, Speaker B: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. This is how to get started, how to get better, how to front run the opportunity. This is Ryan Sean Adams. I'm here with David Hoffman, and we're here to help you become more Bankless guys. The episode title, Investing in Waves, are we talking about surfing? Are we talking capital deployment? The answer to that question is yes. David and I are chatting today with one of our favorite crypto investors of all time, Chris Berniski. A few takeaways from this episode.
00:01:03.626 - 00:01:34.086, Speaker B: Keep track of them. Number one, Chris uses the term trashy to describe many 2022 projects. Why did he use this word? He also describes uses that word to describe their founders. Number two, why crypto is like surfing and how you catch the best waves. Number three, we talk about the advanced warnings in 2021 that we should have all seen that crypto was in a massive bubble. Number four, chris's rules for staying sober don't fall in love with your coconuts. If you have no idea what that means, that's why you should listen this episode.
00:01:34.086 - 00:01:52.222, Speaker B: Number five, the current crypto market cycle, why Chris has suddenly flipped bullish. He's bullish now in 2023. And finally, we discuss Chris's bull case for Salana. We end with that and a few other things. This is a fantastic episode, david, what should folks pay attention to a while.
00:01:52.276 - 00:01:53.566, Speaker C: Ago on a weekly roll up?
00:01:53.588 - 00:02:51.134, Speaker D: Ryan, I gave the take that polymaths really understand crypto better than anyone stuck inside of one vertical. Like, economists don't understand crypto, but people who understand economics and computer science and psychology understand crypto. And Chris is really the embodiment of that. He understands so many different ways to evaluate crypto and he applies them. And that's really, I think, the magic behind Chris Berniski in this episode. In particular, we really carry through psyche psychology, individual psychology, market psychology, groupthink, and how it changes throughout the cycles, how groupthink is different during the bear market versus the bull market, and how you can understand groupthink, ride the waves of groupthink but not fall victim to groupthink. And so thinking about this episode through the lens of individual psyche, individual psychology is going to be very useful to just making it through the bear market and also not falling victim to the bugs.
00:02:51.134 - 00:02:53.138, Speaker D: The virus of the bull market.
00:02:53.304 - 00:03:22.666, Speaker B: Some housekeeping for you before we get in. This episode will be released as an NFT collectible the second of the year that we're doing, so stay tuned for that. That is coming on Monday. So the day this episode releases to the public, you can pick that episode up as an NFT. A collectible NFT also of course, stay tuned for the debrief where David and I will give our thoughts on the show after the show.

00:06:46.570 - 00:07:14.402, Speaker B: Bankless Nation excited to introduce you to Chris Berninsky once again. This is our second full episode with Chris. The last one we had with Chris was actually over two years ago, two and a half years ago. So this one's been a long time coming. Now we had Chris on with Kathy Wood from Ark Invest in the meanwhile, but we've been wanting to pick Chris's brain for a while. He is, of course, the co founder of Placeholder VC. He's the author of Crypto Assets.
00:07:14.402 - 00:07:35.134, Speaker B: He's considered, I think, both David and I consider him as one of our mentors in this space. In fact, I would credit Chris as one of the three people most forMount into getting me into crypto, particularly after I read his Crypto Assets book back in was that 2017, I believe. Chris, it's great to have you back on Bankless. How are you doing?
00:07:35.332 - 00:07:38.958, Speaker A: Thanks Ryan, and thanks for the warm intro. Good to see you both.
00:07:39.044 - 00:08:10.600, Speaker B: You know what, I just wanted to glow you up there because thanks. I'm really happy to be in crypto, and I first started getting interested in Bitcoin in 2014, but there wasn't very much else there in crypto for me, and I think that changed partially after I started getting involved in Ethereum, and then I started to understand the asset space after the book Crypto Assets. So thank you, my friend. I probably didn't say enough good things about you. I'm glad to be in crypto, and it's in no small part because of you.
00:08:11.050 - 00:09:04.922, Speaker A: Well, that warms my heart to, you know, the reason Jack and I wrote Crypto Assets at the time was because there were really only Bitcoin books, and the space was growing to be much larger than Bitcoin and, of course, writing a book. We started writing that book December of 2016, and we finished the first draft, March of 17. And March of 17 was actually right when everything started going crazy. I remember through March, we're watching the prices like two X, three X, five X. I think Ripple went crazy, all this kind of stuff. And we're like, oh my God, how do we cover this in a book? Right? Because things were moving so fast, but we just proceeded with the core things that we thought were important to investigate. And I think in time, it will just be viewed as a history book.
00:09:04.922 - 00:09:15.870, Speaker A: Right? It's a point in time. It's kind of between 16 and 17. Lots of people asked for an update. I think we could write a killer Crypto Assets V two. It's just finding the time.
00:09:16.020 - 00:09:54.486, Speaker D: I think the decision to not chase what was currently happening in crypto in that present moment and stick to your guns about writing for the original, tent the book Crypto Assets and not adapting it to whatever there was the present moment of crypto at the time is very on brand for you. And something I appreciate about you, Chris, is that no matter what's going on in the machinations of the crypto cycles, you always seem to be able to keep a level head on your shoulders and kind of see through the short term noise and the crypto Twitter conversation of the moment and keep yourself focused on the long term. So I guess we weren't done glowing you up enough in the interaction.
00:09:54.518 - 00:10:45.958, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I would kind of echo that because it wasn't just that it interested me in crypto after kind of reading that book more, but it also informed how I view the space, which is I think we're of a similar viewpoint in that Crypto Assets was very much kind of a thesis driven investment type book. As David said, it wasn't about kind of the narrative at the time of XRP is going to be the new Swift or whatever it was back in 2017. You really laid out a framework for how you actually evaluate the value of these things. And I think that thesis driven investment is really what we've tried to instill in Bankless is this is about long term perspectives, three to five to ten to 20 year perspectives, not the current narrative. In the moment. We're not traders. We're not narrative investors, and traders rotators.
00:10:45.958 - 00:10:51.898, Speaker B: We are fundamentals investors. And that kind of framework, I think, still applies very well, definitely.
00:10:52.064 - 00:12:00.930, Speaker A: And, I mean, society is a string of generations that all learn from each other, and I learned a lot of that from, you know, working at Ark Invest. In the time that I was writing that book, I was getting to know my two partners at Placeholder, joel Mongro and Brad Burnham, who are both very strong thesis thinkers or thesis crafters. And then also around when I was finishing Crypto Assets, joel and I were completing our thesis summary for Placeholder itself. And so there were a lot of people around me as know, no book is written by an author just sitting on an island. And I learned a lot from all of those folks that bolstered my own conviction, added pieces to it, and all those people remain in my life and continue to ground me as we proceed through crypto. And then I'm sure we'll get into crypto Twitter, and how I use that. I think that can be destabilizing if you're not careful.
00:12:01.350 - 00:12:16.150, Speaker B: Yeah, I've felt destabilized at times, to put it mildly, on crypto Twitter. Well, let's start here, though, because I want to provide some continuity. So the last time we had you just solo on an episode was over two years ago. In fact, almost three years ago. Can you believe it?
00:12:16.220 - 00:12:19.750, Speaker D: I think that's my record for the longest gap between repeat guests.
00:12:19.830 - 00:12:28.454, Speaker B: Yeah. And this was episode number 20 when we were just getting started. Okay, now we're in the hundreds, probably drawing closer to the thousands.
00:12:28.582 - 00:12:38.122, Speaker A: Built a huge brand. My hat off to you. I watched you guys rise all through the last bear market and become stars in the bowl. And here we are back in the bear.
00:12:38.186 - 00:13:06.840, Speaker B: Well, thank you for taking a risk on us by coming on this obscure podcast back in 2020. But I want to ask you now, so reflecting on the last two and a half years or so, I remember the episode we did at the time where you described kind of this bullishness on crypto, bullishness on ethereum. You described crypto as this infinite white space was a line you used. And I want to ask you about the last two and a half years. So what do you feel like you got the most right over the last two and a half years?
00:13:07.290 - 00:13:26.160, Speaker A: Sure. I'd say the most important thing I got right, which was not easy to get right at the time, and that was right around when we spoke as well, was just ethereum in 2018, 2019, around when I started noticing you guys, and I'm sure you recollect this as well.
00:13:27.650 - 00:13:28.922, Speaker E: ETH was crashing.
00:13:28.986 - 00:13:55.350, Speaker A: Right. It was going through an ICO deleveraging event. Bitcoin dominance was rising rapidly to the upside. Bitcoin maxis were out with the pitchforks. The narrative was that ETH was dying ETH was irrelevant. Even if you talked with a lot of VCs, say, traditional VCs were just like, up crypto is doing that thing again. It's falling 80, 90%.
00:13:55.350 - 00:14:37.254, Speaker A: Just forget about it and move on to the next thing. And then even crypto specific or crypto savvy VCs were losing conviction. Ethereum, they're like, it's taking too long to process network upgrades. Is the transition to proof of stake ever going to happen? You have all these next generation l ones coming about that are going to eat Ethereum's lunch. And you guys remember this, right? You remember how hard 19 was? And so ETH fell sub 100. That was pretty shocking. The first day that ETH fell sub 100, I just didn't even want to look at trading view.
00:14:37.254 - 00:14:53.180, Speaker A: It was so painful. And that's actually part of my own journey, right? Is like, getting better and better on those horrible days at just being able to withstand it and actually just keep buying, as opposed to being so disgusted that you can't handle it.
00:14:54.510 - 00:14:56.220, Speaker E: So that.
00:14:58.190 - 00:15:59.854, Speaker A: Hardening process, say, of having conviction and bolstering conviction in Ethereum while most people were running in the other direction, was really important for myself, really important for placeholder, and it allowed us to have a very large ETH position itself, but then also do a ton of venture investing around Ethereum seeding teams. Like, we seeded Zksync, we seeded Balancer, we seeded Uma and a number of other core Ethereum names. And the valuations were amazing. The teams were top notch. There wasn't really that much competition for it because most VCs were looking in other places. So directionally, that was, I think, the most correct thing from a financial perspective, but more importantly, from a values based perspective and what it brought to the crypto space.
00:16:00.052 - 00:16:07.380, Speaker B: And how about the flip side of that? So I got to ask the other question. Over the last two and a half years, what did you miss? What did you get wrong?
00:16:08.550 - 00:16:16.450, Speaker A: Well, I'm always surprised by how much the Trashiest Project can pump.
00:16:17.530 - 00:16:18.630, Speaker D: Trashy?
00:16:20.570 - 00:16:22.710, Speaker E: Yeah, trashy.
00:16:23.290 - 00:17:15.190, Speaker A: And I think an easy one to just say would be Luna. And I remember speaking with the Luna team, it was the DevCon that was held in Japan. I forget when that was, but it was in that time frame, the last bear, and Luna was sub a dollar. And I remember specifically, I just wanted one question answered, and that was, did the price of Luna have to keep going up for the system to remain stable? And it was danced around a lot, but ultimately the answer was yes, luna has to go up in price forever. And that's so clearly a broken system. Like nothing goes up forever. And nonetheless, the price of Luna seemingly went up forever.
00:17:15.190 - 00:17:22.780, Speaker A: And if I had been a trader, I could have minted, I don't know, 100, 200, X, like, something like that.
00:17:24.910 - 00:17:29.146, Speaker E: That's one place where temporarily, for a.
00:17:29.168 - 00:17:44.738, Speaker A: Period, I was wrong. As a trader or financial gain maximizer. I was wrong, and then ultimately I was right. But it takes time, and you kind of just have to stick to what you believe.
00:17:44.904 - 00:17:47.662, Speaker E: I would say something where I remain.
00:17:47.726 - 00:18:21.114, Speaker A: Wrong because I guess you could say with Luna, it was ultimately vindicated. But something where I remain wrong is we expected NFTs to be a big thing. I mean, NFTs is just the non fungible side of the universe from the fungible side of the universe that's clearly going to be huge in a digital context. But what I didn't expect is for the vector to be PFP profile picture NFTs of monkeys worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. That was surprising, and now I've accepted it.
00:18:21.152 - 00:18:25.534, Speaker E: And I would say one thing that.
00:18:25.572 - 00:18:35.758, Speaker A: 2021 taught me is if I have a really allergic reaction to something, I need to look closer at that thing. An allergic reaction is not an excuse.
00:18:35.774 - 00:18:38.018, Speaker E: To look away, but it's actually a.
00:18:38.024 - 00:18:56.278, Speaker A: Reason to look closer, because that intensity that I feel in a, say, negative direction, probably to a very different person, incurs intensity in a positive direction. And this is, I think, part of.
00:18:56.284 - 00:19:00.226, Speaker E: The practice as an investor of stripping.
00:19:00.258 - 00:19:18.730, Speaker A: Your emotions out of the process. I mean, you can use your emotions, you can observe your emotions, but you shouldn't let them shape the intellectual process. So they can be indicators to you that feed into the intellectual process. But the intellectual process should remain objective and rooted in study and reasoning.
00:19:18.890 - 00:19:41.910, Speaker B: That's a fascinating lesson. I hope Bankless listeners heard that. If you have an allergic reaction to something, it doesn't necessarily mean stay away. It means Chris is saying investigate it further. Yeah. Ask why figure that one out? Because there might be something to it. I want to go back really quickly before we continue moving to the word that you used, which piqued my interest.
00:19:41.910 - 00:20:17.140, Speaker B: When you're describing Luna trashy. It was a very interesting way to describe a project. And I think I'm taking that to mean as I read between the lines, a trashy project would be one that Chris thinks is focused on short termism short term price pumps, for example, shortcuts in general, that would make a project, in your eyes, more trashy than another. And you're saying that was very much exemplified in Luna at the time. Is that what makes a project trashy? It's just this short termist type of thinking in your mind?
00:20:17.510 - 00:20:57.502, Speaker A: Yeah, and it's a strong word for me to use, I guess. So it's definitely that short termism. It's definitely that focus on the pumps and the announcements and the announcements of the announcements. And that's also even just the way that the leader or the leadership comports themselves. And if you observed Do Kwan's behavior online, he was not interested in rigorous intellectual debate like you look at how Know behaves, or you look at Mustafa from Celestia or Tolle from Solana. I think those people, whether you agree.
00:20:57.556 - 00:20:59.854, Speaker E: With them or not, you will see.
00:20:59.892 - 00:22:11.270, Speaker A: Them sometimes go very deep in debate. And there will be different types of snark that they'll inject because they're all human, and that's fine, but the overwhelming response is not one of like snark or derogatory responses or whatever. And what I saw in Doe Kwan's behavior was basically someone who's high in their own supply power tripping. And the responses are not one of substance, but they're trashy, and they're geared to rile up a large group of the population and be like, RA, speak to those emotions we were talking about, which clouds reasoning, right? And so it's a manipulative process in my mind, if the followers of this individual aren't aware of it because they feel like they're going to battle, they're all charged up, they're all in, they're making money, but it really shuts down, say, the more important thinking parts of the brain, call it the prefrontal cortex or whatever. And that almost always leads to bad outcomes in crypto.
00:22:12.090 - 00:23:26.640, Speaker D: Chris, I think this is really tapping into one of the things that I think makes you stand out as a navigator of the crypto world is you have this inherent focus on individual psychology, being self aware, but also aware of the biases of others. And the way that psychology changes as a result of the crypto cycle. Everyone's psyche does change depending on where we are in the market. And honestly, the market is, of course, our collective psyches. And so maybe another way to identify what a trashy project is, is a project that creates a certain amount of just psychological response in people that is only sustainable during high activity, high fervor, bull, market type psychological environments. Does that track with you? And then how do you, if listeners don't know you are a surfer? And I think this ties in that kind of behavior ties into surfing, where you have to be patient, you have to know your limits, just like, how do you think about these things and how do you navigate them from a psychological perspective? Because I think everything that you say is always rooted in some sort of admission of bias or psychological understanding. Can you just elaborate on all of this?
00:23:27.730 - 00:24:25.506, Speaker A: Well, gosh, there's a lot in there. Well, so I'd say first you're correct in your further defining of trashy. And it's like another thing that happens is there's this bubble psychology that's created around a project like that, where because the leader does it, it justifies everyone else to just respond in this screaming way to any criticism, right? So that's something that happens. But actually what that creates, if you observe that, is like it's a monoculture, right, from my science background, and anyone can really know this, a monoculture is weaker, right? You want biodiversity in an ecosystem. Biodiversity creates a lot of resilience. And so you look at the ethereum ecosystem, there's a lot of debate. I would argue, same within Cosmos, same.
00:24:25.528 - 00:24:27.986, Speaker E: Within Solana, and we can come to.
00:24:28.008 - 00:25:29.494, Speaker A: Solana, but at the depths of the bottom last year for Solana, there was a lot of good conversation about how to make Solana better. And, like, people acknowledging, say, know the things done around FTX and Alameda needed to be learned from. It wasn't people like, screaming and being like, leave us alone. The substance of the conversation is really important to me and what ecosystems are trying to improve upon or learn upon relating it to surfing. I'm the type of surfer who I love a bunch of different kinds of waves, and I come to know the waves very well. And for people who don't know, surfing, at least surfing on a reef, is deterministic. So the bathymetry or the underwater topography will determine the shape of a wave and then swell direction, and a bunch of local conditions will further define how good the wave is going to be.
00:25:29.494 - 00:26:10.094, Speaker A: But when I'm looking for a spot to surf on any given day, I'm always looking for the best spot that has the fewest number of people, because I'm not going out there to compete with other people. I'm going out there to ride a wave. Right. I think that you could draw a parallel to how I invest and how placeholder invests in that. We're not so much in competition with other funds. We're not so much in competition with the leaders of these ecosystems. We want to be intellectually drawn to certain projects and certain value sets, and we want to ride that wave with that ecosystem.
00:26:10.094 - 00:26:32.970, Speaker A: Hopefully, it's a growing wave, and we're not so much distracted or perturbed or even drawn to a wave that has hundreds of thousands of people on it because all those people are there. It's more like, oh, that's a really nice looking wave, and there's actually not that many people over there. I should probably go ride that wave.
00:26:33.630 - 00:27:18.598, Speaker D: I love this illustration of I think it should be pretty clear for listeners that is an investing metaphor, and it also just works so well with surfing. And Ryan and I, of course, opened up this podcast talking about, like, hey, we really respect you as a thinker and as a thesis driven investor. And a lot of that has been imbued in Bankless. Right. Like, ride the theses over the long term, not the short term narratives. And something I guess I'm kind of proud of is during January 4 of 2022, a little bit over a year ago, I got in a fight with Daniel SESTA, and then he sent his frog army after us. And then two or three weeks later, the Wonderland system blew up.
00:27:18.598 - 00:27:54.180, Speaker D: A few weeks later, we got into a fight with Do Kwan. And while Do Kwan and his army was at the height of it cresting cresting at its wave, and then a few weeks later, Terra Luna blew up. Blew up. Same thing, kind of followed with Riaira's Capital, and then same thing followed with SBF when we had him on. There seems to be this moment where these waves crest. And because Bankless, we are a media company, we talk about things that are cresting. There seems to be this pattern of people, especially in the second half of a bull market, where they're cresting, and that is their last gasp for air before they go under.
00:27:54.180 - 00:28:14.426, Speaker D: And I think the alignment that we have as Bankless as a thesis driven media company and Placeholder as a thesis driven venture capital firm, we're approaching these things in the same way, where there's a big wave, and we'll talk about it on Bankless. But man, does it rub us the wrong way. I'm sure that's how you react as.
00:28:14.448 - 00:28:23.966, Speaker A: An investor, as I mean, I think the podcast you guys did with Eric Voorhees and, you know, a seminal moment.
00:28:24.148 - 00:28:27.534, Speaker E: In crypto, and I think that was.
00:28:27.572 - 00:28:40.734, Speaker A: The moment when a lot of people realized sam had no clothes, emperor had no clothes. So, yeah, it's a tricky position you guys are in. I mean, we're all put in tricky.
00:28:40.782 - 00:28:49.298, Speaker E: Positions, but how do you remain how.
00:28:49.304 - 00:29:14.314, Speaker A: Do you behave in such a way where you're not going to push away, say, all of these guests because you want to get them on your show, right? But then you want to ask them tough questions and you want to in that question asking, reveal who they actually are. But if you irritate them too much while they're at the crest of their wave, they're probably not going to join, or they might rage quit, or there's a balance there.
00:29:14.352 - 00:30:04.830, Speaker B: I think one thing we've learned is just, like, ask a lot of questions. And I think that maybe not over the short run, but over the long run, people are smart. We have faith in the people who listen to the Bankless podcast. And if you can allow an individual to kind of articulate themselves, ask lots of questions, tell their story, then listeners can kind of decide for themselves. That was very much the case in the Voorhees and SBF debate that you were just mentioning, Chris, where it's basically we're just like, okay, you guys talk. And through the process of talking, that's when Sam really revealed that indeed he was wearing no clothes, or he took that approach too. He was just like asking quick questions, firing something back, letting SBF respond.
00:30:04.830 - 00:30:34.854, Speaker B: Yeah, that was the model I want to get to kind of the market and your sentiment as well, because I think I recall on Twitter, because I follow you and I encourage everybody to go follow Chris Berninsky's Twitter account. We'll include a link in the show notes. But you were somewhat bearish on crypto in 2021 and 2022. And I should specify not long term bearish, I don't think. And again, this is just my perception, so you correct me if I'm wrong.
00:30:34.892 - 00:30:35.142, Speaker E: Sure.
00:30:35.196 - 00:31:22.326, Speaker B: But this was a. Time when a lot of people believed in this idea, popularized by 3 Hours capital called the super cycle, which is crypto, will never go down in the way that it's gone down in previous cycles. Like, there'll be no more 70% plus drawdowns in this asset class. We've reached mass adoption now, and we're in the super cycle phase. I distinctly recall you on Twitter during this time period where everyone's bullish pushing back against that. I guess I'm curious as to why you had the conviction to push against that in that time that was not as popular. What indicators did you see? How did you know that we were not in a super cycle at the time? So you can put us back in your shoes in 2021 and maybe early 2022.
00:31:22.508 - 00:31:23.240, Speaker E: Sure.
00:31:24.570 - 00:31:29.180, Speaker A: Well, I think the first thing to recognize is that a.
00:31:30.910 - 00:31:33.686, Speaker E: Super cycle narrative.
00:31:33.798 - 00:31:36.010, Speaker A: Is a symptom of Euphoria.
00:31:36.510 - 00:31:40.042, Speaker E: So it's actually something that I would.
00:31:40.096 - 00:31:51.150, Speaker A: Look for as confirmation for me, that actually strengthens my conviction that something's not right. It doesn't actually make it harder for me to be bearish. It makes it easier.
00:31:52.130 - 00:31:56.174, Speaker E: And I think that's an important unlock.
00:31:56.222 - 00:32:49.858, Speaker A: That a lot of people have to go through is not feeling the tug of really strong momentum at extreme moments of the market, either bull or bear, but instead seeing how strong that momentum or that tug is. And it's euphoria at the top, it's hysteria at the bottom, and using that as the marker or the confirmation that something's not right and it's not going to last forever in the direction that everyone is saying it's going to last. So that would be kind of lesson number one from that point in time. As I recall, I think I got pretty publicly bearish in Q four of 2021. I actually got faked out in May of 2021. I don't get everything right. One thing I'm worried about is people are starting to be like, chris is always going to be right, okay, we.
00:32:49.864 - 00:32:53.140, Speaker B: Glowed him up too much. David, we got to put down.
00:32:54.870 - 00:33:09.642, Speaker A: I'm definitely wrong many times. And May of 2021, I was wrong in that I got blindsided. I don't know if you guys remember May of 2021, but that was basically.
00:33:09.696 - 00:33:14.220, Speaker E: The blow off top of DFI Summer 2020.
00:33:15.630 - 00:33:48.654, Speaker A: Everything was going crazy. I think that's the first time that ETH got into the 4000s quickly. Very quickly. Yeah, very quickly. A bunch of DFI names hit their highs actually in May of 2021 and never got back to those highs. And then like, June, July, I think even into August. I'm not looking at the charts right now, but there were a few months where I think BTC retraced to the high 20s low thirty s, and a bunch of names got walloped.
00:33:48.654 - 00:34:02.246, Speaker A: And by walloped, I mean over 50% declines, if not more. And I didn't expect that to happen in May, so I was kind of blindsided. But then June, July, August, it didn't.
00:34:02.278 - 00:34:03.900, Speaker E: Feel like we were done yet.
00:34:04.670 - 00:34:39.266, Speaker A: And then I would say what started to unnerve me into October, but it was really like November. December was the parabolic rise of a number of new names, right? So like Luna, Avalanche, Solana, and then the behavior that accompanied those parabolic rises, right? So, like, first there's the super cycle. That's a symptom of euphoria. Then you look at the charts, they're parabolic on the new names and people are saying, oh, well, BTC and ETH aren't quite parabolic.
00:34:39.378 - 00:34:42.246, Speaker E: But the thing is, and this is.
00:34:42.268 - 00:35:34.066, Speaker A: Where it helps to have been in crypto for a long time, as you understand the maturity of these assets, you know that as they get bigger, as they get more liquid, they're going to move a little less. So like, BTC will move the least. Then, you know, probably next cycle, Seoul. And so you kind of start to understand the risk spectrum in that way. But we're seeing parabolic prices. Something I was seeing on the venture side was actually innovation was slowing while deal pace was increasing and like basically frantic deal pace, where people are like, nice to meet you, we closed yesterday kind of thing. And then also even just the ways that entrepreneurs treat VCs changes bear to bull.
00:35:34.066 - 00:35:42.646, Speaker A: So like, in a bowl, you'll have a lot more entitled behavior from entrepreneurs.
00:35:42.838 - 00:35:44.682, Speaker E: And then I think the important thing.
00:35:44.816 - 00:36:33.190, Speaker A: For a VC in a bear is to not then pay it back by being entitled, because the balance of power swings in a bull. The entrepreneur has all the power in a bear. A VC has a lot of the power. And so just observing, say, more bad entrepreneur behavior or just uncouth, I guess, entrepreneur behavior that was happening a lot into late 2021. So there were a ton of markers. You could also see it, I think, in a number of and we'll get into some on chain stuff, but look into Bitcoin, I think is a great resource, public resource for a lot of people to track Bitcoin on chain metrics and ratios. And you could see it getting pretty toppy.
00:36:33.270 - 00:36:36.246, Speaker E: So when you have a crazy convergence.
00:36:36.278 - 00:37:17.590, Speaker A: Of things like that, it's a very strong indicator. So I'm never using one indicator. And the last thing I would say is growth equities had been in decline for a while. Inflation was starting to peak. Like the writing was starting to be on the wall that the tides were going to change from a monetary perspective. And I'm not as much an expert in that realm, but I talked with Kathy Wood a fair amount and I have other people that I subscribe to in terms of newsletters, and that's a benefit of being an institution that were like, giving me some warning signs of the tides turning.
00:37:18.890 - 00:37:42.720, Speaker D: Chris, I want to ask, you said you flipped bearish in the Q four of 2021. And I remember you were the first crypto Twitter person that I remember who was like, okay, I am now Bearish. And I'm tweeting about my bearishness. And for me and many of many others, it's like, man, that's really early. There's got to be so much left in this bull market.
00:37:44.450 - 00:37:45.790, Speaker B: Ten k, baby.
00:37:46.850 - 00:38:18.778, Speaker D: And you were a little bit early in terms of it was a little bit early in time. It was a little bit early in price. It ultimately came to be right because we went down so bad. But you had to have gone I think you went throughout 2021 being Bearish, sticking to your guns while a bunch of crazy stuff happened, and then only to be proven right well into 2022. And I remember my personal relationship with 2021 was hearing the words, oh, that's a top signal. Oh, that's a top signal. Oh, that's a top signal every single month of 2021.
00:38:18.778 - 00:38:59.174, Speaker D: And I remember the top signals of 2017, which was my first real exposure into a crypto cycle, even investing in the first place, like Katy Perry's digital asset painted fingernails. Yeah, that was a really good top signal. And it was also the top throughout 2021. People couldn't you couldn't go a week without getting a top signal. By halfway into 2021, I was like, what's the point of listening to these top signals? We had a top signal yesterday, and we all have a top signal tomorrow. I'm getting top signal fatigue. So how did you stick to your guns? Because I started writing off every single top signal that I had in 2021 because it didn't matter.
00:38:59.174 - 00:39:16.058, Speaker D: There are top signals left and right, but you stuck to your guns the whole way through and through. You never fell victim to the super cycle like bug that everyone caught, including myself. How did you just grit your teeth and go all the way through 2021 without having to capitulate?
00:39:16.234 - 00:39:37.590, Speaker A: Yeah, well, actually, it's funny. A moment in crypto Twitter that I remember is you responded to one of my tweets in Q Four being like, shut up, Chris. I'm busy collecting free money like a toy car, like doing donuts with, like, dollar bills falling. I was like, thanks, David.
00:39:38.330 - 00:39:41.766, Speaker B: Somewhere, David knew that this wasn't I.
00:39:41.788 - 00:39:45.560, Speaker D: Am the top signal. Yeah. I'll add to the top signals out.
00:39:47.710 - 00:39:51.146, Speaker E: Mean I want to be clear about.
00:39:51.248 - 00:40:59.626, Speaker A: The fact that I am always making tons of mistakes in entries and exits, and maybe I shouldn't frame them as mistakes. Such as? I'm not trying to optimize buying everything right at the bottom and selling everything right at the top because it's actually impossible. And anyone who aspires to do it is just going to end up getting whiplashed because when prices are really low, they're going to just keep waiting and waiting and waiting and be like, oh, well, BTC is at 15K. I'll buy it at ten k, and then BTC is at ten k, and they're like, well, I'll buy it at five k, right? Or the flip happens to the upside. And so what I do is kind of an easy way, and I always have to be careful because Placeholder is a registered investment advisor, but a mental heuristic or like a framework to use would be okay if you have an investment and you put your cost into it. So that's your one x. So, like, you put $100 in, you've got $100 for that investment.
00:40:59.658 - 00:41:02.442, Speaker E: So you're at one X if that.
00:41:02.516 - 00:41:13.746, Speaker A: Investment goes ten x, right? So now you have ten x your cost. You should consider taking, in my opinion, at least two X out.
00:41:13.928 - 00:41:17.606, Speaker E: You just guaranteed doubled your money, and.
00:41:17.628 - 00:41:19.474, Speaker A: You have eight X of that investment.
00:41:19.522 - 00:41:23.206, Speaker E: Riding that investment doubles again.
00:41:23.388 - 00:41:26.422, Speaker A: You now have 16 X of your.
00:41:26.476 - 00:41:29.820, Speaker E: Original investment still in the market.
00:41:30.270 - 00:41:32.842, Speaker A: If you take something like four X.
00:41:32.896 - 00:41:35.354, Speaker E: Out, you're now sitting at a six.
00:41:35.392 - 00:41:41.062, Speaker A: X realized, and you still have twelve X of your initial investment.
00:41:41.126 - 00:41:43.550, Speaker B: Wait, you could do that? You could take money off the table.
00:41:44.290 - 00:41:46.160, Speaker D: You're allowed to do that possible.
00:41:46.930 - 00:42:36.766, Speaker A: That twelve x doubles instead of 24 x, you take another four x, you just ten x. You guarantee ten x your money, and you still have 20 X of what you originally put in. And now there's only so long that you can play this game. But I encourage people to look at their cost in different investments they've made, set up now, like in the bear market prices, where they would be really happy if it hit this price. And what multiple of their costs would they take off the table at certain prices? And this is called tranching out or legging out. And you can do the same thing, legging in, where you buy at certain prices and you just keep buying and buying buying, because if you don't do it and if you don't have a.
00:42:36.788 - 00:42:38.890, Speaker E: Plan, you won't exit.
00:42:38.970 - 00:43:28.538, Speaker A: And you'll get lost in the bubble psychology or you'll get lost in the bearish psychology. So if you don't have a plan, then let's say you put in, like, I don't know, let's say you put in $1,000 and it's now at $10,000. You're going to be like, well, I'm going to wait until this is $100,000 before I take any money off. And then once that 100,000, you're like, well, I'm not that far from a million, so I'll wait for a million. And then you get caught in that as opposed to taking money off the table. It doesn't mean that you're not a believer in the ecosystem or ecosystems that you're supporting. And in some ways, I would say selling when everyone is buying and buying when everyone is selling is actually helpful to the volatility of that asset.
00:43:28.714 - 00:43:29.102, Speaker E: Right.
00:43:29.156 - 00:43:37.566, Speaker A: Because you're dampening the upside and you're dampening the downside because you're doing the counter trend behavior.
00:43:37.758 - 00:43:40.318, Speaker D: Not too euphoric, not too depressed.
00:43:40.494 - 00:43:40.930, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:43:41.000 - 00:44:31.220, Speaker A: And then the thing that people will struggle with in both situations is, let's say I don't know, you started in the last cycle, you started taking profits when ETH was at three k. Well, then by the time it's at 4500 or whatever, you're like, oh, it just ran another 50%. I could have made 50% more. But then when you set 800 or 1000 or 1200, you're like, well, I definitely should have sold at three k. What was I doing? And so the important thing is to not kick yourself, not aim for perfection. Have a plan that's good enough that you're satisfied with, and chances are you'll do well if you stick to that plan. Getting a two to three to four X is unheard of in almost any other asset class.
00:44:31.220 - 00:44:36.546, Speaker A: And then on the downside, when things.
00:44:36.568 - 00:44:39.702, Speaker E: Are dropping, similarly, if you have price.
00:44:39.756 - 00:45:07.918, Speaker A: Targets and you buy there and it falls another 50%, so long as you keep buying and you don't shy up. The thing that people do in bear markets is they make their trade sizes smaller and smaller. That's actually the wrong thing to do. You want to either keep your trade sizes equal or go bigger because the units you will buy at the bottom with an equal trade size or a greater trade size will blow you away later, and then you can end up with a really good average price even if you started buying a little high.
00:45:08.004 - 00:45:24.882, Speaker B: I think this is like evergreen an evergreen insight, right? And it's basically the idea is, look, next bull market, you're going to be drunk, okay? And the time to make your plan of how to get home from the party is not after you're drunk, all right?
00:45:24.936 - 00:45:25.154, Speaker E: Correct.
00:45:25.192 - 00:45:51.740, Speaker B: You got to make those plans in advance when you're sober and when you can think it through, not when you're like, drunk and partying with everybody else. Because that's what a bull market is. And it felt this way the end of 2021, didn't it? People getting tattoos with their favorite crypto assets. The market was crazy, everyone was drunk, and if you didn't have your plan, you weren't going to actually ever sell.
00:45:52.210 - 00:46:00.094, Speaker A: Yeah, another thing that happens. I've kind of developed the analogy more.
00:46:00.132 - 00:46:02.926, Speaker E: Animalistically, but it's like if you think.
00:46:02.948 - 00:46:29.910, Speaker A: Of us, I live in a tropical place, so I'll use coconuts. And these crypto assets are these magical coconuts when they're going up, and it's like they grow brighter and brighter green the more they go up. And we become more and more attached to them. We get the tattoos, we go to parties, we really identify with them. We tell everyone about them. So the more they go up, the more they're these magical green coconuts that we just can't possibly part with. Yes.
00:46:29.910 - 00:47:18.354, Speaker A: So if you don't set a plan to part with them, then you're so emotionally attached that you can't possibly sell them. And then it's super painful if you part with some of them and then they multiply even more and you're like, oh my God. If I hadn't sold those ten coconuts, they'd be worth 20 coconuts now, right? And so you kind of drive yourself crazy with the magic coconuts to the downside. They become these withered, nasty, red, decaying coconuts. And you're like, oh my God, I had so many beautiful green coconuts. And now they're all withered and how do I only have two coconuts when I once had 100 coconuts? And then that pain, and it truly is pain that it causes in your brain then causes you to act irrationally. And sometimes that will cause people to capitulate sell the bottom because they just can't take it anymore.
00:47:18.402 - 00:47:21.170, Speaker B: They're rotting, they smell bad, you want to throw it in the trash.
00:47:21.330 - 00:47:25.340, Speaker A: They turn from loving them to hating them. It's a very emotional thing.
00:47:26.030 - 00:47:57.326, Speaker D: I think this is the first time the word coconut has ever been uttered on the bank. Ten times just then, Chris, not too long ago, last November, we did a Twitter spaces together and we talked about a number of different indicators that the market had bottomed. And this is to save myself from tweeting at you during the bull market. When I noticed that you flipped bullish, I was like, Chris Berniski's flipped bullish. The seasons have changed. And that was around in November of this last year. That was right after FTX.
00:47:57.326 - 00:48:16.790, Speaker D: So I'm wondering if we can kind of run through some of the things that made the changing of the seasons happen for you. There was a number of different things we talked about. If there are some on chain indicators, there's some crypto Twitter sentiment that you were looking at, also some macro inflation. What triggered the changing of the seasons for you, Chris?
00:48:16.950 - 00:48:17.466, Speaker E: Sure.
00:48:17.568 - 00:48:30.350, Speaker A: Well, first off, I'd say that was well done by you in that you moved on a dime. And intra week we set up that space and FTX was in the midst of melting down. I think that week.
00:48:30.420 - 00:48:31.534, Speaker D: It was the week after, yeah.
00:48:31.572 - 00:48:32.762, Speaker A: Or the week after. Yeah.
00:48:32.836 - 00:48:34.770, Speaker B: Funny week to flip bullish.
00:48:35.270 - 00:48:36.930, Speaker D: Well, that's the right time, right?
00:48:37.080 - 00:48:51.270, Speaker A: That is the time. That is the time. I think what had happened is I was waiting for one last big capitulation. And when I saw after Terra Luna, you mean?
00:48:51.340 - 00:48:53.782, Speaker E: Yeah, after one of the two.
00:48:53.836 - 00:48:56.600, Speaker A: Yeah, correct. After terra three AC.
00:48:57.710 - 00:49:00.986, Speaker E: If you just looked at what was.
00:49:01.008 - 00:49:35.566, Speaker A: Going on in the markets, in the macro data, and by markets I mean equities and crypto, but it was particularly apparent in crypto. We were kind of weekly rallying, but we couldn't really get off the floor. It was kind of clear. We're just limping along. And that reminded me quite a bit of the back half of 18 where we just kind of limped along and we were like, limping, limping, limping. No strength, no strength. And in an environment like that, when there's so much fear, you get one more big catalyst.
00:49:35.566 - 00:50:17.454, Speaker A: And prices were already pretty low, but you get one more big downside catalyst, and you get like a major capitulation flush, right? Because you're limping along because there's not that many buyers. People are like, well, I don't want to sell here, but they don't have a bunch of conviction to hold. And then you get that event where it's like FTX and it's like, I'm out. And then it's just a capitulation flush. So that definitely happened in the price charts. We got capitulation sentiment wise. You also saw basically everyone go into hysteria.
00:50:17.454 - 00:50:56.526, Speaker A: I shouldn't say everyone, but the majority go into hysteria. And there were a lot of previously credible, well reasoned people that were running around spreading rumors on sparse information and with flawed reasoning, and basically everyone and their brother and sister was going to be insolvent next, right? And once you start to see enough of those claims go viral that you know to not be true, then it's like, okay, this is like peak irrationality to the downside. And then one thing I want to.
00:50:56.548 - 00:51:15.426, Speaker D: Pull out right there is you just said enough of these claims go viral. It's one part where people are making the claims, but the sentiment of people also need to enable those claims to go viral. And that's the other half of the equation. There's two players. There's the people seeding the takes, and then there's the market accepting them, and that is going viral. And so both factors have to be true.
00:51:15.528 - 00:51:26.722, Speaker A: That's actually a really good point, because it's a way that I use my Twitter handle or that I observe other Twitter handles. Like bullish takes will be max virality.
00:51:26.786 - 00:51:28.650, Speaker E: At the top, right?
00:51:28.800 - 00:51:45.274, Speaker A: And bearish takes will be minimum virality at the top. And then at the bottom, bearish takes will be max virality and bullish takes will be like, people just don't want to hear it. Or there's hundreds of responses as to why you're incorrect.
00:51:45.322 - 00:51:48.910, Speaker B: So we can use Twitter to generate alpha. We just have to do the opposite.
00:51:50.210 - 00:51:55.278, Speaker D: Okay, this is only for you. You don't get to share it. It doesn't get shared.
00:51:55.454 - 00:52:05.750, Speaker A: And know that if you share your opinion, people will hate you until like three months later. That was like crypto specific stuff.
00:52:05.820 - 00:52:08.502, Speaker E: And then we also spent some time.
00:52:08.556 - 00:53:11.180, Speaker A: Talking about macro and the rates of change, and we were seeing some early signs of inflation tapering. Also, there were whispers because that was November, that in December it was going to be a 50 bips hike from the Fed as opposed to 75 that ultimately came to be true. And so there were a number of things within the macro data that were pointing to slowing rates of change. And I remember spending some time talking about that. And it's worth reiterating because this was a key lesson that Kathy taught me, which know, markets are always forward looking and so they're always taking rates of change and projecting them. And so markets don't bottom on the absolute best or worst numbers they tend to bottom or top on the absolute highest or lowest rates of change. And that's a really key thing to drill into the rate of change.
00:53:12.590 - 00:53:36.674, Speaker D: And since we're talking about Psych, just to add one more quip, since this episode is really about psyche and how the brain works in relation to the markets, your brain doesn't release dopamine when it receives a reward. It releases dopamine on the anticipation of receiving a reward. So it's always front running. So the rate of change is built into markets and also your brain, too.
00:53:36.792 - 00:54:29.140, Speaker A: Yeah, that's awesome. I like that. And so, at the margin, if you have a really bad rate of change, which is what we're going through for a lot of 22, and that rate of change is starting to get less bad, those first signs of less bad are really important to pay attention to now. A lot of more uninformed people will be like, but inflation is still so high. But that's the absolute number. And what's more important is that the rate of change is starting to falter or get less bad. And that is the setup for more optimism, right? Because then people can start to project, okay, by this time, inflation will have gotten better and we can buy risk assets again, and rates will be at XYZ or whatever it might be.
00:54:30.470 - 00:54:45.830, Speaker B: So this is why you flipped bullish, then, Chris? So is it true that, of course, none of this is financial advice, none of us have a crystal ball, but do you think we've seen the worst of kind of the dip? Have we already seen the bottom for at least assets like Bitcoin and ETH?
00:54:49.210 - 00:54:50.600, Speaker A: I think that.
00:54:52.650 - 00:54:56.970, Speaker E: ETH and Seoul have seen their bottoms.
00:54:57.310 - 00:55:02.080, Speaker A: I think there's a small chance BTC could revisit its bottom.
00:55:04.530 - 00:55:06.942, Speaker E: And that's maybe.
00:55:06.996 - 00:55:09.294, Speaker A: A little counter consensus, but it's only.
00:55:09.332 - 00:55:14.100, Speaker E: Because Seoul's three X off its bottom.
00:55:14.950 - 00:55:17.154, Speaker A: And ETH is two X off its.
00:55:17.192 - 00:55:24.580, Speaker E: Bottom, and BTC is like 50% off its bottom.
00:55:28.090 - 00:55:39.962, Speaker A: And BTC is the first to be majorly influenced by a bad situation in Macroland. And so, even though I expect things.
00:55:40.016 - 00:55:43.366, Speaker E: To continue to ameliorate here, it wouldn't.
00:55:43.398 - 00:56:06.580, Speaker A: Surprise me in the second half this year to have some major shock or something that sets us aback. And I can more easily see BTC falling 33% back to that level, presuming it stays here, which I actually also don't think it stays here.
00:56:07.670 - 00:56:10.900, Speaker E: So there's a chance that that happens.
00:56:11.510 - 00:56:20.710, Speaker A: That BTC would go back to its bottom. And that's just specifically answering your question. What I anticipate to happen is everything puts in higher lows.
00:56:21.450 - 00:56:26.326, Speaker E: So I could see fifty K is.
00:56:26.348 - 00:57:16.994, Speaker A: Like an important number for BTC. So I could see a reach for that and not quite getting it. I could see east reaching for call it between three, and could see Seoul reaching for 80 to 100 kind of thing. But then there's really strong support for BTC at 20K for ETH, right around where it is now to 1200 for Seoul at 30. So I'm prepared for a whiplash scenario like that. I think that if we get another big move up here, which I kind of expect, that's going to really cause people to FOMO, and that's going to start to get mainstream attention and there'll be like this mini bubble. I think where people be like, oh, I got to allocate.
00:57:16.994 - 00:57:52.580, Speaker A: Or people who've been on the sidelines be like, I can't take this anymore. Right? And then you're setting up for just a Max Pain scenario, like Max Whiplash. People get overly enthusiastic, but rates aren't at a place that we can sustain huge moves in risk assets. I also think there's a lot more work to do on the innovation side of crypto to really have fundamentals driven rally, like sustained rally. And so that's where I think we'll get whiplashed at some point this year.
00:57:53.190 - 00:58:53.362, Speaker D: Yeah, certainly. I think people will make the mistake of not resetting what normal prices are in their head as they go through this bear market where perhaps we've set the bottoms. But people will probably forget that going up to maybe two thirds up to our previous all time highs is now kind of the normal and now is considered inside of a particular range. This is exactly what happened during last bear market, 2018 to 2020, where ether bottomed at $80, and then went all the way up to the high, high price of $360 before going back down to $100. And people just weren't expecting a three and a half X in prices without triggering a bull market. Like, how could you go up three and a half X without that being a bull market? And it was exactly the moment that people FOMOed into that went on for like a year and a half or so before we actually broke out as a result of DFI. Summer and actually did begin to set new highs.
00:58:53.362 - 00:59:29.870, Speaker D: And I actually remember that moment in 2020 where ether ranged between 300 and $100, like three different times, and then when it broke up and hit something like 425, me and many other people around here, too, was like, oh yeah, it's on. We all believe it. It was pretty easy to identify in that one moment, but for a lot of newcomers, that's a novel experience for them. Chris, after we go through this, perhaps twelve to 18 months of chop that we are perhaps expecting, what are you really looking for to say? Like, all right, we're done here. Like, the bear market is over new bull markets on what needs to be true for that to be your reaction?
00:59:29.950 - 01:00:30.550, Speaker A: I think the main thing that needs to be true is we need to see new applications and new uses of crypto that are blowing all our minds. And that's what 2020 was with DFI. Summer, who were like, whoa, this is crazy. This is a whole financial system and yeah, it's rough at the edges, but it works. And I can do all the stuff that I can do in a traditional financial system. And I couldn't do that in 2017, couldn't do it in 18, couldn't do it in 19, but I could do it in 20 pretty seamlessly with the full suite of services. And this is where I would kind of segment future expansion into a conviction or fundamentals based rally first that kind of exhausts itself, then followed by the Copycat Scammer Euphoria Rally, which will take certain things higher, but will actually really divorce itself from fundamentals.
01:00:30.550 - 01:01:16.850, Speaker A: And that conviction fundamentals based rally just requires new things to be built, right? And even actually for the different layer ones, very much including ETH, all those new things being built drives a lot of underlying demand. Buy pressure for the underlying layer one assets, right? And then everyone starts being like, wow, all this new stuff is happening. No way am I selling ETH or Sol or AVAX or whatever, right? And so then you have all this demand by people being really excited by what's happening, and that's what tends to set off these kind of, like, stepladder moves upwards.
01:01:16.930 - 01:02:01.730, Speaker B: You know what, though, Chris? All that seems too simple in some ways. Here's what I'm asking about. Isn't this how 2014 through 2017 kind of the doldrums, and then something new happened. Oh, that new thing was Smart Contracts and this thing called Ethereum. Then 2017, we had ICOs, and the exact same thing happened 2018 to 2020, all the way to DFI. Summer is our base case. Then just to anticipate the same thing playing out once again, and even on a similar timescale, like, okay, yeah, this is the point in time where you have two years or so of building and we wait for cool stuff to happen.
01:02:01.730 - 01:02:25.180, Speaker B: And then after that we get to kind of the fundamentals rally, and then after that we get kind of the fake Scam rally or whatever people want to call it, and it's roughly on like the same four to five year cycle. Is that just the base case? Is that how crypto works? Because if so, it feels like this is so predictable, man, because we've seen this story at least twice, maybe three times.
01:02:26.110 - 01:02:59.718, Speaker A: Well, so this is a really great question and makes me there's a lot of ways to approach answering it on one hand. So I've bounced around in my mind about this, but and where I've ultimately settled is assume humans don't change because they don't that much, right? And so that is the starting assumption. And then if you were to deviate from the pattern, you have to have really good reasons why you're going to.
01:02:59.724 - 01:03:02.198, Speaker E: Deviate versus just saying, oh, this is.
01:03:02.204 - 01:03:15.770, Speaker A: Too easy, too predictable, because I went through the this is too easy, too predictable into 2021, and that bull. And then the bear of last year into this year.
01:03:15.840 - 01:03:16.026, Speaker E: So.
01:03:16.048 - 01:03:20.762, Speaker A: I've kind of been through that, of like, how is this happening again? This is ridiculous.
01:03:20.826 - 01:03:21.440, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:03:23.090 - 01:03:31.390, Speaker A: But despite me feeling that it didn't prevent it from happening, right. So that would be my starting place.
01:03:31.460 - 01:03:38.034, Speaker E: Is what are the reasons for this being different? I would say the number one biggest reason.
01:03:38.152 - 01:04:32.722, Speaker A: Or maybe there's I feel more strongly about there being one, and that's just where rates go. Like, if a risk free rate of return is 4% for a sustained period, that sucks so much energy out of risk assets like equities, like crypto, because all of a sudden, your base rate of return is 5%. So in order to take more risk than a treasury, you got to be getting 1015, 20, 30% or more out of something like crypto. And so that just ends up discounting all risk assets more so that I could see clamping things. And you have some heavyweights of traditional know, drucken. Miller or Howard Marks from Oaktree saying.
01:04:32.776 - 01:04:36.100, Speaker E: That we have a regime change.
01:04:36.490 - 01:04:40.150, Speaker A: This is going to be a fundamentally different period going forward.
01:04:40.220 - 01:04:44.278, Speaker B: These guys are predicting, like, a flat decade for risk on assets, aren't they?
01:04:44.444 - 01:04:45.400, Speaker E: They are.
01:04:45.770 - 01:05:47.478, Speaker A: Now where I start to question maybe these guys are too old and too out of touch or too actually beholden to their own patterns is when I look at and this is where you would put me more in. The Kathy Wood camp where I look at the rate of change and the rate of innovation and the massive amount of GDP growth occurring within crypto. It's insane, right? It's like triple digit CAGRs every year. And those guys, Marks and whoever, they're not paying attention to that Drucken. Miller is favorable to BTC, but they're not like, in the weeds being like, oh, my God, look at how much this is growing. And if they could believe that an economy was growing at a triple digit CAGR, they might be like, well, that could probably overwhelm a stricter money environment.
01:05:47.574 - 01:05:51.102, Speaker E: And so this is where I guess.
01:05:51.156 - 01:06:20.162, Speaker A: I have some conflict in my own head. The way that I deal with it is I actually don't really care whatever happens, because I have a plan. I have price targets which are meaningful to me and placeholder. And if we hit those price targets in 2025, I'll take action. If we hit them in 2027 because things are more delayed, then it'll just take me more time, and I'm not in a rush.
01:06:20.306 - 01:06:21.000, Speaker E: Right.
01:06:21.530 - 01:06:22.920, Speaker A: I believe that.
01:06:24.890 - 01:06:28.062, Speaker E: We will have multiple.
01:06:28.226 - 01:06:56.258, Speaker A: Crypto networks in the trillion plus range, right? And so that's where my head is. No one can say exactly how long it'll take. The starting case would be okay if we just repeat the past cycles. 2024 is a big year. Next year is like, rising expansion. 2025 is the crazy year, right? If we're starting to see the patterns, then it's like, okay, pay attention, guys. It's happening again, whether you like it or not.
01:06:56.258 - 01:07:27.674, Speaker A: The other thing I'd point out is we're all crypto nerds. We live, breathe and eat this. But for most of the population, crypto kind of comes and goes, right? And it's like, oh, this cool thing is back. I'm just going to yolo into this. It's not like, oh, we're doing this again, and look at where ETH is and BTC is, and I shouldn't use this app or buy this monkey PFP. It's like, wow, I just really want that thing because everyone wants that thing. And then that's kind of the herd psychology that'll fuel a lot of stuff.
01:07:27.674 - 01:07:41.454, Speaker A: So even though we're maybe going through this meta experience of how is this happening en masse to all of us, I think that a lot of people are not going through that meta experience and know going for it.
01:07:41.492 - 01:07:44.814, Speaker E: And the bad memories of crypto from.
01:07:44.852 - 01:07:47.538, Speaker A: A few years past have faded for them.
01:07:47.624 - 01:07:59.160, Speaker B: I guess that's true, david, not everyone in the world subscribed to the Bankless podcast yet. And so some people, some percentage of the population will miss this episode with Chris and not realize what's happening here.
01:08:00.810 - 01:08:46.370, Speaker D: Chris, I want to open up the conversation to you gave me the line, People don't change. And another topic of conversation, and I'll premise this with the episode coming out on the Bankless podcast after this one is with Anatoli from Salana. And one of the conversations that you and I have had is that ETH versus Salana is the new Bitcoin versus ETH. Whereas in 2018 to 2020, the small young Ethereum community was getting absolutely hazed by the bitcoiners. We could not break out in discourse. We were just getting punched down. None of what we said really stuck with them, but we believed it and so we stuck through.
01:08:46.370 - 01:09:14.014, Speaker D: And I would like to say that history has definitely vindicated us, definitely been on the right side of like, yes, you can run an Ethereum node. It is actually easy to do that no matter what they say. And you said that. Well, the hazing of the Solana community by the Ethereum community is similar. Now, I'd like to throw a flag at that, but I'd like to first hear from you how you see the similarities between these two phases of the crypto cycles here.
01:09:14.132 - 01:09:19.774, Speaker E: Sure. Well, one line that I remember from.
01:09:19.812 - 01:09:29.330, Speaker A: The last podcast with you guys that I liked was the strategy of an underdog is unbecoming once you become a king.
01:09:30.950 - 01:09:36.166, Speaker E: And I think that that progression you.
01:09:36.188 - 01:10:18.430, Speaker A: See also like, if you personify a community. And so it's like when I joined the Bitcoin space, bitcoin was like largely an underdog. Everyone got along, everyone was rowing in a boat together. It's really when Ethereum got circulated as an idea and then launched as a network, that it caused this reaction within bitcoiners who felt like they were better than or whatever. And especially following 17 into the bear of 18 and 19 and BTC held up much better than east did. And then what would become the Bitcoin Maxis. They felt king and queen like and they punched down at Ethereum.
01:10:18.430 - 01:11:23.106, Speaker A: And instead of supporting Ethereum in a time when it could use the support and a lot of people were working to address the things that needed to be addressed, be they like the structuring side of ICOs or scaling Ethereum or developer tooling or whatever. And if you were really paying attention to Ethereum, you saw all these things happening. But then the bitcoin maxi attack was relatively uninformed and kind of fixated on the same handful of tropes. And I think that's also revealing when people have a fixed set of tropes that they just keep going back to, and it's not that compelling. It goes back to that idea of like, it's emotional, it'll get people to be like, rah raha, we got that guy, but it's not intellectually compelling. So that was the Bitcoin maxi against Ethereum folks in 1819.
01:11:23.218 - 01:11:29.820, Speaker E: I would say that Ethereum is more.
01:11:30.430 - 01:11:59.986, Speaker A: Innovation focused than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is very conservative and it has innovated at a social contract level. But some of that innovation at the social contract level requires conservatism in the technology and certainly the supply. And so that's important, I think, of the Bitcoin community as more conservative and the Ethereum community is more progressive. I'm sure there's some Bitcoin maxis that would hate that framing, but because the.
01:12:00.008 - 01:12:02.514, Speaker D: Ethereum community bitcoin Maxis that hate a lot of things.
01:12:02.632 - 01:12:04.482, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. They're going to hate anything.
01:12:04.536 - 01:12:13.270, Speaker E: I say so because of that, I think that Ethereum Maxis or Ethereum supporters.
01:12:13.930 - 01:13:12.214, Speaker A: By and large are a little there's less vitriol. I think the arguments are a little better against Salana. I think that it's a better attack, say, on Salana. And I think some of it is justified, like something that placeholder only. So we studied Salana from the white paper in 2017 onwards, but really only got involved later in 2022. And one of the sticking points for us was what is the concentration of this project? How distributed is ownership? How open access is this network and this asset to as many people as possible and basically lifting as many boats as possible? And I would argue that what Salana.
01:13:12.262 - 01:13:16.426, Speaker E: Went through in late last year, and.
01:13:16.448 - 01:13:52.962, Speaker A: Especially Q Four after the FTX collapse was hugely decentralizing and gave a lot of opportunity to people that hated on Salana for different reasons to support Salana. And then if you approach it purely from a price perspective, you had Salana at 252 60 at the end of 2021, all of a sudden you had Salana at eight to $10, or you had and so, like, the opportunity is very different for someone at eight to $10, and that's open access. The other thing is, if you hated.
01:13:53.026 - 01:13:57.334, Speaker E: Salana for the FTX support, then you.
01:13:57.372 - 01:14:32.046, Speaker A: Can'T hate Salana more because FTX goes down. It's actually like one of the things you hated about Solana was the FTX and Alameda support and structuring. And I agree the Alameda structurings were gross, but now that know a cancer that has been removed. And so something that I see too is when someone is just emotionally committed to hating an ecosystem, it doesn't matter what the ecosystem does to address the problem, they're just going to find a different angle to hate it. And we see this with bitcoin maxi still against Ethereum. They're just like onto the next thing to hate and they're never changing.
01:14:32.078 - 01:14:35.474, Speaker D: Withdrawals will never be unlocked is the new thing, right?
01:14:35.672 - 01:15:25.086, Speaker A: And there's always going to be the next thing. And I see some of that behavior and I certainly saw it in Q Four of 2022 against Salana, where Salana was getting its teeth kicked in. It was down on the floor. A bunch of the things that people claim to hate were getting ripped out of that ecosystem very quickly. Then the opportunity was there and placeholder chose to move in and support it and then other people chose to kick it while it was down. And it's up to you as a person what you want to do. And I can get into more of the substance of the work that led us to move in and support Solana, but just from this maxi kind of phenomenon and what happens when the community is down, that's what I saw happening against Solana.
01:15:25.198 - 01:16:14.654, Speaker C: Uniswap is the largest on chain marketplace for self custody digital assets. Uniswap is of course, a decentralized exchange, but you know this because you've been listening to Bankless. But did you know that the Uniswap web app has a shiny new Fiat onramp? Now you could go directly from Fiat in your bank to tokens in DFI inside of Uniswap. Not only that, but Polygon, Arbitrum and optimism layer Twos are supported right out of the gate, but that's just DFI. Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, letting you find more listings for the best prices across the NFT world. With Uniswap, you can sweep floors on multiple NFTs and Uniswap's universal router will optimize your gas fees for you. Uniswap is making it as easy as possible to go from bank account to bankless assets across Ethereum, and we couldn't be more thankful for having them as a sponsor.
01:16:14.654 - 01:16:57.934, Speaker C: So go to app Uniswap.org today to buy, sell, or swap Tokens and NFTs. Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web3 landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems. With a recent addition of Arbitrum, nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home. Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees.
01:16:57.934 - 01:17:16.166, Speaker C: With Arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro it's also now ten times faster than before. Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum experience. Web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap and friction free.
01:17:16.268 - 01:17:42.062, Speaker B: I think there's an interesting failure mode that I saw with a lot of the kind of and still see with a lot of the bitcoin attacks on ethereum. Bitcoin maxi attacks, let's call them in that whenever they were talking about ethereum, they were trying to do sort of an apples to apples type of comparison, in that you'd ask like, well, why aren't you bullish on ethereum? Well, it doesn't have a 21 million supply cap, right?
01:17:42.196 - 01:17:42.686, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:17:42.788 - 01:18:28.990, Speaker B: And you're like, okay, but the root of that is you want an ossified monetary policy, right? And look how Ethereum is evolving towards that XYZ. You'd respond, yeah, but it's not fixed cap. You're like, well, why does it have to be fixed cap? Right? Isn't the principle of Bitcoin that it should be algorithmic and not up to the discretion of sort of a set of individuals? And here's how Ethereum is getting to that. So what they would constantly try to do is they would try to map, they would try to say, well, this is different than Bitcoin, therefore it's bad. And I very much agree that it's important for open minded people in the Ethereum community to not do that exact same thing to Solana, to be basically like, this is different than Ethereum, therefore it's bad.
01:18:29.140 - 01:18:29.742, Speaker E: Right?
01:18:29.876 - 01:19:36.470, Speaker B: You have to go back further to kind of like the base principles of the thing. And I think you have to recognize that bitcoin is different from Ethereum and that Ethereum is also different from Solana. And you can't say, because it's not exactly like Ethereum, it is not worthwhile. They can be different things in the same place. And that said, Chris, I want you to give kind of the take to an open minded Ethereum advocate right now, because I think there are a lot that actually listen to Bankless, and I think an open minded Ethereum advocate might be like, okay, Chris, give me the pitch then, for Solana from an Ethereum perspective, right? Recognizing that as maybe different. But keep in mind, we've seen the rise and falls of many alternative layer ones that have promised things that have promised things in terms of transactions per second, in terms of kind of link architecture promised to be better than ethereum because of XYZ, and they haven't made it back the next cycle. Where's EOS, for instance, I mean, there's a slew we could kind of mention if you went back in time to the darling ETH killers of 2017 to now.
01:19:36.470 - 01:19:44.280, Speaker B: So what is the case to an open minded Ethereum, let's say, for Salana? What would you say?
01:19:46.010 - 01:20:07.354, Speaker A: Well, I'll approach it first architecturally, which is that Salana's sole focus is consensus at the speed of light and that speed and it's more seconds per transaction. So like the speed or the latency.
01:20:07.402 - 01:20:10.718, Speaker E: At which transactions clear opens up a.
01:20:10.724 - 01:20:19.090, Speaker A: Lot of new use cases that I don't think that Ethereum necessarily needs to solve or is super focused on solving.
01:20:19.830 - 01:20:25.538, Speaker E: And that differentiation is a benefit, I.
01:20:25.544 - 01:21:39.050, Speaker A: Think, to having Sol in your portfolio alongside ETH rather than a detriment. So the more different ecosystems are, the better, from my opinion, because the less overlap they'll have actually in what the builders are doing, even if there's like muck raking and confusion on crypto, Twitter. And so that North Star of consensus at the speed of light. And I would say the focus with which Tolle pursues that reminds me of the focus with which Vitalik pursued expanding the programmability of a blockchain network with a VM, which at the time a lot of people said is silly and won't happen, and there will be, the attack vectors are too vast and all these things. But Vitalik and the team that he gathered around him had the singular focus on it and they did it. I would say that Tolle has a similar singular focus. Another founder that I would see having a singular focus in this way would be Mustafa at Celestia, which is almost on the total opposite side of Solana, but on the data availability and modular stack.
01:21:39.050 - 01:22:44.754, Speaker A: And what's important for me is when I come across these founders who have a singular first principles focus on things, they can debate that thing from a whole bunch of different angles. And you'll see interesting conversation occasionally between even the three that I just mentioned. And they'll all entertain the other's approach and understand it, but have the reasons and the principles for why they have chosen their own approach. And I would say they all recognize that these different approaches have tradeoffs. And it's not like this thing is best for all things. It's more like the system I am designing is optimized in its set of trade offs for use cases that I care about. And like Tully's originating inspiration, I think, aside from just nerding out on blockchains and being a great engineer, was as a daytime trader, feeling like he didn't have equal access to the same latency that everyone else had.
01:22:44.872 - 01:22:47.586, Speaker E: And so Tolle in a way wants.
01:22:47.608 - 01:23:15.580, Speaker A: To give everyone equal access to latency of computation and transaction processing. And that's his goal. And I would say if you gave everyone equal access to latency, then that's the substrate for a much fairer financial field. Now you can make arguments why Ethereum will do that too. And I think that Ethereum is building towards a future like that as well.
01:23:15.950 - 01:23:20.602, Speaker E: The Ethereum future is more layered, right?
01:23:20.656 - 01:23:56.550, Speaker A: L ones, L two S. Now we're talking about L three S. And I would say that and this is where I'm going to step into the developer personality of the different ecosystems. So if I look at Ethereum, it's like a much more rainbows unicorns. Optimistic, let's explore the vast world of what's possible. A lot of it won't work. Some of it will be amazing step change, progress.
01:23:57.390 - 01:24:00.266, Speaker E: And it's also like a kind of.
01:24:00.288 - 01:24:07.980, Speaker A: Like cipher punky meets cosplay environment that speaks to a crypto native, right?
01:24:09.870 - 01:24:11.050, Speaker E: Salana.
01:24:11.470 - 01:25:02.494, Speaker A: And this started to get my attention as I was taking Salana deal flow through 2021. Salana is a lot of web, two folks, a lot of traditional finance folks that wander into Ethereum land and they're like, I don't know what to do with the unicorns and rainbows and who do I talk to? And this just doesn't make sense to me. And then they wander into Solana land and they're ah, this is very like, I know how to build in this environment, I know who to talk to. And I would say even within myself. I originally had an allergic reaction to Solana in that I was, no, no, you're doing this wrong. This isn't like grassroots or organic know, Ethereum is the way to do it. But the thing that I started to notice, solana was able to onboard a lot of these very high caliber people very quickly.
01:25:02.494 - 01:25:55.406, Speaker A: And they found the environment welcoming, right? And then they became attached to it, they wanted to build in it. And that was super interesting to me because it was like, these are high caliber people who want to work within the blockchain landscape, but they actually don't feel at home in Ethereum land and they're finding their home in Solana and then they're sticking like they're staying. They're not like migrating home to home to home. So that started to get my attention. And then I also started to see some people within the Ethereum community that wanted some components of what Solana had, deciding to build on Solana instead of Ethereum. And that also got my attention. There wasn't tons of that, but a good example would be the Orca team.
01:25:55.406 - 01:26:36.106, Speaker A: And Orca Is, I think, one of the best user experiences in all of Crypto. It's an AMM on solana. I think it's every bit as good as Uniswap. And that team. One of the founders was Utaro, who worked as a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, was on the core team at Uma and then decided to build something on Solana. And it's not like he was an Ethereum hater that wanted to prove everyone by working on Solana. He had strong roots within Ethereum and ultimately chose as an engineer who valued some of the things that Solana gave to build on Solana solen team.
01:26:36.106 - 01:27:12.326, Speaker A: I'm not as close with it's a public markets position that we've built, but they also have Ethereum roots. Another Solana team that I work with is vault. And vault is the founders of FanDuel. So FanDuel has as much market share as DraftKings. They've built a massive success consumer app. They know how to do it. They have say, the blueprint for success, and they're choosing to build a dynamic music NFT experience on.
01:27:12.326 - 01:28:10.422, Speaker A: And like, I talked a lot with Nigel, the CEO there at Vault, who is also the CEO at FanDuel, and that's where this really started to unlock for me of, like, he feels welcome and at home within the Salon ecosystem. So you're seeing a lot of that. And then I would encourage everyone to look at electric Capital's developer report from 2022. And I think that one of the headlines there is this is setting aside ethereum and bitcoin, but ecosystems with 1000 plus total developers grew, and this is year over year. Salana grew 83%, polyground grew 40%, cosmos grew 25%, and Polka Dot grew 2%. And so my takeaway from that is, of the ecosystems after bitcoin and ethereum, salana is the biggest, fastest growing ecosystem of developers.
01:28:10.566 - 01:28:13.946, Speaker E: And then one thing I've learned as.
01:28:13.968 - 01:28:15.514, Speaker A: An investor in Crypto over time, and.
01:28:15.552 - 01:28:22.426, Speaker E: We were touching upon this earlier, is I need to sometimes divorce what speaks.
01:28:22.458 - 01:28:50.742, Speaker A: To me most directly, personally, from what will speak to a large group of people, so long as it's still a net positive for the world. So, like a younger, more riled up, more like Cipher punky, bitcoin, ethereum me would be allergic and aggressive towards Solana, right, and say they violated these key tenets of what you're supposed to do to launch a blockchain network. But having gotten to know Tolle and Raj and the team and the people.
01:28:50.796 - 01:28:54.370, Speaker E: Working towards things, my belief is they're.
01:28:54.450 - 01:29:32.706, Speaker A: Working to bring net positive change to the world. And they attract a lot of developers who don't have a home elsewhere within Crypto. And if they continue to do that, then the economy that they create or the systems of production of goods and services are only going to continue to grow. And we've seen that, for example, in their NFT ecosystem, which is second only to Ethereum and which has continued with really great activity through the bear market, right? It's not like all those people have left and the opportunists are all gone. And so it's not even just on the developer base, it's on the user base.
01:29:32.808 - 01:29:35.662, Speaker E: There's a fair amount of stickiness, Chris.
01:29:35.726 - 01:29:42.760, Speaker D: Throughout my history inside of the Ethereum land, once upon a time, I think around maybe around 2019 to 2020.
01:29:44.810 - 01:29:45.078, Speaker E: I.
01:29:45.084 - 01:30:22.226, Speaker D: Was doing my old POV Crypto podcast with my bitcoiner co host. And in the Ethereum world, I was the bitcoiner, if you will, I was the one that was taking in a lot of the bitcoin values and taking it back to the Ethereum community, being like, hey, guys, there's something real here. We should pay attention to attention to that. And I got teased, I was like, jokingly, warmly teased as like, the bitcoin mole inside of the Ethereum camp. And maybe Bankless listeners are like, that doesn't make any sense. David's the biggest ETH maxi of all time. Well, I'd just like to say it's like yo there's a lot of valuable things about bitcoin that I've always wanted to try and instill inside of the ethereum world because there's value there.
01:30:22.226 - 01:31:55.918, Speaker D: And lately it's been a little bit of the opposite, where some other ETH maxis are like, David, why are you giving Solana the time of day? Like, why are you doing this? And to it's? I'm not as convinced as you are, Chris, but to me, it's that if we as ethereum supporters do have the conviction that ethereum is what it is, we should be able to understand why people feel compelled by Solana and still make our like, my argument would be like, all of that was great, Chris. The ethereum layer two, layer three ecosystem can still do consensus at the speed of light. Eventually, the network effects of ethereum will trump over the cultural fit that Salana is happening. Yet I also appreciate and understand that that is a very real corner of the crypto universe, and my convictions as an ethereum person need to not be blinded by what you called my initial toxic reaction towards anything that's not bitcoin or ethereum. And so that's really been my motivation for exploring the Solana ecosystem, to make sure that my biases are in check and I am actually able to make strong, coherent, sober arguments that aren't just like tribal regurgitations. I am worried about tribalism on the Salana side as well, because when any Salana listener just now is like, oh, David, the L2 ecosystem is a failure on ethereum because they're all multi sigs that kind of take vibes. Similarly to me as the bitcoiners saying, you can't run an ethereum full node.
01:31:55.918 - 01:32:25.446, Speaker D: Okay, let's not bet against the arguments or the roadmap of ethereum because ethereum has been able to prove that it does execute on its roadmap given enough time. But what would you say, Chris, to the closed minded ETH maxi who's, like Solana, will never we're again, going back to what has become the theme of this podcast, which is personality, psychology and psychological biases, what would you say to the ethereum crowd about how to approach Solana and other topics?
01:32:25.478 - 01:33:18.326, Speaker A: Like, I think modeling your approach would be perfectly valid, and it's a mature thing to do, and it doesn't mean that you have to go and support Salana wholeheartedly, even if you make the investigation. I guess I want to drill into L two and then salana. And I think that my expectation is like, I expect a lot of L2 s to be a success. We were the first money into ZK Sync. I love the ZK sync team. We don't invest competitively at the venture stage, and so we didn't make the other L2 investments. But I think that there's high quality L2 teams out there outside of Zksync.
01:33:18.326 - 01:34:21.502, Speaker A: And, I mean, clearly already in the numbers they're getting traction. And I agree that it's grading to see Salana folks try and tear down the l Two progress just as it's grading to see the Ethereum maxis try and tear down the Salana progress. And there's hypocrisy everywhere, right? And so then it's just kind of like, okay, we just got to accept that we're flawed humans. But on the idea that L two S will achieve consensus at the speed of light, I think you're correct that it will eventually happen. One thing I've grown to appreciate more is there is a real advantage to being able to provide it months or even years earlier. And if Salana provides consensus at the speed of light years earlier than L two S reliably do, then that's going to get all the people that want the low latency applications to be building.
01:34:21.556 - 01:34:24.830, Speaker E: There or if not all, a majority.
01:34:24.910 - 01:34:32.734, Speaker A: Or enough to make it really sticky. And then the other thing is, because Salana is SVM based and not EVM.
01:34:32.782 - 01:34:37.542, Speaker E: Based, it's not easy to migrate something.
01:34:37.596 - 01:35:05.774, Speaker A: You'Ve built on Salana to something on Ethereum, right? And unless we have SVM so Salana virtual machine L two S that settle into Ethereum, which we will get, actually I expect to see the Salana virtual machine proliferate as an execution environment with different settlement and data availability layers. So that's going to happen. Some people would say, well, that's going to obviate the need for Sol. I don't think so because I think.
01:35:05.812 - 01:35:08.606, Speaker E: That Sol and Solana will remain the.
01:35:08.628 - 01:36:31.382, Speaker A: Canonical chain for SVMs and where a lot of the assets are originated, just as we've seen with Ethereum, right? Like we'll see Ethereum teams go multi chain but the canonical asset stays within the Ethereum contract. And so what I think you'll end up seeing is a lot of loyalty and stickiness at the asset level to Solana as the canonical implementation but then migration of the execution environment to SVMs that sells different settlement and data availability layers. And one thing that placeholders played around with as an idea is the thing that's stickiest for the developer is actually the virtual machine and the developer tools that go around it. And I think there you basically have EVM, SVM and Cosmosm as key environments that you could build towards maybe within Cosmosm I should throw in tendermint. And that ends up being like if you think from a developer perspective, the things that they have to learn and what take them time and it's not just like an easy port. Those can be very sticky.
01:36:31.526 - 01:36:36.300, Speaker E: So I guess in conclusion, I expect.
01:36:36.750 - 01:36:50.640, Speaker A: Ethereum and Solana and Cosmos for that matter, to coexist and to grow together. And I don't think that one has to know to the detriment of another.
01:36:51.090 - 01:37:23.846, Speaker B: Chris, one other just piece on soul token. So there's a difference between value creation, of course, and value capture. And so you could see a world where Salana the blockchain is used quite a lot. But why does it necessarily mean that Sol the token will capture value? I know that Ethereum sort of. Went through ethereum went through this exact same thing. And this is a process, by the way, in 2018, 2019. And just to give folks, basically people are saying, hey, ETH can be used, but ETH doesn't have to be valuable.
01:37:23.846 - 01:38:44.110, Speaker B: And then there was a chant of kind of a layer zero sort of the social community, myself, many others in Ethereum are saying, no, ETH is money and you should value it in the same way that Ethereum is. Yes, there needs to be some hardening of the monetary policy, but it's going to harden anyway. Eventually did harden, but now we get to a place, a triple point asset, right? And by the way, a lot of the triple point asset idea was inspired by something that you brought to crypto's attention, this idea of three asset superclasses, right? I mean, you remember this, right? Commodity and a commodity capital asset. Exactly. Come on, Ryan, I need to go listen to some makeless podcasts again to get my story straight here. But Chris, are you basically predicting that soul the token, will follow the exact same path as Ethereum, or has your view the exact same path as Ether, or has your view shifted on this? Why does Sol, the token need to accrue value? Because right now it's basically, if you look at the economics of it's, bleeding money in that they pay a lot more as a block excuse me, they pay a lot more for block space subsidy than they are generating in terms of block space sales, which is kind of net negative from a profitability perspective. Are you just anticipating that will change in the same way it has for Ether?
01:38:44.270 - 01:39:43.286, Speaker A: Yes, in a single word, yes. I expect there to be an evolution. To elaborate, when I look at Seoul's inflation and Placeholder has like an internal tracker of a bunch of metrics. But Seoul's inflation, I think is 6% annually right now, which is quite low, like from a yielding perspective for the people who are putting up that capital. The reason that's relevant to me is the current annual supply inflation east, like zero to 1%, saya, is like 3%. Salana is 6% and then a bunch of near and flow are more like 20% and Avalanche 222 percent. And that data can always be a little bit off, but I think that's directionally correct.
01:39:43.286 - 01:40:39.900, Speaker A: The reason that's super relevant is, I think, one way that valuations for proof of stake assets are going to find their footing is going to be around these yield rates. And I'm not denying that ETH has the best setup, right, and it's the most mature, but the lower yield it is, that basically implies to me the lower risk, the validator set views the asset as having. And so they will tolerate lower amounts of inflation but continue securing the network. And so that's really key as like an indicator of where this is going. If other networks, say, need to inflate twice or three times as much to keep their validator set engaged. And Salana is inflating way less. So that would be a starting place.
01:40:39.900 - 01:40:59.966, Speaker A: In terms of fees. Again, this is just like the latest. I have 24 hours transaction fees for Salon at about 50K, which is double avalanche, triple file coin, like six, seven x Cosmos Hub 25 x. Yeah, but.
01:40:59.988 - 01:41:03.426, Speaker D: Like 1101 period of and this is.
01:41:03.448 - 01:41:26.086, Speaker A: Where I'm not debating that Ethereum is like a much harder asset at this point in time. I'm more at that place of, like, the indicators or the rates of change are that Solana is going to continue. Solana already is on a path to harden its asset and will continue to do so.
01:41:26.268 - 01:41:50.574, Speaker B: That makes sense. So you're not saying that there's a different science that you're basically applying to Salana. You're saying it's just earlier in the process. Is your thesis definitely way earlier. So, speaking of that, our 2020 episode with you is entitled The Ethereum Opportunity. And you said over the last two and a half years that was your biggest win. Is this like the Salana opportunity to you? Is it like, equivalent to Ethereum in 2022?
01:41:50.772 - 01:41:58.626, Speaker A: Similar, yeah. I think if I had to pick an ecosystem that's contentious and that you.
01:41:58.648 - 01:42:01.474, Speaker E: Should pay attention to, and in its.
01:42:01.512 - 01:43:13.706, Speaker A: Contentiousness, it's undervalued, it would be Solana placeholder. Each bear market tends to pick an ecosystem or two and build an aircraft carrier strategy around that ecosystem. And so the last bear, it was ETH and bitcoin because those were really the only things at scale and liquid enough to justify and then what I mean by aircraft carrier, if you take ethereum, buy a bunch of the core ETH asset, but then venture invest around it and really get to know that ecosystem and who all the people are that are working on, say, at that point in time lending or DEXs or asset management or whatever. And then you can pick the best teams or the teams that most speak to you from a venture perspective. We're doing that exact same aircraft carrier strategy around Cosmos and Solana right now. And what I'm seeing, and I would say that the three most exciting innovation environments for me that I also see materializing in user adoption and growth are Ethereum, Cosmos, Solana. And I think that if you talk with a lot, it depends on who you talk with.
01:43:13.706 - 01:43:32.790, Speaker A: But generally, objective analyzers of the ecosystem, I would say, would largely agree with that assessment. The difference, though, is Solana valuations are, at least at the venture stage, much lower than Ethereum and Cosmos.
01:43:32.890 - 01:43:41.170, Speaker E: So right now, Ethereum deals, venture deals are five to ten x.
01:43:41.320 - 01:44:36.290, Speaker A: What I underwrote things in 2018 and 19 in terms of the starting seed or Series A valuation. And what that means is if something goes 30 x total for a VC, but it's marked ten x higher, I get a three x instead of a 30 x. And so it starts to actually just not even fit my return profile or, like, what I'm aspiring for. But salana valuations at the venture stage are basically exactly where Ethereum valuations were in 18 and 19. And it's one of those, like, deja vu repeat things where I'm like, this is priced at what, and there's no competition for this deal, and the team is this high caliber. It just kind of blows my mind. And so one that your users could check out would be Tensor Trade.
01:44:36.290 - 01:44:52.310, Speaker A: That's an NFT platform, pro trading platform. Probably the closest analog would be blur within Ethereum. This is built by two guys. They've built the whole thing. They've never raised money. They're solana nerds. They love the network.
01:44:52.310 - 01:45:16.640, Speaker A: You can follow them. It's Richard and Ilya. They're so about optimizing the front end to match the speed of the salana back end. And it reminds me of the type of grit and passion that I ran into with Ethereum teams in 1819 who just no one was paying attention, and there weren't, like, dozens of VCs all around clambering for around or.
01:45:18.370 - 01:45:19.118, Speaker E: Touting a.
01:45:19.124 - 01:45:42.090, Speaker A: Bunch of over promises, let's say. And so from the venture perspective, solana is fruitful ground for me. I'm also doing a lot of work within Cosmos. I would say that Cosmos is a more consensus investment ecosystem at this point, though. And so valuations for Cosmos are somewhere between Solana and Ethereum at the private stage.
01:45:42.510 - 01:45:50.940, Speaker D: Well, Chris, I think in addition to being the Bankless podcast with the most words coconut in it, it's also the Bankless podcast with the most words solana in it as well.
01:45:52.750 - 01:45:57.180, Speaker B: No, we already have I think we just said solana one know.
01:45:58.050 - 01:46:05.060, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I think I said earlier this call I had, like, a slip. I said, like.
01:46:08.470 - 01:46:15.780, Speaker D: Yeah, that definitely printed my brain, too. Solling, you would say soling instead of selling is what you.
01:46:19.050 - 01:46:53.426, Speaker B: So, Chris, this has been a lot of know. Thanks for spending so much time with us today. I guess question as we're kind of closing, this is for you to zoom out and look at crypto, because I know, in addition to price appreciation and investment over the years, because I heard you speak so many times, I just know a little bit about your value set. It's important to you that crypto is a net good for the world as well, not just that we all make a lot of money. I mean, that's cool. Everyone wants to do that. But I think you're here as well because you actually think crypto is going to bring about a positive force in the world.
01:46:53.426 - 01:47:02.098, Speaker B: My question to you is, have we achieved that yet? Is crypto a net good, and are we on track to achieve that?
01:47:02.184 - 01:47:05.640, Speaker E: If not, I would say that the.
01:47:06.250 - 01:47:38.160, Speaker A: Blockchains as an open data substrate that allow for verifiable computation inevitably make it such that this will be a net good for the world. And then it's up to the builders and the investors and the early participants to kind of dial the knob to maximum impact versus minimum impact within this net good substrate. And what I mean by that is.
01:47:38.690 - 01:47:39.918, Speaker E: And this goes back to a lot.
01:47:39.924 - 01:49:19.786, Speaker A: Of placeholders original thesis summary, which people can find online. But if you look at how Web Two is currently architected that's proprietary code and proprietary data, and it's the new digital Fiefdom, and we all labor for King Zuck, and King Zuck makes all the rules, and we just take it and we have no control or governance rights against and you know you either toil on his land know, go elsewhere don't exist and we spend so much time in digital worlds that we can't exist on all these monarchies. We've gone through this from a social evolution standpoint already and blockchains as this open data substrate also allow for governance forms that are much more democratic, that are of the people, by the people, for the people. And so all the promise and tooling is there to allow us to do that. Now, it was a very messy process to go from monarchies to democracies, right, like lots of revolutions, lots of turmoil, lots of dictators that were way worse than the old monarchs and really just took advantage of the system or took that period of disruption and used it to their own personal advantage. And so we're going to get that. We're going to get more lunas, we'll get more three ACS.
01:49:19.786 - 01:50:05.998, Speaker A: We'll get those things that make me not want to associate and distance myself from crypto in the next scam. Rally let's call it in a few years time, following the conviction rally but the substrate will remain bitcoin will continue producing blocks and issuing supply according to its social contract. As will Ethereum. As will Solana. As will Cosmos. And what's great is each bear market we get to reset by and large, the opportunists leave and we can reassess the current state of things. And I love crypto most each bear market because I look around and I'm like, wow, there's way more cool people here and neat things being built.
01:50:05.998 - 01:51:13.250, Speaker A: And we're having all the conversations I wish we had been having in the bull market, but at least we're having them, right? And even if you look at Salana, it was having a lot of conversation at the depths of Q four 2022 about ownership, right, and how to structure community tokens so that they weren't predatory like Alameda. Those were things that Ethereum folks were rightfully calling out salana folks on in 2021, but that the Salana folks didn't want to hear it then, but a year later it was being addressed. And so I take heart in the fact that those things are being addressed. I, weirdly, am most optimistic about crypto in bear markets and most pessimistic about it in bull markets just because of the social dynamics that we've discussed at length here, but this will inevitably be for greater good. And it's incumbent upon each of us to turn the dial towards maximum impact as opposed maximum societal impact as opposed to maximum personal impact.
01:51:14.070 - 01:51:35.706, Speaker D: Well, Chris, I definitely was going through my 2018 2020 bear market, my first real bear market, thinking the entire time, it's like, man, if only the bull market would arrive. If only the bull market would arrive. And then that feeling then the bull market arrived and that good feeling of like, yes, the bull market is here, lasted for about three months. And then I realized, oh, no, what am I getting myself into?
01:51:35.808 - 01:51:36.506, Speaker A: What have we done?
01:51:36.528 - 01:52:00.302, Speaker D: And now what have we like now? I look back on the last bull market and it's like, that one meme with the Chihuahua looking at the Vietnam like helicopters, like, flying overhead. I'm like, oh, that was awful. I'm so glad I'm back in a bear market. And so I'm definitely a cycle behind you and I appreciate all of your mentorship and leadership as we're exploring the frontier of crypto.
01:52:00.446 - 01:52:01.378, Speaker E: For sure.
01:52:01.544 - 01:52:10.566, Speaker A: I appreciate you guys putting out good information on widening variety of networks. I think it's good growth for Bankless itself.

01:52:56.302 - 01:53:06.738, Speaker B: So that's a good cause as well. The auction for that NFT episode happens at 03:00 p.m. On Eastern. So we'll see you there. Risks and disclaimers got to end with this. None of this has been financial advice.
01:53:06.834 - 01:53:07.842, Speaker E: Crypto is risky.
