00:00:07.050 - 00:00:10.254, Speaker A: Hey, guys. Happy first week of December. David, what time is it?
00:00:10.292 - 00:00:24.094, Speaker B: Oh, it's a Friday weekly roll up time, Ryan, where we roll up the entire week in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we do it anyways because we have a ton of fun doing it, and I hope you do as well. So grab your morning coffee because we are about to roll up the week.
00:00:24.212 - 00:00:32.822, Speaker A: It is fun. Well, look, crypto is never boring, guys, so you know this. How was your thanksgiving, by the way? Was that fun to get any crypto conversations in?
00:00:32.876 - 00:00:49.018, Speaker B: Oh, inevitably. Just like I said at the last part of last week's episode is like everyone talks about crypto because that's one person in the room is the known crypto person and no one knows what crypto is, so they always got to ask about crypto. So yes, that did indeed happen.
00:00:49.184 - 00:01:09.890, Speaker A: Guys, we are going to get into the main event of the week. First of all, Budweiser beer company buys beer Eth, and now they're prominently displaying it on their twitter page. It's an NFT more to come. Maybe Jack Dorsey just stepped down from Twitter. David, what does this mean for crypto? We're going to dig into that. Also. All eyes on the ETH bitcoin ratio ratio talk.
00:01:09.960 - 00:01:11.422, Speaker B: Give me hot and flustered.
00:01:11.486 - 00:01:25.030, Speaker A: I know you're excited about that one. All right. That's why we'll get to it first. And also the ethereum roadmap refresh. Of course, there's a ton of other things we're going to cover in the weekly roll up. You do not want to miss it. Try to jam pack this into the next hour or so.
00:01:25.030 - 00:01:25.958, Speaker A: 90 minutes.
00:01:26.044 - 00:01:27.606, Speaker B: 90 minutes. We'll see if we can do 90 minutes.
00:01:27.628 - 00:01:45.422, Speaker A: No promises on the hour. But before we do, got to mention permissionless conference. So you know this conference is coming in May. This is happening in Florida. So if you're in the cold weather climate, you want to get down to Florida, you're thinking of it. This is going to be the crypto conference of the year, at least the Defi conference of the year. We're going to be there.
00:01:45.422 - 00:02:05.214, Speaker A: Our friends at blockworks are putting this on. We let you know now because new tickets just went on sale. New tranche every two weeks. New tranche goes on sale. Price gets more every goes up every week. It's up only. So if you want a bankless discount on that, you can become a premium subscriber and go get your permissionless tickets.
00:02:05.214 - 00:02:16.582, Speaker A: We will see you there in the new year. I think, David, you got probably like four or five conferences in between now and that one. But that's going to be a highlight of next year for sure.
00:02:16.716 - 00:02:23.990, Speaker B: At some point, the yearly subscription to bankless is actually going to pay for itself because of the 30% off that it gets you off this ticket.
00:02:24.070 - 00:02:25.126, Speaker A: We might be close, dude.
00:02:25.158 - 00:02:44.586, Speaker B: Yeah, right. So, like Ryan said, you can sign up for bankless, get a 30% off discount. But the sooner you get that ticket, the cheaper it's going to be, because no one wants to be paying to have the April of 2022 FoMo, where the tickets are over $1,000 apiece. Get them now. While they're like 400 something in crypto.
00:02:44.618 - 00:03:01.634, Speaker A: You never want to delay things, right? Just ape in, guys. Ape into that conference. Also, we want to mention our friends at Metamask. They are sponsoring this message. I use Metamask all the time. David, I know you are a power user of metamask. The safest way to use metamask is with a hardware wallet.
00:03:01.634 - 00:03:40.910, Speaker A: So a ledger wallet is one good option. Also, lattice metamask has recently added support for the lattice wallet, which is a hyper secure hardware wallet, sits right in your desk. Beautiful user interface. Also, another wallet called Keystone, which provides a air gapped QR code based hardware wallet. So what metamask is doing right now is really doubling down on its wallet support, which is a perfect complement because you want to use metamask, but you want to use it in a safe and secure way. If you've used Ledger and metamask before, there's some bumps. It hasn't always worked perfectly in some of the browsers like Chrome.
00:03:40.910 - 00:04:12.314, Speaker A: Ledger and metamask are partnering to iron out those issues, and they've just released a whole bunch of releases. So the action item here, if you don't have metamask, you want to portal into web3, go download Metamask. There's a link in the show notes. If you haven't used metamask with a wallet before, then try it. It is the most secure, safe way to experience web3 to date. You can get into DFI use it all of the time, so check that out. There is a link in the show notes to Metamask, and you can find out more about it.
00:04:12.352 - 00:04:58.982, Speaker B: All right, guys, the last piece of housekeeping, Gitcoin round twelve has officially kicked off, kicked off on December 1. We all know Gitcoin rounds. They are the times where we can all donate towards these up and coming projects that need that support. But the cool thing about Gitcoin is that there is this massive matching pool so when you come and donate to projects and upstarts and different things that need your support, client teams, different defi apps that are just getting up and running, your donations are matched, but they are not matched linearly. They are matched quadratically. We've had Kevin Owawaki on the show before to talk about quadratic matching. Basically, if you are donating to the same grants that many, many other individuals are also donating to, those individuals have outsized matching from this supply matching pool.
00:04:58.982 - 00:05:29.026, Speaker B: There's also the brand new pool of crypto advocacy. All funding efforts to advocate for Crypto on Capitol Hill. We just had a two part panel yesterday on bankless. Came out on the podcast yesterday. It's also on the YouTube, where we had some just big heavy hitters, Jake Stravinsky, Jerry Britto, Brian Quintens, Kristen from the Blockchain Association, a number of other people to really kick off this brand new advocacy round. So if you want to move the needle in Capitol Hill, go to Gitcoin Co. Check out the Gitcoin rounds.
00:05:29.026 - 00:05:36.034, Speaker B: Twelve matching round. Check out the crypto advocacy track and donate to some really cool projects on Gitcoin.
00:05:36.162 - 00:05:43.738, Speaker A: Yeah, crypto advocacy is where it's at. Man, didn't you guys like, didn't get coin? Isn't there like $800,000 over 900,000 now?
00:05:43.824 - 00:05:47.274, Speaker B: 900,000 just for the crypto advocacy round? There's that.
00:05:47.312 - 00:05:58.670, Speaker A: Crypto advocacy, that's crazy. Crypto lobbying, this is something that we need to do. Crypto is political, whether we like it or not. So we have to get involved that way. David, let's talk about prices, though. Okay. It's market time.
00:05:58.670 - 00:06:00.960, Speaker A: Yeah. Bitcoin price. What?
00:06:01.890 - 00:06:14.930, Speaker B: Bitcoin flat on the week. A little bit up on the week. Started the week at $54,000, hit a high of $59,000, currently at $57,000, up about 3% on the week.
00:06:15.080 - 00:06:18.478, Speaker A: Okay, flat week. Okay, how about ETH? How's ETH tracking?
00:06:18.574 - 00:06:37.946, Speaker B: ETH doing great. Started the week at $4,400, hit a low of $4,000 right at the bottom of that COVID Omicron scare, which we're going to talk about, but then hit a high of $4,780 and is now clocking in at $4,500 right now and currently is up 8% on the week.
00:06:38.128 - 00:06:52.750, Speaker A: Okay. Bitcoin flat, but ETH going up. That has some ripple effects. That means all eyes continue to be on the ETH bitcoin ratio because that is doing things, things we haven't seen in a while. Tell us about the ratio story here.
00:06:52.820 - 00:07:32.030, Speaker B: Yeah, so the ratio hit a new high for the first time in over three years. And so hit that full chart for you, Ryan. The ratio started the week at zero 75 and hit a high of 83 and is currently coming in at zero eight overall, up 8% on the week. And again, we have not seen these levels of the ETH BTC ratio since 2017, or maybe late 2018, February. It looks February of 2018 when the ETH BTC ratio hits new highs. To me, this is what I tweeted out, and I think my tweet is next. Ryan.
00:07:32.030 - 00:08:09.610, Speaker B: The ETH BTC ratio is the bull market signal. When ETH goes up versus bitcoin, it's a signal of the bull market is ongoing, not necessarily prescriptive of future returns. Right. We can't predict the future, but really, when ETH goes up versus BTC, it's a signal of the bull market and making new highs. I'm saying that I think this is going to indicate a stronger continuation of the bull market into the future. A lot of the ETH people, myself included, are talking about, man, if the ETH BTC ratio can just jump from, like, 0.8 to zero one, the flipping becomes real close.
00:08:09.610 - 00:08:34.754, Speaker B: There is very little price discovery in bitcoin terms above these levels. Right now, breaking a three year all time high is a really big deal. And there's not much more left before ether actually breaks the complete and full all time high, which it's just like, in a flash of a pan claimed in 2017 at, like, zero, I think. But it's a long time coming.
00:08:34.872 - 00:09:08.426, Speaker A: There's two things that jump out at me from this chart that we're looking at, which is the ETH bitcoin ratio. The first is we haven't been at this point in the ratio for very many days either, right? Because when in 2017, the ratio spiked above where it is right now, that was relatively brief. We're talking days, right? And then also in the end of 2018, when it did as well, that was days as well. I don't know how many days we've actually been above the ratio we are.
00:09:08.448 - 00:09:10.990, Speaker B: Right now, but not very much at all.
00:09:11.140 - 00:09:34.158, Speaker A: 16, 1718, less than a month in terms of days. So that's pretty remarkable. The other remarkable thing about this chart, David, is look at this trough, this trough of dissolutionment between the end of 2018 and, I guess, the end of 2020, where it was like bitcoin season. It was like bitcoin map.
00:09:34.174 - 00:09:38.366, Speaker B: Bitcoiners were like, down. Everything is down only versus bitcoin that's what they said.
00:09:38.408 - 00:10:18.334, Speaker A: And that was the narrative. And I think the thing about narratives is a lot of people sort of get biased by the most recent narrative and sort of project that, extrapolate that forward. And so because that was the most popular narrative, everything was bleeding against bitcoin. The idea was nothing aside from bitcoin would ever appreciate or ever retain value. So what's interesting is the long, I guess, crawl through this trench, this trough of disillusionment, and then the spike up, right. We are well above where we were. And this feels like, I guess what I'm saying is it's a strong recovery on the bitcoin ratio.
00:10:18.334 - 00:10:22.930, Speaker A: So this is primed to do something and possibly continue increasing.
00:10:23.350 - 00:10:54.814, Speaker B: I hate that you're making me look at this chart. Can you click on my tweet so we can have, like, a real chart to look at? There we go. So look at that. Look at that. So, for the listeners, if you grow and just zoom all the way out from 2016 to 2022, where we are now, it is a solid upwards trend. It went up real fast from 2016 to 2017 and 18, because that's when ether had this very early ico mania that was completely unsustainable. And then that just flash just leveled off for the next two years.
00:10:54.814 - 00:11:24.070, Speaker B: But after that, in 2020, it started to climb again. And overall, it has been painting this very up into this right trend versus bitcoin its entire lifespan. And this is why people were talking about the flipping before Ethereum actually had its first block mined. Some people read the Ethereum white paper and they were like, oh, yeah, this is going to flip in bitcoin. No one will tell you when because no one actually knows. The ethbTC trading pair is extremely hard to trade and predict. But damn, does this chart just look good.
00:11:24.070 - 00:11:38.058, Speaker B: Ryan, I did some ta. Actually, I'm not really much of a TA person, but if you want to go onto the tweet that I followed this up at, you can just exit out of this picture and then scroll down. I did some ta. There it is. Yeah, it's a solid green arrow professional to the right.
00:11:38.144 - 00:11:42.966, Speaker A: This is fantastic. This is the kind of quality Ta that bankless subscribers sign up for here.
00:11:43.008 - 00:11:53.706, Speaker B: That's exactly right. So I actually counted the number of weeks that ether has been higher in bitcoin terms. Twelve weeks. Only twelve weeks of price history out of Ethereum's, like, six years of existence.
00:11:53.738 - 00:11:55.102, Speaker A: Has the ratio ever been higher?
00:11:55.156 - 00:11:57.002, Speaker B: Has the ratio between bitcoin and ether?
00:11:57.066 - 00:12:24.938, Speaker A: Okay, there wasn't days it was weeks. It was probably three months or so. But how big would this be if this has never happened in history? Just like why we're talking about this so much is bitcoin has never been flippant in the history of bitcoin. It is the OG coin. And so if this does happen, you can expect not just people like us, not just crypto media, and people know crypto Twitter and in these circles will be talking about it. The entire world will be talking about it.
00:12:25.024 - 00:12:35.210, Speaker B: The entire world knows bitcoin as crypto. But when something else takes the number one spot, people will reconsider what it means to be crypto.
00:12:35.370 - 00:12:54.260, Speaker A: Absolutely. So that will ripple out, and I think that's definitely something to watch. David, we are preparing some of our predictions for 2022 as well. I know on bankless we're going to publish this toward the end of the month. I'm wondering if one of your predictions is going to be a flipping in 2022. Are you going to call that?
00:12:55.510 - 00:13:19.274, Speaker B: I think it's a greater than 50% chance. Yeah, so do I. Yeah, so do I. It's really hard to have conviction about the ETH BTC ratio because like I said, people that trade the ETH BTC ratio generally just get absolutely worked. It's one of the hardest things to trade in crypto. And predicting the flipping is also really hard. But, man, are we really predicting when.
00:13:19.312 - 00:13:34.030, Speaker A: It'S going to happen is the hard part. Right? Yes. It's like, okay, well, if you predict it, I will say I'm not so sure, and I won't predict it. And that way one of us is right. And that way bankless is always right. That's why there's two of us. Well, let's talk about the DPi.
00:13:34.030 - 00:13:50.790, Speaker A: Let's talk about DFI pulse and total locked value in DFI. That's at 108,000,000,000. So we're still above 100 billion. That's feeling pretty good. That's feeling healthy, too. How about the DFI pulse index? Here's a seven day view. It didn't have the week that ether did.
00:13:50.860 - 00:13:58.474, Speaker B: No, it's down a little bit versus the dollar. It started at 360, ended at 330.
00:13:58.672 - 00:14:00.086, Speaker A: Still not DFI season.
00:14:00.198 - 00:14:06.570, Speaker B: I'm curious about your predictions for abstaining from any DPI related.
00:14:07.310 - 00:14:14.406, Speaker A: Look at that chart. The DPI to ETH index. Okay, so this is another ratio that we track on bankless roll ups.
00:14:14.438 - 00:14:15.214, Speaker B: Tracking it.
00:14:15.332 - 00:14:27.714, Speaker A: DPI to ETH. Man, we have to look, you can't be mad about this. I know you're an ETH bull. You can't be mad about this. Why does this ratio bring you so much pain, David? First, what is it? Yeah, I'm going to make you say it.
00:14:27.832 - 00:14:56.490, Speaker B: This is the ratio between the aggregate of Defi tokens and ether. Not all DeFi tokens. Kind of the OG defi tokens maker, Uniswap, sushiswap, and just DeFi has just not been catching a bid versus Ether. Ether is ultrasound money, and DFI tokens are not. And people are really just believing in that difference. I guess we are clocking in at zero 74. I believe it was zero eight last week.
00:14:56.560 - 00:15:15.054, Speaker A: I guess we did our ultrasound money job, too. Well, David, that's why this is happening. But here's a sure way to win, is you bet on all three. A little bit of bitcoin, a little bit of eth, a little bit of DPI, a third, a third, a third. And that forms the bed index. So what are we looking at on bed on the week here?
00:15:15.092 - 00:15:21.954, Speaker B: Yeah. Started last week at $177. Ended this week at roughly $165. So a little bit down on the.
00:15:21.992 - 00:15:45.162, Speaker A: Week, a little bit down on bed. That is a secure way to get exposure into the crypto monies. And also, defi each have their seasons, right? Sometimes there's bitcoin season. Sometimes there's ETH season. Sometimes it's defi season. And the bankless bed index allows you to get exposure to all three of those things. Let's talk a little bit more about thanksgiving, though.
00:15:45.162 - 00:16:06.722, Speaker A: Right? So this is a chart from blockworks, actually. I think maybe crypto.com is the source of this. And they said, show this chart to your crypto skeptical family members. This is a chart of 1990s Internet adoption, David. So it's Internet versus crypto. And there's a green line and a blue line.
00:16:06.722 - 00:16:48.960, Speaker A: The green line is Internet users over time, tracking from, like, 1990 to the year 2000. And the blue line is total crypto users. These are both measured in millions. And what's interesting is the blue line is tracking the green line right on top of it. It's right on top of it. So what this is saying is, like, something that we've said a lot, is crypto is the Internet of money, and it is tracking the adoption of the Internet in the way the Internet spread in the 1990s. I think this is a useful way to help your family understand crypto, to be honest, because everyone lived through the.
00:16:48.960 - 00:17:27.882, Speaker A: Maybe not everyone, but lots of people remember the Internet transformation and what that looked like. And so if you're looking for an analogy, you just say, look, crypto is the Internet of money, and it is getting adopted like the Internet was. Remember how fast that happened? Remember how much transformation occurred as a result of that? Well, crypto is going to do that except for scarce things, property, things, money, in different way. I think it's a useful analogy to help people understand it. And it's interesting that the numbers are tracking. But when we were talking about this agenda, David, you were also a little bit disappointed at this graph, right? Right.
00:17:27.936 - 00:17:41.790, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, I want crypto to be adopted faster than the Internet because crypto is on top of the Internet and the Internet's already been adopted. So when I see crypto being adopted at the same rate of the Internet, I'm like, God, why are we so slow? Let's pick up the pace.
00:17:42.370 - 00:18:15.914, Speaker A: What is taking so long? Why do you think it's taking so long? So, first of all, this makes me hyper bullish. To get to this point in crypto is frankly amazing, right? We live through the Internet. To have a second revolution that was on the same order of magnitude as the Internet is just incredible. This is beyond my wildest dreams and super excited about this. Very bullish about this. But to your point, crypto had the Internet to propagate itself, so why is it not propagating faster? What do you think is holding crypto back?
00:18:15.952 - 00:18:46.786, Speaker B: When you look at this, not only did it have the Internet, but also had the financial incentive to adopt it like crypto pays you to adopt it. So where is the juice? Where's the steroids? I kind of always thought the crypto would be the Internet just on steroids. Granted, we are not, like, disrupting the Internet. We're disrupting legacy financial institutions. And people seem to be a lot more skeptical about crypto than they were the Internet. And maybe that's because the nature of crypto has the nature of money inside of it. People generally are skeptical with value.
00:18:46.786 - 00:18:51.078, Speaker B: They're like, oh, buy bitcoin. Like, oh, you're just trying to take my money. Do you know?
00:18:51.164 - 00:19:27.762, Speaker A: One take here, though, is I don't think the, look, the Internet, the institutions adopted the Internet almost immediately, right? The US policy was pro Internet. Corporate policy was like, we have to go on the Internet. We have to dot coms, all of these things. I think crypto has been, interestingly enough, more a bottom up movement in some ways than the Internet. What I mean is like, established institutions haven't seen the value proposition, right? The banking industry adopted the Internet, but the banking industry has been super slow to adopt crypto. Why? Because they're being disrupted by crypto. Right.
00:19:27.762 - 00:19:44.950, Speaker A: Even, like, extrapolate that to governments and central banks. Maybe they're also worried that they're going to be adopted by crypto. So we haven't had the institutional support that legacy institutional support that the Internet has had. What's your take on that? And what else do you think is holding us back?
00:19:45.020 - 00:20:12.126, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. The fact that it's a bottom up system, I think, also lends itself to why it could have been adopted faster, because bottom up systems are just, like, organic, and nature is really good at spreading. Granted, this is a log scale, and so deviations are actually really compressed in this chart, but, like, damn, are those lines right on top of each other? At some point, I don't really know. We'll just have to wait for it to figure itself out.
00:20:12.228 - 00:20:13.582, Speaker A: The story is not over.
00:20:13.636 - 00:20:22.878, Speaker B: But basically what I'm saying is, like, I'm bullish. I just wanted to be hyper bullish, and I can only be bullish. I wish I was more bullish.
00:20:23.054 - 00:20:37.414, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah. That's spoken like somebody who's gotten used to a lot of bullishness lately. I think you're spoiled, sir. You are spoiled. Let's talk about this Omnicron. What is this?
00:20:37.452 - 00:20:39.000, Speaker B: This is a story of.
00:20:39.530 - 00:20:59.182, Speaker A: Okay, Omicron, this is a COVID variant. Maybe you should explain that. It did kind of tank the markets a little bit, both stock markets and crypto. Okay, so let's talk about that. And then also, we're seeing, like, meme tokens number go up as a result, which I don't understand. What's the story here?
00:20:59.236 - 00:21:04.746, Speaker B: Yeah, so the Omicron variant was discovered in South America. It's apparently a new variant.
00:21:04.858 - 00:21:06.066, Speaker A: South Africa, right?
00:21:06.168 - 00:21:26.790, Speaker B: Yeah, South Africa. And apparently more transmissible, apparently more contagious. We don't really know. There's not a lot of data out there. But the markets just read the headlines, new COVID variant, and just got super, super spooked. And I was just so dumbfounded by this market reaction because it happened in the legacy markets, it also happened in crypto. And I'm like, guys, we've seen this story before.
00:21:26.790 - 00:21:47.310, Speaker B: First off, we're way more prepared. We already know what Covid is. We already have vaccines. We already have testing centers. We already have global mask adoption by some people. And so why are people scared about another COVID variant? The way that Covid is going to work is just. It's going to just morph into the common cold, and we're going to get a bunch of booster shots over and over and over again.
00:21:47.310 - 00:22:04.580, Speaker B: This is how this works. So new variants are totally to be expected and then the markets dumped as if it was going to be pandemic 2.0 all over again. Forgetting about the last time the markets dumped, we just printed a bunch of money. Like the whole market reaction was totally nonsensical to me and so many people got really, really bearish. I just did not get it.
00:22:05.030 - 00:22:06.302, Speaker A: I was not bearish.
00:22:06.446 - 00:22:30.554, Speaker B: I was not bearish in a slightest. I tweeted out like, if you sold the Omacron variant news, slap yourself, we're going to ten k. And then people followed up like, david, no, we're going to 20k. I'm like, oh yeah, you're right. And meanwhile this completely unrelated but also interesting part of the story is there's this random token that I had no idea existed called Omacron and it pumped like 200% because of the Omacron variant.
00:22:30.602 - 00:22:36.080, Speaker A: Is this a token that existed pre Omicron variant? It was just like through.
00:22:37.810 - 00:23:08.226, Speaker B: Was just a coincidence of the names and it just started pumping. And I think this is kind of just a small little microcosm of just the state of the world at large. People just like to invest in memes like, oh, the word omicron is in the news. Let me go to Coingecko, type in Omicron and buy the first token that comes up. Fundamentals just don't matter for a decent portion of the population anymore. And so welcome to the meme economy. The words that are in the news are going to be turned into tokens that are going to pump.
00:23:08.226 - 00:23:13.478, Speaker B: We saw this with doge, it's the meme economy. Welcome to the meme economy.
00:23:13.574 - 00:23:22.686, Speaker A: So do you think this is going to happen with other news items and other kind of memes that propagate? They're all going to have tokens that will temporarily pump because traders are going.
00:23:22.688 - 00:23:28.458, Speaker B: To be like, oh, the word Omicron is in the news a bunch. I'm going to go buy the Omicron token because other people are thinking of the word omicron.
00:23:28.554 - 00:23:34.910, Speaker A: What is Omicron? It doesn't even matter originally. Yeah, well, good job.
00:23:34.980 - 00:23:35.754, Speaker B: Sorry. To the Omicron.
00:23:35.802 - 00:23:53.654, Speaker A: Omicron. Yeah, Omicron users, you just got your payday there. That was a lucky event. Let's talk about this too. CRO token has been on an absolute tear. This is crypto dot com's Kronos chain token. It's just locked up.
00:23:53.654 - 00:24:02.282, Speaker A: 1 billion total locked value token has jumped 350%. Crypto.com has recently, I believe, gotten naming rights for a major sports arena, too.
00:24:02.336 - 00:24:04.426, Speaker B: That might be part of part of.
00:24:04.448 - 00:24:25.870, Speaker A: This, but this chain seems to me very much like kind of a proof of stake binance type chain from a crypto bank, right? Kind of eTh killer or sidechain, whatever your perspective is on that. And it's very much sidechain season, I guess, EtH killer season. So we're seeing a pump here. Anything else?
00:24:25.940 - 00:24:37.958, Speaker B: That proof of consensus mechanism even. Okay, so it's not even proof. They must not be doing any sort of decentralization theater unlike the other ones. You're like, oh, yeah, no, this is like a consortium blockchain. We own this thing, I got to be honest.
00:24:38.044 - 00:24:52.140, Speaker A: So I understand CRO token as sort of a loyalty token if you're a crypto.com user, right. And that does have some value, but its value as it relates to this side chain, I don't really understand.
00:24:52.910 - 00:25:07.134, Speaker B: It's just to be in the club in my mind, like, oh, people are building chains and issuing tokens. Like, oh, we have the crypto.com URL, we can do the same thing. And the URL, the value of the URL can sustain the whole entire ecosystem. That's what's in my mind. What's happening.
00:25:07.252 - 00:25:08.286, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
00:25:08.468 - 00:25:12.160, Speaker B: In my mind, that entire business is just centered around the.
00:25:13.890 - 00:25:25.742, Speaker A: I mean, they are doing a lot in the space. They have partnerships with visa. I've actually used a crypto.com card. Like, it works, it's cool. But it's kind of an example of sort of a crypto bank.
00:25:25.806 - 00:25:30.066, Speaker B: Play on this, in my mind, is co opting crypto.
00:25:30.178 - 00:25:56.778, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a little. Definitely. I hear that too. Let's talk about eth a little bit. So this is a tweet from Chris Clay says so. ETH has surpassed every global bank's market cap and you're still not sure if this whole blockchain crypto thing is here to stay. This is a chart of ETH versus JPMorgan versus bank of America versus ICBC and Wells Fargo and CM bank and all the banks that you love to hate.
00:25:56.778 - 00:26:11.986, Speaker A: Ethereum is on top with 550,000,000,000. The next closest is JPMorgan with 480,000,000,000. At this point, I feel like calling it too, right? Like, guys, wake up to Ethereum. Crypto is bigger than all of the.
00:26:12.088 - 00:26:13.570, Speaker B: You feel like calling it, Ryan?
00:26:14.630 - 00:26:27.618, Speaker A: I'm just, you know, I felt like this for a suppose, David. But like, yeah, this is now. It's self evident. Now it's like maybe, maybe I'm at the point of a zen where I don't even feel like I have to explain this anymore.
00:26:27.634 - 00:26:29.386, Speaker B: Exasperation by people who don't get it.
00:26:29.408 - 00:26:48.378, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just like, okay, well, explain this chart then, rather than me explain crypto. How about you explain why Ethereum market cap is larger than all the banks? Start from there. Explain that, right? And then we'll have a discussion about it. I feel like a bit more like that. Maybe it's vindication that I'm feeling.
00:26:48.474 - 00:27:10.518, Speaker B: I won't be satisfied until Ethereum market cap is bigger than all the banks combined. And then we can say that ether is undervalued, just not misunderstood. Like, oh, people now understand. Now it's in the realm of some sort of fair valuation. It's still low, but at least people understand it. That's where I'm at.
00:27:10.604 - 00:27:32.362, Speaker A: It's just a fad, David, just a fad. Let's talk about this. Another cool fad, I suppose, is ether on exchanges hitting a three year low. So as the ratio, the ETh to bitcoin ratio hits a three year high, we're seeing a low on the amount of ETh on exchanges. And that's bullish. Why is that bullish, David?
00:27:32.426 - 00:27:58.230, Speaker B: Because if any institution or any newcomer wants to buy ether, they got to do it on exchanges. And so the lower of ETH supply on exchanges, the more a dollar has on the impact of ETH price when it is bought on exchanges. And so this is just going into any sort of, just new inflows has outsized impact upon eth price. Bullish. Bullish. I'm really bullish.
00:27:58.810 - 00:28:16.714, Speaker A: Also bullish on going bankless as well. It's like more of this ETH becomes non custodial, the better for the bankless. Journey, guys. We will be right back with the release of the week. We're going to talk about the hot news items and of course get to the takes and the memes. But before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:28:16.832 - 00:28:52.486, Speaker B: Bankless is proud to be supported by Uniswap. Uniswap is a new paradigm in asset exchange infrastructure. Instead of a cumbersome order book system where trades are matched with other humans, Uniswap is an autonomous piece of software on Ethereum, which is what Ryan and I call a money robot. No human counterparties or centralized intermediaries, just autonomous code on Ethereum. Input the token you want to sell, and receive the token you want to buy. Something brand new in the Uniswap ecosystem is the Uniswap grants program is now accepting applications for grants. We have been saying this for a while, and we'll say it again.
00:28:52.486 - 00:29:20.542, Speaker B: Dows have money and they are in need of labor. If you think that you have something to contribute to the Uniswap dow, apply for a grant to Uniswap. Just look at the size of the Uniswap treasury. It's almost $3 billion. This mountain of capital is looking for labor. Do you have something of value to contribute to the Uniswap Dow? No matter how big or small your idea is, you can apply for a Uni grant@unigrants.org and help steer uniswap in the direction that you think it should go.
00:29:20.542 - 00:30:04.822, Speaker B: That's exactly what we did to get Uniswap to be a sponsor for bankless, and you can do the same for your project. Thank you uniswap for sponsoring bankless the era of proof of stake is upon us. Proof of stake systems like Ethereum, Terra and Solana allow the industry to move away from the hot, loud and wasteful proof of work systems and return back to a cottage industry of individual stakers and individual validators. And that is what we need to make this industry stay decentralized. Individuals must play their part in crypto network validation, and that is what Lido is here to do. Lido makes staking accessible to everyone at the click of a button. By delegating your stake to Lido's network of nodes, you can access the yield offered by proof of stake systems and claim your share of the network transaction rewards.
00:30:04.822 - 00:30:41.814, Speaker B: Do you have 32 Eth and want to stake it to Ethereum? But running a node sounds intimidating. Or maybe you have less than 32 ETH and you need to pool your ETh with others so you can access staking yields. Lido offers a solution for both. Simply go to Lido fi, choose which assets you want to stake, and deposit them to the Lido validating network. Lido is working to make sure proof of stake stays as decentralized as possible and is committed to decentralizing its own validating network to eventually become a completely permissionless protocol. So if you want to stake your etH, terra or Sol and get liquidity on your stake, go to Lido fi to get started.
00:30:41.932 - 00:30:52.974, Speaker A: Alright guys, we are back with the releases of the week. The first is this starkware. David, we're just talking to Starkware last week about Starknet, and now here it is, it's launched. What is in Starknet give us the TLDR. Yeah.
00:30:53.012 - 00:31:35.082, Speaker B: So think optimism. Just like they have their optimistic roll up and arbitrum, they have their optimistic roll up as well. Starknet is a ZK roll up, and we've seen ZK rollups before, but this one is different in that it is the public, permissionless, censorship resistant version of what Starkware has to offer. So this is the one single roll up where everyone can permissionlessly come and deploy on Starknet ZK rollups. They are much more complicated than optimistic rollups, but also a lot faster and a lot cheaper because of the power of zero knowledge cryptography. Starknet Alpha, the first implementation of that is live on Mainnet. So this is the first of a number of rollout progressions in the net story.
00:31:35.082 - 00:31:46.158, Speaker B: And so ZK EVM is now here on Ethereum, which is really, really awesome. Congratulations to the Starkware team. We had them on the show recently. If you missed that episode, you got to go watch it.
00:31:46.244 - 00:32:03.230, Speaker A: It's another bullish episode. Absolutely. And these are all, of course, this is a general purpose. They didn't quite call it a chain, but we call it a chain for short. And so it can run essentially something like the EVM. And so you can have multiple applications interacting. You preserve that composability.
00:32:03.230 - 00:32:09.042, Speaker A: And the more apps that join Starknet, the cheaper the transactions get. How about that for a virtuous cycle?
00:32:09.106 - 00:32:36.442, Speaker B: Yeah. The more users and more applications that are on Starknet, the cheaper the per user transaction gets. That is not something that you can ever find on an l one. That's one of the beauties of l two, is that costs are amortized across all the users. So the more users that use it, the cheaper the transactions get. Rather than like the l ones of crypto, where the more people that use it, the more expensive the transactions get. This is why we call it inverting the blockchain trilemma.
00:32:36.442 - 00:32:44.526, Speaker B: Another piece of content that you need to watch, if you haven't watched it, is super scaling with ultra scalable Ethereum. Is that what we called it?
00:32:44.548 - 00:33:11.418, Speaker A: Yeah, ultra scalable Ethereum. Absolutely. Yeah. This is super scaling with Starkware was the other episode you're thinking of with the starware folks. And, you know, it's so funny is when we're talking about, hey, when are ZK rollups coming? When's this feature functionality? The co founders of Starkware were like, guys, it's here. We're delivering it like next week it's happening. And then over the next six months, is it going to get smoother and smoother? And smoother until maybe you don't even know you're on a roll up at all.
00:33:11.418 - 00:33:20.138, Speaker A: So super exciting there. Also, this argent is maybe launching on Starknet before the end of the year, I believe.
00:33:20.224 - 00:33:31.310, Speaker B: Yep, this is what I saw that hint as well. Somebody was saying, all I want for Christmas is Argent on Starquare. And Argent responded in a tweet, your wish shall be granted. So sometime before Christmas, guys, Santa's coming.
00:33:31.380 - 00:33:36.510, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about this too. Tornado cash moving to Arbitrum. What does this mean?
00:33:36.580 - 00:33:52.370, Speaker B: Yeah, Tornado cash, which is an EtH mixer. In case you are doxed and want to undoc yourself for whatever reasons, you can now do it in a much cheaper fashion on Arbitrum. Tornado cash is generally a gas intensive application on the Ethereum L1, but now it's on arbitrum, so you can get your privacy on Arbitrum.
00:33:52.530 - 00:34:20.410, Speaker A: Privacy solutions coming to Ethereum. Another one to watch is aztec, the aztec protocol. Of course, that is whole ZK roll up that is dedicated to privacy. But I'm really glad to see some of these privacy solutions continuing to be pursued by the Ethereum network. Bancor Three has just released the third version of Banker. These are one of the original automated market makers. They had a big ICO in 2017, and they've continued to plug away at this protocol.
00:34:20.410 - 00:34:22.074, Speaker A: What's new in the release, David?
00:34:22.202 - 00:34:47.270, Speaker B: A bunch of new things. They have impermanent losh protection, which they already had, I think, in Bancorp two, but maybe that's updated and tweaked. There is l two support. So there's Bancorp on L2s, and they also have an omnipool that allows for all trades on the network to occur in a single transaction. Probably some gas efficiencies and some trading efficiencies there, as well as a number of other features as well. So check out the link in the show notes to get the full digest of Bancorp three.
00:34:47.420 - 00:34:57.514, Speaker A: This is cool, too. Nosis making some moves here. So they have a token called Gno. There's also a side chain called XDI that I've used before and I'm sure you've used as well.
00:34:57.552 - 00:35:00.780, Speaker B: That's my first side chain I ever used. Yeah, back in 2018 or something.
00:35:01.550 - 00:35:57.898, Speaker A: I think it started as a proof of authority side chain, maybe moved to sort of a proof of stake type of sidechain. Anyway, it's kind of been overshadowed, I feel like, recently by the polygons of the world and some of the other sidechain type solutions. I'm not sure exactly why, but there is a proposal from one of the co founders of Gnosis, Martin Coppelman, who is actually proposing a merger between XDI and GNO. And what I think they are doing, David, is they are putting together sort of almost like an e two testnet. So it's like a beacon chain type of environment that is going to provide e two functionality with a bit more centralization. Okay. So it won't be nearly as decentralized as Ethereum main net, but it'll almost operate as kind of a staking side chain, like to Ethereum.
00:35:57.898 - 00:36:16.226, Speaker A: And the idea is they're going to propel, I guess, the development track of ethereum clients and sort of have a relationship that way. Anyway, this is a governance proposal, so this has not happened yet, but was interesting nonetheless and caught our attention this week. What else would you add?
00:36:16.328 - 00:36:45.354, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we're really just going to have to wait and see really what happens with this and what the utility of this side chain actually would do. There is some things to be concerned about because since there is a brand new token that's securing this sidechain, that kind of does, like Sazel on the daily grace put it nicely, splits the communities. Right. So you have the one token validating the side chain and the ether token validating Ethereum. And there's a difference there.
00:36:45.552 - 00:36:48.270, Speaker A: And that's what you meant by like a split.
00:36:48.930 - 00:36:55.166, Speaker B: So one is for one chain and that doesn't actually formally link to Ethereum in any particular way.
00:36:55.268 - 00:37:04.466, Speaker A: Yeah, there's some disalignment there when you have something like this. But people said this about polygon as well in the early days and they've managed to say it's kind of socially connected to Ethereum. Yeah.
00:37:04.488 - 00:37:38.046, Speaker B: The difference there is that polygon actually has economic slashing for any malicious activity between the bridge and that Polygon staking is actually occurring on the Ethereum l one, not on the polygon side chain. And I believe that, if I'm understanding this correctly, is that the xdiagnosis side chain will not have staking on the Ethereum main chain. It'll be its own independent, self sovereign system. And then also polygon is very, very committed to ZK roll ups, which by definition are hooked right into Ethereum itself. So there is some differences there. Yeah.
00:37:38.068 - 00:37:57.646, Speaker A: It's interesting though, because know Martin and the team at Gnosis have been very socially plugged into Ethereum. Right. Like very socially connected. So we'll have to see where this project evolves. But I like the experimentation of it and I think it's cool to kind of resurrect XDI in a new way and see where that goes. Let's talk about some raises. David, Celsius crypto banks are raising.
00:37:57.646 - 00:38:08.390, Speaker A: They just got a series b. $400 million is oversubscribed. So actually, I think maybe they were asking for 400 million. They got 750,000,000. Wow. Not sure how that works. Wow.
00:38:08.390 - 00:38:11.402, Speaker A: But it's a lot of money for crypto banks these days. Any takes.
00:38:11.536 - 00:38:22.286, Speaker B: That is a lot of money. Yeah. Why is Celsius so highly valued? I mean, I haven't used it, but isn't it just like DFI products, but in CFI form 3.5?
00:38:22.468 - 00:38:35.582, Speaker A: Yes, sir, that's what it is. It's 3.25 billion. And look, it's kind of a crypto bank, right? Borrowing and lending, your tokens and your bitcoin, your eth. And there's a lot of value in that.
00:38:35.716 - 00:38:37.570, Speaker B: I bet you they're going to buy a stadium.
00:38:38.710 - 00:38:55.874, Speaker A: They probably should, right? Join the club. Join crypto. How about this? Fireblocks, man. I feel like they just raised. We had the founder of Fireblocks on, I don't know, had to be less than six months ago, and they had just come off a raise. Now here's another raise. I don't remember what the previous raise was, but I feel like it was like a $2 billion valuation.
00:38:55.874 - 00:39:17.482, Speaker A: It was multiple billions, maybe. Now it's $8 billion valuation. Okay. And they just raised $400 million. Fireblocks, of course, provides kind of institutional friendly DFI. They provide the custody layer and the APIs so institutions can hook into the crypto experience, and particularly in DFI. So it's a really interesting company from that perspective.
00:39:17.482 - 00:39:25.586, Speaker A: And another crazy raise. This is a series e, David. So I don't know how many letters of the Alphabet we get until you go public, but we're already on e.
00:39:25.688 - 00:39:43.720, Speaker B: So on July 27, they raised $310,000,000 for a $2 billion valuation. Now they are raising $400 million for, sorry, again, $8 billion valuation. They forex their market cap less than six months.
00:39:44.650 - 00:39:49.878, Speaker A: Crypto is absolutely tearing right now. I don't know. Does that make you worried about a.
00:39:49.884 - 00:39:53.526, Speaker B: Lot of money out there? Remember how much money we printed? It was in the trillions.
00:39:53.718 - 00:40:17.886, Speaker A: God. Money has become meaningless, I suppose. It's not crypto that's the bubble. It's money that's meaningless. One inch network just closes $175,000,000 in their series B. They're moving into institutional customers as well. That will really change one inch was kind of like, I guess kind of a niche defi project in the beginning.
00:40:17.886 - 00:40:35.014, Speaker A: It looks like they're really scaling up for institutions, really commercializing. Last experience I've had with one inch, I actually couldn't use it because I was based in the US. Right. You had to turn a VPN on or something like this before you could connect. But this is a pretty massive valuation as well. What do you make of this?
00:40:35.132 - 00:41:01.840, Speaker B: It's interesting when I see teams raising that also have a token. Like intuitively you kind of want to say, well, you only get to pick one. Like either you raise or you do a token, but you don't get to do both. But actually that's just like kind of the gut reaction. You can totally do both because nothing's stopping you. But you do have to ask, where is the value being captured? Because if there's a centralized private entity and then a public traded token, where's the value going to go?
00:41:02.370 - 00:41:07.874, Speaker A: Yeah. Are you starting to worry about this? It's kind of like CRO in crypto.com, right?
00:41:07.912 - 00:41:39.834, Speaker B: Yeah. They have equity holders pay attention to. I'm not yet concerned about. I think it's just going to be an interesting subject matter with tokens, where tokens don't actually have any regulatory commitments, like you don't actually have any investor rights as a token owner. There's just the token on the blockchain, and that does whatever it does, and then there's a centralized company that can do whatever it does. So TBD on what the dynamics behind private equity and public tokens are like. But again, there's no actual limits as to why you can't do both.
00:41:39.834 - 00:41:45.306, Speaker B: Just intuitively it seems kind of weird, but again, it's just like we've just got to experiment.
00:41:45.418 - 00:42:24.698, Speaker A: It seems like the higher risk, maybe higher return, but definitely higher risk asset, particularly if there's a centralized company involved. So if it's a centralized company and it also has a token right, at least if you're buying equity in that company, you have some sort of legal right. If you just have a token, what do you actually own? You just have a token. So maybe that goes up higher zooms in the bull run, but when things turn, that's got to be the riskier asset. We'll have to see how all of that plays out. David, this is a raise from a former Wall street banker who just launched a $1.5 billion crypto venture fund.
00:42:24.698 - 00:42:39.598, Speaker A: This reminds me of 2017 a little bit too, where everyone was launching a fund. This is someone from a fund called Hive Mind Capital Partners, a former citigroup executive. So former banker Matt Zhang has launched this fund. Any takes here?
00:42:39.684 - 00:43:12.122, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think there's two quick takes here. This is an example as to why crypto doesn't fix wealth distribution. Wealthy people can just take their wealth and buy crypto with it, and they are still wealthy, and now they're in crypto. But what it does fix is long term incentives. And so getting wealthy people into the world of crypto makes them abide by our rules and our values. While crypto is not a panacea for fixing wealth distribution and wealth inequality in the world, it does actually force people onto the same equal playing fields, which is something that we can't say about the tradfi world.
00:43:12.256 - 00:43:36.190, Speaker A: If they adopt crypto, they adopt crypto values. We say this often on bankless. Speaking of crypto values, let's talk about jobs. Imagine having a job that aligned with your crypto values. If you're listening to bankless, which I know you are, then you probably have crypto values like us. So go check out the job board. If you want to make the full time commitment, make the leap, look towards 2022.
00:43:36.190 - 00:44:08.086, Speaker A: What are you going to be doing in 2022? Be sitting at that corporate job? Are you going to look and see what's available in crypto? There's lots you could do here. Here's a senior back end engineer from smart Defi product manager as well as an accountant from Smart Defi. That's pretty diverse. Senior software engineer at popcorn Community Ecosystem lead at DYDx, crypto research analyst. You got to be an NFT specialist for this.

00:44:32.606 - 00:44:34.260, Speaker B: Get a goddamn job.
00:44:36.950 - 00:44:49.686, Speaker A: All right, let's talk news. David, big news item of the week. We promised this Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, also CEO of Square. He's like a co CEO. He just resigned from Twitter. Here's his letter. Very transparent.
00:44:49.686 - 00:45:03.902, Speaker A: He posts on Twitter as is fitting and. Yeah. What do you make of this? Jack Dorsey, gone from Twitter, feels like he is maybe committing full time to square, which now is a new name. David, what's the new name?
00:45:03.956 - 00:45:44.214, Speaker B: Square has a new name called Block because it wants to lean in towards blockchain infrastructure. And square crypto is now called spiral. So Jack is really just like leaving Twitter, I think, to really double down on. I mean, for Jack, it's bitcoin. Square crypto is called square crypto, but with Jack leading it, it's really about bitcoin. And there's been a bunch of speculation as to, well, why did Jack leave Twitter? Did he really want to actually do this? Or was he kindly asked to leave because he was putting up frictions for Twitter? Putting up adopting web3 things. Jack is a famous bitcoin maximalist.
00:45:44.214 - 00:46:10.260, Speaker B: He really only cares about bitcoin. He has publicly retweeted tweets calling ethereum a scam and really only believes in bitcoin. And all these web two companies, Twitter especially, all kind of see web3 on the horizon and see this wave of adoption happening. And so the speculation from the ethereum, people who have the ethereum bias and so they are just biased towards thinking this is that Jack Dorsey got pushed out because he wasn't adopting web3.
00:46:11.190 - 00:46:45.178, Speaker A: You know, the interesting thing, though, I feel like saying, jack, you can run, but you can't hide. Do you know why? So you just named Square block. Okay? You didn't name it bitcoin. Square really can't. Square faces the same dilemma that Twitter does, which is if Jack does take square in the bitcoin maximalist direction, which he kind of has so far, we'll have to see what happens next. He's going to miss out on all the cool defi stuff, right? I mean, we had visa on, we had anchorage on. We're talking about the defi mullet and fintech and visa.
00:46:45.178 - 00:46:47.390, Speaker A: And it's all like stablecoins.
00:46:47.810 - 00:46:54.690, Speaker B: Square is a payments company and people don't pay with bitcoin, they pay with stablecoins that are on Ethereum. Like what?
00:46:54.840 - 00:46:57.090, Speaker A: Like lightning. Just.
00:46:57.240 - 00:46:58.306, Speaker B: It's not going to happen.
00:46:58.408 - 00:47:22.742, Speaker A: Fraction of kind of the block story. So it's going to continue chasing him there. I think. Let's talk about the new person who's taken over for Jack, because that's important. Look, Twitter is a very important platform. So the new person, I think, was Jack's number two, Parag Agarwal. He is a champion at Twitter.
00:47:22.742 - 00:47:50.142, Speaker A: So five things about him. This is a coin dust story. He was the leading force in Twitter's decentralization projects. I'm not sure how much progress they actually made, but there was a project at Twitter called Blue sky just kind of protocolized Twitter. So maybe he's an advocate there. He also led Twitter's migration to cloud services. He's very concerned about the ethics of tech, which is sort of interesting because as a web company to, it's refreshing.
00:47:50.142 - 00:48:35.758, Speaker A: But also the, I very much feel like protocols should be as credibly neutral as possible and actually shouldn't be injecting political bias into their platform. And it's interesting that Twitter has had a, I guess a recent run of what some would say kind of erosion of free speech. And just earlier this week, they actually banned the ability for individuals to post public images without consent. So unless you're a public figure, if I just take a photo of you, David, and I post it on Twitter, that's like a banable offense, a censorable type offense, which is somewhat interesting. Right. So, like, when you have permission to.
00:48:35.764 - 00:48:37.342, Speaker B: Make pictures of me on Twitter, by the way.
00:48:37.396 - 00:48:39.742, Speaker A: Okay, can I get that in writing, sir? Because I don't want to get in trouble.
00:48:39.806 - 00:48:40.740, Speaker B: Do you want to?
00:48:41.190 - 00:49:08.198, Speaker A: Yeah. He also rose up quickly in Twitter's ranks. He doesn't use Twitter very much, but I think part of the summary from this new CEO is I think he'll be very friendly. Web three, right? So like, the NFT initiatives, the Ethereum initiatives, that's like full steam ahead. And maybe it needed Jack to kind of step aside, to your point, for this to really take off. So I think it's bullish for NFTs and web3 from that perspective.
00:49:08.294 - 00:49:11.550, Speaker B: Hopefully, hopefully we're just not reading into it. It's just too much.
00:49:11.620 - 00:49:18.654, Speaker A: Hopefully that we will see square becoming blocked, though. Like, okay, Facebook becoming meta, square becoming block. What's next, man?
00:49:18.772 - 00:49:19.566, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:49:19.668 - 00:49:42.402, Speaker A: What's Alphabet going to become constitution? Dow, it's shut down. We reported on that. We talked about that last week. They raised $50 million almost to buy the constitution, a copy of the constitution. Now they shut down. But something crazy happened. Okay, which is their people token, which was a token associated with this project, has been mooning.
00:49:42.402 - 00:49:42.646, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:42.668 - 00:49:43.640, Speaker B: Do you know why?
00:49:44.410 - 00:49:45.158, Speaker A: No.
00:49:45.324 - 00:49:46.470, Speaker B: Can you tell me?
00:49:46.620 - 00:50:11.134, Speaker A: Because I sold right before that happened, sir, or I redeemed. So going to thanksgiving, I was like, I want to get everything off my plate. I want to have to worry about this thing. And I had a little bit of funds in the constitution, Dow, because that was fun. It was a really interesting thing. And I was like, just, I'll withdraw this biggest mistake I've made this year, this month, the week of the week.
00:50:11.252 - 00:50:15.150, Speaker B: It's only because the people token started mooning for God knows why. What reason?
00:50:15.300 - 00:50:19.090, Speaker A: It's memes back to what you were saying with the omicron. Yeah, right.
00:50:19.160 - 00:50:20.114, Speaker B: Just because it can.
00:50:20.232 - 00:50:22.078, Speaker A: I don't know. What do you think? Why is it moon? Clue?
00:50:22.094 - 00:50:23.870, Speaker B: I have no clue. I have no clue.
00:50:24.030 - 00:50:30.518, Speaker A: What is this reinforce in you? For me, it reinforces that I still know nothing in the short run in crypto, as far as what's going to.
00:50:30.524 - 00:50:32.662, Speaker B: Happen, crypto will always surprise you.
00:50:32.796 - 00:50:43.974, Speaker A: I had no way to predict this. Neither did anyone else. Let's talk about EIP 4488. This is a new EIP. We talked about this a little bit briefly on the last roll up, but what is this? David?
00:50:44.022 - 00:51:16.546, Speaker B: Yeah, this is Proto Lambda, a very, very longtime eth developer, now also working on the optimism team and also with the ultrasound money emojis in his header. And he goes, I support EIP 4488. Let's make roll ups cheaper. Let me explain what this is about. He goes, technical TLdR EIP 4488 reduces the call data gas cost from 16 to three gas per byte with a cap on call data per block to mitigate security risks. End user TLDR is that roll ups cost overhead decreases, thus lowering l two fees. So basically, we talked about this last week.
00:51:16.546 - 00:52:04.082, Speaker B: This is a rebalancing of gas. And we haven't actually really talked about how gas is calculated, but there are arbitrary values associated to certain calculations that comes up with what a gas cost is, and we can tinker with those numbers in order to balance the economic resources of the network. And EIP 4488 reduces the cost of call data, which is something that roll ups all definitely use very, very heavily from 16 to three. And so really, this is Ethereum executing on its roll up centric roadmap from the get go by, really, just like allowing us to take off the brakes on roll ups. So roll up transactions just become meaningfully cheaper and also, therefore faster. That's what EIP 4488 is all about.
00:52:04.136 - 00:53:08.760, Speaker A: You know what I find so endlessly fascinating about this? This reminds me of just public policy changes to incent a certain behavior. Like, the government does this all the time with its tax policy, right? So if you want more corn, you provide a subsidy for corn, you want more dairy, you provide a dairy subsidy, right? You encourage this behavior, you subsidize it economically. This is the Ethereum protocol, encouraging migration to roll ups, encouraging users and usage to get off of layer one and to move over to roll ups in a big way. So what's your take on this? Do you support this? I mean, there are some tradeoffs, David, which is one is it does kind of increase block if, if without further solutions in the future, this could make nodes a bit more difficult to run for individual users, which obviously can't go unchecked. Or you have another problem. Are you pro eip four four eight a or no?
00:53:09.130 - 00:53:53.350, Speaker B: I mean, the pros and cons are definitely like way more technical than I can get into, but proto lambda, I think as a proxy for me as a delegate of my beliefs, if he supports it, then I 100% support it. And we've seen Ethereum have measured increases in block space plenty of times before. And the quick trivia fact is that I think the Ethereum block space is over like three to four times higher than it was at Genesis because our clients got more efficient, our networking got more efficient, things just improved. And so Ethereum is actually like three to four times more scaled than it started at Genesis because we were able to measuredly and responsibly and sustainably increase block space. And so, sure, let's just do it again.
00:53:53.500 - 00:54:01.818, Speaker A: There you go. That's David's take. Mahalo. This is about Uniswap and polygon what's happening here. Yeah.
00:54:01.824 - 00:54:24.282, Speaker B: So last week the polygon proposal to onboard Uniswap onto polygon had overwhelming support. That vote did in fact pass. So they are moving on to the second phase of the governance process, which is a temperature check pull. And then there's another phase after that. There's just a lot of hurdles, but we're on to the second one. So polygon perhaps eventually getting uniswap.
00:54:24.346 - 00:54:34.946, Speaker A: Once it goes through all, it's going to happen, right? I mean, I had overwhelming support, so it's definitely going to happen. Do you know yesterday the time people read this would be the beacon chain birthday.
00:54:35.018 - 00:54:37.378, Speaker B: Happy birthday. That was when chain proof of stake.
00:54:37.394 - 00:54:43.110, Speaker A: On Ethereum was born. And do you remember that call when we were on as that was launching? It was a lot of fun.
00:54:43.180 - 00:54:46.374, Speaker B: Yeah, my roommate chewed me out for waking him up because it was at like four in the morning.
00:54:46.492 - 00:54:48.506, Speaker A: Well, he wasn't as excited as you were.
00:54:48.688 - 00:54:50.250, Speaker B: And now I live alone.
00:54:52.190 - 00:55:12.442, Speaker A: Bye, roommate. Sorry. Well, Vitalik put together a happy birthday beacon chain post with a handy roadmap. And this is really interesting. This is the roadmap for Ethereum in the future. This is the most consolidated roadmap I think I've seen, and it comes complete with timelines. And there are really five things going on that are going to happen with Ethereum.
00:55:12.442 - 00:55:32.614, Speaker A: One is the merge. I have to. Okay, I'll just read them fast. The merge, the surge, the verge, the purge, and then the splurge. Okay. And this is like memetic as well, because it's crypto, the merge we've talked about so often that happens next year. Proof of stake becomes the consensus layer, proof of work goes away.
00:55:32.614 - 00:55:51.662, Speaker A: The surge is data sharding. The verge is providing trees, merkel trees, merkel trees. So providing more stateless ways to run a node. Right. So it's easier for users to run a node again. Each of these, by the way, are like efforts to continue decentralizing the network. Right.
00:55:51.662 - 00:56:14.926, Speaker A: The proof of stake and also data availability. And the verge, too, the purge. This is eliminating historical data and technical debt. I'm a bit more fuzzy on this. And then the splurge seems like it's everything that's left over, just all the cherries on top and the bits of pieces that are going to be important in the future of Ethereum. Yeah. What do you make this roadmap?
00:56:15.038 - 00:56:53.714, Speaker B: It's just really nice to see everything all in one spot. Vitalik, of all people, is one of the few people that actually has the ability to kind of have this bird's eye view upon everything. These progress bars that you're seeing are definitely just completely subjective from the brain of Vitalik. But Vitalik's just known to be good at stuff like this, and so it's just nice to see what is all left to do, and it's kind of overwhelming how much there is left to do. It is nice to see that all these progress is happening in so many different directions at once. But Ethereum has always had this very, very ambitious roadmap. And while we get to the merge soon, and then data shards after that, those are kind of close.
00:56:53.714 - 00:57:21.510, Speaker B: There's still so much left to do. There's statelessness, there's stateless clients, there's meta transactions, there's z case narking the whole entire blockchain. My God, that sounds hard and complicated. I'm glad I'm not the one having to do that, but I'll just talk about it along the way. But, yeah, there's a lot left to do. This is cool. When we had Justin Drake on our first episode with him, the moon math cryptography episode, he talked about how Ethereum is just like this cryptographer's playground.
00:57:21.510 - 00:57:53.166, Speaker B: And so cryptography finally has a place to actually get meaningfully implemented and put into practice. And that's why Ethereum has attracted so many deep cryptographers, because Ethereum needs cryptography. And that's also one of the big things that really separates Ethereum from every other ecosystem, is all the cryptographers are here, and our industry is based on cryptography. I will remind you, it's called cryptocurrency for a reason. And all useful bits of cryptography are eventually becoming integrated into Ethereum in this roadmap.
00:57:53.278 - 00:58:25.742, Speaker A: Do you know what hits me with this roadmap, too, is I feel like Ethereum's roadmap has never been more clear. So it's always been incredibly ambitious, but it's never been as solidified and clear as it has been in 2021. I feel like we've gotten that clarity. So I remember back in 2017, 2018, I was like, pining for a roadmap, detail the future, what's going to happen and when, and how is this all going to work? And it just like, it wasn't available at the time.
00:58:25.796 - 00:58:35.154, Speaker B: It's like, oh, yeah, we're going to have proof of stake in the details. Sharding. Cool. Sharding, like what? More details, please.
00:58:35.352 - 00:58:44.770, Speaker A: This is incredible progress. And that makes me bullish as well. So the Ethereum roadmap has never been more clear. Budweiser did it.
00:58:44.840 - 00:58:49.410, Speaker B: Beer eth in their Twitter handle. They've owned beer ETH for a while, but now.
00:58:49.480 - 00:58:50.486, Speaker A: That's right, I forgot about that.
00:58:50.508 - 00:58:52.070, Speaker B: Now it's in their Twitter handle.
00:58:52.490 - 00:58:56.710, Speaker A: Oh, wow. What does that mean? So can we send Budweiser some eth? Send him some money?
00:58:56.780 - 00:58:57.510, Speaker B: Totally.
00:58:57.850 - 00:59:03.814, Speaker A: Please send us some beer, probably. I don't want any beer from Budweiser.
00:59:03.862 - 00:59:05.306, Speaker B: Personally, but that's the right answer.
00:59:05.408 - 00:59:17.310, Speaker A: Well, that's cool, man. It's like a huge brand, though. Budweiser is like the brand of beer and one of the major ones. I wonder if we'll see others following suits. Pretty cool. They're putting it in their handle. How many followers?
00:59:17.890 - 00:59:20.030, Speaker B: Wow. Yeah. What?
00:59:20.100 - 00:59:20.474, Speaker A: Weird.
00:59:20.522 - 00:59:21.582, Speaker B: Only 230,000.
00:59:21.636 - 00:59:23.838, Speaker A: 230,000 followers? Yeah.
00:59:24.004 - 00:59:29.140, Speaker B: You have something like that, David? Way more than that. Way more than that. My alt has more than that.
00:59:29.510 - 00:59:32.866, Speaker A: What's this a month for ens? What's happening? Yeah.
00:59:32.888 - 01:00:02.538, Speaker B: So this is just a summary of the activity on ens. Brantley summons it up nicely. 90,000 new ETH registrations in November, all on the ethereum l one. 7.6 million in protocol revenue. So, like, when you buy an ETH domain from ens, it goes to now the ENS dow. So the ENS dow got seven point million dollars in ETH revenue this last month, and then 99% of openc volume ens trading activity is on openc.
01:00:02.538 - 01:00:08.000, Speaker B: So that's pretty crazy. And now there are 200,000 unique individual owners with an ENS name.
01:00:08.370 - 01:00:09.850, Speaker A: The token effect, David.
01:00:09.930 - 01:00:12.894, Speaker B: Probably the token effect. Definitely the token effect.
01:00:13.012 - 01:00:25.458, Speaker A: It's funny, I feel like Brentley's gotten a lot more popular too. Like post token effect, right? I just think communities rally around tokens. It's just what happens. Injects energy into whatever you're doing.
01:00:25.544 - 01:00:34.562, Speaker B: Tokens are the place that communities can deposit energy and attention and alignment into. Without a token, there is no coherence. Tokens align communities.
01:00:34.706 - 01:00:37.894, Speaker A: I mean, Brantley's always been cool. He's just got like post token man.
01:00:38.012 - 01:00:40.454, Speaker B: But now he's token Brantley, he's hitting it.
01:00:40.492 - 01:01:00.154, Speaker A: Token Brantley. Tokenbrandly eth Brantley. Hope you're listening. This is a PSA. Watch out for front ends. I think front ends can become centralization vectors. And this is a tweet from Bantag saying, anyone know when the Uniswap front end has started snitching on users? That's some harsh language.
01:01:00.154 - 01:01:50.730, Speaker A: But what the app is saying is it's actually notifying you. This is the uniswap front end app. It's saying the app securely connects your wallet address and shares it with TRM Labs incorporated for risk and compliance reasons. Okay, TRM labs, it looks like they are some sort of apparatus that collects information for risk and compliance, which basically means for the government, if this is for the IRS, if this is for the SEC, who, this is for what compliance, what risk this is covering. But that is happening on the Uniswap front end, and I expect teams that are based in various jurisdictions, Uniswap, of course, is based in the US, to be like, arm twisted into doing this sort of thing on their front ends. Of course, this doesn't affect the smart contracts, the underlying smart contracts, not Uniswap.
01:01:50.810 - 01:01:54.580, Speaker B: This is the Uniswap Labs centralized company, their website.
01:01:55.030 - 01:01:58.754, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a huge distinction. Why don't you get into what that distinction means?
01:01:58.872 - 01:02:29.690, Speaker B: So we have the Uniswap smart contracts on Ethereum, which allow anyone to swap tokens through their liquidity, through their factory contracts. The front end of a very large number of websites make it easy for users to use those smart contracts because no one's actually going and writing the code themselves. We have these front ends that do it for us. Uniswap spun up the first one, but there's plenty of others. There's one on Zapper as a front end. Zerion is a front end. All the Dex aggregators can tap into Uniswap, so they count as a front end.
01:02:29.690 - 01:03:12.838, Speaker B: There's infinite front ends for Uniswap, but the Uniswap Labs version of the front end collects your wallet address for compliance reasons. And what's interesting, Ryan, is there was a time where the Uniswap labs front end also banned a bunch of tokens and also banned a bunch of countries. And then the bitcoin maxis were like, see, we told you Uniswap was centralized, not understanding the difference between the front end and the contracts. And now this time maybe this hasn't made it into bitcoiner circles yet. Or maybe they've just given tag Anthony Pompliano. Tag Anthony Pompeano. But usually this would get some sort of attention from bitcoiners talking about, oh, like, oh, I knew Ethereum was centralized.
01:03:12.838 - 01:03:14.026, Speaker B: This one hasn't happened.
01:03:14.048 - 01:03:17.354, Speaker A: I think they're feeling a little defeated on the ratio, maybe went down to their sales.
01:03:17.472 - 01:03:32.586, Speaker B: I think they are fully relegated into gold bugs. But anyway, that used to happen all the time for those that are new to crypto. No longer happening now because people, I think are understanding the difference between a centralized website and an application on Ethereum.
01:03:32.698 - 01:04:00.322, Speaker A: Yeah, that's important. And I think this is an important PSA. And I also think it's sort of a reminder that centralization, aggregation, centralized websites can become vectors for this sort of thing. Right? And they're going to. So we've kind of decentralized the protocol, we've decentralized the money robots and that's all good, that's all smart contract code. We have more work to do in crypto to make sure our Front ends remain decentralized as well. And of course anyone can spin up a front end.
01:04:00.322 - 01:04:26.126, Speaker A: This is not stopping anyone. But having the ability to have decentralized storage, decentralized compute sort of layers is going to be incredibly important. And that's kind of where we're journeying because things tend to centralize unless you actively push against that force of gravity. Let's talk about this NFT land, AMC, Sony. They're launching NFT rewards for the Spider man movie launch. David, I'm seeing this in theaters, man. I'm a big Spider man fan.
01:04:26.158 - 01:04:29.170, Speaker B: I know, look, you see my movie?
01:04:30.070 - 01:04:34.146, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm a cu. But you don't watch the new ones, right? Oh, sure. You're not new, Spider man.
01:04:34.168 - 01:04:34.466, Speaker B: You do.
01:04:34.488 - 01:04:51.402, Speaker A: Okay. I'm seeing this in theaters. Apparently there's an NFT associated with this. It's on the wax blockchain. It's kind of an NFT side chain. But what's interesting to me is are all movies going to start having NFT releases? Why not? Of course they are. What do you think?
01:04:51.456 - 01:05:06.526, Speaker B: I remember when we were talking with Diogo and Kai from our visa Anchorage podcast where they talked about how the volatility of crypto actually is really, really attractive for a lot of companies because the volatility of crypto makes a lot of their users open up their app and check it.
01:05:06.548 - 01:05:07.982, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, that was such a good point.
01:05:08.036 - 01:05:11.322, Speaker B: Yeah. And so NFTs are just engagement magnets.
01:05:11.386 - 01:05:12.314, Speaker A: It boosts engagement.
01:05:12.362 - 01:05:18.974, Speaker B: It boosts engagement for some reason. And this is why everyone is like, macy's day parade had nfts. It boosts engagement.
01:05:19.102 - 01:05:23.374, Speaker A: Yeah. It's like we're just talking about token Brantley. What about token Spiderman?
01:05:23.422 - 01:05:28.890, Speaker B: Right? He's way better than the over Spiderman. He's token Spiderman.
01:05:29.070 - 01:05:31.814, Speaker A: Token Peter Parker. Yeah, that's what I want.
01:05:31.852 - 01:05:43.838, Speaker B: So, like, all, all big movies are trending towards just like, oh, and we will issue tokens during the box office weekends because that's what people want, I guess. There's token engagement.
01:05:44.034 - 01:05:54.906, Speaker A: Yeah, that's interesting. And everyone's going to follow suit. We'll have to see how that progresses. I'm going to see the movie. I'm not going to get this NFT because how exhausting. Too many nfts, man. This is Ross Ulbrich.
01:05:54.906 - 01:05:59.918, Speaker A: This is an NFT to watch, though. Okay. So people probably familiar with Ross's story.
01:06:00.004 - 01:06:03.102, Speaker B: Maybe not actually, given the short form.
01:06:03.156 - 01:06:08.594, Speaker A: And then he's starting an NFT auction in two days from jail. Is that what's happening? Okay.
01:06:08.792 - 01:06:35.210, Speaker B: Yeah. So his mom is his liaison between him and jail and his Twitter account. So this is actually his mom talking on his behalf through his Twitter account. Ross Ulbricht is the famous dread pirate Roberts from the Silk Road days. So the Silk Road was started by this guy, Ross Ulbricht. He is in jail for basically life on ridiculous trumped up charges in my mind, and he should absolutely be freed right now. But he's not.
01:06:35.210 - 01:07:05.150, Speaker B: And he's kept in touch with the world of crypto. His mom prints out the front page of Reddit and gives it to him so he can review it and also feeds him other crypto news. And he's launching an NFT. And so Ross Ulbrich is launching an NFT auction. So Ross Ulbrich says in his post, with this NFT, I see a chance to make a difference where it really counts in the lives of kids who did not ask for any of this. There is a lot that we can do with the proceeds of the auction. But one idea I'm committed to is to help kids travel to visit their moms and dads in prison.
01:07:05.150 - 01:07:19.362, Speaker B: Ross Ulbricht, again in prison for basically life. Very peaceful, nice guy. Mom has to come and visit him in prison all the time. And so the proceeds of this NFT are going to help, just help maintain connections between loved ones in prison.
01:07:19.506 - 01:07:21.258, Speaker A: Are people hating on this, though?
01:07:21.424 - 01:07:56.158, Speaker B: Bitcoiners are, yeah, because it's an NFT. So Ross Ulbricht went to jail before ethereum was really a thing. And so he was always a bitcoiner. And a lot of bitcoiners are very, very upset that Ross Ulbricht, their beloved jailed martyr, is using non bitcoin tech to do stuff. And so they're bitcoiners following up on this tweet saying, God effing damn it, Ross. And then another one saying, how to ruin your base in one fellow swoop for just touching nfts. Bitcoiners have absolutely lost the plot.
01:07:56.158 - 01:07:57.060, Speaker B: Absolutely.
01:07:57.530 - 01:08:06.438, Speaker A: Purity tests have gotten more and more extreme, right. Until you can't even touch an NFT. This is ootie being satirical, though, right? He's kind of joking on that.
01:08:06.444 - 01:08:09.394, Speaker B: No, this is ootie being serious.
01:08:09.522 - 01:08:09.958, Speaker A: No.
01:08:10.044 - 01:08:10.794, Speaker B: Yes, 100%.
01:08:10.832 - 01:08:11.366, Speaker A: Are you serious?
01:08:11.398 - 01:08:12.662, Speaker B: Yes, this is ootie being serious.
01:08:12.726 - 01:08:19.190, Speaker A: Are you sure? Yes. I can never tell. Yes. No, Udi, he says, effing disgusting. Effing cult. Disgusting.
01:08:19.270 - 01:08:23.050, Speaker B: Right? Talking about the bitcoiners reacting to Ross Ulbricht.
01:08:23.130 - 01:08:24.346, Speaker A: Talking about the bitcoiners.
01:08:24.378 - 01:08:31.754, Speaker B: He's talking about the. He is. He's telling the bitcoiners they are a disgusting effing.
01:08:31.882 - 01:08:39.822, Speaker A: Okay, I thought he was saying effing disgusting cult about the NFT itself, about Ross doing the NFT.
01:08:39.886 - 01:08:42.594, Speaker B: Okay, the bitcoiners are being.
01:08:42.632 - 01:08:43.554, Speaker A: Call him out, man.
01:08:43.672 - 01:08:48.180, Speaker B: Love you, ootie, most of the time.
01:08:48.730 - 01:08:49.942, Speaker A: Let's talk about this, man.
01:08:49.996 - 01:08:51.302, Speaker B: This is like a Reddit post.
01:08:51.436 - 01:08:56.070, Speaker A: I'm going to full screen this. This is some dude unlocking his house with an NFT.
01:08:56.650 - 01:09:29.710, Speaker B: Yeah, an NFT that he has in his Ethereum wallet, connecting to the Internet somehow and then unlocking a door to his house. There's also another example of this for the same thing, with a car. And here's a fun piece of ethereum trivia. This is why our shows go on so long, because we have so many stories to tell. There's this old, old organization called Slockit that I don't think is around anymore that wanted to do exactly this, where you could go and open up a locker and the locker would have the thing that you would need in it, and drones could come and it would all be based on Ethereum and public private key cryptography.
01:09:29.790 - 01:09:32.450, Speaker A: Very Ethereum 2016 Sci-Fi stuff.
01:09:32.520 - 01:09:35.862, Speaker B: When we didn't really know what Ethereum would do, when we thought, do anything, right?
01:09:35.916 - 01:09:37.474, Speaker A: Unlock bikes and unlock houses.
01:09:37.522 - 01:10:03.978, Speaker B: Yeah, right. Like communal sharing, communal resources, stuff like that. Slocket, the three guys behind slocket, they wanted this to not be a centralized company, so they wanted to start a dow back in 2017. But then the idea kind of morphed from there. It's like, well, why have this dow just be about slocket? Let's just have a dow of dows. And I think you can see where this is going. This was the genesis of the Dow.
01:10:03.978 - 01:10:27.778, Speaker B: The three guys behind the slocket started to write the codes for the Dow, which turned into the Dow and then created the whole Ethereum classic mess. So, yeah, that's a fun piece of Ethereum trivia. We are coming full circle to some of the utility and use cases that we were dreaming of in 2016 now being happening just through the maturation of mobile wallets and also ens and also nfts.
01:10:27.874 - 01:10:46.466, Speaker A: It's funny, you're not wrong. You're just early is really the phrase here. So many things have happened in the history of technology where ideas are good. It's just not their time. And I think slockit was one of them. And now here we are starting to unlock various locks with our nfts. And it looks somewhat normal.
01:10:46.466 - 01:11:04.390, Speaker A: I mean, this looks like a pretty good user experience. I'm not saying this is ready for mainstream, but it's a lot closer than it was in 2016. If you want to hear that. Full story, by the way, Griff Green Layer zero podcast, I listened to that one, David. I was laughing out loud in some spots. That was just a lot of fun. Tells a story of the Dow, everything that went on with slocket.
01:11:04.390 - 01:11:30.006, Speaker A: I guess this is the Internet of things. The Internet of scarce things, maybe. Very cool. Let's talk about immutable now. Immutable X making, actually crushing it. Okay, so the first thing we want to talk about is they're getting a fiat on ramp so moonpay is a fiat on ramp. They're getting a fiat on ramp directly to immutable on and off ramp, which is something we need so dearly.
01:11:30.006 - 01:11:38.138, Speaker A: So that's happening. And that means instant credit card purchases of your nfts on top of immutable. This is mainstream. Ready.
01:11:38.304 - 01:11:58.530, Speaker B: Completely abstracting away like, oh, NFT, where can I swipe my credit card? That's what this partnership creates. And the awesome thing is, gas fees on immutable X are so incredibly low that you just don't actually have zero. Right? They're not zero, but they are zero because they are so low because the immutable team is just paying for them.
01:11:58.600 - 01:12:06.302, Speaker A: Yes, right, exactly. So they're zero from the perspective of a user. I just like, I could buy my NFT with a credit card and it's all secured by Ethereum.
01:12:06.366 - 01:12:06.786, Speaker B: Right?
01:12:06.888 - 01:12:17.126, Speaker A: This is the difference. This is what we've been waiting for. We don't sacrifice decentralization. These are some immutable stats, too. Well, first, let's talk about their business development. Yeah.
01:12:17.148 - 01:12:31.242, Speaker B: So immutable tweets out. We're getting 50 plus inbounds a day from the largest companies in the world wanting to use nfts, and we need help. Nfts are eating the world. Come accelerate it. Hiring 30 plus business developers and csms. I don't know what a CSM is. DM's open or apply here.
01:12:31.242 - 01:12:33.486, Speaker B: They are also on our jobs board as well.
01:12:33.588 - 01:12:37.454, Speaker A: Yeah, they are some really cool jobs too. Head of Ethereum research. Is that one of them?
01:12:37.492 - 01:12:37.850, Speaker B: Yep.
01:12:37.930 - 01:12:39.534, Speaker A: Awesome jobs. It's a blockbuster month.
01:12:39.572 - 01:12:41.306, Speaker B: Tokens. God of tokens.
01:12:41.338 - 01:12:43.754, Speaker A: Head of tokens. Great. What a great name board of tokens.
01:12:43.802 - 01:12:46.334, Speaker B: Yeah. What's the Game of Thrones name? Master of coin.
01:12:46.382 - 01:12:49.346, Speaker A: Master of coin. Master of tokens. That's what I want.
01:12:49.448 - 01:13:11.994, Speaker B: Okay, a third immutable tweet that says October was a blockbuster month for community projects on immutable X. Us $30 million in us dollar trading fee volume gas free. 20 new NFT collections dropped. And then a link to a blog post with some of the most innovative nfts projects that dropped last month. Overall, immutable X is absolutely killing it. Congrats, guys.
01:13:12.112 - 01:13:22.286, Speaker A: We're about to find out what happens when you make blockspace virtually free. And you allow fiat on ramps on top of that as well, so you mainstream the user experience.
01:13:22.388 - 01:13:40.606, Speaker B: Earlier we were talking about Starknet and Starkware. Immutable X is built on Starkx, which is the pre version of Starknet. Again, that's a topic to go into the Starkware team, the show that we talked about with them also disclaimer Ryan and I are angel investors into one of the immutable seed rounds.
01:13:40.798 - 01:13:50.358, Speaker A: Absolutely. Bitcoin. Bitcoin news. The same news every week. Okay. El Salvador is buying 100 more bitcoins as the market falls. Buy the dip, man.
01:13:50.358 - 01:14:04.650, Speaker A: Buy the dip. El Salvador present doing that. So is Michael Saylor. So that's what happened last week and the week before. It's happening this week again. El Salvador and sailor buying the dip. I honestly, David, I think this is going to pay off for them.
01:14:04.650 - 01:14:22.110, Speaker A: Probably. Like, I don't hate it. It's going to pay off for them. It's just kind of funny to me that these are the things we're reporting week after week. It feels like we got paralyzed in time around February of this year and not much has happened in bitcoin land since.
01:14:22.180 - 01:14:26.580, Speaker B: Hey, but again, according to the bitcoiner value prop, that's the only thing that needs to happen.
01:14:27.110 - 01:14:27.874, Speaker A: All right.
01:14:27.992 - 01:14:37.218, Speaker B: It is kind of funny seeing El Salvador buying 100 more bitcoins and Michael Saylor coming in and buying 7005 more bitcoins. There are some difference in numbers there.
01:14:37.384 - 01:14:43.094, Speaker A: Yeah, well, Michael Saylor has the company. And Michael Saylor can never sell his.
01:14:43.132 - 01:14:53.658, Speaker B: Bitcoin because, a, he has way too much of it. And if he does start to sell it, it's going to start to signal to the market that this massive bitcoin whale. I don't know how much bitcoin Michael Saylor has.
01:14:53.664 - 01:15:10.218, Speaker A: I think it's over to sell it, though. If you believe in the monetization of bitcoin, right. Then you could just start using it. Just lend against it, borrow against. It's just collateral in the balance sheet. You never have to sell. And the thing is, his trade, he's getting basically free money because he's borrowing it from bonds.
01:15:10.394 - 01:15:11.120, Speaker B: Right?
01:15:12.770 - 01:15:27.890, Speaker A: This is sort of a nice little arbitrage. As long as bitcoin continues to appreciate in value, right. Funny to me that he hasn't looked at ether or some other alternatives out there at all. He's just laser eyed, focused.
01:15:28.330 - 01:15:52.540, Speaker B: Some quick stats is that microstrategy has bought $3.5 million worth of bitcoin that's currently clocking in at $6.8 billion. So almost a two x, they've got 121,000 bitcoins, which is roughly a little bit over half of the total. One half of 1% of the total supply of bitcoins. One day, maybe he turns that into WBTC because no one else will give him a loan on his bitcoins. And so he has.
01:15:54.770 - 01:16:19.842, Speaker A: Possible he might just buy a crypto bank, though, and do it himself. We'll see. China's crypto censorship is now reaching not just mining companies, of course, which have mass moved. There was a mass exodus of mining companies, proof of work, mining companies out of China, but now it's pouring into news outlets. So there's the banning of crypto media companies in China as well as they continue the crackdown. What are your thoughts?
01:16:19.906 - 01:16:43.066, Speaker B: Yeah, overall, China just slowly pushing out everything to do with crypto to their loss. I think it's pretty a reasonable claim to say that in the long term, 10, 15, 20 years, China will lose its power because of its pushing out of crypto. I think this is a catastrophic error on China that's going to come back to bite them in the butt maybe in 1520 years or so, something like that.
01:16:43.088 - 01:17:09.798, Speaker A: I think that's how the game theory works out. But this is why it's an acid test of how authoritarian your country is with respect to how it responds to crypto. Right. And so we're seeing this acid test play out in every government worldwide, and I don't think the US is immune. We'll see what the US continues to do with crypto. But, like China, which is a bit more authoritarian, top down, they are going all out banning crypto. Like, get it out of here.
01:17:09.798 - 01:17:32.890, Speaker A: And I think in the process, you're exactly right. They're being outplayed by crypto. This is a strategic mishap. But they have big aspirations for their money system, crypto and quotes money system. So we'll see how that plays out as well. Let's talk about Powell. He's redefining what he means by transitory inflation.
01:17:32.890 - 01:17:38.750, Speaker A: Do you remember this meme over the summer? Not inflation, it's just transitory inflation.
01:17:39.570 - 01:18:06.840, Speaker B: All the crypto people who are like, we, uh. I can't remember where I saw this, but something along the lines of, like, the Federal Reserve has finally admitted that inflation is finally here. And then there was, meanwhile, crypto Twitter a year ago, and there was that animation of the money printers going, Burt. And like, this anime girl, just like we were making memes about inflation a year ago. And finally, the Fed is like, yo, guys, I think inflation might be here.
01:18:07.530 - 01:18:29.818, Speaker A: He says he's done with the term. This is a quote from Jerome Powell. I think it's probably a good time to retire that term transitory and try to explain more clearly what we mean. And then he goes on to try to explain that it's not going to be so transitory after all. This is a meme I put out, David. I just thought it was funny. It's kind of like an onion style meme.
01:18:29.818 - 01:18:39.662, Speaker A: This is like breaking news. Powell clarifies transitory inflation from the perspective of our 13.8 billion year old universe. Humanity itself is transitory.
01:18:39.726 - 01:18:43.170, Speaker B: Yeah. What is transitory? This is relative. Everything's relative.
01:18:44.150 - 01:18:57.702, Speaker A: Everything's relative. Of course, transitory. Not so transitory after all. Congress is still holding hearings on crypto, this one with Coinbase, FTX, Paxos, some other crypto banks as well. What's happening here?
01:18:57.756 - 01:19:16.514, Speaker B: Centralized crypto banks being summoned to Congress for a centralized hearing from the centralized forms of government. But you know what's not? Anything DeFi related, because you can't summon DeFi. And that's the story there. Anyways, the government is looking at crypto more and more and more, so it's going to be interesting to see what is actually discussed at these hearings.
01:19:16.582 - 01:19:22.320, Speaker A: All right, guys, we're going to be back with the hot takes of the week, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
01:19:27.270 - 01:20:24.718, Speaker B: The Ave protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol on Ethereum, which allows users to supply and borrow certain crypto assets. Ave version two has a ton of cool features that makes using the Ave protocol even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can supply to the protocol in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have supplied collateral here, you can see me borrowing 200 USDC against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens. In ETH, I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock in that interest rate in permanently. V two also features the ability for users to swap collateral without having to withdraw their assets, trade them on Uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave.
01:20:24.718 - 01:20:57.386, Speaker B: With Ave, users can do this in one seamless transaction, saving you time and gas costs. Check out the power of Ave@ave.com. That's aave.com. Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange. I've been a customer of Gemini since I first got into crypto in 2017, and it's been my main exchange of choice to make my crypto buys and sells. Gemini is available in all 50 states and in over 50 countries worldwide. And on Gemini, there are markets for over 30 various different crypto assets, including many of the hot DFI tokens.
01:20:57.386 - 01:21:35.434, Speaker B: And it's one of the few exchanges that has liquid Dai markets. Gemini just launched their earn program, where you can earn up to 7.4% interest on 26 various crypto assets. If you're tired of paying fees in DFI or you don't want to worry about DFI exploits, but you still want to earn interest on your crypto assets, Gemini Earn is the product for you. Another product I'm stoked to get my hands on is the Gemini crypto back credit card, which gives you 3% cash back on all of your purchases, but paid to you in your preferred crypto asset. When I get my Gemini credit card, I'm going to make sure that I get my cash back in ETH. So whenever I buy something, I get a little bit of eth bonus back to me.
01:21:35.434 - 01:21:52.926, Speaker B: At the same time, you can open up a free account in under 3 minutes@gemini.com. Gobankless and if you trade more than $100 within the first 30 days after sign up, you'll be gifted a free $15 bitcoin bonus. Check them out@gemini.com. Gobankless all right, guys, we are back.
01:21:52.948 - 01:21:59.522, Speaker A: With the takes of the week. Let's start with this. Is this going to be the last time we talk about the Ethereum pre mine? David? Damn, I hope so.
01:21:59.576 - 01:22:00.082, Speaker B: No.
01:22:00.216 - 01:22:09.974, Speaker A: Okay. It's not going to be. This is a detailed pie chart of ETh Genesis allocations. Why don't you guide us through this and then maybe we can refer people to this clip when they ask the next time.
01:22:10.012 - 01:22:33.450, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's a bunch of different colors here. There's also 45.9 million ether that's been mined since the pre Genesis allocations. Everything else is the pre Genesis allocations. And then the $46 million ether that's also mined has been mined since the presale. So starting from the biggest to the smallest, a little over 60 million ether was sold, 60.1 million was acquired.
01:22:33.450 - 01:22:57.534, Speaker B: Ether was acquired by sending in 2014 by sending BTC to a widely publicized ether sale address. Again, no KYC, no registration, just sending in bitcoin to an address. The next largest slice, not including the mining, is allocation to early contributors. And those are people like the Ethereum co founders. I believe there was eight of them. That is 8.4 million of those as well.
01:22:57.534 - 01:23:34.942, Speaker B: And then 3.4 million ether got sent towards the EF, and that is the next largest slice. Today the EF only holds 350,000. So the EF has reduced their ether holdings by ten x one 10th is what they currently own of their initial distributions. And then the largest single recipient, vitalik Buterin, himself an accidental meme lord, received 696,900 ether from the Genesis event. I don't know how much he holds, but he's definitely distributed a bunch of his tokens to. Well, to me, Ryan, this seems very, very fair.
01:23:34.942 - 01:24:06.518, Speaker B: And this was the intent of the Ethereum presale. Over 50%. Well over 50%. It was something like 70, 75% of all ether at Genesis was sold freely and openly to the public without any sort of registration or KYC or private presale or whatever. Then we got the early contributors, like the eight ish. Maybe there's more of the Ethereum co founders and then the EF, the amount that was given away to the public, and it was only raised, like, they only raised like, $14 million, was like 75% of the total supply.
01:24:06.614 - 01:24:28.738, Speaker A: Yeah, and the allocation, early contributors wasn't just like co founders, it was just a whole slew of other workers. There were hundreds of different developers and people involved. Yeah. So what's interesting to me is some of the takeaways are okay, like 55% or so. Something around that range went to the presale of the total supply now, right?
01:24:28.824 - 01:24:32.450, Speaker B: Way more. Wait, are you talking about at the time of the sale or now?
01:24:32.520 - 01:24:46.994, Speaker A: Not now, in now supply terms. Right. If you just like, zoom out and look at the supply, and then you had another 40% or so, like 35 40% or so that were fairly distributed via proof of work mining.
01:24:47.122 - 01:24:49.654, Speaker B: I got some of those. Yeah, exactly.
01:24:49.852 - 01:24:52.230, Speaker A: That's part of the reason you came into crypto, right, David?
01:24:52.310 - 01:24:53.066, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
01:24:53.168 - 01:25:17.790, Speaker A: And a lot of other coins that start with proof of stake do not have this proof of work distribution for this period of time. There's a massive amount that was distributed this way. What's interesting to me, too, is you talk about the centralization of the Ethereum foundation. Some people do. I don't know if anyone does anymore. Look, man, they have like, 0.4% of supply, something like this, right? Like less than half a percent of the total supply.
01:25:17.790 - 01:25:25.730, Speaker A: Vitalik himself, right, after you dilute through all this proof of work, he's got far less than 1%. It's like point never had.
01:25:25.800 - 01:25:26.580, Speaker B: Never had.
01:25:28.330 - 01:26:14.686, Speaker A: In what world does the founder of a thing, of anything have that kind? If Satoshi was smart, he was mining bitcoin from inception, right? I'm sure he was okay. He probably had a far higher percentage. I mean, it's impossible to know. But if you look at Satoshi's addresses, that sort of thing, things that might be linked to him than Vitalik does of like Michael Saylor owns more freaking bitcoin than Vitalik owns of the supply of ether. So I don't know, I guess this is maybe the last time we talk about this. It just seems to me like such a, the pre mine thing seems like such a non issue to me. Looks like a pretty fair distribution.
01:26:14.798 - 01:27:06.034, Speaker B: And for the newer listeners, the pre mine presale thing has really just ticked off a lot of bitcoiners who are able to contrast it with the whole fair launch of bitcoin. But fair is just relative. It's really just a subjective argument as to what is fair or not. So you really have to do your own critical thinking and ask yourself what is fair? And then the other side of this is the whole VC chains and the way that they got bootstrapped, really the hot ones, the ones that we were talking about last week, are the avalanche and Solana chains, where far greater, like two thirds of the supply was sold in private presales to financially well capitalized VC firms. In that, my mind, when we talk about public permissionless blockchains with public open money as a public utility, that is extremely unfair. And so there is these differences. The first impressions of these chains are really, really important.
01:27:06.034 - 01:27:15.960, Speaker B: And I think that the way that Ethereum, the ether distribution happened from day one and then what happened with proof of work mining over the next six years is as fair as we could have ever have hoped for.
01:27:16.650 - 01:27:27.126, Speaker A: Can probably only happen one time. Know once you do it ever after. Icos were kind of diluted. Here's a take two. David. Optimism is ethereum. Arbitrum is ethereum.
01:27:27.126 - 01:27:57.442, Speaker A: Starkware is ethereum. ZK sync is ethereum. Immutable is ethereum. Why? Because Ethereum is the chain of chains. When we were looking at transactions last week, the total transaction throughput of Ethereum from that website, I can't recall off the top of my head, but I'd like to talk about it maybe next week a little bit and roll ups just shows you that the total transaction throughput of Ethereum is not just what happens on Mainnet, it's what happens on Mainet. Plus, optimism. Arbitrum, Starquare, zkSync, immutable.
01:27:57.442 - 01:28:38.686, Speaker A: All of these things, if they're secured by Ethereum, are Ethereum. It's like California, Texas, Nevada, all of these things. They're different states, but they're all part of the United States, right? And so when we talk about the US being a union of states, Ethereum is like a union of chains. It's the Ethereum union, it's the EU Ethereum, the chain of chains. I think that's important for people to start understanding that more of this activity is going to happen in L2s. And Ethereum will be the main net, at least will be a settlement layer of all of these chains. But the entire collection of these chains will also be Ethereum.
01:28:38.798 - 01:29:21.662, Speaker B: The Ethereum union, the website that Ryan was talking about is ethps info, if you want to check that out. The other cool thing is that you can actually deploy roll ups on top of roll ups, and then you can deploy roll ups on top of those roll ups. So you can deploy roll ups all the way down and think of just like a gigantic fractal root system or just like branches of a tree where these roll ups spin off of roll ups spin off of roll ups because of. Why not? And eventually everything settles down down to the very base protocol, the Ethereum protocol. So no wonder gas fees are so incredibly high. The weight of all l two s are pushing pressure on the gas fees on l one. That's why users got to get off the l one and go to l two s.
01:29:21.662 - 01:29:33.902, Speaker B: Shout out to everyone that played borderlands two. The lava is rising meme. That one's a big one in that community. The lava is rising on layer one. You got to get off. You got to get off at some point.
01:29:34.036 - 01:29:40.520, Speaker A: Yeah, main chain is lava. Say it again. It's Brantley again. Hey, Bradley, what's he saying?
01:29:40.890 - 01:30:15.066, Speaker B: Brantley says things I expect to see with daos. Dao splits, daos firing people, hostile takeovers, governance attacks, cross dow coalitions. Dows going bankrupt, lawsuits against Dows. Dows reorguing to cut people out, quote, going centralized, like going private, dows merging with acquiring other dows. Basically the same exact behavior that we have seen throughout all of human, just organizational efforts. But now we're just doing it in dows, because again, daos are nothing new under the sun. They're just humans organizing in a different vehicle in a different way, this time on Ethereum, this time with tokens.
01:30:15.066 - 01:30:22.274, Speaker B: And so these same sort of behaviors that we've seen before are probably going to play out again. At least that's what token Brantley is saying.
01:30:22.472 - 01:30:30.966, Speaker A: Well, then it begs the question, are daos any different than corporations then? Are corporate organizations, in some ways they.
01:30:30.988 - 01:30:34.520, Speaker B: Are a complete paradigm shift, and in others, they are exactly the same.
01:30:35.210 - 01:30:52.246, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's the right take. I think that's a good take. And I do hope we can invent some things that are different from a governance perspective as well as we go on. But a lot of what we've seen is less dow, I guess, in more digital organization.
01:30:52.438 - 01:31:03.120, Speaker B: Grant Lee, he follows up saying, we are currently living in the golden age, in an early, naive golden age of daos, when none of the above has really happened yet, but it will. The next decade is going to be fun.
01:31:04.370 - 01:31:05.182, Speaker A: It's a good take.
01:31:05.236 - 01:31:19.560, Speaker B: Oh, and then somebody also responded saying, this has actually already happened with steemit, which is a different, was once a blockchain, and there was this attempted hostile takeover by Justin's son. And then the steemit dao was like, yoinked his funds by forking themselves.
01:31:20.890 - 01:31:28.182, Speaker A: The ability to fork is definitely a new governance paradigm shift. I think it's true. Let's talk about this squish chaos. What's he saying?
01:31:28.236 - 01:31:56.798, Speaker B: Squish chaos. L two s or l ones, is the entire crypto bet. Right now, you may think you're betting on eth, but really you're betting on ZK, sync, starkware, arbitrum and optimism. Or alternatively, you may be thinking that you're betting on avalanche or salana, but really you're betting on the multichain l one. I thought this was really, really good take. I agree there needs to be many, many blockchains. And as I've said, I've said before where I kind of think the whole multichain world is going to start to mean multichain on Ethereum.
01:31:56.798 - 01:32:44.682, Speaker B: Multi l two s. And these l two s will be bridged by things like connects and hop and all these other cross chain liquidity providers. Or you can bet on the multilayer one ecosystem where you have Salana and avalanche and Ethereum and bitcoin, and then maybe something like Polkadot or Cosmos is like the connecting layer. I think listeners know where I've placed my bets. I'm betting that it's easier to actually just implement L2s on one single chain and that allow that one chain to optimize for decentralization. And the reason why is because in a multi l one world, you have multisig bridges, whereas in a L2 world that's all built on one single l one, you have the world of cryptographically secured roll ups. And remember, this industry is about cryptography.
01:32:44.682 - 01:33:13.050, Speaker B: At the end of the day, not multisigs. Remember to listen to our Rune Christensen podcast where we went through the full game theory, unpacking the differences between an l two world and a multi sig side chain world. One is just way better, way more efficient, way more liquid. And in that world, only one chain needs to focus on decentralization. And that one chain can sell its decentralization to every single other layer, two via roll ups. And that is Ethereum.
01:33:13.550 - 01:33:59.718, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a really interesting take. Right? The other side of this take is like. So first of all, I wonder if people realize that this is actually what they're betting. Okay. Like when they purchase eth or when they purchase avalanche. The second thing I wonder about this is, do you think it's a good bet to bet on Zksync and Starquare and arbitrum and optimism? Because squish is also right when he's saying that a bet on Ethereum and eth, the asset etH, is actually outsourcing its execution layer to all of these other chains. And so that means these roll up chains will own the user experience.
01:33:59.718 - 01:34:17.920, Speaker A: They'll own the fiat onboarding. It's like almost, in a way, giving up a lot of control that it had previously in its monolithic model. And is that a safe bet, is the question, because now Ethereum is more dependent on these other chains to carry it forward. What's your take on that?
01:34:18.850 - 01:34:54.410, Speaker B: It's kind of like whack a mole, where maybe one l two doesn't work, but you can have many, many l two s. Right? Not all of them have to work for Ethereum to be successful. But if you're betting on avalanche, and DC investor follows this take up saying, well, squish says, if you're betting on avalanche, you're actually betting on a multichain world. And DC investor says, well, if you're betting on avalanche, no, you're actually just betting on avalanche. There can be a multichain future where avalanche doesn't succeed. And so, yeah, many, many l two s can come, Ryan, and then not work. But Ethereum, the l one, can still work because only some of the l two s need to work.
01:34:54.410 - 01:35:06.960, Speaker B: Whereas if you're betting on l ones, you are making a very specific bet upon a specific l one. When you bet on Ethereum, you're not betting on a specific l two. You're embedding on the concept of l two s at large.
01:35:07.330 - 01:35:29.698, Speaker A: Yeah, I've been obsessed recently, David, about this analogy between the United States and ethereum with the idea of a union of states, basically, think of every single roll up as a different. Right. And when I say state, I'm talking about a state in the United States. Right. So it has its own set of laws. It has kind of its own heavily.
01:35:29.794 - 01:35:31.766, Speaker B: Skewed towards state rights, by the way.
01:35:31.868 - 01:36:05.854, Speaker A: Exactly. And it has its own jurisdiction. And where do people move? Well, they just move to a state where good laws, decent taxes, reasonable taxes, good services and lots of jobs. Right. So the population migrates from state to state, and the economic output of the United States is just an amalgamation, an aggregation of the economic output of all of its individual 50 states. Isn't that interesting? And some states have done better than others, right? Economically or from a variety of other factors, depending on how you measure the metrics. But you got 50 separate experiments.
01:36:05.854 - 01:36:33.462, Speaker A: That's what's happening with Ethereum, is basically like, all of these roll ups will have their own experiments, but the economic output of all of these roll ups will actually end up partially in etH, the asset eth as the money and the store of value and the chief utility across all of these states, too. Yeah, I'm obsessed with that analogy. Anyway, love it won't be the end of it. Kyle Davies fundamentals are a joke.
01:36:33.526 - 01:36:40.586, Speaker B: Kyle Davies from three arrows capital, which is the entity that was kind of the subject of a lot of the ir, the Ethereum community last week.
01:36:40.608 - 01:36:42.074, Speaker A: Yeah, he said fundamentals are a joke.
01:36:42.122 - 01:37:11.954, Speaker B: Fundamentals are a joke. And granted, we just talked about Omicron, this token that has nothing to do with COVID or anything, pumping people and people. Yeah, dogecoin, for that matter. So granted, there are a lot of things that are pumping that don't have any fundamentals, but in my mind, you can't just say that fundamentals are a joke. That's equivalent in my mind of saying real life is a joke. Like fundamentals are based in real life. And so I followed up and says, and I said nothing matters, said the nihilist.
01:37:11.954 - 01:37:15.282, Speaker B: And then Katal Davies response to me, long live the memes.
01:37:15.426 - 01:37:17.090, Speaker A: So he's agreeing, nothing matters.
01:37:17.170 - 01:37:29.366, Speaker B: Yeah. And then I go without fundamentals, memes are just fads. Memes with fundamentals, however, can last forever. I'm acknowledging the power of memes, but what's even more powerful is memes that are backed by fundamentals.
01:37:29.558 - 01:37:32.682, Speaker A: Totally agree with those takes. Yeah, I totally agree.
01:37:32.816 - 01:37:34.614, Speaker B: There's a reason why we do a podcast together, Ryan.
01:37:34.662 - 01:38:04.386, Speaker A: I know, man. Look, I think it also depends on your time horizon, right? So it's like, that's another way to say the same thing. Fundamentals are a joke in the short run, but they matter a lot in the long run. Try to survive a bear cycle on just memes alone and narratives alone, right? No, you go back down to the base, you boil it all down to the fundamentals, and then you rebuild conviction without fundamentals. I don't think a trader needs to have conviction. That's the thing. It's just back to the Ryan Selkus tweets.
01:38:04.386 - 01:38:18.346, Speaker A: Like everyone's arguing, and they're just arguing about timelines and time horizons rather than actual substantive issues. David, this is your take. I'm going to read it out. Eth is the best way to get exposure to the metaverse. Nothing else comes close.
01:38:18.528 - 01:39:00.214, Speaker B: Yeah, so the metaverse, if you guys remember listening to our metaverse defined podcast, which you should definitely go back and listen to, the metaverse isn't one thing. The metaverse is not going to be having exposure by Facebook stock or Decentraland or sandbox token. The metaverse is going to be a collection of very many different micrometa verses. The overall aggregate metaverse is going to be a collection of many, many different things. The only way that I see possible to actually have direct exposure to the growth of the metaverse is with ether. Because ether is metaverse money. I think in hindsight, in 2030, people will look at Ethereum while we see it as a parallel financial system.
01:39:00.214 - 01:39:44.786, Speaker B: People in 2030 will see Ethereum as the metaverse, the thing that supports the single shared registry of all known objects in the metaverse. And ether will be metaverse money, because it will be the liquidity currency for all of these objects. I think ether, as the asset, is going to track the growth of the metaverse far better than any other asset possible. And that includes the MVI, sorry, index co op people. That includes the MVI metaverse index fund. Because the problem with that is that you actually have to put in metaverse assets into the metaverse index. But after they're established, after some of them have grown, and they're not going to be able to capture all of the growth of the metaverse by definition, because it is reactive rather than being proactive.
01:39:44.786 - 01:40:00.394, Speaker B: Where ether already exists today, and we know that the metaverse will exist tomorrow. Therefore, you can buy ether today on the back of the growth of the metaverse. If you want to have exposure to the metaverse, buy the money that people are going to use in the metaverse. It's that simple.
01:40:00.592 - 01:40:27.006, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's that simple as well. And look, man, I'm going to go back to my us analogy one more time. Okay, one more time. This podcast, right? So if you want economic exposure to the United States in the 19 hundreds, it would have been a bad play to just buy the dollar and t bills or something. Treasuries, right? But it would have been a good play to buy some of those things. Maybe. But also the SP, like all of the companies that are big.
01:40:27.006 - 01:40:41.318, Speaker A: And that's kind of what you're getting with e, right? You're getting exposure to the economic output of Ethereum and all of its nation states and the entire metaverse, right? And you're getting an index level performance of that.
01:40:41.404 - 01:40:44.486, Speaker B: ETH is an index of everything that's happening on top of Ethereum.
01:40:44.598 - 01:40:48.826, Speaker A: Pretty much. Pretty much. All right, dave, it's that time. What are you excited about this week, man?
01:40:49.008 - 01:41:21.430, Speaker B: Yesterday, last night I recorded a layer zero with Justin Aversano. Justin is the photographer behind the Twin Flames project. And man, was that guy's story really cool. I usually slate out 90 minutes for these episodes, but we almost went for 2 hours just because the story wasn't over by the time we hit the end. Justin has this insanely cool story where he's connecting his. I don't want to spoil too much of it. His mom died of ovarian cancer right after he started getting into photography.
01:41:21.430 - 01:42:08.502, Speaker B: One of the reasons why his mom had ovarian cancer is because he lost his twin in the womb. And he also made this twin project which he took 100 pictures of 100 different twins all over the world and got into the world of NFTs by selling this project. There's so much more to the story. It's a crazy story, and this story is one of the reasons why I started doing layer Zeros in the first place, to get some of these stories out. And the cool thing about this is that Layer Zeros, I started with people like Vitalik's dad, Dimitri, and Eric Connor, who has been with Ethereum since day one, and Danny Ryan and Tim Baco, all the protocol people. But I also want to talk to the people that didn't care about Ethereum but got pulled into Ethereum because something about Ethereum changed their life. And that's what happened on next week's episode of Layer Zero.
01:42:08.502 - 01:42:10.822, Speaker B: So do not miss that one. It was a great story.
01:42:10.956 - 01:42:19.830, Speaker A: That's hype, man. That's great. I'm looking forward to that. You are a cryptocultural anthropologist is sort of what layer zero is.
01:42:19.900 - 01:42:21.030, Speaker B: I have a ton of fun doing them.
01:42:21.100 - 01:42:22.742, Speaker A: Surfacing these stories. Yeah.
01:42:22.876 - 01:42:28.778, Speaker B: Layer zeros are just some of my favorites because I just pull someone into Zoom and they just tell me a story for an hour and a half, and I'm like, oh, yeah.
01:42:28.784 - 01:42:31.802, Speaker A: It's like, no prep. You just have a conversation. It's nice.
01:42:31.856 - 01:42:33.370, Speaker B: What are you excited about this week, Ryan?
01:42:33.790 - 01:43:11.370, Speaker A: I was just thankful for, like, two days of rest. I got off screens, had some fun in real life, just hanging out with my family over Thanksgiving. And just, like, sometimes we forget real life is good. Do you know? Like, we're digital all the time, but real life matters. But there's always this counterforce in crypto, and I don't know if you're the same way, David, but it's always like, what did you like? I missed a couple days. What did I miss? Did I miss any alpha? Did I miss any opportunities? And the truth is, if you're away for too long in crypto, you will miss out on some opportunities, right. But then you have to reevaluate what's important in your life.
01:43:11.370 - 01:43:30.110, Speaker A: And I think it was important for me to remind myself, this crypto thing is a marathon. It's not a sprint. You don't have to be first on every single opportunity. You don't have to get the alpha from day one. Right? It's like, don't play that game. Don't exhaust yourself that way. There's no way to live.
01:43:30.110 - 01:44:17.358, Speaker A: And then what's really important, and wealth is not the most important thing at the end of the day, I think Kevin Owaki said it's like, optimize for freedom. We're optimizing for freedom here, not wealth. Right. And it's like, if you're a slave to your screen, if you're a slave to crypto prices, blockfolio, that's not, you know, so, like, reevaluate what wealth actually is, and you make sure you're looking at it through the lens of freedom was sort of another thing I kind of took away from a couple of days of rest. And the other thing is always important to remember is, like, comparison is the thief of joy. Okay. There's always going to be someone who's doing better, right? You ever play a video game like fortnite or something? There's always someone who is just ten times better than you.
01:44:17.358 - 01:44:38.582, Speaker A: They always will be. Just enjoy the game, though. You don't have to be as good as that. You don't have to be first in crypto. You don't have to get every 100 x upside that you see. So it's just a time to reflect and help me stay grounded and realize maybe this is a message someone needs to hear today. Stop chasing all the time.
01:44:38.582 - 01:44:55.466, Speaker A: Just enjoy the ride and have fun. That's what this is about. And I hope this year has been like that for you. When it's not, just zoom out and reevaluate, realize what's important, because those are the things that are important, at least to me. And it helped me realize that the.
01:44:55.488 - 01:45:22.958, Speaker B: Story of the progression of crypto is going to last for our entire lifetimes. So you have to sustain yourself so you can watch that story unfold. Because to me, this is just one of the best movies ever that's ever happened, which is the story of crypto. And the cool thing about this movie is that it's going to last 60, 70, 80 years, however long I do the whole time. So, again, you got to sustain yourself, because like you said, it's a marathon, not a sprint.
01:45:23.054 - 01:45:25.794, Speaker A: There you go, guys. That's the message. All right, meme of the week.
01:45:25.832 - 01:45:26.306, Speaker B: Meme of the week.
01:45:26.328 - 01:45:30.200, Speaker A: Meme time. David, this is a Thanksgiving meme, too. Good timing on this.
01:45:31.770 - 01:46:03.694, Speaker B: I said this is a tweet. I said GM to you, if this was you. And then in 2017, we have that crypto dude at Thanksgiving. And this is Charlie from always sunny in the Philadelphia doing the whole crazy eyes, connecting all the different crazy things, like, oh, the crypto is going to change the world. It's amazing. But he looked absolutely insane doing it. And then in 2021, we have this royalty guy looking over the banister of some deck with dressed in some royal looking stuff, just very superior looking.
01:46:03.694 - 01:46:09.314, Speaker B: And the label is 2021. So if you were the crypto crazy guy in 2017, and then you also.
01:46:09.352 - 01:46:10.334, Speaker A: Felt you're now royal.
01:46:10.382 - 01:46:14.050, Speaker B: Very proven in 2021. GM to you.
01:46:14.200 - 01:46:21.174, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. That's very much what it felt like in 2017 versus 2021. Do you know where this image is from the second one?
01:46:21.212 - 01:46:21.878, Speaker B: I do not.
01:46:21.964 - 01:46:30.310, Speaker A: All right, fun fact. I won't tell you. I know from the Twilight movies. David, I'm embarrassed. I know that. I'm embarrassed. I know that these are the vampires in the Twilight movies.
01:46:31.210 - 01:46:32.542, Speaker B: We should cut that out, Brian.
