00:00:02.970 - 00:00:55.610, Speaker A: Welcome to Bankless, where we explore the frontier of Internet money and Internet finance. And sometimes that frontier is at a conference like last weekend, where over a thousand developers, founders, builders, and investors attended the Starkware sessions in Tel Aviv in order to participate in growing the StarkNet ecosystem. This is Bankless's Starkware Session series, which are nine bite sized episodes interviewing the founders, builders, and ecosystem developers of StarkNet. Every once in a while in the crypto world, a conference happens, but not everyone is available to attend. Don't worry, Bankless has your back, because I go to basically every conference that's out on the frontier, and I bring an entire podcast studio in tow with me in order to make sure that the Bankless nation stays on the frontier of what's happening in crypto. In this interview, we are talking to Gregor from Onlydust Now. Only Dust is an application on StarkNet to help developers start building in Starkware using StarkNet.
00:00:55.610 - 00:01:20.038, Speaker A: It's like a developer bounty board, a kiosk. There's jobs for you to go do. And this is perhaps an entry point for getting started in building in the world of StarkNet. There is money associated with this. So if you are a developer looking to make money while also growing your knowledge base about StarkNet, this episode is for you. So let's go ahead and get right into it. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make the show possible.
00:01:20.038 - 00:02:12.754, Speaker A: Kraken has been around for almost as long as crypto itself. As crazy as crypto is, kraken has remained a rock for its clients, building out a platform designed to stand the test of time. Kraken is all about proof, not promises, which is why they've pioneered a Proof of Reserves, a system that lets Kraken's customers verify for themselves the solvency and responsibility of the Kraken exchange. And for this reason and many more, we've chosen Kraken as Bankless's strategic sponsor for 2023. And once you're done using Kraken to get your dirty fiat money into pristine crypto assets, perhaps you should check out Arbitrum, where so much of the frontier of crypto innovation is taking place. Arbitrum just announced their Stylus initiative, which is their brand new programming environment that lets developers deploy apps using their favorite programming languages like Rust, C C alongside regular old solidity EVM apps. Devs can use any coding language they like, and it simultaneously dropped layer two fees by an order of magnitude.
00:02:12.754 - 00:02:49.554, Speaker A: It's a big deal so many of your favorite DFI apps have already deployed to Arbitrum, like Uniswap. But did you know that Uniswap isn't just for ERC 20 Tokens anymore? Uniswap is also an NFT aggregator, too. To make sure that you are getting the best price on your NFT purchases, uniswap gives NFT collectors and traders powerful tools, all from the cozy comfy Uniswap interface. By the way. It's also got a native fiat onramp it's also deployed on like every layer two. And it's got this nifty cool thing called a universal router that ensures that you always get the best price on your trades. Crypto protocols like Arbitrum and Uniswap are becoming super powerful, so make sure that you're also using a wallet that's equally as powerful or else you'll be missing out.
00:02:49.554 - 00:03:12.642, Speaker A: If you're looking to upgrade your wallet experience, check out Phantom, the number one wallet of Solana, which has recently come to both Ethereum and polygon. Phantom has native NFT support, giving you your own NFT gallery from inside the wallet. Phantom is both a browser extension and a mobile wallet and is also the only wallet to span both the Solana and Ethereum ecosystems. Check it out at phantom app. And now let's get into the Interview Bangladesh.
00:03:12.706 - 00:03:18.122, Speaker B: And we are back in Tel Aviv for the Starquare Sessions. And today we're talking with Gregor of what's your project called?
00:03:18.176 - 00:03:18.742, Speaker C: Only Dust.
00:03:18.806 - 00:03:20.502, Speaker B: Only Dust? How'd you come up with only dust?
00:03:20.566 - 00:03:43.026, Speaker C: I think to create stars, you need Only Dust. So it's like all developers of a community are just little Just dust. But with them we can create stars, we can create new ecosystem and just wonderful. It's a little joke because it's like a nodi, it's overdose. And in French is poodro de parna papa. It's a private joke for French, but yes.
00:03:43.128 - 00:03:45.090, Speaker B: Okay, so what does only dust do?
00:03:45.160 - 00:04:19.402, Speaker C: Onlydust it's a peer to peer grant platform, so we have the money of the foundation within Only Dust, and all developers can grant each other. So it's not like a committee, a borrowing committee with some paperwork. It's a developer with like, okay, I like your job, I want to grant you. Some old developers are granting each other, and it's very effective and it has a very strong network effect because developer onboard their friends who onboard their friends, and it's working very well and it's all transparent. So we have no fraud on the platform. It's just completely amazing, completely community driven.
00:04:19.546 - 00:04:30.174, Speaker B: So this is perhaps a little bit like Gitcoin in the sense that it's a grants platform, but it's different from Gitcoin in that projects on StarkNet are giving grants to other projects on StarkNet.
00:04:30.222 - 00:04:50.390, Speaker C: Is that right? Exactly. And in the same repository on GitHub, a project can give grants to other contributors and a lead can. For example, if a developer sees an amazing opportunity with a good developer, he can grant another developer and this developer can grant developer on his repository. So it's just contributor granting contributors. Yes.
00:04:50.460 - 00:04:56.106, Speaker B: So if a developer is interested by StarkNet, but they don't know where to go, perhaps this is a place to get started.
00:04:56.208 - 00:05:39.974, Speaker C: Is that fair? I think it's the best place. And we are working right now, we will work with the Eternal Foundation, and a lot of other blockchain are coming to us because we have a very strong growth and it's working very well. So I think when we are talking with foundation, a lot of foundation, we're like, we don't want to have a grant program because it's not effective, it's not cost efficient. And when we see our results on our community are like, I want to do this, I need this. And for example, it's a bit strange because I was in a meeting with a big foundation and we're like, so we have a business model, we have a tech rate on all grant. And we're like, you need to increase your price. What the fuck? I have a 50% take rate.
00:05:39.974 - 00:05:53.370, Speaker C: We're like, no, 20 on 25 minimum. So yes, it's amazing to see this kind of product market pin, because grant program has a long history of failure, according to me. And we are reinventing this with the community for the open source. So it's very cool.
00:05:53.520 - 00:05:56.314, Speaker B: Okay, where does the money come from for the grants?
00:05:56.362 - 00:06:23.590, Speaker C: A foundation of companies. For example, StarkNet Foundation is our biggest grant right now, and we are very happy to work with them. And for example, a company like Cartridge, so I think you have interviewed them, they're like, okay, we can give you some money because we want to support this kind of open source project. For example, Toyota is another sponsor of this event. We're like, okay, we will give you 100 or 200K for this kind of project. So we have private company and we have big foundation.
00:06:24.010 - 00:06:30.890, Speaker B: Okay, so is this a way for this is not specific to the StarkNet Foundation, right?
00:06:30.960 - 00:06:31.242, Speaker C: No.
00:06:31.296 - 00:06:38.406, Speaker B: So you guys are your own independent company that's meant to facilitate grants inside of the StarkNet ecosystem.
00:06:38.518 - 00:06:55.570, Speaker C: Yes, it's an open source ecosystem. So right now it's StarkNet, but open source, if it's open source, it can be funded. For example, the STARnet Foundation right now with us is funded non STARnet Project because we think it's a receipt for the public goods. So it's the new way to fund public goods, we think.
00:06:55.640 - 00:07:00.366, Speaker B: But a lot of the money for grants does come from the StarkNet.
00:07:00.558 - 00:07:02.130, Speaker C: Yes. Right now it's okay. Yes.
00:07:02.200 - 00:07:08.186, Speaker B: Okay. And so it's a way to distribute value from the StarkNet Foundation to the rest of the ecosystem.
00:07:08.318 - 00:07:11.078, Speaker C: Totally, yes. And it scales very well.
00:07:11.164 - 00:07:22.162, Speaker B: And so teams inside of the StarkNet ecosystem can get bootstrapped because they're getting financial resources from the StarkNet Foundation, but it's getting allocated by onlydust.
00:07:22.306 - 00:07:28.442, Speaker C: Yes, not by onlydus. It's with only dust platform, right? Yes, but by developer. Yes, exactly.
00:07:28.576 - 00:07:34.346, Speaker B: Okay, so say I'm Argent, how would I use only Dust and what would I use it for?
00:07:34.368 - 00:08:09.190, Speaker C: They come to us and say, okay, for this type of project, for this type of feature, it's open source, we want to have contributors. And we're like, okay, let's go. We push the project on a platform. We have a lot of contributors, like, I want to work on this project. We introduce them to Argent, they begin to work on GitHub, and at the end of the week, the lead of Argent, we say, okay, I want to pay this contributor, this kind of one grand or $1,000, $2,000, this 1200, this one. Exactly. And Olwick is doing that.
00:08:09.190 - 00:08:44.814, Speaker C: And at the end of the budget of the Argent, there is some developer who are saying, okay, what we are doing with urgent and over contributor on this repository, it's so cool. We want that. They need to have more money. So they click on a button on our product and they have more money and more money and more money if it's not cool, if it's not useful, and if other contributors think that it's not very well executed, for example, they have no more money. So it's very violent because sometimes the project just ends because there is not enough quality, not enough value for the ecosystem.
00:08:44.942 - 00:08:54.178, Speaker B: And so how do teams like Argent or other projects that are building on StarkNet, how do they get money from the foundation? Do they have to apply for a grant from the foundation?
00:08:54.274 - 00:09:24.590, Speaker C: No, sometimes they are director with the foundation, but when they talk with us, they just have to talk with other developers, so they don't talk to the foundation. So we have some, for example, Teodo or Quadratic, they are building on StarkNet and they didn't talk to a member of the foundation. They are just talking with developer of the community. So for the foundation it's very cool because they don't have to talk to every company and if they want to have a specific interaction with the company, they contact them. But normally they don't have to talk to the foundation.
00:09:25.570 - 00:09:29.598, Speaker B: Okay, but the developers don't have to talk to the foundation. But someone talks to the foundation.
00:09:29.694 - 00:10:01.850, Speaker C: US. Just you. Because yes, we have an annual contract with the foundation and we have a dashboard with all the results, all the developer, all the contributors, all the churn developer. It's like the developer report you see, but for the STARnet ecosystem and it's actualized it's day to day and they see this data and they are like okay, we like what we see. So we give you more money and more money and more money. So right now we have a contract for 2023 and we will negotiate a contract for 2024. And so we are negotiating for the Wall eco system with the foundation.
00:10:02.010 - 00:10:13.278, Speaker B: So this is like onlydas is like a kiosk of jobs for the StarkNet ecosystem. And as a developer you can go to this kiosk like oh, that job looks cool.
00:10:13.364 - 00:10:40.630, Speaker C: It's not job, this project is cool, I want to work on this project. It's not job, it's not boonti's, it's project. So you apply to a project, you go in a telegram group, you talk with our developer, you merge some peer on GitHub and you are paid for this. But there is no job, it's project centric. We have tried the bounty centric approach. It was devastating because yes, bounty, I think don't work.
00:10:40.700 - 00:10:45.706, Speaker B: Right, okay, amazing. So I'm a developer I'm interested in getting started. Where do I go?
00:10:45.808 - 00:10:58.960, Speaker C: You go to our website. You see all the projects you can contact directly. The developer in charge of the grant of the project. You talk with him. You go in this instagram group you work, and at the end of the week you are paid.
00:10:59.650 - 00:11:01.118, Speaker B: How much am I paid?
00:11:01.284 - 00:11:12.274, Speaker C: Normally it's $500 a day. It could be more if you are more expensive. It could be less if you are a junior developer. But it's your lead, the lead project of the developer, of the open source project.
00:11:12.392 - 00:11:17.410, Speaker B: We will decide and what kind of jobs are available, what kind of gigs.
00:11:17.910 - 00:11:44.014, Speaker C: Right now we have a lot of, for example, some smart contract developer in Ko. We have a need for data scientist, we need Rust developer, a lot of rest developer front. So there's a lot of need. Right now we have 45 project open source projects and we are growing very fast. We have 300 developer. And so if you come, it's impossible to not find a good project. And if you don't find the good project right now, just contact us.
00:11:44.014 - 00:11:47.982, Speaker C: And I have a team dedicated to this. They just make the introduction. Awesome.
00:11:48.036 - 00:11:49.134, Speaker B: And what's the website?
00:11:49.332 - 00:11:51.550, Speaker C: Onlydust XYZ.
00:11:51.890 - 00:11:53.082, Speaker B: Onlydust XYZ?
00:11:53.146 - 00:11:53.662, Speaker C: Yes. Awesome.
00:11:53.716 - 00:11:55.054, Speaker B: Great word. Thank you so much.
00:11:55.092 - 00:11:55.930, Speaker C: Thank you very much. Cheers.
