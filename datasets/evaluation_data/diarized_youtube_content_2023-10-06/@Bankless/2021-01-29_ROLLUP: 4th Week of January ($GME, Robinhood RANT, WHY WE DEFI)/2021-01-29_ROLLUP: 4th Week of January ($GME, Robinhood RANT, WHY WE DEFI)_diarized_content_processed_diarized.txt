00:00:08.010 - 00:00:13.822, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Happy Friday morning. Welcome to the fourth week of January. David, how are you doing today?
00:00:13.956 - 00:00:31.046, Speaker B: I am fired up today. We have a lot of things to talk about. So much news. We are going to do something a little bit different this episode. I know a lot of people, including myself, want to talk and hear about GameStop and all of that. Just that massive amounts of news. There's so much to talk about.
00:00:31.046 - 00:01:03.054, Speaker B: There's so much to peel back. What we are doing in this particular weekly roll ups, we are putting the very last section, the section about what David and Ryan are excited about. That is going to be we are only going to talk about GameStop. We're going to talk about GameStop for like 20 minutes. And the reason why we're doing that is so that we can go through the weekly roll ups as we usually do it. We don't have to bother about touching GameStop because we're going to touch on all of the GameStop topics at the very end. It's going to be a normal weekly roll up up until that point, and it's going to be our normal PG weekly roll up up until that point.
00:01:03.054 - 00:01:14.146, Speaker B: But like I said, I am fired up. So if you got kids in the car, if you listen with your kids around, maybe listen to the GameStop section of this episode at a different time because there might be some swear words.
00:01:14.248 - 00:01:26.802, Speaker A: There you go. Things are going to get kind of spicy, kind of weird near the end of this weekly roll up. But David, let's get started with the typical. We always start with market. What is going on in the market? Should we talk about bitcoin?
00:01:26.946 - 00:01:52.698, Speaker B: Yeah, bitcoin is hanging around in the low 30,000 range, ranging between. It actually got below 30,000 a couple of times in the last week, but didn't stay there for very long. Kind of staying within $30 to $34,000, consolidating at what is still a relatively high price. Pretty far off of its all time high of $42,000, but doing a good job maintaining that $30,000 floor.
00:01:52.794 - 00:02:01.954, Speaker A: When there's a dip, people always question. They always ask, well, are we going back to all time high, below all time high? Do you have any takes on that or are you just kind of a wait and see?
00:02:02.072 - 00:02:22.330, Speaker B: Yeah, I think bitcoin at this point is growing a pretty strong allergy to anything in a $20,000 range. I think we could flirt with it a few more times. I think bitcoin is actually going to be relatively quiet for perhaps even all of q one. I think we're going to find $30,000 bitcoin to be an extremely comfortable number.
00:02:22.480 - 00:02:28.970, Speaker A: Okay, well, let's talk about some other numbers. Eth price. We hit a new all time high. Did we just say that?
00:02:29.040 - 00:02:42.974, Speaker B: Yeah, last week we said that. I think we're three weeks in a row of ETH all time highs. First it was 1440, then it was like 1460, and then it was 1490. Still having resistance around the 1400 level.
00:02:43.172 - 00:02:52.340, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, let's see if we can continue that trend, David. I'm kind of liking it. Let's all time high next week, too. What about DFI? What's going on there? Is it DFI season yet?
00:02:52.870 - 00:03:16.378, Speaker B: I think it could be. Things are really heating up with DFI tokens. The DPI index, the token that tracks all of DFI. Well, most of DFI, the top ten DFI assets, is at an all time high of $291, as well as the value locked in, DFI is at an all time high of 26 and a half billion dollars. DFI doing really well.
00:03:16.544 - 00:03:48.366, Speaker A: Well, let's talk about DFI versus ether, because we always approach sort of bitcoin but also ether as kind of a reserve asset. Ether is the reserve asset for the ethereum economy, which means if you're buying defi tokens, you better be making more value in ether with your investments or else you're better off just holding ether. Right. So that's why you're bringing this metric into the fray here. I've got a join for free button on trading view. I'm not going to join today, David. Is that okay?
00:03:48.488 - 00:03:52.214, Speaker B: Not today. Okay, just refresh that page and that'll go away.
00:03:52.332 - 00:03:56.390, Speaker A: All right, refresh the page. But what is this ratio that we're looking at?
00:03:56.460 - 00:04:30.894, Speaker B: Yeah, so we are looking at the US or the EtH price of DPi. So DPI denominated in ETH terms. And that tells us a very different story than the DPi price in dollar terms. The dollar is the dollar, but ether is really the reserve asset of Ethereum. And what we are seeing is back in we had DFI summer, where basically all of the DFI tokens were pretty inflated in price. And then we had the dfI like quote unquote three month bear market at the bottom. It bottomed out in November and then it bottomed again really in January versus ETH.
00:04:30.894 - 00:05:18.046, Speaker B: But since early November 2020 to where we are now, DFI tokens have been in a channel versus eTH that it is starting to poke up against the upper bounds of that channel. And I think the reason why it's important to pay attention to defi tokens versus EtH and DpI versus eth is that it's dfI season, quote unquote alt season, which I totally think is coming, which we've been talking about on the weekly roll ups for a while. I think that that happens when these DFI tokens break out of this channel, versus ether, which they've been outperforming ether for basically all of 2021. And all we need to have happen is for that trend to continue for us to get into DFI season. I think DFI season is right around the corner, and the DPI ETH chart has that story being told.
00:05:18.148 - 00:05:30.278, Speaker A: Oh, David. I don't know, though. ETH is pretty strong these days, too. So what happens if Eth goes on a tear, busts through the two K mark and leaves dfi in the dust? Is that a possibility as well?
00:05:30.364 - 00:05:53.886, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's totally a possibility. And like I said, I think DFI tokens in that possibility will outperform the dollar very strongly because they track ether. But you're totally right. Versus ether. They could fall. There is room for ether to just do something stupid after it breaks its all time high, like we saw bitcoin did. Bitcoin broke its all time high and then doubled it.
00:05:53.886 - 00:06:26.502, Speaker B: Ether has broke its all time high twice now, but has really been kind of scared to get into price discovery mode. I think the time where ether breaks all time high and goes into price discovery mode, I think that's a possibility. I'm hoping that that happens. That would be awesome. And that would definitely kick the can down the road for defi tokens versus Ether and defi season. If ether comes to dominate the landscape, defi tokens will have to take a backseat. But I think Defi season is coming inevitably, one way or another.
00:06:26.636 - 00:06:51.374, Speaker A: This is why we talk about the crypto money portfolio, the bankless portfolio being a healthy dose of crypto monies at the bottom. So these are ether, these are bitcoin. This is sort of what you denominate your wealth in, in the crypto economy. And you purchase some things like defi tokens and those assets. If you think they're going to outperform ETH and bitcoin. Right. In order for them to be good investments, they must.
00:06:51.374 - 00:07:21.786, Speaker A: But if you have that kind of a portfolio, you can't lose in this kind of a bold market. Of course, never know what could happen in the future, but things are going up at the moment, David. I just said things are going up at the moment. And at the same time, bitcoin has had like two weeks, maybe three weeks or so of somewhat of a correction. Right, but these corrections are normal, aren't they? So this is a chart of 2017. What's happening in 2017 here that is relevant for us in 2021?
00:07:21.888 - 00:07:50.914, Speaker B: Yeah, this chart shows the four quarters of 2017, and it shows multiple 20% to 40% retracements of the bitcoin price as it climbed up that 2017 parabola. We've talked about this before on weekly roll ups. We're talking about it again. 20% to 40% drawbacks are the norm in bull markets. Bull markets are fun times because everyone's making money. But that does not mean that pain is not felt in bull markets. There is always pain ahead of us.
00:07:50.914 - 00:08:01.538, Speaker B: Even if you've just felt pain, there's pain ahead. Still, that's how bull markets work. It is not smooth sailing. So there's always a looming 20% to 40% correction on the horizon.
00:08:01.634 - 00:08:23.354, Speaker A: So that's the message here. The other message is, of course, that these corrections, these pullbacks, if you will, are normal in bull markets. We've seen this play out already. There's about one every quarter that happens with bitcoin. This is what happened in 2017, and the average pullback is about 30%. David's right on. Between 20 and 40% would be somewhat normal.
00:08:23.354 - 00:08:29.630, Speaker A: So keep that in mind during the bull run. If there's a correction, doesn't mean necessarily that it's over.
00:08:29.780 - 00:09:31.970, Speaker B: Ave is a borrowing and lending protocol on Ethereum and just recently released Ave version two, which has a ton of cool new features that makes using Ave even more powerful. With Ave, you can leverage the full power of DFI money, legos, yield and composability all in one application. On Ave, there are a ton of assets that you can deposit in order to gain yield, and all of those same assets can also be borrowed from the protocol. If you have deposited collateral here, you can see me getting a 200 USDC loan against my portfolio of a number of different DFI tokens and ETH. I'll choose a variable interest rate because it's a lower rate than the stable interest rate option, but I could choose the stable interest rate option if I wanted to lock that interest rate in permanently. One of Ave's V two features is the ability to swap collateral without having to withdraw your assets, trade them on uniswap, and then deposit them back into Ave. Ave does all of this for you, all in one seamless transaction, so you don't have to repay loans in order to change the collateral you have backing them.
00:09:31.970 - 00:10:15.962, Speaker B: Check out the power of Ave@ave.com. That's aave.com. If you want to live a bankless life, you need to get a monolith defi Visa card. Monolith is a one two punch of both an Ethereum smart contract wallet and an accompanying Visa card that lets you spend the money that you have in your Ethereum wallet everywhere where Visa is accepted. When you swipe your monolith Visa card at the grocery store or at a restaurant, it actually makes a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that spends some of the money you hold in your monolith wallet. It's insanely cool, and it's one of the best tools out there for living a bankless but still normal life. Monolith also offers on ramp services for getting your fiat money into the world of defi.
00:10:15.962 - 00:10:45.194, Speaker B: So it's trivial to top up your monolith card if you ever need to, and your deposited money goes straight into your non custodial wallet. So your money is never held by a centralized intermediary. Because monolith is native ethereum infrastructure, the money you hold in your monolith wallet still has the power of DFI behind it. Swapping assets on Uniswap or earning yield in DFI is at your fingertips. Go to monolith XYZ and sign up to get your monolith visa card today.
00:10:45.392 - 00:10:59.214, Speaker A: David, that's market. Let's get to releases. So e two is available on Bitfinex, and we're talking about the EtH two assets. Staked ETH, really is what we're talking about here. What does that mean?
00:10:59.412 - 00:11:38.086, Speaker B: Yeah, so Bitfinex is offering a staked eTh derivative token. And so what that means is that they are accepting eTh deposits from their users, and then they are issuing a token, which is a claim on those deposits. This is actually how just banks work, right? Like, you give them the money and then the banks will give you a receipt, like a receipt of deposit, a credit of deposit. And this is what Bitfinex is doing. They are receiving ether deposits, issuing you a token that is a credit on your deposits, and then they are allowing for that token to be traded, it looks like, on their platform. So I don't think it's something that you can. It's basically they are allowing a secondary market to happen inside of their exchange.
00:11:38.198 - 00:12:08.454, Speaker A: All the crypto banks are doing this, guys. So Kraken has amassed a pretty large amount of staked ETH Coinbase is going to be doing it at some point soon. I'm looking to that release. David, this is not necessarily a bad thing, but it's also not necessarily a great thing. What we'd prefer is for people to stake at home on their own validators. And barring that, we'd prefer that they use a decentralized staking as a service provider. Could you talk about that second option? Yeah.
00:12:08.492 - 00:13:01.778, Speaker B: So for any centralized product that this world experiences, the theory behind Ethereum is that if there is a centralized product, we can make a decentralized correlate to that product using Ethereum's app layer. One of the centralized products that I think will come first to Ethereum's app layer and create a decentralized version of this is staking. It would be pretty terrible if things like Bitfinex and Coinbase and all these other centralized exchanges were the main staking entities behind the Ethereum network. And so let's create an application that decentralizes the service where people can contribute the resources that they have. Maybe it's ether, maybe it's a validating node. Depending on what you have, you can come to this theoretical decentralized staking as a service application and then deposit the resources that you have in order to create a self sovereign staking system. We just wrote about this in the bankless newsletter.
00:13:01.778 - 00:14:11.238, Speaker B: I put an article in there talking about the thesis and theory behind decentralized staking platforms. And I use rocket pool as the example, the exemplar example of what a decentralized staking as a service application can do. In the same way that it's really great that we have USDC on Ethereum, even though it's a centralized stablecoin, it's a banked stablecoin, that's totally fine. There's more options for us. It's really important that we also have DAi, and in that same vein, we are going to see centralized versions of staked ether derivative tokens come into Ethereum, and it's going to be really important that we have a decentralized derivative staked ether token and that coming out of rocket pool is our eth. I think there's going to be a very fun battle ahead of us as centralized protocols and decentralized protocols all compete for ether deposits to issue a staked eth derivative token on Ethereum. And the staked ether derivative token that's issued on Ethereum, that is issued by a decentralized staking as a service provider, will be the trustless, high assurances, low risk token that I think will come to be the status quo for a derivative token on Ethereum.
00:14:11.334 - 00:14:42.802, Speaker A: Well, at least that's what the protocol sync thesis would predict, which we are big advocates of and has a pretty good track record in this space that the most credibly neutral protocols win. David, speaking of developments on Ethereum, l two is coming. Let's talk a little bit about this big news. Ave a token. So this is their interest bearing tokens we talk about so much. Thanks Ave, for sponsoring bankless and making this possible. They have just ported some of their interest bearing tokens to the Maddox network.
00:14:42.802 - 00:14:44.322, Speaker A: What is the Maddox network?
00:14:44.466 - 00:15:25.950, Speaker B: Yeah, Matic Network is an l two on Ethereum. Its competitive advantage is a decently expressive l two. One of the big problems behind l two designs is that we had trouble in Ethereum development, making them as turing complete or as expressive or as smart as the actual Ethereum base layer. Matic has solved that problem. So they have this l two that has composability and they have smart contracts and that's pretty unique. And Ave has put their interest bearing deposits onto Maddox network. And so for people that are managing these interest bearing deposits, they can use them on the Matic network with much lower gas fees.
00:15:25.950 - 00:15:44.966, Speaker B: And I think this is part of just the story of Ethereum scaling. We saw synthetics roll out their l two with optimistic roll ups. It looks like Ave is going on Maddox and this is going to be just another one of Ethereum's big applications finding ways to save its users on gas with l two s. Yeah, I'm.
00:15:44.998 - 00:16:10.446, Speaker A: Super excited about this. I remember the 2017 bull run. It was always, well, here are some possible theoretical ways for Ethereum to scale in the future. And there was the state channels, raiden networks going to scale everything. And then there was plasma as sort of the holy grail. Different era. Now we actually have solutions that are here and being used, so it's exciting to see them being adopted.
00:16:10.446 - 00:16:32.426, Speaker A: I think we'll cover that in future roll ups as well. Coinbase, that's something else we're going to be covering in the future. What are they just. They're teasing us. They're offering a secondary market for their private shares ahead of their public stock listing. As if this wasn't one of the biggest ipos anticipated ipos in crypto. They're offering it to the secondary market ahead of time.
00:16:32.426 - 00:16:34.006, Speaker A: What does this mean, David?
00:16:34.118 - 00:16:48.766, Speaker B: Yeah, so everyone wants to get in on the Coinbase IPO. I have zero legacy assets, I have zero equity assets. I've got no stonks, but I would still buy the Coinbase IPO just because I think it was probably a good.
00:16:48.868 - 00:16:51.550, Speaker A: Wait, would you buy it over uni tokens though?
00:16:51.620 - 00:16:53.760, Speaker B: Well, I already got my uni tokens. Okay.
00:16:55.750 - 00:17:00.770, Speaker A: When are they going to give us retrospective airdrops? I've been a Coinbase user for a. Yeah, right.
00:17:00.840 - 00:17:25.514, Speaker B: Like I've played Coinbase plenty of fees. Where's my know they should follow in their competition footsteps? What my question is, is this secondary listing of this private shares ahead of the public stock trading. Who gets to access that? Do I get to access that? I'm not accredited investor. Who gets to access that? I don't think it's available for typical retail investors to be able to access.
00:17:25.712 - 00:17:59.686, Speaker A: This would probably be an accredited investor thing for sure on the secondary market and mostly for employee liquidity purposes. David, some other things DeFI protocols are continuing to ship, so Kyber has been around for a long time. Fantastic liquidity provider in the DFI space. They just launched a bunch of things, including their v three release. And this v three release focuses on liquidity, particularly providing incentives for their liquidity providers, which is something they've been quite good at. Any comments here?
00:17:59.788 - 00:18:32.942, Speaker B: Yeah, Kyber is kind of an unsung hero, I think, when it comes to liquidity. In Ethereum. Before Uniswap was the shelling point of liquidity, Kyber was, and it actually still is on a decent number of trading pairs. Kyber is actually one of the most liquid networks, liquidity networks in Ethereum. They are not an AmM like Uniswap is. They have a different way of providing liquidity to Ethereum and that offers more options, more modularity with how liquidity providers want to be able to use their liquidity. With Uniswap, you kind of only have one option.
00:18:32.942 - 00:18:52.950, Speaker B: You have to deposit equal amounts of two assets into a pool. Kyber gives you more optionality with how liquidity providers can offer liquidity. It's a little bit more capital efficient. And some of the main updates in this Kyber 3.0 update are just furthering and bolstering the tools that liquidity providers have and how they provide liquidity to Kyber.
00:18:53.370 - 00:19:37.326, Speaker A: Speaking of which, Alpha Hamora is an interesting deFi protocol too. They just put out their second version, an interesting protocol for yield farmers. So folks that were already generating yield on governance tokens in the farms can now take leverage on ETH and other assets and actually generate more yield. So yield two and a half x your yield. This is really a dgen type of tool. So I'm not sure how comfortable I would be with it, but there is a way to actually lend ETH to this protocol, and it's generating some pretty substantial returns. So, like the 78% rate, and it's locked up a massive amount of ETH, David.
00:19:37.326 - 00:19:43.654, Speaker A: So like 500,000 ETH, it's locked up right now in Alpha Hamora. What do you make of that?
00:19:43.772 - 00:20:09.066, Speaker B: Absolutely crazy. What I make of that is that it's product market fit, man. Like leveraged yield farming with ether deposits. I'm not personally going to put my ETH in there because that's a little risky for my takes, but DFI, dgens who want to yield farm with leverage in an automated fashion that saves them on gas. No shit. Alpha has. Oh, I promise I wouldn't swear.
00:20:09.066 - 00:20:21.554, Speaker B: No wonder. Alpha has gotten almost 0.5% of all outstanding ETH supply in its contracts. That's just product market fit. That's just defi degeneracy at its best. And I mean that in the best way possible.
00:20:21.672 - 00:20:55.834, Speaker A: Yeah, I. Beth is the product for that. That's where you deposit your ETH inside. And you're right, that's getting closer to 5% of all ETH in circulation. It goes to show you how these money protocols can just be ETh monsters, ETH gobblers sucking up all of that economic bandwidth that we talk about so much. David, back to L2s for a minute. Starkware released their roadmap and they were talking about a permissionless stark powered L2 built around ZK roll ups with, and this is important, turing complete functionality.
00:20:55.834 - 00:21:22.630, Speaker A: So the ability to program on top of this L2, if that felt a little bit jargony for you, then you have to check out the Vitalik podcast and video that we just put out where he walks through roll ups. But this technology, it's a little bit away. So it's a year or two, maybe three years away, but this is really the holy grail for Ethereum scalability. Any thoughts on this?
00:21:22.780 - 00:21:54.366, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right. So this is the version of Rollups that Vitalik is particularly hot about. He made the estimation that it's going to be optimistic roll ups in the near term that really kind of get going with Ethereum and find a lot of product market fit. But Vitalik in the long term believes that ZK roll ups are going to be the dominant form over the long term. And this is one of the first steps to rolling that out into the ethereum ecosystem. Definitely check out that video. That video is coming out roughly around the same time that this one is, it's already out.
00:21:54.366 - 00:21:58.958, Speaker B: And so just another video with italic coming out on the bankless YouTube and bankless podcasts.
00:21:59.054 - 00:22:28.470, Speaker A: All right. And we're talking about all of the L2s. Somebody put together a fantastic, actually, I think Kevin Owaki did put together this fantastic index of all the L2s. We'll include this in the show notes, but you can check out all of the different L2s that are in development, their various stats, transaction cost, how consensus works, and their transactions per second. Just a lot of work going on in that space. Very exciting. So this was really interesting too, David, some liquidity pools from Uniswap.
00:22:28.470 - 00:22:49.666, Speaker A: These are assets, of course, that are composed of uniswap liquidity, like pairs of liquidity, one specifically for wrapped bitcoin and ETH, and another for USDC ETH. Liquidity pools were just approved to be collateral in the makerdao system. So that means they are backing the value of Dai. What's the significance of this?
00:22:49.768 - 00:23:30.506, Speaker B: Yeah, the significance is that uniswap collateral uniswap liquidity tokens are being added as collateral into Makerdao, which allows people to draw Dai against their liquidity positions in Uniswap. And not only USDC ETH pairs are being added to Makerdao, but dai and Eth. Dai eth pair out of uniswap. If you submit ETH and dai to Uniswap, you get a token back. That's just how uniswap works. And then you can now take that token to Makerdao, put that into a vault in Makerdao, and draw dai against the dai eth pair that you've deposited into uniswap. So if you can add liquidity to dai, you can make dai more liquid by adding liquidity to uniswap.
00:23:30.506 - 00:23:59.922, Speaker B: And then you can take that position and then draw more dai against it. It's a fantastic positive feedback loop of Dai supply. I really expect this to be one of the main things that adds supply to Dai, both supply and liquidity. It's a two for one punch. It's really awesome. And that's just a nice benefit to people that really want to contribute to the Maker Dow protocol. I think if Maker Dow came around in maybe 2019, 2020, this would be a yield farm.
00:23:59.922 - 00:24:38.466, Speaker B: I bet you they already have their MKR token kind of locked into how they like it. But I foresee alternative universe where the Makerdao protocol or something similar to it came and started issuing MKR rewards to people that do this. If I had my fingers in the MKR token economics, I would issue MKR rewards to people that do this just to incentivize liquidity. This is actually a normal playbook from Defi protocols nowadays, but pretty cool innovation by Makerdao. Pretty cool new collateral, just more options for dai to become liquid. And of course, it's really important that Dai is liquid in Ethereum.
00:24:38.658 - 00:25:14.526, Speaker A: Yeah, it's also an example of superfluid collateral, the ability for the collateral tokenized collateral on Ethereum to be used across all of these various money protocols. I always think liquidity pools is kind of interesting because it's not only a bet on the assets and the ratios of those assets inside of a uniswap liquidity pool, but it's also a bet on Uniswap trading volume, which makes it a unique asset that is not available anywhere outside of Defi, and a very decentralized asset at that. So very cool to see Dai starting to adopt that.
00:25:14.708 - 00:26:08.110, Speaker B: Ryan, if you go to that dai stats page, you'll see that there is a $3 million die limit on both bitcoin and ether Uniswap tokens, and a 3 million die limit on USDC and ether, and also a 3 million limit on dither liquidity pairs. That's a relatively low ceiling for die. There's only 3 million per uniswap token. The reason why this is so low is that there's a new oracle system providing the value of these uniswap tokens going into makerdao. So Makerdao previously uses other oracles to understand what the prices are of the assets inside the program, inside the protocol. Because these are Uniswap tokens. Makerdao needed a different way to test and understand the value of these assets, because now there's a weighting between it's one part eth, one part dai, or one part bitcoin, one part eth.
00:26:08.110 - 00:26:28.706, Speaker B: And so there's a new oracle providing new information to the Makerdao protocol. And that is why the debt ceiling is so low. As people get more comfortable as the Makerdao MKR voters get more comfortable with this new type of asset, I expect the debt ceiling on these lp tokens to increase significantly.
00:26:28.818 - 00:27:02.510, Speaker A: And so that just means we can put more and more inside of Makerdao and withdraw collateral based on is the, those are the releases for this week. Let's talk news. Of course, our main event we're going to get to in a little bit, which is everything that's going on in the Gamestop world. But we'll get to that soon. Let's talk about some of these other things. I thought it's really cool. It's an artifact of open finance that we can actually track the assets that individual funds, popular funds, hold and trade.
00:27:02.510 - 00:27:25.370, Speaker A: This is from Masari. This is a watch list of all of the assets that placeholder ventures our friend Chris Berninski holds inside of his fund. Very cool that you can do that, I think, in open finance. And this is very much an unlock, I think, for all of us to be able to see what thought leaders, what individual funds are holding inside of their wallets.
00:27:25.710 - 00:27:49.186, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this actually does contrast very well with the GameStop conversation. I know, Sid, we were going to tease that, but this is an inside out industry. People's bags are transparent. Like, there's no hidden information. Right. And because there's no hidden information, people like Missari, the data website, are publishing people's bags, because that's already. That's information that's available.
00:27:49.186 - 00:28:03.010, Speaker B: And so it's one part a privacy concern. Everyone should understand that your bags and your addresses are public, but that also means that everyone is on an equal informational playing field, which is not something that we can find in the legacy markets.
00:28:03.090 - 00:28:28.090, Speaker A: Yes. Okay, next two things are about more firms buying bitcoin. So this is a Nasdaq listed company, marathon Patent Group, buying $150,000,000 worth of bitcoin. That seems to be a recurring trend. In 2021, firms buying publicly traded companies buying more bitcoin, adding it to the balance sheet. Speaking of which, microstrategy bought even more bitcoin. How much did they buy this time, David?
00:28:28.170 - 00:28:43.730, Speaker B: They did it again. This is their smallest purchase ever. Which makes me really curious about this. $10 million, a modest $10 million on, I think, what is already, like seven or $800 million. I could be wrong about that. But I think this is. It's interesting.
00:28:43.730 - 00:28:55.030, Speaker B: Just every time microstrategy buys bitcoin, that's always interesting. But it's interesting as how small this is. Just like, it's a drop in the bucket of all the bitcoins that they already own.
00:28:55.180 - 00:29:00.242, Speaker A: Just a casual 10 million just dollar cost averaging in, as one does into crypto.
00:29:00.386 - 00:29:26.162, Speaker B: Yeah. And so people talk about, is Michael Saylor trying to do, like, a bitcoin pump and dump? Is he trying to really pump the price of bitcoin? And maybe he is, but I don't really think so. I think he is actually a bitcoin believer. And so I think any spare change that microstrategy has is going into bitcoin. So I just pulled this up. Bitcointres.org, they have 70,700 bitcoins, which is at today's value, $2.3
00:29:26.162 - 00:29:34.702, Speaker B: billion. So microstrategy adds on $10 million onto their $2.3 billion supply of bitcoins.
00:29:34.846 - 00:29:56.166, Speaker A: It's crazy how well that has worked out for them. Let's talk about Janet Yellen again. We talked about her last week. She is, of course, the new treasury secretary. She's going to be overseeing important things like Finsen. She came out with a more bullish quote on crypto this week. Last week she said something bad that made headlines.
00:29:56.166 - 00:30:36.438, Speaker A: This week she's saying us government should consider the benefits of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Perhaps walking back some of her statements from last know, this really reminds me of the conversation that we will be publishing on Monday. But the conversation we had with Jeremy Alair from Circle and we went through 2021 and whether there were going to be more headwinds or more tailwinds from regulators, it always seems to be. There's this conflicting message. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, but it's never fully one or the other. Almost like they're lukewarm on crypto at the moment. What's your take here?
00:30:36.604 - 00:31:10.030, Speaker B: Yeah, the Yellen statements from last week was linked to the drop in bitcoin price that happened last week. People saying that there's a bunch of regulatory fud. I didn't really put much weight into that analysis. And now this week, Janet Yellen is know, hey, there actually is some value that could be leveraged by public blockchains. I just don't think Janet Yellen is really all that informed. And I think both of these statements are relatively boilerplate and don't really mean all that much. We're going to have to wait for real action, real, tangible action coming out of Janet Yellen and the rest of regulation.
00:31:10.030 - 00:31:14.226, Speaker B: All these boilerplate comments are just not helpful to try and interpret his news.
00:31:14.328 - 00:31:45.514, Speaker A: We are waiting. Sea mode. Meanwhile, some mayors are pretty hot on crypto. This is the mayor of Miami who is talking about turning Miami into an economic hub for crypto innovation. I think that this is going to be a popular narrative, and this is why regulators and those in government cannot ignore crypto. There's just tremendous opportunity, economic opportunity, job opportunity that their constituents will want. And I think this will drive the adoption of crypto.
00:31:45.514 - 00:31:46.526, Speaker A: What's your take there?
00:31:46.628 - 00:32:34.830, Speaker B: Yeah, bitcoiners often call bitcoin a mind virus. And instead of thinking of it's bitcoin versus state, or like public blockchains versus the nation state. I think it's actually much more suitable to think of public blockchains as viruses that creep into people's brains and convince them that they are the best thing about the world right now. And I've caught that bug. I know you've caught that bug, Ryan. It seems like the mayor of Miami has caught that bug. And the important takeaway is that there's totally a path where bitcoin and ethereum, as mined viruses, infect people in positions of power around the globe, including our own regulators, including our own governors, including our own mayors, and we just have these protocols adopted because the people that use them are also in positions of power.
00:32:34.980 - 00:32:54.146, Speaker A: Absolutely. All right, let's talk about China for a minute. We do from time to time. So ethereum based consensus, that is a big development studio that is developing tooling for ethereum. They just partnered with the blockchain network of China. Is this good or bad? What does this mean?
00:32:54.248 - 00:33:27.440, Speaker B: Yeah, this is something to keep one's eye on. Quorum used to be a private consortium, blockchain, and I think it still is based off of consensus, owned by. So, you know, very much aligned with the ethos of China to run a blockchain that is much more centralized, much more private, much more controlled. But still, blockchain is creeping into every single corner of the world. And it's interesting to watch consensus help other entities lead that charge. Public. Permissionless blockchains are different than what's going on here, but blockchain technology.
00:33:27.440 - 00:33:35.802, Speaker B: I'm not a blockchain, not bitcoiner, but I do think there is value in blockchain as a technology, and I'd like to see that proliferated. And that's what's going on. Yeah.
00:33:35.876 - 00:34:27.934, Speaker A: And particularly as it's linked into public blockchain, I think this lends some more credibility to the idea that their governments might have their own private ledgers and private chains even, but ultimately they're going to have to settle on some credibly neutral infrastructure, a public network like Ethereum. And this just provides China's blockchain network with a conduit and a bridge to do that. So I think we'll have to see how that plays out. Speaking of China, David, I've been wondering a lot about Polkadot these days. The token price of dots has been just off the charts. Just crazy, right? Yet adoption hasn't. There are some projects building on Polkadot, but we don't see the transaction fee revenue on Polkadot that we see on bitcoin.
00:34:27.934 - 00:34:45.078, Speaker A: It's largely empty blocks. It's largely a ghost chain. Now that could change in the future. Absolutely something to watch out for. But right now that is what it is. But dots are super hot in China. I think this may be the reason price is pumping in the way it is, or at least one of the core reasons any takes on that.
00:34:45.244 - 00:35:19.282, Speaker B: Yeah, dot has a different consensus system than Ethereum does. And it's a little bit the topological design. I should not be considered an expert in Polkadot at all. So take this with a grain of salt. The topological design of Polkadot allows for a little bit more governance and control over what goes on on the base chain than what Ethereum does. And so I find that interesting, that China, of all places, which has a society in asian countries, tend to be a little bit in this disposition or demeanor. They're a little bit more control with top down control.
00:35:19.282 - 00:35:30.454, Speaker B: The chinese population is used to top down control and Polkadot has sort of a top down control mechanism in its consensus. So I find that resonance between Polkadot and China a little bit interesting.
00:35:30.652 - 00:35:53.086, Speaker A: Yeah, it's going to be interesting to see whether Polkadot can build something of lasting value or whether it's taking the eos approach, which of course did very well in China for a period of time and now is nowhere to be seen. I mean, no one's doing anything with Eos big blocks delegated proof of stake did not work out over the long run. So we'll have to see what happens.
00:35:53.188 - 00:35:55.290, Speaker B: Don't cut corners on your blockchain, folks.
00:35:55.370 - 00:36:18.694, Speaker A: That's right. You can't do that. Have to preserve credible neutrality. DYdX, they just raised 10 million and they put out this report. David, I don't know if you got a chance to see it, but I was blown away by the numbers. So first of all, two and a half billion in trade volume. DydX, of course, is a decentralized exchange and it provides margin in the same way a bitmax did, but it does so in a decentralized way.
00:36:18.694 - 00:36:36.170, Speaker A: And the trades are transparent. So you always know the house isn't betting against you. But this stat was astounding to me. 17.4 billion in loans originated in 2020. 117.4 billion.
00:36:36.170 - 00:36:54.430, Speaker A: That's billion with a B. Pretty incredible, David. This is just a great platform. And next month they are actually moving to L2. So they're rolling out their own L2 solution built on some starkware tech. I'm pretty excited about it. What's your take here.
00:36:54.500 - 00:37:24.358, Speaker B: Yeah, DyDX is one of the great big dysyncs, which is one of, and also USDC and also ETH. And so DyDX as an application is one of the great reasons why there's yield behind Dai, USDC and ETh. That's important to know. There's also speculation on a DYDX token. Question mark. I don't know anything and I don't think that there's been statements from the team at all. But I think there are rumors going around that there could be a retroactive airdrop, as we all know and love coming out of DYDX.
00:37:24.358 - 00:37:31.760, Speaker B: Unconfirmed, yet, I'm cautiously optimistic. If there was a DyDX token, I would be a recipient of one. Absolutely.
00:37:32.450 - 00:38:16.074, Speaker A: That's because you use the protocol so much. And guys, we put out a post recently about some future airdrops, just kind of speculating and predicting there is value in using these protocols now. Not only value in leveling up, but also due to these retrospective airdrops. I mean, last year, if you collected all of the airdrops that were available, it was like $20,000 or something crazy. And guys, all this entails is actually using metamask, using a d five wallet, connecting to these applications and using them. Of course, that might not remain the case for DydX. No promises, but it's worth a shot, is it not? Spend 10 minutes of your time to go figure this stuff out.
00:38:16.074 - 00:38:44.354, Speaker A: David, let's end with Mark Cuban. So Mark Cuban is getting in the NFT world, it seems. This is deep into defi. This is just, I have ether that I own on Coinbase or even I've used Aave. This is, he's actually minting an NFT using rarible from his own public ethereum address. This is pretty deep. I'm pretty impressed by this.
00:38:44.354 - 00:38:45.138, Speaker A: What's your take?
00:38:45.224 - 00:39:14.682, Speaker B: Yeah, what was interesting is that when Mark Cuban made this NFT, which double check me on the numbers, but I think it listed for 0.2 e and then it sold for $17,000 a few blocks later. So somebody really wanted that Mark Cuban NFT really badly. But in process, like we were saying earlier, this is a public ecosystem. And when Mark Cuban mints an NFT and sells it, people know where that NFT came from. And so people took a look at Mark Cuban's bags. Mark Cuban is a sushi token owner, by the way.
00:39:14.682 - 00:39:36.094, Speaker B: For those that didn't want to know, he's got sushi in his bags. He's got a few other things. You can find that tweet and investigate yourself if you really want to find out. But what really is interesting to me is he's a sushiswap owner. Sushiswap isn't even the leading amm in Defi. Uniswap is so, like, Mark Cuban's deep in Defi right now. He has got his fingers in the weeds.
00:39:36.094 - 00:39:40.726, Speaker B: I think I got my fingers crossed he's coming on bankless for a podcast in the future.
00:39:40.828 - 00:39:53.866, Speaker A: Yeah, well, you can see my tweet right underneath, like, prompting him as such. So fingers crossed, David. That could be the case. We will see what happens. David, let's get into some takes. So that was news. This is the first take.
00:39:53.866 - 00:40:00.358, Speaker A: Why'd you like this one? This is someone saying, ethereum, not blockchain. That's it. Three words. Ethereum, not blockchain.
00:40:00.454 - 00:40:41.478, Speaker B: Yeah, this is Jay, who's another podcast co host, and she says, ethereum, not blockchain. And I find myself keeping on when I do my writing, I talk about the cryptocurrency industry, or I talk about public permissionless blockchains, but what the hell am I even talking about? I'm really just talking about, if I'm talking about public permissionless blockchains, I'm just talking about bitcoin and ethereum. So I'll just say those things. Or if I'm talking about the cryptocurrency industry, most of the time I'm basically just talking about the Ethereum industry. And so when people talk about, like, yo, I work in crypto, or I talk about cryptocurrencies. No, it's actually just ethereum. Maybe this is me, my east maxi hat getting put on, which I'm happy to wear.
00:40:41.478 - 00:40:54.298, Speaker B: But the cryptocurrency industry is mostly noise, except for what is the ethereum side of that cryptocurrency industry. So let's just start calling it ethereum. It's the Ethereum industry. Ethereum, not blockchain.
00:40:54.474 - 00:41:35.254, Speaker A: There you go. All right, that's David with his ethereum maximalist hat on. Let's do another ethereum take here, proof of stake versus proof of work on energy. This has not been a narrative that has entered into the mainstream consciousness yet. It's something that has been talked about at various times. But of course, proof of work is a massive energy consumer, right? So all of the miners that operate economically secure the bitcoin network and the Ethereum network on proof of work today consume a tremendous amount of electricity and power. And that has an impact, of course, on the environment.
00:41:35.254 - 00:42:11.846, Speaker A: But proof of stake does not have that same impact. Right. It has almost like, no impact on the environment. Vance Spencer here is making the comment that more ESG funds, so these are environmentally savvy funds, will not allocate to proof of work systems like bitcoin. So what he's saying is proof of work, or cryptocurrency networks that employ proof of work will not be viewed favorably for a number of investors and perhaps government bodies and the world in the future. And proof of stake has an advantage there. What's your take on this?
00:42:11.948 - 00:42:55.246, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm on the fence about the proof of work sustainability arguments. I'm actually a believer that over the long term, the extra consumption by bitcoin energy consumption is actually a net positive. I think there's a very strong argument that it actually, in the long term, can promote green energy consumption, incentivize green energy consumption. I'm compelled by that argument. In the near term, I think that it could be a massive part of the 2021 news cycle as people focus in on climate change. As climate change moves to the forefront, especially under a biden presidency, I think bitcoin could actually be plagued by its branding as a very energy consumptive network, which it is. It's like taking up one to 2% of the world's electricity.
00:42:55.246 - 00:43:23.214, Speaker B: It's insane. And this is a frequent topic of conversation on my podcast with Christian Corollas of Bitcoin magazine. We talk about this, and we both generally agree that over the long term, the merits of bitcoin energy consumption could be positive. But like this article states, I think the short term fud about bitcoin's energy consumption will be a significant toxic plague that plagues its brand for many years to come. Yeah.
00:43:23.252 - 00:44:01.254, Speaker A: So you've got definitely a narrative issue. Despite what the truth ends up being about bitcoin's impact in the environment, I'm not actually sure what I think yet. I think I need to take a look at some more data. There's certainly environmental externalities that need to be considered when you're consuming this massive amount of energy. But I guess the bitcoiner argument is that essentially it's using energy that otherwise would not be used and go to waste. So these energy sources are greener than other energy sources. I think that's really something that you don't, over the long run, need to form an opinion on.
00:44:01.254 - 00:44:21.374, Speaker A: Like, the data will just bear it out and show us. So it's kind of a thesis. I know that bitcoiners want that to be true, like, and I understand they want it to be true, but I'm not sure that it is. At least I'd need to see some more data on that. So let's go to the next take. So institutions adopting eth is money. David, it's happening.
00:44:21.374 - 00:45:06.046, Speaker A: I read an article in Coinbase that basically said institutions are saying ether is a store of value. Look at this. The case for owning Ethereum. Ether we hear most frequently from our clients is a combination of, first, its evolving potential as a store of value, its evolving potential, not oil, ether as a store of value as a money, second, as its status as a digital commodity. Oh my God, they almost got all three just add staking and they have the triple point asset thesis here. Pretty incredible, because back in 2017 and before, no one was saying this, least of all institutions, but basically no one was saying it at the time. Do you think this is a narrative change that's going to take hold in 2021?
00:45:06.148 - 00:45:22.286, Speaker B: Absolutely. And I think this is actually indications that this has already taken hold. And there's only going to be more talk of this. Like I was saying in the last roll ups, people are coming into this industry with a blank slate. Like, they are not coming in with bias. They don't have a bias to bias them. Their opinions are largely unformed.
00:45:22.286 - 00:46:17.390, Speaker B: And so the value proposition of ether doesn't have this plaguing branding of just being gas for Ethereum, which is just that belief was antiquated back in 2017. But it takes time for data and facts and knowledge to proliferate in the same way that Ryan, you were just talking about. Like, people are just going to have to wait for the bitcoin energy consumption narrative to show up with facts and figures. Ethereum, before we had the evidence that we have today, back in 2017, ether could have been argued as if it was gas. And it totally was argued to be that. Now we have the facts and figures, and we have the facts and figures. They started to brew in 2018, they grew a lot in 2019, and now they are growing out of the surface into the mainstream media, into the mainstream knowledge that ether is a store of value, non sovereign asset, just like bitcoin, and it has its own unique, compelling value propositions.
00:46:17.390 - 00:46:20.146, Speaker B: The world is waking up to this, and that makes me really bullish.
00:46:20.258 - 00:46:35.702, Speaker A: Well said. Yes. How do we know it is money? It's because it's being used as money. That's exactly how we know. There's increasing evidence of that, and it's very plain to see. Hard to argue otherwise. Eric Voorhees one of our favorite folks in crypto is talking about the value of airdrops.
00:46:35.702 - 00:47:10.262, Speaker A: Last year. We talked about this a little bit earlier. This is where I got this stat. But the quote he tweets is assuming you were an average defi investor and a bankless listener and a bankless reader. Of course, this past year and only used one address, so one Ethereum address only, you made nearly 20,000 in airdrops alone. This is because projects, D five projects retrospectively rewarded their users with token drops. And Eric says, this seems nuts, but consider what D five projects are doing.
00:47:10.262 - 00:47:36.730, Speaker A: All they're doing is paying users to use them rather than paying advertisers to use them. So essentially what he's saying is, guys, this is just marketing budget. This is what marketing costs. And it's a genius move, except that marketing isn't going to like Facebook ads or Google Ads. It's actually going to users who then propagate their love for the community through free advertising and marketing. It's pretty ingenious.
00:47:36.890 - 00:48:03.954, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd love to know of the tweet that Eric Voorhees is retweeting. I'd love to know the tallies that nick the tweeter tallied together when he talked about the airdrops. Obviously, Uni is one which was airdropped at roughly a value of one, $200 when Uniswap was $3 a token, which is now just under $15 a token. There's also one inch. There's also tornado cash. There's also dig badger. There's a bunch of airdrops.
00:48:03.954 - 00:48:12.710, Speaker B: Yeah. And so it is valuable to just use these things like, sorry, gas fees are really high, but fingers crossed you'll just be compensated by airdrops.
00:48:13.290 - 00:48:36.358, Speaker A: It has certainly paid to be a DFI user in 2020, and I think it will in 2021 as well. We are so early. It's still so early. Last take here. This is a take by Afri, actually. I don't have it pulled up, David, but I will pull that up in a minute. And what he says is basically, he's pretty flummoxed that banks are charging negative interest rates.
00:48:36.554 - 00:49:03.542, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll read it out here. Afri says, afri used to be a core Ethereum developer. I think he stepped back, but definitely very much involved with the Ethereum community. Afri says, my bank just informed me that they will now charge half a percent negative interest on my fiat holdings. It's really hard to understand the purpose of a bank in 2021. Fiat whatsoever. Just imagine the potential of anything not requiring a hmm.
00:49:03.542 - 00:49:06.394, Speaker B: I agree, Afri. I agree with this idea.
00:49:06.512 - 00:49:29.860, Speaker A: Why about is like, he's very bullish ethereum, but he's been pretty bearish, I think, on Defi in general and anything involving money. So to hear him say this as he's looking at his traditional bank account and looking at a half a percent negative interest rate is pretty astounding. So we're convincing even the skeptics here.
00:49:30.550 - 00:50:05.770, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And if that just doesn't scream bankless, then I don't know what does. Gemini is the world's most trusted cryptocurrency exchange.

00:51:56.290 - 00:52:07.646, Speaker A: All right, David, we are getting into the roll up section for takes. This is the long awaited moment where we talk about what is going on with Gamestop. Why don't we start there, dude? What is going on with GameStop?
00:52:07.758 - 00:52:44.234, Speaker B: All right, so I'm going to explain the backstory here, because it's important to understand the story going on here. For those that have watched the movie the big short. The big short movie depicted this guy who manages a hedge fund who just did some math and saw that there was a problem in the housing market. Right? So he basically called the housing market. And so he opened up a short on the american economy, basically. And then the big short is about just all the people that saw the coming collapse of the housing market. And this guy particularly, made his fund a bunch of money.
00:52:44.234 - 00:53:18.282, Speaker B: This same guy in the movie, the character that the real person, this is a true story. That real person made a similar call. So now that he's a legend for calling the eight crisis, people follow him, people pay attention to him. And what he did with this GameStop call is that he looked at the GameStop share price. He noticed that it was trading at a particular value. And then he went and he tallied up all of the assets that GameStop owns, like the real estate, the property, all the real assets, never mind the business model.
00:53:18.336 - 00:53:19.754, Speaker A: This is like their book value. Right?
00:53:19.792 - 00:53:43.234, Speaker B: The book value, yeah, the assets on the balance sheet. And he said that he thought that the share price was not inclusive of all the value that the company actually owned, like the straight physical assets. And so he said that he is going to make a long position on GameStop because the value of the asset, the value of the company, is trading well below the actual value of the underlying assets that they own.
00:53:43.352 - 00:53:54.680, Speaker A: Okay, and where did he say this? Because I remember the big short in 2008. No one would listen to him. He kept going to all these people, and everyone was like, yeah, whatever, shut up. We're not listening. Where did he start saying this?
00:53:55.530 - 00:54:27.822, Speaker B: I don't know the answer to that question. I just do know that it was public and it started brewing in the Wall street bets subreddit server. So for those that aren't familiar with the subreddit server, Wall street bets, it's kind of Defi Ggens will find themselves very well in there. It's people that try to make, like, yolo bets, where they put a ton of money on the line, and they mainly do it for engagement, and they either make a ton of money or they lose a ton of money. There's memes. It's a little bit like four Chan culture. There's memes.
00:54:27.822 - 00:54:34.382, Speaker B: The degeneracy, just like all the memes that you see coming out of corners of the Internet like this was present in Wall street bets.
00:54:34.446 - 00:55:08.634, Speaker A: Okay, so I want to understand the Wall street bets culture, because I think this is important before we go on to the rest of the story. Right? So my impression of Wall street bets culture is they're djens. They're trying to make money, but they know this is all a game, right? They very much know that the system is rigged and is set against them, and that money printer is going burr, and it's distorting the fundamental value of all of these assets, including stocks. And they're just like, what the hell? We might as well benefit from this, too. Is that the culture? Is that the philosophy of Wall street bets?
00:55:08.762 - 00:55:44.970, Speaker B: I don't think it was. It certainly is now. I think it wasn't necessarily that. I think maybe the money printer go Burr was in there just as a casual meme. It was mainly just a meme of just, like, degenerate yoloers, who I think mainly very wealthy people would just yolo $100 into options. And options, for those that don't know, are a way to make or lose a bunch of money all at once. But I would say in order to understand Wall street bets culture, you would need to understand it's very similar to some of the green frog culture that we see in the crypto space.
00:55:44.970 - 00:56:26.440, Speaker B: There's very much this headless movement. It's a cohort, it's a community, right? There are no leaders. It's just what the community thinks. And so if you've ever participated in, like, a chain link community or four Chan community, these are very similar communities. No one is the leader, but there kind of arises a similar energy, a similar just community out of these people, right? And so back to the story. And so this guy that's famous for calling the eight crisis says that GameStop is worth more than what the share price is. And so he buys a position, and that information leaks out into the Internet, public knowledge, and the Wall street bets subreddit grabs a hold of this, and they start kind of piling on.
00:56:26.440 - 00:57:02.670, Speaker B: There are some extremely savvy, informed investors who do their own analysis in Wall street bets. And some of the Wall street bets community listens to these people. And so this trade became more or less public knowledge inside the Wall street bets subreddit. And so that means that a bunch of these Wall street bets, they all put their capital into the same spot. And that's a very interesting phenomenon that we're seeing inside of Wall street bets. We're seeing inside of projects like Chainlink. We're seeing that in the projects that are run up by green frogs on four chan, people are coordinating and injecting capital in specific places to collectively pump backs.
00:57:02.670 - 00:57:29.930, Speaker B: That's what it's going on here. But at the same time, there's also this fundamentally true and sound trade beneath all these things. So Gamestop, or, excuse me, for Wall street bets, they identify this trade in GameStop, and they all start buying spot. They all start taking and putting GME stock into their portfolios. And what that does is that increases the price of the GameStop stock. And so now we have to talk about hedge funds.
00:57:31.550 - 00:57:36.414, Speaker A: So where do the hedge funds fit into this picture? Like shorts. We've heard that term as well, right?
00:57:36.452 - 00:58:13.994, Speaker B: So we need to understand the concept of a short squeeze. And so when you are going short an asset, that means you are hoping that the price goes down. And what that means is that when you short an asset, you borrow it from someone. And so say I have a stock that's worth $100, and you want to short that stock, Ryan. And so you borrow that stock from me, and it's at $100, and then the stock goes down to $50. And then when you borrowed that stock from me, you actually sold it on the market for $100. So you put that $100 into your pocket, kept that there, and then the stock went down $50.
00:58:13.994 - 00:58:49.362, Speaker B: And then you bought that stock back off the market and gave that stock back to me, and then you pocketed that $50 difference. Right? That's a short. That's ideal. If you want to short an asset, it goes down in price, and you get to pocket the difference based off of the moment you shorted it. It can go really wrong in the opposite direction, because, say you borrow a stock from me at $100, and then you sell it, and you're going to return that stock to me at a later date. But instead of that stock going down from one hundred dollars to fifty dollars, it goes up from one hundred dollars to two hundred dollars, or maybe $300. Or maybe $500.
00:58:49.416 - 00:58:51.034, Speaker A: I have to pay that entire debt.
00:58:51.102 - 00:59:26.306, Speaker B: You have to pay any number. It could be. It's an infinite level of risk. It could go to a million dollars and you have to pay back a million dollars even if you just shorted that stock at $100. So there's a large amount of risk. And the thing that funds were doing is many large hedge funds, very wealthy, which are just made up by wealthy investors, were shorting game stock basically into the ground. And what the important point about this story is that there are alleged accusations of naked short selling, which is short selling the stock without actually borrowing the underlying stock in the first place.
00:59:26.408 - 00:59:26.674, Speaker A: Right.
00:59:26.712 - 00:59:37.878, Speaker B: Which means that more than the total supply of GameStop shares were being shorted, which means it's like a fractional reserve system. It's kind of.
00:59:37.964 - 00:59:40.674, Speaker A: How do people get away with naked short selling?
00:59:40.802 - 00:59:49.306, Speaker B: Because it's illegal and done behind the scenes. I'm pretty sure it's illegal. Is it illegal? YouTube comments let us know if it's illegal or not.
00:59:49.408 - 01:00:17.762, Speaker A: Yeah, I would think that would be definitely illegal. Okay, so these funds are doing possibly naked shorts, which is like, doesn't any risky, right? It's not only illegal, quite possibly they're betting essentially that this stock does not go up in value at all. And they don't even have the stock backing that bet, essentially. So they're completely exposed here.
01:00:17.816 - 01:01:08.210, Speaker B: Completely exposed. And they think that they can just short the stock into the ground and make a bunch of money on these shorts. Right. And honestly, maybe it's not right to put sentiments into this, but GameStop is a brick and mortar business during times of COVID I think if somebody said fuck you for shorting a stock, a brick and mortar company during COVID times, I would agree with that. Markets are supposed to be efficient, but kind of fuck you. And anyway, okay, the thing about shorts is that a short squeeze can happen. And so if you are exposed to a short, as in you owe shares back to someone and those shares double in price, all of a sudden you have to buy back the shares that you borrowed at a higher price.
01:01:08.210 - 01:01:32.394, Speaker B: But if you buy back those shares, say, you're saying like, all right, I don't want this trade anymore. I've lost money. I'm just going to buy back the shares. I'll cut my losses and I'll pay bet and I'll return the shares to their owner. If you do that, you buy back the shares and that increases the price because you bought them back. Which means further shorts are then pressured even more. Because as shorts buy back their shares off the secondary market to cover.
01:01:32.394 - 01:02:07.122, Speaker B: They push the price up and up and up, which causes more and more shorts to be influenced to buy back shares. And so it's called a short squeeze. This thing is explosive. It can turn into a positive feedback loop of people buying back shares off the market. And remember, there was more outstanding short interest than the floating supply of stock, of game stock, the shares. And so this thing just rocketed from $20 a share up to, like, $350 a share in, like, three days. Right? And so all the companies that were cut short are down like, 99.9%
01:02:07.122 - 01:02:07.890, Speaker B: on their position.
01:02:07.960 - 01:02:08.146, Speaker A: Right?
01:02:08.168 - 01:02:11.346, Speaker B: And these are all hedge funds. And so this is where the drama starts.
01:02:11.458 - 01:02:25.530, Speaker A: Okay, let me ask you here. So Wall street bets culture, obviously, they want to benefit from this trade, right? We understand that rationale. Do they also want to screw the hedge funds? Do they want to screw the bankers? Was that part of the motivation behind this?
01:02:25.600 - 01:02:42.670, Speaker B: No, that is a secondary after effect. They just saw a position. They just saw a heavily shorted stock, and they all decided, as a community, saying, like, hey, if we all buy GameStop, so many of these hedge funds will have to cover their shorts that it could trigger a short squeeze. That's exactly what happened.
01:02:42.740 - 01:03:15.354, Speaker A: Okay, so what happened to these hedge funds, David? I'm looking at the headline, fucking wrecked. All right? GameStop short sellers lost 1.6 billion in a single day as Reddit traders rebelled against them. That's a 2021 headline. I feel like this is a pretty massive event. This is like main street investors, retail investors, kind of sticking it to the funds in a way that's been kind of the net effect. But the funds got to be pissed about this.
01:03:15.354 - 01:03:17.238, Speaker A: Oh, I'm sure did not be pissed.
01:03:17.254 - 01:03:18.620, Speaker B: If I lost money, too.
01:03:19.970 - 01:03:42.174, Speaker A: But this sort of thing is, let me say, outside of the rules of play, it's a complete off script move. No hedge fund trader. They're all aware of the other traders, another hedge funds who might be coming after them, but none of them anticipated an online community to take this kind of an action. So they were completely caught off guard.
01:03:42.222 - 01:03:59.442, Speaker B: Completely caught off guard, yeah, but they shouldn't be caught off guard if they were paying attention to the fundamentals of GameStop, because they should know that there was a massive amount of short interest out on gamestop. And everyone knows what a short squeeze is. This is not, like, esoteric information. A short squeeze is public knowledge.
01:03:59.506 - 01:03:59.830, Speaker A: Right.
01:03:59.900 - 01:04:34.002, Speaker B: And the other interesting thing is Wall street bets is a public discord. Well, it's also a discord. It's also a subreddit. So all the coordination in the subreddit was done in a public forum where the hedge funds and all their naked short selling is done behind the curtain. Private knowledge. You don't get to know that information. And so this is absolutely a story of just, like, the little guy versus the big elites who have access to financial instruments and have access to financial resources and capital that no one else has access to yet.
01:04:34.002 - 01:04:50.346, Speaker B: The Wall street bets subreddit, they saw the weakness in the armor, and they all realized if they all just go buy the stock, they're going to be able to short squeeze these funds who are trying to wreck this company into the ground. They're going to short squeeze them into oblivion. And that's exactly what happened.
01:04:50.528 - 01:04:53.674, Speaker A: Okay, so fair story so far it sounds like, right?
01:04:53.712 - 01:04:54.970, Speaker B: Fair story, fair story.
01:04:55.040 - 01:05:22.770, Speaker A: All within the rules of play here. Hedge funds are taking massive amounts of risk in taking out these kinds of positions. Naked short selling aside, it's still a massive amount of risk when you're shorting something. And this online community, Wall street bets, is just doing what it normally does. It's seeing an opportunity, and it's pouncing on that opportunity as a community. And the market responds and the stock goes up. End of story.
01:05:22.770 - 01:05:24.850, Speaker A: Right? But it's not the end of story.
01:05:24.920 - 01:05:26.006, Speaker B: No, it's not the end of the.
01:05:26.028 - 01:05:57.040, Speaker A: Story, because the hedge funds and the banking class has something that this Wall street bets rabble, right? This crowd, this online community does not have. They have connections, political connections. They have institutional prowess. They have people that they can call on the phone to get to take certain actions against the unwashed masses in the subreddit. So what?
01:05:58.530 - 01:06:40.502, Speaker B: So a large amount of these Wall street bets traders trade on Robinhood, right? This is the retail trader, the little guy, right? So they use the Robinhood application to make their trades. Robinhood shut down trading on the GameStop stock and also the AMC stock. AMC theaters, right? Another asset that has heavy short interest that started to become a target of further Wall street bet short squeezes, saying, like, hey, like, we just short squeezed the shit out of Gamestop. We could probably do it for AMC. And that began to happen. And yet, Robinhood canceled all trading activity on GameStop and AMC as of this morning. And not only that, but also TD Ameritrade.
01:06:40.502 - 01:07:26.266, Speaker B: And it gets even worse. We're going to show some tweets and some links in a second. They even took their clients positions and sold them for them while the trading activity was halted. Robinhood and TDM, Airtrade and other brokerages made orders on behalf of their customers to sell the stock because of market volatility and market risks. So they did other things with other people's money because allegedly, from what we think is true, is that people who had connections at these funds that got wrecked, I can't remember the name of the fund, called up Robinhood and said, yo, shut this down. And we think that's what happened. And we think that's exactly what Robinhood did.
01:07:26.266 - 01:07:37.114, Speaker B: They shut down trading first. They tried to pause the market two days ago, I think when the GameStop share price went up too fast, they halted trading.
01:07:37.162 - 01:07:39.470, Speaker A: This was like Nasdaq was threatening to you.
01:07:39.540 - 01:07:49.166, Speaker B: Nasdaq halted trading. That was after funds started screaming that they needed to recalibrate their positions, and so they wanted to halt trading.
01:07:49.278 - 01:07:52.878, Speaker A: What is that other than these funds were going bankrupt.
01:07:52.974 - 01:07:54.686, Speaker B: Going bankrupt? Going bankrupt.
01:07:54.718 - 01:08:00.006, Speaker A: Absolutely destroyed. So not only losing billions, but it's costing them their entire business.
01:08:00.108 - 01:08:04.898, Speaker B: Entire fund. The entire fund. Because there is no cap on risk on short selling.
01:08:04.994 - 01:08:20.822, Speaker A: Right. They're making phone calls, and then they stopped trading for a while and they threatened to stop trading. So that happened. But this morning was the action that you're talking about, which is kind of like the unprecedented.
01:08:20.966 - 01:08:22.314, Speaker B: Unprecedented. Yeah.
01:08:22.432 - 01:08:39.198, Speaker A: Where Robin Hood. Like Robin Hood. This is what all the Wall street bets traders use. This is kind of their lifestream into finance, basically, that was being shut down completely from these assets. And their assets were being sold without their permission.
01:08:39.294 - 01:09:24.718, Speaker B: Exactly right. And so this is why when we talk about Uniswap and we talk about being able to control trading and you can't turn it off and you can't permission the assets and you can't permission the network. This is why this is important, because a bunch of hedge funds made a bunch of calls to a bunch of their market running friends saying, like, hey, I want this to stop because I'm losing money. And they did it, and they listened. And not only that, but Discord, which is one of my favorite applications, canceled. The Wall street bets discord server, private company. Sure, they get to cancel whoever they want because it's a private company, but like, fuck, where are all these people supposed to meet? The Wall street bet subreddit had to get locked because it was getting briganded by just a bunch of randos.
01:09:24.718 - 01:09:49.030, Speaker B: Discord is canceling their server, preventing them from being able to coordinate as people. There's nothing more than oppression and silencing than just being able to cancel the place that these people meet and congregate. It's a violation of what makes America so great. And maybe it's not a constitutional violation because private companies get to silence speech as much as they want, but it's still fucking.
01:09:53.070 - 01:10:35.906, Speaker A: People are angry about this injustifiably. So it's because basically, the banker class and the elites and the people with connections and billions of dollars in funds were able to do things that you and I, or normal people, average Joe's people that are on r WallstreetBets, cannot do. They don't have these connections. It's like a different set of rules applies for one group of people versus another. Imagine the power. Just because you are getting wrecked on a trade, to go delist an asset, that's an insane amount of power. And what's so crazy about this, David, is they just did it in broad daylight.
01:10:36.018 - 01:10:37.458, Speaker B: They did. In broad daylight.
01:10:37.554 - 01:11:06.370, Speaker A: So brazen. Did they think that people weren't going to be pissed, that we weren't going to talk about this, that there wasn't going to be massive anger? They just delisted the assets. I mean, these are Robinhood's own customers, right? I can't imagine the amount of pressure that was on Robinhood to get them to turn against their own customers. That affects their business model economically. There must be a massive amount of power here or leverage here to get them to do something like this.
01:11:06.520 - 01:11:20.280, Speaker B: Yeah. People are making calls to say, delete Robinhood. Delist Robinhood. Or delete it from your phone. That's a hashtag that's getting trending on Twitter. Ryan, let's go through some of the tweets and links that we have pulled up. Ready to go.
01:11:20.280 - 01:11:43.790, Speaker B: Representative Talib, actually the same person behind the stable act, calls for congressional hearing on Robinhood's Gamestop actions. Nice drop. Yes. This is a securities market violation. If we believe in free markets in this country, in the United States, then people actually need to get summoned to Congress. They need to go to court. Somebody needs to go to jail or get fined.
01:11:44.530 - 01:11:50.590, Speaker A: So it's good to see representation talking about this issue. Okay, what's the next tweet here?
01:11:50.660 - 01:12:09.286, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, this is from Russell. He's a football player. I'm not into sports, so I'm not going to try and mispronounce his last name, but this is what's going on. This is a starting pistol for this entire industry, especially for DeFi. Russ is a big bitcoiner. He is one of the few players in the NFL to get paid by bitcoin. I don't think he knows about Ethereum or Defi yet.
01:12:09.286 - 01:12:23.818, Speaker B: But if he did, he'd be bullish on it. Gamestop. Get the dirty fiat and turn it into bitcoin immediately. There's values, virtues, and ethos that are exuding out of this industry that the rest of the world needs, that we need to export to the rest of the world.
01:12:23.904 - 01:12:25.450, Speaker A: All right, let's go to the next one.
01:12:25.600 - 01:12:37.360, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Ramp capital. He's a fun meme account. Looks like Robin Hood woke up today and chose violence. Yeah, fuck you, Robin Hood. Tyler Winkleboss, you want this one?
01:12:37.730 - 01:13:11.606, Speaker A: Okay, so what does he say? What kind of a soulless human being do you have to be to short a brick and mortar business during a pandemic? These companies are not even allowed to legally operate. These suits have no solidarity. They care nothing about America. I'm glad Wall street bets is punching back, right? Like he's basically saying, look, they're not good guys here, right? They're just trying to make money. And so when they lose money, they take on this risk and they lose money. So what? Who cares? Put on your big boy pants. This is what the markets do.
01:13:11.606 - 01:13:19.850, Speaker A: You got wrecked. You've wrecked a whole bunch of other people in the past, too. This time you got wrecked, you lost. That's how the game is played. Bye bye. See you later.
01:13:19.920 - 01:13:22.346, Speaker B: Yeah. No do overs in public markets, bro.
01:13:22.448 - 01:13:29.438, Speaker A: No do overs. You can't pull this kind of thing. I agree with Tyler there. Okay, how about this one AOC is talking about?
01:13:29.524 - 01:13:43.406, Speaker B: This is Dave Portnoy. This is Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports. He goes, when AOC and Donald Trump Jr. Are on the same side, you know you fucked up at Robin Hood app. Yeah. AOC and Donald Trump Jr. Both are populist individuals.
01:13:43.406 - 01:13:58.630, Speaker B: One's a populist for the right, one's a populist for the left. This is a populist issue. This is a few against the many against the many issue. And both AOC and Donald Trump Jr. Are populist leaders for their respective camps. And they are, funnily enough, aligned.
01:13:59.930 - 01:14:06.102, Speaker A: This is the Wall street bets chairman here. Is this a meme account or is this an actual representative from Wall street bets?
01:14:06.246 - 01:14:15.034, Speaker B: Definitely. Well, no one can truly represent Wall street bets yet. This guy is one of the leaders of the community. Yeah.
01:14:15.072 - 01:14:25.678, Speaker A: Okay, so what's he saying here? They can only control us because we use their currency. So Wall street bets historically has not been a crypto friendly community or subreddit. Right.
01:14:25.764 - 01:14:26.266, Speaker B: This is true.
01:14:26.308 - 01:14:53.266, Speaker A: If you post something about crypto on Wall street bets, it gets auto banned. I'm not sure if this was an outcropping of, like, 2017 or something where there were so many crypto Spains like Bitconnect. It was just simpler for Reddit moderators to just ignore the noise, but they still maintain that posture. And yet this is kind of making the Wall street bets community open up to crypto, open up to defi as a solution. That seems to be what this tweet is mean.
01:14:53.308 - 01:15:12.090, Speaker B: We are certainly open to Wall street bets. I hope members of the Wall street bet community understands that this industry is young and nascent, and it's not the industry that it was back in 2017. We have grown a lot, and all of a sudden, a lot of the things that we find valuable, I think the Wall street bets community would also find extremely valuable.
01:15:12.250 - 01:15:15.506, Speaker A: Absolutely. All right, let's go to this next one.
01:15:15.688 - 01:15:44.774, Speaker B: Yeah. One hedge fund blows up a million retail investors. Efficient market. Instead, a million retail investors blows up one hedge fund. Market manipulation. This is a disk towards people that are for the same reasons that the Wall street bets discord server got canceled, because the powers that be are claiming that Wall street bets is manipulating the market. If buying spot is manipulating the market, I guess we're all market manipulators.
01:15:44.774 - 01:15:57.722, Speaker B: I guess when you buy something, the price goes up. Is that market manipulation? No, it's market manipulation. To call up Robinhood and say, cancel trading, that's market manipulation. Buying spot is not market manipulation.
01:15:57.866 - 01:16:02.574, Speaker A: Yeah, totally agree. It's crazy that they would even propose that. What's this one?
01:16:02.692 - 01:16:39.818, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a screenshot of somebody who tried to place an order inside of Robinhood. And Robinhood gives them an error message. They wanted to cancel the order that Robinhood placed on their behalf. Robinhood shows them an error message saying, we're sorry, this order can't be canceled, as we placed it to mitigate the risk to your account. Who the fuck are you to control other people's money? You don't know what risk is. The only reason why markets know what risk is is because a diverse set of market participants all bear their own individual risks and they all place their own individual bets. You don't get to determine what other people's risk is.
01:16:39.984 - 01:17:11.366, Speaker A: We're screwing you over for your know, this kind of reminds me. We've talked about it so often, but like the SEC credited investor laws, where you have to have a certain net worth in order to invest in a million dollars or over in order to invest at a startup, it's reminiscent of this sort of thing. It's like, sorry, retail investor. You're not smart enough, you're not sophisticated enough to do this. You're not elite enough to do this. So we're going to wall you off from this little corner of finance. We're going to handle this for you.
01:17:11.366 - 01:17:19.622, Speaker A: We're going to sell your shares in the brokerage account because it's too dangerous. Absolutely insane that this is the error message that they would put up to.
01:17:19.676 - 01:17:21.722, Speaker B: Dude, this one's even worse. Read this one out.
01:17:21.856 - 01:17:36.430, Speaker A: We don't let you buy, only sell. And even if you don't sell, we will sell it against your will. This is Robinhood terms of service. Is this an email that someone got? So that was a Twitter comment about an email. What's the email say?
01:17:36.500 - 01:18:16.150, Speaker B: Yeah, the email is from Robinhood to this user's inbox, I'm assuming and says important information about your Robinhood account. In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, aka, you can only sell. However, due to the unreasonable risk involved in brokering your position, we have closed your 14,500 shares of GME. That's GameStop for an average price of $118 on January 18, 2021. They just executed orders with their customers money on their behalf. That's crazy. That's absolutely insane.
01:18:16.150 - 01:18:17.270, Speaker B: That's absolutely insane.
01:18:17.350 - 01:18:36.066, Speaker A: All right, so what does this all mean? Right? Populism. People are pissed. Banks are doing things with political connections. Bankers and hedge fund managers and the wealthy elite are doing things that retail can't do. David, Defi fixes this.
01:18:36.168 - 01:18:40.100, Speaker B: Defi fixes this. This is what we have been chanting for. So.
01:18:42.070 - 01:19:08.406, Speaker A: You can't. You can't delist an asset from Uniswap. In fact, anyone in the world can list an asset on uniswap. It hasn't happened. On uniswap, it can't happen. This is the idea behind protocols rather than banks. This is the idea behind outsourcing.
01:19:08.406 - 01:19:37.974, Speaker A: This sort of, like, creating institutions that are not based on corruptible human beings, right? This is what DeFi is all about. This openness, this transparency, this access to the world. Everybody has a fair playing field. It doesn't matter what country you're from. It doesn't matter what bankers, you know, what politicians you can call, how much money you have. Everybody is treated equally. Everybody is treated the same.
01:19:37.974 - 01:19:56.458, Speaker A: This is an institution that makes way more sense to build on top of than the corrupted banking institution right now. Is this a Defi moment? Maybe doesn't realize it yet, but is this a Defi moment for us, this.
01:19:56.464 - 01:20:55.326, Speaker B: Is an absolute Defi moment. And I think if people were more savvy to what's going on, I think we would see, because markets are supposed to be efficient. If some news breaks, then assets tend to move. The reason why I think that it's going to take a while for people to digest this information and then connect it to DeFi on Ethereum, because if people did make those connections, we would see assets like you and I just absolutely mooning right now. I think that's the case. And the important thing, I think, to take away from this whole ordeal is that things that are deep in the protocol sink, the protocol sync thesis that we chant about all the time on the bankless program, the things that are deep in the protocol sync, the things that are neutral are inherently flat. They are flat landscapes for economic activity, right? And that flat landscape means a neutral playing field, a flat playing field where no one has advantages over any others.
01:20:55.326 - 01:21:40.374, Speaker B: And that's what scares all the legacy institutions, is because they have built systems that are not flat. They have built systems that privilege themselves over their users, over other people. And the elites are on the peaks when everyone else is in the troughs, right? And this is what Ethereum can bring to the world, a loving playing field. Bitcoin is famously known as the separation of money and state. And ethereum is the separation of economy and state. There's no reason why the economy, the quote, unquote, the market, should be under control of robinhood or TD ameritrade, or anyone that can pick up a phone call, make a phone call and stop canceling. If somebody has the ability to stop trading of something, then the market is controlled.
01:21:40.374 - 01:21:53.238, Speaker B: And the market inherently does better when it's not controlled. The free market is not free unless it actually manifests itself on Ethereum. There's no other place in the world to have a free market other than ethereum.
01:21:53.354 - 01:22:05.458, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so here's the thing. Listeners of bankless will know that we are bullish. Bitcoin. Like, we like bitcoin. It's a good asset. But bitcoin doesn't fix this.
01:22:05.458 - 01:22:44.278, Speaker A: It doesn't have the answer to this problem. Right? Coinbase, binance, anywhere that you can purchase bitcoin today can still delist those assets with a phone call. With a phone call with government regulation. Right? So, like, bitcoin is one part of the DeFi story, but if you just stop with bitcoin maximalists and maximalism, you don't get what we're talking about. A censorship resistant, permissionless, open financial system that solves the problem of GameStop and Robinhood, you need something like uniswap. You need money protocols in order to do this. I've seen many kind of maxillist like, thought leaders say, yeah, bitcoin's the solution.
01:22:44.278 - 01:23:10.102, Speaker A: And it's like, no, it's not, dude. It's not like Defi is the solution. I was glad one of the Winklevoss twins said that. It's bitcoin, Ethereum and Defi. Without all of these things, you can't actually solve what we're talking about today. We've been saying this since the beginning. You need a bankless money system if you're going to have a free money system, or else you get the same system that we've already built.
01:23:10.102 - 01:23:52.514, Speaker A: It's just built on a different store of value. New set of bosses, new set of bankers. That's not what we want. Ethereum really does solve this, David, maybe you've got a comment on that. But I also want to ask you about what is it really going to take for the world to start seeing this? Is the user experience just too hard on Defi now? Is it just like, for somebody who's used to Robinhood and they switch over to crypto and Defi, and they have to do metamask and they have to do private key management, and there's gas fees on uniswap, is that just all too much, or what do you think? Why haven't we seen this influx of retail coming from the disenfranchised Wall street bets crowd?
01:23:52.642 - 01:24:32.718, Speaker B: Well, I think a very simple answer is to say that GameStop is not available on, like, that's not where the GameStop, the asset trades. And so first, we just need assets on Ethereum that people are interested in. And while many of these defi tokens that we are so hyped about, I think are truly revolutionary, they are unfamiliar to the legacy market participants who are looking to. Because when Wall street bets chats, they're not chatting about DeFI tokens, they're chatting about things on Robinhood. Robinhood has actually done a terrible job adding new assets, crypto assets, into their platform. They actually have a category in crypto assets called the Ethereum family. You want to know what's in there, Ryan?
01:24:32.894 - 01:24:34.978, Speaker A: Yeah. What's the Ethereum family?
01:24:35.064 - 01:24:36.830, Speaker B: Ethereum and Ethereum classic.
01:24:36.990 - 01:24:37.860, Speaker A: Oh, my.
01:24:38.970 - 01:24:40.114, Speaker B: Terrible, terrible.
01:24:40.242 - 01:24:46.550, Speaker A: Correct me if I'm wrong, but with Robinhood, David, you can't actually withdraw to an ETH address.
01:24:46.620 - 01:24:49.010, Speaker B: Basically, you don't get access to the underlying.
01:24:49.090 - 01:25:14.394, Speaker A: What they're selling you is ious of something. They could pull the same shit they just pulled on GameStop, which is like, sell your eth out from under you. Take it, like, cancel it, delete it. They can pull all of that because they are purely a bank selling ious. They're not selling actual ether that you can withdraw from their exchange. Robinhood is not the place. If you're a millennial, if you're a zoomer, go level up on DFI.
01:25:14.394 - 01:25:27.990, Speaker A: We're going to need this tech for the hope this week made it obvious we need to be leveling up on these things. And I feel like sometimes, David, people just like, it's too hard, right? It's not that hard.
01:25:28.140 - 01:25:33.560, Speaker B: Yeah. And you got paid $20,000 if you DFI in 2020. What do you mean it's not hard?
01:25:36.810 - 01:25:52.826, Speaker A: Your friends outside of crypto, right? What do you think their reaction is going to be as a result of this? They say something about this. I know they're going to talk about this. And you say, yeah, this is why DFI exists. So what's their objection to coming on board of DFI? What are they going to say?
01:25:52.928 - 01:26:17.070, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good question. There is a group chat that I'm in of roughly twelve people who are people that are DFI curious, but many of them come from the legacy markets. And there was just general consensus that this pissed them off. This just riled them up. And I think that's the energy that we need for people to feel. That is motivation. That's pure motivation.
01:26:17.070 - 01:26:22.678, Speaker B: They're angry at something, and DeFI allows that anger to be expressed in productive ways.
01:26:22.764 - 01:26:23.206, Speaker A: Right.
01:26:23.308 - 01:26:59.214, Speaker B: We can take that riled up energy and we can put it into the Defi ecosystem. I think that the barrier to adoption and the barrier to understanding just got a lot lower. It's a frequent phrase that we say on the bankless program that the most bullish thing about this industry is to become understood. And this is one of the most exposing pieces of news that has ever come across the news cycle at all. The canceling of an asset on an exchange. That's insane. I don't think there's ever going to be this one magic moment where all of a sudden all of Wall street bets is like, yo, let's go trade on uniswap.
01:26:59.214 - 01:27:09.714, Speaker B: It's just going to be a slow trickle, but like I said, the barrier is getting lower and lower and lower, and it's allowing more and more water to fall over it faster and faster.
01:27:09.842 - 01:27:38.240, Speaker A: Yeah. And at the same time, Defi is getting more and more so. The truth is, if we had that influx now from Wall street bets, we couldn't take it. I mean, too many transactions, gas fees would spike. But at the same time, Ethereum, Defi is developing L2, right, to start to other containers for this liquidity and for these users. So we also don't want it to happen all at once. It's, like, better for it to kind of trickle in.
01:27:38.240 - 01:28:16.166, Speaker A: But look, man, this is populism. This is the feel like this is not going to go away. It's only, if anything else, it's coming from the right, it's coming from the left in politics, it's only going to get worse. And one of the reasons, David, I'm in this industry, and I think this is true for you, is because this allows us to channel populism and this anger into something productive. We're not just focused on tearing it down, right. Because you could look at this and get pissed like, I want to revolt. I want to occupy Wall Street, I want to storm the banks.
01:28:16.166 - 01:28:41.614, Speaker A: I want to get the hedge funds who did this. That's one approach. The DeFi, the crypto approach, is we're going to build a new system that's credibly neutral and doesn't have the dependencies of the old system. And all that anger that we feel, we're going to channel that into something productive. We're going to build an entirely new financial system from the ground up. Right. Because populism can get really ugly for human beings.
01:28:41.614 - 01:29:01.994, Speaker A: Like, famously, the 1930s, populism led to a world war. Right. That could happen here. But the reason I'm in Ethereum, the reason I'm in DFI and crypto is because it's a way to channel that populism into a movement that is all about building new structures and institutions for the world. So it's exciting from that perspective, too.
01:29:02.112 - 01:29:21.710, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right. Another concept that we talk about on the bankless program frequently is that before 2008, there was no place to exit to. Right. And then bitcoin came. Right. And in 2021, in the financial crisis of 2000 and 22,021, because of COVID there is actually a place to exit, too. Right.
01:29:21.710 - 01:29:27.310, Speaker B: There is actually a way for that populist angst and that populist energy to be expressed, invented.
01:29:27.390 - 01:29:27.634, Speaker A: Right.
01:29:27.672 - 01:30:00.358, Speaker B: We actually have solutions for this. To me, this really echoes sentiments of the fourth turning concept, where there is distrust in legacy institutions. No better of a more salient example of institutions canceling their customers orders against their will to profit, to make sure that the elites can keep their money distrust in institutions. Meanwhile, we are erecting new institutions for people to adopt instead. So we are changing the guard. It's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take a decade.
01:30:00.358 - 01:30:08.666, Speaker B: But people are looking for new institutions these days because their old institutions are failing them. And there's no better, more salient of example than what happened recently.
01:30:08.778 - 01:30:34.680, Speaker A: Absolutely. Well, this is turning into an interesting year for sure, with 2020. I think this is going to be a big year for crypto, a big year for the social movement that is crypto, the technology that is crypto, and probably the price in the bull market that is crypto right now. So very exciting. We're glad to have you on bankless, David. You feel like you got that out of your system, man, this is catharsis for you. I know you were angry this morning.
01:30:35.210 - 01:30:56.506, Speaker B: I was pretty angry this morning. And the thing is, my one final comment on this is there's no reason to think that this was a one and done. The Wall street bets community just figured out that they are a force. They are a fund, just like actual funds. They are a collective community of people that have the ability to allocate capital.
01:30:56.618 - 01:30:57.950, Speaker A: They are a dow.
01:30:58.850 - 01:31:23.698, Speaker B: They are a dow. They are literally a dow. And they are only going to grow massively. First off, all of them just got really rich, even though some of them kind of got wrecked by Robinhood. People that were making the trade before the short squeeze just made massive upsides. Like if you were in options, you could have turned $1,000 into $20 to $50,000, depending on your position. So now they're well funded.
01:31:23.698 - 01:31:42.574, Speaker B: Now they realize that they are a force. They are more organized, they are more coordinated with each other. And I think that this is just going to be the first of many coordination attacks on legacy institutions like this. Legacy markets. I think this is going to be only the first of many episodes like this to come.
01:31:42.772 - 01:32:06.662, Speaker A: Well, I can't wait for that group to start to get their minds wrapped around Defi, and I'm excited to help in any way. So, David, this has been our roll up. As always, guys, risks and disclaimers. Defi is risky. ETH is risky. Apparently, so are the traditional financial markets. Weird, but you can lose what you put in, of course.
01:32:06.662 - 01:32:12.690, Speaker A: But this is the frontier. We are headed west. Thanks for joining us. This has been the weekly roll up from bankless.
