00:00:00.250 - 00:00:09.774, Speaker A: Oh, my God. They're large. 4.2 trillion. Trillion with a t. Okay. And BlackRock is double that size.
00:00:09.774 - 00:00:32.806, Speaker A: Oh, my God. That's like, between them. A lot of they got all the assets, all the money, but what does this do for our bags? That's a big question here. Bankless nation. It is the last Friday of June, and it's time for something special, something we release every single Friday. David, what time is it?
00:00:32.828 - 00:00:46.858, Speaker B: Oh, it's time for the Friday Bankless weekly rollover, where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless. Fully caffeinated. I had a coffee. I also had tea this morning, actually, as well. I had both.
00:00:46.944 - 00:01:03.600, Speaker A: Well, good for you. And I got to enjoy some of your coffee in your apartment where you live in person. For all the haters, for all the doubters out there, david, can you confirm for the people that Ryan Sean Adams is a physical, real human being?
00:01:04.610 - 00:01:26.934, Speaker B: You do have matter. There are atoms. There's still room for you being an AI. But yes, Ryan and I were actually hanging out in person, doing some coworking in the Bankless offices this last week, which was pretty interesting. The Bankless Nation is going to see some side by side, same camera, same microphone, podcast coming out on the very, very rare stuff.
00:01:26.972 - 00:01:39.622, Speaker A: We should put them as NFTs. They should be collectibles. But that's not all. We got some big topics of the week. Number one, Bitcoin hits a new all time high. Wait, what? Did you rate that? Yeah, it didn't hit all time high. What do we mean, technically?
00:01:39.686 - 00:01:41.222, Speaker B: And technically, it did. Technically.
00:01:41.286 - 00:01:44.266, Speaker A: Okay, you have to explain that one to me. What else we got?
00:01:44.368 - 00:02:03.102, Speaker B: Staking also hits a new all time high and formally passes supply on exchanges. We're going to get into the details around that. The Bitcoin ETF race turns up, like, two notches. It's getting real, really hot. ZK Sync drops the ZK stack, and there's a new AirDrop targeting E Stakers. So check out your eligibility.
00:02:03.166 - 00:02:04.946, Speaker A: That's me. David, that's you. E staker? Yeah.
00:02:04.968 - 00:02:06.046, Speaker B: You get your tokens?
00:02:06.158 - 00:02:29.290, Speaker A: I hope so. I can't wait for you to tell me what they are, how to do that. We also have something really cool that we want to share. This is more than friends and sponsors, all right? This is a conference that David and I support. This is a Bankless plus blockworks conference. It's called permissionless. This is the only conference I go to every single year.
00:02:29.290 - 00:02:39.374, Speaker A: This will be the next time you and I meet, I think. David, tell us what is going on at Permissionless. What are the dates? Who's speaking? Why should Bankless listeners be excited about this?
00:02:39.412 - 00:03:01.522, Speaker B: I've been heads down, working with the blockwork team to finalize this agenda, and, man, it's really coming together. Okay, so Permissionless, september 13, 11th through 13th in Austin, Texas. While everyone is paper handing the absolute F out of the United States. Permissionless is going to Texas. So we got Eric Voorhees, we got Representative.
00:03:01.586 - 00:03:02.898, Speaker A: Is this even legal?
00:03:02.994 - 00:03:20.038, Speaker B: Are we allowed to crypto people are allowed to assemble and so we are fulfilling our patriotic duty by assembling in Texas. We have Tom Emmer and hester purse on a panel together. That's going to be really sick. Hazu is coming in. Kevin Owaki. Melton demirz. Jim bianco.
00:03:20.038 - 00:03:44.814, Speaker B: It's going to be one half of a reunion of every single Bankless podcast episode. And one half of a reunion of every single Blockworks podcast episode. I'm pretty stoked for this. We're putting Solana, Cosmos and Ethereum people all on a panel together to talk about differences coming together. And also fighting. Hollow from Polygon. Ben Jones from Optimism, vance Spencer from Framework.
00:03:44.814 - 00:04:06.198, Speaker B: Torgal from scroll. So all the layer twos, everyone who is fighting as a family will all be there at permissionless. Look at this lineup, dude. Anatoli raj Santiago jesse Pollocks donnie michael Anderson tarun Lee Jin jim Bianco I already said his name, but it's worth saying him twice. Man it's quite the lineup. It's quite the lineup.
00:04:06.294 - 00:04:08.678, Speaker A: Very exciting. So what should folks do if they want to get a ticket?
00:04:08.694 - 00:04:35.060, Speaker B: David oh, if you are a Bankless citizen, you should definitely use your code to get 30% off. You can find that code in the discord or in the Bankless perks page. There's also a hackathon this year, so first time we're doing this hackathon this year. And there's also a dev track as well because we're really expanding the F out of permission list this year. So link in the show notes to get your ticket. If you subscribe to Bankless, you get 30% off, which is more than pays for your ticket. So that's what the rational economic agent would do there.
00:04:35.830 - 00:04:37.090, Speaker A: Do we have any of those?
00:04:37.240 - 00:04:40.600, Speaker B: I don't know if we'll find out any of those.
00:04:41.530 - 00:04:48.866, Speaker A: No. I have faith in the Bankless nation. David let's get to markets, though. What's Bitcoin doing? You told me this was all time high. I feel tricked.
00:04:48.978 - 00:04:53.434, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not in dollars, but it is an all time high. It is at an all time high.
00:04:53.472 - 00:04:55.450, Speaker A: Okay, well, what price are we at this week?
00:04:55.520 - 00:05:05.134, Speaker B: Bitcoin started the week at $30,000, ending the week at $30,500. Nice and healthy. 30. You really got to appreciate that.
00:05:05.252 - 00:05:08.494, Speaker A: 300:30K. I'm feeling great.
00:05:08.532 - 00:05:12.398, Speaker B: Yeah. Above 30K, I'm just feeling just fine. I'm happy with that.
00:05:12.564 - 00:05:20.674, Speaker A: Of course, we are watching this on the Kraken charts. Play out. Kraken pro. Easy enough for me to use it. How about ether this week? We up, we down.
00:05:20.792 - 00:05:28.934, Speaker B: Down a little bit. Ether started the week at 1885, ending the week at 1850, down a percent and a half. So Bitcoin up a percent and Ether down a percent and a half.
00:05:29.052 - 00:05:36.520, Speaker A: Hanging out in the 18 hundreds. Yeah, the Victorian age, Civil War era, 1850s, 1860s.
00:05:37.370 - 00:05:45.690, Speaker B: I don't know. Every time Ether goes through the 19 hundreds, I'm like, oh, my birthday, birthday, year.
00:05:45.840 - 00:05:49.270, Speaker A: All right, let's do Bitcoin ETH on the ratio.
00:05:49.350 - 00:05:50.678, Speaker B: We don't have to do that one. We can skip.
00:05:50.694 - 00:05:51.894, Speaker A: No, we can't.
00:05:51.942 - 00:05:53.034, Speaker B: It's down weeks.
00:05:53.072 - 00:05:56.078, Speaker A: Where you want to skip it are the weeks that they're more oh, that.
00:05:56.084 - 00:05:59.454, Speaker B: Is a deadline that goes down into the right. Yeah, I'm scrolling out.
00:05:59.492 - 00:06:00.142, Speaker A: It's still down.
00:06:00.196 - 00:06:01.150, Speaker B: Yeah, it still goes down.
00:06:01.220 - 00:06:03.614, Speaker A: When does it at all? Has it gone ever gone up?
00:06:03.652 - 00:06:05.040, Speaker B: Yes, it has gone up.
00:06:06.050 - 00:06:09.700, Speaker A: How about on the year? Let's scroll at least to there. Okay. I'm going to get a year.
00:06:10.070 - 00:06:16.994, Speaker B: It's just been flat ever since. Even like, the start of the last bull market. It's between zero six and, like, zero eight.
00:06:17.112 - 00:06:17.842, Speaker A: All right.
00:06:17.976 - 00:06:20.114, Speaker B: Definitely on the lower side of the ratio.
00:06:20.162 - 00:06:31.386, Speaker A: Bitcoin gaining some steam this week. Maybe that's why you told me it was at an all time high. And we'll find out more about that, I think. But before we get there, total crypto market cap is that looking at on.
00:06:31.408 - 00:06:35.770, Speaker B: The week, we are coming in at $1.2 trillion. So healthy.
00:06:36.190 - 00:06:47.642, Speaker A: Okay. The numbers in my head are bitcoin over 30K, feeling good. ETH price over two K. I'm feeling good. It's not there yet, but I'd feel good. If that was the case. Crypto market cap over 1 trillion.
00:06:47.642 - 00:06:58.626, Speaker A: I'm still feeling good. So overall, I mean, this bear market has been hard, I guess, but I don't know. At $1 trillion market cap, how hard has it actually been?
00:06:58.728 - 00:07:18.342, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the topic of discussion, I think. And we'll get into this further into the market section. First off, Bitcoin new all time high, $7.6 million Argentine pesos. So new bitcoin all time high for the country of Argentina. For the fiat currency of Argentina. Reminder, all Fiat currencies go to zero.
00:07:18.342 - 00:07:20.140, Speaker B: Some just go faster than others.
00:07:20.830 - 00:07:26.582, Speaker A: You feel rugged. Bankless listener David told us all time high. Now he's saying it's in Argentinian pesos.
00:07:26.646 - 00:07:48.642, Speaker B: Hey, it depends on your frame of reference, my man. Not only is that a little bit of an all time high that has screamed past the all time high, this is just a good reminder of inflation in fiat currencies are bad and the strength of the US dollar is a privilege. And all other fiat currencies are weaker than the dollar. And we shit on the dollar all the time.
00:07:48.776 - 00:08:14.778, Speaker A: Yeah, it is. And the only reason the dollar looks somewhat good at, like, five to 10% inflation rate is because everything is like a lot of other assets are so much worse. A lot of other fiat currencies are so much worse. That's why the dollar looks good sometimes. This is interesting, though. Argentine Congress approves IMF debt deal that would discourage crypto usage. So this is what I worry about.
00:08:14.778 - 00:08:41.522, Speaker A: When fiat based countries, which is all of them, start to feel under threat from crypto, what do they do when they start to bleed? Relative to other fiats, of course. But relative to crypto assets. What do they do? We haven't yet seen this kind of reaction in the US. Because I don't think we've bled hard enough. But this is interesting. Discouraging crypto use in Argentina. That seems like a big step.
00:08:41.522 - 00:08:42.546, Speaker A: What do you think about this?
00:08:42.648 - 00:09:03.494, Speaker B: The quote from the article that stands out to me. To further safeguard financial stability, we are taking important steps to discourage the use of cryptocurrencies with a view to prevent money laundering. Informality and disintermediation. They're trying to prevent disintermediation. I would like to encourage disintermediation. That's what I'm here. They're trying to prevent informality.
00:09:03.494 - 00:09:04.570, Speaker B: What does that even mean?
00:09:04.640 - 00:09:09.430, Speaker A: I don't know. To me, you sound like a money launderer. Right now. You're talking like a money launderer.
00:09:09.510 - 00:09:14.490, Speaker B: I'm also a terrorist. Someone's going to clip that out of context.
00:09:14.570 - 00:09:31.666, Speaker A: That's going to be fantastic. Yeah. Preventing money laundering. That's the reason they'll give. It has nothing, of course, to do with the inflation of the peso in our country. I look at this and I'm kind of like, yeah, coming to a fiat economy near you. Watch out for this kind of thing, right?
00:09:31.688 - 00:09:32.914, Speaker B: It's going to us. Yeah.
00:09:33.032 - 00:09:41.634, Speaker A: Okay. This is interesting from Charlie Bitcoin return since 2010. This is on the yearly year start year end. What are we looking at in this table?
00:09:41.682 - 00:10:04.490, Speaker B: It's just a nice reminder of what Bitcoin does every single year, which is always the answer to that is always large, either red or green. 2010, 9900%. 2011, 1400%. 2012, 186%. 2013, 5500%. And then 2014, negative 58%. And like, with negative 58%, that cuts all previous numbers by half.
00:10:04.490 - 00:10:23.234, Speaker B: Right? And then 35%, 125%, 1300%. And then 2018, negative 73%. So 2022, we had negative 65%, 2023, year to date, 85% in the green for Bitcoin. And so it's just like, also the regularity of the red years.
00:10:23.352 - 00:10:27.522, Speaker A: David, this is a pat, are you seeing the pattern here? Bankless list.
00:10:27.576 - 00:10:47.562, Speaker B: Three greens and a red. Three greens and a 2010. 2010 doesn't count, nor 2010, three greens and a red. So we had red in 2022, year to date, 2023, strongly in the green. I think we get two more greens and then we get a red. And so what? Are you serious? 24 is green, perhaps very green. 25 is very green.
00:10:47.562 - 00:10:49.146, Speaker B: 2026 is in the red.
00:10:49.248 - 00:10:51.466, Speaker A: Is this ta, sir? Are we traders now?
00:10:51.568 - 00:11:00.160, Speaker B: I look forward to once again not selling in 2025 and then having this clipped out. And I said, like, oh, I was going to say I should sell in 2025.
00:11:00.690 - 00:11:21.414, Speaker A: I totally think this is the base case for how it plays out again. And what this says is, since Bitcoin has been in existence, it's only been unprofitable. You bought at the beginning of the year, three years out of, like, the 1213 plus years it's been in existence. Just three years. It's been a bad deal, let me tell you.
00:11:21.532 - 00:11:27.000, Speaker B: The negative 60%, the 1300% trump those.
00:11:27.370 - 00:11:30.654, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd say so. Over time has appreciated.
00:11:30.722 - 00:11:44.090, Speaker B: I made this in Photoshop just before we started recording the red part of this graph, which is this is a Bitcoin chart. That is the only part of the chart that is in the red. That's a lot of green.
00:11:44.240 - 00:11:56.650, Speaker A: So you're saying if you bought from about 2021 to halfway through 2022, in 2022, you're in the red, but if you bought anytime before that, you're still in the money on your bitcoin purchase.
00:11:56.730 - 00:12:32.138, Speaker B: And also anytime between now and halfway through 2022. So this is what I'm calling Schrodinger's market. So where are we in the bull market bear market cycle? Are we just closing the 2022 gap? 2022 was just too bad, too much blood. That we just mean reverted, or are we at the beginning stages of a bull market? So if you go back to like, we can't do this because I didn't include it in the screenshot. But if you go back and look at the 2017 bull market, it started in 2015. That was when the up only markets began. But in 2015, you felt like you were in a bear market because it.
00:12:32.144 - 00:12:34.698, Speaker A: Starts the year after the red year, right? Yes.
00:12:34.784 - 00:12:44.640, Speaker B: And so right now we're in shortingers market. Are we just recovering from the bear or are we at the start of the bull? It's kind of the same thing, but you don't really know where you are. And it feels the same.
00:12:45.010 - 00:12:53.074, Speaker A: It does feel the same, but I feel like I know where I am, you know what I mean? It's probably just going to play out the same way it always does.
00:12:53.192 - 00:12:54.580, Speaker B: Three greens and a red.
00:12:56.230 - 00:13:02.994, Speaker A: This is pretty cool. Staked ETH now exceeds ETH on centralized exchanges. We're going bankless FAM. What's this chart?
00:13:03.122 - 00:13:21.478, Speaker B: This chart, we showed this last week and maybe even the week before, but these lines have touched. What are the lines? One line. The top line, which is now the bottom line, is Ether on centralized exchanges. Loser line. The winner line is the bottom line, which is now the top line is Ether being staked. So more staked than on exchanges.
00:13:21.574 - 00:13:22.858, Speaker A: Is this the flipping, sir?
00:13:22.944 - 00:13:24.054, Speaker B: This is a flipping.
00:13:24.182 - 00:13:27.390, Speaker A: Okay, not the flipping, the flipping.
00:13:28.130 - 00:13:35.402, Speaker B: 20 million Ether is currently staked with a 2.9 million Ether of queued. Ether to stake.
00:13:35.466 - 00:13:38.190, Speaker A: Wow, that's a lot of ETH waiting outside.
00:13:38.260 - 00:13:42.046, Speaker B: 15% of all staked Ether is in the queue. That's insane.
00:13:42.158 - 00:13:47.590, Speaker A: It just keeps growing. They just keep staking. When are they going to stop staking, David?
00:13:48.170 - 00:13:50.070, Speaker B: When are they going to stop staking?
00:13:50.730 - 00:13:58.566, Speaker A: What is this? From Poop man. It looks like a fantastic, very credible account here. Poop man. What's he got for us here?
00:13:58.588 - 00:14:29.774, Speaker B: Just talking about the growth of ETH staking. It has slowed down in the last 30 days, but that's after the acceleration of post merge. He says, I'm very optimistic about the LSD market. He has checked Dune Analytics and found some interesting stats. The fastest growing swell network with 58% growth, and followed by Figment with 57% growth. And then the largest outflows of ether is Huobi and Bitstamp, two centralized exchanges. He follows and says Swell means to be the staking superstar out of the bear market because its successful pearl incentive campaign is like the AirDrop teasing campaign.
00:14:29.774 - 00:14:49.462, Speaker B: Meanwhile, centralized exchanges such as Coinbase and Huobi are getting a downturn, likely due to regulatory issues. So this is just talking about some data out of the staking. As a service industry, Swell has a lot of growth, but although it is still very small so it's got like 28,000, it's still a sliver of overall east stake.
00:14:49.526 - 00:15:09.262, Speaker A: It's one of these tiny slivers over here, isn't it? Yeah, I don't even know where it is, but it's certainly not the 31% of Lido or still the 9.5%. But it is good. It is great to see that competition entering the market. David, what do we have coming up next?
00:15:09.316 - 00:15:40.434, Speaker B: Coming up next, ZK Sync releases the ZK Stack and why it's got me all hot and bothered. Boy, do I love biomimicry systems. The ETF war heats the absolute f up. Fidelity, Arkinvest, Vanek all enter the race. But Ark jumps to first in line with this one simple trick. How did they do it? How did they do? Yeah.

Mantle, formerly known as Bitdao, is the first Dowled web3 ecosystem, all built on top of Mantle's first core product, the Mantle Network, a brand new high performance ethereum layer two, built using the Op stack but uses Eigen layer's data availability solution instead of the expensive ethereum layer one. Not only does this reduce Mantle Network's gas fees by 80%, but it also reduces gas fee volatility, providing a more stable foundation for Mantle's applications. The Mantle Treasury is one of the biggest Dow owned Treasuries, which is seeding an ecosystem of projects from all around the Web three space for Mantle. Mantle already has subcommunities from around web3 onboarded like Game Seven for Web Three gaming and buybit for TVL and Liquidity and onram.
00:17:01.390 - 00:17:19.230, Speaker B: So if you want to build on the Mantle network, mantle is offering a grants program that provides milestone based funding to promising projects that help expand secure and decentralize Mantle. If you want to get started working with the first dowled layer two ecosystem, check out Mantle at Mantle XYZ and follow them on Twitter at zero xmantle.
00:17:19.330 - 00:17:22.506, Speaker A: A big release from ZkSync this week. David, what are we looking at?
00:17:22.608 - 00:17:49.390, Speaker B: ZK Sync releases the ZK Stack, a modular framework for building sovereign ZK powered hyperchains based on Zksync's open source code. So ZK stack sounds a little bit like op stack. If you're using the Op stack as a frame of reference, you're off to a great start. What's a stack? Why do they call them stacks? Yeah, it's like a tech stack. It's like a technology stack. And so the ZK stack. What does ZK sync do? ZkSync does zero knowledge cryptography.
00:17:49.390 - 00:18:14.502, Speaker B: But as a layer two, the one thing that they really do is their ZK circuit. What is ZK Sync? They make the ZK circuit. Everything else about ZkSync is kind of a commodity. They settle to ethereum. They use ethereum data. They use other parts, other components that could produce a layer two the rest of what that makes up the ZK Sync layer two. ZK Sync Era is more or less a commodity.
00:18:14.502 - 00:18:26.254, Speaker B: They make the ZK circuit. So what is the ZK stack? It is ZK Sync's ZK circuit as a framework where you can take in the rest of the components of what makes a layer two and build your own layer two.
00:18:26.372 - 00:18:28.160, Speaker A: Build your own chain FAM.
00:18:28.530 - 00:19:06.940, Speaker B: Build a ZK workshop is what it is. And so the ZK Stack allows teams to build their custom HyperChain, which is ZK Sync's fractal, scaling, branding, a fully trustless, cheap, asynchronous connectivity to the rest of the HyperChain ecosystem. Now, this is the secret sauce that the ZK element has that the optimistic roll up worlds do not have ZK circuits. Chains that all use a ZK circuit have a crazy amount of composability right out of the gate because that is the magic of ZK. And so ZK chains like ZK chain A that uses the same circuit as ZK chain B have a ton of composability tailwinds and benefits.
00:19:08.270 - 00:19:20.880, Speaker A: Will it be like you have the asset on the same chain? Will it be that easy to move from chain to chain? And also, if I can fit two questions in one here, oh boy, is this a layer three? Is what we're basically talking about here.
00:19:21.490 - 00:19:40.610, Speaker B: Both answers are kind of maybe yes. So to take the simple one first, is this a layer three? It can be a layer three. It is an open framework for deploying chains. You want to deploy layer two, you want to deploy a layer three, you want to deploy a layer N. You want to deploy a chain between chains. Fractal hyperscaling. Think of it like just a root system of chains.
00:19:40.610 - 00:19:46.130, Speaker B: Layer three is a very like number three. It's not so canonical.
00:19:46.210 - 00:19:47.362, Speaker A: It's more like a tree branch.
00:19:47.426 - 00:19:49.398, Speaker B: Tree branch, exactly. Root system. Yeah.
00:19:49.484 - 00:19:50.462, Speaker A: Branches of trees.
00:19:50.546 - 00:19:54.266, Speaker B: Yeah. What was the first question that you had? I only can do one question at a time.
00:19:54.368 - 00:20:02.170, Speaker A: Yeah, well, the first question was, you know, David, I can't remember. It's been one of those weeks, my friend.
00:20:02.240 - 00:20:14.890, Speaker B: Yes, it definitely has. Okay, so moving on. Maybe I'll think of it. ZK stack is a lightweight sequencer with low latency of sequencing. That's the ZK element. Apps that can interact without the trust assumption of bridges.
00:20:14.970 - 00:20:16.338, Speaker A: Also the I know.
00:20:16.424 - 00:20:17.060, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:17.910 - 00:20:28.918, Speaker A: I was asking you if the experience will be like, I have my assets on the chain. What the experience is like from going from one ZK enabled chain on the ZK stack to another.
00:20:29.004 - 00:20:46.874, Speaker B: Right. The answer is kind of it depends. The easy answer is yes. The harder answer is like yes. And there takes a bunch of additional supporting infrastructure and development and abstraction to get to that point. But the answer is we are moving there. And this is a very big step towards moving there.
00:20:46.874 - 00:21:04.494, Speaker B: There's other things like we need Ether scan to allow for when you like rather than you have Rbscan and optiscan. And for every single ecosystem, there's its own version of etherscan. We need optimizations and scaffolding like Etherscan to be able to work with networks of chains. And they can do that, but they need to do that.
00:21:04.532 - 00:21:05.690, Speaker A: Well, I don't need a bridge.
00:21:05.770 - 00:21:23.074, Speaker B: You do not need a bridge in these ZK world. You do not need a bridge. Same thing with the optimism super chain. But that even has even further challenges because they don't have this Ek element. But there is a part in this roll up that talks about the Zck world of the optimistic chains anyways. Okay. A closed private chain with connectivity to the ecosystem.
00:21:23.074 - 00:21:51.374, Speaker B: That just means, hey, deploy a ZK chain, you're connected to the ZK sync hyperchains, but it's still your chain with a native way, a way to issue a native token as that token space. So that is all of what I am excited about. This is my tweet. The ZK stack shall inherit the Internet. What do I mean by this? Okay, so this is why both Op stacks and ZK stacks just like, get me going. Because these systems, they're meant to be forked. They're like both optimism and ZkSync are saying, fork the absolute f out of us.
00:21:51.374 - 00:22:09.014, Speaker B: Deploy your chains. Deploy more chains, more chains everywhere. Just use the same standard. Because if you use the same standard, then the network effects around these standards grow. Optimism wants you to use their optimistics tech stack standard called the Op Stack. ZK sync wants you to use their ZK tech stack standard called the ZK stack. And that's what you get.
00:22:09.014 - 00:22:49.090, Speaker B: You got the ZK and the Op, the optimism. And so the idea is that they are just optimizing for what they are doing best, and then they're letting the rest of the Internet express their modules, their desires, for how they want their chain to be expressed. And so this allows these ZK chains, or Op Stack chains, to find corners of the Internet. Because they're so customizable, that chain deployers can make them fit into whatever corner of the Internet that they want to go. So the whole line of like Disney K stack shall inherit the Internet is saying that this is the scaffolding that's needed in order to propagate chains so that we can take the Internet and put it on Ethereum.
00:22:49.590 - 00:22:52.354, Speaker A: There's an entire episode on this. Yes. Is there not? Yes.
00:22:52.392 - 00:23:15.142, Speaker B: Oh, I did an episode on this with Alex Klikowski and Anthony Rose from ZkSync talking all about this. And so we talk a lot about the nature of ZK as a technology, just like the principles and the values that ZK tech as a technology embody. And then we go into the ZK stack, which is how those values get scaled out to this scale of the Internet.
00:23:15.206 - 00:23:41.522, Speaker A: One thing I would add to all of this is I know we're talking about some releases from ZkSync and also optimism next this week, polygon Arbjum. They have their own versions of this as well. I mean, all of these large layer two ecosystems are moving to a world where it's very easy to spin up your own chain. They all have slightly different approaches towards getting there and it's very, very exciting to see. So why don't you tell us about optimism? What are they doing this week?
00:23:41.576 - 00:24:21.562, Speaker B: The cool thing about what this is, Ryan, this week is that this actually is an optimism. This is O of One Labs, who I don't actually know the name of that, but I think they're associated with the MENA Protocol, hence this announcement. They say O of One Labs is excited to submit a proposal to optimism for the application of our zero knowledge proof stack to Op Stack fraud proofs. This application is built on the groundbreaking MIPS Zkvm Mobility Bling as part of the Mina Protocol roadmap. Why is this cool? We've created Kimchi, our Plonkish proving system. This is cryptography words to help bring ZKPs to the web Three and web two worlds. And so basically, the Op Stack is like a bunch of modules.
00:24:21.562 - 00:24:39.958, Speaker B: Every chain is a module for the optimism super chain. And Op Labs is submitting their version of fault proofs into the world of optimism. And so this is like a path forward for the Op Stack to gain a ZK module inside of the Op superchain world.
00:24:40.124 - 00:24:50.950, Speaker A: Does that make sense? It does. I think so. Does this mean, an op chain could potentially be a ZK EVM op chain.
00:24:51.030 - 00:25:29.590, Speaker B: So, yes, an op chain can accept a ZK module. And then part of the this is the cool thing, part of the superchain, all of the hyperchains that makes up the Optimism superchain, most are going to be optimistic roll ups, some can be ZK roll ups, and it can all be part of the optimistic super chain. Technically, this is a very hard thing to parse apart, and the Optimism team knows this and they all understand are taking on the challenges of, like, how do we make a composable super chain, like head on. Ben Jones from Optimism has this thing that he's working on to help define how does the super chain grow. But man, does it feel like the layer two summer, the layer two ecosystem is just on fire right now.
00:25:29.740 - 00:25:52.266, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really cool. It looks like Optimism as well, has renamed Optimism to op mainnet, which is sort of interesting. This main net area for all of these op chains, it's pretty cool. I guess. One takeaway from all of this is I feel like this time, the next bull market, we will have all of the block space we need. Oh, yeah, right.
00:25:52.368 - 00:25:56.510, Speaker B: We got so much block space. And if we need more, it's easy to get more now.
00:25:56.580 - 00:26:12.354, Speaker A: It's so easy to get more now. Making that composable, making that private, make the UX good. Still some issues, of course, but we got the block space, right? So low gas fee environments is going to be the case. Now I feel like we need the apps. This reminds me a little.
00:26:12.392 - 00:26:17.278, Speaker B: No one's building apps. Everyone is building chains. No one is building apps.
00:26:17.294 - 00:26:25.938, Speaker A: It's like feast or famine here. Last time during the bull run, we had all the apps. We didn't have any block space. Now we have all the block space and we don't have enough apps.
00:26:26.034 - 00:26:32.600, Speaker B: But someone please build an app, consume some block space.
00:26:33.230 - 00:26:57.074, Speaker A: Okay, zoom out. This is kind of what happened with the Internet, right? Yeah. Basically you had kind of the early Internet, and we're like, we need more bandwidth, bandwidth, bandwidth. Billions and hundreds of billions of dollars went into bandwidth investment, internet infrastructure investment. Then what happened.com? Bust all the money, kind of evaporated, and we're like, now we have all of this bandwidth, but we don't have the apps for the Internet. Right.
00:26:57.074 - 00:27:13.378, Speaker A: Guess what happened? The apps came because there was high bandwidth environment. We got things like YouTube, for instance, video streaming, like Netflix online. We got all of the high bandwidth apps after that. So I think the builders will catch up. They're taking notice. The apps will come, David, never fear.
00:27:13.474 - 00:27:30.966, Speaker B: It is worth just taking a step back and just reflecting, man, we do not know what's coming next. But hey, at least we have the bandwidth to support some really crazy ideas. Next bull market. Okay, disclosures. Both Ryan. And I are advisors to both optimism and ZkSync. I'm a big fan of Tech stacks.
00:27:30.966 - 00:27:44.986, Speaker B: I'm a big fan of biomimicry. There's a video if you want to learn more about just the nature of Tech stacks. The Op stack video on YouTube from Bankless. Just type in Op Stack. Bankless. It's the only video on YouTube that talks about the Op Stack.
00:27:45.098 - 00:27:47.826, Speaker A: Oh, really? Yeah. You got that, David? Yeah.
00:27:47.848 - 00:27:58.370, Speaker B: The 4000 people have watched it. Hey, but you can run the opportunity. Yeah. So advisors to both optimism and ZK sync. We also talked about Swell earlier. We also are angel investors into Swell as well.
00:27:58.520 - 00:28:00.626, Speaker A: Okay. We like the staking. We like the layer twos.
00:28:00.658 - 00:28:02.946, Speaker B: We like staking. We like layer twos. We like ethereum.
00:28:03.058 - 00:28:17.014, Speaker A: All right, david, I'm feeling bold. It's the bear market. What do I got to lose? Down bad already. Make a prediction. I think this is the year of the Bitcoin ETF. Spot bitcoin ETF approval. 2023 approval.
00:28:17.014 - 00:28:47.282, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. This is just me going out on a limb here. Okay. I have no knowledge of this, but just putting some things together, I feel like politically, Gensler has to approve a Bitcoin ETF. This is his kind of backpedaling moment to prove he is a generous God and he's not the unreasonable tyrant that the finance and crypto industry paints him as. So he'll give us this gift, the gift of Gensler, and he'll approve an ETF.
00:28:47.282 - 00:29:04.490, Speaker A: Also, some of his buddies have been submitting lately. I know you guys mentioned BlackRock, right? And now here we have Fidelity preparing to submit a Bitcoin ETF. Fidelity knows what's up, and they are doing the BlackRock play as well. What's the news here?
00:29:04.560 - 00:29:22.000, Speaker B: Fidelity is getting ready to submit their own Spot Bitcoin ETF. So Fidelity, I don't know how big it is, but it's large. Joining the queue to get a Bitcoin ETF. Yes, it's real big. This is also not Fidelity's first attempt. In 2021, they filed. It was denied by the SEC.
00:29:22.000 - 00:29:44.854, Speaker B: And so, right after BlackRock, Fidelity joins the queue. And then interestingly Arc. Which Arc? Invest Kathy Wood. They also have submitted a bitcoin ETF request. They haven't gotten theirs denied. Theirs is just sitting in Purgatory limbo. But here's what's interesting, and here's how they are getting to the front of the queue and why Arc might win this thing.
00:29:44.854 - 00:30:08.138, Speaker B: At least when this thing is like, they might get approved first because they had their Spot Bitcoin ETF files paperwork filed first and they've amended their file work. Their 19 B four, whatever that is, for a Spot Bitcoin ETF to include a surveillance sharing agreement with the SEC, which is the words that came from the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF.
00:30:08.234 - 00:30:11.374, Speaker A: Someone gave them a heads up that they need this verbiage, I think.
00:30:11.492 - 00:30:46.330, Speaker B: Well, maybe someone gave them a heads up. Maybe they're just saying, hey, BlackRock is going to get approved. And so let's make sure that if they get approved, we also get approved and copy and paste their filing and make it look like our filing. What is a surveillance sharing agreement? It involves the sharing of information about market trading activity, clearing activity, and customer identification to protect against the possibility of market manipulation. If this is the thing that forces Gary Gensler's hand to approve the BlackRock ETF or ETF, then therefore Ark will get theirs approved. But Ark is still filed, and so Ark will get approved first. And so that's the gambit that Ark is making.
00:30:46.330 - 00:31:04.142, Speaker B: Not just ark. Van Eck has also filed refiled for a spot bitcoin ETF last week, which also includes the intent to add the surveillance sharing agreement. So we have three large trad players submitting all of the same spot bitcoin ETF file paperwork.
00:31:04.206 - 00:31:04.530, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:04.600 - 00:31:09.026, Speaker B: And this assumption is like, gary Gensler is either corrupt or going to approve it.
00:31:09.128 - 00:31:22.440, Speaker A: Well, look, he's definitely correct. Vanek is pretty large, right? 80 billion. Of course. Kathy Wood ark invest is pretty large. Okay, you asked about fidelity earlier. Guess what they are. David large.
00:31:22.440 - 00:31:33.020, Speaker A: Oh, my God. They're large. 4.2 trillion. Trillion with a t. Okay. And BlackRock is double that size.
00:31:33.020 - 00:31:55.514, Speaker A: That's like, between them. They got all the assets. This is a tremendous amount of TradFi. Gary's buddies pressure that is raining down on him. And you know that Gary's posture has been like, oh, yeah, bitcoin. It's the only commodity there. He hasn't been willing to extend that to any other asset.
00:31:55.562 - 00:31:57.890, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, I forgot that he doesn't hate bitcoin.
00:31:58.630 - 00:32:24.774, Speaker A: There you go. That's what I'm just putting together, and that's why I'm making that prediction. But what does this do for our bags? That's a big question here. What does this do for the price? Does an ETF matter? Of course, I don't get super excited about it because it's not bankless. And yet it is a way to onboard retail increase the liquidity of bitcoin, the asset. So there are some good things about this. What are we looking at from Meltham?
00:32:24.822 - 00:33:00.290, Speaker B: And this is Meltam Demers, who I think is probably one of the most perfect people to really analyze some of this stuff. So the conversation is bitcoin ETFs all over the place. These are pipes. We need money to actually flow through these pipes. We can build the pipes, but we need money to flow through them in order to immaterially impact the price of bitcoin. So Meltam just puts on her analyst hat and asks, where is that money going to come from? So financial institutions are building products and services to access bitcoin. But where will the inflows come from? In my opinion, the biggest untapped market for bitcoin is taxed advantage retirement accounts.
00:33:00.290 - 00:33:20.294, Speaker B: The United States retirement market is $35 trillion and has doubled in the last decade. And so we have two circles here. We have the total us. Retirement AUM $35 trillion. And then we have the amount that's allocated to crypto, which is between 500 million and $1 billion. To say that these are two circles doesn't do it justice.
00:33:20.422 - 00:33:21.754, Speaker A: The other is a spec.
00:33:21.952 - 00:33:27.182, Speaker B: One is taking up half the page, and the other one is a period that is in the middle of the page.
00:33:27.236 - 00:33:29.082, Speaker A: It looks like the sun versus the Earth.
00:33:29.146 - 00:33:32.240, Speaker B: Yeah, if you've ever seen this real life size.
00:33:33.410 - 00:33:42.830, Speaker A: So a lot of room for growth here is what that means. And that could be a positive inflow into Bitcoin. Maybe that's why David Bitcoin Price has been pumpy a little bit this week.
00:33:42.980 - 00:34:03.174, Speaker B: It's pumpy because the traders are buying it, because they think this is going to happen. But this is going to take a while. At least that's my hope. Melton, this is a thread. So we are just reading the first tweet of this thread. If you want to read further analysis from Melton, there's a link in the show notes to go access this tweet. But coming up next, we're going to talk about MicroStrategy magically discovering hundreds of million dollars and then they turn it into bitcoin.
00:34:03.174 - 00:34:08.762, Speaker B: Of course, there's some Azuki drama, which I don't know if you care about, Ryan. I don't really care about it either.
00:34:08.816 - 00:34:09.222, Speaker A: Deeply.
00:34:09.286 - 00:34:30.322, Speaker B: Okay, well, we're talking about it. Binance Claps Back versus the SEC and then AirDrop season for Ethereum stakers. Man, these are some fun words. All of this and more. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible, especially MetaMask's brand new Spiffy Portfolio feature. We all love MetaMask, and now it can tell you everything about all of the things that you have in your MetaMask wallets. We're going to go hear from them right now.

00:36:04.792 - 00:36:08.210, Speaker A: David. What's? Zuzalu?
00:36:08.550 - 00:36:12.114, Speaker B: Zuzalu is a place, right? Zuzalu, yeah.
00:36:12.232 - 00:36:16.514, Speaker A: After weeks, it took me a while to get that.
00:36:16.552 - 00:36:24.070, Speaker B: There's actually that's up for debate. There's no consensus on how Zuzalu or zuzalu versus ETH. Yes, well, there's no debate on that one.
00:36:24.140 - 00:36:30.066, Speaker A: Okay. Anymore. There's a shelling point, though. What's the shelling point around Zuzalu?
00:36:30.098 - 00:36:41.718, Speaker B: Yeah. Or there's it's one of these two shelling points. Yeah. Okay. Do you remember when the background of my podcast was not my home in Brooklyn, and it was instead this kind of sterile looking apartment?
00:36:41.814 - 00:36:45.274, Speaker A: Boy, do I ever. Internet connections, lots of fun.
00:36:45.392 - 00:36:51.502, Speaker B: So I was in Montenegro for two months at this thing called Zuzalu, and if you scroll down, you'll start to get a little bit of a taste of this.
00:36:51.556 - 00:36:53.342, Speaker A: It's a blog post on Bankless, right?
00:36:53.396 - 00:37:08.398, Speaker B: Yes. So this is a blog post on bankless, if you want to know and learn about everything I was doing at Zuzalu and what Zuzalu is, this blog post is for you. I like this line that I wrote. Vitalik from ethereum, emad from stable diffusion, and Grimes from Grimes all walk on a stage together.
00:37:08.584 - 00:37:12.354, Speaker A: So Grimes the artist also has been previously associated with elon.
00:37:12.402 - 00:37:39.440, Speaker B: Yes, correct. They all walk on a stage together. And no, this is not a punchline. This was Zuzalu. So this was the AI crypto week at Zuzalu, of which there were eight weeks. There was longevity week, there was synthetic biology week, there was ZK cryptography week, there was public goods week, network states and coordinations. And so this was this social experiment of Zuzalu, like a two month long pop up temporary community where a bunch of frontier technologies came together.
00:37:39.890 - 00:37:40.814, Speaker A: Sounds like a cult.
00:37:40.852 - 00:37:59.878, Speaker B: David yeah, they called us a cult. They called us a cult. We didn't hate that. We thought it was funny. I recorded 18 interviews while I was there. So not only am I telling you about it in this article about what Zuzalu was, but I'm showing you with, like, ten plus hours of content and just my experience.
00:37:59.964 - 00:38:04.806, Speaker A: You on a stage. I love this energized when you're talking in person.
00:38:04.908 - 00:38:15.514, Speaker B: Well, okay. This was me presenting web3 to the Montenegro and government officials. And so I had a ten minute talk. They say, like ten minutes. And I was elected to do the web3. Why web3?
00:38:15.552 - 00:38:15.910, Speaker A: Pitch.
00:38:15.990 - 00:38:39.806, Speaker B: And right before my talk, I was like, okay, you no longer have ten minutes. You have three minutes. And I'm like, nice. And so I just started yelling, dude, in squats dance. In squats dance. Yeah. And so there was some murmuring about, what the hell are all these ethereum people and other industry people all doing at Zuzalu or this place from Montenegro? There was like this social contract of like, hey, we're going to all be heads down and focus on Zuzalu.
00:38:39.806 - 00:38:51.974, Speaker B: And then we'll broadcast about it. Now we're broadcasting about it. And so all of my content, all the talks are now out. You can read about Zuzalu in this blog post. It's at bankless.com. And yes, look, guys, look, let me.
00:38:52.012 - 00:39:17.294, Speaker A: Let me just tell you the gift that David has just given us. So if you can't go all the way to Montenegro or you weren't invited or whatever, it was too much. David is giving a sneak peek to, I think, some of the best people, best speakers, the best ideas, the best projects that came there. And there's like a series of videos. So in this post alone, david said you recorded 1818. This post alone, there's eight of them, okay?
00:39:17.332 - 00:39:27.634, Speaker B: The first one's with vitalik no, there's all 18. They're combined into the eight episodes. So there's eight themes, 18 episodes, consolidated it into eight episodes. Each one of these is like almost 2 hours long.
00:39:27.672 - 00:39:44.022, Speaker A: This is a gift. This is a gift. So go click the link in the show notes. If you want some extra bankless content, if you want some frontier tech content, this is the place to get it. I can't wait to dive into these. I'm going to start with the vitalik one, but what's your favorite after that?
00:39:44.076 - 00:40:04.174, Speaker B: Oh, God, there's a handful. So I have my favorites in each of them. Primavera de Filippi and her definition of cordy nations I thought was really good. Drew Endy, the father of modern biology in synthetic biology. He's in that one. I was walking with Drew. He's like this older gentleman, Stanford professor, and he was like, I've never really done a podcast, but I've always wanted to.
00:40:04.174 - 00:40:32.962, Speaker B: This one guy, Lex, emailed me about doing a podcast, but he wanted me to fly out to Austin. So I didn't respond. And I'm like, Bro, you didn't respond to Lex Friedman? Man, that's hilarious. Anyways, I got him on an So the idea here and this is the Zuzalu pitch, how were these technologies selected? All of these technologies are going to fundamentally change the future. They're going to change society. Like, longevity is going to happen. People are going to have the choice to live forever.
00:40:32.962 - 00:40:58.110, Speaker B: Synthetic biology, we're going to be able to grow our materials organically. That's going to change the world. All of these are technological tidal waves that are going to impact your life. Bankless Listener so all of this Zuzalu content is for you to front run the opportunity for you to be ready for that tidal wave that is inevitably coming. I feel like we're in the middle of the AI tidal wave. In the future, synthetic biology will hit us as a society.
00:40:58.850 - 00:41:03.550, Speaker A: One of these big ones hits like every five years. So get ready.
00:41:03.620 - 00:41:18.126, Speaker B: So this is just about understanding the technological tectonic shifts that are all being built. And so with all of these contents, you'll be prepared. You don't have to enjoy every single one. You can pick and choose your flavor. It's a choose your own adventure, but they are at your disposal.
00:41:18.318 - 00:41:20.002, Speaker A: David. Is it AirDrop season?
00:41:20.066 - 00:41:20.818, Speaker B: It is AirDrop season.
00:41:20.834 - 00:41:40.634, Speaker A: We tease that a little bit. Diva dow we're proud to present the diva dow dldr. The Diva Dow is being formed with an initial distribution to 15,000 unique Ethereum Stakers and Ecosystem participants. This is an ETH staking protocol. Pretty high in the decentralization spectrum. What's going on here?
00:41:40.672 - 00:42:11.154, Speaker B: Yeah, very strong commitments to Ethereum values. Ethereum, the Ethereum protocol, they want it to be built as a public good. They want it to be built as immutable as possible. One of the things that excites me about Diva is their commitment towards the DVT Ecosystem. Decentralized, validator technology, aka squad Staking. And they've been working with people like the Ethereum Staker Group and others as well. The AirDrop has gone to, of course, diva OG contributors ethereum stakers from ETH staker, rocket pool SSV Lido and DAP Node.
00:42:11.154 - 00:42:35.806, Speaker B: Community members from Gnosis, Uniswap, ENS, Ave, Maker, Aragon and other Dows. And then the ethereum staking dev and ecosystem contributors. 15,000 addresses are eligible. You can trek your address at Earnify. Earni fi can go and plug in your address because we've got this merkel tree built into Earnify, so it'll tell you. And if you are already a member, subscriber to Earnify. You already have your Ethereum address there.
00:42:35.806 - 00:42:55.714, Speaker B: You probably already got an email address saying, hey, you have the new Diva AirDrop. And so that is in your inbox if you are a Earnify subscriber. If you are not, you should 100% sign up. There is a link in the show notes. I listened to the Diva Twitter space with Superfiz this morning. Pretty impressed. Everyone seems to really like what they're doing.
00:42:55.912 - 00:43:18.566, Speaker A: Yeah, superfizz is a notable ETH staker. He says, I'm offering my service as a Diva Staking delegate. I am encouraged to see Diva soliciting input from the community. I want to contribute my efforts to build another strong Staking option. I mean, the whole idea is trying to decentralize Staking a little bit more. So I guess Superfizz is signing up to be a Diva. We always knew he was a Diva.
00:43:18.598 - 00:43:21.386, Speaker B: Did you mean to say mean?
00:43:21.408 - 00:43:27.274, Speaker A: Isn't that's gotta be the meme they're going with, right? What a wasted opportunity. If not, call them the Divas.
00:43:27.322 - 00:43:28.666, Speaker B: You want to be a Diva?
00:43:28.858 - 00:43:33.946, Speaker A: There you go. Disclosure, too. David and I are angel investors and Diva, we think it's a pretty cool.
00:43:34.068 - 00:43:35.746, Speaker B: I guess we're divas as well.
00:43:35.928 - 00:43:39.250, Speaker A: NFT stuff. Azuki david.
00:43:40.950 - 00:43:44.894, Speaker B: Oh wait, you weren't on the edge of your seat following this Azuki drama.
00:43:44.942 - 00:43:50.814, Speaker A: No, I wasn't, but I want you to tell me all about it. So what cool things are happening in the NFT space?
00:43:50.952 - 00:43:54.978, Speaker B: What cool things are happening? I hate that I had to spend 30 minutes of my morning getting caught.
00:43:54.994 - 00:44:05.498, Speaker A: Up about but you did though. You took that for us. Okay, so I saw some drama from Azuki. There's some sort of drop or some sort of mint that got some bad press. What happened?
00:44:05.584 - 00:44:15.770, Speaker B: Okay, so Azukis, you know what Azuki's like? They're the anime PFP. Pretty high floor price. It was like 13, 1415 e before this drop.
00:44:15.930 - 00:44:17.390, Speaker A: Definitely a top ten project.
00:44:17.540 - 00:44:38.174, Speaker B: Top five, I think. Yeah. Very strong. Very strong. So they have been teasing this Azuki elementals drop mint. And so the elementals was a brand new project. Sometimes NFT PFP projects, they do further mints because my cynical take is like, we need another idea, let's do another mint.
00:44:38.174 - 00:45:08.874, Speaker B: I don't know. So they do it. So they had the Genesis collection, which are the Azukis and then beans, which are one of these like pets things for Azukis. They're doing Azuki elementals. And so 20,000 NFTs 10,000 of them were airdropped to Azuki holders during already. So 20,000 new NFTs 10,000 Azuki, the Genesis ones, 10,000 of the new 20,000 elementals were airdropped to Azuki holders. The remaining 10,000 elementors were sold out at two e share to anyone that owned a Azuki or a bean.
00:45:08.874 - 00:45:17.314, Speaker B: So being on the whitelist means you had to already be in the Azuki community. So $38 million was raised by the Azukis. Wow. From their community. From their community.
00:45:17.352 - 00:45:17.746, Speaker A: Wow.
00:45:17.848 - 00:45:18.402, Speaker B: Yes.
00:45:18.536 - 00:45:19.266, Speaker A: That's a big number.
00:45:19.288 - 00:45:21.298, Speaker B: It's a very big number. It's a very big number.
00:45:21.384 - 00:45:22.850, Speaker A: So they must be valuable.
00:45:23.750 - 00:45:35.638, Speaker B: So they were sold for two ETH and then they were revealed. And so the metadata you didn't know what they were? Didn't know what they were. Yes, they were teased. There was like promo graphics, so people kind of knew what they were, but they didn't.
00:45:35.724 - 00:45:38.566, Speaker A: Yeah, underwraps. Yes, it's kind of the graphic. Okay.
00:45:38.588 - 00:45:48.490, Speaker B: And so they were released. And so on the left we have these are Azukis. These are the Genesis collections. These are the very highly priced ones. And then if you swap to the right, these are the elementals.
00:45:49.230 - 00:45:49.980, Speaker A: Okay.
00:45:50.510 - 00:45:58.670, Speaker B: Left here's the azukis. Here are the elementals. Go back to the Azukis and back to the elementals.
00:45:59.010 - 00:46:01.274, Speaker A: This is Pam from the office. They're the same picture.
00:46:01.322 - 00:46:03.610, Speaker B: They're the same picture. They're the same.
00:46:03.700 - 00:46:04.338, Speaker A: Very similar.
00:46:04.424 - 00:46:25.240, Speaker B: They are the almost identical. There's not much I mean, there's not even stylistic changes. It's just like marginally different properties. Okay, go to the next one. Here's the meme that sums this up a bunch. Here's one of the CAPTCHAs to select all the images that are elemental. And it's just like you just don't know.
00:46:25.610 - 00:46:42.734, Speaker A: You don't know, I guess there's a social contract that if you're releasing another 20,000, which is what they were releasing, right, PFPs that there would be an entirely kind of different collection rather than a clone of all of the attributes and everything else that you've previously done.
00:46:42.852 - 00:47:12.886, Speaker B: Is that what it's not a perfect clone? Like there are differences, but you can't without deeply knowing, unless you're an Azuki expert, they just look the fucking same. Okay. And so as a result of this, the Azuki elementals minted at two are now trading below the two ETH mint. The actual Azuki genesis went from 15 ETH or 14th floor down to like twelve. And so market cap was lost. The community not happy.
00:47:12.988 - 00:47:30.874, Speaker A: They're not happy. Okay. This is Jeff Morris. I don't know who Jeff is, but he says if any ecommerce site sold 38 million of merchandise in a presale, this would be headline news. Let's not forget that these are digital products with incredible margins for creators. But NFTs are dead is the popular narrative. I guess that's the bull case.
00:47:30.874 - 00:47:34.374, Speaker A: That is the bullcase million in NFTs.
00:47:34.422 - 00:47:41.518, Speaker B: Is this what we as an industry are going to beat our chest about? It's like we made $38 million of selling clones of I don't know.
00:47:41.604 - 00:47:43.610, Speaker A: Can't adults buy what they want, David?
00:47:43.690 - 00:48:03.686, Speaker B: Yes, they can. Yes, they can. But they didn't know what they were. They were taking it on faith that the Azuki team were going to do something that wasn't dilutive of the genesis. I don't know. Anyways, we are not experts. If you want to listen to I'm sure Carly Riley has a much more informed take.
00:48:03.686 - 00:48:05.298, Speaker B: So listen to Overpriced JPEGs.
00:48:05.394 - 00:48:08.822, Speaker A: There you go. But we are bitcoin experts.
00:48:08.966 - 00:48:09.818, Speaker B: Just say that.
00:48:09.904 - 00:48:10.362, Speaker A: All right.
00:48:10.416 - 00:48:11.260, Speaker B: Are we?
00:48:11.870 - 00:48:30.394, Speaker A: I know that this week MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 12,333 bitcoin for a grand total of $347,000,000 at an average price of bitcoin. Is Sailor trying to own all the bitcoin?
00:48:30.442 - 00:48:35.086, Speaker B: Where does he get this money from? Is MicroStrategy. That profitable.
00:48:35.278 - 00:48:55.686, Speaker A: I mean, it's just kind of like it used to be business intelligence technology, like software as a service. Used to be one of the leaders, but is not quite like market leader these days. I don't know. It's now become a bitcoin hedge fund, I guess. Or just a bitcoin hold fund, I should say.
00:48:55.788 - 00:49:06.300, Speaker B: Okay, we don't have this in the agenda. So this is bitcointresurries net. I'm just reading out some stats. Michael saylor MicroStrategy is in the green.
00:49:06.670 - 00:49:07.178, Speaker A: What?
00:49:07.264 - 00:49:19.146, Speaker B: They are up 1.3 x. They are up 3% on their bitcoin purchases. Their cost basis is 4.5 billion. Their current value is 4.66 billion.
00:49:19.258 - 00:49:35.666, Speaker A: Do you know what's funny is for everyone making fun of him? I've never been one of like I think it's funny. I think it's funny that he's just using a publicly traded company to dollar cost average in and buy this thing. I just think that's funny that he buys so consistently. But I've always thought that this would pay off for him. Can I show you why?
00:49:35.688 - 00:49:36.914, Speaker B: David it's going to work.
00:49:37.032 - 00:49:40.310, Speaker A: I'm going to show you why. Yeah, this is why.
00:49:40.380 - 00:49:44.870, Speaker B: This is why. Going back to the markets. Two greens and a red. Three greens and a red.
00:49:44.940 - 00:49:56.794, Speaker A: Taylor has greens and a red. Looking at this table, and he's like, okay, if I don't time things and I just dollar cost average in where's it going to leave me? And I think the answer is he's going to make money on it.
00:49:56.832 - 00:50:08.170, Speaker B: I know you just said if I don't time things, but, man, did he time that poorly. He started in the last green before the red, which is not where you want to start buying.
00:50:08.330 - 00:50:22.034, Speaker A: That's why you have to buy more. That's the only solution to getting out of if you have a high cost basis, you just keep buying until you lower that. Anyway, that's that for bitcoin. What do we got here?
00:50:22.072 - 00:50:26.802, Speaker B: David this is the MSTR price. Okay. So this is just to round up this conversation, MicroStrategy stock price.
00:50:26.856 - 00:50:27.266, Speaker A: Yes.
00:50:27.368 - 00:50:40.620, Speaker B: So before all of the bitcoin exposure, before Michael Taylor engaged in bitcoin shenanigans with MicroStrategy, MicroStrategy the asset, the equity was trading at $130. Today it is at Drumroll, $330.
00:50:41.390 - 00:50:42.842, Speaker A: Oh, okay.
00:50:42.896 - 00:51:00.026, Speaker B: So it's like almost three X. And not only that, but it hit over $1,000 during the bull market. So even shareholders, shareholders who are like, microsaylor, what the hell are you doing to this company? They can't be complaining. MicroStrategy, the equity has almost tripled. No wonder he's getting all this money to buy bitcoin.
00:51:00.138 - 00:51:12.574, Speaker A: It can't be the same shareholders. It's a totally different investment profile. You're like, I'm buying a business intelligence software company versus like, yeah, now I'm buying bitcoin basically under a publicly traded symbol.
00:51:12.622 - 00:51:12.930, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:13.000 - 00:51:35.894, Speaker A: Anyway, kind of fun. David, we said earlier there's pressure for Gensler to approve an ETF. I think this is some of the reason why Christian Carlo was the former chair of the CFTC. He says this greetings from Tokyo, where the headline in Japan Times says exactly what I'm hearing. Here's the headline crypto Tumult in US may be boon for Japan. US's. Loss is Japan's gain.
00:51:35.894 - 00:51:59.454, Speaker A: Japan is moving pretty aggressively in a positive way towards regulating. We saw I believe Brian Armstrong tweeted this out. Last time we talked to Brian Armstrong, actually, he was in Japan. Right. So things are happening in Japan. It's not just Japan. HSBC Hong Kong now lets customers trade bitcoin and ether ETFs.
00:51:59.454 - 00:52:02.542, Speaker A: What it's possible to ether's already got an ETF.
00:52:02.606 - 00:52:03.122, Speaker B: Nice.
00:52:03.256 - 00:52:19.654, Speaker A: In Hong Kong. We can't have that product in the US. It's too dangerous for retail. The UK this just came out before we hit record. Crypto stablecoin rules receive royal assent passing into law. Okay. The Financial Services Markets Act of the 2023.
00:52:19.654 - 00:52:53.060, Speaker A: This is in the UK classifies crypto as a regulated financial activity. And King Charles just gave his approval on that. I guess that's what happens, you get the final blessing from the king. So the king said yes. And what's the US doing in the backdrop of this? Right? These other countries, these other, like other nations, other geographies are competing against the United States for crypto. And so they're rolling out sensible regulatory frameworks and they're trying to win that business over. What's your take here?
00:52:53.510 - 00:53:03.122, Speaker B: The US is just fumbling. What is the US doing? We're fumbling. I mean, hey, US has been in the lead for a long time. I guess it's innovators dilemma.
00:53:03.186 - 00:53:04.758, Speaker A: This is always what happens, isn't it?
00:53:04.844 - 00:53:15.578, Speaker B: Well, I think it's really nice of us to really just see first place to the rest of the world. It's so stupid, so generous of us to help.
00:53:15.664 - 00:53:34.206, Speaker A: I think this is another example of like I just feel like the people who are governing the United States right now are just not making long term not this is not good for the US, but good for these other jurisdictions. Meanwhile, Binance is doing some things to push back against the SEC.
00:53:34.308 - 00:54:42.102, Speaker B: What is this David Binance claps backs? This is a meta lawman who goes and says binance has gone on the offensive against the SEC in the federal court case, accusing the SEC of violating court rules by making statements outside of the court that are false, designed to harm Binance US customers and to taint the jury. Yeah. So after entry of an order agreed to by the parties, binance argues that the SEC issued a misleading press release claiming that Binance had secured emergency relief, that CZ had commingled and diverted customer assets, and three, that the order was essential to protecting investor assets. And when questioned by the judge repeatedly, SEC attorneys were unable to point to any evidence that CZ had diverted or commingled customer assets. So Binance is accusing the SEC of saying public statements that are untrue and are tainting the image and branding of Binance that would go against them in court, especially in front of a jury. And so far, apparently, allegedly, according to Metalaman and others, that Binance's side of this is looking pretty good.
00:54:42.156 - 00:54:54.874, Speaker A: It's a pretty strong uh huh. Well, that contributes to some of the pressure I think Gensler is feeling right now. And maybe part of the reason, well, think about this.
00:54:54.912 - 00:55:21.166, Speaker B: Just like the branding of accusations of unethical conduct coming from these lawyers. The idea is that will reverberate in the halls of the SEC and the image of the SEC, like, SEC gets in trouble in the United States Court for unethical conduct. And then all the crypto people are like, hey, Gary Gensler's being unethical and bad and mean to us, all of a sudden, it totally legitimizes. The entire crypto industry's takes about Gary Gensler.
00:55:21.198 - 00:55:36.454, Speaker A: Well, this is pretty big. Like a regulator cannot lose its credible neutrality or else it loses its legitimacy. Right. And so I listened to that. I got caught up on the podcast. That you recorded while I was out with, who was it? David Austin. So good.
00:55:36.454 - 00:56:27.942, Speaker A: Fantastic. And he basically said, hey, regulators are kind of serious people. They know they have a reputation, at least most of them, and they can't be seen to pick winners and losers. So if the SEC approves BlackRock's ETF submission because Gensler goes fishing with Larry Fink or something like that, right? And that comes out and they say no to Van ACK and they say no to the others for just reasons that don't make sense, that is incredibly serious, according to Austin and your episode with him and is not a light matter. And this is kind of what Binance is alleging, that, well, I guess Gary is picking losers and it's the entire crypto industry and targeting Binance is the allegation here. So we'll see what the judge says, we'll see what the jury says in this case.
00:56:27.996 - 00:57:04.530, Speaker B: Up next, creditors are seeking BlockFi liquidation and accusing the CEO, Zach Prince of fraud and extortion. Damn, those are some big words. Okay, so creditors of BlockFi have filed to liquidate the company's estate, accusing Zach Prince of fraud, dishonesty, incompetence or gross mismanagement and delaying bankruptcy proceedings. So the creditor said that it's time to end the extortion tactics and adding that it is time for debtors unsecured creditors to finally know what Blockfly truly was, who Zach Prince truly is, how much he personally profited from the company, and what he and certain of his colleagues were doing when no one was watching.
00:57:04.600 - 00:57:05.406, Speaker A: Oof.
00:57:05.598 - 00:57:53.474, Speaker B: And then the context here is that with no revenue coming into the company, and with the company having compounding losses, creditors argue that the case should proceed as a liquidation, criticizing BlockFi's administrative costs, including the salaries for over 100 individuals who, quote, have nothing to do, have nothing better to do but work on their golf game. Oof arguing that debtors are intentionally burning an average of more than $16 million per month merely to augment defensive positions for historical management, basically saying, okay, the creditors who are owed BlockFi's money, saying, hey, BlockFi is burning all. This capital to just argue for their retroactive decisions. And it's not doing anything for the benefit of people who are owed money. So let's liquidate the damn thing is.
00:57:53.512 - 00:58:05.830, Speaker A: The TLDR that is dirty. Two years ago at this time, BlockFi was one of Know darlings. Wow, I'm glad they are seeing their day in court.
00:58:06.250 - 00:58:20.698, Speaker B: I'm going to kick someone while it's down. So I'm sorry about that, but this is laser eyed Bitcoiner's version of DeFi that they just beaded their drum like, we don't need DeFi, we have BlockFi. And then literally the worst example of what a centralized authority can do is what it was.
00:58:20.864 - 00:58:29.390, Speaker A: Yeah, would have been safer to keep it in smart contracts, I would say. David, we got some big things we're releasing on Bankless this week. What are we looking at here?
00:58:29.460 - 00:59:08.026, Speaker B: We now have a team at Bankless whose job it is to go out and find as many cool perks for bankless citizens as possible. So we have this leaderboard, this tally board of how much value can we can provide to bankless citizens? We are now up to $1,297 of value for a Bankless citizen membership. So you get a 25% discount to Nascent for a month, one month of free usage of Quicknode, twelve months of free access to Zengo MPC wallet, 15% discount for crypto tax calculator, 30% off of permissionless tickets, and more and more and more. And there's only going to be more. This is our job. We're going to make that number, which is, again, currently hold us to this one, $297. The value number go up.
00:59:08.026 - 00:59:20.286, Speaker B: I want $10,000, baby. One day. One day. So this is all the value that you get as a bankless citizen. And then our people in the discord saying, hey, we want this. And then we go send our hunters out to go get some of that.
00:59:20.388 - 00:59:31.954, Speaker A: Look, almost $1,300. And it's 1750 a month, right? That's what we call ROI right there. That's what the perks page is set up to do. David, there's more going on in the Bankless community.
00:59:32.072 - 00:59:32.562, Speaker B: We got more.
00:59:32.616 - 00:59:33.634, Speaker A: What is this?
00:59:33.832 - 00:59:46.710, Speaker B: Bonjoyo. Bonjour. I do not know French. So, Tuesday, July 18, if you are a bankless citizen, we are having our ETH CC meetup. This is meetup number two. Number one was at East Denver. It was a raging success.
00:59:46.710 - 01:00:04.786, Speaker B: We had free beers because it was Denver. And we love beer in Denver. In France. We love cocktails. So it is at a cozy little cocktail bar. So, citizens only for a nice event with all of the bankless HQ member team members who are going to be there tuesday, July 18. So if you are a bankless citizen, let us know and we will get you invited.
01:00:04.838 - 01:00:17.380, Speaker A: Okay, so, funny story about this picture we're looking at. My wife actually texted me last night while I was on the train from New York. Come back home and she's like, what is this picture of you? You look like Hitler. I was like, what?
01:00:18.710 - 01:00:21.026, Speaker B: This is not what Hitler looks like.
01:00:21.128 - 01:00:27.622, Speaker A: That's what I told her. Hitler doesn't have and the mustache is not at all right.
01:00:27.676 - 01:00:29.350, Speaker B: That's not a Hitler stash at all.
01:00:29.420 - 01:00:31.266, Speaker A: Yeah, deeply offended.
01:00:31.298 - 01:00:34.840, Speaker B: But this is a massive rug, though, because you will not be there.
01:00:36.410 - 01:00:38.054, Speaker A: All right, David, what's coming up next?
01:00:38.172 - 01:01:05.582, Speaker B: Coming up next, we got some questions from the nation. Followed up by the takes of the week, followed up with David and Ryan are bullish on. And of course, the meme of the week, this one, the meme of the Week has me and Ryan in it. So we're going to talk about all of this and more. But first, a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible. Arbitrum One is pioneering the world of secure, ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the Web Three landscape. Hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum One, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems.
01:01:05.582 - 01:01:58.734, Speaker B: With a recent addition of Arbitrum nova gaming and social DApps like Reddit are also now calling Arbitrum home. Both Arbitrum One and Nova leverage the security and decentralization of Ethereum and provide a builder experience that's intuitive, familiar and fully EVM compatible. On Arbitrum, both builders and users will experience faster transaction speeds with significantly lower gas fees. With Arbitrum's recent migration to Arbitrum Nitro, it's also now ten times faster than before. Visit Arbitrum IO, where you can join the community, dive into the developer docs, bridge your assets, and start building your first DAP with Arbitrum experience Web Three development the way it was meant to be secure, fast, cheap and friction free. If you haven't experienced the superpowers that a smart contract wallet gives you, check out Ambire. Ambire works with all the EVM chains that are out there the layer twos, like Arbitrum Optimism and Polygon, but also the nonessetherium chains like Avalanche and Phantom.
01:01:58.734 - 01:02:39.914, Speaker B: Because of the power of smart contract wallets, ambire lets you pay for gas and stablecoins, meaning you'll never have to spend your precious ETH again. The Web app has numerous fiat onramps to make it easy to dump your Fiat for crypto, and if you like self custody but you still want training wheels, you can recover a lost Ambire wallet using an email and password, but without giving the Ambire team any control over your funds. Check it out@ambire.com for the Web app experience. But also the Ambire mobile wallet is coming soon for both iOS and Android, and if you want to be a beta tester, you could sign up@ambire.com slash app. And since you stayed to the very end of this ad read, you should know that Ambire is airdropping its wallet token to early users for simply just using the wallet.
01:02:39.914 - 01:02:44.258, Speaker B: So if you want to get started with Ambire, all the links that you need are in the show Notes question.
01:02:44.344 - 01:03:16.518, Speaker A: This week from Nick, aka Sheeproy Jenkins what happens to ETH and ETH L2 price if we head towards a future where anyone can make a blockchain quickly and cheaply for themselves or their companies? Interesting question. So we have all of this excess block space. We were just talking about that earlier in the episode. What happens to ETH Price? What happens to L2 price when we have all of this additional block space? It becomes incredibly cheap? What do you think, David?
01:03:16.614 - 01:03:40.740, Speaker B: Do you think in the phrasing of this question, that the implication is that why are these things ether and ether? Layer Two tokens? Why are these things valuable at all when anyone can make a blockchain quickly and cheaply? Is that the tone of the question? What happens when these things are such a commodity that it's just free and cheap and easy to build a blockchain? That's kind of the nature of the question.
01:03:41.270 - 01:04:11.738, Speaker A: Yes. And I think that the wider context of this type of a question is, hey, we're going through a massive paradigm shift of the transaction volume and the traffic is going to be on layer twos moving forward and we're going to have a lot of layer twos and it's going to be abundant. So what happens to the price of ETH or even the price of layer two tokens when no one is actually transacting on ether? They're transacting other places. So I do think that's part of the context. Yeah.
01:04:11.904 - 01:04:45.074, Speaker B: Okay, so I understand the intuition of just like, hey, we're going to get 10,000 chains, gas is going to be free, there's going to be so much block space that we're not going to be able to fill it all. What happens to ether and layer two prices when fees basically drop to zero? Layer one fees won't drop to zero. There will always be a basal level of demand to transact on the ethereum layer one. In fact, I kind of think that layer one fees are not going down. The lowest that we see them is like 20 GWe on average. Like 20 to 50 GWe, I think is like the lowest. It's going to be induced.
01:04:45.074 - 01:05:32.674, Speaker B: Demand will manifest on the layer two s. But man, at some point in time we can talk about the economics of chains all we want. And how about does that capture value? How much value does that capture if it captures too much value, won't we just spin up new chains at some point? It's just memetic. If there's 10,000 Op stack chains or 10,000 ZK stack chains, those tokens are going to be valuable just by nature of just the standard being adopted. We always try and like, here's a formula for understanding ether, sure, but it's just so mimetic and temporal and people don't understand these things. They just buy. And so my intuition is just like more chains means number go up, more chains means more economic activity on ether.
01:05:32.674 - 01:06:15.218, Speaker B: People are going to associate economic activity on ether with ether price, on ethereum, with ether price. And so I think when the idea of what happens when anyone can make a blockchain quickly and cheaply for themselves and their companies if it's easy, if it's a commodity to build and add your chain to the 10,000 chains that are going on ethereum in the next five years. The shelling point becomes ether or the layer two tech stack standard that that is built upon. And so just think about the shelling point and think about the adoption of the technology. If the shelling point grows and it's like this one particular standard is the new way we deploy chains, whatever token that is associated with that is going to go up, not become commoditized. That's my answer.
01:06:15.304 - 01:07:01.202, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a good answer, David. I guess I would add a few things. The mental model of what you're investing in, I think, is you're investing in an emerging, growing economy, sort of what you're investing in. I think that Ether, in a world where there are many layer two chains, ether cements itself even further as a money store value unit of account, a medium of exchange for all of the layer twos. So Ether, it appears to me, is in pretty good shape. One other thing I would add to this is the question was what happens to Ethernet ETH price when we head towards future and anyone can make a blockchain quickly? Actually, I would say we've been in that future for a long time. Anybody can make a blockchain quickly.
01:07:01.202 - 01:08:01.058, Speaker A: It's just a side chain, you know what I mean? It's very easy to spin up a Cosmos chain right now. It couldn't be more simple. That doesn't mean that the side chain is more valuable. So we're entering a world where now anybody can make a blockchain that is secured by Ethereum, that is going to be net additive and net good to the Ethereum ecosystem and to Ether the asset even more than obviously much more than sidechains ever were. So you've got that working in your favor. I also think that we're probably going to move to a world where a lot of these assets, ETH included, but particularly layer two assets, are valued based on the price people are willing to pay for transaction ordering an Mev. And so that will probably be kind of the non monetary value basal unit of utility in addition to kind of the gas demand and the demand to get your transaction into the block.
01:08:01.058 - 01:08:45.362, Speaker A: Remember, Mev is going to be a huge driver of value here. So all in all, feels pretty good. I guess the last thing I'd say is I think you're right, David, when you say the more users you get, the more attention that comes to your ecosystem and on your asset. So if I'm using the polygon ecosystem, I'm going to be warming up to Matic, right? And so the next time I see Matic, oh, it's polygon, I use Polygon, right. I'm probably be more likely to hit that buy button on Matic. And so that also has not necessarily a fundamental kind of doesn't affect the asset price, the asset fundamentals, but it does increase the asset value. More users is good and it's hard to deny that.
01:08:45.362 - 01:08:48.998, Speaker A: So I guess the answer is number goes up.
01:08:49.164 - 01:08:50.520, Speaker B: Number goes up.
01:08:51.370 - 01:08:56.342, Speaker A: So there you go, Nick. David, we got some takes of the week. First one from Tyler. What's this look like?
01:08:56.396 - 01:09:27.586, Speaker B: Oh, man, this one resonated with me. Tyler Reynolds says, truth does not mind being questioned. A lie does not like being challenged. Boy, do I wish I had read this tweet in like 20 why truth does not mind being questioned. Remember when we had the Terra Luna? Is Terra Luna a ticking time bomb? Thumbnail and episode title and then every single Terra Luna tick came in and was like, you guys are just a bunch of dumb mean our in the YouTube comments. I do remember this. It's like, man, I wish I had this as like a mental model to lean back on.
01:09:27.586 - 01:09:36.322, Speaker B: It's like, hey, if I'm just perhaps voicing a critique and I'm getting a torrent of toxicity my way, it's because.
01:09:36.376 - 01:09:38.162, Speaker A: Truth a very bad sign.
01:09:38.216 - 01:09:51.018, Speaker B: It's a very bad sign. It's coming from a place of insecurity. And so I think this is something, hey, if you are giving out legitimate takes and you're getting toxicity in return, maybe you should look at why those reasons are toxic in the first place.
01:09:51.184 - 01:09:52.698, Speaker A: David, I've got a take for you.
01:09:52.784 - 01:09:53.820, Speaker B: Yeah, you do?
01:09:55.150 - 01:10:34.562, Speaker A: I think I'm ready to right? So ETH price about this time last year was just like dipping into three digit territory. I think it dipped like twice, right? One for a period of days or something. And then there was another brief leg down around this time. Ever since then, I have been thinking we would get back to triple digit. And there's a period of time where it was like training 1101, two hundreds. I was like, okay, well, you know what? It's going to kick in. The Apathy market is going to kick in, right? And people are going to be like, Why? I'm getting restless.
01:10:34.562 - 01:10:57.962, Speaker A: I'm going to sell my ether. And we'll see a dip down to triple digit ETH. And then you know what we saw? So we saw FTX absolutely explode. And ETH did not dip down. Didn't even break that event into triple digit ETH territory. And I remember telling you, David, you're like, you buying big here. I was like, yeah, I'm still waiting for triple digit ETH.
01:10:57.962 - 01:11:07.746, Speaker A: All right, I'm ready to capitulate on that. I don't think we'll see triple digit ETH again. I don't think it'll happen.
01:11:07.928 - 01:11:09.458, Speaker B: Bear market's over.
01:11:09.624 - 01:11:23.462, Speaker A: All right? Maybe I'm just tempting the crypto gods, because if it does hit triple digit, I'm backing that truck up. But FDX couldn't do it. The bank crisis that we saw in the first quarter of this year couldn't do it.
01:11:23.516 - 01:11:25.830, Speaker B: Not only could it not do mean, it was bullish.
01:11:26.250 - 01:11:40.140, Speaker A: Apathy market can't do it. So at this point, I feel ready to capitulate. And you might have won that one. David, is that you? This is David Hoffman replying to my Tweet. Man, that's a lot of words just to say. David was right.
01:11:41.010 - 01:11:46.638, Speaker B: I'm so mean to you. It's great.
01:11:46.724 - 01:11:51.694, Speaker A: Now you're nice to me. This week my flight was canceled and had a place to co work.
01:11:51.732 - 01:11:53.246, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true. That was fun.
01:11:53.348 - 01:11:54.320, Speaker A: What do we got?
01:11:55.890 - 01:12:31.482, Speaker B: That speaking of which, speaking of which, we took this screenshot because we were about to record a podcast with Raul Paul. And so I was like, this is hilarious. Let me take a screen capture of this and I'll post it. And even people in our company was like, that's a doctorate photograph ryan's Fake in that photo. He's not actually in David's apartment. And then this is Michael Wong's meme. This is just a deep, nostalgic millennial meme of Jimmy Neutron and Timmy Turner from Nickelo Cartoon Network.
01:12:31.482 - 01:12:43.514, Speaker B: Oh, I'm failing as a millennial. Anyways, it's a crossover episode where Timmy Turner and Jimmy Neutron are illustrated like each other. God, I'm butchering this. Anyways, I thought it was funny.
01:12:43.562 - 01:12:46.714, Speaker A: Yeah, it was great to appear in the flesh. We got three episodes.
01:12:46.842 - 01:12:48.562, Speaker B: Never what I thought possible.
01:12:48.696 - 01:12:50.660, Speaker A: Yeah. In person. In person.
01:12:51.590 - 01:12:54.930, Speaker B: One thing I learned is actually you don't drink as much coffee as I thought that you did.
01:12:55.080 - 01:13:13.482, Speaker A: Oh, did I disappoint you? Yeah, I do when I like so I make at least a pot at home, and I make a second pot in the afternoon. I'm guzling all morning, but I didn't want it because I had coffee in the mornings I was bringing to your place. I could get that. I didn't want to make you do coffee all day. You make it by the cup, don't you?
01:13:13.536 - 01:13:16.090, Speaker B: Yeah, I have a little espresso machine, let me tell you.
01:13:16.160 - 01:13:19.066, Speaker A: People who have espresso machine fetch my coffee all day.
01:13:19.168 - 01:13:23.820, Speaker B: People who have espresso machines love making espresso. I will tell you.
01:13:24.590 - 01:13:25.830, Speaker A: Like to make me more coffee.
01:13:25.910 - 01:13:38.754, Speaker B: Yeah. Because you want, like, oh, this one's kind of acidic. It's like, oh, I need that feedback so I can improve my coffee making style. I'm not going to come over to your it is a privilege to be made coffee by David Hoffman, let me tell you.
01:13:38.792 - 01:13:46.178, Speaker A: Well, that's true. I enjoy that privilege. It's fantastic coffee. I'm back to my old, know, just drip pot coffee, pour over in a.
01:13:46.184 - 01:13:47.806, Speaker B: Paper filter inside of a chemex.
01:13:47.918 - 01:13:59.414, Speaker A: No, dude, I don't even do that. I'm just, like, push the button, drip coffee. I grind my beans. At least I do that. But then I just push the button. Yeah, it's drip. That's how primitive I am.
01:13:59.452 - 01:14:00.886, Speaker B: So it's pretty primitive, bro.
01:14:00.988 - 01:14:01.446, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:14:01.548 - 01:14:07.980, Speaker B: So when I'm going to the mountains, this is my last weekly roll up for two weeks, by the way. So you and Anthony are coming up. Okay.
01:14:08.990 - 01:14:13.386, Speaker A: Is this what you're bullish on, by the way, when we get to that? Because you're climbing three mountains.
01:14:13.498 - 01:14:25.762, Speaker B: Three mountains. Two mountains over the next ten days. But the point why this is connects to coffee is I'm bringing freshly ground coffee in my Aero Press Bankless Nation. If you don't own an aeropress is A-E-R-O press.
01:14:25.816 - 01:14:26.082, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:14:26.136 - 01:14:34.350, Speaker B: And so I'm going to have my lovely coffee out at, like, 12,000ft up. Yeah, it makes great coffee.
01:14:34.510 - 01:14:46.642, Speaker A: In fact, I think it's some of the best coffee I've had, yours notwithstanding, my friend. Actually, can I just pull up this tweet? Because I saw this this came up in my feed yesterday. Seven days until Baker's, twelve days until Rayner. Did I say that right? Rainier?
01:14:46.706 - 01:14:47.554, Speaker B: You did not. Rainier.
01:14:47.602 - 01:14:52.902, Speaker A: Yeah, rainier. 32 days until Matterhorn. These are the mountains you're climbing?
01:14:52.966 - 01:14:53.580, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:14:54.510 - 01:14:55.354, Speaker A: What's this one?
01:14:55.392 - 01:15:06.238, Speaker B: That one's rainier. Okay. That one's special because I grew up in Seattle, and so you can see that one from Seattle, and so I would look at that mountain, like, almost every single day of my life, and now I get to go climb it.
01:15:06.404 - 01:15:09.374, Speaker A: And you're doing that you're starting that next week, right? Yes.
01:15:09.492 - 01:15:21.890, Speaker B: Tomorrow I leave for Seattle, going to go hang out with my nephew and family for five days, hang out with them for the fourth, and then Wednesday at 06:30 A.m., there's a gear check. Make sure I brought all the right gear so I don't die. And then we go to Baker.
01:15:22.790 - 01:15:24.098, Speaker A: Wow. David yeah.
01:15:24.184 - 01:15:34.342, Speaker B: Well, on behalf of my I go to bed lately, and I'm like, I'm kind of stressed. I'm sitting in bed, I'm like, oh, man, that's a lot.
01:15:34.396 - 01:15:40.886, Speaker A: First one looks daunting to me, and then they just get harder. Look at that. What is that?
01:15:40.988 - 01:15:54.062, Speaker B: That's the matterhorn. That's not a very good picture of the Matterhorn, but yes. Okay, so Baker and Rainier is nice because if you fall, you just get back up. You just fall in snow on the Matterhorn. You can't fall.
01:15:54.196 - 01:15:58.320, Speaker A: Okay. On behalf of the entire bankless nation, just come back. Okay.
01:15:59.090 - 01:16:07.540, Speaker B: I pay money to Guides to make sure I come back. It's somebody's job to make sure I come back, and it's not me.
01:16:08.150 - 01:16:11.394, Speaker A: Wow, that is somewhat comforting. You're doing some training going into this, too.
01:16:11.432 - 01:16:19.238, Speaker B: Oh, dude, I spent six and a half hours on a treadmill stairstepper last weekend. That was my right.
01:16:19.324 - 01:16:22.230, Speaker A: All right, well, be safe. Be safe. What are you bullish on?
01:16:22.300 - 01:17:07.826, Speaker B: I'm bullish on technologies throwing it back to Zuzalu content. If you only watch one bit of Zuzalu content, make it the intro and perhaps also the full interview of Vital. But there's, like, a video essay of me giving you the account of Zuzalu, the significance of it, what it is, and what my biggest takeaways. So if you want to just get these quickest TLDR watch the Vitalik interview or just the ten minutes of my video essay at the very beginning, and that will give you everything that you need to know. I was listening to it because I hadn't listened to it in a while, and I was like, okay, yes, this came out the way that I wanted it to. And so I'm just bullish on frontier. What are frontier technologies like AI.
01:17:07.826 - 01:17:40.218, Speaker B: Longevity, decentralized science, synthetic biology, public goods, ZK, cryptography. And the line that I give is, like, ethereum is the eldest, most mature sibling of a bunch of Frontier technologies. It grew up sooner than the rest of them. AI is now coming of age. These other Frontier technologies are still trying to figure out how to stand up. So Ethereum is like, the eldest sibling that's, like, alone in this room, fighting with its parents. Like, the regulators, the nation states, and it doesn't have any other frontier technologies to support it because it's alone.
01:17:40.218 - 01:17:54.722, Speaker B: But all of those frontier technologies like AI, longevity, synthetic biology, network states, they're also going to need support from their siblings because the incumbents aren't going to accept them and legitimize them.
01:17:54.776 - 01:18:28.942, Speaker A: Well, I was reflecting on this too. It's like some of the challenges that we've seen in crypto. I mean, you look at AI right now, same thing, regulators, what are regulators going to do? What is the right regulatory posture? And then there's also some critiques of the AI companies right now, the big ones, engaging in regulatory capture. Right. It's a problem crypto has as well. How do we make sure the big centralized service providers or banks don't completely own this thing? Regulatory capture? It's like a similar set of concerns. And yeah, crypto has been on the forefront of that.
01:18:28.942 - 01:18:31.902, Speaker A: So AI, I guess, is going to face them as well.
01:18:32.036 - 01:18:35.678, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's what I'm bullish on frontier technologies. Ryan what are you bullish on?
01:18:35.844 - 01:19:27.294, Speaker A: Roll ups? Man, there's been like a roll up explosion. I feel like in terms of infrastructure, we get cheap block space here. So we had the announcement of Zksync's ZK Stack, of course, and it just seems like every roll up has a strategy here. So ZK stack op stack polygon Arbitrum I'm just looking forward to a world when we have cheap bandwidth, transaction bandwidth, and anybody can spin up their own chain. This is kind of like the days of the Internet where anybody could spin up their own blog or anybody could spin up their own server and host their own website. I think it's going to unleash a massive wave of innovation that, again, we still need the apps. We can't see those yet, but now we have cheap block space and I think we're going to live in a world of many chains.
01:19:27.294 - 01:19:34.642, Speaker A: Thousands, tens of thousands of chains. I'm just excited about all of the work that's getting done in the build market, as we've called it.
01:19:34.696 - 01:19:36.082, Speaker B: You know what I'm excited about?
01:19:36.216 - 01:19:36.802, Speaker A: What?
01:19:36.936 - 01:19:52.360, Speaker B: All of the layer two thesis that we didn't exactly become as a podcast, as like a media platform wasn't accepted in 2021 because it was all about the alt layer ones. What is showing strength in the bear market?
01:19:52.830 - 01:19:54.010, Speaker A: Layer twos.
01:19:54.670 - 01:20:03.686, Speaker B: Layer twos, and that to me is signal. If you can show strength in a bear market, what do you think you can do in a bull market? And so that's what gets me excited.
01:20:03.878 - 01:20:14.000, Speaker A: It's so hard to get traction in the bear market is what you're saying. I think the communities that survive will thrive yes. In the next bull cycle. Which is happening when? Starting now.
01:20:15.010 - 01:20:16.882, Speaker B: We are in Schrodinger's market now.
01:20:16.936 - 01:20:17.298, Speaker A: Okay.
01:20:17.384 - 01:20:18.754, Speaker B: Next year is the bull market.
01:20:18.872 - 01:20:20.402, Speaker A: It's scheduled. Good book.
01:20:20.456 - 01:20:22.302, Speaker B: I scheduled it full circle. It's on my calendar.
01:20:22.366 - 01:20:24.466, Speaker A: On your calendar? No mountain climbing next year.
01:20:24.488 - 01:20:27.300, Speaker B: David oh, no, I don't want to hear that.
01:20:28.070 - 01:20:29.998, Speaker A: Yeah, mountain climb during the bear market.
01:20:30.104 - 01:20:31.320, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right.
01:20:32.330 - 01:20:32.854, Speaker A: All right.
01:20:32.892 - 01:20:33.862, Speaker B: Ready for meme of the week?
01:20:33.916 - 01:20:35.414, Speaker A: Yeah. Meme of the week. What are we looking at?
01:20:35.452 - 01:20:56.400, Speaker B: Here we go. This isn't exactly a meme, but this is funny. I thought it was funny. Okay. So Ryan was co working at my place in Brooklyn, and so he was over there just, like, in my kitchen counter island thing. And instead of turning around and speaking to me, he would just send me messages in discord. He's like, hey, what do you think about this?
01:20:56.930 - 01:21:04.190, Speaker A: Look, it has the context you had your headphones in. I didn't want to disrupt you. That's how we always speak. I'm not used to actually talking to you in person.
01:21:04.340 - 01:21:08.980, Speaker B: The one time you can just turn around and speak words you're like, not discord, bro.
01:21:10.230 - 01:21:19.586, Speaker A: Thanks for the coffee, though. It was fun. Guys. We'll end with this. Of course. Gotta let you know, none of this has been financial advice. It never is on bankless.
01:21:19.586 - 01:21:33.074, Speaker A: It's not even frontier technology advice. Though David gave us a lot of content from Suzalu this week. Crypto is risky. You could definitely lose what you put in. But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the Bankless journey.
01:21:33.074 - 01:21:33.540, Speaker A: Thanks a lot.
