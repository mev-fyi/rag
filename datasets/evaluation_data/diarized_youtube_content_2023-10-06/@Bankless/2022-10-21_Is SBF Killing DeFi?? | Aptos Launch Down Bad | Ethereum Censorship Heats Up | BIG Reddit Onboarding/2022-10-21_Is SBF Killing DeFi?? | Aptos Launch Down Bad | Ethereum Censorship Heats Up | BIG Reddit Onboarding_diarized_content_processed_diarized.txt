00:00:02.570 - 00:00:07.290, Speaker A: Hey, bankless nation. Happy third Friday of October, David. What time is it, Ryan?
00:00:07.370 - 00:00:18.682, Speaker B: It's the Friday bankless weekly roll up where we cover the entire weekly news in crypto, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persevere nonetheless into the frontier. With coffee. With your coffee. With your Friday morning coffee.
00:00:18.746 - 00:00:22.062, Speaker A: David, before the show you told me you had too much coffee. How much is too much for you, man?
00:00:22.116 - 00:00:23.082, Speaker B: Three cups.
00:00:23.226 - 00:00:26.630, Speaker A: Three cups. So is that what you had before? I had recording this?
00:00:26.700 - 00:00:27.126, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:27.228 - 00:00:29.734, Speaker A: And that's like before 01:00 p.m., yes.
00:00:29.772 - 00:00:31.926, Speaker B: That's three cups before 11:00 a.m. How.
00:00:31.948 - 00:00:33.320, Speaker A: Do you know it's too much?
00:00:34.810 - 00:00:41.530, Speaker B: Yeah, you just know it. You just feel a little bit jittery. Yeah. A little bit manic.
00:00:43.150 - 00:00:44.518, Speaker A: People know I'm on my 7th cup.
00:00:44.534 - 00:00:47.750, Speaker B: Dave. That is insane. That is insane. I would die.
00:00:47.830 - 00:00:50.714, Speaker A: I think I would have to sit.
00:00:50.752 - 00:00:52.918, Speaker B: Down on the ground and just wait for that to pass.
00:00:53.024 - 00:01:03.182, Speaker A: Sorry, 7th so far. I shouldn't limit myself. The day is still young. Yeah, I might have a problem. Anyway. Happy weekly roll up. Just enjoy one cup of coffee, if you will.
00:01:03.182 - 00:01:18.354, Speaker A: We're not encouraging more than that. Just one with your weekly roll up. David, we got a lot of hot topics this week. Number one, SBF. That is Sam Bankman Fried, the billionaire, super billionaire founder of FTX. He's got some ideas on how to regulate Defi. David, I don't love a lot of these ideas.
00:01:18.354 - 00:01:19.110, Speaker A: How about.
00:01:19.260 - 00:01:37.594, Speaker B: No, I don't remember seeing him asking the rest of Defi about thoughts about things. He's kind of going rogue on this one. Following SBF Aptos, the newest layer one on the block from ex meta employees launched but also flopped. We'll talk about that. Ryan, what are we coming in third?
00:01:37.792 - 00:02:06.450, Speaker A: Ethereum, censorship. It's been a hot button topic. We did that episode with Justin Drake, but it is increasingly a hot button topic, particularly around relayers. We're going to talk about what relayers are flashbots, all of these things. And the big question, I think, for the Ethereum community is, are we in a critical state or is this a nothing burger? We have to sound the alarm or not. So we'll get into all of these things. As always, make sure you like and subscribe wherever you are listening to, wherever you are watching.
00:02:06.450 - 00:02:35.470, Speaker A: That gets us up to the top of the charts. David. Before we get in, we have a message from our friends and sponsors at Push Push protocol. David, this is an app that I know love and I use. The way you activate this app is you just enter you log in with your wallet address, and what you can do is subscribe to alerts. Very handy alerts. I don't know how many times I have woken up in the middle of the night being like, oh my God, am I about to get liquidated?
00:02:36.370 - 00:02:37.950, Speaker B: How many times, Ryan?
00:02:38.930 - 00:02:44.462, Speaker A: Well, not so much this cycle, zero times for you, but I will tell you, no. In the original cycle, sure.
00:02:44.516 - 00:02:45.342, Speaker B: First cycle, yeah.
00:02:45.396 - 00:03:09.946, Speaker A: 2018, 2019, things were getting pretty tense. And then also my ens names, for example, like when do they renew? You need to know that there's nothing on chain that will let you know that except for push. You can opt into notifications about Ens, about your collateral requirements, about whether you are in the money or out of the money on a uniswap liquidity pool. There's literally hundreds of different alerts you can sign up for. David, what do you like about this app?
00:03:10.048 - 00:03:21.878, Speaker B: Well, as the metaverse with the thing we're building, that Ethereum is going to be this scaffolding skeleton of builds out. We need push notifications to go and because what do you do when you wake up in the morning, Ryan?
00:03:21.974 - 00:03:23.402, Speaker A: You look at your. Check my phone.
00:03:23.456 - 00:03:40.478, Speaker B: Yeah, right. You get your push notifications. So the metaverse is going to need something like push to notify people of shit going on in the metaverse. And so you can go and check them out@Push.org. If you are interested in receiving push notifications or pushing push notifications to your users.
00:03:40.654 - 00:03:50.754, Speaker A: David, I got one in there for flag me when ETH is under $895 because that way I can outbid you and get in lower if it happens this market cycle.
00:03:50.802 - 00:03:56.310, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I don't think there's. You have to sign in for a defi app to get notified of that defi app that wants to notify you?
00:03:56.380 - 00:04:14.222, Speaker A: No, it's actually off chain stuff too. They have like price alerts in here too. On chain or off chain, you can even get alerted with your favorite crypto publications like Bankless France. New post from bankless France in there. Yeah, pretty cool. All right, tell us about markets. Speaking of price, what's bitcoin doing this week?
00:04:14.356 - 00:04:25.758, Speaker B: Nothing. Not really anything. Started the week at 19,150 ish dollars, ending the week at 19,150 ish dollars. So flat. Super flat. I'll take it.
00:04:25.924 - 00:04:27.010, Speaker A: Better flat than down.
00:04:27.080 - 00:04:27.314, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:27.352 - 00:04:28.174, Speaker A: How about Eth?
00:04:28.302 - 00:04:34.082, Speaker B: ETH also flat. 12,800 or 12,080 currently. And that's where it started this week.
00:04:34.136 - 00:04:36.222, Speaker A: Is this another crab market? Is this like the summertime?
00:04:36.286 - 00:04:46.646, Speaker B: Yeah. So when we recorded the last weekly roll up, it was like when we had nuked down to, like, one, $200, and then as soon as we got done recording the weekly roll up, we bounced right back up to $1,300.
00:04:46.748 - 00:04:47.330, Speaker A: Correlation.
00:04:47.410 - 00:04:55.830, Speaker B: The $1,300 number for ether and $1,900 number for bitcoin is like, super. Just a magnet, I guess. Yeah. Sticky.
00:04:55.910 - 00:04:57.738, Speaker A: Sticky right now. Until something new happens.
00:04:57.824 - 00:04:58.170, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:58.240 - 00:05:06.240, Speaker A: What is that new thing going to be? It's got to be macro. It can't be in crypto. Yes. There's not much. We're post merge. What's the next exciting news in crypto? The happening.
00:05:06.770 - 00:05:14.430, Speaker B: That's the thing. There's, like, a bunch of exciting things in crypto, so no one can focus on one meme because there's, like, three different things and they're all, like, smaller than the merge.
00:05:14.510 - 00:05:21.422, Speaker A: A lot of smaller building going on. No main chain, major events here. How about the ethiopian ratio?
00:05:21.486 - 00:05:22.254, Speaker B: It's flat.
00:05:22.382 - 00:05:22.974, Speaker A: Also flat.
00:05:23.022 - 00:05:23.966, Speaker B: Surprise.
00:05:24.158 - 00:05:31.826, Speaker A: That's actually not bad for ETH in the bear market, though. I mean, you'd expect during the bear market much more loss on the ratio.
00:05:31.858 - 00:05:35.782, Speaker B: And we're not seeing it in history. Yes. If you look back to history.
00:05:35.836 - 00:05:37.302, Speaker A: Yeah, this is history. Look at this.
00:05:37.356 - 00:05:52.938, Speaker B: Yeah. That ratio looks so good. The problem is the ratio looks so good over. Almost coming up on three year time horizon now. So in order for that to continue looking good, it's just going to take 1.5 more years for that to keep on going up.
00:05:53.024 - 00:05:53.670, Speaker A: Anyway.
00:05:53.840 - 00:05:55.550, Speaker B: Long term focus. Long term Focus.
00:05:55.620 - 00:06:00.574, Speaker A: You know what I saw this week, David? What? You have hashtag bitcoin in your Twitter bio now.
00:06:00.612 - 00:06:04.258, Speaker B: Right now, I saw that there's a story behind that.
00:06:04.424 - 00:06:08.238, Speaker A: Do you have this story? Is this a story that is disposable?
00:06:08.334 - 00:06:09.426, Speaker B: No, it's not.
00:06:09.528 - 00:06:20.658, Speaker A: Bitcoin shills paid, David. That's what. Is that what happened? I think this is a private bet among friends that he made. That's my guess, that I lost body language here, that maybe he lost.
00:06:20.754 - 00:06:21.494, Speaker B: Okay.
00:06:21.692 - 00:06:28.658, Speaker A: There are worse things to lose. It's pretty funny, though, David, the bitcoin bull global crypto market cap. What are we looking at? We under a trillion?
00:06:28.754 - 00:06:32.438, Speaker B: Under a trillion? Nine five. 6,000,000,950. 6 billion.
00:06:32.534 - 00:06:35.818, Speaker A: Okay. Is that also flat in the week? Yeah, neither up nor down.
00:06:35.904 - 00:06:36.682, Speaker B: It was a flat week.
00:06:36.736 - 00:06:54.206, Speaker A: All right, summary. Flat week, neither up nor down. Housing mortgage rates are going up, though. This is a tweet from Guinevere. Breaking 30 year fixed rate mortgages hit 7.15%. Also breaking the housing market. It feels that way.
00:06:54.206 - 00:07:01.770, Speaker A: 7.15%. I have never seen rates this high in my probably lifetime, my adult lifetime.
00:07:01.930 - 00:07:06.854, Speaker B: So what does this mean for me? I'm a crypto person who bought a house during the bull market.
00:07:06.972 - 00:07:07.878, Speaker A: You own a house.
00:07:07.964 - 00:07:08.854, Speaker B: Good job. Yeah.
00:07:08.892 - 00:07:09.046, Speaker A: Okay.
00:07:09.068 - 00:07:09.414, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:07:09.452 - 00:07:15.986, Speaker A: Can I ask you, did you buy that house, or do you have. Is this a personal question? Do you buy that house or do you have a mortgage?
00:07:16.018 - 00:07:16.818, Speaker B: I have a mortgage.
00:07:16.914 - 00:07:17.586, Speaker A: You have a mortgage?
00:07:17.618 - 00:07:18.354, Speaker B: Yes, I have a mortgage.
00:07:18.402 - 00:07:19.954, Speaker A: What rate did you lock into that mortgage?
00:07:20.002 - 00:07:21.020, Speaker B: Two point something.
00:07:21.470 - 00:07:35.070, Speaker A: Hell yeah, David. All right, this is my take on that tweet. All right? Okay. Actually, I don't have that tweet up, but here's what I said. Locking in a 3% fixed rate mortgage or under is the new. I bought bitcoin under $300.
00:07:35.220 - 00:07:39.520, Speaker B: Okay. But I also bought the top of the housing market, though.
00:07:39.890 - 00:07:40.846, Speaker A: I know which.
00:07:40.868 - 00:07:43.134, Speaker B: 01:00 a.m.. I. Happy or sad? I don't know.
00:07:43.172 - 00:07:50.418, Speaker A: Well, right now, mortgages are going up, but house prices aren't dropping. I don't know if you've looked at the zillow rates for your house.
00:07:50.504 - 00:07:51.140, Speaker B: No.
00:07:51.510 - 00:07:57.990, Speaker A: I bet it's probably the same or at the level that you bought it in terms of, like, market value.
00:07:58.060 - 00:07:59.910, Speaker B: So I'm happy you're happy.
00:07:59.980 - 00:08:21.338, Speaker A: And the best thing about that is not almost, who cares? But you locked in at two point, what percent? Like 2.72.92. You're printing money, man. Like, congratulations. All right, we're inflating at, like, seven to eight. This may be the best financial decision you've ever made.
00:08:21.424 - 00:08:26.000, Speaker B: It's probably true. It's not even including buying ether at $80.
00:08:26.530 - 00:08:46.814, Speaker A: No, we can't include that. Other than ether, this is David's best so far. We don't know this. Okay, but you locked in an interest rate on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage at 2.7%. 2.79%. And money, like inflation, is 8%. So what's your Delta man making? 5% per year.
00:08:46.872 - 00:08:47.462, Speaker B: Oh, good for?
00:08:47.516 - 00:09:04.518, Speaker A: Thank you, Uncle Sam. Thank you. That's like the dollar in high inflationary environments. You actually want to have a lot of fixed rate debt because it means you don't have to pay it. Very nice to be a debtor in these times for mortgages. But let me tell you who is screwed, David.
00:09:04.694 - 00:09:07.258, Speaker B: Everyone who is younger than me.
00:09:07.344 - 00:09:26.370, Speaker A: Gen Z. Totally. Do you know how the meme of which is true? Like, millennials getting screwed, like, financial crisis, and then you can't afford a house. And how many millennials are not able to afford this. Look at this value. Beauty and charm. This is a four bedroom, two bathroom house somewhere in the burbs.
00:09:26.370 - 00:09:31.490, Speaker A: 19. What year? 1950 something. 54.
00:09:31.640 - 00:09:32.194, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:32.312 - 00:09:34.594, Speaker A: Rent is $87 a month.
00:09:34.792 - 00:09:43.558, Speaker B: Yeah, but that also has a ton of loss in value of the dollar. You could get a cheeseburger for like fifty cents back then.
00:09:43.724 - 00:10:09.502, Speaker A: This is also true there's inflation baked in, but it's also true that home prices as an asset, like homes themselves, have risen far faster than inflation. Like something like three x, four x. And so I thought millennials were screwed, but like Gen Z now, how are you supposed to afford a house when house prices are so expensive and your interest rates are like 78%? What's like the monthly payment look like on that?
00:10:09.556 - 00:10:21.890, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, isn't every single generation further away from the boomers just more collectively more screwed that way? Yeah, I think that's kind of how it works. The further you are away from the boomers, the harder it is.
00:10:22.040 - 00:10:48.598, Speaker A: This is how it's seeming so far, absolutely brutal, but the rates keep increasing. This is a tweet from our friend Michael Saylor. If you flew an aircraft carrier like this, you would a, stall, b, rip the wings off, or c, crash and burn. And he is showing a chart of the US one year government bond yield. This is bonds. This is the yield of bonds. This is kind of showing you what the Fed is doing, the central bank.
00:10:48.598 - 00:11:06.286, Speaker A: And for those of you that can't see listening, the podcast we see in 2018, kind of a brief bump up and then massive volatility spike all the way downward to zero. Covid spike and then this crazy ascent. David, you've flown planes before. It's possible to take off like this. Is that how planes work?
00:11:06.388 - 00:11:09.646, Speaker B: Yeah. You need a massive engine to be able to do that. You need a rocket ship.
00:11:09.678 - 00:11:09.826, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:09.848 - 00:11:15.950, Speaker B: You need to be in jet. You need to be in a very fast, lean jet.
00:11:16.030 - 00:11:21.030, Speaker A: Okay, so validate this. If you flew an aircraft like this, would you rip the wings off, David?
00:11:22.010 - 00:11:26.040, Speaker B: You would stall is what you would do. You would run out of energy. Yeah.
00:11:26.570 - 00:11:36.918, Speaker A: This is crazy. I feel like it's the next experiment of the central banks is like how much volatility can the bond market take before the wings get ripped?
00:11:37.014 - 00:11:39.900, Speaker B: Currently taking more than bitcoin. Remember that from last.
00:11:40.430 - 00:11:44.410, Speaker A: True, true. Meanwhile, tell us about ultrasound money, David.
00:11:44.490 - 00:11:58.510, Speaker B: It's super ultrasound, Ryan, I'm so glad you asked. Last week was the first week that we had a ton of burn. And this week we also have a ton of burn. I think last week we're at 5000 ether issued since merge.
00:11:58.590 - 00:11:59.170, Speaker A: Yes.
00:11:59.320 - 00:12:03.650, Speaker B: Right now we are at 3000 going down. Hundred going down.
00:12:03.800 - 00:12:04.818, Speaker A: That's what we like.
00:12:04.904 - 00:12:41.354, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what we like to see. And so the current supply of ETH has like peaked out at 120,534,000 was what it was about two weeks ago. We are now down to 524,000. If we continue on this trajectory, Ryan, in like maybe three, four days, we will actually be below the ether supply where we were when we merged. And ether will become deflationary since the merge. That is awesome. Last year or last week we talked about how this was because of this new Ponzi token, Zen crypto.
00:12:41.354 - 00:13:28.842, Speaker B: Well, actually in the last three days it's been uniswap V three OpenC and Uniswap V two as the three largest burners of ETH, collectively burning basically 3000 ether above Zen crypto, still burning 900 ether. And then ETH transfers, burning 800 ether, tether transfers, burning 630 ether. So this is good, real sustainable burn, not from some ponzi token. And we are still going down. And just to recap, at the peak of issuance when the supply of ether was the highest, there was something like zero point 22% net inflation per year. We are all the way down to zero 3% net inflation per year. And if this burn continues, man, we are going to be deflationary since the merge.
00:13:28.842 - 00:13:29.680, Speaker B: Wow.
00:13:30.530 - 00:13:45.250, Speaker A: What I like about the burn leaderboard too, is like, it's all of these use cases of ETH is money. A lot of the Uniswap trading pairs are actually ETH. ETH transfers. Number three, burning a lot of ETH using ETH as money. I guess ETH is money after all. Maybe even. Maybe even.
00:13:45.250 - 00:13:47.806, Speaker A: I'm not going to say it. I am going to say it. Ultrasound.
00:13:47.838 - 00:13:53.382, Speaker B: Ultrasound. Money. Ultrasound. Money. Maybe we're almost there. We're almost there. It's kind of almost there.
00:13:53.516 - 00:13:58.150, Speaker A: This will never not be my favorite website. I can't imagine a better. Like what's better than this?
00:13:58.220 - 00:13:58.662, Speaker B: It's great.
00:13:58.716 - 00:14:00.546, Speaker A: Name me a better website on the Internet. David.
00:14:00.578 - 00:14:05.114, Speaker B: Oh, if we wait one more block, we're going to watch it go down below 3700. Wait for it.
00:14:05.152 - 00:14:05.994, Speaker A: You really want to do it?
00:14:06.032 - 00:14:06.506, Speaker B: Wait for it.
00:14:06.528 - 00:14:10.986, Speaker A: Every 20 seconds. 21 seconds. New block every 6 seconds.
00:14:11.018 - 00:14:15.194, Speaker B: Oh, it only went down a little bit anticlimactic.
00:14:15.322 - 00:14:19.354, Speaker A: We'll edit this part out. What's happening with Euler?
00:14:19.482 - 00:14:47.826, Speaker B: Euler. Euler TVL hitting a new all time high at almost $300 million. Euler a new money market on the scene like the likes of compound Ave Rari, but a little bit more governance minimized, a little bit more algorithmic. We recently did a show with them, an alpha leak coincidence that is hitting a new all time high of TVL? I don't know, but if you want to learn all about Euler, I did an alpha leak with Michael Bentley to learn all about it. Disclaimer Ryan and I are angel investors in Euler.
00:14:48.018 - 00:14:51.062, Speaker A: We are. And that token is now on the market, though.
00:14:51.196 - 00:14:52.762, Speaker B: Yes, that token is on the market.
00:14:52.896 - 00:14:55.018, Speaker A: Angel investor, a long time ago.
00:14:55.184 - 00:14:56.618, Speaker B: That was one of the first ones we did.
00:14:56.704 - 00:15:15.950, Speaker A: It took that project a while to come out. Token terminal, what are they doing? Okay, actually, this is music NFTs, and I know you've got a take on music NFTs, but I'm feeling some bullish vibes from you. Not only David, but other members of the bankless team keep talking about music NFTs. Is it showing up in the numbers yet?
00:15:16.020 - 00:15:38.710, Speaker B: It is showing up in the numbers yet. Monthly cumulative side by side fees is what we're looking at. Basically, to date, $3 million has been earned by artists, paid for by fans. So $3 million has been transferred from fans to artists. In my mind, all I'm seeing is $3 million of compensation for creating art. And that's what we like to see. $3 million, not that much.
00:15:38.710 - 00:16:26.326, Speaker B: But you have to remember, it actually doesn't take a lot of value transfer to really move the needle versus what something like Apple Music or Spotify does. Spotify and Apple music for value transfer from fans to artists is like first gear, where music NFTs, where if you buy one single music NFT that accounts for 100,000 listens, is one single music NFT sale. And so that's like third or fourth gear in terms of efficiency of what you get if you purchase a music NFt. So I know we're on the bankless roll up. We're used to numbers like hundreds of millions, billions, blah, blah, blah, blah. $3 million is small, but again, it's such a big order of improvement from what previous web two value transfer platforms provide.
00:16:26.428 - 00:16:42.170, Speaker A: And this is primarily on the sound protocol too, right? Sound XYz, which is where and David was talking about the art is actually music. So these are actually not jpegs. These are mp3 s that are selling. Jpegs are the album covers.
00:16:43.390 - 00:16:45.630, Speaker B: But it's mainly, it's the music, the sound to music.
00:16:45.700 - 00:16:58.450, Speaker A: It's all about the sound. Super cool. It's turning to sound. Okay, so do you think, let me ask you this. Do you remember JPeGs in 2020. NFTs 2020 hadn't taken off yet. It was late 2020.
00:16:58.450 - 00:17:10.440, Speaker A: But some people on the podcast telling us it was going to be huge. Absolutely. Like, really big thing. Do you think music NFTs are where jpegs were in winter of 2020?
00:17:11.050 - 00:17:41.326, Speaker B: My take is that music NFTs are not for crypto people. They are for music people, and music people are normies. Jpegs definitely was a product that we all like to speculate on just because there's, like, digital collectibles, right. Very, very adjacent to crypto money is digital collectibles. I think music NFTs are going to be more for artists and their fans, regardless of whether they are crypto people or not. And so I think that that is an invalid question.
00:17:41.508 - 00:17:45.978, Speaker A: An invalid question. So in other words, you think it'll just grow differently?
00:17:46.074 - 00:17:48.110, Speaker B: It'll grow, certainly it'll be more mainstream.
00:17:48.190 - 00:18:03.222, Speaker A: We saw kind of jpeg sort of start to take shape. Firstly, there were crypto collectors of jpegs, and then it bled into mainstream. And you're saying we sort of skipped that step. I think what you're saying is we kind of skip that step. Won't be as many crypto collectors, it'll just start with mainstream instead.
00:18:03.356 - 00:18:25.482, Speaker B: Right. Because some unknown artists can come in and start making like, an NFT collectible thing. But to sell a music NFT, you have to be a musician and you need to make good music. No one's going to collect bad music nfts probably. Hopefully. Actually, I take that back. I could probably see some crypto people figuring that out, but I do think it's just like, it's more mainstream than what we've seen previously.
00:18:25.546 - 00:18:42.990, Speaker A: Also kind of like NFT is kind of a regulatory proof industry. There's always ways for regulation. There's always ways for regulation. Don't let me speak too soon. And yet, this is not, like, as scary as a non state money asset that seems to be for regulators.
00:18:43.070 - 00:18:43.458, Speaker B: Agree.
00:18:43.544 - 00:18:56.194, Speaker A: Cool. We got a lot more coming up. SBF wants to regulate Defi. We're going to talk about that, what his idea of regulation looks like. Also, Aptos was a total flop. That's what it sounded like. The newest layer one chain on the block.
00:18:56.194 - 00:19:06.714, Speaker A: We'll tell you about that. And Ethereum censorship. Is this a problem or a massive nothing burger? We get into that as well. We'll be right back, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:19:06.832 - 00:20:00.026, Speaker B: Arbitrum one is pioneering the world of secure Ethereum scalability and is continuing to accelerate the web3 landscape hundreds of projects have already deployed on Arbitrum one, producing flourishing DFI and NFT ecosystems.

Ryan is it time to sound the fire alarm about another regulatory thing coming down the pipeline that's going to kill Defi? The Alliance Dao the team out of the Alliance Dao says the DCCPA greatly threatens Defi innovation. The proposed bill says three things, according to this tweet. The summary tweet gives the CFTC new powers to regulate spot markets, also forces human intermediation. We don't like that word intermediation, and also forces projects to sacrifice decentralization. It favors centralized incumbents and kills startups. Alliance opposes the DCCPA Ryan, you were paying attention to this while I was gone at Devcon, how big of a deal is this?
00:21:32.720 - 00:22:05.570, Speaker A: Yeah, I was paying attention to this. And I guess in my mind there are three things to know about the DCCPA. I have a hard time saying that this new bit of legislation actually stands for the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection act. This is coming out of the agriculture group committee in the Senate. Three things I think you should know. Number one, it feels like the US really wants to do something with crypto from a regulatory perspective. And what I mean is particularly legislators.
00:22:05.570 - 00:22:25.770, Speaker A: And also I think crypto kind of wants them to. We've been asking for more clarity. There's so much ambiguity. We want our legislators to do something. Number two, I've been told this bill actually has a real chance. There's so many bills about crypto, like hypothetically talked about and batted around. I've been told, David, that this bill could actually pass.
00:22:25.770 - 00:23:10.490, Speaker A: Like it actually might work and it could actually pass during kind of the lame duck session that we have in kind of the winter time period. The last thing, though, I will say, and this is important, you asked the question of should we sound the fire alarm? I think the answer is not yet. I know alliance Dow is kind of doing that in this tweet, but I think the answer is not quite yet. And the reason is the newest draft of the bill isn't yet public. All right, so a lot of people are fighting behind the scenes, including people, blockchain association, people we've had on the podcast, people that are defi friendly. These are lobbyists, these are educators. And our legislative, they're fighting to actually make this bill better, make it good.
00:23:10.490 - 00:23:18.860, Speaker A: And the fight's not over yet. And so what this tweet is responding to is an early leaked draft version of the bill.
00:23:19.470 - 00:23:22.490, Speaker B: A leaked draft version. So not the actual bill?
00:23:22.560 - 00:23:42.114, Speaker A: Not the actual bill. It was a version of the bill from like three weeks ago, is what I've been told. And it is true. It has a whole bunch of garbage in it, particularly garbage around DeFi. And the big concern about this earlier draft, I mean, it has good stuff. Like it says Ethan, bitcoin are not securities, they're commodities. I mean, that's good.
00:23:42.114 - 00:24:04.202, Speaker A: We would all support that. That's the clarity we want. Thumbs up. But it has some bad stuff because mainly deFi is not even considered, or worse, in some cases, it's treated the same as CFI. This is what the alliance is saying. They're saying forces human intermediation. They're not even considering the possibility that DeFi is code based and peer to peer so that is bad.
00:24:04.202 - 00:24:18.960, Speaker A: And that's why some critics in these earlier drafts have said, look, if something like this passes bye bye DeFi in the US, or maybe like buy uS's role in DeFi, you're going to eliminate yourself from the crypto market.
00:24:19.490 - 00:24:23.586, Speaker B: In what mechanism does it? Just like, how does that. Can you elaborate on that?
00:24:23.688 - 00:24:34.270, Speaker A: I haven't read all of the details of this particular draft, but it seems to do things like make all DeFi protocols in the US register.
00:24:34.430 - 00:24:41.554, Speaker B: Does it just operate under the assumption that decentralization is actually impossible, and therefore there's always somebody to register somewhere?
00:24:41.602 - 00:24:49.266, Speaker A: The high level is, it seems to operate under the assumption that all DeFi protocols can be regulated and treated the same way as an FTX or a coinbase.
00:24:49.298 - 00:24:50.586, Speaker B: Okay, so it's just ignoring the go.
00:24:50.608 - 00:25:40.694, Speaker A: Register with each state, just the whole same process and apparatus that applies to CFI and banks will just take that. And of course it can apply to some code and DeFi protocol and the creators of this code, and that just doesn't work. And that's inherently, I mean, it breaks the system, destroys the credible neutrality of the system. So I guess my take is, and Jake Trevinsky said this commenting even after this tweet that you originally read was posted, there's been some discussion today as to how the bill, this new bill we're talking about, affects Defi. Here's what I said after the Senate egg hearing on the bill last month. I'm hopeful that it can be amended to treat DeFi fairly, but we'll have to wait and see what the next draft says. So I guess my take, while you're out, David, my take is I'm following kind of Jake's lead here, right? He's working, they're working collectively behind the scenes.
00:25:40.694 - 00:26:06.194, Speaker A: There may come a time when it's time to throw up the bat signal and send out the fire alarms. And the bankless community needs to react to this, and all of crypto needs to react to this to either kill it or support it. But we don't know enough yet. So I'm saving that ammo until we know a little bit more. I feel like that's the right approach here. That said, David, there's another story in the midst of this. Do you want to lead into that?
00:26:06.232 - 00:26:55.050, Speaker B: This is not our first rodeo with undesirable regulation, proposed regulation in Congress. The difference here is SBF Sam Bankman, fried from FTX is like leading this thing and has been, apparently he's been in DC almost, living in DC, working with regulators to get this bill through. And that's kind of the big news here that I've gathered from crypto, Twitter and around is that SBF has just decided to go on his own and lead this bill. And the incentives here that seem to point in that all of DeFi is semi regulatable, therefore, we might as well do it on CFI rails. And, wow, that's really convenient for FTX and SBF. That's kind of been my take here. Is that accurate?
00:26:55.210 - 00:27:47.086, Speaker A: I think some of that criticism might be true, I guess I would say, is in the process of this bill's creation, it's been well known that SBF has been heavily active. He's not the only one pushing for this bill, but he's been an active participant along with the only one in crypto, right? No, there are a lot of DeFi advocates that are involved in this build interesting crypto lobbyists and such. Some of the people that you and I, and probably the bankless community, should actually trust to uphold DeFi rights, they've been also active in this bill and pushing against it, although I will say, with it, to craft it in kind of an image of what it should be. But I will say SBF has had some pretty big influence as well. So he's made massive amounts of political contributions. All of these contributions are public, numbering in the millions of dollars. And also, as you said, he's been active.
00:27:47.086 - 00:28:12.140, Speaker A: Like, he's been there. He's kind of, I don't know, maybe the adult in the room, right? The person who can kind of bridge fintech and that world, in the banking world with this new world of crypto, and he's got some. So I don't know. It's hard to know. Some people are saying, like, SBF is intentionally trying to sabotage Defi. Right. To me, you have to kind of wait and see.
00:28:12.140 - 00:28:33.054, Speaker A: These could be rumors. We don't actually know. But what SBF did publish yesterday at the time of recording was, as promised. He says, this is a tweet, my current thoughts on crypto regulation. And he writes a post, to his credit, open, transparent, about his thoughts on a possible digital asset. Industry standards. Right.
00:28:33.054 - 00:28:52.194, Speaker A: And he talks about. There's a heading here called sanctions allow lists and block lists. There's a section about hacks and accountability. There's a section about asset listing. What's the security, what's not tokenized equities. There's a section about consumer protections generally, the things legislators care about and regulators care about. There's also a section here about DeFi.
00:28:52.194 - 00:29:16.634, Speaker A: Okay, so I read this thing yesterday, David, and there are some things that make sense here. And of course, the straw man argument that people might make to those in the DeFi community is, oh, you're in Defi? You don't want any regulation at all. Right. No, that's not true. We actually really want clarity. We really want regulation. But do you know what's worse than no regulation?
00:29:16.762 - 00:29:17.866, Speaker B: Bad regulation.
00:29:17.978 - 00:29:34.126, Speaker A: Yes, bad regulation. If we end up with bad regulation, these laws get on the book. They could set the US crypto industry back by like years, maybe generations, maybe it'll never recover. Right? And so I went through this. Here's my response. David. Sam, this is, this was spicy.
00:29:34.158 - 00:29:34.958, Speaker B: This was spicy.
00:29:35.054 - 00:29:54.214, Speaker A: With respect, utmost respect for everything you've done in crypto. This absolutely sucks. I said, you're saying DeFi should be OFAC. You're saying on chain freezes should be normal. You're saying DeFi front ends need to register as a broker dealer. No, this is not reasonable. This would eliminate the US from the crypto race.
00:29:54.342 - 00:29:56.282, Speaker B: Here's Sam's advocating for all of those things.
00:29:56.336 - 00:30:23.154, Speaker A: Yes. From his, like, if you read this and we'll include a link in the show notes, there's this section on OFAC. He says this. Then both centralized and decentralized applications can query in real time the list of sanctioned addresses to avoid transferring funds to or accepting funds from those addresses. He's saying, basically, if you're a Uniswap or DeFi, and before you let an address do something with your protocol, you have to query the OFAC sanctions list.
00:30:23.272 - 00:30:28.146, Speaker B: Is this okay, he's advocating for application layer censorship.
00:30:28.258 - 00:30:30.598, Speaker A: Application layer OFAC sanctions. Correct.
00:30:30.684 - 00:30:31.542, Speaker B: Right. Okay.
00:30:31.676 - 00:30:37.330, Speaker A: Now he's saying, and he even says this, he's not advocating for validator level censorship.
00:30:37.410 - 00:30:40.554, Speaker B: Right. Not protocol layer, which is something we're about to talk to in a second.
00:30:40.592 - 00:31:12.178, Speaker A: But Uniswap having to basically OFAC check you or not, that is something he's advocating for. What else is there here? Just to back some of these statements up. Talking about on chain freezes, if there's kind of like normalizing the idea of being able to freeze assets on chain, I don't possibly. The implication is writing that into the code. Obviously this would apply to a USDC, but into other assets as well. Maybe validators have this obligation as well. And this one really triggered me.
00:31:12.178 - 00:31:31.574, Speaker A: If you host a website that makes it easy for us retail to connect to and trade on a Dex, you would likely have to register it as something like a broker dealer. Yo, David, what if you host an interface for Uniswap? You gotta be a broker dealer. You have to go apply for a license.
00:31:31.702 - 00:32:00.270, Speaker B: Okay, so going and show me the incentive. I'll show you the outcome. Yeah. FTX, big competitive competitor out there, is the aggregate DFI landscape. And so Sam, the guy who's been donating $39 million to political organizations in the Biden campaign, is now saying, hey, Dexes and DFI should have to register to become a broker dealer. That's what regulatory arbitrage is. That's legalized corruption.
00:32:00.270 - 00:32:03.230, Speaker B: That's the whole thing we're trying to not do in crypto.
00:32:03.310 - 00:32:39.470, Speaker A: All right, so this is obviously my worry, and I think many of the crypto community's worry. Sam, in this thread, and to his credit, SBF was engaging back and forth, public engagement. People were calling him on this, myself included, others, and he was engaging back and forth. And his point was, hey, if you don't do this, the de facto is worse. And I'm at least working in DC to pass something that is better than nothing, better than what we have today. And is it? No, this is terrible now.
00:32:39.540 - 00:32:39.870, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:39.940 - 00:33:01.090, Speaker A: To be clear, I don't want to mix a hot take. I don't want to mix this up. His personal thoughts on regulation, I don't want to mix that up with the bill itself. Okay. These ideas are not necessarily in the bill, but this gives you a sense for where his head is. And when I read this, I was just like, oh, we are not here for the same reasons, are we? Right. You do this, David.
00:33:01.170 - 00:33:03.174, Speaker B: That's always been our frustration with, like.
00:33:03.212 - 00:33:13.082, Speaker A: Yeah, but you do this, and what's the freaking point? You remove all of the credible neutrality of us crypto, and what do you have? You have nothing.
00:33:13.216 - 00:33:26.378, Speaker B: And it's got to be negative ev for negative expected value for FTX, because if you nuke the cool things that make crypto what they are, where does FTX's business come from? It comes from crypto.
00:33:26.554 - 00:33:55.254, Speaker A: Over the long run, I think that's true. I don't know if he thinks maybe there's some money to be made in basically providing the AML KyC type layer. I don't know what he's thinking. I actually don't understand. But, like, this, to me, definitely has a flavor of, well, a crypto banker not sticking up for is what. Like, this is not. We didn't ask for this.
00:33:55.254 - 00:34:05.082, Speaker A: We don't want this. If you're going to participate and lobby in DC towards these, like, please don't, not on my behalf. Anyway, I don't want any of this.
00:34:05.216 - 00:34:07.260, Speaker B: I request to not have this.
00:34:07.870 - 00:34:34.754, Speaker A: Now, to be fair, he's saying, if you have feedback, give me a better suggestion. I'm completely happy for the crypto community, the Defi community, to present better suggestions, and we will in the future. And I hope people like Sam actually listen to this feedback. He might not be in it for the reasons we're in it, but he has to respect why crypto is valuable in the first place and not start to erode these values. David, there are some other takes around the community. You want to talk about some of these? Yeah.
00:34:34.792 - 00:34:58.886, Speaker B: DC investor says SBF is the most effective value extractor in crypto. He's very transparent in that he wants to siphon value out of your account into whatever causes he claims to care about. Couldn't care less about decentralization. Meanwhile, npcs hear Simp and worship him like a hero. Pathetic. Ooh, DC coming in with this spice. Yeah, I mean, so, like, Sam Bankman free does have this cult following in crypto.
00:34:58.886 - 00:35:12.574, Speaker B: Anyone that makes, like, a billion dollars in crypto is going to generate a cult following. I think DC here, DC is saying, hey, let's not do that. Let's not exalt billionaires because they've made billions. Exactly. Yeah.
00:35:12.612 - 00:35:13.534, Speaker A: How about this take.
00:35:13.652 - 00:35:38.274, Speaker B: Scott Lewis says FTX is spending money to push a law through Congress that may force DeFi protocols to operate like centralized exchanges. This proposal is called the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act. A better name would be Digital Commodities FTX Protection act. That's what I was saying when it was like, yes, this is like, okay, somebody builds a big entity and then they start lobbying regulation to protect them. I see this take as well. Yes, indeed.
00:35:38.322 - 00:35:43.542, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that is the big fear. This is where that number came from. What's this tweet saying, david?
00:35:43.606 - 00:35:57.100, Speaker B: Yeah. Sam Bankman Fried has spent $39.3 million quote, buying DC politicians since January. I mean, anyone who's been living in DC lately, that's what you would do.
00:35:57.570 - 00:36:10.990, Speaker A: Here's the thing. I think we actually do need to spend money. The crypto industry does. The DeFi industry does need to spend money and get out votes in order to get politicians working with us. That's just how the system works. But if we're.
00:36:11.150 - 00:36:26.822, Speaker B: I will bring up that Sam Bankman freed has promised to donate 99.9% of his wealth or something to effective altruism and give away all of his money. I haven't seen any tweet talking about him doing that. I would like to know if there's been progress on that front.
00:36:26.876 - 00:36:29.894, Speaker A: I mean, he said he's going to do it later. I don't know.
00:36:30.012 - 00:36:34.410, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll see. So am I. I'm also going to donate 99.9% of my wealth later.
00:36:34.480 - 00:36:35.660, Speaker A: Are you really, though?
00:36:36.510 - 00:36:37.482, Speaker B: Yes, I am.
00:36:37.536 - 00:36:38.460, Speaker A: Are you really?
00:36:38.830 - 00:36:39.386, Speaker B: No.
00:36:39.488 - 00:36:40.186, Speaker A: Okay.
00:36:40.368 - 00:36:41.930, Speaker B: Making fun of sampa.
00:36:42.350 - 00:36:59.714, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't judge him on that. You have to wait it actually, who else had a take on this? So this is a take from Eric Voorhees responding to SBF. And again, SBF has been on a lot of criticism. I appreciate that he showed up in Washington. I appreciate some of what he's doing.
00:36:59.752 - 00:37:00.562, Speaker B: He's not doing nothing.
00:37:00.616 - 00:37:45.010, Speaker A: He's not doing nothing. But if it results in terrible legislation, please, just don't do anything. This is Eric Voorhees saying, you can advocate for effective altruism or can advocate banning 80 million innocent Iranians from the future of global finance. You can't do both. Glorifying OFAC and proposed crypto industry standards is a non starter. That, to me, is actually, like, effective altruism aside, I actually think the thing that we're trying to do in preserving and propagating crypto protocols and crypto values, that is a public good, that is a service to future generations. And I wouldn't mind more spent on that.
00:37:45.010 - 00:37:53.860, Speaker A: I can't tell a billionaire where to spend his money, but if the result is we get something like this. David? No, thanks, man. No, thanks.
00:37:54.230 - 00:37:54.978, Speaker B: I'm out.
00:37:55.064 - 00:37:59.430, Speaker A: Last thing I'll say is, the invitation is open to Sam Bankman freed.
00:38:00.970 - 00:38:04.918, Speaker B: We are in dms. Yes. I'm waiting for him to confirm a week from today.
00:38:05.004 - 00:38:30.954, Speaker A: He said he'd be willing to come on the bankless podcast and talk about it, and I think that is the form. Like, you can't have a nuanced conversation over Twitter. Podcast is the form. And we would love for Sam to tell us about his take, tell us what he's thinking, respond to some of these criticisms, and we hope he takes us up on that offer. So we will see, my friend. That is that for now. David, can you tell me what the people really want to hear about? And that is the Aptos layer one, baby.
00:38:31.002 - 00:38:33.466, Speaker B: I just cannot wait to hear about Aptos.
00:38:33.498 - 00:38:33.934, Speaker A: Okay.
00:38:34.052 - 00:39:05.594, Speaker B: This shiny new monolithic layer, one that's promised to be even faster than all the other previous layer ones that have come out, has finally gone to mainnet. So Aptos autumn is here. This tweet says, was it actually here? I don't really know. But the news that I heard on Twitter and around is that it's not actually what it was all cracked up to be. So Aptos was a layer one blockchain that was built off of the move language, which was developed by the. What was that one? Facebook chain? Libra. Yeah.
00:39:05.594 - 00:39:12.506, Speaker B: So for people that weren't around during the Libra era, Facebook was wanting to make a digital currency. Literally a new currency.
00:39:12.618 - 00:39:15.726, Speaker A: Yeah, with an ETh killer attached. The whole. With an ETH killer platform.
00:39:15.828 - 00:39:46.470, Speaker B: Yeah. Before Congress said, no, Mark Zuckerberg, you can't have a new reserve currency. Sorry. But anyways, the team behind that has gone off and created Aptos using the move language that Libra was created. It promised to have a maximum ceiling of 100,000 transactions per second. And apparently I haven't verified this myself because I don't even know how to use Aptos, which is another problem that the current Aptos TPS is. Drumroll, Ryan.
00:39:47.210 - 00:39:49.626, Speaker A: Four for what?
00:39:49.808 - 00:39:51.260, Speaker B: Transactions per second.
00:39:51.950 - 00:39:54.602, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah, that's not the same.
00:39:54.736 - 00:39:56.070, Speaker B: That's less than Ethereum.
00:39:56.150 - 00:39:56.780, Speaker A: Okay.
00:39:57.950 - 00:40:34.882, Speaker B: Interestingly, while the blockchain seems to not be effective, the tokens have definitely been deployed and sent around to all stakeholders. And all this news break broke came from this Twitter account called Paradigm Engineer 420, who tweeted out, aptos is broken. And so I'll read some key tweets here. Aptos promises 100,000 transactions per second in its finalized version. However, the current TPS is somewhere in the four transaction range. It's hard to see how users can even use Aptos right now. I personally cannot find any rpcs worth connecting to or any validators that can send transactions.
00:40:34.882 - 00:41:00.666, Speaker B: Aptos team knows something is wrong because between Genesis and 01:30 p.m. Pacific time, the Aptos discord was disabled. Users couldn't chat or ask any questions. Kind of like the blockchain. They only recently opened up a few channels, but important channels like dev resources are still closed. The total supply of the APT token is a little bit over 1 billion. However, 821,000,000 is currently staked.
00:41:00.666 - 00:41:34.858, Speaker B: This means that over 80% of the token supply is controlled by the team and investors, and there was no airdrop or no other method to earn main net Aptos tokens. However, this doesn't account for the remaining 200 million Aptos tokens. Where could those liquid tokens be? Question mark. So they propose some potential answers. Sitting on investors FTX accounts waiting to dump on retail, or sitting in investors binance accounts waiting to dump on retail. The point is that the nearly entire and token supply is going to private parties. There was never a public sale or any method where users could have earned tokens and then they continue.
00:41:34.858 - 00:41:58.206, Speaker B: However, hope is not lost. Sui, another blockchain, is using the move language with arguably better tech. If I had to guess, Aptos knows that Sui will probably succeed in the long term and they hoped that by front running them on launch they could gain some sort of advantage. I will wait for the Sui launch trout a few applications on Optos and see what would happen. So that is the summary thread that we got out of that. Any?
00:41:58.388 - 00:42:07.454, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, here's the TLDR in this thread too. You are going to get dumped on. The only play I would make on Aptos is a quick farm and dump. This reminds me back.
00:42:07.512 - 00:42:08.610, Speaker B: Not financial advice.
00:42:08.690 - 00:42:39.166, Speaker A: Yeah, just maybe life advice goes without saying. So this reminds me a little bit of like 2018 again and kind of the promise of another crop of Ethereum killers, 2018 and 2019. And the best advice I kind of learned at that time that I think now applies to this new group of supposed. This isn't actually an ETH killer now it's a salana killer, which is being kind of branded, right? Yeah, salana killer, ETH killer by the transitory property.
00:42:39.268 - 00:42:39.486, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:39.508 - 00:42:49.742, Speaker A: But the best advice I could give, not financial advice, life advice, is just try the thing first. Forget about the freaking token. Don't buy a token.
00:42:49.886 - 00:42:50.706, Speaker B: Don't focus on it.
00:42:50.728 - 00:43:01.654, Speaker A: See if it works. Is there anything on there that's compelling? Compare it to your experience on other L2s and layer ones. Can you do anything on it?
00:43:01.852 - 00:43:08.326, Speaker B: Do you know the most recent valuation of Aptos based off of $2 billion?
00:43:08.428 - 00:43:13.306, Speaker A: Damn. Is that all kind of like private valuation. So vcs, private valuation stuff, that's the.
00:43:13.328 - 00:43:15.382, Speaker B: Highest number that VC pre launched chain.
00:43:15.446 - 00:43:19.946, Speaker A: Right. But again, it had the pedigree, it had move the language, it had the x meta Facebook team.
00:43:20.048 - 00:43:20.940, Speaker B: Oh boy.
00:43:21.490 - 00:43:27.914, Speaker A: I don't know, man. These kind of narratives are worth a lot. There's some few takes. Here's one from Olaf.
00:43:27.962 - 00:43:28.174, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:28.212 - 00:43:30.510, Speaker A: Remind me, what's the name of Olaf's firm?
00:43:31.170 - 00:43:31.962, Speaker B: Polychain.
00:43:32.026 - 00:43:35.866, Speaker A: Polychain? Multiple chains. Olaf is definitely embracing multiple chains.
00:43:35.898 - 00:43:36.802, Speaker B: As many chains as possible.
00:43:36.856 - 00:43:37.778, Speaker A: What does he say?
00:43:37.944 - 00:43:59.670, Speaker B: Olaf says the Aptos token distribution scheme is among the worst designs I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. And then he gives us the numbers. The foundation, 67.5%. The team, 19%. Investors, 13.5%. The only way coins get into, quote, the community parentheses lull, is through arbitrary foundation distributions. Yeah.
00:43:59.670 - 00:44:09.194, Speaker B: So the only way that community can get tokens is by buying them. There was some sort of airdrop, I think it was small. It was like maybe a couple of $1,000.
00:44:09.312 - 00:44:14.774, Speaker A: Here's the reaction I'm seeing from the community and all of crypto is like, we're just tired of the extractors and rotators.
00:44:14.822 - 00:44:16.034, Speaker B: So tired. Just so tired.
00:44:16.102 - 00:44:18.080, Speaker A: Exhausted by. It's a bear market.
00:44:18.610 - 00:44:39.046, Speaker B: It's just like, again, you know that one meme of just like, the comic of this guy that goes to a bear trap and like, bears, this is ridiculous. How are you falling for this? And then it goes to some other form of a trap and goes like, this is so silly. How can you fall for this? And then the last panel would be like, him buying the mean.
00:44:39.068 - 00:45:06.746, Speaker A: It's so DC investor calls this the vents of this week a near categorical rejection of Aptos by the community. I saw this mainly by the community. Kobe says you could tell who bought the seed round because they're tweeting, excited for launch rocket ship emoji instead of calling it kraptos and tweeting about how it already crashed. This is Anthony Cesano. You just know that three Zero's capital would be shilling the hell out of Aptos if they were still around. He follows.
00:45:06.778 - 00:45:11.710, Speaker B: That was one of my favorite tweets. Really? You can totally see it happening.
00:45:11.780 - 00:45:28.710, Speaker A: Well, this is the follow up was actually, in my opinion, I even enjoyed this more. He's quoting 3 hours capital potential. I have abandoned ethereum, avalanche, deer, polka dot, terra mina, and salana, despite supporting them in the past. My new chain is aptos. All in, baby.
00:45:29.850 - 00:46:00.606, Speaker B: People who didn't get that reference when Salana or not Salana, when 3 hours capital was done with their whole super cycle narrative and they were done on the EtH trade, they moved on to the sole Luna avax trade position. So this was in the second half of 2021. And Suzu said, yes, I have abandoned Ethereum despite supporting them in the past. And so what Anthony Sadano has done, he's just added every other chain that three O's capital also shield avalanche near Polka dot, terra Mina, and Salana, despite pointing them in the past. That was that reference, guys, put your.
00:46:00.628 - 00:46:06.402, Speaker A: Hands up if you are sick and tired of rotators and narratives without the building.
00:46:06.456 - 00:46:08.194, Speaker B: Hands up right here.
00:46:08.312 - 00:46:09.394, Speaker A: I'm tired of it.
00:46:09.512 - 00:46:10.820, Speaker B: David's tired of it.
00:46:11.190 - 00:46:16.454, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, dude, we didn't comment on David's wearing this ginormous spongeBob shirt today.
00:46:16.492 - 00:46:24.710, Speaker B: It's a huge spongebob on my no, it's meta because it's a sweater of spongebob wearing a sweater.
00:46:25.210 - 00:46:27.030, Speaker A: Oh, my God. How deep does it go?
00:46:27.180 - 00:46:28.418, Speaker B: Yeah, only two layers deep.
00:46:28.434 - 00:46:39.350, Speaker A: Okay, two layers deep. That's pretty good. Layer two. We'll get to layer three later. David, another big thing this week, that was a question. Not just this week, it's been the last couple of weeks, is growing.
00:46:39.430 - 00:46:39.626, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:39.648 - 00:47:02.418, Speaker A: Growing narrative of this talk of ethereum censorship. And this comes out of kind of OFAC compliant relayers, in particular flashbots. I pulled up a Reddit post, the title of this, and maybe you could explain it to us, is in the last 24 hours, 51% of eth blocks were censored and OFAC compliant. What is this? What does this mean? Is Ethereum being censored right now?
00:47:02.584 - 00:47:30.634, Speaker B: Yes. So this 51% here is coming from how many blocks came out of the flash bots or other OFAC compliant relayers. There's a lot of stuff packed in there. OFAC compliant. It just means that tornado cash transactions are not in this block. So now that we're on the website, we're actually seeing that 54% of blocks are OFAC compliant. As in 54% of Ethereum blocks do not have tornado cash transactions in them.
00:47:30.634 - 00:47:34.942, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure that's the only thing that means OFAC compliant or not. We're using tornado cash for now.
00:47:34.996 - 00:47:36.398, Speaker A: But OFaC could add whatever.
00:47:36.484 - 00:47:37.246, Speaker B: They could add more.
00:47:37.348 - 00:47:40.480, Speaker A: They could add David Hoffman, eth if it.
00:47:41.010 - 00:48:42.142, Speaker B: Well, and then, and then there's a couple relayers which are definitely not following OFAC compliance, which are probably outside of the United States. And that's like a very small sliver compared to OFAC compliance. Most blocks are like totally normal blocks. And so there's this big conversation, it's like, okay, we have all these relayers who, and this is strictly a part of the whole proposer builder Mev boost conversation, where people will build blocks for you, and then relayers will relay that to Ethereum stakers who will choose a block and then stake on that. Somebody like flashbots, the biggest relayer in Ethereum, because they are a US domiciled entity, has said, hey, yeah, we're going to follow OFAC and not violate the law, and we're only going to relay OFAC compliant blocks. So this has created a conversation of, is it the Ethereum protocol being censored because there's like 54% of blocks being produced are OFAC compliant. Now, there is a huge difference between creating a block versus building on prior blocks.
00:48:42.142 - 00:49:30.706, Speaker B: And so we'll call it 50 50 50% of blocks are OFAC compliant. 50% of blocks are non OFAC compliant. The non OFAC compliant blocks are taking comprise of 50% of all blocks added to Ethereum, and then the non compliant blocks are building on top of those blocks rather than building on top of the most recent OFAC compliant block. So OFAC non compliant blocks are making their way into ethereum easily, and this is not an issue. So people that want to be OFAC compliant are just adding on to the OFAC non compliant blocks. So tornado cash transactions are getting into Ethereum. They just take longer instead of taking, probabilistically speaking, instead of taking 12 seconds, they're taking perhaps 24 to 36 seconds to get in.
00:49:30.706 - 00:50:17.398, Speaker B: We are worried about this getting worse. We are worried about this approaching. As soon as we start to get like 90% to 95% of all blocks are OFAC compliant, then we actually start to be like, okay, it is now troublesome to use tornado cash, but not until we get to something like above 95% would it take like perhaps sometimes up to 5 minutes to get a tornado cash transaction into the blockchain. And so it really only becomes a critical issue when we start to actually get into the extreme saturation. And right now we're 50 50 50, still like a lot, still not good. However, it's been my opinion that this is just a very temporary part of Ethereum's history while we are just post merge without all this other infrastructure. But that is the conversation going on today, David.
00:50:17.434 - 00:50:45.882, Speaker A: This is a form of weak censorship. Soft censorship, yeah, is what Justin Drake would call it. And I would encourage you guys, if you want the full story on this, like the full download on how censorship resistant Ethereum is, go listen to the Justin Drake Bankless podcast on Uncensoble. Ethereum, I think is what it's called. He goes through this exact scenario that's happening right now. And so this is a form of weak censorship, not strong censorship. It's not happening at the validator level.
00:50:45.882 - 00:50:59.120, Speaker A: It's happening at the relayer level. And by the way, this relayer job function is set to be eliminated at some point in the protocol. We are no longer going to have relayers post some upcoming protocol changes.
00:50:59.490 - 00:51:48.986, Speaker B: Right. And that's a solution that we even have other solutions before we even get to that point, too. And so we are just in this one moment in Ethereum's history where we are at the weakest point of censorship resistance, which is the weeks to months following the merge. This is Latelaw Eth, who put out an interesting poll who said I'm a solo home validator in country a, we are at war with country b, and I decide that I'm not going to include donations to their military when it's my turn to make a block. This validator should a b for censoring, b voluntarily be exited, or c be tolerated? And about 41% said b slash for censoring. About 11% said voluntary exit, and 47% the slim majority said be tolerated. And that's also what I said, ryan.
00:51:48.986 - 00:52:03.742, Speaker B: I said be tolerated. And I also asked Martin Coppelman here asked what his answer was, because I had a debate back and forth with him about how severe the censorship thing was. And Martin Coppelman says ideally the validator would not even have the option to censor.
00:52:03.806 - 00:52:04.222, Speaker A: Agreed.
00:52:04.286 - 00:52:50.914, Speaker B: And then Vitalik responded to that and said, I would say be tolerated as in allow that person to not include blocks. And Vitalik continues and says slashing or leaking or socially coordinated anything should only be considered for massive reorgs, which is what I was talking about with going back and building on a different chain, even though we know that we already have a good one to begin with. Slashing or leaking or socially coordinated anything should only be considered for massive reorgs of other people's blocks. Not making wrong choices about what to put in your own. Any other answer risks turning eth community into morality police. And I really like this. I think I, as a validator should get to freely choose what transactions to put into a block, so long as I choose the most recent block to put in.
00:52:50.914 - 00:53:50.038, Speaker B: Like say, for example, I am a religious person and it is, according to my religion, morally wrong for me to include certain transactions of a certain type into the Ethereum blockchain. I feel like I should be able to be included by the Ethereum protocol, and I should feel free to choose whatever transactions I want to include into the Ethereum protocol. I should not be able to dictate what other people put into the Ethereum protocol, so I feel like I should be able to pick and choose, and that is called that censorship. But so long as there's not one uniform version of censorship and we are all picking and choosing our own particular flavor of how we want to do our own particular censoring, if you open that up to 10,000 validators, there's no canonical version of like we are doing this, or we have these values, everyone's transactions ultimately get in, while we also don't censor people's ability to express themselves. That's my take here.
00:53:50.124 - 00:54:36.914, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that makes sense. I think some people are worried, though, David, about this being sort of a slippery slope, and are we making it socially acceptable to get part of the block building process be OFAC compliant? And some of the criticism has been lobbied at flashbots themselves. So let's remember how much good flashbots has done for Ethereum, like save the theorem's ass. I don't know how many times. Right? Just like we are in a much more censorship resistant place because of flashbots, and people are saying, well, now flashbots is undoing that because they are choosing to host a relayer that is censoring transactions. And why don't they turn it off? Truthfully, David, I don't know the answer to why doesn't flashbots turn off their relay or not. They might have reasons for this.
00:54:36.914 - 00:54:46.406, Speaker A: I have no idea why. I do think that flashbots and Phil, Diane, and others have literally spent their entire lives, their entire career, trying to.
00:54:46.428 - 00:54:47.794, Speaker B: Predict Phil, Diane, is a hero.
00:54:47.842 - 00:55:08.842, Speaker A: Yeah, he's a hero. And so a little bit of me, the back and forth on the social layer, because Phil put out a tweet and he was like, hey, I'm just sick of the vitriol. It's kind of toxic. I'm paraphrasing what Phil said. He said it far more eloquently. But to me, Phil Dyan, this is a little bit like Gotham city complaining about Batman.
00:55:08.906 - 00:55:09.482, Speaker B: About Batman.
00:55:09.546 - 00:55:22.766, Speaker A: Yeah, like flashbots and Batman has been protecting Gotham for a pretty long time. There are sometimes you don't understand Batman's motives. There are sometimes, like, Batman screws things up and actually should be criticized.
00:55:22.958 - 00:55:24.402, Speaker B: Cause a car crash, sure.
00:55:24.456 - 00:55:49.002, Speaker A: Or like maybe he actually genuinely screwed up and we should definitely hold them accountable for. But like, also, at the same time, Batman's a good actor. It's like doing it for God. And I don't know, there's an element of that where I feel like we as a community also should have extend some grace to the builders actually trying to protect against this. So these are my takes. And long run, David, on long run.
00:55:49.056 - 00:55:50.134, Speaker B: It is a nothing burden.
00:55:50.182 - 00:56:15.506, Speaker A: I 100% agree. I think we are going to have a censorship resistant. But if you want to make your own call on that megless listener, first listen to Justin Drake on uncensored Ethereum in order to have why we made that podcast. We made it, and we made it before all of this. Because, anyway, that's what I think you should do. David, what do we got coming up next?
00:56:15.688 - 00:56:45.198, Speaker B: Coming up next, we have a new announcement out of flashbots called something called Suave, which we have some details on. It was an announcement that I actually had to go ping Hazu, like Hey Hazu, can you give me the details for this? And he was like, no announcement's coming soon. But then he followed up with some details. So we got those details coming soon. The European Union preparing to ban mining what's going on over there and a critical vulnerability founding Cosmos IBC. We'll cover all those details and more. But first a moment to talk about some of these fantastic sponsors that make this show possible.
00:56:45.198 - 00:57:29.974, Speaker B: The reality today is that five corporations control the entire world of social media. They own our names, they restrict our content, they monitor our every move and their time is up. Thanks to our sponsor, Diesel. Diesel is a layer one blockchain built from the ground up to decentralize and scale social networks. With DSO, you can own your own identity, content and social graph and take it with you across hundreds of applications already built on the censorship resistant DSO blockchain. DSO storage advantages make it finally possible to build infinite state applications that can efficiently store and index large amounts of content and data fully on chain. DSO also offers multiple crypto native monetization primitives for developers and creators, including social nfts, social dows, social tokens and social tipping.
00:57:29.974 - 00:58:08.434, Speaker B: So in order to experience the social layer of web3, go to diesel.com and claim your username. That's deso.com. If you've been listening to bankless, you know that we're fans of the modular blockchain thesis, the idea that blockchains will separate execution from data availability and consensus, allowing all three to become the best versions of themselves. And fuel has built the fastest modular execution layer in the industry. By supporting parallel transaction execution, fuel unlocks significantly faster throughput for the web3 world. Fuel also goes beyond the limitations of the EVM with its own fuel VM, which is more efficient and optimized, opening up the design space for developers.
00:58:08.434 - 00:58:55.782, Speaker B: And lastly, Fuel brings a powerful developer experience with its own domain specific language sway and a supportive tool chain called fork. With fuel, you can have the benefits of smart contract languages like validity while adopting the improvements made by the rust tooling ecosystem, letting the fuel development environment go beyond the limitations of the EVM. If you want to learn more, there's a link in the show notes to see how you can get involved with the fuel network. Flashbots reveals new version of its key Ethereum software, reads the Coindesk headline. Development of Suave as the project is codenamed has been going on for over a year now so this has been something that Flashbots has had, I guess, like in their back pocket, ready to deploy, and they're coming out with details now. And so this is what I went to Hazu. I was like, hazu, can you help me interpret this and what's going on? And he said, details still coming out soon.
00:58:55.782 - 00:59:09.142, Speaker B: But conceptually, he says you can think of suave as the end game of the flashbot stack. An auction, an encrypted mempool, and a block builder. It sounds like a bunch of censorship resistant tools.
00:59:09.206 - 00:59:11.420, Speaker A: Encrypted mempool sounds real good.
00:59:11.870 - 00:59:44.966, Speaker B: I like that. Sounds awesome. As a user, you'll be able to trade on Ethereum through suave, and any meV that you create will be captured for you as a searcher, you will get the perfect environment to trade, including across different chains. And as a roll up, you can connect to swap to get the benefits of encrypted mev aware trading for your users, unlocking mev auctions for your stakers, and all in a progressively decentralizing way. So this is why I think people have been like, flashbots, stop censoring. What are you doing? What are you doing?
00:59:45.148 - 00:59:48.070, Speaker A: Don't patronize their voice, David.
00:59:48.570 - 01:00:10.174, Speaker B: And then flashbots, like, maybe they don't say anything, but that's because they have this swab thing which answers all of the criticisms and claims, maybe not all of them, but is a decent job of fixing a lot of the stuff. And it's called swab, and it's coming out soon. And so this is coming out, and I think it's going to truly change the conversation of this whole Ethereum censorship thing.
01:00:10.212 - 01:00:43.446, Speaker A: I share that take to you. And yet also, I don't want to go on the other side of things and just say, ethereum community, just trust everyone. Stop caring about censorship so much. Right? At some level, it makes me incredibly bullish that we are getting such a reaction from the community to say, this is not okay. I mean, you go the other direction and go sign up for some of SBF's regulation, right? I don't want to do that either. So we've got to strike the right chord. And I don't know when in doubt.
01:00:43.446 - 01:01:00.560, Speaker A: To me, David, the best thing you can do is if you see a problem, grab a shovel, just help out, rather than be critical, help out anyway, that's not the form for Twitter. Twitter is all about talk. Not a lot of actual things get done.
01:01:00.930 - 01:01:09.522, Speaker B: What do we got anyways? Coming out of ZK sync? This is their secret sauce. They have released their secret sauce. There's a lot of people who thought.
01:01:09.576 - 01:01:11.266, Speaker A: It'S not mainnet yet though, right?
01:01:11.368 - 01:01:51.934, Speaker B: It's not mainnet. No. But the reason why Zksync is first to mainnet is because they have this crazy ZK prover thing that you can prove with a GPU. And this is the piece of the puzzle that really completes a ZKe EVM. And it's the secret sauce that Zksync has that has allowed them to go to main net while everyone else is still releasing their testnets. And so ZK sync tweets out today we are extremely excited to announce that we have successfully completed milestone three proof merging with the integration of validity proofs, which is like, if we're talking about an optimistic roll up, that would be a fraud proof. With the integration of validity proofs, ZKCing 2.0
01:01:51.934 - 01:01:55.662, Speaker B: is officially the world's first ever ZK EVM running on public test.
01:01:55.716 - 01:01:57.326, Speaker A: That's the hard thing, right? The validity proofs.
01:01:57.358 - 01:01:58.882, Speaker B: That's the hard thing. That's the thing.
01:01:58.936 - 01:01:59.202, Speaker A: Okay.
01:01:59.256 - 01:02:33.466, Speaker B: Yes. And there were many other teams. I remembered both people out of arbitrum and scroll last week who tweeted out without naming names, even though they were just basically talking about ZK sync. A ZKe EVM claims to going to mainnet next week, and by no means will it be a complete thing because there's still stuff missing. And while Zksync and many other L2 teams all still have much work to do, this was the thing that they thought wasn't present. And Zksync is saying that it's present. Now, I am not technically competent to be able to vet this myself.
01:02:33.466 - 01:02:44.270, Speaker B: I don't have any idea about how validity proof is created, but ZK sync is saying that they got the thing that everyone else says that they didn't. And so these are the L2 wars, and they are awesome.
01:02:44.340 - 01:02:53.886, Speaker A: I think this is part of the moment of truth. The other part of the moment of truth is October 20 eigth, once the main net ships. And we are what, as of the time that this is released? Probably seven days away.
01:02:54.068 - 01:02:54.966, Speaker B: Eight or nine days.
01:02:55.028 - 01:03:13.462, Speaker A: That eight now, seven tomorrow. Yeah, we'll get to see it soon. And pretty exciting. And just a reminder, David and I are advisors for Zksync. We're also investors. Incredibly bullish about ZKe EVM in general. You can always find all our disclosures information in the show notes.
01:03:13.462 - 01:03:25.550, Speaker A: As usual, guys, Uniswap is on eight chains. David, I lost track of how many chains Uniswap deployed to not just Ethereum main net, but eight. And its next one is going to be zksync.
01:03:26.370 - 01:03:43.454, Speaker B: ZK sync making moves. And so the community voted Usop V three will soon to be deployed on ZK sync. Uniswap's 8th chain. Sounds like a multi chain world if you ask me, Ryan. And it sounds like the multichain world that you and I were talking about while everyone else was talking about all the alt layer ones. So I'm just going to take a quick.
01:03:43.492 - 01:03:45.058, Speaker A: Well, what are the chains? What are the chains?
01:03:45.114 - 01:03:48.610, Speaker B: You know, they're all Ethereum evms.
01:03:48.690 - 01:03:48.886, Speaker A: No.
01:03:48.908 - 01:03:56.662, Speaker B: So there's not like arbitrum polygon, optimism. What's the avalzi ksync? Maybe?
01:03:56.716 - 01:04:01.846, Speaker A: They didn't do avalanche. They did all Ethereum aligned chains. Is that what you're.
01:04:02.028 - 01:04:03.320, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah.
01:04:04.110 - 01:04:11.994, Speaker A: By the way, I'm really excited about the episode that we're releasing coming up with Dan Elitzer about the app chain thesis. Yes, this ties very nicely into that super hot.
01:04:12.112 - 01:04:15.146, Speaker B: Yeah, just tease premium listeners. Probably going to get that pretty damn soon here.
01:04:15.168 - 01:04:16.366, Speaker A: Yeah, hopefully you guys will.
01:04:16.388 - 01:04:23.098, Speaker B: But we have so many podcasts in queue that it's actually going to come out for bankless premium subscribers probably like ten to 15 days before we actually release.
01:04:23.114 - 01:04:26.706, Speaker A: Is that a promise? That's a bankless premium promise David just made.
01:04:26.808 - 01:04:38.422, Speaker B: Bankless editors. They're like, damn it, David, how about this? This is pretty cool. Ryan, is it? Yes. Okay, so as somebody who came from a tokenized real estate product, this is actually pretty cool.
01:04:38.476 - 01:04:39.030, Speaker A: Read it first.
01:04:39.100 - 01:05:28.566, Speaker B: Digital real estate platform sells house as an NFT so you can buy a house on chain. And this is an article out of the Defiant. The way that this works is each home is titled as a limited liability company and is associated with a unique NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. This is how my old startup did it, except we did with ERC 20s instead of nfts and we also fractionalized it. The process here is that when there's a lender involved approves and funds the borrower's request on Tuller, the USDC homes platform uses the funds to purchase the LLC NFT. The NFT is transferred to a multi SIG wallet that serves as an escrow account until the buyer pays back the entire loan and accrued interest. So there is also a mortgage and loan application being going on here as well.
01:05:28.566 - 01:05:41.446, Speaker B: And this is coming out of this platform called Roofstock, which was just a normal tradfi business. I remember using Roofstock as the competitor to go after when we were using our leveraging blockchain when they weren't.
01:05:41.558 - 01:05:47.500, Speaker A: You talking about your previous startup that David used to work with was called Realt Realty. Yeah.
01:05:49.390 - 01:06:01.822, Speaker B: But Roofstock has made their own on chain marketplace. So they are making, I think that's on chain is the name on capital c, chain property marketplace. And so that is pretty damn cool.
01:06:01.876 - 01:06:04.900, Speaker A: Okay, can I take the counter to this?
01:06:06.150 - 01:06:07.246, Speaker B: I didn't know we were arguing.
01:06:07.278 - 01:06:18.482, Speaker A: Okay. Is it cool, though? Okay, so I have been promised real estate on chain forever. Okay. And it's never taken off.
01:06:18.536 - 01:06:20.274, Speaker B: It's been years. It's been a big five years.
01:06:20.312 - 01:06:27.686, Speaker A: And used to work at realty. So I've heard your previous thoughts on this. I know this is different because it's an NFT and it's cool. It seems like it's attached to kind.
01:06:27.708 - 01:06:35.082, Speaker B: Of like it's also different because it's a business that already existed that was doing democratizing access to real estate property.
01:06:35.136 - 01:06:53.600, Speaker A: Okay, I get that. But also, still, the house is off chain. Right. So all you're getting is kind of this global transaction verification of an off chain assets, like the real world asset on chain thing, that just also still hasn't really taken off very much yet.
01:06:54.130 - 01:07:03.826, Speaker B: Yes. Your take now is it's not crypto native, therefore, why should I be excited about it? Because it's still meat space legal regulation, kind of.
01:07:03.848 - 01:07:08.280, Speaker A: That's part of the take. And then also the other take is just like it's been five damn years.
01:07:08.730 - 01:07:12.662, Speaker B: Right? Okay. But the fact that roofstock is doing this is different.
01:07:12.716 - 01:07:12.934, Speaker A: Okay.
01:07:12.972 - 01:07:41.482, Speaker B: Because again, like I said, they're not a startup. They already are profitable as a company, probably, and they are now getting into blockchain stuff. And so you're totally right. And this is why tokenized real estate was also just fundamentally uninteresting to me in the first place was that it's not crypto native. I like things like ultrasound money or crypto punks. But tokenized real estate or off chain real estate is inherently not actually blockchain innovation. It's legal system innovation.
01:07:41.482 - 01:08:03.366, Speaker B: It's like lawyer innovation. It's lawyer heavy blockchain light. But we're seeing signs of this starting to actually roll. And so we'll see. And there are benefits of doing on chain stuff. There are literal just a bigger marketplace for on chain stuff. And just things are actually easier payments and escrow and all that stuff.
01:08:03.366 - 01:08:13.740, Speaker B: As somebody who recently bought a house and did the whole escrow process, I would have loved for that to have been a multi stake on chain I could totally see how that would have translated. So there are real efficiency improvements by using.
01:08:14.190 - 01:08:31.258, Speaker A: It's. Honestly, I've always thought it's only a matter of time. Right. It's just not going to be the first. It's kind of somewhere between crypto money that we have and being able to buy a coffee with Bitcoin. Right. It's like somewhere in between, kind of the spectrum of when it happens in our trajecTory.
01:08:31.258 - 01:08:32.650, Speaker A: But this is cool, DAvid.
01:08:32.730 - 01:08:35.614, Speaker B: All right, this is COoler. I think this is definitely COoler.
01:08:35.662 - 01:08:52.934, Speaker A: You think it's COoler? I think it's Way COoler. This is an example of stuff that went under the radar. Right? 2.5 million people just created crypto wallets using Reddit and no one noticed, including the redditors themselves, I'm pretty sure.
01:08:52.972 - 01:08:54.386, Speaker B: Not even them. Right? They didn't even notice.
01:08:54.418 - 01:09:27.586, Speaker A: Okay, so this is a story from TecHCrunCh. Redditors have created millions of crypto Wallets to buy NFT avatars. This is a tweet. During a panel at TechCrunch Disrupt, the Reddit chief product officer revealed that to date, Reddit's Vault Blockchain, which, by the way, is based on Polygon Technology, created over 3 million crypto Wallets to date. 3 million Crypto wallets, and they didn't even know that they were creating it. Most of these 2.5 million of them were created to purchase NFT avatars that could be sold as Profile Picks on the platform.
01:09:27.586 - 01:09:35.538, Speaker A: 40,000 of these things sold between 999 and 99, $99. And most of these sales are, I.
01:09:35.544 - 01:10:23.806, Speaker B: Want, I want to emphasize that 40,000 nfts were sold at various price ranges from ten to $100 and they sold out. And remember, I remember talking about this a few weeks ago where Reddit was going to do this and somebody made the comment how they never used the word NFT, they just used digital Collectible and they sold it with a credit card. So not nfts that are actually, nfts were sold with credit cards and 30 artists released 40,000 avatars and they all sold out. And so what's the lesson here? Nfts. Don't call them nfts, don't make them use crypto and just charge them credit cards. And that worked. And so there's now perhaps like millions of people who don't know that they just bought an NFT on a blockchain.
01:10:23.838 - 01:10:26.574, Speaker A: And that they opened a real crypto wallet.
01:10:26.702 - 01:10:27.186, Speaker B: Yes.
01:10:27.288 - 01:10:30.438, Speaker A: They don't know that either. That's how seamless users who purchased one.
01:10:30.444 - 01:10:46.970, Speaker B: Of the limited edition pictures, got licensing rights to use it on and off Reddit as an avatar and could mix and match their avatars. Look, using a built in avatar builder tool. That is cool. And this has always been the bullcase for Ethereum is that it finds its way into all corners of the Internet and you don't actually notice that it's there.
01:10:47.040 - 01:11:04.674, Speaker A: I mean, just to benchmark this. Okay, so Reddit maybe just onboarded 3 million people to crypto wallets. Okay. OpenC has about a million active wallets as of last January. They had that metamask does about 30 million users. So, bam, 2.5 million users, just like that.
01:11:04.674 - 01:11:08.820, Speaker A: That's how quickly social media can scale us. David, what's the story?
01:11:09.590 - 01:12:05.038, Speaker B: European Union countries must be ready to block crypto mining, says the European Commission members of the European Union. The EU is developing an energy efficient label for blockchains, basically approved or unapproved blockchains, as the distribution of gas supplies from Russia leaves some fearing high energy prices, blackouts and shortages. So there's a quote here. In case there is a need for load sheding in the electricity systems, the EU member states must be ready to stop crypto asset mining, the commission said. Load sheding is, of course, when energy companies deliberately switch off supply to certain set of users to avoid the entire grid toppling in the coming months to years. The commission intends to take various steps to boost digital energy services while ensuring an energy efficient sector, including an energy efficient label for blockchains. I feel like, Ryan, I called this when we saw the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.
01:12:05.038 - 01:12:27.866, Speaker B: We saw the coming energy squeeze as we are going into the winter. And then Ethereum went proof of stake. And right around the time where energy prices start to go through the roof in Europe, and now people, the European Union says we're going to have to stop crypto mining, which is basically at this point, Ryan, just bitcoin mining because energy is in short supply. I feel like I called.
01:12:27.968 - 01:12:40.160, Speaker A: It's unfortunately for bitcoin proof of work too. It's not just the fact that they are stopped, like they want to stop it because of the energy waste narrative, it's the fact that they can stop it.
01:12:41.650 - 01:12:47.058, Speaker B: And it's also not just the narrative. They need the energy to power people's homes that bitcoin is sucking up.
01:12:47.144 - 01:12:59.526, Speaker A: Right. That is the fact on the ground, too. I think it's a major problem for proof of work moving forward and certainly a regulatory burden for bitcoin. David, what's this? What happened with Cosmos last week?
01:12:59.708 - 01:13:26.302, Speaker B: Yeah, huge security vulnerability, at least it's allegedly huge. On October 13, Ethan Buckman, the co founder of the IBC ecosystem of Cosmos, says that a critical security vulnerability has been discovered that impacts all IBC enabled Cosmos chains for all versions of IBC, as in the whole thing. Buckman assured that steps have already been taken to ensure that all major public IBC enabled chains have been patched. Yeah, wow. The whole thing got.
01:13:26.436 - 01:13:28.494, Speaker A: Sounds really bad because IBC is.
01:13:28.532 - 01:13:29.440, Speaker B: Sounds really bad.
01:13:29.810 - 01:13:49.810, Speaker A: Something like this could take down the entire interchange. Yes. It's funny, this just came out after, but it's patched. It's patched, thank God. And they found it before anything really bad happened. But it's disconcerting when something like this is kind of so deep in the code. David BNY Mellon this is a bank, old school, traditional bank.
01:13:49.810 - 01:13:54.200, Speaker A: They just launched a digital asset custody platform. Is this a big deal?
01:13:54.650 - 01:14:22.910, Speaker B: Well, it's not only a very old bank, it's America's oldest bank, Ryan, 238 years old. Select clients will now be able to hold and transfer bitcoin and ether. So, quote from the article, while BNY is not the first bank to explore crypto, this is still big important news because NY Mellon reaches 20% of the world's investable assets. A remarkable 42 trillion in assets under custody and 1.8 trillion in assets under management. Those are big.
01:14:22.980 - 01:14:23.714, Speaker A: Shows you how.
01:14:23.832 - 01:14:35.838, Speaker B: Remember how the crypto industry is currently at zero point 95 trillion and BNY Mellon has 1.8 trillion in assets under bitcoin and ether. Bitcoin and ether.
01:14:35.854 - 01:14:53.754, Speaker A: It shows you how, I guess, saturated bitcoin and ether have become among mainstream finance as well. We got a lot more work to do with DeFi, but bitcoin and ether as assets are there getting into releases. DyDx just released an option for fiat onboarding. Is that what this looks like?
01:14:53.952 - 01:15:26.642, Speaker B: Credit card deposit? So, yeah, you can now fund your DyDX account with a credit card. And my only take here is that the current Ethereum ecosystem, or crypto ecosystem has like, I don't know, 5678, 910, I don't know, ten on ramps of fiat. But the bull case for Ethereum is that it goes to infinity because all of the apps on all the chains all have their own native onboarding, whether if they need it. And that's what we're seeing here, is that just DyDX is an application. It's going to be its own chain. It has its own native onboarding. So every single endpoint of Ethereum can produce its own.
01:15:26.696 - 01:15:39.606, Speaker A: I think so. I think what you're saying if you want to get money into deFi, fiat into deFi, you have to take a step. And that step is usually in the form of like, your bank to crypto exchange, like a coinbase or Gemini to defi, right? It's like a three step hop.
01:15:39.638 - 01:15:43.254, Speaker B: This goes direct from bank to defi, bank to defi.
01:15:43.302 - 01:15:46.806, Speaker A: Very nice. How about this? What's op craft?
01:15:46.998 - 01:16:32.954, Speaker B: Op craft is an autonomous world, a fully on chain virtual space. Kind of like Minecraft? Definitely like Minecraft, where the entire world, every aspect, every river, blade of grass, every patch of snow on the mountains exists on chain. And every single action in the world happens as an Ethereum transaction. So this is built using what? Optimism? Released at a little bit before Devcon, which is the op stack. And so the op stack is this modular L2 stack. I think it's going to be the future of L2s, because just like how Ethereum layer one has going from monolithic to modular, so are Ethereum L2s, except what op craft has done is they've popped out the Ethereum VM and they popped in Minecraft, which is crazy. Why would you do this? I don't know.
01:16:32.954 - 01:16:40.374, Speaker B: But now we have a verifiable state machine of minecraft that now exists as part of the op stack.
01:16:40.422 - 01:17:00.926, Speaker A: This is really cool. So there's a link in there, by the way, where you can play op craft if you want to try that out. David, on the raises this week, the most notable one, I think, was this one from Chainsafe. Chainsafe is excited to announce that they raised $18.75 million as a series a. The reason that's notable is chainsafe. What do they do, David?
01:17:01.118 - 01:17:14.866, Speaker B: They make clients. They make three main clients. They make Lodestar for Ethereum. They make a client for polka dot. They also make a client for Filecoin. So cool. We like it when our clients get money because this entire industry is built on clients.
01:17:14.866 - 01:17:16.582, Speaker B: So that's that. Congrats to the Chainsafe team.
01:17:16.636 - 01:17:35.366, Speaker A: This reminds me of the episode that we did early in the week with Arbitrum's purchase of prismatic and the Prism team, the major Ethereum client. Of course, you can catch that in the RSS feed somewhere. It's also with a raise. Time to remind you that we have a job, sport. It's live. Crypto is hiring. And what should people do, David?
01:17:35.478 - 01:17:38.074, Speaker B: They should get a job. Ryan, get a job in crypto.
01:17:38.122 - 01:17:49.918, Speaker A: Do you know, I saw some tweets back, like, hey, I did it, Ryan. David, I got a job in crypto. I see that every week. Yeah, they're my favorite tweets. If you do get a job in crypto, make sure you shout out because congrats to you. And also you deserve.
01:17:49.934 - 01:17:51.922, Speaker B: Welcome to the world of web3.
01:17:51.976 - 01:18:01.622, Speaker A: I'm going to read a few jobs for you guys, as I usually do. Uniswap Labs hiring a director of product management platform non technical is that.
01:18:01.676 - 01:18:02.438, Speaker B: I don't really know.
01:18:02.524 - 01:18:16.054, Speaker A: Question mark. I think non technical developer relations, lead developer relations. David, I think that's non technical. You need to know a little bit, but I think I'm going to say that's non technical. Senior front end engineer that's technical.
01:18:16.102 - 01:18:16.534, Speaker B: That's technical.
01:18:16.582 - 01:18:48.034, Speaker A: Senior backend engineer trading platform technical head of security at optimism that's technical. Senior infrastructure engineer DevOps we got roles from Rabbit Hole, coinshift, ribbon Capital and on. If you want access to all of these jobs, go to bankless, palette.com, slash jobs and log in and find out more. Alright guys, coming up we've got some takes from Twitter, of course, bitcoin and ETH. What were they worth five years ago compared to now? And what does that tell us about the future? Of course. As always, make sure you like and subscribe if you're enjoying this episode so far.
01:18:48.034 - 01:18:51.942, Speaker A: We'll be right back, but before we do, we want to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.

Robert Leshner tweets out think of all that has happened in crypto and globally since January of 2018. The reason why he's saying January 2018, because that was the top of the 2017 Ico mania. It was December to January. And then he goes, well, keep thinking about it. Bitcoin and ether are both worth less than they were five years ago. It's also an anniversary of the top of 2017 tweet.
01:21:05.358 - 01:21:14.194, Speaker B: That's basically also what's going on here. But Robert Lescher says bitcoin and ether are worth less than they were five years ago. How's that make you feel?
01:21:14.232 - 01:21:25.074, Speaker A: Ryan? Confused. Yeah, Lesnar is really tripping me out. Okay, Robert, I'm thinking about it. He says, keep thinking about it. I'm thinking about it. Is that bullish? I think it's bearish.
01:21:25.202 - 01:21:25.922, Speaker B: It's bullish.
01:21:25.986 - 01:21:40.442, Speaker A: Well, we always went in doubt, always be bullish. I think it's bullish. I think it means, well, probably it was very bearish if you were in January 2018 mean that there's a lot of price and not a lot.
01:21:40.496 - 01:21:44.206, Speaker B: Here it was the next five years of growth priced in.
01:21:44.308 - 01:21:55.790, Speaker A: It's already priced in. Right. But now the question is, are the next five years of growth priced in with an eth at what, 2000 or 1200, something that we read at the top of that episode?
01:21:56.450 - 01:21:58.514, Speaker B: I'm going to go with no, it's not priced in.
01:21:58.552 - 01:22:01.794, Speaker A: I'm going to go with hell no, it's priced in. Can't be priced in.
01:22:01.912 - 01:22:07.650, Speaker B: I don't think there's there ever been a moment where the full potential of ethereum has been priced in except at the top.
01:22:07.720 - 01:22:22.682, Speaker A: Well, yes, and we won't know, of course, until we see the full potential of Ethereum, what the full price should be. But, yeah, I don't know. I think that's what he's probably saying. Although you could interpret this the other way and be enough, I guess. Nothing's happened. I think he's saying a lot's happened in the last five years.
01:22:22.816 - 01:22:23.754, Speaker B: Yes, I'm pretty sure.
01:22:23.792 - 01:22:32.522, Speaker A: All right, what's this? David Hoffman is saying bankless is bigger than just bankless hq. And here you are with a photo of someone in a bankless tea, but it looks a little different. What's this? Bankless tea?
01:22:32.576 - 01:22:37.840, Speaker B: Yeah, this is the bankless Brazil guys, which Ryan. I've signed us up for a podcast with them next week. Oh, cool.
01:22:38.210 - 01:22:39.790, Speaker A: Do I need to know Portuguese?
01:22:40.290 - 01:22:42.542, Speaker B: No, I don't know Portuguese either.
01:22:42.596 - 01:22:43.006, Speaker A: Okay.
01:22:43.108 - 01:22:51.300, Speaker B: But, yeah, I mean, it's just cool to see all the different flavors of bankless teas that are out and about. Devcon. And so shout out to the bankless Brazil team, who just keeps on chugging along.
01:22:51.910 - 01:23:01.318, Speaker A: Their podcast is great. It's in my feed. I listen to it just because. But I don't understand Portuguese. But it's just fantastic. And these guys are crushing it. Social media as well.
01:23:01.318 - 01:23:03.734, Speaker A: Here's a tweet from Tom Emmer. Do you want to read this one?
01:23:03.852 - 01:23:17.206, Speaker B: Yeah. Tom Emmer. Representative Tom Emmer says decentralization is the point. I'm pretty sure this is subtweeting SBF. If we sacrifice Defi for legislation, we're throwing away the opportunity. Yes. Nice job, Tom Emmer.
01:23:17.238 - 01:23:19.226, Speaker A: David, it's a politician saying this.
01:23:19.328 - 01:23:20.230, Speaker B: Yeah, that's cool.
01:23:20.320 - 01:23:28.320, Speaker A: It's incredible. That's amazing. One other tweet. This is the classic regulatory capture attack.
01:23:29.170 - 01:23:30.042, Speaker B: Reads the tweet.
01:23:30.106 - 01:23:43.890, Speaker A: Reads the tweet. Here's what you do. If you want to classically everyone, write down your notes. Capture. Okay, this is Dr. Dick. This was a tweet put out over the summer, but I think it's resurfaced, and you might see why.
01:23:43.890 - 01:23:53.186, Speaker A: So if you want to capture an industry, here's what you do. Number one, you enter a nascent, unregulated industry, and then you be early, you be lucky, you be aggressive, you make hay while the sun shines.
01:23:53.298 - 01:23:55.622, Speaker B: Then, okay, so you build a business and you make a lot of money.
01:23:55.676 - 01:24:03.130, Speaker A: Yes. Step one. Step two, you get away with whatever you can. You push it right up to the point where you're told to stop. You find the boundaries. Step.
01:24:03.200 - 01:24:07.882, Speaker B: Okay, so you liquidate your own customers, you shill a bunch of tokens, and you make more money.
01:24:07.936 - 01:24:19.402, Speaker A: Check. Check. Number three, you've made your billions. Well done. Got your market share. Now it's time to shut the door behind you. You spend a good chunk of your spoils on compliance in quotes.
01:24:19.402 - 01:24:40.770, Speaker A: The goal now is to be the market leader at the regulations you know are coming. Lawyer up to the max. Starts to sound like someone I know. Number four, you know they're coming because it's you that's lobbying for them. This industry needs, quote, cleaning up for the good of the customer. Even better if you think a think of the children. Even better if you can find a think of the children narrative.
01:24:40.770 - 01:24:43.026, Speaker A: You're the champion of making this industry.
01:24:43.218 - 01:24:49.206, Speaker B: Ah, so, like, you make a bunch of blog posts that are like, hey, we need to protect consumers. And you talk about that a lot.
01:24:49.228 - 01:25:07.226, Speaker A: You spend time in Washington. You're the adult in the room. You know how to solve this. You get where they're coming from, you get where crypto is coming from, or whatever industry you're trying to conquer. Number five, this gets the regulators on your side because you're the actor most progressive in the industry on compliance. They have to let you pass because you're top of the pile. They can't be seen destroying the industry.
01:25:07.226 - 01:25:10.062, Speaker A: So they need a good guy to get behind. Kind of a fall guy.
01:25:10.116 - 01:25:10.542, Speaker B: Good guy.
01:25:10.596 - 01:25:20.846, Speaker A: Hey, if this person says it's okay, it must be okay, right? He's crypto and you're crypto. Why don't you like it? Number six, every other newcomer to the space hasn't made enough money yet to be able to afford the new compliance regime.
01:25:20.958 - 01:25:22.850, Speaker B: Yeah, this is regulatory arbitrage, okay?
01:25:22.920 - 01:25:46.554, Speaker A: You're shutting them out. And in any case, you've hired all the people that know how to impact the rules and implement them. In fact, you've made the rules, so you know them better than anyone. Number seven, here's what happens next. Maybe we're at number seven. Regulations come in, everyone dies. Apart from you and the handful of big players on your tail or the ones willing to play the outlaw regulatory arbitrage game.
01:25:46.554 - 01:26:05.454, Speaker A: So what do you do now? Now, your job is to layer on the bureaucracy. Lobby for the regulations to fit the way you're already doing it. If you have a competitor that's doing it, radically different, lobby to make it illegal. Congratulations, you've captured the industry. Now it's time for Ultraman monopoly. Own it all. Crush your competitors.
01:26:05.454 - 01:26:08.260, Speaker A: Make your shareholders happy. The end.
01:26:09.030 - 01:26:11.022, Speaker B: I hate this movie. This movie sucks.
01:26:11.086 - 01:26:12.098, Speaker A: Seen this movie before?
01:26:12.184 - 01:26:13.282, Speaker B: I've seen this movie before.
01:26:13.336 - 01:26:18.802, Speaker A: The banking industry, so many industries. It's social media. It's so many industries that achieve every industry.
01:26:18.946 - 01:26:40.646, Speaker B: And this is why Ethereum as a protocol and the all core devs call puts such a strong emphasis on credible neutrality. Because the one thing that we are trying to do in Ethereum is make systems that are capture resistant. And this tweet thread starts with the classic regulatory capture attack. When was this tweet thread written?
01:26:40.838 - 01:26:42.480, Speaker A: I can go the date on this.
01:26:43.090 - 01:26:45.838, Speaker B: July 3, 2022. Months ago.
01:26:45.924 - 01:26:46.462, Speaker A: Months ago.
01:26:46.516 - 01:26:46.894, Speaker B: Months ago.
01:26:46.932 - 01:27:08.978, Speaker A: Months ago. And we don't have to name names, obviously, but this is what we should be wary of in the industry. And particularly, I think the threat could be coming from crypto bankers in the industry, crypto banks specifically. It could be coming from Defi at another stage, maybe Defi protocols, but not right now. Maybe. All right, David, what are you excited about this week? What's making you bullish?
01:27:09.154 - 01:27:35.502, Speaker B: I am bullish on college kids. Ryan. What? On Monday, I went and gave a talk to the Princeton blockchain club about twelve kids. Twelve Princeton kids who are all super into crypto. A bunch of juniors, a few freshmen, a couple of seniors. And the questions they asked were really, really smart. And if you are asking smart questions about crypto, you're already like half of the way through it.
01:27:35.556 - 01:27:37.546, Speaker A: I'm told Princeton kids are pretty smart.
01:27:37.658 - 01:27:48.446, Speaker B: They are pretty smart. Allegedly, yes. And then also tomorrow on Friday, I'm going to go and teach a computer science class about Ethereum. David, doing computer science.
01:27:48.478 - 01:27:49.822, Speaker A: They're in trouble. Something's in trouble.
01:27:49.886 - 01:28:06.038, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. I'm going to do my classic. Ethereum is a piece of software that's actually meant to produce culture because somebody else can teach them computer science way better than I can. But I'm going to talk about how cold influences culture, applications of.
01:28:06.124 - 01:28:10.158, Speaker A: And you'll be wearing SpongeBob sweater in order to perhaps show them culture.
01:28:10.194 - 01:28:31.850, Speaker B: Exactly. Anyways, I'm just like stoked on it because there's more and more surface area for college kids, universities, both grad and undergrad. There's graduate students in the NYU class to get exposure to crypto, and the professor of this class I actually met at. And so professors are in the Ethereum community going back to their university to teach their kids about crypto.
01:28:31.930 - 01:28:39.506, Speaker A: What do you think colleges and universities? Do you think any students are listening to bankless? You think we get the Gen Z? Yeah.
01:28:39.528 - 01:28:46.974, Speaker B: So the professor, I asked her how much of bankless is in, what do you call it? Curriculum.
01:28:47.022 - 01:28:47.330, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:28:47.400 - 01:28:48.902, Speaker B: And she was like, a lot.
01:28:48.956 - 01:28:51.794, Speaker A: A lot of really, like, articles, episodes.
01:28:51.842 - 01:28:59.910, Speaker B: Yes. And Evan McMullen has also taught, guest lectured for classes around New York, and she says she just regurgitates bankless episodes.
01:29:00.330 - 01:29:02.266, Speaker A: Nice. Well, I've always wanted, and that's just.
01:29:02.288 - 01:29:03.002, Speaker B: The ones we know about.
01:29:03.056 - 01:29:04.902, Speaker A: I've always wanted to be a professor, personally.
01:29:04.966 - 01:29:06.774, Speaker B: I've also always wanted to be a professor.
01:29:06.822 - 01:29:10.106, Speaker A: Well, maybe. Are we being professors right now?
01:29:10.128 - 01:29:13.190, Speaker B: Is this how you do pseudo Professors podcast?
01:29:13.270 - 01:29:16.446, Speaker A: I both want to, and I really, really don't want to. Do you know what I mean?
01:29:16.548 - 01:29:18.654, Speaker B: Yeah, I want a guest lecture. I don't want to teach.
01:29:18.772 - 01:29:20.954, Speaker A: Well, you live in the dream, man. That's awesome, dude.
01:29:21.082 - 01:29:22.442, Speaker B: Yeah. What are you bullish on, Ryan?
01:29:22.506 - 01:29:43.334, Speaker A: I am bullish that this bear market doesn't feel like a bear market. What I'll say is it just feels different. I've said this before, but look, 2018, 2019, if you weren't there, it was utter despair. Ethereum was dead. Bitcoin was maybe kind of alive. It was on life support. But DFI had zero product market fit.
01:29:43.532 - 01:29:45.682, Speaker B: It was the great depression of crypto.
01:29:45.826 - 01:29:56.730, Speaker A: It was very bleak. It was very sad. This does not feel like that at all. Prices are down, but there's no depression. I mean, the builders are building. Nothing has stopped. That.
01:29:56.730 - 01:30:02.122, Speaker A: Nothing has stopped. In fact, I think the velocity has increased because there's less. Yes. And there's more.
01:30:02.256 - 01:30:03.538, Speaker B: Good. Building is off the charts.
01:30:03.574 - 01:30:25.074, Speaker A: There's also better talent entering the space. And so we actually slowed down our building. I think, during the last bear market, we didn't even know what to build. And this time, I see more firm like resolution rather than despair. This is the bear market, but it's a bear market that's different than the last one. This one bear market. We already have product market fit.
01:30:25.074 - 01:30:36.070, Speaker A: And you know what? I think this makes it, David, it's the most obvious bear market ever, because, you know, we're coming out the other side. The most obvious time to buy is what?
01:30:36.220 - 01:30:40.042, Speaker B: Okay, like, yes, obvious bear market. I don't think anyone was contesting that's a bear market.
01:30:40.096 - 01:30:42.730, Speaker A: Like the most obvious bear market.
01:30:42.800 - 01:30:47.146, Speaker B: Implying that we're actually going to go and end the bear market. Exactly.
01:30:47.248 - 01:31:10.498, Speaker A: A bear market before the bull market is what I mean. It's just only a matter of time. And I didn't honestly feel so last time, David, I was like, we might not make. Like this story might not end well. This is a completely different feeling. Which means back to maybe Leschner's tweet, right? It's like, this is the price of eth now. It's the price that was five years ago.
01:31:10.498 - 01:31:29.014, Speaker A: And look at the five years of building and look at all of the talent that is continuing to build in the space and has entered the space in order to build. Tell me you're bullish on that. I'm bearish on that. I dare you to be bearish on that. So it's going to be fine. And I think that's the difference between this one and the last.
01:31:29.212 - 01:31:29.670, Speaker B: Nice.
01:31:29.740 - 01:31:35.718, Speaker A: Getting me bullish, getting you excited, getting the people excited at the end of the podcast. All right, what's the meme of the week? Is that going to get a mixed.
01:31:35.734 - 01:32:01.026, Speaker B: Meme of the week? Let's do it. Anyone else getting deja vu? Says Nick White of Celestia. Monolithic layer ones are like iPhones made to be obsolete in a couple of years. So you buy a new one. And here's the meme of this guy receiving a shirt as a present. And it's the same exact shirt he already is wearing. And he's wearing that.
01:32:01.026 - 01:32:02.434, Speaker B: What's the one below? Solana again?
01:32:02.552 - 01:32:03.214, Speaker A: Cardano.
01:32:03.262 - 01:32:13.734, Speaker B: Cardano. Cardano. I don't know why Cardano is there actually definity avalanche. And now he's holding Aptos and he goes, oh, my God. Thanks. I can't wait to try out my new monolithic layer one. I do like the evolution of, like, monolithic layer ones.
01:32:13.734 - 01:32:19.026, Speaker B: That's just like a shinier phone, a shinier iPhone. Yeah, I think that's a good metaphor.
01:32:19.058 - 01:32:25.978, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. I love this guy's face, too. He just, like, got the same gift. We keep receiving this gift every single.
01:32:26.064 - 01:32:28.154, Speaker B: Well, he clearly loves it. He's wearing it.
01:32:28.192 - 01:32:40.874, Speaker A: Totally. Just put another one in the closet. It's a benefit, I guess. Maybe you could do that with layer ones, too. All right, guys, this has been the roll up. We appreciate you hanging with us, as always. Got to remind you of this very important advice.
01:32:40.874 - 01:32:48.226, Speaker A: That is not financial advice. Risk and disclaimers. ETH is risky. Bitcoin is risky. So is Defi. So is all crypto. You could lose what you put in.
01:32:48.226 - 01:32:54.338, Speaker A: But we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone. But we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
01:32:54.424 - 01:33:19.882, Speaker C: But this guy right here, Ryan Sean Adams, I don't know who the f you are, because you're not important, but here he says, please, dear Lord. And any lawmakers or adults reading this tweet, just know bitboy doesn't represent us either. Talk to Jay Stravinsky. Talk to Miller Cwl. Talk to coin center. You know what? We are tired of people that look like this guy trying to run stuff. I don't represent the people.
01:33:19.882 - 01:33:39.758, Speaker C: The fuck I don't. I'm the one who does. It's me. I'm the one out here putting the work in behind the scenes, trying to save crypto, while these devils, Sam Bankman, freed Brian Armstrong, they're trying to permanently ruin it. This is not about money for me. I hope you guys understand this. I am here fighting for you.
01:33:39.758 - 01:33:59.940, Speaker C: This guy with these freaking glasses on, this douchebag is out here trying to tell you that only the suits know what to do. Only the suits. Only the people who have all the money. They're the ones who can determine what happens. No, our bill is for the people, and you're going to find this out. We've got the funding for it, and it's coming out.
