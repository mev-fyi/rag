00:00:00.090 - 00:00:11.242, Speaker A: Oh, my God. So much to discuss. Largest exploit ever. Okay, this might be a 300 million dollar exploit, and it happened on a bridge. The bridge hack.
00:00:11.306 - 00:00:11.786, Speaker B: Bridge hack.
00:00:11.818 - 00:00:15.646, Speaker A: Yeah. $300 million. Is this 300 million? I heard 250 to 300.
00:00:15.668 - 00:00:18.862, Speaker B: Somewhere between 250 and 300, you know, depending on the price, a lot.
00:00:18.916 - 00:00:24.094, Speaker A: Okay. I said 200 million this, but it was more. And this.
00:00:24.132 - 00:00:24.334, Speaker B: I.
00:00:24.372 - 00:00:25.366, Speaker A: Maybe we'll start kind of.
00:00:25.388 - 00:00:31.222, Speaker B: First off, that's big. That's very, very big. That's a big number. That is the second biggest DeFi exploit of all time.
00:00:31.356 - 00:00:42.202, Speaker A: Yes, it is. Yes. Millions. When you get in the hundreds of millions, that's very big territory. It's a nice bank heist, man. Bank heists keep getting bigger. I'll start here.
00:00:42.202 - 00:01:10.594, Speaker A: It's kind of a prediction that I feel like bankless has made, and not happy about this prediction, but it felt like an inevitability in 2022. This is a tweet that I put out earlier in January. Sad prediction. There will be some monster bridge hacks in 2022 that will make people question their multilayer one chain thesis. I feel like that's a little bit what happened. Right. Multichain, multi bridge, really fast.
00:01:10.594 - 00:01:31.642, Speaker A: It did okay. And then I probably doubled down on that prediction, which is, again, sad. Okay. Sadly, this exploit is just the start, and I feel like that's the case, too. Although hopefully everyone with bridges is double checking their code right now to make sure this thing doesn't happen. But we'll start there. Tell us, actually what happened.
00:01:31.642 - 00:01:36.394, Speaker A: This thing is called wormhole on Solana, I believe. Give us the scoop here, David. Yeah.
00:01:36.432 - 00:02:50.674, Speaker B: So everyone's attention got raised when Sam Z. Sun, who's a famous white hat hacker who can almost fix any exploit before everyone knows about it, tweeted out that wormhole is not having a good time. And it turns out by the time Sam paid attention to it, it had already happened. So the wormhole network, which is a ethereum to Solana Bridge that lets you wrap up your ether on ethereum, put that ether into a smart contract on Ethereum, and then that smart contract pings another smart contract on Solana to tell the Solana chain that some ether just got deposited into it, and they can mint new ether, fake ether wrapped ether, Solana ether on the Solana chain. And the reason why that will have value is because you can go back and forth, and that's how bridges work. What happened, allegedly, from what we are understanding, from all the people that know how to code and uncover these things, is that the smart contract on the Solana side had an exploit that allowed the exploiter to mint a bunch of Solana ether, a bunch of ious for ether, on the Ethereum chain. And so they just minted new ones, kind of in the same way that Federal reserve prints new money.
00:02:50.674 - 00:03:24.774, Speaker B: If you can get a hold of the money printer, you can print a bunch of new monies. But that doesn't mean that there's actually more ether backing it on the Ethereum chain. So the exploiter minted a bunch of Solana ether and then sent that Solana ether back through the bridge so that they could take the ether on the Ethereum side out of the wormhole. Smart contract. And that came out to a tune of 120,000 wrapped ether. And then that 120,000 wrapped ether is now in the exploiter's wallet. And I don't know if they're actually watching it through tornado cash yet, but I would imagine that's just kind of the only way that they can get that value cleaned.
00:03:24.902 - 00:03:51.958, Speaker A: This happened as we're recording it. This happened, I don't know, 12 hours before we're recording this, maybe a bit more. So the story and what's happening is kind of still developing as we're doing it, but, yeah, exactly what you said. Right. So you've got these fake ious on Solana, and then the hacker just caches these ious for real ETH on the ethereum side of things. But this causes some downstream effects, doesn't it? What are the downstream effects? The cascade of effects when something like this happens.
00:03:52.044 - 00:04:34.126, Speaker B: Right. So ether is fantastic collateral, and so is used as collateral and liquidity inside of Solana defi. And so all of a sudden, the ether collateral in these defi applications, like providing liquidity to other tokens, becomes unbacked. And so it kind of goes from an IOU to ether to an IOU of nothing. And so all of a sudden, the value in these things just evaporates, right? Because it's like if somebody stole all the gold out of a bank that had issued IOUS against that gold, well, if there's no gold there, you can't issue any IOUs for it. Or the ious that you do have are worthless. And so it has cascading impacts on DeFi.
00:04:34.126 - 00:05:12.670, Speaker B: Liquidations happen because if value of the collateral goes to zero, then people need to get liquidated. But also, how can you liquidate anything if there's no actual value there? The IOUS aren't worth anything, and so it just messes up everything. It's a systemic risk to have all of this unbacked collateral in Solana defi. And so this is what Giorgio's Constantinopoulos from paradigm says. Domino effect of now uncollateralized loans against wormhole ETH is severely under mentioned. That was yesterday. This has been fixed, actually, as of, like, literally one or 2 hours before recording somebody.
00:05:12.670 - 00:05:30.886, Speaker B: We think jump capital has footed the bill. Footed the bill? They coughed up all the ether, and so now the wormhole bridge is actually whole again because we think jump capital coughed up.
00:05:30.908 - 00:05:31.762, Speaker A: Is it jump capital?
00:05:31.826 - 00:05:32.294, Speaker B: I think so.
00:05:32.332 - 00:05:34.050, Speaker A: That's what everyone's still developing.
00:05:34.130 - 00:05:46.140, Speaker B: That's unconfirmed, but that's kind of the only people that we can really consider to have this much money. $250,000,000, just like, okay, here, we'll make wormhole whole again. Absolutely crazy.
00:05:46.910 - 00:06:03.534, Speaker A: Yeah. Basically, we had all of these IOUs that were minted. This causes a cascade of problems everywhere. This wrapped ether on Salana and the Salana DFI ecosystem is used. Right. Because now all of these assets that you thought were backed by ETH are no longer backed. Right.
00:06:03.534 - 00:06:24.534, Speaker A: And so it's a lot of problem. All the while, wormhole is saying, hey, look, guys, we got this. They were tweeting out, we're finding a way to restore funds. In the background. They were negotiating with the hacker, I believe, and they sent messages to the hacker saying, hey, if you just return the funds, we'll give you $10 million. You'll be a white hat. Right?
00:06:24.572 - 00:06:27.922, Speaker B: You'll be helping us out for $10 million, bug bounty.
00:06:27.986 - 00:06:42.682, Speaker A: Yeah. And who knows? There's probably lots of other conversations that we're not privy to. Right. But now what's just developed, it seems like. And what you're saying, David, is wormhole is back up. They somehow procured the funds.
00:06:42.746 - 00:06:43.022, Speaker B: Amazing.
00:06:43.076 - 00:06:47.278, Speaker A: And you think this was from Jump Capital? Who funded this? Yeah.
00:06:47.284 - 00:07:19.254, Speaker B: So Jeff Garcia asked that question, where did the funds to refill the bridge come from? And so if you click on that tweet and scroll down, you'll see a lot of speculation that it was jump capital. Kyle Shamani Capital. Jump is covering because they believe in the future of crypto and what they're building. So jump capital, I think, maybe had some, like, maybe, were there investors in wormhole or something like that? Jump capital is a trading desk, I think, and they just print money from doing trading stuff. So they're very well capitalized, obviously, but, I mean, they could pay for this.
00:07:19.292 - 00:07:20.150, Speaker A: If they wanted to.
00:07:20.220 - 00:07:29.882, Speaker B: At the end of the day, $250,000,000 is nothing. I'm sorry. Even George. Soros will notice $250,000,000 missing from his treasury, I think.
00:07:29.936 - 00:07:55.758, Speaker A: Yeah, that's incredible. I guess. So what do we learn from this episode here? There's maybe some lessons that are starting to emerge. I feel like the first thing we're learning is that bridges are dangerous. Bridges are dangerous, and they're dangerous in two ways. They're dangerous in one. The smart contract code for a bridge can actually be hacked.
00:07:55.758 - 00:07:59.062, Speaker A: That's what happened here. There's a smart contract code hack which.
00:07:59.116 - 00:08:28.862, Speaker B: Happened on the Solana side, which Ryan is differentiating from the. The. You have the bridge that spans two endpoints, two structures, and the bridge can break and be broken in the middle, or the two structures on the end can also break, and those are the smart contracts on either side of the bridge. So the bridge was fine because even the exploiter was able to transfer assets across the bridge. It was the entryways of the bridge that got exploited here. And these are each individually weak points.
00:08:28.996 - 00:09:11.566, Speaker A: And we've seen hacks like this, not for a bridge, but like this in defi, many different, you know, the famous parody multisig hack. It's smart contract code that was basically hacked. So that's the first category. The other category that we haven't yet seen, but Vitalik has been talking about for a while, and particularly for the last month, is economic attacks. So this is like, you're sort of dependent on the multi Sig signers, or you're dependent on the security of the Solana chain or any side chain to actually secure this bridge. And that's another iceberg, I think, under the water a little bit that people aren't seeing. From my perspective, it's good that people are paying more attention to bridge security.
00:09:11.566 - 00:10:08.606, Speaker A: So there is, I guess, a sunny side at the other side of this. I think it's important to note that both layer ones like this bridge, layer ones like this, and L2 bridges can have the smart contract vulnerability, though they probably don't. Layer twos don't have the same economic attack surface area that these layer one bridges have. So I'm happy to see that bridge security is coming into focus. It seems like it's good that there's a happy ending where maybe a big capital provider like jump is reimbursing all funds. I do think that, look, this bridge was talked about as if it was safe and secure, and I think a lot of people thought it was safe and secure. And I think there is some troubling, I guess, market pressure for everyone to say their bridge is secure when it's really not.
00:10:08.606 - 00:10:22.930, Speaker A: And that is troubling. And I hope we see the lessons of security from this and we take those lessons and we apply them. We look at these bridges with a lot more scrutiny moving forward. What do you think the takeaways are? David?
00:10:23.830 - 00:10:50.478, Speaker B: The biggest thing I'm surprised about is I had no idea how much ether was on Salana via this wormhole. Like a quarter billion dollars is a lot. Over 100,000 units of ether is a lot. Reminder, there's 118,000,000 ether in existence. A lot of that's locked, a lot of that is lost. So maybe like ten to 15 million of that is actually lost somehow, somewhere. But over 100,000 ether is a lot.
00:10:50.478 - 00:11:17.874, Speaker B: That is not trivial. And that's what I'm surprised about. I'm surprised that a bridge in such a nascent part of bridging's story with crypto had that much ether wrapped up in his contracts. And also, whenever Solana goes down, we have Kyle Somani and Anatoli come out and say, a main net beta. Solana is in mainnet beta. We got ddos. It's going down.
00:11:17.874 - 00:11:39.660, Speaker B: I'm sorry, what kind of main net beta has a quarter billion dollars of value in it. We need to pick a lane, guys. Is this a beta or is this a live ecosystem? Because if people are getting liquidated, it's not really a beta. The whole Solana ecosystem is very fortunate. That jump has the means and the reason and the ability to actually cover the losses here.
00:11:40.270 - 00:12:14.040, Speaker A: Part of me wonder if we get the wrong lesson out of this as well. I'm glad that users are going to be made whole for this. I think that's a great thing and I'm happy individually. But I feel like it's a dangerous precedent for bridge users to expect that any hack or economic attack is going to get bailed out in the future. Because just because this ended with a happy ending doesn't mean the next one will. There's not necessarily a jump capital. Who's going to step in and reimburse everyone?
00:12:15.290 - 00:12:22.202, Speaker B: Especially when these bridges and L2s and everything decentralize? There's supposed to be no one there.
00:12:22.336 - 00:12:44.270, Speaker A: Exactly. So there's some brittleness in this structure that we're building, in particular in the bridging structure. I think we talked a lot about this with Rune Christensen on the episode that we did with him. So go check that out. That's somewhere in the archives as well. And yeah, bridges are going to be a main topic of discussion. This won't be the last hack that we see of 2022, sadly.
00:12:44.270 - 00:12:48.082, Speaker A: And, yeah, we're going to continue talking about it.
00:12:48.216 - 00:13:07.398, Speaker B: So what is this exploiter going to do with all the money? What does one do with two? What would you do with, hypothetically, what would you do? Well, okay, so they can't touch USDC. They can't touch USDT will get frozen because it'll get frozen. They can touch dai if they want.
00:13:07.484 - 00:13:10.922, Speaker A: You're going straight to ETH and then you're going to Tornado cash.
00:13:11.056 - 00:13:43.006, Speaker B: Yeah, right. But you can't just wash 100,000 units of ether through tornado cash. You can maybe do like a couple of hundred ETH a week, but you have to pull it out into different wallets. But then also, sure, you start to liquidate the trickle of ETH that you push through tornado cash. So, yeah, you exploit something for a quarter billion dollars, and then maybe over the course of one year, you can discreetly withdraw $1 million across, spreading it out and obfuscating.
00:13:43.038 - 00:13:44.354, Speaker A: And you just wait a long time.
00:13:44.392 - 00:13:50.294, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Just wait a long time. But what the hell do you do with the remaining $249,000,000?
00:13:50.412 - 00:13:56.774, Speaker A: Just keep it neat. You take out some loans, use it in DFI. I don't know. That's an option to do what you can't do.
00:13:56.972 - 00:13:58.200, Speaker B: It's stuck there.
00:13:58.810 - 00:14:10.154, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess it is. Although I think a lot more will be built. Like, you could just expect that there'll be more privacy preserving solutions in the future. More off ramps, this sort of thing.
00:14:10.272 - 00:14:22.240, Speaker B: Your hands and so you can get your money later. If they're inside of the United States, how are they going to tell the IRS that where they got their quarter billion dollars from?
00:14:24.450 - 00:14:34.894, Speaker A: It's going to be very difficult for them to exit. That's why if I am the hacker, I'd be pretty tempted to be like, oh, okay, yeah, no, just a prank, guys, look, I'm a white hat.
00:14:34.942 - 00:14:35.970, Speaker B: Just a prank.
00:14:36.550 - 00:14:38.386, Speaker A: I'm a white hat because they offered.
00:14:38.418 - 00:14:39.910, Speaker B: The exploiter $10 million.
00:14:39.980 - 00:14:49.900, Speaker A: I'll take the 10 million free and clear. Right. But although I do wonder, is that really free and clear, though? You hack something, can you just be like, yeah.
00:14:50.750 - 00:14:58.794, Speaker B: Can you remove yourself from all courts and liabilities just by just taking the $10 million bribe to give it all back?
00:14:58.912 - 00:15:11.082, Speaker A: Yeah. Or maybe you're supposed to play koi and pretend that you were just a white hat all along. Maybe that's the way to do it. And maybe that makes it free and clear. I don't know. Look, I'm not a hacker. David, do you want to interview a hacker?
00:15:11.146 - 00:15:16.798, Speaker B: On yo if a hacker wants to come on bankless, let me know. I will throw you a Zoom link.
