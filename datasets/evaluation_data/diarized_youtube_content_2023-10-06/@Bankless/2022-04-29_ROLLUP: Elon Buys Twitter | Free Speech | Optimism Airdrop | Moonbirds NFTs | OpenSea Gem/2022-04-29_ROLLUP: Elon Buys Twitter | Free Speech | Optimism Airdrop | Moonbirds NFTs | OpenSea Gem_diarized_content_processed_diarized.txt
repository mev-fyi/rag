00:00:00.170 - 00:00:05.914, Speaker A: So that's pretty cool. So I guess flat on the week, my numbers are already. I put. We'll see. I wrote these numbers in 30 minutes ago, dude.
00:00:05.962 - 00:00:12.462, Speaker B: Look, by the time people hear this, it'll be inaccurate anyway. Guys, these numbers are always inaccurate, no matter what.
00:00:12.596 - 00:00:13.790, Speaker A: Twelve hour lag.
00:00:16.370 - 00:00:21.082, Speaker B: Bankless nation. It is the fourth week of April. It's Friday morning. So what time is it, David?
00:00:21.146 - 00:00:35.414, Speaker A: It's the Friday bankless weekly roll up time, Ryan, where we roll up the entire news in crypto that happened in the last week, which is always an ambitious endeavor, yet we persist nonetheless. Ready to get into it, Ryan? What happened this week?
00:00:35.452 - 00:00:48.198, Speaker B: I'm ready, man. It's good. Look, first of all, though, it's good to see you back in your place. You've been doing a lot of these road tour roll ups, and look, you've been doing from a hotel. Rooms, airbnbs, like, everywhere. And now you're back. You're back in San Diego.
00:00:48.198 - 00:00:48.794, Speaker B: At least for now.
00:00:48.832 - 00:00:53.510, Speaker A: Yeah. We have two more roll ups here before this place goes away forever.
00:00:53.590 - 00:00:53.930, Speaker B: Wow.
00:00:54.000 - 00:00:57.978, Speaker A: And a brand new apartment in Williamsburg will be the background.
00:00:58.074 - 00:01:06.106, Speaker B: It's great. David's background is constantly changing. Mine is always staying the same. The immutability of my background. David, it's not going anywhere.
00:01:06.298 - 00:01:09.140, Speaker A: Rendering for your background for whenever I move.
00:01:10.070 - 00:01:13.998, Speaker B: All right, man. So, topics of the week. First, we got to discuss Elon Musk.
00:01:14.094 - 00:01:15.922, Speaker A: He just bought Twitter, okay?
00:01:15.976 - 00:01:21.878, Speaker B: In an effort maybe to preserve free speech. I don't know. That's what he's saying. But also, the same day, something else happened. What happened?
00:01:21.964 - 00:01:47.182, Speaker A: Stani Kuluchov of Ave and also lens protocol, gets banned from Twitter because it's so ironic. Because Elon Musk buys Twitter to preserve free speech. And the same day, Stani gets banned from Twitter for tweeting out a joke about how he is the interim CEO to Twitter. I mean, you can see why Twitter would ban him. Well, that's false news. So, like, banhammer. But the irony of that happening the same day is interesting.
00:01:47.182 - 00:01:53.690, Speaker A: And so we actually interviewed Stannie, and we'll get some cuts of that interview here in the weekly roll up when we talk about Elon Musk buying Twitter.
00:01:53.850 - 00:02:04.734, Speaker B: Also, there was an optimism. Airdrop this week. This is the starting pistol for layer 222. We're going to discuss the details, the metrics, the governance system. We got it all. And finally, what's the last one here, David?
00:02:04.782 - 00:02:17.142, Speaker A: Edward Snowden has been a secret founder of a crypto project that we had no idea about until now. So we are going to get all of those details. What has he been up to? What project is it that is coming later in the show?
00:02:17.276 - 00:02:43.342, Speaker B: Guys, before we do that, I got to tell you about graph Day because it is conference season. That's why David's backgrounds are always shifting because he's going to all these different conferences after permissionless. The next one you need to go to, particularly if you are a builder, is graph day. Graph day is happening June 2. It's going to be a learning session on June 2. A ton of fantastic speakers followed by a three day hackathon. Okay, speakers like who? David? Name some of these out for us.
00:02:43.396 - 00:03:03.494, Speaker A: Oh, so many. We got Kevin Owaki. And from Gitcoin, we got Arjun Buctani from Connect, Camila Russo from the Defiant. She's going to be there. Also, one of my personal heroes in the space, Reese Linmark, is going to be there as well. We got Ava Balin from the graph foundation and so many others. Jake Berkman, who pilled us on nfts in the first place.
00:03:03.494 - 00:03:21.238, Speaker A: They're all going to be there. So if you are looking to bootstrap your web three career, if you just want to hear from the builders, or if you're looking to hack and be a part of the hackathon, the graph day event in San Francisco June 2 to fourth is for you. There is a link in the show notes to get $50 off. If you are so inclined.
00:03:21.414 - 00:03:27.262, Speaker B: You should be so inclined, especially if you're a builder, this is the place to go. But David, let's get into the markets first.
00:03:27.396 - 00:03:32.974, Speaker A: You know, what is more than $50 off? Ryan, what's more than $50 off?
00:03:33.012 - 00:03:34.154, Speaker B: You're going to tell me. It's bitcoin.
00:03:34.202 - 00:03:45.330, Speaker A: It's bitcoin. It's bitcoin. Bitcoin started the week at $41,300. It's down 3.9%. Oh, gosh. It jumped, actually, since I wrote these numbers. So my numbers are out of date.
00:03:45.330 - 00:04:01.402, Speaker A: Started the week at $41,300. I thought it went down 3.9%, but it looks like it only went down $50 because apparently it's mooning as we speak. So that's pretty cool. So I guess flat on the week, my numbers are already out put. We'll see. I wrote these numbers in 30 minutes ago.
00:04:01.456 - 00:04:08.282, Speaker B: Dude, by the time people hear this, it'll be inaccurate. Anyway, guys, these numbers are always inaccurate, no matter what.
00:04:08.416 - 00:04:09.398, Speaker A: Twelve hour lag.
00:04:09.494 - 00:04:13.434, Speaker B: Yeah, at least. Anyway, so what, are we kind of steady on the week?
00:04:13.472 - 00:04:20.494, Speaker A: Yeah, on the week. Flat on the week. Wow. My numbers got rugged by bitcoin. All right, well, let's go to ether and see how good or bad these numbers are.
00:04:20.612 - 00:04:22.766, Speaker B: It's got to be down, too, since you wrote this, right?
00:04:22.788 - 00:04:33.410, Speaker A: Yes. We started last week at $3,080. We are currently at $2,960. So we are down just a couple of percent on the week. Not too bad. Not too bad.
00:04:33.480 - 00:04:39.414, Speaker B: Yeah, kind of a flat week. And the ETH bitcoin ratio, we were down at the time of recording as well. What does that look like?
00:04:39.452 - 00:04:44.178, Speaker A: Yeah, we were down 1.5%. It's probably going to be about there still. Nonetheless.
00:04:44.274 - 00:04:54.010, Speaker B: How about all of crypto, total crypto market cap? We are at, let's see, 1.9 trillion below 2 trillion. Sad. That's a shame.
00:04:54.590 - 00:05:06.160, Speaker A: Ended last week at 1.98 trillion. We are at 1.93 trillion right now. Lost $50 billion in the crypto market cap. But what's a few billion dollars?
00:05:06.610 - 00:05:34.246, Speaker B: Here's the thing. We're kind of crabbing out, and we have been for the last few months, crab season back and forth, not necessarily up or down, just kind of back and forth. But we should also count our blessings because us dollars is heading towards all time highs. The Dixie, this is where you measure us dollars. Hasn't looked like this in a long time. We mentioned this last week, and it's been up only since last week. And what's the big story here? It's not that us dollars are up, but us dollars are up.
00:05:34.246 - 00:05:35.398, Speaker B: And yet what?
00:05:35.564 - 00:06:03.934, Speaker A: And yet crypto prices are flat. So relatively, it's a win, I think, because usually when the Dixie goes up, crypto prices go down. And so when the Dixie goes up a lot, as if it has. As it has, because it's actually higher. The Dixie is higher than it was during the depths of COVID where people were fleeing to dollars. During that March liquidation event, people were fleeing to dollars. And we are well above that point in the Dixie right now.
00:06:03.934 - 00:06:21.862, Speaker A: And yet over the last, I don't know, like month or so, crypto prices are flat. Historically, when the Dixie goes down, crypto prices go up bigly. And so right now, we're watching the Dixie go up and crypto markets stay flat. If the Dixie goes down, will crypto markets still go up? Is a big question. Yeah.
00:06:21.916 - 00:06:45.742, Speaker B: The Dixie is kind of a short term fear index. Right. And so you're talking about that spike in March 2020 when Covid happened and the spike all the way up in the dollar. And what happened to crypto, it went the complete opposite direction absolutely tanked. And now markets are fearful again. And yet crypto is not getting too hit to impact it. And, of course, in markets, all of this comes on the back of huge gains that crypto investors made in 2021 last year.
00:06:45.742 - 00:07:07.250, Speaker B: So while this year feels a little bit like crab season, last year was like boomtown. Crypto investors made $163,000,000,000 in gains in 2021. That is according to a chain analysis report. And they've looked directly at the data to drive that number. Incredible. $162,000,000,000. What do you think?
00:07:07.320 - 00:07:25.190, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's no wonder that all of a sudden sports stadiums now have companies names, including ours, as their new naming rights, right? I just love that. This is chain analysis report. Chain analysis. Just like the eye of Sauron of the government, probably sending this information straight to the IRS.
00:07:25.350 - 00:07:33.530, Speaker B: Oh, definitely. Absolutely. Chain analysis is advertising their services to every tax jurisdiction in the world.
00:07:33.600 - 00:07:33.882, Speaker A: Yes.
00:07:33.936 - 00:07:40.942, Speaker B: Like, hey, you want some money? Because all governments want money, right? Now. Look at this. $163,000,000,000 sitting for you.
00:07:40.996 - 00:07:45.594, Speaker A: We know where the capital gains are. It says chain. Alexis.
00:07:45.722 - 00:07:52.740, Speaker B: This is also why you should pay your taxes, incidentally, as well. I mean, there are crypto people who are like, how are they going to know?
00:07:54.390 - 00:07:56.594, Speaker A: Doesn't know how to tax jpeg.
00:07:56.642 - 00:08:30.094, Speaker B: Come on. EnS bull market. There has been a bull market in eths, the EnS domain name. Haven't heard a lot about ens at know, kind of in the narrative section, since their big airdrop and EnS price governance token responsibility. Token price has been down since. But I've always seen this, and I think you have, too, as, like, maybe the best NFT out there, one of the OG NFTs. And what's happening now is ens registrations are going like crazy, particularly in.
00:08:30.094 - 00:08:32.234, Speaker B: Is it four digit ens names?
00:08:32.282 - 00:08:58.946, Speaker A: Yeah. Low digit ens names, like, three digits are also hot, but there's just so few of those. So four digits are the ones. I think there's, like, something like 16,000 combinations of four digit ens names. So not that many if we're talking about the URL of the future Internet. And so this ens broker, which looks like a bot Twitter account, says 70 to 104 digit ens registrations in under an hour. Only 6622 remain.
00:08:58.946 - 00:09:06.806, Speaker A: So not all of them are minted. So that's what's going on. There's like a gold rush to mint the remaining four digit combination ens names.
00:09:06.998 - 00:09:28.174, Speaker B: Look, here's one that went five five, five eth went for 55.5 eth. It was sold for 55.5 e. I think some of this is coming from NFT world, right? So people are like basically buying their board ape number or their crypto punk number. That's some of the speculation.
00:09:28.222 - 00:09:31.410, Speaker A: You see that, snap, is one one available?
00:09:31.560 - 00:09:47.058, Speaker B: Yeah. See, now you're getting the promo. Snap, it's the ten k nft market. Right? And so people are how, there are crypto punks who go by like, I'm 6410 or whatever, and so why not have 6410 eth?
00:09:47.234 - 00:09:49.154, Speaker A: One one eight is already minted.
00:09:49.282 - 00:09:50.338, Speaker B: Is that your crypto punk?
00:09:50.354 - 00:09:51.702, Speaker A: That's my crypto punk. Yeah.
00:09:51.756 - 00:09:55.094, Speaker B: Too late. See, when we talk about it on a bank list, it's too late.
00:09:55.142 - 00:10:01.834, Speaker A: Yeah. Someone's going to have to help me for 1118 eth decline on that one.
00:10:01.872 - 00:10:04.638, Speaker B: Yeah, there you go. I got Rsa eth back.
00:10:04.724 - 00:10:05.726, Speaker A: That's a good one.
00:10:05.908 - 00:10:17.794, Speaker B: I'm hoddling that. But this is crazy. If you look at the revenue, ens revenue is now greater than all the fee revenue of bitcoin right now just at this point.
00:10:17.912 - 00:10:23.150, Speaker A: So is everything else is higher than bitcoin. Bitcoin just doesn't generate revenue, dude.
00:10:23.310 - 00:10:30.150, Speaker B: But it kind of needs to for security budget. Bitcoiners should be a little bit more worried about that than they are.
00:10:30.220 - 00:11:01.978, Speaker A: Yeah. The EnS revenue is also kind of the ENS security budget because that is the value flow that the EnS dao governs over. And part of this EnS mania is probably triggered at least a little bit by Fallon eth. Jimmy Fallon eth, the biggest EtH name yet. He is, I think, number one on the leaderboard now, or at least, no, excuse me. He's in the top 100 most followed Twitter accounts with a EtH in the Twitter name. So congratulations, Jimmy Fallon, also owner of a board ape.
00:11:01.978 - 00:11:28.418, Speaker A: And then, of course, there's also Budweiserbeer EtH. We all know that Budweiser bought beer EtH previously, but now Budweiser owns Budweiser beer Eth. This is a feature of Ens subdomains. So if you own something etH, you can make something, something eth. Kind of like how you can make a goot like a@gmail.com, right? I own moneylegos eth. Did you know that, Ryan? I own moneylegos.
00:11:28.434 - 00:11:31.674, Speaker B: I didn't know that. I knew somebody did. Somebody I knew.
00:11:31.712 - 00:11:39.606, Speaker A: So I could sell David Moneylegos eth or I could sell you, Ryan. Ryan Moneylegos Eth and so now Budweiser.
00:11:39.718 - 00:11:41.100, Speaker B: How much you want for it.
00:11:41.550 - 00:11:42.730, Speaker A: I'll give it to you, Ryan.
00:11:42.810 - 00:11:47.322, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Thank you, David. Appreciate you. I'll give you a David Rsa.
00:11:47.466 - 00:11:48.190, Speaker A: I love it.
00:11:48.260 - 00:11:49.280, Speaker B: I love it.
00:11:50.450 - 00:11:55.554, Speaker A: So, yeah, Budweiser, beer eth. Maybe. Dude, I would love David beer e.
00:11:55.592 - 00:11:58.500, Speaker B: So I like beer David Beer E.
00:12:00.710 - 00:12:30.166, Speaker A: Think of the possibilities. Right? Beer e. Absolutely. All the combinations. Anyways, this is a PSA to claim your Ens drop, because the last time that you are able to do that is on May 4. If you have, for some reason, I don't know, maybe your private keys are locked in a safe or something somewhere you don't live or somewhere else. You need to go get your private keys and unlock your Ens airdrop by May 4, or else it's gone forever.
00:12:30.166 - 00:12:33.546, Speaker A: So if you haven't done that yet, don't go do that.
00:12:33.728 - 00:12:36.830, Speaker B: That's happening to a friend that I know at this very moment.
00:12:36.900 - 00:12:38.970, Speaker A: Locked private keys in a safe.
00:12:39.050 - 00:12:43.586, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know who that claim their airdrop. So is it worth the flight home or not?
00:12:43.688 - 00:12:45.620, Speaker A: Oh, no, I have the safe here.
00:12:47.190 - 00:13:08.146, Speaker B: It's just even better. Live stream the unlocking event. Yeah. You know what? This also goes to show you that NFTs are the gateway to the rest of Ethereum. They really are. Here's Fallon buying a board ape, right? Wouldn't have even known what a domain name was prior to his board ape. And now he's doing Fallon eth, and he's the biggest one.
00:13:08.146 - 00:13:12.906, Speaker B: And that propagates it because he's got bajillions of followers. That's how we do it.
00:13:12.928 - 00:13:14.490, Speaker A: Those Ens bags, Jimmy.
00:13:14.910 - 00:13:20.522, Speaker B: Also apecoin. Let's talk about the apecoin price. Last market section, it's just going up.
00:13:20.576 - 00:13:57.346, Speaker A: When it got airdropped, it got airdropped at something like an eight to $10 billion market cap. Just apecoin valueless governance. Token of this unbuilt thing came in at $10 billion. And literally every other responsibility token that gets airdropped just is, like, down only versus basically. For example, of course, it's the ape coin which governs over nothing, gets airdropped at eight to $10 and is now at $22 at a $22 billion market cap. Ryan, you sound a little upset. Are you salty about this? This is ridiculous.
00:13:57.346 - 00:14:09.994, Speaker A: But this is so classic board apes. And I knew this was going to happen. I'm pretty sure I said this on the roll ups. Everything that the apes touch just goes up. And so why won't this go up as well? Look at this.
00:14:10.032 - 00:14:26.210, Speaker B: This is the ENS drop, which we were just talking about all of the virtues and values of the ens with an actual product that's built and it's ready. Higher revenue than bitcoin down only higher revenue than bitcoin and down to like $2 billion. So, like, apes are like ten x.
00:14:26.280 - 00:14:35.250, Speaker A: Ten x that. There's no fundamentals. Like, maybe I'm missing something. I don't pay attention to the AP because it's them that much, but yeah, what the hell, dude?
00:14:35.670 - 00:14:50.166, Speaker B: Fundamentals don't matter in crypto. Attention does. And apes have the attention, and so they have the capital in the short run. That's how it works, guys. That's the lesson. Enough of markets, because we're tired of talking about it. We'll be back with some releases of the week.
00:14:50.166 - 00:14:56.790, Speaker B: Then we got some hot news for you and of course, the rest of the show. But before we get there, we got to thank the sponsors that made this episode possible.
00:14:56.940 - 00:15:31.730, Speaker A: The era of proof of stake is upon us, and Lido is bringing bringing proof of stake to everyone. Lido is a decentralized staking protocol that allows users to stake their proof of stake assets using Lido's distributed network of nodes. Don't choose between staking your assets or using them as collateral in Defi with Lido, you can have both. Using Lido, you can stake any amount of your EtH to the Lido validating network and receive ST ETH in return. ST ETH can be traded, used as collateral for lending and borrowing, or leveraged on your favorite defi protocols. All this without giving up your EtH to centralized staking services or exchanges. Lido now supports Terra Solana, Kusama and Polygon staking.
00:15:31.730 - 00:16:05.702, Speaker A: Whatever your preferred proof of stake asset is, Lido is here to take away the complexities of staking while enabling you to get liquidity on your stake. If you want to stake your EtH, terra Sol or matic and get liquidity on your stake, go to Lido fi to get started. That's Lido fi to get started. The layer two era is upon us. Ethereum's layer two ecosystem is growing every day, and we need bridges to be fast and efficient in order to live a layer two life. Across is the fastest, cheapest, and most secure crosschain bridge with across. You don't have to worry about the long wait times or high fees to get your assets to the chain of your choice.
00:16:05.702 - 00:16:55.962, Speaker A: Assets are bridged and available for use almost instantaneously. Across bridges are powered by Uma's optimistic oracle to securely transfer tokens from layer two back to Ethereum, a token proposal is being deliberated as we speak in the across forum, where community members will decide on the token distribution. You can have your part of a cross's story by joining the discord and becoming a co founder and helping to design the fair fair launch of Accross. If you want to bridge your assets quickly and securely, go to accrop to to bridge your assets between Ethereum, optimism, arbitram or boba networks. If you're trying to grow and preserve your crypto wealth, optimizing your taxes is just as lucrative as trying to find the next hidden gem. Altoira can help you invest in crypto in tax advantage ways to help you preserve your hard earned money. Alto Crypto IRA lets you invest in more than 150 coins and tokens with all the same tax advantages of an IRA.
00:16:55.962 - 00:17:21.722, Speaker A: They make it easy to fund your alternative IRA or crypto IRA via your by contributing directly from your bank account. There is no setup or account fees and is all you need to do to invest in crypto tax free. Let me repeat that again. You can invest in crypto tax free. Diversify like the pros and trade without tax headaches. Open an Alto crypto IRA to invest in crypto tax free. Just go to altoira.com
00:17:21.722 - 00:17:28.474, Speaker A: bankless. That's altoira.com bankless and start investing in crypto today.
00:17:28.592 - 00:17:43.214, Speaker B: All right, guys, we are back with the releases of the week. This one's big. This is part of the Defi mullet thesis, David, which is basically fintech is going to look nice and fresh in the front. The party's going to be in the back. That's the defi mullet. And the party is, of course, decentralized finance. Right, that's here.
00:17:43.214 - 00:18:01.906, Speaker B: That's on bankless. Bankless in the back. This is an example of that fintech giant stripe. They just jumped into crypto with a feature that lets Twitter users get paid in stablecoins. What is the stablecoin? I believe it's USDC. Where are they deploying it? Polygon. An ethereum layer two sidechain.
00:18:01.906 - 00:18:23.770, Speaker B: And this is really interesting because Stripe has talked for a while about, like, crypto whatever. It's a fad they actually abandoned. They adopted bitcoin as payment, and they abandoned it back in 2018. Now here they are in 2022 reentering stablecoins on Ethereum. This is the utility that that d five mullet gives you. Kind of cool to see.
00:18:23.920 - 00:18:42.734, Speaker A: This is what we love. This is why layer twos are so, so important. And the layer two two. Revolution has only just begun. And so stripe is getting ahead of the curve here before other payment providers. So as layer two progresses, I expect a lot more things of this nature. All right, coming up next, there is Volt protocol now live on the Ethereum mainnet.
00:18:42.734 - 00:19:22.094, Speaker A: Volt protocol is a CPI adjusted stablecoin and is now live. And so if you don't like losing the value of your dollars due to inflation, there's a stablecoin on ethereum that can help with that. Volt is a fork out of the Faye protocol, and so it's using phase protocol's code base, which is generally, well, battle tested as far as stablecoins go. And then they also integrate chain link oracles to help with the CPI adjusted number over time. And so as these chain link oracles report an increasing inflation, the value of the stablecoin will go up. And there's also just a bunch of DFI 2.0 mafia gang people.
00:19:22.094 - 00:19:37.202, Speaker A: I think you'll recognize a lot of people here. Sam Cosmani from fracs, we had him on the show recently. Joey from tribe, jay from Rari, Tim Baco as well. And of course, the man whale himself, tetranode. So really solid project or a really solid team behind this project.
00:19:37.336 - 00:19:39.874, Speaker B: Yeah, it'll be cool to see more entrance into the freight.
00:19:39.922 - 00:19:45.750, Speaker A: Excuse me, those are not people in on the project. Those are just angel investors. But they probably are going to help nonetheless.
00:19:46.170 - 00:20:09.422, Speaker B: I'm sure they will. Speaking of helping fidelity, they're helping bitcoin right now and they're helping all of crypto. They are allowing retirement savers to put bitcoin in 401K accounts. This is absolutely massive, David, because so many companies use fidelity for their four hundred and one k service. Fidelity has something like $2.7 trillion. $2.7
00:20:09.422 - 00:20:13.450, Speaker B: trillion with the t of assets under management.
00:20:13.530 - 00:20:13.774, Speaker A: Wow.
00:20:13.812 - 00:20:33.318, Speaker B: It's absolutely insane. 23,000 companies. Yeah, it's a little bit more, not much more. But 23,000 companies use fidelity for their retirement plans. And, you know, bitcoin is coming. Like, bitcoin is here, but other crypto assets are coming. In fact, they mentioned that in the press release, fidelity is the custodian here.
00:20:33.318 - 00:21:04.702, Speaker B: So fidelity is taking custody of the bitcoin assets, too. And they've developed out their custody service for like the last five, six years. So that's all in place. It's really funny, in the Wall Street Journal article that I have linked here, at the bottom, there's quotes from the labor department of the US saying, this is seriously concerning. And that people should use extreme care when investing in crypto. So a little bit of FUD coming out of the Department of Labor because.
00:21:04.756 - 00:21:07.026, Speaker A: They are, of course material scared of.
00:21:07.048 - 00:21:13.970, Speaker B: Bitcoin and Fidelity put a cap on it. So the max cap is you can only Yolo in 20% of your retirement account.
00:21:14.040 - 00:21:14.322, Speaker A: Right.
00:21:14.376 - 00:21:30.602, Speaker B: So it is still traditional finance. Like, we don't want you to be too risky. Not too much crypto on the cap there, but still a big step in the right direction. Directionally, correctionally correct. Super cool. And it's big. Look, this is going to usher in a lot of new money into the space.
00:21:30.736 - 00:21:34.220, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome. Well, again, directionally correct. Nice job.
00:21:34.830 - 00:22:07.202, Speaker B: This is another cool thing. Angelist is rolling out USDC. So angel list is kind of a place that naval actually created it. It's a place for angel investors to network and connect to startups. And so the traditional way, if you were angel investor, you wanted to invest in a startup, you had to wire funds or ACH transfer from the bank. And now they just rolled out USDC, another example of stablecoins, USDC winning. And I am so glad that we don't have to wire funds as much as we used to.
00:22:07.202 - 00:22:09.606, Speaker B: When that goes away, that will be a happy day for me.
00:22:09.628 - 00:22:18.566, Speaker A: David, there are some angel investments that we've participated in, Ryan, where they're like, no, we can't accept USDC. You must wire funds. And we're both like, well, I'm not.
00:22:18.588 - 00:22:28.220, Speaker B: Sure we're a crypto native company. And you want me to wire funds from a bank account?
00:22:29.630 - 00:22:31.094, Speaker A: What are we doing here, folks?
00:22:31.222 - 00:22:39.470, Speaker B: Yeah, Angel, Angelisto is rolling that out for everybody. This is another thing you want to talk about this Nike and artifact, they're doing something.
00:22:39.540 - 00:23:08.146, Speaker A: Yeah, artifact. The NFT studio reveal crypto kicks the first ever Ethereum NFT metaverse sneakers. I mean, there are sneaker heads out there. They're like the OG NFTs before NFts were really a thing, right? Some people collect coins, some people collect stamps, some people collect sneakers. And sneakers generally be the most future of those things. So I guess it makes sense to put sneakers into the metaverse, like sneaker heads. They don't even wear their sneakers anyways.
00:23:08.146 - 00:23:18.106, Speaker A: And they collect them. They just collect them. So I guess it makes sense to have nfts. They look pretty sick as far as shoes go, but yeah, that is what is going on.
00:23:18.288 - 00:23:20.662, Speaker B: You want to see what these puppies are going for on openc?
00:23:20.726 - 00:23:22.954, Speaker A: Oh, I don't, but you're going to tell me anyways.
00:23:23.082 - 00:23:24.320, Speaker B: Here's floor price?
00:23:24.770 - 00:23:26.510, Speaker A: 2.1 e. Okay.
00:23:26.660 - 00:23:27.214, Speaker B: Floor price.
00:23:27.252 - 00:23:28.106, Speaker A: It's not terrible.
00:23:28.218 - 00:23:37.342, Speaker B: Oh, come on, man. How much? So convert that into dollars. What's that, like $6,231. Would you pay that for a pair of sneakers if you were a sneaker head, David?
00:23:37.406 - 00:23:40.194, Speaker A: Absolutely not. But it's a JPeg, Ryan. Of course.
00:23:40.392 - 00:23:44.242, Speaker B: What's the maximum amount you've paid for sneakers? Oh, are you sneaker culture guy?
00:23:44.296 - 00:23:54.600, Speaker A: No, absolutely not. I have my pair of Nike dunks that I paid like $80 for. I had one red and black one and one blue and white one, and on 4 July I would wear one of each.
00:23:55.770 - 00:24:01.626, Speaker B: Awesome, man. So no Nike sneaky sneakers for David. But I bet you pay more in the metaverse, though.
00:24:01.808 - 00:24:03.910, Speaker A: There's always the metaverse premium, Ryan.
00:24:04.070 - 00:24:08.362, Speaker B: I guess there is. Now David's JPeG protocol. They're doing something.
00:24:08.416 - 00:24:12.480, Speaker A: What's this jpegged protocol? Dubious name, but okay.
00:24:13.410 - 00:24:14.590, Speaker B: Why dubious?
00:24:15.010 - 00:24:20.014, Speaker A: I don't need to explain that. Okay, you don't know. Ryan doesn't know.
00:24:20.052 - 00:24:24.034, Speaker B: But this is a kid friendly show. I think you're going somewhere else.
00:24:24.072 - 00:24:55.210, Speaker A: We don't need to go jpegged collateralized nfts. We know that this is on the frontier. This is coming out now. There is the PUSD stablecoin, which you can get a borrow at 2%, which is pretty low as for a fee. So if you put your nfts into jpegged, you get to borrow PUSD at a 2% interest rate, and that's how you get liquidity on your jpegs. They also have this insurance mechanism. Actually, I'll get to that in a second.
00:24:55.210 - 00:25:39.170, Speaker A: Users can borrow up to 32% of the floor price of their jpegs in PUSD. Liquidation will happen when the debt to equity ratio equals or exceeds 33%. There is a chain link, oracle for that floor price. I truly hope that they've thought about gaming, because you can totally game the floor price of something. They must have thought about this. I don't know how they did, but I can't imagine that they just totally have, Ryan, an insurance mechanism, which is only made possible about how, because the Dow underwrites the debt so users can purchase insurance to repurchase their NFT in case they get liquidated. So, like, if I put my crypto punk up for collateralization, I borrowed against it, I got liquidated.
00:25:39.170 - 00:25:48.742, Speaker A: I could go with that insurance, which cost me 5%. I could go back, buy back my Jpeg rather than just having to buy back any old random cryptopunk. And that is pegged.
00:25:48.806 - 00:26:21.782, Speaker B: Do you think this is kind of why the metaverse premium exists, because you can't do that if you're a sneaker head. You can't do that with your sneakers, right? But you can do this with your $6,000 metaverse sneakers. You can actually take a loan out against it. And it just makes me laugh. Do you know in the future how many twelve year olds are going to become millionaires and then go broke and then become millionaires again and then go broke because of this sort of mechanic? You get like NFT game items, suddenly they're worth like tens of thousands of dollars overnight. And then some twelve year old goes and leverages them on JPEG and loses it all.
00:26:21.836 - 00:26:56.506, Speaker A: Doesn't understand what it means to leverage up all of your jpegs. As soon as I realized that NFT collateralization was going to be a thing, I've always been of the opinion that this is going to result in a lot of NFTs changing hands and a lot of people being really upset because we all know I keep on harping on the ape community, so sorry about that. But I'm going to keep on doing like, if they lose their private keys, they're going to take an unreasonable amount of debt. Probably as soon as it's easy to do that. Yes. As soon as it's easy to do that, it's probably going to happen. And there's just going to be a big churning of Degen NFT holders because there's going to be some NFT drop.
00:26:56.506 - 00:27:08.054, Speaker A: They're not going to have any more cash. They're going to go to Jpegged and collateralize their nfts and leverage up on nfts, the most ridiculous thing to leverage up on. And then, Ryan, they are going to get jpegged, if you will.
00:27:08.252 - 00:27:31.918, Speaker B: This is great because I've been hoping for better financial education in the US, in the world for kids. This is how they're going to learn. Look, man, this is how everyone learns. Unless you lose a lot of money, unless you get liquidated. Better to learn these lessons when you're twelve years old. You're getting jpeg then, rather than get jpegged when you're in the early jpegged on your house.
00:27:32.004 - 00:27:34.526, Speaker A: Yeah. Just hand that tax bill off to mommy. Okay.
00:27:34.628 - 00:27:52.654, Speaker B: There you go. Twelve year olds having to pay taxes on NFT. What is happening? So much great stuff with crypto. Let's get to raises, though. Another $1 billion has just entered crypto in the form of a new fund. This time, Joe McCann is raising.
00:27:52.702 - 00:27:58.102, Speaker A: Joe McCann is a targeting $1 billion. Not one targeting 1 billion. Yeah.
00:27:58.156 - 00:28:24.054, Speaker B: Okay, well, I bet they'll be able to do it. This guy's career has spanned Microsoft, also asymmetric, passport capital. Look, man, the TLDR is another $1 billion fund has entered the fray. Been talking like channels. People are like, well, private equity, where are they going to deploy all of this in crypto? Private equity is going. It's getting crazy. Like these deals that aren't public for credit investors.
00:28:24.054 - 00:28:29.706, Speaker B: A billion dollars has to go somewhere. Where's it going to go? It's just going to increase the valuations of all of these crypto startups.
00:28:29.818 - 00:29:11.430, Speaker A: It's absolutely insane, dude, 1999. You know what we should do, Ryan? There's a number of stories I've heard of, just like, insane valuations. I heard a story where some startup founder was doing some modest raise at like $20 to $30 million valuation, which is not modest, but now it is. And then the VC firm that wanted to, that was going to lead that round came back to him and said, hey, we are going to double the valuation that you're asking for. We'll let you raise at $60 million, but you have to give us all of it because they don't have any places to deploy all the capital, Ryan. So the private equity rounds are extremely overvalued, and there's so much cash laying around. And you know what is happening, Ryan, is everyone is forgetting about the blue chips.
00:29:11.430 - 00:29:38.366, Speaker A: They're forgetting about bitcoin, they're forgetting about. And, like, I think a mistake that people like perhaps Joe McCann are doing is they're thinking like, okay, get me into crypto. I don't know what to buy. So diversify, right? I just invest all across the board and just diversify me into crypto. Not realizing and not knowing that bitcoin and ETH are basically indices. They're basically indices of the whole entire crypto market cap. Ether is formally an indices of the ethereum economy.
00:29:38.366 - 00:29:59.822, Speaker A: And so they're making the mistake of thinking, okay, I don't want concentrated bets deploying my capital everywhere. But then they're deploying their capital in these overvalued valuations, and they're forgetting about the blue chips. Ryan, what should we do? We should start a startup that takes in money from all these investors and we just buy ETH and we're going to outperform every single startup ever in the last year.
00:29:59.996 - 00:30:25.374, Speaker B: Kind of what I was thinking, if I had a billion dollar VC fund, first thing I'd do is I'd be like, thank you for your money. I'm deploying all of this right away, and I'm buying a billion dollars worth of ETh. And then I would take that ETH. I would stake a portion of it, and then my objective would be to go beat the value of ETH measure. All of my denominator would be ETH and all future investments I would weight them against. Is this going to appreciate relative to ETh or not? And if it does, I'd deploy there. There's our fund, David.
00:30:25.422 - 00:30:35.446, Speaker A: We just made it. And Ryan, it's going to outperform every other fund or every other private equity fund that came out in the last year. I firmly believe in.
00:30:35.548 - 00:30:39.094, Speaker B: See, we'll see. Maybe we'll, maybe we'll announce in the launch next week.
00:30:39.132 - 00:30:42.858, Speaker A: David, every single VC fund operator is like, listening to this is like, you.
00:30:42.864 - 00:30:45.034, Speaker B: Guys are idiots, but they definitely are.
00:30:45.072 - 00:30:50.678, Speaker A: But for those listening, we also think that you're idiots. But who knows? Who knows?
00:30:50.694 - 00:30:57.262, Speaker B: No, I don't think Haseeb is an idiot. Don't put him there. But this is his firm. He's part of this firm. Dragonfly Capital. We should talk about this.
00:30:57.316 - 00:31:15.534, Speaker A: Yeah. Raise $650,000,000 in their third fund. They actually can't deploy money into ETH, so they are restricting that. They have to do it into private equity. And so $650,000,000 into Dragonfly Capital's third fund. Extremely successful fund. I actually did a show with Haseeb on Layer Zero about how to be a vc.
00:31:15.534 - 00:31:26.246, Speaker A: If you want to get into the brain of one of the most articulate vcs out there and what it takes to become a VC. That was a really good episode. Dragonfly, $650,000,000 3rd fund.
00:31:26.348 - 00:31:58.542, Speaker B: Look, man, I want to be fair to vcs. They actually crushed it last year, the last couple of years relative to ETH, right? They absolutely crushed it. So I guess there's credit where it's due. Liquefy, they're building a carta of web three. Carta is where you basically track your pre public shares investing, whether you're an employee and you're getting vested shares or whether it's some sort of a startup. And Liquify is bringing that to web three companies doing that with dows, I assume so. Something interesting going on there, David?
00:31:58.606 - 00:31:59.250, Speaker A: Next up.
00:31:59.320 - 00:32:00.450, Speaker B: Yeah, this is pretty cool.
00:32:00.520 - 00:32:25.340, Speaker A: Ethereum Scaling solution scroll raises $30 million from Bain Capital and some other angel investments, of which Ryan and I are some of them. So disclaimer, there scroll is building a Zke EVM. I met some of the team at ETH, Amsterdam at mev day, talented group of people and some other angels include Santiago Santos, Anthony Cesano and many others in the Ethereum community.
00:32:25.710 - 00:32:39.274, Speaker B: Yeah, scroll is a really interesting layer, too. They've got some work to do, though. First, it's not going to be ready for Mainet for a while. Zero X. They just raised $70 million from Greylock, Openc and Jared Leto.
00:32:39.322 - 00:32:39.920, Speaker A: No.
00:32:40.290 - 00:32:41.040, Speaker B: Why?
00:32:41.490 - 00:32:47.178, Speaker A: Jared Leto is actually the actor of one of my favorite movies. It's called Mr. Nobody. But very few people actually know that movie. It's a good movie.
00:32:47.274 - 00:32:55.938, Speaker B: No, I've never watched it. But Mr. Nobody is now investing in Zero X, so it's cool. The celebrities are getting into the game too, a little bit. David Jobs report. You ready for it?
00:32:56.024 - 00:32:56.930, Speaker A: Let's do it.
00:32:57.080 - 00:33:11.482, Speaker B: Okay. This is our weekly reminder to tell you to get a job in Crypto. Oh my God. This first job looks amazing. I'm going to read some of them out. A lead community manager at Cryptoskulls. Dow can't even imagine what crypto skulls does, but you got to get that job.
00:33:11.482 - 00:33:49.010, Speaker B: Senior product engineer at Parcel, junior engineer at Bankless and Ethereum. Core developer Nethermind, Golang engineer, Starknet clients Nethermind, bankless newsletter editor. We're still looking. Content manager at Tally, director of developer relations, a solidity architect, marketing manager at Mesha UX, designer Prometheus community manager at the Degen Dogs club, co founder for a TBD Defi Primitive, a backend software engineer at AgMI. I could go on, but I won't. There's a link in the show notes to all of these jobs, and David is exhausted because he's been dancing this whole time, as usual. What do we have to say about that? Just get a job in crypto.
00:33:50.230 - 00:34:19.466, Speaker A: Help David dance less by getting a job in crypto and making this jobs board go down. If you want to post your job, there's a link in the show notes. Also bankless, palette.com slash jobs. And also there's this thing called the talent collective for the other side of the matchmaking market. So if you are good talent and you want to be pitched to join other people's company, there is the talent collective, where you can upload your resume and have your resume be reviewed by all the companies that are hiring in crypto.
00:34:19.498 - 00:34:25.134, Speaker B: So that is, sometimes that's a good play. You play hard to get. You just like make them come for you.
00:34:25.172 - 00:34:25.902, Speaker A: That's exactly right.
00:34:25.956 - 00:34:36.290, Speaker B: All right, our first news item, the biggest. Elon Musk just bought Twitter. A couple of weeks ago, he said he wanted to buy it. Twitter said, no. They've been doing this dance back and forth. It was all public. It's very great.
00:34:36.290 - 00:34:49.830, Speaker B: Now he purchased it. So, breaking news. Twitter and Elon Musk reach a deal on the buyout to be announced shortly. That was announced. I'm not sure if it's fully closed yet, but it's basically, for all intents and purposes, Elon Musk now owns Twitter.
00:34:50.570 - 00:35:07.614, Speaker A: Neat. How do I feel about that? I think pretty good. I think pretty good. I mean, he built one of the coolest car companies that exists. He's sending rockets to the moon, so don't fade. Elon. And his ability to innovate Twitter will probably be pretty cool as a result of that.
00:35:07.614 - 00:35:25.790, Speaker A: I have a take later on in the show about this, but I think probably big changes coming to Twitter. I don't think he bought Twitter, Ryan, just to add an edit button or just to do a few other tweaks. No, he didn't want to just add that. He's got big plans. Elon Musk never has small plans. He only has big plans.
00:35:25.870 - 00:35:52.350, Speaker B: Well, I hope one of those plans is actually to distribute ownership to those who aren't Elon Musk. And maybe we'll talk about that, because what's still going on right now is people are getting banned, often for no reason. And Stani from the Aave protocol, Defi founder, was actually banned just this week. We actually had a conversation with Stani this morning, and we're going to play the highlights now. Stani, how's Twitter jail going for you? What's going on here?
00:35:52.420 - 00:36:05.582, Speaker C: Not very well, to be honest. There's no one to talk to here. I feel like I don't have any audience. I have all my audience in Twitter, and I got banned, and I don't know who to talk to.
00:36:05.636 - 00:36:24.754, Speaker B: Look, if you're on Twitter, or any social media account for that matter, you don't actually own the property there, right? Don't own the list of your followers. It's completely private property. And we are viewing the actual tweets on YouTube. And I just want to recap this. Okay, so this is innocent. This is innocent af. This is, like, even wholesome.
00:36:24.754 - 00:36:51.194, Speaker B: It's funny. Stannie tweets breaking joining Twitter as interim CEO, clearly an Elon Musk style joke. And then as a follow up, he offers an actual tongue in cheek list of solutions of what Twitter should be implementing moving forward. If I'm in the product team of Twitter, I'm like, jotting some of this stuff down potentially. And he says this. Thank you for the opportunity to work at Twitter. My first agenda in the roadmap for the first 90 days is ship an edit button, open source.
00:36:51.194 - 00:37:28.394, Speaker B: The Twitter elgos add support for ens and ethereum integrate with lens protocol. I ask you, the viewer, is this a banable offense on Twitter? Like, what is going on? No due process, no explanation as to why this is not a threat of violence in any way, shape or form or incitement of violence? How does this break the policy of Twitter? These are some of the questions I have. But now this is Elon Musk's problem, isn't it? Because Elon Musk just majority purchased all of Twitter, which makes him kind of the governance vote for everything that happens on this platform.
00:37:28.592 - 00:37:58.840, Speaker A: And we have also seen Elon Musk dabble in the world of web three. He loves to pay attention to dogecoin, which is like almost web three. He knows what ethereum is. He knows the basics of this. Are you optimistic that Elon Musk might actually look into the fundamentals of what web three is and why it has drawn so much excitement from the world around it? And perhaps use his platform, use his now majority share over Twitter to turn Twitter into something like web three?
00:38:00.490 - 00:39:15.834, Speaker C: I very much hope so, because there's just so much value added in the web three. Pretty much. Even if you think about protocols, on chain protocols with different kinds of rules, whether it's decentralized finance or web three, social media or something else. So it's very valuable and efficient way to actually provide the ownership to the users. But also if you kind of approach the whole idea of who is the epicenter, most valuable, kind of like a stakeholder in social media, it's pretty much the users. And the way we have built social media is that we extract a lot of data from the users and then pretty much use that data and algorithms to essentially sell different kinds of services to the user in terms of like web three, social. We turn around this mechanism in a way where the user is actually the one who owns its own network, and then these applications experience layers, algorithms are actually competing to provide the best services, bringing transparency and other values.
00:39:15.882 - 00:39:20.042, Speaker B: I have tweeted this tweet out as an experiment. I'm wondering if I'm about to get banned.
00:39:20.106 - 00:39:23.070, Speaker A: Oh, you're not joining Twitter as an interim CEO, Ryan.
00:39:24.050 - 00:39:39.382, Speaker B: Maybe I will. Maybe we are all ceos. Maybe that is the web three way. I think that's ultimately what we are saying here, is we should be ceos of our own Twitter account. So if you want to tweet out breaking joining Twitter as interim CEO, you can. Let's see if we get banned here.
00:39:39.436 - 00:39:45.426, Speaker A: I really like that line you said, ryan, we should all be ceos of your own social media account. You think about that on the spot?
00:39:45.618 - 00:40:00.282, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, yes. I mean, it's basically what the tweet was saying, right? It's like Stannie was, I'm the new CEO of Twitter, and I was just like, you know what? We should all be ceos of our individual Twitter accounts. That is the decentralized web three model, isn't it?
00:40:00.336 - 00:40:40.534, Speaker A: Yeah, that's exactly right. All right. And the other big news of the week, optimism introduced the optimism collective, which is code word for releasing an airdrop. So that happened on Tuesday morning. We did a show with an hour and a half long show going all the way into the details about the optimism collective, what it is, and it's basically a two house model. And so it's got the token house, which is governed by, I think you can guess, a token, but it also has the citizens house, which is kind of this new innovation. And they have this bicameral system, this two party system of sorts, where one is focused on the short term incentives, which is the tokens, and the one that is focused on the long term incentives, which is the citizens house.
00:40:40.534 - 00:41:44.874, Speaker A: The tokens house is, of course, composed by all the people that own the tokens. The citizens house are on chain identities, on chain people governed by a soul bound NFT. So an NFT that is fixed to your wallet that you cannot transfer, that you have been given, because the optimism collective has deemed you a valuable contributor who understands how to drive sustainable growth to optimism, ethereum, and the new Internet. And so this whole idea, this whole concept is that optimism can use the block space revenue from the optimism layer two and will generate that revenue, and then it will send that to the protocol, and the citizens house will govern over what is called retroactive public goods funding, which is going to unlock something that I think is super massive. Ryan and I are about to record a podcast about this, because, Ryan, I think this is a billion dollar opportunity toward by the end of this year, and probably more than that, and then by the starting next year, it's going to be something like a ten to $50 billion opportunity that we have never.
00:41:44.912 - 00:41:46.766, Speaker B: The opportunity. What is the opportunity?
00:41:46.868 - 00:42:20.338, Speaker A: Block space revenue going to people who create public goods. This is what optimism has pioneered, where if you think that you can build public goods, then you can get money for that and not just a little bit of money. Ryan, this whole concept of retroactive public goods funding is injecting Silicon Valley type incentives, but allowing for public goods to be a product. This is something brand new in the crypto space. I'm extremely excited about it. I think this is the new alpha for the rest of the 2022 and 2023 because this, I think, will become standard for l two s. L two s will need to invest in infrastructure.
00:42:20.338 - 00:42:40.782, Speaker A: They are going to use the revenue for their block space to do it. And they will need builders who can build products that have never before has been seen on the face of this earth, which are public goods. So the upside potential of a tech startup, but the product potential of a public good. Brand new. Brand new thing out of crypto. We needed crypto to unlock this, and this has never been seen before. I'm really excited about this.
00:42:40.836 - 00:42:56.478, Speaker B: You know, another term for public goods that people are probably familiar with because we use it all the time is open source software. Yes, that is open source software. And that is one of the main public goods that people will be creating clients and all sorts of open source tools that will support the crypto industry.
00:42:56.574 - 00:43:59.570, Speaker A: That's exactly right. In addition to this airdrop and this new optimism collective, they have also created the Optimism foundation, which will be the way that the optimism Public Benefits Corporation, the company that has existed thus far, will start to add in other members that are not part of that company, to start to slowly dilute the original members and be a path towards decentralization. So the Optimism foundation has been created, and it will eventually defer all governance rights of the foundation to the on chain Citizens House, eventually a big step forward for building out an ecosystem of contributors for optimism. So the two members of the Optimism team, Jing and Ben, will be joining the Optimism Foundation. Carl from optimism will be sticking around with the optimism labs, which is a new organization, the protocol engineers of optimism sticking around, and then over time, this will be wholly decentralized. But of course, Ryan, there was an airdrop, and so 5% of the total supply of optimism was airdropped just last Tuesday. You can go check your eligibility.
00:43:59.570 - 00:44:26.046, Speaker A: I've got a couple eligible addresses, which is just lovely. If you've donated to Gitcoin, you're eligible. If you have been, quote, priced out of Ethereum, you're eligible. If you have done a bunch of other things. I think if you've used optimism, deposited into optimism and used it for four weeks, you got an airdrop. There's a bunch of different ways to have gotten the airdrop. If you got the airdrop for multiple reasons, there is a multiple reason bonus, and then there are tiers to that as well.
00:44:26.046 - 00:44:53.050, Speaker A: So if you did all six, I think, of the criteria for getting the optimism airdrop, you got the third tier bonus size, so you get bonus for doing more things. So that is pretty cool. And the other cool thing, Ryan, is that there's not just one airdrop, that is airdrop number one. So implying there will be also airdrop two and airdrop three and airdrop four going forward, as determined by the community. And what is best for the optimism layer two. What are we looking at here, Ryan?
00:44:53.470 - 00:45:30.470, Speaker B: This looks like some data, some transaction and wallet data, I think, for optimism. And it's really cool to benchmark this and actually look at the usage of the thing, because the optimism network is being used pretty heavily. I think it's actually the network with the 6th most fees, and they did all of that previously without any token. So this is definitely top ten of all chains. And so what we're looking at here is the number of transactions in wallets over the last 30 days. There's been about 66,000 wallets. So every wallet is like a bank account.
00:45:30.470 - 00:45:46.742, Speaker B: So 66,000 bank accounts. A total number of addresses that have been created on optimism, 330k. So these could be all potential citizens. Some citizens might have more than one bank account. A lot of fees being generated here, too. I've got some other charts here, David.
00:45:46.806 - 00:46:17.218, Speaker A: Before you go on, though, very important to note, there's two metrics I want to pull out here. Last 30 days, optimism has saved 192,000 ether from getting spent on gas. And because it has saved that much ether being spent on gas, it has been able to collect 520 ether. So this is the business of optimism. It is saving users. It saved users over the last 30 days, 192,000 ether. And for that service, it collected for itself 520 ether in 30 days.
00:46:17.218 - 00:46:43.362, Speaker A: And Ryan, you can see what happens when a token gets injected. Look at the bottom left chart. Transacting addresses per day, up and to the right in the final days of April, because of the token, transacting addresses on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, you can see that all go up into the right. Transactions per day up into the right. This is what happens when you inject token incentives. We know this is true. And if you go look at Ryan Avalanche, which is like optimism, a fork of death.
00:46:43.362 - 00:47:01.070, Speaker A: When they started doing liquidity, mining incentives, that's when avalanche started really succeeding, really getting TvL and driving usage. And optimism has been able to do comparable amounts of usage before having a token. Ryan, so this is why we're calling this the starting pistol for L 222. It's got to come with the tokens.
00:47:01.150 - 00:47:29.690, Speaker B: And the cool thing about all of these layers two s, of course, is because they are a primary consumer of block space on Ethereum. And so ultimately they settle on Ethereum because that's where they're driving their security. So this is optimism's layer one gas used per month and transaction fees, the amount of transaction fees they are actually spending, the amount of blocks based l one purchases they have on Ethereum. So what does this indicate to us?
00:47:29.760 - 00:48:03.922, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, you can just see that, especially that top chart of just the gas per used per day just going up and up and up, especially now that there's a token. And as layer two is built out, we are not even close to being done with reducing fees on layer two. So that's also going to drive a ton of adoption. Of course, that is going to increase the total transactions on the layer one burning ether on the layer one. Because, of course, as we have said, ethereum turns into a settlement layer not for people, but for other blockchains. Optimism layer two and other layer twos like it are the settlement layers for people. The l one is the settlement layer for other blockchains.
00:48:03.922 - 00:48:30.506, Speaker A: And then I thought this one was funny. Ryan. As soon as they airdropped a token, like, look at that spike at the very far right side. Just two. Since dropping a token, the number of unique addresses on optimism jumped from what was that? 350,000 to where it is now at over 800,000. Inside of one day, 400,000 unique new addresses came onto optimism because of the token. L two two, man, it's right around the corner.
00:48:30.618 - 00:48:52.262, Speaker B: I mean, here's the reality. Here's that list that we talked about earlier. Optimism is the 6th most fee generating chain right now. And it's above Solana, for instance, just below arbitrum, which is another layer two. It's getting close to passing bitcoin. And then avalanche and binance are the only higher ones. And then, of course, Ethereum, it just nails home, I think something that we've been saying.
00:48:52.262 - 00:49:22.954, Speaker B: We expect layer twos like optimism to compete with the alternative layer ones of the world. So it's kind of like an execution layer competition. Here it's salana avalanche versus layer twos. It's really what's going on. And it feels like, because Ethereum is positioning itself as a settlement layer, is something different. It kind of stands on its own. This is part of the reason we've been a little bearish on the alternative layer one narrative.
00:49:22.954 - 00:49:46.710, Speaker B: Not that there won't be other alternative Ethereum chains, of course there will be. But how will they fare in the backdrop of layer twos that are getting usage, getting market share, getting free low cost economic security from Ethereum, and then starting to issue tokens? That'll be the big question. I think that will start to be answered as we go through the rest of 2022.
00:49:46.780 - 00:50:19.646, Speaker A: Optimism's livestream view account, when we did our livestream with them, was our second highest ever after. Mark Cuban this is what happens when you release tokens, you get attention. And we all know that in the crypto space, attention, price follows attention. And tokens will put the attention back onto layer twos retroactive public goods. Because we are funding public goods for not just optimism, not just for Ethereum, but for the whole world, eventually, will eventually push ethereum into mainstream legitimacy and also layer 22. 22 will also lead us into the merge. Ryan I'm just feeling really bullish about the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:50:19.646 - 00:50:22.930, Speaker A: It's because we needed the tokens, the l two tokens all along.
00:50:23.080 - 00:50:55.786, Speaker B: Yeah, I could tell. And I do think the Citizen house is a really unique design and gets us away from the thing that I've been really disturbed with kind of token governance, which is this plutocracy where you basically have token holders and capital holders that set all of the rules. So I'm really hopeful that that will be successful. Other news, I guess, on the Ethereum side is Ridley Scott, his production house. Ridley Scott, director, fantastic movies like Aliens, Gladiator, Blade Runner, that sort of thing. His production house is producing an Ethereum documentary.
00:50:55.898 - 00:51:30.674, Speaker A: Yeah, it's going to be based off of Cami Russo's book, her fantastic book, the infinite machine. And so a great history of Ethereum walks through before Ethereum was even a thing into where it is now. And so I can't think of a better book to base a documentary on. So congratulations to Cammy Russo, a bunch of news that's coming out next week about that. And so I'm just excited to watch it, man. More and like Ryan, there's two other Ethereum documentaries that I know are being worked on, not in secret, but just know they're working on it. And so there's also the era of Ethereum documentaries coming to things like Netflix or whatever other studio.
00:51:30.722 - 00:51:35.894, Speaker B: And this isn't a documentary, right. This is a full scale movie. So they're going to have to actually find actors to play all of these.
00:51:35.932 - 00:51:38.018, Speaker A: Roles, I believe it's going to be a drama.
00:51:38.114 - 00:51:41.754, Speaker B: Yeah. Who's going to play Vitality? This is going to be like the social network. You remember that movie?
00:51:41.802 - 00:51:43.290, Speaker A: Who's going to play Vitalik?
00:51:43.370 - 00:51:49.470, Speaker B: Who's going to play Vitalik? Who's going to play Charles Hodgkinson? Who's going to play Joe Lubin?
00:51:50.290 - 00:51:53.866, Speaker A: So many of these characters are completely irreplaceable.
00:51:54.058 - 00:51:58.526, Speaker B: Really? I can't think of anyone in Hollywood today that could play Vitalik.
00:51:58.558 - 00:51:59.682, Speaker A: Yeah, no, neither could I.
00:51:59.736 - 00:52:02.962, Speaker B: No one pops mine. I get a few for Charles, though. We'll save that for later.
00:52:03.016 - 00:52:05.566, Speaker A: At least a few infuria.
00:52:05.678 - 00:52:35.610, Speaker B: Let's talk about that. It was down last week, last Friday. I believe the PSA here is even when Infuria is down and Metamask doesn't work, there are alternative nodes. And our friend David Mihal has a fantastic website where you can see at any point in time any of the data providers, whether they are serving data or not. And metamask could change your metamass settings and tap into one of these if something like infuria goes down. So not awesome. But we are not fully reliant on infura.
00:52:35.610 - 00:52:52.722, Speaker B: If you're hearing that kind of thing, it's absolute flood. It's not true. Yeah. And you could just prove that by redirecting your node to something else. You can even run your own node and process transactions that way. But let's get to some NFT stuff, David, what's this first one?
00:52:52.776 - 00:53:16.166, Speaker A: Yeah, moonbirds. Kevin Rose's Moonbirds NFT profile picture project. A bird sold for a million dollars within one week of launch. Yeah, they're all owls, called moonbirds. So they're all owls. And the floor price on these things have just left people completely astounded. I think the last I checked it was a 33 ether floor for this profile picture.
00:53:16.166 - 00:53:39.170, Speaker A: NFT. And this just goes and teaches about the power of community. Because this is not just a profile picture project. This is a profile picture for a specific community that is a bunch of highly researched, highly engaged NFT collectors that are here for the long term being stewarded by our friend Kevin Rose. And so it's just a combination of some cool pixel art plus a very powerful community behind it.
00:53:39.320 - 00:54:13.434, Speaker B: Yeah, I can't believe these numbers. But they're also getting some major funding. So Alexis Ohanian's VC firm just announced, along with some others true ventures as well, a $10 million investment into the moonbirds ecosystem. So that happened this week. Also, there was some controversy this week as well. So the moonbird COO, Ryan Carson, announced he was leaving the project, and I think that took some in the community by surprise who thought that Kevin and Ryan, some of the others were in it for the long term. I think Kevin Rose is completely in it for the long term.
00:54:13.434 - 00:54:32.740, Speaker B: All indications point that way. But Ryan Carson left. He's now starting an NFT firm. There was some back and forth about that and some price reaction as well. But I don't know. I feel long term pretty bullish about this project, and I think the team is positioned to execute. I don't know about these valuations, though.
00:54:32.740 - 00:54:52.266, Speaker B: It's really hard to get my head around why moonbirds are worth what they are worth. But when we first had Kevin on the podcast, you could buy a proof pass for, like, a few eth at that time. And now that's gone up massively in value since then and has paid dividends for those who've held it.
00:54:52.368 - 00:54:59.500, Speaker A: This is a bankless curse. We bring people along because, like, yo, this project is really cool. We do a podcast on it, and then we forget to buy stuff.
00:55:00.270 - 00:55:15.646, Speaker B: Every single fan. Yeah. You remember the most painful one is probably what was the most painful one. There's so many in 2020 when we got, like, Nft pilled and you were like, hey, how are NFTs any different from this painting I had? Do you remember that podcast you did?
00:55:15.668 - 00:55:24.946, Speaker A: Of course. Right? We should have used crypto punks as an example. How is it any different from this crypto punk painting that I have on my wall? Two years.
00:55:25.128 - 00:55:27.640, Speaker B: And that's like two years later.
00:55:29.370 - 00:55:59.694, Speaker A: It was nine months. Anyway, I have an answer as to why the floor price has done so well. It's because, Kevin, the proof collective is like this community, bottom up alternative to paid research. Some people, instead of just going and googling and looking at bias research, they pay for research to be done about things. And this feels like that where the community is engaged and the community is serious. And so when that community is successful, Ryan, they all have a bunch of money because they all research stuff together.
00:55:59.812 - 00:56:02.670, Speaker B: That is good. There's such strength in community.
00:56:02.740 - 00:56:12.078, Speaker A: They have so much ammo to pump the bird price for because they all have made each other very wealthy. That is my interpretation of the proof collective.
00:56:12.174 - 00:56:48.414, Speaker B: And you notice I have a bird right behind me. That's because this was given to me. David and I have stepped in, enjoyed as advisors of this project. And I think it's because we saw a lot of parallels with the bankless community and with proof at some level. What proof is doing for nfts is what bankless could do in the future on the Defi side of things with some sort of membership. So there's a lot of commonality, a lot of synergy between these. You know, Kevin asked us to be part of this and we wanted to be because it's a cool experiment that we hope to bring maybe into the bankless ecosystem a little bit more.
00:56:48.414 - 00:57:04.254, Speaker B: Maybe there's some potential for collaboration opportunities. So we'll have to see how that emerges. But the power of strong communities who are super knowledgeable in crypto is just like, that's all you're buying. You're investing in communities at some level, the network effects of communities.
00:57:04.382 - 00:57:26.074, Speaker A: Right? And plus, you can't share Alpha on Twitter because then it's not Alpha anymore. So you got to grow your very specialist network of Alpha. And that's what they've done with nfts. That's what we want to do with Defi. And there's always the power of composable communities. There's a ton of overlap between the bird community, the proof community, and the bankless community. And so we're going to work on the defi side of this whole entire thing.
00:57:26.074 - 00:57:36.270, Speaker A: Listeners or people that are watching on the YouTube drop a comment in the show notes as who's got the better bird? You can see my bird on the left. It's the pink background with the moon hat.
00:57:36.610 - 00:57:40.958, Speaker B: We already know you're only asking that question because you know you got the better bird, that's why.
00:57:41.124 - 00:57:42.640, Speaker A: Yeah, you think I got the.
00:57:43.330 - 00:57:49.198, Speaker B: My bird looks a little angry. When do I get angry, David?
00:57:49.374 - 00:57:50.850, Speaker A: I've never seen you angry.
00:57:51.190 - 00:57:55.474, Speaker B: I just. I don't get angry usually, but this bird is looking.
00:57:55.512 - 00:57:57.990, Speaker A: That bird is not angry, Ryan. That bird is determined.
00:57:58.410 - 00:58:03.606, Speaker B: Thank you. All right. Determined to go bankless. Let's talk about the Solana ecosystem. You got something?
00:58:03.708 - 00:58:16.346, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Solana nfts and crazy NFT drops. Birds are not the only crazy thing happening in nfts. There is. Ok, bears. The new NFT project on Solana beats out all.
00:58:16.346 - 00:58:43.006, Speaker A: Every single one, Ryan. Every single NFT project to ever have day one volume, which is all of them. Ok, bears beats all of them. Be friends is now number two. It got dethroned from number one as the highest NFT project with the most amount of volume coming in at $13 million in 24 hours. Me Bits is now number three at $12 million in 24 hours, followed by what's now number four at invisible friends, at $10 million. Salana and the Salana.
00:58:43.006 - 00:58:52.690, Speaker A: Okay. Bears came in at 18 and a half million dollars in sales inside of the first 24 hours. They look a lot like board apes. They look a lot like board apes.
00:58:52.770 - 00:59:18.698, Speaker B: That's cool. And look, this is bullish, I think, for sole price, because the unit of account and the unit of exchange, the money in the Salana ecosystem is sold. So all of these things are being priced in sols. So that is somewhat bullish. To the extent that souls get used as money in Solana ecosystem, that's monetary premium. Let's talk a little bit about some other news that came out. Openc just acquired Gem.
00:59:18.698 - 00:59:20.010, Speaker B: What is Gem, David?
00:59:20.090 - 00:59:38.206, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a floor sweeper. So if you just don't care about what you buy, but, you know, you want to buy a collection, you can just go to gem, say, I have a five ETH budget, a one eth budget, whatever, a 50 ETH budget, and you could just press buy, and you can just sweep the floor automatedly in an automated fashion. And so now that functionality is part of Openc.
00:59:38.398 - 01:00:04.590, Speaker B: That's a really cool buy and kind of a tuck in acquisition. The trouble with some of that, according to the community, is like, gem users were hopeful that Gem would release a token. And now that they're going into Opensea, that's increasingly unlikely because Opensea has somewhat stated that they're planning to go the IPO route, not go the token route unless forced. So no token, it looks like, for gem, at least in the short run and maybe forever.
01:00:05.170 - 01:00:31.862, Speaker A: Real quickly here, Central African Republic is now accepting bitcoin as legal tender. So we have moved into bitcoin macro adoption news. So another country has adopted bitcoin as a legal tender. And we are also perhaps about to have a third, because if the president of Panama signs it, all that's left is a signature. It will also be become legal tender in Panama. So two big dubs for bitcoin this. Almost two, one for sure.
01:00:31.862 - 01:00:38.646, Speaker A: Almost a second. And so the final step is the presidential signature. And bitcoin can be legal tender in almost three countries by the end of this week.
01:00:38.668 - 01:00:48.650, Speaker B: Ryan, that's crazy that that's happening so quickly. Let's talk regulation. But first, maybe this is not quite regulation. Snowden and Zcash. What's the tie? Yeah.
01:00:48.720 - 01:01:16.862, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's been this anonymous, semi anonymous contributor to Zcash called John Doberton. He was part of the ceremony for launching the Zcash network. We'll get into that in the details. Turns out that was Edward Snowden from Genesis. Turns out Edward Snowden was one of the original signers on the, what do you call it? Trusted setup is what they call got with zero knowledge technology. There's this thing called a trusted setup where a bunch of people come and they participate in this zero knowledge ceremony.
01:01:16.862 - 01:01:52.574, Speaker A: And in order for this to work, one person just needs to permanently destroy their keys. And if one person does it, then this whole thing is completely decentralized. Right? And so the final ceremony, which was held in locations across the world because we're on the Internet, was in October of 2016, and that's where people all destroyed their keys. And again, as long as one of the people destroyed their keys, it works. And everyone has said, like, oh, I destroyed my keys, too. And John Doberton, who was one of the original guys, turns out it was Edward Snowden. Brian, if Edward Snowden told you that he burned his ceremony keys, would you believe him?
01:01:52.692 - 01:01:59.730, Speaker B: Yeah, I think especially in 2016, before any of this stuff was valuable. I mean, the man is principled enough to be, like, extradited from the United States.
01:01:59.800 - 01:02:00.370, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:02:00.520 - 01:02:30.758, Speaker B: Right. I would say there's a high chance of that. And so this is coming out, and this is giving Zcash some additional legitimacy as well and giving them some attention. So it's a cool project, really, like what Zcash is doing. And I'm not sure this will increase their favorability. Not in the market, but also, just like us regulators, they already don't like Snowden. You think this is going to make them excited about Zcash and anonymous cryptocurrency prospects?
01:02:30.854 - 01:02:53.102, Speaker A: That's a good point. That's a good point. That is a coming, just like collision that we know is happening is privacy on blockchains and regulation. Oh, God, here we go. All right, this is coming out of the tron ecosystem. Justin sun. The infinite copycatter has imitated Terra to launch an algorithmic stablecoin USDD on TrON.
01:02:53.102 - 01:03:12.918, Speaker A: And with a reserve of $10 million for the Tron dow, and also has basic interest rate of 30%. So trumping anchor at 20%. Got to be higher, got to be higher. So Tron refuses to be outdone. And so just copying the terror ecosystem once again, the copy kator. Justin sun.
01:03:13.004 - 01:03:36.434, Speaker B: You know, it's a little sad, but the saddest thing of all is that it actually works. It's worked for him in the past. He's just playing the same thing. It could work for him again. All right, last news item, the ECB, some officials gave a speech there, central bankers, of course, for the European Union. I'll just give you the TLDR, but we'll include the link in the show notes. The TLDR is the bankers say crypto is scary and that we should be scared of it.
01:03:36.434 - 01:04:00.474, Speaker B: And what do they say to do about it? Well, inject some additional regulation. This speech goes through four points of that. Number one, they got to treat all crypto like banks. That is the recipe. That is the prescription for fixing crypto. Number two, state surveillance for everything. They want to make sure that they collect all of their taxes, including taxing the hell out of proof of work.
01:04:00.474 - 01:04:14.560, Speaker B: Number three, adding disclosures everywhere. It's interesting is I partially agree with the centralized pieces, but I don't think they're realizing that DeFi has disclosures written into the code. It's all open anyway.
01:04:15.650 - 01:04:16.890, Speaker A: No disclosures.
01:04:17.050 - 01:04:43.906, Speaker B: Exactly. And number four, make everyone basically registered financial advisors. Right. So a lot more disclosures, a lot more certifications. It goes through this in more detail. I've super summarized it, but I feel like this is how to miss the next Internet in four easy steps. Basically, I think central bankers are right after a fashion that crypto and DeFI does need some more regulation and spots.
01:04:43.906 - 01:05:01.098, Speaker B: But if you treat this entire industry just like the traditional banking industry, you'll get what you've already got, which is a broken system that doesn't service the people and services the elite few. That's the end of that. You can read the full report if you want, but we're going to cut to sponsors and then be right back with the takes.
01:05:01.264 - 01:06:01.962, Speaker A: AVe is the leading decentralized liquidity protocol, and now Ave V three is here. Ave V three has powerful new features to enable you to get the most out of DFI, including isolation mode, which allows for many more markets to be launched with more exotic collateral types, and also efficiency mode, which allows for higher loan to value ratios and of course, portals, allowing users to port their AAVE position across all of the networks that AAVE operates on like polygon, phantom, avalanche, arbitrum, optimism, and harmony. The beautiful thing about AAVE is that it's completely open source, decentralized, and governed by its community, enabling a truly bankless future for us all. To get your first cryptocolateralized loan, get started@aave.com. That's aabe.com. And also check out the Ave protocol governance forums to see what more than 100,000 Dow members are all robbing about at governance ave.com. Arbitrum is an Ethereum layer two scaling solution that's going to completely change how we use DFI and nfts over 300 projects have already deployed to arbitrum, and the DFI and NFT ecosystems are growing rapidly.
01:06:01.962 - 01:06:48.400, Speaker A: Some of the coolest and newest NFT collections have chosen arbitrum as their home. All the while, DFI protocols continue to see increased usage and liquidity. Using arbitrum has never been easier, especially with the ability to deposit directly into arbitrum through all the exchanges, including binance, FTX, Huobi, and crypto.com. Once inside, you'll notice arbitram increases Ethereum speed by orders of magnitude for a fraction of the cost of the average gas fee. If you're a developer who wants low gas fees and instant transactions for your users, visit Arbitram IO slash developer to start building your dap on Arbitrum if you're a dgen, many of your favorite dapps on Ethereum are already on Arbitrum, with many moving over every day. Go to bridge Arbitrum IO now to start bridging over your ETH and other tokens in order to experience defi nfts in the way it was always meant to be. Fast, cheap, secure and friction free.
01:06:48.400 - 01:07:25.798, Speaker A: Living a bankless life requires taking control over your own private keys, and that's why so many in the bankless nation already have their ledger hardware wallet. And brand new to the ledger lineup of hardware wallets is the Ledger Nanos Plus, a huge upgrade to the world's most popular hardware wallet. With more memory and a larger screen, the Nanos plus makes it easy to navigate and verify your transactions. And the paired Ledger live desktop app gives you increased transparency as to what is about to happen with your NFT. What you see is what you sign. The Nanos plus gives you the smoothest possible user experience while you're doing all of your crypto things. So go to the Ledger website to check out the features of the new Ledger Nanos plus and join the waitlist to get yours.
01:07:25.798 - 01:07:49.406, Speaker A: And don't forget about the cryptolife card. Also powered by Ledger, the CL card is a crypto debit card that hooks right into the ledger live app, right next to all the defi apps and services that you're already used to doing, like swapping tokens and staking. So if you don't have a ledger hardware wallet, go to ledger.com, grab a ledger and take control over your crypto. Alright guys, home stretch. We're getting into the takes of the week. This one comes from this guy, Ryan Sean Adams.
01:07:49.406 - 01:08:05.382, Speaker A: He says the more toxic the community, the more insecurities is trying to hide. If you were confident in the success of your crypto, you wouldn't be toxic. You're toxic because you're worried. Don't at me, Ryan. I love this take. What inspired this one, man?
01:08:05.436 - 01:08:28.986, Speaker B: I was inspired by toxic communities, David. Like, toxic communities, it's just kind of a pattern. What I mean by toxic communities is just communities that kind of, like, swarm you. They drown out all possible our YouTube logical responses. Right. They call everything fud. They hurl insults without engaging with the argument, and they use, like, swarm techniques.
01:08:28.986 - 01:08:56.802, Speaker B: And often these swarm techniques are pushed down by some sort of occult leader that says, hey, get them, get them. So there are communities like that, and I just kind of identified what the pattern is, and they're all just a little bit scared. They're a little bit worried. It's like a human fear type response. And I think that is the source of this toxicity. If you're confident that X chain is going to dominate, you don't have toxic.
01:08:56.866 - 01:08:57.334, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:08:57.452 - 01:09:09.238, Speaker B: Why do you have to project these insecurities through toxicity? I don't think you have to. I think the quiet, confident chains and communities are the ones that are not worried.
01:09:09.334 - 01:09:37.074, Speaker A: Yeah, that's exactly right. I have so much to say about this, but we'll have to leave that for another day. I thought this take was interesting. This actually is not about crypto, but John Stewart warns that authoritarianism is the greatest threat to comedy as he receives the Mark Twain Humor Prize. The reason why I want to bring this up, Ryan, is because authoritarianism is also perhaps one of the biggest threats to crypto. Authoritarianism is just a threat in general. It's a threat towards expression.
01:09:37.074 - 01:09:58.460, Speaker A: And comedy is an expression of humor and social life and social culture. And crypto, what it is, is a financial expression. We get to express things in the financial ecosystem much more than we previously could, which is a threat to authoritarianism. So, Ryan, authoritarianism, not just a threat to crypto, also to comedy. And I like both of those things.
01:09:59.070 - 01:10:06.590, Speaker B: I agree. If you hear a political take on bankless, it's not going to be right or left. It's going to be anti authoritarian every single time.
01:10:06.660 - 01:10:07.518, Speaker A: 100%.
01:10:07.684 - 01:10:29.190, Speaker B: Let's go to this next one. Look at this very clear divide. This is on crypto Twitter, and you notice two clusters here. One, a cluster is kind of like not NFT, NFT world, I would say. And the other is a cluster of sort of the crypto money type people. And these are these two clusters, and they're living almost like separate lives in different tribes. What do you think of this?
01:10:29.260 - 01:10:52.558, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, on the left you can see the ERC 20 folk, and on the right you can see the ERC 721. That's kind of how I divide these two. There are some people in the middle. I bet I have people like a DC investor would probably find himself in that middle cluster somewhere. The crazy thing is the whole top third of the whole NFT side are board apes. So just like it's showing you how gargantuan the ape community is, which is interesting in of itself.
01:10:52.558 - 01:11:04.042, Speaker A: And also for the podcast listeners, the NFT cluster is like three times larger than the crypto Twitter cluster. And so just showing you how much adoption came in the last year because of nfts.
01:11:04.106 - 01:11:13.118, Speaker B: Oh, I think there's tons of people in the NFT world that have no idea what bankless is. Probably like. No idea. Whereas that would be a bit more rare, I would say, on the crypto Twitter side of things.
01:11:13.204 - 01:11:14.998, Speaker A: Well, you know what, Ryan? We don't know who they are either.
01:11:15.044 - 01:11:29.142, Speaker B: It, that's true. That's why we're in separate clusters somewhat, but it's pretty cool. More surface area. David, this is a take from you. Why don't I read it out? If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. That's not your take.
01:11:29.196 - 01:11:30.626, Speaker A: It's not my take, but I use that in the article.
01:11:30.658 - 01:11:42.602, Speaker B: That's an african proverb or something like this. And that is a shout out to you. And there is a meme that we're looking at. One says EVM equivalents, the other EVM compatibility. Could you explain this meme for us?
01:11:42.656 - 01:12:22.406, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's this concept of a peloton, right? Like, no, not the Silicon Valley like exercise machine. The peloton is like the cluster of bicycles, cycling. When people are racing, they all cluster up, right, to reduce drag. And this is what open source software is. The more open source software contributors you have contributing to the same piece of software, such as the EVM, such as Geth, things go faster, the network effects are shared, because when any other developer contributes something to geth, everyone who's using that geth standard gets to benefit from that. When you fork Geth and turn it into something else, or if you just rebuild something else completely from scratch, you don't get to join in the peloton.
01:12:22.406 - 01:12:58.014, Speaker A: You are bicycling solo. You don't get to draft on anyone. You don't get to drag on anyone. And so you are not in the peloton and the peloton, Ryan, if you're in the middle of a peloton, like in the middle of that very big one, you reduce drag by like five, by 95% at times. So it's basically effortless to keep up with the network effects. Whereas if you have a smaller peloton or if you're just going solo, you have to bicycle, you have to work so much harder than the peloton, so the peloton always wins. And this is a metaphor for open source nature, collaborative nature versus vc backed forks.
01:12:58.014 - 01:13:05.750, Speaker A: And that is the take here. I wrote an entire article on this, which I'm super proud of, actually, on bankless is also a video on the YouTube that you can listen to as well.
01:13:05.900 - 01:13:26.302, Speaker B: I think the big takeaway here is, if you want to understand the EVM, that's the Ethereum virtual machines network effect, read David's article because that spells it out in detail. And I think it's very bullish for the EVM and for Ethereum, so expect nothing less from bankless. A bullish article about Ethereum. David, this is another take. What's this?
01:13:26.356 - 01:14:06.634, Speaker A: Yeah, this is coming from Bartech from layer two beat, where one of my takeaways from ETH, Amsterdam is that everyone is hiring and there's no one left to hire because everyone has gotten hired. So we have an extreme supply glut of talent. So I asked Bartech for somebody because he's looking to hire at layer two b. Bartech, what are you looking for for a prospect at layer two b? And he says, these four things. And if you can do these four things, you can get a job that's like $200,000 plus as an engineer for 50 different companies. So we can make you extremely competitive. And he says, willingness to become an l two expert in the shortest amount of time possible, implying that they're willing to hire people who are unknowledgeable in layer twos but are very, very hungry for it.
01:14:06.634 - 01:14:19.226, Speaker A: Full stack. Typescript, a must web three. Understanding web three. Typescript is a nice to have, plus a passion for exploring the frontiers of the bankless world. Shout out to us, I guess. Thank you. And also excellent communication skills.
01:14:19.226 - 01:14:21.386, Speaker A: So what are you waiting for, is what he asks.
01:14:21.498 - 01:14:24.382, Speaker B: Yeah, get a job in crypto, as we say.
01:14:24.436 - 01:14:29.860, Speaker A: All right, guys, that was all the takes coming in to the final question I've got for you. Ryan, what are you excited about?
01:14:30.310 - 01:14:47.670, Speaker B: I am excited about the permissionless conference, David. Okay, so this is happening. Palm Beach, Florida, two and a half weeks. I can't believe two and a half weeks. We are busy dotting the I's and crossing all of the t's on content. I'm excited about a few mainstage sessions that I'm going to mention. Number one, we're doing this panel with Chris Dixon.
01:14:47.670 - 01:15:11.626, Speaker B: We did the mental models for web three with him. That was like a fantastic podcast. It's number one referenced. Yeah, I think we're going to do some of that. It'll be a repeat of some of that, but also some really new concepts. And Chris Dixon is great on anything, especially in person. We're also doing why we're all here panel with all stars Evan McMullen, Kevin Owaki, Justin Drake, and Mariano.
01:15:11.626 - 01:15:21.410, Speaker B: These are four individuals who are perfectly situated to explain why we're here, like why crypto. And then we are also doing probably my all time favorite podcast. Is it yours, too?
01:15:21.480 - 01:15:22.050, Speaker A: Absolutely.
01:15:22.200 - 01:15:43.130, Speaker B: Okay. The Crypto Renaissance podcast with Josh Rosenthal. We did that episode. Josh Rosenthal is bringing that to life with some new, really interesting additions with a keynote presentation. And that's just day one. What I just said to you is just day one. And also all of the kind of party events and everything that's going on, all the great conversations we're going to have.
01:15:43.130 - 01:15:57.598, Speaker B: Permissionless is going to be awesome. I think there were still tickets left. Maybe not too many, but still a few. This is going to be like Max packed. Sold out 6000 people, 7000 people. Biggest d five conference ever. Really excited to be involved in this one.
01:15:57.684 - 01:16:13.826, Speaker A: Yeah. And for those that haven't listened to the Josh Rosenthal podcast, you do not know what you're missing. And it's absolutely crazy. The number of times I go to a conference and people tell me that that specific episode was what made them drop everything and get it into crypto is like, I haven't been able to count. It's been like 30 or 40 or 50 or something like that.
01:16:13.848 - 01:16:14.466, Speaker B: That's awesome, man.
01:16:14.488 - 01:16:37.130, Speaker A: And the other takeaway from that podcast was that we are speed running the Renaissance renaissance took like 200 years, Ryan, but we are going to compress that amount of time into just like 20 in the crypto renaissance. That's why this whole revolution is so powerful. And it's been over a year since we did that podcast with him. So we have basically like a couple of decades worth of the renaissance to catch up on. So I'm excited to see what Josh Rosenthal has in store.
01:16:37.280 - 01:16:41.962, Speaker B: A few brief centuries have flown by since then. All right, David, what are you excited about, man?
01:16:42.016 - 01:17:01.986, Speaker A: Dude, I'm excited to meet you, man. We got like ten days away before either this whole thing falls apart because we don't like each other, or it just goes just fine. Bankless LLC has an Airbnb where all of us are going to be in the same place for the first time ever and including where I get to meet my co host here.
01:17:02.088 - 01:17:18.662, Speaker B: That's gonna be awesome, man. That's gonna be fun. Yeah, I guess the Bankless podcast hangs on a knife edge. It could go either way. I'm optimistic, though. David, I feel like I have met you. People are blown away that we've actually never met every single.
01:17:18.662 - 01:17:33.690, Speaker B: Like, they're legitimately blown away because I've spent God knows how many hours with you in the metaverse, according to everything. I feel like I know you. I don't know. But look, man, we get in person, something changes. I don't know. Maybe I'm a total jerk and maybe.
01:17:33.760 - 01:17:35.002, Speaker A: You could smell bad.
01:17:35.136 - 01:17:43.520, Speaker B: Yeah, something like this, something could break up the podcast. So, I don't know, maybe the second last roll up, guys, we'll have to see. We'll let you know after the conference how it goes.
01:17:44.050 - 01:17:48.226, Speaker A: You'll see. All right, guys. Ryan, should we get into the meme of the week? Take us there.
01:17:48.248 - 01:17:54.638, Speaker B: Yeah, let's do meme of the week. I'll take you there. So this is, what are we looking at? We're looking at some sort of airdrop metrics, David.
01:17:54.734 - 01:18:24.602, Speaker A: Yeah, this is the optimism airdrop metrics, where, like I said earlier in the show, there are different criteria that you could have met to get different distributions to optimism. So here's the meme version of this. Rug pulled by Andre twice. If you got rug pulled by Andre twice, you got 152,000,000 op. If you're a seed oil eater, which is a deep cut of a reference for crypto, Twitter, you got 420,000 op tokens. If you're a price out of Twitter, you got 100,000. And if you're an Ares sign, you also got 274 op tokens.
01:18:24.602 - 01:18:39.038, Speaker A: Other qualifying things would be donating to Joe Biden's campaign and also an A 16 Z partner. And, yeah, that is the meme of the week. If you had done those things, you would have gotten 6.5 million op tokens. But of course, this is just a meme.
01:18:39.134 - 01:18:51.210, Speaker B: That's a deep cut. Somebody might try that sometime. Guys, of course we have enjoyed being with you. This has been your weekly roll up. Eth is risky. Bitcoin is risky. So is all of crypto, including DFI.
01:18:51.210 - 01:18:59.894, Speaker B: You could definitely lose what you put in, but we are headed west. This is the frontier. It's not for everyone, but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey. Thanks a lot.
