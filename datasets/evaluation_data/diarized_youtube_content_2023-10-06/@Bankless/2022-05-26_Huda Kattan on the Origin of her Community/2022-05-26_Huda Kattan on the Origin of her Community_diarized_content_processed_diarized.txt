00:00:00.090 - 00:00:32.594, Speaker A: What was, like, the origin of the community you've developed and built this relationship with? It's funny because the origin is kind of the same as it still is today. When we started in 2010, it was all about kind of exposing the truth behind photo shoots. I found it so fascinating to see these models pinned up, and everything behind them was, like, clipped, like they weren't so perfect. It was like the front was like a facade, and the behind was something else. And so, as I got into it after, as a makeup artist, that's what I wanted to talk about, so that everybody could know that they could do what they wanted. Like, whatever it was, they were able to have it. What I hear you saying, though, there, that's interesting to me, is I think you're a bit of a contrarian.
00:00:32.594 - 00:00:53.180, Speaker A: It's, like, 100% telling me that this is what you should see. So I'm going to show you the thing over here. I'm a rebel, but that's the early adopter thing, too. And I think something before women who I think are trained more like, think this way, do this thing. To kind of almost practice being a contrari. If you want to be in this space early, you're going to have to push yourself. Yeah.
