00:00:08.330 - 00:00:38.742, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We've got Primo Raz and Zero X Maki with us. Hope everybody's great today. Super excited here about layer zero launch. And some of you have heard the Stargate token launches happening as well. So, yeah, thanks, guys, for coming on here. Really just want to start off with telling us a little bit about how the development process here has gone with layer Zero and just kind of talk about a little bit of that stuff.
00:00:38.742 - 00:00:51.680, Speaker A: So, yeah, Primo, Roz, if you guys don't mind kicking it off here, just give us a little what's up? And, yeah, give us some color here on the development process here with layer zero and everything that's gone on.
00:00:52.370 - 00:00:53.760, Speaker B: All you if you want to take.
00:00:56.930 - 00:02:10.614, Speaker C: We had actually, I don't know if you guys know. We started building the core protocol of layer zero back in March. And even though layer Zero was done this summer, we have spent an ungodly amount of hours testing and just making it as more efficient as possible. The most efficient piece of code, we think, out there, it's like 795 lines of code, down from a couple of thousand gas savings. We've cut it more, I guess, both sides almost in half, and reduced the service area of attack to almost nothing. This code is pretty much as good as it gets for messaging, and we're super proud of it. And on top of that, we also built Stargate, which we've simulated millions of messages, millions of transactions, have a huge, robust test suite that I guess, the twelve audits that we've had thus far between Stargate and layer zero, all the auditors have said how pretty much amazing our coverage is, and the full end to end testing that we do.
00:02:10.614 - 00:02:46.126, Speaker C: It's not just about the 100% line coverage that we achieve on the core code, but also the full end to end spectrum of trying every permutation and the simulations and everything, just because this has to be perfect. And we really think it is. On top of that, we had one of our files yesterday, which is funny. In layer zero had 99.96 or something percent coverage. And Riley, a shout out to Riley. He could not live with that one line of code not covered.
00:02:46.126 - 00:03:41.358, Speaker C: So he wrote a piece of code that simulated and edited the memory to get it to a state where it could hit this line, because otherwise we'd have to run like, 10,000 transactions. And to do that in a hard hat and run it and simulate that, it would just take a long time to run those tests. So he managed, manipulated the memory to get it to that state to hit that test, and he's going to push that later to get the full 100% because he just couldn't live with that. And that's just kind of like how this team is where we just want everything to be perfect. And kind of like our motto that has been instilled in Caleb, Brian and I since we started working together at a college is better is better. And that's just kind of sticking to that. The whole team is really bought into better is better, and that means we ship the best product we can with no compromise.
00:03:41.534 - 00:04:01.254, Speaker A: Yeah, amazing. And that's what's really important throughout all this. And it's cool to hear about just that perfection aspect of things, too. So that's where we're headed. But I don't know, Primo, if you've got anything else to add to that and maybe even just talk a little bit about the development process here, even over the past couple few months and just how that's all gone with the team.
00:04:01.292 - 00:04:29.026, Speaker B: And I mean, I think the dev process is super fun. It's pretty unique. If anybody read the thread, like you saw I mentioned, we're all just like locked in a room in the Bahamas. And so we have 20 ish, I think 20 out of 24 people right now here locally with us. And so when we came out here, I think 70% of us were meeting for the very first time. And I've worked remote my entire life. Right.
00:04:29.026 - 00:04:53.002, Speaker B: Like my last 15 years, I've never been in an office. We have a small hut, we call it. It's basically like a small office. You can maybe fit 30, 40 people in Max. And we have just been in here every day. Most people come in at nine, they leave at 10:00, 11:00 at night. And it's just kind of been that for two straight months to just kind of this coalescence of everything getting us here.
00:04:53.002 - 00:05:37.960, Speaker B: I think the broad dev process is like anything else. You start with architecture, you try to make the best possible architecture. Everybody argues and fights about it, and you get a lot of really good conversations, just like trying to get to ground truth, right? Like, you try to break everything, you try to. What is the most hardened possible way that you can make something? How can you break it? How can you make it better? How can you make it the easiest possible thing to build upon and then post that is just like implementing. It's like Ryan said, it's optimizations around the core code. It's getting UI in a state where everybody's happy with, and it's just like getting all of these people all together to be really bought into the same thing. And I think that's like the most fun part of it by far.
00:05:38.970 - 00:05:58.160, Speaker A: Yeah, incredible, incredible. It's been quite an experience. And yeah, really excited with the team. And speaking of which, here, just as of yesterday, the full announcement for Zero X Machi. Hey, thank you so much. It's so cool you've joined the team. And yeah, I guess welcome.
00:06:03.850 - 00:06:05.830, Speaker D: Thank you. Thank you, sir. Tango.
00:06:07.210 - 00:06:10.746, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess listening to Raz, by.
00:06:10.768 - 00:06:54.070, Speaker D: The way, Primo, I'm not sure if you get the vibe of what type of individual I'm working with here. People that don't take compromise, just a light touch or anything like this. You need to have something perfect, otherwise it's just not going to go true. And the most impressive thing is, I remember we were kind of debating on the aspect of bridging only USDC over a bunch of these chains. And of course, the truth is there is multiple flavor of stable coins. So what they did is literally wrote a new model in less than a day, I think. I'm not sure how much time it took you to get this contract done, but it was extremely fast when we raised the flag about this problem.
00:06:54.070 - 00:07:00.860, Speaker D: So that was incredible. Just like a side note of this past two months in the biomass, it was great.
00:07:01.870 - 00:07:11.440, Speaker A: Yeah. That's so impressive. So impressive. So, Maki, just wanted to ask you too, how did you first find out about layer zero and what was that like?
00:07:13.730 - 00:08:26.542, Speaker D: Kind of started, like I said in the Twitter tribe yesterday, like in September, I guess after kind of this whole kind of sushi thing, was thinking, what should I be doing next? Of course, like taking a little bit of rest and kind of doing an introspection. What did I do wrong? What did I do good, et cetera, et cetera, led me to think about, I've always been a very big multichan advocate since you can dig up my post in September 2020 about the fact that sushi was not going to stay only on Ethereum, was going to go on polka dot, was going to go on a bunch of other places, et cetera. And after kind of doing all these deployments, we realized, well, this is great, but at the same time, we are running low on incentives. We are also fragmenting all of this. The UX is pretty horrible, just like the time it takes to bridge over the security concern. This is back in the days when avalanche, for example, was running a very bad bridge with only like a multi save. Now they improved a little bit, but all this canonical bridge to me are a little bit worrying.
00:08:26.542 - 00:08:42.874, Speaker D: Same for polygon. Even very recently, we saw kind of optimism. Someone declared, kind of uncovered Nissan's on it, where they could have mint infinite amount of optimist ETH, and so on and so on.
00:08:42.912 - 00:08:46.346, Speaker B: So it was kind of from where.
00:08:46.368 - 00:09:51.566, Speaker D: I started, and then I kind of sat down, I looked into conics, I kind of went through the whole kind of ten transaction signatures, which were a little bit horrible, to be honest with you. There was then, of course, there was synapse. Synapse got exploded by on binance at some point. It was an arbitrage, but still doesn't seem very safe. So actually, where I kind of dabbled into, I felt like, well, it's very interesting to have all these yield opportunities across all these planes, but definitely we haven't found kind of the silver bullet for this problem. So I started to dig more and more, and ultimately I met with raz and Primo. I think after two or 3 hours of discussing, I didn't necessarily jump in all hands, but I actually went to Liscon, went to Portugal, and I spoke with other people I met actually, like some of the other bridge builders, some anons, some non anons, and kind of debated inside and said, well, this seems to be like the best team.
00:09:51.566 - 00:09:55.186, Speaker D: This seems to be solving the problem the way I see it, which should.
00:09:55.208 - 00:09:57.762, Speaker B: Be like a one transaction, should be.
00:09:57.816 - 00:10:17.900, Speaker D: Extremely cost efficient, like low gas fees and so on. And yeah, that's kind of the whole kind of topo and from there started to get involved. I was actually joined the team as I think number four or five, not sure RaSm or Primo could probably.
00:10:20.190 - 00:10:20.506, Speaker B: Can.
00:10:20.528 - 00:10:46.740, Speaker D: Rectify, but basically, and then we grew to basically, over the past three months, to more than 20. So it's been an extremely quick journey. Yeah, that's kind of the whole kind of topic. And now today that we're seeing layer zero live, with Stargate being enabled in the next 48 hours, that's where I think everyone is going to realize why I decide to get implicated, contribute, and basically be part of the team.
00:10:47.110 - 00:11:21.180, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Thank you so much for unpacking all of that. That's amazing to see, just to see what you see within the ecosystem and how this is going to help so much and the problems that it solves and just removing those pain points, I mean, that's what we're seeing here so far. But I guess with layer zero going live here, this is maybe more for Roz and Primo here. What can people expect and kind of like, what can they build on top of. Or how can they get involved and things like that with layer zero now.
00:11:21.790 - 00:11:56.994, Speaker B: Yeah. So, I mean, I think the biggest thing has always been like, okay, we have. Even when we announced months ago we had a ton of external interest, people are very clearly, it resonated with people. You can see it, like, we tweeted one time and we had like 45,000 followers on Twitter or something. It was very clear that this was an issue to solve and people are very interested and they cared a lot about. And so we've talked a ton to basically every team at this point. And it's really just been about, get out there, show that it, like, we always wanted to launch with something flagship.
00:11:56.994 - 00:12:27.378, Speaker B: So Stargate is that thing. It is this proof of concept that everybody can see working at scale, at large scale. It solves a really key issue with liquidity transfer between chains and applications, trying to build on top. And then now I think it's sort of like up to everybody else to see all of the cool things. The things we had in mind very early on were like, unified governance was absolutely one. You have, these projects are deploying on tons of chains. You have tokens that live on tons of chains, but you can only do voting from one.
00:12:27.378 - 00:13:04.830, Speaker B: So, like, unified on chain governance. Dexes, like swaps across chains are so intuitive. Bridges are so intuitive. Absolutely. Lending protocols where it's very clear that you want to collateralize, let's say, your ETH on Ethereum, and then just borrow directly on the destination chain. So, like all of existing Defi, as they start to move to other chains, as they want to expand their reach, kind of the largest projects and the best projects, we want them to be able to do this kind of seamlessly and not this piecemeal fashion where you'll have ten outposts and none of them will be connected. And they're basically independent, but with limited rewards.
00:13:04.830 - 00:13:55.120, Speaker B: So from that perspective, I expect you will see lots and lots of sort of key d five pieces starting to move in that direction. And then since we announced we had almost 50% of our inbound was gaming and NFTs, which was totally not something I expected early on. There has been such a huge presence from that industry and being able to do things, whether it's. Everybody has seen axe go to Ronan, right? So they live, like, between Ronin and east. Everybody. Now, you see this with avalanche subnets, you see with lots of sort of other areas where the prospect of having your gameplay on one chain and having other things resolve others, whether you have your gameplay live multiple places or maybe you're on a fast chain and I don't want to call out any specific project. So let me think.
00:13:55.120 - 00:14:31.046, Speaker B: Let's say you're playing a game with bears and bears or whatever. There's this whole game around it and that lives on some chain that's fast. Well maybe you have like a bear cave that lives on Ethereum. And so you can do a thousand clicks and 100 hours of playing this game on one chain and then you can mutate or impact that game state on another chain and you can do things that kind of resonate there. You have marketplaces there. You can now start trading NFT marketplaces across wallet integrations across every chain. There's all of this stuff that is such a natural progression.
00:14:31.046 - 00:15:25.930, Speaker B: Wallets is like another super obvious one. But I think what you'll really see is you'll see everything start to move in that direction and you'll also see the way that applications are designed change. I think there's a huge space for design space to change where now everything is written. Like you'd write an application in the early web, right? You write like one single contract, you'd write an application, it would live on a computer and you'd host it in your house or you'd put it in a rack in a data center and they were all single server applications. But now application design is really complex and so now you can have chains that are hyper optimized for storage or throughput and you can do really interesting things where you can offload really complex computation to the throughput chain and you can have all your storage on the other chain and you can have entire designs that we've never seen before be played around with now. And I think that's super fascinating.
00:15:27.790 - 00:15:57.622, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. You just showcase what's all unlocked here and what's totally possible. So this is super exciting and I can hear it in your guys'voices, how enthusiastic you are. And just seeing the progression over the past weeks and months has been incredible. Just going back over towards Stargate now. We do have the launch auction coming up here right away. So yeah, I guess just a little bit for people on that we can kind of talk about that.
00:15:57.622 - 00:16:18.350, Speaker A: Just starting Thursday at twelve eastern time is the launch auction. And that will be 25 million will be up for contribution. Razor Primo there.
00:16:20.640 - 00:17:02.756, Speaker B: Yeah. So Stargate auction starts tomorrow. And so basically the goal of tomorrow for the protocol is really protocol and liquidity. The point of Stargate is if you're a yield aggregator, right? You really want to focus on two contract interactions, you want to unstake some dollars or tether from chain A and stake it on chain B, you don't really want to reinvent. How the heck do I get this tether from chain A to chain B? Do I send my user away to some external bridge? Do I have a wrap synthetic? Do I do all of this? And so Stargate's goal is to just abstract that away completely. Now the application simply unstakes here, composes Stargate stakes there. And from the user perspective, it's one flow.
00:17:02.756 - 00:17:55.324, Speaker B: They click one single time. They don't need to have the destination asset, they don't need to think about anything else. And you're magically now farming in the other farm. So you think about how powerful that is both for the yield aggregator wallet, for the yield aggregator and for the wallet who lives on top, who wants to make this really easy, where like, okay, now the user can jump between 20 farms on eight chains and they don't need to think at all about what the underlying gas asset is, what chain they're on, anything, right? All of that can be fully abstracted away in the same way a Dex A, Dex wants to swap on chain A and swap on chain B. And if they need to reinvent this liquidity transfer portion in the middle, that becomes like a really high burden. There's just so much complexity there that gets added in. But now if you take something like, I'll use sushi swap as an example, right? It was deployed on 14 plus chains at this point, but you can't swap between them.
00:17:55.324 - 00:18:24.304, Speaker B: Well, now sushi on chain a can right? The interaction for sushi to integrate now across layer zero and Stargate and be multichain and have multichain swaps is literally wrap your two sushi contracts, compose Stargate, done. So sushi on chain a gets in ETH, let's say, and spits out USDC. The USDC has taken and moved across Stargate. All messaging risk, all liquidity risk. All liquidity lives within Stargate. Sushi on chain B gets in, USDC spits out asset X. That's also atomic.
00:18:24.304 - 00:18:57.680, Speaker B: That's exactly how sushi works now. So now for sushi to go multi chain in this fashion, it's literally zero changes to core protocol, zero liquidity to put up zero incentives to provide the liquidity. There is nothing at all that they need to do from a development standpoint other than wrap these contracts, compose Stargate, and it's a pull request into the UI, right? And so that, I think is hugely powerful when you're talking about top down adoption of existing DeFi protocols. And how you get that adoption, how you most easily enable them to become multi chain immediately by retrofitting kind of past structures.
00:18:58.660 - 00:19:01.920, Speaker D: And this fits in how many lines of codes, by the way, Primo.
00:19:02.340 - 00:19:09.910, Speaker B: It's an incredibly small line of code. Ryan can say specifically, but I think when we did the demo, it was like, what was it, 30 or something? It's like a very.
00:19:12.120 - 00:19:12.880, Speaker D: Configuration.
00:19:12.960 - 00:19:24.996, Speaker C: It's actually on the docs, I can find a link. We actually posted it so you can see it. So anybody can actually deploy that once Stargate is live tomorrow. So you can deploy that and have that up immediately.
00:19:25.188 - 00:19:41.884, Speaker B: Yeah. And so then to talk about. I know tangle, you're asking about the auction specifically. So it's set up in a couple of phases. The first phase is the auction. USDC comes in, there's a cap of 25 million USDC Stargate tokens go out. So let's assume we hit the cap.
00:19:41.884 - 00:20:11.936, Speaker B: So 25 million USDC comes in, that's going to set the 100 million tokens that are going out to the purchasers at token. And those 100 million tokens are just 10% of the total supply. Those are frozen for twelve months and then unlocked over six months linearly. Then 50 million tokens. So 5% of the supply and the 25 million USDT is put up in the protocol. On a dex, there's protocol and liquidity. So now Stargate, the protocol owns this.
00:20:11.936 - 00:20:42.108, Speaker B: There's now $50 million of liquidity that's sitting in a curve V two pool that anybody can go and buy from or sell into. Right? So that exists still at this point. There are no tokens in circulation other than this 5% that live within the decks. Then we open up the bonding curves. So bonding curves run from. Again, it's two x, whatever the price was at the auction. Remember, the auction has this twelve month freeze and six month linear unlock, so it's a two X price jump, but the tokens are immediately liquid.
00:20:42.108 - 00:21:05.796, Speaker B: So the bonding curves, assuming the auction is sold out, will start at. They'll run to three X that price. So to a dollar 50, this is linear price. So the first token will be fifty cents. The midpoint token of all tokens on the curve will be a dollar, and the last token would be a dollar 50. Right? So that's how the price increase works. This will be on all seven chains at once, plus the pools that are enabled.
00:21:05.796 - 00:21:36.464, Speaker B: So some will have USDC, some will have USDT, some will have both. And so what will happen is anybody can purchase off the bonding curve. If the bonding curve, they can always look for the best price, right? There'll be all these curves around. You can say, oh, actually, it might be $0.80 on Ethereum, but it's only $0.67 on avalanche or on optimism, and you can even jump over Stargate. I'm going to take my USDC, move it over Stargate to this chain, and I'm going to take it off that bonding curve, and then the Dex as well.
00:21:36.464 - 00:22:26.604, Speaker B: Right? There'll be this kind of stagger step function between the Dex and the bonding curves, where maybe you can get it from the bonding curve at x price, and the dex is lower, the dex is higher, and so there's all this interaction between it. But the goal of this is, like, efficient price discovery, rather than just having some insane mechanic on where price goes. This is like pretty healthy and efficient price discovery. And all of the liquidity, every single USDC or USDT or whatever it is that's contributed to this, goes directly into the protocol. So it goes to LP, the Stargate pools, to create protocol owned liquidity with the pools, which will generate fees, which, again, will be retained in the protocol. So none of this goes to the team, none of this goes to anybody else. It's 100% owned by the protocol.
00:22:26.604 - 00:23:11.724, Speaker B: And the goal of it is actually to make the protocol efficient. Right? Because you can rent liquidity, but renting liquidity is extremely expensive. You can have a million tokens, and maybe you attract a huge amount of liquidity, a billion dollars of liquidity. But when you're done, your million tokens, what happens then? Nobody's incentivized to keep the liquidity anymore. And that's a really big risk to protocols building on top of it, because what do they do? Because they've built and kind of established this strategy on top of you, but now you can't attract liquidity anymore. So the focus being on protocol owned liquidity, that means longevity for every application who's ever built upon Stargate, it means permanent liquidity that can be used across Stargate forever. And it means that, again, all of the fees also accrue, like a portion of the fees of the LP fee, because the protocol owns, some of the LP accrues the protocol.
00:23:11.724 - 00:23:24.020, Speaker B: So there will be rented liquidity, there'll be emissions. People can stake and farm and do that early on, but the goal, over time, is to grow the protocol on liquidity and be the deepest pools of liquidity across all chains, across all applications.
00:23:25.000 - 00:23:58.396, Speaker A: Amazing. Yeah. Thank you for unpacking all of that. Hopefully that gives everyone a really solid explanation of how this is all going to work and how Stargate is planning to work into the future as well. Some of you may need to go back and listen to that. So I hope this is going to be recorded and is live streaming to YouTube, so you'll be able to check all that out afterwards. But one key thing that I wanted to point out there, which is super cool, is that as these bonding curves are going on, Stargate will be live, you will be able to use it, you will be able to bridge between networks.
00:23:58.396 - 00:24:15.510, Speaker A: So as you see, as you pointed out, if there was a cheaper, it was cheaper to bond over on a different chain, you will be able to do that, you will be able to experience how it works. And yeah, we're super excited to get people using it. So that's super cool.
00:24:15.880 - 00:24:30.048, Speaker D: A small detail I think Primo didn't touch on. I think everything that is going to be on the bonding curve is going to be available directly for the person pledging compared to the initial auction, public auction.
00:24:30.244 - 00:24:42.560, Speaker B: Yes, that's exactly right. So only the auction has that twelve month lock, six month linear unlock, everything else, there's no freeze, there's no lock. Everything is immediate.
00:24:45.540 - 00:25:04.644, Speaker A: Yeah. Amazing. So that starts tomorrow at twelve noon eastern time. So the auction will start at that point and yeah, people will be able to start contributing there and then the bonding curves will go live right after.
00:25:04.762 - 00:25:31.212, Speaker B: For Stargate itself, none of it is going to team, right. It's all within the protocol. It's all meant to be in the protocol. The auction is actually open. The auction is totally open. The bonding curves themselves are totally open. We thought part of it is a resource constraint side where we could implement these, let's say a max per person.
00:25:31.212 - 00:25:59.620, Speaker B: Right. But what's going to happen is all of the people who are good at programming, they're just going to civil that they're going to make 1000 accounts and they're all going to do this. It's very hard to create pretty reasonable constraints that can't be gamed. And so for us, we thought the most egalitarian thing is just make it open. Everybody's going to know the block, everybody's going to have the ability to pre approve. So while it's not up now, prior to the auction, there'll be this period of time where everybody can just pre approve the contract on the site. Everybody can be ready waiting for that block.
00:25:59.620 - 00:26:08.104, Speaker B: And the auction will happen and everyone will have the open chance to get in. We'll see how long it lasts, whether it's one block or multiple blocks or whatever.
00:26:08.222 - 00:26:26.704, Speaker A: Cool. Well, yeah. Looking really forward to that. If anybody has questions, of course you can reach out in discord or we do have the telegram open as well. But yeah, keep bringing your questions in there. But I don't know, you guys good with bringing up a couple of people? I've seen some hands up here. Do we have time for a couple of calls or.
00:26:26.704 - 00:26:27.744, Speaker A: Sorry, a couple of questions?
00:26:27.782 - 00:26:29.520, Speaker B: Absolutely. 100%.
00:26:29.670 - 00:26:32.640, Speaker A: Here we've got Dub Spencer.
00:26:35.140 - 00:26:35.676, Speaker C: If you've.
00:26:35.708 - 00:26:58.952, Speaker A: Got that, I'll bring up a couple of people at a time here just in case you are unable to. If your microphone's not working. I know that happens with some people, but dub Spencer, romance rack maybe. I don't know if nothing's coming up there yet. Yes, we got here. Vornaclex. Yeah.
00:26:58.952 - 00:27:00.970, Speaker A: Vorna clicks. You got something for us?
00:27:03.020 - 00:27:03.432, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:03.486 - 00:27:22.370, Speaker C: So thanks for having me up. Looking forward to this launch. I did hear Maki mention something about KyC and it wasn't quite answered. And just to latch onto that one, if there is no Casey, what's the antibody framework that you guys have going on.
00:27:28.120 - 00:27:44.590, Speaker D: Here? I can just repeat what primal said. So there's going to be no antibody. Everything is going to go. You will be able to basically ape in like everyone else, going to be able to pre approve and basically going to be more fair. That's kind of where we stand on this.
00:27:46.560 - 00:28:25.412, Speaker B: Yeah. Just to mirror that on the bot side, I think, again, bots, like there's one block period, right? So it's going to be in the first 13 seconds. Everybody will basically have that period to submit a transaction. I think there are some ways you can get advantage or not, but I think anything you make, let's say we set even a really egregiously low cap, like, I don't know, $500 cap per person, right? Something like that. Per wallet. It's so easy programmatically to make a script that just basically exploits that. So what you do is you make it so the individual person who's doing this manually is clicking is at a huge disadvantage.
00:28:25.412 - 00:29:03.060, Speaker B: The more you do that, the more advantageous that it becomes to do things programmatically. And the more basically of an issue that becomes, in my opinion, I think is like the more of the overall percentage right now. Everybody has the opportunity to pick whatever amount they want, submit with Max gas, submit whatever, and basically just be in that block. The block number will be published ahead of time. Everybody will be able to approve ahead of time. So bots doing, like, where they approve and buy in one transaction is like an advantage they would get over a regular user if it was basically done in that manner. So all of this is meant to be like, as egalitarian as possible as, like, here's the block.
00:29:03.060 - 00:29:32.510, Speaker B: Pick the gas, pick the amount. Just like a pure auction. And basically the auction is on gas at this point. If it goes super fast, what are people willing to pay for gas and what does that look like? I have no idea what the outcome of that will be. Again, this is why the bonding curves are kind of the non locked alternative that will be everywhere. And that, I think, maybe will be a little bit less insane early on.
00:29:38.000 - 00:29:39.660, Speaker C: All right, thanks for answering.
00:29:42.400 - 00:29:53.724, Speaker A: Awesome, thank you. Okay, next up, we've got. See late. Somebody here I'm going to bring up late and Zulian. Yeah, late.
00:29:53.772 - 00:29:54.080, Speaker B: Hey.
00:29:54.150 - 00:29:55.410, Speaker A: Hi there. How are you?
00:29:56.180 - 00:30:25.160, Speaker E: I'm good. Thanks for picking me for the Q A. I have two questions. First is regarding Stargate. So basically, I see that Stargate is a product made by layer zero lab. And we can also see from the Internet that layer zero lab just raised a billion dollar valuation round. So is the start like, layer zero also plan to launch a token sometime in the future or.
00:30:25.160 - 00:30:30.076, Speaker E: There is no plan right now. If we can throw some light on that, that will be great.
00:30:30.258 - 00:31:21.288, Speaker B: Yes, sure. Absolutely. So I think I'm potentially a little bit limited about what exactly I can say. What I can say is that always from the beginning, we thought, despite layer zero labs developing both, that it sets a very bad tone. If any individual application doesn't matter what it is, it doesn't matter. The largest DeFi application now something we built in house or something the smallest team is building. If anybody is given any advantage at the layer zero protocol level, then basically everything is basically, I don't know, some cesspool of nepotism, right? So we thought there was no world in which it would make sense to say, incentivize Stargate out of resources of layer zero, the protocol, because not every application building is going to be able to have that same advantage.
00:31:21.288 - 00:31:54.150, Speaker B: And so for us, Stargate, the economics of Stargate, all of that are kept completely separate from the economics of layer zero. Stargate is really meant to be a key. The way we think about it is this sort of like key, composable sort of money Lego that sits in the middle, that adds this liquidity transfer layer across all of existing defi. And it's built on top of layer zero. And it clearly is going to drive a lot of value to layer zero and the layer zero ecosystem. But the individual economics are both are meant to be completely separate. So hopefully that answers it.
00:31:54.520 - 00:32:12.300, Speaker E: Yeah, just a follow up question. Just a small follow up question. So in the tokenomics of the Stargate, correct me if I'm wrong, there's a 17% reserve for investors, private investors. So is that round already done, or is this going to layer zero private investors?
00:32:16.000 - 00:32:55.610, Speaker B: Again, I'm a little bit bound about what I can say. You'll hear a lot about this in sort of like the coming weeks. Layer Zero Labs is the entity, is the entity that raised right, that went through the fundraising event and layer zero labs, both layer zero and Stargate as subproducts. So you can assume that equity holders in the equity company, that anything like that kind of went to all of the underlying layer zero lab products. But again, you'll hear more about this later. My hands are a little bit tied at the moment, so hopefully that gives you enough.
00:32:56.640 - 00:33:25.090, Speaker E: Yeah, just like, last question. It's a technical, from the technical side and more towards basically just to develop perspective. So I'm fairly new to basically bridges, but I understand programming. I've been a programmer my entire life and I've been very active on the cosmos ecosystem. So will this be right to say that layer zero actually is bringing IBC to entire chains where it is not possible?
00:33:25.780 - 00:34:08.332, Speaker B: Yes. So IBC, at its core is a messaging standard. The goal of IBC is, with any messaging standard, is, hey, it's very easy when you write your own application, to just say, this is how I'm going to pack the bytes, and this is how I'm going to unpack the bytes on the other side. This is how I'm going to interpret that. But when you have a lot of applications that are all communicating with each other, now you run into this issue of, well, everybody's going to do this the same way, because everybody needs to know how to interpret this. Right? So IBC as a messaging standard was meant effectively to solve that, they reinvented this transport protocol like, they made their transport protocol that is running on chain like clients within the tenderman system. We have talked very closely with the Cosmos team, huge fans of IBC.
00:34:08.332 - 00:34:24.580, Speaker B: We published this article on building IBC on top of layer zero as a transport layer. And so that's exactly right. We'll be building IBC, the messaging standard, on top of layer zero, and that will be connecting everywhere. Right. So you'll be able to use the IBC messaging standard on every chain effectively.
00:34:25.960 - 00:34:33.720, Speaker E: And there will be decentralized, like who will run this relays? Like, will this be run by layer zero lab only or you will bring value?
00:34:33.790 - 00:35:02.256, Speaker B: No. 100%. So both the oracles and relayers are completely open and permissionless systems. Anybody can run them, anybody can participate in those. But it's different than most systems is it's up to the applications to actually delegate who they want to use. Right. So, like a small application might say, okay, you know what, I'm 100% fine externalizing this risk pricing it and saying, maybe chain link is my oracle and Coinbase is my relayer, and I'll externalize that.
00:35:02.256 - 00:35:37.420, Speaker B: And basically, I'm okay with the assumption that both chain link and Coinbase will not be simultaneously malicious and colluding against me. Right. Maybe that's a risk that as a small application, I'm willing to price, and for a very large application, they might run their own relayer. And when they do that, even if 100% of other network participants are 100% malicious, nothing matters unless they're colluding against themselves, which they obviously will never do. There is nothing that anybody else can do to impact it. So there's no civil, there's no BFT, there's no consensus being actively formed. But a relayer and an oracle can both look like anything.
00:35:37.420 - 00:36:14.004, Speaker B: They can be very broad and distributed systems, and it's sort of up to the people operating them to structure them however they want. And this can be existing systems as well. Right. You could have like a transaction going from Solana to Cosmos, and the oracle is the complete set of Solana validators, and the relayer is like the complete set of tenderament validators. Right? There's a world where that's what that structure looks like, and it's really about what does the application want to price on this sort of Pareto frontier of cost and security. And so moving all of that up the stack to the application layer is, we think, hugely important. So the example I always give is you have two applications.
00:36:14.004 - 00:36:37.040, Speaker B: One of them is validating on chain B that it owns a copper sword in a game on chain A, and the other is transferring $500 million. Right. In which world should those both be opting into the same set of security hyperparameters? Either somebody is wildly overpaying for security, or somebody is not getting nearly enough security. And so for us, all of that moves up the stack and sort of applications are able to make those decisions.
00:36:38.260 - 00:36:44.580, Speaker E: Got it. Thanks a, really, really excited for this. Thanks a lot.
00:36:44.730 - 00:36:45.828, Speaker B: Amazing. Absolutely.
00:36:45.994 - 00:36:57.992, Speaker A: Thanks late. Thank you very much. Okay, we've got Zulian, I think yeah, probably be our last question here as well. So go ahead, Zulian, and thanks for taking the time.
00:36:58.046 - 00:37:28.850, Speaker F: Sorry, didn't mean to cut you off. I guess the question is, how can the average participant right now get involved? One. And then could you kind of compare the differences on layer zero to something like thorchain that has, I guess, the cross chain exchanges? Are you saying the main difference is that you can actually interact with kind of a cross chain contract? Would that be kind of the biggest difference or unique take?
00:37:29.380 - 00:37:35.620, Speaker B: So just to be clear, there's a question. How is layer zero different or how is stargate different? Well, both.
00:37:35.690 - 00:37:46.390, Speaker F: Yeah, I guess Stargate and layer zero are bringing kind of slightly different things, but they are built on. Well, Stargate is built on layer zero, so how would those kind of be?
00:37:47.560 - 00:38:05.468, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So, thorchain, right? Thorchain is a Dex. It's meant to take a native asset from one chain and swap it to another chain. And they do this by sort of like a pegging structure with rune. So maybe you have bitcoin paired to rune, and then you also have ETH paired to rune. And so now you can go bitcoin to rune and like, rune to ETH. Okay, totally fine.
00:38:05.468 - 00:38:22.960, Speaker B: That's a Dex structure. It's meant to swap different assets across different chains. And that's like a Dex is super useful. I think we've all seen that's incredibly useful. Layer zero itself is a core messaging primitive. It's not a bridge, it's not a Dex, it's not any of these things. Right? Those are things that would be built on top of layer zero.
00:38:22.960 - 00:38:52.136, Speaker B: So use cases of layer zero might be like, oh, hey, you're a lending protocol. Rather than I collateralize ETH on ethereum, I have to borrow, I go to some external bridge, I bridge, I pay a fee, I swap to the native asset. I farm, I swap back, I bridge back, I paid two more fees, I repay my loan, I take back my collateral. Now, with layer zero, you can collateralize like ETH on Ethereum. Send a message to the destination chain. That confirms it. You borrow directly there, farm, repay message comes back, collateral is unlocked.
00:38:52.136 - 00:39:41.544, Speaker B: Right? That's generic messaging between voting across chain, where you basically create contracts that can vote across any chain, making right now you have applications where you're ave or whoever. And if you want to go to another chain, most people are relying on external bridges, which means if you have like, five different bridges, you're going to get five different wrapped synthetics of your token on the other chain that has no voting rights. It has no custom functionality. Like if your token is rebasing or token has any sort of unique functionality within it, all of that is stripped out. You're getting issued like a vanilla ERC 20 or SPL 20 on the other side with generic messaging. Now, applications can do that directly. There is no need to pay 6810 bips to some external bridge and get a wrapped token on the other side for your users.
00:39:41.544 - 00:40:18.708, Speaker B: Now, your contract itself can just confirm, like, hey, I've locked here, I've burnt here some number of tokens minted on that chain. So all of that, basically you get to save your users from and have ultimate ownership on your tokens on the other side. But yeah, with the generic messaging primitive, you can build anything. You can build again, Dexes, bridges, any application, whether it's games, whether it's all of this. Like, you think about generic messaging as you think about packets on the Internet, right? You're sending some bytes payload and you're interpreting that. And whatever logic you can implement on chain, you can do with that. So layer Zero's goal is fundamentally different than Thorchain's goal.
00:40:18.708 - 00:40:47.884, Speaker B: Thorchain's goal was be a Dex, be this sort of asset swap across all of these chains. Hugely useful. Layer zero's goal has always been like, be the core messaging primitive that enables everything to be built on top of it. And so Stargate specifically. Stargate is not a dex, right? Stargate is not going asset a to asset B. It's not swapping ETH to avax or whatever. Stargate is more akin to a stable swap where it's solving this liquidity transfer portion of like kind assets.
00:40:47.884 - 00:41:28.584, Speaker B: So this could be weft to wealth or wrap bitcoin. To wrap bitcoin. It might be USDC to USDC, or it might be USDC to another asset that's similar USDT or whatever, right? Similar to maybe curve pools are. But really the goal of that is this interaction across chains where contracts, you can take really complex bundles of contracts that might be like unstake. So let's take six contract calls across two chains where you like on chain a, you're unstake, you swap, you initiate a bridge. Let's say it's Stargate. You claim on the other side, you swap again, and you stake right now, you can bundle all six of those transactions into one single transaction from the source chain where the user doesn't need to have source and destination gas.
00:41:28.584 - 00:41:55.700, Speaker B: So they might be going ETH to Solana, they don't need to have both ETH and Sol, so they can have a totally empty wallet. On the other side, the whole transaction flow gets executed. They're now staked in the Solana farm. They haven't done anything. They haven't had to do anything else other than sign that one transaction. On the ETH side, they've only ever thought about gas and ETH, and then they can also be airdropped, Sol on the other side, if they want to play around in that ecosystem. So it's really about the extensibility of apps within the defi ecosystem.
00:41:55.700 - 00:42:02.360, Speaker B: Hopefully that describes it. I mean, they really are quite different, but from my mind, that's how I frame.
00:42:03.180 - 00:42:19.740, Speaker F: Yeah, no, that was an awesome breakdown. I think you covered it. I guess the main question is, how would we get involved? Or how could we get exposed to Stargate and Layer zero at the moment, or just moving forward as just basic users?
00:42:19.900 - 00:42:52.424, Speaker B: I would say the best thing you can possibly do is be involved in the community. Within the layer zero community will be, again, some things I can't talk about, but in the coming weeks, we'll be telling you guys tons more. I would say just be as involved as you possibly can. Stargate. Obviously, tomorrow is the auction, the bonding curves and all of the protocol and liquidity goes live. So Stargate will be live tomorrow, and all of that will be sort of available tomorrow. From the layer zero side, I would just say be as active as you can.
00:42:52.424 - 00:43:15.440, Speaker B: Ask questions. We love people who think about architecture or what can be built or that's the stuff that excites us is okay, now, this primitive is here. What can you do with it? What kind of cool things are we not thinking about that people are going to build or sort of motivate others to build? And so, yeah, I would just say be involved and keep your ears open. Awesome.
00:43:15.510 - 00:43:18.050, Speaker F: Thanks for taking time, guys. This is an awesome project.
00:43:18.420 - 00:43:20.176, Speaker B: Absolutely. Thanks so much.
00:43:20.358 - 00:43:41.108, Speaker A: All right, thank you very much, Zulian. That's going to wrap us here for today. Thank you, everybody, for coming out. I really appreciate everyone that's here. And, yeah, all the questions that came in as well. Okay, this has been recorded and will be up on the layer zero YouTube. It's also live streaming, so it might just be ready to go very shortly.
00:43:41.108 - 00:44:22.836, Speaker A: And if you have a look into the. If those in YouTube and twitch right now that it's being live streamed to, there are some links to the Stargate finance discord, followed by the Twitters for layer Zero and Stargate. And finally, the Stargate finance website. You can head over there, too, and you'll be able to get all the information that you're looking for, either get yourself connected for the auction and get ready for that. We also see there's some git books there, too. Hopefully, we'll get the Stargate ones as well there. But, yeah, please hop into the discord, either layer zero or into the Stargate one as well.
00:44:22.836 - 00:44:46.010, Speaker A: If you have any questions, feel free to reach out there. Yeah. Try and stay very active in that part here over the week because it's going to be very busy. And I know everyone has lots of questions, but really appreciate everyone coming out here today. Yeah, this has been great. And, yeah. Thanks so much, Brimo, Raz, and Maki, for coming out, and we'll talk to everybody soon.
00:44:46.540 - 00:44:49.132, Speaker B: Amazing. Thanks so much, guys. Thanks, Dangle.
00:44:49.196 - 00:44:50.032, Speaker C: Thanks, guys.
00:44:50.166 - 00:44:50.670, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone.
