00:00:00.440 - 00:00:04.850, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I guess that's worth mentioning. We're doing a clap.
00:00:28.720 - 00:00:31.580, Speaker B: And welcome to the super swap show.
00:00:32.120 - 00:00:32.940, Speaker A: Yep.
00:00:39.320 - 00:00:41.860, Speaker B: So, Hayden, tell me about yourself.
00:00:42.240 - 00:00:53.820, Speaker A: I'm Hayden. I'm the inventor of the Uniswap protocol, CEO of Uniswap Labs, and I love Kid super. And who are you?
00:00:54.350 - 00:00:58.690, Speaker B: My name is Colm Deland. I'm the founder of Kid super, and I love Uniswap.
00:01:08.230 - 00:01:12.250, Speaker C: Can each of you give me one sentence explainer on my unique.
00:01:14.510 - 00:01:17.686, Speaker A: He goes first. I'm not going first.
00:01:17.758 - 00:01:30.494, Speaker B: No, I'm going first. All right. Fuck. What I think it is, is a place where you can exchange cryptocurrencies depending on how much they're worth and how much they're not worth.
00:01:30.622 - 00:01:49.270, Speaker A: Uniswap is a place where you can buy and sell cryptocurrencies and convert between them, but it's also a place where you can create a marketplace. So if you have a cryptocurrency and there's nowhere you can buy and sell it, Uniswap is a place where you can go and you can and create a marketplace where other people can buy and sell it.
00:01:53.850 - 00:01:54.710, Speaker B: Whoa.
00:01:55.410 - 00:01:57.510, Speaker A: How's it hanging there, super?
00:01:59.730 - 00:02:06.594, Speaker C: Each of you didn't totally intend to, like, disrupt the worlds of fashion and finance, respectively, but you kind of just, like, did.
00:02:06.762 - 00:02:44.880, Speaker B: I find it funny, my disruption of fashion, which is such, like, I wouldn't say silly, but a silly concept, and he's disrupting, like, the way the world works. I never thought I was going to be accepted into fashion, and once it started for Paris Fashion Week and getting accepted into these things that we never thought we'd be accepted. And now when you look at fashion shows and stuff, we definitely have inspired a new movement of kind of thinking outside the box and having these very creative moments.
00:02:45.000 - 00:03:19.840, Speaker A: I also didn't set out to disrupt anything or have any expectation of doing so. So I didn't set out to, like, create a big thing. I set out to create a decentralized thing, similar to how, you know, the Internet democratized access to information. I think what we're trying to do is democratize access to ownership and value and the exchange of value. And I didn't really know what would become of it, but what I found is that actually the values behind it, the ideas behind it, really resonated with people. Oh, yeah, I guess that's worth mentioning. We're doing a collab.
00:03:24.860 - 00:03:51.526, Speaker B: No, we were talking about a collaboration for two years. And how can we work together to create. Create something physical that people can engage with and also kind of explain what is uniswap and how it works on a day to day basis. We have this big space in Williamsburg, and we've always wanted this outside area to be kind of a cafe, and they thought it'd be really cool as a way to engage with Uniswap.
00:03:51.558 - 00:04:09.284, Speaker A: We were really excited to just jam on a physical location, and then, of course, there had to be merch. We thought it would be really cool to do one. Is like a yemenite, you know, we have our digital wallet, and so we thought it'd be really cool to do a physical wallet to go along with the digital wallet. And so that's one of the pieces. There's also two shirts and a hat.
00:04:09.372 - 00:04:13.300, Speaker B: It's gonna be sick, kid. Super and Uniswap are really playing 4d chess.
