00:00:02.650 - 00:00:57.998, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Welcome to a new episode of Research Hour series hosted by Unisoft Labs. Unisoft is the largest marketplace for on chain digital assets, and the tools that Labs create are built on the Uniswap Protocol, governed by an independent and decentralized community of uni token holders. And today is the largest decentralized trading protocol. Uniswap Labs is focused on building technology that enables users to swap tokens by NFTs, provide liquidity, and self custody with confidence. The opinions expressed today will be ours personally and not that of Labs. And our guest today is Alex Naslobin, famous DeFi researcher and one of the most vocal critics of Uniswap, at least at some point.
00:00:57.998 - 00:01:05.680, Speaker A: Alex is also a former professor at London School of Economics. So, Alex, welcome.
00:01:06.290 - 00:01:39.980, Speaker B: Thank you, Shin. Thank you for having me. You're giving me too much credit about being famous, and you're also giving me too much credit about being a critic of Uniswap. I think there are many things that Uniswap got right, certainly, but I think that the whole area of DeFi is probably not quite there yet, so there is much more work to be done. So I'm conscious of the amount of work that needs to be done, but I think we also should be celebrating our accomplishments to date, of which Uniswap is one of the major ones.
00:01:40.990 - 00:01:52.750, Speaker A: Great. First question why shouldn't questions be shared before an interview? Is it just to sound less scripted, or is there actually benefits in terms of signal to noise ratio from the conversation?
00:01:53.170 - 00:02:44.418, Speaker B: All right, so a little bit of a background. I asked Shin not to share questions with me, and yes, that's absolutely right. So, first of all, I don't want to sound too scripted. Secondly, I think it goes back to this old journalistic tradition, that tradition that journalists generally didn't want to share questions so that you can ask me and then maybe put me in some hot water with your questions or something. And so generally, when I give interviews, I don't give interviews that often, but when I do, I prefer to play by that old book, meaning that I don't know what the questions are going to be. I'll have to improvise. Maybe I will say something embarrassing, but that's the cost that I'll have to leave with.
00:02:44.584 - 00:03:05.960, Speaker A: Wouldn't the counterargument be that if the purpose of an interview is to kind of pass information on to the listeners, then you have some time to prepare? Maybe you say something that's more contentful, but maybe not. Maybe people censor themselves when they prepare. So I wonder if you have thought about that.
00:03:09.150 - 00:03:45.634, Speaker B: I think it's a good line of thinking. So maybe yes, I will probably not be able to produce any new knowledge, just answering questions on the spot. But mostly when you ask me something, there is a good chance that I have thought about this in the past. And so then I will probably have something ready in my mind. Or maybe not. But I wouldn't be able to produce a significant amount of new knowledge even if you told me what the questions would be in advance. So in that sense, I think we are probably not losing much, but that remains to be seen.
00:03:45.634 - 00:03:56.166, Speaker B: You have had great speakers on this live stream before, so ultimately you can just compare what gives better outcomes and take it from there, I guess.
00:03:56.348 - 00:04:21.440, Speaker A: Sounds good. So here's something you might have thought about. There's a knob for you and you turn it and you can change the ethereum block time. And then every dev in the industry has to kind of work their way to make that work with that particular spec, right? That's the only parameter you can tune. And you can tune it all by yourself, once and for all. What would that time be?
00:04:22.950 - 00:05:39.210, Speaker B: That's a great question. It would certainly not be 12 seconds. So I can tell you as much. I think that there is certainly technology right now that can achieve much shorter block times without a significant loss of validators, for example, right? So usually when people say that, hey, we cannot make the block times too short because maybe some validators will not be able to attest on time or suggest propose new blocks on time. So I think that 12 seconds is certainly a very long time. I think over the past few years in general we have had to change our thinking on this question because of the rise of DeFi. At a certain level, one can say that probably longer block times can be better for decentralization if you look at this from the perspective of the consensus layer.
00:05:39.210 - 00:06:36.940, Speaker B: But then you have the DeFi layer, the layer of distributed applications. And to avoid centralization there, I think it's absolutely critical to have shorter block times. 12 seconds is a long, long period of time in trading. It leads to very significant arbitrage opportunities. To pick up those arbitrage opportunities you need to have a lot of liquidity on chain, you have to be able to house a lot of risk, you have to be able to execute in large volumes on centralized exchanges if you want to hedge that risk, and so on and so forth. So basically the arbitrage game becomes substantially less competitive when you increase the block time. So think about it the following way what if we were to increase the block time to one day? Then there will probably be at most one shop that would be able to do it.
00:06:36.940 - 00:07:40.030, Speaker B: And so I think if you look at the situation right now, the main centralization pressures actually come from the DeFi market, from the DeFi world. You don't have that many block builders, you don't have that many searchers who can confidently arbitrage large uniswap pools. And that leads to a lot of centralization in my view. So you should certainly go lower than twelve. I don't know if you can go all the way to salana block times. But even if you look at what happens at what's happening currently on Arbitrum, I think that gives you an idea that something simple like 1 second block time with first come, first serve essentially can lead to significantly better outcomes in DeFi. Because Arbitrum is producing a lot of volume right now with significantly less liquidity than ethereum.
00:07:40.030 - 00:07:58.070, Speaker B: Volumes are still lower, but they're not an order of magnitude lower. They're pretty impressive. So I think sort of moving in that direction would be something very productive both for decentralization and for improving the outcomes in DeFi.
00:08:00.810 - 00:08:24.720, Speaker A: Or is it fair to sort of categorize your argument as hey, let's make validator level maybe a touch more centralized just because of the pressure that we apply by shortening block time and whatever, but we can make the builder level a lot more decentralized? Is that the trade off you're trying to make here?
00:08:25.090 - 00:09:54.874, Speaker B: I feel that that's pretty much the story here. If you are a small builder, what is the probability of you being able to place a block on chain relatively quickly? If you have to compete with all the big builders out there and you have to produce a block which is worth, what, 12 seconds of transactions, that's not very high. I would say at the same time, if block times were really, really short, this would mean that, well, you can accumulate you would still not be able to place a block that very second, but you could accumulate enough transactions so that while other builders, they place their transactions quickly, your accumulated balance exceeds theirs. And to get to that point, you would need significantly less time than right now. Right now, even the biggest builders, I haven't seen the recent data on this, but it feels like they do have a significant problem with inclusion times already. So you look at Flashbots, for example, I believe that their market share is somewhere between 15 and 20% of the builder market, let's call it 15%. I think it probably takes them about a minute and a half to two minutes to lend a block on chain at the moment.
00:09:54.874 - 00:10:50.720, Speaker B: And the issue with that is that even if they build a great product right now, which I hope they will, so we have all high hopes for the product that they're building, but without very fast inclusion times, it will be difficult for them to really control that order flow. Right, because they essentially have to share whatever they're doing with everyone else eventually, and they end up sending it to all the builders. And then there is a lot of trust in that process. So it's tricky for me to I wouldn't guarantee that the market would become more competitive, but I think there is a very meaningful argument that right now the competition is limited and it creates all kinds of adverse effects on the market, on the builders markets in particular, and searchers market too, I guess.
00:10:52.050 - 00:10:57.760, Speaker A: Is effective spread as a measure for DeFi still underrated? And if so, why?
00:10:59.170 - 00:11:04.980, Speaker B: Effective spread, realized spread. There are two of them, right?
00:11:06.150 - 00:11:15.140, Speaker A: I forgot which one is your favorite. Actually, I think one of them is more of a favorite of yours. And I meant to ask that one.
00:11:18.250 - 00:11:58.050, Speaker B: In general. Let me take a step back from the DeFi world. Right? Let's go back to the world of centralized finance for a little bit. When you look at the measures of profits or the measures of execution quality, there are two different types of measures, basically. So one question that you might want to ask is that if I'm an uninformed trader, people in finance use the term uninformed. But the right way to interpret it perhaps is to say that I'm a non arbitrage trader, so I'm trading for any reason other than arbitrage. I just want to get directional execution of my trade.
00:11:58.050 - 00:12:58.200, Speaker B: What is the cost for me of getting that execution? And I don't really know, since I'm uninformed and I'm a non arbitrage trader, I don't really know whether I'm trading towards or away from the true price, so to speak. So in that case, you can look at the spread and you are equally likely to be on each side of it. Then there will be some additional price impact that your trades create. And basically, the effective cost that you have to pay would be measured by this notion of the effective spread, which is basically you take the mid price, you take the execution price, and you take the difference between the two. That's the effective spread, and that's a measure of execution cost for uninformed traders. But then there is a different question. Let's now look at market makers, people who are providing liquidity to the market.
00:12:58.200 - 00:13:58.118, Speaker B: And we want to measure how much money they're making or losing on this particular market making activity. For that, you can't really just take the effective spread because you are facing adverse selection from traders. You will not just be facing uninformed traders, but you also will be facing a significant number of arbitrage traders who only trade towards the price. So meaning that they only pick off your liquidity when it's mispriced. And so to measure the profitability of market makers, you cannot really use the effective spread. You have to use something that in traditional finance, people call realized spread. And the realized spread is the difference essentially between the execution price of a particular trade after all fees are included, and what the true value of the asset is, what the true rate should be.
00:13:58.118 - 00:14:42.360, Speaker B: Now I'm saying true rate, but nobody really knows what that true rate should be. And so of course, we need to come up with a proxy for it. And the way people usually do it is they say, okay, so maybe if we use the price, the mid price on the market, 5 seconds later, 1 minute later, or maybe 1 hour later, then that will be an unbiased measure of the fair value. Right now at the time of the trade. It will certainly be a noisy measure because there is a lot of stuff that can happen during this 5 seconds, 1 minute, 1 hour or whatever, but at least it's probably going to be an unbiased measure. So this is the realized spread. Basically realized spread measures the profitability of the market makers and liquidity providers and then the effective spread measures the execution quality.
00:14:42.360 - 00:15:29.462, Speaker B: I think the same ideas can be applied in DeFi really and we're certainly learning quite a bit of stuff from applying similar ideas in DeFi. I'm open to any other measure. There are certainly other things to look at, other numbers to look at, but one would have to have some justification for them and we would need to know the limitations as well. So I know that you guys at Uniswap Labs developed your own measure called Flare. I read it with interest and I think it does provide useful information. The question is that how do you want to use it, what is the additional information that it conveys? And then when you sort of know the answers to those two questions you can of course use the additional measure. Usually the more information you use the better.
00:15:29.462 - 00:15:32.150, Speaker B: So there's probably a good use for any measure.
00:15:33.690 - 00:15:45.930, Speaker A: What do you think is the effective spread for retail traders in TradFi say on Robinhood or any of these trading applications? What do you think is the order of magnitude of effective spread there?
00:15:46.000 - 00:17:04.770, Speaker B: Yes, so the data that I've seen comes from a number of studies on payment for order flow systems and actually estimates vary quite widely there. But there is also the data that the SSE quotes in its studies and I think that that is probably quite a bit more reliable because it is based on quite a bit of information that brokers and market makers and everyone exchanges brokers have to report to the SEC. So it does look like for transactions that are not super huge so let's say under two hundred K, the spread is to the tune of 00:25 basis points to maybe 0.6 basis points. So it's six tenths of a basis point. And that of course depends on what exactly you are trading. Are we talking about S and P 500 stocks? The execution cost is going to be much lower there or are we talking about all this other stocks? I may be confusing right now whether the number that I'm quoting here is the effective spread or the realized spread.
00:17:04.770 - 00:18:02.280, Speaker B: So maybe it's the realized spread. So basically the amount of money market makers make on this stuff, I don't remember at the moment what number exactly it is, but the point though is that the execution in traditional markets, on Robinhood even and on other brokers as well is very efficient comparative. If you compare it relative to what we have in Defy at the moment. But that shouldn't discourage us from building better systems because we are looking at one of the most efficient markets in the world at any point in history of humankind. Right. So if you want to trade S and P 500 stocks, then it's probably the best time for you to do it. Markets have never been as efficient as they are right now.
00:18:02.280 - 00:18:17.610, Speaker B: I'm old enough to remember the times when brokers charged $5 for every transaction and that was 15 years ago. So who knows, maybe 15 years from now we will be talking about the same execution quality in Defy.
00:18:18.110 - 00:18:44.100, Speaker A: So if you need to give a point estimate of weath USDC transactions on ETH L, one on the Uniswap interface, let's just say same transaction cut off like less than $200,000 per trade and just give one number as to your estimate of the effective spread there. What do you think it is?
00:18:45.610 - 00:18:51.190, Speaker B: 5.6. That's the number I've seen in one of the studies by FBI femboy.
00:18:51.690 - 00:18:54.198, Speaker A: 5.6 basis points.
00:18:54.284 - 00:18:55.560, Speaker B: Basis points? Yes.
00:18:57.130 - 00:19:04.774, Speaker A: That has to remember that that has to include everything. So gas, costs, pricing, LP, fees.
00:19:04.902 - 00:19:17.280, Speaker B: Yes, plus gas. So after fees, everything that is paid other than gas. So 5.7 basis points plus gas. That's the number I've seen. Do you have more recent data on this?
00:19:19.010 - 00:19:31.426, Speaker A: The number I look at is with gas, but yeah, so if I take out gas, it would be a bit higher, but order of magnitude would be roughly correct.
00:19:31.528 - 00:19:32.180, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:33.910 - 00:19:48.600, Speaker A: Okay, next question. Why haven't more professors quit their job to do startups? Are they all doing it part time? Are they too risk averse? What do you think? Is the breakdown or is the statement just not true?
00:19:49.370 - 00:20:33.062, Speaker B: It's difficult for me to tell. But there are professors doing startups, right? So I mentioned Arbitram already. I think that if memory serves, it was started by professor, right? I might be mistaken here, but I think that one of the co founders is a professor. So professors certainly do things. I think what I love about DeFi is that everyone who ends up in this area takes a different path. So you have people from with all kinds of backgrounds. For me personally, I think a big component was that first of all, my interest in DeFi got really strong.
00:20:33.062 - 00:21:40.762, Speaker B: And I noticed that whatever research I'm doing, it's mostly on DeFi anyway. So I decided, well, if I'm already doing it full time, then why would I continue with what I've been doing before? There are, of course, costs as well, right? Because I'm probably a bit older than the average DeFi user or entrepreneur. There is a different family situation, right? I have kids and other things to worry about right now, but I think it's a fascinating area, really. So I know that professors quit sometimes. Yes, but it's difficult for me to tell sort of in each individual case but I think there is one benefit of being in academia case, or a big benefit, is that most of the time you can do whatever you want, really. In particular, when you get promoted to a certain level, then you have the academic freedom to work on the questions that interest you. It can be a sister field.
00:21:40.762 - 00:22:09.320, Speaker B: You don't have to stay in whatever the field you started out in. So you can do things right and you can do things on your own timeline, which is also important. So I think that attracts a lot of people. But at the same time, again, I think that you also have quite a bit of flexibility in DeFi. So for me at least, the decision was pretty obvious, but maybe more people will do it.
00:22:12.250 - 00:22:25.740, Speaker A: Just I'm being curious here, but is the sort of research faculty tenure track different between UK and US? Is one sort of better for encouraging research and innovation than the other?
00:22:28.430 - 00:23:28.830, Speaker B: I cannot really tell you much about the UK academic world at large because I was at a school which pretty much follows the US model largely. So the London School of Economics is very similar to what we had at Berkeley and NYU in terms of the structure, in terms of the incentives, in terms of the split between teaching and research activities for most of those things. But there are of course, different universities, and even in the US there are very different places. Right? So the academic life is different. I guess I consider myself fortunate because all the three places were great where I worked as an academic. I love all of them. But I think at Alicia I just personally had a little bit more flexibility.
00:23:28.830 - 00:23:48.070, Speaker B: Maybe it was the teaching schedule, maybe it was COVID, I don't know. I shouldn't be saying that I benefited from COVID a lot, but the teaching schedule was adjusted because of that. And I remember that I had plenty of free time in London and I decided, well, I can be looking at all of these great new industries that are appearing elsewhere.
00:23:49.370 - 00:24:12.160, Speaker A: Okay, let's talk about Ofas. First question is how different are they from payment for order flows? And for those who kind of regard payment for order flow as the ultimate sort of dystopia, are Ofas promising as a line of inquiry or are they sort of misguided in a way?
00:24:14.050 - 00:24:52.874, Speaker B: Great question. So I think there are basically three things that I at least personally try to distinguish between. There is the payment for order flow, where order flow is sold before you actually observe it, essentially. So this is what Robinhood does with a few market makers. Then. What I think you are referring to is an Ofa model, which the way we call it in DeFi or in traditional finance, they call it auctions for individual orders. The Ofa model, let's call it.
00:24:52.874 - 00:25:38.460, Speaker B: This is essentially what also the recent SEC proposal seems to be focusing on where when an order comes in, there is an auction to fill it. And then of course, there are all these other ways in which an order can be filled. Something that we have in DeFi at the moment. For example, I'm not going to go into details because we know how orders are filled right now. So my personal ranking is that the current state of execution in DeFi is not great. And it's not just great on average, there is an issue with average cost, as we discussed. I think it's significantly higher than what it could be.
00:25:38.460 - 00:26:39.178, Speaker B: But there is also an issue with the tail events. So maybe on average you get executed at 5.7 basis points, but then sometimes something happens and maybe you get sandwiched. Or maybe there is some other kind of fancy thing happening in the markets, right? Some mev thing that we may not even know about right now, but some of these things happen and you get significantly worse execution. So I think the current state of execution is pretty bad for my taste, and the Ofa model should be better than what we have right now. At the same time, I honestly think that the payment for order flow model is going to be much more efficient for the ultimate users than the Ofa system. There is a big discussion right now going on in traditional finance, whether it's true or not.
00:26:39.178 - 00:27:36.874, Speaker B: But personally, I think we do observe that the execution quality is great under the payment order flow model for retail traders. If you just worry about the retail traders, they do get great execution right now, it seems. And you can predict all types of issues with orders for individual with auctions for individual orders, essentially an order comes in, you have two options. Maybe you run an auction for each order, that's going to be a lot of work, and you have to announce the order to the entire world. And then everyone has a chance to front run it, pick up the liquidity ahead of that order, and then sell it to the person requesting it, which is going to come at some markup. So this is not great in traditional finance. Under the SEC proposal, they don't actually want to send all of the orders to the market, but they have some additional requirements.
00:27:36.874 - 00:28:32.506, Speaker B: So maybe if the broker cannot fill it at the Nbvo mid, so the mid price of the national best bitten offer, only then it goes to the market. But then you're introducing an additional layer of adverse selection, because you know that Citadel, for example, if they were one of the market makers participating in this payment for order flow arrangement with Robinhood, they know that they decided not to fill that order and only then they sent the order to the market. And now you are announcing to the market essentially two facts. First of all, I need liquidity and I'm willing to pay this much. But then secondly, you're also announcing to the world the fact that Citadel is not willing to fill that order. Both of these things are probably going to work against the order and end up lead to a higher execution cost. And then there is the risk of non execution, which is an additional risk and a big risk in DeFi.
00:28:32.506 - 00:29:14.074, Speaker B: What if there is an order and nobody bids for it? What happens then? And you already announced what you're going to do and there is a delay in the auction has to run for I don't remember what the current proposal is. I think it's 100 milliseconds and right now the orders that are internalized actually filled within three milliseconds or even less. So all of these things adapt. And I might be wrong with the times, I don't remember the times exactly. I need to check the proposal again. But it's an order of magnitude slower than the current fill time. So I am not super optimistic on this race between Ofa and payment forward flow.
00:29:14.074 - 00:29:41.270, Speaker B: I think that if you can implement payment for order flow that's probably the most efficient way. But Ofa can still be significantly better than what we have currently in DeFi, in particular in terms of eliminating the stale events. If you're doing something really silly and there is an auction for your order, then people will be willing to bid and maybe return some of the value that you might be losing otherwise. We already see that happening in tools like Mapblocker.
00:29:42.730 - 00:30:40.940, Speaker A: My understanding is most of the criticism of payment order flow is actually not on the execution quality front, but more on sort of the agency problem front where people think that these values should be returned to the users. But it eventually comes down to how the order flow originator or order flow seller in some way decides to do with whatever proceeds they make from the auction. And that sort of may be something that we can do better by being somehow transparent monitorable in crypto but it's not entirely clear, I would say at this point how it's going to play out.
00:30:42.350 - 00:31:53.118, Speaker B: Yes, and I think that certainly I think the process can be much improved in crypto. So first of all I have no doubts about that. So I think that the outcomes can be better eventually. But then even if you look so the numbers that I mentioned, they include the part from which the payment is made, right? So basically even if you don't get any of the payment from order flow benefits, which by the way people do get because they do get free products elsewhere. So for example, there is research saying that if you compare different brokers, both of which have payment forward of low arrangements, then one of the brokers is considerably worse in terms of the execution quality than some other I'm not going to name names, but there are people saying that, hey, this broker is offering worse execution quality than this one. It's still very good if you look at the actual numbers. But still there is the discrepancy and so then there is a question, well, are you actually accounting for the full thing? So yes, this broker is paying more for order flow and they're getting sort of worse execution quality.
00:31:53.118 - 00:32:52.420, Speaker B: But then if you look at the offerings of this broker who is offering worse execution quality, they actually offer a lot of freebies elsewhere. So they can be offering, I don't know, free options trading or something like this, right? So they're sort of better on the other dimensions. The broker business is also pretty competitive right now, so there are a lot of brokers, it's not just one that is doing it. And the thing is that the numbers that we've seen in terms of the execution quality, they're based even under the assumption that literally zero comes back from the payment from order flow in terms of other services, in terms of discounts elsewhere, if nothing else comes back, the execution quality there is still very good. And so can we do better? Yes, probably. But you should also not expect the quality of execution to be free. You want somebody to source liquidity for you, you want somebody to provide liquidity for you when you need it.
00:32:52.420 - 00:33:40.210, Speaker B: Order flows never match when you want to sell something, almost never. There is a person who wants to buy the same thing exactly on the outside so that the broker can match it perfectly. There is always a little bit of mismatch. So somebody has to take risks, somebody has to source liquidity. And some of these risks are very real, by the way, in particular when bad things happen to brokers. So you know what happened to Robinhood when the GME thing happened, right? So you sort of think that you're trading against an uninformed crowd, but when all of them are buying the same thing like GameStop, then you can be in trouble. So you shouldn't expect to get free execution quality.
00:33:40.210 - 00:34:36.230, Speaker B: But if you want to improve the current system, all right, just tell us what is it that you are aiming for? And then one needs to think about it very, very carefully if you want to go down that road because again, there is a chance that your estimates might be a little off. What we have right now is great and so if you want to change the market substantially, you might at least want to come up with a way to do this slowly. So if you think you have a better model, well, maybe run that better model in parallel with what we currently have and see if you can get one broker using this model to become competitive with the brokers who are offering payment for order flow in terms of execution quality. If that is the case, maybe the whole industry should switch. But I just want to. Point out that it is not a simple problem and it is a very interesting question. And I think that people hate on payment for the flow a little too much given what it actually delivers.
00:34:38.970 - 00:34:46.120, Speaker A: What is the best and worst protocol design aspect in your opinion of Uniswap V Four and Unisoft X?
00:34:47.950 - 00:35:48.810, Speaker B: I think that both products are actually certainly a step in the right direction. I think strategically Uniswap has made the decision that we are offering a platform for others to essentially build their pools hooks on top in Uniswap before, which is great. A different strategy would be to say that we are trying to come up with solutions to some of the problems that we're seeing right now ourselves. And so that would be just a different strategy. I don't want to say that one is better than the other. It's obviously the decision of the company ultimately. So on Univ Four, I expect we will see if this materializes, but I expect there to be quite a bit of liquidity fragmentation.
00:35:48.810 - 00:36:37.174, Speaker B: And liquidity fragmentation is not good because it increases the fixed cost per unit of liquidity that is available to you. And this is a critical number because it affects LVR, it affects profitability of LPs, it affects execution quality, it affects everything else. So you really have to watch the number, which is the ratio of a fixed cost of a transaction to how much liquidity you can essentially get by paying this fixed cost. So there are things that are great. The singleton contract, for example, it reduces gas cost, so it certainly affects this ratio in the right direction. But then one issue that I see, a potential issue, and we will see sort of if it materializes or not, is that pools can compete very aggressively. You created a five basis point pool.
00:36:37.174 - 00:37:15.414, Speaker B: Well, I can now create a 4.9 basis point pool and I think that there is a meaningful advantage of being just a little bit offering a little bit tighter spread than the competing pool. You could not do this in Univ Three, but now Univ Four is inviting that type of competition. And so one issue that might arise is that the liquidity fragmentation effect of this higher competition might offset the savings elsewhere. So that's my big picture thinking. On uniswap. V four.
00:37:15.414 - 00:37:59.670, Speaker B: It goes back again to all of these questions that people have in traditional finance for a long time. Should you regulate tick size, for example? Well, you have the same problem right now in DeFi essentially with Uniswap X. Again, I think that it's very important to offer the best execution quality. I think there is no question for me personally whether it's good or bad. I know that some people are saying, well, LPs are going to lose because of that. Could be or maybe not, we will see. But LPs should not be just compensated from the inefficiencies in execution quality.
00:37:59.670 - 00:38:45.886, Speaker B: So you have to offer the most efficient execution quality that you can. You have to figure out other ways to limit losses to arbitragers. There are other ways and you have to work on that and the whole industry needs to work on it. But LPs should not be essentially deriving their entire PNL or the P profit of their PNL, the P part, the profit part of their PNL from inefficient execution. I also think that it's not really clear to me that if execution quality is improved that LPs will lose a lot. And the reason I'm saying this is that we already have some systems that are RFQs that have auctions and so on and so forth. Many of those systems lend a lot of their volume on DEXes.
00:38:45.886 - 00:39:58.330, Speaker B: So you look at Cowswap, for example, great system, great tool, but it does land maybe 80% of the volume last time I looked, maybe less now, but at least at the time it was about 80% still goes to DEXes. So if I was an LP, I wouldn't be too worried about it because there is still significant volume coming from Cowswap solvers and the solvers are relatively soft in taking liquidity from univ four. Again, this is something that we have seen in the data that they're pretty profitable for LPs. So I think that the general direction I love very much. The architecture of Uniswapx is a completely different topic and I have discussions with some of the people who participated in developing it and I think that you may want to eventually reconsider some of the aspects, but I'll leave it up to you. But it's just the fact that when I read through the uniswap X white paper, there is one step after another step, and then there is a third step. And in all of those steps, it looks like basically the protocol is trying to offer each party the last look, but nobody ever commits to the deal until maybe ten steps down the line.
00:39:58.330 - 00:40:50.718, Speaker B: I feel that it needs to be considerably more streamlined, that basically if you are offering a quote, you shouldn't be asking for soft quotes. If somebody is offering a quote, they have to respect it and basically do things much faster and try to lend the transaction on chain as fast as you can and basically try it for two blocks on there. And then if it fails, it's fine to tell the client that hey look, it failed, but it shouldn't be happening on the other hand, because again, you need to force participants considerably more to actually deliver on their quotes. If somebody is offering a quote, they have to respect it in a way that's my feeling about it. And then a separate issue is how open the system is going to be. And that remains to be seen. We know that right now access to it is not really open to everybody.
00:40:50.718 - 00:40:55.630, Speaker B: So the set of Fillers, right, I think they're called, is it Filler?
00:40:56.530 - 00:41:15.362, Speaker A: There's the filler, which is people who participate in the Dutch auction and those are technically fully open. And there's a group who kind of responds to these requests for quotes and that requires some of the sign up, right?
00:41:15.416 - 00:41:55.562, Speaker B: So I think opening the letter group rather I know that the Dutch auction is open, but opening up the participation in the second group. So the first group rather if you look at the flow, right, the RFQ system, I think that that's very important to basically make it as open as possible. So basically two things. Again, I love the general direction. I think that streamlining the system is important, making sure that execution is delivered, making sure that exhibit quickly. In particular, if it's a permission system right now, right, you have maybe N, let's call it some number of permissioned RFQ providers. And so if they promise something, they should just deliver.
00:41:55.562 - 00:42:20.220, Speaker B: They will not make a profit on each individual trade. You shouldn't expect them to sometimes they will have to realize a little loss, but the participation in the system is profitable for them, I hope. And so if they're really providing a quote, then they should be just delivering on it. So I think that's streamlining and making it more open, that's my comment on Uniswap X.
00:42:21.470 - 00:42:40.206, Speaker A: If you have $10,000 today and you have to keep it as some LP position in Uniswap for a year, what would be your strategy and what is your expected output at the end of the year? Your wife is a unisop LP maxi, so I would expect you to know this.
00:42:40.388 - 00:43:23.280, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm not sure if I remember this correctly, but I think Hayden doesn't help you on Uniswap, right? Because of the tax situation or something. I remember him saying that somewhere. I don't know. I don't if I didn't have any tax considerations and I had to do it. I think that there are pairs where you sort of expect things to maybe mean reverting. There is of course a risk of depegging, for example, if you do stable coins. So maybe a look there, or maybe pairs that for some reason you expect other pairs that you expect to minervse for some reason.
00:43:23.280 - 00:44:53.994, Speaker B: Or maybe also I've seen this interesting paper recently saying that uniswap V two pair in Ethusdc was profitable for some unexpected, to me at least personally reason. So maybe if you look carefully, you will actually find some pairs that are profitable in expectation. And again, I understand that many people are actually making profits by being I think the question for me is where you can sort of find that expected value going forward. So I believe that there might be pairs and more importantly, I think that also a part of the question that is often overlooked is that many people use these LP positions. I expect I sort of think that many people use this LP positions to actually trade directionally. So what a question that you could have asked me is that if I had two hundred k to trade directionally, or maybe a little bit more, let's say that I needed to implement a 1 million trade on chain and I have to do it on chain for some reason, how would I do it? I actually expect that Lping, some part of it could very well be a part of the optimal solution. So maybe I take a little bit of liquidity to push the price out of the current tick and then maybe I throw in the liquidity in that tick that the price is now out.
00:44:53.994 - 00:45:36.470, Speaker B: So waiting for that to move back. So something like this. So there are certainly uses for LP positions and people are doing it. I think it's important to understand why they're doing it because maybe some people are willing to pay a little bit for execution, in which case the losses of others are overestimated. But of course, just generally having a market making protocol, which is very clear in terms of what it's doing, but it's doing it with twelve second block times and significant gas cost. It's pretty difficult to make it sustainable for passive LPs. And I think this is the problem that we all need to focus on solving.
00:45:39.210 - 00:45:43.190, Speaker A: What about any pairs that is only traded on uniswap?
00:45:44.250 - 00:46:10.900, Speaker B: And of course that as well. But I think that here one also needs to be very careful about the way people, about getting execution the right way. And it's very messy right now. Some people say set the slippage very tight and submit it privately. You set the slippage too tight, you don't get execution. And if you want to trade, you want to trade. So that's not necessarily always the answer.
00:46:10.900 - 00:47:11.942, Speaker B: But interestingly, I had some thread about it a while ago. If you submit transactions privately, in particular if you want to chase something when a token, when a new token is launched, then oftentimes you actually get worse execution than if you submitted it publicly. So in this particular example that I looked at, there were many public transactions sent to buy some new token and they all got sandwiched. But the whole big huge sandwich was at the top of the block and all of the private transactions were included later. So the sandwich transactions of course suffered from the sandwich from the first front running transaction. But then the private transactions that were submitted by all the smart people, they suffered from the price impact of the entire sandwich. So from all the sandwiched transaction, not the front running and back running necessarily, but all of them in between.
00:47:11.942 - 00:47:46.722, Speaker B: And so basically the transaction at the bottom ended up paying a premium of almost 30% of memory serves. So sometimes sending things privately is not necessarily the optimal strategy. I'm saying that getting a good execution on chain is very tricky. So this is something to take into account. And of course on the other side. If you ask me about LPs, actually, I have to go back to the LP side of the question. LPs do get benefit from those sandwiches, but we have to think very carefully whether this is something that we want to be proud of.
00:47:46.722 - 00:48:17.306, Speaker B: So I know that there are some pairs that are traded only on DEXes and there is a lot of abuse happening when those trades come in. One particular kind of abuse, the sandwich attacks, they can actually be good for LPs, but we want to be careful about making that a main source of income. So we have to sort of again, the goal should be to make Lping more sustainable, but at the same time avoid these issues and execution quality.
00:48:17.488 - 00:48:43.010, Speaker A: I think part of it is sandwich, as you mentioned, but also just true price discovery happening on chain. Right. When you don't have these sort of latency arbitrage going on, the only place you can have price discovery is on chain. How much there is price discovery is another topic. But you are forced to have price discovery process on chain.
00:48:44.390 - 00:50:23.938, Speaker B: Yes, and I think that I would certainly say that, hey, price discovery on chain is great except for one component that I don't like about it, when there are clearly these transactions that are basically just sandwiching somebody else, right? Because you know that that person who is creating this massive sandwich, they're not really trading because of their interest in trading. And there is an interesting discussion on sort of the legality of the whole thing and I'm not going to go into that, but legal scholars have written papers on this fascinating stuff. But this is something that in terms of the mechanism design issues that we also need to be addressing, I believe, because you can have a fair amount of price discovery on chain without the significant exposure to sandwich attacks. And if we were to provide that, I think that would be a significant step forward for everyone, for LPs, for traders, it's not necessarily a zero sum game. One last thing that I want to mention on this is that when execution cost went down significantly for retail traders in traditional markets, people started trading much, much more. So when you offer better execution, when you lower the probability of the stale events in execution quality, then there is a good chance that you will just invite more trading volume by doing that, which is good. Yes, people should be able to trade when they want to.
00:50:23.938 - 00:50:35.510, Speaker B: We just need to minimize the amount of the potential abuse that might happen from all these technical inefficiencies that unfortunately we have on the blockchain.
00:50:36.250 - 00:50:46.860, Speaker A: Why hasn't any central limit order book style decks sort of taken off when we have so many faster blockchains now?
00:50:50.190 - 00:51:33.670, Speaker B: So we it depends. We need to see because some of the faster blockchains unfortunately just don't have the liquidity yet. So we'll see maybe some of these things will pick up eventually. But of course, a big issue when you trade with limit orders. If you look at, again, traditional markets, when people trade with limit orders, one thing that you want to accomplish is also that you have a relatively high order to trade ratio. So basically, you need to be able to place orders quickly. If the price walks away from you, you want to cancel that order, move it, and so on and so forth.
00:51:33.670 - 00:52:37.440, Speaker B: So most of the transactions on traditional exchanges are not exactly fills. Traditional exchanges operate at OTR ratio. Ratio is higher than 50 most of the time, meaning that you create 50 orders, you get one fill. And can you do this in DeFi? Obviously you can't. Because of the gas cost, you cannot pay for 50 transactions to get one fill. So there is this issue with limit order protocols. It remains to be seen how much the Uniswap approach can solve this in the sense that one of the things sort of that comes to mind is that right now, what Uniswap does is that when you get a fill, we move your order to the other side.
00:52:37.440 - 00:53:43.662, Speaker B: So it saves the transaction per fill in a way which is good, but can we do better than that? So I think with V Two at least, it was obvious that limit order books just couldn't work back then. And V Two is certainly something that opened up this market and was very successful in attracting dex volumes. V Three is certainly an improvement on V Two, but can we say that the same model will be super successful when block times go to zero and liquidity on those chain appears? That, I think, remains to be seen. We will see how things develop. There are great projects working on order books with cheap transactions, cheap everything. But of course, there is not enough liquidity for everyone at the moment. And existing protocols have a significant advantage in terms of attracting liquidity because they're so well known.
00:53:43.662 - 00:53:48.120, Speaker B: But if we look five years down the line, we'll see what happens.
00:53:50.090 - 00:53:53.042, Speaker A: I have some rapid fire questions prepared.
00:53:53.186 - 00:53:54.998, Speaker B: All right, well, that's what I want.
00:53:55.164 - 00:54:02.394, Speaker A: You just need to give sort of estimate in terms of numbers.
00:54:02.592 - 00:54:03.194, Speaker B: Sure.
00:54:03.312 - 00:54:08.890, Speaker A: First one v four TVL 180 days after Minnet launch.
00:54:10.690 - 00:54:12.430, Speaker B: What'S the V Three TVL?
00:54:13.090 - 00:54:14.320, Speaker A: I don't even know.
00:54:14.690 - 00:54:20.398, Speaker B: All right. How many days did you say?
00:54:20.564 - 00:54:21.770, Speaker A: 180.
00:54:21.850 - 00:54:25.890, Speaker B: Oh, 180. A billion.
00:54:26.390 - 00:54:33.890, Speaker A: A billion, okay. V Four LP's total return one year after launch.
00:54:36.650 - 00:54:38.038, Speaker B: In terms of fees or.
00:54:38.124 - 00:54:41.080, Speaker A: Markouts everything, total return.
00:54:45.610 - 00:54:49.500, Speaker B: Really depends. I don't know, but I think it's going to be better than V Three.
00:54:49.950 - 00:54:51.402, Speaker A: Okay. Better than V three.
00:54:51.536 - 00:54:58.234, Speaker B: To be better than V three. Significantly better because of the gas costs and other improvements that will happen.
00:54:58.432 - 00:55:04.670, Speaker A: V Four total volume as a percentage of Uniswap protocol volume 90 days After Launch.
00:55:06.690 - 00:55:14.820, Speaker B: There is a good chance that it will flip V Three to be honest. So I would expect it to flip v three and V two combined, probably.
00:55:15.350 - 00:55:17.380, Speaker A: So something like 60.
00:55:17.750 - 00:55:18.500, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:55:20.230 - 00:55:26.310, Speaker A: Number of hooks launched with the token or percentage of hooks launched with the token?
00:55:27.450 - 00:55:33.830, Speaker B: I hope that it will be high. I hope that there will be a hook almost on every pool.
00:55:37.210 - 00:55:41.702, Speaker A: No, the question is number of hooks launched with its own token.
00:55:41.846 - 00:56:00.880, Speaker B: Oh, hooks launched with its own token. Okay. Some people may not launch a token immediately. I think many people will. So probably going to be 80% if you give them enough time. I don't see why they wouldn't, but if you give them enough time, I think they will.
00:56:02.050 - 00:56:11.570, Speaker A: Percentage of uniswap V Four volume that go through a pool with a hook 180 days after launch.
00:56:12.790 - 00:56:21.986, Speaker B: I would hope that it's high. So I think that 80%, but I really hope that it's high and it's.
00:56:22.018 - 00:56:26.230, Speaker A: High because of the price.
00:56:26.380 - 00:56:49.742, Speaker B: Yeah. So I hope that there will be some hooks developed. Yes. I think it would be sad to see if basically it's just that the vanilla thing, kind of it's always the same thing. So I hope that people build really creative hooks. Maybe just something simple like having dynamic fees already could be a big improvement. So I think that those opportunities need to be picked up as well.
00:56:49.742 - 00:57:00.260, Speaker B: Of course, not having a hook has the advantage that it's a lower gas cost. Right. But I hope that people will come up with something creative. So this is why I would say 80%. That's my hope.
00:57:00.630 - 00:57:11.400, Speaker A: But we'll see percentage price improvement offered by uniswap X relative to the uniswap on chain liquidity by the end of 2023.
00:57:13.930 - 00:57:29.782, Speaker B: I feel that at most it's going to be 20% of the volume that actually gets price improvement. And again, it's based on what we see in other places. So probably 80% will still land on chain right away.
00:57:29.936 - 00:57:32.654, Speaker A: Sorry, I meant the amount.
00:57:32.772 - 00:57:47.554, Speaker B: The amount of the amount, yeah, the amount is an interesting question. I would say that 20% of time you will get 20% improvement. But I might be super duper wrong on this one. Again, I promise that I can embarrass myself.
00:57:47.752 - 00:57:52.370, Speaker A: Wait, sorry. I meant, for example, like number of basis points in price improvement.
00:57:52.950 - 00:58:07.480, Speaker B: Again, I think that 20% of time you will get maybe 20% improvement relative to your charge. So maybe if an order was executed and tenant would be executed at eight, and that would happen 20% of time. So 80% of orders will probably go to DEXes anyway.
00:58:08.250 - 00:58:17.770, Speaker A: But you're saying that the rest of them, like, for example, if my original output was ten E, I would now get twelve E out of X. Oh, no.
00:58:17.840 - 00:58:43.860, Speaker B: So that's the spread. Right. So I'm measuring this in the effective spread category. So if your execution cost, if the spread that you pay is ten basis points, then basically you would get eight basis points on top of that. I see it's going to be basis points. If you're thinking about the share of the overall amount, my prediction that it would be basis points, but maybe again, it prevents some tail events and so it's more than that.
00:58:44.890 - 00:58:49.400, Speaker A: Okay, think last question. What are you doing next?
00:58:53.370 - 00:59:29.918, Speaker B: I hope to make some announcements soon on this, but I'm really interested in working in mitigating some of these things, some of the problems that we discussed. So basically mitigating the losses to Arbitragers, improving execution quality on the existing DEXes on Uniswap before. So certainly we're thinking about developing some great hooks. So you asked me how much volume will go through them. I hope that the number is really high. So, yeah, we'll be making announcements when we're ready. But I think it's a fascinating area to be in.
00:59:29.918 - 00:59:34.270, Speaker B: Lots of stuff to build and certainly lots of questions to solve.
00:59:35.050 - 00:59:41.734, Speaker A: Well, thanks for sharing and Alex Naslobing, thank you very much for coming on the talk.
00:59:41.852 - 00:59:45.986, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you for having me, Shane. It's a pleasure. Bye.
