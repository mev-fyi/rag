00:00:00.410 - 00:00:04.590, Speaker A: Wait a little bit. Oh, do you want to go now, or do you want to sort of wait for people to join?
00:00:07.170 - 00:00:44.502, Speaker B: I have no idea of knowing how many people are in. Okay, yeah, I'm just going to start because there's no way of knowing how long I should wait. Hello, everyone. Welcome to the first ever DeFi research hour series hosted by Uniswap labs. Shin researcher at Uniswap Labs and co host of today's conversation. With me here is Austin, my colleague at Labs and co host for this space as well. Uniswap is the largest marketplace for on chain digital assets.
00:00:44.502 - 00:01:29.922, Speaker B: The tools we build are built upon the Uniswap Protocol, governed by independent and decentralized community of Uni token holders. And today is the largest decentralized trading protocol to date. The protocol has serviced over $1.5 trillion of transactions across multiple blockchains and never been hacked, making Uniswap one of the most trusted names in DeFi. Uniswap Labs is focused on building technology that enables users to swap tokens, buy NFTs, provide liquidity, and self custody their assets with confidence. The opinions expressed during today's conversation will be ours personally and not that of the labs. Our guest today is Siamek Molemi.
00:01:29.922 - 00:01:52.240, Speaker B: Siamek is a professor at the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University and the director of the Bridger Family Digital Finance Lab. CMX research areas include operations, research, market microstructure, blockchain technology, and quantitative trading. Ciamak has written three papers on AMMS, with potentially many more to come. Xiaomak, welcome.
00:01:52.870 - 00:01:55.460, Speaker C: Thank you. Jen and Austin, excited to be here.
00:01:56.790 - 00:02:09.080, Speaker B: First question you did your PhD in electrical engineering, I believe. What led you to go from studying message passing paradigm to financial markets, what's similar and what's different?
00:02:09.770 - 00:02:53.010, Speaker C: So that's a good starting point. I've always been interested in mathematical modeling and computation, and simultaneously, I've always been interested sort of in a little bit more the applied side. Like, I'm not a pure mathematician. I want to work on things that someone might implement and so on. And so for my PhD, I was working in electrical engineering. Broadly speaking, I was working in an area called stochastic control, where you're making decisions over time sequentially, and there's uncertainty about the future. So it's a combination of sort of stochastic modeling, thinking about probabilistic modeling of future outcomes, but also optimization.
00:02:53.010 - 00:03:34.046, Speaker C: Those were kind of the methodological things that excited me. Now, in e, the main applications for that kind of work are areas like controlling computer networks or robotics and so forth. After I graduated and I moved to Columbia, it's a business school. We're interested in sort of different problems. And I decided to work mainly in the area of quantitative finance. So, again, I'm still interested in stochastic control in the abstract. But the main applications I think about are things like quantitative trading, algorithmic trading, market microstructure these days, spending a lot of time thinking about blockchain.
00:03:34.046 - 00:04:08.220, Speaker C: So I think the core ideas are the same as in e, but just sort of the applications are different. And I think within business schools, that's actually sort of quite common. I think really over the past 20 years, ten years, five years, like the rest of society, business has gotten sort of more technical. So I think you're starting to see there's quite a lot of people like me from backgrounds like, let's say, electrical engineering or computer science or operations research, who've moved into business schools and are focused on applications to business problems.
00:04:10.190 - 00:04:28.370, Speaker A: Yeah, perfect. I think one of the questions that you brought up and sort of made a space in the AMM research world was your paper on loss versus rebalancing. So what is your paper on loss versus rebalancing? And when do you think it's a reasonable metric to use, and when do you think it's not for Ammlps?
00:04:29.270 - 00:05:12.442, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm obviously opinionated on this, but I think it's free to be opinionated. The right metric. Let me try to convince you in the audience why. So when we're sort of thinking about an AMM and you're thinking about possibly being a liquidity provider, there's a clear benefit, which is the fees, right? You're going to earn fees if people swap on an AMM. Now, the thing you have to be thinking about is what is the downside, what is the cost? Right? And I think this is a little bit more challenging because the cost is not really obvious. Right. If you bring up the uniswap GUI, it's sort of very clear that you're going to pay 30 basis points or five basis points or whatever the fee is, right.
00:05:12.442 - 00:05:55.514, Speaker C: But it's harder to think about the cost. Now, I think the community had largely sort of settled on this idea of impermanent loss as a form of cost. And indeed, if your choice is strictly between LP in a pool or just hoddling a position, then maybe impermanent loss is sort of the right thing. But I think that benchmark of hoddling is actually not the right thing because it conflates other things. And the main thing it conflates is it conflates market risk.
00:05:55.562 - 00:05:55.870, Speaker B: Right?
00:05:55.940 - 00:06:43.946, Speaker C: So when you're Lping, the number one driver of your PNL, is that basically your long tokens, your long tokens, you deposit them in the pool. First order thing is, are those tokens going up or are they going down? Right. To some extent, in my mind, that is orthogonal to whether you decided to be an LP or you decided to sort of do something else. So I think the right way to sort of look at isolate is this decision of Lping good enough or not, is to sort of get rid of the market risk. Right? And this is actually quite common in finance that's at the heart of options pricing and the black shoals model. Right. The great innovation of black shoals and that sort of options pricing literature that they won the Nobel Prize with is if we sort of eliminate the market risk.
00:06:43.946 - 00:08:16.678, Speaker C: If we delta hedge, if you will, then you'll sort of arrive at sort of the underlying value of the option. And so lever is basically the same idea of eliminating market risk but apply to an automated market maker. And the idea is, let's imagine a trading strategy where in addition to holding a position as an LP in an AMM, simultaneously, but separately, you hedge away the market risk by potentially shorting. Let's know, maybe hypothetically, maybe for real, but shorting, let's say on a centralized exchange, whatever exact tokens at any given time that you're holding in the AMM, right? So this would seek to eliminate that market risk and then whatever's left over, that's the natural profitability of the AMM. And what we see is that what's left over is two components, right? There's the fee income, which is a positive that helps the LPs, but the negative, the cost component is lever and we interpret that as basically the money that's paid to arbitrars, right? And so that interpretation is that if you have an AMM, it's sitting on chain at any given time. It doesn't know what the fair value is of the asset, it's just a smart contract, right? Meanwhile, this asset is trading maybe on other chains, maybe on centralized exchanges and so on and so forth. Arbitragers will come and will exploit the fact that the AMM has stale prices, right? So let's say you're trading something like you're trading ETH versus USDC.
00:08:16.678 - 00:09:19.326, Speaker C: If the price ticks up a bit on binance arbitragers or searchers or whoever you want will come in and they will buy at the stale prices on chain until the on chain and off chain prices match. This is of course a cost, right, because the arbitragers are only buying when it's profitable and it's a zero sum transaction between the arbitrageures and the LPs in the chain. So whenever the ARBs are making money, the people on the chain are losing money, right? And so this becomes the fundamental cost of being a liquidity provider. It's like being any kind of market maker. With any kind of market maker, the thing you always suffer from is adverse selection. You suffer from trading with people who have more information than you and AMMS aren't any different. But the particular form of adverse selection is that these arbitragers who have better information and that they know better estimates of what the market price is, they can pick off the AMM and they'll make money.
00:09:19.326 - 00:10:20.610, Speaker C: And you have to account for that when you are valuing your position in the mean. In my mind, it's sort of the core way to look at it and I think should be universal. Now, let me just pause and make a statement about where it's not the case. Again, the idea of lever is coming from Black Shoals and Dynamically Hedging and that works to the extent that you can dynamically hedge, right? So with this idea of maybe hedging your risk assumes that there is some other place, let's say centralized exchange or whatever, where you can short and get rid of your risk. And that may or may not be true. Like maybe if you're trading ETH versus USDC, you can short on centralized exchanges and so on. But maybe if you're out in the long tail of a token, may not even trade anywhere else, right? It's sort of not clear that that's the right model.
00:10:20.610 - 00:11:52.522, Speaker C: So it is predicated on being able to sort of frictionlessly dynamically trade the asset. That said, I will argue even in those instances it's still a helpful model, even though you can't maybe literally interpret it and literally go out there and delta hedge. And the reason is the same as the Black Scholes model. People use the Black Scholes model all the time in environments where you can't dynamically trade. For example, if you work for a startup and you get stock options, how do they value those stock options? They use the black scholes formula, right? Well, you can't take the Black Scholes formula literally in that context because you can't trade dynamically in a non public company, right? So nevertheless, I think it provides an important source of input, some notion of fair value and so I think their lever applies also even for assets that may or may not centrally trade. I'll make one other sort of comment. I think you can start to see ways why lever is superior to impermanent loss, right? The first thing is that a lever versus impermanent loss is actually permanent, right? When you lose money to Arbitragers, you never get that money back, right? So lever is kind of in some sense a true loss, right? Whereas in permanent loss it includes lever as a component, but it also includes market risk, right? And the market risk is the difference between whatever the hoddling position was and whatever the current position is in the AMM at the time you're looking at it.
00:11:52.522 - 00:12:55.570, Speaker C: So the reason why impermanent loss is not literally not permanent is because it includes market risk, whereas a lever doesn't. I think another sort of reason to start to see why impermanent loss isn't the right concept is if you think about impermanent loss, it's not path dependent. My impermanent loss depends on where I started and where I finished, but nothing on what happens in between versus if you think about the act of market making, of course, what happens in between matters, right? For example, if the market is more volatile, if prices are constantly jumping up and down, you're going to get picked off as an LP more often by Arbitragers or searchers than if the market is not choppy, right? But lever is explicitly path dependent. In fact, a lever ends up varying with the variance. It looks like you're sort of paying out variance, right? So I think there's a whole bunch of arguments I would make that certainly it's the right concept versus impermanent loss.
00:12:57.370 - 00:13:58.658, Speaker B: I think there's this one perspective, or maybe even criticism, if you want to call it, but it says that, as you said, lever requires dynamic hedging. And as you said, sometimes it's not even feasible when there's no different marketplace where you can execute that hedge. The other aspect of that is not everyone has access or ability to carry out those hedging trades. And so it's not really an actionable item for the median user of uniswap. And if you think about, for example, traditional portfolios theory, et cetera, the suggestion or the benchmark is really kind of very actionable, right? It just suggests that you buy SMP index and don't do anything else, which is very actionable. For me, for example, I think that's.
00:13:58.674 - 00:14:50.570, Speaker C: A great example, Jean, but if you look at portfolio theory, it'll tell you to hold a certain percentage in the S P index, right? So in theory you're supposed to be rebalancing, right? So maybe you rebalance once a month, maybe you rebalance once every six months, right. Lever is the same thing. It's periodically rebalanced to hedge your risk. Right? I don't think that's a burden. I think certainly if there was demand for it, people could sort of offer that as a service. I do think a bigger burden is if you want to short, it's sort of expensive to short, right? So if there was, let's say it looked like the pool is profitable if you hedge. In the work I've done, I sort of assume that you trade at mid market and I assume that there's no cost to holding that short.
00:14:50.570 - 00:15:33.634, Speaker C: In reality, in the crypto world, everything's expensive. So if you're going to hold a giant short for a long period of time, then that will probably swamp whatever money you're making or losing in the thing. Again, I think if you want to take the model literally, you're right, you may not be able to sort of delta hedge, but again, I think even in the absence of taking it literally, I think the model has values. And again, I would just point at options markets, right, or general. I mean, people use options pricing in all kinds of settings where you can't dynamically trade. Is it a number that you can guarantee so that if this is not the price, that there's an arbitrage?
00:15:33.682 - 00:15:33.990, Speaker A: No.
00:15:34.060 - 00:15:52.140, Speaker C: Right. But nevertheless, it's an input to sort of think about what is the cost you're giving up. I would argue that whether or not you can hedge, there is a real cost to being an LP where people are going to pick you off if your price is still they're going to pick you off when they have more information and you need to quantify that in some way.
00:15:53.630 - 00:16:01.886, Speaker A: What do you say to the people who refer to lever as LVR? Do you think that lever is sort of the right way that it should be said? What do you say to them?
00:16:01.988 - 00:16:07.678, Speaker C: Absolutely. Otherwise it doesn't sound nearly as sick. I like lever.
00:16:07.774 - 00:16:25.320, Speaker A: Okay, good. I'm a big stickler for how people say things. ETH or mev, I'm always like, you got to say it the right way. So I talked to someone who's called it LVR and I was like, no, it's definitely a lever. So I just wanted to hear from the source what you felt about it.
00:16:26.090 - 00:16:26.840, Speaker C: Perfect.
00:16:30.190 - 00:16:47.150, Speaker B: Okay. A lot of people have been kind of taking the concept and trying to bring it to life, so to speak. What do you think mechanism designers can do with respect to the idea of lever?
00:16:49.330 - 00:18:52.390, Speaker C: So I think you want to mitigate it. I mean, I think it's a bad thing. It's basically money that is being taken from the liquidity providers and is going to sort of arbitrage yours and is getting in the way of welfare improving trade. So just to sort of maybe take a step back and set up what the goal of a mechanism designer should be in general. The way I like to think about markets, and I think that it's sort of pretty universal in economics at this point, is that the goal of a market is to take goods, let's say a token or whatever, from someone who has low Idiosyncratic value to it and trade it for someone who has high Idiosyncratic value, right. How much you pay and who gets paid, that doesn't matter because those are zero sum, right? Like if I, let's say, buy a token from usion and I pay one dollars or I pay $2, again, more money I pay, the less money, the more money you receive and so on, that sort of nets out, right? But if I have a higher intrinsic value for that token and you have a lower intrinsic value, then the net of that transaction is that a NetNet we're both better off, right? So what you really want to do is you want to find mechanisms where organic sellers are able to transfer to organic buyers as much as possible and how much is paid by who sort of doesn't matter, right? Except if there are intermediaries, like, let's say arbitragers or Searchers, right? They are taking money, but they have no special value for the asset. They're just taking money and they don't have a special Idiosyncratic value low or high for the asset, right? So if you have, let's say, arbitrageurs who are taking this lever money from LPs, what will happen is, on the margin, people will LP a little bit less because there are some losses potentially associated with Lping, right? And if they LP less, then there will be less trades.
00:18:52.390 - 00:19:56.010, Speaker C: And now all of a sudden you're going to start to get a welfare loss, right? So the idea is that paying these arbitragers is just strictly a worse for everyone from the perspective of welfare. So what we should try to do is to mitigate that. And I think there's lots of ideas related to sort of how to do that. And let me just list a bunch which I've heard people describe, right? So one idea is, rather than having prices be set by people trading against the pool, to the extent that you have good price sources, maybe have prices be set by something like an oracle. In that instance, the oracle could move price and if you move a price without anybody trading against you, the pool hasn't lost money. Other ideas are to sort of think about things like fees. Fees are another kind of friction that prevent arbitragers trading against you.
00:19:56.010 - 00:20:14.306, Speaker C: Now, you have to be careful about fees because fees are also a friction for the organic traders, right? So one way, for example, to eliminate lever is to make your fees extremely high. If you make your fees extremely high, then you won't lose money to arbitragers because they won't trade with you, because nobody is trading with you.
00:20:14.328 - 00:20:14.562, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:14.616 - 00:21:21.346, Speaker C: But that also defeats the purpose of the mechanism. So one might think about more intelligently setting fees. For example, having fees vary with volatility, right? I don't know if it should be with should it vary with volatility or volatility squared or what, but all things being equal, the more volatile markets are, the more of this arbitrage there's going to be with people picking off stale prices because the more often prices will be stale. Right. So thinking about setting fees in that way, I think another class of mechanism is thinking about maybe having a designated class of arbitragers. So, for example, if you could enforce, let's say you have a pool and the fee is 30 basis points, maybe you could whitelist some participants, let's call them arbitrageures and give them the ability to trade zero basis point fee. If they can trade with a zero basis point fee, they will be more aggressive to trade and they will more often police so that the price on the pool is equal to sort of the price across the market of the asset.
00:21:21.346 - 00:22:00.130, Speaker C: By virtue of being able to trade with no fee, you're sort of creating a priority mechanism where these people can ARB earlier. Now, you don't want to do this for nothing. Maybe they pay a rent to you to do that, or maybe you auction off this, right? But that's another mechanism where maybe different than something like an Oracle, where you're trying to control this value extraction instead of letting the market take it through competition by auctioning it off. You can try to monetize it and maybe feed it back to the LPs. But I think this is a major challenge to sort of mitigate how much LPs lose to arbitragers.
00:22:00.870 - 00:22:27.530, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a very difficult problem and one that it'll be interesting to see how people come up with solutions for it. I think sort of one solution that people have brought up as sort of a new market structure that could be used are dark pools. And I know that you've written a lot about dark pools and you've talked about how they enhance welfare for whom. So do you think crypto falls into the regime that you've described and who do you think will really benefit from the introduction of dark pools in crypto?
00:22:30.450 - 00:22:46.014, Speaker C: I think with a lot of these things there's counterbalancing effects. I think the principle I would use to sort of think about it is does it enhance that concept of social welfare? Does it enhance gains from trade?
00:22:46.062 - 00:22:46.226, Speaker A: Right?
00:22:46.248 - 00:23:13.354, Speaker C: Does it make it easier for people with low Idiosyncratic value to sell the thing to people with high Idiosyncratic value? If you think about, let's say, a dark pool just to sort of keep things a little bit simpler, the crypto world is very complicated and you have centralized limit order books, you have AMMS and so on. Let's just imagine you had a limit order book and you're thinking of introducing a dark pool in parallel to that.
00:23:13.392 - 00:23:13.690, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:13.760 - 00:23:40.130, Speaker C: So how do I view a dark pool? I view a dark pool as a mechanism where basically it's sort of like a limit order book in the sense that people are matched. Right. However the orders aren't exposed. Right. And also many people put in orders that don't have a limit price attached but instead are meant to match at, quote unquote, mid market. Right. So like typically in US.
00:23:40.130 - 00:24:44.262, Speaker C: Equities, the mid market would be the NBBO, the mid of the national best bid and offer. And so you might put an order in in a dark pool that says, look, I want to buy 1000 shares of something and at any point in time I'm willing to pay the mid price of the NBBO. Right? Now this type of order is not going to get first thing to realize about this order is, number one, you typically save versus directly trading on a mechanism because you're not paying a bid offer spread, right? So in terms of explicit costs, if I want to immediately trade in a limit order book like let's say I have to pay half the spread in a dark pool, I'm trading on mid market. That part is better, right? The part that's worse is I'm not sure if I'm going to trade because there has to be someone on the other side in the dark pool who is going to be matched against me, who wants to sell to me at mid market. So you've lowered the explicit cost but you've increased the risk of execution. And what typically happens is you end up trading when you don't want to. Right? So for example, I may end up buying right before the price goes up, right.
00:24:44.262 - 00:24:59.434, Speaker C: Or you may end up selling right? Excuse me? You end up buying right before the price goes down. Right. So you sort of expose regret it a little bit, right. Or you end up selling right before the price goes up. Right? So in other words, there's a flavor of adverse selection you have to think about.
00:24:59.472 - 00:24:59.674, Speaker A: Right?
00:24:59.712 - 00:25:54.198, Speaker C: Again, your orders won't execute for certain and more often than not when they execute, you will slightly regret it exports because of this, what happens is the kind of people who want to use dark pools are people which I will call in the finance parlance, uninformed. Right? Now, what I mean by that is not a pejorative. It's not that they don't know anything or they're dumb or something like that. It's just that they don't have short term information, short term alpha, right? So there are some people in the market who want to trade because the price is going up in the next five minutes or the next hour or something like that. And there's some people who don't have that kind of information. They're trading for other reasons. Maybe they just like this thing for the long term or it fits in their portfolio or just a longer time horizon or whatever that population of people are the population of people who are going to use a dark pool because they're patient, right? They can sit there and they can potentially wait over time and wait for that order to sort of fill.
00:25:54.198 - 00:26:26.450, Speaker C: So those people get an option. That's good, right. But on balance, what happens is when you introduce a dark pool, you have to sort of think about the equilibrium effects. What you're doing is you're pulling some of the uninformed traders away from trading in the lit markets. And what that means is that the lit markets are going to be populated with the sharks. It's going to be populated with the people who are trading because they know what's going to happen in five minutes or they have some prediction or so on. And so in equilibrium there's a possibility that actually spreads in the lit market will increase.
00:26:26.450 - 00:27:03.554, Speaker C: Right? So again, it's complicated and there's not a simple answer. You have counterbalancing effects. On the one hand, introducing a mechanism for people to exchange that's sort of uniformly better, right? It feels like you're giving people more choice. There's more chance for these organic sellers to sell to these organic buyers and vice versa. On the other hand, because you're siphoning away this uninformed flow, you're making the original limit order book market or dealer market, you're making that more toxic. And spreads are increasing and spreads increasing is bad for welfare, right? Because again, it makes it harder to trade. So I think it's difficult to say.
00:27:03.554 - 00:27:22.860, Speaker C: And I think the right answer is you have to sort of think about these things in equilibrium. You can't think about in isolation what happens to Stark pool. You also have to think, well, what is the introduction of the Star pool? What are the implications for the behavior of other mechanisms and people who are not using the dark pool themselves?
00:27:23.710 - 00:27:37.520, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. I've seen some research on AMM dark pools. So there's been a lot of talk about do they work, are they good? So do you have a sort of opinion on an AMM based dark pool instead of sort of a central order book based one?
00:27:39.170 - 00:27:47.522, Speaker C: I haven't thought about that. I don't have strong views. Are there on chain dark pools? How would that work?
00:27:47.656 - 00:28:09.640, Speaker A: There are no on chain dark pools currently. I think they're sort of in the stage of do they have value, should someone build them? Because obviously dark like ZK proofs and things like that on chain are very difficult. So there's been some talk about them, a lot of people are very interested in them. I'm sort of unclear if they work or if they have value long term over some of like a limit market or things like.
00:28:11.850 - 00:28:59.180, Speaker C: I mean I think it sort of comes down to the same two effects. One thing that's a little bit OD about an AMM right now is that if I have a buyer arrives and then a seller arrives 2 seconds later, they're somehow not matched, they somehow both have to trade against and pay spreads and so forth versus if you could somehow match them instantly, they should be matched instantly. Right? Because no one has to take risk or only risk for a short period of time. So I think in that sense they're good. But in another sense if you end up again matching these uninformed traders and pulling them away from interacting with the LPs, what you're going to get is the flow to the LPs is going to be more toxic. So there's going to be larger lever or adverse selection or whatever your cost metric is.
00:28:59.630 - 00:29:00.780, Speaker A: That makes sense.
00:29:01.470 - 00:29:47.880, Speaker B: Here's a question that I have regarding the comment on the net equilibrium might be better or worse compared to the counterfactual where you don't have the introduction of a new place. Is it possible even to find out ahead of time? Because once you have introduced a new thing and you sort of already find out what the equilibrium is realized and that might be too late, right? You can't unitroduce the thing or I don't know if you can, but is there any way for us to model it realistically and find out ahead of it and kind of decide what's a better thing to introduce than not?
00:29:48.270 - 00:30:37.510, Speaker C: Yeah, I think you're pointing at an excellent challenge. I think we can sort of write down small models and show that, hey, again, things could be better, things could be worse. But I think it's really hard to say. The world is complicated and you can't model everything. I think also in the crypto world there's another aspect which is let's say we hypothetically agree that dark pools are a bad idea. How are you going to enforce that? If someone can profitably run a dark pool, they're going to do that, right? So even if it's a worse equilibrium for everyone. If the dark pool operator or the dark pool participants, if it's good for them, it will likely happen in a decentralized setting.
00:30:40.600 - 00:31:30.690, Speaker B: Nice. I agree. I guess another kind of mechanism, somewhat similar maybe in spirit, but implemented very differently, is the idea of payment for order flow, where you take out all the nontoxic flow and you sort of promise them I don't know if it will be realized, but you promise them execution improvement. But on the other hand, you kind of create this lift market where everyone is a shark. What's your mental model of how it has been working in the traditional market? Has it been doing well? What's the problem with it? And are you seeing this trend in crypto or not?
00:31:32.760 - 00:32:26.516, Speaker C: I've always had concerns about payment for order flow. To be fair, I haven't sort of looked carefully at data and tried to sort of carefully understand it. But just intuitively, I feel that there's sort of potential problems. I think there's two flavors of a potential problem. Sort of. The first flavor is that it is clearly better for retail traders, right? So if you're a retail trader and someone is paying for your order, like A, you're not paying commission, b maybe you're getting a small price improvement, it's clearly better for one set of market participants, right? I think you have to ask the broader question, though. Is it better for the market overall? And I think it's sort of the same issue we discussed before.
00:32:26.516 - 00:33:51.180, Speaker C: If you pull away this, again, quote unquote, uninformed, uninformed, in the sense of no short term alpha not being pejorative at all towards retail traders, but if you pull away this, let's say, less toxic flow, then the remaining flow is going to be more toxic and the overall market quality might be worse, right? And I think it's not clear necessarily you want to optimize for retail traders, right? For example, let's say in the equity markets, probably the vast majority of trading is institutional often. Certainly the vast majority of trading on my behalf is like index funds and so on. That's primarily where I invest, right? So it's not clear that we really want to design a market where we privilege a small subset of the trading and maybe reduce the market quality overall. Now, again, it's an empirical question. One should attest and measure whether the extent to which this effect occurs, and I haven't, so I'm speculating in that dimension. But I think that's one problem and I think that would hold true in crypto also. In crypto, again, effectively it's a mechanism for price discrimination, right? If you begin to get some information about who you're trading with, right, the lowest bit being are they retail or are they not? Maybe eventually you could sort of know their identity.
00:33:51.180 - 00:34:52.048, Speaker C: Well, then you're going to end up customizing quotes for people and so on. And again, maybe better for some people, but not clear that overall it's going to be better. I think there's another issue that exists in the TradFi world that maybe doesn't have a crypto analog and that's sort of the inherent conflict of interest. Right. The other thing that sort of worries me about payment for order flow is you have a decision being made about where the order is going to go and the person who's making that decision is the brokerage and they usually are not fully aligned with the interests of the retail trader whose order that they're routing. Right. Namely they're going to route it to some wholesaler maybe who knows what that decision is based on? Is that decision based on the retail trader getting the best price improvement or is it based on how much the wholesaler is paying the broker and so on? As far as I can tell, they're sort of opaque, privately negotiated mechanisms.
00:34:52.048 - 00:35:55.940, Speaker C: I think the advantage of crypto is at least what I've heard about payment for order flow in crypto is that people view it as more of an open mechanism of like, yes, maybe we will auction this retail order flow because it's valuable. But number one, the proceeds of the auction are going to be directed back to the retail traders themselves. And number two, the auction is going to be conducted in an open way where sort of anybody can participate. And it's not a negotiation between a large brokerage and a couple of large proprietary traders. And everyone else is in the dark. So I think that second aspect where there's this kind of principal agent problem, if you will, I think that won't exist in the crypto world or at least not in the decentralized crypto world. I don't know about decentralized crypto world and so that is, I think, better directionally.
00:35:56.100 - 00:36:27.040, Speaker B: According to your intuition, are there market characteristics that would make a certain market better suited for these type of payment for order flow kind of market structure? Is it a market where there's less liquidity but more speculators? Is it a market that's more volatile? What kind of characteristic would you be looking for when you think of introducing such mechanism?
00:36:28.680 - 00:36:52.170, Speaker C: I think that's a good question. My initial reaction would be that if you have markets where are dominated by the, let's say retail traders, I think it's more likely that the payment for order flow would be better. But I should be careful. I haven't carefully thought about it.
00:36:53.660 - 00:36:59.390, Speaker B: Yes, sorry, I just came up with the question. So yeah, I haven't thought about it either.
00:37:00.640 - 00:37:11.650, Speaker A: Yeah, we can probably sort of transition. So used to be a trader. So how has your trading experience helped your research and which helps the other more academic research or quant trading type of research?
00:37:12.500 - 00:38:05.712, Speaker C: I think both. Going back to a little bit what I was talking about at the beginning, I'm an applied mathematician. I want there to be an application and so I think the advantage of doing practical stuff of doing sort of actual trading and so on, is that practitioners get to the problems early, right? Like, you guys identify the problems, you identify what the issue is and so on, because in some sense, you're interacting with the real world. I think AMMS are a great example of this. If you had explained to me the idea of a constant product, a market maker, like, let's say in 2020, my reaction would have been like, this is a bad idea. This is not going to work. You should just have a limit order book, right? And I'm someone who actually I have some background in the original prediction markets literature and market scoring rules and so on.
00:38:05.712 - 00:38:51.568, Speaker C: It wouldn't have been a foreign idea, but my reaction would have been that none of the market scoring rule stuff worked. Why should this work? Well, you know what? I was wrong, right? And the people who figured out I was wrong were the practitioners. And I think the evidence is the fact that there's massive volume on these systems now, right? So I think the practitioners identify the problems first. They sort of get to the heart of the matter. As an academic, I can sort of make up problems, but it's literally that I'm just making it up right now. I think where the academics have an advantage is that we're not really under time pressure, and so we can be more patient. And also, I think there's more of a premium for sort of coming up with an elegant model and for thinking clearly about something.
00:38:51.568 - 00:39:39.280, Speaker C: In my experience, in practice, you're just under a lot of pressure to come up with the answer. If it's like a reasonable number and it seems to work okay, but you can't prove it or you don't have a theory behind it or anything, that's fine. Again, that's totally reasonable. I don't mean to criticize someone. If you're a quant trader, your number one goal should be to make a lot of money in a risk adjusted way or whatever, right. Your number one goal isn't to sort of understand theory of markets, right? Maybe some of that will come along, but again, in industry, you should be very pragmatic. I think where the academics come in is, again, coming up with a right way to sort of think about things, understand what are the true underlying forces that are going on.
00:39:39.280 - 00:40:03.880, Speaker C: So, personally, I'd like to have a foot in both worlds. I mean, I'm mainly an academic. I've been doing this for 15 plus years. But I have run statar quantitative trading strategies. I've done fixed income relative value as well. And I think seeing how the markets operate at a ground level gives you a real appreciation for what are the important problems to work on as an academic.
00:40:06.700 - 00:40:31.410, Speaker B: Cool. Okay, so I think one of the unsolved mystery of practitioners is the performance of the Medallion Fund, which I've noticed you've written column articles about who do you think are the most likely to uncover their secrets? Either uncover it by successfully replicating them or uncover it by writing about them.
00:40:33.300 - 00:41:13.880, Speaker C: I think it's fun to speculate. I think the reality is obviously Renaissance and Medallion in particular have been extraordinarily successful. Eventually, I think those guys will somehow leak what's going on. I would like to speculate. I think there's a couple of ingredients to the success. I think, number one, Jim Simons has run an incredible kind of recruiting machine. My understanding is this may not even be current, but I think they have on the order of several hundred sort of PhD level researchers.
00:41:13.880 - 00:42:10.236, Speaker C: And I think the amazing thing is nobody leaves, right? So I think a quite common thing that happens at many other quant hedge funds is after a while people leave and the alpha leaves with them. I think through some combination of ironclad non competes, but also really paying people a lot of money. Jim Simons has sort of built an organization where they haven't had that much alpha leak. And I think one interesting aspect of it is my understanding is that internally they're open, right? So just to give you a little bit of perspective, quantitative trading shops usually operate in two ways, right? One style is called the Siloed style, where you may be like, let's say an alpha researcher. You're working on your own particular alphas or machine learning models or whatever, and maybe some alpha researchers are sitting to your left and to your right, but you don't talk to each other about what you're working on, right? You talk to your manager. And information is very tightly controlled. And that's for reasons that you don't want people knowing the secrets.
00:42:10.236 - 00:42:52.440, Speaker C: You don't want people leaving with the secrets later on. Right, but the downside of that is nobody likes to work in that environment, right? In my entire experience in academia and in industry, people want to collaborate, people want to talk with their neighbors and bounce their ideas and so on, right? So the other model is you have a more open model where people are working on their own projects, but you know what other people are working on and you bounce ideas and so on. Of course, that comes with much larger IP risks. So my understanding is Renaissance has the second model. They're open book, right? But somehow they're able to do this without the IP risk. So I think hats off to them. They've sort of managed it very well, I think to dive into a technical point and this is now real speculation.
00:42:52.440 - 00:43:29.384, Speaker C: I have no way of knowing any of this stuff, by the way. I don't have any contacts at Renaissance. This is just anecdotes of talking with people. I think I understand that one of the main things that Renaissance does better than other people is thinking about transaction costs and understanding how to have a sort of trade right at the heart of sort of quantitative trading. There's kind of two steps, right? One step is the alpha step. You make predictions, right? Like what's going to happen in five minutes, an hour, a week, two weeks, whatever. Is the price going up, going down? But then the second step is once you have a bunch of predictions, you have to monetize them.
00:43:29.384 - 00:44:38.930, Speaker C: You have to sort of decide what portfolio are you going to form? How are you going to trade it? Are you going to aggressively try to get into this position? Is it going to be slower? So on and so forth. And one key ingredient of that is understanding how much it costs to get into a position, right? Namely, in general, the faster and more aggressively you trade, the more you are paying. And I think a common kind of rule of thumb for quant trading is you never want to be like, let's say more than just to make up a round number, let's say 5% or 10% of the market, right? If you're at any point in time you're more than 5% or 10% of the trading volume, then you're really maybe pushing prices. And it's hard to know exactly. Like, you see the price go up, but maybe you're the one driving it up and maybe you're ultimately going to lose money. My understanding is that Renaissance has just a much more sophisticated understanding of this, is willing to just trade way more aggressively than other people because they have that understanding and are able to sort of monetize their predictions better than other people. But that's just sort of a pure, pure speculation on my part.
00:44:39.780 - 00:44:44.770, Speaker A: We always love pure speculation, so we're always happy to hear anyone's ideas on that.
00:44:47.460 - 00:45:13.400, Speaker B: Okay, moving on to Hot Topic of the day. Mev. So mev is, I guess, one of the hottest topic on crypto Twitter nowadays. What do you think is the current frontier, and is there anything in the current proposal to address it that you would like to propose improvement upon?
00:45:14.400 - 00:46:37.296, Speaker C: So I think this is the most important issue, certainly in DeFi. I mean, people compare it a lot to front running in TradFi markets, but the reality is, despite what you might have read in Flashboys or what Michael Lewis wrote, I don't think there's really so much front running in TradFi markets, right? To most extent, putting aside the retail business, the orders are confidential until they execute. So here in the crypto world, first of all, that's not true, right? You have the whole concept of the mempool and so on and beyond that, because of the complexity of smart contracts, the range of possible mev is like infinitely complex relative to what you might imagine in a TradFi market. So I think it's a major problem. Probably hacking is the number one problem in DeFi, but maybe the number two problem is mev. I think people are doing a couple of things. I think they're generic mechanisms mechanisms like, let's say, Flash bots or maybe proposer builder separation, which I sort of view as maybe a decentralized version of Flashbots.
00:46:37.296 - 00:48:07.900, Speaker C: And these are kind of generic solutions in that they are meant to sort of deal sort of simultaneously with sort of any form of mev, any form of advantage you can get by controlling the sequence of transactions. I think that's one way to go at it. I think the issue of that is in my mind, maybe oftentimes mev can be better addressed depending on what the problem is, right? So maybe mev, for example, is different for an automated market maker than for a collateralized lending pool than for an NFT marketplace and so on and so and I think the alternative, which is sort of a little bit more. The direction I've been thinking is to try and address it at a protocol by protocol level. Again, depending on the nature of the protocol and what it does, And I think one sort of major advantage of this is if you look at addressing things at the consensus level, at the layer one level, like for example with Flashbots, what happens with Flashbots is that all of the mev goes to the miners, right? And to some extent there's still positive things about that like, okay, so we don't have priority gas auctions and that's great. So the externalities of mev to others are less. But to another extent, when you generate this cash flow for miners, what does that do? I mean, it's just going to incent more mining activity, right? Is that good or bad? Well, I mean, it depends on whether the chain is secure or insecure.
00:48:07.900 - 00:49:19.370, Speaker C: It has nothing to do with the application though, right? Like as an alternative, you might take a particular form of mev. Like let's take lever. Lever is a form of mev, right? It's the money arbitragers extract statistically trading an AMM versus, let's say, a centralized order book, right? I think better mechanisms would look at that lever and instead of paying lever off to the miners, they would pay lever to the LPs, right, because the LPs are the one who are actually paying it. If you could somehow refund it to them, what would happen is that now all of a sudden on the margin, it's more profitable to be an LP. You get more Lping, you get more gains from trade, you get more social welfare, right? So I think, like, for example, for specific, like lever, which is something I thought about a lot, that is the right mechanism. You need to think about it in protocol because you want to sort of think about how do I redirect it to the right participant? The other alternative of just giving it to the miners, okay? I mean, it's nice that you have a competitive mechanism there and so on, but again, all that's going to happen is you're going to have more mining and it's not clear that that's going to generate gains from trade and improved welfare. I think it's an enormous issue.
00:49:19.370 - 00:50:10.376, Speaker C: I don't know how to solve it. But one comment is I think it's important to look at it at the application level. I think a second kind of comment is it's not universally a good or bad thing. So I think people would generally view, and I would agree, that sandwich attacks are a bad form of mev, right. The fact that that exists, it's sort of subtracting value from the trader, making them less likely to trade. It's going into the pocket of the just kind of no benefit to that. On the other hand, one might argue that maybe something like liquidation, that's a good form of mev, right, in the sense that if you have a lending pool like Compound or Aave, you need liquidators there, right.
00:50:10.376 - 00:50:38.640, Speaker C: Because if you didn't have liquidation then eventually loads could come unhealthy and sort of people lose money. So I think, again, this also argues for sort of thinking about mev at more of a protocol level. Now, that doesn't mean I don't think we should think about things like PBS or central auctions, like Flashbots or so forth. I think those mechanisms are also interesting, but I think this has to be addressed at both levels.
00:50:40.600 - 00:50:56.280, Speaker A: Yeah, it's definitely an important problem and I think a lot of people are trying to solve it. So hopefully soon we'll see some more improvements, I guess. Lastly, what sort of advice would you give to someone who's intellectually interested in DeFi?
00:50:57.980 - 00:51:50.712, Speaker C: I think it's a great place to be intellectually interested because it's a very open place. So I think sort of relative to sort of becoming interested in TradFi somehow there's a much lower barrier to entry. The data is all there. It's easy to get sort of on chain data, even the exchange based data more often you can get for free. It's important that most things are open source. Like if I want to see how the Uniswap contract works, I can look at it on GitHub, right? If I want to know exactly how Nasdaq works, good luck getting them to sort of tell you anything. Right? And I think the third aspect is sort of the open culture, all the discords and people talking on Twitter and having us chat with guys like you and so on.
00:51:50.712 - 00:51:55.176, Speaker C: I guarantee that if you guys worked for Renaissance Technologies, we would not be having this live stream right now.
00:51:55.198 - 00:51:56.990, Speaker A: Right, you wouldn't know who you are.
00:51:57.760 - 00:52:41.610, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think my advice is get out there and look at stuff. And again, I think there's a lot of opportunities in sort of thinking about, let's say, like there's a new product and trying to analyze it with conventional tools and so on. Just to be clear, I'm talking about this from a research perspective. I'm not sure that this is a space to sort of invest your money in, aside from just sort of understanding how the space works and so on. But from a research perspective, I think it's a very exciting place with lots of new and interesting problems.
00:52:42.540 - 00:52:58.352, Speaker A: Do you have any sort of advice for people who are, like, PhD students who are in operations research or people who are on the margin traders? Does your advice change at all for them, or do you think it's sort of like a good place to be for operations research folks, especially just specifically for the research part?
00:52:58.406 - 00:53:12.032, Speaker C: Obviously, I think the research questions are very interesting. I think if I was giving some advice, some of it would also depend on sort of what you want to do downstream.
00:53:12.096 - 00:53:12.468, Speaker A: Right.
00:53:12.554 - 00:53:59.170, Speaker C: So the reality is, although there's a lot of interest in crypto in academia, it's a little bit of a niche topic, right? And it's a little bit spread out across different worlds. Like, there's a lot of people in CS interested, some people in or some people in business schools. I think this makes it attractive. Like, I love interacting and collaborating in this sort of interdisciplinary way. But from the perspective of, let's say you're a PhD student and you're strategizing about, how do I get that assistant professor job, these kind of things make it a little bit harder. And that's just the unfortunate reality of academia is it's a little bit of a rigid place and it's very slow moving. The flip side is there's actually positive things about that.
00:53:59.170 - 00:54:59.030, Speaker C: It's been almost a year since maybe the crypto bear market started, and you can see sort of activity slowing on the industry side, but on the academic side, if anything, the activity is more and more and more right. Like, I think, for example, I was just at the AFA conference, the American Financial Association in New Orleans in January. There was one session on market microstructure, probably around six or seven sessions on various blockchain related topics. So I think, if anything, right now, just because we're slow and we're more deliberative, I think there's a lot more interest in crypto on the academic side because people really don't care about what's going on in the marketplace with token prices and so on. But they are starting to see that there's very interesting mechanisms and technologies there. So I'm sort of quite bullish on that. But the reality is it's not 100% a mainstream topic in academia yet.
00:55:00.120 - 00:55:25.100, Speaker A: Yeah, we've seen a lot of professors and things like that who have been really interested in it and pushing the field forward, which is nice, especially during this bear market, to see sort of more interest from the academic crowd, I guess, like, last question. Sort of anything that you think we missed, anything that you want to talk about? Anything that is on your mind, that you sort of want to shout out from the rooftops.
00:55:26.900 - 00:55:28.176, Speaker C: Yeah, now that you put me on.
00:55:28.198 - 00:55:29.890, Speaker A: The spot, I know I feel bad.
00:55:30.900 - 00:56:01.288, Speaker C: No, but I think it's great stuff. I'm excited you guys are starting this research hour. And again, I was sort of saying this in my advice to PhD students, but I think one really nice thing about me, my own experience in the crypto world is the fact that researchers, industry such as yourselves, and people at other firms, I'm so open to a discussion and engagement with outsiders such as myself. So keep up the good work.
00:56:01.454 - 00:56:08.680, Speaker A: We're hoping to. We're hoping to. It was a great initial talk. Do you sort of want to end it up shin?
00:56:09.100 - 00:56:28.528, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, thanks a lot for being our inaugural guest, and thanks everyone who joined us today. This hopefully will be occurring every two weeks from now, barring some vacation plans, but hopefully we'll see you guys in the next one.
00:56:28.694 - 00:56:29.104, Speaker C: All right.
00:56:29.142 - 00:56:34.000, Speaker A: If you have any sort of advice, anything, let us know. But, yeah, it was great talking to everyone.
00:56:34.070 - 00:56:37.710, Speaker B: Hit us on Twitter. Thanks, guys, and thanks again.
