00:00:02.970 - 00:00:26.450, Speaker A: So, hi, everyone. Welcome to the second research hour series hosted by Uniswap Labs. Oh, no, it went away. I feel dumb. I'm Austin, a researcher at Uniswap Labs and the co host of today's conversation. With me here is Shin, my colleague at labs and the co host for the space. Uniswap Labs is the largest marketplace for onchain digital assets.
00:00:26.450 - 00:01:10.766, Speaker A: The tools we create are built on top on the Uniswap protocol, which is governed by an independent and decentralized community of Uni token holders and today is the largest decentralized trading protocol to date. The protocol has serviced over $1.5 trillion of transactions across multiple blockchains and has never been hacked, making uniswap one of the most trusted names in DFI. Uniswap Labs is focused on building technology that enables users to swap tokens, buy NFTs, provide liquidity, and self custody their assets with confidence. The opinions expressed during today's conversation will be ours personally and not that of labs. Our guest today is Gordon Liao. Gordon is the chief economist at Circle Internet Financial, which created the USDC stablecoin.
00:01:10.766 - 00:01:25.960, Speaker A: He's also an advisor to Uniswap Labs, as well as the former research lead. Gordon's research areas include stablecoins, amms, foreign exchange, among others. Gordon, welcome to the Uniswap, the second ever uniswap office hours.
00:01:26.410 - 00:01:45.840, Speaker B: Thank you so much. It's an honor to be here and great to hear that very long intro, including a disclaimer that the views expressed here are ours and ours only. It does not represent those of our respective institutions very much. That's what, typically researchers at the Federal Reserve put on their paper.
00:01:46.210 - 00:02:06.098, Speaker A: You have to, right? If not, it could potentially be that way. So, no, especially this is our things, our views. So I guess we have a first question. So, do you have any other things you want to add to your background? So I gave a pretty short spiel, but I wanted to let you talk about any other things that you think we may have missed.
00:02:06.274 - 00:02:44.698, Speaker B: No, not much to add. I started my career in traditional finance and did research at the Federal Reserve as well. And I really see this being almost, no pun intended, a full circle going from traditional finance to central banking to decentralized finance, perhaps a little bit backwards to more of the centralized space. But I see all of them being interrelated in many ways and quite important in the next chapter of financial innovation.
00:02:44.874 - 00:02:57.240, Speaker A: Yeah, perfect. So I guess a little bit on that. So you've sort of been in every single section of the tradfi defi space. So, what was the biggest difficulty for transitioning between tradfi and DeFi for you?
00:02:58.170 - 00:03:58.620, Speaker B: Well, I wouldn't say it's difficulty. There are certainly differences in language, differences in terminology, differences in culture, and it needs some translation. I think not many people are able to actually do this translation knowing the difference between, even, for instance, what liquidity provision means in deFi, versus what typical market making is like in traditional finance, the difference between principle based trading and agent based trading. These are concepts that share many similarities, but oftentimes they are approached from different angles. Some of the angles approached from DeFi oftentimes are grounded in engineering concepts, in computer science concepts. In traditional finance, it's very much about financial engineering, about the concepts that are previously known. And then I would say that the cultural differences are really interestingly observed in a very good way.
00:03:58.620 - 00:04:42.760, Speaker B: I think it is also a generation divide, that if you think about wifi, it's much older crowd, much older population demographics. Still, many people on the banking side are in Suzan Thai every day. And then DeFi is filled with this new energy of basically gen Zers, which I'm not a Gen Z myself, so actually got kind of taking me by surprise in a good way. I learned what the next generation cares about and what really is intriguing. And that's been really refreshing in many ways.
00:04:44.650 - 00:04:59.302, Speaker C: Okay, real question, incoming. At what size does a bank start to be systemically important? And in some ways, circle somewhat resembles a bank. So, does that threshold change when we are thinking about a stablecoin issuer?
00:04:59.446 - 00:05:47.610, Speaker B: Yeah. So, firstly, I would say that circle is quite different from a traditional bank. If you think about what banks do, banks are credit institutions. They fulfill this role of transforming liquidity, transforming credit. Circo is closer to be a payment institution than any conception of banking. It does fulfill an important role of facilitating payments, and having some role of facilitating store value. But the store of value is not meant to be transforming credit in the way that typically banks lend out their assets on a fractional reserve basis.
00:05:47.610 - 00:07:13.014, Speaker B: And it's also quite different in that the key is all about payments, facilitating payments as quickly as possible, even the store value part, which is important, but you can see it is more of competition with physical cash, given that it shoots a stable coin that is non interest rate bearing, rather than any form of security or deposits at this point. So I think it's new type of perhaps payment centric, if you want to call it bank, but it's really closer to a payment instrument that is resembling cash. To your question, about how big does a bank have to be to be systematically important? I think that's actually not really well defined internationally. The bank of International Settlement has the Basel committee previously set up a framework for evaluating what is deemed to be GSIPs for global, systematic important banks. And that's a number of different criteria. Size is one of which, but things like interconnectedness, things like operational complexity, also is a factor. In the US, there is a threshold which after a 2018 rule change, I believe it's around 200.
00:07:13.014 - 00:07:58.070, Speaker B: It is at $250,000,000,000 in assets. That's when banks become required to fulfill certain obligations, such as liquidity coverage ratio testing and some of the other key financial regulatory ratios that typically GSIPs have to fulfill. But that is not a single criteria in the long way of saying. But it's really interesting to point out the size of $250,000,000,000 because I believe when SVB fell, it was just below that threshold of needing to submit testings of liquidity coverage ratio.
00:07:59.610 - 00:08:11.210, Speaker C: So does that point to a trend of this threshold maybe shrinking a little bit implicitly, even though it's not stated on paper, or do you think it's adjusting?
00:08:12.670 - 00:09:12.750, Speaker B: Well, I think originally after Dot Frank was lower, but it did become higher. Some people call it a tailoring rule, but it's also related to just the size of the banking sector have grown so dramatically since the global financial crisis in 2008. So for the Gen Zers, you might not remember when 2008 happened, but that was a very meaningful event that changed all of banking landscape and pretty much produced today's financial environment with banks having much larger footprints and much more concentration as well, due to quite a bit of consolidation as well as liquidity injection that starts from the central bank. That also leaves commercial banks with larger balance sheets.
00:09:17.170 - 00:09:39.510, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. You think the systemically important threshold should vary across countries because a central bank sort of sizing is different in their ability to carry out policy changes. For example, like a finnish bank should be much lower than a US bank. So if you agree, how should we think about stablecoins for whether there not or really isn't a border?
00:09:40.250 - 00:10:44.762, Speaker B: Yeah, so I mean, there is a concept of globally systematic important banks, right? So in some sense, there needs to be a global standard. And there were many rules designed in the aftermath of 2008 that were trying to set an even playing field, a same standard for largely the same set of institutions. I think there are around 20 or so globally systematic important banks, although the size varies quite dramatically. And most recently we've seen quite a Swiss to fail, and that was a very slow death in some way, that its assets was shrinking slowly. It was a multi year process and it imploded. I think there does need to be a global standard to set the baseline of what is considered systematically important. Of course, there are some tailoring involved, that each country has to have its own rules to determine what is considered systematically important.
00:10:44.762 - 00:12:05.140, Speaker B: And by the way, the concept of CFI's systematic important financial institutions applies beyond just banking. Large insurance firms, large asset manager management firms are oftentimes deemed as systematically important as well. And what that means, oftentimes is the central bank has some authority in overseeing these organizations. And your question about whether there should be some sort of tailoring for stablecoin issuers? I think perhaps, given that there are many different currencies out in the world, and obviously the dollar is a dominant currency of global trade and finance, and dollar, stablecoin is the largest stablecoin by circulation as well. But for many countries, there are smaller stable coins that are packed to local currencies, some of which are very well backed. And perhaps for those countries, it's meaningful to have some sort of designation for the importance of those institutions as well.
00:12:07.690 - 00:13:27.658, Speaker C: Okay, I want to dig deeper into this distinction between payment companies, who takes deposits at circle versus a bank, right? And I think you wrote an article in Barron's recently. You argued that opening the payment rails to non bank financial institutions could lower the complexity of, you know, on the other hand, if you think about the comparison here, you take a financial institution, this financial institution taking some deposit issues, some liability, maybe in terms of its own stablecoin, or just in terms of like a banknote. And then in the ideal scenario, where stablecoin are widely accepted as payment and integrated into the economy, there is to some extent a risk where this deposit taking financial institution could pose to the system. So I guess in terms of the argument of separating out payment from the lending and borrowing business model, how should we think about it, and how do you reason about opening up payment rails to non bank financial institutions?
00:13:27.754 - 00:14:45.190, Speaker B: Absolutely. I think that's a great question and something I thought a lot about since the time I was at the Fed, where I think a lot of the Fed economists were influenced under one particular view of thought developed after, I would say, like probably after the diamond DiBIC models of the banking, you know, as a concept, has had a very long history. And the concept of having payment specific banks, or sometimes narrower frameworks for banking, has been in discussion for almost a century, actually, beyond a century. If we think about banking, there is a credit facilitation aspect of banking. But I think in the last couple of decades, this aspect of banking has completely been transformed by innovations in technology, but also innovations in financial structure. Today, I believe the stats is only 30% of credit is provided by banks. Whereas previously, in the older days, a couple of decades ago, in days of it's a wonderful Life, which is a movie that captured that air of relationship heavy type of banking.
00:14:45.190 - 00:16:03.860, Speaker B: Banks provided the bulk, the vast majority of credit. I think it was 80% or something back in the day. But today, banks no longer fulfill that role of credit provision as they used to. Other than smaller community banks, a lot of the banks are originating loans and then syndicating them, and they would sell off the loans into private credit markets or syndicated loan markets. So they still serve a very important function. But arguably, the amount of assets no longer needs to be these type of eliquid loans that just sits on a portfolio. So then that natural question to ask, well, if banks are just holding quite a bit of marketable securities in many ways, or loans as securities, do you necessarily need to tie up the payment aspect with the lending aspect? And what has also taught us in recent times is the rise of technology in terms of mobile banking, in terms of social network, in terms of the flow of information, and how quickly it could spread in a network, makes liabilities of any sort much more runnable than before.
00:16:03.860 - 00:17:32.314, Speaker B: And this is exactly what we observed with SAB's collapse, but also with some of the other banks that got taken over, including more recently with First Republic, that once there's a trigger, there's a belief that others could run on the bank. Whether there is value or not, everyone is motivated to access their mobile app and to pull money out of a particular bank. And that sort of dynamic was always there, as always part of typical bank run. But with the spread of information and how fast it could occur, with the easy availability of mobile banking experience, that makes that type of risk much more heightened. So in this environment, where you have banks fulfilling less of a credit intermediation role as they had previously, as well as much more runnable deposit base because of advent of information technology. So I think it really makes sense to rethink how much of payment activities should be tied in with banking activities. In fact, some of the recent research coming out of the Federal Reserve from colleagues of mine previously actually wrote about the risk of payment flows to banking and to bank lending.
00:17:32.314 - 00:17:40.734, Speaker B: Specifically, I'm thinking of a specific paper by Lee and co author where this.
00:17:40.772 - 00:17:43.362, Speaker D: Is really, if you look at even.
00:17:43.416 - 00:19:18.030, Speaker B: Just the Fedwire statistics and data, the more that banks have payment churn activities in how much they had to pay out from their account to other banks, perhaps to fulfill payroll, perhaps to fulfill invoicing, the more risk that creates to their lending book, that means they can't hold as much of illiquid loans in the environment. We actually have seen just much higher growth and velocity of payment on the payment rails. So, for instance, the Fedwire payment rail has increased its payment value by 50% in the last three years from, I believe the stats was from 2019 to 2022. It introduces a lot more risk to naturally, the lending and credit transformation. And I think there could be a completely redesign of banking system in which you could remove some of that risk and put it separately aside into payment specific institutions. Whether you want to call it payment specific banks or stablecoin company, it doesn't really matter. That kind of facilitates payment activities while you have the lending activities being borne by those depositors that are aware that they are taking on risk, that are providing the liquidity for transforming assets and transforming credit and maturity.
00:19:18.030 - 00:21:16.390, Speaker B: And I think this actually ties in very well with DeFi. Why is that so? Because if you think about it, if you move away into a world in which you have a separation of payment activities, which could potentially be fulfilled by payment stablecoin from the risk taking activities, a lot of these type of risk taking activities end up being much more granular in that there are risk taking activities for facilitating illiquid loans, for instance, or illiquid perhaps under a regulated world, illiquid securities. And that sort of liquidity provision is best done with programmability, with open source innovations that allow more participation into a network, rather than more siloed systems in which only a few players get to deploy risk capital towards it. So currently, you have already, naturally, the development of syndicate alone market. For instance, it's a large market for banks and non banks to participate in, to lend out money. But that's only reserved for a small network of institutions, not just because of regulation and requirements, but also because simply it's really hard to facilitate the sharing of liquidity risk, sharing of credit risk through a larger network, because currently all the trading are down rather manually. So having more automated ways through DEFI to allow transformation of risk and provision of liquidity into perhaps a broader capital market has to be developed simultaneously with this separation of payment activities and lending activities.
00:21:16.390 - 00:21:30.380, Speaker B: This is why I believe companies like Circle and Uniswap Labs are core to innovations in finance, because you have this simultaneous trend happening.
00:21:32.590 - 00:22:06.134, Speaker A: That makes sense, I guess, speaking on liquidity risk and credit risk and runs, I guess the big topic in stablecoins last year was under collateralized algorithmic stablecoins, like Luna, not Luna, USDT, UST, that reached their sort of end with a big run and a large loss of capital. Do you think that we should completely give up on undercloudalized algorithmic stablecoins, or do you still think that there's a possibility that they may come back and figure it out?
00:22:06.332 - 00:22:39.870, Speaker B: That's a great question, I think. Algo stablecoins. So this is the distinction between Trifi and defi defi people who might be engineers by training or by background thought. This is a great idea. From a Trifi perspective. It's always kind of clear that this is not so different. Algo stablecoins were not so different than the experiments that many emerging market central banks played in terms of having fractional reserve with foreign reserve, and creating pegged currencies.
00:22:39.870 - 00:24:02.746, Speaker B: So one of the trilemmas, or the trilemma of international finance or international macro, is that you can't have all three things. You can have a pegged currency, and also have a free floating open flow of money between your cross border, at the same time having independent monetary policy. Many countries have tried this in the past of pegging their currency to the dollar, having free flow of exchange with the dollar, and trying to set their own independent monetary policy. And that simply just has not worked over and over again in the experiences of the peso crisis, in the experience of many of the other crisis. Unless, of course, you have a constant inflow of revenue source that actually makes the PEC kind of destabilized from the other direction. But that's a longer discussion. But the simple fact is, Luna and Terra represented a form of their own central banking, but with very limited inflow of cash.
00:24:02.746 - 00:25:18.130, Speaker B: That is by design. I think the original conception is, if you can generate enough payment activities, and you can charge fees on those payment activities that serve as part of the equity revenue stream, then you could have enough of equity value that's backing Luna. Therefore, it would also back Terra. But that was simply a bit of idealistic in some sense, because what we've seen is, of course, it wasn't adopted for payments nearly as much. It was mostly adopted for the usage in this anchor protocol, which set its own independent monetary policy. Paying out, I forgot, what, like 20% interest rate or something, and allowing free conversion, and allowing a peg, which just by fundamental design, doesn't just violates this tested time and time tested property of international finance. So could algorithmic stablecoin work in some particular way that's designed by perhaps.
00:25:21.030 - 00:25:21.394, Speaker A: With.
00:25:21.432 - 00:25:31.720, Speaker B: More well backed collaterals? Possibly, but it's certainly not going to be equity backed collaterals, which was essentially what Terra was.
00:25:33.450 - 00:25:42.874, Speaker C: Could you summarize the top two policy changes that Circo is advocating for as nicely as chat? GPT would have done it.
00:25:43.072 - 00:27:14.790, Speaker B: I don't know if I could articulate things as nicely as chat these days, but I think the two large policy changes that circle, and probably I would say the rest of the industry would like to see is, at least in the US, is two particular bills. One is related to payment stablecoin, that is having a federal regulation framework around payment stablecoins that would allow it to be fully backed and be regulated. So it could also gain broader adoption, at the same time having also a market infrastructure bill that allows more adoption of DeFi protocols, but also with proper safeguards, with the necessary rules and requirements around regulating DeFi protocols. So those are just broadly two piece of regulatory legislation that's going through being discussed right now. Whether we'll get any result from these discussions is yet to be seen, but I think there's a broad recognition that this is very much needed. And the US is far behind other countries in these discussions. As we've seen in Europe, there's already a Meca markets in crypto asset bill that's passed that address both of these topics.
00:27:14.790 - 00:27:38.590, Speaker B: In Asia, there are also many legislative efforts. So I definitely think that we hope there will be both these two bills that are passed in some form that could be supportive for the industry, but also maintain a fair amount of regulatory oversight.
00:27:40.930 - 00:27:51.300, Speaker A: Makes sense. I think it's sort of a thing that's on the top of everyone's mind is regulation in the coming sort of years. So it's important to hear. It's interesting to hear sort of your perspective on that.
00:27:54.070 - 00:28:31.840, Speaker B: Yeah. Just add that some people fear that regulation is kind of bad for the industry. I actually think it's quite the opposite. What we seen is without regulation, it will always be on the fringes. And right now the risk to the industry is actually one in which there's no access whatsoever to the fiat world. That is, having banking access cut off. And I think having the proper level of regulation and consumer protection would allow the industry to flourish and grow.
00:28:34.230 - 00:28:48.166, Speaker A: That makes sense, I guess, on that topic, you recently wrote a paper about blockchain based foreign exchange using Amms and stablecoin. How has the reception been for that paper? And what can you tell us about sort of people's thoughts on it?
00:28:48.348 - 00:28:58.138, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for asking. That's the paper with you and seeing along with MC and David Puth. The reception has been great.
00:28:58.224 - 00:28:58.860, Speaker D: Right?
00:29:00.430 - 00:29:21.550, Speaker B: We have had a number of presentations at central banks and a few other upcoming presentations. I think broadly, the topic of using distributed ledger or blockchain for settling cross border payments is just well understood.
00:29:24.070 - 00:29:28.530, Speaker D: That is probably like the killer app.
00:29:28.600 - 00:30:54.240, Speaker B: Of crypto that more broad based population could understand. It's very clear how broken the foreign exchange rate market and cross border payments are. And it's very clear that something like public blockchain or distributed ledger is a clear solution to issues that face this really large market that's quite critical to the lives of so many people. Whether it is sending remittance or making payments, making payrolls cross border or whether it is trading, the foreign exchange rate is an enormous market by volume. It's processing about $7 trillion a day by value. And that's still somewhat archaic in terms of having real time settlement and not having real time settlement, which is about not having these sort of settlement of one leg of the trade against the other leg of the trade, sometimes known as payment versus payment protection. It's probably around half of the trade volume, and that is problematic because it introduces settlement risk into the financial system.
00:30:54.240 - 00:31:36.140, Speaker B: But it's also problematic in that those who use existing solutions have to put up liquidity against the claim against the netting of settlement. And that is also inefficient, which is probably why the netting solution hasn't been fully adopted. It's only adopted partially. I do see the greatest opportunity are not at the institutional level necessarily, but more for everyday consumers, for everyday users, especially for those who are.
00:31:38.590 - 00:31:39.066, Speaker D: At the.
00:31:39.088 - 00:32:25.370, Speaker B: Bottom of the pyramid, who might be sending money across border for remittance for their family, and who currently had to face very hefty charges. On average, I think the World bank estimated to be about 6% of cross border transaction value in remittance goes towards fees. So being able to solve that problem alone, it's a real value add to a lot of households in the world that depends critically on the necessary remittance to meet their livelihood. So it's an issue that I'm also very passionate about from the real world impact perspective as well as from the trading perspective.
00:32:30.050 - 00:33:10.346, Speaker C: So last time I checked, I think binance still the most popular exchange in Asia, and Tron is still the most popular or most commonly used payment rail in crypto. As you said, this is meant to serve maybe the unbanked billions in developing countries. What has CZ or Justin, his Excellency, downright? What can we do to increase adoption of USDC, or maybe Eurasi and other stablecoins? How can uniswap start to serve the billions of unbanked in developing countries, do you think?
00:33:10.528 - 00:33:12.794, Speaker B: Yeah, I think what they have done.
00:33:12.832 - 00:33:23.770, Speaker D: Right is probably early mover advantage by far, right. Just by having the early presence really.
00:33:23.840 - 00:34:42.162, Speaker B: Help to drive the entrenchment in their adoption usage in many parts of the world in emerging markets. I do think the whole reason why this whole system was developed with how bitcoin arrives in the middle of October. I think the bitcoin white paper was written in October 2008. The whole ecosystem was developed around the concept of being a bit more decentralized, not relying on centralized entities. What we have observed, in fact, was developments that were quite contrary to the underlying ethos of decentralization. In fact, you had immense concentration of risk within a few institutions. Many of these platforms have collapsed in the last two years, and you had an immense concentration of also power that I don't think is the healthiest.
00:34:42.162 - 00:34:43.974, Speaker B: Both for the ecosystem to continue to.
00:34:44.012 - 00:34:46.360, Speaker D: Develop as well as.
00:34:49.290 - 00:35:43.610, Speaker B: Just for even adoption standpoint. For any industry to grow in a healthy competitive manner, you had to have more competition and more, less concentration of risk and of market share. So, yes, I do think currently our ecosystem is quite concentrated, and hopefully those who are at the center of it also recognize the need for the broader defi ecosystem to continue to develop, because that is where the real innovation is. It's not just a centralized platform that does everything which somewhat resembles what we have already in traditional finance.
00:35:46.110 - 00:36:13.490, Speaker A: So I guess as part of that, people have been sort of talking about crypto as banking the unbanked and bringing payments to the unbanked for many years, essentially since 2015. What do you think is sort of the difference this time, and what do you think has been sort of the innovations that have happened that have allowed it to sort of grow into something that is actually usable now? And what do you think needs to continue to grow to sort of be the one place to do payments?
00:36:14.310 - 00:36:32.442, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a couple of things. One is having more regulatory clarity this time around, and I think we definitely have a lot more regulatory clarity in many countries now than even a couple of years ago. And continuing on, this trend of having.
00:36:32.496 - 00:36:36.742, Speaker D: More clarity that supports adoption and broader.
00:36:36.806 - 00:36:39.526, Speaker B: Usage in a safe and sound manner.
00:36:39.638 - 00:36:48.778, Speaker D: Is very important to further the use of digital assets more broadly.
00:36:48.954 - 00:36:57.038, Speaker B: I also think that we had a couple of cycles in which it was really centered.
00:36:57.214 - 00:36:59.822, Speaker D: All the activities were centered around speculative.
00:36:59.886 - 00:37:03.650, Speaker B: Activities, which created these boom and bus.
00:37:03.720 - 00:38:03.430, Speaker D: Cycles, which were somewhat unhealthy, because during times of booms you have everyone being so excited about either ICOs or airdrops or whatever incentives, and then quickly that fades and that leads to a lack of interest and activity, especially if some of the users who are more just getting started were burned through the process. I think this time around, having more focus on real world utility and activities that could transform lives should be the focus. And hopefully that would mean adoption would be much more sustainable than a purely speculative form that has been characteristics of previous cycles.
00:38:05.690 - 00:39:01.578, Speaker C: Speaking of utility and using crypto as payment, I think a lot of debate has been going around whether the advantage of crypto payments stems purely from kind of the regulatory arbitrage aspect of it. If you look at south asian countries nowadays, if you have wechat on your phone, you can basically seamlessly get cross border payment already. Right? And that's because they solved a lot of the infrastructure issues that I guess crypto is maybe equally well positioned to solve. But maybe that's the way to go. Do you think that the advantage of crypto of doing cross border payment is really regulatory arbitrage or not? And is it the way to go about solving this problem?
00:39:01.744 - 00:39:05.114, Speaker B: Yeah. First, I think crypto has.
00:39:05.232 - 00:39:10.634, Speaker D: Sometimes the term is used very broadly.
00:39:10.682 - 00:39:12.750, Speaker B: But crypto just means cryptography.
00:39:14.130 - 00:40:21.550, Speaker D: There are many technologies that are built on cryptography. There are technologies that's built on cryptography, that has nothing to do with digital assets. I think the ones that you are mentioning, the ones that are these super apps in Asia, they definitely have emerged as a solution to many of the payment issues that those countries and those citizens of those countries face. But they also come with certain downside in that they are very concentrated. There's two large payment apps, Alipay and Wachapay, that's responsible for the vast majority of day to day transaction in some countries. And that is problematic because you have such concentration of activities being centered around two essential oligopoly.
00:40:22.130 - 00:40:24.126, Speaker B: And that's why the government kind of.
00:40:24.148 - 00:41:23.030, Speaker D: Stepped in to lower the concentration a bit by having certain requirements. And one of the most innovative requirements around that was actually something I think the US should consider, which is making those companies to fully back their reserve asset with the central bank. So today, a UN that is held in a WeChat wallet or Alipay Wallet is actually a UN that's backed one to one with the central bank reserve currency that's something that central bank started to recognize is actually needed to ensure the safety and stability of their financial system, which is something that is worth emulating from other countries that are also considering proper regulations.
00:41:24.810 - 00:41:28.166, Speaker B: Whether that itself fulfills.
00:41:28.198 - 00:42:44.370, Speaker D: All the payment needs. I think you're inherently limited by the level of programmability those two platforms could provide. You're also inherently limited by the fact that these two organizations could essentially decide whether to include your app or not, or whether to exclude it, or whether to formulate their own version of the same innovation. And we've seen this in the US as well, with many of the web, two companies with some of the App Stores that make decisions on which app could be launched or cannot be launched. Those are all symptoms, and those are all examples of concentration in which it sometimes could deter innovation. I do fear that that sort of system in which everything is built around a couple of key platforms, you end up with a lot more platform risk, a lot more concentration risk, and deterrence to longer term innovations.
00:42:46.550 - 00:43:03.030, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess as part of that, the stablecoin space is sort of semi concentrated as well. Do you sort of think that USDC is the only stablecoin model, or stablecoin the space needs, or do you think that there are other sort of models that you think have merit to be in the industry?
00:43:04.010 - 00:44:22.590, Speaker D: I think circle welcomes innovation and competition. The whole reason of having, perhaps having federal regulation is that it would allow competition, but on the same level playing field, that is, there needs to be a bare minimum requirement for the asset backing to be safe, for the full reserve backing, for the protection of consumers, for the protection of users, and beyond, which is open for competition of the different type of features that stablecoins could introduce. For instance, Circle has built around USDC, but now has also built out a cross chain protocol layer. Those type of innovations requires competition and requires standard setting as well. So I don't think USDC will be the only stable coin in town at all. In fact, I think it is about encouraging competition, but at the same time requiring the same standard and interoperability between tokens.
00:44:24.310 - 00:44:35.330, Speaker C: Stablecoins, like USDC, is a type of real world asset. What other type of real world asset do you think we should have on chain?
00:44:35.690 - 00:45:55.680, Speaker D: Yeah, this is kind of related to the last question, right? Like for instance, one type of relatively stable store of value could be really short term debt instruments of sorts that provides some level of stability, but also has ability to bear some interest, that delivers some interest back to the holders, but that requires innovation in security rules. I think there are also currently in existence some type of similar to stablecoin type of instruments out there that's tokenized treasury or tokenized treasury funds. But of course it has different type of requirements as well, being a security being having qualified purchaser status or at least qualified investment investor status. So there needs to be a simultaneous evolution in terms of technology as well as with the confines of law and rule to make disclosure easier. So then what is clearly a security can be a security, but with the right.
00:46:00.050 - 00:46:11.220, Speaker A: So as we're starting trying to wrap up, we're sort of looking forward to the next few years. What sort of products and innovations do you think you're most excited for in the DFI space?
00:46:12.630 - 00:47:29.690, Speaker D: There's just so many, I think at a fundamental layer, innovations that continues on layer one and L2, whether it's related to security or privacy. That is a huge area that I'm very excited about. And then innovation on the application side, I think we are just beginning to crack open the surface area of the real world usage of this technology. Products that touches everyday life, whether it is FX or whether it is collateralized lending that's being used for treasury trading. These are real problems that needs to be solved, and there are real demand for it if you could have a solution, for instance, for solving treasury intermediation issues. So I think we're just beginning to touch on the real world asset side. And I do think that is a large area of growth because we know the demand exists, the demand for solutions, for solutions, both from a technical sense, but also from a legal, regulatory sense, it's immense.
00:47:29.690 - 00:47:48.450, Speaker D: And then everything that happens with web3, that we'll see what happens. I'm optimistic, but it's less proven demand. I think we could build everything around it. We had to see how the consumer behavior shifts.
00:47:49.510 - 00:47:53.954, Speaker A: That makes sense. So I guess we have sort of been asking you questions. Do you sort of have anything else.
00:47:53.992 - 00:47:55.158, Speaker D: That you want to talk about that.
00:47:55.164 - 00:47:56.680, Speaker A: We haven't touched on?
00:47:58.890 - 00:49:01.020, Speaker D: I don't in particular have anything else to add. I would say that for those who are doing research in the area, having fundamental understanding of financial system, having fundamental understanding of what has been built before and what it teaches us about present is very important. There are so many examples of DeFi protocols out there that is in some ways emulating what has been done before, but perhaps for the wrong reason, perhaps not knowing. While some of the solutions that have been tried in Triedfi are a path to nowhere or a path to something that's even better. So I would encourage anyone doing research in this space to first delve in deeply on the traditional finance side.
00:49:02.510 - 00:49:21.066, Speaker A: Yeah, you front run our last question. Our last question was advice for researchers in the space. So I think we'll just sort of skip that one. Yeah, I think that was sort of a great research hour. So, Gordon, thank you very much for coming on. We want to shout you out. Go follow Gordon on Twitter.
00:49:21.066 - 00:49:52.822, Speaker A: He will post wonderful things about Tradfi and Defi, and you can read all of his papers on those same topics as well. And, yeah, I think that's all from us. I think we'll be back in about two weeks with another guest. If you have any suggestions, feel free to DM Shannon and I are on Twitter or send us an email or anything like that. We're happy to get into it. And that has been all for us at the Uniswap research hours. So thank you, everyone, for coming, and we appreciate your time.
00:49:52.822 - 00:49:54.840, Speaker A: And we also appreciate Gordon's time.
00:49:55.210 - 00:49:56.082, Speaker D: Thank you, Shane.
00:49:56.146 - 00:49:57.010, Speaker B: Thank you, Austin.
00:49:57.090 - 00:49:59.558, Speaker D: It's a pleasure to join you guys again.
00:49:59.644 - 00:50:00.638, Speaker A: Of course, course, of course.
00:50:00.724 - 00:50:01.438, Speaker C: Thanks, everyone.
00:50:01.524 - 00:50:02.060, Speaker A: All right, go.
