00:00:00.330 - 00:00:35.640, Speaker A: Minutes ago, this person who is doing, like, axiom hooks, I was like, that is a cool sort of idea. Like, reads, like, the state of how old their account is, and then if you're not old enough, you can't swap. And I was like, that's pretty cool. It's interesting to sort of see the coprocessor used that way. We talked to Yi a little bit about it, but it wasn't, like, most interesting thing in the world. But I think it's mostly just because we wanted to work on core stuff instead.
00:00:37.290 - 00:00:55.360, Speaker B: No, I think hook ideas are coming from all different places right now. Right. And it's pretty exciting. We're really excited over here and super happy to be here because it's a ripe time to hear what everybody's new idea, what you could do with the hook is exactly.
00:00:55.890 - 00:01:08.740, Speaker A: I won't let you show too much, because we will obviously one of the big topics, and I want to make sure we don't front run our own questions too much. But yeah, you can probably start in, like, 30 seconds. Usually people trickle in.
00:01:09.430 - 00:01:12.930, Speaker B: Yeah, no worries. But I think I saw your tweet.
00:01:17.930 - 00:01:30.046, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it was a pretty cool hook. I'm excited. I like people sort of just, like, cooking on crazy hook ideas. I'm like, these aren't the most interesting. They're not going to go on Prod.
00:01:30.098 - 00:01:30.362, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:30.416 - 00:02:08.262, Speaker A: But it's cool to see people noodling. On the space, I saw someone who only lets you trade during nicey open, and I was like, this is pretty cool. Okay, I'll do the fun, crazy thing we have to say. All right, I'm starting now, so hi, everyone. Welcome to the fifth DeFi research hour series hosted by Uniswap labs. I'm Austin, a researcher at Uniswap Labs and a co host of today's conversation. With me here is Shin, my colleague at Labs and co host for the space.
00:02:08.262 - 00:02:54.446, Speaker A: Uniswap Labs is the largest marketplace for uniswap Protocol is the largest marketplace for on chain digital assets. The tools we create are built on the Uniswap Protocol, governed by an independent and decentralized community of Uni token holders. And today is the largest decentralized trading protocol to date. The protocol has serviced $1.5 trillion of transactions across multiple blockchains that has never been hacked, making Uniswap one of the most trusted names in DeFi. Uniswap Labs is focused on building technology that enables users to swap tokens, buy NFTs, provide liquidity, and self custody their assets with confidence. The opinions expressed during today's conversation will be ours personally and not that of Labs.
00:02:54.446 - 00:03:12.220, Speaker A: Our guest today is Arrakis Finance. Arrakis is one of the largest integrators of Uniswap Protocol, currently hosting around $200 million in total value lock. Aracus Finance is also a portfolio company of Uniswap Labs Ventures. Aracus, specifically cassandra, thank you for joining us.
00:03:13.390 - 00:03:15.740, Speaker B: Thanks for having me pumped to be here.
00:03:16.190 - 00:03:56.374, Speaker A: We're excited, too, when we sort of were cooking on people to ask for the space, I think those are pretty high up on our list. We're like, we need the folks who are on the ground floor. I think there's no one better who's on the ground floor currently than Iraq is thinking about building and managing liquidity on Uniswap V Three. So I think this sort of goes into our first question. Their team, and you specifically, were one of the early people who got a look at Uniswap V Four. And I think specifically when it was sent to you, there was no documentation, no white paper, no nothing. It was just a GitHub link of code sent to you.
00:03:56.374 - 00:04:02.620, Speaker A: So what was your first impressions of the code, especially in the state that it was in three, four months ago?
00:04:03.310 - 00:05:18.660, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a very interesting question. I think certainly it's amazing. It's so cool to see. I have to say that you learn so much more when it's public to absolutely everyone, right? So I feel like I understand it so much more richly today, now that the whole world is talking about hooks. But I think immediately, especially for we've been building tooling and infrastructure on top of Uniswap V Three since pretty much a white paper and on paper and pen and not yet deployed to production. And so I think immediately this hook concept did pop out to us as extremely meaningful and kind of like for the liquidity provider, right? It allows you to do at the basic level, it allows you to not have to build all this extra infrastructure and keeper infrastructure and things just to reposition liquidity at a certain moment, given a certain on chain trigger. And so this was really the first huge, massive noticing that it just clicked right away.
00:05:18.660 - 00:06:30.954, Speaker B: I think the thing you notice at the very beginning, or like the lowest hanging fruit, is something like limit orders, something we've thought of for a long time, or range orders. And again, we've been hacking on these just so much more complexity when you add all this peripheral stuff. And so the idea that you can, after a swap is executed, actually immediately reposition liquidity or redistribute it or pull it out of Uniswap. All of these things were like for me, that was the key insight right away. The code is definitely right, as usual, uniswap code, you have to get to know it. And I think, for me, one thing that was very opaque until actually some of the more developers on my team, who are also incredible and we're looking more fine grained into it, they really had to explain to me, right, what was really going on with some of this flash accounting and things like this. So there's some very interesting innovation there which I think doesn't get talked about as much.
00:06:30.954 - 00:06:59.890, Speaker B: It's also a bit more interesting, ERC Five, and the way that the accounting works and the settlement at the end of being able to do a number of different things. So all of that was, I can just say very complex to metabolize. But once I sort of saw it and it clicked, it felt as well, very useful and interesting and driving all kinds of efficiency.
00:07:01.430 - 00:07:40.480, Speaker A: That makes sense. I think. When I first was reading it, I was like, what is happening here? And it was very helpful to have Noah and things like Sarah and Mark to help me, but obviously that's not something that most people get. So I was very grateful to have some amazing developers, I guess, on those lines. We didn't sort of give you a little bit of chance to talk about what Aracus is. We sort of alluded to it, maybe, but I think people would be pretty helpful to get a little bit of context on what you guys do, just because I think it will help motivate why we had you on this call. Obviously.
00:07:41.330 - 00:08:57.240, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah. So I think at its core, Arrakis is really about building on chain infrastructure that allows liquidity providers or just participants on chain participants in DeFi to access liquidity provision in a way that maintains sort of the kind of ethos that you had in an earlier phase of decentralized exchanges like Uniswap V Two. The feeling that you could passively simply supply your assets to participate in the market to be liquidity provider, but at the same time leverage all of the power of the much more interesting and much more advanced features of something like concentrated liquidity. And now, of course, what you're seeing with Univ Four and hooks and so on. For us, I think we're entirely focused on the liquidity provider and how to improve the UX, improve the composability and sort of be on the cutting edge of the most advanced things and most optimized things as a liquidity provider that you can do but expose those to the wider DFI community.
00:08:58.090 - 00:09:15.760, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's sort of a big thing that people talked about was difficulties with V Three. It's very different than V Two, which provide your assets and sort of call it a day, but in V Three, the choice of ticks is definitely more difficult. I'll let pass to Shannon and he can sort of get on to the next question.
00:09:17.250 - 00:09:37.140, Speaker C: Yeah. Are there any improvement or feature requests that you would like to see on the hook or the hook kind of implementation or the interface that you would like to see from Uniswap's end?
00:09:38.890 - 00:10:35.240, Speaker B: That's a big question. I still have to say the design space with the hooks is so massive, it's hard to mention an improvement when already your head sort of explodes with the amount of possible things you could achieve with these hooks. Potentially even there can be I mean, I think this is what these kinds of things are all about, but I think there will need to continually be a ton of education there about trying to basically the design space is so wide, kind of helping people go towards the parts that are actually really meaty and interesting. I think one thing, I don't know if it's an improvement or but it's definitely a question mark that I have. And I'm not alone. I don't think this is major news, but it's about actually on the trader side, right? Like, how is routing going to work? Is this extremely interesting question that I've been mulling over it's in my dreams. Right.
00:10:35.240 - 00:11:23.880, Speaker B: Because of all the possibilities of what can happen inside of a hook that allows you to realize what your trade execution will actually be when the trade routes through that hook and the fact that there can be infinitely many. Right. In Uniswap V three, there were just a couple of pools with the different fee tiers. In Univ two and V one, there was simply one per asset pair. But now you could have infinitely many hooks per asset pair, and each of them could be doing very interesting internal logic. And so the only way to understand what your execution would really be is to simulate these transactions. And this just seems like just a wildly complex problem that I'm very interested in understanding how Uni wants to attack it, or also if they want to expose that problem to sort of the outside community.
00:11:24.650 - 00:11:51.054, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we sort of exposed it to the outside community already, right. Through aggregators and things like that. But I think that we have simulation logic already and we have some very good backend engineers. So I think we're very excited for this problem. We have talked about it on Twitter a lot. We sort of agree it's a very large problem. But all fun problems are hard problems, right.
00:11:51.054 - 00:12:12.120, Speaker A: So it'll be a fun problem to solve, but a hard one. So on the same line, we sort of talked about hooks and maybe some improvements. What are some of the hook designs, maybe, that you've seen, that you like to see or that you're excited about? Maybe like, hooks you're personally excited about, and then obviously hooks that Arrakis is excited about?
00:12:13.290 - 00:12:16.680, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's hard to separate personal and.
00:12:18.570 - 00:12:27.226, Speaker A: Maybe yeah, I want to do, like, business versus pleasure. I was like, what's? Just cool, interesting, versus what's you're going to maybe build them?
00:12:27.408 - 00:12:35.374, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, then I think I can see the two differences there. Maybe what should I start with, the.
00:12:35.412 - 00:12:41.680, Speaker A: Fun, the personal, or let's do the rakus ones first. I think those will be more fun. Or those will be interesting.
00:12:42.130 - 00:12:58.930, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. So exactly. The meat and potatoes, I think. I don't know if you guys have seen this ETH research post that came out. I believe it's like the Mcaml. It's about the lever minimizing uniswap v four hook.
00:12:58.930 - 00:13:37.570, Speaker B: So you guys have probably seen this. I think it's even been talked about. I believe when you went around with the Uniswap team, I was watching the stream then, and maybe it was Noah who mentioned that it was excited about a hook that might auction off at the top of the block. The mev that always exists around stabilizing the price to match the price of the outside world. And because of the latency you have just inherent to at least layer one right. It's like a twelve second latency. There's kind of no way that there's not going to maybe be some sort of arbitrage opportunity at the top of a block.
00:13:37.570 - 00:14:40.774, Speaker B: So I feel like this post that E Three research post was really massive, I felt like. And I immediately was drawn to it's. Again, highly complex, but the more that you go into it, you see that it has some really amazing features, kind of starts to show a path more concretely for how DEXes can truly rival or at least compete with centralized exchanges in just like a paradigm shifting way. And so yeah, what I think is the coolest part maybe about that post well, I think there's a lot right? There's a ton in there and we don't have to go too deep just yet, maybe. But I think maybe the two things that are highly interesting is one, building on the shoulders of giants. I think there's something called the Diamond Protocol that it was referencing. I truly don't even know exactly where that came from, but it feels like a longtime research has already been going on here.
00:14:40.774 - 00:15:52.494, Speaker B: But so, yeah, the first part about being able to provide a way for the searcher or the person trying to extract the mev from the fact that the prices on chain or the price inside your liquidity pool inside. Your hook don't match the real world price that they can be both incentivized but also in such a way where they hurt the LPs less. So like every time this happens, if they're extracting value by doing these arbitrages, where is this value coming from? Well, it's all zero sum somehow. So it's got to be coming from somewhere. It's coming from the LPs, right? So the LPs are getting hurt by this. And so it was sort of mind bending for me at first to understand this idea that you could make the arbitrage opportunity more attractive for the searcher for the arbor and yet also improve, make things better for the liquidity provider, that it hurts them less. And this seemed at first kind of like an impossibility and then the more that you wrestle with it, you see that that's very interesting.
00:15:52.494 - 00:17:26.214, Speaker B: So I thought that was huge. And then the second part that I found very cool is this idea that then you can maintain that price throughout the whole block. And this seemed like a new feature, I think maybe this thing called the Diamond Protocol that research had already been done, but this extra piece, this idea that then you could actually facilitate all the trades that might be running through your hook and give them exactly that price, the price that the arbor moved the market to. These two things were highly fascinating to me. And I guess maybe just to mention why is that so cool, right? It's basically like almost a guarantee that your on chain traders, if this thing works as described and gets a ton of scale, right, an on chain trader can now get something close to a guarantee that they will just get the real world price, right, the price that everybody believes is the price that you should get. And so that's like a paradigm shift from where we are today, right, wherein every trader has to be super concerned about am I getting the wrong price just because the pools are not being arbed or something or just don't reflect the real world? And then secondly, even if they do right now, am I going to get value extracted from me because of the slippage that I placed? So even though I could have gotten that price and the pool was at the right price, I didn't get the right price anyway. And right, all of a sudden, complete paradigm shift.
00:17:26.214 - 00:17:47.860, Speaker B: Every trader always gets the exact price that's on whatever binance, let's say if your market is ETH USDC and Binance leads the price exploration there. So, yeah, I thought that this was the meat and potatoes. And the thing that I think Arrakis is really excited about building definitely could start from something like this post.
00:17:48.310 - 00:18:07.110, Speaker A: Yeah, connor's. A shout to Connor. I don't know, maybe if he's watching, shout out to him. He wrote a paper about it's, a good paper. We sort of agree. I think it's an interesting post. It'll be interesting to see sort of all the different ways that it comes out to Mitigate lever.
00:18:07.110 - 00:18:28.960, Speaker A: We're very excited about it. People like to argue about it on Twitter and I'm like keep arguing so we can get more good. Um, I guess the other one is I don't know what's just like a cool thing we're chatting a little bit earlier about just like cool random things, unexpected maybe.
00:18:29.490 - 00:19:20.238, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's definitely a bunch of cool things, I think where my mind often goes in terms of fun hooks or things that I think sound interesting always has to do with integration with other protocols. Right? So, like this massive new thing that you can do is that you could provide liquidity to uniswap. But the liquidity doesn't always have to sit in uniswap, right? It can arrive in uniswap in a pre modified position hook, right. Before modify or sorry, before swap hook. Let's say, right, that just before the swapper's swap arrives, then the liquidity can arrive and sit in uniswap. And right after that swap, it could go elsewhere again. And so I think in this domain, which has nothing to do with what we just talked about, right, there are some really fun ideas, I think.
00:19:20.238 - 00:21:23.906, Speaker B: For instance, one thing we talk about is how it sort of problematizes or makes interesting a lot of the kind of liquidity mining schemes you see in the world. So imagine wanting to getting the best of both worlds in that maybe on a Dex like curve, there's often all kinds of liquidity mining rewards that are there and maybe not a ton of volumes, but a lot of reasons for LPs to put liquidity sitting there because of these outside incentives. So what if you could both lap up those incentives and also lap up all the volume on Uniswap? To me this is like, again, something that sounds quite interesting and then from there my mind even goes somewhere that might even be somewhat contentious for Uniswap. But one of the things I posted this on Twitter at first, and it's not that I want to see this, but I just wonder about this domain space is like, do hooks make vampire attacks to Uniswap easier somehow? Right? In that other new, DEXs can basically say, hey, we don't have the kind of network effects that Uniswap has, but we have something new. What if we give you the best of both worlds and your liquidity will sit in our decks but you'll still catch the flow from Uniswap, since maybe that's where a lot of the trading is happening now and which has some of these network effects and people trade through the Uniswap, UI and so on. So you want to be able to be there for that flow at first especially, but still allow these other DEXes, these competitors, to actually build up liquidity without forcing those liquidity providers to give up the optionality of this uniswap specific flow and right. Again, I imagine then something like, of course there was this highly contentious sushi swap vampire attack, extremely famous, right? And so does that kind of thing become even easier now where you start like that and you say, okay, we know you want to LP on Uniswap, but you can LP on us and Uniswap.
00:21:23.906 - 00:21:53.790, Speaker B: And then once they get these large network effects, they go to phase two of some kind and they try to migrate away from Uniswap entirely. Maybe that's not very fun, right. But it's just sort of these are these more interesting fanciful ideas I have. Yeah. So I don't know how you guys feel about that. Right. Again, feel free to steer the conversation far away if we don't want to be talking about vampire attacks.
00:21:54.130 - 00:22:06.630, Speaker A: I think it's definitely interesting, I guess at that point what really is a vampire attack if your vampire attack is improving the protocol, right. I think that's very different comparatively.
00:22:08.250 - 00:23:16.700, Speaker C: Let me take a step back from here and ask you maybe a spicy question about liquidity management protocols. The inherent kind of selling point of onchain liquidity management protocols is you by definition implements your logic on chain, right? Maybe all of it. Maybe some of it. But the part that's implemented on chain is the selling point of such protocols. Now aren't they in some sense also by definition, strictly inferior to off chain market maker, in that if you guys start with the same logic, same strategy, but you impose this additional constraint on yourself, that your logic has to live in this self executing smart contract that can't do much in the grand scheme of things, right. What are really the thing that we're trying to gain here? Because you're apparently giving up something.
00:23:18.830 - 00:23:34.820, Speaker B: Yeah. So if I understand correctly, the question is, can a fully on chain liquidity manager ever rival something which can leverage things fully off chain ideas? And.
00:23:39.670 - 00:24:23.490, Speaker C: That, I guess, is the harder question. Maybe the easier one is what are we gaining here? Right? Because I think the complexity trade off that the onchain implementation is giving up is pretty evident. But the exact thing that we're trying to gain here, what do you think it is? Is it just transparency that people can audit the code? Or you think it's some principal agency issue that we're trying to address? Is it high fees that hedge funds are like? What do you think is the realistic selling point of these protocols?
00:24:23.990 - 00:25:19.170, Speaker B: Yeah. Working with so one thing Aracus does a lot of, right, is we also work with protocols, protocols that are tokenized. And these tokenized protocols, they want to improve the liquidity profile for their token to achieve certain goals. And basically this can be quite complicated on on uniswap V three, as we all know to do to do yourself. So even if the protocol has assets to do that, maybe there are ways for that to be streamlined. And I think there you really see that. What is this zero to one improvement about it being on chain, even though, as you say, we give up a lot of optionality or a lot of things by being entirely on chain? Is this transparency, right? If you are working with a traditional market making firm or something, not only is it entirely custodial, right, and they're yes.
00:25:19.170 - 00:25:49.690, Speaker B: Charging high fees, or there are these very interesting deals that they make with they get an option on your token to buy it at a certain price. Right. This is like a classic market making deal. But beyond that, you also have zero transparency of what they're really doing in the market. Right. Like, for instance, it's known that some of these market makers on centralized exchanges and assets that they're not really sure how to trade. They just paint a picture.
00:25:49.690 - 00:26:14.866, Speaker B: They paint a pretty picture in the book of the centralized exchange. But actually, whenever any taker comes, they move their limit orders away because they don't want any takers, because they're not sure how to manage their risk or things like this. Right. As a customer, there like a protocol, you would have no idea that this is happening. Right. So I think this transparency can be really huge. Right.
00:26:14.866 - 00:27:02.322, Speaker B: So the noncustodial ship and the transparency, the fact that you can get just full real time data about how is the liquidity that actually now you own that is simply being run on some automated strategy that fits your needs exactly what it's doing and when. And not only that, also because it's noncustodial, you at any time can simply remove your take everything out and say I don't want to do this anymore. Right. So I think that these are gigantic benefits in my view. And then I guess the last one right on the trader side is always right. I do think DEXes in general could have this issue of how will you ever we have these twelve second block times on Ethereum l one. So how could you ever rival these centralized exchanges? You have to pay fees for market makers who want to move.
00:27:02.322 - 00:27:29.180, Speaker B: But what we lose in that efficiency, which in some places there is something lost you gain in having a fully transparent open market that's globally accessible by anyone. Right. And that's why I think volume on DEXes has grown tremendously even though we do know that we don't rival them in efficiency on chain quite yet.
00:27:30.370 - 00:27:37.790, Speaker C: Got it. Well, thank you for that. Unfortunately I have to step out a bit early, but Austin will continue the conversation.
00:27:38.290 - 00:28:00.566, Speaker A: That I will. Thanks for coming. Shen. So this is off topic. My dad texted me. My dad used to be in the news and so he always texts me during these things to give me tips and he wanted to know where you're at if maybe a very broad view because I know you don't want to DOX yourself, maybe never mind. Don't ask that.
00:28:00.566 - 00:28:08.280, Speaker A: He just wanted to compliment you on the wonderful view. So I just wanted to say.
00:28:10.330 - 00:28:30.666, Speaker B: Hey, thanks. No worries. And I'm not afraid to say that right now I'm here in Zurich, so hey, Austin's dad, it's Zurich. And yeah, it is a nice thought. This isn't where I live or anything, but a friend's apartment and they had such a beautiful view up here. I thought it was perfect fitting.
00:28:30.698 - 00:29:10.990, Speaker A: It is a killer view. It is a very killer view. I have just like my background of my office, so not as fun. Yeah, okay, sorry. We'll get back to it. So I guess one of the things that we want to talk about is what types of improvements from what are the types of improvements that help Arrakis provide better performance? Do you think that it's more engineering optimizations? Like hiring more engineers, more portfolio optimization? Like more quants, more code? What improves Arrakis's performance?
00:29:12.450 - 00:29:13.502, Speaker B: Kind of a spicy question.
00:29:13.556 - 00:29:15.680, Speaker A: Honestly, I don't even know if I know the answer.
00:29:16.050 - 00:30:20.100, Speaker B: Yeah, me neither. There's so much green field here that if you attack any of these, if you say let's make a team, that's just only about shipping the code entirely. Smart contract developers, let's optimize this to the Nth degree, let's write it entirely in Yule and let's fill these smart contracts with all kinds of features. I think there's so much room to just perform amazingly well in the space that we're in, just focusing on that. And then on the other side, you could be very lean in terms of trying to ship code and on chain infrastructure and really just focus on, like you say, I put in that same thing, just sort of just like general on chain analytics. I'm still a little bit, I guess even I would say disappointed with at least what's publicly available with the analytics of understanding what all the LPs are doing. Right.
00:30:20.100 - 00:31:24.966, Speaker B: We're highly incentivized to know exactly what's going on in these markets and it's quite difficult, there's a ton of work to be done there to actually understand what are other LPs doing and in general, and especially if you were going to be getting that in real time. Yeah, it's just right now, I think most of that is super opaque. And even when you see analyses, often they have to be very coarse grained, where for instance, or they only look at the NFT positions manager for Univ Three. Right. And that silos a whole class of all of Aracus doesn't actually integrate with the NFT, things like this, where of course, much of this it improves over time. But I'm still amazed that there's not or I still often feel that there's something lacking there. And again, even to our own understanding, I would still love to understand better what all kinds of LPs are doing and classifying them and understanding them for now.
00:31:24.966 - 00:31:27.560, Speaker B: I feel that there's still a lot of question marks there.
00:31:29.610 - 00:31:54.420, Speaker A: Yeah, it's definitely something that we're thinking about a lot too. It's like, how do we think about what does the community need to become more sophisticated, what analytics do they need? It's just really hard to calculate a lot of this and I think that's sort of just the concerns and the difficulties with working with on chain data. But I do think you're correct that it needs to be solved before.
00:31:56.310 - 00:31:56.626, Speaker B: A.
00:31:56.648 - 00:32:26.380, Speaker A: Lot of capital can onboard. Ironically, people ask me, what do you use to manage your LP positions? And I'm like, I just use Revert finance. Right. I don't have some crazy setup. It's just revert and shout out to them. They do a great job and it's just sort of like funny to me that's honestly almost like best in class and I think it's just two guys. I think there's a lot to be done to sort of improve that area.
00:32:26.910 - 00:33:08.118, Speaker B: Yeah. One other major improvement in whole space that I think we could totally focus on, or anybody could focus on, to really drive value to the on chain LP space is just front end as well, right. To this day, being a Uniswap V three LP is very complex. It's complex on the uni UI, it's complex on all the other peripheral liquidity manager UIs as well, I think. And often, especially if you. Want to provide custom and customized preferences, then I think that just providing better metrics for them to understand how their position is doing. Right.
00:33:08.118 - 00:33:31.402, Speaker B: But also interfaces that just make it easier and more approachable for you to say, I do want to LP. Right. And I do understand what I'm getting into here, and I sort of feel confident about it. Yeah. There's just a ton to do there. And then when you think about Univ four and hooks right. I imagine that this is going to be even another order of magnitude of complexity.
00:33:31.402 - 00:33:57.286, Speaker B: Okay. I want to be an LP. If you go to a fully generalized UI, then you have to be highly proficient in what's going on. Right. And then if you go to something that's more like shipping an easier UX still there, how do you then allow the user to understand what they're getting into? Because you're hiding some of the complexities from yeah, a lot to do.
00:33:57.388 - 00:34:28.402, Speaker A: I agree. I think Cal, like the design lead at Uniswap has been talking a lot about this. He's like the person he's one of the big champions of the simple interface. And he's like, we need to make Lping simple again. Not simple again, but like, the Lping interface much more simple than it is. But yeah, definitely not like something that will be much harder in V Four, but something the team is thinking about, at least on a good note. So we have two more questions.
00:34:28.402 - 00:34:39.160, Speaker A: So I have one more about if you could design or choose one hook design and then hide it as a secret forever, what would you choose and why?
00:34:41.450 - 00:34:50.860, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. Right. Maybe this isn't an answer to your question, but maybe it's a question I have for you.
00:34:51.870 - 00:34:54.138, Speaker A: Right, okay.
00:34:54.224 - 00:35:43.658, Speaker B: Well, because a lot of what happens to me thinking through hooks and right when we just started here too, there was some new hook designs just dropped, some sort of fun hooks, LP rebates and only old accounts and stuff like this. And I think when I originally started thinking about hooks, I thought about it in a way like, yeah, there's going to be different hooks for different things. Lots of different hooks for different things. But sometimes the more that I think about it, I think that what about hooks that are like monolithic hooks, right? Hooks that are everything in the kitchen sink? Or is that the direction that hooks might end up going? Like, Why? Or why not? This is maybe a question I have for you. Not an answer to your question yet.
00:35:43.824 - 00:35:44.726, Speaker A: I love chatting.
00:35:44.758 - 00:35:44.954, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:44.992 - 00:36:22.214, Speaker A: So that's mean it's a good I don't I don't think every pool will have a monolithic design. I think that it's too dependent on the asset know? Like, the Dai USDC ones are always going to be very different than the USDC ETH ones. I talk a lot about this with Oracle specifically. I'm like the one last remaining non. Like, I am okay with Oracles. I'm, like one of the last remaining people who believes that. And that's because I think that in the past, we built Oracles for every single asset type, and they all kind of sucked at all of them.
00:36:22.214 - 00:36:42.634, Speaker A: I think that in the future, we can build Oracles that are good for the asset pair that's in mind, and you don't have to worry about that as much and enshrine them like you did in V Three. And so I think that sort of thinking rolls up where you will have big classifications of pools or token types.
00:36:42.682 - 00:36:43.280, Speaker B: That.
00:36:45.010 - 00:37:30.058, Speaker A: Only use specific hooks. But I do think that there will be, like a set of this is good and this is one hook, but it's like ten different designs that it can do. Maybe like limit orders and TWAM and an Oracle, or probably not an Oracle, but like, those two. And then maybe some of these lever reducing hooks. So I think those will maybe exist in the future. I think a lot about like, there's three different types of asset pairs that I think about. I think about ETH USDC is in its own.
00:37:30.058 - 00:37:54.670, Speaker A: And then there's all mid caps, actually, maybe four, all mid caps versus ETH. Then all long tail tokens versus ETH. And then like, stable coins. I think they all need different things, and they all have different like, the ETH USDC market is so competitive. It needs lever reducing hooks. It needs to be as gas efficient as possible. But, like, a dai USDC pair is really an oracle.
00:37:54.670 - 00:38:26.240, Speaker A: Maybe it needs a Breaker or a very simple Oracle, or just things that are not as complex. And so I think that there'll never be sort of this one monolithic thing that is included in every single pool, because every market needs something slightly different. But I do think that within those asset categories, there might be sort of this idea of a monolithic end all, be all hook until the next good design comes around. And then we go to that.
00:38:27.170 - 00:39:36.574, Speaker B: Yeah, this was more my question. I totally agree that there are different markets, right? And so there's no one hook for all these different market types. But even if we were to just zoom in on ETH USDC, right, will it be that there should be many different ETH USDC hooks that achieve different things for different users? And I could see that, right? Maybe one that just really optimized limit orders on ETH USDC as opposed to other types of hooks. But I do see potentially just shelling points around like, well, this is instead, right? Originally I thought, okay, maybe you ship the hook that really does the dynamic fees, and then you ship the hook that does the Loss versus rebalancing minimization, and you ship the hook that does X and Y and Z. And then you realize, well, wait, why don't you just put all of those in the one best hook. Right. And so that's where yeah, I do think potentially there could be these kind of best hooks for that specific market, let's say, that kind of SAP up all the liquidity.
00:39:36.574 - 00:40:23.506, Speaker B: And so, yeah. Now to finally get back to your question, I think this is the hook I would want to keep secret, the best one, the one that's everything in the kitchen sink. And maybe to elaborate what I think that is, because my goal here was to drop so much alpha that my team would be mad at me. So I think we talked about this loss versus rebalancing thing that I'm super excited about. But if you look at the loss versus rebalancing paper in the equation for LP profit and loss, it's actually three things right there's spreads or fees that you capture. Right. And this is a positive income markups, however we want to call them.
00:40:23.506 - 00:41:05.082, Speaker B: I say I leave it as not just fees, because maybe you can capture the spread in a different way, but let's just call them trading fees for now. That's one term of the equation. Then there's loss versus rebalancing. This term you want to minimize since this is a negative one. And then there's also this market risk component, right. The fact the hedgeable market risk of your and then this is the third component of the LP profit and loss. And so, in my opinion, yeah, the hook I would want to keep secret from the world that I'm now not keeping secret from the world, is a hook that attacks all three of these terms in that equation to really just provide the best experience for the LP.
00:41:05.082 - 00:41:10.878, Speaker B: Again, maybe I'm just only thinking right now about a very high volume pool, like an ETH USDC.
00:41:11.054 - 00:41:12.754, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's the killer one.
00:41:12.792 - 00:41:12.994, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:13.032 - 00:41:44.880, Speaker A: If it's a perfect loss versus rebalancing hook on ETH USDC, it's kind of game over, right? I mean, I game over. That's the best possible hook you could come up with. And hopefully someday maybe someone on this call will come up with it, but we'll see. Okay, I guess we have our last rapid fire questions, if ever. When do you think V four will pass v three in volume in months?
00:41:46.770 - 00:42:12.114, Speaker B: I think it definitely will. I think history shows us I was uncertain how quick migration would happen to V three, and maybe you know how many months it took. I don't, but it felt fast. It was very fast. Yeah, it was extremely fast. And right. This is what's cool about on chain stuff, is the mobility in comparison to the traditional finance is just incredible.
00:42:12.114 - 00:42:23.626, Speaker B: Right. So if everybody sees it's better, everybody can move tomorrow. So I think we're talking about how many months from launch? Like univ four launches? Yeah.
00:42:23.808 - 00:42:30.150, Speaker A: Deployment and then trading works. The interface and everything works.
00:42:30.320 - 00:42:54.610, Speaker B: Right, cool. So it gets deployed and the interface is there. How many months from there? I'm going to say maybe two. And I think that's even long. But it's because there's a lot of complexity to shipping hooks that actually make things better. And that also you want to understand these smart contracts, too. So there's maybe some new smart contract risk associated.
00:42:55.210 - 00:43:23.600, Speaker A: Yeah, I think probably. I do agree. The other one is how many hook designs will see significant volume in V? Four, six months after launch? Do you think it's going to be very few hooks that do a lot of volume, a breadth of hooks? What number? Dan said ten. Just for give you a little alpha there.
00:43:24.290 - 00:43:25.566, Speaker B: Cool to have a number.
00:43:25.668 - 00:43:26.320, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:30.530 - 00:44:10.460, Speaker B: I think at the beginning, there's a lot of excitement in the world right now about all these different possible hooks. I hope we see this wide variety. I think at first it will be hard to know besides certain kinds of signaling. And also one last thing that's quite important, right, is now, because there can be a full sea of hooks, those who actually do control the are at the trader, right? Like the one inches and the uniswap UIs as well. And all of these UIs, the hooks that they search through is super important. Right. So if all of these UIs only search through ten hooks, then for sure it's ten or less also.
00:44:10.460 - 00:44:31.922, Speaker B: But if they search through this really wide variety, I would see it starting wide and going down over time. And so I'd love to see a world where actually at first, there's a bit of a chaos and we're seeing more than ten actually sort of splitting the volume. But yeah, where will it end up? And again, is this on any given.
00:44:31.976 - 00:44:35.620, Speaker A: Pair or just no, I think just in general.
00:44:36.550 - 00:45:13.742, Speaker B: Yeah, in general, then, yeah, you need like at least five because you already mentioned that there's kind of a couple of different categories. Right. So I would say no less than five because stable coins will just definite stablecoin markets will definitively have a different hook than the other ones, for instance, but hope that there is some variety, though. Like I say, I'm wondering if there are going to be these winner take all monolithic hooks. Yeah, exactly. We don't know there will be. I trust Dan with 1010 was a good one.
00:45:13.796 - 00:45:18.180, Speaker A: He had a good argument for it, so I was like, that's fair.
00:45:19.750 - 00:45:20.066, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:20.088 - 00:45:30.680, Speaker A: That's sort of all the questions we have. I don't know if there's anything else we chat about or we can sort of let you go. Nice of you to have you on.
00:45:31.530 - 00:46:21.014, Speaker B: Well, yeah, first of all, thanks for having me. And I think just want to mention that there's so much activity and noise in what's going on, and as a developer who was just hacking around on DFI and sort of happened on this and didn't just happen on it. Right. It was actually in the univ three first post that, hey, there should be these peripheral protocols, but it was just really started out much more. Never knew I would be here with this protocol with hundreds of millions of dollars inside of it. And I think it's a testament to I feel happy about really deciding to not do something super zero sum and instead work on top of what's already working great. And you see that you really reap the benefits of that.
00:46:21.014 - 00:46:41.600, Speaker B: So basically, not trying to fight with uniswap, but just help uniswap grow is what allowed us to grow. And so, yeah, it's great to be here and to be in more contact, because in those days, I didn't know any of you guys. I was just a person in my underwear trying to figure out how univ three ought to work.
00:46:42.050 - 00:47:23.734, Speaker A: Very different. Right? You met us at we'll be seeing you at ECC, and we saw you at Denver, so it's nice to always hang out. All right, thanks, everyone, for coming. Obviously, go and follow Cassandra on Twitter, follow Arrakis, follow me and Shin, follow the Uniswap labs, Twitter, all of those fun things. And we'll be back in about two weeks, probably with another hook conversation. So if you have any sort of feedback in the meantime, feel free to reach out. Condra, thank you for coming, and we'll see you in about maybe like a week or two in person, for sure.
00:47:23.772 - 00:47:24.290, Speaker B: See you in Paris.
