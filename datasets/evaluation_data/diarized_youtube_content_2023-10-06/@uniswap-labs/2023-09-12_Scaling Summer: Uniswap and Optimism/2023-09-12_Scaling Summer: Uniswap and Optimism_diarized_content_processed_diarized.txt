00:00:00.570 - 00:00:01.120, Speaker A: It.
00:00:04.130 - 00:00:42.202, Speaker B: Okay, cool. And we should be live. I guess we'll wait like, a minute or two just for people to kind of fill in. But yeah, maybe we should start with some quick introductions, actually, I guess some general context. We're here as part of the Scaling Summer campaign. It's a campaign that Uniswap is running in partnership with four of the major L two S that we support in our wallet. We're excited today to have on Smith from the Optimism team and Spencer from Uniswap wallet team.
00:00:42.202 - 00:00:45.082, Speaker B: And I'll let you guys introduce yourself.
00:00:45.136 - 00:00:46.310, Speaker C: A little more in depth.
00:00:46.470 - 00:00:47.900, Speaker B: Smith, if you want to take it.
00:00:49.790 - 00:01:05.838, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'm smitt. I lead DeFi at Op labs. I have been at Optimism for the last two years. Very excited about this chat. In general. We've been working with the Uniswap team for quite some time now.
00:01:05.838 - 00:01:36.220, Speaker A: I think that question that we talked about earlier before this call, Noah, sparked just how long the relationship was going on. And we'll go into it a little bit during the conversation, too. But yeah, I've been here for the last few years, been in crypto for since 2014. Really got into it for the Gamification, was into, like, bitcoin. I played this game in the back in the day called RuneScape. Very close parallels. Here we are grinding years later.
00:01:38.510 - 00:02:17.978, Speaker C: Cool. By the way, it's great to meet you. Smith. I don't think you said hi before. I'm Spencer. I work at Uniswap Labs with NOAA and I'm on the wallet team. I've been here for almost two years now and seen the wallet in many different forms from way before the App Store and then now the App Store and generally, let's see, spend a lot of time right now thinking about the whole future of wallets conversations around account abstraction and NPC and all of that good stuff.
00:02:17.978 - 00:02:25.530, Speaker C: And yeah, I did a lot of NFT trading back in the day, and now I do a lot of meme coin money losing.
00:02:29.150 - 00:02:57.250, Speaker B: Amazing. Well, thank both of you for being here. I think it's going to be a great chat for everyone who doesn't know. Also, I'm Noah. I'm on the partnerships team here at Uniswap. And I guess a great place to start would just be Smith, if you could give us some background on kind of just the optimism story. I actually recently was listening to a talk with Carl and hearing him kind of talk about the transition from plasma to optimism.
00:02:57.250 - 00:03:15.020, Speaker B: And I remember in the first internship I ever had in crypto in 2018, I wrote some articles about ethereum and scaling on plasma when I had just no understanding of what that really meant. So we'd love to hear a little bit about that journey and where you guys are.
00:03:17.390 - 00:03:40.482, Speaker A: Plasma. That's a blast from the past, for sure. Yeah. Why don't we start there? So originally, Optimism, the group before it was called Optimism, it was a research group called Plasma group and what they were trying to build. And this was originally our founders ben, Jing and Carl. They're trying to build technology that scales Ethereum. And this is when the whole scaling rave was going on.
00:03:40.482 - 00:04:07.420, Speaker A: We're trying to figure out a way to infinitely scale this type of block space and they built it. Right? So this is like technology that they built. It was eventually adopted by teams like Polygon and Amisigo. But when we released it, they realized that the devex wasn't there. Nobody wanted to use it. I feel like this was a different time as well. There wasn't as many developers that were open to learning new tooling, new stacks, languages, those kind of things.
00:04:07.420 - 00:04:44.040, Speaker A: And after the Uxrs and User Experience research in general, they decided to go towards more EVM compatibility and equivalents. We just wanted to build stuff that every developer can already use out of the box. And that's when we got into this vision of optimistic rollups. That crossover was kind of interesting. It started with Vitalik drawing up details of this thing he called shadow chains, I believe. Carl, for those of you that don't know, he used to work at the Es as well and he's very close to Vitalik. And then eventually he coined the term like optimistic roll up.
00:04:44.040 - 00:05:02.320, Speaker A: I don't know if this was when he was still there or he had created optimism by then. And he set out to scale Ethereum correctly with optimistic rollups after that. So that's kind of like the origin story and raised money, built out the technology, and now we've been growing our team ever since.
00:05:03.570 - 00:05:11.040, Speaker B: Amazing. Actually, just on top of that, could you give a quick, high level definition of what an optimistic roll up is?
00:05:12.390 - 00:05:58.442, Speaker A: Yeah. So the simplest way to think about it is Ethereum block space is expensive. We have decentralization there, obviously. And in an ideal world, you want all of your transactions just to happen on Ethereum. But the problem is that it doesn't scale to the masses. And if you were here during DFI summer and some of the bull markets, you'll notice that gas just jacks up, right? $2,000 for a transaction sometimes because people really want that block space to make sure their transactions get through. So the optimistic roll up in general is a technology that takes off the expensive compute that happens on Ethereum and it compresses it and throws it back down to Ethereum.
00:05:58.442 - 00:06:25.590, Speaker A: So in that sense, we're still inheriting the security of Ethereum because the transactions and the ordering and all that stuff is still going back down to Ethereum. But you really need to remove the heavy part of the compute off of the main L1 layer. So that's the solution that everybody's been talking about. There's two different types of roll ups ZK and optimistic. Both have similar properties. But in general, it's about removing that difficult, expensive part of compute off of the L1 layer.
00:06:27.530 - 00:07:02.820, Speaker B: Awesome. And yeah, I know Vitalik came out with I could totally be messing up the name, but, like, a roll up centric vision for sort of the future of ethereum. And while I think we all kind of think scaling solutions will be applied to all kinds of businesses and platforms and protocols, one of the most interesting things is right now how the actual user interacts with that. And so Spencer throwing it to you, and I'll ask you in a second, too. Do you remember the first time that you used an L2 and what you were doing on there?
00:07:05.030 - 00:07:48.878, Speaker C: Yeah, it's crazy because this is probably like a year and a half, maybe maximum two years ago, but it feels like ten years ago, the first one. I wish it was optimism. I think it was well, I guess polygon, if you want to I won't go into that side of the debate, but let's call that a scaling solution. And what was I doing? Yeah, it was some NFT thing on polygon, I think. Crypto unicorns, maybe. And then I had a lot of fun. When Uniswap deployed on polygon, there was an NFT thing called non fungible Olive Gardens, which unfortunately received a DMCA request and no longer exists on the primary interfaces.
00:07:48.878 - 00:08:15.020, Speaker C: But myself and a few other Internet people with no life launched a little fake token not a fake, a meme token. That was for fun and revolved around Olive Garden. And it was really cool because this kind of thing you could not do affordably on L One. And so doing that on an L2 enabled just creative fun.
00:08:16.270 - 00:08:20.694, Speaker B: Wait, Fencer, was that you telling us that you were the creator of non fungible Algarve?
00:08:20.742 - 00:08:40.180, Speaker C: No, it certainly was not me. I was a fan. But yeah, that was a really funny time. It was like Christmas 2021, I think. And I had just bought ETH at 3800. So, yeah, that was a different time.
00:08:41.030 - 00:08:53.560, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah. I am the proud owner of two non fungible breadsticks from that collection, which are some of my prized possessions. Smith do you remember what you were first doing on an L2 when you got there?
00:08:54.090 - 00:09:27.886, Speaker A: Oh, man, it's been such a long time. I would say that the only reason I'm in crypto, or the main reason I got into crypto, was because I'm an on chain nut. I've just been doing activity on chain for so many years now. My exposure is definitely not L2 first. I've definitely done, like, AVAX, polygon, B and B chain. A lot of those ethereum l one. I was a very heavy power user of ethereum L One at one point, and when I first started Op, the ecosystem was really fresh.
00:09:27.886 - 00:09:56.906, Speaker A: There's not much going on at the time. These things are organic. It takes time to build applications to bring on more and more developers, especially when you don't have a distribution channel. So a good example of that is, like, base. A lot of people want to develop on Base right away because it's not like a new L2 new company that has nothing on their ecosystem. It's like a Fortune 500 company that has tens of millions of users already there. So that's a very attractive thing to do.
00:09:56.906 - 00:10:32.454, Speaker A: But for optimism, we had to build everything from scratch. So definitely wasn't my first L2 experience. I would say that I do anything ranging from Dgen DFI. My background is traditionally in off chain derivatives anyways, after college. And, yeah, I messed around with all Dgen DFI lending stuff. I got a little bit into the NFT stuff on ecosystems. But the experience that you get from transacting on L One versus transacting on a polygon BNB optimism arbitram vastly different.
00:10:32.454 - 00:10:44.860, Speaker A: And the experience is so much better. So that attracted me a lot to trying to build even towards that vision of onboarding a billion users is going to take this technology, it can't scale on L One itself.
00:10:46.190 - 00:11:27.560, Speaker B: Totally. And I like how it might be because you work at an L2, but kind of making the distinction between being, like, an Ethereum user and an ethereum L One user. Because on the L2 S, we are all still ultimately using Ethereum for that security. But, yeah, I appreciated that little difference in language you had there, kind of moving on from that to where we are today. Spencer, how else are you using L2 S right now? Are there, like, new activities you've picked up, new things that you've been able to do maybe in the wallet or not since those early days?
00:11:28.990 - 00:12:07.190, Speaker C: Yeah, I do too much on chain. I should really keep my money in Treasuries. But, yeah, I think the most fun thing I think Base has been pretty crazy and fun over the last couple of weeks. And obviously with friendtech, I've been spending time there. But last week, last Friday, there was a fun project called Not City Bike, which turned every city bike in New York into an NFT. And if you look at my wallet transaction history, it's me minting, like, 50 bikes in Soho.
00:12:08.890 - 00:12:09.880, Speaker A: On Base.
00:12:10.650 - 00:12:16.760, Speaker C: That was a fun thing. It turned out to be not so fun a little bit after, but that's a different story.
00:12:18.730 - 00:12:29.610, Speaker B: Very cool. And Smith, same thing to you, kind of. What interesting ways are you using L2 S right now that either weren't feasible before or just weren't happening on chain?
00:12:30.850 - 00:13:09.206, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's a lot and maybe Base opened up the world to newer types of UX and newer types of opportunity. It's always been fascinating to see that maybe it's like the perspective and the differences in implementation that make a difference, rather than always changing the underlying architecture and client layer technology. So I've tried out Frontech. I love the UX. I think it's an amazing type of UX that opens up people to a different world of crypto. There's a few of those that I'm really excited about. There's one called Infinex that I'm really excited about as well.
00:13:09.206 - 00:13:39.874, Speaker A: The Synthetics Team is I believe they're incubating this, but it's a similar idea. You want to abstract away the chain, you want to abstract away the wallet experience. You just want people to use a product. That's good. Right? I still do a little bit of DeFi since I'm a bit more crypto native. I still find myself wallet UX doing stuff. But I am really just very excited to see where this world goes with the newer EIPS account abstraction, those kind of things.
00:13:39.874 - 00:13:59.250, Speaker A: It's going to unlock quite a bit of new use cases. And I see cool things coming out. Like, I started using Farcaster the other day. It's something that I couldn't have thought of would be on chain. And yeah, social media is a very cool idea on chain. Privacy is a cool idea on chain. DeFi is obviously a very cool idea on chain.
00:13:59.250 - 00:14:14.640, Speaker A: And we're going to see a lot more of these that I hope that everybody just tries them out. Because if you don't try them out, you'll never know if it's a cool UX or a cool experience for you. So I've just been trying everything out. Just keep trying.
00:14:15.890 - 00:15:03.440, Speaker B: Totally. And yeah, one of the things I love about L2 S is that I can remember a time when I was first dabbling in NFTs. Later in 2020, early in 2021, there was so much experimentation that needed to happen for people, but as prices got so ridiculously high, paying like 2040, $80 to do a mint and launch some contracts and have an experiment becomes somewhat unfeasible. Although ultimately that is kind of like an incentive for people to go build out L two S. So everything does happen for a reason. But yeah, I think those are experiences that really make the user benefits of L two S present for people.
00:15:05.090 - 00:15:33.990, Speaker A: Absolutely. Just a quick note. I remember this time where a friend of mine and I, we tried to build like an NFT collection, like a 10,000 PFP project on chain. He spent a lot of time on the art, we did a lot of marketing around it. And then on the day of the mint to deploy the contracts, it was like 30 grand, and we just did not have the money for it. So someone else ended up fronting it. But it's just a testament to that's crazy, you can't bring artists on chain if it costs 30 grand to deploy the contracts.
00:15:33.990 - 00:15:39.930, Speaker A: But yeah, just really interesting, unique experience that also drove me towards cheaper solutions.
00:15:41.470 - 00:17:04.740, Speaker B: Yeah, even for a previous role I was in was more getting individual artists to come and mint one piece on chain was what I was out there doing. And when that would cost like fifty dollars to one hundred dollars to mint one piece for someone, oftentimes we would end up just covering that. Because asking an artist who's kind of scraping by, like, doing their own thing to put that kind of investment into something that is not, like, the clearest way for them to make money that they've seen before is definitely a big ask, I think, something I'm kind of interested to hear from you, smith, and maybe this dabbles into the superchain stuff. But yeah, I find that looking in on crypto, whether you're like a brand or a big company or just a new user, there's a lot of scaling stuff going on. You're seeing like ethereum, you've got alternative layer ones, you've got other L2s. There's people out here using layer three terminology. And so I guess to someone looking in, what is your sort of general pitch for optimism? What is your niche? How should people be thinking of the value prop of Op?
00:17:06.250 - 00:17:31.626, Speaker A: It's a good question. And we've also been thinking a lot about this internally. I would say that optimism has always been a technology company. First we've been trying to build open sourced MIT licensed tech. We want the entire world to know that this is a public good for the future of Onchain. And that's how we started. And that ethos is really deeply embedded in the DNA of the team.
00:17:31.626 - 00:18:20.534, Speaker A: So that's like the first part. Now what we wanted to do was we wanted to build technology that scaled, but also we could prove that it was a good proof of concept for scaling and ideas and decentralization. So Op Mainet was the first proof of concept for that. We wanted to see if we could build a very successful ecosystem. Because if we could do that, then you can definitely have people adopt the technology better. So I can imagine a world where if we had MIT licensed tech and Op Mainet didn't exist, base wouldn't be built on top of, right? Like, there's just no proof of concept to prove that this thing works in production. So it really was like all of our eggs in one basket in the beginning because we wanted to make sure that we could prove that this technology scales in production.
00:18:20.534 - 00:18:56.598, Speaker A: It goes to accommodate for many, many different use cases and ideas. And I think we've come back down to like, we're a technology company. We want to create technology that scales to the world. A unique, interesting point that we actually learned a couple of weeks ago, maybe like a month ago, was when WorldCoin launched on Op mainnet. We actually hit capacity, like almost capacity for the network, which is further testament to these networks. And things don't vertically scale forever. Or even if they do, that's not the model for optimist scroll ups or like the way that we've designed it.
00:18:56.598 - 00:19:15.870, Speaker A: So you do need to horizontally scale. So we've gone down this other idea of a positive sum future. Let's horizontally scale. Let's get more and more use cases. And that's why Base is not a threat, they're not cannibalistic. They're very excited to work very closely with us. They're a second core contributor to the Op stack.
00:19:15.870 - 00:19:45.730, Speaker A: We're excited about that. We want them to bring real use cases on. Yeah, I would say that the value prop for Op Mainnet. This is a good example that Jesse likes to use a lot from the Coinbase team. He always says that if we're building like a nation state, like say, let's say the United States, op Mainnet is like one state and it doesn't have to be its own successful financial hub. Maybe that's not the exact thing that it's going for. It could be like Washington DC.
00:19:45.730 - 00:20:19.202, Speaker A: We focus a lot of time on governance. But Washington DC does have a lot of creativity. It has finances, it has things that flourish there as well. And then Base could be like something like New York where it's a exciting hub, it's where a lot of people live and there's a lot of users there and they focus a lot more on the finance part of it rather than the art part of it. And we do think that the world's moving towards this place more and more. So yeah, I would say that Op Mainet is one piece of that puzzle. It's the thing that has proven our PMF and success and we're going to continue to double down on it and build it.
00:20:19.202 - 00:20:39.750, Speaker A: And our identity as optimism is like the entire collective. So you could consider it to be the collective of chains. You could be considering it as like Op labs, core contributors and whatnot to build towards that future. But optimism is largely like a vision for a better on chain future rather than just Mainet.
00:20:41.790 - 00:21:10.530, Speaker B: Love that. And I guess depending on who is listening, could you dive into sort of just like explaining what Base being built on top of Op or on the Op stack means? Same with Zoro Chain, who's actually our partner in these quests and campaign that we're doing right now. And yeah, just kind of like what that means and how that fits into the overall thesis of sort of using this stack to build horizontally.
00:21:11.830 - 00:21:50.398, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So Zoro and Base are very unique cases. You may have noticed that there are other Op stack chains, chains that are using the open source MIT license technology, which is totally okay. That's why we open sourced it. So people can experiment, people can use it. But Base and Zura specifically want to opt into this thing called the superchain. And right, we have this blog post on Law of Chains, what that means like being a part of the superchain, there's like this component of rev share, but largely what we wanted was a positive sum collective and future towards maintaining a stack and a stack for the many decades to come.
00:21:50.398 - 00:22:52.098, Speaker A: So I think this is my opinion, and I will say that maybe somebody else has a different point of view on it. But for a technology stack to exist long term, decentralized and onboard billions of people in the future, you need the biggest power users of that stack to be contributing to it. So you definitely need Base to contribute to it. Even the people that are forking it, please contribute to it, help out, because we're trying to help each other out by building a standard for the world on the other side. We need to survive, right? We're going to be maintaining the stack forever. So there is a portion of rev share that we need to all agree on to support the development of the stack and the technology and the public goods that will be helping out each ecosystem for the decades to come as well. So now we have this world where the public goods that helped Op Mainnet, we're also thinking through the public goods that help the chains that are part of the superchain, the collective, what's going to help Base, what's going to help Zora the most? And the entire ecosystem is coming together, the collective is coming together to help solve that problem.
00:22:52.098 - 00:23:24.954, Speaker A: So Base and Zora specifically want to opt into that horizontal scalability vision. I think we see a world where things aren't thought of as chains forever. We really need to get to a world where what we're doing is we're commoditizing block space. That's decentralized, right? There's no religion here. It's not supposed to be tribalistic in nature. We want to support PMF products and technology for the years to come. And if your app needs decentralization, well, we're trying to build that out very carefully.
00:23:24.954 - 00:23:42.530, Speaker A: We're going towards that stage two roll up angle as fast as we can. And yeah, I think it's an exciting vision. And once again I will disclaimer that this is a positive sum opt in vision, it is not a requirement to utilize a stack.
00:23:44.470 - 00:24:28.850, Speaker B: Very cool and kind of an interesting point that was in there. I know we have in crypto we have these kind of very short term sort of like playbooks for doing things. Could be like splitting a protocol with like a foundation and a labs element and we're kind of just figuring all those out. And in the open source world, there's obviously other open source projects and lots of contributors all over the world for this superchain thesis. And the revenue share you described, is that something that crypto uniquely enables being able to share that value or is there a model for that with other open source software?
00:24:30.310 - 00:25:12.160, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good know. Before I started at like, we had this really veteran figure on the team. His name was Josh Stein, he's still on the board and he always used to bring up this example of like Red Hat, which is like an open source software company that was bought for billions of dollars. And that's the model that they succeed and survive with. But the reality is open source tech and software needs better incentive models to survive in crypto and Web Three. So one of the biggest missions for optimism was to figure out a way in which open source software can live freely and people can contribute to those type of ideals. Retroactive public goods was one example.
00:25:12.160 - 00:25:41.974, Speaker A: It's our thesis on how to actually accomplish this. But I do think that the model for open source is very different in Web Three than it is for Web Two. I'm not sure if that answered your question, but it's something that we're definitely working towards. Open source is tough. I would say that even the most successful open source companies have raised money. We have raised money. It's a very difficult thing to do and that's why this entire thing decentralizing.
00:25:41.974 - 00:25:55.280, Speaker A: Getting the foundation set up, having a core contributor like Op Labs, core contributor like Base, it's a multi year effort, right? It's not going to happen overnight, but that's how you make open source software survive for the many decades to come.
00:25:57.570 - 00:25:58.320, Speaker B: Amazing.
00:25:59.730 - 00:26:00.094, Speaker A: Cool.
00:26:00.132 - 00:26:36.250, Speaker B: Well, so to bring it back a little bit more to the consumer element, the uniswap wallet is somewhere that we think showcases the ability to use L two S really well. Makes it easy, makes it user friendly. Obviously the timelines in crypto are crazy in that maybe a couple of years ago we started using L two S and like Spencer said, it feels like that was ten years ago. So we are just getting started in the grand scheme of things. But Spencer, what are some of the things you would like to see inside of the wallet that L two S and scaling kind of enables?
00:26:38.430 - 00:27:42.458, Speaker C: Yeah, I think before answering that, I think one comment on the previous note of mental models of open source software being able to make money off of open source software. I think there's actually a lot of examples either that are good and bad. Like any developer of these new backend technologies. I think the research lab behind Apache and Hadoop and Kubernetes, these are technically open source technologies that have a de facto company that implements it and it's open source. But the best operator, at least in the beginning of that tech, can be whatever for profit company and then eventually you go to a longer term that it's kind of an open license. And that's very similar to the unisoft model, right, where you have a BSL license on the code for V three, which allows unisoft labs to have the canonical deployment of the technology and code. But once that expires, then it's in the public domain.
00:27:42.458 - 00:28:59.610, Speaker C: So it's definitely a tricky economic incentive thing, right? Like email is an open standard and I think there's a very good case to be made for the whole public goods argument that these things should be public goods and not companies. And maybe some incentives are better aligned when they're public goods than companies, but that's a different kind of worms UX stuff or, like, fun things in the wallet to add to L2. Let's see. Personally, this is just my personal opinion, I think being able to use bridges, whether it's the canonical default bridge or something else. Yeah, I think there are many times I want to move assets across chains, especially with the base stuff happening. And then I guess I'll give one example, like WorldCoin launched, and I like WorldCoin, and I wanted to buy some of the token, so I bought it, and then I bought it on L One, and then I realized, wait, it's the same thing as on optimism. So I was like, okay, let me sell it on L One and then bridge over ETH to Optimism, rebuy the token on optimism.
00:28:59.610 - 00:29:48.150, Speaker C: And then from there, I could LP on optimism at much better unit economics as far as gas costs go compared to on mainnet. And so to do that, I couldn't really use the uniswap wallet as is. I had to use some web tools and wallet connected, so that's probably the number one thing I see. Number two, I think, is more creator economy type things, like what Friendtech has opened up. I don't think everything should live on chain, but some things can live on chain. For example, like micro payments are a uniquely enabled thing on chain. So I think there's some cool stuff there, but it's still insanely hard to tell a creator like, okay, first download this wallet and then buy ETH, and then bridge the ETH, and then now you're on this thing called optimism.
00:29:48.150 - 00:29:54.230, Speaker C: It's not the simplest thing, totally.
00:29:54.310 - 00:30:56.560, Speaker B: And, yeah, even from I always obviously use myself as a gauge for how complicated crypto things are. And when I have trouble doing something, I accidentally sent some ETH for Friend tech to their main net address instead of the base address where it was supposed to go or something like that, and it was like $20 or $30 worth of fees, but now it is theirs on main net and not in my account. And, yeah, doing that, I kind of was bummed for a second, and then I was like, man, it would be really difficult to explain to someone who was brand new to crypto exactly what was going on there. Smith to pass that over to you, you're more inside of the L2 world than Spence and I are. What are some things that you guys would like to see inside of a wallet or inside of uniswap UX generally that you think could push the ecosystem forward?
00:30:57.890 - 00:31:58.878, Speaker A: It's a good question. Maybe I'll start by saying that UX may seem like it's not perfect yet, but I want to remind people that it was a lot worse at one point as well. It wasn't amazing before either, and we have made really large strides in some areas, so I definitely want to call that out, give credit where credits do I think. The problems that plague good UX are a difficult problem to solve in general. It's a balance between self custody versus maybe giving up some of that power and not having it fully custodial or self custody in general. But I honestly think that this UX problem will be solved very soon. My thesis is that with account abstraction, all these kind of things, so many people are working on the problem, and when that many people are working on that problem, it's bound to have huge breakthroughs.
00:31:58.878 - 00:32:52.770, Speaker A: Fronttech was an example of a moving of UX in a different direction, and it's just the beginning of something much larger, I'd say. One interesting thing that I'm excited about is let's abstract away chains. We really don't need to be thinking about these ecosystems and their branding as chains. They're decentralized compute layers, right? So nobody knows they're using AWS or GCP or Azure in the background when they go to a website. And that's for good reason, because it doesn't make sense for that to be a barrier of entry for a user to utilize an app, a protocol, a thing on the website or the internet. So long term, I see a world where even if we had, let's say, hundreds and hundreds of roll ups, we can't have a drop down of 100 different networks. That's not going to work.
00:32:52.770 - 00:33:20.038, Speaker A: And we do need to abstract these things away. So I'd love to see that we're definitely going in that direction a lot more. And that's why the superchain vision was super exciting for us. These things are going to get abstracted away more and more. These layers are going to share user bases, as they should. They shouldn't be isolated and it shouldn't be against business models to do that, right? We don't want to. The incentives are not aligned.
00:33:20.038 - 00:33:39.010, Speaker A: If optimism has to maintain its revenue at one singular hub like Op mainnet, we'll never grow beyond a certain point if that's the case. So yeah, excited for more and more networks to come out, roll ups to come out and see how the UX gets better from both the account abstraction angle but also the network angle.
00:33:40.550 - 00:33:57.080, Speaker B: Super cool. And just because we've chatted about this before, could you touch on some of the interesting interoperability between Op stack chains and Op stack main net, or I guess that is one of them?
00:33:57.950 - 00:35:09.870, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Without going into too much details, because there's a lot of technical jargon here as well. We see a world where if we're going to horizontally scale and connect all these things, they need to have message passing between chains, they need to have interoperability done correctly. We can't have bad incentives and bad actors do the interoperability either. So we need to make sure that everybody's on the same page to make sure that nobody's extracting too much value out of it either. So in a world that's ideal, you can do things on base from Op mainnet you can access liquidity on Op mainnet from base and different networks provide different benefits, right? So you could see that Zora is like a place for artists and creators, but there's also crossovers for artists and creators elsewhere and you don't want the interoperability to be a barrier for that. So, long story short, I think we're getting to a place where everyone understands that these things to abstract away completely the wallet, UX needs to be better.
00:35:09.870 - 00:35:36.840, Speaker A: There needs to be just like an interoperability layer that everybody is comfortable using. It needs to be decentralized and secure. We want it to be very secure so that people don't have to worry about assets going from one chain to the other and not having to worry about whether or not it's going to be seized, those kind of things. So yeah, it's an active R and D process and we're building actively towards it.
00:35:37.790 - 00:36:12.690, Speaker C: I have a quick question on that. So I like the general super chain thesis and I like the notion of abstracting away all the chains and the interoperability is one of the key benefits of crypto. And one of the problems that gave rise to LTUs in the first place was just congestion on main net. In a world where you have a super chain and you are reliant on message passing, can there be such thing as congestion of the message? Bridges?
00:36:14.950 - 00:37:06.900, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good question. My gut take answer is that it's probably possible, but that's also something that we should think through, like the details of when we're designing it. The reality is that this is a difficult problem to solve, right, atomic transactions across different chains and networks. And my gut reaction is that it's not going to be atomic right away, it's going to be like higher latency, it's not going to be perfect. And we're going to learn a lot from use cases. We're going to see how uniswap interacts across multiple chains and we want to do it from product experience driven ways rather than us thinking of a design that makes sense, applying it and it doesn't work for all the use cases. So we're definitely doing a lot of research and UXR for this.
00:37:06.900 - 00:37:23.100, Speaker A: And I would say that question that you asked is probably something that would come out during UXR as well when we have more and more things utilizing interoperability and more and more networks, trying to spread the load horizontally. It's a great question and I think we're going to learn together.
00:37:27.070 - 00:37:43.330, Speaker B: Cool. And Spence, I was actually going to talk to you some of the stuff that Smith was saying as far as abstracting away the chains goes for user experience. Is that something that you guys think about when tossing around ideas for the wallet?
00:37:45.430 - 00:38:52.594, Speaker C: Yeah, I think what Smith said earlier that users don't know if the app they're using is using GCP or AWS or whatever. Cloud. I think that's the right mental model where I think it gets a little bit confusing with crypto is that we're dealing with real monetary assets or faker real monetary assets, magic, internet money. And so I think suddenly the stakes become a little bit higher and that's why we have blockchains in the first place. Right? And so I think it's difficult because every network will have different types of security guarantees. And so, yeah, in the ideal world I could just use my ETH on main net and then pay a creator on base and you could design a system that works like that today, but you'd end up losing some ETH along the way when in the ideal world you don't lose along the way. So I think to me it seems like we're a little bit away from that vision.
00:38:52.594 - 00:40:00.570, Speaker C: And that network dropdowns, unfortunately, are going to be around for at least six months or a year probably. It'd be great to see how that can be redesigned or rethought. Like for example, I guess in the unisoft wallet, the one key differentiator compared to the uniswap interface is that when you go load your swap interface, you see your assets on all chains. Whereas on uniswap interface, which is kind of the legacy model, which is also the most forked front end in all of crypto, you have an active chain model. Right? And I think active chain is certainly not compatible with this idea of a super chain future. And so when you're in the unisoft wallet and a number of other wallets also do this and you see your assets, I can see my world coin on optimism and I can see my other token on base. And then once I select it, then I'm now swapping on that network.
00:40:00.570 - 00:40:14.800, Speaker C: I think OpenSea does a decent job of this too. Now I think I can see my base NFTs along with my main NFTs. So I think those are the good examples of, in the short term, what abstracting away the chains look like.
00:40:16.530 - 00:41:27.670, Speaker A: Yeah, and just real quick, just to comment on that, because you brought up a really good point. This was also a massive consideration for us because we understand that different networks have different security models and they're not one to one. And that's why we had to create a full stop as to where do we want the superchain line to start and end. And what we're doing is we're going to start and just say that the standard config, what Op Mainet has in production and has had in production for the last several years, that's the only thing that we consider to be a part of the super chain today. Because as soon as you add more and more of these different security models, different data availability layers, different configs block times, those kind of things, it becomes difficult in two things the shared sequencing world when you have a decentralized sequencer. And it's also very hard to trust that this is going to be secure because there's just so many different modifications and standards now. So we want to converge on one so that people can say that, hey, if you're using Op Mainet, if you're using Base, you can also trust this third stack that is launching with the same exact configurations, is a part of the super chain and is managed and shared upgrades with the optimism collective.
00:41:27.670 - 00:41:45.280, Speaker A: I think we're very curious about how this space evolves as well. I think drop downs are here for a while still as well. But this was our take on trying to solve that security problem because we think that's where a lot of the concern lies as well.
00:41:48.610 - 00:42:16.840, Speaker B: Very cool. I kind of get, like, dial up internet vibes from a lot of the stuff we're talking about, where it's like we've got latency and drop down models and things might move kind of slow. But yeah. Submit to your point earlier feeling what it was like to go buy a crypto kitty a long time ago, versus what it's like to go do something with an NFT on optimism right now is like a wholly different experience.
00:42:19.630 - 00:42:20.380, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:42:21.950 - 00:42:46.740, Speaker B: Yeah. To dive into, I guess, a little bit of superchain stuff here. You were mentioning that it is like an opt in thing. What does opting into the superchain look like? Am I just shooting you a DM on Twitter? And I'm like, hey, we got this chain that we want to make, we want to be a part of. Like, what are some of those requirements and how might people get involved there?
00:42:47.510 - 00:43:36.498, Speaker A: That's a good question, and I want to say that it should be completely community led, but we're not there today. To opt into the superchain, you'll definitely have to put up a proposal to join the superchain. So Base is doing that, zoro is going to do that, and it's going to be entirely governance voted so that the community has a say in what is good for the superchain and what is maybe not great for the superchain yet, or give feedback where they need to get feedback. I can't get you into the superchain per se. That's not how this entire system works. But we're excited about Op chain creativity and hacking and all that kind of stuff. So if a team was ever interested in building an Op chain, we can definitely work with them very closely to help them understand what's going on right now.
00:43:36.498 - 00:44:26.660, Speaker A: I'm just very excited about this entire problem space. So every single person that comes my way, I try to have a conversation with them, ranging from some of the craziest ideas that would definitely not work yet to some of the most robust ideas based. We're excited about them all. And just between you and like, I feel like I'm very excited about the smaller developer. People think that we only care about the bases of the world or the source of the world, but I love working with teams like Lyra, like, very smaller DeFi teams that are trying to build a much larger future than what exists for them today. I'm very excited about that because that problem one is a very interesting one to solve. But it's also like the future that I see more and more these days.
00:44:26.660 - 00:44:50.430, Speaker A: App chains are a different model entirely than ecosystems, and hacks are a very different model too. People are settling on different DA layers. They're settling on the Op stack, but they're also using another stack. It's cool. Experimentation. I feel like the brightest idea has come out of experimentation. We had a hackathon, I think, a couple of weeks ago called SuperHack.
00:44:50.430 - 00:45:13.314, Speaker A: Very excited about that because a lot of teams came together. The base team, the world coin team. Throw a team. Everybody came together to host a hackathon to build next generation ideas for web3. And I feel like those things are only possible when everyone wants to come together and try to move the space forward. And a lot of hacks probably came out of that too. And we're excited about those.
00:45:13.314 - 00:45:22.020, Speaker A: So if anybody's interested, definitely get in touch. We have a superchain inbound form, happy to have any conversations with.
00:45:24.550 - 00:45:52.800, Speaker B: Gotcha and I guess something that popped up from that. If you are one of those smaller developers, obviously it's easier for Azora or a Base to come to the community and be like, hey guys, we have this big brand, tons of users. Here are the reasons you should let us be a part of this. Is there kind of a way to sort of ensure for the little guys that they have a similarly fair shot at that?
00:45:53.650 - 00:46:17.670, Speaker A: Yeah. I feel like a lot of people think that we are actively trying to close chains or we want everybody to build a chain. It's actually not the truth. When we talk to a team, it's a very honest conversation. There are trade offs, there are things that you gain off of building your own chain, of roll up. There are things that you lose as well. So we really want to walk the team through that before they make the leap.
00:46:17.670 - 00:46:52.986, Speaker A: So, like, a good example of that is you lose composability. Right now, if you launch your own chain, you're not going to get to access unisoft's liquidity on Op Mainet. You don't get all the tooling, you don't get all the Oracles RPCs. You're building an ecosystem from scratch, which is exciting, has amazing branding. You can customize it to the degree that you want to customize it, but it is a lot of work. And then on top of that, there is a price that comes for decentralization. So when you're launching your own chain and you're batching data back to Ethel One, it's expensive and we're getting to places where it's going to be a lot cheaper.
00:46:52.986 - 00:47:32.874, Speaker A: 4844 will reduce the costs quite a bit, but today I would say that a lot of app chains shouldn't or apps shouldn't make the jump to their own app chain just yet. They may want to wait for a very key upgrade. They may need a specific tool or infra layer to be on their chain on day one. And yeah, the little guys, I feel like some of them are very well thought out. They have amazing product specs, and they definitely should launch a chain. But the other ones are looking for information on, is this the right direction and path for them? And I enjoy that conversation a lot because we want what's best for the app. At the end of the day, it's also on us.
00:47:32.874 - 00:48:11.050, Speaker A: Like, if we decide to tell you to go down the chain route and it doesn't succeed, that looks bad on us. We're telling you to do the wrong thing. So we want to make sure these teams are successful and prepared on day one. I would say that there are a lot of things that we do to help out the little guys and the developers. And maybe the right path for them is build out an idea, try to prove PMF, see if it's the right direction to go, use all the tooling and all the stuff that comes for free out of an ecosystem like Op Munit or Base. And once you decide that this is exactly what you want to go down, maybe it's time to take the next step to go to your own roll up or your own chain. Different customizability.
00:48:11.050 - 00:48:14.490, Speaker A: So, yeah, we've been excited about that kind of conversation.
00:48:15.710 - 00:48:40.530, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah, I love how that all kind of builds on itself like that. I guess we're getting close to wrapping up here, but last couple of questions, would love to hear from both of you and starting with Spencer. What is kind of like the thing or a couple of the things you're most excited for from Uniswap, in this case, coming up on the horizon?
00:48:43.030 - 00:49:30.180, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm most excited about Uniswap X, which for those who don't know, is how do you describe it? I guess off chain RFQ based swapping system so you can get gasless swaps and get better prices. And there's been a lot of conversations and a lot of it's online. But to put it in one sentence, the future of liquidity and pricing and solving for cross chain liquidity fragmentation is Uniswap X. So I think that will be exciting and will require work from many different players in addition to just Uniswap. But I think that's interesting.
00:49:32.870 - 00:49:42.680, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah. Smith in the optimism is what is peeking over the horizon now that people can get excited about.
00:49:44.170 - 00:50:12.798, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely more chains. We're excited to launch newer types of ecosystems and bring a different set of use cases and developers into crypto, for sure. I would also say that I'm very excited about the newer ideas that are coming out fronttech was one, we're excited about social. We're excited about DeFi gaming. There's so many different verticals and domains that are all building at the same time. So you can really pick whatever you're interested in.
00:50:12.884 - 00:50:13.182, Speaker C: Right?
00:50:13.236 - 00:50:41.430, Speaker A: So if you don't like DeFi, well, there's so many more other things that you can be working on or looking at and trying out. So, yeah, definitely excited to see how all of these verticals evolve. Personally, I'm a huge DeFi nut, so I want to bring the entire global economy on chain. So definitely working towards that. So it's going to be a life mission and yeah, optimism. Specifically Op Mainet and whatnot. We're working on our own initiatives.
00:50:41.430 - 00:51:13.310, Speaker A: Right. So I would say that I personally, for Op Mainet, am very excited about the innovative ideas. We like to just try to bootstrap some crazy shit. The ideas that nobody thinks will work, but they have huge visions and dreams. And there's this phrase or wording that our head of Deborah always uses. She always wants to bootstrap like, the most dangerous ideas because a lot of cool things come out of that. And I would say I resonate with that entirely.
00:51:13.310 - 00:51:15.410, Speaker A: So let's go towards danger.
00:51:16.950 - 00:52:00.500, Speaker B: Love that description. I might have to tweet something like that. Also, I liked what you said in there. I was just talking to someone today about how many different parts of crypto there are because it applies to all these different industries or niches or things in the real world, like the crossovers between crypto and gaming or crypto and finance, et cetera, et cetera, forever. And that there was a time a few years ago where you could kind of have a generalist handle on everything that is going on. But yeah, there is constantly just so much cool stuff being built that it can be tough to really keep track of everything these days.
00:52:01.670 - 00:52:38.480, Speaker A: I agree. I feel like crypto at one point was just DeFi and people only thought of it as a way to participate in Djen activity. And it's taken such a turn in the last couple of years, in my opinion. I wouldn't have ever imagined interacting with social media on chain. It's a very cool place that we're getting to and you really need that if you want to accommodate for many, many different types of users. Not all of them are going to be interested in DeFi or not all of them will be interested in NFTs. So, yeah, innovation is crazy right now.
00:52:41.410 - 00:52:52.580, Speaker B: Yeah, just on the side of sort of like the innovation in UX we've had as well. I could imagine trying to do Web Three social in 2019 and with.
00:52:54.470 - 00:52:54.882, Speaker A: Being.
00:52:54.936 - 00:53:14.540, Speaker B: On L One then and dealing with whatever wallets we would have that would have felt so impossible. And now you could look at something like a lens or a Farcaster and kind of be like, oh, I can kind of see how this could scale to something much bigger than it is.
00:53:15.470 - 00:53:16.220, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:53:18.350 - 00:53:19.100, Speaker C: Cool.
00:53:19.470 - 00:53:41.860, Speaker B: And just to finish off. On an interesting note, Smith, you mentioned public goods funding, retro public goods funding in different parts of this talk a little bit, but yeah, could you just dive into that real quick for all the people and kind of just say how it relates to optimism and what it is in general?
00:53:43.030 - 00:54:27.246, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So public goods funding, it's essentially a way I'm sure the audience knows a bit about Gitcoin and how they've been doing a lot for the space and public goods in general as well. But for us, we needed to figure out a way to sustainably fund public goods for Web Three and the world. This is like an incentives problem, in my opinion. There is not a great solution towards that incentives problem. We talked about it a little bit earlier, but open source software is very difficult to sustain and make forever, and we wanted to help solve that problem. This is a near and dear problem because the entire founding group used to work on plasma.
00:54:27.246 - 00:55:40.802, Speaker A: They were a nonprofit that was working on plasma and that's something that they couldn't sustain either. Even Ethereum is technically very difficult to maintain unless you come up with smart mechanisms to maintain it. So we came out with our version of funding public goods, which is I wouldn't even say we came out with it, but this is something that we've been really incentivized to help build the path for. It's this thing called Rpgf retroactive public goods and the way it's best described, I'm going to completely butcher it, but I'm going to try my best because I don't work at the foundation and they focus on this a lot more than me. But yeah, you want to figure out a way to fund these things while aligning incentives and retroactively doing it after people have already contributed to the ecosystem and the success of Web Three. That's a very good way to reward good behavior. So retroactively giving more and more rewards to people that are doing the right things is a great way to incentivize the right behaviors, the right mental, rather than paying for things to get done as if it's a contract.
00:55:40.802 - 00:56:16.910, Speaker A: So we've done several rounds already. We gave out 10 million Op in our last round. We have a 30 million Op round coming, I believe, really soon, in the next month. But yeah, please go check it out. A lot of different applications and different categories are there. We've funded anything ranging from the Ethereum client teams building like Nethermind and those kind of things all the way to data public goods like DeFi, llama and bridges, and even content people that are putting in the time to create really good content for this space that's a public good. People need to be educated.
00:56:16.910 - 00:56:39.980, Speaker A: So we're very excited to continue to bootstrap this flywheel, make sure that people are incentivized to continue researching, doing better things, without having the need to worry about where are they going to get their next paycheck? Or where are they going to figure out a way to sustain this model when they just want to build an idea that's really grand? They should be enabled. So that's our model.
00:56:41.230 - 00:56:51.760, Speaker B: Super interesting. Thank you for that explanation, Spencer. I'm going to wrap this up in a few seconds. Is there anything else, questions you want to ask? Things you want to talk about?
00:56:53.250 - 00:56:56.180, Speaker C: No good on my end, I think. Touched on a lot of cool.
00:56:57.510 - 00:57:00.580, Speaker B: Amazing. Smith, anything from your side?
00:57:01.910 - 00:57:32.750, Speaker A: Yeah, no, not too much. I just want to say thank you guys. We're super excited about uniswap wallet and just in general, like uniswap continuing to be a aligned steward of this space. I would say that there are a lot of teams in crypto now, but uniswap has been there since the beginning and it's good to see that. We've come from Unipig all the way to uniswap being on many, many different networks and optimistic rollups and roll ups in general. And it's been very exciting to see your growth.
00:57:34.050 - 00:58:16.680, Speaker B: Yeah. As the people would say, we are in the arena figuring this out together right now. Awesome. Well, to wrap things up, just so everyone actually knows about this too, we are doing a quest on layer three with optimism right now inside of the uniswap wallet. If you go to either of our twitters, you can find it posted in the last day or so and if you complete it by next Tuesday, September 5, at 12:00 a.m. UTC, you will be on the allow list for an optimism NFT by uniswap that will be launching on zora in the next week. Thank you both for taking the time to come on to this.
00:58:16.680 - 00:58:24.000, Speaker B: Super excited for all the stuff we're going to do together in the future. You and yeah, that's wrapping it up.
00:58:24.930 - 00:58:26.880, Speaker A: Cool. Thank you, guys.
00:58:27.410 - 00:58:27.982, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:58:28.036 - 00:58:29.770, Speaker A: Take care. Bye.
