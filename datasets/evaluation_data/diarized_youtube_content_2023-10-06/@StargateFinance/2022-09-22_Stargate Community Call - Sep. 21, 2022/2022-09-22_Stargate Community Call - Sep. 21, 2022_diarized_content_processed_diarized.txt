00:00:01.920 - 00:00:34.534, Speaker A: Welcome to the Stargate Finance community call, where we discuss proposals and ideas that will help shape and govern the Stargate protocol. Feel free to join the conversation on stage anytime you have a question by clicking on the raise hand button at the bottom of the screen. You can also chime in through the voice text channel in Discord or any of the chats for those listening in through YouTube and Twitch as these channels all aggregate the messages together. So just a reminder, this is not financial, accounting or legal advice. Please do your own research. All right. One cool thing that we dropped yesterday.
00:00:34.534 - 00:01:12.454, Speaker A: Yeah. Galaxy and optimism Quest. So seeing a bit of traction behind that, if you haven't seen that already, that's you can head over to app optimism IO quests. So very similar, kind of like the Arbitrum Odyssey kind of quest optimism doing something very similar through Galaxy, which used to be a project galaxy. Yeah. And basically there's a few other protocols that are also performing quests as well. Alongside with this, I think there's twelve in total, maybe.
00:01:12.454 - 00:01:51.172, Speaker A: Yeah. Stargate being. It's kind of nice because it's listed first on the page there when you go over to optimism. And I think just looking this morning, there's over 3000 people who have already completed the quest. So there's a do a little quiz and then the other part of the quest is bridging $100 or 100 USDC to or from optimism. So yeah, I'm glad to see that there's like a lot of engagement around it, that people are excited about it. Yeah, there is like a little bit of a wait period just because Galaxy has to update on their side.
00:01:51.172 - 00:02:29.114, Speaker A: They have to update the list of contributors or something like this. Yeah, just the way it worked out here for this quest. So if you have done it and you're still like wondering where you're, why you aren't able to claim, just wait, give it an hour or two and it should be refreshed and updated. And I've seen a lot of people in the chats, you know, they come back and they're able to get it. So should be all good. And, yeah, and then they, you know, go and claim the Stargator onft as well. So once you have your, once you have that galaxy credential.
00:02:29.114 - 00:03:04.804, Speaker A: I can't remember. Yeah, I think, yeah, you need to have the credential and have the bridging completed and then you'll be able to go claim that. So you can head over to the website is in the announcement. Let me grab that. Or if anybody knows, actually, I could just try and copy past all those links into. Yeah, so there's actually. Can anybody beat me to it to try and drop those links in? See here, copy.
00:03:04.804 - 00:03:36.332, Speaker A: Drop all that stuff in there for, for everyone here in a second. It's from the announcements in, in discord, but we can put that up in voice, text channel this way here. It goes across all the. There. Cool. So, yeah, you can hit up any of those links there for where the campaign is taking place and happening. So, yeah, hopefully everybody's done that.
00:03:36.332 - 00:04:19.586, Speaker A: And yes, let us know any, any thoughts on that or any issues or anything. But, yeah, should be all good at this point. And then last week we had the, we had a couple of proposals that had passed as well. The first one, sip 15, was for deploying an Arrakis vault for the uni v three position for Stargate USD pool that has passed with. Yeah, with a 50%. Yeah, sorry. For 50% of the capital or like the TVL on optimism to get put into an Arrakis vault.
00:04:19.586 - 00:04:22.014, Speaker A: So there was a couple different tiers and.
00:04:22.474 - 00:04:26.898, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe you can just chime in here, Tango, if you don't mind.
00:04:26.946 - 00:04:27.730, Speaker A: That would be great.
00:04:27.842 - 00:05:19.138, Speaker B: So for our case, basically, like, what we're going to be doing, the ranges that won was 50%. So 50% of the Pol that is on Wu tumism or optimism will be basically moving to Ericus where we will have a tighter range, meaning liquidity will be, well, like more efficient. In general, what we're looking at right now is basically like the auction price -50% and basically like one to 125 for the range. Of course, like this will be adjust as price goes up or down. Hopefully. We also gonna this deploy the remaining 50% on Beethoven X to act as, you know, like just casual arbitrage and also dampen if there's any issues with Aricus. So that is the plan.
00:05:19.138 - 00:05:50.646, Speaker B: On optimism, we will also, at the same time do so. We need to do a proposal for this. We also going to do a proposal for the main Pl on Ethereum. So the 50 million on curve 50% will probably. We're exploring, you know, nothing is set in stone at the moment, but we're exploring moving it 50% to bind. Sir, what is triggering this decision? Or, you know, kind of. This thinking is mainly regarding the swapping fees, which are quite minimal on curve.
00:05:50.646 - 00:06:26.334, Speaker B: We're going to be able to three x basically like the swap fees to 1% on balancer while, you know, like starting to. We were also kind of exploring and kind of observing what was happening with the bribing on curve and so on. What I found out is basically like the main whales on convex were basically like dumping Stargate. There was absolutely no kind of staking and so on. I don't think this is rightfully aligned. So, you know, we're kind of exploring ways to mitigate this. The current, you know, if we were to be successful, the proposal and so on, 50% would stay on curb.
00:06:26.334 - 00:07:06.936, Speaker B: We still have almost over 700,000 curve deployed over there. We have basically a pretty nice loop happening. But personally, I think it would be more meaningful and more efficient for Stargate to basically separate part of the pol. People can still use aggregator and basically get the best price while basically the pol earning top amount of apy and so on. So if anyone has any question like, happy to answer also on this front, but that would be, I guess, what is happening on the front of pol. Incensation bribes. So this will mitigate cell pressure.
00:07:06.936 - 00:07:25.104, Speaker B: We will be able to basically alve the amount of bribes per two weeks going from 50,000 ish to 25,000. So that should in theory help out. So yeah, that's kind of a little overall overview of what is happening on this front.
00:07:25.444 - 00:07:40.404, Speaker A: Excellent, excellent. So yeah, thanks for all the stuff on the bribes and whatnot. And then you say as far as the Arrakis pool, that just some next steps with that, like that should be set up. I don't know how it should be.
00:07:40.444 - 00:07:59.304, Speaker B: Done by end of this week per se. The pool is already being. So the pool is being created today. We're gonna have to do like some multisig kind of magic. And then afterwards, like, it should be up and running. We will announce when this is up and when this is ready, basically.
00:07:59.644 - 00:08:16.124, Speaker A: Yeah. Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. And I think, I can't remember what I looked at last time. It was like maybe six or 700,000 was the total amount on TVL on optimism, but yeah. So 50% of that.
00:08:16.124 - 00:08:30.380, Speaker A: So that's like 350. And then that's squashed into a uni v three position. That should. I mean, that's still pretty. Going to be quite liquid or like actually provide better. Yeah, quite a bit better slippage and liquidity in that sense. Yep.
00:08:30.452 - 00:08:31.468, Speaker B: Yep, indeed.
00:08:31.596 - 00:08:54.974, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So any questions on that, please let us know. Drop us in into the text questions or raise your hand. We can get you up here if you have further questions on it, but yeah. And then the other proposal that we had that came through was the additional assets.
00:08:54.974 - 00:09:20.824, Speaker A: So adding dye, Frax, S, USD and LUsd as transferable pairs. All of those staying isolated or I guess contained within their own. Within their own pair or not pair, I guess, but their own pools. So you wouldn't be able to go from like, die to fracs. It would have to be die to die across networks. So we. That way.
00:09:20.824 - 00:09:55.844, Speaker A: Yeah, they're all contained. Yeah. And I look back up, look back at the proposal here, but I think it was, you know, there will be some incentivization in order to just get those pools kind of bootstrapped and put it on for a small time period and then do an analysis, see how that goes. But I think, you know, more assets, the better. And, yeah, hopefully, you know, this can be. Shouldn't take too long to get set up, but yeah, a little bit of development work to do all that. Some front end stuff.
00:09:55.844 - 00:10:20.578, Speaker A: Just wiring all that stuff up, but. Ray J, what have you got for us here? Drops them. I am not up to speed on the latest stablecoin regulation on all that. We'll have to, I think.
00:10:20.626 - 00:11:33.034, Speaker B: So what I understood very briefly, and, you know, that's without any legal advice, or else, basically, any new algorithmic stablecoin could be in, you know, will be, quote unquote ban or in trouble in the US, but anything that is over collateralized. So something like that, hell, USD would be okay. The problem, in my opinion, is when things are quite blurry, like fracs, where, you know, they can mint out of thin air, potentially, but also kind of be criterized by USDC, I don't know how this is going to play out for them, but in theory, if they are a stable coin that is not pegged to the USD, they should be fine. From what I kind of saw briefly anyways, we're going to probably have more, you know, traders and basically analysts kind of give us like, the right picture over the next few days while this kind of evolve, but basically, like, it's targeted over, you know, Luna Terra and so on, ust things like that, rather than, you know, your run of the mill kind of, I don't know, Daigo, etcetera.
00:11:33.654 - 00:12:03.668, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, I'll have to do a little more research on all that sort of thing, but. Yeah, yeah, thank you, Ray J, for popping that in here. But, yeah, as far as, like, Zulian mentioned here that the top three stables believes they're fine, but, yeah, please, everybody do your own research on all this sort of thing. But two year grace period, and most things don't go into effect for another year. Okay. Yeah.
00:12:03.668 - 00:12:23.248, Speaker A: So I don't know, that's all kind of, you know, stuff that's outside of. Yeah, yeah. That's us regulation stuff. So we'll just stay tuned to see what more and more comes out with that. Yeah. But as far as those. Yeah.
00:12:23.248 - 00:12:36.294, Speaker A: Diffracts USD, L USD. Yeah. Obviously being able to hopefully drive more attraction and interest to Stargate. Yeah. Just more options for.
00:12:36.994 - 00:13:53.278, Speaker B: And by the way, like, I might as well kind of chime in here, tango with kind of these new assets kind of being added to Stargate. This kind of open up like a gate, I guess, or kind of a new universe for us to dip into rather than just like focus on, you know, like the big USDC, USDT and so on. You could potentially start seeing also like governance token appearing on Stargate potentially. As you may know, you know, we had like a, quite a successful integration with sushi. They are already actually have deployed strategies on bento box to leverage Stargate. Meaning that, you know, any reserve of sushi like, you know, wrapped bitcoin sushi token itself or other governance token being provided on, you know, the Amm on Fuoro, on cashie, etcetera, will be able to be deposited in Stargate to earn additional yield while also being productive. So this is extremely, you know, interesting because then, you know, that means protocols similar to, you know, other, other bands or curve or else could in theory deposit their asset in Stargate to make sure they are like, you know, transferable everywhere.
00:13:53.278 - 00:15:06.374, Speaker B: And what is in my opinion, like the most interesting or powerful thing is target older potentially could potentially enable meta governance on these assets. So while they're sitting in the pools and being used to transfer value from, you know, arbitrum to mainnet to polygon and so on, well, they could also be used to vote on proposal or earn potentially depending on, you know, like the way they work and so on. I'm pretty sure this could, this could be happening that also expose kind of target order to potential, you know, other value accrual mechanism. If there was like airdrop source and so on, that is something basically like the DAO would need to also potentially look onto at some point and, you know, the way we would distribute or, you know, you know, capitalize on this, should this go on pol, should this stay there, etc. Etcetera. So anyway, some just more use cases, more, more utility in general for Stargate is always better in my opinion. And you know, whenever like you have a, you know, governance token you want to transfer across all these chains, well, Stargate will potentially be the more liquid one in the future.
00:15:06.374 - 00:15:15.554, Speaker B: So you can expect proposal on governance on various governance forum. You can also expect more integration with all these kind of tiers.
00:15:15.634 - 00:15:27.802, Speaker A: So, yeah, that's a very interesting idea. You know, being able to branch out into other protocols to have them bring the liquidity that's just sitting there, whether it's from the treasury.
00:15:27.858 - 00:15:57.176, Speaker B: Exactly. I mean, the amount of, if you go on open dot in fo, I think at the moment, the amount of protocol that own like, you know, over 50 to 100 million with token governance token that are sitting idle doing absolutely nothing while, you know, like, basically like people have trouble transferring across all these chains or, you know, I've basically like, are not even on money markets or else this could be possible now with, you know, adding biscuits target to the playbook of how a treasury should be.
00:15:57.200 - 00:16:41.424, Speaker A: Well managed playbook management. There you go. Yeah, that seems like a really positive, positive thing that could come out and, yeah, just allowing more tokens to have that better liquidity through other networks and, you know, through a safe, secure mechanism. I think that's, that seems like a very big win. So, yeah, yeah, we'll keep an eye out and keep looking for that as proposals and whatnot kind of come out because it really makes more sense to do something like that. All right. Yeah, that's kind of like all we've got here for today.
00:16:41.424 - 00:17:23.238, Speaker A: Yeah, lots of cool things to be coming up here with more assets like we were mentioning and some potential other ideas here for that Maki's been sharing with us. And yeah, I don't know if anyone else has comments or anything. Oh, traditional wind Solana question. Soon TM. Soon TM. I don't know the exact dates on this, but it is like, obviously getting tighter and tighter here. You know, we've mentioned Aptosui and Solana all being the next things here, so I would, I would hope October, but I don't have definitive timelines on that and I don't want to be helped anything.
00:17:23.238 - 00:17:40.794, Speaker A: So, yeah, that's, that's what I've got for you. October it is. Geez. Great, great stuff. Okay, well, if. I don't know if any. If anyone else has final comments.
00:17:40.794 - 00:18:12.088, Speaker A: Yeah, if anything else, please bring it in through discord in the text questions voice text channel. And I do see, thank you, somebody from YouTube that's chiming in. Great to see that, some comments coming in that way. So thank you. Yeah, I think we're over at Twitch as well. But yeah, if nothing else here, probably a great place to wrap up. But yeah, thanks, everybody, for coming out today for this.
00:18:12.088 - 00:18:36.554, Speaker A: And yeah, you'll be able to follow up on this on YouTube. This will be up shortly. Hereafter, if you are on YouTube listening away, whether you're live or following up on this, please like and subscribe. And yes, stay in tune with everything that's going on here. Oh, here's a question from Prince Agra. Here is just before we were wrapping up here. I enjoy using this tech.
00:18:36.554 - 00:19:31.966, Speaker A: I think it's dope. How our plans to expand utility to partners, Dexs and other product protocols. Well, I mean, we just talked about a few things here with, with more. With adding more assets in and of course, you know, other Dexs and things like that, I'm sure as more and more people are seeing, like, what's happened with sushi Xswap, that will have more interesting. And I think, like, there's some, there's likely some things in the works and brewing with, with all of this. So yeah, obviously stay tuned with that. But definitely, yeah, definitely, like all stuff on the radar here and yeah, as we were talking about here with utility and whatnot earlier on, having that in, even something as simple as like, you know, sushi, putting it in, into the bento box to being able to, like, have a strategy against it.
00:19:31.966 - 00:19:53.908, Speaker A: So, so able to generate some yield that way. So, yeah, obviously that is more and more of that stuff's going to come out here. Further integrations, further people utilizing Stargate. Yeah, it's only going to keep expanding and continuing. So hopefully that helps you there. Prince Agra and. Yeah, okay.
00:19:53.908 - 00:20:18.558, Speaker A: I don't know where it was here as I was wrapping up as that question came in, but yeah, like. And subscribe on YouTube and yeah, and then on, if you're over on Twitter. Thanks for joining us over there. Hopefully the sound quality is all right. And yeah, if you ever wanted, you can always hop over into discord if there's any. If you wanted to interact there as well. But hopefully that went for you.
00:20:18.558 - 00:20:21.302, Speaker A: And, yeah, other than that, we'll see.
00:20:21.398 - 00:20:45.286, Speaker B: Maybe, maybe just. I think we had confirmation that most of the dev team will be at Devcon this year. By the way, I don't know if this has been announced yet. So I just had the confirmation a few days ago. So anyways, we will potentially have, I don't know if there's going to be events or things organized, but we know we will keep the community in touch and hopefully I can meet some people over there. All right.
00:20:45.350 - 00:20:59.710, Speaker A: Oh, so, alrighty, everyone. There you have it. Thanks a lot for joining us this week. We'll see you in two weeks from now. Same. Yes, same channels. Wherever you'd like to find us, across Discord, Twitter, YouTube or Twitch.
00:20:59.710 - 00:21:22.942, Speaker A: We are trying to get to you absolutely everywhere. Thanks again. And go complete that quest, if you haven't already. Over on app optimism. IO quest. I think that was what it was, right? Yeah. All right, talk to you all later.
00:21:22.942 - 00:21:23.614, Speaker A: Ciao. Ciao.
