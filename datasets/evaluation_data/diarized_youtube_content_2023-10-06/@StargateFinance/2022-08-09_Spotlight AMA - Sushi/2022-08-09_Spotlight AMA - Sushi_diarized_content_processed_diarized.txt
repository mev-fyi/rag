00:00:03.560 - 00:00:21.954, Speaker A: Welcome to the Stargate spotlight Ama. We chat with projects that have integrated with Stargate and take a deeper look into development behind it. Today, we are joined with the development team from sushi, where we'll take a look into sushi and its latest integration, sushi Xswap. Welcome, sarong and Primo. Thanks for being here as well. How's things going today?
00:00:25.834 - 00:00:31.774, Speaker B: All good on my end. Exciting to be spending the morning with such a king like sarong.
00:00:34.594 - 00:00:39.802, Speaker C: I think I should. I should say the same for you, actually. But, yeah, it's going good so far.
00:00:39.938 - 00:00:47.298, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. It's wonderful to hear that. Yeah. We're such as spoken so highly in regard there, Sarong. So well done.
00:00:47.298 - 00:00:58.004, Speaker A: Well done. You know, maybe you just start things off here. Maybe just give. Give yourself a little intro about who you are, some background, and, you know, what you're working on at sushi.
00:00:59.744 - 00:01:17.104, Speaker C: Yeah. So, hey, everyone, I'm Sarang, and I work at Sushiswap at the solidity site and the smart contracts. So I take care of everything that involves smart contracts and, you know, like, evms. So, yeah, that's. That's pretty much what I do.
00:01:17.264 - 00:01:26.444, Speaker A: Yeah. Nice. And what. What did you get into? Or how did you get into sushi? Or how did you get involved with a bit of crypto and how did you fall down this rabbit hole?
00:01:28.104 - 00:01:51.946, Speaker C: Sushi is, like, technically, like, my first job out of the college. So I was studying in the college, and I participated in a hackathon where Sushi spotted and recruited me. Actually, I was getting going for a grant for Uniswap, and that's why sushi kind of hijacked and took me. And, yeah, it's been pretty good since then. So, yeah, I've been with sushi for, like, 1.4 to 1.5 years now.
00:01:52.120 - 00:02:12.954, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So you've kind of got vampire attacked as well. Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. So I guess, like, most people are super familiar with sushi as, like, a Dex, but what are some of the other products in sushi that some of the people may not be as familiar with?
00:02:13.934 - 00:03:10.350, Speaker C: Oh, sushi basically has a lot of product now, like, we call it as, you know, going towards the actual a defi powerhouse. Currently, we have a lending Boeing protocol launchpad where, you know, you can launch your own tokens. We have a Dow management product for streaming investing tokens. We obviously have a bunch of, you know, like, cross chain products that we are now starting up, like, you know, and first out of that series is, like, sushi X swaps, which is, you know, kind of like this, but like, built upon it. So we have, you know, like all these tools that we have already built is kind of, you know, crossing each other and, you know, building new products by mixing all of those. And at the heart of it, we have Bento box, which is our token world. So any product that sushi builds from now on will be built upon Bento box, which will allow sushi to have most capital efficient steps without, you know, adding extra complexity to our tech layer.
00:03:10.542 - 00:03:39.954, Speaker A: Yeah, and that's kind of a key feature here that I don't think that a lot of people really understand, like, what the Bento box is. And you kind of mentioned it here where you can build on top of it and whatnot. So essentially, it's kind of like, as you say, a gas efficient vault. But how can people can actually be putting their, like their assets are there and they're actually getting utilized and there's like, you know, cheaper gas and everything for them to use within. Within the sushi app. Is that kind of a good way of putting it?
00:03:40.934 - 00:04:09.652, Speaker C: Yeah. Plus the advantage, it's like, you know, it's like a savings account, you know. So whenever you put any money in an app built upon Bento box, the underlying capital goes into strategies which earns you yields. So just like in banks, right? Like when you put your money in the bank, you can use it elsewhere, but the money in the bank also earn yield, at least from where. From. I am, I'm from India, so we are. We have always enjoyed like five to 6% of yield on our bank accounts.
00:04:09.652 - 00:04:40.350, Speaker C: Probably that not might be like, you know, that might be height for some countries, but it has been normal for us before even defi. So I'm kind of, you know, very accustomed to that infrastructure where you build apps on directly on top of banking infrastructure. And then banks use those capital to deploy in different kind of strategies such as, you know, giving out loans, mutual funds, index funds. And the user gets benefit out of it because they get the benefit of using the app plus the underlying amount which is in the bank accounts.
00:04:40.482 - 00:04:55.954, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, cool, cool, cool. Yeah, so I guess, like, as sushi has been one of the first innovators to be on several different networks, you know, what features about Stargate made this seem like it was going to be a great fit?
00:04:57.414 - 00:05:30.648, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, like, first one of the, to start off with, it was like the number of chains target was on, which was very good. Like it was on seven chains, which was half of sushi was actually deployed. Right. And they were covering all the good chains that we wanted. Not saying that the other chains are not good, but the chains which had significant volume for sushi. So starting from arbitrum, we were like, we are at like top three or top four in arbitrum, ethereum optimism, where we had recently launched Trident, which is a, you know, next generation of Amm powered by Bentobox Polygon.
00:05:30.648 - 00:06:34.814, Speaker C: And even our analytics reflect, you know, that the networks that sushi is popular on, we have significantly got higher cross chain traffic there. The other thing that, you know, we wanted to have is a support of bridging call. So we do have seen other cross chain swaps before, but what they lack is like a good user experience. Right? So let's say you have a cross chain swap, either wait on the UI for a bit to do the second one, or use a gelato, or, you know, like a chain link keeper to, you know, kind of do the transaction on the destination, which is not the most secure and the optimal way. But with Stargate and layer zero combined, we got a way to do it in a fashion that is much more user friendly, where user just thinks that he's doing like a one swap and he actually does, where the other swap is taken care by the data that we pass inside the payload and the swap happens and the user receives the token that they want on the other chain and everything is like, seamless because the user just clicks that ugly metamask pop up once.
00:06:35.434 - 00:07:07.184, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. That's great to hear. Yeah, like, the experience for the user, experience is pretty crucial because that's where most people are dealing or seeing how this operates, rather than what's going on under the hood, per se. But, yeah, that's so far I've been pretty pleased with it. I guess this one kind of goes out to primo here, but with the cross chain swap was obviously something that you had prototyped and demoed a long time ago. How does this current implementation look in comparison to the early ideas you had around all this?
00:07:11.644 - 00:08:00.132, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think, again, this was one of, like, the very earliest things. I think it was the first thing we wrote about in the white paper back well over a year ago when we were first writing it. And then this was the kind of initial demo that we released, think really, like, made it more viscerally real for most people. So obviously, I've been super excited about this use case forever. I think this is kind of exactly what we were envisioning when we first did. It is the way to sort of solve for a bunch of these broad problems like general terrible UX between these change, like users who are trying to do things across ecosystems especially, that was way more abundant. Right, go back, rewind six months ago or twelve months ago and everybody was just spending all their time jumping between chains.
00:08:00.132 - 00:08:15.144, Speaker B: These pain points were like very, very, very front of mind that will sort of wax and wane how much that movement happens. But I think the difference of the next time that that's happening in UX is going to be night and day. So, no. Super excited.
00:08:15.644 - 00:08:43.240, Speaker A: Yeah, wicked. Wicked. Yeah, the whole ux thing is pretty fantastic. And of course, even just on the sushi side, like, I absolutely love the UI as well with it. It's super clean. And yeah, that experience of going between networks with whatever asset that we have on sushi is pretty sweet. The other thing too is you're actually dealing with the liquidity of sushi.
00:08:43.240 - 00:09:20.784, Speaker A: So that's one other thing that I really like is rather than having to batch all the liquidity together into one kind of, into one protocol or one system working, like, leverage, leverage the liquidity from, from both sides. So, yeah, and I think that was kind of what you're alluding to there as well. Sarong with like how. Yeah, yeah, just with like being on different networks and the ones that were actually supportive and. And had lots of liquidity and lots of volume across. So. Yeah, yeah.
00:09:20.784 - 00:09:37.324, Speaker A: So once you started building out sushi x swaps wrong, how did you find the development process with going, you know, building on top of Stargate and even on layer zero as well? How did that, how did you feel about that on the development side? And, yeah, just like, what was that experience like for you?
00:09:38.264 - 00:10:19.344, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it was pretty good. So we actually did not start at the first. We started with transferring funds inside bento box from one bento box in one chain to another bento box in another chain. Obviously that's not possible with x swap as well. But before that, I had this personal issue with sushi that it's very difficult to commute between different vendor box across all these chains. I personally wanted a solution and that's when I first started to play around with Stargate and their zero. And like, from day one, like, I was like, I think it was like just 1020 minutes from reading the docs I could get a contract which was able to do this.
00:10:19.344 - 00:11:11.438, Speaker C: So it was like pretty good experience. And since then, like, there were like some other complexities when you deal with swaps that we had to handle on our end, but was target because they had this router which makes it very easy for us to integrate where, you know, we just send the required data and the payload that we want the target or the lazier to execute on destination chain and they take care of everything. What's also good is like, you know, generally in this case it becomes complex of how do we calculate fee and, you know, like different kind of mechanism that goes into the place and target had, you know, like direct contract calls for like, fees and, you know, different types of like, like how much source gas fee that we would pay. So it became easy at the integration side on the front end as well to just do a call, get all that and just passing the contracts and it just take care of it. Yeah, it was purely a bliss to kind of, you know, develop on top of it.
00:11:11.566 - 00:12:02.028, Speaker A: Yeah, that's great to hear because like, yeah, we don't always take that into consideration of like, the gas costs that things have to go across chain. And like, what, you know, paying for that upfront as well was like one of the cool features that is nice rather than having to like have source gas and everything on the other chain. So, yeah, I really like that aspect of, of what's going on here with Stargate and being able to wrap that all together here into the sushi Ui and Ux is pretty sweet. And again, if there's any questions that people have, please bring them up through. There's the AMA text questions and it's obviously aggregating through discord and YouTube and everything here. So if you do have questions, feel free to do that. And if you are in Twitter spaces, do feel free to raise your hand or ask to speak if you've got questions.
00:12:02.028 - 00:12:28.894, Speaker A: And we should be able to get you in over there. But if we see anything coming from text here, I'll be happy to read it out and we can ask Sarong or primo to answer for you. But yeah, again, with back to the sushi side of things. As sushis has a wide amount of products, what other possibilities do you see? Or they could be built upon through Stargate and layer zero if there's some other things that this could unlock for sushi.
00:12:29.054 - 00:12:48.550, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, we have already started doing that. So as we transition she 2.0 Ui. So the current x swap are in the Sushi 2.0 UI, right, where you would see like a different version of swapper. And, you know, you, you get an option to select chains and stuff like that. So we are moving that entire stack of me.
00:12:48.550 - 00:13:11.660, Speaker C: So Kashi limit orders and everything from the Sushi 1.0 UI to Sushi 2.0 Ui. Sushi 2.0 UI is a bit special because it's going to change how people develop apps. So it's, it's going to have like a multi chain view first. So what I'm, what do I mean by that is like when you go on Kashi, which is a lending and boring protocol, you see that, you know, like, let's say you are on Ethereum.
00:13:11.660 - 00:13:44.462, Speaker C: You, you see all the markets from Ethereum, you know, where you can provide your capital to. You switch to Polygon, you switch to optimism, arbitrary, you know, like, look at different markets and you know, where you can provide. In the multi chain UI, you would see all those chains markets on, like, on like a single page, right? So for you, when you open, like, say, Sushi.com lend, you would see all the markets across all the chains. Sushi is deployed on, at a single page. And you can just, you know, like sort APR. Let's say you are on Ethereum right now.
00:13:44.462 - 00:14:22.674, Speaker C: You have your funds on Ethereum and you sort, sort the APR. And the highest aPR for like, say, USDC is on arbitram, right? So what would sushi, why enable you to do is with sushi, XWAp is you can click that and you can like, select from which chain you want your funds to be used. And that's it. And you just click on Invest. It would automatically go bridge the funds, invest inside a cache. The same way is going to happen when you're going to LP. So it's going to allow you to transfer your LP position from one chain to another LP into pools from one chain to another, from like one chain to a different chain.
00:14:22.674 - 00:15:12.416, Speaker C: To start with, we're going to allow like, you know, one single chain. But going forward in the future, you can do it in a batch operation where you have like, if your funds are distributed in multiple chains, you can select all that fund and what amount and even in different tokens. So let's say if you want to LP with LP into a USDC market, but you have ETH, right? Because we have Sushi X, or it automatically converts everything and directly puts in the capital. So you just have to select the asset, the amount that the chain that you want the capital to come from, and that's it. You click on invest and that's, that's gonna happen on all the sushi products. So let's say for Furo, right, which is a streaming investing protocol right now I have to take my salary. I can only take it on like, say, ethereum, right? But going forward, if I want it on optimism with one click, it basically takes out my salary and bridges it to optimism.
00:15:12.416 - 00:16:05.924, Speaker C: Yes. Target, and then I get my money and that too. I can swap in between as well to any other token I want. So the entire experience is kind of coming to a one click approach where people are, you know, directly where the apps have directly integrated with this bridging infrastructure and people don't actually see that. So in fact, to give you an example, right, we are seeing a lot of swaps which are just USDC based. Right? Let's say, let's say USDC, USDC on like both sides, which is crucial to us because people are coming to IUI just to do the USDC as well, which, you know, they could have gone to other bridge uis to do it, but because they're finding it, because they are at sushi and they're finding it easy to do from that, it basically, you know, makes sense to activate this on all our products and, you know, make this multi chain UI to all, you know, like what we call a sushi 2.0 de facto way of how apps would function in the future.
00:16:06.424 - 00:16:26.642, Speaker A: Yeah, that is super cool to hear that the, like, the user experience is not even going to. You don't even have to move across, you're just going to be able to offer it right from. Right from the UI. Just being able to like get over to another. Another yield opportunity or. Yeah, be able to LP, like you were saying, just like making it so easy. That's.
00:16:26.642 - 00:16:29.826, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:16:29.890 - 00:17:04.878, Speaker C: We're also planning to kind of like make it like gasless in a way that, you know, if your funds are in like say, Bento, you could technically, or if you have, let's say, approved bento box. Right. You could basically bridge with not even having a source token. So you probably do not need the source or not the destination token. But, you know, like this is still in works and we are testing it out, but we probably might roll out after the sushi 2.0 that you neither have to have source destination and you can have like, you know, a complete flow of transferring funds without having anything.
00:17:05.046 - 00:17:12.196, Speaker A: So you're saying, yeah, not having to use have like native gas or destinations.
00:17:12.300 - 00:17:13.864, Speaker C: But also supporting cross.
00:17:14.444 - 00:17:14.828, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:14.876 - 00:17:30.036, Speaker B: So it's like, imagine a wallet where you only have USDC in the wallet. You don't need to think about gas. First of all. Love that idea. I've thought about this a bunch, so I think it's super, super cool to see something do like. We've had tons of internal discussions on this. Also, I just want to say I'm going to, I'm going to keep in the background here.
00:17:30.036 - 00:17:39.504, Speaker B: I've basically just been being Sarong's intern here and just taking notes on Twitter. So I'll let him keep dropping Alpha and I'm just tweeting it all out. So that was epic.
00:17:41.174 - 00:17:56.814, Speaker A: Yeah. Amazing. Amazing. Strong. Yeah. And just like super cool to hear like you were saying here just with this gasless aspect and being able to have like access opportunities or access other networks right. From your own network.
00:17:56.814 - 00:18:04.954, Speaker A: So you almost have to. You're not worried about where you are essentially in. On what network you're on. You could just be anywhere, essentially.
00:18:06.234 - 00:18:06.898, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:07.026 - 00:18:34.814, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool. And then with the furrow aspect, you were saying, so if a furrow stream was started on, let's say, arbitrum, but you wanted to receive it on optimism. That's kind of like the idea here is that you would be able to say, hey, I want to withdraw my funds to optimism because that's where I'd like to operate or any other chain. Or maybe you wanted it back on Mainnet so you would be able to essentially withdraw from that stream that's on whatever network and to a totally different network and that wouldn't matter.
00:18:35.714 - 00:18:55.134, Speaker C: Yep, that's correct. Wow, that's, I mean, that's live from the contract side. We can also taught from the UI very soon. It also had a component of tornado cash where you can lp into like you can just put the funds into tornado cash. I'm not sure if that's a lot useful after today's news, but we'll see about that.
00:18:55.634 - 00:19:24.064, Speaker A: Yeah, well it's, you know, for some people, maybe they're still into that, but yeah, anyways, also just. It's cool just to see that there's these types of, you know, thoughts and integrations. Just options that are available for everyone to, you know, to try and like to use within all. Within the UI and. Yeah. Thankful that like this technology has been, you know, super supportive or like, is able to help with all this. Very cool.
00:19:25.244 - 00:19:56.466, Speaker C: We had also considered a possibility of changing how our ex sushi works. We're calling it like xx sushi, but like, I'm generally banned for naming stuff at sushi, so probably like marketing and the bd folks will come with a better name. But the xx sushi stand for like, you know, cross ex sushi, which would allow. So this was not P's target, but more with the layer zero part where it could allow the. So it works like how you have your ofd tokens. Right. So it's very similar to that.
00:19:56.466 - 00:20:23.932, Speaker C: And you could, like, bridge, uh, exushi from, like, one place to from, like, I generally like to call it, like, teleport. So even if you, like, see the initial implementation of Ubento, it's all teleport. Because then, I don't know. I just like that for word, it's more magical. So teleport your exhibit from one chain to the other chain. And then we have, like, you know, some kind of auction mechanism, uh, to make sushi more decent lives. And you can do that.
00:20:23.932 - 00:20:44.624, Speaker C: So sushi has, like, a good focus on using cross chain and, you know, like, how do we enable that in our future products? So with sushi x swap and other products, obviously, like, sushi X swap went through the proper governance process. And, you know, it had, like, a good traction from the start. So it was an absolute win for us to do that as soon as possible.
00:20:45.044 - 00:21:11.920, Speaker A: Mm hmm. Yeah. Okay. And I remember seeing the xx sushi on the forum as well as you were just kind of, like, hashing out that idea and what it could look like. But, yeah, I think that, I mean, obviously it would be amazing to have sushi be able to move across or teleport, as you like to call it. I think we're using traverse was also one of the technical terms that was being used. But, yeah, either way, it's.
00:21:11.920 - 00:21:33.686, Speaker A: That's. That's cool. That's something that you're thinking about. And that, again, this technology has been able to help with. Okay, we had a couple of questions here about the volume. Yeah, that volume, I think that was from flip side, and they had just integrated it recently, so I don't know if it's captured absolutely everything. And I think they have to, like, manually update it.
00:21:33.750 - 00:21:38.542, Speaker C: But right now it's at like 50 nine. But it's way more than that.
00:21:38.638 - 00:21:39.102, Speaker A: Okay.
00:21:39.158 - 00:21:41.206, Speaker C: Like, the actual value is way more than that.
00:21:41.270 - 00:21:42.102, Speaker A: Okay, cool.
00:21:42.198 - 00:21:43.034, Speaker C: Pfizer.
00:21:44.394 - 00:21:58.298, Speaker A: All right. Yeah, well, we can. We'll work on that more because that would be something that's really cool to see, is to have that, like, a full dashboard of, like, what that actual volume is. I know I kind of asked flipside for that, and they swiped something together here. So at least it's. It's. It's working.
00:21:58.298 - 00:22:15.898, Speaker A: It's starting to integrate here, but glad to hear that it's, you know, it's a bit higher and. Yeah. Looking forward to seeing more and more volume come across here. Okay. The. Yeah. Would how gasless transactions work under the hood.
00:22:15.898 - 00:22:25.614, Speaker A: Would it be a pool of sushi tokens across all available networks? I don't know if you want to maybe dive into. I guess it's more utilizing the bento box, I think is kind of where the gas lists.
00:22:26.714 - 00:23:00.390, Speaker C: Yep. So I mean, like, we actually have gas lists for swaps. So when you go to our limit order and put a swap below the market price, you can execute it gasless. But obviously that's, that's not the best way out to implement gasless operations. So we don't want to call them like gasless swaps, you want to call them gases operations. Because technically, if you want to move things around, it's completely gasless. If you want to move your lp, move your cash position from one USDC market on one chain to another USDC market on another chain, or maybe swap in between.
00:23:00.390 - 00:23:46.370, Speaker C: So all these are operations. The way it would work will be that so sushi would take, or you know, like, so this again, like this platform will be decentralized again that the relay would take from the between the transaction. As you know, the cost of doing this operation and will pay for you in that behalf. With bento box, we can actually do that. And you only need to give your signature to the bento box and a token approval. And most cases where, you know, like tokens like USDC and USDT, with where you already have token approvals, you know, like via signatures, you don't have to do an approval transaction. So you can basically sign two signatures and can actually send, let's say 100 USDC to somebody in a gasless fashion.
00:23:46.370 - 00:23:57.614, Speaker C: And there will be a fee which will be taken in USDC during the transaction itself. So let's say if you want to send like 100 USDC and two USDC is the fee, that is the recipient would get 98 USD.
00:23:58.074 - 00:24:31.034, Speaker A: Nice, nice. Yeah, I see that they've respond very cool. So yeah, that's, yeah, a super cool feature. And like, you know, Primo had mentioned here this chats about that. You know, they've been chatting about that internally as well. So like pretty cool to see that this is, you know, this is something that is now a possibility and is being thought of because, yeah, there's a lot of people that just don't realize they need native gas or source gas or, you know, to, to actually operate within the ecosystem. So very cool.
00:24:31.114 - 00:25:01.098, Speaker C: And even need the gas because target gives us an option to receive the dust gas on the chain. Sushi has it in the contracts. We're going to switch it on the UI as well very soon. We were just finalizing how the UX flow would look like for the user. And user can select, you know, like some request some amount of dust gas, which, you know, will be, you know, provided by this target in the transaction itself. So they would receive their bridge tokens plus the destination, you know, like dust gas as well.
00:25:01.186 - 00:25:30.554, Speaker A: Yeah. Awesome. Yeah, that was one thing that, you know, we'd be brought in with Stargate and then be able to access that from the sushi UI would be incredible. You know, it's nice to be able to, yeah. Like if you're, you know, wanting to go to a new training, you've never been there before. Being able to like swap whatever assets that you wanted over there and, and be able to drop yourself native gas. Like that's, yeah, so that you've got enough to perform, you know, and we get to some of these other networks, it's like you don't even need to send that much.
00:25:30.554 - 00:25:44.818, Speaker A: And you have like, you know, hundreds of transactions, you know, some, you know, cheaper chains like polygon or optimism, you know, even Avax, like there's, you don't have to send too much where you can actually operate for, for a long time on those things.
00:25:44.986 - 00:26:15.242, Speaker C: Yeah. And the Ui IUI would be like a smart ui. So, so it sees, right? Like, hey, if you, if the, uh, if you don't have, you know, like destination tokens on the other side, it will automatically suggest you to add some top up and you can like select like request some top up and then like descend that to Stargate router. And it does all the magic in the backend and sends users the bridge token as well as the dust amount. So, you know, it doesn't allow users to, you know, do it every time. Doesn't complicate Ui. So.
00:26:15.298 - 00:26:42.052, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Amazing, amazing. Okay, what have we got? Could this unlock liquidity across all chains? So Sushi would not really need to incentivize LP's on other chains, really just stable coins and STG for swapping, I guess, like. Yeah. With, when it comes to the liquidity and incentivizing LP's, I think you'll still need to incentivize LP's on some chains, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:26:42.068 - 00:27:35.318, Speaker C: I mean, like, there is this common misconception, right, that between like the cross chain swaps and across index, right? Across index is where you have like liquidity from all chains in one accounting system. Uh, the cross chain swaps are, you know, like the accounting is still different, but you can swap, you can like, you know, go about from one asset to another asset via some intermediate more swaps. So Sushi X swap is like cross chain swapping where, you know, it doesn't basically account for liquidity in all chains together, it does it individually in each chains and then uses target to bridge tokens in between. So it doesn't change how sushi is structured. You still have, we still have to incentivize different pairs on different networks. Each network should have their own market and, you know, like how we have different market. Ethereum arbitram optimism for sushi that's gonna be the same now.
00:27:35.318 - 00:27:53.994, Speaker C: And you can use sushi x swap to, you know, like easily experience bridging with a cross chain fashion where you know, and select different asset. It doesn't give you an experience where the entire liquidity, Ethereum arbitram are taken in place together as one. You know, they're still fragmented.
00:27:55.414 - 00:28:02.696, Speaker A: Okay, cool, cool. Well, yeah, I don't know we're any.
00:28:02.800 - 00:28:09.764, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe cross chain sushi text, you know, who knows? Not telling it, not denying it as well, but yeah.
00:28:10.784 - 00:28:32.720, Speaker A: And again, are there plans to acquire more growth to the sushi X swap protocol? I mean, yeah, just any thoughts and ideas around further adoption here? I guess, like obviously once people start realizing how awesome it is and what, you know, especially with the gasless, swampness, gasless swap nature. Yeah, but, oh yeah, for sure.
00:28:32.752 - 00:29:25.524, Speaker C: Like the more adoption would automatically start coming in when we move more towards a sushi 2.0 UI. We have been hammering props to Ui dev, ramen and Matt for that, where, you know, we are basically migrating all the old components to the newer UI at sushi. We've built so much that we kind of, you know, keep getting that technical depth whenever we have to innovate something on a product level that touches all the products. Right. So once we migrate to the new one, you could basically, let's say if you want to provide like right now, Ethereum, there's one pair in Ethereum cache which has like 600% to 700% in AP, right? And let's say if you're an arbitrary man, you want lp into that. You just, you would be using sushi x swap in the background from the UI, you just wouldn't know it, right? So that's, that's what the experience we want, right? We want users to know less and enjoy more.
00:29:25.524 - 00:29:55.334, Speaker C: So they can just select like, hey, they want to lp into this, they want to provide capital into this market and they want to do it from this token and at this network and they just like, yeah, let's do it. Go. And, you know, like, they just wait for, you know, like a minute or so, depending on the chain. And then there you could basically see the, you know, like the capital on the other side. In fact, you know, like, this is a new protocol radiant, which is launched, and their first version looks something like this. So we're going to also instantly have that.
00:29:56.434 - 00:29:59.094, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, it sounds basically like.
00:29:59.474 - 00:30:01.694, Speaker C: And borrow money from anywhere you want.
00:30:01.994 - 00:30:18.214, Speaker A: Very cool. Very cool. All right. If there's any final questions. Yeah, feel free to either put your hand up, we can come get you up on stage, or just ask them in here from. Yeah, from the text questions. Let's see here.
00:30:18.214 - 00:30:41.064, Speaker A: Oh, oh, yeah. There was a cryptic tweet that hasn't slept since. Yeah, I don't know, Primo. I think there was a tweet that went out a little while ago that was a funny looking picture that people weren't able to really decipher. If you can.
00:30:41.964 - 00:30:44.504, Speaker B: I have no idea what you guys are talking about.
00:30:44.984 - 00:30:45.804, Speaker A: Huh?
00:30:46.584 - 00:31:11.404, Speaker B: What am I supposed to say? Am I supposed to blame the intern? Is that, is that the, is that the new meta right now? We'll see. I think there's going to be a lot of things rolling out over there over the next little while, possibly some more also cryptic things happening at some point. But, yeah, we'll see a bunch of things coming soon enough.
00:31:12.254 - 00:31:14.314, Speaker A: So just. Yeah, stay tuned.
00:31:16.174 - 00:31:17.874, Speaker C: I'll try to figure that out.
00:31:20.094 - 00:31:51.074, Speaker A: Well, just stay tuned, everyone. Lots of, it's just, it's so great to see so much development happening here. Like, even just being able to see sushi, the sushi X swap working and actually live, it was incredible watching you at the head eat CC where you're like, all right, let's just, you know, here's like, we're going to do this live now. And it went live, like, what, 20 minutes before or something? And it was incredible to see, see that happen. And people were like, what is this on testnet? And they're like, no, no, this is, this is live. This is, this is, this is happening. This is accessible now.
00:31:51.074 - 00:32:44.650, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think a lot of people are pretty stoked on this and to be able to see that the building and integration for this is possible. You know, the Stargate layer zero team has been extremely supportive and wants to be able to help as much as possible. So if anybody here listening in is, you know, thinking about doing any kind of, you know, cross chain or omni chain type type development, feel free to reach out to us in discord, you know, or on Twitter Telegram as well. Obviously we want, want to see as much development and use case as possible and yeah. Hoping that there's like a really great, really great technical solution here for all this. So it's great to see there is more and more people that are projects that are building on top of on top, but just really looking forward to a lot of rollouts.
00:32:44.650 - 00:32:54.174, Speaker A: So, yeah, with that, sarong, if you got anything, any last comments, questions, concerns and then Primo, if you've got anything after that.
00:32:55.394 - 00:33:10.254, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. I mean, like really shout out to Primo and the entire Stargate and layer zero team. They were the kind of really, really helpful and, you know, they kept up with my annoying questions on how some of the things work. So thank you. Thank you guys for that.
00:33:12.314 - 00:33:46.574, Speaker B: Yeah, nothing, nothing from my end. Just super excited. Obviously, anytime you get to spend time with someone like sarong who just, like, just ships, right? I think I posted the tweet as soon as he said it, but just like, oh, yeah. Like, I was just in there playing around for like ten to 20 minutes and then I was, like, building the exact thing I wanted. So just having people who condition to ship code and really build stuff are always just the best. Those are literally my favorite people in the world. So it's been super fun, super fun to see what other cool things can be built and just pumped to be doing it.
00:33:47.994 - 00:34:17.294, Speaker A: Wicked. Wicked. All right, well, I think that's a great place to wrap it up there, folks. Again, this, thanks for coming on here, sarong and Primo, for talking this all through here and letting everybody know kind of more on the development side as well. And yeah, this has been recorded and is live streaming to YouTube right now. So we'll, yeah, this will be available for follow up if you missed it. If you are on YouTube, please smash that, like, button and subscribe.
00:34:17.294 - 00:34:53.930, Speaker A: And yeah, we'll stay tuned with further updates. Of course you can, yeah, find sarong over in sushi Discord. And of course, glad if you're over in Twitter spaces right now, hop over into, you know, be sure you've joined the discord and, you know, speak with the community there and, and get involved that way. But, yeah, thanks, everybody for coming out. And those of you who are over in discord, we'll have a po app for you. I'm not sure if it's come in just yet, but we'll have you recorded if you've been in for 15 minutes or more. But okay, thanks, everybody, and we'll chat with you very soon.
00:34:53.930 - 00:34:55.134, Speaker A: Thanks for coming out.
00:34:56.293 - 00:34:58.605, Speaker C: Thanks for having me. Have a nice day, guys. Bye.
00:34:58.669 - 00:34:59.525, Speaker A: Bye. Bye.
00:34:59.709 - 00:35:03.173, Speaker B: Same. See ya. Bye.
