00:00:01.320 - 00:00:53.692, Speaker A: Welcome to the Stargate finance community call, where we discuss proposals and ideas that will help shape and govern the Stargate protocol. Feel free to join the conversation on stage anytime you have a question by clicking on the raise hand button at the bottom of the screen. You can also chime in through the voice text channel in discord or any of the chats, those listening in live in YouTube and Twitch, and those channels aggregate all the messages together. Just a reminder, this is not financial, accounting, or legal advice. Please do your own research. Okay, yeah, I'm just back from Burning man, so that was. Yeah, it was great to get back there and whatnot, but just got home, like, super late last night, so it's been kind of a long stretch here for me, so I do apologize if I'm a bit foggy at times, but, yeah, it's been.
00:00:53.692 - 00:00:57.644, Speaker A: It was a really great time. And what was your favorite part?
00:00:57.684 - 00:00:58.424, Speaker B: Tango.
00:00:59.444 - 00:01:18.012, Speaker A: Well, I'll have to say that I proposed to my fiance now, so that. Yeah, big exciting news there. So. Pretty, pretty stoked. She's stoked. And, yeah, that was a big one, but, yeah, had a lot of fun there, so. Yeah.
00:01:18.012 - 00:01:48.818, Speaker A: But back to back. Back to crypto. Back to crypto. So I actually went to camp decentral, and I did a couple of talks there, too, so did a talk on intro to Daos and then another one on intro to just intro to blockchain, so that was pretty neat. And, yeah, handed out a few tangled with tangle po apps as well from out of the burn, so. Yeah. Okay.
00:01:48.818 - 00:01:59.090, Speaker A: Yeah. Thanks, guys. Thanks, everybody. Yeah. So. Okay, well, let's dive into some stuff here. Enough about me and my stuff.
00:01:59.090 - 00:02:22.118, Speaker A: Hope everybody's doing great. Yeah, I guess the first things here are. Yeah, binance Ama. We just had that on the telegram channel. Yeah, a few hours ago, I guess. Yeah, 4 hours ago, so, yeah, 1200 utc. Yeah, it was great just to get a lot of engagement and people involved there.
00:02:22.118 - 00:02:41.014, Speaker A: There was. Yeah, I think $5,000 worth of STG rewards. Yeah. For participants. So, yeah, hopefully some of you were able to get over there and able to participate in that. And. Yeah, that's.
00:02:41.014 - 00:03:02.754, Speaker A: There's another one, too. That was the english version, and then the chinese one is later today, I think in about 11 hours from now. So that'll put us in it. I'm not sure on the UTC time. I might have to check that real quick, but. Yeah. So 11 hours from now that one happens.
00:03:02.754 - 00:03:39.076, Speaker A: So let's see, that would be. I think that's three UTC and I think that's 11:00 a.m. UTC eight. So if, yeah. Anybody's looking for that one from the chinese community or any chinese speakers, head into that and yeah, you can enjoy that. Yeah. And I guess like we could probably dive in here right away with this.
00:03:39.076 - 00:04:06.600, Speaker A: Arrakis proposal has been up for a while. We want to dive into that. We're going to cover a bunch of this stuff first here and then we'll talk about some, some other layer zero stuff once primo shows up. But yeah, if squirrel, I think you're in the audience. If you want to raise your hand, we'll get you up here. Where are you? Thought I saw a squirrel here a minute ago. Oh, there we go.
00:04:06.600 - 00:04:10.844, Speaker A: Invite to speak squirrel.
00:04:11.464 - 00:04:12.920, Speaker C: Hey, what's up, Tango?
00:04:13.072 - 00:04:18.632, Speaker A: Not much. Not much. Yeah. Glad, glad you could join us here today. So thank you.
00:04:18.688 - 00:04:21.856, Speaker C: Could you also get Cassandra up here?
00:04:21.960 - 00:04:26.004, Speaker A: Okay. Cassandra? Cassandra, where are you? Cassandra.
00:04:33.514 - 00:04:35.174, Speaker C: Should be in here.
00:04:35.474 - 00:04:39.574, Speaker A: Is it, it's not, is it drl ch zero?
00:04:40.434 - 00:04:45.410, Speaker C: Don't think that's, no, it's with a, it's just Cassandra.
00:04:45.482 - 00:04:54.124, Speaker A: Cassandra with dot ETH. Yeah, Cassandra ETH. All right. Inviting to speak. Get up here.
00:04:55.704 - 00:04:58.884, Speaker D: Hey, everybody say immaculate vibes.
00:04:59.184 - 00:05:14.312, Speaker A: Awesome here today. Cool, cool. Yeah. Well, yeah, let's, I guess, yeah. If you want here just first and foremost just let people know kind of who you are. You're obviously involved with Arrakis. Yeah.
00:05:14.312 - 00:05:27.826, Speaker A: And then just kind of like what Arrakis does, maybe just give a little color on all that and then we can dive into the proposal and what your, I guess the thoughts and how this can all work just kind of break it down for everyone. Yep.
00:05:27.890 - 00:06:07.344, Speaker C: Cool. I'm squirrel. I'm leading growth at Arrakis and I was the one that also pushed out the proposal onto the forum. In short, what we're doing at Arrakis is we are providing all sorts of liquidity, providing services to projects where the aim is to help projects make their tokens more liquid in a very capital efficient way and at the same time offering a Uni V two style experience for LP's on top of Univ three. So that's kind of a very, very short intro there.
00:06:09.124 - 00:06:26.050, Speaker D: Yeah, perfect. And just by the way, hey, I'm Cassandra ETH. I was, I'm the lead dev and CTO now of Arrakis. So yeah, that's what I do. And perfect description of from a high level of what we do.
00:06:26.202 - 00:06:52.134, Speaker A: Right on. Right on. Yeah. And I guess like for anyone who's not super familiar with V three versus v two, but yeah, just that concentrated position and being able to like, yeah, be far more capital efficient with your, with the liquidity that you have and providing, you know, I guess gaining less slippage and, and I guess like maybe just even talk about the advantages there. I mean, it's straightforward, but yeah, yeah.
00:06:52.594 - 00:07:55.554, Speaker D: Of course, for some who aren't used to it, basically Univ. Three made it possible for liquidity providers to express the range, the price range in which they want to provide liquidity, which could be more or less concentrated. And this really changes the whole game, because now as a liquidity provider, you have to make these decisions and you could like actively continue to change these ranges as prices move. The good thing about this is that if you have a narrow price range and if liquidity providers provide liquidity inside a narrow range, and the tokens only trade inside that range, you basically get much better trade execution prices with much less capital inside of the pool. So this is this capital efficiency benefit of concentrated liquidity. And of course, the potential downside for LP's is that now your job is much more complex, actually much more active. And this is what Horacis sort of helps to streamline and solve both for projects and for the wider LP.
00:07:55.974 - 00:08:21.674, Speaker A: Gotcha. Gotcha. So then with the position management, obviously in the proposal here, you kind of talk about using an NFT here for that, how that represents that position. How do you guys manage that? Or how does this all work out to stay within range? And how do you decide on those parameters and whatnot? If you just outline that, yeah.
00:08:22.614 - 00:09:04.572, Speaker D: So what's cool about our system is it's entirely flexible. It can be utilized in a number of different ways. In the end though, I think through experience, we've noticed that actually like highly active range management is an exciting domain. But it's not always the best. It doesn't always have the best outcomes, both because you're kind of chasing prices. And there's a lot of ways that you can expose yourself to the deep losses by trying to have too concentrated of a range. And also when you're aggregating liquidity from like your whole community, potentially with some sort of liquidity mining scheme, then you want to.
00:09:04.572 - 00:09:40.084, Speaker D: It's for everybody's singular preferences there. So we usually, what we do is we set a somewhat wide range that still gives you concentrated liquidity benefits over Univ. Two, you know, two, three, five x, more bang for your buck, so to speak, for all the liquidity that goes in. But at the same time, pick a range that has a low likelihood of ever going range based on some we do with the project and both, both some modeling we do internally also.
00:09:42.024 - 00:09:42.360, Speaker A: To.
00:09:42.392 - 00:10:12.764, Speaker D: Basically pick a suitable range that then hopefully never needs to be rebalanced unless certain dire things happen. So this is the approach that we found actually works the best, even though it's not, doesn't sound as fancy. It has, usually has had actually the best outcomes for both making your kind of liquidity bootstrapping and liquidity mining much more efficient, but also, you know, not taking on too much risk. Highly concentrated.
00:10:13.784 - 00:10:41.614, Speaker A: Got it. Got it. Okay. Yeah. And then as far as like, yeah, how you, how you guys handle it, manage this here and in setting up like a vault. Yeah, how does that all work? And. Yeah, like, what is the management behind this? And like audits and all that kind of stuff just for people who have concerns about security or I guess even just the management aspect too, if you kind of shed some light on that.
00:10:42.514 - 00:11:34.460, Speaker D: Yep. So like I said, too, I believe the approach that we want to use here, and it's the best, is when it's like low amount of active management. And so the who escrows this manager role. Basically there's one special Ethereum account, which could be any Ethereum account, smart contract, whatever, multisig, it could be burned completely. But this manager account is the only one who could execute a change of the price range and basically rebalance the liquidity inside of the position that's aggregated from everyone. This sometimes the role is held on in house managers and that's just a multisig. So we have recurring meetings to be checking in on this.
00:11:34.460 - 00:12:01.264, Speaker D: If it turns out that there is some sort of situation where we think it's worth it to adjust the ranges, then we do this. And it's kind of a slow manual process. Now what's cool is it's really flexible. So it's also something where it could actually be like under the Stargate Dao or Stargate devs control as well. So basically you could have control of it instead of something in house at Arrakis. So all kinds of things are hurt.
00:12:02.484 - 00:12:15.704, Speaker C: I just want to add quick, this manager role, the only thing that it can do is move this range. It can't withdraw or deposit any funds into the contract.
00:12:16.024 - 00:12:24.336, Speaker A: Got it? Got it. So yeah, the only way to withdraw or deposit is directly from the wallet that had deposited the LP's.
00:12:24.400 - 00:12:25.004, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:27.504 - 00:13:01.070, Speaker D: And what's nice is you get this fungible wrapper, right? So every LP who deposits liquidity into the vault, which is depositing liquidity into uniswap V three on your behalf, gets an ERC 20, much like uni V two. So if you burn this token, you get back your underlying tokens, your underlying assets. And in terms of audits and security, which you mentioned. Yeah, we've been audited a couple of times. We're audited by Watchpug and Certik. Initially, we made a few very aesthetic, small upgrades, and those were also audited to the vault system. And we've been in production for over a year.
00:13:01.070 - 00:13:20.662, Speaker D: We have like, we've had a peak, like $1.8 billion in the year without any issues. So we're feeling quite confident in the implementation. It's all open source as well. So you can check out the contracts and. Yeah. Verify for yourself as we do in crypto.
00:13:20.662 - 00:13:26.514, Speaker D: So, yeah, that's kind of the state of audits and security.
00:13:26.894 - 00:13:39.434, Speaker A: Got it. Got it. Okay. Yeah. And then as far as, like, the service, I guess they have the service fee. So that's 2.5% on top of fee of trading fees generated.
00:13:39.434 - 00:13:47.844, Speaker A: So you. So you take the 2.5% of the fees or just how does that all exactly?
00:13:47.964 - 00:14:03.820, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So zero of principle deposited is taken. Right. So if you're an LP, it's not like when you. When you deposit into the vault, nothing is taken off the top of your deposits. Of all the fees generated. Fees are being constantly generated as trading is happening.
00:14:03.820 - 00:14:30.070, Speaker D: 2.5% of those fees, which usually comes out to something really quite modest, if you think about it. For instance, our largest vaults, which have earned like, maybe close to a million dollars in fees, we're still only. It accounts to something like 1520K or something, but. So, yeah, we only take 2.5% off of the fees that are generated by the LP position.
00:14:30.262 - 00:14:44.444, Speaker A: Got it. And. Yeah. And then in turn, by having. Yeah, maybe the fees, that percentage there is helping create better liquidity for. For anyone that's looking to swap on those pools.
00:14:45.384 - 00:14:59.064, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. The fee is basically for the infrastructure itself and also for. There is some. There are some other perks of the vault. For instance, all these fees that are being earned are also auto compounded under the hood. So you're positioned in uniswap v. Three.
00:14:59.064 - 00:15:19.726, Speaker D: When you earn fees, those fees don't actually. They don't go back into the uniswap pool as liquidity. You'd have to do this yourself manually. So we do this on behalf of the whole vault. And when the vault is full of a lot of LP's and there's a lot of money in there, this actually has noticeable benefits. For the returns that you're making at SNL.
00:15:19.830 - 00:15:20.118, Speaker A: Got it.
00:15:20.126 - 00:15:22.630, Speaker D: So this is the reason for the video.
00:15:22.782 - 00:15:45.410, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. All right. I don't know if anyone have any questions for Cassandra Squirrel while they're up here. Yeah, and if you want, bring some stuff in here from the AMA text questions and. Yeah, please keep it. Keep it constructive, please, with your questions.
00:15:45.410 - 00:16:08.826, Speaker A: But yeah, if there's, you know, obviously we want to see some sort of management with any of these kind of positions with, you know, with the v three stuff. So, yeah, obviously do something better than the zero to infinity v two position. Yeah.
00:16:08.850 - 00:16:50.424, Speaker D: I think what one finds is that zero to infinity for almost any token, some part of these tails is basically useless capital sitting there idle. So being able to lop off those tails a little bit will always give you with very, very little new risk added, because very unlikely any token will trade near infinity dollars. Maybe it's a little more likely they could go closer to zero. Right. I think these are pretty unlikely scenarios. And you already get some benefits. The traders can now get a little bit less slippage on their trades.
00:16:50.424 - 00:16:55.584, Speaker D: And depending on how concentrated you go, this can be astronomical.
00:16:57.764 - 00:17:25.738, Speaker A: Got it. Okay. Yeah, I guess how is. I was just reading through some of these questions here, but yeah, I don't know. Yeah, it seems like an interesting idea. Yeah. Would like to hear from the community some more here through Commonwealth and whatnot.
00:17:25.738 - 00:17:34.814, Speaker A: But yeah, I don't know anything further for you guys to kind of share with the community before. Before we hand.
00:17:38.114 - 00:18:01.678, Speaker C: So right now we're working with about 75 different projects. The cool part also with these LP's is that they are fully fungible. Right. They're also fully composable. So Makerdao, for example, is using our LP's to use it as collateral.
00:18:01.766 - 00:18:02.014, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:02.054 - 00:18:46.352, Speaker C: To mint dai. So kind of building up on these, on these money legos. There's more possibilities with these LP's as well. And so far, the feedback has been really good. And kind of the biggest difference between us and the competition is, as said, that we're more focused on the project side of things, where we're definitely not going to be the ones that provide the highest yield to l peers. But that's just because we're focused on not screwing this LP with going too tight and having to rearrange too much. So the way that we do rerange is if our models.
00:18:46.352 - 00:19:42.036, Speaker C: So we use a Monte Carlo simulation to basically model out whether the range is going to be accurate for the coming month of the price. Right. Whether the price is going to be within this price range. And what happens then is if we then see that there's a probability that the price range moves out of this range, then we only rearrange parts of this LP position so that we're not speculating on the market. If we were to move the whole LP position, that would be us taking a directional trade. And like this, by taking portion by portion, it's almost like dollar cost averaging, the impermanent loss. And we're really focused on that, making sure that it's much more capital efficient and much lower slippage than Univ.
00:19:42.036 - 00:19:48.824, Speaker C: Two or forks of Univ. Two, but not highly aggressive to kind of kill the LPU.
00:19:51.244 - 00:20:12.584, Speaker A: All right, cool. Cool. Yeah. And I guess just, you know, maybe any final comments here around, like, security or how we can be, you know, knowing that, you know, everything's going to be safe here for the position and whatnot? If there's any final kind of comments on that.
00:20:15.324 - 00:20:33.728, Speaker D: Yeah, I think for security. Security, we take extremely seriously. Like I said, I think what the best thing is that there's sort of. It's an entirely permissionless system and it's up to you. The project sort of, maybe the most important role.
00:20:33.776 - 00:20:33.984, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:34.024 - 00:21:17.742, Speaker D: Is like, this manager role, and how this wants to be escrowed is up to you. And so if you want that entirely burned, then you would have the sort of immutable position. And then there's like zero risk. Besides the, you know, if you. If you trust in the implementation of the smart contract, which has been audited a number of times, then there's zero risk of any griefing or this manager role doing anything unsavory. Even though this manager cannot sort of play with the underlying assets at will, they could still, for instance, grief the vault because they could put some range that nobody likes. Right, exactly.
00:21:17.742 - 00:21:46.118, Speaker D: You could remove this completely, or you could make it so that your dao. Right, it's your dao's time lock that is the only one who can actually execute these rearranges. And so you can make sure that it's sort of entirely decentralized and under the control of your community. So. Or it could be some smart contract where you put some guardrails on how exactly, who can operate this and what kind of ranges are allowed.
00:21:46.166 - 00:21:46.374, Speaker E: Right.
00:21:46.414 - 00:22:29.026, Speaker D: So it's really, the world is your oyster, since it's a. A fully flexible system for how you want to approach the security of this. I think, just to speak a little more, maybe to the benefits, I think people have noticed that Univ. Three trying to aggregate liquidity or to do liquidity mining on Univ three is. It's quite complex and cumbersome because everybody can choose their own ranges. If you just leave that to the world and the community, often you don't get the kind of liquidity distribution you would really like. Or if you try to incentivize, like, there's this other way to incentivize liquidity on Uni v.
00:22:29.026 - 00:23:16.958, Speaker D: Three, which is the univ. Three staker. But people have had a lot of issues with this because basically it tries to only incentivize in range LP's. And this sounds great, but what happens is you get these kind of just in time liquidity attacks, people who put in liquidity for a very short amount of time with a very concentrated range to basically steal as many of the fees as possible without really giving you any sustainable liquidity for the token, which is what you're after. And so this is where these kinds of abstractions, I think have shown to actually be quite useful. Right, because now as a project, you can say, we want to incentivize liquidity in this sustainable range. You can say, we're trying to target liquidity here and you can set up the parameters that you would like and then sort of for each LP it becomes more fair again.
00:23:16.958 - 00:23:48.174, Speaker D: Right? Every LP, for the amount of assets you put in, you're going to earn rewards. These liquidity mining rewards, not this kind of weird player versus player liquidity attack game, which has had worse outcomes, I think, for lP's on your maybe three. So yeah, I think this. We've seen some success in projects. Really liking it. I think it also. But yeah, we're excited about it.
00:23:48.474 - 00:24:16.444, Speaker C: Okay, one last thing on security. The vaults have been running since a year and since then have an accrued TVL of about 1.5 billion. So there has been kind of this big, big bounty on these vaults. Of course, time isn't necessarily the thing that stops it, but so far at least it's proven that the bounty is pretty big and still nothing has happened.
00:24:16.744 - 00:24:29.698, Speaker A: Excellent. Well, that's great to hear. That's great to hear. Yeah. If no further questions from the community. Yeah, no, that's great. Thanks for giving an update here on all that.
00:24:29.698 - 00:24:52.190, Speaker A: And I please do advise everyone, if you can go over to Commonwealth, comment on it, learn about it. If you have questions, ask there. You guys are monitoring Commonwealth. If you, and I'm sure you'll get some, you know, if you do get replies or whatever, you guys can monitor that and message it. And if they want to reach out to you. What's the best way to get ahold of you guys?
00:24:52.302 - 00:25:07.998, Speaker C: Yeah, best way is probably through our discord. So the discord link is discord.com, Oracus finance. And yeah, I'll be monitoring commonwealth and as well as discord, of course. So just feel free to ask.
00:25:08.126 - 00:25:23.346, Speaker A: Got it. Got it. Yeah, if you, if you want, you can feel free to drop it into the voice text questions. If you want to drop the link there for Arrakis and yeah, people can check it out there. Thank you.
00:25:23.530 - 00:25:24.114, Speaker C: Right now.
00:25:24.194 - 00:25:29.658, Speaker A: Yeah. Awesome. Well, thanks, guys for coming on and yeah, we'll, we'll stay tuned.
00:25:29.706 - 00:25:30.378, Speaker C: Thanks a lot.
00:25:30.466 - 00:26:18.666, Speaker A: You bet. You bet. Awesome. Okay, before we dive into a bunch of other updates stuff here, we'll just touch on the, the proposal for new assets here with die fracks, SUSD and LUSD. Yeah, so basically just having like, you know, greater, greater asset diversity for bridging across, you know, other, other networks and whatnot and yeah, just especially with, you know, different stables, we've got USDC, USDT BUSD and, you know, an ETH right now. But having some, you know, having these other ones here, you know, that maybe take a different approach. So fracs, LUSD, SUSD, Dai all have interesting different approaches.
00:26:18.730 - 00:27:22.910, Speaker B: So yeah, maybe I can add something here. By the way, tango. I think what is important with this proposal that I kind of really like personally is the fact that it's mainly for token that are for example, optimism. So for example, SUSD is at the moment trying to become I guess like the stable point of choice over there. And that would be basically like a minimal amount of incentives going for a pool mainly for optimism to mainnet, meaning that, you know, you don't have this kind of seven days window to, to go through. And I think this is extremely valuable for, for folks willing to use like a bridge like Stargate and, you know, with everything related to what we saw, like I think it was two weeks ago already, everything related to basically like OFAC compliance and so on. I think some people like really now are thinking about what decentralization means, why it's important, and you know, like USDC, Dai and so on are of course like, you know, something of choice USDT.
00:27:22.910 - 00:28:21.794, Speaker B: But I do think having some alternative likes and so on is key. And you know, like ultimately like some people that are holding these stable coins for various reasons, like maybe because like that's how they, you know, they have like some collateral on these platform and, and so on and they don't want necessary to swap for something else because, well, perhaps this is gonna do like, this is gonna create like a taxable event. So anyways, just offering like more broad range of stable coins is one step. And I do think along the way, I would say like in the future, like potentially, like Stargate will indeed kind of start including like way more kind of collateral or assets for pool. Not just stable coins per se, it can even be volatile assets. This is very important for basically everyone looking to, they don't need to tank, they just show up on Stargate and they can just transfer all the tokens available in their wallet. Potentially.
00:28:21.794 - 00:29:00.064, Speaker B: That would be, in my opinion, the dream. And at the moment, this is not possible. Of course, you can use something like sushi xwap, there's like, you can transfer some of the assets and so on and so on, but I don't think this is a perfect solution yet, although very practical. So anyways, I do think there's like some very interesting parameters here. And from what I saw, the person proposing asked for three months of admission and then they can be, you know, tailored or adjusted. So I do think it's, yeah, quite reasonable.
00:29:01.284 - 00:30:02.352, Speaker A: Yeah, okay. I think it was two months, but maybe three months is something to look at as well. But yeah, and then just like, just to get that, to get these pools bootstrapped and get them running and, yeah, see how it goes. And like, maybe, you know, the target is, you see what the demands are, see what the, you know, where the targets need to be and incentivize accordingly. But obviously having these kind of options and being a bridge that can like, for all these kind of assets and being able to go from, you know, especially like, you know, going back and forth to optimism, you know, for all of them are going to optimism, you know, and then Dai and fracs having, you know, having other networks as well. So, and I think it's going to, if we start seeing these kind of, you know, getting traction behind these, I think it's possible, you know, to start attracting other tokens as well, people becoming more interested for this. So, yeah, I don't know, this seems like a great, great way and a great thing.
00:30:02.352 - 00:30:21.944, Speaker A: Just like obviously really great for, you know, for Stargate to try and have more options and. Yeah, see, die pools would be a no brainer. Yep, yep, yep, yep. And I like the idea of expanding the pools to more stables in general. Yes. So. So, no, thanks for those comments there.
00:30:21.944 - 00:30:43.504, Speaker A: I can never say your name. I'm just gonna call you funny. Funu. Funu for now. But yeah, so, yeah, obviously the emissions thing, we'll have to figure out and kind of work on that. But yeah, Primo, I don't know if you've got any comments or ideas around emissions or any of that point.
00:30:46.424 - 00:31:06.984, Speaker E: No, I think most of it was largely discussed. Today has all been UI updates and layer zero scan and getting all these other integrations live, this sort of full migration process. Yeah, I don't think I have anything external to add outside of what's already been said.
00:31:07.064 - 00:31:24.790, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, cool. If anybody else doesn't have, they've got any other ideas on this or comments or questions, let us know otherwise. Yeah, I'm really, really excited to dive into like the. All these new updates and everything here within Stargate. So glad you're able to hop on here. But.
00:31:24.790 - 00:31:49.350, Speaker A: Yeah, because adding assets won't be free. There's a definite benefit, but we'll have to choose, especially as newer assets like CrVUSD and GH o emerge. Yeah. Trade offs on a per asset basis needs to be considered. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think like just having a trial period too, to see what these demands are. Right.
00:31:49.350 - 00:32:19.164, Speaker A: I think that's going to be important. Yeah. And then being able to gauge from there because right now we're, you know, we don't really know what the demand is. Maybe it's way higher than we anticipate and, you know, maybe not as much incentivization is required, but. Yeah. Please, everybody head over to the forum, comment on, on that one. It's under general discussion and that's the proposal for new assets diffracts SUSD and LUSD.
00:32:19.164 - 00:32:36.988, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. Well, Primo, I'll let you take it away from here with kind of all these new updates and everything here on, on Stargate side, but yeah, some really great stuff. Yeah.
00:32:37.036 - 00:33:16.780, Speaker E: I mean, so have tried to push most of it out to the Twitter side of things. So hopefully everybody already has at least some context. But took the UI down for a little bit this morning to push some UI upgrades. Also, layer Zero did a ULn V two upgrade, which presents a bunch of things. Security patch and then the ability to go to non EVM chains and all this other stuff. All the applications we had to update a little bit, whatever, had to basically make a fix of this work. So website went down for a little bit.
00:33:16.780 - 00:33:51.012, Speaker E: Back up now UI's up, a whole bunch of new things on the UI side. UI side is all historical data. Historical data of TvL, of transactional volume of pools. Layer zero, scan.com went live, which allows you to track transactions, cross chain. So there's always been this kind of mess. See, the way Stargate did this on the back end was like a little bit of a hack in that it was like not guessing exactly, but like almost guessing at when this transaction would come in.
00:33:51.012 - 00:34:25.013, Speaker E: And now it's like, it's just much more clear on tracking transactions explicitly. And so that makes it much, much nicer for users just to be able to throw in their transaction hash and see it mapped to the other side and see when it is completed and that it is completed on the other side. So that's really cool. Yeah, I mean, I think that was really the bulk of it was bunch more data and then the scan side of things. So all of that. Really good things.
00:34:25.913 - 00:34:51.707, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Awesome, awesome. Yeah. And for everyone here, if you do have a transaction, if you're going to jump across the bridge and going from wherever, whatever network to whatever network, just grab your transaction hash and dump it in there and just see what, and see what comes up. Or even if you just go ahead and look at layer zero scan dot. Yeah, layer zero scan.com. I'll see if I can type that in here while we're doing this.
00:34:51.707 - 00:35:23.400, Speaker A: But yeah, you can see some of the transactions that are currently in flight, like what's pending right now or what has been delivered, and you can watch and see how many minutes behind, behind it is or whatever. So it's pretty cool to like, see it in real time. Like this is happening. Like we can see these transactions coming and going and you can trace them down and see, like, which network they're going to, where to and from. Yeah. And so hopefully this will help everyone. I know a lot of people are like, oh, where's my transaction? You know, and it's only been a minute or two and they're wondering about this.
00:35:23.400 - 00:35:46.814, Speaker A: So, yeah, just now you'll have that ability to, you know, see where your transactions at and be able to keep, keep a hold of that. So will there be a public API for Stargate transaction information on the Stargate finance website or not? Can we use the API endpoint that's calling it? I can see through the network tab. Primo able to touch on that with the API.
00:35:54.314 - 00:35:58.894, Speaker E: Sorry, were you reading this question? I heard the first part of it, but I.
00:35:59.034 - 00:36:06.158, Speaker A: All good. Yeah, just in the voice text questions. But yeah, Ray J here, he was saying, yeah. Will there be a public, will there.
00:36:06.166 - 00:36:43.814, Speaker E: Be a public API for the Stargate transaction? Yeah, it's already up. So if you go to layerzeroscan.com. Oh, for Stargate transaction information. So I know, the layer zero scan side of things has an API that applications leverage to basically make this much easier. So there's a user facing side, and then there is the API for all applications building on top of layer zero. The question is, will Stargate retransmit that out of its own API? And the answer is, I don't know. I've got to check with the front end team and see what their plan is.
00:36:43.814 - 00:36:47.214, Speaker E: Yeah, I don't actually know the answer.
00:36:48.394 - 00:37:01.842, Speaker A: All right, well, cool. Anyways, yeah, some great updates there for on the Stargate side. And. Yeah, please. Yeah, go get, go test it out. Give it a try. Tell us what you think of it.
00:37:01.842 - 00:37:28.990, Speaker A: And yeah, I don't know anything else here that we want to cover today. Yeah, we kind of went through a bunch of stuff here with everything but yeah, just excited to hear what. Get some feedback from everyone on what they think of all these new updates and whatnot. Yeah. When bounties for trans passive and.
00:37:29.062 - 00:37:50.214, Speaker E: Yeah, so that's kind of the bounty. I assume the bounty is the ulnV two bounty. So layer zero. Right. Aside from Stargate, did this migration where they deprecated ULNV one and migrated to ULNV two. The reason that that happened. So there's a post you can find on Twitter and on medium that sort of details this.
00:37:50.214 - 00:38:24.392, Speaker E: But basically there was the possibility for people to grief applications to basically send something that annoyingly sort of stuck pathways and made messaging kind of get stuck or get delayed. And so this griefing was because of the way that ULNv one was written. UlMV two takes away that issue. And so that was like the layer zero side migration. You can read about it. The bounty was to two anonymous white hats who didn't want to be named. They got a $250,000 bounty.
00:38:24.392 - 00:38:45.004, Speaker E: And then Sam cz son also separately reported the issue, like shortly after, and he got 20% of initial reports, so he got a $50,000 bounty. Passive just linked the thread and then there's medium post on all of this, but that's strictly on the layer zero side.
00:38:46.904 - 00:39:00.312, Speaker A: Awesome. Okay. Yeah, thanks for breaking that down and clarifying it here for everyone. But. Okay. Yeah. Anything further here? Yeah, with bounties for translations and whatnot.
00:39:00.312 - 00:39:23.054, Speaker A: Yeah, we will get some more stuff out soon here. Put that up through D work and whatnot. But, yeah. Anything further from anyone? Final questions? Comments, concerns here? Yeah, obviously this Ui thing has been a bit of an update. I know. I'm sure everybody wants to have the. The dashboard for the ve staking and whatnot.
00:39:23.054 - 00:39:32.834, Speaker A: So that will be. Yeah, that will be chugging along here soon. So. Yeah. Oh, and. Yeah. The ETH pal fork.
00:39:32.834 - 00:39:49.702, Speaker A: Yeah. Because, I mean, the merge is happening here in potentially, like we're in a week or so. Are we still on track for that? I guess. Any, any concerns that we have primo for like the merge or anything like that? And what happens with like, you know, concerns? We're.
00:39:49.718 - 00:40:04.234, Speaker E: We're not supporting the proof of work chain. So, you know, that that basically is the, is the big potential is like, if you wanted to try to support both, we're only going to support the proof of stake chain. So, yeah, there'll be no issues.
00:40:04.654 - 00:40:14.254, Speaker A: Perfect. Okay. Yes. And Ray J will. We're getting there. We're gonna get there. We're gonna get you.
00:40:14.254 - 00:40:24.746, Speaker A: Get you eating again so you don't starve. But. Okay. Yeah. If that's. If that's it. Yeah.
00:40:24.746 - 00:40:41.606, Speaker A: Thanks, everybody, for joining in today. Those on Twitter as well. Hopefully this came in relatively clear for you. And. Yeah, well, this is, you know, obviously streaming to YouTube and Twitch. So this will be available on YouTube shortly after. So check it out there.
00:40:41.606 - 00:40:58.574, Speaker A: And if you are listening in on YouTube right now, please like and subscribe and yeah, stay tuned for yeah. For in two weeks from now here for the next call. So thanks, everybody, and we will talk with you soon. Take care.
