00:00:00.760 - 00:00:45.440, Speaker A: Welcome to the Stargate Finance community call where we discuss proposals and ideas that will help shape and govern the Stargate protocol. Feel free to join the conversation on stage anytime you have a question by clicking the raise hand button at the bottom of the screen. You can also chime in through the voice text channel in discord or any of the chats for those listening in over YouTube or Twitch as those channels all aggregate the messages together. Just a reminder, this is not financial, accounting or legal advice. Please do your own research. Okay, yeah, quickly having. Yes, we've got Stargate has reached two or Stargate reached 1 million in transactions just as of like a few days ago.
00:00:45.440 - 00:01:37.144, Speaker A: So yeah, pretty exciting to see that there's that much activity and that like, that's a pretty major milestone to see that this many people have utilized Stargate. So pretty wicked to see that. And I mean, this month so far here, 200,000 transactions just in January so far, you know, and still over 120 million in volume. So still some pretty great things here happening as far as like utilization and seeing what, you know, with, with everyone utilizing the protocol and whatnot. So happy to see all of that. As far as the Stargate optimism Galaxy Quest, we had that one with running for quite a while and that one ended yesterday. So there's been, yeah, notification about that for a long time, but yeah, so hopefully there was like, I think three, over 300,000 people like were eligible for that.
00:01:37.144 - 00:02:11.954, Speaker A: So like a lot of people claiming these. It was really great to see so many, so much participation with that, but that'll be wrapped up now and, yeah, just stay tuned. We're going to be exploring, you know, other quests and on chain activities for you to have a look at. And of course we had the previous league quest here with layer three and that one was a quest from BNB to Avax for 300 in stables. There was an onft reward again for that and, you know, plans for another one very soon. So stay tuned. That one will be soon.
00:02:11.954 - 00:02:55.880, Speaker A: Yeah. So yeah, looking at lots of quest stuff, you know, finding a lot of people are engaged in that, so that's pretty cool. Then we had a community stand up with Guild XYZ last week. It was great to see that Guild wanted to highlight our community and one that is utilizing Guild and some of the cool features that they offer. So it was great to be over there and chat with them and go through a bunch of stuff that Stargate is up to over here. We were also one of the first protocols to actually utilize the smart contract logic. For example, when you're farming because of Guild, we're able to actually recognize that you have taken your LP token and staked it in the farm.
00:02:55.880 - 00:03:26.604, Speaker A: And that was something that we were, I was really excited about because there was no way to do this before. You always had to have like an LP token. You weren't able to read the contract. So nobody really wanted to get a role to just be like, hey, I'm holding an LP token, I want to farm this, so I want to be able to use this. So I was really excited that that was a feature that they brought out and yeah, we had like 1400 people I think at peak for that one. So pretty cool to kind of get that exposure through, through guild. Yeah.
00:03:26.604 - 00:04:51.318, Speaker A: Then another thing that has that is now published is the foundation transparency report. So as promised, the foundation wanted to highlight a bunch of, just a bunch of like how the, how all this is working. So with Stargate rebalancing, for example, this is a key one here where over $89,000 worth of proto or new protocol owned liquidity was generated from the EQ reward. So over 25 million volume in December to keep Stargate balanced. So helping with that balancing to allow for just like better overall use for, you know, for anyone trying to utilize the protocol and going from different chain paths to chain paths. And of course this is just making it far more efficient and this will continue to accrue value that is going directly to the protocol and that can all be found if you want to look further into this and just see like how all this is working and if you've got any questions, comments, concerns around it, you know, we can follow up on that in, in Commonwealth but yeah, that all can be found in the foundation section in Commonwealth and that will be published monthly just to keep, you know, keep the community fully informed and involved and yeah, see it like how, you know, what that's actually doing for. Yeah, for the protocol.
00:04:51.318 - 00:05:53.830, Speaker A: So pretty cool stuff there. And then another one, which some of you may or may not have noticed yet was a rage trade integration with Stargate. So yeah, that was just announced this morning here and I think we've got Viper, are you up here? Let's see which, which one is Viper? You plan it to come up here? Give us 1 second here. We're going to try and bring them in from spaces. I'm hoping this works. We sure can. I hope the people in discord can hear you.
00:05:53.830 - 00:05:56.310, Speaker A: You can hear me though. That's what's important.
00:05:56.382 - 00:05:57.110, Speaker B: I can hear you.
00:05:57.182 - 00:06:07.554, Speaker A: Amazing. Amazing. So yeah, just so you. So you know, here we are in spaces, we are in discord, and we are live streaming to YouTube and twitch all at the same time. So that's kind of what we got going on right now.
00:06:08.614 - 00:06:09.630, Speaker B: Wow, that's awesome.
00:06:09.742 - 00:06:19.964, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. So. Yeah, well, Viper, thank you very much for. For coming up here today and some exciting news here with Rage trade and Stargate. So please take it away.
00:06:20.904 - 00:07:13.476, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So for those of you who don't know me, my name is Viper and I'm head of BD at Ravetrade. And for those who are not familiar with rage trade, Rage trade is a earth, ETH, perp and perp product platform. And essentially what we've done is, besides our ETH platform, we've also started to implement perp products such as our Delta neutral GLP vault, which have been live for a little over a month. And actually, we just announced a little earlier today that we have a couple new products coming out that are a little deviation to Delta neutral for those who want some exposure to eat. But of course, today kind of showed that maybe some people still want the Delta neutral with the market dumping a little bit. But yeah, no, we're super excited.
00:07:13.476 - 00:08:12.674, Speaker B: We just pushed out the official integration tweet and so we are really, really excited to officially integrate with Stargate. We are an omnichain east perp. And so basically what this integration entails is you're soon going to be able to, with the click of a button, move from a Stargate compatible chain directly into our vault with one click. So just like how most of you guys use Stargate as your official bridge, it's super simple and very cheap to use. You'll soon be able to, with the click of a button, go from USDC, which is currently our 2 volts right now, except USDC and VLP. Both of them take USDC, one of them takes GLP. So with this integration, you'll be able to take a Stargate compatible chain, such as, let's just say ethereum, since we are a vault on arbitrum.
00:08:12.674 - 00:08:21.754, Speaker B: And you'll be able to, with the click of a button, go from USDC on east directly into the vault. So beautiful. Gonna be super cool. I'm really, really excited.
00:08:21.874 - 00:08:43.984, Speaker C: And I think that's so cool because what it's really the vision of people composing on top of Stargate, the fact that a user doesn't have to bridge and then do another action they can, via the rage trade website, empowered by Stargate, just with one click, move funds from one chain to another and interact with your protocol is just like, so cool.
00:08:45.044 - 00:09:13.856, Speaker B: Yeah, it's amazing. I mean, Stargate technology, not only amazing, but it's also very efficient. And so, you know, we're really, really excited for this integration because who better than to integrate with Stargate? Kind of the king of Bridges right now. And so for a user to be able to just, with a click of a button, just like you said, bypass having to do a few manual interactions is really, really cool and very efficient, which I'm always a fan of.
00:09:13.880 - 00:09:29.054, Speaker C: Efficiency 100%. When I look at your vaults on the Ray Troy website, they look to be full. So when can users actually use this feature and deposit? And when will there be more capacity for the Stargate community to interact with the product itself?
00:09:30.074 - 00:10:12.074, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. So, currently we have a $10 million cap DbL for security purposes. Essentially, what we want to do is lead by example. And so we're strong believers in security first. And so what we've done is, although we currently have about $40 million in lp commitment alone, just in the private lp commitments, non excluding communities, what we've done is when we first launched, we did a $10 million soft cap CVO, and we purchased maximum smart contract exploit insurance in Sherlock, which is about 6 million. And we've decided that we want to scale with our audit. So we have one audit done by Sherlock.
00:10:12.074 - 00:10:50.644, Speaker B: And so we felt comfortable enough to launch $10 million soft cap from day one with $6 million in smart contract exploit insurance as well as one audit under our belt. Now, this month, we're currently undergoing an audit with y academy, the yearn guy. Great people. And so that audit will be done by this month. And so by the end of this month, post second audit, we will increase the cap by another 10 million and so on and so forth. So we want to scale with our audit. So we don't, you know, we will not feel comfortable just removing the offset, despite the crazy demand we already have.
00:10:50.644 - 00:11:12.410, Speaker B: And so not until at least our third audit will we, you know, wait for scaling. So, once we have at least three audits done, then we feel more comfortable with scaling the soft gap. But that's the current plan. Now, I will say when we launched, the vault filled out in quite literal seconds.
00:11:12.482 - 00:11:13.090, Speaker A: Wow.
00:11:13.242 - 00:11:51.482, Speaker B: And essentially what we do is we allocate a fraction of it to our private lp to fill and then a fraction of it for the community to fill. And this is just because that $40 million in LP command commitment demand is so strong, we want to at least carve out, you know, a fair portion of it to community and so it's much easier to onboard large commitments privately instead of having them compete with the general community. And so we're doing our best to let everyone get their fair share. But yeah, that's kind of our plan.
00:11:51.578 - 00:12:02.592, Speaker C: That's awesome. And I think we'll look forward to seeing a lot of LP get deposited via Stargate and via this integration. I think that that's exciting for everybody here and thanks so much for coming and talking about it.
00:12:02.688 - 00:12:03.912, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you very much. Vibrant.
00:12:03.968 - 00:12:04.928, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:12:05.016 - 00:12:16.524, Speaker A: No exciting stuff and looking forward to checking it out and yeah, if anybody has questions or looking to find you guys. Yeah, if you want to just give your socials and your website.
00:12:17.704 - 00:12:50.660, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's raid trade and then social should be raid, underscore trademark yes on Twitter. And you can find our discord on our Twitter rage underscore trade and the discord should be on our Twitter page. And yeah, we're super active in the discord. Come on in. If you have any questions, concerns, whatever, feel free to open up a ticket. We have, you know, try to be 24/7 support, so we have, you know, a nice staff team to address any concerns you may have or any questions you have.
00:12:50.792 - 00:12:53.780, Speaker A: Awesome. Alrighty. Thank you very, very much.
00:12:53.972 - 00:12:55.372, Speaker B: Thanks, Max. Appreciate it.
00:12:55.468 - 00:13:26.168, Speaker A: All right. Okay, moving on here to proposals. Yeah, so we just recently had the. There was the. We talked about it last week here as well that we had, we had the. Sorry, just give me 1 second here. Yeah, we had the reunit airdrop.
00:13:26.168 - 00:13:46.144, Speaker A: So that was coming out from golden name there, of course. Yeah, so there was like a lot of. There was 10,000 votes that had come across there. So that was pretty incredible. It looked like option one was the favorite. And of course, you know, just looking forward to seeing like what that team, you know, plans to bring forward. Forward here for next steps.
00:13:46.144 - 00:13:55.140, Speaker A: But, yeah, great to see that, you know, wanting to engage the Stargate community around that, you know. Absolutely. Yeah. Seems pretty cool.
00:13:55.252 - 00:14:12.824, Speaker C: I think it's super exciting as well, that integral to the wallet that they're building is Stargate. So everything within the wallet runs through Stargate. And I think that that's a really great deep integration for the product itself and hopefully the wallet will gain traction, adoption and that will drive usage for Stargate as well.
00:14:12.884 - 00:14:13.352, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:14:13.408 - 00:14:14.160, Speaker C: Always excited.
00:14:14.272 - 00:14:26.204, Speaker A: Yeah, that part's very, very cool. And yeah, anything that can be done to, you know, help scale out the ecosystem and utilize and leverage each other. Putting all these lego pieces together is always beautiful and what it can all build.
00:14:27.064 - 00:15:32.594, Speaker C: Absolutely. There are a number of other proposals that have recently gone up on Commonwealth that that I want to highlight and I think the community needs to give feedback on and decide what to do around. The first is that the Stargate Foundation a couple days ago was approached by an individual representing a family office that was looking to purchase a block of STG from the protocol itself and they approached the foundation. The foundation felt the appropriate thing to do, and always is to bring it forward to the community where the community can decide how to handle the request, what to do and how this should actually be taken care of. It's flattering that somebody wants to join the community at size and scale and create long term alignment with Stargate itself. There's a temperature check vote and the facts of the situation that are posted Commonwealth and anytime the foundation is approached, the facts and that will be put on Commonwealth so that the community can have full transparency, full set of information, decide what the correct thing to do. Here is.
00:15:32.594 - 00:16:45.160, Speaker C: There's just a call out to engage with that, to have your voice heard. Do you want to do this? What should Stargate Dao do? And you know, please, please come voice your opinion. There is a proposal for SiP 26 that recently went up which is switching the validation library that Stargate uses as in its underlying architecture, from MPT validation to featherproof validation. The technical details are within the post, but the exciting thing about it is that it would allow for a more constant gas prices and significantly cheaper gas prices on Stargate for the end user. And this would be a reduction of at least 20% in terms of the gas that the end user pays when using Stargate. And for everyone. Like I use Stargate frequently, so that's exciting to me to pay less gas when interacting with the protocol, but it also has a bigger sort of ripple effect, which is when the aggregators are pricing Stargate versus other bridges.
00:16:45.160 - 00:17:24.694, Speaker C: Gas cost is a factor that's considered and it contributes to how Stargate gets routed through all the different aggregators. So lowering Stargate's gas costs makes Stargate more competitive and will end up with Stargate winning a higher share of aggregator volume, and that will result in more volume for Stargate, more fees for Stargate in the community and an overall better experience for people using Stargate. So I'm excited about this proposal personally, again looking for feedback on it as it just went up to Commonwealth and would love to hear what, what the community thinks. I see that Mister Tangle has given his thoughts on it already there. On Commonwealth.
00:17:24.774 - 00:18:03.824, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And I mean, anything we can do here to reduce gas costs, I know that's one of the main things that's coming in with people with even just small amounts of. You're looking to just transfer a small amount. The gas prices are just really turning people off. And we want to be able to try and see as many people using Stargate as possible and being able to have that gas price lower if that's going to be the deciding factor for people, getting that lower is better. And keeping the security behind this, too. Like, I believe featherproof is just as, if not more secure or, I mean, I don't even know if there's anything around security with it.
00:18:03.864 - 00:18:30.704, Speaker C: I think. I think it keeps the best in class security. The Stargate has properties while just making it better, frankly. And it's something that's been running on layer zero and other pieces for months now without an issue, moving volume through other products. And it's something that I think the Stargate community should seriously explore doing. That's my personal opinion and look forward to seeing the feedback the community has on it.
00:18:30.784 - 00:18:48.754, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Awesome. Awesome. So, yeah, if you are interested in lower gas, please hop over to Commonwealth and share your thoughts and do a little reading on featherproof and, you know, and merkle trees and everything and just how this will all work.
00:18:49.254 - 00:19:30.026, Speaker C: I know that sometimes people hear that and their eyes like glaze over on the technical details, but I think the thing to highlight is the end result of the security properties are the same, the gas cost is lower and it makes target more competitive. So that's exciting to see. One other update and I think that this is important. Would love to have people engage in and we'll take sort of questions and hands and all that stuff after. This is Sip 25, which was a revised proposal around a request from the foundation to find a market maker. Did not ask quorum. So it did pass in terms of sentiment vote.
00:19:30.026 - 00:20:24.568, Speaker C: A majority of the community said, hey, we'd like to do this, but did not hit the voting thresholds that were, that are there to safeguard Stargate and the protocol. Make sure that there's alignment within that the community. I think we'd love to hear feedback from all of you about what wasn't liked or what wasn't clear there. I think that there are a couple things to point out which we had, which was which we had heard during the proposal. And I saw in Commonwealth, when I was reading through Commonwealth, one was that there was some. There was some ambiguity or lack of clarity in and around the actual strike price of the option that the market makers would be given, and it was set at a minimum of $0.80. In reality, the terms the foundation received, a lot of them were significantly better than that.
00:20:24.568 - 00:21:21.338, Speaker C: But when you look at market makers, a lot of them don't want to expose their pricing because it's a competitive edge as part of their secret sauce that allows them to work within the market. So there was a request around marketing integrity and to not expose that data. So there were broad parameters there, but would love to hear feedback in and around that. And I think it's worth noting again that the Stargate foundation has been approached by a number of exchanges that Stargate is listed on. Complaining in a post FTX world that spreads are continually getting wider, so the things are getting more illiquid. And when that happens, there is tail risk that presents itself, that if that continues to persist, that some exchanges will deprioritize or potentially delist tokens that are within that sort of framework. So that's what the foundation has been working to try to mitigate.
00:21:21.338 - 00:21:41.366, Speaker C: And at the end of the day, it's really up to the community and you guys about what you want to do there, but want to make sure that there's full transparency around everything there. So we'd love to hear feedback from everybody in around any of these proposals. Sip 25 Featherproof this OTC request put your hand up and let's have a conversation as a community.
00:21:41.550 - 00:22:14.924, Speaker A: Yeah, let's see some hands here. We've got one over. Oh, there was one in Twitter, but it is gone now. All right, let's click through here if we've got. Oh, we have some stuff coming in here from the AMA text questions as well. All right, staking, what is the team currently think about the APY of 8.37%? Do you think it's attractive to stake StG?
00:22:17.024 - 00:22:52.580, Speaker C: Sure, I can answer both these. Wef asked about staking and said the, you know, he feels that the current APY is too low. The Apy shown is a average Apy. So the APY received for locking your Stargate for longer will be higher. For locking your Stargate for a short time, maybe, maybe lower. The APY is just a mathematical function of fees generated and amount of VestG staked itself. The community voted for a specific amount to be allocated to Vestg.
00:22:52.580 - 00:23:43.530, Speaker C: I think as we as a community think about what the future of Stargate is, finding different ways to have Stargate StG Incorporated. The product is something that I think would be a great community conversation and something that everyone needs to do a little bit of thinking of. And. And I'm here to engage and I know Tangle is and Primo is, and we're here to talk about what the future of that looks like and how Stargate thrives and everybody within the community thrives as well. For the last snapshot, there were 70,000 voters. But two whales decide what would happen, what's going to be done about it. I mean, we see this in most communities where there are certain people with large numbers of votes and they've accumulated that share and therefore vote with it.
00:23:43.530 - 00:24:15.954, Speaker C: I think that hopefully, with feedback from you guys in the community in and around sip 25, there can be the right mix of whatever those people are looking for to give confidence to move forward. So I think it's really to answer that. It's really about collecting feedback from you and the rest of the community in and around what else needs to be there and what needs to change in the proposal to make it palatable.
00:24:18.054 - 00:24:31.914, Speaker A: Yeah. Hopefully that helps you there. Wef, I do appreciate you coming up and speaking up. You're a very active member of our community. I do appreciate that. And, yeah, I'm glad to hear you, you know, voicing concerns around these sorts of things. So that's great.
00:24:31.914 - 00:24:53.194, Speaker A: Um. Yeah, yeah. When it comes to governance, it's, uh, it's a tricky landscape sometimes, but, uh. Yeah. Um. I'm also trying to bring up a few people here to speak and discord. Not sure if it was just sometimes people like to click, but, um.
00:24:53.194 - 00:25:11.014, Speaker A: Yeah, I've got a few invites coming in here. And of course, if there's anything else, the text questions channel is available in discord. We've got Tanvir. You got something for us, Tanvir?
00:25:13.474 - 00:25:17.934, Speaker B: Yes. My country is Bangladesh, my english not.
00:25:18.674 - 00:25:24.234, Speaker A: It's okay. Go ahead, do your best. Appreciate you coming up here.
00:25:25.054 - 00:25:26.594, Speaker B: This project is good.
00:25:30.054 - 00:26:00.894, Speaker A: Thank you. Yeah. Do you have a question around the. Around Stargate or how the protocol is running or some of the stuff that we've discussed? All good. If not, I do appreciate you coming up here, but we can let. If Massoud, if you've got something for us as well. No.
00:26:02.634 - 00:26:25.486, Speaker C: I think it's important to note, too. If you don't feel comfortable coming up and speaking on our community calls, there's the text channel as well. But you can also create an account anonymously on Commonwealth voice, your opinion, feedback. You can create general discussions. It's there as a space for everybody, as a community, to talk and engage. And, I mean, I think it's. We'd encourage everybody to.
00:26:25.486 - 00:26:29.966, Speaker C: To engage and help and help build the best stargate we can together as a community.
00:26:30.070 - 00:26:58.734, Speaker A: Absolutely. And, you know, whether you want to come into, you know, the voice text channel right now, if, you know, if you want to use that instead of. Instead of voice, that's, that's totally cool too. We'll try and surface that just like we did here with Weft's question. And then there's also like the governance discussion chat in discord where, you know, bring that in and all that stuff can be, you know, around governance and, and that kind of stuff. So, crypto Khufu, you got something for us?
00:27:00.954 - 00:27:09.254, Speaker D: Oh, yeah. I was just wondering if you guys could speak to reunite wallet.
00:27:10.354 - 00:27:11.210, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:11.402 - 00:27:15.254, Speaker C: So with reunit, what about it specifically?
00:27:17.234 - 00:27:28.402, Speaker D: I was just. If you guys are. It's something you're like endows or like, it's illegit, like easy related to your protocol.
00:27:28.538 - 00:27:28.882, Speaker C: Sure.
00:27:28.938 - 00:27:34.582, Speaker D: And then about the upcoming pre sell, is there. Is there something you can talk about it?
00:27:34.678 - 00:28:00.332, Speaker C: Yeah, so the. The wallet itself is created by a community member here in the Stargate community who's, who's contributed to the Stargate community, who's created SDG scan, which is a community run explorer for Stargate. And he's been fairly active within the Stargate community. He's been building this wallet for. For quite a bit of time. We can't really comment on whether the presales a good idea or a bad idea. I mean, that's a.
00:28:00.332 - 00:28:32.484, Speaker C: That's a decision that's not related to Stargate. It is not an official stargate product, but it's built on top of Stargate using Stargate. And they've decided to airdrop part of their supply to STG holders, which is flattering and shows that people see value in people holding SG in the community here. I'm personally excited to see the wallet come out and play around with it, but in terms of any economics around it, we can't really comment and have no insight into that, that we can share, unfortunately.
00:28:35.224 - 00:28:39.044, Speaker A: Hopefully that covers it for you there. Any further. Anything else?
00:28:40.704 - 00:28:57.286, Speaker D: No, no, that's okay. I just wanted to know if you guys actually have some sort of inclination to it or it's just. I know it's a different projects on building, but I just want to know if you guys. Yeah, some sort of endos it, but.
00:28:57.310 - 00:29:03.846, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, hopefully that. Yeah, that's kind of what we know and what we can share about it.
00:29:03.870 - 00:29:34.554, Speaker C: And the proposal. They put up a proposal and asked for some community feedback which, which a ton of you have given in and around our forums. It's great to see somebody coming, engaging our community like that. And I, and I hope to see more information posted. I mean, they've been posting information about building this for literally about a year now, almost as a, like pretty much since Stargate's launch. They said, hey, we're building this or bring it forward. So it's been really cool to see a community built project come forward on top of Stargate.
00:29:34.554 - 00:29:47.614, Speaker C: So I think, like, Commonwealth has always been the starting point for discussion and for information on how that interacts with Stargate. So that's where I would personally, that's where I'm personally tracking to see what. What happens there.
00:29:47.694 - 00:30:09.314, Speaker A: Yeah, names me great about bringing it up there and, yeah, just keep. Keep posted there and like, yeah, like we were mentioning too. Like, this is something that names been discussing for, yeah, better part of a year at this point. So, yeah, follow up with. With him. You can keep. If you're gonna follow up on Twitter as well, maybe keep a little more posted there.
00:30:09.314 - 00:30:20.454, Speaker A: Okay. Who else have we got up here? We have amadoul and Fairmontel. Either of you have something for us?
00:30:22.874 - 00:30:23.562, Speaker C: Hello.
00:30:23.698 - 00:30:24.210, Speaker A: Hi.
00:30:24.322 - 00:30:24.698, Speaker C: Welcome.
00:30:24.746 - 00:30:24.882, Speaker B: Hi.
00:30:24.898 - 00:30:25.674, Speaker E: How are you doing, guys?
00:30:25.794 - 00:30:27.814, Speaker A: Doing great. Doing great. How are you?
00:30:29.434 - 00:31:08.734, Speaker E: Yeah, I have a question about gas, you know, gas fees, because even with that 20% that you're going to reduce the gas fees is still going to be expensive or more expensive than the other bridges. The team has the idea to match those gas fees without losing security. Because I read the last discussion that you had with Lifi and sounds to me interesting because they are cheaper and I think it's a great risk. I use it all the time, but I use Stargate too. But the prices, you know, the gas fees are really different. So you try to match or you wouldn't try to match at some point or not.
00:31:08.814 - 00:31:27.996, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think. I think that a 20% reduction is a starting point with featherproof, as noted. In some cases, it will reduce gas up to 90%. It'll make. It'll make Stargate much more competitive. But we're researching or a number of ways to continually lower the gas cost of Stargate.
00:31:27.996 - 00:32:19.692, Speaker C: Stargate uses a little bit more gas because it does verification and the actual security on chain. While some of the other bridges are basically a black box. You put, you put money into, it goes into this black box and then the black box says, yeah, this is a good transaction, and then send it to the person. And it's cheaper to execute that. But you, we feel the Stargate design and the fact that everything is done on chain is inherently more secure. And I think when you're looking at what you want in the bridge that you use or the bridge that you build on top of security is one of the most important things. But that being said, I think this is noted feedback and something that I'm aware of and the other people that think about Stargate a good amount are aware of and something that is being actively explored in how to reduce this and make it more competitive.
00:32:19.692 - 00:32:27.144, Speaker C: So I don't have a firm answer, but it is something that will be continually explored and continually improved upon.
00:32:31.244 - 00:32:40.384, Speaker A: I'm just going to mute them for a second there. Yes, hopefully that helps you there. But yeah, it's definitely something that's actively being looked at.
00:32:41.324 - 00:33:09.314, Speaker E: Yeah, just because, just the last part I want to say is the fee kind of like attract customers. I know that security is really important because everybody's happy paying low fees until they lose their money. But yeah, my question is more like when this crypto space comes massive, the gas piece I think is going to be kind of like the main trigger to customers use any kind of project.
00:33:09.654 - 00:33:53.888, Speaker C: I think, I don't know that I necessarily agree there. I think gas fees are going to continually be driven down. And as things scale, I think that security and composability are going to be two of the most important things. So the idea that, you know, as you pointed out, the idea that you know that when you use something, you're not going to lose your money. It's, it's great to save a dollar here and there until, as you said, something goes wrong and you lose all your money. And I think when you look at ecosystems choosing bridges to build as well, you want to use something that you know is inherently secure so that your ecosystem doesn't get set back entirely if you use a third party bridge. And I hope, and I hope that people see Stargate as a leader there.
00:33:53.888 - 00:34:17.914, Speaker C: But again, without going into exact specifics, I would expect to see continued optimization in and around gas cost on Stargate and continually dropping as new solutions are architected. And that would be seen in new SIP proposals brought forward to the community around what would need to be done.
00:34:19.174 - 00:35:06.646, Speaker A: But yeah, in short though, fair Montel. Yeah, obviously gas looking towards what Stargate can do to lower those gas prices to be more competitive. And as Max pointed out earlier on here, the aggregators picking that up as well, because even arbitrary transactions that weren't necessarily coming directly to Stargate finance to actually perform that transaction, being able to pick those ones up when people are going to Lefi or Bungie or wherever else it is that routing through there. That's just that Stargate would normally not have. We won't be able to pick that up too. We definitely want to see that, um, come across as well. So that's, yeah, the, the aggregator, you know, comp or the competitive, the competitive advantage with uh, aggregators is a big one too.
00:35:06.646 - 00:35:52.134, Speaker A: So now thank you for bringing this up. And, you know, this little. I'm sure this is going to pique some ears and help, uh, help help with the. Driving these gas costs down. Thank you. All right, have you got something for us? And there was section Norma, either of you have something for us? It's up on stage and I do see one more hand. Goldman will follow up here with Goldman and see if they've got something for us.
00:35:52.134 - 00:36:27.674, Speaker A: Otherwise, probably wrap it up. And of course any last questions here coming in from the voice text channel, feel free to do so. But yeah, I think that's. Oh hello. Go ahead. You got something? Okay, yeah, if you've got something for us in English. Unfortunately I only speak one language natively.
00:36:27.674 - 00:36:29.438, Speaker A: Have you got something?
00:36:29.526 - 00:36:30.194, Speaker B: Oh.
00:36:34.534 - 00:36:41.710, Speaker A: All right. If not, that's fine. If you want to just follow up in the text questions, that could be great. But yeah, I think that's probably a.
00:36:41.822 - 00:36:46.586, Speaker C: Good, a good place to segue to one, a final announcement and then we'll wrap up.
00:36:46.610 - 00:36:47.218, Speaker A: Yeah, call.
00:36:47.266 - 00:37:34.540, Speaker C: So I think it's, it's super exciting that, you know, you, you guys are all the first to know that in just under 24 hours. So at the same time, our community called normally launches 09:00 a.m. Pacific time tomorrow Metis will be live for Stargate. So that will be live in the world. Lp pools will launch for USDT across multiple chains supporting transfers to and from Metis with rewards in native Metis tokens. So no SG mission thanks to the grant from the Metis foundation. And there will also be transfer rewards given out to basically rebate back to six basis points when moving to and from Metis.
00:37:34.540 - 00:38:26.926, Speaker C: The way that will work is that every two weeks there will be a calculation and a distribution sent on Metis to wallets. I've interacted with the metas chain from Stargate so it makes bridging in essence quote unquote free to and from Metis itself to go and explore that ecosystem. And we're incredibly excited that Stargates expands its first new chain. So that'll be the 8th chain that Stargate supports and we're really excited to see that go live at 09:00 a.m. Pacific noon Eastern tomorrow and excited to have everybody come and explore it and more people able to use and build on top of Stargate. And have Stargate opened up to all of the builders on top of metis to compose on top of and really build an omnichannel future.
00:38:27.070 - 00:39:04.344, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. No, it's great to see another network open up on Stargate. The first one here is, Max pointed out, that has gone since original launch. And I think that's like a good, you know, it's a good milestone to just show that, like, yes, this is possible. These things come up to the, you know, come to the forum or, you know, come to Commonwealth. And, hey, yet is this something the community wants to be able to like, push this forward? And yes, there's, you know, as we can all see here, more and more chains can be added to Stargate, ultimately having, you know, as many of. As many of the layer zero supported networks as possible that, you know, make sense here for liquidity and everything.
00:39:04.344 - 00:39:14.104, Speaker A: But, yeah, this is really cool. This is wonderful to see. And the grant just like go and explore and get rebated to check it all out.
00:39:14.144 - 00:39:41.064, Speaker C: So, yeah, it's incredibly exciting, and hopefully it's a starting point for other chains that want Stargate there to come and say, here's how we want to support Stargate and bring it to our ecosystem in a way that accrues value for the protocol. And it's exciting for the protocol itself. So also worth keeping an eye out because there will be, you know, there'll be new pools that have rewards on them. And I know that some of the farmers within our community will be interested in those.
00:39:41.884 - 00:39:57.658, Speaker A: Yes. Yes. All right. I do see one more or one new hand here just in case. Dia, if you got something for us just as we wrap up here, maybe it's a question about Metis. Yes. No.
00:39:57.658 - 00:40:17.014, Speaker A: If not, you can bring it into the voice text channel, of course. But, yeah. So anyways, super excited about midas tomorrow. Keep your eyes and ears out for that. There'll be some announcements, of course, when. When it does go live, but everyone here has kind of got the. The early, the early notifications, so thanks for trying, or thanks for tuning in for that.
00:40:17.014 - 00:41:07.374, Speaker A: But yeah, of course we'll wrap up here. This has been, yeah, obviously has been streaming over to YouTube, so you'll be able to follow up on this afterwards and review it here if you caught part of it or if you want to share it with a friend or whatever. And yeah, thanks, everybody, for tuning in on Twitter spaces as well. I hope that this has been a seamless experience as we're trying to broadcast all the platforms at once. And, yeah, unfortunately, there will not be a PO app today revamping some new ideas here on how we reward, on rewarding community members here for participating in these community calls. So I do apologize for that. But I know we've, it's been kind of a contentious, yeah, kind of been contentious here about people trying to grab it and harp hunters and farmers and everything.
00:41:07.374 - 00:41:31.494, Speaker A: So, yeah, we'll keep you posted on that. Hopefully we have something dialed in for next community call. But other than that, please just head over to YouTube to watch it. Like, subscribe there. And if you have further questions, comments, concerns, bring it over into Commonwealth. Yeah. Always want to hear and get all the opinions from people.
00:41:31.494 - 00:41:56.346, Speaker A: Any new ideas and innovative things that you can see that can help Stargate grow as a protocol. That's what that space is for. And of course, discord, make sure you're coming in there. If you're over in Twitter and you haven't joined our discord, please do so. Just Stargate finance discord, and that'll get you in over there. So thanks, everyone. We will see you all in a couple of weeks.
00:41:56.346 - 00:41:57.394, Speaker A: All right. Ciao. Ciao.
