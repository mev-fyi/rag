00:00:02.440 - 00:00:39.894, Speaker A: Welcome to the Stargate finance community call, where we discuss proposals and ideas that will help shape and govern the Stargate protocol. Feel free to join the conversation on stage anytime. If you have a question by clicking on the raise hand button. I think it now might be at the top of the screen. Discord's made some changes. If you are in Twitter spaces, though, please request to speak there and we'll get you up as well. Yeah, and if for any of those that are wanting to chime in via text, there is the AMA text questions or through YouTube or through Twitch, you are able to ask questions as those are all aggregating there and we should be able to keep an eye on them.
00:00:39.894 - 00:01:07.892, Speaker A: And yeah, then again, live streaming to YouTube and Twitch. So if you're there, be sure to subscribe and like. And yeah, again, this is just a reminder that none of this is financial, accounting, or legal advice, so please do your own research. Okay. One of the biggest, I guess, like, exciting things that we've had here was sushi x swap. Of course we had. Yeah, had the sarong on on Monday, and I do see him here in the audience again.
00:01:07.892 - 00:01:37.494, Speaker A: I am going to poke him and see if he can come up here and kind of chat a little bit more about sushi x swap. If any of you didn't get a chance to chime in on Monday. But, yeah, really, really stoked on being able to, like, do exactly what we've been wanting to do. One of these early showcases of sushi X swap. We're seeing some volume behind it now. More and more people are starting to see it. And I think, like, you guys are even working sarong, you guys are saying, like, even making some more things a little more efficient too, or some plans with that as well.
00:01:37.494 - 00:01:41.294, Speaker A: Yeah. How are things looking here? So how are things?
00:01:42.314 - 00:01:42.770, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:01:42.802 - 00:01:43.346, Speaker A: Hey, everyone.
00:01:43.450 - 00:02:19.530, Speaker C: I was just listening, but yeah, so basically we are adding, like, ETH is a collateral type. We were just testing it, few things on that side and so that, you know, like, users don't have to do an unnecessary swap for it. The other thing we're gonna do is like, you know, tune in the gas prices. Now we have, like, a better understanding on how different gases work on different networks. So the swaps from, you know, the gas estimation would also be much cheaper. And then we have added four new modules on top of it for Kashi, Fiuro and Miso. So basically what you can do is, like, you can now directly interact.
00:02:19.530 - 00:02:51.078, Speaker C: I mean, it's still not hooked up with the UI. It's gonna release with our sushi 2.0. But yeah, like what we were talking about yesterday, it's done by today and we'll start the testing for that like in like next week. So, yeah, you can basically, you know, add collateral to cache from any chain or take out the furrows, you know, like the streams to any, any different chain that you want to. And all powered by Stargate and sousake swap in the underlying. Awesome. Not a lot of updates from yesterday.
00:02:51.126 - 00:03:31.924, Speaker A: But yeah, yeah, no, that's cool though. Just really stoked on this, like, being this, these products, like, working together so well and just finding more and more use cases, you know, rather than just like, oh, here's like just the, you know, routing through a deck swap, which I mean, is still amazing and incredible, but like, to be able to find that there is more use case for this even throughout the product, like within the suite, you know, within defi suites, I guess is the way to actually look at it. So, you know, to have like, further and further integration with sushi. This is epic. And yeah, let's see what this. Where this can go with, you know, further, you know, adoption and volume and all that. So, yeah, glad to hear you guys are thinking positively about this and.
00:03:31.924 - 00:04:11.354, Speaker A: Yeah, and are excited to be building on top of it. Cool, cool. Well, yeah, we, like you're saying there with the ETH pools enabled or once you have those enabled, that's going to help with a lot of different things too. So, yeah, wicked, wicked. I don't know, has anybody got any questions wrong? Kind of hopped in and out there, but any questions for sushi x swap stuff while we've got sarong here. But yeah, if you do later on, feel free to pop them in or, you know, you can dm me or ask about that later. But overall, very pleased with what's happened there.
00:04:11.354 - 00:04:48.178, Speaker A: And actually, I'm just gonna open up this link. I know that Sarong, yeah, Sarong's just been working like a champ on all that. So thank you for all your hard work. Okay, and if for any of you that missed the AMA or, yeah, the AMA on Monday, head over to the Stargate finance YouTube and you'll be able to have that recap there. If you did miss it, you wanted to check that out. Next up was the op rewards. So yeah, obviously the no longer emitting StG on, on optimism right now.
00:04:48.178 - 00:05:34.080, Speaker A: So if you're lp ing over there, you are now, like, the op rewards are available. So those are the ones that we, you know, that Stargate had received from optimism through the optimism airdrop. So yeah, finally, you know, having that all into place and people farming over there now and being able to provide liquidity and get those incentives, obviously that's like, we want that. The less emissions we can have for Stargate, the better. And to start getting more traction and interest to optimism. Yeah, it seems like optimism is getting more and more traction and the last I looked, we were like maybe 6th or 7th in like one of the tvls across optimism. I'll have to double check on that one.
00:05:34.080 - 00:06:06.980, Speaker A: But, yeah, we're like, we're doing quite well as far as, yeah, as far as some of the applications on top of optimism. Yeah. And of course this, the migration that we did, hopefully if anybody did have to migrate their liquidity, hopefully that was like really sweet and simple. You know, want to be able to make these things as seamless as possible, any type of stuff. We want to have like a great UX and UI experience for, for all users when, you know, anything like this needs to happen. I was pretty impressed with it. It was just a couple clicks and off you went.
00:06:06.980 - 00:06:35.214, Speaker A: Be able to migrate right into the new contract. But, yeah, again, this is, we're emitting less STG. You know, this is like a pretty key thing here. So if we can, you know, capitalizing on this to be able to attract that liquidity that we need in order to sustain the protocol with less StG emissions. Yeah, this is, this is a win win, I think, for everybody. Yeah. Then, yeah.
00:06:35.214 - 00:06:48.204, Speaker A: Next up, I guess, is bribes. Maki, have you had a chance to look at these bribes and just kind of where we're at or what's the kind of the latest on, on our bribing?
00:06:49.144 - 00:07:28.508, Speaker D: Yes, hello, everyone. We are right now, like, since last time we did a small update, basically spent around like 150,000. This is extremely kind of low. For the past month, we have even had one round without any bribes at all just to see kind of how things were behaving. We're like around 2% APR with basically or current kind of holdings of CRV and so on. This is going well and, you know, like, so far, like nothing alarming or nothing to change. We've been bribing the convicts older this round, but we're gonna go back to CRV for the next few weeks.
00:07:28.508 - 00:07:37.824, Speaker D: We just had like a small kind of time, time issue. I was in holiday and so on. So anyways, this is, everything is going well on this, on this front.
00:07:38.144 - 00:07:55.044, Speaker A: Perfect, perfect. Okay. Yeah, glad to hear that. And yeah, we'll keep people updated as things come in. Or if people have question, yeah, we can go further with that. And then, yes, can I bribe someone to give me that cryptic tweet to answer? Well, we'll get there. We'll get there.
00:07:55.044 - 00:08:24.804, Speaker A: It was very cool to see some, some people deciphering the cryptic message, you know, from. From Twitter there. But you're getting close. All right. Yeah. And then, of course, just, like, seeing the TVL and where we're at here last, I looked, like yesterday, I saw, like, over 40 million was in, like, ETH pools right now. So that is growing incredibly.
00:08:24.804 - 00:09:13.808, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, that's one of, like, the deepest places for liquidity across. For ETH, I think, across the ecosystem. So we're creating, like, really great ways, especially to come back from optimism or arbitrum back to mainnet, being able to have that as a really solid option for people to use and not waiting that seven days and, yeah, just a ton of depth of liquidity. Very pleased to see that happening. Yeah. And then as far as proposals, one that was kind of came up here, and it's kind of interesting here in regards to, like, optimism and how we've been kind of thinking about things and, yeah, looking at optimism as it's growing and whatnot.
00:09:13.808 - 00:09:38.952, Speaker A: But, yeah, like, the velodrome post here about, you know, saying, using that as, like, the main decks for liquidity now. Yeah, this kind of brings in some interesting ideas here. You know, with, right now, the current liquidity is on. Is on uniswap. That v three position is not concentrated or anything. It's a. I don't know what you call it.
00:09:38.952 - 00:10:03.914, Speaker A: Like, a full range position. So it's not as obviously as capital efficient as it could be. But, yeah, it would require management to deal with that. So I don't know, when we look at, you know, velodrome, they've kind of got, like, the bribes and, you know, everything else within that whole ecosystem, but, yeah, we didn't, you know, and, maki, maybe you can speak to this one some more here. Obviously, your post kind of discussed this with.
00:10:04.454 - 00:10:49.226, Speaker D: So basically, like, I just saw, like, the villager proposal, I think it's kind of interesting on optimism. And, you know, we're always trying to make sure the DAo is kind of, I don't know, like, optimize and so on. On all their position. All these positions and so on. Videodrome kind of, you know, like, since we're not a launch partner, we're kind of falling a little bit behind what everyone else that, you know, kind of got an NFT and so on and we would need to, like, kind of spend more stargate token to kind of get back into, I would say, like, the runner into, like, good position and so on. So I do feel like right now managing just one already is. Is a lot of work, I would say.
00:10:49.226 - 00:11:41.044, Speaker D: I think, you know, I was also exploring kind of archives, which is basically, like, from Gehto network, which is able to concentrate the liquidity and move the ranges kind of automatically whenever, like, they're outside of some specific kind of points. Let's describe that way. I'd interesting, they don't have any tokens, but they announced one. So potentially, like, the DAO could be eligible for an airdrop. This seems to me like a way more sane kind of approach. We would basically increase the efficiency of our Pol while potentially being able to be part of get some meta governance in the next Dao. Irks kind of keen to hear, like, what other community member are thinking.
00:11:41.044 - 00:11:59.384, Speaker D: On this sense. I am pretty kind of personally, like, neutral on this, but I just, I feel like whichever way we go, like, it cannot be worse than the current place where we are, like, full range doesn't seem to be, like, a good deal, in my opinion, for the current state of things.
00:12:00.644 - 00:12:35.024, Speaker A: Yeah. So if anything, like, being able to concentrate and deal with that, that is going to require some management. Even if we were to look at the uni v three position and then who should manage that? Or what is the best, most efficient way to do that? It may make sense. Yeah. Like, you're kind of proposing here one of these other protocols that could manage that for, you know, for the DAo. So that that does make a lot of sense to me. And, yeah, I'm not super familiar with Arrakis, but obviously they're fairly new and looking to do some cool stuff.
00:12:35.024 - 00:13:10.554, Speaker A: Yeah, that's cool that we were looking at that. I don't know if anybody else has had a chance to look at other, you know, other Dexs or other kind of, like, protocols within optimism that could make sense. But, you know, velodrome has gained a lot of attention. Would have been nice to have been a part, been a launch partner with them, but, yeah, that didn't seem to work out. But, yeah, perhaps looking to, like, align with new, with new, you know, new protocols and whatnot. Might. Might be kind of cool.
00:13:10.554 - 00:13:24.394, Speaker A: So, yeah, there's also. Oh, yeah. And then balancer. What about balancer? I've really looked at that too much. I don't know, maki, can you speak to that at all with, like, balancer on optimism?
00:13:28.454 - 00:14:05.746, Speaker D: I think that on optimism, it's a friendly fork called Beethoven X. I haven't looked into it, to be honest, that much. I really, like, binds around what they're up to. But I do think for optimism, like, so far, like, we could, we could go do, like, a 80 20 kind of pool to kind of have a little bit more liquidity on this front. But I don't really see kind of the, like, I feel like the, whatever work would be done over there wouldn't make a lot of sense. Maybe on Mainnet could make sense. We'll see.
00:14:05.746 - 00:14:21.494, Speaker D: Like, we have some collaboration with balancer coming up. So I guess once this is done, perhaps we can explore. Explore, like, a little bit more kind of partnership or collaboration from Pol side, but at the moment, nothing. Yeah.
00:14:22.714 - 00:14:42.470, Speaker A: Okay. All right. Yeah, well, this is some further stuff to explore here. And. Yeah, just looking at passive crypto here mentioned, like, so why would we need that? We got liquidity on other chains and not bribing any of them other than curve on main net. If you want to get set up on liquidity. Yeah, balancer is a better option.
00:14:42.470 - 00:15:11.294, Speaker A: So, yeah, that kind of stuff, you know, we've, yeah, we can explore things further here and see what's up. But, yeah, maybe if people have a chance, have a look at, you know, obviously we're bringing up Arrakis here. That's one that Maki pointed out. Have a take. Take a look at that. See if that makes sense. And, yeah, we can kind of dive into that further, but anywhere we can, you know, obviously make the Dow more, more efficient or more productive, I think is, you know, is going to be beneficial.
00:15:11.294 - 00:15:21.774, Speaker A: Yeah. Now, I do see some questions here again about Solana. Primo, are you able to, any updates on Solana?
00:15:23.594 - 00:15:27.954, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. We are in the final stages, I would say.
00:15:27.994 - 00:15:28.146, Speaker D: So.
00:15:28.170 - 00:16:05.436, Speaker B: There's probably already teams testing on the Solana Devnet right now for the layer zero side. Stargate will come after that is stable. So right now, we're going to be rolling out on top of a bunch of more evm chains. We're going to be rolling out on Solana, Aptos and sui. And I think the goal will be to sort of bring Stargate to those ecosystems. But as with everything, especially with everything that's happened lately with the hacks and the bridges, security first man, it just takes time. But 100% Solana is coming soon.
00:16:05.436 - 00:16:19.744, Speaker B: I would say, you know, maybe a month away from Mainnet. The code base is in audit right now. The layer zero code base is in audit for both Solana and Aptos. So that should tell you how far along it is.
00:16:20.844 - 00:16:53.360, Speaker A: Wicked. Yeah, that's a really good point about security, first that we're seeing so much, it's just continual. It seems obviously the layer zero approach is something that we're very believe in and see that that's a strong security model, but at the same time, any of that code stuff needs to be rigorously attested. Really glad to hear that. That's the main focus. So. Yeah.
00:16:53.360 - 00:17:07.016, Speaker A: Especially in this ecosystem. But yeah. So stay tuned, folks. There you have it. Hopefully it's sooner than later, but cool. Max, I see you're up here as well. Yeah.
00:17:07.016 - 00:17:12.124, Speaker A: Do you want to, have you got any emissions updates or how things are kind of looking that way on that front?
00:17:13.824 - 00:17:46.956, Speaker E: Yeah, no real emissions updates. Everything looks good there. Excited about optimism. Ran some numbers last week and given the current environment, the token price, the TVL targets that we have right now, we could last well over a year with Eopia rewards in terms of incentivizing liquidity on those chains. So that's super exciting. Great for the Dow. Other thing outside of emissions that I wanted to highlight is we have another very exciting integration coming soon, most likely within the next week.
00:17:46.956 - 00:17:49.664, Speaker E: So keep a lookout for that.
00:17:50.244 - 00:18:05.780, Speaker A: Awesome. All right. A little bit of small alpha leak on that. Cool, cool. Well, I don't know if anybody's got questions, comments, concerns here from either side. If you're in discord. Yeah, please give your, raise your hand.
00:18:05.780 - 00:18:32.896, Speaker A: Come on up. Or in Twitter if you just request to speak. If you've got any questions here. And then again, thanks for those who've been bringing them in via chat on and bringing them in via chat from Discord or YouTube or Twitch. But yeah, if not, yeah, feel free to. Of course we reach out in Discord. DM's are open.
00:18:32.896 - 00:19:12.996, Speaker A: And yeah, this will be posted up on YouTube so you can follow up and catch up on it afterwards. It's live streaming there now. And yeah, no, I just want to thank everybody for coming out and if you've been here for 1015 minutes, you will be eligible for a PO app. I saw somebody mentioning that from YouTube. If you're in YouTube, we need you to have you in discord in order to get that PO app. So we are working on ways of get making that reach out to other platforms, even the people who are in Twitter. I'm gonna try and get that dialed in for you too, so that you don't have to be hopping over in discord as well to get your PO app.
00:19:12.996 - 00:19:29.404, Speaker A: But yeah, for over in YouTube. Yeah, we'll get you sorted eventually. But, yeah, check it out on. Check this recording out on YouTube afterwards. And, yeah, we'll see you all in a couple of weeks. Thanks, everybody. Talk to you soon.
