00:00:31.754 - 00:01:15.102, Speaker A: All right, lots on the go here lately, of course. Pretty excited about the integration with Sushiswap. The Sushi X swap has went live on Thursday. It's been pretty cool and super seamless as far as how that all works. Really, really excited about that and just how well that's working now. Getting a lot of great feedback, even from the sushi community. A lot of people that are using it there, suggesting such a slick UI, and just even the developers are pretty stoked on it and far less issues than we were expecting.
00:01:15.102 - 00:01:17.766, Speaker A: When you're trying to put integration in like that, you kind of think like.
00:01:17.790 - 00:01:20.942, Speaker B: Oh, boy, this could be a little bit weird.
00:01:20.998 - 00:01:24.234, Speaker A: But no, it worked out great.
00:01:29.114 - 00:01:29.658, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:29.746 - 00:01:41.362, Speaker A: And then as far as. Yes, sarong was doing a demo about building on top of the bento box at ECC, and that's where he put that out and was like, okay, now.
00:01:41.378 - 00:01:44.714, Speaker B: We'Re gonna do, like, the cross chain swap.
00:01:44.754 - 00:02:03.082, Speaker A: I'm gonna show you this. And that was, like, the first one, I think, that actually went on. They just made that, put the. Put the site live, like, 20 minutes before his talk. So that was, like, super cool to just see him, like, all right, we're gonna try this. I think he went from avalanche to phantom, and it just happened in. It was, like, way faster than we were all expecting because it showed, like.
00:02:03.098 - 00:02:04.922, Speaker B: A little timer, and then it was.
00:02:04.938 - 00:02:31.098, Speaker A: Just done right away. So, yeah, everyone was, like, super stoked and impressed to see that happen. Live, like, in front of them is the very first live omni chain swap through sushi. So, yeah, really pleased with how that all played out. And of course, we're going to do a spotlight with them next week, so we'll have them on at some point. We'll keep you posted on that, but we'll be able to get the developers over here and get them to kind.
00:02:31.106 - 00:02:33.330, Speaker B: Of talk about their, you know, just.
00:02:33.362 - 00:02:42.346, Speaker A: Like, how it was integral, how the integrations went with it, and, you know, what they're seeing and how they liked, you know, utilizing and using Stargate and layer zero. So yeah, stay tuned on that.
00:02:42.370 - 00:02:45.066, Speaker B: We'll keep you posted for that.
00:02:45.210 - 00:02:45.466, Speaker C: Then.
00:02:45.490 - 00:03:12.054, Speaker A: As far as other integrations. Yeah, a couple other things that have been radiant, Chain X and Zunami. Yeah, those are some other ones that have been building on top. So radiant being kind of like a yield. Sorry, interest in borrowing assets, cross chains. So being able to do kind of, I guess like a borrowing aggregator. I think it's, from what I see now it's just on arbitrum.
00:03:12.054 - 00:03:16.074, Speaker A: But yeah, they're chipping away on some stuff and.
00:03:16.774 - 00:03:19.382, Speaker B: Yeah, so we had chain x and.
00:03:19.398 - 00:03:43.334, Speaker A: Tsunami, the other ones as well. Then of course, ECC happened last week. Yeah. For me personally it was really great. Do you have the. Seeing so many people at ECC and seeing kind of how conferences, how they are going and. Yeah, just to be able to present in front of a bunch of people was super cool.
00:03:44.034 - 00:03:44.386, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:44.410 - 00:04:02.044, Speaker A: A lot of people asking about Stargate and later Zero, which was pretty cool. And just even people that were unsure of and didn't really know, but yeah, they were able to learn more about it. So that was, that was fantastic.
00:04:03.064 - 00:04:03.464, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:03.504 - 00:04:07.688, Speaker B: And then we had, you know, a.
00:04:07.696 - 00:04:17.272, Speaker A: Lot of discussions with other teams and whatnot. We had, we did have a couple events that we had hosted as well. But yeah, the breakfast, we had done that with Stargate or.
00:04:17.288 - 00:04:17.416, Speaker C: Sorry.
00:04:17.440 - 00:04:46.864, Speaker A: Yes, Stargate did that with Sushi and with HBAR and yeah, that was like super successful to see like so many people show up to it. I really didn't know what to expect for a breakfast. And yeah, like a lot of people were there. There was like a huge lineup outside of the. Outside of the venue. So a lot of people chatting, a lot of people discussing. It was great to see so many people collaborating and like being present and yeah, that was right before Sarong's talk as well.
00:04:46.864 - 00:04:53.152, Speaker A: So little did they know that they were just about to experience just moments before the first cross chain swap was.
00:04:53.168 - 00:04:54.324, Speaker B: About to happen live.
00:04:54.944 - 00:04:55.724, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:56.134 - 00:05:15.154, Speaker A: So overall, I think ECC had a lot of great connections and whatnot. And just to have that in person communication, I think was super beneficial and super helpful so that people are able to understand a little bit more about what layer zero is up to. Stargate and built on layer zero, of course.
00:05:18.334 - 00:05:22.750, Speaker B: Then some other stuff here to discuss.
00:05:22.862 - 00:05:58.484, Speaker A: With the op tokens. We've got the 1 million have been to Stargate that has been delivered and that will then roll out the new emissions update after the Stargate on optimism runs out, which should be kind of beginning of the month. So early August here we'll keep you posted on when that swap will switch over to the op tokens. And yeah you will have to migrate your lp. So if you've got an lp, if you are lp ing on optimism, you will need to move over to the new, to the new staking contract.
00:05:59.464 - 00:05:59.776, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:05:59.800 - 00:06:41.524, Speaker A: So it shouldn't be too big of a deal. Easy enough. Now rewarding op tokens as compared to STG. So being able to have less op or sorry, less Stargate being emitted which is kind of helpful and obviously something that we want to work towards in order to keep our TVL and yeah being able to get op tokens into other people's hands. So perhaps even bringing more people into our new people into our ecosystem as well. Trying to drive more adoption for Stargate. So I think yeah, this is going to be a great little initiative and yeah we had like 700,000 is going to be used for, of the 1 million for the liquidity mining.
00:06:42.224 - 00:06:42.648, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:42.696 - 00:06:43.528, Speaker A: So that should be.
00:06:43.576 - 00:06:44.296, Speaker B: We'll keep posted.
00:06:44.320 - 00:06:45.524, Speaker A: We'll give you more info.
00:06:46.064 - 00:06:46.416, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:46.440 - 00:06:52.192, Speaker A: Just about like reminding you about the, about the migration that you'll need to do so that you can receive the.
00:06:52.208 - 00:06:55.424, Speaker B: Op tokens and kind of go from there.
00:06:57.524 - 00:06:57.948, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:57.996 - 00:06:58.584, Speaker B: Then.
00:07:00.284 - 00:07:49.690, Speaker A: Other stuff here we've got the foundation that's also been, the budget has been approved and yeah, so now we've got that set up and that's really designed to pay contributors and pay for audits, all that kind of stuff. Like obviously there's, as more and more development is happening within Stargate, need to be able to pay for audits and things like this and. Yeah, and the other part too is now like we're able to do things for like paying contributors. We want to have like more and more engagement here from the community and people that can help and like get involved with Stargate. And now, you know, this should become far more. Yeah, far easier and you know, really want to put towards, you know, some tasks on dwork. I really like that platform.
00:07:49.690 - 00:08:09.296, Speaker A: You know, I've talked about it before and now I really want to use that to leverage getting the community engaged. So there's currently one up right now for adding Zapper Studios to or. Yeah, adding Stargate into Zapper Studios and that's, by the sounds of it, I.
00:08:09.320 - 00:08:12.616, Speaker B: Think is like the user or.
00:08:12.640 - 00:08:15.024, Speaker A: Yes, or the contributor has just already.
00:08:15.144 - 00:08:19.918, Speaker B: Kind of has that close to completed. Yeah.
00:08:19.966 - 00:08:27.874, Speaker A: So that's pretty sweet. That's pretty sweet. That's either completed or is just approvals away or something.
00:08:28.254 - 00:08:31.606, Speaker B: But yeah, I wanted to mention that.
00:08:31.630 - 00:08:49.196, Speaker A: To everyone and also I want to build a new section in Commonwealth around this kind of stuff, and we can start having discussions and conversations around maybe things that we want to have or like, whether it's, hey, this is some sort of bounty that we want to put out for a task that's about to get completed or that we want to complete.
00:08:49.350 - 00:08:52.484, Speaker B: And, yeah, see if that's.
00:08:54.384 - 00:09:42.990, Speaker A: Get feedback from the community. We can discuss all that stuff there or put up like grants and saying, maybe we can put up grant ideas and things like this so that if there's certain things that we want to have done or that people can get engaged with and involved with or have ideas around, like things that could help with. Either way it's marketing or kind of help with content or things like this that we see a lot more community efforts around. That could be really great. I think it's going to be a great way for us to have these conversations and discussions around that and then put that into d work and be able to get the community involved with this. So, yeah, we'd love to hear some feedback from anyone later on or even now. If there's anybody that wants to discuss any of this stuff, feel free to pop up here.
00:09:42.990 - 00:09:44.314, Speaker A: But that's kind of the.
00:09:45.454 - 00:09:51.414, Speaker B: Yeah, kind of the goal with, you know, between d work and common wealth.
00:09:51.454 - 00:09:53.514, Speaker A: And whatnot there and around the foundation.
00:09:55.134 - 00:09:55.874, Speaker C: So.
00:09:57.534 - 00:10:00.638, Speaker B: Yeah, and then I guess, Max, I.
00:10:00.646 - 00:10:07.846, Speaker A: See you're up here. Anything? Did you want to. Just want to give a quick little emissions update? I kind of ran over all that stuff here with the op stuff.
00:10:08.030 - 00:10:08.438, Speaker B: Anything?
00:10:08.486 - 00:10:09.434, Speaker A: No update.
00:10:09.774 - 00:10:58.904, Speaker D: I think you did a good job of explaining about the opinion token emission moving to, you know, that will happen around early August, and the only thing that LP ears and optimism will have to do will just be remove their LP token from the farm and then put it into the new lp staking contract. So we'll give more instructions in terms of how that will work in terms of the user flow, but other than that, no, no real updates. I'm really excited about the dework stuff and would love to hear from the community on like, you know, different ideas in terms of how you think you can participate within Stargate, whether that's, you know, marketing or community things that we could be doing, like, just would love to learn more from the community in terms of how you guys would want to participate in Stargate.
00:11:01.524 - 00:11:02.700, Speaker C: Yeah, perfect.
00:11:02.892 - 00:11:06.584, Speaker A: So, yeah, please, feedback, always welcome.
00:11:07.644 - 00:11:10.302, Speaker B: Yeah, please bring that in as you.
00:11:10.318 - 00:11:52.988, Speaker A: Can with either through AMA, obviously here. Now, if there's anything we want to talk about here in AMA, text questions or just bring it up in our regular chats in discord is obviously a great place here, but site to site section that lists current, updated integrations would be good. Yeah, I guess Luke's got a Twitter. Twitter list, but, yeah, perhaps we could do something else here with. With a site that has these current integrations. I know some people maybe are working in stealth, and oftentimes they just want to try to test things out here. So it may not be always available to provide the full list of people.
00:11:53.156 - 00:11:59.284, Speaker B: But, yeah, it's something we could look at if there's people that are open to discussion.
00:11:59.324 - 00:12:00.504, Speaker D: I think it's a good idea.
00:12:01.084 - 00:12:02.116, Speaker A: Yeah, good idea.
00:12:02.220 - 00:12:06.264, Speaker D: Just highlight the bigger integrations and applications.
00:12:07.054 - 00:12:08.070, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a good idea.
00:12:08.102 - 00:12:28.874, Speaker D: Something we could think about how we incorporate highlighting them as well. Maybe we can highlight the transaction volumes that they're sending over. Stargate can gamify the ranking of integrations in terms of who's passing the most action and transaction volumes through Stargate. I think that there's a lot of interesting things we could do there. For sure.
00:12:30.694 - 00:12:32.798, Speaker C: Yeah. Cool.
00:12:32.846 - 00:12:33.430, Speaker B: Cool.
00:12:33.582 - 00:12:33.886, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:33.910 - 00:12:41.582, Speaker A: Thank you, Ray J, for that input there. Yeah. Good for potential STG buyers, but also for potential integrators.
00:12:41.718 - 00:12:42.914, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:12:44.054 - 00:12:47.354, Speaker C: So, yeah.
00:12:49.134 - 00:12:50.114, Speaker A: Okay.
00:12:51.814 - 00:12:52.190, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:52.222 - 00:12:56.166, Speaker A: Then one other thing here, too, I guess, is the, just as we're talking.
00:12:56.190 - 00:12:58.714, Speaker B: About the commonwealth and.
00:12:59.334 - 00:13:22.062, Speaker A: And work and whatnot, you know, obviously our moderators have done an amazing job here, and I want to start kind of working towards a similar system as, like, what I've done over it with sushi samurai or what we kind of started over there. I really want to try and bring that to Stargate as well. And having like, this, you know, a lot more community engaged like we have here.
00:13:22.078 - 00:13:22.350, Speaker B: We do.
00:13:22.382 - 00:13:24.110, Speaker A: It's really just community members that have.
00:13:24.142 - 00:13:28.114, Speaker B: Like, shown that they've had showing interest.
00:13:28.194 - 00:13:48.978, Speaker A: And really learning and showing that they really want to dive in and be a part of this protocol. So really want to start building out some stuff with that. We'll be putting up kind of a outline proposal type idea around this and some better ways to have some contributors. So stay tuned for that. Try and have that ready. Kind of hopefully, end of this week.
00:13:49.066 - 00:13:53.916, Speaker B: I'm hoping to have that all fleshed out, but. Yeah. Yeah.
00:13:53.980 - 00:14:02.556, Speaker A: Excited about that. So just overall having more community engagement and getting everybody that's stuck around here really appreciate.
00:14:02.660 - 00:14:05.340, Speaker B: I know market's the way it is.
00:14:05.372 - 00:14:10.384, Speaker A: Right now, but love seeing that we have, like, 250 people here in discord right now.
00:14:10.884 - 00:14:13.024, Speaker B: That's pretty great. That's pretty cool.
00:14:13.884 - 00:14:27.204, Speaker A: Yeah. Then as far as the VestG fee accrual, still kind of working on that. And of course, that one is a little bit complex. And, yeah, that might be even something like that to just have, like, a.
00:14:27.504 - 00:14:29.004, Speaker B: You know, if we can figure out.
00:14:29.784 - 00:14:35.136, Speaker A: Like, if we can figure out, like, what's all the, I guess, the contracts that need to be looked at and.
00:14:35.160 - 00:14:38.952, Speaker B: Viewed and how we can, I guess.
00:14:39.008 - 00:14:40.120, Speaker A: Pull all the data from that.
00:14:40.152 - 00:14:41.192, Speaker B: Like, we could even put that up.
00:14:41.208 - 00:14:50.324, Speaker A: As, like, you know, potentially as, like, a dework task and just try and get some numbers on this stuff because it's a little bit out of my league, I think, when it comes to math.
00:14:50.484 - 00:14:52.684, Speaker B: But there might be some other people.
00:14:52.724 - 00:14:57.700, Speaker A: That understand this stuff a lot better and would be able to pick that up.
00:14:57.772 - 00:15:00.492, Speaker B: But, yeah, wanting to.
00:15:00.588 - 00:15:40.258, Speaker A: Obviously, we need a few questions that we need to figure out as well around just when and how fee claiming is going to work, what tokens that these all get paid out in. Cause obviously now with stables across any three of the stables that we're supporting right now. But now we've introduced the ETH pools, so this is where even ETH gets added to the list. And then what chains are we paying out on or is looking to claim on? And there's a lot of things that we kind of will need to flesh out and dial in a little bit more.
00:15:40.396 - 00:15:42.182, Speaker B: So I know we chat about this.
00:15:42.198 - 00:15:44.990, Speaker A: A little bit with Max and Primo.
00:15:45.022 - 00:15:49.054, Speaker B: Yesterday, but, yeah, we're actively thinking about.
00:15:49.094 - 00:15:54.886, Speaker D: How we want to implement this, so something should be coming soon.
00:15:54.990 - 00:15:55.422, Speaker B: It just.
00:15:55.478 - 00:16:06.754, Speaker D: Yeah, I think first we need to figure out the design of the actual redemption process, and then once we have that nailed down, we can focus on implementation.
00:16:09.304 - 00:16:10.168, Speaker C: Wicked.
00:16:10.336 - 00:16:14.680, Speaker B: Wicked. So, yeah, well, we'll keep everybody posted.
00:16:14.712 - 00:16:15.768, Speaker A: On that as well.
00:16:15.896 - 00:16:17.464, Speaker B: But, yeah.
00:16:17.584 - 00:16:30.604, Speaker A: Good to know that you're. If you do have vestg that you are, your fees are being accrued. Yeah, nothing to worry about there. Just. We'll have that stuff sorted out soon enough.
00:16:30.944 - 00:16:38.344, Speaker B: But, yeah. All right.
00:16:39.164 - 00:16:53.292, Speaker A: That kind of covers most of the stuff that I wanted to touch on. I don't know if there's anything else from the community that wants to pop up here and discuss or bring in through the AMA text questions. Feel free to do so.
00:16:53.428 - 00:16:58.504, Speaker B: And, yeah, otherwise, Max or Primo, anything else here before we wrap up?
00:17:03.014 - 00:17:16.614, Speaker E: I think from my end, I think seeing integrations go live finally is obviously awesome and pretty exciting. Like sushi being the big one, but there being multiple others, I think like a couple hundred million in TVL being.
00:17:16.654 - 00:17:22.834, Speaker F: Added kind of around the Stargate ecosystem this week. So that was definitely cool to see.
00:17:23.454 - 00:17:26.292, Speaker B: I think there are, you know, a.
00:17:26.308 - 00:17:34.820, Speaker F: Bunch of other things kind of currently being worked on. That is also pretty cool, but I think it's just like, progress slowly, slowly.
00:17:34.852 - 00:17:38.212, Speaker E: But surely steps towards kind of the ultimate vision.
00:17:38.268 - 00:17:39.584, Speaker F: So it's awesome.
00:17:40.204 - 00:17:41.704, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:17:42.004 - 00:18:27.192, Speaker A: And I think, yeah, just, you know, as we're starting to see these integrations come out, you know, it does take time, but they are happening. I was really happy to see, you know, obviously sushi come out. That's a big one that a lot of people will, will actually use or want to use and was kind of like the flagship product, I think, that you'd originally pitched there early on. So it was really beautiful to see that all come to fruition. And then passive crypto, how much fees in total have accrued until now? Yeah, I guess that's what we do need to figure out. Front end team is going to be working on figuring out ways to claim and then, of course, just figuring out that whole accrual as well.
00:18:27.248 - 00:18:35.536, Speaker B: There's a lot of complexities to the math around it, so, yeah, we'll be.
00:18:35.560 - 00:18:38.084, Speaker C: Working on that shortly.
00:18:39.344 - 00:18:41.360, Speaker A: Again, the math is a little bit.
00:18:41.512 - 00:18:57.622, Speaker E: If you want to keep track, there are plenty of dashboards roughly, you're getting one. It's one out of every six bits. So, you know, total volume times six pips is like, you know, 600,000 every, every billion in volume they could accrue.
00:18:57.678 - 00:19:07.434, Speaker F: To the protocol in general. And it's just like what that gets split up as. So if you keep kind of a light pulse on volume, you can keep a kind of rough pulse on what that might look like.
00:19:09.334 - 00:19:09.710, Speaker C: True.
00:19:09.742 - 00:19:15.606, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess you had to have the full amount that has been accrued as that one basis point and then.
00:19:15.670 - 00:19:18.582, Speaker B: Yeah, figuring out what your portion of.
00:19:18.598 - 00:19:44.406, Speaker A: It is, you know, I think that's what a lot of people want to aim for as well, is like, how much has been accrued for them individually, that gets work. It's a little bit trickier, just as ve, you know, decays linearly and then figuring out where it was that, you know, at what point in time you did stake or if you staked afterwards or before, and, you know, just how that changes. But, yeah, that's a good point or a good metric there to just look at is with the TVL and there.
00:19:44.430 - 00:19:48.034, Speaker B: Yet, you know, the transfer volume and.
00:19:48.074 - 00:19:49.570, Speaker A: Then just gain that one basis point.
00:19:49.602 - 00:19:56.458, Speaker B: And kind of figuring it from there. But, yeah, overall. Yeah, lots of.
00:19:56.586 - 00:19:58.210, Speaker A: Lots of stuff on the go here.
00:19:58.362 - 00:20:01.818, Speaker B: We're super stoked to see a lot.
00:20:01.826 - 00:20:06.546, Speaker A: Of this stuff come to fruition and come to light. So, yeah, glad that you're all here.
00:20:06.570 - 00:20:09.094, Speaker B: With us on this adventure.
00:20:09.794 - 00:20:12.954, Speaker A: But, yeah, if nothing else, probably a.
00:20:13.034 - 00:20:14.614, Speaker B: Great place to wrap up here.
00:20:17.604 - 00:20:18.060, Speaker C: Cool.
00:20:18.132 - 00:20:19.024, Speaker D: Thanks, guys.
00:20:19.524 - 00:20:21.184, Speaker B: Yeah, wicked deal.
00:20:21.644 - 00:20:29.516, Speaker A: All right, thanks, everybody, for. For coming out this week. And it will be live again in two weeks. This has also been recorded and will.
00:20:29.540 - 00:20:35.700, Speaker B: Be up on YouTube to check on afterwards. But, yeah, and if you did stick.
00:20:35.732 - 00:20:41.846, Speaker A: Around here, if you were here for 15 minutes or more, you will be eligible for poap. I'll get those sorted out here shortly after.
00:20:42.020 - 00:20:44.986, Speaker B: So we'll try and get the lo.
00:20:45.010 - 00:20:52.002, Speaker A: Fi bot in here and you can enjoy some tunes while we're waiting for that. But thanks, everybody, for coming out, and.
00:20:52.018 - 00:20:54.554, Speaker B: We'Ll see you in a couple of weeks.
00:20:54.714 - 00:20:55.234, Speaker C: Ciao. Ciao.
