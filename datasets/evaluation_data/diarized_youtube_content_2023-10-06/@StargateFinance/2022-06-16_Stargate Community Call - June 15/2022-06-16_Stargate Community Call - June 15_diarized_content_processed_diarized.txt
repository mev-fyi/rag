00:00:00.280 - 00:00:32.416, Speaker A: To the Stargate finance community call, where we discuss proposals and ideas that will help shape and govern the Stargate protocol. Feel free to join the conversation on stage anytime. Or if you have a question by asking the raise hand button at the bottom of the screen. You can also chime in through the voice text channel on Discord or any of the chats for those listening in through YouTube or Twitch as these channels all aggregate in the messages together. Just a reminder, this is not financial, accounting, or legal advice. Please do your own research. Well, once again, this has been a very interesting past couple of weeks, all the meltdowns going on.
00:00:32.416 - 00:00:59.914, Speaker A: I sure hope everybody's doing okay. But leah, let's catch up and look at some Stargate things we've got. So just to recap here from the past couple weeks, we've got the ETH USD and any new ERC 20 pools. So those autonomous pool deployments. So any of those things. Yeah, those are all in audit and hoping for the green light on Friday. So we should have ETH pools by Friday is the hope here.
00:00:59.914 - 00:01:11.414, Speaker A: Everything sounds like it's ready to go. It's just a matter of. Yeah, just if the audits are good, we can move forward with it. So. Yeah, then.
00:01:14.154 - 00:01:15.134, Speaker B: Yeah, that.
00:01:15.554 - 00:01:25.904, Speaker A: Then as far as the. Yeah, with any. Yeah, like you were saying there, it's just gonna be straightforward to deploy any new ERC 20 after that as well, just with this. With this new setup.
00:01:25.984 - 00:01:26.584, Speaker B: So.
00:01:26.744 - 00:01:35.484, Speaker A: Yeah, that should be pretty sweet. So if anybody wants to bring in their own pool of liquidity, feel free to do that.
00:01:37.264 - 00:01:37.640, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:37.672 - 00:01:56.076, Speaker A: So then sushiswap integration, it sounds like it's getting close. Awaiting audits. And I think that's. Yeah, it seems like it's good to go, but just, again, audits. So that seems to be a big one. Yeah, that and then. Yeah.
00:01:56.076 - 00:02:03.664, Speaker A: As far as the bribing, maki, how are you? Maybe you can shed a little light here on the bribes and things.
00:02:08.084 - 00:02:08.468, Speaker B: Yes.
00:02:08.516 - 00:02:54.138, Speaker C: So beginning of this week, we basically started to bribe again a little bit less. We're 100k on CRV right now, and CVX holders, we basically locked all of our curves, sorry, with yearn. So basically, like, we're going to be earning the full amount for free crv and so on, while taking a 10% aircraft on our votes. They're basically like liquid lockers because dials and so on need to be whitelisted to lock our own curve, which is, you know, yearn stick take. Dao and convex are the only daos right now that were able to do so. Even with fracs trying and so on, they were an impulse. So that's kind of resolution there.
00:02:54.138 - 00:03:15.004, Speaker C: They voted. With all of this curve that has been earned so far since we tried this bribing, we are just shy of one point something million. I will try to get the proper amount. But yeah, overall, like this is what we're looking for on the bribe side this week.
00:03:16.304 - 00:03:17.544, Speaker B: Awesome. Okay.
00:03:17.584 - 00:03:44.384, Speaker A: Yeah, that's great to hear that. The updates on that. And yeah, it'd be cool if we can, we'll try and get like a monthly recap. So every, every second community call we can do like a, maybe even like a further in depth detail, deep dive into like where, where we're at with it and what's up. Just so people can have some further numbers and ideas around it. So I think that could be cool. Okay.
00:03:44.384 - 00:04:13.974, Speaker A: After, right after this call here at 10:00 well, I guess 1700 utc, Commonwealth community call is going to be happening. So I think if any of you noticed, George had posted that both in discord and on Commonwealth just looking to get some community participation and yeah, stuff like that. So yeah, if you want, there is a link, I think the link got updated here in discord and also in, in Commonwealth.
00:04:14.474 - 00:04:14.874, Speaker B: Yes.
00:04:14.914 - 00:04:39.744, Speaker A: If you want to join that, check it out. Feel free to do so. Commonwealth obviously being, you know, our forum for governance. And I think I'm pretty stoked with how it's been working so far. And if you, yeah, if you're interested, hop into that. And yeah, they're just looking for feedback on the forum and the platform as a whole. So.
00:04:39.744 - 00:04:53.944, Speaker A: Yeah, and maybe some of you also noticed that any new topics that get posted on Commonwealth will now populate in discord under community updates. So in that channel you'll be able to see any new proposals that are coming in or general discussion topics.
00:04:54.644 - 00:04:55.068, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:55.116 - 00:05:19.740, Speaker A: So you can just monitor that if you're not always heading over to Commonwealth. And then as far as the Coingecko and Coinmarketcap updates for the circulating supply, it seems like, I think Coinmarketcap has everything they need from us and Coingecko might have to build out a couple things there yet. Or they might need a couple things. I'm not exactly sure, Max. Are you, do you know what's up with those?
00:05:19.812 - 00:05:20.316, Speaker B: I think yeah.
00:05:20.340 - 00:05:24.964, Speaker A: Like coin market cap was good to go, so they should be.
00:05:25.704 - 00:05:34.764, Speaker D: It's actually up on Coingecko right now. Oh, Coinmarketcap. Yeah, queen market cap has everything they need. They're just working on implementing it.
00:05:35.064 - 00:05:37.464, Speaker B: Okay, perfect. Okay.
00:05:37.504 - 00:06:22.428, Speaker A: Nevermind. So yeah, I know that's been a big win question for a while. So cool, check that out. Now, as far as the proposals that have passed, obviously the big one, everyone has been, there's been a lot of chatter around this from the community, but the value accrual for STG stakers. So yeah, obviously the snapshot was passed and yeah, strong support for that. And yes, and now anyone who is. Well, the fee structure, I guess is like just better way of looking at it, is like the fee structure for the six bps now has the following breakdown with the LP fee, depending with, I guess, the emissions flag.
00:06:22.428 - 00:07:03.414, Speaker A: So whether if there's emissions, then the one basis point will go back to the. Go back to protocol and liquidity. If there's no emissions on that pool, then the LP will get one basis point partner fee for anybody that's integrating with the widget or composing Stargate 0.3 basis points. And then VestG holders will now receive one basis point. And this goes directly to the VE or this affects the ve holders that have staked their STG. So will not be inclusive of the community auction or team or investors or anything like that.
00:07:03.414 - 00:07:16.804, Speaker A: So yeah, if you're interested, lock up your STG and that will. Yeah, you will now be receiving one basis point.
00:07:17.984 - 00:07:18.424, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:18.464 - 00:07:50.094, Speaker A: Out of the transfer fee. And that started, I think the. The switch was, or the tracker, I guess, or however we're looking at this, that started yesterday at almost 22 hours ago, I think, or 2020 a little over 20 hours ago or something like this. So I don't know if anybody's got questions on that or ideas of what anything further they want to ask about it. Feel free. Of course you can come up on stage or ask in the AMA text.
00:07:51.354 - 00:08:11.254, Speaker C: I think it's worth mentioning that there's going to be like a proper view in the UI at some point to. To watch all of this kind of unfold and the amount of reward accumulated and so on for v stack stakers. I think that's good to mention. Potentially not sure of the ETA, but that is very important.
00:08:12.034 - 00:08:12.346, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:12.370 - 00:08:13.482, Speaker A: So things will need to be built out.
00:08:13.498 - 00:08:13.666, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:13.690 - 00:08:15.654, Speaker A: For the UI side.
00:08:16.994 - 00:08:17.514, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:17.594 - 00:08:43.214, Speaker A: Just so, yeah, people can monitor, see what's up and I guess like all the claiming and everything, all those contracts are stuff going to be. Need to be audited and. Yeah, just. And built out. But I think the main thing is that the. Yeah, that the main fee flag, I guess, or the tracker is. Is on now.
00:08:43.214 - 00:08:57.054, Speaker A: So that rewards are accruing at this point. So, yeah, I don't know anybody with other will revenue be. Would be in the form of.
00:08:59.874 - 00:09:00.466, Speaker B: I guess. Yeah.
00:09:00.490 - 00:09:11.074, Speaker A: Whatever trend, whatever the. Whatever. The assets being transferred. Right. Because that's the fees on the. Whatever assets being transferred.
00:09:11.114 - 00:09:11.734, Speaker B: Correct.
00:09:17.334 - 00:10:08.264, Speaker D: I think we'll have to probably have more thought on this one. Maybe there might have to be another proposal on this guideline in terms of how the fees are allocated. Yeah, I think I have some ideas. I mean, I think, like, in general, the, like for first, for protocol and liquidity, would make sense for Stargate to have like some sort of guideline in terms of what assets they want to hold on a monthly basis, like a portfolio balance of percentage of stables or ETH or whatever tokens are supported. And then we can probably. I think it would make sense to have a proposal around how the payment, the fees are actually settled in what tokens as well. So I think more thought needs to go into this, but definitely open to people's ideas around that.
00:10:09.064 - 00:10:11.224, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
00:10:11.264 - 00:10:17.952, Speaker A: Well, yeah, we'd love to hear from anyone on this if you've got. If you've got ideas around it or.
00:10:17.968 - 00:10:18.856, Speaker B: Yeah. Put up.
00:10:19.000 - 00:10:22.644, Speaker A: If we get some proposals going, obviously can have some discussion around it.
00:10:23.104 - 00:10:23.844, Speaker B: So.
00:10:25.264 - 00:10:29.204, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know if anybody else has anything further on it.
00:10:37.564 - 00:10:37.964, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:38.004 - 00:10:39.224, Speaker A: Next up here with.
00:10:40.484 - 00:10:40.948, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:40.996 - 00:10:41.584, Speaker A: Current.
00:10:43.964 - 00:10:44.372, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:44.428 - 00:10:47.556, Speaker A: Oh, sorry. The optimism airdrop, that's the other one here.
00:10:47.580 - 00:10:48.636, Speaker B: So that's. Yeah.
00:10:48.660 - 00:11:16.804, Speaker A: For the op tokens for that distribution. So that's snapshot on optimism is currently live and that ends June 22. So it's a. I think we're in the phase zero batch vote because there's a couple separate ones for other things. But in there that is. Yes, it's like lumped in everybody that's a part of the op token Airdrop.
00:11:17.224 - 00:11:18.104, Speaker B: So that's.
00:11:18.224 - 00:11:34.714, Speaker A: Yeah, that doesn't end until the 22nd. And then after that, the op tokens will be. Yeah. Will be available to Stargate. But yeah, contracts for the op distribution are currently in the works and will undergo audits. And. Yeah, we'll.
00:11:34.714 - 00:12:04.630, Speaker A: We'll keep you posted on that as. As we hear more on when those tokens become available to us. And then as far as the current proposals right now. So sip number nine, the outstanding STG rewards on optimism. So that's up on Commonwealth right now. So LP's who had staked on USDC or had staked USDC on optimism were unable to claim the rewards as the STG emissions ended sooner than others chains. So these LP's need to be made whole and have their rewards made available to them.
00:12:04.630 - 00:12:38.970, Speaker A: Outstanding STG will be given from the treasury. So there was 52,000 or 52,740 sg. So that will be airdropped to affected users. So we do have a Google sheet there as well. One of the community members had also provided, provided their breakdown and. Yeah, yeah, both, both had matched from the team side and on this side. So it's good to know that, like, yeah, we've got, the numbers are matching from other people and it's great to see like community members helping in here too.
00:12:38.970 - 00:13:19.064, Speaker A: And like, that's one thing I really want to encourage here, is that, like anybody that, you know, can do this on chain stuff or wants to get involved, like, you know, reach out and we can, you know, we want to hear from you. So I really appreciate that community member, you know, doing and helping out with that. So, yeah, so, yeah, with, yeah, with that, that one can go to. Yeah, that one can go to snapshot today. Then I think that's a positive one that people want to, want to get those rewards claimed again.
00:13:19.144 - 00:13:19.348, Speaker B: So.
00:13:19.376 - 00:13:41.388, Speaker A: So yeah, then we've got the SiP number ten, increase incentives for balancing transfers. This one here will probably let Max take it away here. Yeah, just with the Stargate pools, with the imbalance and how to make those transfers.
00:13:41.476 - 00:13:42.028, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:13:42.156 - 00:13:42.548, Speaker B: Yep.
00:13:42.596 - 00:14:22.282, Speaker D: This is basically making two he changes to just increase the incentive for balancing transfers. So. And the goal of this, right, is to make sure that the pools are in balance. So we're giving the best price on transfers. So yeah, the two things that would be changed are, one, the reward function. So currently the reward function is paying out on all transfers if it pools in deficit, whether it's, you know, a dollar transfer or a million dollar transfer. So the reality is that this should really be supporting, like the rewards really should be given out to transfers that are like materially balancing the pools.
00:14:22.282 - 00:15:00.038, Speaker D: But instead what's actually happening is we're actually subsidizing some of the smaller, the cheaper transfers. So basically changing some logic in there so that only the significantly balancing transfers will be eligible to see rewards. So that's one thing that's changing. And then the other thing that's changing is basically phasing out the baseline fee for significantly balancing transfers. And the thought here is that the protocol is really making like a minimal amount of revenue on these transfers. And that makes sense, right, because you're going from a pool that's in shortage to a pool that's in surplus. Basically the opposite way of where the demand is traveling.
00:15:00.038 - 00:15:21.834, Speaker D: So why charge a fee for things that are actually good for the overall ecosystem? So I think, like, in summary, these two things will do a lot in terms of driving better incentives for people out there to complete balancing transfers and overall, like will drive a better price for Stargate transfers over time.
00:15:22.214 - 00:15:23.350, Speaker B: Cool. Cool.
00:15:23.462 - 00:15:50.894, Speaker A: Yeah, I know you've been really active with like balancing and tools and pathways and all this stuff. So I really appreciate your analytical mind behind all this to guide us through these, these waters because this is way, way over my head for trying to figure this stuff out. So, yeah, I don't know if anybody else has questions for on this, you know, how this can best be best go in here, but I know you're staring at these numbers all day, so.
00:15:51.394 - 00:15:51.802, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:51.858 - 00:15:53.214, Speaker A: Really appreciate that.
00:15:53.834 - 00:15:54.658, Speaker D: Yeah, of course.
00:15:54.706 - 00:15:54.930, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:54.962 - 00:16:00.304, Speaker D: And if anyone has questions on this, yeah, happy to talk through that now or you know, feel free to dm me.
00:16:01.564 - 00:16:01.852, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:01.868 - 00:16:19.704, Speaker A: If anybody has anything, feel free to come on up or raise your hand and we'll get you up on stage. Yeah, I know this is another one here that can be this beneficial to the protocol so that could, that can go up on snapshot as well today.
00:16:24.344 - 00:16:27.056, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know.
00:16:27.080 - 00:16:31.924, Speaker A: Anybody else with further questions, comments, concerns on that?
00:16:40.384 - 00:16:43.520, Speaker B: Okay. All right.
00:16:43.552 - 00:17:21.643, Speaker A: Yeah, then now I see a couple people chatting about, chatting about like rabbit hole and things like that. And that's going to tie in nicely here with this. Yeah, this next proposal here, the Sip eleven first Stargate foundation operation or. Yeah, operating budget proposal. So yeah, this is a proposal to give an operating budget for the foundation for six months as kind of the original start here. And this will be used for audits and legal accounting and general business operations. So it would be removal of 600,000 worth of USDC and STG from the curvy two pool.
00:17:21.643 - 00:18:53.790, Speaker A: So yeah, the, the idea there being that it's, you know, rather than pulling from the treasury, which is, you know, then needing to use the Stargate this way here it's, it's a 50 50. We've already got, you know, half of that is in, is liquid already as USDC and. Yeah, then this way we've got Stargate foundation will have a, you know, operating budget that can do things like just as kind of mentioned here with the, with rabbit hole and things like that. Yeah, we would be able to like put up a proposal and say, hey, yeah, we want to put, you know, x amount towards rabbit hole to, you know, have this kind of a campaign going and, you know, whatnot, or putting quests on and things like this. You know, it'll also allow for, you know, taking care of, you know, actually paying bills for any web two services and anybody that's contributing, like data analytics or analysts or other contributors that want to get involved, be able to build out, moderating teams and things like this, all this kind of stuff helps fuel the ecosystem and helps support what Stargate finance needs to be. So I think this is a really good initiative and. Yeah, like, going to help, you know, I think it's going to help the community in a lot of ways, too, because it'll allow for further engagement and allow people to contribute.
00:18:53.790 - 00:19:20.134, Speaker A: And there's actually like a budget to participate with, so I don't know if anybody has questions on that. Yeah, again, that's just like a six month budget and see where it kind of goes from there. But, yeah, hopefully that's.
00:19:21.834 - 00:19:34.534, Speaker B: Yeah, okay. Yeah.
00:19:34.574 - 00:19:42.114, Speaker A: And if anybody else has anything else they want to bring up here, I've kind of covered everything we need here for the day, but.
00:19:44.854 - 00:19:45.350, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:45.422 - 00:19:49.034, Speaker A: Anybody have anything else they want to ask or bring up or.
00:19:50.174 - 00:19:50.646, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:19:50.670 - 00:20:06.794, Speaker A: I know there's just a lot of integrations that are hopefully going to be coming out here soon and. Yeah, super stoked about the sushi one. Yeah, just like I said, awaiting audits. That'll be really cool to try out and, yeah, we'll keep you posted, of course, on that.
00:20:07.774 - 00:20:08.514, Speaker B: And.
00:20:10.814 - 00:20:14.470, Speaker A: Yeah, Primo, they're asking for Alpha.
00:20:14.502 - 00:20:19.074, Speaker D: I think there's someone requesting to speak tangle.
00:20:23.214 - 00:20:24.160, Speaker B: Oh, perfect.
00:20:24.302 - 00:20:25.004, Speaker A: ASAp.
00:20:25.124 - 00:20:46.264, Speaker E: Lots of alpha in the proposals anyways. I think if you guys piece together slowly, kind of how everything is shifting from the reward functions getting better to the rebalancing incentives being better is going to drive like, more volume overall, the ve Stargate, there's some help in the way things are trending, for sure.
00:20:49.484 - 00:20:50.264, Speaker B: Perfect.
00:20:52.094 - 00:20:52.954, Speaker A: Aesop.
00:21:01.094 - 00:21:02.510, Speaker F: Hey, hello, can you hear me?
00:21:02.622 - 00:21:04.334, Speaker A: Got you now. Yeah.
00:21:04.374 - 00:21:08.094, Speaker F: Okay. So, you know, given the market turbulence. So one of the things I was.
00:21:08.174 - 00:21:14.134, Speaker D: Curious about is, I think as of right now, the stables can be traded.
00:21:14.174 - 00:21:22.918, Speaker F: Or swapped one for one. Right now for the most part. What would happen if. What's the contingency plan if, say, one of the stables?
00:21:23.046 - 00:21:23.754, Speaker D: Peg?
00:21:25.774 - 00:21:53.270, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think it's a great question. I think it's one of the underlying assumptions of the system is that the assets that are paired together are valued at one to one within the system, subject to the equilibrium fee of like the curve style, sort of pricing fee at the bounds. Right. So when you assign a weight in a pool to another asset, you are basically giving that asset some amount of.
00:21:53.302 - 00:21:54.870, Speaker G: Exposure to your underlying pool.
00:21:54.902 - 00:22:05.646, Speaker E: So the LP's are basically taking some underlying risk of that asset rate, maintaining or staying near one to one for the reward on all sort of the.
00:22:05.670 - 00:22:10.494, Speaker G: Pathways that are tied there, right, for all of these unified fees, sort of at the weight that is there.
00:22:10.654 - 00:22:16.012, Speaker E: That said, so when we add other pools, even of assets that are, know.
00:22:16.068 - 00:22:19.996, Speaker G: Potentially stable coins, so like USDD or.
00:22:20.060 - 00:22:23.684, Speaker E: You know, whatever this is, those will be 100% contained to their own pool.
00:22:23.724 - 00:22:27.316, Speaker G: So basically just be an isolated token bridge for that asset.
00:22:27.460 - 00:22:31.028, Speaker E: But for the USDC, USDT and BUSD.
00:22:31.156 - 00:22:36.940, Speaker G: Which are all co tied together right now, the underlying pool basically would eat the DPEG rate.
00:22:37.012 - 00:22:51.206, Speaker E: But that said, we have been proactively kind of looking into what we can do to circuit break this scenario. So to limit in that sort of.
00:22:51.230 - 00:22:55.274, Speaker G: Outlier scenario, to limit that exposure as much as humanly possible.
00:22:55.614 - 00:22:58.566, Speaker E: And right now, we just introduced something.
00:22:58.630 - 00:23:01.434, Speaker G: That basically in the event of a DPEG.
00:23:03.374 - 00:23:11.902, Speaker E: Should basically a system to circuit break the pool. So if USDT dpegs, then all of.
00:23:11.918 - 00:23:26.470, Speaker G: The USDT pools basically will stop allowing swaps in and out until the peg is maintained or it will be just frozen there. And so basically there is a circuit breaker being worked on to be put in place. If that were to happen.
00:23:26.662 - 00:23:28.774, Speaker E: The other option is simply to unpair.
00:23:28.814 - 00:23:32.462, Speaker G: The pools to remove all weights to.
00:23:32.478 - 00:23:49.002, Speaker E: The other pool and just make it so USDC is only paired with USDC. USDT is only paired with USDT. The expense of that is clearly volume. Much less useful generally for arbitrage, much less useful generally for broad volume on.
00:23:49.018 - 00:23:49.634, Speaker G: A bunch of things.
00:23:49.674 - 00:24:13.022, Speaker E: I think cross asset pairs right now are Max, we'll have the exact number, but let's just say roughly 20% of all volume. So it's not a dominant share, but it's still a meaningful amount. And so I think this is something absolutely. That should be analyzed. Governance and LP's should have a pretty strong say and what that looks like. And I think it's just, you know, you're basically pricing risk, you're pricing a.
00:24:13.038 - 00:24:18.874, Speaker G: DPEG for fees, and the question is whether or not that's, you know, worth it or not.
00:24:20.134 - 00:24:20.854, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think.
00:24:20.894 - 00:24:42.844, Speaker F: Well, in terms of. I guess I have two follow up questions. Thanks for that answer. What would be the threshold you would be using to trigger the threat, to trigger the circuit break? And as far as the dev work or the work that's required to, for the circuit break, what kind of timelines are we talking about? Weeks or days or trying to get a sense of that.
00:24:43.944 - 00:24:48.680, Speaker E: So I think we have an MVP already set up and working just as.
00:24:48.712 - 00:25:07.132, Speaker G: Like a potential backstop. I think a longer term solution with 100% reliability and everything else might take some time. Right now, we basically, there's, there's basically like a crisis solution that's put in place as an MVP just for preparedness.
00:25:07.228 - 00:25:11.436, Speaker E: And in terms of the numbers, I think that also should be, should be.
00:25:11.460 - 00:25:15.984, Speaker G: Looked at and analyzed. The current kind of working model is.
00:25:16.484 - 00:25:22.428, Speaker E: $0.98 for 30 minutes or ninety five cents.
00:25:22.476 - 00:25:30.334, Speaker G: I think those are like the two markers. If it's below ninety five cents at all or below $0.98 for 30 minutes, it would introduce the circuit break.
00:25:34.994 - 00:25:36.774, Speaker E: How do you feel about those numbers?
00:25:40.314 - 00:25:55.930, Speaker F: To be honest, I haven't looked at the numbers closely enough myself to figure out if it makes sense or not. But I'm assuming that if it gets to the 95 or even ninety eight cents, the algorithm has some ways of compensating the folks on the wrong side up to a certain point, I would assume.
00:25:56.002 - 00:25:58.594, Speaker E: Yeah, there's, there's a, there's a fee as the pool gets drained. Right.
00:25:58.634 - 00:26:00.290, Speaker G: I mean, the. Going in that direction.
00:26:00.442 - 00:26:26.144, Speaker F: Yeah. The further, the further depends. Obviously that compensation won't work, but for the time being, at least in, within the controlled amount or range, it should have some level of compensation. Like you said, the de risking or the risking part of it. Yeah, I really don't, but I'm, it's, it is reassuring to hear that you guys are thinking about this and there's some, something in play because obviously everyone's thinking about these kind of things and, you know, we're not living in normal world from a crypto perspective.
00:26:26.804 - 00:26:28.504, Speaker E: Hundred percent.
00:26:31.964 - 00:26:32.744, Speaker F: Thanks.
00:26:33.844 - 00:26:34.796, Speaker B: All right, yeah, thank you.
00:26:34.820 - 00:26:55.014, Speaker A: ASAP. Yeah, well, hopefully, yeah, that can be put into place and just let's hope that we don't end up with deep hiking events anymore of those. Yeah, I know ust was pretty rough on a lot of people, so let's, yeah, let's just hope everything keeps pegged.
00:26:55.834 - 00:26:57.818, Speaker B: But. Okay.
00:26:57.906 - 00:27:02.934, Speaker A: Anybody else with any questions, comments, concerns?
00:27:09.754 - 00:27:10.614, Speaker B: All right.
00:27:12.694 - 00:27:53.954, Speaker A: Well, I think, yeah, we can probably wrap it up here, but yeah, of course, if you have any further questions or anything. Yeah, bring it in to bring it into the discord. And yeah, we're check out on the checkout, all the proposals on Commonwealth and of course we'll have, yeah, it should be two snapshots should be up here later today and yeah, get ready for, yeah, ETH, USDD and any other pools we want, the community wants to vote in. Those will be ready to go, hopefully Friday, I guess just, yeah, waiting on audits so that. And keep an eye out for the sushi stuff. That should be soon. Just, again, also audits and.
00:27:53.954 - 00:28:10.934, Speaker A: Yeah, then we'll keep you posted on the op token distribution once that passes. So that's still another week yet for that. That vote on. And that's directly on optimism's governance.
00:28:11.514 - 00:28:12.674, Speaker B: But. Okay.
00:28:12.794 - 00:28:23.234, Speaker A: Thank you for tuning in today. We'll be back here again in two weeks on the next community call. Check out the recording on YouTube later today and stick around after the call for your Po app and how to claim it. But thanks, everyone. See you soon.
