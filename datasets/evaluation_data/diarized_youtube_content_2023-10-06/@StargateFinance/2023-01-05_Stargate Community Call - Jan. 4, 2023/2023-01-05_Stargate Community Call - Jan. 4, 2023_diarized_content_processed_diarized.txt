00:00:00.400 - 00:00:35.004, Speaker A: Finance community call, where we discuss proposals and ideas that help shape and govern the Stargate protocol. Feel free to join the conversation on stage anytime you have a question by clicking the raise hand button at the bottom of the screen. You can also chime in through the voice text channel in discord or any other chats that are for those listening in on YouTube and Twitch as those channels all aggregate together. And just a reminder, this is not financial advice, accounting, or legal advice. Please do your own research. All right, happy 2023, everyone. I know, 22 was a wild year for a lot of us.
00:00:35.004 - 00:01:04.220, Speaker A: Yeah, 23 is here. Hope you're all doing well. Had a good time over the holidays. I was able to hang out with some friends, family and, yeah, enjoy some food, hopefully as well. I know I overindulged a little too much, but that's how it goes. Yeah. As far as looking back here as a wrap up on 22, if we look at back at December, if we look at our stargates, that's there.
00:01:04.220 - 00:01:54.444, Speaker A: Another all time high for monthly transactions. So seeing 319,000, almost 320,000 transactions just in December alone. And still with that steady volume, just over 400 million transactions happening. So, yeah, really looking forward to more of this coming forward here as like, more integrations are coming up. You know, there's a lot of stuff happening throughout, you know, that happened in December here that's going to drive us forward for further stuff here into the new year. Yeah. And for example here, the next thing that we want to discuss is like the meatus deployment, you know, there we're bringing a whole new chain is now going to be available through Stargate.
00:01:54.444 - 00:02:26.156, Speaker A: You know, Midas had put that proposal up a while ago, you know, that passed. Very excited about that. Going to be having USDT pools. So those will be connected on Ethereum, BNB, avalanche, and Metis. And there's going to be incentives through metis for rebates. So you'll have bridging rebates when you're going to or from. Is it both to and from Metis, Max or Primo? I can't remember here.
00:02:26.156 - 00:02:26.852, Speaker A: Just off top.
00:02:26.948 - 00:03:06.184, Speaker B: So the proposal still proved from them that there will be clear rebate on the so six basis points of fees affecting charges that will be given out in Metis itself that will be distributed to begin every two weeks of them, moving towards an automated system. So it's essentially free or no cost or cost rebated to explore that chain, as well as the fact, as you point out, they're incentivizing liquidity on all of the pools with their actual meat as tokenized rewards rather than STG or any other reward.
00:03:06.724 - 00:03:35.384, Speaker A: Yeah, that's super exciting. At least if you haven't been over to meet us yet, it gives you that opportunity of saying, hey, at least I'm coming here. And I'm not just like risking something on my own. It's like I'm going to get rebated for, you know, for coming here. And I mean, you know, between networks and I'm sure it's going to be, you know, relatively. I'm curious to see like what the costs are to actually move over there. But my guess is that it's going to be, you know, just as cheap as any of these other, other networks.
00:03:35.924 - 00:04:02.188, Speaker B: So, yeah, the cost is exactly the same as moving through any other network on Stargate. And I think there's a large amount of utility unlock because meta as the L2 roll up, similar to optimism or arbitrum. So we see a lot of usage from those, from users on those L2s, trying to get not only two, but from them and not having to wait for that seven day bridge.
00:04:02.316 - 00:04:02.940, Speaker A: Yeah, very good.
00:04:02.972 - 00:04:06.044, Speaker B: We said about unlocking that for the metas ecosystem.
00:04:06.124 - 00:04:06.780, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah.
00:04:06.812 - 00:04:09.508, Speaker B: Another one from me that's building on top of starving as well.
00:04:09.636 - 00:04:34.029, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yeah. Because now that unlocks a whole new subset of builders as well that wants to get into, you know, accessing the meatus ecosystem as well. So, yeah, that's a whole, this is going to unlock a whole lot of stuff here. You know, I know a lot of people are excited about, you know, roll up seasons and things like this. So hopefully that plays right into that.
00:04:34.029 - 00:05:19.144, Speaker A: And there will also be a meta PD pool, or APD pools rather, between Ethereum, BNB and Metis. I think that's just the three that they're doing for now, I think. For now, but yeah, so that's sweet. So you'll be able to move your Metis around and deployment will be this month here in January. So really looking forward to that. Yeah, of course there'll be announcements around that as it develops and rolls out. But yeah, I think like that you were mentioning there to the rebreat, the rebate for that bridge volume will be every, every two weeks for transfers to and from Metis, and that'll be airdropped as Metis on Metis for any of the users.
00:05:19.144 - 00:06:03.894, Speaker A: So yeah, so yeah, keep your ears out for that one. Another thing that we had going was Atlantis loans integration. So yeah, now that was essentially a widget there that allows its users to easily access its lending and borrowing markets across several different chains. So great to see some other more and more protocols. Just giving that functionality, that availability to access Stargate in such a really easy, seamless way to be able to keep their user retention and just still be able to utilize the convenience of Stargate right from within their own platform. So absolutely love to see that. And yeah, I'm sure there's going to be more and more as it rolls out just how convenient it is.
00:06:03.894 - 00:06:35.024, Speaker A: And then we've got some layer three quests. Of course, we had that. We had one back in December. There will be another one coming up soon. Just working out some final details on that. And also, if some of you noticed, if you were doing some of this back at the end of the year, there was an arbitrum holiday quest that involved us using Stargate for requiring you to lp on it. So there was a few different things that you had to do.
00:06:35.024 - 00:07:16.580, Speaker A: Stargate was in there as one of them. So it was pretty cool to see. And yeah, we're just going to look to see how we can adjust some of the quests and see if there's ways to try and make it a little more available to everyone. Kind of doing what we can here. We'll shift things around just to see if there's a way to make it a little more fair or accessible. But please be patient with us and hopefully we can make this work, make this work for everyone, get as many people involved as we can. And then just to recap here on SIP number 19 and 20, so that was around protocol rebalancing.
00:07:16.580 - 00:08:22.314, Speaker A: So of course the balancing from 19 was completed, restoring protocol to the ideal balance, and then continued balancing with SIP 20 is ongoing by the foundation. So that's allowing for significant fees to be captured, which is then directly going back to the protocol and liquidity, which is like one of the, that's like the main goal here is to be able to grow that protocol and liquidity and then the protocol being self sufficient. Right. So yeah, there was a great amount of fees captured there. And yeah, there's going to be some reporting coming in on this as well in middle of January, and then there'll be monthly reporting on this as well, just to keep track of, like, keep track of this kind of stuff so that people can realize like, hey, this is like, what rebalancing can do for the protocol and, you know, just to keep it in check and making it. Making this protocol work as seamless as possible and giving the users the best experience as well. I don't know, Max, if there's anything else further you want to add to that.
00:08:23.674 - 00:09:23.484, Speaker B: No, I think you nailed it. I think the idea that the protocol can continually work towards sitting in an optimal state where liquidity can be utilized again and again, creates the best experience for users using Stargate by keeping fees low and allowing for less liquidity to be needed to actually service the protocol, which results in exactly what the community voted on, which is a reduction of emissions. And I think on a monthly basis, Stargate is working to reduce monthly emissions. And then as well as you point out, it is a way for Pol to grow as these EQ fees are captured by the Stargate foundation on behalf of the Stargate Dao. And as you point out, the transparency reporting as voted on is important so that everybody can track exactly what's going on, how funds are being utilize and where everything sits at any given time.
00:09:26.824 - 00:10:08.446, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome, awesome. So, yeah, with, like I said, like I was mentioning there, those, those are up and running and, you know, doing, yeah, doing the work to help the protocol. And another one here as well was SiP 21. And that was with the improved DPEG protection or protection, you know, that's just making Stargate more resilient and more robust. So if you want, you can follow up on look back at SFP 21 as to how that all worked. But again, all of these little improvements to just make Stargate as efficient as possible, making it the place that people want to come to, they feel safe, they know they're getting amazing prices, they're able to move quickly. The convenience is here.
00:10:08.446 - 00:10:28.216, Speaker A: Like this is, you know, this is Stargate's aim is to be. To be number one. That's what it's all about. All right. As we move into proposals. So we've got sip 25. If we could touch on that one.
00:10:28.216 - 00:10:51.468, Speaker A: So that's the market maker proposal. And that one is revised here. Sip 24 came out and. Yeah, just having a little more further clarity in this proposal, it looks like. Yeah, I just wanted to really stir up some conversation around this one. Just as it was, it was a very close vote before. However, I think it was at like 61%.
00:10:51.468 - 00:11:14.610, Speaker A: And now with the recent changes to the threshold and decorum and everything, it needed to have 70%. So we were still in favor. There was. Most of the community was in favor of this proposal, but it just didn't quite reached that. That threshold of 70% voting in favor. So just wanted to like, really bring that up again here. It seems like the proposal's up.
00:11:14.610 - 00:11:57.654, Speaker A: So like, yeah, just fleshing out any of the concerns or questions from the community around this, how they feel about it? Yeah. And just like understanding, you know, further, like, you know, why this is important. Yeah. I mean, centralized exchanges still play a very large role in accessibility for people to get to these tokens. We're still seeing it even after everything that's gone on here, but there's still. People have access through places like Binance and Coinbase and Kraken and Hobie. There's a whole bunch of different places that people are still going.
00:11:57.654 - 00:12:15.554, Speaker A: And having a market maker that can allow that access for people, you know, does make, you know, does make it pretty. It's. Yeah, it's just a necessary. It's a necessity. So. Yeah, it also like, gives me. Yeah, yeah, go ahead, Max.
00:12:16.174 - 00:13:38.926, Speaker B: I'm happy to expand on it a little bit. As mentioned, I think there was clear, clear conversation, feedback within our community and from a number of people here, here on the call post. Sip 24 failing to reach forum. To be very clear, it did pass, meaning a majority of people voting were in favor for it, but didn't reach our sort of threshold around what a vote means in terms of number of people voting for it to actually bring it forwards. So Sip 25 is attempts to clarify what a market maker actually does, which is providing liquidity on both sides of a book to make a book more liquid, so that when somebody goes to buy or sell the token, they're actually able to without an enormous amount of slippage, which is highly encouraged by a number of centralized exchanges. And in fact, as SIP 25 states, not having a market maker on some exchanges can lead to tokens being deprioritized or delisted by those exchanges. And the thing that it also does is it allows the token, allows people to interact with the asset itself.
00:13:38.926 - 00:14:55.982, Speaker B: So I think there was some clear confusion about how market making works, how market makers actually structure agreements, which is clarified. SIp 25 to go over here is typically they take a call option on the token in exchange for finance, and you can either pay fees to market maker for providing the service or give a call option against a token. I personally feel a call option is a positive thing because it aligns, you know, the market maker with the protocol itself. So in Sip 25, the proposals written that a market maker will get a call option at a minimum of token, but obviously do not impact market integrity. The proposal doesn't state any given amount, but that means that the market maker could exercise and decide to get back USDC instead of the token itself at that price. But again, it creates alignment itself. And it also provides a necessary service because whether we like it or not, and I'm a huge defi maxi.
00:14:55.982 - 00:15:15.698, Speaker B: But as you point out, Tangle, a good number of people primarily interact with tokens and protocols from a centralized exchange standpoint. And having access and liquidity for the SG token is something that clearly our community is saying is an important thing.
00:15:15.866 - 00:16:09.224, Speaker A: Absolutely. And even if like they, in a beautiful world here, SDG is their first interaction on a, it's like their first interaction to get them over to DeFi, right. They say oh, what's this SDG token? They find it or hear about it and then they find it through a centralized exchange and then realize, oh wait a second, I can actually use this token and transfer it between different networks through this, like, you know, because it's an oft. And then they learn about the protocol and then they find, hey, wait a second, I can do everything I want to do on chain and it brings them on chain. So even if it's for that too, like there's the accessibility and like, and yeah, just exposure, I think, you know, is beneficial in that, in that way. I think for a lot of us, we all started out on centralized exchanges and has brought us to defi. Um, so yeah, I, I do think it is a necessary, uh, necessary evil, if you want to call it.
00:16:09.224 - 00:16:13.924, Speaker A: But um, you know, it's definitely, uh, yeah, it's definitely needed.
00:16:15.104 - 00:16:32.424, Speaker B: Yeah, for, for me at least sip 25 brought more clarity about what was going to be achieved. But I think it's important that if people from our community don't have that clarity that we comment about it, we talk about it and, and get clarity on, you know, sip 25 through engaged discussion.
00:16:33.444 - 00:17:32.714, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So please everyone, if you can, head over to, over to Commonwealth. And I really appreciate to have, you know, full, thoughtful responses. There's no need for just like single, single word responses to this. That, that's really just noise when we want to have like, you know, serious questions that people have about this, that we want to make sure that those get raised to the top so that people are able to, that those do get surfaced and that those can be addressed. Because this is what governance is all about, where we're having, where we want to have this discussion to get, to make proposals, to get them to the best form that they can be with the feedback from the community. So please head over there if you've got some questions around this or things that you like about this versus 24, really that's what we need out of this, need the community there to be involved and engaged and get that feedback.
00:17:32.714 - 00:17:48.234, Speaker A: All right. Yeah, I think we've kind of covered everything with, with that proposal. Any question, any further questions or anything, just keep an eye in here from the AMA text questions.
00:17:49.894 - 00:17:57.522, Speaker C: We had a bunch of hands raised too. Let's roll through the proposals and then I think let's. Let's have some people up and have some, some open discussion.
00:17:57.618 - 00:18:22.466, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, we'll rally through the others here, so. Okay. All right, we've got another one that came up too. Was great to see from name or aka brutal trade. He's had a proposal up a while ago too, around the reunit wallet and. Yeah, just posted around the Reuni airdrop.
00:18:22.466 - 00:18:51.850, Speaker A: So he's planning to do that in for your Stg, Vestg and Aastg holders. Yeah. So that's pretty cool that seeing somebody that's utilizing Stargate and building out something building out something here to kind of help the. Help the whole omni chain community, essentially. Yeah. Really pleased to see this and it's great to see that there's like, you know, giving back to the Stargate community. So.
00:18:51.850 - 00:19:16.698, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know, that was, that was wonderful to see. I'm sure we'll hear more about this. You know, there was some stuff on Twitter as well from him. So. Yeah, if you have a chance, check that out and looking forward to it here for. Yeah, for all that stuff. And then last thing here I wanted to look at was, yeah, the Stargate monthly financial reporting.
00:19:16.698 - 00:19:53.064, Speaker A: That was one of the proposals that came up from a community member here from asymmetric Defi. So they're looking to do providing monthly reports about the Stargate Dow at twelve k a year. So one k a month USD. Yeah, basically just like, you know, doing, you know, financial reporting. They've done some stuff here for Aave and for Uniswap as well. Yeah, I think it'd be good if we had like, you know, get some more feedback from people on like, what does the community want? Want to see as far as, like. Yeah, as far as, like.
00:19:53.064 - 00:20:36.550, Speaker A: Yeah, like what kind of reporting they would like to see here, what kind of details. So, yeah, that's, I think there's like some good stuff there that could be, you know, it's great to see like, the community. You know, this is what we need here is like community proposals coming up saying, hey, this is something that, you know, could benefit the protocol. What do you think of this? Here's what I want to do to, you know, to execute this. So, like, I really appreciate this proposal coming up, because this is like, what we need is having, you know, asking the dow for saying, like, hey, what does the community think? Can we do this? What does, what should this look like? And, you know, do you find this valuable? So, yeah, go ahead.
00:20:36.742 - 00:21:28.784, Speaker B: I think with these type of proposals where, you know, where somebody brings something up and says, I want to provide something and they're requesting money from the community. And as with any request of money from the community, it's our decision as a starting community whether we want to do this or not. But I think it's really important that we have a discussion together about what we want out of this request. So this, this request is to produce, as you said, financial reporting on a monthly basis. What, what do we actually want to see in that report? What do we as a community feel is important to see? What would we like produced? And if we're going to spend the Dao's money to do this, you know, do we feel this is a good use of it? And those are the questions sort of answered together. And I think strong, strong and clear feedback and from, from everybody here is important to achieve that.
00:21:29.244 - 00:21:51.164, Speaker A: Absolutely. Absolutely. So, yeah. Yeah. If we can have people come over to Commonwealth and add your comments there around that, things that you'd like to see with it, I think that would be really beneficial, just as Max kind of pointed out. And maybe let's bring some people up here on stage. I see there's a few hands.
00:21:51.164 - 00:22:04.504, Speaker A: See what? I'll bring a couple people up at a time here, and then we can kind of work from there. So Faust and ev eevee.
00:22:06.164 - 00:22:07.412, Speaker D: Hello, guys, can you hear me?
00:22:07.468 - 00:22:08.904, Speaker A: We sure can. How are you?
00:22:10.364 - 00:22:12.236, Speaker D: Good, man. Thanks. How are you?
00:22:12.300 - 00:22:16.180, Speaker A: Yeah, doing great. Doing great. You've got a question. Yeah.
00:22:16.212 - 00:22:40.214, Speaker D: So my question is maybe not relative to today's topic. I just wanted to ask, like, which engagement from the community you want to see? Like, is it maybe something in terms of creating content or some, like, YouTube videos about exploring the layer zero and the Stargate ecosystem?
00:22:41.474 - 00:23:20.364, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, all of that. Yeah, no, I was going to say, absolutely. This is where any ideas that people have here that they can bring them up to the community and say, like, hey, what does the community want? What does the community need, you know, and then be asking the dow for? I mean, that's really, that's up to the community. So, yeah, and then it, you know, of course, gets voted in favor for. So, yeah, if, like, it could be any of that kind of stuff. And, like, you know, it'd be great to have yeah, a whole wide, wide myriad of different things that could come in here, but I'll let you go here primo as well. I know you want to chime in.
00:23:22.284 - 00:24:06.734, Speaker C: I think in general, like, the best communities are the ones who drive interesting, organic content. I think at the end of the day, people should be writing or making videos about this stuff because they find it to be super interesting and their audience will in turn be engaged with it and it will be shared because people find that thing that they're writing about interesting. I think there's a huge amount of surface area on the Stargate side that just, like, hasn't been written about. And some of this is getting exposed now through data. And people are seeing more applications pick up and they're seeing, like. But you know, the difference between, like, when you take a generic kind of vanilla bridge, you've just, like, move money over versus, hey, all these applications are building on top of this. All these people are running these things.
00:24:06.734 - 00:24:47.182, Speaker C: Like, actually, you know, a huge amount of Stargate volume is potentially going to be driven not from the Stargate UI, but, like, from. From wallets and applications, all these other things doing it. So, like, I think all of that sort of stuff is super interesting and not super well understood. And there's just, like, only so much. There's only so many Twitter threads that I can make right. So having people actually care enough or find it interesting enough to write about this stuff and to really produce real content, that's something the community should embrace. Cause I think those things are just incredibly valuable to the end community as a whole.
00:24:47.182 - 00:24:59.324, Speaker C: And so I would hope that people who are making, like, real, genuine content and writing about this stuff that the community kind of, like, embraces that and, you know, kind of, kind of celebrates it. So. Yeah.
00:25:00.744 - 00:25:03.296, Speaker D: Guys, can I add one more quick question?
00:25:03.480 - 00:25:04.204, Speaker A: Sure.
00:25:05.584 - 00:25:10.104, Speaker D: Yes. So recently you had this, like, quest with layer three.
00:25:10.224 - 00:25:10.924, Speaker A: Yes.
00:25:11.224 - 00:25:53.634, Speaker D: And I just wanted to ask, like, how you look into words making something similar, but with more like, social engagement, like, for example, galaxy campaign or the crew three quests, something like that. One more second. So the people from example, Twitter that are not really familiar with Dao voting, like something decentralized apps, something like that, so they can came to Stargate, see what is like, how it looks from the perspective of the regular user, and then come in this, like, Dao voting and all of this stuff.
00:25:54.174 - 00:25:54.954, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:55.294 - 00:26:31.696, Speaker C: And I 100%, like, agree on that. In general, I think the big thing about the galaxy and the layer three quests were like, I think the big thing that it showed is that there's. There's like, people are very interested in this stuff. You know, a couple hundred thousand people sort of engaged with this and interacted. And so I think, like, that is an original touch point of, like, okay, like, people are interested in engaging people, like, love the product. People are willing to actually, like, go and engage in this and kind of try it out. So I think, like, modifying that or trying to do something where the touch point is not just like one simple thing, but.
00:26:31.696 - 00:27:33.494, Speaker C: But something that is more, let's say this, there's a ton of different ways that we could make that experience more engaging. There's a ton of different ways that we could replicate something like that for content, for a bunch of other things. I think there are just. The community at whole is going to be way, way better of surfacing what actually would be cool there and what, like, would be interesting. And that's something that would love to see on Commonwealth or just in general talked about as like, okay, if we're going to do something further, like, what does it look like? What do the rewards look like? What, you know, everything about it. I think that's something that could be this whole, much, much larger, you know, discussion that we could end up talking about for hours. But I think that's something where, like, the ideas of the community and just like, a broader sense of what would actually be cool there or motivating is definitely the first and best step, is just like, figure out what that actually looks like and then we can figure out how together kind of make that a reality.
00:27:35.394 - 00:28:10.280, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And then, you know, like you'd mentioned there, evie, there's. Yeah, there's a few protocols that platforms I've been kind of exploring and looking at here, I just didn't have as much chance over the holidays to dive into a few more. But I've been getting a few pings from a few different places. But you'd mentioned quest three. Link three was another one, too. And some of these maybe just having one or two off that are just doing, like you said, that kind of social engagement as well to get for the Twitter engagement that's also there.
00:28:10.280 - 00:28:45.726, Speaker A: I know people like doing on chain activities, so that's kind of why we focused more onto layer three. However, it does allow for that. It is giving that Twitter engagement as well through layer three. You can set that up. But, yeah, I know with some of these other ones does push for that engagement there as well. But, yeah. All right, anything further there, evie? Kind of cracking up there.
00:28:45.726 - 00:29:13.094, Speaker A: Like breaking up a little bit, but all good. I'll bring up a couple others here. We'll see if they've got things here for us just as we. Fair Montiel. Hey, fair Montiel. Fairmontial.
00:29:14.074 - 00:29:14.650, Speaker B: Nice.
00:29:14.762 - 00:29:19.298, Speaker A: Hello. Hello. Hi.
00:29:19.386 - 00:29:29.584, Speaker B: I have a question. You know, I want to know if you have plans to expand to a different environments or ecosystems, like cosmos and something like that.
00:29:33.644 - 00:30:14.456, Speaker C: So like the way that, you know, just coming up earlier is like Metis is the first new chain that's coming up. Stargate is a bit bound right now by where layer zero goes. So what that looks like at the moment is, you know, 23 EVM chains and then Aptos and then possibly Solana and some of the others cosmos. All that stuff will come up eventually, but right now that's basically the limiting factor. If it is already supported by layer zero, Stargate can go there, which is why it's going to its first new chain, the 8th chain. So, yeah, definitely can. It's more of a question of fragmented liquidity.
00:30:14.456 - 00:30:51.002, Speaker C: One of the things about Stargate is you need to have liquidity in the pools. And so like when you go to some new chain, you need to incentivize or, you know, somehow get liquidity to be added there and then basically tie in liquidity from the other chain. So it's important that when you do go to these ecosystems, they're like chosen kind of thoughtfully and ideally in a way that kind of minimizes the amount of emissions that need to come out of, um, you know, Stargate. That Stargate needs to mit to basically support this. Right. Um, so, yeah, definitely can do. Is happening.
00:30:51.002 - 00:31:05.534, Speaker C: Uh, 8th chain is coming, uh, soon. Um, but it's like there's some. Some interesting calculus. Um, and I think there's some. Some cool stuff being talked about now, but ways to just make that more efficient so, you know, can go to more places much easier.
00:31:07.034 - 00:31:11.054, Speaker B: Yeah, I think when you look at, when you look at new chains.
00:31:12.754 - 00:31:13.018, Speaker C: I.
00:31:13.026 - 00:32:13.894, Speaker B: Think when you look at new chains as well, a lot of the chains that Stargate may potentially go to are going to be chain driven. Where Minas came and posted proposals and we want you here and here's what we're willing to give for you to do that. And I think that that's a trend that we'll hopefully see continue from other chains that want Stargate to end up there where they can offset the need for SDG issuance or provide other incentives to SDG holders or to Stargate as a community or Stargate as a protocol and incentivize Stargate, actually go in there and be on that ecosystem, because as primo said, liquidity fragmentation is a large issue where when you look at adding more chains, the volume generated by having the chain added needs to offset liquidity fragmentation as well as additional emissions for it to make sense on a long term basis.
00:32:16.114 - 00:32:39.146, Speaker A: Thank you. Awesome. Thanks very much. Alt. Tenveer, you got something for us? Tenveir? Anything? I think we've got one final request here. Oh, hello. Hello.
00:32:39.146 - 00:33:01.554, Speaker A: Hi, Tanvir. Go ahead, Tanvir, have you got something for us? If not HK teach, have you got something? Yes. No, I'm not English. I am Bangladesh. Okay, have you got a question for us?
00:33:01.634 - 00:33:10.002, Speaker C: It's okay. If you type English and want to translate better, you can post it. Which channel do the questions get posted to? In text?
00:33:10.098 - 00:33:20.650, Speaker A: Yeah, the AMA text question or, sorry, voice text channel. That's just above where the stage channel is. So if you want to type those questions, you can do that there. And the voice text channel?
00:33:20.802 - 00:33:25.462, Speaker C: Yeah, you can translate it out and drop it in text and we'll answer it there. Thanks, man.
00:33:25.658 - 00:33:48.550, Speaker A: Cool, cool. And HK teach, have you got something before we wrap up here? No. Yes. No. All good. All right, I see something in here. From Tsukiyomi up to now, Layer Zero, Stargate, which is the first to build on top of layer Zero, have received as one single team.
00:33:48.550 - 00:33:54.614, Speaker A: While multiple protocols keep building on top of layer Zero. Yeah. The relationship between layer Zero and Stargate.
00:33:58.514 - 00:33:59.314, Speaker B: Yep.
00:33:59.474 - 00:34:27.356, Speaker C: Sorry, 1 second. I was just reading the question. Yeah. So, you know, basically, layer Zero Labs is this entity that basically the team came out of, built kind of the core technology behind Layer Zero. The protocol built the original iteration of Stargate, kind of the protocol. The technology side, largely, like after post launch, Stargate is issued, goes over the DAO. Now everything runs through the DAO.
00:34:27.356 - 00:35:10.862, Speaker C: So every major decision right now gets made through the DAO, how that actually gets executed. So, like, let's say Stargate has a new feature that the community basically says, this would be a sweet feature. This is going to help Stargate wins, generate volume, et cetera. Basically, proposal goes through, and then the development work right now is usually assisted by layers of your labs. Anybody could do that. Development work like the DAO could decide basically for anybody to do that. But right now, layers earlabs has been like assisting with that side of things in the same way as oftentimes we'll try to put together insights or track data or do things.
00:35:10.862 - 00:36:07.048, Speaker C: Most of that we just open up and try to make public so everybody has access to it. People can make better decisions, but I think for now, like layers, your labs is going to exist as this sort of like, technology entity who does development and sort of helps in general. But every decision and everything around the DAO itself basically decides that. So if the DAO decides they're, you know, new version, new feature, whatever, and somebody puts up. So this happens, you'll see on like Lido and some of the others where, um, service providers, technology providers would basically bid and say, hey, we'll deploy Lido to Solana and we want a grant of, I don't know, $5 million or something. Right. So all these people would kind of bid, and then the Lido Dao would kind of say like, okay, we've chosen this group to build this implementation of like, staked Sol on Solana and so on.
00:36:07.048 - 00:36:11.524, Speaker C: So ultimately the DAO has the choice, but that's. That's the relationship now.
00:36:12.524 - 00:36:46.764, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think it's important to point out that there are various community run projects like SCG scan built on top of Stargate itself that are completely community supporter. If we even the proposal that we were talking about where there's a request to produce monthly financial reporting and data from the Stargate community that's executed by the proposer. And as we see more and more proposals come forward, the proposal executes on that. So they're. As long as the community decides something worth doing.
00:36:50.104 - 00:37:11.756, Speaker A: Cool. Well, yeah, I think that's. That covers that. And then why you announced and. Sorry. And why tulp, that airdrop is from the Reuni wallet. That's something that's a totally separate project just as we were talking about here, like STG scan.
00:37:11.756 - 00:37:26.748, Speaker A: So that's also from name. So that's, you know, that. That's what that is referring to. So just to kind of clear that up for you, if you want, you can check that out. That is up on Commonwealth right now. That's public that you can check that out. And it's also on his twitter.
00:37:26.748 - 00:37:58.404, Speaker A: So, yeah, you can find that on Commonwealth. And then let's see, we've got. We just in White Snow we talked about. Yeah, pre mode kind of brought up the discussion here earlier around going to other networks. Obviously, Stargate is. It needs layer zero to, you know, to be on or be on that network in order to go there. So again, that's where like Metis being the 8th chain that Stargate has gone to.
00:37:58.404 - 00:38:07.804, Speaker A: Yeah. Again, any of these. That layer zero is. Any network that layer zero is on. Yeah. That's. Will be available in the future.
00:38:07.804 - 00:38:30.724, Speaker A: And then. Yeah, I see another one here about Tron yeah, if the community wants to go to Tron. Yeah, that would be. Yeah, I guess like the community could put up a poll for that again. Yeah. Just having to figure out how that's all going to work with liquidity and things. That's always a good idea to kind of keep that in mind with any type of proposal as well.
00:38:30.724 - 00:38:48.120, Speaker A: But yeah, I don't know anything further here from anyone. Yeah, Max or Primo. Anything else to kind of finish off with here as we wrap up, run through.
00:38:48.192 - 00:39:49.346, Speaker C: Right. Like end of the year or rather beginning, beginning of a new year. I think it's pretty interesting. Just kind of like look back over like what has happened, like what went well and I think it's just like crazy. I was reflecting a lot over the break and just like what? Like I still remember the day that Stargate launched and just like literally like very few expectations. We just built this thing and we were like very very confident in why it mattered and was significantly better than what existed and had this idea that this could really change the way that this stuff was done and that liquidity would kind of be handled in a completely different manner and two years out than the way it was right now. And so watching those first two weeks as TVL just like was going up and up and up and all of a sudden you have four plus billion dollars sitting in this protocol.
00:39:49.346 - 00:40:35.142, Speaker C: It was just like super surreal. Right? So like I think it's crazy now looking kind of looking back from that moment of just like launching and having no expectations. But this idea to watching now where like Stargate has been dominating just like the pure number of messages users how many people are touching the protocol just like you know, dominating any other sort of solution around that in terms of bridging or anything else. You know, basically top three always in dollar volume and that includes like even many of the native bridges which is crazy. Largest Dao in the world according to Snapshot. Last three votes at 72,070. 2060.
00:40:35.142 - 00:41:30.514, Speaker C: 3000 active votes. So if you put that in perspective like the largest fully on chain Dow is Uniswap and they have 27,000 lifetime voters in the largest single proposal turnout of like 5800 people. If you look at the largest, next largest DeFi protocol on snapshot not on chain similar to Stargate that would be aave 79,000 members. And the last three proposals each have like 6000 active votes. So I think it's just been like really amazing to see how interested and motivated people have been around this idea. And so I think it's really important that like over the next twelve months I think is going to be really critical stage where like as a protocol we've always talked about how does Stargate win? Right. It doesn't win by just being the best bridge.
00:41:30.514 - 00:42:30.116, Speaker C: I think that's helpful, but it's not like the users are sort of driving on an individual basis. It wins long term by being the best bridge. Underlying that everybody interacts with, everybody taps into that sort of is like by all of these other applications that sort of make it what it is. And I think this year is really like the year the protocol needs to focus on that. So I'm super interested in seeing like what comes out of sort of the entire process and the governance process around that framing itself. And really just like how do you make like how do you continue to increase efficiency of the underlying protocol to make sure that basically you continue to be, to be chosen, to be wrapped, to be used by all of these external applications to be the go to. And I think security has been like the big thing relative to everything else.
00:42:30.116 - 00:42:36.224, Speaker C: Obviously Stargate has had way more money in the protocol than basically anybody else has been around.
00:42:40.884 - 00:42:45.224, Speaker A: Oh, did we lose him? Or is it just me.
00:43:00.444 - 00:43:06.314, Speaker B: Somewhere passionately into realizing that?
00:43:06.474 - 00:43:36.024, Speaker A: Let's just give it a second here. Let's see. Is it working now? Max, you've still got audio.
00:43:38.764 - 00:43:51.584, Speaker B: I'm here. Primo just, primo just isn't. I think we're having a little bit of a, you know, a memorial for him. The voice attack channel.
00:43:55.384 - 00:43:56.960, Speaker C: Is my voice still not working there.
00:43:56.992 - 00:44:03.084, Speaker A: Now we got you. It's not sure what happened we have yet. So I'm not sure where we kind of lost you.
00:44:06.544 - 00:45:29.664, Speaker C: I mean, I guess I'll just summarize very quickly with saying like that over the next year I think really is going to be a turning point for the protocol is like how do you increase that efficiency? How do we keep growing protocol and liquidity while minimizing the amount of emissions that need to, to be given out? I think this metis implementation is like an amazing start to that because obviously they have provided these incentives. They're going to be driving volume, they're going to be driving or providing TVL. So it's not Stargate sort of having these huge emissions and yet we get volume, we get more ecosystem, we get a lot of this. And so I think what that looks like on an ongoing basis over the next year will be hugely important. I think SIP 20 with a foundation is sort of assisting with rebalancing a world in some of these outlier events, the protocol would have captured $300,000 in a single short period of time of protocol and liquidity just from rebalancing those and being on top of that as is, it's already going to be tens, possibly tens of thousands a month even at normal usage. That the protocol is just getting direct value and protocol and liquidity, which is less emissions and future. So I think everything that can be done that can increase volume, decrease emissions like this is going to be the year for that.
00:45:29.664 - 00:46:01.824, Speaker C: And I know there are a lot of people, a lot of people have pinged me about things that they are thinking about ways to do this, but I think that will be like the biggest thing the community can do is continue to iterate on that. We'll grow underlying usage, tons of cool stuff happening. In reflection, the last nine months have been insane. I think objectively Stargate has done more than basically anybody expected it to, but there's still like a huge amount more that it can do. So yeah, I don't know. It'll be a fun year.
00:46:02.724 - 00:46:19.854, Speaker A: Awesome. Well said there, primo, encouraging words here for 23. So thank you very much for all of that. All right. Yeah, probably a great place to wrap it up there. Yeah. Thanks everybody for coming out.
00:46:19.854 - 00:46:22.454, Speaker A: This has been, this has been awesome.
00:46:23.394 - 00:46:29.914, Speaker B: We have a couple more questions that I'm happy to go through quickly.
00:46:29.994 - 00:46:30.814, Speaker A: Oh sure.
00:46:32.354 - 00:47:15.512, Speaker B: Which I think we should address before we wrap up. There's a question around when using a bridge aggregator like bungie, competitive bridges end up being used. The question is why? Each bridge aggregator quote is unique. It compares all bridges in the market at that split second in time. I can say from data that we see, Stargate is heavily used when compared to stables. It's the cheapest and most used bridge there in a lot of cases. We as a community should be continually looking at ways to make surrogate more competitive versus competitive set if that's not happening.
00:47:15.512 - 00:48:30.064, Speaker B: So for example, that's a piece of data that we could ask to be produced as a community to try and analyze. But I think the protocol should continually be looking at ways to be more competitive on a bridge aggregation standpoint. But we do get a good amount of volume through our bridge aggregation partners as is. So I think I'd just be careful around looking at singular data as sort of, you know, a source of truth rather than a holistic picture of every transaction that's going through. And then Copperfield has a question about roadmap for SDG and long term plans, as well as a request for more activity on the marketing side, I think I'm having to talk about what my long term vision is, which I think has happened before as a community member. I think the idea that Stargate gets to a spot where it has sufficient protocol on liquidity to support transfers or usage of that liquidity transfer layer without the need for emissions as sort of the end game. And that's where the protocol is trudging towards it or going towards marching towards.
00:48:30.064 - 00:49:29.684, Speaker B: And I think things like the procall liquidity transparency dashboard that's come out and other initiatives that will continue to shine, you know, a spotlight on what the protocol has, how that Pol is building. So an example of the rebalancing reports is an example of that will continue to show growth towards that end state. I think everything else is sort of a middle ground of how to get more volume, how to generate more fees to get to that end state where Stargate is this omnipresent building block within defi that people can compose on top of and know that there's liquidity always there to allow them to do whatever they're intending to build, be that omnichain borrowing and be that omnichannel yield aggregation or any other use case that people can think of. And I'm really excited about all the teams that are building on top of Stargate to achieve some of those goals right now.
00:49:32.604 - 00:49:58.162, Speaker A: Wonderful. All right, anything else from the community here? No, thanks very much, Max, for touching on those. Yeah. And then I see, like, some people talking about the Galaxy passport and SBT. Yeah, there's a couple different things we've been looking at into this. And. Yeah, of course, once guild gets the.
00:49:58.162 - 00:50:27.212, Speaker A: The voice channel feature working again, that'll resolve a lot of things that was working fantastic before, just waiting for them. So hopefully they've got that sorted in the next month or so, but, yeah. All right. If nothing further, probably a great place to wrap it up here. This has been. This has been a long one today. A good way to start the year off here with a lot of engagement, a lot of questions.
00:50:27.212 - 00:50:46.648, Speaker A: Um, yeah, a lot of cool stuff coming, so, um, yeah, thanks, everybody. Stay tuned.
