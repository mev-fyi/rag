00:00:04.240 - 00:00:59.384, Speaker A: Welcome to the Stargate finance community call, where we discuss proposals and ideas that help shape and govern the Stargate protocol. Okay, updates for this week here. Curious if anybody had a chance to try out the native gas delivery. Super stoked about this feature, being able to drop yourself native gas on the destination chain. I for one, just used it yesterday when I needed a little more gas over on optimism to do claiming, but I hope everybody claimed their optimism, Airdrop as well if they were eligible. But yeah, curious if anybody's had a chance to try that out and thoughts or comments around it, but it's something that I'm like, super stoked about because you can go any network with and always be able to get native gas and not have to worry about, like, because even if it's like the ETH, like ETH stuff or, you know, as you go to any other networks, like, it's all just converts and works. Works well.
00:00:59.384 - 00:01:43.324, Speaker A: But yeah, I don't know if anybody's got feedback on that. Would love to hear about it come on up or bring it into the text questions. But I've also posted a video on YouTube which is doing a whole speed run. So being able to go through all the networks with just having like native gas on Mainnet and just shooting $100 USDC all the way around the other six networks. But yeah, so if you haven't had a chance, check that out and yeah, give those, give that a test out and give us some feedback on it. Love to hear if there's anything we need to improve or how that feature works. But yeah, hopefully had a chance.
00:01:45.474 - 00:01:45.874, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:45.914 - 00:01:55.574, Speaker A: Then we do have the circulating supply is also in the works. That's getting close now, I think. Max, that's, that's looking, that's looking good, correct?
00:01:57.674 - 00:02:07.394, Speaker C: Yeah, looking good. The tech work on our side is done. Just syncing with the coinmarketcap and coin deck that integrated on their sites. All good.
00:02:07.474 - 00:02:09.554, Speaker B: Perfect. Perfect. Okay.
00:02:09.594 - 00:02:11.374, Speaker A: Yeah, so hopefully those teams can.
00:02:12.004 - 00:02:12.356, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:12.380 - 00:02:39.124, Speaker A: Get that pushed out for us. I know it's something everyone's wanted for a while, so just want to let everybody know that that is happening and that will be updated soon. Just, of course, going across seven networks requires a little bit, so that. And then, Maki, are you able to kind of walk us through the bribes for this week? Yeah, just kind of through vodium and curve and some of the crv that's been generated and how that's all looking.
00:02:42.624 - 00:02:43.404, Speaker B: Yep.
00:02:43.864 - 00:03:10.136, Speaker D: So this week we private like 100,000 less than the previous cycle. We were able to make over 100,000 plus in crv and convex which were stake we haven't been voting yet in the gauge. We will be doing this before the end of the week. And. Yeah. That's been going very well. I'm very impressed with the result we were.
00:03:10.136 - 00:03:18.644, Speaker D: So we will be probably able to tone down on any single bribe in the next one or two cycle.
00:03:19.904 - 00:03:21.176, Speaker B: Yeah. Wicked. Yeah.
00:03:21.200 - 00:03:25.472, Speaker A: So that's the whole point there is just being able to as we get more of those emissions we.
00:03:25.528 - 00:03:25.856, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:25.920 - 00:03:31.204, Speaker A: Less bribing is required so that we actually have a say in the gauge to vote for our own pool.
00:03:31.914 - 00:03:48.214, Speaker D: And so far just as a total per se as a whole we've been only spending that total aggregated of almost under a million. So it's not nowhere near like the five that was proposed in the proposal so far.
00:03:48.634 - 00:03:49.282, Speaker B: All right. Yeah.
00:03:49.298 - 00:03:56.054, Speaker A: And it seems to have been effective obviously with revenue that's been generated here as far as CRV and whatnot.
00:03:56.574 - 00:03:57.246, Speaker B: Yeah. Sorry.
00:03:57.270 - 00:04:06.158, Speaker A: What did you say was the numbers on how much had been generated so far? Do you know off how it was.
00:04:06.206 - 00:04:08.350, Speaker D: Over 150 I believe.
00:04:08.502 - 00:04:08.838, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:08.886 - 00:04:09.862, Speaker D: 150,000.
00:04:09.958 - 00:04:12.150, Speaker B: Wow. Perfect. Yes.
00:04:12.182 - 00:04:14.390, Speaker A: That seems to be paying out already.
00:04:14.542 - 00:04:15.022, Speaker B: But yeah.
00:04:15.038 - 00:04:16.794, Speaker A: I was looking yesterday on.
00:04:18.654 - 00:04:19.270, Speaker B: Whatever that.
00:04:19.302 - 00:04:39.732, Speaker A: Site is just past when you err on vodium it was looking like the bribes were like paying out a dollar. Let's see here. There's a dollar 49 is what they were kind of suggesting. But dollar 39 today is what kind of like what the emissions per $1 spent on bribes. So it does seem.
00:04:39.908 - 00:04:40.260, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:40.292 - 00:04:54.044, Speaker A: Bribing seems to be positive. So that's pretty sweet. I'm glad that that's working out. But I don't know if anybody's got Questions comments concerns around bribes or anything further here.
00:04:54.344 - 00:04:55.084, Speaker B: But.
00:04:59.064 - 00:05:03.684, Speaker A: Ray J. Thanks for the poop claim for the proof of attendance chat.
00:05:06.104 - 00:05:06.552, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:06.608 - 00:05:07.284, Speaker A: Anyways.
00:05:08.504 - 00:05:08.944, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:08.984 - 00:05:23.572, Speaker A: As far as the next things here. ETH pools are very close to being deployed. Some other stuff has been set up in place so that moving forward. Any other ercs that need to be deployed?
00:05:23.748 - 00:05:24.100, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:24.132 - 00:05:43.384, Speaker A: With like the infrastructure that's in place now. It's going to be super easy to deploy any new assets that get added in. So yeah. It was nice that this structure has been set up and be able to like just deploy new assets relatively quickly after this. So.
00:05:43.964 - 00:05:44.452, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:44.508 - 00:05:57.754, Speaker A: I think we're looking. And then once those ETH assets are deployed to. You know we'll have pools and every sorry emissions set up for those and the incentives around that and.
00:05:58.614 - 00:05:59.326, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know.
00:05:59.350 - 00:06:31.618, Speaker A: Should be as soon as hoping early next week is kind of what we're targeting to have this all dialed in. So, yeah, we'll keep everybody updated on that. But yeah, just like the way that this has been set up, we'll be able to dial this in. So it's. Yeah, it's ready to deploy any ERC 20 token afterwards. So it should be a cool little feature to have on that. Okay, next up.
00:06:31.618 - 00:06:42.754, Speaker A: Yeah, the USDD pool or proposal has passed. So those pools will be set up shortly. Yeah, shortly after ETH pools. I think those should be good to go.
00:06:43.814 - 00:06:44.142, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:44.158 - 00:07:18.834, Speaker A: And again, just so like, you know, I know there was some concern around that on the forums and whatnot, but this is, you know, those pools are autonomous to themselves, so there's. Yeah, no risk or anything taking on. I know there's some people that were concerned about UST risk, but, yeah, that would be, it is autonomous to itself, so those risks are mitigated. And, yeah, if there's another place that wants to do another token similar to that, we're going to be set up with what we just described here as being able to deploy those relatively quickly.
00:07:21.294 - 00:07:21.622, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:21.638 - 00:08:02.422, Speaker A: And then as far as the op token airdrop update for Stargate. Yeah, op or optimism had. Yeah, I just requested some changes around that. So that has been updated to be 700,000 op tokens going to liquidity mining program and then, or DF program for six months, and then same thing for six months for partners and integrations for 300,000. 300,000 op tokens will be issued over that six months as well. So, yeah, same kind of, you know, as it was before with the, the previous proposal. It's just we had to remove the.
00:08:02.422 - 00:08:27.434, Speaker A: The bonding auction and just allocated the funds across the two other things that we had voted on. So, yeah, that I've just recently put up another proposal outlining the exact. What this is again now. And we'll put that up to snapshot to be voted on so that that passes our governance process or, you know, so that we do. We do get those op tokens and are able to distribute them to the.
00:08:27.894 - 00:08:28.342, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:28.398 - 00:08:50.558, Speaker A: To community here. So, yeah. Any comments on that? All right, no problem there. But okay. With. Yeah, as we were kind of talking about the ETH pools and, you know, emissions and whatnot here. Yeah, Max, if you can.
00:08:50.558 - 00:09:06.584, Speaker A: Here, let's. We'll go through some of these proposals that have passed here. So, like the ongoing emissions model and, you know, the pathway waiting and then we can kind of talk into the initial ETH pool implementation and all that. So if you can yeah, just going to take it away.
00:09:08.564 - 00:09:55.970, Speaker C: At the end of the day, the ETH pools, USDT pools, this all drives towards that, you know, Northstar metric for Stargate and driving transaction volume. So I'm really excited to see how much volume is going to come in on the ETH pools. It's just such a strong use case for people moving from the l two s back to ETH. I think it's going to be in pretty high demand. But these other proposals, the ongoing emissions updates, some of the pathway weights being updated. At the end of the day, the goals of these things are to make sure that Stargate is balanced so that it is usable applications and users that are using Stargate are getting the best pricing on their transfers. So the updating emissions and the pathway waits, that should go into effect today.
00:09:55.970 - 00:10:42.872, Speaker C: And then the incentives on the ETH pools will go live once the ETH pools are live as well. And I think it was shooting for Monday next week, but, yeah, essentially with the incentives on the e pools, we're shooting for about 50 million in liquidity. There's a little bit of forecasting estimation in this work in terms of how much the market values, the emissions related to ETH pools. I think it's going to be somewhat different from stablecoins, but again, I think we're shooting for that 50 million in liquidity ETH. And, yeah, so really excited about seeing the ongoing emissions plan, the pathway weights getting implemented. I think this will bring more balance to target system, making transfers more cost efficient. And then.
00:10:42.872 - 00:10:55.624, Speaker C: Yeah, again, like the ETH pools, the USDT pools, I think this is going to go a long way in terms of driving transaction volumes. And then, of course, protocol fees earned over time. So all good stuff.
00:10:55.784 - 00:10:58.364, Speaker A: Yeah, perfect. Cool.
00:10:58.904 - 00:10:59.328, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:59.376 - 00:11:13.294, Speaker A: And then with the ETH pools, like you were saying there for early next week, and then, of course, there'll be, I think you've outlined as well, like what the. How the waiting paths will work and where the emissions will be.
00:11:13.954 - 00:11:14.290, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:14.322 - 00:11:18.298, Speaker A: Where the emissions will be directed to as well, to help.
00:11:18.466 - 00:11:51.688, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. The pathway weights just add a little bit of color on that. It's just to make sure that the most in demand pathways for Stargate are getting sufficient liquidity. Right. So, for example, if you look at the data, you'll see that ETH, USDC to AVAx, USDC is a very high in demand pathway. We want to make sure that that pathway is getting enough liquidity to support the transfer demand. So it's really just about making sure that and versus other pathways that are not being used as frequently, those will have lower weights.
00:11:51.688 - 00:12:00.742, Speaker C: So again, this all ties back into making sure there's enough balance within the bridging system so that people are getting the best price on their transfers.
00:12:00.838 - 00:12:01.302, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:01.398 - 00:12:30.994, Speaker A: Cool, cool. And then, yeah, as far as, like Aki was saying here, no audits necessary here for the ETH pools. But, yeah. Good that we're getting close here with that. And then as far as the other weights and everything. Yeah. Has anybody got questions around that stuff? Yeah, I guess at the end of the day, this is all just about optimizing and making this the most efficient way possible to, like, for Stargate to run.
00:12:30.994 - 00:12:42.366, Speaker A: I don't know. Do you have a prediction on how often you're going to need to change those pathways or reevaluate at least or see what's up? Obviously, we want to outline that.
00:12:42.390 - 00:12:49.790, Speaker C: I think it's going to be on a monthly basis. The first of every month. The pathway waits and the emissions will get updated.
00:12:49.982 - 00:12:50.754, Speaker B: Perfect.
00:12:52.494 - 00:13:51.884, Speaker A: I do see a hand up here, but come on up, ali, if you're looking to chat on that. Yeah. Has anybody else got questions, comments, concerns on any of the wait stuff? All right, no, that's good then. Yeah, that's kind of the main stuff here to cover this week, but, yeah, just wanted to also touch on. We're doing these every two weeks now moving forward one week was covering a lot of stuff here constantly. So, yeah, just if it's. I think two weeks is a better cadence around this and, yeah, we'll keep everyone posted on the two weeks and I think keeping the same time.
00:13:51.884 - 00:14:14.544, Speaker A: I don't know if anybody has comments here. I think in the last call we'd, you know, everyone was happy with. With this outline or this or this timing. Anyways, if anybody's got any comments on it, please let us know. But, yeah, does anybody else from my end?
00:14:14.624 - 00:15:07.274, Speaker E: Yeah, I just want to bring up, like, there's a couple things I think broadly, like, still needs to get done. I think overall, the pool, like, Max's proposal to balance of the pools with the new emissions is going to be super helpful. I think we're going to likely be trying to redo the equilibrium fee and the reward fee so that they're not. So the reward fee is not strictly linear in that the equilibrium fee maybe kicks in slightly sooner such that it helps. Like, what you don't want is to hit a state in the pool balance where it's too expensive for anybody to trade in one direction, but there's not enough reward accrued. So, like, the area under the curve by then for, you know, for somebody, a party to step in and sort of go the entire other way. So I think that is something that gets done.
00:15:07.274 - 00:15:47.888, Speaker E: I think we'll try to kind of poke some market makers and ask them to rebalance the pool. There is enough reward fee in there to be kind of slightly profitable now, but probably not enough for them to really pay attention to. I think it's about seven to nine bps on a six bip fees, you're taking like three bps, one to three bps profit in order to sort of take inventory in another chain. So that's close. I think around five bps. Most people would definitely do it, like five to seven bps. So, yeah, I think adjusting those will definitely help.
00:15:47.888 - 00:16:43.100, Speaker E: And then I think we have to get. So we're going to get ETH pools added, should be a bunch more volume going to get USD pools added, should be a bunch more volume going to fix the fees to the balancing is a little bit better in general. And then we have to get the new library in terms of fee library so that the partners get their fees so that everyone can start integrating the widget and we can start getting all these big partners onboarded. So I think like the next, by the next community call two weeks from now, I would be reasonably unhappy if, like, most of that was not fully done. So all of it is just engineering constrained. But I think there's a bunch of stuff sort of happening now that hopefully should start snowballing into, like, everything, you know, both the pools being more balanced and more volume being driven. So I think that's kind of broad goal.
00:16:43.100 - 00:17:09.996, Speaker E: I just wanted to touch on. I know we touched on each of these individually, but like as high level sort, sort of vision, I think it's important. Like, we've had some really good governance proposals passed that make the protocol meaningfully better. And I think it's okay. Get all of these things actually implemented and out into production, get the new pools up, get them more volume and get the partners going. And, like, that's where we start seeing real volume come. And then, you know, the math behind what that looks like.
00:17:09.996 - 00:17:38.434, Speaker E: I'm sure people will do it. But right now it's been about a billion dollars a month in volume, roughly somewhere loosely around there. Maybe slate, maybe like 850 million. So I think on each of those components, it's going to start being like, reasonably meaningful, especially a volume, you know, can two to three x. From here, those numbers will start getting pretty attractive for both the ve side of things and some of the other stuff. So. Yeah, lots to do, but let's just do it.
00:17:39.774 - 00:17:42.598, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
00:17:42.646 - 00:18:10.804, Speaker A: Yeah, no, thanks for the unpacking, all of that. So, yeah, if, you know, if anybody's got questions, comments around any of that stuff, let us know either here or afterwards. Feel free to reach out. Just DM's or whatever as well. I'm happy to take anything from there. And I do see, like, passive crypto was talking about, like, balancer pools as well. Yeah, I don't.
00:18:10.804 - 00:18:28.644, Speaker A: Not super familiar with those, but I don't maki, if you've got any color or light there on what that could be or what that could look like and just repeat on what, just the balancer pool. I was seeing some comments around balancer pools with the 80 20.
00:18:29.664 - 00:18:42.674, Speaker D: Yeah, we have a 50 50 right now. We're like the main lp, so the Il is not really, like a concern per se. We're just gonna try to do, like, a small bribe, just see how it behave potentially on the next round.
00:18:43.854 - 00:18:44.206, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:44.230 - 00:19:07.456, Speaker D: It's something we didn't really focus on, but could make sense. So we'll see how it goes. I don't. I'm not sure if, like, the incentives are cross chain at the moment for balance or need to verify. So we'll dive into it a little bit more before, you know, doing a thing. Anyway, probably do, like, a proposal on this front for moving the greens or staking it where else? So.
00:19:07.560 - 00:19:09.536, Speaker B: Yeah, gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah.
00:19:09.560 - 00:19:42.948, Speaker A: And just want to make sure that, you know, everybody understands that. Yeah, please. If you see something like this that you're like, hey, I'm curious about, but what this can. What this could be or what this could look like, you know, do some research, do the, you know, look into it. Dive into it, see if it makes sense. Crunch numbers, you know, bring up some data and stuff like that and put that up on call on Commonwealth, you know, really, you know, happy with, like, what we're seeing so far as far, people commenting and, you know, bringing up, you know, ideas in the. In Commonwealth.
00:19:42.948 - 00:20:18.132, Speaker A: But I, you know, I really want to drive as much traffic as possible there. Yeah, it's a great platform, and, you know, we want to be able to have all of these discussions, like, out in the open and rather than, you know, having, you know, just a couple people talk about it and, you know, come up with ideas, like, let's. Yeah, post it up there and just see where this can go. Because, yeah, these. This is what governance is all about. We want to see, you know, everyone engaged and involved. And, you know, I, you know, maybe a small idea might turn into something big, too.
00:20:18.132 - 00:20:44.622, Speaker A: So feel free to get onto Commonwealth, comment on stuff, put up proposals, like any of that stuff. I've outlined some proposal guidelines as well. And if you've got some ideas and you're just, like, not sure how to do this, or it's your first time, don't hesitate to reach out to me. Really want to, you know, really want to see that. So reach out to me, and I'll be happy to help you with. With any of that stuff. But cool.
00:20:44.678 - 00:20:44.846, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:44.870 - 00:20:59.544, Speaker A: If anybody has questions, come on up or reach out. And as far as Solana, seeing some questions around that, too, primo, I don't know if you can touch on Solana or where we're at with that.
00:21:00.644 - 00:21:15.034, Speaker E: Yeah, Solana is. Everything's pretty good so far. Audits are looking good. We're internally on Devnet. We'll be going live publicly on Devnet. So just to be clear, there's two stages of Solana, right? First stages like layer zero endpoint. Second stage is like Stargate.
00:21:15.034 - 00:21:37.834, Speaker E: They both require complete rewrites of the code. So the layer zero endpoint is in Devnet internally. We'll be live on Devnet shortly, and then it will be sort of pub. Yeah. So when it's live on Devnet, they'll be public for everybody to play with Mainnet. You're talking maybe five weeks away, something like that, roughly. And then it's going to be a Stargate rewrite after that.
00:21:37.834 - 00:21:56.074, Speaker E: And then we just need to figure out, kind of send that through the audit process. So that will be definitely longer. Any new chain with Stargate is always like, right. You're tying pools of liquidity to each other across these chains. Everything. You just need as many audits as humanly possible. Sort of.
00:21:56.074 - 00:22:32.964, Speaker E: Everything has to be just ultra conservative. So, yeah, you're talking a little bit longer for Stargate and kind of go through that process. But I'm actually pretty optimistic, I think, right now, when you're talking about actual liquid inventory, Stargate is the, or certainly one of the most liquid bridges anywhere right now. Past wormhole, past a bunch of the others, at least, last time I had checked. And, you know, there is wrapped assets anyways, not native. So I think when we go there, I think once. Yeah, once we do finally get there, I think we'll be really adding a huge amount of value into the salon ecosystem.
00:22:32.964 - 00:22:54.144, Speaker E: And I'm pretty optimistic about that. So, yeah, it's like, it's not super, super soon for the Stargate side, because, again, it does take an entire rewrite of the, the protocol and just have to. Security needs to come before anything else, but it's definitely coming. Yeah.
00:22:55.964 - 00:22:57.116, Speaker B: All right. Yeah.
00:22:57.140 - 00:22:59.052, Speaker A: Sweet. Thank you for updates on that.
00:22:59.108 - 00:22:59.444, Speaker E: And.
00:22:59.524 - 00:23:36.430, Speaker A: Yeah, good to hear that. Security is the key thing here because we've seen enough problems with security issues around bridges and exploits and things like this. So that should be paramount. Absolutely. Okay. Anything further from anyone? Any questions, comments, concerns on that? Yeah, if not, no, we can probably wrap it up here. We've got, like I say, we'll have, we'll have another snapshot.
00:23:36.430 - 00:23:53.314, Speaker A: Proposal will go up here just to. Yeah. With the changes around the op token airdrop for Stargate. So just the reallocation of that. So heads up for that. Be sure to head out and vote and. Yeah, we can.
00:23:53.814 - 00:23:54.190, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:54.222 - 00:23:58.914, Speaker A: And then we'll just keep you posted on all that stuff, of course, but, yeah.
00:23:59.414 - 00:24:06.634, Speaker E: And just to be clear, I saw somebody posting about why the op thing changed. We didn't really touch on that. Right.
00:24:06.944 - 00:24:14.024, Speaker A: Just kind of mentioned that they. Optimism wasn't the bonding optimization.
00:24:14.064 - 00:24:48.518, Speaker E: So basically, optimism said there's a deadline for optimism proposal. They said that if, like, in its current state, we would not qualify. So that was obviously not ideal. So there are just some constraints around what could be done with the proposal. And ours basically contradicted that. So they helped us adjust to a different proposal. We put up that different modified proposal, and then now it has to go back and basically pass through Stargate governance.
00:24:48.518 - 00:25:24.434, Speaker E: So the options are basically, if we decline that, then we likely will not get any because the deadline has passed. So we can't change it on their side. So the question is basically, you know, just, do we want an optimism airdrop or not is basically what it comes down to. But, you know, we went through our governance. They, you know, we thought they had signed off at first, and then some changes happened on their end. And so it just, you know, it's, it's very, very similar with just a few constraints. So, yeah, that's, that's the state of that.
00:25:25.254 - 00:25:26.594, Speaker A: All right, cool.
00:25:26.674 - 00:25:26.882, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:26.898 - 00:25:59.514, Speaker A: And of course, if anybody has questions on that, please reach out. But, yeah, hopefully that covers it. So. Yeah, yeah. And then as I see these last questions here about creating demand here with SDG token. Yeah, I know there's discussions on the fee accrual or for, for ve holders and. Yeah, let's those, like I say, head to over to Commonwealth, get involved in that discussion, you know, start talking that through.
00:25:59.514 - 00:26:29.254, Speaker A: But, yeah, that's, that's ultimately, it's up to the community, right? Like, if that's something that you guys really want, push, you know, continue that conversation, make some noise about it. You know, some of the last comments there from Izzybell was like, more focused around protocol and liquidity. But, you know, if fee, you know, fees to ve holders is something that everyone else wants, please go to Commonwealth, talk about it. Let's. Let's get that out and, you know, out into the open for.
00:26:30.234 - 00:27:12.574, Speaker E: I think in the current state, somebody ran the numbers yesterday. There's something pretty egregious, like if. If the fee proposal. So once this new library gets passed based on the current number of Ve Stargate holders, assuming that the fee is going to only ve and not team investors or any of the auction people, but just ve, which I believe is what was passed, it would be something like every month, people would be getting like 20% of their, like 15% to 20% of their Ve position. So if you owned $1,000 of Ve Stargate, you know, you'd be getting like $150 to $200 per month. So like 200% APY just. Just to hold ve.
00:27:12.574 - 00:28:14.904, Speaker E: Obviously, once that goes live and people, you know, those numbers are what they are, other people are going to up and then those numbers will go down. But like, in the current state of things, I think there will be a pretty reasonable incentive for people to want to own ve Stargate. Yeah. And then I think from there, again, now, if we're getting into the long tail assets, so again, like USDD being added and potentially a bunch of other assets being added, that's potentially a bunch more fees. But also, there's also, like, a world where there does become, like your more traditional ve structure, where emissions are not set by a fixed curve on the primary stable pools of USDC and USD. But maybe like, you know, 50% are for those, and then 50% are like a gauge that people can use the v tokens to vote for. So there's a couple different mechanisms here that, yeah, I think community can explore over time.
00:28:14.904 - 00:28:24.604, Speaker E: I think the biggest thing right now is just like, get as much volume as humanly possible going across the protocol, and then after that, it's very easy to kind of reassign the buckets.
00:28:26.264 - 00:28:27.444, Speaker F: Hello? Kelly?
00:28:29.344 - 00:28:30.456, Speaker A: Yeah, hi. Yummy gold.
00:28:30.520 - 00:28:31.724, Speaker F: Is Kelly there?
00:28:32.344 - 00:28:34.164, Speaker E: Kelly is. She's in the audience.
00:28:38.924 - 00:28:40.504, Speaker A: Yomi, go ahead.
00:28:41.044 - 00:28:42.948, Speaker F: I want to ask a question, please. Are you there?
00:28:43.036 - 00:28:44.144, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead.
00:28:45.644 - 00:28:50.464, Speaker F: What's. What's the cost of this current dip in STG?
00:28:52.044 - 00:29:19.374, Speaker E: What is the cause of it? The cause of it is that there are more sellers than buyers. You know, it's just a market like anything else. Right. Why did it go up to almost $5 before? Why did it go down to this? It's just a function of demand. I think the broad market has gotten pretty crushed overall. But I think ultimately, you know, there's more people selling than there are buying. And I don't think it's anything more complicated than that.
00:29:19.374 - 00:29:25.470, Speaker E: I think, yeah, must be a reason for that.
00:29:25.582 - 00:29:29.034, Speaker F: I think so, for them to sell instead of buying.
00:29:29.734 - 00:29:31.994, Speaker E: Well, what. What do you think the reason is?
00:29:38.604 - 00:29:39.824, Speaker A: All right, Yomi.
00:29:42.724 - 00:29:53.132, Speaker E: That may be true. Right. That's why these calls are here. That's why all these proposals are going through. I agree. Right. We're getting ETH added, USdd added.
00:29:53.132 - 00:30:23.984, Speaker E: You need more fees. Right. Everything is a function of the value of the overall protocol or network, right. And so the value comes from volume, from protocol of liquidity. I think right now, there's like more protocol on liquidity than the circulating market cap or that was the state for a while. I think that is still the state. So, you know, at the end of the day, it's grown that right now, over the last two months, we've made a million something.
00:30:23.984 - 00:31:16.110, Speaker E: So the protocol is definitely accruing some value there. But I think the goal needs to be kind of three to five x that while decreasing emissions. And so, again, stuff like USDD helps a ton, because that's pure fees without any emission stuff. You know, if, again, if they're long tail assets, if others are sort of adding here, we can make this a more long tail, generalized sort of omnidirectional bridge. Omni chain bridge, for every long tail asset, where, you know, they can basically put up their own assets and make their users be able to migrate anywhere, then that's another thing that's potentially very attractive and does not cost the protocol emissions. So it's all just a bunch of math, man. You just keep making it better and build something that is genuinely super useful at both the protocol level and the user level.
00:31:16.110 - 00:31:55.994, Speaker E: So I think we built a consumer product that is pretty awesome. But the goal had always been to build something that is used by all of the protocols. So again, the sushiswap integration, when that's live, that will be like the first big one, right, of a pure integration with Stargate on the backend of like every multi chain trade. And after that, I know, I think a couple of them have been mentioned, but I won't say who, because I don't remember exactly what has been mentioned and what hasn't. But yeah, there will be a bunch of integrations, and that's where sarge itself really thrives. And so it's just like maintaining that liquidity and making that stuff super functional.
00:31:58.314 - 00:32:04.234, Speaker F: All right, thank you. Thank you very much. We hope. We trust in you guys. We trust in you guys. Thank you very much.
00:32:04.394 - 00:32:05.090, Speaker B: All right, thank you.
00:32:05.122 - 00:32:09.614, Speaker E: Appreciate it. Thanks. Thanks for being here and participating, man. That's how everything gets better.
00:32:11.154 - 00:32:11.770, Speaker B: Wicked.
00:32:11.842 - 00:32:32.222, Speaker A: Thank you, Yomi. All right. Yeah, and speaking of the integrations, there sushi timeline, not 100% where they're at on their. On all of this, but I think, yeah, we'd still be a couple weeks away closer.
00:32:32.398 - 00:32:41.102, Speaker C: They're pretty close. They're actively working on it. We're talking to them every day. So, yeah, they're close. Hopefully within, you know, the next week.
00:32:41.238 - 00:32:42.718, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay.
00:32:42.886 - 00:32:50.994, Speaker A: So, yeah, lots of. Lots of stuff happening there, but, yeah, want to make sure this is all dialed in and perfect.
00:32:51.434 - 00:32:51.866, Speaker B: So.
00:32:51.930 - 00:33:01.210, Speaker A: And then as far as the emissions token unlocks, if you just head into the git books, you can find it there. So reach out on discord if you're having trouble finding that. But it should be pretty straightforward.
00:33:01.282 - 00:33:02.106, Speaker B: If you just head over to the.
00:33:02.130 - 00:33:08.122, Speaker A: FAQ channel, you'll be able to hold the resources there to get you what you need.
00:33:08.298 - 00:33:09.738, Speaker B: But. Okay.
00:33:09.826 - 00:33:31.662, Speaker A: Anything further from anyone, questions, comments, concerns, but, yeah, hopefully this has been a good update for everyone. And, yeah, we'll move these to every two weeks going forward and, yeah, go from there, but.
00:33:31.838 - 00:33:32.674, Speaker B: Okay.
00:33:32.974 - 00:33:57.182, Speaker A: Thank you, Max. Thanks, Primo. Thanks, everybody for coming on here. And like I say, questions, comments, concerns, either reach out to us, DM's in. In discord, have those conversations, and get over to Commonwealth and get to get active and, you know, proposals or, you know, comment on stuff. That's where, you know, that's where change happens. That's where the governance is, starts from.
00:33:57.182 - 00:34:19.301, Speaker A: So get there, get involved. I do appreciate everybody coming out to these calls and would love to see, you know, each and every one of you over in Commonwealth and participating there as well. So. Okay, we can wrap it up here. And for those looking for a PO app, just stick around and I'll let you know when those are all ready to go, but.
00:34:19.477 - 00:34:20.149, Speaker B: Okay.
00:34:20.261 - 00:34:23.233, Speaker A: Thanks, everybody, and we'll catch you in a couple of weeks.
00:34:24.053 - 00:34:24.861, Speaker E: Thanks, Tango.
00:34:24.917 - 00:34:25.557, Speaker C: Thanks, guys.
00:34:25.645 - 00:34:26.557, Speaker A: Thanks, Tango.
00:34:26.605 - 00:34:28.653, Speaker B: See you guys. Bye.
