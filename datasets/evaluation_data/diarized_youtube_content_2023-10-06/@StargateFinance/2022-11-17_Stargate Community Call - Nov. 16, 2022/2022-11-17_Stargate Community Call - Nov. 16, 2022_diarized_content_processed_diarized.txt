00:00:00.520 - 00:00:31.766, Speaker A: Welcome to the Stargate Finance community call, where we discuss proposals and ideas that will help shape and govern the Stargate protocol. Feel free to join the conversation on stage anytime you have a question by clicking on the raise hand button at the bottom of the screen. You can also chime in through the voice text channel in discord or any of the chats listening live through YouTube or Twitch as all these channels aggregate together and all the messages. So just a reminder, this is not financial, accounting, or legal advice. Please do your own research. All right. What a crazy past couple of weeks here.
00:00:31.766 - 00:01:15.414, Speaker A: Hope everybody's been doing okay through this. Yeah, lots of, lots of things on the go here. More things coming through light crypto Twitter has been an amazing news resource. Yeah, it was just like nonstop here for all the things coming through. So hopefully everybody was able to kind of keep up and hopefully it wasn't affected too much. But yeah, really want to just get down to what's going on here with Stargate because there's a, a lot of really great stuff happening within the protocol and a lot of great stuff that's coming ahead, too. So of course, we did have some snapshots that were up.
00:01:15.414 - 00:01:55.076, Speaker A: I want to apologize in advance here. We've kind of broke snapshot a little bit. We are making because we have seven different networks that we're calling from right now. So we are adding extra calls to snapshot for this when we actually are calling the RPC's. So yeah, we kind of, there's problems with the, the public rpcs at times, so looking at ways to kind of fix that. So do want to apologize to anybody that is out there trying to vote and if it's, you know, I says, oh, we're unable to, unable to. What is it they say that your voting power, they're unable to like calculate your voting power? Just come back, check again.
00:01:55.076 - 00:02:25.948, Speaker A: We're going to stay on top of it and then hopefully snapshot can fix it, you know, so that it works for everybody to get, to get out there and vote in time. But yeah, so sip number 18 and that one was up. And the yes, my pools, they were also up as well for voting. Both of those passed quite unanimously. We don't have, I didn't look this morning here, but I don't think the final results are in yet. I don't think they've actually queried those. Once they do, we'll get a tally up for everyone.
00:02:25.948 - 00:02:51.700, Speaker A: I know it's a lot of people like those banners that just kind of show where everything was at but, yeah, basically those, you know, the ve staking dashboard, kind of getting that final breakdown of how the rewards and everything is, how this. Right. The distribution plan is going to work. So that's in the works is happening. Yeah. We'll be. We'll have more info on that, I guess, as things kind of unveil.
00:02:51.700 - 00:03:02.568, Speaker A: And then. Yeah, my pools. Yeah. Again, that was just the. Yeah. Having like an autonomous pool deployment from my. They were on here with us.
00:03:02.568 - 00:03:27.900, Speaker A: Was it last week, your last call, or the one before? Losing track of time here in crypto. But, yeah. So, like, they're going to put up a million my. Into each of the pools on six different networks and they'll be available to transfer betwixt in between. Yeah, between those pools. So, yeah, then as far as. Yeah, with the.
00:03:27.900 - 00:03:41.264, Speaker A: With SiP number 16, the. The new assets that were. Were to be added in as well. Similar to the. My part, but a little bit different here. So. Diffracts SUSD and LUSD.
00:03:41.264 - 00:04:01.194, Speaker A: So, yeah, those pools are up on. They are live and farms are to be ready later today, it sounds like. So, yeah, those pools can. Yeah, things are. Things are ready to go there. Primo, any further on that.
00:04:04.134 - 00:04:33.240, Speaker B: On the pools? Yeah. So pools are up now for all of those. For all of those assets, which means you can deposit. The farm is not up on the UI right now, so you'll need to stake the LP token into the farm in order to get emissions. You can actually do this through the contract right now, but it'll go up on the front end shortly, hopefully within the next hour or a couple of hours. Definitely by end of day. And then, you know, there should be a tweet as soon as that's live for everybody to do.
00:04:33.240 - 00:04:34.884, Speaker B: So that will be ASAP.
00:04:35.424 - 00:04:57.612, Speaker A: Perfect. Yep. We're looking forward to having that out for everyone and, yeah, please just stay tuned here. We'll. As soon as that's live on the front end, we'll make sure that that's pushed out across Twitter and discord and telegram. So if you are, we'll keep you all posted on that. Should be good to go here, like supremo said here in the next little bit.
00:04:57.612 - 00:05:13.904, Speaker A: So. Yeah, then, yeah. The other. Other thing to bring up here, too was another integration with Magpie. Primo, are you able to kind of break down a little bit more about Magpie and what's kind of the integration that's set up there?
00:05:17.344 - 00:05:41.432, Speaker B: Yeah. On the Magpie side got announced last week. I think the big thing is just that it's pretty awesome to see more applications. Especially applications. Obviously, Stargate's main goal was around liquidity aggregation. It's making basically liquid transfer seamless and easy. And I think it's everything that we want to see more and more liquidity intensive applications using us.
00:05:41.432 - 00:06:08.364, Speaker B: And that can be for a bunch of different things. It can be for like mid transfer when you talk sushiswap. Right. It needs it as like one leg of the trade. It can be like fronting liquidity or tapping into instant, guaranteed finality. There's a bunch of cool things that can happen there. But basically Stargate is starting to look like, I think, what we all thought that it would in being the liquidity backstop of most major applications around defi that are doing anything across chain.
00:06:08.364 - 00:06:10.640, Speaker B: I think that's super, super, super cool.
00:06:10.772 - 00:06:37.324, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. No, that's wonderful to see more and more integrations. Yeah, that's, that's wicked. So more and more to come, I'm sure, and looking forward to more of that, but, yeah, and even just like off of all that here, just like with. Yeah, kind of looking at like profit versus emissions. Yeah, we're starting to see some pretty interesting numbers there, too. Even like transactions and whatnot, all popping off.
00:06:37.324 - 00:06:56.054, Speaker A: More and more stuff coming along here. So. Yeah, yeah. I don't know, primal any further on that, just with the missions and profit.
00:06:57.074 - 00:07:45.202, Speaker B: I think the big thing is that, like, for the first time, I believe in protocol history, I think. And it might have, might have happened another time, but I don't think so. Emissions were high early on, but for the first time, for the majority of days this week, not every day, but the majority of days, Stargate had made more money and fees than it gave out in emissions. So the protocol itself was net profitable, which is something usually many, many, many of the largest protocols today still are not profitable. They're still entirely reliant on emissions. Um, and so, like, that is a huge, huge, huge step forward and something that hopefully there will be much, much more of in the future. I'm going to let, uh, Max talk a little bit more about that when he, uh, he gets up.
00:07:45.202 - 00:07:49.570, Speaker B: Um, but, yeah, it's, uh, really, really encouraging to see.
00:07:49.762 - 00:08:36.254, Speaker A: Yeah, wicked, wicked. So, um, yeah, really great stuff here, like we say here, a lot of stuff coming across with Stargate and, uh, yeah, revenue and profitability and integrations. Lots of. Lots of good stuff happening here. But yeah, as we move on here to other proposals that are up, there's one up for another APD with popcorn. So that's another one that's up and available. And like, really with any of these apds, like, any asset that's, or, you know, any project, any protocol, anybody that's interested in wanting to bring, you know, bring liquidity and to have it going, you know, omnichain in a sense, like, yeah, like, more and more of these requests, the better.
00:08:36.254 - 00:09:40.244, Speaker A: You know, I don't know if there's really too many negatives to, like, having more assets across Stargate. So, you know, something like this where, you know, popcorn comes in and wants to, wants to do this, it seems like a pretty reasonable thing, especially if they're going to be, you know, they're looking to go on Ethereum, polygon and optimism, putting a million of each, and then we'll, you know, add liquidity as response, you know, for, for each of the pools and the demand that they have. So, yeah, if we see more apds or if there's other projects that are looking to do this, you know, send them this way, get them to, you know, know that, like, Stargate is the place to do this. Yeah, again with, with this one. I don't know if there's, yeah. Any reason to not go forward with something like this and, yeah, more liquidity that can go across Stargate, the better. Not see any comments on that from in the AMA text questions here.
00:09:40.244 - 00:09:55.604, Speaker A: Now, it's all good, but, yeah, I don't know. I think, like, we've talked about this a number of times here before. He primo with, with all that. Yeah, just more the better.
00:09:56.984 - 00:10:50.716, Speaker B: Yeah, I think again, right. So obviously, early on for Stargate, the goal was like concentrated liquidity, right? It's like there's a reason why we didn't start with 20 assets, but we started with three. And the reason was that being the deepest source of liquidity and being able to facilitate all of this for every application matters. And I think it still matters. I think it makes a huge, huge, huge difference in how useful or usable Stargate is versus everything else. But that said, if you've been here for a while, like, long tail is super, super, super powerful, sushiswap basically was the shining example of this, of just like a huge amount of the volume where these long tab pools that weren't the ETH USDC pair, like, that's not what was getting traded most heavily, but it was every asset being added early. And you go back even prior to defi.
00:10:50.716 - 00:12:00.006, Speaker B: Bitfinex, sorry, Bittrex and Poloniex, like, made their claim in 2014 era onwards of exactly this, they would just be the fastest to add every new asset and they would accrue a huge amount of volume. And so, like, long tail is incredibly powerful in general, I think it unlocks a lot for teams. We've always wanted to do that, but it's like, how do you do it in a way that is economically viable? How do you do it in a way that the protocol isn't basically just hemorrhaging emissions? To do this, you have to make something that's beneficial for both the protocol and for the team itself. They want something that Stargate enables. And so I think that itself has been super, super cool, is that now through the apds, you make it so protocols can take a tiny part of their treasury and basically unlock this accessibility across all chains in a way that makes total sense for them and makes total sense for the protocol. So I think in an ideal world, yeah, every, you know, every project who's on multiple chains should be doing this. Uh, every single one of them has, again, this is tiny, tiny, tiny portions of treasury, and you just have native unlock.
00:12:00.006 - 00:12:36.862, Speaker B: You're not reliant on external bridges. You're not reliant on having your assets wrapped or having people introduce kind of crazy fees after the fact and making it so you, you can't unwind. There's all these different things that have made moving across chains as a project really messy historically. And obviously, layer zero helps with that, but Stargate specifically can make that very, very, very easy for a lot of projects. And I think the goal is basically just, just to get everybody to do this. So I would encourage all projects basically to do that, and everybody who has a project that should do it to kind of prod them to it, because I think it's super net beneficial on both sides.
00:12:36.958 - 00:12:45.038, Speaker A: Absolutely. Absolutely. Well said. Well said. Yeah. Okay. Well, with, with that, yes.
00:12:45.038 - 00:13:00.276, Speaker A: There's lots of stuff going on here with. Across the whole ecosystem. I think we'd like to introduce a new member here. Yeah, I'd like to introduce Max power, Primo, if you want to take that away as well.
00:13:00.380 - 00:13:24.824, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's here with me, so he'll be coming through my voice thing. I will just give the preface. Obviously, you guys probably saw the tweet or heard me talk about it last week. Max has come on to layers or labs to basically lead special projects. He's going to be working super, super closely with everything, but definitely with a bunch of the stuff that's happening within Stargate.
00:13:24.824 - 00:14:05.740, Speaker B: I think if you guys saw me talk last week, this is somebody who is obsessive about a lot of this stuff. More obsessive, maybe, than anybody that I know is incredibly qualified, basically, to be able to think about the structure of what this might look like, how people actually interact with it from all angles. So super, super excited to have, I think once you guys hear him talk about kind of his vision of what can be done for Stargate or what that might look like, you'll be as excited as I am. And with that, I'll let him take it away.
00:14:05.892 - 00:14:06.468, Speaker A: Sure.
00:14:06.596 - 00:14:53.704, Speaker C: Thanks, Primo, and happy to be here and excited to be here. I've been a community member like everybody else here since the launch of Stargate, but I'm deeply passionate about Defi. I don't think that DeFi works without a liquid transfer layer to enable assets to move between chains. And Stargate has the potential to be that building block for all of Defi. So here at layer zero labs, I run special projects here. I'm focused on supporting our entire ecosystem, and Stargate is part of that ecosystem. So I'm excited to bring forward ideas, research, and things to help push us forward as a community that you guys can interact with and vote on and give feedback on.
00:14:53.704 - 00:15:58.540, Speaker C: I've always viewed Stargate as sort of primo talked about as this composable building block for Defi. It's a wonderful bridge right now, and it is the most used bridge by a number of users. We are one of the most used bridges by actual volume transfer through the bridge, which is incredibly exciting, and we are the deepest bridge in Defi. But where Stargate really starts to unlock its potential is when other people build on top of Stargate. So, magpies a great example of this. And there are a couple other projects that are going to be releasing that they're building on top of Stargate in the coming days and weeks, and I think a lot more people will start doing it because of the fact that we can offer instant, guaranteed finality. So we're one of the only places where you can say, I know exactly what I'm going to get when I move it through the bridge, which allows a different type of execution for projects, and it creates a tremendous amount of volume and fees, or Stargate itself, when value is moved behind the scenes, meaning you don't actually need to go to our UI and bridge it.
00:15:58.540 - 00:17:16.146, Speaker C: A protocol can utilize Stargate's liquidity to move users between vault products, to allow users to deposit to the protocol from different chains, or to just allow users to withdraw to any chain. So there are a number of different very upfront use cases, and then there are a number of theoretical use cases that we're really excited to bring out research around and have people build on top of. But the other thing with Stargate that's super exciting is that we have the chance to become a profitable protocol within Defi, and that would mean a reduction of emissions, increased volume, and increased fees, which come twofold. One is that PoL continues to grow, which, as we have more and more pol. There's less need for emissions for the protocol, as the protocol has self sustaining liquidity itself. And that also means that there are, you know, new tangible benefits for projects wanting to build on top of Stargate. So that's incredibly exciting, I think, and I hope that Stargate will be expanding to new chains, supporting new assets, and we'll see many more apds come forward.
00:17:16.146 - 00:18:09.680, Speaker C: We'll see other people sort of flock and realize that Stargate has unparalleled security. We've never lost a single dollar that's been put into Stargate. We have one of the most robust audit processes within the industry. And in a time where, you know, to address the elf into the room where trust in crypto is close to an all time low, Defi shines brighter than ever as a trusted place to actually interact with crypto. And Stargate is the actual route that can empower all of Defi. I'm incredibly excited to be on that journey with everybody here and to talk about, I mean, frankly, I can talk about Stargate and value transfer and bridging all day long, and I'd be happy to, but I don't think you guys want to sit on a call for 12 hours. So happy to answer any questions as well there.
00:18:09.792 - 00:18:41.864, Speaker A: Yeah, well said there, Max. Yeah. I really appreciate your, your thoroughness with everything, and, yeah, just how much you're. You're really seeing the vision of not only layer zero and all the projects around it, but also, you know, with Stargate here in particular, and just, like, how powerful it can be. You've pointed out some really great stuff here as well today. So, yeah, if anybody has questions for Max, feel free to put into the questions there, or do see a few. There was a few hands up earlier.
00:18:41.864 - 00:19:15.420, Speaker A: I'm not sure if those are just, they're kind of coming and going, but, yeah, if somebody has a question, please. Happy to bring you up here. But overall, really pleased to hear everything that Max has had to say about this, and only going to be a net benefit for the whole protocol and the ecosystem as a whole. He's a very, very great, bright individual. So thank you very much, Max. All right. Yeah.
00:19:15.420 - 00:19:50.740, Speaker A: And now. Yeah, I guess, like, probably a great time now. I know we've seen a bunch of stuff here with the FTX, all the FTX News and a few things that's kind of come out on layer zero and Stargate side. Yeah, probably best primo, if you don't mind taking that away and just kind of. Sure. There's a bunch of questions and ideas here that the community have, and there was a few message or kind of questions that had come out as well afterwards. So I'll let you kind of take things away, and I'll see what gets filled in.
00:19:50.740 - 00:19:59.744, Speaker A: And if there's any outside outstanding questions from what they, um, you know, from that list, we can kind of go from there. But I think you're going to cover everything today anyhow.
00:20:01.924 - 00:20:30.704, Speaker B: Hey. Uh, yeah, I mean, happy to. So, obviously, like, with the state of the world right now, it's, it's like, there's only so much that I can talk about. There's, there's a bunch of stuff happening. I, I mean, you guys have been following the whole FTX saga, I think, you know, basically, uh, the memo that we put out is, is, you know, the source of truth for the moment of what we want to say. Obviously, the remaining factor was the 2.8 million Stargate that was inside of FTX.
00:20:30.704 - 00:21:14.718, Speaker B: I tried super hard to sort with them, how to do that. I was not able to get a response. I think if we can figure out something with the liquidators, it's still something maybe we'll potentially try to do or see if there's a way to do that. Um, but I think in general, you know. Yeah, in general, like, very happy in terms of, in terms of Stargate, where everything came out, I think ultimately, like, extremely strongly positioned. I think we've seen, I don't know. I've probably gotten 100 messages after the fact of how other projects or Portcos, you know, want to do something similar.
00:21:14.718 - 00:21:43.034, Speaker B: But, but it is, you know, there is this entire process around it, so there's, there's only so much I can say for right now. Obviously, when I can update everybody and everything, I'll continue to update everybody. I've tried to be maximally transparent around kind of everything around it, but, yeah, I mean, I'll field any questions, but around this topic specifically, where usually you guys can ask me literally whatever you want. Or on this topic specifically, I'll likely say quite a bit like, I can't talk about it right now. Yeah.
00:21:45.554 - 00:22:07.514, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. All right. Yeah. A lot of, like, you said the stuff that you'd come across, Twitter and everything. But, yeah, I think, like, some of these things you may probably unable to speak about too much here, especially. Yeah, there's one question here that's like, you know, talking about legal fallout and everything due to purchasing tokens, I think, you know, legal has been fairly involved with any of these, any of these things.
00:22:07.514 - 00:22:42.564, Speaker A: So, you know, obviously, any kind of legal move will be, you know, looked over and be evaluated before any kind of decisions are made. So I don't think there's any, you know, no legal, there won't be anything illegally or everything will be legally above board. I think is probably the best way to put that. Yeah. Then this other part here, I think these two might be kind of related here. The 45 million in token assets listed in the document for separate from the Alameda auction. If so, layer zero, repurchase from them, from FTX.
00:22:42.564 - 00:23:00.084, Speaker A: I don't know if that makes a whole lot of sense here, but. Yeah, because I think there's the 45 million listed as, like, a creditor. Yeah, I guess, like, why are we listed as a creditor for that 45 million? Just. Yeah, if you can kind of shed some light on that, I think it's around 45.
00:23:00.124 - 00:23:37.148, Speaker B: As with most things around this process, there's just like, stuff until. Until the sort of majority of the processes is complete or we've gone through with kind of the liquidators and in the entire process now, like, just can't talk about it. But that said, obviously, if you look on anything related to that list, it's layer zero labs, it's not Stargate. Right. So Stargate Dao has never had any funds on any centralized exchange. Basically it has its trade. I think last check of the Pol is something like 80 million.
00:23:37.148 - 00:24:03.114, Speaker B: I don't remember. Max will know the exact number, but I don't remember the exact number. But it's been fluctuating with everything else. But it has its own $80 million pol in the treasury has never had any funds on centralized exchange. All funds from any centralized exchange were user deposits, basically to trade there. So on that, it's totally separate from anything Stargate related. Yeah, basically.
00:24:03.194 - 00:24:42.152, Speaker C: That said, yeah, Stargate Pol fluctuates between 60 and $75 million of pol. At current measurement. The fluctuation is because Stargate itself has a majority of Stargate and USDLP. So depending on the price of Stargate, the combination of USD and SDG in there is different. When we measure and try to measure Pol to share, we take out all of the STG and just measure the pure USD equivalent value within our pol. But we're really excited to announce, you know, transparency is really, really important for. For the Stargate community.
00:24:42.152 - 00:25:03.614, Speaker C: So we have been working with Nansen to produce a transparency dashboard that will hopefully be rolling out shortly where anybody can see the Stargate Pol, where it sits on chain and can verify everything that we're saying as well. Because in a post FTX world, more than ever, transparency for projects and treasures is more important.
00:25:04.354 - 00:25:18.546, Speaker A: Yeah. Well said. Well said. Cool. Yeah. I don't know if anybody has further questions. Yeah, well, there's one here.
00:25:18.546 - 00:25:40.086, Speaker A: I believe the question was in relation to the Astro. Okay, I'll have to look. There's a tweet there that's linked. Yeah. 45 million worth of STG. I'd have to look into that afterwards. I don't know if I have.
00:25:40.086 - 00:26:06.214, Speaker A: I can't click on that right now. Yeah, I'm not sure on that one. I'll have to look into that and get back to you guys unless if, however. Yeah, how reliable. I didn't bounce around on Twitter. I'll have to take a look at that or get Primo to look at it as well. Max can take a peek and maybe follow up with you guys on that further, but, yeah.
00:26:06.214 - 00:26:29.096, Speaker A: All right. Anything else from the community? Any other questions? I see a couple. There was hands before. Anybody want to. Anybody have anything further? All right.
00:26:29.240 - 00:26:40.464, Speaker B: Hey, guys. Yeah. Tangled before. There's a couple other things, so. All right. Again, if any more questions pop up, happy to do it. I think the other things that I want to run through are all right.
00:26:40.464 - 00:26:52.298, Speaker B: So new assets being added. Amazing. New apds going up. Amazing. So all of that is great. That's strictly more net revenue for the protocol. I think.
00:26:52.298 - 00:27:22.122, Speaker B: Obviously, everybody has seen Pol drop basically with all of the insanity. Or not pol. Sorry. TVL drop with all of the insanity. So TVL is unwound from, like 480 to 500 million down to about 270 million to 90 million right now. Um, and so, uh, that puts some strain on some of the pathways, uh, where there are, you know, fees have been relatively high. People have been.
00:27:22.122 - 00:27:41.650, Speaker B: Have been rebalancing them. Uh, but they're still, like, arbitrum has a bunch of excess. There's a bunch of things that have happened that basically make it less clean and functional as. As you, uh, than usual. Um, so I want to. I want to talk about them before. I think, uh, I've been told from others that.
00:27:41.650 - 00:28:05.954, Speaker B: That people. So people have been designing a system around this, and I've been told I was going to go up pre this call. It seems like it's, you know, everybody's still finalizing kind of what that might look like. But basically, there's. There's going to be proposals that go up, and I think it's important to talk about prior to them going up, like on, on call. So there's questions for the foundation itself, basically, to run. And we at all, we've talked about this many, many times.
00:28:05.954 - 00:28:19.980, Speaker B: Right. There's. There's EQ fees right now in the system. I don't know the exact number, but, you know, earlier this week, there's about $180,000 of EQ fee. Purpose of the EQ fee is to incentivize. Sorry, EQ reward, I should say. So.
00:28:19.980 - 00:29:09.096, Speaker B: EQ fee is charged when you go in one way, or you have two pools, and you go from chain a to chain b, and there's a bunch of flow in that way. Now, chain b gets drained, and chain a has way too much money in it, right? And so people, once you get past a certain threshold, start to pay a little bit more to go from a to b and then a little bit more. And all of that excess sits in a pool, a rewards pool. And so when somebody wants to go b to a and rebalance that and kind of set it back to equilibrium, they get paid that EQ reward. So again, there's 100, $180,000 sitting in those. At least that was the number earlier. Some people have been rebalancing this, so I don't know what that looks like at the exact moment, but the proposal is, I believe, something like the Stargate foundation is going to run.
00:29:09.096 - 00:29:37.864, Speaker B: Gonna be whitelisted to basically, right now, there's a six bit base fee, right? So every transaction takes six bps. So you can't rebalance. There's no incentive to rebalance unless you. Unless the amount in the EQ reward is greater than six bits on the total amount that you're rebalancing. Right. So it usually waits until maybe, you know, market makers might want to see ten to 15 bits. You know, they want to make at least five, five to ten bits for doing this.
00:29:37.864 - 00:30:05.770, Speaker B: Right. And so that in itself means that pools can get in a reasonable state of imbalance, which kind of just sucks for the protocol. It makes fees more expensive for everybody. It makes pathways a little bit less usable, less volume overall going through the protocol, because, like, there's better prices being elsewhere. And at the end of the day, the volume, the six bips, goes back to the protocol. So the protocol is the one who captures four and a half of those six bps in most cases. So it makes 4.5
00:30:05.770 - 00:30:36.818, Speaker B: bps. Now, I believe what's being proposed is that the Stargate foundation will basically be whitelisted where they don't pay six bps when balancing. So when sending transactions in a positive direction, in the good direction. But all of the EQ fee that they cap, IeQ reward that they capture basically belongs to the protocol. Right. So the protocol will take out of its treasury some amount of money, like X dollars. I don't know what the X is.
00:30:36.818 - 00:31:33.154, Speaker B: And then the Stargate foundation will basically run a bot, more or less, and a semi automated and eventually fully automated service that uses everything basically to rebalance it. So the net goal of that is capture. Keep the pools as balanced as humanly possible so that the protocol functions, gets all volume driven to it. Basically has max volume and usability, capture as much EQ reward as it can. Obviously, everything that it does should be, ideally, net gain to the underlying pol. So this is a world where there have been months where I think there are half a million dollars, maybe a million dollars of EQ reward that could be captured and owned by the protocol that right now are going to external market makers or arbitrageurs. And there's no reason why the protocol shouldn't be capturing that itself.
00:31:33.154 - 00:32:20.062, Speaker B: And then, basically, the caveat is that it can basically use anything. So it might use centralized exchanges, it might use native bridges from chains. It will basically just continuously move the flow around to keep Stargate maximally balanced and capture the most Pol possible. So, again, happy to talk about what that might look like. Again, I think it's still, like, being designed. It's certainly not up yet, but people have been telling me for a while that they think this should be done and this will go up. So when that goes up, happy to discuss it, but happy to discuss, like, theoretically now, what that might look like.
00:32:20.062 - 00:33:00.994, Speaker B: I think for me, like, obviously, the end goal of Stargate is grow Pol as high as humanly possible. Right? Like, the goal is get, let's say, 500 million was original, or I actually think that can be a lot less. Now, I've been convinced that 500 million in the current state, the world is, we don't even need that much. So let's say 300 million, and then you basically pay zero emissions, like, Stargate was already profitable this week with paying out emissions. So once you go to zero emissions, like, every week is profitable, which is amazing. And again, the majority of the week, not the week, I think it might be net down on the total week, but like four out of seven days or something. It was profitable.
00:33:00.994 - 00:33:44.422, Speaker B: Yeah. So anyways, that's the other thing that I think we'll see hit Commonwealth. I think there's a bunch of other proposals going up to come wealth this week that people, everybody's been throwing around ideas in discord and in a bunch of the other chats of just, like, things that should happen. People have idea, have ideas on what should happen to the Stargate from the Alameda side, people have had ideas around what should happen, like, when imbalances happen. So I think we'll see a lot of activity this week. Everybody should obviously pay attention in the forums, comment in the forums, have just sort of as open discussion as possible around all of these things, and then make sure you vote in a snapshot, go up. I think that's pretty much it for me.
00:33:44.422 - 00:34:24.270, Speaker B: I think this, despite the world crumbling externally and it being really, really miserable in general for a lot of things, I think Defi, like centralized exchanges and lending desks and all these other things that seem to be imploding, have driven a lot of volume to Defi, which I think is like, the rose colored view of it. Like, Stargate volumes were peaking basically all week, uh, which was, which was awesome to see. And I think all of Defi, if you look at stuff like, you know, GMX or DyDX, like, obviously people are moving to doing more things on chain, which is way more opportunity for Stargate. Um, so I think it's, uh, it's pretty. Max wants to say something, so I'll let you.
00:34:24.342 - 00:35:20.106, Speaker C: I think. I think what, what Primo was pointed out was pretty exciting. When you can balance a system more efficiently, it means you need less money in the system to actually, um, run, which means, hypothetically, you need to pay less to retain that TVL. As Primo said, TVL dropped from about 490 million to 290 million, and Stargate still functioning well. And if you can have a higher amount of liquidity turnover, theoretically within a system, you have two things that happen. One, you have a natural APR, that sort of happens from the liquidity being turned over and a natural amount of fees, and you have a more efficient system that can work better. So I think when you theoretically look at a rebalancing effort, if one was to be brought forwards, it would result in a much more efficient Stargate, where there's the ability for significantly more volume to flow through it.
00:35:20.106 - 00:35:58.198, Speaker C: And as Primo said here, when you look at the space in general this past week, we've seen Defi volume, Defi revenue go up. Stargate is included in that. And to point out we are on pace for Stargate to actually exceed last month. We had the second highest month of volume ever. Stargate is currently on pace to exceed that this month and hopefully do the most volume it's ever done within a month. And that's incredibly exciting. Combined with organic growth of natural transactions and everything else that's happening.
00:35:58.198 - 00:36:10.554, Speaker C: So I think looking at, I know a bunch of our community has been working on stuff, looking at stuff, coming forward. As Primo said, engaging with it and all of us building a better start together is super exciting.
00:36:11.134 - 00:36:11.518, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:11.566 - 00:36:32.880, Speaker B: So I just got a ping that farms for the assets that have been added should be live in roughly 30 minutes. So I think tweet should go out around then. But just keep an eye on the UI if you're not doing it directly to the contract. So if you are staking any of those assets, make sure you add your lp to the farm and get a mission. Yep.
00:36:33.032 - 00:36:51.760, Speaker A: Awesome. Wonderful to hear. Wonderful to hear. Yeah. And looking at, like, transactions and volume and everything here, just looking at the charts now, and, like, transactions from this month are already matched to October. We're like, you know, just less than 1000 away from less thousand transactions. So that'll likely happen today or even tomorrow is my guess.
00:36:51.760 - 00:37:15.684, Speaker A: And, yeah, November for actual volume here already at 475 million. Yeah. October being 704. Yeah, there's a really good trend happening here and yeah. Really pleased to see, and even the people that are here, we're seeing like a higher audience here in our calls. So that's beautiful across both Twitter and.
00:37:15.724 - 00:37:36.204, Speaker B: Discord, forgetting to announce it today on Twitter. So there was no pre announcement. And, you know, I think we likely, given we're at 476 right now just in discord alone. And last week we were at 800 plus. I think if we had had the Twitter up in the announcement, we'd be possibly, possibly all time highs here on the community side. So super, super awesome to see.
00:37:36.704 - 00:37:51.784, Speaker A: Yeah. Yep, yep, yep, yep. All right. Anything further from community side or anything obligatory? Oh, yes. When Solana? Yeah, not sure where we're at on that. Primo.
00:37:52.084 - 00:38:11.828, Speaker B: Yes, it's a good question. Again, Solana is on Devnet right now. That's for layer zero side. Solana for Stargate will require a full rewrite of. Full rewrite of Stargate in Solana's rust version, which is no small lift. It's a pretty big task. I think it would be amazing to have it there.
00:38:11.828 - 00:38:31.380, Speaker B: But the crazy thing is, I don't know, man. Solana community is incredible. Solana dev community is incredible. Solana Defi has been in kind of rough shape. Like, Stargate itself had more TVL recently than all of Solana Defi together, or like, very, very similar. Right. Like the whole ecosystem.
00:38:31.380 - 00:39:19.580, Speaker B: Right. So I do think for that ecosystem, if it comes back and defi sort of becomes thriving there, absolutely Stargate should go there. I think there's a bunch of other chains that sort of are petitioning to have Stargate go as well. So Stargate will be expanding to more chains. And obviously, having native asset support in Solana rather than the existing wrapped assets is super important. I think. I would love, love, love to see it, but it is a very big technical lift, and I think that has to be weighed against going to lower hanging EVM chains that are just like, you can go there immediately doing other things in the fee library and everything else that needs to be built out that will make Stargate better and more efficient overall in the area that it's already crushing.
00:39:19.580 - 00:39:38.620, Speaker B: It's sort of like, optimize at home first, continue to expand. So it will very likely happen. But I think the last month or so of Solana, Solana Defi has moved it down the priority list a little bit in terms of what everything looks like overall.
00:39:38.772 - 00:40:11.496, Speaker C: We as a community, need to decide what we feel is important. So, you know, there have been a number of other, you know, chains that have approached and wanted Stargate to deploy there that will hopefully be bring forward proposals for everybody to look at about what they would offer for Stargate to be there or why Stargate should be there. And it's really up to us as a community to say, this is why we feel it's important, this is what we should do, and to understand and weigh, you know, the cost of doing that versus other things.
00:40:11.640 - 00:40:12.604, Speaker B: 100%.
00:40:15.184 - 00:40:36.424, Speaker A: Right. Wicked. Okay, everybody. Yeah, hopefully we've been able to answer a lot. Here is 40 minutes in, so, yeah, there was a lot of stuff to cover today. Again, very positive stuff that's coming out here from the Stargate side, and even defi, too. Like, I'm glad, glad we touched on that today, too.
00:40:36.424 - 00:40:52.834, Speaker A: Like, having custody of your assets and making sure that if you want to do these sorts of things, participating in defi ecosystems, that you can actually retain your assets. You can see what you're getting into. I don't know, this all just made sense to me a long time. Or, go ahead.
00:40:53.814 - 00:41:01.806, Speaker B: By the way, there are two requests to speak in discord. So I'm just going to invite them to speak real quick and see if they still have questions, and then otherwise we can wrap it up.
00:41:01.990 - 00:41:12.626, Speaker A: Sure. I see cabry. And where's the other one?
00:41:12.770 - 00:41:29.938, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, he jumped off, apparently. No question anymore. Cabry, if you have a question, feel free to ask it. Nope, also canceled. So. All right.
00:41:29.938 - 00:41:30.854, Speaker B: Sweet.
00:41:31.354 - 00:41:48.650, Speaker A: Okay, wonderful. Yeah. And again, I just see. Will you add Moonbeam again? Yeah, that's. Yeah, the moonbeam on layer zero. Of course there's. Where's that? The endpoints have to be there first, and then before come to Stargate.
00:41:48.802 - 00:42:34.228, Speaker B: Moonbeam is live with layer zero, but Moonbeam doesn't have native assets right now. So the real question is, like, what will that actually look like? Are we willing to tie. I think they had nomad USDC there before. Are we willing to tie nomad USDC to real native USDC on Stargate? I would say the answer is probably no right now, but that doesn't mean there's no way to do this. I think there are ways that Stargate can interact with these ecosystems, and I think that's a lot of chains have been reaching out, wanting Stargate to go there and talking about what this might look like. Everybody's been pushed for them to kind of make proposals in the forums and talk about what this might look like or what that relationship was. And I think there's been some really cool ideas.
00:42:34.228 - 00:42:52.424, Speaker B: So I hope in the next week or so, maybe two weeks, we'll see at least one or two of those surface, and so we'll see if that happens or not. But if not, in the nearest future, I think the earliest expansions of Stargate will start to be explored, which is. Cool.
00:42:53.744 - 00:43:14.404, Speaker A: Cool, cool. All right, everyone, well, let's wrap it up there for the day. If you've been here for a while, you'll be able to go claim your Po app. So you'll head over to claim Po app. I'll send that poap claim channel in Discord. I'll send the embed link here right away. You can click on that and just enter in your.
00:43:14.404 - 00:43:44.894, Speaker A: If you have to, just be connected to guild and that way it'll register you. And you can just enter in your ens or your ETH address and you'll be able to claim that. So I'll send that out here in a second. And for everybody, if you're wanting to follow up on this or. Thanks, everybody that has been checking in or has been watching in from YouTube or Twitch, and this will be available on YouTube afterwards. If you want to check it out again later on, so thank you, everybody, and we'll chat with you later. Bye.
