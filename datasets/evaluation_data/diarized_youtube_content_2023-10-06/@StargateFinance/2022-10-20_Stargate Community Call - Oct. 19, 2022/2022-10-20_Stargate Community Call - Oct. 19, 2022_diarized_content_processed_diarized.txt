00:00:00.120 - 00:00:31.922, Speaker A: Stargate Finance community call where we discuss proposals and ideas that will help shape and govern the Stargate protocol. Feel free to join the conversation on stage anytime you have a question by asking, clicking raise your hand button at the bottom of the screen. You can also chime in through the voice text channel in discord or any of the chats for those listening in on YouTube and twitch as those channels all aggregate the messages together. Just a reminder, this is not financial, accounting or legal advice. Please do your own research. All right. Hello, Stargate.
00:00:31.922 - 00:01:03.464, Speaker A: We've. Yeah, we had a. Yeah, lots going on here in the past couple of weeks. Yeah, it was at Devcon last week. Layer Zero Labs team was there and yeah, really, really great. Incredible feedback and engagement from, from a lot of folks, you know, mind share around bridging and whatnot. Protocols interested in Stargate and just like, you know, kind of understanding and like under unlocking a lot more ideas around it.
00:01:03.464 - 00:01:31.176, Speaker A: So, yeah, really, really great stuff. I don't know if anybody had a chance to see the, even like the layer zero swag looked pretty sick as well. So lots of people very, very pleased with it. But yeah, yeah. Hoping to hear more and more. There's been some protocols that have reached out afterwards and doing some follow up. So, yeah, hoping to see a little more, a little more mind share around Stargate as well.
00:01:31.240 - 00:01:31.844, Speaker B: So.
00:01:32.744 - 00:02:12.288, Speaker C: And then, can I just say, I think layer zero swag was among, I guess, the most prized ones from what I've seen. People were rocking it and proud of it. I was so happy to see it. I mean, we didn't have like a secret, have a truck or anything like this, but I do think the team now see the potential in Defcon and next year we're going to have a boot, next year we're going to have some experiences and so on. A lot of the devs actually coming by for layer zero were, was their first time at any of these crypto conferences. So I think they were all happy. They saw like a lot of technical talks and we're going to make sure we're even more present next year.
00:02:12.466 - 00:02:25.264, Speaker A: Yeah, wicked. Wicked. So, yeah, I don't know, Primo, anything to add there with, with Devcon and any ideas that you see or anything that you've seen or. Yeah, comments there?
00:02:26.404 - 00:02:54.664, Speaker B: Oh, I mean, I think from my end, Defcon was like pretty amazing. I think just a group of people and skewed it was towards builders was like pretty insane. Yeah, I don't know, amazing group. I think the general interest was, was great. I think like Maki said it was pretty awesome to see everybody just rocking the swag in general. But like, on a broad scale, I think it's one of the best conferences I've ever been to. So that's saying something.
00:02:54.824 - 00:03:07.110, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I agree. Like, it was. I mean, I've only been to a couple now since this. But like, that venue was incredible. Layout was great. You know, logistics was awesome with it. So for the people that were not.
00:03:07.142 - 00:03:35.660, Speaker C: There, like, just to give you kind of an idea of the proportion, there was five different floors with literally like five, 6000 people. They even had like a basement, an acre basement. That was insane. And they turned into, they turned basically like a car parking into like this massive venue with NFT art, beanbags, table to act and so on. The only issue, I think, and everyone can agree was the connectivity maybe in Bogota was not super good.
00:03:35.772 - 00:03:36.604, Speaker A: Yeah, Internet.
00:03:36.684 - 00:03:47.704, Speaker C: Internet was bad. But to be honest, like, definitely one for the archives, one for the hale of fame and so on. Primo, what was your favorite part yourself about Bogota per se?
00:03:49.124 - 00:04:18.324, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I was kind of joking with people earlier in saying it's the first conference I've been to where I don't think I spoke to a single vc. Right. All builders. I think, like the collection of people was by far the best part of it. I think food in Columbia was amazing. I think the Heath foundation did like an insane job with the venue. And just with like selecting sort of how tickets are allocated or who's going and who's speaking, I think, yeah, I think more than anything.
00:04:18.324 - 00:04:40.266, Speaker B: Right. Normally when I go to these things, it's kind of end to end meetings constantly, nonstop. And I think there's a first time where we get to just like, sit and listen to, like, what people are building and how they interact with everything and like, talk. The devs who are interested in building on top of Stargate and utilizing it, building on layer zero, just like all of it. So I think that's by far the best part.
00:04:40.450 - 00:04:54.374, Speaker C: So next year we're in for, I think it's going to be Istanbul in Turkey or maybe Natrang in Vietnam. So if anyone from the community wants to, our developers and so on, wants to attend, we're going to be there 100%.
00:04:55.954 - 00:05:14.404, Speaker A: Very good. Wicked. Looking forward to seeing you all there. Cool. Yeah. So lots of great stuff from DefcoN and. Yeah, moving into volume and whatnot here as well over first couple of weeks of, I guess, since our last community call.
00:05:14.404 - 00:05:37.016, Speaker A: Yeah, we've had like, October has been a really powerful month as well. Seeing a lot of transactions and even volume. Yes. Second highest in transactions. We still have like what have we got here? Another like eleven days of the month left. Twelve days I guess. And we're almost like three quarter over three quarters of like what September was in.
00:05:37.016 - 00:06:08.544, Speaker A: September was the highest month as well. So lots of transactions happening there. Even volume wise. I think we're second or third for, you know, October itself is already a second or third for, you know, monthly volume. Obviously we had some, some interesting stuff happen recently that's helped contribute to that. But I mean that's, yeah, the protocols there to be able to facilitate those kind of transactions. So that's pretty cool that we're seeing that kind of volume and.
00:06:08.544 - 00:06:42.682, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, great stuff there. As far as integrations go, one of the notable ones here lately is Rengo exchange. So they are a multi chain Dex bridge aggregator. So they're doing aggregating through a Dex and then aggregating through bridge. And so that a lot of this stuff is routing through Stargate just because it's thinking it's because he had with sushi X swap and be able to do it there. Yeah. And just like the aggregation that we've got going on will work or not aggregation, but the bridging that we can do, you know, works well for them.
00:06:42.682 - 00:07:21.094, Speaker A: So that was pretty cool to see, you know, more and more people building on top composing stargate kind of, you know, really, really working to make this happen. Yeah. And then everyone's always asking about the staking dashboard that is still planning here for November. Yeah. Just want to get that out to everybody and know everyone's very, yeah, very excited about that. So that's, that is coming and is on the, on the road map. Anything on bribes? Where are we at with bribes? Anything to add there? Maki?
00:07:21.514 - 00:08:21.446, Speaker C: We had a proposal from Bitoveinex to actually move some of the liquidity that was unutilized or non optimized on Univ tree over optimism. So that's pretty good where they're going to be moving it if the vote goes positive and at the same time we're going to be moving the Pol that is on Mainnet. Half of it will go to binancer with an increase in fees. And basically like I do think it's maybe at the moment to think about the curve pool going into a fracs bp so you know, Frax USDC to kind of make her bribes more efficient and you know, basically leverage their, their convex influence. So that's like, that's I guess like in the bucket list just by the way. Just a small side note, like just to move over to balancer, like with kind of the stable coins that we have. We, we will be like a core pool from the get go, which means we will be accruing free bribes per se and we will be making interest on top of it.
00:08:21.446 - 00:09:09.234, Speaker C: So even though that's like a very things like 100k in interest that we will be able to kind of get from the get go, it's very interesting for pretty much no change on our side. So that is happening next. And bribe wise, we haven't actually bribed anything for the past two cycles. I believe we wanted to see kind of how sustainable our current stake was and so on. There's also been some changes with YVCRV, so yearn has now deprecated it. We are now into the new YCRV era, which means we can choose between income staking or votes. We are going to do everything into votes for Stargate Dao.
00:09:09.234 - 00:09:48.352, Speaker C: So that means we will, we won't be impacted by anything else. What is interesting with this new design is there's actually now exit liquidity per se. So we are able to unstake and leave if we want to, which before was impossible. There was not enough liquidity and there were some, some issues. It was kind of a not, I wouldn't say a trap, but, you know, it's a one way lane now. We actually have optionality. We can leave if we are thinking, for example, of locking ourselves the CRv, that could be an option, but at the moment, I think keeping it autopilot just kind of.
00:09:48.352 - 00:10:08.654, Speaker C: With a minimal kind of influence. Just for reference, without any bribes, we're at now 2% fixed in crv, meaning we are earning 2% on the current pol without any other pipes, which is a very interesting income when we think about like this being into the eight digits.
00:10:09.034 - 00:10:26.418, Speaker A: Hmm. Crazy, crazy. Well, cool. No, thank you for the update on that. Yeah, lots of always stuff moving in that ecosystem and you know, as you were talking about the Beethoven proposal we did have. I thought solar curve was in here. I'm just trying to find them.
00:10:26.418 - 00:10:38.382, Speaker A: Solar curve. If you're in here, I would love to have you come up and chat with about that. I'm not finding in the audience right now, but see if you are put up your hand, we'll get you.
00:10:38.438 - 00:10:43.806, Speaker C: These calls are getting popular. Tangle not even able to find folks now. How much, how much people right now?
00:10:43.910 - 00:10:46.034, Speaker A: 400. 450. Wow.
00:10:46.334 - 00:10:47.502, Speaker C: Is this a record?
00:10:47.638 - 00:10:50.510, Speaker A: This is, uh, this might be, actually.
00:10:50.582 - 00:10:51.190, Speaker C: I think so.
00:10:51.262 - 00:10:58.914, Speaker A: I think so here. Anyway, uh, solarcrypt just messaged me here. Where are you?
00:11:01.014 - 00:11:04.526, Speaker C: Anyways, I can just maybe take in the mean.
00:11:04.590 - 00:11:06.998, Speaker A: Yeah, if you can just kind of speak on that some more.
00:11:07.086 - 00:11:32.756, Speaker C: What is interesting, per se is I was talking with the sushi team not long ago, and basically they have enabled bento box strategies for Stargate. So we might be able to see very soon a WBTC pool being kind of launched if we're able to push it via governance, mainly because that would be free liquidity kind of just standing on all these networks. Okay, that's pretty interesting.
00:11:32.860 - 00:11:38.264, Speaker A: Cool, cool. All right, well, we got solar curve up here now. Yeah, thanks for coming on today. Solar curve.
00:11:39.764 - 00:11:41.060, Speaker D: Yeah, thanks for having me.
00:11:41.132 - 00:11:50.704, Speaker A: Yeah, you bet. You bet. Thanks for putting up that proposal and maybe just to let the community know here who you are, what you're involved in, and then we can dive into that proposal a little bit.
00:11:52.964 - 00:12:31.644, Speaker D: So, hello from Balancer. I'm a longtime contributor at the balancer dow two and a half years or so, and I also advise Beethoven X work very closely with them on a day to day basis. So I had the initial idea to bring Beethoven X to optimism in a partnership with balancer. So that's how we have access to v ball voting on optimism. But the UI is run by Beethoven X and we have all these really interesting boosted pools. And that's part of what you guys would take advantage of with this proposal?
00:12:31.944 - 00:12:50.112, Speaker A: Yeah. So these boosted pools. Kind of walk us through that. I know it's a little bit abstract at times for people here, but like. Yeah, just like how the, how the pairs with, like, you've got BBRF, a USDC. What is that referring to? Or how does that actually kind of work in there? Because, like the. It's how.
00:12:50.112 - 00:12:58.524, Speaker A: It's like, beats reaper Ave boosted. You know, it gets a little bit long, but maybe just break that all down so people understand what, what's actually happening.
00:12:59.624 - 00:13:43.986, Speaker D: Yeah, we've just, due to some technical reasons, but it all works out for the best. We do have a bit of a complicated stack we're taking advantage of here. So the idea behind boosted pools is most of the liquidity in a pool is not going to be used for trading in most circumstances, so it's just sitting there earning nothing. We could take most of that deposit somewhere to earn a yield. Now, Aave on optimism is printing a bunch of op rewards. If we just directly deposit into Aave, like, collecting those rewards and then redistributing them presents a bit of a problem. So we take advantage of reaper, which is a yearn v one fork run by the byte masons, like really smart guys from Phantom.
00:13:43.986 - 00:14:08.994, Speaker D: It's a non upgradable single strategy vault. So it just farms aave on the lending side. It doesn't leverage up or anything. It just deposits on Aave, takes the op, sells it for more of the position on Aave. So, like, if the three pool, you know, that's what we're doing. We're just taking each dot, USDC, USDT, putting them in a reaper vault. That's just farming on Aave, farming away.
00:14:09.114 - 00:14:25.994, Speaker A: Okay. All right. Yeah. So for a relatively straightforward kind of, you know, sounds like it's relatively safe here as well. Like, these contracts are all been, you know, battle tested and whatnot, so. And especially when you're dealing with, like, something like Aave to. You're, you know, you kind of have.
00:14:25.994 - 00:14:57.974, Speaker A: You have that confidence in that protocol as well. So, yeah, even with all of the letters in front, it's keeps things relatively. It's kind of straightforward here with that. So, yeah, so with like, yeah, I guess there's like, the 50% of that pol on optimism. Yeah, we would just need to, like, split that into a vault and off we go. Or what other steps is necessary here and kind of like what's required on stargate end?
00:14:59.554 - 00:15:59.062, Speaker D: Yes, basically major pool with just StG boosted USDC. So all you'll need to do is just deposit 50 50 SDG and USDC, and then we'll automatically deposit most of that USDC into the reaper vault to farm Aave for you. So that should give you probably, like, 0.75% to 1% of additional yield. And the cool thing is, that's after our fee, which is 50% on the yield. But the cool thing is, the fee we're taking not only on swaps, but on that yield is collected by us every month. And then under our grant from optimism, we pair that one to one with op tokens, and then we will readmit that back onto the pool, either via bribes for v ball votes, if you guys prefer to farm balancer, or we can emit optimism tokens directly, which is what we're doing now for most of our pools, just because the ROI is a little bit better.
00:15:59.062 - 00:16:13.526, Speaker D: But it really depends on what optimism wants, or, I mean, what Stargate wants. If you want op, we give you that you want bal, we'll bribe for you. But that's the program we're running to try to get people to bring liquidity will return the fees as additional incentives.
00:16:13.590 - 00:16:15.230, Speaker B: Like taking a page out of solidly.
00:16:15.262 - 00:16:16.206, Speaker D: If you're familiar with.
00:16:16.270 - 00:16:16.830, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:16:16.862 - 00:16:17.102, Speaker C: Okay.
00:16:17.118 - 00:16:31.998, Speaker A: So we end up getting so even. Yeah. The fees that we are like, that the protocol is giving to you guys. Yeah. It's just kind of coming back then as op or whether we go move it into, like, bribing ecosystem. Okay.
00:16:32.166 - 00:16:32.918, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:16:32.966 - 00:17:05.102, Speaker D: We'll do all that for you. It's better than your liquidity is just sitting on uni v three, and you are earning fees there, but they're not really compounding for you, and it's not the most optimal way. This way, you're putting a lot of your USDC to work in Aave, and that earns you 1% passively. You don't have to do anything. And we also get 1%, so it's more like it's 2% for real, but we're taking half of it and then returning it to you paired doubled from op. It's a pretty great deal as long as our grant lasts, which lasts for quite a while.
00:17:05.238 - 00:17:15.750, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool, cool. No, that's. That's very. Yeah, it's very interesting. And, like, the capital efficiency that you guys are kind of coming up with here seems. Yeah, it's.
00:17:15.750 - 00:17:30.914, Speaker A: It's brilliant. It's brilliant. So, yeah. If anybody's got questions on that, please raise your hand or throw it into the AMA or. Sorry, the voice text questions. And again, there is. This is up on Commonwealth, and.
00:17:30.914 - 00:17:45.934, Speaker A: Yeah, so, please, anybody has questions, follow up with that. But, yeah, this seems like a pretty. Pretty ideal situation. Yeah. And, I mean, try it out on. On optimism and see where it can go from there.
00:17:46.714 - 00:18:09.968, Speaker D: It's also a great deal on Ethereum as well. Like, you'll pair Stargate against BBA USC, which is the three pool. So you will need to diversify your stables a bit for that one. But the. We did the exact same thing there. We'll return not only the swap fees we're earning, but the yield fee we're earning on your pool as bribes. And then you'll be able to deposit aura.
00:18:09.968 - 00:18:15.584, Speaker D: You'll farm bal and aura just for parking your money there. Like, you don't have to put up any money.
00:18:15.624 - 00:18:16.048, Speaker A: We'll just.
00:18:16.096 - 00:18:29.854, Speaker D: We'll take care of the bribes for you. So it's pretty cool because you guys bring the TVL. That's the missing part. Like, yeah, we need to start the pool somehow. So you either need a bribe to start it, or you bring a fat stack of money and just park it there. You guys have a fat stack of money.
00:18:31.114 - 00:18:41.734, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, it's cool that something that could. Could happen on, on, yeah, on Mainnet as well, rather than just optimism. So. Okay. Yeah. That's something else we could look at too, then.
00:18:41.734 - 00:18:49.690, Speaker A: Yeah. Put that into another proposal. That's kind of what maki was alluding to earlier. And yeah, we can kind of go from there.
00:18:49.842 - 00:18:53.022, Speaker D: But thanks for having me.
00:18:53.078 - 00:19:10.554, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Thank you for coming on solar curve and yeah, just keep an eye out on the forum on Commonwealth there if anybody's got any further questions on this. Yeah, we'll ping you. Keep in touch if folks have further questions. Yeah, wicked. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
00:19:10.554 - 00:19:46.158, Speaker A: Yeah, that's an interesting one, especially with just like the capital efficiency, more fees for the, for the protocol and keep growing that protocol on liquidity. Yeah. So, yeah, that's, I think what we have for proposals for now to go over. Yeah, the next stuff here. Yeah, I do want to, I just kind of want to announce this here that we are going to be doing a, we're going to be doing a campaign with layer three. We'd done that. There was like a test pilot quest that we had done.
00:19:46.158 - 00:20:18.950, Speaker A: It was like only 2000 people were able to, were eligible to participate in it and it like, was done in like a day. I think it was super fast. So. Really, really liked what they were offering and what they were doing. And yeah, just gonna engage with them to do a couple quests per month. Be able to like, you know, have these quests that are going to take people through the Stargate ecosystem and kind of build out like some interesting funnels and some ideas around how to. Yeah, how to utilize the Stargate ecosystem.
00:20:18.950 - 00:21:03.844, Speaker A: And then even if we have further integrations and other things happening there too, try and showcase those as well. I think it's going to be a really cool thing to get the community engaged, showcase integrations, all that kind of stuff. So pretty excited about that. Stay tuned for announcements around it, but just wanted to let everybody know that's here today that that's something that's coming. And yeah, we did see a lot of activity around the galaxy stuff and hopefully seeing like more of a focus, you know, towards our community with, with layer three and actually getting people excited about what's happening here with Stargate. Yeah. So that's, that's kind of what's up there and.
00:21:03.844 - 00:21:31.504, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. That's. I don't know if there's anything else here we really want to cover. Any questions from the audience here? If not, no, that's. We can probably wrap up there, I think. Anything further, Primo or Maki, to add to this.
00:21:36.104 - 00:22:19.544, Speaker B: I think we're my end. I think the big thing is, I don't know if anybody else saw, but Aptos launched yesterday, losing track of many, many sleepless nights in a row here. But Aptos just launched layer Zero launched on top of Aptos, which means Stargate is able to launch. Now. I think it's something, I think there's a couple things to consider, but I think it's something Stargate should strongly consider doing into some of these new ecosystems. I think there is this interesting scenario where right now, when you have a new ecosystem, there's only wrapped assets that exist. So all the bridges are wrapped asset bridges.
00:22:19.544 - 00:23:03.736, Speaker B: And so there's kind of two ways that Stargate can go there. It can say, we're not going to touch this ecosystem until there are native assets. Obviously, within the core protocol. That has sort of been the, one of the strongest points is that you have this instant guaranteed finality. You have the native assets like a much safer, much better experience overall, but that is strictly impossible on these new ecosystems. And so the question is, like, what does that look like? Should Stargate get into the wrapped asset game? Basically, we come bridge as a service, allow it to reach out to sort of all of these other long tail chains and hit kind of bigger chains fast ish. I think there's reasonably compelling arguments to be made for that.
00:23:03.736 - 00:24:13.862, Speaker B: I think we'd have to be clear in the UI and segregated. Does it wait until native assets and then, like, take over from the old ones and just sort of, like, dominate those ecosystems? Like it has been largely doing to, like, EVM based liquidity? Possibly, but I think there's, and there have been a lot, a lot of internal discussions. I think this is one of the most interesting things over the next, let's say, two months or so that Stargate can really, really decide. I think there are a couple of things that are really, really interesting from the Stargate side. If it does decide to go that route, I think there are really, really cool ways to increase the efficiency of liquidity that Stargate attracts at just an incredible proportion. So I think there's, like, a lot of cool stuff going on right now. I think one of the biggest things, though, is just that, like, as a protocol, it's important to figure out early on, native assets only got us where we are.
00:24:13.862 - 00:25:25.346, Speaker B: I think it is by far the safest way to bridge and the best way to bridge. I think there's, like, absolutely no doubt about that. They're just Pareto, superior to any form of reft asset, but you do have early days of ecosystems and you do have ofts, and you have all these other things that are, like, starting to pop up. And the question is, how did Stargate leverage that to stay ahead? And so I think there is a bunch of really cool things there. I think we'll try to work on something to propose, like a run inside soon. But I think it's important that the community itself also figures out kind of how it reasons about these things and how what, you know, what might that look like? What is opportunity space? I know there's a ton of people have been super passionate about on the analytics side, not just sort of everything, building dashboards and doing all of this. I think this is one of the most interesting and compelling things someone in the community can really spend time on, is what the opportunity space is, and, you know, sort of convince everybody to go in one direction or another.
00:25:25.346 - 00:25:45.426, Speaker B: So I, you know, I think I have my own. My own personal thoughts. I think I'll write them up into something kind of longer form, but I do think especially now, and, I mean, we'll see how the ecosystem develops, but as ApdOs is evolving and if it ends up taking off, I think there's a potentially really huge opportunity space there.
00:25:45.490 - 00:26:00.906, Speaker C: So, yeah, maybe we should open up a blog. Not a blog post, sorry, forum posts about this and kind of get the community going in there. I just don't like to argue personally. Like, on discord, I think sometimes you can lose it.
00:26:00.970 - 00:26:01.410, Speaker A: Right?
00:26:01.522 - 00:26:05.034, Speaker C: Like the. It's just not falling. It's not linear or something.
00:26:05.114 - 00:26:06.042, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:26:06.098 - 00:26:10.466, Speaker C: Maybe, like, we can kick start a conversation about this on the forum. That would be very nice.
00:26:10.610 - 00:26:24.814, Speaker A: Yeah, that would be great. That would be great. And then. Yeah, I guess the key takeaway here is like, yeah. Looking at whether that's wrapped assets or not, and just going to some of the. The questions here, like Ray J's got, will the current Aptos bridge remain wrapped assets or offer Stargate's native assets once available?
00:26:28.194 - 00:27:02.446, Speaker B: Yeah, just to be clear, 100%. I think there are two ways that that can go 100%. When native assets are available, it will migrate to native assets. It will hand over those sort of bridging component to Stargate. In the world where Stargate wants to get into wrapped assets, it would basically hand over, most likely kind of the bridge in those contracts over to Stargate as well. So I think that the end goal is, one way or another, that Stargate is that center of bridging. It's just about how it does that.
00:27:02.446 - 00:27:10.710, Speaker B: And what that looks like and everything from there on out. So, yeah, 100%. We'll go over to Stargate if there's native assets, no doubt.
00:27:10.902 - 00:27:26.302, Speaker A: Yeah. And then that could, again apply with other, other networks and whatnot that come online here, you know, some people asking about Solana and whatnot. Yeah. And I think the same would apply there. I think you could agree there.
00:27:26.398 - 00:27:42.646, Speaker B: Yeah. Solana already has native assets. Right. And that's one of the big things with every existing bridge in a Solana right now. Literally all of them, even in the USDC, they're like, circle issued USDC. All of the bridges deal in wrapped assets. Right.
00:27:42.646 - 00:28:05.034, Speaker B: So that's like a clear opportunity space on the Stargate side of things. But then you have other ecosystems, even in the EVM space, moonbeam, et cetera, that we're using, like, nomad wrapped assets, et cetera, that just have no native assets there. So I think there are both ends of the spectrum there, but a lot of opportunity space, for sure.
00:28:07.774 - 00:28:19.174, Speaker A: Yeah. Also, Rayjay asking about plans for ZksynC. Not sure how easy it is to port over EVM contracts and whether that's in the works. And. Yeah. Whether wrapped assets would still apply.
00:28:20.554 - 00:28:47.874, Speaker B: Yep. Client plan is definitely to be on ZkSync as early as possible. Right now, my understanding is that there will only be wrapped assets day one on zksync. I believe that is still the case, but I will sync up with them and try to figure out what that looks like. So, yeah, zksync is, you know, I think there are a lot of eyes on it, for sure.
00:28:48.894 - 00:29:02.114, Speaker A: Wicked. All right. Yeah, I guess Starknet, I'm sure. Yeah, same kind of stuff with. With Starknet. So, yeah, see how things develop with. I'm not really sure where Starknet's at right now.
00:29:02.114 - 00:29:43.276, Speaker A: Yeah, obviously Zksync, a little more people chatting about it, a little more chatter around it, but, yeah, see where that turns into. But, yeah, if any further questions or comments, concerns here. Yeah. If not, yeah, we can kind of wrap it up here for this week. But, yeah, anyways, we will look at getting that. Getting a forum post up on Commonwealth for, you know, kind of discussions around, you know, wrapped assets and everything here. We were just discussing that way we can keep the conversation kind of alive and growing there, rather than, yeah.
00:29:43.276 - 00:30:02.812, Speaker A: Just getting sporadically through discord. So that'll be a great place to. To keep track of all that stuff. And. Yeah. So please make your way over to Commonwealth, if you haven't already joined Commonwealth, please do that. And, yeah, also, if you are interested in a PO app, you will need to join guild if you haven't already.
00:30:02.812 - 00:30:50.220, Speaker A: So please do that into the future. And yeah, this is obviously live streaming over to YouTube, so thanks to everybody that's been over there listening in and also on Twitter spaces. So we do have. I see there's one person over here requesting. I don't know if they were see, I'll just speaker. I'm not sure if it's just sometimes there just can be a fat finger, but want to give people the opportunity here. MG Lobe, have you got something for us? Mg Lobe? Anything? I guess not.
00:30:50.220 - 00:31:06.564, Speaker A: That's all right. But yeah, this has been. This will be live streaming on YouTube and you'll be able to check it out afterwards. It should be available right away. And, yeah, of course, we'll see everyone in a couple weeks from now. And. Yeah, that's awesome.
00:31:06.564 - 00:31:18.764, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone. I really appreciate you coming out today and just stick around here for a little while afterwards if you want to want to po apple. Just have to keep. Keep things going here. But thanks, everyone. Ciao. Ciao.
