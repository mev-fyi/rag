00:00:00.170 - 00:00:29.506, Speaker A: Undercloudralized landing will happen. It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. And I've personally underestimated how hard it is to build undercrowized landing. So it's taking longer than I originally expected, but it will happen. It's not a good idea to hate on undercrowderalized landing. What really happened with the likes of Genesis Genesis, by the way, is undercloudalized landing. For example, what really happened to undercateralized landing, whether it's in DeFI or CFI, is the mispricing of risks is not the fact that it's under collateralized.
00:00:29.506 - 00:00:49.140, Speaker A: It's because the risks are mispriced. The rates were too low to compensate for the risks that the lenders were taking, and the risks will be taken care of by the market. The market will always take care of itself in terms of rates risks. So we're just going to see higher yields, higher rates. But that does not prevent under collateralized lending from happening.
