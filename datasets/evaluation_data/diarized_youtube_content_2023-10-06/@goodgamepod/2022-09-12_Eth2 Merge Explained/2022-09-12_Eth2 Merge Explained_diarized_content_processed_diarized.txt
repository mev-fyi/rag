00:00:00.200 - 00:00:31.678, Speaker A: Let's start with the basics. Right. You know, ETH two is ultimately a new transition from going from proof of work to proof of stake. Previously, when the ETHW white paper was written, it was primarily scaling through sharding, which is it would have 64 data shards. And shards are ultimately, you could think of them as, like, mini databases. And the reason why it's created that way is so that apps could scale exponentially when they're building, so they don't have to compete for block space. But they transitioned to a different model most recently, which is scaling through rollups.
00:00:31.678 - 00:00:47.854, Speaker A: And so now the white paper has rewritten its scaling strategy to include, like, rollups as a way to primarily scale, which I think is very interesting and probably very smart. And the proof of stake is a prerequisite for more roll ups. Is that right? That's right.
