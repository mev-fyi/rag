00:00:00.160 - 00:00:01.198, Speaker A: I think the world that we're going.
00:00:01.206 - 00:00:07.342, Speaker B: To be moving into next is going to be very different than the world we're in today. And I'm pretty excited about a lot of stuff that you mentioned.
00:00:07.358 - 00:00:23.310, Speaker C: On the AI side. Point being, if you're looking to pivot from crypto to AI, don't do that, because there's a lot of opportunities at the intersection of crypto and AI. And I'm saying that because I know people are pivoting away from crypto and AI.
00:00:23.382 - 00:00:24.870, Speaker D: We had a startup the other day.
00:00:24.902 - 00:00:30.198, Speaker B: That applied, and they ended up sending us an email saying that they're going to pivot to AI.
00:00:30.246 - 00:00:42.534, Speaker C: I don't blame them. I don't blame them. If you need to survive in this bear market, and people like VC's are fomoing into AI startups, and if you really believe in AI, then sure, by all means, take the money.
