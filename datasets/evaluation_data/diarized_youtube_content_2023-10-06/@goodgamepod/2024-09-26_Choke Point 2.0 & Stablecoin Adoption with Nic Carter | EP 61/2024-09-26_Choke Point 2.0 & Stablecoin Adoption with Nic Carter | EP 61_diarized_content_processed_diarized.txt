00:00:00.440 - 00:00:04.125, Speaker A: Welcome to Good Game. Your no BS insights for crypto founders.
00:00:08.025 - 00:00:29.639, Speaker B: I think the supply stable is going to balloon to 500 billion. It's going to become completely ordinary to have your corporate balance sheet in stablecoins. Cost for men is going to come down. Globally, the world has become so much smaller because payments can be so much more efficient. So that's why we're leaning into this and doubling down. And that's why frankly, I want to be like the first name in stablecoins.
00:00:29.687 - 00:00:43.767, Speaker A: From the venture perspective, when I think about stablecoins, I think about you. I mean, that's so sweet. I mean, you've been talking about this since 2017. I think I felt like you've been talking about crypto dollars.
00:00:43.951 - 00:01:00.927, Speaker B: But my conviction has been growing as you know. Like the first thing that gave me conviction was like I saw that in 2020 to the crypto dollar white paper, I saw that 40% of blockchain volume was stablecoins. Since then it actually touched like 70, 80%. So like 70, 80% of all value settled on blockchains was stablecoins.
00:01:01.071 - 00:01:02.671, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in.
00:01:02.703 - 00:01:04.807, Speaker C: Crypto, check out our request for startups.
00:01:04.831 - 00:01:11.751, Speaker A: List and get inspired at Alliance XYZ Ideas. Weren't you supposed to fight this week?
00:01:11.783 - 00:01:12.355, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:12.735 - 00:01:14.495, Speaker A: And I think you had an injury.
00:01:14.575 - 00:01:18.111, Speaker B: Yeah, I have two herniated discs in my back.
00:01:18.263 - 00:01:19.309, Speaker A: Is that from training?
00:01:19.447 - 00:01:37.165, Speaker B: Yeah, over training? Yeah. Cause I, no, I, I mean I actually for. I had stopped doing all compound lifting when I got into boxing. I do like lifting. Focused on muscular endurance. I'm. I'm not going for hypertrophy or strength.
00:01:37.165 - 00:01:51.103, Speaker B: But yeah, I started training in March for the Hoffman fight and that didn't happen. Then I kept training because I immediately booked another fight, which I did do and I won that fight.
00:01:51.199 - 00:01:52.319, Speaker A: I saw that. I saw it.
00:01:52.407 - 00:02:10.595, Speaker B: And then I immediately started training for the third fight, which then I got injured. So I did three full training camps and they had one fight out of those three, which felt very unlucky. But yeah, as it turns out, it's like you just like have to take a break in between training camps. It's so much load.
00:02:11.375 - 00:02:16.451, Speaker A: So I remember watching the. At least for the first fight you had like a training video.
00:02:16.563 - 00:02:17.835, Speaker B: Yeah, I put out a really silly.
00:02:17.875 - 00:02:25.475, Speaker A: Promo video and I was like, man, this guy. Like, I could tell if, you know, people could get intimidated by it, right?
00:02:25.555 - 00:02:28.295, Speaker B: Yeah. People thought that's why Hoffman pulled out.
00:02:28.875 - 00:02:33.539, Speaker A: Which is where I was going with this because I felt like, you know, after seeing that video, I would probably.
00:02:33.587 - 00:02:43.275, Speaker B: Like you know, I mean, we'll see how he does in his fight against Kane. I do think I was going to destroy him in the fight if he had made it, but we don't know.
00:02:43.395 - 00:02:47.515, Speaker A: So would you challenge him again when you're ready?
00:02:47.675 - 00:02:52.907, Speaker B: I told him I would fight the winner of Hoffman and Kane. So they fight in October.
00:02:53.051 - 00:02:53.571, Speaker A: Nice.
00:02:53.683 - 00:02:55.355, Speaker B: But Kane is huge, man. He's like.
00:02:55.395 - 00:02:55.955, Speaker A: Kane's tall.
00:02:56.035 - 00:02:56.587, Speaker B: He's big.
00:02:56.651 - 00:02:57.475, Speaker A: He's tall.
00:02:57.635 - 00:03:05.019, Speaker B: I weigh 155 right now. Yeah, I think he weighs like, I don't know, 175, 180. Like, he's. He's way bigger than me.
00:03:05.067 - 00:03:06.775, Speaker A: And he's in. He's an Aussie too.
00:03:07.545 - 00:03:14.925, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. So he's built different. It's just a natural scrapper. Natural scrapper with that convict DNA.
00:03:17.745 - 00:03:44.819, Speaker A: Oh, man. But you put a tweet out. Was it yesterday? Operation Chokepoint 2.0. I think you put a. The original tweet was about a year ago where you kind of had this narrative of how the US is purposefully pushing back against crypto with, like, Silvergate and other banks, and it seems like that thesis is turning out to be true.
00:03:44.907 - 00:03:46.459, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah.
00:03:46.547 - 00:03:51.899, Speaker A: So maybe if you want to talk about the start of the choke point 2.0 and then we can go deeper.
00:03:51.987 - 00:04:31.503, Speaker B: Yeah. The funny thing is I wrote that Tweet storm at 4am Singapore time, just because I couldn't sleep. So I was thumbing through the Silvergate bankruptcy filings because they finally filed bankruptcy over a year after they liquidated the bank or started the process. And the Chief Administrative Officer wrote this brief, this affidavit, and I couldn't believe what I was reading because it confirmed every single thing. And on the record that I had initially written about Silvergate at the time, I guess it was maybe March 23rd. I mean, it's a fascinating story. It's underreported.
00:04:31.503 - 00:05:10.785, Speaker B: I don't think people know the true story. You know, there's the narrative in the press and the popular narrative around Silvergate Signature and svb, and then there's what actually happened, and they're so wildly different from each other. And to this day, I'm still like, seething with rage over what happened. I think it's an enormous scandal and I don't think it's really registered at all how bad it was. I think the truth is so much worse than what people think. So, I mean, I guess we can start at the beginning. Is that where we should start? So, you know, November 2022, FTX goes down.
00:05:10.785 - 00:05:48.405, Speaker B: And Silvergate did service some of the Alameda FTX entities. And there was just a, you know, credit destruction event in crypto. Balance sheets shrank. And you know, Silvergate was a boutique crypto bank, as you guys know. They had this Silvergate exchange network, sun, which was a kind of intra bank clearinghouse, which actually was really useful for stablecoins and things like that. So they were one of the very crypto focused banks, along with Signature. So really their whole business was serving crypto clients.
00:05:48.405 - 00:06:35.305, Speaker B: And simultaneous with the FTX collapse and the Three Arrows collapse and the Terra Luna collapse was obviously the rate hike cycle. And that's not a coincidence. Obviously the rates hiking caused in part the liquidity destruction. And so you had two things happen at the same time, both of which were very bad for the banks, especially the crypto banks was dependent depositors fleeing, redeeming withdrawing funds. And at the same time the value of the fixed income portfolios those banks were holding was declining because the rates were rising. And that combo is very bad for a bank. Having flighty depositors and the asset portfolio selling off.
00:06:35.305 - 00:07:09.627, Speaker B: That's kind of a crisis for a bank, right. And so people started posting all these things online about how they were underwater on their asset portfolio. There were massive redemptions. And I think from what I recall, Silvergate was the first bank to experience real distress. And the stock price plunged overnight. And then they kind of abruptly announced that they were going into. Actually it wasn't that abrupt, but eventually they announced that they were voluntarily liquidating the bank, which is a very uncommon thing.
00:07:09.627 - 00:07:37.597, Speaker B: And that should have been kind of a flag to people that something weird was up. How many times have you heard about a bank voluntarily liquidating? Signature was sent into receivership. Svb I think the same, like they, they were acquired or bailed out and acquired. Maybe Silvergate was different. They voluntarily liquidated the bank. So they just chose to wind it down. Nobody lost any money.
00:07:37.597 - 00:08:28.345, Speaker B: The depositors were made whole. Every penny owed to the depositors was honored. And what had actually happened was following rtx, the bank regulators in this country became extremely focused on the crypto banks, the banks servicing the crypto space. So in January of 23, trying to remember the timeline now, there was this joint letter from the Fed, FDIC and I think occasionally saying, we think crypto is a risk to the safety and soundness of banks. And that was kind of a sign that something was up. What wasn't public at that time was the Fed started going around. I think it was really the regional Feds Actually started going around to the bank saying you have to reduce your crypto exposure to only an ancillary amount.
00:08:28.345 - 00:09:05.015, Speaker B: So what that meant in practice was if you have 90% of your depositors or crypto related, you have to cut that down to 15%. And for a bank whose business is crypto, that just means you're out of business. Right. So it's like going to Dunkin Donuts and be like, you can't sell donuts, you can't sell coffee, you can only sell whatever those like greasy breakfast sandwiches they have are. So at this point Silvergate kind of took stock. They'd suffered, you know, significant redemptions. The stock price had fallen a lot.
00:09:05.015 - 00:09:42.299, Speaker B: They were still solvent at this point. And the directors of bank realized because this new verbally messaged informal mandate, but something that they felt they still had to adhere to 15% crypto depository threshold cap, that they didn't really have any new avenues as a bank. They weren't viable anymore. They were a boutique that served the crypto industry. That was kind of the whole point of Silvergate. And then they chose to voluntarily wind down. So following that, I believe the next one to go was svb.
00:09:42.347 - 00:09:43.563, Speaker A: SVB afterwards. Yeah.
00:09:43.619 - 00:10:05.119, Speaker B: And that was much. So the, the Silvergate thing was kind of contained to crypto. The next one to go was svb. That was a scandal that engulfed the whole venture capital world. And it was a huge thing. And everybody got mad at the venture capitalists. It was this whole thing about VCs telling their port coast to withdraw, which was actually the right call.
00:10:05.119 - 00:10:09.679, Speaker B: I mean, you know, if you work in crypto, you know that at the first sign of trouble you pull your funds.
00:10:09.727 - 00:10:10.359, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:10.527 - 00:10:32.417, Speaker B: And you know, that caused the issue with Circle. Of course. Circle had had what, $3 billion USDC on, on SVB. They didn't have a ton of crypto exposure though. I think that was really it actually that was more of a sort of like a venture capital scandal and people were upset, like, oh, didn't USDC depeg? They did down to almost all the way down to 82 cents.
00:10:32.521 - 00:10:33.201, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:10:33.273 - 00:10:58.157, Speaker B: Which was a very interesting opportunity because the fair value of USDC at that point was higher than 82 cents. But people were worried that it was like a first it. They were worried that the funds wouldn't be there and so some folks would be left holding the bag. So a lot of people bought USDC that weekend, which was smart. And then signature was kind of. And they were more crypto focused. They're also a real estate bank.
00:10:58.157 - 00:11:43.725, Speaker B: In New York, but they had a big crypto business and they were sent into receivership on a kind of a Sunday night, I think by nydfs. And then Barney Frank came out and said he was the chairman of Signature and he came out and said, this is fishy, we're being targeted. We were solvent, we were being targeted because we were crypto bank. Which Barney Frank wasn't even a big crypto booster. So people thought that was a pretty credible thing for him to say. In the end, I think even the regulators admitted Signature wasn't really sent into receivership because they were insolvent, but because the regulators lost faith in management. It seemed like more of a political hatchet job.
00:11:43.725 - 00:12:25.705, Speaker B: And there's two theories as to why this happened, why DFS did this. One is that they were a crypto bank. The other was that they had been serving Trump's buddies, Trump and his buddies in the real estate world in New York. And so DFS had been wanting an excuse to take them out. And that one I think is on its own, a huge scandal. It's like a solvent bank was just sent into receivership and sold off. The other thing that really perked up my ears was as these three banks, svb, Signature and Silvergate, started going through the process of acquisitions being sold off and folded into acquiring banks.
00:12:25.705 - 00:13:02.843, Speaker B: The crypto lines of businesses were not included in those sales. So actually I heard from a source, I think this was in the context of Signature. There were the three Cs, the three Cs that were not allowed to be sold. China, Cayman and crypto. So business lines pertaining to Chinese companies, to companies based in the Cayman and to crypto firms, those were not included in the sales. And so in the end, SEN and Signet, Signet was Signature's version of sen. And all of the crypto deposits at these firms were not included in the sales.
00:13:02.843 - 00:13:39.055, Speaker B: And I believe it was the FDIC brokering that process. And that's also very suspicious. It's like, okay, fine, these banks in wind down mode for one reason or another. And we're just going to tell the crypto depositors, here's a check, take the money back. You're not allowed to have those deposits transfer over to the new acquiring bank. That's intensely suspicious as well. So that's another sign there's something going on from a regulatory perspective in terms of trying to eliminate the exposure to the banking system to the crypto space.
00:13:39.055 - 00:14:46.701, Speaker B: The other thing, of course, that I didn't even mention is there was a campaign by Short Sellers to go after these banks, especially Signature and Silvergate. Mark Cohodes, really well known short seller, was orchestrating a lot of this. And you had members of Congress writing letters harassing these banks and implying kind of encouraging in some ways, the bank runs, which I think is incredibly reckless. That's crazy. So Elizabeth Warren, she wrote a number of letters, I think more than one letter about Silvergate, saying things like, oh, we think it's very risky that you're serving the crypto space. And we think there's probably BSA violations, I'm paraphrasing here, you know, pertaining to ftx. And I think that also probably helped encourage, you know, the pace of withdrawals here because if you know the senator who's, you know, the chair of the Senate Banking Committee or like very, very senior there, is saying you're targeting this bank, you probably just want to, you know, pull out your funds just to be safe.
00:14:46.701 - 00:15:12.075, Speaker B: So you had encouragement of like the, of the bank runs from the, from the highest levels here politically. So it's kind of a perfect storm. Everyone hated crypto. Everyone was worried about potential criminal liability inherited from rtx. Even though in the end Silvergate faced no criminal liability whatsoever. There was nothing that materialized. So the short sellers lied about that.
00:15:12.075 - 00:15:52.801, Speaker B: But you had the fed and the OCC and the FDIC writing these communiques saying in two of them in January 23rd, saying, you know, crypto is dangerous. It's a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking system. You had rates hiking. So there was also a fundamental reason to mistrust the banks. And what people don't know, but what we do know now is that the bank regulators were going around to these banks saying, you can only have 15% of your deposits pertain to crypto. So that was the story. In the end, the domestic banking infrastructure that was serving the crypto space was taken out behind the woodshed and shot.
00:15:52.801 - 00:16:16.905, Speaker B: Or you could say they died. You say they died by suicide. In my view, they were murdered. And then we entered this period, which continues to today, in which crypto firms have very hard time getting banking. And there were some banks that kind of picked up the slack after this. Customers cross river. Every single bank that put up their hand and said will be the bank that serves the crypto industry.
00:16:16.905 - 00:16:58.695, Speaker B: They all ended up facing consent orders, some kind of enforcement action. It's not a coincidence. The regulators just continued the sort of reign of terror going after selectively the banks that were serving crypto. And they didn't say it was for crypto they would always say it was some kind of bank secrecy act thing, some sort of compliance issue beyond even crypto. They kept doing this to banks serving embedded finance fintech. So any bank that's doing anything, sort of like technologically enabled as partner bank since then has had a much, much higher risk of an enforcement action or consent order, whether it's from the Fed or the fdic. And there is good data on this.
00:16:58.695 - 00:17:54.413, Speaker B: I mean it's like orders of magnitude higher risk than your average bank. So you could say that's because crypto is inherently risky or because being a partner bank to embedded finance or to these newer fintechs is risky. You could also say it's a political thing. So in March 23rd I wrote a piece calling this operation Chokepoint 2.0, which is a callback to a real thing called Operation Chokepoint, which happened under the Obama administration in which the bank regulators, namely the fdic, used these insinuations and threats to persuade banks to stop doing business with certain disfavored industries like firearms manufacturing and the adult industry. And that was actually the Obama administration explicitly called it Operation Choke Point, which is kind of funny, it's a very sinister name. And so I thought that this was reminiscent of that.
00:17:54.413 - 00:18:37.125, Speaker B: And actually if you look at the fdic, it was the same chairman chair Marty Gruenberg who had been in place running the FDIC under Obama, came back under Biden. So he was the same guy. And so I labeled it an Operation Chokepoint 2.0. Then those three major banks failed in various ways. And I thought that was more confirmation that these banks. Not only had the federal regulators gone after the banks to try and marginalize crypto, but they'd actually ended up destroying some of these banks in kind of a deliberate way. And so they went actually even further, which is to eliminate the banks and to eliminate the crypto lines of business throughout the process of acquisitions.
00:18:37.125 - 00:19:09.255, Speaker B: So I made a lot of noise about that. Some people picked it up, certainly now everyone in the industry talks about operation choke point 2.0. Various members of Congress talked about it, Senator Hagerty did. We actually had hearings in the House about it, but I don't think there was any remediation really. The status quo persisted and it's still to this day very hard to get banking as a crypto firm. You guys know this for sure? Yeah, it's not impossible, but it just makes doing business much more expensive. It's very costly now.
00:19:09.255 - 00:19:59.305, Speaker B: And it's something that as a vc, you invest in startups, you Expect they're able to get banking that should be just an ordinary thing. Unfortunately, it's not the case in crypto and everyone that operates in crypto has a story about being unbanked. And so since then, the banks have all been pretty unwilling to service especially smaller crypto clients. It's not worth it for them. The other interesting thing is there's no possibility of a network effect to recreate something like Ascend or a signet, because none of these banks can have enough deposits to bring all of these clients under one roof to create these kind of clearing networks like sun and Signet, that were very useful for stablecoin liquidity, especially outside of banking hours. That's another issue there. So fast forward all the way to today.
00:19:59.305 - 00:20:31.739, Speaker B: Silvergate has settled with the SEC over kind of like trumped up charges. I think the thing they settled with the SEC for was nothing that bad. It was basically the SEC felt that the bank's leadership had made false public statements about the soundness of the bank, but they didn't nail them on anything that mattered. Right? There were no criminal charges stemming from ftx. Silvergate had been a victim of FTX just like everybody else. FTX had lied to them and they were victim. They were not in cahoots with them.
00:20:31.739 - 00:21:43.543, Speaker B: And so, you know, any criminal charges did not materialize and they. So Silvergate had settled these charges and they sort of finally liquidated and now they have begun filing for bankruptcy. And so I was reading the filings and one of the filings was from the former Chief Administrative officer. And in this filing she details specifically on the record everything that happened, what I just described, which previously the only way that information had made its way into the popular discourse was through insiders talking on background, unwilling to attach their names to this stuff because of the ongoing litigation, things like that. And now for the first time, this is a extremely credible account of how Silvergate was kind of taken out with this political hatchet job. It wasn't just that they happened to fail, it was that they were kind of forced into liquidation because their business was made impossible to run due to these political mandates targeting the crypto space. So that was what my thread was about.
00:21:43.543 - 00:21:56.955, Speaker B: I think it's a huge deal. No one in the press has picked it up so far, which is incredibly shocking. I consider it a scandal, but, and I think crypto people do, but outside the industry, it's, it's, it's crickets.
00:21:57.255 - 00:22:05.715, Speaker C: You mentioned the Fed, fdic, OCC and Liz Warren. But who's really behind all of this. And what is their incentive?
00:22:06.295 - 00:22:54.069, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. I don't think we know yet who individually is responsible. I think we all know that as part of Biden's election or primary process prior to the election last time around, there was a deal that they struck with the progressives. So the deal was Elizabeth Warren would be able to appoint various key financial regulators or to have kind of sign off over those appointments. So that was kind of how they united the moderate faction, the progressive faction. That's why she would lend her support to the Biden, Biden as a candidate. So she had a lot of appointments that had a progressive approach and obviously very skeptical of crypto, skeptical of any kind of payment system that's outside of the direct ambit of the state.
00:22:54.069 - 00:23:34.469, Speaker B: Right. I think it's very important to understand that progressives kind of view finance as an extension of the state and as a tool to be utilized to pursue political outcomes, whether it's climate goals. So they see this in a positive way. So, okay, there's finance, there's credit provision, there's payment systems, there's banks. Can we utilize these systems to promote our social objectives, climate change, social justice, et cetera. So they view this as a good thing, as a feature of the system. I would say we probably think that finance should be apolitical.
00:23:34.469 - 00:24:02.805, Speaker B: It should be sort of a utility that anyone has access to, regardless of who you are or what you believe. So there's just an inherent conflict of vision there. But so a lot of these regulators put into place by Warren saw crypto in a very negative light. And we don't know yet who was kind of spearheading this. My guess is that Bharat Rama Murty, inside, I think at the time the National Economic Council, so inside the Biden White House, was one of the individuals spearheading this.
00:24:03.225 - 00:24:04.245, Speaker C: Who is he?
00:24:04.745 - 00:24:51.033, Speaker B: He was just kind of a former Warren staffer, sort of Warren acolyte that was quite powerful within the Biden White House. I think he's since changed role. I'd say he's sort of one of the main architects of Chokepoint, as far as I could tell. But it doesn't necessarily have to be a conspiracy. It could just be the case that a lot of these regulators were all skeptical of crypto. And I think the thing that change, you could ask, why did chokepoint 2.0, why was it launched in January 23rd? And I think you could say they felt that they had a political mandate to go after crypto after ftx, because sentiment regarding crypto was so bad and it was seen as an acceptable target at that point.
00:24:51.209 - 00:24:52.925, Speaker A: What's the real threat though?
00:24:53.585 - 00:25:43.837, Speaker B: Well, we don't know exactly, but I think it was more that they thought crypto was a nuisance and they saw the opportunity to really plunge the dagger into the heart of the industry at that point and kill it off. And I think that's why actually crypto has been so successful this cycle electorally, is because a lot of folks on the left thought it was dead after ftx and they hadn't planned for a world in which it would come back and find its voice in Washington. So what I think really happened was after ftx anti crypto folks in Washington decided to plunge the dagger in and try and really kill off the industry. And one of the ways to do this was through banking infrastructure. But yeah, we still don't know for sure who the architects of chokepoint 2.0 are.
00:25:43.861 - 00:25:51.585, Speaker C: What are some of the scenarios that could happen post election in November and how would it affect crypto?
00:25:51.885 - 00:26:31.237, Speaker B: Well, one would be a Democrat clean sweep. So they win both houses and they win the presidency. That could happen. I mean, things are trending well for VP Harris right now, although the electoral math is still favorable for the Republicans on the Senate side. So my base case is actually Republican, Senate, Democrat, everything else, which is an okay outcome actually as far as crypto is concerned because the Senate has to confirm the nominees. So the next Gensler would not be able to be appointed in this situation. The next Gruenberg would not be able to appointed.
00:26:31.237 - 00:27:20.835, Speaker B: So if the Senate flips Republican, then that's pretty positive because you're able to really restrain these super progressive appointments for financial regulators for these cabinet positions. But on the other hand, if it's a Democratic clean sweep, I think we can expect more of the same. I don't think anything would change with regards to Chokepoint. Maybe there's some kind of constitutional lawsuit on, you know, fifth Amendment grounds, due process grounds. But obviously if Trump wins and the Republicans do well, that totally changes the game for crypto in this country. But the one thing to watch out for would be if the Senate flips Republican, then even under a Harris administration, we're still a little bit more protected from a very activist, interventionist Washington.
00:27:21.575 - 00:27:39.955, Speaker A: How do you see banking infra moving forward? You mentioned a couple banks that cross River. They're still supporting some of our founders, but they have to like write and incorporate in such a way they're viewed as more of a fintech company than a crypto company. So anything actually Regarded to crypto they have to remove. Do you see this changing at all?
00:27:40.295 - 00:28:09.085, Speaker B: I think it really depends what happens in November. Frankly things have started to change a little bit on the banking side. I mean there's a lot of stuff I didn't Even mention, like SAB 121 which is this SEC rule which means that banks cannot really custody crypto assets. Right. We can get into the mechanics of that, but that's effectively what it means. Just in the last couple of weeks or so it's become clear that. Well, there was a bill passed to repeal SAB 1 to 1.
00:28:09.085 - 00:28:27.439, Speaker B: Both houses. Biden vetoed it. There's been a lot of political pressure on this and the big banks are actually. People say it's crypto versus the banks. It's actually not true. The banks want to do crypto stuff. It's an opportunity to build a new business lines a non interest sources of revenue.
00:28:27.439 - 00:28:28.663, Speaker B: Banks love that.
00:28:28.799 - 00:28:32.415, Speaker A: And they are doing some though, right? What's like JP Morgan?
00:28:32.575 - 00:29:07.709, Speaker B: Yeah, but I think many banks would like to go further and engage with stablecoins or build crypto custody businesses because of saab one to one they weren't able to do this and they actually surrender that terrain to crypto native businesses, which is interesting. So this regulatory prohibition meant that crypto firms could seize the market. Right. That's why Coinbase has this near monopoly on crypto custody for the ETF providers. Right. If it hadn't been for this, you'd have probably seen the large established custodian banks win that market instead. So they're actually not that happy about this.
00:29:07.709 - 00:29:36.817, Speaker B: Right. So it's not crypto versus the banks. It's actually the banks, many of them want to do crypto. They have been restrained from doing that due to things like SAB 121 or in I think it was August of 23 the Fed came out with this communique saying if you're a bank and you want to do stablecoins, you have to get a specific permission slip from us, like a hall pass. I think the subtext there is. It's like when you're in school and the teacher's like, oh yeah, if you want to go pee you need a hall pass. And then the teacher just doesn't write you the hall pass.
00:29:36.817 - 00:30:24.145, Speaker B: What do you need to go pee? So you pee your pants. Um, it's kind of like that was the subtext. It's like, okay, yeah, you have to get permission, we're just not going to give you permission. So virtually no banks do Stablecoin stuff in this country. The interesting thing that's changed with SAB one to one is I believe it was reported maybe yesterday that BNY Mellon, the largest I think custodian maybe in the world, is getting kind of an exception from it, which I think is, you know, it's good in a sense that there are exceptions to SAB 121, which is a bad rule. It's also bad in the sense that it's picking winners and losers in terms of who's allowed to skirt this rule. It would be better if the rule was just eliminated, which is the law that Congress passed that Biden vetoed.
00:30:24.145 - 00:31:09.327, Speaker B: There has been a ton of pressure and I think the bank lobby has actually been a little bit successful in pushing back on it. So I do think that domestic banks will eventually be able to do more crypto things which they want to do. If they look at their competitors overseas, whether it's SauceGen, Nomura, foreign banks, Japanese banks, European banks, the Swiss banking sector, Standard Chartered, they're all doing all kinds of crypto stuff. They are know, intermediating stablecoin transactions. In some cases they're issuing stable coins, they're doing tokenized RWAs. Right. In the US all of the interest in crypto stuff has been limited to asset managers.
00:31:09.327 - 00:31:45.335, Speaker B: Right. So the fidelities, the blackrocks, the Franklin Templetons, the world non bank entities. So the banks feel a little bit left behind and they're seeing their competitors on Wall street able to do crypto stuff and they're seeing foreign banks just going crazy doing crypto stuff. Like the amount of work that Standard Charter is doing in crypto is remarkable. And so I think they're feeling a little bit of fomo. So I do think regardless of what happens in November next year, domestic banks will probably be able to do more crypto things. I think that's a good thing.
00:31:45.835 - 00:32:13.219, Speaker A: One more question, and this is regarding our data. So in our data alliance we get about 2000 applications per batch. We accept maybe 20, 25 startups because of all the chokepoint 2.0 and the lack of regard for crypto in the US has pushed a lot of the founders in the US not to build in crypto. And in fact if you look at our application data, we went from what.
00:32:13.267 - 00:32:18.693, Speaker C: 60%, almost 80% to 20% over the last two years, US based, US based startups.
00:32:18.829 - 00:32:23.745, Speaker B: So from 80% to 20% in the last two years. My God.
00:32:24.725 - 00:32:53.807, Speaker A: And all of that is now moved out to like India, Singapore, Dubai, Dubai, even Europe. Europe and to some degree, like you could say that, you know, because of chokepoint 2.0 FTX, it has ultimately pushed innovation outside of the US which is another big byproduct of what's happening here. We'd love to hear your feedback or your thoughts on what I just said. And then where do we go from here? As U.S. yeah.
00:32:53.871 - 00:32:58.455, Speaker B: So, I mean, from our seat as a venture firm, we see the same thing. We don't have as good data as you guys.
00:32:58.495 - 00:32:59.255, Speaker A: We can send you the data.
00:32:59.295 - 00:33:22.897, Speaker B: Yeah, that's fascinating. We also see the Electric Capital Report looking at developers, they're also noticing this trend of outflows. Really any metric you look at in crypto, like, look at where stablecoins are issued from. What's the number one stablecoin Tether? Where are they issued outside the US at 70% of the market, USDC. That's like the domestic stablecoin. Their market shares declined. Look at Paxos.
00:33:22.897 - 00:33:47.669, Speaker B: They're a big stable coin issuer. Been in New York for over 10 years. Where did they go to issue their newest stablecoin to? Dubai, I believe. So it's just this constant flow of funds, capital, entrepreneurs, developers, talent away from the U.S. which is insane. America is the global hub of capital markets. It's the biggest financial center in the world.
00:33:47.669 - 00:34:19.785, Speaker B: I think if you add up all the public equity in the world, America has around 50% of global public equity capitalization. America is the global center for securities markets. That's an underrated reason why the dollar is so strong as well, because you need dollars to buy our fixed income and our securities. And the best companies in the world are here. And that's where the innovation is happening. This is where AI innovation is happening, et cetera. And it's incredibly sad from the seat of a venture capitalist to see this trend reverse.
00:34:19.785 - 00:34:53.273, Speaker B: And that's part of America's cultural power. Political power is firms being issued, created here. Foreign founders, immigrants come in, they start their companies here. And it's so bizarre to see it reversing and founders going to Europe, of all places, which is not London, for progressive regulation. But you know, to their credit, they did pass mica. They have published some rules of the road for crypto, which we have not. You see all sorts of crypto businesses going to Singapore.
00:34:53.273 - 00:35:23.649, Speaker B: Of course, we've noticed this in our practice and we do tons of offshore deals now. Which is more complex for in a lot of ways, like you, there's different, you know, legal regimes, which is makes deals more costly and more complex. There's Tax considerations. I wish I didn't know about pfic, but I know all too much about that. That occupies like a third of my brain at this point. It's horrible. So I wish I didn't have to invest overseas, but that is where the good founders are going now.
00:35:23.649 - 00:36:00.179, Speaker B: It's true. And it just makes building a startup in America much more capital intensive because you need a huge amount of cash just to get up and running with service providers, which is crazy. You need to be bigger to be credible in order to get the account at J.P. morgan, and you need a war chest to fight the inevitable battle you're going to fight with the SEC or the cftc. And so it's very disappointing. It's hurting our competitiveness. No matter what you think of crypto, seeing this flight of founders and capital and talent overseas is bad.
00:36:00.179 - 00:36:08.895, Speaker B: I mean, there's just no interpretation of that. That's good. And so, yeah, we see it too, but I didn't realize it was actually so stark, the way you present it.
00:36:09.835 - 00:36:20.211, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty scary, actually, because US has always been known as the hub of innovation and now that's kind of moving to other areas.
00:36:20.403 - 00:36:41.387, Speaker B: I mean, and you know, it used to be the other way, like foreign. The best talent in the world would specifically come to America to build their companies. Now you've all American entrepreneurs going to Singapore, Hong Kong, London, Berlin, Dubai, uae, Bermuda, to build places that have passed rules about crypto, stablecoins, et cetera.
00:36:41.451 - 00:37:05.687, Speaker A: And they're being very aggressive, especially in Abu Dhabi. In Dubai, they've opened up a whole, like, innovation hub. They're paying founders to go over there and build their specifically crypto. They're offering banking, onboarding services, incubators, you know, a ton of, like, services that's just bringing the crypto startups to those kind of countries, which I thought was also very interesting.
00:37:05.751 - 00:37:16.561, Speaker B: Yeah, we've noticed this as well. I think specifically Dubai and Abu Dhabi have really been very successful in doing this, which is America's loss.
00:37:16.633 - 00:37:37.913, Speaker A: Yeah. So you recently published alongside Peter at Brevin Howard, an entire stablecoin report along with Visa Kai, and there was a ton of learnings. Some of the things that we've seen from the startup side with the data that you provided, it was like, okay, that makes perfect sense.
00:37:37.969 - 00:37:39.101, Speaker C: Very consistent with our.
00:37:39.213 - 00:37:40.385, Speaker A: Very consistent.
00:37:41.445 - 00:37:45.893, Speaker B: Thank you for validating the things I'm saying. I appreciate that you want to, you.
00:37:45.909 - 00:37:46.493, Speaker A: Want to talk about that?
00:37:46.549 - 00:37:51.605, Speaker C: Well, I'm just curious, what, what are some of the main takeaways from your stablecoin research in that report.
00:37:51.725 - 00:38:12.605, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'll just briefly introduce the report. So I've been just obsessed with stablecoins for forever, for a very long time. I remember to establish my credentials on this topic in 2020 I wrote a white paper called Crypto Dollars. The story so far, I was trying to rebrand stablecoins to crypto dollars. It did not work. Nobody calls them crypto dollars.
00:38:12.605 - 00:38:19.289, Speaker B: They call them stablecoins. That's a bad term in my opinion. But we're stuck with it. Everybody hates the term stablecoins.
00:38:19.337 - 00:38:21.289, Speaker A: I don't know, I hate RWAs too.
00:38:21.337 - 00:38:41.059, Speaker B: RWA is also bad. RWA also means something already in traditional finance and just really confusing. We love stablecoins. I think it's the obvious unambiguous killer app in crypto. That's not even an interesting thing to say anymore. Everybody agrees with that. People aren't excited by it.
00:38:41.059 - 00:39:15.423, Speaker B: Non venture capitalists are not excited about it because there's no way to really invest in stablecoins beyond. There's actually a few that you know, there are defi stables and there's governance token to invest in. Actually some of those have been very successful. But for the most part I think it's an interesting scissor moment because it reveals about a person, one's enthusiasm for stablecoins. It reveals whether you care about building global frictionless capital markets or if you just care about making money on tokens. Right. And there's nothing wrong with making money on tokens.
00:39:15.423 - 00:40:06.565, Speaker B: But I like to think that we have some sort of higher minded principles in this industry and we're actually pushing to make the world a better place, a flatter and a smaller world where the tools of finance are available to ordinary people that don't have it. Stablecoins deliver that more so than anything else in crypto in my opinion. And so if someone is bored by stablecoins I would be a little suspicious of them maybe because stablecoins are so obviously good for the planet. They're good for ordinary individuals, especially in emerging markets that how can you not be excited by that? And the metrics are so good and so strong. So we wrote an initial report, we did a lot of on chain data, kind of top level data. It's like top down, sort of like God's eye view. And now everybody is very familiar with the on chain data even though it still takes some interpretation.
00:40:06.565 - 00:40:36.799, Speaker B: But everybody knows the numbers up and to the right. You know, tether on Tron is very active. There's 25 million addresses on all Blockchains using stable coins every month there's 120 plus million addresses on chain on all blockchains that have a non zero stable coin balance. Stablecoins are settling in my estimate around $5 trillion a year. Some people say it's higher. I've actually a more conservative approach. Everybody knows the numbers are up and importantly the numbers are up regardless of the crypto market cycle.
00:40:36.799 - 00:41:10.529, Speaker B: That's a very huge thing this product market fit. It shows that stablecoins crossed the chasm from just collateral for traders or a settlement tool between traders and exchanges to being a part of people's ordinary financials lives outside of the crypto space. So I'd begun to notice this, but I wanted more data to confirm it and the data doesn't exist. Right. And you guys are pretty data driven too. I'm always looking for data to help me inform. Okay, what country should I be targeting for startups? Right.
00:41:10.529 - 00:41:23.145, Speaker B: And the chain analysis data is very good. The geography of crypto. I think they've published it five years in a row. That's exceptional. They actually just published their 2024 one. I love that. That's like my super bowl whenever that comes out.
00:41:23.145 - 00:42:03.125, Speaker B: But that only just tells you country A has high crypto penetration. Doesn't tell you anything more granular than that. So because I had this question and no one was answering it for me, as in what are people doing with stablecoins? What are the use cases? We had anecdotal data, we have anecdata. Right. We have a bunch of port codes that do remittance, cross border, digital dollarization, super apps that are based on stables. But we didn't have decent data on what are people actually doing in stables. I set out to solve this for myself.
00:42:03.125 - 00:42:25.541, Speaker B: Brevin Peter Johnson came along for the journey with us. He's in my opinion one of the best stablecoin VCs out there. Long time stablecoin bull visa helped us with the study. They are incredibly adamant about how important stables are, which is fascinating. And we did a survey. We actually did a survey. Right.
00:42:25.541 - 00:43:15.055, Speaker B: So we were moving away from the on chain data. We wanted to go ask these people specifically what they're doing of five countries, five sort of middle income, large, highly adopted nations from a crypto perspective, they're all in the top 15 of the chain analysis index. India, Brazil, Nigeria, Turkey and Indonesia, which I guess right next door to where we are. We already knew that those were places with like decent levels of adoption. We did 25 individuals overall across the whole sample to be clear, this is not a general population survey because that would have required that we poll 10 times as many people to get the same amount of data because stablecoin penetration might only be 10% in a given nation. So we went specifically to people that were acknowledged existing crypto users. So just be aware of the sample bias there, of course.
00:43:15.055 - 00:44:17.725, Speaker B: And we asked them, what do you do with stablecoins? Are you doing crypto stuff? Are you doing other stuff? What kinds of transactions are you doing? Are you using it as a savings instrument? Is it a cross border payroll remittance? What, what stablecoins are you using? What's your favorability? How frequently do you use it? What percentage of your portfolio is in stablecoins? What blockchains do you use? What wallets do you use? Everything you could possibly want to know. And we published the results I think last week or two weeks ago. I gave a little keynote on it at the token conference here and I thought it was pretty revealing. I think we actually created some pretty novel data sets which give us more insight into what's going on with stablecoins. And I do think it validated our core hypothesis that there is some non crypto thing going on with stablecoins. And even beyond that I think we have evidence of crypto dollarization is what I call it. You guys obviously know what dollarization is.
00:44:17.725 - 00:44:30.631, Speaker B: This is. I'm appending crypto to that very self explanatory term. I think we see an episode of crypto dollarization happening in Nigeria specifically. So yeah, it was a fascinating survey and I'm really glad it's out.
00:44:30.823 - 00:44:33.355, Speaker C: What are some of the results that surprise you?
00:44:33.775 - 00:44:52.915, Speaker B: There's a lot, there's a lot. Unsurprisingly, Tether was kind of the number one most popular stablecoin. We know that. I actually thought Tron would be the most popular blockchain. As it turns out, people liked Ethereum the best. Believe it or not, in order of popularity usage, it was Ethereum, bsc, Tron, Solana.
00:44:53.295 - 00:44:54.135, Speaker A: Why Tron?
00:44:54.175 - 00:44:56.535, Speaker C: And this is based on the on chain data or the surveys?
00:44:56.575 - 00:45:02.223, Speaker B: This is the survey data. The 25 people on the on chain data side, Tron is still the number one.
00:45:02.319 - 00:45:15.303, Speaker A: Why Tron? Like, I mean obviously we have our own intuitions as to why Tron has an uptick in stablecoin usage, but did you see any data to prove why Tron has even top three is very high.
00:45:15.399 - 00:45:30.833, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean and it's always funny, you know, westerners like how dare you use Justin Sun's blockchain like but it's just like it's what they want to use in emerging markets. I don't know, it's one of those big lingering questions. Maybe you guys know the answer?
00:45:30.929 - 00:45:34.377, Speaker C: I think I have a pretty good answer. I think it's.
00:45:34.481 - 00:45:35.969, Speaker B: I think it's something to do with Binance.
00:45:36.057 - 00:45:36.713, Speaker C: Binance?
00:45:36.849 - 00:45:41.361, Speaker B: Yeah. So was it like you had free withdrawals to Tron or something from Binance?
00:45:41.433 - 00:45:49.477, Speaker C: Binance just happened to support Tron usdt. Tronusd was the first stablecoin that Binance supported back in the day because at.
00:45:49.501 - 00:45:52.189, Speaker A: One point they didn't support any stablecoins. Right?
00:45:52.317 - 00:45:53.101, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:53.293 - 00:46:00.725, Speaker C: And Binance was effectively the fiat on off ramp to Tron usdt. So Tron USDT has the first mover advantage.
00:46:00.845 - 00:46:26.655, Speaker B: So I thought it was some Binance thing. I think Binance King made them and then people just stuck in their ways. They don't want to change. It's scary enough to use a crypto wallet. You don't want to have 10 different wallets and write down all your different key phrases and you know, put them in the closet. So the other interesting data point on that is we asked everybody what wallets they use, what non custodial wallets they use. Do you guys want to guess what the number one was?
00:46:26.815 - 00:46:27.223, Speaker A: Trust.
00:46:27.279 - 00:46:27.991, Speaker C: Trust wallet.
00:46:28.103 - 00:46:31.887, Speaker B: That's number two. Number one is Binance Exchange.
00:46:32.071 - 00:46:32.599, Speaker A: Wow.
00:46:32.687 - 00:46:34.423, Speaker C: Wait, but you said non.
00:46:34.599 - 00:46:47.483, Speaker B: Yeah, but we gave people the option to, you know, basically say what kind of wallet using. People use Binance Exchange as the wallet. They don't actually have a non custodial wallet so they use Binance as a digital dollar bank.
00:46:47.659 - 00:46:49.203, Speaker C: That doesn't surprise me at all.
00:46:49.339 - 00:47:05.403, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean it just shows the ubiquity of Binance and it shows how they're able to king make Tron. Yeah, so that was very interesting. Mostly my hypotheses were validated as opposed to me being surprised by the findings. I was surprised that Nigeria was head and shoulders above every other country.
00:47:05.499 - 00:47:06.235, Speaker A: Just talking about this.
00:47:06.275 - 00:47:13.091, Speaker C: It's so consistent with what we see. Like the best founders in Africa, they're universally coming from Nigeria.
00:47:13.123 - 00:47:14.563, Speaker A: Cobank list is one. Right?
00:47:14.659 - 00:47:16.435, Speaker C: I don't know the other one.
00:47:16.475 - 00:47:17.667, Speaker A: Oh yeah, accrue.
00:47:17.731 - 00:48:03.709, Speaker B: I do have like kind of a guess at why that is, which is I then so for my keynote I went beyond the survey and I wanted to understand the macro drivers of stablecoin adoption. I think Nigeria is a perfect storm because it's a young entrepreneurial population. There is a large amount of cross border trade, there's a big export Industry, oil and gas, tech for sure. There are a lot of sophisticated tech workers that are working for foreign firms in Nigeria and there is a long history of inflation in the Naira. The property rights and the institutional trust is low. And so all those things I think add up. And also the financial system is poorly integrated into the rest of the world.
00:48:03.709 - 00:48:43.807, Speaker B: The average cost of remittances in Nigeria is pretty high because the further you are from the financial hub of London or New York, the more expensive remittances are because it's just like if you want to go from Nigeria to the Philippines, it might be a five hop process to go back to New York and then all the way over here. It's not direct. So I think all those things together combine to create and there's high smartphone penetration, things like that. It combines to create this perfect storm. The interesting thing is India is I think the number one most adopted according to Chainalysis but they had much lower and they're consistently scoring top but they had much lower stablecoin penetration.
00:48:43.951 - 00:48:46.575, Speaker A: I can explain why. Well one, because I have found me there too.
00:48:46.655 - 00:48:48.675, Speaker B: Okay, tell me, I'd love to know.
00:48:49.215 - 00:49:18.337, Speaker A: Well, they have something called the UPI and it's essentially like a financial stack infrastructure that enables anyone to on ramp rupees and send and receive money very easily. It's like essentially digital rupee similar like WeChat. Right. But the stack any merchant anyone can integrate and it'll essentially aggregate all your bank accounts and it makes it easy for anyone send and receive money. So it's like think of Zelle but it's like Zelle everywhere.
00:49:18.481 - 00:50:12.287, Speaker B: It's always fascinating me when nations that we don't think of as like the wealthiest nations in the world have more sophisticated financial systems than America. Like Brazil is another example with pics like they have a great payment system and America has no equivalent whatsoever of like FedNow is not really ubiquitous like a real time payment system. It always cracks me up. So yeah, this is one that was actually one of the things that surprised me in the study. I thought India would score top but Nigeria across every single question in the study, whether it's frequency of usage, how much people like favorability ratings, portfolio penetration, the share of individuals that are doing interesting non crypto stuff, the share of individuals that are using stablecoins for savings. Nigeria was top on every single metric. And it kind of made me think how the Nigerian government is harassing the crypto space.
00:50:12.287 - 00:50:23.857, Speaker B: They have cut off bank access to crypto exchanges which I think they turned back on but for a while they cut it off. They wrongfully imprisoned Binance executive Tigran Gamborian.
00:50:23.921 - 00:50:24.753, Speaker A: He's still there, right?
00:50:24.809 - 00:50:48.371, Speaker B: Still detained and basically holding him hostage. Extract a ransom from Binance. This all kind of now makes a little bit more sense to me. Like I thought initially they were being kind of irrational and sort of like scapegoating crypto for the Naira inflation. I don't think crypto is that responsible for it. But I also kind of get it now because there's some kind of dollarization happening.
00:50:48.403 - 00:51:09.451, Speaker A: They had a protest too. I don't know if you saw this a couple months ago where people were, they organized a protest in front of one of the government facilities. They got everyone downloading phantom wallet and they're talking about why they should custody their own assets, like why they should take ownership of their own assets. I saw that as a news article. I thought that was very interesting too.
00:51:09.523 - 00:51:19.783, Speaker B: You know, in the study, actually one of the, Maybe the number one thing that stood out to me was among Nigerians, 39% of them surveyed had used phantom wallet. Wow, that's insanely high.
00:51:19.839 - 00:51:20.635, Speaker A: That's high.
00:51:21.255 - 00:51:50.611, Speaker B: So other interesting findings. So the number one thing that people surveyed do with stablecoins is still get access to crypto, which makes sense. The people we polled are all crypto users. Kind of makes sense. The number one, the number two thing just behind that at 47% is saving in dollars. So I thought maybe cross border or remittance would be higher. But actually it was just about using stablecoins as a dollar digital dollar alternative as effectively a crypto bank account.
00:51:50.611 - 00:52:12.347, Speaker B: It differed based on countries. So in Nigeria saving in dollars was ahead of trading crypto. In Turkey the number one goal for stablecoin users was yield provision. I haven't fully understood why Turkey specifically was so focused on yield. Yield meaning earning like a real interest, you know, positive interest rate with stablecoins.
00:52:12.411 - 00:52:14.459, Speaker C: From AAVE compound or from like.
00:52:14.547 - 00:52:43.079, Speaker B: Well, they didn' specify but it could be a natively interest bearing stablecoin that pays the T bill rate. Could be something like Athena. It could be taking a stable coin, putting it into defi. Point is I think you know, crypto gives people access to high quality yields that, you know, they don't have access to money market funds otherwise. So for some reason the number one thing Turks surveyed wanted to do with stablecoins was earn a yield. Interesting. So I thought that was pretty fascinating.
00:52:43.079 - 00:53:07.029, Speaker B: And then we did see strong evidence for payroll use cases and corporate cash management. Not overwhelming yet. I think it's still new remittance and cross border. But we did see evidence of this. So it basically confirmed what I thought. Stablecoins aren't just a collateral for crypto trading. I don't have to tell you guys this.
00:53:07.029 - 00:53:22.675, Speaker B: You see the data. But part of the reason I did the study is put folks in Washington, you talk to them about stablecoins, they're like, oh, it's just nonsense. It's just crypto. No. 1, it's just for crypto trading, like, oh, $10 trillion a year, whatever. That's crypto trading. That's not true anymore.
00:53:22.675 - 00:53:28.135, Speaker B: And we sort of finally have some pieces of data to prove the alternative.
00:53:28.675 - 00:53:54.995, Speaker C: What I learned is that also very consistent with your report that the different countries use stablecoins for different reasons. In India, people actually like, we learned this from the founders that we work with that build stablecoin apps in India. But in India, their primary use case is to get on stablecoin and then buy crypto in defi. So Indians like to speculate on.
00:53:55.495 - 00:53:56.471, Speaker A: They love speculating.
00:53:56.543 - 00:54:00.575, Speaker B: Yeah. And that's what you see if you look at the data and the report.
00:54:00.615 - 00:54:05.551, Speaker C: And then Nigeria is savings and payment. So very consistent with your findings.
00:54:05.663 - 00:54:34.971, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm glad that you agree, but yeah. So now I've begun to try and develop a framework for different causes for stablecoin adoption. And I think there's two big ones. One is poor financial system integration. So a financial system that's just not very well developed where the cost for remittance is high, where the correspondent banking system doesn't work very well. Maybe there is dollar banking, but there's huge capital controls, which is the case in Nigeria. For instance.
00:54:34.971 - 00:55:01.909, Speaker B: You can get a dollar bank account, but there's capital controls. So a dollar bank account is a dollar liability, but it's not as good a quality dollar asset as a stablecoin. Right. Because a stablecoin is unencumbered and frankly it's a more credible claim on some underlying reserves than a dollar liability in a Nigerian bank. Right. Same with Turkey actually as well. I think there is dollar banking in Turkey, but I don't know if I would trust a Turkish bank.
00:55:01.909 - 00:55:34.755, Speaker B: Right, sure. So there's, that's one reason why people use stablecoins. The other one is kind of like the inflation story. So obviously I don't have to explain that. So those are kind of the two big ones. But yeah, I'm trying to go further now and better understand and not see countries in the emerging markets adopting stablecoins as a monolith but to understand the unique reasons why stablecoins are popular, but it does speak to how multifaceted this stuff is. There's just so many different reasons you might want a stablecoin.
00:55:35.175 - 00:56:09.941, Speaker A: What's also interesting, you mentioned Pixie, right from Brazil. It turns out that there's such a threat. This is what I'm hearing with startups that we've invested in both Brazil, Colombia and other parts of South America is the fact that banks are running to provide support for stablecoins for users just so that they can keep those. The users are leaving their banks to go to Pixie. And so there's a startup we call Cravada that's offering on and off ramps. Now they're doing this in Colombia as well because they're seeing what's happened in Brazil and they want to kind of like future proof themselves before they start to lose business.
00:56:10.093 - 00:56:48.421, Speaker B: Speaking of Brazil, actually coinshare said an interesting report about stablecoin adoption there which I think people really slept on this report and Brazil, the tax authorities asks individuals and businesses about their stablecoin transactions interest here. So it's like a very interesting data set. You have to go to the Brazilian tax website to get the data and they have a data stream showing tether transactions in Brazil on a monthly basis and it's just like up and to the right. So I'm always looking for like interesting real world sources of data that confirm the thesis that one was a fascinating one was Brazilian tax data.
00:56:48.573 - 00:56:54.105, Speaker C: Do we know where the assets that underlies USDT are?
00:56:56.165 - 00:56:59.865, Speaker A: Whatever happened to Bitfinex? Twitter handle Bitfinex.
00:57:01.725 - 00:57:26.657, Speaker B: I mean, I think. Well, so like what's the, what's the investment bank? Howard Lutnick that they are a service provider to tether. Why am I forgetting? Can't trip. It's Gerald they manage a large part of it. I think ultimately the Treasuries are actually probably in the US somewhere. But it.
00:57:26.721 - 00:57:28.645, Speaker C: Why don't they make it more transparent?
00:57:29.055 - 00:57:38.543, Speaker B: I don't think they need to. I don't think they feel the competitive pressure to do that. Maybe if their market share was declining they would. But it's going the other way.
00:57:38.639 - 00:57:42.911, Speaker A: They're earning what, 6 billion a year more than BlackRock. That's insane.
00:57:42.983 - 00:57:44.095, Speaker C: With 100 employees.
00:57:44.215 - 00:57:46.543, Speaker B: Although rates just came down.
00:57:46.639 - 00:57:47.175, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:57:47.215 - 00:57:47.783, Speaker C: Jay Powell.
00:57:47.839 - 00:57:58.675, Speaker B: But interestingly as rates come down, balance sheets increase, in my opinion. And so I think tether supply will grow faster as rates fall, but that won't fully offset the loss of.
00:57:59.585 - 00:58:01.169, Speaker A: They're still in a very Good position.
00:58:01.337 - 00:58:03.045, Speaker B: I mean, it's an amazing business.
00:58:03.985 - 00:58:22.485, Speaker C: I was on a grab with Singapore here and was asking the driver, what stablecoin do you trust? And he said usdt. And I asked why? Why USDT versus usdc? He said, because everyone else uses usdt. You couldn't give a more compelling reason except for the fact that it's the consensus.
00:58:22.865 - 00:58:45.603, Speaker B: We have a section on this in our study. So this was actually one of the things I was most curious about was why does everybody like Tether? Right? Because, you know, if you read the Wall Street Journal, tether is the worst thing in the world. And there was exactly that. It was network effects. And we actually got arbitrary response. So we let people fill in, in their own language because remember, we didn't do the survey in English. We translated.
00:58:45.603 - 00:59:07.465, Speaker B: It didn't. And that was why it was so expensive. You know how many languages are in Nigeria? So we let people fill in and then we use like AI to translate. And it was all. The broker that I use just offers Tether. The guy that introduced me to crypto recommended Tether. Tether is what everyone in my network uses Tether's most liquid.
00:59:07.465 - 00:59:27.663, Speaker B: So nobody cares about what the Wall Street Journal has to say about Tether. They couldn't care less. They just care about making their lives better. And Tether is the most abundantly available tool. And they're not like doing a sophisticated analysis of the balance sheet quality and the reserve composition. Right. It's just ubiquitous.
00:59:27.663 - 00:59:30.095, Speaker B: And the network effect is so, so powerful.
00:59:30.215 - 00:59:45.807, Speaker A: There was a. I mean, I don't know how true this is in the data, but we've talked to some founders and founders prefer USDT over usdc. We're talking founders outside of the US is because how closely aligned USDC is with the regulators in the U.S. yeah.
00:59:45.831 - 01:00:22.361, Speaker B: You know what's funny though is you guys probably know this Tether freezes more aggressively than uscc, which is actually, it's a very interesting thing, like your freezing policy, because you could be a little more interventionist like Tether, where if you know the Tether guys and you get hacked, you can ask them to reverse it and they'll do it. USCC actually really doesn't like doing that. So they want their system to be maybe more credibly neutral. Tether wants it to be. They want to be able to remediate issues as they show up. Two different strategies, I think. I don't know where it's going to go, but I find it very interesting the difference between the two.
01:00:22.361 - 01:00:49.185, Speaker B: But you know, Tether does listen to law enforcement when they come calling. Right. In fact, quite actively, like they're freezing like $100 million tranches when they identify that it's a pig butchering scam in the Philippines or something. So I don't know, maybe it's kind of like a meme that tether is somehow remote from the US government. I just don't think they are. You know, if they never listened to the courts or law enforcement, they would not be allowed to exist.
01:00:49.225 - 01:01:34.791, Speaker A: Yeah. In your report you Talked about how 18 to 24 year olds are highly adopting stablecoins and stablecoins in other parts of the world. Is that one of the reasons why we're seeing high activity in stablecoins outside of all the, all the areas that you mentioned? Like for us, at least in the US A lot of the new apps that we're building, be it like, I don't know, Moonshot or Pump or Live Bet or any of these other apps, when we look at the breakdown of the web traffic, a lot of the web traffic is 18 to 24 year olds. So I'm curious to see, I mean, is this like a new phenomena where it's actually the new, the younger crowd that's driving the adoption for crypto globally?
01:01:34.943 - 01:01:47.225, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think age really matters because you just don't have any hang ups and you're not entrenched in your patterns of using financial tools. Like, you know, I've never used a check before. Have you guys written a check?
01:01:48.405 - 01:01:51.105, Speaker A: I'm such a boomer. Yeah.
01:01:51.805 - 01:02:07.927, Speaker B: I don't even know how to write a check. I don't know what it is. I don't understand how it clears. It seems very insecure. Seems very insecure to me. Like I think there's a lot of check fraud as far as I'm aware. So I just think like if you're young, you dominate preconditions as to how finance should work.
01:02:07.927 - 01:02:33.711, Speaker B: So you're much more willing to trust a new system like this. But you know what I saw in the data? Feel free to come through the report and tell me the opposite. I actually thought it was very flat across the age bands, which surprised me. I thought it would be way more the youth. And then in the over 40 bracket, no one would be using it. But I was actually really impressed at how flat it was across the age bands.
01:02:33.783 - 01:02:35.063, Speaker A: So it's consistent across.
01:02:35.159 - 01:02:41.967, Speaker C: It's a sign that it's solving a real economic problem rather than providing a novel consumer behavior to the young people.
01:02:42.071 - 01:02:43.647, Speaker B: Yeah. So I was actually Kind of happy.
01:02:43.671 - 01:02:55.129, Speaker A: With that, finding cross border payments. I don't think we've talked a bit about that. Where are you seeing the highest activity between different countries? Yeah, I'm curious on.
01:02:55.247 - 01:03:11.733, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean so I think the global average remittance cost is 7%. I think stablecoins are going to push that down to 2% over the next decade. So I think to be tremendously disruptive what we're also seeing. So for instance, we're investors in a startup called Felix Pago. They do us to Mexico and we.
01:03:11.749 - 01:03:13.545, Speaker A: Talked to them all. Very strong team.
01:03:13.845 - 01:03:38.503, Speaker B: I mean the numbers are just blowing my socks off to be honest. Like I've never seen anything like it. And that's actually not just a crypto story. It's also they just have a better UI. Like they have a chat bot on WhatsApp and yeah, it has AI of course and people just like using the chatbot and it's easy and it's great. Of course they bring down the cost by using stablecoins instead of course wanted banks but the users are not exposed to the stablecoin which is great. Right.
01:03:38.503 - 01:04:13.791, Speaker B: So I think the remittance story that's very well understood, you know, this big remittance corridors like US Philippines, US Mexico, you know, certain African countries in Europe. What's maybe more interesting? So I think it's very clear as to why using stablecoins in remittance is better. And as more banks come in and start intermediating FX stablecoin transactions which we are seeing, that eliminates the biggest source of cost which is the last mile because people forget about that part. You have first mile, intermediate step and last mile.
01:04:13.823 - 01:04:15.047, Speaker A: You mean on and off ramps, right?
01:04:15.071 - 01:04:43.781, Speaker B: Yeah. So last mile is typically the costliest because you're going from a dollar stablecoin generally to the Turkish lira, Nigeria, the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, whatever. That's the most expensive thing by far. You have to find a local off ramp, whether it's an exchange or some FX desk or something. That cost is generally compressing. But that has been the biggest hindrance. So I'm excited to see what happens there.
01:04:43.781 - 01:05:08.405, Speaker B: But what I find most interesting is maybe small and medium sized businesses that are doing import export that have nothing to do with crypto. These are like ordinary businesses and it's not necessarily the largest businesses in the world because they have access to sophisticated tools and currency hedging and whatever, but it's small and mid sized businesses that are oil and gas exporters in Nigeria or something.
01:05:08.565 - 01:05:11.497, Speaker C: I was going to mention the anecdote, I learned it from our founder.
01:05:11.661 - 01:05:39.695, Speaker B: I think there's like, I think this is like a kind of ubiquitous thing. I've heard it from a few startups now, that's just one example. But it's like places where maybe they don't trust the local bank system, but certainly latency is an issue with cross border payments. You're talking T plus maybe 5 settlement for a international bank wire with Swift where like you have no legibility for that transaction. So it's like you send the bank wire and like maybe it shows up a week later. Right. It's like terrifying.
01:05:39.695 - 01:05:41.191, Speaker B: You're like sending money to the void.
01:05:41.263 - 01:06:03.833, Speaker A: And the funny thing I heard about this specific. So I have a friend that does like, you know, a ton of cross border payments. I specifically went import export and he said that sometimes like local customs will just hold your packages for a very long time and charge you storage fees that are like in the hundreds of thousands. And so stablecoins can solve that as well because you could validate the payment and then release the packages.
01:06:03.999 - 01:06:08.517, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean so it changes the nature of settlement. Right. Because like traditional payments is messaging and settlement.
01:06:08.581 - 01:06:09.245, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:06:09.405 - 01:06:31.025, Speaker B: And the settlement can just be delayed. Like we've sent bank wire, like we now we mostly settle deals and stable coins. At Castle island we've sent bank wires that have just like disappeared for like weeks on end. And it's like then the bank has to do all this like forensic accounting to figure out what happened to the bank wire. It's horrible. It changed. It unites messaging and settlement, creates an atomic instantaneous transaction.
01:06:31.025 - 01:07:11.445, Speaker B: It ameliorates things in terms of cash management. Latency is also expensive because there's opportunity costs with yield. For instance, if you're holding your core balance sheet and Treasuries, latency is a cost there. It's more legible. The thing is, not everybody's comfortable accepting a stablecoin as a medium of payment. So we do still need these businesses to intermediate the last mile. I think it starts to look very interesting when stablecoins become widely accepted currency money equivalent and you don't have to keep on and off ramping into fiat, which is the most expensive thing.
01:07:11.445 - 01:07:33.085, Speaker B: But yeah, that's actually the most interesting thing to me is medium and small businesses adopting stablecoins because they're far more credible, they're faster, obviously cheaper and it eliminates this political risk around using the banking system. That's like kind of, to me that's the most interesting. That's where I'm focused on Finding the next startup.
01:07:33.125 - 01:07:56.545, Speaker C: I have another anecdote is gold mining companies in Colombia. So there's a huge supply chain of the gold mining companies buy the mines from each other and so on. But because these companies tend to be multinational, because gold mines are all around the world, basically settle their payments with each other in USDT in Colombia.
01:07:56.965 - 01:08:37.919, Speaker B: I mean, I feel like we're on the. I feel like we're at an inflection point right here. And I felt like this about crypto in like 2020 and in 2017 I felt like it was and I couldn't really explain why. And I feel the same with stablecoins today. And I think there's going to be an absolute burst when we cross this key chasm. When the infrastructure gets good enough and it's not quite good enough, I think you still have to use these arcane processes to use wallets. And once you're able to abstract that away, which we're very close to doing, once FX liquidity gets slightly better, I think the supply stable is going to balloon to 500 billion.
01:08:37.919 - 01:08:56.881, Speaker B: It's going to become completely ordinary to have your corporate balance sheet in stablecoins. Cost of minutes is going to come down. Globally, the world has become so much smaller because payments are going to be so much more efficient. So that's why we're leaning into this and doubling down. And that's why, frankly, I want to be the first name in stablecoins from the venture perspective.
01:08:56.993 - 01:08:58.965, Speaker A: When I think about stablecoins, I think about you.
01:09:00.825 - 01:09:02.085, Speaker B: That's so sweet.
01:09:02.705 - 01:09:09.801, Speaker A: You've been talking about this since 2017. 18. I think I felt like you've been talking about crypto dollars.
01:09:09.993 - 01:09:26.976, Speaker B: But my conviction's been growing. The first thing that gave me conviction was I saw that in 2020 to the crypto dollar white paper, I saw that 40% of blockchain volume was stable coins. Since then, it actually touched like 70, 80%. So like 70, 80% of all value settled on blockchains was stable coins.
01:09:27.120 - 01:09:37.520, Speaker C: I'm actually curious, the on chain settlement of stablecoins, what percentage of it do you think is trading related? Like crypto trading related versus payment and so on?
01:09:37.552 - 01:09:39.192, Speaker B: It's very hard to so this.
01:09:39.248 - 01:09:40.524, Speaker C: What's your best estimate?
01:09:40.835 - 01:10:02.275, Speaker B: Oh my gosh. I'm sure it's much more trading than it is payments. People ask me this. I don't have the best answer. We did so much work for this study. Like 50% of all the work for this study was actually this one chart which was on chain value settled, which is the Hardest thing ever. Because there's so many sources of noise on the blockchain.
01:10:02.275 - 01:10:36.511, Speaker B: As you guys know, mev bots introduce a huge amount of noise. Yeah, because they'll do $100 million transaction, earn $10,000. So you have to identify that and characterize that and be like, no, this is a $10,000 transaction, not 100 million. The way exchanges do, you just move funds around internally that they look like a mixer. So we did a ton of work credit to Allium and Artemis and also the Visa team for developing this methodology. So we characterized half of all the transactions. We were able to identify who they were and then did this denoising the other half.
01:10:36.511 - 01:11:08.413, Speaker B: We used a more heuristics based approach. So if we see a wallet behaving in a very spammy way, we impose thresholds on that wallet and eliminate a ton of that. So that's how we got to the $5 trillion estimate, which I think is actually a much more reliable, conservative and reasonable and sort of defensible estimate. Because crypto people have this habit of like looking at the numbers on chain, adding them up nominally and be like, bitcoin is on Track to settle $8,000,000,000 this year or whatever. It's like, well, like if we want people to take us seriously, we have to be able to defend the numbers.
01:11:08.469 - 01:11:09.125, Speaker A: Agreed.
01:11:09.285 - 01:11:22.997, Speaker B: So that's why we put so much work into this. Actually, Visa has a new dashboard called like visaonchainanalytics.com, which is very cool. Like Visa has a stablecoin dashboard. That's awesome. Where they took our new methodology and put it into effect so you can find it there.
01:11:23.181 - 01:12:01.175, Speaker A: So isn't this great for the us? Like, how do we see like. I'm trying to like extend, you know, if you look at the macro, you see like, I don't know. I don't know how much of this is a meme, but like brics, you know, you have Saudi and all of these others that are kind of leaving the US dollar and using other currencies to trade. Petroleum as an example. And so you see this narrative where like Russia, China and others are moving away from the US dollar as a settlement and then moving towards a different currency. But then you have this like, bottoms up, you know, dollarization of the US dollar. Like how do you see all this?
01:12:01.335 - 01:12:16.955, Speaker B: I think the short answer is yes and long answer is yes. But it's complicated, so it depends which one you want. I wrote this piece on medium that Nobody read called Five Perspective on stablecoins. It's like 8,000 words. I get it. It's fine. It's boring.
01:12:16.955 - 01:12:38.695, Speaker B: Where I pondered this exact question like okay, it seems trivially true that stablecoin adoption, which is 99% dollars by the way. 99. And that number has gone up, that hasn't gone down. Like nobody wants the euro. There's no other FX issue. Well, and it's also to do with currency strength. Like the dollar has typically the highest real rates.
01:12:38.695 - 01:13:02.379, Speaker B: Like we have a robust economy so we can have high interest rates whilst not nuking the economy and we have lower inflation. So high real rates. I think that's just gonna, that macro thing is just gonna continue to drive strength in dollar stablecoins. But really it's more the network effects. Right. And there's no other FX with more than 100 million in issued stablecoins aside from the euro. So there's just nothing out there.
01:13:02.379 - 01:13:18.827, Speaker B: And like, I don't even see how that would change. So yes, 99% dollars blockchains are all about stablecoins. That means blockchains are all about dollars. Everybody knows that. Even people in Washington understand that. But it's not necessarily good. It's like it kind of depends who in the US you're saying it's good for.
01:13:18.827 - 01:13:47.285, Speaker B: So there was a very interesting op ed in Brookings by this guy, Timothy Massad, who was, I think Obama's. He worked for Obama at the CFTC and he wrote this great piece. He's coming from the left. They're not typically the allies of crypto. But he understood the value of stablecoins. He compared them to Eurodollars, which many people have done. And he said he was concerned ultimately about sanctions enforcement.
01:13:47.285 - 01:14:26.163, Speaker B: And that's really a matter of opinion whether you think that we've gone too far on sanctions. I personally think we have. And because we went so far on sanctions, it became a blunt instrument and we undermined our own sanctions regime by overusing it. And now there's like this troika of Iran, China and India that are de dollarizing their, you know, commodity trade. I mean the Russia war really accelerated this too. So I do think there's de dollarization internationally. So you know, that trend is kind of playing out on its own.
01:14:26.163 - 01:14:53.535, Speaker B: So. But if you really lionize sanctions enforcement, you may not like stablecoins. So from the US perspective, because stablecoins are less accountable. It's true. And the privacy model of stablecoins is what I call permission pseudonymity, which means the creation and redemption of the stablecoin is known. You're known to the issuer that's KYC'ed. But then the on chain P2P transactions are not really that surveillable inherently.
01:14:53.535 - 01:15:21.159, Speaker B: Maybe you can do some on chain forensic stuff but that's like the privacy model of physical cash. Right. Like if you go to the bank and you make a huge deposit or you go to the ATM and you withdraw cash, you're kind of known to the bank. But then when you go and do the cash transaction you're not telling FinCEN that you gave the valet $20. Right. So permission, pseudonymity. I think it's great but the regulators may not like it.
01:15:21.159 - 01:15:49.489, Speaker B: Ultimately I often say if cash was invented today it would be illegal. So this is going to be put to the test with stablecoins. Stablecoins are the reinvention of cash. Will it be made illegal? We'll see. I hope that the it's the blacklist model that works right now that prevails. If we go to the whitelist model stablecoins don't work anymore. So from the sanctions perspective you could make the argument that it's not good for the US But I actually don't agree with that.
01:15:49.489 - 01:16:46.045, Speaker B: You can make that argument. I don't agree with it because I do think that these stablecoin issuers can be made accountable to the US all we have to do is pass some reasonable rules here, not here but in the US get the issuers to re domicile, encourage the issuance of domestic stablecoins as opposed to crypto Eurodollars like tether and render them more accountable. Congress has been unwilling to do that. I think they're shooting themselves in the foot because they're willingly consigning power over to other regulators. Whereas stablecoins are shoot out of. So they're losing power to the Singapore's, the Hong Kong, The Dubai, the UAE, the Bermudas, the EU's of the world where they are allowing for the issuance of stablecoins. So I think it's a huge own goal that the US government is committing because if you want to gain influence over this new sector, allow them to issue in the US but they have been reticent to do that.
01:16:46.045 - 01:17:21.755, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean the short answer is obviously I think stablecoins are generally good for US interests and they're also just good for global finance, they're good for global growth. They allow these countries that are poorly integrated into the financial system to participate in finance. I think of stablecoins as Starlink for finance. Starlink brought the Internet to billions of people. Stablecoins bring the dollar to billions of people. That's enormously good for just the thriving of humanity. That allows these people to participate in the global economy and save their savings in something that's secure.
01:17:21.755 - 01:17:30.355, Speaker B: Just from a welfare, like an aggregate welfare perspective, I think stablecoins are enormously good. If you care about that, I think you should be supportive.
01:17:30.735 - 01:17:35.595, Speaker A: What products or startups have you not seen that you'd like to see using stablecoins?
01:17:36.295 - 01:18:01.809, Speaker B: Man. I got a Wishlist, the most exciting product demo I saw here in Singapore, which blew my mind. The Opera browser minipay integration built on CeeLo of all things. Have you guys seen this? No. It completely blew my socks off actually. And I was looking at the data, I'm like, Silo has a ton of stablecoin transactions. What's going on? Who's using this? I thought it was fake.
01:18:01.809 - 01:18:08.193, Speaker B: I'm like, oh, this is some like Celo incentive. They're like paying people to use stablecoins. It's not fake, it's real shit.
01:18:08.249 - 01:18:09.377, Speaker C: It's Nigeria.
01:18:09.561 - 01:18:37.683, Speaker B: Yeah. So Opera is an Internet browser that I don't use and there's like a lightweight version of it where it's, you know, very data efficient. But it's very popular in, on Android phones in places like Africa. And they built they for a long time they've liked crypto, but they built this specifically stablecoin payments module called Many Pay, I think. And the whole thing's built on Silo. So it doesn't use addresses, it uses their like phone number.
01:18:37.779 - 01:18:38.195, Speaker A: Phone number.
01:18:38.235 - 01:19:02.045, Speaker B: Okay. As the, you know, authentication thing. And it's totally frictionless. There's fee abstraction so you don't have to use some other third party crypto asset to pay fees, which is the craziest thing that crypto people ever came up with. So there's fee abstraction. These transactions are fast. They just turn it on in five countries in Africa and it's growing like a weed.
01:19:02.505 - 01:19:03.305, Speaker A: We're talking.
01:19:03.425 - 01:19:09.109, Speaker C: I know this because Accrue is the official provider of an offer end provider for Opera.
01:19:09.257 - 01:19:09.757, Speaker B: Really.
01:19:09.861 - 01:19:11.621, Speaker A: CeeLo, we're talking the L2, right.
01:19:11.733 - 01:19:20.293, Speaker B: CeeLo is like, used to be a layer one layer one, but now they're L2. Yeah. Because I remember when silo was like L1 and they were an L1, they had their own stablecoin.
01:19:20.349 - 01:19:20.877, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:19:21.021 - 01:19:46.715, Speaker B: And the whole thing was really complex. Didn't make sense to me. Seven years later, this is going to take over the African continent and they're onboarded with all of the M Pesas like the yellow cards, like the Fiat off and on ramp. That demo was actually the most impressive demo. Shout out to Rene and I, you know, I can't even invest in Opera. I guess they're like a public company. Maybe I can, maybe I'll just, you know, market by the public stock.
01:19:46.715 - 01:19:52.831, Speaker B: But I just, I saw this and I knew that it was going to be the number one.
01:19:52.983 - 01:19:56.191, Speaker C: The demo was good because the UX is really good.
01:19:56.303 - 01:19:56.527, Speaker A: Just.
01:19:56.551 - 01:20:21.221, Speaker B: Yeah. Everything about it was incredibly polished and thoughtful and fit for purpose for the specific demographic. Lightweight Android, a browser that already has hundreds of millions of users, maybe over a billion. So the distribution is there. There's this. You know, that doesn't really answer the question because you asked me what I want to see. This was something I wasn't expecting to see, that I did see.
01:20:21.221 - 01:20:28.021, Speaker B: It's deployed now, but I just want to like get that on record that it's. This thing's going to win. Nice founders.
01:20:28.053 - 01:20:29.745, Speaker A: If you're looking for a copy pasta.
01:20:31.365 - 01:21:14.117, Speaker B: So what I want to see is a better stablecoin clearinghouse. I know there's like a few companies that are trying to do this. Like we're investors in Red Envelope for instance. Bridge is maybe doing this, you know, but. Right, yeah. So what we need is a way to go across blockchains, across stablecoins on the same blockchain and from Fiat to stables globally against all the effects and create one gigantic clearinghouse for foreign affects to dollars to stables and then within the stablecoin crypto space, within those block cross blockchains. Yeah, that would be game changing.
01:21:14.181 - 01:21:19.869, Speaker C: That feels like, for me, that also feels like the biggest missing piece right now. But it's extremely, extremely hard to build.
01:21:19.957 - 01:21:29.867, Speaker B: I think it's expensive. So what I think you actually need is for JPM to throw a huge amount of balance sheet at this because you're basically talking about a huge FX trading operation.
01:21:29.931 - 01:21:30.635, Speaker C: Exactly.
01:21:30.795 - 01:21:35.483, Speaker B: And so I think you do need a large established player. Maybe not even a startup jump should.
01:21:35.499 - 01:21:36.459, Speaker C: Be doing this actually.
01:21:36.547 - 01:21:49.415, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that would dramatically improve cost at every step in the process of the full life cycle of a stablecoin transaction. That's what I want.
01:21:50.395 - 01:21:51.295, Speaker C: Agreed.
01:21:52.045 - 01:21:53.941, Speaker A: Cool. Any final thoughts?
01:21:54.133 - 01:22:07.437, Speaker B: No. I mean, my keynote's gonna be live. I think the video. I thought I did a good job. You know what's actually funny is after having done like a boxing match or like an MMA match, doing a keynote is so much less intimidating.
01:22:07.501 - 01:22:08.145, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:22:09.165 - 01:22:11.389, Speaker B: So I felt so relaxed this time.
01:22:11.437 - 01:22:11.885, Speaker A: Nice.
01:22:12.005 - 01:22:48.485, Speaker B: Because I was just thinking about my heart rate was doing like 180 when I was like walking into the ring in Nashville, I guess. And nothing is as bad as that. So watch the keynot and I talk about crypto dollarization. I do think it's happening in Nigeria. And I also developed this model, not a complicated or sophisticated model, very simple model to try and guess at where it's going to happen next. That's what I want people to keep an eye on is instances of crypto dollarization. And I do think stablecoins will, over the next decade eliminate the bottom third of the weakest global fx.
01:22:48.485 - 01:22:52.065, Speaker B: I think that's going to happen. It hasn't happened yet, but I think it will.
01:22:52.185 - 01:22:55.749, Speaker C: Oh, you mean the fiat currencies will die over the next decade?
01:22:55.837 - 01:23:04.045, Speaker B: Yeah, like dollar plus. Stablecoins is the apex predator and it's going to kill off the bottom kind of quartile.
01:23:04.165 - 01:23:05.573, Speaker C: The governments won't like it.
01:23:05.709 - 01:23:26.739, Speaker B: Yeah, but you know, sometimes governments capitulate. Like Ecuador in 2000 they had a popular dollarization. So like in the general population and the government was like, okay, fine. And they dollarized officially. So sometimes you see this and I think stablecoins are going to make it more aggressive and harder to stop. Like in Nigeria, they try to stop it.
01:23:26.787 - 01:23:27.491, Speaker A: They can't.
01:23:27.643 - 01:23:30.455, Speaker B: There's no way. There's no way to stop it.
01:23:30.875 - 01:23:33.755, Speaker A: Well, we'll end on that note.
01:23:33.835 - 01:23:34.787, Speaker B: Yeah. Stay tuned.
