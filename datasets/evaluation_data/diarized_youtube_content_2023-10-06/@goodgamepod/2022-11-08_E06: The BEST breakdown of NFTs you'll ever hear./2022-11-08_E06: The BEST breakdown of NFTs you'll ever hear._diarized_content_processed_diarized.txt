00:00:00.320 - 00:00:36.856, Speaker A: Welcome to Good Game, a podcast for crypto insiders with your host Imran and Chao. Welcome back to episode six with Chao and I, a good game. The last couple weeks, a lot's happened. You probably heard about the sudden rise of art gobblers, which has been in the works for probably for the past six months. And so Chow and I decided to dedicate this episode to nfts. Just generally, what are our thoughts, what we're excited about, and maybe some history lessons before we get started? Anything top of mind for you, Chow?
00:00:36.960 - 00:01:00.064, Speaker B: We have a couple questions from our audience. I really want to touch upon those. One is the difference between the various chains, the various layer ones, in the context of nfts, how are the cultures different between Solana and Ethereum, for example? I also want to talk about your bag of nfT. Our bags.
00:01:00.444 - 00:01:01.464, Speaker A: Our bags.
00:01:02.644 - 00:01:14.292, Speaker B: What are some of the specific collections that we're excited about? Obviously not financial advice, but I think that's gonna be super fun to talk about. But, yeah, let's do it.
00:01:14.428 - 00:01:41.258, Speaker A: Great. I think we should go back in time, back in 2017, when you and I were just trying to figure out what was happening. EIP 721 was introduced by this guy named Dieter Shirley and three other folks that proposed it. The idea was supposed to be just simple, you know, create a standard interface for non fungible tokens, aka, they called it deeds at the time.
00:01:41.346 - 00:01:45.362, Speaker B: Dieter is the CTO of cryptokitties. Right?
00:01:45.458 - 00:02:05.070, Speaker A: Oh, you're right. He is. That actually makes a lot of sense. You're right. Good call out. And what was interesting was while, like, that was being proposed and launched in parallel to this, cryptokitties launched as well. Do you remember that?
00:02:05.102 - 00:02:05.670, Speaker B: Yep.
00:02:05.822 - 00:02:43.970, Speaker A: And if you guys don't know what cryptokitties is, the idea is pretty simple, similar to axie Infinity, where you're breeding, creating, buying digital cats. And it's more of a kind of gamification method where you're having fun just, you know, creating different types of cats. And it turns out in 2017, there's this, like, craze around cryptokitties, where volume peaked at about $2 million in one day for. For cryptokitties. And guess how much percentage of the Ethereum transactions it took?
00:02:44.082 - 00:02:47.656, Speaker B: I think you bloated the entire chain. Right? The cryptokitties.
00:02:47.720 - 00:03:22.488, Speaker A: It did. Almost 12% of all of ethereum transactions were cryptokitties. And then it suddenly died right away. So it was this, like, huge peak. Like, it, like, went through this, like, hyperbolic growth, and then it just, like, crashed to me, what it showed was what could NFTs become, right. You always see these like, lightning in the bottom moments where there's a sudden growth and then just like craters. And I think that's one of the reasons why I started to become more intrigued about nfts was because of that incident.
00:03:22.536 - 00:03:53.332, Speaker B: I remember us v invested in dapper labs back in the day. By the way, when I say theater, Shirley's is the CTO of cryptocurrencies. He's obviously the CTO of dapper Labs who build flow dapper labs. I remember us being invested in dapper labs back in the day, like 2017. 2018. And people were like, yep. Why? Why did they invest in a freaking cats game on chain Cats game? Obviously they all missed the point, but.
00:03:53.388 - 00:03:54.260, Speaker A: They got a lot of shit for it.
00:03:54.292 - 00:04:09.280, Speaker B: Exactly. And the NFTs were actually, NFTs games were actually the most obvious gold market for any layer one. That's why they invested in Dapper Labs, who eventually built the flow, the flow blockchain.
00:04:09.412 - 00:04:19.560, Speaker A: I saw no other use cases for NFTs back then except for games. Like, I was reading through my old articles that I published back then around 2018, and I only talked about games.
00:04:19.672 - 00:04:20.208, Speaker B: Same thing.
00:04:20.256 - 00:04:21.600, Speaker A: I never saw anything else.
00:04:21.672 - 00:04:33.256, Speaker B: I thought of nfts as collectibles. I did not think of NFTs as digital identity, which, by the way, five years later today is the main thing behind apes and punks.
00:04:33.360 - 00:05:20.092, Speaker A: Yep. What was cool about it was as I was reading EIP 721, there was like a list of startups that were working on this concept. Some of the ones that I'll point out that you probably knows, like cryptokitties, cryptopunks, rare, Pepe's, Decentraland are like the ones that, like, were the main ones. And there's like a whole host of others that aren't there anymore. Like they failed or they don't exist anymore. But what was also interesting was while all of this was happening, you have EIP 721, you have these like, cohort of startups that are trying to build like NFT standards or infrastructure around it. Then you have like Opensea that just went through white combinator and they were building the first marketplace for nfts at the time.
00:05:20.188 - 00:05:28.924, Speaker B: I think Opensea had at least three competitors that I know of back in the day. None of them managed to survive till.
00:05:28.964 - 00:05:31.204, Speaker A: The end of pivoting.
00:05:31.244 - 00:05:32.724, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:05:32.804 - 00:05:51.708, Speaker A: Because the, the volume was so low on opensea for so long that people didn't have enough persistence or courage to continue building, and they ended up pivoting to other ideas that may have not worked out. But that's the history, right? That's where it all kind of started.
00:05:51.836 - 00:06:02.870, Speaker B: By the way, there were nfts before Ethereum. There were nfts on bitcoin. I don't know the exact history there, but I vaguely remember there were attempts.
00:06:03.062 - 00:07:12.304, Speaker A: There was an attempt, yeah, I'll have to look more into it, but there was an attempt around it, but didn't really quite take off. So from 27 to 2020, we've seen this like huge, like, push for nfts. We're seeing ecosystems being built out, incredible companies, etcetera, which I'll touch on before I touch on, like, what's, what's happened since then. I say we go over high level of, like, what's happening on all the layer ones just to get a good understanding of what each layer one is, what it does, and what types of nfts are coming out of those ecosystems. I found maybe probably six or seven layer ones that I think are at least interesting for us to talk about, especially because I see so much of it on Twitter and, you know, we have to put some facts around. It turns out all time volume for Ethereum NFTs has been roughly 30 billion, which, which is probably true. And a lot of it's driven by cryptopunks, autoglyphs, rare pepes.
00:07:12.304 - 00:07:59.122, Speaker A: And what I've seen with Ethereum community, unlike any other community, is that a lot of builders that are coming into the space from the NFT perspective are pure like missionary builders, right? They care about open source, they care about building the right community, and they use that as a lever to kind of build their own community and attract the right people. Second in volume is Ronin Axie Infinity. They've done over about $4 billion in total NFT volume. And the idea, everyone knows, is pretty simple. You buy mint trade breed axies. It's part of the game. And that's the only NFT action that's happening is purely around Xie Solana.
00:07:59.122 - 00:08:19.710, Speaker A: It comes at 2.7 billion total sales volume. So primarily, the way I've seen it was that it's primarily retail and speculators. So like, unlike Ethereum, where you do have some retail and speculators, but I consider Ethereum more. The quality of the art is like, for collectors, like genuine.
00:08:19.742 - 00:08:22.198, Speaker B: More collectors than speculators.
00:08:22.246 - 00:08:22.994, Speaker A: That's right.
00:08:23.574 - 00:08:34.594, Speaker B: I heard the same thing about Solana, which is, you know, the opposite of Ethereum. More. More speculators, more volume on the new mints rather than existing collections.
00:08:35.414 - 00:08:36.030, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:36.142 - 00:08:40.754, Speaker B: So that's interesting. I'm really surprised that axie is number two. Ronan is number two.
00:08:41.494 - 00:08:43.351, Speaker A: Yeah, I was surprised too.
00:08:43.477 - 00:08:51.459, Speaker B: Could it be that some of the NFT collections are not like, where'd you get the data? Because indexing the nfts is really tough.
00:08:51.571 - 00:09:28.394, Speaker A: Cryptoslam IO, which has data on all the chains. But what's interesting about Solana is, I mean, I've bought some nfts on Solana and I'm down bad on many of them. Specifically, I bought, like, Solana monkey business because it's one of the first genuine communities, but Dejun apes is another one. But those two, I feel like, are forks or derivatives of bored apes. So they have a pretty good community. But I don't think it's as genuine as, you know, the bored apes community or the cryptopunks community.
00:09:28.434 - 00:09:29.002, Speaker B: Even between.
00:09:29.098 - 00:09:29.402, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:29.458 - 00:09:32.186, Speaker B: Even between apes and punks. I feel like there's a difference.
00:09:32.290 - 00:09:32.730, Speaker A: Oh, absolutely.
00:09:32.762 - 00:09:39.254, Speaker B: I feel like the punks are a lot more genuine, authentic missionary. But I might be biased.
00:09:39.894 - 00:10:08.720, Speaker A: No, you're right. Fortunately, unfortunately, you go labs acquired cryptopunks, which I'll talk a bit more about, but 100% agreed with that thesis. But I will say this, though. Although Solana is primarily a speculative chain for trading NFT assets, I found that there is one community that resembles a lot like the bored apes community, or probably, I don't know about cryptopunks, but bored apes for sure. It's called d gods or Ute's.
00:10:08.752 - 00:10:09.248, Speaker B: Yep.
00:10:09.376 - 00:10:55.088, Speaker A: Have you heard of those guys? Yeah, I went through, like, how they launched and they were very community focused. They had some like, glitches in the beginning where they accidentally didn't rug their users, but had a glitch where they, some of the users lost on the mint. But over time they redeemed themselves. They were at one point they were going to shut the project down, which was pretty interesting, but they ended up building this community, and now they're probably one of the most valued communities on Solana. They have their own token, they have their own marketplace, and most recently, which I'll touch on later, is like they went zero royalties as well. So there's something happening at Solana. I think it's more time is needed for other genuine communities to be built around it.
00:10:55.088 - 00:11:08.614, Speaker A: Avalanche had about 400 million total NFT volume sales, primarily dominated by games. No, like, you know, there's some speculative stuff happening, but it's primarily like games or farming of games.
00:11:08.954 - 00:11:09.778, Speaker B: Which one?
00:11:09.906 - 00:11:57.362, Speaker A: The top three crabada, which we heard about in the bull market, yield hunt hunters and chicken. Chicken's probably the most recent one. That's like, if you look at the past 30 or 60 days, the most volume right now is on chicken. And chicken is essentially a farmable game where you take your chicken, you stake your chicken, and then you get egg tokens. But yeah, I don't know of the quality of the games, etcetera. But there's the top three. Most volume, like, highest volume NFT collections are all games on avalanche Polygon at 400 million.
00:11:57.362 - 00:12:34.280, Speaker A: Primarily gaming, too. So you have Zed run, if you remember Zed run, it's like racing horses, crypto unicorns, same thing. You have to breed unicorns, buy land, cultivate the land, feed the unicorns. But most recently it was Reddit. And Reddit, as you know, had about $10 million in total trading volume or sales volume, only 1010. Yeah. And then finally, I only bring this up because I hear it from a lot of, like, collectors about Tezos.
00:12:34.280 - 00:12:54.054, Speaker A: But Tezos has some sort of like, niche community of generative art. It's a marketplace called effects hash has about $20 million of volume. Total has about 50 million. So not much, but I only bring it up because there is like a small group of collectors that admire the art there.
00:12:54.134 - 00:12:58.022, Speaker B: So speaking of Tezos, like, we never spoke about Tezos, but I don't think.
00:12:58.038 - 00:12:59.486, Speaker A: We'Ve ever spoken about Tezos since they launched.
00:12:59.510 - 00:13:17.436, Speaker B: That's right. But Tezos seems to have a really interesting, at least special go to market because I watch soccer, I watch european soccer and my team is Manchester United and they have Tezos, the Tezos logo on their jersey this, this season.
00:13:17.620 - 00:13:18.204, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:13:18.244 - 00:13:35.732, Speaker B: And I thought, I was like, I was like, why did they pick Tezos? Like, tezos must be spending a lot of money to get into like the retail mind share. I was really surprised by that. But yeah, I'm not surprised that Tezos has their own niche of NFT collectors.
00:13:35.908 - 00:13:44.472, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm actually really curious what's happening on Tezos, to be honest. I remember the ICO and since then I haven't heard much.
00:13:44.528 - 00:14:01.496, Speaker B: Their whole thing about NFTs was that they were environment friendly because back then ethereum was still on proof of work and they used the ESG as their initial go to market.
00:14:01.680 - 00:14:14.288, Speaker A: Got it. So those are high level of the layer ones. And what's happening in those ecosystems. There's one more. Sorry, I forgot. Flow. Flow had 1.1
00:14:14.288 - 00:14:21.656, Speaker A: billion in total trading volume or sales volume. It's primarily driven by NBA top shots and NFL top shots.
00:14:21.720 - 00:14:25.096, Speaker B: Are this still active or was it just a flash.
00:14:25.240 - 00:14:38.900, Speaker A: It's still active? No, no, they're still active. Volume has dramatically gone down since, like the bull market, but people are still buying and selling nfts on those two platforms.
00:14:39.092 - 00:14:53.308, Speaker B: I find it interesting that you said you got burned in the Solana nfts. I looked at bored apes and punks, they barely moved in pricing ETH. They've been pretty stable over the past.
00:14:53.356 - 00:15:17.384, Speaker A: Year or so, and that's reflective of the communities behind it. I think if you want a missionary community, then you'll have a certain group of people that will just never sell and you'll have some that want to really get into that community and will slowly accumulate those nfts. We've seen this with crypto punks and bored apes over and over and over again over the past, just past twelve months.
00:15:17.424 - 00:15:24.964, Speaker B: And it's analogous to bitcoin Ethereum. Like every bear market, bitcoin Ethereum are the ones that are down the least.
00:15:25.744 - 00:15:42.094, Speaker A: Yep. And so, yeah, that could be, you know, those could be the blue chips, which I would agree with. And so that's what's happening. If you think about nfts today, what breakout NFT do you think attributed to all of what's happening today?
00:15:42.254 - 00:15:43.594, Speaker B: It's got to be punks.
00:15:44.334 - 00:15:58.772, Speaker A: Yep, it's punks. And so I was like, researching punks and, you know, there's some interesting history behind, like, generative art generally. Did you know that generative art was started about 50 years ago?
00:15:58.918 - 00:16:01.896, Speaker B: Okay, what was it, what was it? Back then?
00:16:01.960 - 00:17:01.484, Speaker A: Yeah. So the concept was to introduce randomness into art is this guy named Herbert Frank. Around early fifties, he used an oscilloscope, which is essentially a way to analyze waveforms of electronic signals. And he would use it, and then he would take a moving camera and take a picture of it, and then he would create randomness between the moving of the camera and then the wavelength that would move on the oscilloscope. And that was like the starting of what would be known as generative art. Over the years, programming languages evolved and people started becoming more accustomed to programming using like, Fortran and Basic, and they started to create, you know, like starting the early foundation of generative art based on that, by introducing randomness. And that happened throughout the sixties, seventies.
00:17:01.484 - 00:17:42.281, Speaker A: And then in 2017, two guys started larva labs, and they launched what would be known as cryptopunks. The aesthetics is supposed to remind us of, like, the early seventies punks. And they introduced an algorithm. So every time you would claim an NFT, the algorithm would generate, will pull together different traits through randomness and pull together this NFT that would become the NFT that you claim. When you claim the NFT, it was free. There was no minting cost, completely free, and you just had to pay gas fees. That was really the start of cryptopunks as it is today.
00:17:42.377 - 00:17:45.556, Speaker B: So many similarities with bitcoin, right?
00:17:45.700 - 00:17:47.084, Speaker A: So many. So many.
00:17:47.124 - 00:18:23.946, Speaker B: Punk is the bitcoin of nfts. This conception where basically a fair launch, there was no whitelist or anything like that, nothing, anyone can participate completely free. It was not an ICO, not a public sale. Even Ethereum does not fall under that category. Ethereum did an ICO, but bitcoin was the one where you can just participate permissionlessly. And it was the OG. It was like, basically, I mean, it's probably not the first NFT collection, but it's the one that really stood the test of time.
00:18:24.090 - 00:18:53.012, Speaker A: Yep. So this with the launch of crypto punks, and in fact, it took, I think, months before all of it was claimed. So there's still like, you know, the claiming process for crypto punks is ongoing for a very long time. And so that kind of showed that the people didn't really catch on to what was happening in the space. In fact, I found out about it much later, like 2019. So it took me a year, year and a half.
00:18:53.188 - 00:18:58.876, Speaker B: I certainly didn't hear about punks in 2017. It was all cryptokitties back then.
00:18:58.980 - 00:19:38.274, Speaker A: Yeah. But it brought together this core group of generative artists because people, generative art of artists, knew what was happening. And in particular, it brought in this guy named Snowfro. And Snowfro is a mexican generative artist. He was part of the original cryptopunks community, probably holds about 60, 70 cryptopunks to this day. And his idea was, you know, could we create an algorithm and output, and the output of the algorithm all on chain. And November 20, 20th, he launched a first marketplace for generic called art blocks.
00:19:38.274 - 00:20:17.244, Speaker A: And in parallel to that, he launched his own collection, which was called Chromie Squiggles. Hence why Chromie Squiggles is on a run most recently. Right. It went from, I don't know, like five e to like 15, or now it's on around 13 ETH. I bought one of those when it first, like, not first came out, but a couple months. But I only bought it because I had no clue what was going on and everybody was fomoing. I started appreciating Jordan art probably later on, but back then it was just more on the FOMO.
00:20:17.244 - 00:20:30.894, Speaker A: So that's the history between, like, you know, how our blocks got started and cryptopunk start got started. And the question I always ask myself is, like, what makes generative art valuable? Like, what do you think about generative art?
00:20:31.434 - 00:21:01.414, Speaker B: I don't get art. I don't get art as, as nfts. I'm not a, I don't have the collector gene that you do. I have, yeah, a lot of my friends who were in NFT early did have that collector gene. The only NFts I really hold myself is, is punks and apes. But the way I view punks and apes, I don't view punks as generative art. I view punks as really this digital identity, digitally native identity.
00:21:01.414 - 00:21:55.560, Speaker B: And the way I can explain this is the ultimate bull case for something like punks, is this idea of digital nations. And you probably are, you probably all heard of this network state's idea that biology has been pushing, but it's fundamentally the same idea you have. Holders of the punks NFT that eventually become the citizens of this new digital nation. And what they can do is they have treasury. Potentially. NalSdao is probably the most, is probably the, the epitome of this idea. But the NFT holders would hold, or they basically have on chain ownership of the treasury.
00:21:55.560 - 00:22:48.170, Speaker B: They can vote how the treasury should be used. They can potentially make investments into various projects, build stuff for their community, but eventually even buy stuff in the physical world to really establish this idea of digital nation. This is the ultimate bulkies for pfps, like PFP, generative art or whatever. This whole idea of digital identity. Sometimes I feel like NFTs are more like Daos than Daos are. Most Daos we know of today, they have a fungible token, URc 20, as their core way to share ownership and to distribute power, voting power. But I view NFTs even more as Daos than the current Daos are, because they offer something extra, which is the identity, the NFT.
00:22:48.170 - 00:23:19.846, Speaker B: They're unique. Unlike fungible tokens, by definition, they're not unique. They're fungible with each other. And so this identity creates a sense of belonging to this digital nation. You really feel like you're, um, a part of it, and you can express yourself to the outside world. And then sometimes people, people say like, you know, Daos are like corporations. Actually, I think Daos are way more than corporations.
00:23:19.846 - 00:24:06.294, Speaker B: Like, the fundamental difference between Daos and corporations is that when a corporation owns some assets, do they really own the assets? Like, who guarantees the property rights? It's the broader legal system, right. Their ownership of those assets is guaranteed by the social consensus of an entire country. Whereas if you're a dow and you own some assets, you truly own those assets on chain, you actually have full ownership. Your property rights are not ultimately guaranteed by an entire country. Your property rights are fully on chain. They're guaranteed by the consensus of the chain itself. So the key difference between those and corporations is property rights.
00:24:06.294 - 00:24:20.330, Speaker B: And with property rights, truly native property rights, you can build digital nations. So that's how I think about this whole analog or concept behind pfts as digital nations.
00:24:20.442 - 00:25:36.554, Speaker A: The idea makes a lot of sense. In regards to pfps becoming digital nations, the question is always, what is the process of getting there? And I've seen many communities that have launched quickly where they didn't have the right transition path to doing that, and they ultimately failed. And so that's like one way to think about it. The other way to think about it is like, what is bored apes doing with their strategy of building this, like, digital nation? And maybe we're going to touch on this later, but high level, the way you think about bored apes is they're building this digital nation, and it's going to be, it's going to live in the metaverse. And so you have a group of collectors that bought into the NFT, and over time, they want to manifest each of these digital identities into a world where everyone can communicate and coordinate, play games, etcetera. And so that's like the way that bored apes is thinking about, or Yuga Labs is thinking about it. And I don't think any one community has figured out what this digital nation strategy would look like in the long run.
00:25:36.554 - 00:26:32.088, Speaker A: But it's quite interesting to see how people are carving out the path so that they can get to this kind of end point. I do know that, like, when you look at the PFP communities, generally, people are all bounded by a single identity, like single meta identity, right? Like, I am bounded by where my family is from in India, right? And so when I go back there, everyone talks the same, they eat the same, etcetera. Now, you have this on the Internet, and the identity that's governing this new group of people is under the ethos of, like, the bored apes or the cryptopunks, and they all have different ways to communicate and talk and different rights, whatever. But it's interesting to see some of these properties develop on the Internet.
00:26:32.176 - 00:26:53.634, Speaker B: Yeah. So, I mean, this whole idea of sense of belonging to a digital nation is by far my number one long term bull thesis for any type of nfts, but I want to talk about other nfts with you as well. What are some of the other types of interesting types of nfts that you've seen?
00:26:54.014 - 00:27:24.972, Speaker A: Yeah. So we touched on like profile picture nfts, which is kind of where maybe cryptopunks started. And then bored apes launched. It was founded by four guys, Greg Wiley, Zeeshawn and Kareem, and they launched it around February or April 23. Mint price was $240 or 0.0 ETH. They raised 450 million at $4 billion valuation by ASICs and Z and many others.
00:27:24.972 - 00:28:17.524, Speaker A: They launched their ape token, which is currently sitting at around 4.7 billion. They used some of that capital to acquire the beloved cryptopunks and meebits IP from larva Labs. There's this big contention, if you, I don't know if you remember, between like larva labs and cryptopunks holders where the licensing was held by larva Labs. And so the, each individual NFT holder didn't have the rights to their cryptopunk and it created a lot of contention. And so that was like one element. And then you see, you know, other NFTs launching, where they would either launch as a CC zero project, which I'll explain what that is in a bit, and, or, you know, they'll give some rights to the, of the IP, to the individual holders.
00:28:17.524 - 00:28:46.840, Speaker A: And so Yugalabs ended up acquiring cryptopunks and Mibit and then they gave full commercial rights to the holders, but they won't transfer the full copyright to the holders, just they got, they have some commercial rights around it. And so cryptopunks and Mebitz community, they were pretty happy about that, about that piece. I don't know if they're excited about Ugalabs being the parent company behind cryptopunks, but that's just the idea around crypto punks.
00:28:46.992 - 00:29:16.424, Speaker B: I saw an interesting project recently that, where the punk or some of the NFT holders, I can't remember if it was punks or apes, but they're able to license their, the actual JPEG associated with their nft to like brands like Nike or, you know, other fashion brands where they can print the actual JPEG onto the sneakers or shirts or whatever.
00:29:16.504 - 00:29:17.444, Speaker A: Oh, that's cool.
00:29:17.824 - 00:29:43.414, Speaker B: So I thought that was really interesting because that told me that those NFT holders actually had some really interesting commercial rights that they can monetize. They have extra ways to monetize the nfts that they hold, not just like flipping the nfts but they can actually generate some yield on it. So that's where the commercial rights, who actually owns the commercial rights matters?
00:29:43.534 - 00:30:29.914, Speaker A: It does. If you look at IP today, all the IP is held by large corporations or media companies. In order for any end user to take advantage of that, the only way they could do that is by buying the products at the end of the day. But now, if you become a semi owner of the IP, these ips could become more durable in the long run. I could see this becoming similar to like Disney, right, where Disney has this very durable, century wide like brand. I could see, you know, these NFTs becoming like multi generational similar in that sense. So we've heard a lot of, we've heard about CC zero licensing Creative Commons.
00:30:29.914 - 00:32:23.094, Speaker A: What is it actually like? If I want to purchase an NFT, what rights do I get? What rights do other holders of other collections get? We can start off with the basics, right? If you know CC zero, it's part of the crypto Creative Commons licenses framework, where they bring up, there's like six or seven different sub licenses within that framework that ultimately govern how the content on the Internet lives and who could use it and what they can use it for. It was introduced around the time when web two was just starting to take off, or the Internet was just starting to take off and people were using songs and they were remixing them, or they were taking other people's blogs or content and using it for their own distribution or for their own content. And so there's this framework in place now that controls who owns the content and how this content could be given away to others at no cost, so that it could become public domain as an example. So the crux of this conversation is going to be around cc zero, because this is where NFTs could become public domain, meaning that anyone can use it, and it's like a public good. And so what we're hearing a lot about is nfts that use this standard or this framework as a way to kind of grow and increase the adoption. There are a couple early projects, I believe it was toads and a couple others, that launched using the CC Zero model. And the idea was very simple, is that if we allow it for public goods, and everyone would use it, including brands, and brands would want to incorporate this as a way to increase the overall value of that community in itself.
00:32:23.094 - 00:32:27.906, Speaker A: That was a basic thesis. I haven't seen anything take off yet based on that concept.
00:32:27.930 - 00:32:33.928, Speaker B: So when brands use those nfts as public goods, they don't have to pay anything to the holders.
00:32:34.016 - 00:32:35.584, Speaker A: They don't. That's right.
00:32:35.624 - 00:32:36.564, Speaker B: Very interesting.
00:32:37.304 - 00:33:01.506, Speaker A: Yeah, and we'll talk more about it. But nouns Dao is under that concept for CC Zero. And you saw that on Super bowl, right? There was a commercial and you saw the nouns glasses in one of the videos. I forgot what they were promoting, but it was a commercial and they used the nouns IP as a way to launches commercial during the Super bowl.
00:33:01.650 - 00:33:48.116, Speaker B: Yeah, I can see that happen when you, when you just let people permissionlessly use your ip, there's all sorts of interesting content can happen, and ultimately that's going to drive more attention to your ip, to your brand. Yeah. And ultimately will increase the value of your nfts. So I can totally see that happen. So it's the exact opposite of the example that I gave before, where the NFT holders sell their licenses to, or not sell their licenses, but they sell the right to use their nfts to brands like Nike to print those jpegs onto the sneakers. So it's a different way to monetize.
00:33:48.260 - 00:34:45.202, Speaker A: And I guess just going down the monetization route and we'll talk more about nouns now and what I call the youth system because I think, or it's called the y system, which offers a new dynamic in regards to how to manage IP. But monetization generally has been primarily around minting royalties. You see merchandise being sold, there's like in real life events, but those are probably the most used monetization strategies for NFT communities and then launching a token. And so those are like the five or six that I've seen that are common in terms of monetization. I don't know if I'm sold on any of them, to be quite frank. It just seems like it means to the end, just to solve this, like, problem. I think royalties, like the ones who can really dictate or ask for royalties are the ones that have been, that have created incredible art.
00:34:45.202 - 00:35:51.000, Speaker A: Like if you look at like Tyler Hobbs, Fidenzas or ringers or cryptopunks, bored apes, they can demand their own royalties because people will gladly pay for the art and keep it. But where I don't see royalties working is for art. Art or projects that haven't had the same level of success, but are also demanding fees so that they can monetize in their own way. The reason why I say this is because I think the first has been explored. There are blue chips that have won the space of either generative art or pfps. Now, I think the pressure should be more about what can you do in those spaces and innovate? Interestingly enough, we're starting to see more and more innovation that's happening because of that, as in the bear market, margins get compressed. And as margins get compressed, people are going to find ways to make it cheaper, easier, faster, to get more users on their platforms.
00:35:51.000 - 00:36:52.904, Speaker A: And so you started seeing this happen, especially on Solana, where you have a zero fee marketplace that opened up. What it ultimately ended up doing was it circumvented royalties from their user or that would have gone to the creator and completely made it to zero. So creators have now earned no nfts that would go on or royalties on that platform, whatever volume that's traded on that platform. And so then it forces these creators to think about what can we build or what should we build so that I can start to earn revenue. Obviously, they make a bulk of their cash upfront by minting fees, but ongoing. It really puts the pressure on what types of products these NFT communities should be building. I don't know if you have any thoughts around that, but some really cool examples I can give you of what projects are doing to circumvent that is like the Azuki community.
00:36:52.904 - 00:37:34.394, Speaker A: So the Azuki community has built out this loyalty platform. You can go on this website. So as long as you have this NFT, you can log in. It gives you cool stats. You're able to connect with other community members within the Azuki tribe and it starts to build this like connectivity between members. And I think that's probably the right route because as you mentioned, if NFTs aren't going to become these digital nation, then these digital nations need to talk and build some sort of bond that has a the ads to feel or sense of community. I don't think discord is the right way to do that.
00:37:34.394 - 00:37:53.222, Speaker A: Because in discord, especially when you leave your discord open, you get a lot of spam and misinformation and other things that will really deter the community. In fact, nouns now just decided to shut their discord down as well. So that kind of gives you the idea.
00:37:53.418 - 00:38:32.584, Speaker B: So speaking of Azuki and Discord, I've been thinking about this a little bit. So, like you and I have seen like so many, like NFT social, you know, apps, like chat apps or messaging apps, NFT gated, whatever. So there's so many of them, it's unbelievable. But yeah, I feel like they're all making the same mistake in a sense that you provide a generic messaging app for every single NFT communities. But I feel like, the NFT communities want their own white label solution. They all have their own identity. They all want to express their own preferences.
00:38:32.584 - 00:39:21.262, Speaker B: I feel like the right approach is not to build a discord for NFT communities, but rather providing an API SDK or something that's very customizable for each community to build on top of. Like you can go on to like a Zookee website or punk's website and then you start chatting there rather than chatting like within discord or a separate messaging app. Right. But anyway, I think there's a lot of opportunity for founders building white labeled solution for devs from NFT communities. So messaging is one. But there's also like, NFT marketplaces. One of the problems with, let's say, magic Eden or Opensea is they're too generic.
00:39:21.262 - 00:39:46.246, Speaker B: And on top of that, they charge a fee to every single one. Like every time you make any transaction, you pay a fee to opensea rather than the fee going back to the NFT community itself. So you don't capture as much value as if you had your own white label solution. Yeah, but anyway, point being, I think NFT communities want their own thing, especially the bigger ones. The bigger communities, yep.
00:39:46.390 - 00:40:33.474, Speaker A: They want their own marketplace. They want their own messaging app. They want formally a way to connect in like real life events. So you're going to start to see the, at least where I see this all going is these communities are just going to spin out of like, spin out and become its, like its own, like, cultural movement. And all of the products, all of what's being built will be built in house as a way to retain ownership, as a way to extract value for the community, and all in the guise of building and growing the community at large. This reminds me a lot of like, nouns Dao model. And the Nounsdao model is probably one of the most interesting communities in the space today.
00:40:33.474 - 00:41:43.818, Speaker A: Nouns out you could think of is semi generative art. It's generative art, right? So every day, the concept of Nouns Dao is every day there's a mint, people bid on it. And once you are the final winner of the project of the mint for the day you purchase it for, let's say, 58, the 58th would get transferred to the treasury. And collectively, all the people that hold the nouns dao, NFT can manage the treasury together. I think it's sitting at like 40, $50 million in ETH today. I was an early nounsdao buyer, top 30, and the idea resonated with me, at least, because the concept of being able to manage and vote on that treasury could, in the long run, become very powerful, especially for a brand like nouns Dao, just because of the way it was started, and using the premise of CC Zero as a way to extend that brand to other ecosystems. I mean, like, if you really think about it, you could use that treasury to buy a gaming studio.
00:41:43.818 - 00:42:47.268, Speaker A: I'm not saying that that could happen, but why couldn't it happen, right? And infuse that gaming studio with its ip and branding and create, you know, killer games. And so that money that's just sitting and just growing over time will become the largest cofactor for people that want to be a part of that community. Even if you go down to, like, nouns doll forums, like, there's hundreds of posts, hundreds of posts of people that just want access to that capital so that they could do something with it, whether it's a founder that's just building some sort of app that can bring something to the Nounsdale community to like events where there's like, you know, let's say, New York Fashion Week, let's create an event so we can attract designers to our community, stuff like that. And so you're starting to see, like, open source, like, methodologies around money and capital as a way to grow, you know, their own businesses or ideas, which I think is quite a new concept.
00:42:47.356 - 00:43:23.922, Speaker B: I'm really excited about those NFT projects that try to become digital nations. And by that, I mean they have a very strong identity. Everyone wants to be part of it. A lot of people want to be part of it, and they have a treasury that they collectively own and manage. Announced that out of all the NFT products I've seen so far, it's probably fits those criteria the best. So I think that's going to be a big theme in the next five to ten years, even for us. Alliance Doll.
00:43:23.922 - 00:43:50.074, Speaker B: Ultimately, we're going to become a digital nation. And same idea behind NasdaO. We want to build a community that a lot of people want to join, want to be part of, and have a treasury to manage. Right. I want to keep a close eye on this particular vertical of digital nations. Are there any other ones that you feel have the potential to become a digital nation?
00:43:50.114 - 00:44:02.734, Speaker A: So far you have the blue, the blue chips. Right? So artifacts, which is clone, xukis, nouns, punks, apes.
00:44:03.034 - 00:44:32.204, Speaker B: I think one of the key criteria to becoming a digital nation is how well the community is governed. How do you feel about the governance model between, you know, nouns or punks or Azuki so far? Do you see any similarity, anything that they're doing well or not well. Like, I went on, I went on nouns now, like forums or I've looked at how they govern things and make proposals. I feel like it's still very messy.
00:44:33.464 - 00:44:34.216, Speaker A: It's very messy.
00:44:34.240 - 00:44:34.872, Speaker B: It's very active.
00:44:34.928 - 00:44:35.792, Speaker A: That's why I paused there.
00:44:35.808 - 00:44:39.568, Speaker B: It's very active, but it's too decentralized for its own good.
00:44:39.736 - 00:45:21.934, Speaker A: It's very messy. And I mean, even bored apes really had no forums until they launched a token. Right? So it was just a bunch of people on discord that were on Twitter and stuff like that. So I think that is like TBD and how that's going to be governed in the right approach. I haven't seen anything that I could say with confidence that is successful on the governance side. But then again, if you think about even in Defi, what projects are governed really well. I mean, there are only a couple that I could name, like Aave Makerdao Compound.
00:45:21.934 - 00:46:18.320, Speaker A: That's about it. But those guys have been building since 2017, right? So anyone that's newer is going to take them a long time to figure out, like who are the right stakeholders? Are they long term, permanent stakeholders? Are they short term stakeholders? How do we invent, incentivize them? Do we give them salary, etcetera? So these communities, I think are like akin to like, I don't know, a meteor crash or big bang of some sort. Like, you need to have the right amount. Well, you know, this is actually an interesting topic. We're going to diverge a bit. But like Wi Fi or yearn, they had that big bang moment and that is exactly what you want, right. You had thousands of people that were so excited about yearn because yearn was like one of the first, like, you know, decentralized yield aggregator that can take capital and use it in ways that other protocols couldn't.
00:46:18.352 - 00:46:36.644, Speaker B: And it was a fairly, it was not, and it was a fairly funded, it was fair launch. There's, you know, a strong, strong leader and building a useful product, at least back in the day.
00:46:37.104 - 00:47:15.636, Speaker A: Yep. And I remember, like, I was a part of it, we were a part of it. And it was, it brought in a lot of talented people. And based on that, I seen how it went from, like nothing to being really well governed over a very short period of time. They had their own struggles, don't get me wrong, but it brought in a lot of intellectual capital to help them form a dao governance that worked really well for yearn. So you got to have that mind share, otherwise you're just going to have a bunch of speculators that want the price to go up. And typically in the NFT communities, that's what that will, that is what will happen.
00:47:15.820 - 00:47:48.532, Speaker B: Imran, I want to talk to you about the other types of nfTs. So we've talked about pfps, generative art. We haven't really touched upon music, nfts, gaming nfTs. I want to talk about the long tail of NFT types and whether or not they actually make sense, because throughout the history of crypto, there have been a lot of attempts to just apply crypto for the sake of applying crypto. And not everything really makes sense. So I'm curious what you think about the long tail.
00:47:48.668 - 00:48:39.788, Speaker A: Yeah, let's talk about, let's start with gaming nfTs. Gaming NFTs took the bulk of the mind sharing in the bull market, especially with axie Infinity. And there's some other sub communities like crypto unicorn and others. And the basic premise is you have to buy two, an example of axie Infinity, you'd have to buy two axies, and you have to use SLP and axie or axs token to breed a new axie. And then you could use this axie as a way to play the game, or you could lend it to people and then they could play the game on your behalf. And you can become like an ambassador that earns a cut, what the player is playing and earning from. You have crypto unicorn.
00:48:39.788 - 00:49:36.398, Speaker A: That's also similar where you buy, you stake your crypto unicorns, you get like, I forgot the token's name, but you get a token in return. Then what you do with this token is, I think it's called uni or milk token. And then what you do is you breed two unicorns, and then you get a smaller, like a baby unicorn. And then you buy land, you cultivate crops and you feed it, and it becomes bigger and you earn more money in the long run, like uni tokens. And then you have something new that's called limit break. That is launched by Gabriel, who is pretty well known in the web, two gaming space that's launched some successful companies. And the idea of free to own model, which essentially an example of this is like, you buy this NFT and this NFT will earn you more nfts in the long run, and that will help you play different games.
00:49:36.398 - 00:50:20.374, Speaker A: And the NFT that you first purchased could become valuable over time because you're getting access to all of this new nfts within the game that will make the game more valuable in terms of experience. So you have some of these. These are like three different models that you're seeing within the gaming side. I don't know where it's going to go, to be quite frank, but I do know one thing which is like, if you look at games today, I can click on an app and play a game. That's it. In most cases, the apps are free, and then there's in game purchases if I want to level up or if I want to win the game faster, or if there's new routes or new skins that I can use for my character. Otherwise the game is free.
00:50:20.374 - 00:50:59.358, Speaker A: So that friction point in playing the game is zero. Whereas with games like unicorns and Axie as an example, you have to buy into the game, which is the hardest part. Yes, the gaming asset you buy could be speculative and could go up in price, but it brings in the wrong type of users, right? You're bringing speculators versus people that are actually playing the game. And so what limit break is doing is, hey, you know, this NFT is free. And then over time, that NFT could become more valuable by airdropping your skins and stuff that will make the game more valuable in the long run. What are your thoughts on that?
00:50:59.406 - 00:51:33.474, Speaker B: I think gaming nfts in general just makes a lot of sense. It's. It was the entire reason why Vitalik started Ethereum. By the way, Vitalik used to play what way? Vital used to play World of Warcraft. And one day he noticed that one of his favorite characters got weakened by Blizzard, the developer of the game. And that's when he realized the danger of centralization. And at least that was his version of the Genesis story of Ethereum.
00:51:33.474 - 00:52:34.524, Speaker B: It makes sense to turn those in game assets in World of Warcraft into nfts that the game developer has no way to really affect. Obviously, it's much harder than that because the game developers can potentially do other things to the nfts. They can change the entire game loop in a way that basically the older nfts become less relevant in the new game loop. But at least that's the hope, that's the promise of turning in game items into nfts that the users truly own. So gaming nfts make sense. As a retail collector investor myself, I wouldn't own gaming nfts for the hoping that they will appreciate over time. I would just hold the PFPs, the digital identity, the digital nations theme type of NFTs.
00:52:34.524 - 00:53:03.432, Speaker B: Potentially those nfts like the punks and apes, they can be incorporated by games, right? Like, you know, potentially the games can build on top of these nfts. Maybe Yuga labs themselves will build. I mean, they have been building games on top of their own nfts, right? So in that sense, the NFT, the in game nfts make sense. But anyway, that's high level thought. What do you think of music nfts?
00:53:03.608 - 00:53:40.852, Speaker A: Yeah, music nfts are interesting. We have a platform called Sound XYz and Sound XYz. What they ultimately do is allow creators to monetize by giving away or minting 30 mints of a certain song that they want to bring to the public. It's a new way to monetize because what's happening in the space, I don't know if you got a chance to watch Spotify's documentary or series about how Spotify got started. It's on Netflix. It's really good. It's called the playlist.
00:53:40.852 - 00:54:12.124, Speaker A: But the idea is very interesting, which is back then, if you remember, music was you had to buy a CD and then you buy the CD, then you can listen to the song. Then the Internet came, it became very popular and you had like Limewire or Pirate Bay, where you could download music for free. Listen to music. Creators didn't get paid. No one got paid. Regulators got really pissed. The large businesses got pissed, and there was no way to govern this or extract value because you can't do that on the Internet.
00:54:12.124 - 00:54:56.724, Speaker A: So Spotify came and said, hey, we're going to create this platform where you can charge. We're going to make it so easy to use that we will charge for convenience. And so ultimately, over time, they bought into that idea. And now Spotify has a very strong grapple. They have a very strong hold on creators today because in terms of monetization, they pay zero point zero, four cents a stream. And that's not a lot. It turns out that a lot of creators are, they're unhappy with the amount they're making from Spotify and they have to rely on licensing deals and other things to make the money that they used to make once they were on CDs.
00:54:56.724 - 00:55:25.684, Speaker A: So that's the pendulum right now. That's the backdrop. So now let's come back to nfts. NFTs could be a great way for musicians to monetize their art, especially like certain types of art. And then they could build a sense of community around this type of art by becoming closer to those fans that do buy these nfTs. Right. You're already starting to see like this direct to consumer models, even when it comes to fans.
00:55:25.684 - 00:55:55.982, Speaker A: Right? Like, with large artists. Like, there's so many artists that are out there that are tweeting or using Instagram as a way to form that, like, direct bond. Kevin Durant, who's like a pretty popular basketball player, created his own discord channel for himself, and he left it open for everyone to join. So you're starting to see this. Two concepts starting to come together, which is how do I build a much closer relationship with my fans? And then two is how do I monetize directly without any middleman.
00:55:56.038 - 00:55:56.694, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:55:56.854 - 00:56:01.614, Speaker A: And then the idea of NFTs become even more powerful. When you think about it from that.
00:56:01.654 - 00:56:39.620, Speaker B: Lens, are there elements of what you said that I agree with? And there are elements. I hold the opposite view. I don't find music nfts that interesting. I think they will be a thing. In the same way that you collect some limited edition albums or CDs of your favorite rapper. I think that will be a thing, but it won't be as big of a game changer as nfts in games, or certainly not pfps as digital nations. I think where the intersection between music and crypto will happen is not nfts.
00:56:39.620 - 00:56:54.740, Speaker B: It's the other point that you mentioned, which is the fan engagement. I don't think that has to do with NFTs music, NFTs per se, but you may have to do with the concept of Daos, this community aspect of crypto. I don't know exactly what it is, but that's my gut feeling.
00:56:54.812 - 00:56:55.844, Speaker A: I would agree with that.
00:56:55.964 - 00:57:15.820, Speaker B: The problem with music NFts is that the audio stuff, unlike the visual stuff, it's very hard to go viral. Right? Like when you, when you buy a punk, you hold a punk, you put that as your PfP on your, on your Twitter profile. It goes viral very quickly. Music is much harder to go viral just because of the format of the file.
00:57:15.972 - 00:57:53.528, Speaker A: Yep, I'd agree with that. So, you know, it could be, you know, special limited edition music where, you know, there are power fans. There's a term for, I think it's called super fans. Super fans, uh, where super fans are very excited and will be, will gladly spend, you know, $100 for that song. And this gives them a sense of community with other super fans, right? That will then give them maybe special access to events. So if, let's say this singer comes, a rapper comes into your town, you get special access to that person, right? Anyone that's Superman would love to pay for that experience.
00:57:53.576 - 00:58:03.232, Speaker B: So it's almost accessible token rather than music. Nft like, you turn the NFT into access token, access to the celebrity itself.
00:58:03.368 - 00:59:01.866, Speaker A: That's right. Now there are conversations I've heard that you could use music as a way to distribute. Like, you give some IP rights. I don't know if I buy that because IP rights for music at least is so contentious, especially watching and reading the history around Spotify, they'll never give up their IP rights. There's just no way, right? Maybe if you're an indie founder, indie musician, and you're like, fuck it. Like, I need to make money and I will give up some of my rights. Otherwise, if, let's say, let's just say that that is true and IP rights will become a thing, then the way I could see this being monetized in the long run is like you have these Daos, the Dows acquire the ip of the music nfts, they become the sole distributor or become like regional distributor of this music, where they earn fees for distributing that music or licensing that music out to other types of collections or movies or whatever.
00:59:01.866 - 00:59:27.356, Speaker A: And then over time, the money that you return from the Dao, you could ultimately become your own production company or your own record company where you start to acquire talent. And then, you know, you become this like pseudo recording distributor Dao that ultimately returns all the fees back to the community holders that own a token in that dao type of thing.
00:59:27.460 - 00:59:39.900, Speaker B: I think I agree with you. The idea of turning music ips into nfts, it's okay, but it doesn't really solve a hair on fire problem.
00:59:40.052 - 01:00:15.134, Speaker A: There's no heron fire problems being solved from this. Oh, but here's a fun, interesting story. Snoop Dogg bought death row records. If you know Death Row records, it's one of the oldest record companies in rap. And Snoop Dogg recently purchased it and he pulled it from Spotify. He pulled it out of Spotify and he said that he's going to create nfts around it, is what he said. So I don't know what that means and how he's gonna do it, but he has dropped music on Sound XYZ before.
01:00:15.214 - 01:00:16.154, Speaker B: Oh, interesting.
01:00:16.814 - 01:00:54.864, Speaker A: Yeah. So I don't know what he's thinking. I've tried to like, do more research, but he was very, like, quiet about what he was thinking about doing with it. So I guess we have to wait and see of what's gonna happen with that. But he did mention, like, money was the biggest reason why he pulled it from Spotify. And this could be the eventual exodus for like large fans or large musicians with large fan base, because they really have leverage. And now that they see a platform where they can monetize, we may see an exodus of musicians leaving Spotify and others to start to directly monetize their own content.
01:00:54.984 - 01:01:29.444, Speaker B: What do you think of story ips? There have been a couple of projects building storytelling. Ips, decentralized storytelling. I don't know exactly how they work, but that's the marketing language. In our last cohort, we had one project called the store protocol that we're also building in this area. Obviously, they're also trying to figure this stuff out. There's still a lot of unknowns, but what do you think of that vertical in general?
01:01:29.824 - 01:01:43.488, Speaker A: Very bullish. At least in South Korea and, like, Southeast Asia, it's very popular to contribute your own, like, to read, like, short stories. Like, short stories.
01:01:43.576 - 01:01:44.684, Speaker B: The webtoons.
01:01:45.424 - 01:02:31.320, Speaker A: The webtoons, k pop. You know, this whole, like, area that the people in the US or Europe or another place are not exposed to, it's actually thriving. And typically, like, whatever happens in, like, those areas is usually a precursor for what's gonna happen for us. Right? Like, even with anime. Like, I'm a big anime fan, but anime has been around since, like, the sixties, seventies, right? And it's just started getting popular in the nineties here in the US and later. So I do think, like, contributing stories or contributing to a story, and then over time, owning that IP as a way to build royalties and reward the user that contributed a story is very powerful.
01:02:31.432 - 01:02:45.566, Speaker B: I think where NFTs and storytelling will cross over is not turning the stories into NFTs, but the characters and items in those stories into NFTs.
01:02:45.720 - 01:02:46.482, Speaker A: Or why not both?
01:02:46.538 - 01:02:46.802, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:02:46.858 - 01:02:47.494, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:02:47.994 - 01:03:20.584, Speaker B: The problem with turning stories into nfts is it has the same problem as music nfts. Like, it's a bunch of text. Yeah, it's hard to go viral. But if you create a really good story about a lot, like, think Marvel, right? Like, if you're able to create a story that billions of people around the world really love, then naturally, if you turn those characters from those stories into nfts, there is a good chance for those nfts for those characters to turn into this digital nation theme.
01:03:21.604 - 01:03:22.476, Speaker A: Yep.
01:03:22.660 - 01:03:36.824, Speaker B: Again, the whole story is about pfps and digital nations, not nfts or turning story ips into nfts or music into nfts, but the characters in the stories.
01:03:37.524 - 01:04:02.896, Speaker A: You know, the common theme I'm hearing is everything is going to become its own, like, nation on the Internet, whether it's a nation around musicians, whether it's nations around gaming, whether it's nation around pfps, we're going to start to see, like, these sub communities that will grow much larger than, than a subreddit as an example, that will live and breathe in the real world.
01:04:03.000 - 01:04:27.290, Speaker B: And people would say, why are you hyping up this whole digital nation thing? Like, why, why isn't it just called community? Like, you know, all these, like, nouns, dials or whatever? They're just communities. Like, they're, they're no different from, like, Reddit communities or disorder communities. Well, the key difference pre crypto and post crypto, is that pre crypto, those communities don't have their digitally native treasury that they can manage and own.
01:04:27.442 - 01:04:28.474, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
01:04:28.594 - 01:04:30.130, Speaker B: With crypto, you have treasury.
01:04:30.162 - 01:04:30.802, Speaker A: Very good point.
01:04:30.898 - 01:04:48.362, Speaker B: That you can own and govern and potentially buy stuff in the physical world, such as land, real estate, or whatever. You can actually turn yourself into a digital nation that owns some assets, that have your own digitally native property rights. That's the key difference between pre crypto era and post crypto era.
01:04:48.458 - 01:05:24.884, Speaker A: So it's all about the Benjamin. That's. It's cool. I'm going to touch on a couple others, which is metaverse, nfts like Decentraland, insomnia. I don't think we need to go crazy here because it's essentially just digital land that you're purchasing in these metaverses. And the concept of scarcity is completely removed. And so the idea and concept is like, can you build something valuable that would allow people to be pulled into these ecosystems? So, like, I've played with Somnium, I play with Decentraland.
01:05:24.884 - 01:05:54.736, Speaker A: I hung out there for hours, not hours, but like an hour, just to get an understanding, a feeling of why people use these communities. And so far, what I've seen is people are using this as a way to host, like, online events. Right? And that's it. Right. And then people are building stuff, whatever. So you have that. You have something called on cyber, which I think it's more interesting because on cyber is essentially a metaverse, where you showcase your art that you've collected with your pfps.
01:05:54.736 - 01:06:25.192, Speaker A: And, you know, people love going to museums because they appreciate the aesthetics. Being able to see the actual art can go a long way and then learning more about the history. And so punk 6529 launched his own collection on cyber. He has a great collection, by the way. And so I've used it as a way to just check out his content. I could have just gone to opensea and done the same thing, but the idea probably is going to be like, you're going to wear, like, a headset, right. And then you're able to appreciate the art.
01:06:25.192 - 01:06:51.018, Speaker A: Like, when, I mean, by headset, like a quest from meta, etcetera, tying into, like, our meta session a couple sessions ago. And then you're fully immersed into this art, and then be able to appreciate the art, you know, like, I don't think I'll do that. Like, I'm pretty good with just going on Opensea, but, uh, in the future, if everyone's wearing, you know, these goggles or the headsets, then I think it makes sense.
01:06:51.146 - 01:06:53.426, Speaker B: So, Imran, finally.
01:06:53.530 - 01:06:54.162, Speaker A: Yep.
01:06:54.298 - 01:07:00.666, Speaker B: Give me your top five NFT collections that you want to hold for the next two to five years.
01:07:00.850 - 01:07:14.622, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Two to five autoglyphs. Okay. Cryptopunks, Azuki's artifacts, and I'll throw out two more fidenzas and me bits.
01:07:14.678 - 01:07:17.094, Speaker B: So most of them are actually art.
01:07:17.254 - 01:07:41.058, Speaker A: Yeah. I have a high appreciation for art. Yeah. But I also like some of the pfps, like, crypto punks, me bits, artifacts, Azuki's. I was a bored ape holder in the early days when I first launched, but a lot of stuff they did, you know, Topeka, the bull run. Towards the end, after you heard the.
01:07:41.146 - 01:07:47.334, Speaker B: Eminem slimmed up rap, you just dumped it. Rage dumped.
01:07:48.914 - 01:08:05.546, Speaker A: That was horrible music video. Horrible. Like, I wanted to throw up. I mean, yeah, but, yeah, those are mine. And I mean, those are ours. So, you know, it's a couple interesting stuff, right? Like chain runners. Yeah.
01:08:05.546 - 01:08:33.470, Speaker A: Is building completely on the cc zero concept. And so they have this, like, crypto, like, it's called. They're like a punk that live in this, like, you know, dystopian world, and there's a game behind it. And then you can minted 3D Avatar. So there's some really cool stuff happening within the chain runners community. And then the final is like, what's happened with art gobblers? It's a paradigm. Co created this project with the creators of Rick and Morty.
01:08:33.470 - 01:09:14.550, Speaker A: And the idea is that, you know, use really cool game economics, game theory, and a way to, like, incentivize artists to create art, marry the two together to create something very different. And so the way to think about this is that, you know, people were on this white list. They're airdropped this NFT, which is the gobbler. NFT. So, so as long as you hold that NFT, you accrue more Gu tokens. The more you accrue this Gu tokens, you could use that as a way to purchase more art by art gobblers. And then over time, you can use this as a way to customize the main NFT.
01:09:14.550 - 01:09:37.395, Speaker A: So you could think of it as like a canvas, right? And then the art that you can purchase could be then used, like for your canvas type of thing. I'm probably not saying it all the way correctly, but that's the high level concept of it, which I think that's really cool. Like, the longer you hold, you're incentivized to get more goo tokens and use that goo token as a way to buy more art. Makes a lot of sense.
01:09:37.499 - 01:09:38.411, Speaker B: That's very cool.
01:09:38.547 - 01:09:41.943, Speaker A: So those are some of the things that I'm most excited about recently.
01:09:42.243 - 01:10:01.728, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, other than the art stuff, I agree with everything else. Again, I'm very excited about this theme of digital nations. I think whichever NFT collections that have the potential to become that, I will be paying attention. So nails, dao, punks, maybe apes, those are my interests.
01:10:01.856 - 01:10:15.216, Speaker A: Likewise. Well, I think we're at the top of the hour here. Great talk. Went pretty deep on the NFT side. Again, thanks for joining our show and don't forget to subscribe and we'll see you next time.
