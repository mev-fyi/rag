00:00:00.170 - 00:00:40.930, Speaker A: The collapse of FTX should in theory be a tailwind for DeFi. So I actually tried to find data points supporting that over the last couple of days, and I couldn't find any after FTX. Defi volume has not obviously gone up. There's no strong evidence suggesting that DeFi has gone up since FTX. I think what happened was that people withdrew money from everywhere, obviously mostly from centralized exchanges, but they are not putting that money back to work into Defi yet. Everyone just scared right now? Yeah, I feel like everyone's scared. I think this tailwind the collapse of FTX has towards DeFi will take a while to play out, so that's just sort of a minor counterargument.
