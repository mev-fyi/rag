00:00:00.240 - 00:00:45.214, Speaker A: How big is the underground degen community? Because I don't think a lot of people really know how big it is. It's actually pretty small, to be honest. And that's why there's a lot of these projects with massive treasuries that just aren't being valued well by more traditional investors or like, richer whales or funds and things along those lines. I find when I go from trade to trade, you tend to see similar faces, kind of like, over and over again. You can even see, like, on chain analytics. I think if you look at something like Unibot versus banana bot versus whatever the trading part of the week is, it's basically the same tiny subset of, like, 10,000 or less users that are using them, but they're just like really high fees that they get good revenues. Even if you look at, like, on chain nfts, swap volumes are, like, extremely low.
00:00:45.214 - 00:00:59.684, Speaker A: Active wallets are extremely low. For what happens with on chain stuff is typically ETH BTC explode. Then we get this, like, shitcoin follow trade, and then we get the wave of people coming to, like, try the on chain Degen stuff, but otherwise, like, we need ETH BTc to pop first.
