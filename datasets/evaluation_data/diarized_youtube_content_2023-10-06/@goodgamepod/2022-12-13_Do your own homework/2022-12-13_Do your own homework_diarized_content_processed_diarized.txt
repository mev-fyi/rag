00:00:00.160 - 00:00:42.078, Speaker A: I think a lot of part of the FOMO culture that crypto built was also propagated by media. They largely don't know what they're talking about, and you don't know what happens behind closed doors. For me, the biggest narrative that I questioned was, like, SPF's, like, rise to fame, right? Why is it that, like, the media created this monster as an example, right. In a way that ultimately hurt our industry? What are the diligence that they do? What are the messages that they're putting out there? Why are they doing this? What you see in the media, always be skeptical and don't use that as a way to validate or invalidate your thesis. Like, think about it and start to do reference checks. And don't let the media decide how you're going to move forward. Don't believe it.
00:00:42.078 - 00:00:44.774, Speaker A: Be skeptical, and then do proper diligence.
