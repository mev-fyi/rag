00:00:00.160 - 00:00:32.744, Speaker A: Gaming nfts make sense. As a retail collector investor myself, I wouldn't own gaming nfts. Hoping that they will appreciate over time, I would just hold the pfPs, the digital identity, the digital nations theme type of nfts. And potentially those nfts, like the punks and apes, they can be incorporated by games, right? Like potentially the games can build on top of these nfts. Maybe yoga labs themselves will build. I mean, they have been building games on top of their own nfts. So in that sense, the in game nfts make sense.
