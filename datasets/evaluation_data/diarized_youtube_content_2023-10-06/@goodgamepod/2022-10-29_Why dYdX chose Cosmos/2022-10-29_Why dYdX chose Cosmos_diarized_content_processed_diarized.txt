00:00:00.090 - 00:00:07.278, Speaker B: The most interesting case study of Starquare is Dydx. Why Dydx move away.
00:00:07.444 - 00:00:09.114, Speaker A: And into Cosmos?
00:00:09.162 - 00:00:10.190, Speaker B: What are your thoughts on that?
00:00:10.260 - 00:00:39.382, Speaker A: So many reasons. One is, at that time, DyDX was building on a centralized platform, which is a huge risk for DyDX as a company. From a regulatory perspective, I'd say that's number one. Number two is licensing fees. No one really wants to pay for licensing fees. I just think that's just overhead that could be captured by the app itself. And I'd say three is, if you own the entire stack, end to end, naturally, there are additional fees that could be accrued by Dydx as an app.
00:00:39.382 - 00:00:53.420, Speaker A: And then finally, I'd say, is decentralization. Right. So by building on Cosmos Hub, DYDX can focus on its own security and can slowly roll out how decentralized they want to be and how secure they want to be over a fixed period of time.
