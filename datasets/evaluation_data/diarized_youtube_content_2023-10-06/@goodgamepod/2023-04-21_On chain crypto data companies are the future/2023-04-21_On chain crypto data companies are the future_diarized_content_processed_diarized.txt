00:00:00.120 - 00:00:00.856, Speaker B: So Masara focused.
00:00:00.862 - 00:00:03.278, Speaker A: On centralized exchange data and qualitative data.
00:00:03.366 - 00:00:05.278, Speaker B: For better or worse. You know, today, massage.
00:00:05.326 - 00:00:06.446, Speaker A: Is still at.
00:00:06.470 - 00:00:07.534, Speaker B: Least a top three.
00:00:07.614 - 00:00:11.094, Speaker A: Most successful data companies by annual recurring revenue.
00:00:11.174 - 00:00:11.886, Speaker B: I think massage makes.
00:00:11.910 - 00:00:14.102, Speaker A: More money than Nansen and certainly June.
00:00:14.238 - 00:00:15.214, Speaker B: However, Massar.
00:00:15.254 - 00:00:19.950, Speaker A: Is not the leading company in on chain data specifically, but Masara could get there.
00:00:20.062 - 00:00:21.086, Speaker B: And by the way, I'm telling this.
00:00:21.110 - 00:00:21.894, Speaker A: Story to show.
00:00:21.974 - 00:00:22.742, Speaker B: How quickly the.
00:00:22.758 - 00:00:25.054, Speaker A: Space evolves, right? I spent all.
00:00:25.094 - 00:00:26.346, Speaker B: Day thinking about where.
00:00:26.370 - 00:00:35.570, Speaker A: This space is going in the next couple of years, and yet I did not anticipate this rapid change in how data evolved, but more importantly, more generally, how the.
00:00:35.602 - 00:00:36.370, Speaker B: Space overall.
00:00:36.442 - 00:00:40.298, Speaker A: Evolves, which creates constant new opportunities for founders.
00:00:40.386 - 00:00:41.218, Speaker B: So that's.
00:00:41.266 - 00:00:42.794, Speaker A: My personal experience at Masari.
