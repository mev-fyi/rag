00:00:00.320 - 00:00:22.754, Speaker A: Welcome to good game. Your no B's insights for crypto founders. If you don't address the Solana congestion lately and not all the failed transactions, which makes the UX really bad, I can't take you seriously. Solana bags are fine, but this endless, not nuanced Solana chilling or shilling is horrible. You become clowns. Are we clowns? Chow.
00:00:24.014 - 00:00:29.676, Speaker B: Um, okay, so Solana congestion is real.
00:00:29.820 - 00:01:08.832, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto? Check out our request for startups list and get inspired at Alliance XYz ideas. Welcome to good game. Today we're going to be speaking about ordinals. It seems like all of a sudden my timeline has lit up about ordinals, runes and et cetera. And so I think it's finally time for us to dive deep into what's happening. And I know there are other topics that is also coming up, such as like Athena and Echo, et cetera. So we'll touch on some of those towards the end, but I think I'd like to dedicate some most of the time to ordinals.
00:01:08.832 - 00:01:12.084, Speaker A: What would you like to talk about? Or what's top of mind for you?
00:01:12.384 - 00:01:32.554, Speaker B: Well, I tried to ape into some runes, but I couldn't figure out. I know you did. And so that's alpha right there, because I can't even figure out how to ape. Yes. So why don't you, uh, well, why don't we talk about what runes are, how they're related to ordinals, and then we can talk about how to ape.
00:01:33.214 - 00:02:22.784, Speaker A: Yeah. So runes is, it's similar to ordinals. It's created by Casey, who was the co founder or the founder of Ordinals. And the way Runes technically work is the ability to create fungible tokens through a process called etching. It's similar process to inscriptions inscribing, the process of inscribing. But the process is a little bit different, which gives it the fungibility that gives the fungibility of what a token can do, versus an inscription, which is more of a NFT. The best way to describe ordinals is similar to like NFts, more like nfts, whereas runes is more closer to like ERC 20 standard.
00:02:22.784 - 00:02:55.898, Speaker A: And so the process has started about three months ago when Casey launched something called r six. R six are, think of it as an ordinal or NFT and you could purchase one and you could automatically start mining for this new runes token. So when they first launched, they actually airdropped all 21,000 r six. They airdropped it to everyone. So it was a complete, fair launch. And so I received some. And the only way.
00:02:55.986 - 00:02:57.730, Speaker B: How do you, how do you receive six reals?
00:02:57.762 - 00:03:00.130, Speaker A: They just, they automatically send it to your ordinals wallet.
00:03:00.282 - 00:03:00.930, Speaker B: Okay.
00:03:01.042 - 00:03:19.724, Speaker A: Yeah. So it sat there for a couple of days, then I started to see my timeline heat up. And the process by which you need to activate the miner is to transfer from one wallet to another and then back to your wallet. And that kind of turns on the mining for the r six.
00:03:19.844 - 00:03:21.344, Speaker B: Why do they make you do that?
00:03:22.564 - 00:03:30.932, Speaker A: I'm not sure. I think they just want to know that you're actively participating versus some kind.
00:03:30.948 - 00:03:32.272, Speaker B: Of proof of work.
00:03:32.388 - 00:03:39.644, Speaker A: Proof of work, yeah. So this was the proof of work. And to be quite frank, chow, this was a lot of work. Just.
00:03:42.504 - 00:03:44.936, Speaker B: Six confirmations. Ten minutes each.
00:03:45.080 - 00:03:59.664, Speaker A: Yes. Back and forth, back and forth. The problem was that back, I mean, back then it was a little bit clunkier, so. And it was, it was, it was clunkier. So it took me, you know, I don't know, an hour, but was able to get it done.
00:04:00.284 - 00:04:02.464, Speaker B: Do r six come with a JPeg?
00:04:03.044 - 00:04:08.784, Speaker A: Yeah, but the JPEG is, I don't know, it looks like hieroglyphics.
00:04:09.364 - 00:04:10.548, Speaker B: Okay, can you show me?
00:04:10.636 - 00:04:15.584, Speaker A: Yeah, share my screen. So this is what an arcic looks like.
00:04:19.684 - 00:04:21.084, Speaker B: So it's a bunch of letters.
00:04:21.204 - 00:04:33.384, Speaker A: Yeah. And there's only 21,000. And you're able to mine a certain amount of runes every single day.
00:04:35.004 - 00:04:35.820, Speaker B: Okay.
00:04:35.972 - 00:04:55.190, Speaker A: And the beauty about this is that, okay, so you're mining by purchasing these r six, you mine about $350 a day based on the whales market, because whales already has a market for these points runes, and it's currently valued at $1 billion.
00:04:55.382 - 00:04:58.174, Speaker B: Market cap for runes.
00:04:58.294 - 00:05:06.754, Speaker A: For runes, you get to mine $350. So based on that number, you can mine about $350 worth of runes per JPEG.
00:05:08.534 - 00:05:31.944, Speaker B: Okay. But earlier you said runes is more analogous to your C 20. Right. But there's many, many different types of many implementations in your twenties. Every token is a YRS 20. Right, right. So runes, is that the name of the standard or is that the name.
00:05:31.984 - 00:05:35.324, Speaker A: Of the token, the product, the protocol.
00:05:35.624 - 00:05:36.272, Speaker B: Right.
00:05:36.408 - 00:05:42.240, Speaker A: So the protocol, that's the name of the runes protocol. And tokens will launch on the runes protocol.
00:05:42.352 - 00:05:47.044, Speaker B: Right. So what are you mining exactly? What token are you mining with R six?
00:05:47.594 - 00:05:52.666, Speaker A: The actual token that governs the runes protocol.
00:05:52.810 - 00:05:55.682, Speaker B: Oh, the governance token for the runes protocol.
00:05:55.738 - 00:06:02.546, Speaker A: That's what you're mining or whatever it's going to be. I don't know if it's going to be an actual governance token or whatnot. But that's the idea.
00:06:02.650 - 00:06:10.194, Speaker B: Okay, so it's similar to Ord, if you remember already, for ordinals. Yes. Although already is more than meme coin.
00:06:10.314 - 00:06:31.366, Speaker A: More meme coin, yeah, yeah. But there's a lot of talks about what runes an r six can become in the future. Right. You know, some comps I've seen, it's kind of outrageous, but we don't really know exactly what Casey's building with this. Casey, the founder of runes or R six. But they're comping it towards layer ones because you could effectively launch tokens.
00:06:31.430 - 00:06:32.086, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:32.270 - 00:06:52.758, Speaker A: As an example. And so I do. I'm seeing some crazy comps out there, but let's just say that it's somewhere in that realm you can launch tokens. There's also talks about launching a Dex that sits on top of runes, so you can swap between different tokens. So that's kind of like conceptually, do.
00:06:52.766 - 00:07:07.530, Speaker B: You think of runes as actually something similar to URC 20, meaning a standard, a token standard, or do you view it as more of a L2, a programmable layer for bitcoin? Conceptually. What, what is it?
00:07:07.642 - 00:07:11.026, Speaker A: I think it is probably what was the first option?
00:07:11.090 - 00:07:15.890, Speaker B: You said a token standard. Is it a token standard or a programmable L2 or something?
00:07:16.002 - 00:07:18.894, Speaker A: It's going to be more analogous to a programming layer.
00:07:19.474 - 00:07:20.314, Speaker B: Okay.
00:07:20.474 - 00:07:24.826, Speaker A: And I also am seeing like other L2s that want to offer support for runes.
00:07:24.930 - 00:07:25.474, Speaker B: Okay.
00:07:25.554 - 00:08:05.804, Speaker A: So I do think, I mean, technically runes could be implemented on BTC and then other L2s could offer some type of support for runes. So I could see that happening. I'm not sure exactly what the implementation will look like, but I have seen other L2s that have mentioned they want to offer support. Okay, so let's recap. Etching is like deploying a new token and etching a roon is like the best comp I can give you is deploying a new BRC 20 ticker.
00:08:06.184 - 00:08:11.480, Speaker B: Okay. And it hasn't launched. The protocol hasn't launched on mainnet yet.
00:08:11.632 - 00:08:12.496, Speaker A: That's right.
00:08:12.640 - 00:08:13.976, Speaker B: And when is it going to launch?
00:08:14.120 - 00:08:15.400, Speaker A: The day of happening.
00:08:15.552 - 00:08:21.864, Speaker B: Okay. I feel like a bunch of L2s are aiming for that. For the having that to launch.
00:08:22.024 - 00:08:57.732, Speaker A: Yes, that's right. So what's going to happen is right before the happening, two things are going to happen. One is there's going to be a lottery and the lottery will award. I forgot the exact numbers, but say 5% of the total amount of tokens to the, to five winners. And there's a percentage for each of them. So whoever, whoever holds the arsecs will get like a runes, like an airdrop, a giant airdrop of runes. The next is whatever runes that are remaining will then be sent pro Rata to all the Arseq holders who are mining.
00:08:57.732 - 00:09:25.644, Speaker A: Who are mining. Okay, so there's two big events that are happening right before the happening. So it was funny because runes, this is all in the white paper. And it was funny because everyone like, I guess started mining r six and they started dumping them. And so it went down to like, I don't know, zero four BTC. Then someone rediscovered the white paper and said like, oh wait, there's just two big events and the price went three x again. So I thought that was interesting.
00:09:25.644 - 00:09:41.724, Speaker A: So there are some interesting design trade offs for runes. There's something called cenotaph, which is the process. So they describe this as a runes transaction with an error.
00:09:42.464 - 00:09:42.904, Speaker B: Okay.
00:09:42.944 - 00:09:57.040, Speaker A: It could be any error, bad encoding. It could be, you know, the transaction was, was not put together properly. When you're sending a transaction, if that happens, you lose your runes forever, you burn them.
00:09:57.112 - 00:09:57.496, Speaker B: Okay.
00:09:57.560 - 00:10:05.736, Speaker A: So if the wallet is to take this transaction, it has to build it correctly. If it doesn't build it correctly, those runes can be burned forever.
00:10:05.880 - 00:10:07.392, Speaker B: Is this a feature or a bug?
00:10:07.488 - 00:10:22.144, Speaker A: Some people are calling it a feature because if people, well, one, it's a lot of the onus is on the wallets too. Right. But yeah, it's, it could be future bug, depending on if you're the holder or you're the holders.
00:10:23.204 - 00:10:29.068, Speaker B: Okay, and you use the x verse to do all of this?
00:10:29.116 - 00:11:05.636, Speaker A: X verse? Yes. And magic it in to buy all the r six? Yeah. Okay, so there's $350 a day per arc each arsec is worth now 0.08 BTC. And this big happening is going to come up in the next twelve days or eleven days. And yeah, people are all in. And this seems to me like the big liquidity event that would then enable all the cool stuff that happened in the pre defi days on ethereum, if you remember.
00:11:05.780 - 00:11:07.092, Speaker B: What are the pre defi days?
00:11:07.148 - 00:11:25.436, Speaker A: Or like pre post defi days? Remember as we were coming aave lending uniswap all the stuff that kind of start to come together, which then gave us defi summer. Similarly, I think that's what's going to happen with the launch of runes.
00:11:25.620 - 00:11:34.694, Speaker B: So wait, are you saying the likes of Aave compound uniswap can be built or similar to those protocols can you build?
00:11:35.914 - 00:11:40.178, Speaker A: They are already built, but they're built on the BRC 20 standard.
00:11:40.346 - 00:11:40.890, Speaker B: Okay.
00:11:40.962 - 00:12:05.132, Speaker A: And the problem with BRC 20 is that it's not fungible. They're based on inscriptions and ordinals. So think of it as like you're trying to sell blocks of tokens in one inscription. It's really hard to do. And so there's two startups already bank and already swap. Ority bank is a lending product. And then already swap is like the amm of ordinals.
00:12:05.132 - 00:12:18.124, Speaker A: And the problem with ority swap, it's more centralized than decentralized because of the lack of fungibility with the BRC twenties, they have a centralized server that will enable the swaps to occur.
00:12:18.284 - 00:12:19.060, Speaker B: Okay.
00:12:19.212 - 00:12:25.096, Speaker A: It's not purely on a curve because of the illiquidity of the BRC twenties.
00:12:25.240 - 00:12:30.684, Speaker B: Okay. And runes actually achieves fungibility.
00:12:31.304 - 00:12:34.724, Speaker A: Fungibility, that's right. Or in our words, shitcoining.
00:12:35.104 - 00:12:40.124, Speaker B: Shitcoining. So fungibility achieved internally.
00:12:40.624 - 00:12:45.084, Speaker A: Yes. Which means bitcoin could have a defi summer.
00:12:46.664 - 00:12:51.504, Speaker B: Hmm. So is runes basically fundamentally competing with the bitcoin L2s?
00:12:52.124 - 00:12:54.024, Speaker A: To me that's what it seems like.
00:12:54.444 - 00:12:55.068, Speaker B: Okay.
00:12:55.156 - 00:13:08.500, Speaker A: I feel as if runes is competing with L2s. Maybe L2s will have dapps that will run on it, but they may launch their tokens on runes as an example.
00:13:08.652 - 00:13:09.340, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:13:09.412 - 00:13:16.544, Speaker A: By the way, I'm not sure if this is actually going to happen or whether they launch on their L2s, but to me it seems like all eyes are on runes.
00:13:17.204 - 00:13:17.700, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:17.772 - 00:13:39.524, Speaker A: You're even seeing this with meme coins. So there's two pretty big meme coins that have already launched for runes. There's pups and rune stones. The rune stones, essentially they're inscriptions. They were airdropped. So I received a couple. And you have to hold it till the liquidity event.
00:13:39.524 - 00:13:59.624, Speaker A: Then you get x amount of tokens for each inscription or ordinals that you hold. And so the market cap for that roughly sits at for runestones is roughly sitting around 600 million. And the market cap for pups, which stands for bitcoin puppets, sits around 250 million. Market cap.
00:13:59.704 - 00:14:04.312, Speaker B: Wait, is pups the meme coin for puppets? The ordinal, yeah. Okay.
00:14:04.408 - 00:14:08.294, Speaker A: And I think Ansem described it as the whiff of bitcoin of.
00:14:10.274 - 00:14:18.174, Speaker B: My God. Well, before Ansem said that, we didn't know. But now it is. Now that Ansem tweets about it. Yeah. It's going to become.
00:14:18.674 - 00:14:19.682, Speaker A: It's confirmed.
00:14:19.818 - 00:14:20.854, Speaker B: It's confirmed.
00:14:21.634 - 00:14:29.454, Speaker A: Yeah. So Runestones has received a lot of attention and so has now bitcoin pumpkins.
00:14:31.634 - 00:14:37.016, Speaker B: On your Twitter feed, on your Twitter timeline. Who's talking about this stuff?
00:14:37.160 - 00:14:47.484, Speaker A: There's many people. There's. Let me go through the list here. There is a person named Bob Boddaly.
00:14:48.104 - 00:14:48.696, Speaker B: Okay.
00:14:48.760 - 00:15:02.174, Speaker A: There's B ways, b w e y s. There's a guy named Kevin Wu. The community is very different than the communities on ETH and Solana.
00:15:02.554 - 00:15:15.882, Speaker B: And it's also not the. It's not the bitcoin max community for sure. But is it also, is it the bitcoin moderate community like Eric Wall ud?
00:15:16.058 - 00:15:38.916, Speaker A: Yeah, those guys, they're also talking about it. I mean, they're behind taproot wizards and they launched quantum cats on ordinals. But they are. They're pretty deep into the ordinal space. And I think that I've mentioned, I've seen UDIs talk about runes before, too. So, yeah, they're pretty involved, I would say.
00:15:39.020 - 00:15:39.572, Speaker B: Okay.
00:15:39.668 - 00:16:11.904, Speaker A: But the people that are really pushing for this, I think it's the DJ, this new Degen community that surfaced up on bitcoin, which, to be fair, I think it's similar to what happened with Defi. Defi Summer. And, yeah, it's just a new wave of people that found this opportunity. New opportunity. You know, it's like mining, right, for gold. In the. In the real world, you have so many different edges, which is the world, right.
00:16:11.904 - 00:16:53.962, Speaker A: In crypto, they're sectors and everyone has their own niche. Right. Gaming, like, there's so much happening in gaming that I can't even keep up with Axie infinity with the launch of pixels as an example, or prime. And so it seems to me that all of these groups are now, like people all over the world. I see this as a giant game, right? It's a giant game, and everyone is like, in different groups, and they figure out one or two sectors, and that's where they become dominant in those sectors. For all of the upcoming alpha and opportunities, it used to be just one, if you remember Defi. Now there's millions of people that are doing this actively across all of the crypto sectors.
00:16:53.962 - 00:16:56.306, Speaker A: And so that's kind of what's happening with bitcoin today.
00:16:56.450 - 00:17:17.730, Speaker B: I'm very curious how this will. How runes will play out alongside the gazillion bitcoin L2 that will launch. Because what you're describing, like, I'm fairly deep on the bitcoin L2 stuff, but I'm not deep on the rune stuff. But what you're describing makes me feel that they're actually competitive.
00:17:17.922 - 00:18:01.102, Speaker A: It could be. You could think of this as a Utxo based fungible token standard. And there's some cool design trade offs. An example is that it's composable with lightning taproots and other Utxo based systems. It seems to me that you don't have to do any real upgrades outside of the launch of runes, and it'll integrate with a lot of the different systems that are placed within bitcoin. And so here's what I think is going to happen. I think apps will go BTC L2s, but people will want their tokens to be backed by actual bitcoin, which is a process of etching.
00:18:01.102 - 00:18:36.082, Speaker A: Or in ordinal's case it's the process of inscribing. The reason why people like bitcoin or ordinal so much is that it's not just a jpeg, meaning, you know, I'm just being facetious here, but the actual ordinal sits on a set, right? And it's fully on chain. The data is on chain, right. It's not pointed to file coin or anything else. It's fully unchained. So it's as if you're owning a fraction of a bitcoin. Right.
00:18:36.082 - 00:18:37.490, Speaker A: So there's some power to that.
00:18:37.522 - 00:18:45.554, Speaker B: I think it's like crypto punks where all the. Or the old days of cryptopunks where all the pixels were on chain.
00:18:45.634 - 00:18:47.330, Speaker A: Yeah. Auto glyphs, right?
00:18:47.442 - 00:18:47.898, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:47.986 - 00:18:50.698, Speaker A: Everything like the generative art is unchained completely.
00:18:50.826 - 00:18:51.578, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:51.746 - 00:19:06.324, Speaker A: And so I do think there's some cool things with that. Right. So it could very well be that runes protocol could be the de facto place where you launch your token and then all the apps sit on big TC L2s.
00:19:07.104 - 00:19:20.440, Speaker B: So the tokens are created on the runes protocol, but you bridge them to the L2 and you can do stuff there, more advanced stuff, defi or whatever. On the L2 it could be.
00:19:20.552 - 00:19:39.880, Speaker A: Or they could launch on BTC L2 as well. So I think it's a trade off that app developers will have to think about. But at least like if you were a maxi and if you had to buy ordinals, would you buy an ordinal or would you buy an ordinal on or an NFT on a BTC L2.
00:19:40.072 - 00:19:42.604, Speaker B: Definitely the layer one. Yeah. Ordinal.
00:19:42.984 - 00:19:45.384, Speaker A: Why? Because it's backed by his sat, right?
00:19:45.504 - 00:19:46.040, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:46.152 - 00:20:02.484, Speaker A: So at least for now, short term, short to medium term, I could see that being the power law. But in the future nobody will care, right. As long as there's great apps on L2s, who gives a shit. So I feel like that could be a narrative, at least for the short to medium term.
00:20:02.644 - 00:20:03.172, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:03.268 - 00:20:19.496, Speaker A: And the other thing that I want to call out is that BRC 20, which is a standard, they're going to launch a 2.0 version of it that should compete with runes. So we're seeing BRC 22.0 versus runes launching, which also supposedly adds fungibility.
00:20:19.640 - 00:20:32.560, Speaker B: There were a bunch of competing protocols as well. It's not just BRC 20, BRC 22.0 runes. There's like maybe two, three others at least that were trying to compete but didn't go anywhere.
00:20:32.672 - 00:21:11.722, Speaker A: Yeah, it'll be very interesting to see what happens with, with the launch of runes and with BRC 22.0. The other things that are happening on ordinals is obviously for our listeners that have been listening for a while. Node monkeys, bitcoin puppets are like the two major NFT collections. There are some others that are starting to creep up. OmB, Nat cats and I believe ink and ninjas, quantum cats also. So they're starting to gain traction as well. The other cool experiment that I'm seeing is something called game of blocks.
00:21:11.722 - 00:21:13.226, Speaker A: Have you heard of game of blocks?
00:21:13.330 - 00:21:14.442, Speaker B: Nope. What is it?
00:21:14.498 - 00:21:59.900, Speaker A: It's a fully on chain, as they described it as a fully on chain game. I've been playing it since then, phase one. And so the way it works is you buy a bunch of ordinals, okay? And every phase they have a task, and you do the task and then your inscription or your ordinals will upgrade to new ordinals. So it's kind of like a dynamic NFT is the best way to explain it based on a task that you do. And the idea here is they started with, let's say I believe it was 80,000 total supply. I think it was. And the process throughout the different phases enables you to send your or merge your ordinals so that you'd receive a new ordinal.
00:21:59.900 - 00:22:55.118, Speaker A: And this new ordinal would allow you to mine something called a mime token, which I think is either a gaming governance token or just a meme token, I'm not exactly sure. So there's like really cool different experiments that are happening on ordinals that I haven't seen yet on Ethereum or Solana as an example. So I did want to call out game of blocks. It's a fun game that I'm playing, but the idea is that by the end of the game, your ordinals should become a grail by the process of the games that you play. So it started, I think the collection actually started with 120,000 ordinals. Now it's down to 66,000 ordinals total supply. And I think by the time you finish the game, it should be somewhere around 20,000 ordinals.
00:22:55.118 - 00:23:09.934, Speaker A: And whoever played the game from the start since phase one, if you played each game, by the 8th game, you should have a grail in your hand and you should be, and you simultaneously are mining its meme token the entire time.
00:23:11.594 - 00:23:12.854, Speaker B: Bitcoin renaissance.
00:23:13.354 - 00:23:18.602, Speaker A: Bitcoin renaissance. We'll see if it has legs. But I think.
00:23:18.658 - 00:23:34.274, Speaker B: What else, you know, the biggest difference between now and more than a year ago, I think, by the way, I think ordinals is what kick started this whole thing a year ago. And ordinals was accidentally enabled by Taproot.
00:23:34.614 - 00:23:38.478, Speaker A: Yes, the op return of. Right, that's right.
00:23:38.606 - 00:24:06.126, Speaker B: And this whole thing started, this whole renaissance started with ordinals, I think a year ago. The difference between now and more than a year ago is that there's actually now a ton of mind share among smart people and smart builders in the bitcoin ecosystem. A year ago, there wasn't any. This is the most important leading indicator for me to say, this is now, really, we're in the bitcoin renaissance, 100% agreed.
00:24:06.230 - 00:24:13.794, Speaker A: And to me it seems as if. How much wealth effect is there on bitcoin right now?
00:24:14.454 - 00:24:48.022, Speaker B: Tremendous amount of wealth effect. Because the bitcoin market cap is three x that of ethereum. Like more than a year ago, before ordinals, no one on my timeline talked about bitcoin or anything that was happening on bitcoin. All the BTC Maxis blocked me, so I couldn't see anything about bitcoin. But today I'm still blocked by the BTC Maxis. But there's a wave of BTC moderates like UDi, Eric Wall that started talking about bitcoin more and more. I guess the algo helps because there's more paying more people paying attention to what they say.
00:24:48.022 - 00:25:08.920, Speaker B: So the algo pushed their content. To me, that's definitely a factor. But aside from that, there's also a bunch of degens that are into what you mentioned, runes and r six and ordinals. There's a bunch of anon degens that I didn't know about until maybe a few months ago that are talking about all the innovations that are happening on bitcoin.
00:25:09.022 - 00:25:40.262, Speaker A: It's quite exciting. And it seems to me that ethereum, at least specifically ethereum, is being a bit overlooked, I feel like. And so is Solana. The tension with Solana and bitcoin has kind of made ethereum not as the new shiny object anymore. Do you think that will be the case moving forward, or do you think, as crypto always goes, the pendulum swings again and it'll be each season with all the L2s. How do you see it all play out?
00:25:40.318 - 00:25:52.478, Speaker B: I think this has been happening for the last year. Right? Like, BTC and Solana taking my share away from Ethereum. That has been happening for a year. And there's always inertia with this kind of stuff.
00:25:52.646 - 00:25:53.394, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:53.774 - 00:26:03.764, Speaker B: So I think the inertia will probably persist for at least some time, at least a few months, because there's still a bunch of things that hasn't happened that hasn't launched yet on BTC that people are working on.
00:26:03.854 - 00:26:04.264, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:04.344 - 00:26:10.504, Speaker B: There's like 20 BTC L2s that are about to launch this summer, the latest.
00:26:10.664 - 00:26:23.976, Speaker A: So maybe, like, could you, like, paint the ecosystem? Like, how. How is this ecosystem emerging? There's L2s, there's restaking bridges. Can you give me quick, high level what that looks like?
00:26:24.040 - 00:26:58.848, Speaker B: Okay, so before I talk about that, I'll share something that's. That's really funny. Perhaps a little bit dark. So I was talking with a chinese guy who was very deep in the chinese community this morning about the BTC L2 landscape. And he said this to me. He said, us chinese community were fed up with all these things that the west has come up with and dumped on us for the last ten years. Like Ethereum and Solana, these are things that the west are narratives that the west has come up with and dumped on us the last ten years.
00:26:58.848 - 00:27:06.324, Speaker B: So now it's our turn. They think that this whole BTC L2 narrative is something that they created and going to dump on the west.
00:27:07.224 - 00:27:08.800, Speaker A: So this is just a massive dumping.
00:27:08.832 - 00:27:29.652, Speaker B: Event, the west dumping on the east and vice versa. That was really funny. But I think there's a lot of truth to it, because out of the 20 BTC L2 startups that I talked to, well, I didn't talk to all of them. I talked to maybe half of them. I saw 20 of them in the last few months. The overwhelming majority comes from Asia.
00:27:29.788 - 00:27:47.836, Speaker A: Even if you think about it, like, even in the early days of bitcoin, yes, it did start in the US, but I felt like it got a lot of mind share in Asia. Right, because mining. Yeah. And so it seems like a lot of the wealth effect is in China as well. And like certain other parts of Asia.
00:27:47.940 - 00:28:11.674, Speaker B: Yes, 100% the wealth is captured by the miners who got very wealthy since 2013 or so. And also BTC has been a highly demanded asset by chinese since the beginning, for obvious reasons. Right. It's an uncensorable store of value.
00:28:11.834 - 00:28:12.586, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:12.770 - 00:28:28.858, Speaker B: So a lot of chinese whales are. A lot of BTC whales are chinese because when I talked to the BTC L2s, almost every one of them wants whales on their cap table. They want whales to contribute some of their BTC to boost TVL. Like, I don't know if you saw Merlin.
00:28:29.026 - 00:28:29.682, Speaker A: Yes.
00:28:29.818 - 00:28:34.534, Speaker B: A month ago, Merlin went to $2 billion. I don't even know what the later summer is.
00:28:34.914 - 00:28:35.554, Speaker A: That's insane.
00:28:35.594 - 00:29:06.814, Speaker B: A month ago it was 2 billion FTV. That was already a top three L2. If Merlin was a ethereum L2, then it was already a number three top three because one is arbitrage, second is optimism, third is third was blast. I guess now it's base. But Merlin was already 2 billion a month ago, and now it's probably a lot higher because I haven't followed. So. Okay, so anyway, all these BTC L2s, they want whales on their cap table.
00:29:06.814 - 00:29:15.100, Speaker B: And a lot of the whales are chinese. I mean, they're chinese nationals living in, like, Singapore or something, for example.
00:29:15.252 - 00:29:16.060, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:16.252 - 00:29:23.020, Speaker B: So the BTC L2 is at least a 50% chinese narrative.
00:29:23.132 - 00:29:30.004, Speaker A: I mean, a lot of the founders are coming out of the bitcoin ecosystem are chinese, from the interviews that I've done.
00:29:30.164 - 00:29:30.724, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:30.844 - 00:29:57.012, Speaker A: So it makes a lot of sense. So are we seeing a bifurcation of ecosystems? And we talked about this in, like, two pods ago. But different geographies will build on certain ecosystems only. And that could be primarily because of their association with the asset in itself. So in China, Asia's case, gold is like bitcoin. Right. Or India's case.
00:29:57.012 - 00:30:12.020, Speaker A: And in the west, it's primarily, like narrative based. Right. Smart contracts, parallelization as an example, et cetera. People will kind of move towards the edge of the tech use cases. Is that what's happening here?
00:30:12.092 - 00:30:33.432, Speaker B: 100%. And this is not a new phenomenon. This east versus west division has happened since 2013 or something. BTC is at least relative. Speaking is more eastern, and Ethereum is definitely western. Solana is mostly western.
00:30:33.528 - 00:30:46.912, Speaker A: I feel like Solana is western, but emerging countries as well. Did you see that video that went viral on TikTok? It was an african grandmother.
00:30:47.088 - 00:30:51.488, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, right. And she was using pump or something, right?
00:30:51.536 - 00:31:00.780, Speaker A: Were they using pump they were using? No, they had a phantom wallet and she showed her tokens. She was in a marketplace, like, selling, like, fruit or vegetables.
00:31:00.852 - 00:31:01.436, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:01.580 - 00:31:09.300, Speaker A: For those that haven't seen it in some, like, remote village like you and I will never go to. Right.
00:31:09.332 - 00:31:11.436, Speaker B: In Africa. Right. In Africa, yeah.
00:31:11.540 - 00:31:30.196, Speaker A: And someone had. Someone approached this grandma, and she, like, flipped her phone around and it was her phantom wallet, and it showed that she bought, like, I don't know, bandicats or something. I forgot what it was called. She had some soul and, like, $192 in a wallet. Right.
00:31:30.300 - 00:31:31.012, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:31.188 - 00:31:39.540, Speaker A: So I think, yes. Solana is going to be for people that are emerging countries and retail. Right. That's kind of.
00:31:39.572 - 00:31:41.820, Speaker B: Which is very understandable because the fees are low.
00:31:41.972 - 00:32:01.832, Speaker A: Exactly. So that's kind of the dynamic. It seems like. It's interesting how this is all playing out. Bitcoin for the east. Right. Solana for the emerging countries and retail and west and Ethereum for the ogs, L2s for, you know, different parts of the world.
00:32:01.832 - 00:32:05.928, Speaker A: Yeah, parts of the world. Like, base is more, it seems like consumer.
00:32:05.976 - 00:32:06.688, Speaker B: West Coast.
00:32:06.816 - 00:32:07.816, Speaker A: West coast consumer.
00:32:07.840 - 00:32:08.936, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:09.120 - 00:32:14.368, Speaker A: Blast is like a casino slash dGen encrypted natives. Yeah, it's kind of cool.
00:32:14.536 - 00:32:18.576, Speaker B: Speaking of that, do we want to address the Solana congestion?
00:32:18.760 - 00:32:25.444, Speaker A: We should. We had. So, funny enough from our last episode, we got some hate mail.
00:32:26.424 - 00:32:27.496, Speaker B: Want to share your screen?
00:32:27.600 - 00:32:36.712, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm sharing my screen. All right, this is the funniest one. Do you need a nine volt battery? Fam, I'm about to come change your smoke alarm for you. This is like the fifth episode of.
00:32:36.728 - 00:32:39.806, Speaker B: This that has been fixed today.
00:32:39.950 - 00:33:01.318, Speaker A: Thank you. All right. We're the ones that Solana probably at the end. What is the name here? Handsome Ansem. I can't find it on Twitter. Yeah, he's definitely retail and not here yet. Okay, transferring.
00:33:01.318 - 00:33:08.806, Speaker A: Erc. 20s don't cost dollar 80. This is misinformation. I use and own both Ethereum and Solana, FYI.
00:33:08.990 - 00:33:34.060, Speaker B: Oh, I can address quickly this. So I checked the numbers. No, it's not $80. The average transaction cost on Ethereum layer one is not $80. It was more like between ten and 20. But as everyone knows, the transaction costs are highly variable on the mainnet or anywhere. So the last time I did use Ethereum layer one, it was $80, unfortunately.
00:33:34.060 - 00:33:37.052, Speaker B: But, yeah, he's right that the average is not 80.
00:33:37.188 - 00:33:45.044, Speaker A: Ethereum dooming is very bullish. The reality is that it's the only chain that works. That's why rw and fast provable compute will settle on it.
00:33:45.204 - 00:33:50.944, Speaker B: At this point, it's just cope. Let's. Let's skip that. But I want to. Let's. Let's address the Solana congestion.
00:33:51.524 - 00:33:52.344, Speaker A: Uh.
00:33:56.844 - 00:33:58.184, Speaker B: I think it's the. At the end.
00:33:58.864 - 00:34:00.816, Speaker A: There's so many fun ones I want to talk about.
00:34:00.880 - 00:34:01.176, Speaker B: Okay.
00:34:01.200 - 00:34:17.444, Speaker A: All right. If you don't address the Solana congestion lately and not all the failed transactions, which makes the UX really bad, I can't take you seriously. Solana bags are fine, but this endless, not nuanced Solana chilling or shilling is horrible. You become clowns. Are we clowns? Chow.
00:34:19.584 - 00:35:05.044, Speaker B: Okay, so Solana congestion is real. There's a lot of data flying around Twitter that shows a chart of Solana successful and failed transactions over the last few weeks. And it showed that Solana failed transactions was, like, 75%. Later, that chart got debunked by Mert, among other people. In fact, I tweeted it, and later, someone corrected me, saying that that chart doesn't actually reflect what users experience. So that chart shows the failed transactions on chain. But most failed transactions on chain are actually bots.
00:35:05.044 - 00:35:41.374, Speaker B: Okay? On the other hand, the failed transactions that users experience on phantom through Jupyter, those are technically called drop transactions. And those drop transactions are not tracked on chain. And, in fact, they're not trackable on chain. So this is what Marius told me. So, Marius is the founder of Hubble Camino, and he sent me this message, and I'm going to read it out loud. So Marius sent me this. There's one big problem and two medium sized problems.
00:35:41.374 - 00:36:35.736, Speaker B: The big problem is the Solana validator is spammed with transactions from too much demand, and the processor is too busy handling incoming traffic that it can't also spend time sorting that traffic properly. So here's an analogy. Imagine you are a chef that needs to cook based on the most expensive offer that you receive, but you don't have a waiter or an assistant, and everyone is yelling at you, hey, cook me a steak for $100. And you have to listen to everyone and respond to them, since 99% of the time, you're so busy taking the orders, you can't put them down in a spreadsheet and say, okay, I will do this one first, and then I'll do the other one first. Ordering the ordering. You will just take the random one and get it done, because you make fees from executing transactions anyway. So what people realize is that it doesn't matter if you overbid.
00:36:35.736 - 00:36:55.728, Speaker B: What matters is you spam and send as many orders as possible. And the chef is so overwhelmed with orders that he picks them almost randomly. So you want to spend hardcore to make sure that your orders are very frequent. And so this was the problem that was happening on Solana. Does the analogy make sense to you, Imran?
00:36:55.776 - 00:36:59.204, Speaker A: It does, it does. It's more of a networking problem.
00:36:59.824 - 00:37:02.424, Speaker B: It's a network stack problem. Networking stack problem.
00:37:02.464 - 00:37:03.680, Speaker A: It's a networking problem.
00:37:03.872 - 00:37:43.196, Speaker B: Here's the thing that, okay, so I can't explain the technicality in detail, but from what I understand, this is a network engineering problem, and it's very solvable. It will take some time, but the solution seems to be coming soon. And this is very different from a fundamentally flawed consensus problem, which is much, much harder to solve. So it looks like, at least based on some of the, uh, Twitter discussions by Merd and others, and totally, that a solution will come very soon. So by the time this podcast goes out, maybe the solution is there.
00:37:43.380 - 00:37:53.664, Speaker A: So I'm going to explain it to you from a user perspective. Um, so I've used, obviously, I've used eat for a very long time, and I've seen fees go get up to, like, hundreds of dollars.
00:37:54.044 - 00:37:54.784, Speaker B: Right.
00:37:55.204 - 00:38:28.456, Speaker A: Um, and so for the average person, if they see some sort of spike in gas fees, they just won't use a product. What I realized from my experiences with the congestion was my transaction just doesn't go through, and I just wait and push it through again. And I push it through again, and then it finally goes through. It took me about two or three tries at times. Right. It goes through on Solana, but it goes through. So from a retail perspective, it's like, okay, what's the trade offs? Is it your transaction not going through after your first try or your transaction going through, but you're spending a lot of money.
00:38:28.600 - 00:38:29.444, Speaker B: Mm hmm.
00:38:29.744 - 00:38:37.816, Speaker A: Right. So, yes, I think it is a big deal. Like, but I'm not discounting the trade offs.
00:38:37.840 - 00:38:37.952, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:37.968 - 00:38:52.964, Speaker A: It's still messed up. Like, it's not good. It's essentially not building. Like, the product isn't good. But I'm okay with the trade offs. Like, if I'm still spending, you know, pennies on a dollar for a transaction, fine with it.
00:38:53.344 - 00:39:20.966, Speaker B: So, from what I've seen, the drop transactions, actually, it depends on the time of the day and depends on the app. For whatever reason, what you describe is a relatively positive case. You sign three transactions, two of them fail, the third one goes through. But I've heard stories from will on our team. He tried to claim wormhole twelve times consecutively.
00:39:21.110 - 00:39:25.834, Speaker A: Well, I mean, I mean, if. Yeah, I haven't done the claim.
00:39:26.214 - 00:39:30.758, Speaker B: Um, you probably tried to claim during the peak time, that's like an, I.
00:39:30.766 - 00:39:38.446, Speaker A: Wouldn'T call it anomaly, but it's one of the times where there's a hundred thousand people that are all, like, looking to claim all at the same time. Right?
00:39:38.550 - 00:40:02.626, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think the point I wanted to make is, uh, the failed transactions are real. No one is denying it. The Solana Maxis are not denying it. All the users are complaining about it on Twitter. But it seems like. I'm not going to say it's an easy problem to solve, but it's a solvable problem.
00:40:02.730 - 00:40:09.570, Speaker A: And for listeners that think that we're, I don't know, maybe more biased towards Solana, that's biased.
00:40:09.722 - 00:40:20.702, Speaker B: Like, the vast majority of our bags are Ethereum, period. Like Solana startups that we back is maybe 1015, 20% of our portfolio.
00:40:20.798 - 00:40:21.470, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:40:21.582 - 00:40:23.194, Speaker B: The remaining is ethereum.
00:40:23.654 - 00:41:08.212, Speaker A: We want to be critical for a few reasons. One is obviously to get the message across so that ethereum could be more competitive. And many of the founders that come through our program are on blast or base polygon or arbitrary. And so we do see an influx of startups that are building for L2s. But it would be nice to have an even competitive landscape where founders can choose whether it's a L2 or a Solana, and the trade offs are similar, so that they can build for either side. That's the role I want to see, where all the ecosystems or all the layer ones and L2s are somewhat similar in different, maybe some trade offs, but at the end of the day, they're all on an even competitive landscape.
00:41:08.388 - 00:41:11.340, Speaker B: Yep. Any other funny comments from you?
00:41:11.372 - 00:41:28.104, Speaker A: Yeah, I just want to read through some of the funny ones. There's a funny one about you, so I'd like to. Outside of the, I haven't seen everything yet. Kind of sad that at the end of the all of you're talking about is your bags. By the way, most of the issues you're talking about have been solved by Polkadot.
00:41:29.124 - 00:41:30.944, Speaker B: Who talks about polka dot?
00:41:34.064 - 00:41:35.200, Speaker A: All right, I can't read the rest.
00:41:35.232 - 00:41:36.832, Speaker B: Because I didn't see that coming.
00:41:37.008 - 00:41:56.912, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. He must be a Polkadot holder. Okay, why is chaos so intellectually dishonest? Speaking about bridging from layer one when no normal user does that, my guess, less than 1% bridging involves the layer one. Bonus is L2. Layer two or coinbase L2? I don't know. I do a lot of layer one to L2.
00:41:56.912 - 00:42:00.852, Speaker A: Now I do L2. Layer two. But what do you use for L2?
00:42:00.868 - 00:42:01.624, Speaker B: Layer two.
00:42:02.564 - 00:42:38.250, Speaker A: Sometimes if I have to bridge from. Oh, what do I use? I use combination of across synapse are the two that I typically use. Yeah, wormhole, d bridge for Solana plus EVM. But yeah, those are my go to bridges. Bridges are pretty good now. Like I wanted to catch a token on base, so I had to bridge some from Solana and so I used a portal and I think I did everything in three minutes. It's not bad.
00:42:38.250 - 00:42:52.182, Speaker A: Yeah, dbridge also works great. I've used dbridge many times and people are really surprised that dbridge is the fastest, cheapest bridging out there right now compared to wormhole and everything else. So also interesting to hear those comments.
00:42:52.278 - 00:43:01.014, Speaker B: I see a lot of comments saying deep bridge is the best bridge. Yeah, but what he's saying, he's saying I'm intellectually dishonest because what? Because.
00:43:01.134 - 00:43:08.310, Speaker A: Because no normal user bridges from layer one to a L2. It's all L2 to L2 or exchanges to a L2.
00:43:08.422 - 00:43:11.990, Speaker B: Okay. I guess I'm just not a normal user.
00:43:12.102 - 00:43:37.106, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not either, I guess because a lot of my ETH is still on layer one. So yeah, I don't know. All my nfts are on layer one too, so I think those are all the fun comments welcome to founder story. Today we have Gwanzi from Fig investments here to talk to us about his journey building the RWA space.
00:43:37.290 - 00:43:40.610, Speaker B: Gwanzi, how are you doing? Well, Amran, how are you doing?
00:43:40.642 - 00:43:42.226, Speaker A: Great, thanks for having me.
00:43:42.330 - 00:43:43.014, Speaker B: Yep.
00:43:43.344 - 00:43:46.400, Speaker A: What's one of the biggest challenges building in the RWA space?
00:43:46.552 - 00:44:04.936, Speaker C: It's been a very interesting journey for us. So we specifically operate in the RWA for options space. So the biggest challenge is actually finding the buying side as well as the selling side. And how do you bridge the two of them between off chain and on chain? That's been quite interesting and challenging for us.
00:44:05.000 - 00:44:05.832, Speaker A: How did you solve it?
00:44:05.888 - 00:44:40.840, Speaker C: So one of the things is that you got to find that markets are not homogenous, so they are not in a single place where you find all the buyers and all the sellers for options. Very specifically, you have the crypto natives who have a lot of on chain assets. They like to get yield, so they sell a lot of options. They prefer to sell options, but whereas the buyers from traditional markets, they like to buy options because that's the only one of the most popular financial instruments. So one of the challenges is how do you connect the two of them together using a structure that they're both familiar with so they're not changing their behavior and I think that's how you unlock RWA market.
00:44:40.992 - 00:44:48.784, Speaker A: Rwas have now been around for a few years. What are some upcoming trends that you're seeing from customer behavior or user behavior?
00:44:48.904 - 00:44:58.872, Speaker C: So I think one thing is that people are becoming more familiar that financial assets are becoming more tokenized. Like they heard of bitcoin, ETF's now.
00:44:58.928 - 00:44:59.408, Speaker A: Right?
00:44:59.536 - 00:45:26.728, Speaker C: They heard of the digitalization of different assets. I think Blackrock is probably one of the pioneers that really trying to wave the flag and saying that assets are beginning to be organized so there's more liquidity. So I think that's one of the biggest trends, that people are going to be more familiar. And when they're more familiar, they're willing to, I guess, you know, tailor their current buying and selling behavior in the markets that adapt to that trend.
00:45:26.856 - 00:45:28.568, Speaker A: And what are you most excited about?
00:45:28.656 - 00:45:53.870, Speaker C: We're just really most excited that actually this bridge is seem to be open, because when you actually have people that are more excited about tokenization and they're looking to buy things on chain, off chain, they're okay with that. Crypto is no longer just a fringe, I guess, market. So I think the bridging between the traditional markets and on chain market is very, very exciting. So I think you unlock liquidity on both sides, which actually just makes more investment returns and yield for both.
00:45:53.982 - 00:45:55.814, Speaker A: Great guanzi. Thank you so much for your time.
00:45:55.934 - 00:45:57.194, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks, Emer.
00:46:00.734 - 00:46:02.954, Speaker B: Oh, we should talk about Athena.
00:46:03.454 - 00:46:04.990, Speaker A: Yes, let's talk about Athena.
00:46:05.062 - 00:46:06.222, Speaker B: Did you follow the drama?
00:46:06.398 - 00:46:08.834, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, like, there were a lot of.
00:46:09.134 - 00:46:09.942, Speaker B: What are you talking about?
00:46:09.958 - 00:46:12.078, Speaker A: The drama with Makerdao Navi.
00:46:12.246 - 00:46:29.626, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, so there's two dramas. There's the. The one with Mikurdao Ave and Morphle, and the other drama is people fudding about the yield. Let's start with the Yolngu. So the fud is. Well, a lot of people think the yield cannot be that high.
00:46:29.626 - 00:46:40.202, Speaker B: It has to be a terror at 2.0. Look, you and I don't have a dog in the fight, but Athena, conceptually.
00:46:40.378 - 00:46:44.402, Speaker A: Okay, so it's just farming the funding rate, right?
00:46:44.498 - 00:46:58.278, Speaker B: It's farming the funding rate and the funding rate. Farming as a strategy, as a trading strategy is almost as close as it gets to, quote, unquote, risk free. Now there's obvious.
00:46:58.366 - 00:47:00.994, Speaker A: Are you talking about risk free like rebel Paul?
00:47:01.574 - 00:47:06.942, Speaker B: I had that video of rob at the back of my mind when I said that, but I said it anyway.
00:47:07.078 - 00:47:08.670, Speaker A: Basically risk free.
00:47:08.822 - 00:47:27.778, Speaker B: It's basically risk free. But there's two risks, two major risks. One is custody risk, and the other one is execution risk. And I know this not from reading stuff on Twitter. I know this because I did basis trading in my past career before crypto. So the custody risk is. Athena actually does a lot of centralized exchange trading.
00:47:27.778 - 00:47:40.546, Speaker B: Yes. So they store the money with centralized custodian. Now they say it's safe, blah, blah, blah. It's prime brokerage, that kind of stuff. I don't have time to dig into that kind of detail. I'm not farming Ethyna. I don't own Athena.
00:47:40.546 - 00:48:08.462, Speaker B: I don't farm it, because I'm just too lazy to read, to study, understand the custody risk. But I know that is a risk that if you do farm Athena, you need to understand. So the custody risk is one and is very significant. The second risk is just the risk of execution. So when you put on a basis position, there's always execution risk, operational risk, fat fingering, that kind of stuff. Right.
00:48:08.578 - 00:48:14.206, Speaker A: But do you feel like it's. The risks are relatively small compared to, say, small?
00:48:14.270 - 00:48:27.174, Speaker B: Yeah, it's small. It's nowhere near the level of terra, because Terra, the UST, was not even fully backed, like, already. The risks are different ends of the spectrum.
00:48:27.254 - 00:48:27.838, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:27.966 - 00:48:31.034, Speaker B: So that's why I said it's basically risk free.
00:48:31.894 - 00:48:35.434, Speaker A: The image just keeps circling in my brain.
00:48:35.614 - 00:48:47.274, Speaker B: Exactly. I did that on purpose. It's basically risk free. But if you want to farm it, you need to study and understand the execution risk and the custodial risk behind it.
00:48:47.354 - 00:48:53.370, Speaker A: Okay, so an example is like, more and more people from, oh, it looks like the solar eclipse is happening right now.
00:48:53.442 - 00:48:54.734, Speaker B: Oh, that's why it's still dark.
00:48:55.034 - 00:48:55.814, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:56.274 - 00:49:01.254, Speaker B: Had to turn on the light. That's kind of cool. Yeah.
00:49:02.984 - 00:49:24.000, Speaker A: So let's say tradfi comes in, because it seems like right now the funding rates are out of whack and there's no real institutions involved. And it looks like all the basis traders in the last cycle blew up or they left. Right. So now this opportunity is available, and Athena is perfect at the perfect time. And they're farming this funding rate.
00:49:24.112 - 00:49:24.804, Speaker B: Yep.
00:49:25.504 - 00:49:31.060, Speaker A: What happens when the whole world, or like, institutions start to come and start to also farm the funding rate it's.
00:49:31.092 - 00:49:37.544, Speaker B: Going to compress, but. Well, it'll compress the yield without really changing the risk profile for Adina.
00:49:37.964 - 00:49:40.064, Speaker A: So the yield will change. That's all.
00:49:40.924 - 00:49:51.468, Speaker B: Yep. Okay, but look, the. I have no issue with the. Their idea of productizing basis trading.
00:49:51.596 - 00:49:53.740, Speaker A: There's many other tries before, too.
00:49:53.932 - 00:50:00.060, Speaker B: 100%. There was lemma, there was the Solana. One can't remember the name Lemma?
00:50:00.132 - 00:50:01.924, Speaker A: There's panoptic, was it?
00:50:01.964 - 00:50:02.864, Speaker B: No, no.
00:50:03.244 - 00:50:04.124, Speaker A: Forgot the other one.
00:50:04.164 - 00:50:18.276, Speaker B: Got the name. But the biggest problem with Athena really, is that they market themselves as a stablecoin, which is very misleading. What it really is is a tokenized hedge fund without a prospectus or.
00:50:18.300 - 00:50:20.218, Speaker A: Tokenized. Yeah, tokenized.
00:50:20.306 - 00:50:47.050, Speaker B: Like the idea of a tokenized hedge fund. I have no issue with it, but the marketing is very misleading. The product is called USDE. It frankly suggests a stable coin. And the risk profile is far away from far being similar to that of USDC or USDT. That's the biggest problem. But again, I don't think that the probability that anything really bad happening to Athena is high.
00:50:47.242 - 00:50:50.574, Speaker A: So five years from now, ethanol still be around, you think?
00:50:51.554 - 00:50:57.534, Speaker B: You know, I think the founders are just going to make so much money that they're going to quit because the token is live. The token is on binance.
00:50:58.594 - 00:51:02.026, Speaker A: Yeah. It's worth. It's worth $14 billion.
00:51:02.130 - 00:51:03.294, Speaker B: Yeah. Which is crazy.
00:51:05.794 - 00:51:06.814, Speaker A: My God.
00:51:08.554 - 00:51:45.214, Speaker B: But the other drama was between Fina maker Aave and Morpho. So I actually asked Jack from Chroma, which is also one of my portfolio companies, to give me a quick write up on the drama. So I'll just read it out loud. Yeah. Very long history, actually. Ave and Maker have been beefing for the past year, essentially starting from around the launch of Spark, which is a maker subbell. Spark is an Aave v three fork that was approved by Aave governance in exchange for a fee share.
00:51:45.214 - 00:52:13.794, Speaker B: The beef stems primarily because Spark is Maker's Aave. And go g h o is Aave's Dai. Right. So they're, they're competing with each other on both fronts, on both the lending and the stablecoin front. So each is going for each other's bread winner. Now, Aave and Morpho have also been beefing for a while because they're competing in lending. So Aave and Morpho are both lending protocols.
00:52:13.794 - 00:53:08.236, Speaker B: Aave took action about a month ago by creating a merit system where they gave rewards to people who only deposited into AavE and didn't deposit any into Morpho protocol or spark. Okay, so this is the whole history, the whole context. Now, the drama went nuclear when spark Maker started working closely with Morpho and minting Dai into Morpho bloop to be borrowed against Susde. That's the stable coin for Athena. So key Aave, people like Marc Zeller, Stani, to some extent, reacted by proposing to essentially delist Dai from Aave. They will turn the LTV to zero. And the justification on Ave's end seems to be an increased increased risk of diet peg from the decision maker, from the decision that maker made to land against Athena as Usde.
00:53:08.236 - 00:53:21.268, Speaker B: It's pretty obvious that this isn't the case, or it's just a small factor and they're just beefing with Maker and trying to disadvantage them by delisting die. That's the whole drama. Did it make sense to you?
00:53:21.396 - 00:53:28.824, Speaker A: It just seems like they're just, they're competing with each other now. Yeah, and it's becoming more petty to me.
00:53:28.944 - 00:53:52.854, Speaker B: So Aave, Maker. Aave has been competing against Maker and Morpho. Maker and Morphle are in the same camp. Ave is on the other camp. And recently Maker and Morphle started listing Athena's s u s de under lending protocol. That in theory does increase a little bit of risk for Dai, the stablecoin of maker. But the risk is small.
00:53:52.854 - 00:54:01.946, Speaker B: Exactly. The risk is small enough that it shouldn't warrant a delisting by the Aave team.
00:54:02.130 - 00:54:34.214, Speaker A: And I saw some of the numbers out there. Right. So Maker popped in a billion right into Athena. They're making between $250 to $300 million a year. So why wouldn't maker holders want this? They want this. I mean, I think Roon did the right. Yes, there's some centralized risks, there's some execution risks, you know, once the fees, you know, compress, selling out of the position, et cetera, there's some risks involved.
00:54:34.214 - 00:54:39.326, Speaker A: But for making 200, 5200 million dollars annualized, it's not a, it's not a bad deal.
00:54:39.470 - 00:55:09.602, Speaker B: Yep. Essentially what makers doing is makers. Makerdao is lending dai to this pool, and s usde, which is ethernet stablecoin, is being used as collateral. So people borrow dai against ethina, stablecoin, probably to do even more, to buy even more ethina. That's the same trade as stake ETH megalayer. Exactly. And so maker earns revenue from lending dai, like, maker is basically the central bank of the Defi.
00:55:09.602 - 00:55:23.466, Speaker B: Like they create diet and land everywhere. So that's the drama. Again, I have no dog in the fight, but it's just, it's politics. It's two competitors going after each other.
00:55:23.570 - 00:56:16.024, Speaker A: Well, we're also seeing some of this with Gauntlet and chaos labs. Gauntlet and chaos labs were both servicing aave, and then recently Aave and Gauntlet stopped working with each other. And now Abe is focused on working with Morpho as an example, whereas chaos labs, who's only servicing Abe now. So it seems like, and I don't know the exact drama to the extent of it, but I do feel like there's a rift happening and people are choosing sides of Ave versus Makerdao and Morpho and other incumbents. And that's kind of where the split is right now. Interesting, interesting stuff. Yeah, I'm just like, when I look at the Athena's market cap, insane 14 billion.
00:56:16.024 - 00:57:20.304, Speaker A: So the last topic I want to touch on is echo with Kobe. You and I have been talking about this for a very long time, which is how do we democratize access for the everyday person to be able to get the same opportunities as the VC's do? That was the reason why we launched Alliance Dao. Like, if you remember this, you and I had this conversation before. We won't go into specifics due to regulations, but the concept is similar, right? Being able to get the same level of access as the VC's do and to be able to invest early so that you get the same upsize as anyone else. Why should VC's and investors that don't really provide support to founders get to sit in the palace is the question. Right? When you look at the numbers that are out there, it's insanity how much money investors make in crypto. Hundreds to thousands of percentages.
00:57:20.304 - 00:58:18.794, Speaker A: And so there's this like pendulum swing, right? So 2017, it was all icos that went into shambles because of regulations and et cetera. Now that pendulum is swinging right back around two. 3242-023-2024 pendulum is now more about allowing retail participation, whether it's through a direct ICO or through retail, providing capital to influencers to be able to allocate in size similar to the VC's that are in the space. I also think there's a third one. And the third one is buying a token that gives you upside into the exposure that the token would have to all the startups, as an example. So a good example would be like YGG, right? People buy Yg. At least the last bull market, people bought YGG because the DAO had a balance sheet where he would invest into startups.
00:58:18.794 - 00:58:35.514, Speaker A: So they would publish their nav once a week or something, and people would arbit so they can get into parity of the book value, the token parity with the book value of the nav. So there's three ways that I see. Do you see any other ways?
00:58:35.854 - 00:58:37.558, Speaker B: That's it? Yeah.
00:58:37.726 - 00:58:39.746, Speaker A: Which way are you most excited about?
00:58:39.910 - 00:59:00.874, Speaker B: I really like Kobe's way. On the surface, it looks like he's going to allow influencers to run a fund. Yep. So the influencers can raise a little bit of money from retail and then they would invest in the deals. Right. And fundamentally that's the same as angellist, how do they call it? SPV.
00:59:00.994 - 00:59:05.826, Speaker A: SPV, I think it was. Or a rolling fund. Rolling fund.
00:59:05.890 - 00:59:07.674, Speaker B: Rolling fund, that's right. Rolling font.
00:59:09.134 - 00:59:58.870, Speaker A: I sent you a screenshot of what Ansem put a poll out and the polls said, which do you trust the most? And there are four options. Highly reputable vc, highly reputable company, highly reputable person, highly reputable institution. 80% voted, 6000 people voted, of which 80% went to highly reputable person. And Kobe replied to a tweet, damn, this is going to work. So, yeah, it seems like Echo is perfect because it does a few things really well. One is it captures the influencer, the influencer wave, where we are heading next, where we are now and moving towards is predominantly influencer based marketing. Right.
00:59:58.870 - 01:00:23.994, Speaker A: That's the world we live in, TikTok, Twitter, whatever you call it. And. And that's becoming more and more apparent. And I think it's primarily because identity is harder to. You can hide behind a company, right? But you can't hide behind yourself. It's your own reputation. People know you as a person, right? So the risk of you scamming someone is much lower than scamming via a company or institution or et cetera.
01:00:23.994 - 01:00:49.334, Speaker A: You have less regard for credibility. So I think that's number one, right, influencer based marketing. Two is, I consider this as a centralized Dao. The problem with investment daos today is the fact that, no, there's no clear decision maker. I was a part of like Meta Cartel, as an example, which was the first working venture Dao. The first non working venture Dao was the dao, right. Via Ethereum.
01:00:49.334 - 01:00:58.890, Speaker A: And back then, like, I went through it two to three years, most everybody was passive and it was really hard to get to decisions quickly.
01:00:58.962 - 01:01:00.474, Speaker B: Right. Free rider problem.
01:01:00.594 - 01:01:08.826, Speaker A: Free rider problem. But this solves the free rider problem, right? You have this one individual person that will want to invest in the startups.
01:01:08.930 - 01:01:09.594, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:01:09.754 - 01:01:12.574, Speaker A: And the third thing it does really well is retail.
01:01:13.994 - 01:01:14.354, Speaker B: Right.
01:01:14.394 - 01:01:30.676, Speaker A: You have this army that you're amassing and the army could technically just, Ansem could say, hey, army, since we invest in this project, I want you to use this product. And they may, they may use the product. They'd be more inclined to using the product because they're also investors.
01:01:30.820 - 01:01:31.588, Speaker B: Yep.
01:01:31.756 - 01:01:35.780, Speaker A: So that's what I like about what Kobe's product does.
01:01:35.892 - 01:02:02.636, Speaker B: Yep. So on the third point, like, actually it's a result of all the three points, which is that I think a product like this will eventually push the long tail of VC's out of the game, because there's, with this product, with a product like this, there's going to be a huge inflow of new capital that is going to invest in the startups. And this new capital is actually more value add than the long tail of VC's.
01:02:02.780 - 01:02:03.444, Speaker A: That's right.
01:02:03.524 - 01:02:05.508, Speaker B: Because they're net promoters, they're users.
01:02:05.676 - 01:02:24.934, Speaker A: Okay, so if I asked. Oh, I shouldn't. I shouldn't name names. Okay, let's say you asked a founder, would you want Ansum as your investor, or do you want a tier one investor?
01:02:26.874 - 01:02:39.050, Speaker B: Okay, well, I would probably want both, but if I had to pick one, I would pick the tier one investor, tier one vc. But if it's a tier two, three, four or five, then I would pick ensemble.
01:02:39.162 - 01:03:09.470, Speaker A: Got it. So this will clean up a lot of the bad actors, I feel like, in this space, which is net positive to the industry, I think. What about icos? Why couldn't icos be just as good? Because now you have, I participate in many icos, so the ability to choose where you put your money and the outcome of that is also quite interesting. So why wouldn't this work just as well?
01:03:09.582 - 01:03:22.234, Speaker B: I mean, as long as it's compliant with SEC, sure it will definitely work. Like we already saw many of them two weeks ago with the Solana, the presale meta. It was ICO basically.
01:03:22.574 - 01:03:23.166, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:23.270 - 01:03:26.350, Speaker B: Well, ICO without pretending to build anything real.
01:03:26.462 - 01:03:52.574, Speaker A: Yeah. The last way I think that could work is buying a token that gives you exposure to and the token, or the DAO invests in startups on your behalf and the upsides, or the returns will get returned to the people that hold the token in some shape or form, whether it's through distributions or through buybacks.
01:03:52.734 - 01:03:54.674, Speaker B: Sounds familiar. Yeah.
01:03:55.094 - 01:04:20.540, Speaker A: What do you think about that could work. I like the idea of a token. I like Echo because you get to trust someone. You could put someone on the line for their reputation on the line. I also like that you could passively invest in a token that gives you returns periodically.
01:04:20.732 - 01:04:21.388, Speaker B: Yep.
01:04:21.516 - 01:04:33.204, Speaker A: The ICO platform is a little bit riskier, I think, but I feel like this is the next wave and it's going to happen very soon and a lot of tier two, three four vc's are probably going to be affected by it.
01:04:33.324 - 01:04:39.068, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the end game is they're going to get pushed out by the retail capital yes.
01:04:39.156 - 01:04:46.948, Speaker A: And if that happens, then what do you think the investor landscape is going to look like moving forward? What do you think it's going to look like? It's just going to be tier one and influencers and retail.
01:04:47.076 - 01:04:47.784, Speaker B: Yep.
01:04:48.924 - 01:04:52.128, Speaker A: And this phenomena is only happening crypto.
01:04:52.216 - 01:04:54.928, Speaker B: Crypto is at the forefront of capital formation.
01:04:54.976 - 01:05:04.024, Speaker A: So could this impact all of the other sectors in the world? AI as an example, or hard tech?
01:05:04.184 - 01:05:14.164, Speaker B: I mean, this has to get adopted by crypto natives first. Right. And then if it works, then eventually you can go into other industries. But that's more of a five to ten year thing, probably.
01:05:14.464 - 01:05:22.216, Speaker A: Cool. All right, well, there's a lot to look forward to, but, yeah, that's it for. Do you have anything else you want to talk about?
01:05:22.400 - 01:05:32.360, Speaker B: Last thing and we're done. The ETA for the Solana patch is April 15. They just tweeted it out a week from now.
01:05:32.512 - 01:05:35.164, Speaker A: Man, this guy's gonna be so upset.
01:05:36.704 - 01:05:49.144, Speaker B: Imagine the smell. The current quote, unquote, the current issue is not a design flaw. It is an implementation bug.
01:05:50.524 - 01:05:56.796, Speaker A: Sorry, Monique. 250 nine. But hopefully that's your answer.
01:05:56.940 - 01:05:57.572, Speaker B: Yep.
01:05:57.708 - 01:06:05.044, Speaker A: All right, well, thanks for tuning in. Hit us up next time and join our telegram if you haven't yet. Talk to you soon.
