00:00:00.250 - 00:00:04.190, Speaker A: Welcome to good game, your no BS Insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.250 - 00:00:14.394, Speaker B: People get this causation wrong. They think that I show Solana because I have Solana bags. It's like, no, no, I have Solana bags because I believe in Solana.
00:00:14.522 - 00:00:14.910, Speaker C: Okay?
00:00:14.980 - 00:00:45.782, Speaker B: And the reason I believe in Solana is because when I was obviously at Coinbase and I saw all these different chains, I saw like a disproportionate focus on the user and the customer experience and the product and how you didn't have to wait five, six years for the chain to scale. Because I don't have that long. Right. I don't know what I'm going to do in six years. I want to build things that help people today, not hope that they will be useful in some hypothetical future of mass adoption of billions of users. While we don't even have really a million users, I would say, or certainly not users, maybe farmers. So I don't know which one wins.
00:00:45.782 - 00:00:50.934, Speaker B: On a tangential point, I do think that entire meta is completely broken in nonsense.
00:00:51.062 - 00:00:57.594, Speaker D: I feel the same. I feel so jaded by the infrared bullshit that's happening right now. It's counterproductive. It's counterproductive to Ethereum.
00:00:57.642 - 00:01:00.222, Speaker A: And VCs are promoting this too. That's the annoying part.
00:01:00.276 - 00:01:08.370, Speaker B: Yeah. I like to call them out when they do. That hasn't been too helpful for me, but I think it kind of needs to be done a little bit. It needs to be done, yeah.
00:01:08.440 - 00:01:21.400, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto? Check out our request for startups list and get inspired at Alliance XYz ideas. Welcome to good game. Today we have Mert from a.
00:01:23.770 - 00:01:40.298, Speaker B: God. Yes. I woke up this morning and then I saw somebody actually made an account of the guy that they see is my special brother, this ox mu r t. And he's like drooling. So that was fun to wake up to.
00:01:40.384 - 00:01:48.960, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw that last night. And I think somebody from one of our startups replied and said, like, who did this?
00:01:49.410 - 00:01:56.546, Speaker B: When I posted, it was like 4K market cap. And now people have done some bad things to that token. Yeah, I think it went up to.
00:01:56.568 - 00:01:58.594, Speaker A: Like 500K or something crazy.
00:01:58.792 - 00:02:06.450, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't understand how this stuff works. I hold none, by the way, so I'm not behind this in any way. Awesome.
00:02:06.520 - 00:02:37.002, Speaker A: So we have Mert, the founder of Helios Labs, on. Obviously, if you know Mert, he is one of the largest proponents of Solana and its ecosystem, and we'll just dive deep into the upcoming trends that we're seeing. And there's a lot to do with modularity thesis versus monolithic MeV comparison between ETH and Solana Shikun trading, and maybe we could dive deep into the optimism sale and how we feel about that. But yeah, those are some of the things that are top of mind chow.
00:02:37.066 - 00:03:05.122, Speaker D: I mean, you mentioned pretty much everything. But I'm particularly curious about your view on Ethereum because obviously you are, like, in general, the Twitter image is different from your people's real image in real life, obviously you're in the Solana camp and you criticize east, but I'd love to hear you basically steelman Ethereum for our audience and make a fair comparison between Ethereum and Solana.
00:03:05.186 - 00:03:05.462, Speaker C: Sure.
00:03:05.516 - 00:03:21.210, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's quite easy to steal man Ethereum, just because that's why I first came to the industry to begin with at Coinbase. I was building on Ethereum, and Coinbase has like a few products, for example, like the NPC wallet, which is built on Ethereum. I helped build that.
00:03:21.280 - 00:03:23.130, Speaker C: When was that? Coinbase?
00:03:24.530 - 00:03:51.826, Speaker B: I joined about a few weeks before they went public. So like April 2021. And I was there for slightly over a year and. Yeah, so Ethereum, I'm kind of going to steal Anatole and his framing on this, which is that Ethereum kind of proved up the concept. They were first to market. They pioneered the entire thing of smart contract platforms and they obviously learned a lot during that time because they were the first. And when you ship to production, you learn a lot of lessons.
00:03:52.018 - 00:03:54.246, Speaker C: And they did that and they had.
00:03:54.268 - 00:04:15.470, Speaker B: To pivot a bunch of times. Right, like the merge and now this new roadmap with all the splurge and all the other. Yeah, and I think once you have a certain amount of activity on the chain, like the amount of TVL that they have and the amount of mind share they have, you kind of just structurally have to slow down.
00:04:15.620 - 00:04:15.982, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:16.036 - 00:04:56.666, Speaker B: Like there's no other option. That is kind of the curse of getting too big or just getting bigger in general, this happens with companies as well. And now they have to scale via offloading some components that Salana believes should be at the L one off chain or to L two s or other layers, et cetera. Now, my main criticism of this is that it's too early to do that. Not that it shouldn't be done at all. But if I were to steal my ethereum's case, they have a lot of activity. They're steering a trillion or very, very large ship and they have to do it to make such that everybody, they don't shoot themselves in the foot.
00:04:56.666 - 00:05:29.186, Speaker B: And using L two s is a relatively easy way to do that. Obviously, they are now adding 4844, which they're essentially building the L one to suit roll up. So it's like a semi modular, semi monolithic chain, right? Like, it's not either or. Currently, it's kind of in the middle. And I think that approach will work. Right? I think roll ups work. I think they make sense, and I think they specifically make a lot of sense for Ethereum, which doesn't have any other options other than to improve the L one, which is just going to be too risky to do at this point, in a drastic way, at least.
00:05:29.186 - 00:06:11.582, Speaker B: So I think for them, it makes a lot of sense. I think that's kind of the steel man, which is that the path that they took kind of makes it such that this path actually does make sense for them. Currently, I do think the structure of what they're doing has led to some side effects that I don't think are being acknowledged much. So, like l three s, for example, I do not care for those. And you can kind of see Vitalik maybe walking back a little bit. He made a post, I believe, like two weeks ago. He's about ten X less confident or something, or three x less confident that offloading everything to the L two was actually the right call, and that some of the things actually should be improved at the L one layer.
00:06:11.582 - 00:06:39.754, Speaker B: And the analogy I like to make for this is like, okay, so you make a race car, right, and you just whip out, whatever, some engine, and then you start optimizing the hell out of the wheels or the tires and the aerodynamics and all this. Okay, now that you've done that, physics now has caught up with you. You can't make the car go any faster. Now you have to upgrade the engine. But once you upgrade the engine now, all the other parts don't work in harmony. Now you have to change all those dependencies as well. Okay, so that's what I don't like, because I think that's going to happen.
00:06:39.872 - 00:07:14.486, Speaker D: So on that comment about Vitalik, honestly, I've been feeling the same way in the last year. Or know, I come from the ethereum world. My biggest bag is ETH. And so I can say this, I think that it was probably a mistake to offload everything to the layer two. And I say that from the point of view of a user. So Imran and I both Degen on chain every day we take calls from nine to one, and then after that, we start Djen on chain and try various products, like basically the entire afternoon, every single day. So we have a pretty good feeling for where the real, really good products are.
00:07:14.486 - 00:07:34.926, Speaker D: And I really think today Salana UX is a ten x improvement over Ethereum. And it's a combination of meaningfully lower fees and not having to bridge. It's really that simple. Bridging just causes me a lot of stress. And the fees, fees, I mean, for me it's okay, but for the masses, it's not going to be good.
00:07:35.028 - 00:07:39.386, Speaker A: Mean, the average person can't bridge. They don't even understand that concept.
00:07:39.498 - 00:07:40.480, Speaker C: I can't even.
00:07:41.170 - 00:08:10.546, Speaker B: Yeah, like my co host, we were talking because I also have my own podcast, Dan, who's like an analyst at Blockworks research. He was talking about how painful it was to bridge to all these different things. And he's an analyst, he does this most likely more than anybody. So my point has never been that roll ups are inherently bad, it's that they're being done too early. Especially if you take the point of view, like a longer time horizon. It's like, okay, crypto is going to be around for hundreds of years, decades, whatever. Some long time horizon.
00:08:10.546 - 00:08:43.474, Speaker B: And we're in smart contracts have been around since Ethereum. So like a few years. Why are we creating this much tech debt this early if we actually have a long time horizon? It doesn't really make sense. And yeah, I agree that Salana is a ten X improvement, obviously, right now. And the interesting part about that is it does that while also itself being quite broken right now. Salana is half not working right now, and it's still quite impressive. And the reason I say that is because, okay, if that were to be fixed, what would the difference be then at that point, at the L one.
00:08:43.592 - 00:08:44.260, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:44.870 - 00:08:59.366, Speaker D: So you actually predicted at the end of the last year that Salana was going to go down at least once this year. Do you still have the same prediction for the upcoming year or two? And if so, why is that, like, on a technical level, what makes you think that way?
00:08:59.468 - 00:09:28.430, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it'll go down again. Actually, I don't think this. I have 100% conviction that it will go down again in the next year. And there's multiple reasons, but the gist of it is that there are a lot of changes that are proposed for the base layer, that are massive changes. So obviously fire dancer is one. Like an entirely new validator client is a huge deal. If you rewrite the entire stack in a different language with new people, you're going to miss something in there that's going to cause a bug.
00:09:28.430 - 00:10:02.890, Speaker B: It might be like a very small bug, like an insanely tiny bug. But the problem is, Solana validators, once they detect something is off, they'll just stop on purpose because they prioritize safety over liveness. And so they'll just stop. And then that's like, for example, currently the fees are relatively broken, and there's kind of two things we can do to fix that, or we're doing to fix that. One is like when you send a transaction, the transaction gets scheduled by literally the scheduler, and it's kind of jittery right now. So there's some randomness inherent in that process. And in the next release, 1.18,
00:10:02.890 - 00:10:31.342, Speaker B: it's being reworked totally to be more deterministic. It's like, okay, that's going to be great for the chain once it works, but will it work without any bugs whatsoever? Obviously, we all like to think yes, but I've done software long enough to know that all software is somewhat broken on some level. And then there's also other people, like Fireday, insert, and maybe margin finance, who are not satisfied with the networking protocol on Solana. So everybody knows TCP and UDP and whatnot.
00:10:31.406 - 00:10:32.034, Speaker C: Or most.
00:10:32.072 - 00:10:54.538, Speaker B: Second people would at least Solana uses something called quick, which is like Google's version, and people don't like that, and they want to rewrite it. And it's like, okay, if they do rewrite that in a better way, it will help the network for sure. And that's what makes Salana on the bleeding edge at all times. But that's a huge change, and it's very hard to make changes like that and guarantee that nothing will go wrong whatsoever.
00:10:54.714 - 00:11:07.966, Speaker D: Regarding fire dancer, two questions. One, do you have a timeline for when it'll happen? And two, what's your estimated PPS throughput improvement?
00:11:08.078 - 00:11:16.930, Speaker B: I think estimate. I know the team, so I don't want to stress them out too much, but let's say early next year. Early next year probably seems reasonable enough.
00:11:17.080 - 00:11:17.394, Speaker C: Okay.
00:11:17.432 - 00:11:54.538, Speaker B: And then the TPS question is super. Actually much more difficult than it sounds, because at the end of the day, block space is a market, and I'm basically trying to predict a market here. It'll depend on how complex the transactions are, right? Like transactions might have different compute units, which might affect TPS. It'll depend on the economics for bots. So currently on Salana, you can span the chain for pretty cheap, I would say, and you don't really get punished. Tolly is now adding a new, or propose adding a new mechanism called SiMD 110, which makes that super expensive. If that goes live, that totally affects the TPS.
00:11:54.538 - 00:12:28.758, Speaker B: But okay, but that's kind of maybe the nuanced long term boring answer. Maybe the lizard rate answer is I would expect like ten K TPS or something in that range within a few months. Yes, within a few months of it releasing. And then the question is because the fire dancer actually will reduce hardware requirements somewhat. And it's like, okay, will it be such that more people at lower hardware requirements now validate the network? Or with this new improvement, will people increase their hardware requirements even more? Because that part's not clear to me. It's also not clear how the rollout will happen. So there's a lot of uncertainty.
00:12:28.758 - 00:12:46.658, Speaker B: But the part I like fired answer is much not really because of the performance, but because of security. Once it goes live, then we can kind of sleep slightly safer at night, knowing that if there is a catastrophic bug in the salon rust client, we have something to back up to and we don't have to spend like a month rebuilding stuff.
00:12:46.744 - 00:13:22.538, Speaker D: Okay, so that's why, just to compliment on what you said. So Ethereum with 48 44. Two months ago, when I talked to the Ethereum folks, a lot of them were bearish, 48 44. But if you look at the prediction market today on how much 48 44 will reduce fees, it's quite a bit. It's like ten to 100 x. So if the prediction market actually plays out, then basically in two weeks, ethereum layer two should be on the same order of magnitude as Salana in terms of fees. But then with fire dancer, Salana becomes the bleeding edge again.
00:13:22.538 - 00:13:24.682, Speaker D: So we'll see. It's going to be very interesting to see.
00:13:24.736 - 00:13:53.938, Speaker B: I don't think 4844 will result in 100 x improvements. I think the prediction market is a fun thing to play with, but the liquidity behind those things is I'm not going to use them to make any conclusions. I saw the optimism team did, and then I also saw that the scroll and polygon teams both were like, actually, this is maybe a little overrated and it's not going to be that good. So it seems like there's some disagreement there as well. And so I have a prediction about this as well, but we'll see how it plays out. I do think 4844 is a little overplayed.
00:13:54.034 - 00:13:56.402, Speaker D: What's your prediction on the fee reduction?
00:13:56.546 - 00:14:35.598, Speaker B: I think for sure it'll reduce fees. Right. Just by structure of the technical concept there, but okay, when that happened in some other chains people just did encryptions and just filled it up. Will that happen? And if that does happen, what happens? Will they increase the blob space, or will people use celestia or eigen layer? Like, what's going to happen there? So there's a lot of variables. And by the way, these Altus are still, I believe most of them are still single threaded. Like the fee for the roll ups might change, but the fee for the users, it's not super clear what that will look like if there's a huge, hot, congested mint that's still going to affect the Dexes because it's not localized. There's no hotspot contention or isolation.
00:14:35.694 - 00:15:21.118, Speaker A: Going back to your earlier point regarding bridging, we're starting to see a lot of consumer apps, and there's a thesis out there, especially in the Ethereum community, that consumer apps that are built native on layer twos can capture their own mindshare users without the worry about liquidity. And you're seeing this with Fronttech as an example, right? Frontech, you could easily onboard to base and easily send ETH to your wallet and then start to interact in Frontek. You're also seeing this on fantasy, which is launched on Blast, which is kind of like a social trading app. And so there is also another thesis that's separate from this, which is consumer adoption. Consumer apps that are built for consumers can also bring in a whole sleuth of users. What are your thoughts on that narrative?
00:15:21.214 - 00:15:41.814, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think that's correct. I think that is what will happen. Now, the question is, where will those apps be built? And will they be built on baseblast or something like a Solana? And if I look at the concentration of talent today, it's being built on Solana. So you guys obviously know Tensor, but Tensor, Mageeden, phantom drip.
00:15:41.942 - 00:15:42.282, Speaker C: Right?
00:15:42.336 - 00:15:55.598, Speaker B: There's a lot of helium hive, Mapper. There's a lot of consumer talent that's building on Solana. And it's like, okay, I agree with the premise that obviously consumer will be the best people just onboard directly to there. Especially with something like a base.
00:15:55.684 - 00:15:55.934, Speaker C: Right?
00:15:55.972 - 00:16:42.378, Speaker B: Like you're on Coinbase and you can directly on ramp to base. That's easy, assuming you have Coinbase, which international people surprisingly don't really use Coinbase as much, especially. Which is actually pretty under discussed, I think. But, okay, so then the question is, like, if I'm a consumer app, where am I going to build? I don't feel that they would build on an L two on pure technical merit today. I think it would have to be because of incentives or some sort of political alignment, ethereum alignment, because, one, your margins as a business are just going to be worse by an order of magnitude, at least even with 4844, your margins are going to be worse. For example, drip subsidizes the cost for their users to mint on Salana, you can mint like a million NFTs for $100. You cannot do this on any l two, not even close.
00:16:42.378 - 00:17:02.766, Speaker B: But the general idea I'm trying to convey is that the margins on Salana will make a huge difference. But then also there's a lot of other stuff on chain that you can kind of compose with on Salana, whereas on Ethereum, if you built on base, it's not so straightforward to compose with Blast or another l two, as opposed to something else, just as a contract on Salana.
00:17:02.878 - 00:17:43.286, Speaker A: So there's a narrative, which you tweeted about, and you mentioned it earlier, which is layer threes. And the narrative is actually quite strong on arbitrum. So arbitrum launched kind of a layer three component called zai Xai, which is currently valid at a billion dollar valuation in the public markets. And there's tons of games that are building on layer threes. And the reason why they're building these games on layer threes is the fact that they're getting grants, and they're using these grants as a way to subsidize the cost that you mentioned. And it's turning out to be a positive flywheel from what I'm hearing and reading. And so this is happening on optimism.
00:17:43.286 - 00:18:21.210, Speaker A: This is also happening on arbitrum and base as well, launched layer threes using arbitrum. So there's this interesting kind of way where they're using tokens from all of these kind of networks, from optimism to arbitrum, et cetera. And that's trickling down to Zai. And Zai now has a token. Now they're using that also as a bounty to reward layer threes to build on their app. And what they bring in return is grant money, a ton of it, and then also some existing community that will automatically use these apps moving forward. So that's kind of what's happening in the layer three world.
00:18:21.210 - 00:18:22.602, Speaker A: So what do you think about that?
00:18:22.656 - 00:19:07.510, Speaker B: I think a lot of people disagree with me on this, actually, people from salon as well. But I just think paying people to use your stuff is really stupid, because basically you're just causing a reality distortion field where you don't know what's real and what's not. Real. Are people using your thing because it's really good and because they really need it, or just because you're paying them for it? And you can't really listen to what they say with their answers either, because they're also now biased with different incentives. So I actually asked this to Tolli a few months ago, I believe, on my podcast, and I was like, so what do you think about Polygon BD? Because I actually called out Polygon BD like two years ago or something about like, okay, here's the difference between the two chains. Solana, or Polygon pays people to use the chain versus people pay Solana to use the chain. In terms of BD and like, sandeep and stuff, that's when all the Twitter drama.
00:19:07.510 - 00:19:27.342, Speaker B: But, like, now you look at it and it's like it's kind of played out. And basically the philosophy is if you build something so good, people should be paying you to use it, you shouldn't have to pay them to use it. Now, obviously, if you want to bootstrap some sort of ecosystem, like a gaming ecosystem, you have other tools at your disposal, like tokens. Okay, sure, go ahead. Maybe that'll help align incentives.
00:19:27.486 - 00:19:27.890, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:27.960 - 00:20:22.510, Speaker B: And if it's done for purely aligning incentives, okay, but just based on what I've seen from the tech, the tech will not get there for, let's say, three to four years. When does dank sharding go live? Right? That's not going to be for a while. So then maybe, are they going to use celestia? Are they going to use eigen layer? Are they going to use Polygon avail? There's so many different complex questions there. So I do think it's kind of a gamble. It's like, okay, I'm building on this chain because they're paying me, or I don't know if I call an l three a chain, but I'm building on this l three because they're paying me. But will it work? And will my product be affected as a result? So I obviously run an infra company, and I've received a lot of DMs, and I still continue to receive a lot of DMs from teams building on l two s or other chains coming over to Salana because their stuff just doesn't work there. Now, the spots where it does work, I don't think actually games need to be built on Solana necessarily.
00:20:22.510 - 00:20:38.454, Speaker B: I don't think most games need globally shared state. I think isolated state for some games is totally fine. In that case, if the tool is right for what you're trying to achieve, do it. It doesn't matter what you're using, what chain you're using for that, but make sure the tool is right first, because the token price can only hide that for so long.
00:20:38.572 - 00:20:41.654, Speaker D: When do you expect to see a layer two on Salana?
00:20:41.702 - 00:20:43.414, Speaker B: Like an l two that settles on Salana.
00:20:43.462 - 00:20:45.850, Speaker A: Are you insinuating Drip's tweet the other day?
00:20:45.920 - 00:20:47.130, Speaker C: Yes. Okay.
00:20:47.200 - 00:20:57.626, Speaker B: So I actually run drips. Drips and fry. I talked to them. I know the context of that tweet. Basically, Vib is not happy with the congestion on Salana, which he shouldn't be. It does suck. Which is what I said earlier.
00:20:57.626 - 00:21:21.798, Speaker B: It's half broken. All two is on Salana. So, I mean, there are two SVM rollups that settle on. Well, actually, one's not live, but SVM roll ups that are going to settle on Ethereum. I've actually talked to teams who want to use Solana as a DA layer as well. So that's the two, let's say, heads of the modular thing. Now, the third one is, okay, will people settle on, you know, there's like, code, which is that payments app which kind of uses it, Solana, for this.
00:21:21.798 - 00:21:48.560, Speaker B: They're like a soft sequencer where they just settle payments at the end of the day or at the end of n intervals. So it kind of is already using it as an l two. But when do I expect. I actually was asked this question by VC yesterday, I believe, and I think within, like, seven, eight months, purely due to market conditions. Right. I think the market will take up and people are like, I bet I could raise money from this because I'm the first to market here. Right?
00:21:51.570 - 00:21:57.314, Speaker D: Every VC I know is pushing their portfolio company to go from a DAP to a layer two.
00:21:57.352 - 00:21:59.630, Speaker B: Now it re rates their valuation.
00:21:59.790 - 00:22:01.086, Speaker A: It re rates their valuation.
00:22:01.198 - 00:22:01.762, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:22:01.896 - 00:22:06.420, Speaker A: It's all what it is. I mean, just like spinning up another AWS server, right?
00:22:07.030 - 00:22:07.346, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:07.368 - 00:22:19.366, Speaker D: But there should be an economic reason. Like, if Salana gets really congested and the fees go up by ten x during a peak bull market, there would be an economic reason for someone like tensor to do a layer two, right?
00:22:19.468 - 00:22:45.074, Speaker B: Yeah. The question is, these fixes, proposed fixes to Mainnet, when will they actually land? If they're going to land in a reasonable time frame such that teams don't need to do this and they can stick it out, then, okay, they can wait. But if it's going to be such that it's two years, then obviously it doesn't make sense. And I would probably advise them to just not use salon Mainet at that point, but we won't let it get there. We yell it totally enough.
00:22:45.192 - 00:22:56.974, Speaker A: So if, let's say, a Jupiter or like a top five Salana app goes layer two, do you think the Salana cabal would be happy or upset? And how would they react?
00:22:57.102 - 00:22:57.810, Speaker C: An L two.
00:22:57.880 - 00:23:00.354, Speaker A: What kind of l two that settles on Salana.
00:23:00.402 - 00:23:14.582, Speaker B: Okay, so if Jupiter were to become an l two that settles on Salana, I do think people would be okay with that. I think they'd be relatively whatever. I think Tolly would obviously have his thoughts about how it's not necessary.
00:23:14.726 - 00:23:15.754, Speaker C: But then he has like a different.
00:23:15.792 - 00:23:35.326, Speaker B: Time horizon than Jupiter, for example. So I think that's fine. I think what people wouldn't like is if the l two was selling on Ethereum using something other than Sol just because of bag allegiances. I don't think I would personally care too much. Just get the job done. That's all I really care about. You saw it with eclipse, right? When eclipse launched.
00:23:35.326 - 00:24:16.714, Speaker B: The problem with this is that it's not an isolated idea like channel. It's like if Salana people feel neutral about it, but then like bankless tweets like, oh, Salana is going to die now because there's an l two now they're going to get mad that people are saying this and they're going to hate just from necessity. They're going to hate the l two based on what they think they should feel, which I saw this happen because I think one of the mainstay guys was like, oh, Salana is going to die because of l two s. And then now salon people started hating the l two. And I'm like, no, the l two is a good thing for Salana because it spreads the usage of SVM tech and it's open source tech. That's what you want. But when Twitter and money are involved, things do tend to get lost in translation.
00:24:16.842 - 00:24:35.926, Speaker A: So Chow tweeted this a couple of weeks ago, and I still think about this to this day, which is when you have layer twos that launch your own token, then there's a DA layer that launches his own token, then the app launches his own, or then maybe a layer three will launch his own token, and then the app itself will launch a token. So you have all these and the.
00:24:35.948 - 00:24:39.350, Speaker D: Sequencer and the restaking espresso.
00:24:39.690 - 00:25:24.738, Speaker A: And the question is, if your users are mostly farmers, which is true, then they're going to figure out where are they going to spend the most time, right? And today there's two places. One is shitcoining on Solana, right? And obviously, like Tensor and all the other great products that sit around that ecosystem, then you have farming opportunities with Eigen layer and all the other kind of infrastructure projects that are out there. And given when Celestia launched, I mean, to be quite frank, I was surprised it went from a billion to $17 billion. That caught me off guard. And so people are seeing that kind of, like, wealth effect, and they're like, well, I want to catch an X, Celestia. And so they're spending a lot of time on the infrastructure side. So the question is comparing these two.
00:25:24.738 - 00:25:33.750, Speaker A: It seems like at the end of the day, it's like you're competing to acquire users. The question then is which one wins out and how does it win out?
00:25:33.820 - 00:25:52.442, Speaker B: Well, I don't think they're actually competing to acquire users. Right. I've tweeted about this quite a few times that I don't think those are users. I don't know what to even classify those people. Just farmers is fine, I guess. But as a founder, your market is not the set of people who want to make money. That's not a market.
00:25:52.442 - 00:26:24.774, Speaker B: That's just humanity. That's everybody who's ever lived. You need to segment your market correctly to begin with. And if you segment it such that people who want to make money, you're not going to get PMF, because what is your market? What is your product? So I think, first of all, you need to get very clear on who your market is, who the ideal customer segment is. I think Jito did this super well. I was staking on Jito before I thought they even were going to do an airdrop. I didn't know how if they would do a token and I was already using it, and then they airdropped like a few months after.
00:26:24.774 - 00:26:49.214, Speaker B: And then now I'm actually interested in the governance proposals that they put up, because now I have some stake. So now I'm their user. I actually use them now, and they targeted me correctly. If you compare to the airdrop farming meta thing, I think it's just like spray and pray versus spray and pray. I don't know which one of those wins because none of them are doing in a calculated or methodical way. If you show us, like, Jeff Bezos or some web two CEO, they'd be like, what the hell is happening here?
00:26:49.252 - 00:26:49.406, Speaker C: Right?
00:26:49.428 - 00:27:08.046, Speaker B: Like, you guys haven't segmented anything properly. You're just throwing money at people and seeing who bites. And so I don't know which one wins there because I don't think they're even playing the same game. Obviously I'm biased, but people get this causation wrong. They think that I show Solana because I have bags. It's like, no, no, I have Solana bags because I believe in Solana.
00:27:08.158 - 00:27:08.578, Speaker C: Okay?
00:27:08.664 - 00:27:46.702, Speaker B: And the reason I believe in Solana is because when I was obviously at Coinbase and I saw all these different chains, I saw like a disproportionate focus on the user and the customer experience and the product and how you didn't have to wait five, six years for the chain to scale. Because I don't have that long. I don't know what I'm going to do in six years. I want to build things that help people today, not hope that they will be useful in some hypothetical future of mass adoption of billions of users. While we don't even have really a million users, I would say, or certainly not users, maybe farmers. So I don't know which one wins. On a tangential point, I do think that entire meta is completely broken in nonsense.
00:27:46.846 - 00:27:51.682, Speaker D: I feel the same. I feel so jaded by the infrared bullshit that's happening right now.
00:27:51.736 - 00:27:52.526, Speaker C: It's counterproductive.
00:27:52.558 - 00:27:54.142, Speaker D: It's counterproductive to Ethereum.
00:27:54.286 - 00:27:57.186, Speaker A: And vcs are promoting this too. That's the annoying part.
00:27:57.288 - 00:27:57.602, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:57.656 - 00:28:04.166, Speaker B: I like to call them out when they do. That hasn't been too helpful for me. But I think it kind of needs to be done a lot.
00:28:04.188 - 00:28:05.238, Speaker C: It needs to be done.
00:28:05.404 - 00:28:07.458, Speaker D: But you raised around recently, right, Mert?
00:28:07.554 - 00:28:10.054, Speaker C: I did. Congrats on the round. Thanks.
00:28:10.092 - 00:28:13.578, Speaker B: Yeah, I actually raised it before breakpoint and before the price went up, and.
00:28:13.584 - 00:28:14.586, Speaker C: I was like, I'm going to help.
00:28:14.608 - 00:28:19.050, Speaker B: The ecosystem be able to raise money and whatnot. But then the price went up and everybody started raising.
00:28:20.530 - 00:28:27.130, Speaker D: I imagine you make quite a bit of revenue. I don't know if you're cash flow positive yet, but sounds like you're.
00:28:27.290 - 00:29:10.634, Speaker B: Yeah, we do make money. I try to run the company in as much web two way as possible with tried and true non 0% interest rate. Like, if you look at our cap table actually, you'll see that it's pretty like web two and people who were around before 0% interest rates, who didn't get weird muddy advice, who don't give muddy advice. And so I do believe that it's super important that you're able to generate real revenue as a crypto company. And then you can progressively decentralize, right? Because you can't just run RPCs and be centralized forever. That wouldn't really make sense. I think like Moxie has a post on this from signal from two years ago, right? It doesn't make sense.
00:29:10.634 - 00:29:15.882, Speaker B: And Infuria is kind of doing this now. They got PMF, they have a lot of users. Now they're looking at decentralizing.
00:29:16.026 - 00:29:17.470, Speaker C: Same thing with. Right.
00:29:17.540 - 00:29:30.126, Speaker B: Like, at first we want to iterate as much as possible, move super fast, and once stuff starts ossifying a little bit more over x time horizon, then we can look at decentralizing and making it part of the network.
00:29:30.238 - 00:29:31.534, Speaker A: Wait, so there's a token?
00:29:31.662 - 00:30:02.374, Speaker B: I don't know if it'll be a token. There might be a token. There's other ways to decentralize, right? There's many other ways to decentralize. For example, email is decentralized, it's a protocol. And I tweet something to the extent of which infra tokens have been pulled off successfully a few times per year, and currently I haven't seen too many. I think some people have ptsd from the graph, which is a good company, but not sure if the tokens really work that well there. So not decided.
00:30:02.374 - 00:30:03.998, Speaker B: I know it has to decentralize, but.
00:30:04.084 - 00:30:05.246, Speaker C: Do you use a token to help.
00:30:05.268 - 00:30:07.434, Speaker B: With decentralization or not? I haven't decided.
00:30:07.562 - 00:30:31.542, Speaker A: Infura, I mean, a while ago started disabling users from sanctioned companies, right. Or sanctioned countries. I think I saw a tweet somewhere about Iran and other places. How are you thinking about it when you decentralized, are you going to take more of a regulatory first approach? Are you thinking about just more like crypto native decentralization first? How are you weighing the options there?
00:30:31.676 - 00:31:00.720, Speaker B: Well, currently I obviously have to do what is required of a US based company. There's not really a choice there. You just do what the law requires you to do. But obviously I'm in this industry because I believe in crypto and some of the values that come along with it, such as liberty, freedom, et cetera. And so the end goal certainly will be to get as close to that as humanly possible. So if that were to happen, I'd be super unhappy about it. I try my hardest to make sure it doesn't happen, but ultimately you have to obey the law, obviously.
00:31:00.720 - 00:31:26.614, Speaker B: But maybe going forward there's other like, for example, Coinbase obviously has to comply with regulations and laws, but they can also go and change, ask for change, go to court, all these things, right? And so I think it's tough, and I do think this is partly why most talent is leaving the US in some mean. I'm in Canada, so actually, it's kind of really weird here. Actually, tensor is from Canada, too, so you guys would know.
00:31:26.732 - 00:31:36.090, Speaker D: Half of alliance is Canadians. I'm canadian. Jacob's Canadian, will's canadian. Half the research team is canadian.
00:31:36.990 - 00:31:37.674, Speaker C: Nice. Yeah.
00:31:37.712 - 00:31:55.102, Speaker B: So, I mean, you guys must have seen that in Ontario, like, what was a year and a half ago or something, like trading over thirty k of anything but bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, or ETH. Classic, I believe is not permitted on Ontario exchanges. I thought that was hilarious.
00:31:55.246 - 00:32:19.938, Speaker A: I wanted to touch on a couple of things. One is you mentioned the MeV comparison on Ethereum versus Salana recently. I think one of the validators made, like, $340,000 on a trade, which was insane by accident. But I noticed something else, which is like, Jito started earning more fees than Salana, at least that one day.
00:32:19.964 - 00:32:20.202, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:20.256 - 00:32:32.166, Speaker A: And you had some thoughts around it. I'd like to hear your thoughts on that versus Ethereum, obviously, because Ethereum, it's the opposite. Right? Fees mostly accrue to Ethereum and then MeV afterwards.
00:32:32.278 - 00:33:06.646, Speaker B: Yeah, but those fees are actually generally from MVB activity on Ethereum. Like, Jared from Subway is a core contributor to people's bags. I would. Mev scene is very interesting because Solana, by default, doesn't have a mempool. I'm not sure how technical the audience here would be, but so, obviously, without a mempool, Mev would be pretty difficult. So what Jito has done is they approached Solana, the client, the software client, and they've added a mempool. And people seem to maybe try to villainize Jeeto here a bit.
00:33:06.646 - 00:33:20.214, Speaker B: But I think that's nonsense because this actually used to happen. Unofficially, people would have these deals with validators and unofficial channels like, hey, I'll pay you x if you do X with your validator. Like block packing. Like a bribe.
00:33:20.342 - 00:33:20.970, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:21.120 - 00:33:50.630, Speaker B: And so now it's democratized, or at least it's on the path to being more democratized, right? So Mev, like, some random l ones, will reply, guy me and be like, oh, Mev is robbery. We've eliminated. It's like, no, you haven't. You just don't have any activity to cause Mev. Or you've randomized block packing, which incentivizes spam. So you haven't eliminated anything. And then the question is, okay, if Mev can't be eliminated, what can you do with it? Well, obviously you can democratize it.
00:33:50.630 - 00:34:34.114, Speaker B: You can make it such that it's aligned with the incentives of validators such that validator economics are better and that it's happening. Right. So, for example, you gave the example of a validator yesterday, was tipped like 330, $40,000, granted for a faulty trade because somebody was trying to game jeto. But that's a lot of cash for just existing as a validator on the network. And I think one thing that's happened is the ecosystem integrations are lagging. So that is to say, if you go to a Dex and the slippage rating by default is relatively high, that slippage rating is basically what you will get, because people will take advantage of that discrepancy, and you will get a worse price. So I think as long as you're aware of that, it should be okay.
00:34:34.114 - 00:35:01.318, Speaker B: But people just aren't aware of it, because MeV is pretty new on Solana. Sharecoin season kind of just happened all of a sudden within the last month. So I think after some education, some better integrations, deeper liquidity, and I'm also working with Jito to potentially look at an MEV protected RPC for people who obviously want to be protected against that. So once those steps are taken, I think the state of the ecosystem will improve in terms of MeV.
00:35:01.414 - 00:35:05.154, Speaker A: Oh, that would be nice. MEV protected RPC for Solana.
00:35:05.222 - 00:35:05.550, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:35:05.620 - 00:35:10.414, Speaker A: So it would just go straight. The transactions would just go to Jito's mempool and then process from there.
00:35:10.452 - 00:35:10.750, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:10.820 - 00:35:16.830, Speaker B: You would send to Jito, and then Jito would be basically, you trust them to not put it into the mempool.
00:35:17.270 - 00:35:20.450, Speaker A: Okay, so it's like a private mempool of sort?
00:35:20.520 - 00:35:20.850, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:35:20.920 - 00:35:34.930, Speaker B: Well, Solana doesn't have a mempool, so they would just skip the mempool altogether. There is other ways you can do it. Like, you can actually just land a jeto, bundle yourself as the RPC provider, but that gets super expensive. And Solana hardware margins are, let's say, not so great to begin with, so that'd be kind of tough.
00:35:35.010 - 00:35:48.454, Speaker D: I wanted to go back to some of the bullshit that you've seen recently. I know you call out on a few on Twitter as well, but why don't we call out the bullshit? Anything related to fundraises or projects or narratives that you've seen recently.
00:35:48.582 - 00:35:49.580, Speaker B: Oh, man.
00:35:51.390 - 00:35:53.470, Speaker A: I think one you called out was optimism.
00:35:53.890 - 00:35:55.854, Speaker D: Well, you called out optimism for what?
00:35:55.892 - 00:36:29.638, Speaker B: Yeah, I call it optimism quite frequently. I do like Ryan a bit, which sucks, but he joined after, so not my fault. Yeah. So one of the things that I really didn't like recently, and it's generally been centered around Adam. Adam C tweeted something like, well, base is going to win because Coinbase and such and such. And basically my tweet was like, I think you severely overestimate how fast these large public companies can move versus missionary startups. Right.
00:36:29.638 - 00:36:50.554, Speaker B: And I was referring to arbitram because I think arbitrum has moved super fast. They have proofs working in production, which seems to be a quite big differentiating factor. Their multi sig that governs the L two is not anonymous arbitram or optimism is. And they have things like orbit and these l three integrations. They have stylus.
00:36:50.682 - 00:36:51.118, Speaker C: Right?
00:36:51.204 - 00:37:33.174, Speaker B: They have more of the activity. And so then I looked at that and I was like, why would coinbase go with optimism instead of something like arbitrum, which is more advanced, technically, has more traction, has more users, all this stuff, it's been battle tested more. And then obviously the answer is alignment. Right. Anyways, that caused some, let's say, Twitter debates. So I didn't like that, how people were picking, like, in a space that's supposed to be valuing security and decentralization. Above all, people are still going back to their ways of like, oh, they gave me a lot of money, so I'm going to use it, even though it's much worse tech, that's going to not be as good for users, especially as the biggest player in the crypto.
00:37:33.174 - 00:37:44.990, Speaker B: That's not to say I don't like Coinbase. I love Coinbase. They are my biggest hold in terms of public markets, by a ton. I'll leave it at that. I don't think they approach the l two thing is how I would approach personally.
00:37:45.070 - 00:37:45.426, Speaker C: And then.
00:37:45.448 - 00:38:00.594, Speaker B: Yeah, optimism. I think yesterday there was like a forum post about how they sold like 100 million. The token is, I think, 19.5 million tokens or something. I forget the exact number. I think it was 20.5.
00:38:00.712 - 00:38:00.965, Speaker C: Yeah, I.
00:38:00.965 - 00:38:03.398, Speaker A: It think was like $20 million or $100 million.
00:38:03.484 - 00:38:06.262, Speaker B: The actual dollar value in the market is like $100 million.
00:38:06.316 - 00:38:07.110, Speaker A: $100 million.
00:38:07.180 - 00:38:07.558, Speaker C: Okay.
00:38:07.644 - 00:38:13.178, Speaker B: Yeah. But they sold it to an undisclosed buyer at undisclosed terms, and nobody knows anything.
00:38:13.344 - 00:38:16.474, Speaker A: Second time, by the way. Yeah, a year and a half ago.
00:38:16.592 - 00:39:03.590, Speaker B: I didn't know that. It's like, what exactly is the point of this token? Are people governing? Did anybody vote on this? What's happening here? So you combine that with a multi sig that's anonymous, nobody knows who's on the multi sig, and the fact that there's no fraud proofs. So if somebody just does something funky on the chain. Who's going to challenge it? Nobody, because the proofs don't exist. So now you cascaded or stacked these ridiculous trust assumptions, and then now you're using all of that and you're saying, this is the future of France, and you're, let's say, talking down to not just Solana, but like, it's like, I don't understand the intellectual inconsistency there. So that bugs me. And I talk about it frequently.
00:39:03.590 - 00:39:46.950, Speaker B: Another thing I saw yesterday or two days ago, and I'm not going to name the team because I think they're a good team. I think they mean well. But it was something like somebody raised around. And on the top left, it was like the modular chain for X trading. And then I was like, why the hell are you including the term modular in your company slogan, right? If your entire purpose is to enable better trading? I don't just say the microservice powered Twitter. Okay, I don't need to say this because what matters is the product, the customer experience. So if you're just adding the term modular to your product, I'm going to doubt your intentions there, that you actually care about the user as much as what that name itself enables for your bags.
00:39:47.850 - 00:40:17.202, Speaker D: I think the whole modular narrative is getting out of control. And frankly, that goes back to my original comment about Ethereum going to layer two as a mistake. So if you really think about it, all these new things that are happening to be it, layer twos restaking. Well, not restaking. Layer twos, da share sequencer. All these things are tech debt from the fact that the layer one doesn't scale. If the layer one scales, you don't need these things, at least not now.
00:40:17.256 - 00:40:17.426, Speaker C: Right?
00:40:17.448 - 00:40:33.606, Speaker D: Like, Salana doesn't need these things. Yet all these things happen because of the inability to scale at the base layer. And then with all these things come with a new narrative, which is the modular and then tokens and airdrops and that stuff.
00:40:33.788 - 00:40:58.880, Speaker A: Okay, I agree with that. But if Solana is getting congested, right, I mean, there's already, like, people talking about layer twos on Salana, and it's like the Overton window slowly moving towards the world of modularity. Could there be a world where Solana turns out to be an Ethereum's position, where you see different layer twos and this kind of modular ecosystem being built around Solana? Is that a world that we could see?
00:40:59.570 - 00:41:28.290, Speaker B: Depends who you ask. I think Anitoli would disagree with that, because he doesn't think once you've isolated the hotspots. It doesn't like, what is the roll up going to do? That's kind of his belief. I would say. Again, going back to the beginning of this episode, I'm not against roll ups or l two s at all. What I'm against is premature optimization on an industry where your time horizon is supposed to be much longer than this. And then people use the example of JavaScript was built in ten days with somebody who's done just severe amounts of coffee or drugs.
00:41:28.290 - 00:41:55.558, Speaker B: And it's like, okay, that's like a totally different thing. That's a programming language with a lot of people working on it. There's no security assumptions, et cetera. So, okay, the question is, could Salana be in that position? It's like, yeah, absolutely. But Salana already does much more TPs at about six orders of magnitude less fees than ethereum. About 5 million was when I looked last. So even that as a starting point, if you were to do l two s on top of Salana, those l two s are already giving a much better spot.
00:41:55.674 - 00:41:56.242, Speaker C: Right?
00:41:56.376 - 00:42:42.654, Speaker B: I do think the only reason you would use ethereum today is take advantage of the existing liquidity and network effects of the assets and the users. That seems to be like the best chase for using ethereum. To me on Solana. I think what the sequence of events is roughly, you fix the bot problem, you fix the non deterministic transaction problem. Once you do that, and then you add fired answer, which optimizes everything from the ground up, you then have some idea of the absolute limits of how much you can push this thing. Okay, once you understand this, you can either add more cores or increase hardware requirements, or do something on the vertical side, or you can start maybe adding some asynchronous execution stuff, which you can actually do directly on the L one. You don't need an L two for this.
00:42:42.654 - 00:42:55.774, Speaker B: Or you can just do an l two. It's a permissionless network. People can do whatever they want. If they want to do an L two, go ahead. Code has already done it. I think I'm one of the only ones. I'm totally fine with L two s being on Salana.
00:42:55.774 - 00:43:23.162, Speaker B: I don't think Tolius, because obviously his vision is a global state machine where information is synced asap as fast physics allows. That's what he wants to build. It remains to be seen if that is kind of the biggest market for people who will actually build on Solana. So there's some market conditions, obviously, but I think it'd be fine. But again, the main point I want to get across is that the premature optimization is what's annoying. And maybe we're wrong on l two s, but are we also wrong on l three s?
00:43:23.216 - 00:43:23.434, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:23.472 - 00:43:40.530, Speaker B: Like, why are we now going to l three s? Especially if italic is talking about how, if l two s were possibly a mistake to offload everything to them, why are we now offloading stuff to l three s? And Starknet actually has a blog post where they have l four s for privacy. I'm not kidding. You can look this up.
00:43:40.600 - 00:43:49.486, Speaker A: It's all a narrative. And it seems like the two hottest narratives right now in crypto is meme coins and AI and meme coins.
00:43:49.598 - 00:43:50.166, Speaker C: All right.
00:43:50.268 - 00:43:52.166, Speaker D: AI is a meme coin as well.
00:43:52.268 - 00:43:54.374, Speaker B: Exactly. And I guess maybe we could touch.
00:43:54.412 - 00:44:02.170, Speaker A: A bit on that if you'd like. Is, what do you think about crypto and AI? Is it legit? Is it a meme? Is it ahead of its cycle?
00:44:05.550 - 00:44:35.766, Speaker B: I majored math. I did applied math, and I actually wanted to do, like, a PhD in either theoretical physics or machine learning. And I was doing that all my undergrad. And then I built some stuff on my own, like some deep learning algorithms, and I was like, okay, this has some potential, but at the end of the day, this general AI stuff is quite. They're almost completely different things. I don't see how we get there in a reasonable time frame. And I look at some of the stuff today, and, I mean, LLMs are awesome.
00:44:35.766 - 00:44:54.634, Speaker B: Chash ept is great. Gemini. We'll see. Mid journey is awesome. I use midjourney a lot, and so AI itself is super useful and awesome. I don't really understand what problem the crypto AI intersection is solving currently.
00:44:54.832 - 00:44:55.674, Speaker C: Right?
00:44:55.872 - 00:45:45.994, Speaker B: Because obviously everybody knows that what you should do is you should look at the market, identify the gaps, work backwards, and build something to solve those problems. Okay, so what problem are we solving right now with this AI crypto intersection? People will say, like, oh, you need to show integrity of this thing wasn't fake content. It's like, okay, you can do that without crypto, by the way. That's just cryptography. You don't need a token to do this. And the one part where I do think it makes sense to intersect these two things is like, deepen in GPU clusters, right? Like, if you have extra GPU capacity on your computer, you want to build this protocol where you're leveraging the P to p network of people, like a bittorrent, where you want to utilize other people's resources to train models and GPU heavy stuff.
00:45:46.112 - 00:45:47.318, Speaker C: And you maybe give them a token.
00:45:47.334 - 00:46:07.758, Speaker B: To incentivize that, like a render. I think that's probably okay. I think that makes sense. I don't know the exact business model there, but I think fundamentally the concept makes sense because it's been around before. It's been around since bittorrent. So I think that's like the one part where it makes sense. In other words, or in other cases, I simply am not knowledgeable enough to make any judgments.
00:46:07.758 - 00:46:26.994, Speaker B: So I also have a fund. I do invest. And based on the pitches I have seen, I do not see a focus on solving problems that actually exist. So that seems to be the focus is to launch. Exactly, yeah. And then. Okay, so the other topic, which is meme coins.
00:46:26.994 - 00:46:36.810, Speaker B: I wrote a post on meme coins like a few months ago, which actually, I believe somebody from alliance was not happy about it. I forget his name.
00:46:36.880 - 00:46:37.382, Speaker D: Jacob.
00:46:37.446 - 00:46:38.330, Speaker A: Jacob.
00:46:38.910 - 00:46:41.238, Speaker D: Yeah, I gave him shit afterwards.
00:46:41.414 - 00:46:42.860, Speaker A: We all did, by the.
00:46:45.390 - 00:47:06.082, Speaker B: Know. Like, obviously meme coins are generally zero. Like, that's just like, I think you don't have to say this. It just goes without saying, meme coins are just a way to, let's say Tushar. I think multicoin says it well, which is that we thought the gaming would be like skew morphic, AAA kinds of games. But this is actually web three gaming in a sense.
00:47:06.216 - 00:47:06.514, Speaker C: Right?
00:47:06.552 - 00:47:22.810, Speaker B: Like, people just speculate on funny things, and sometimes they make money, sometimes they lose money. They know the risks. Hopefully they know the risks, but I don't see how they like, especially if you're bidding on Joe Bowden, you must know that this is not necessarily.
00:47:23.390 - 00:47:24.890, Speaker A: Are you Bong Bowden?
00:47:25.310 - 00:47:33.866, Speaker B: I don't buy any meme coins except for Bonk. And the reason is because. Okay, that brings me to Bonk.
00:47:33.898 - 00:47:34.238, Speaker C: Right?
00:47:34.324 - 00:48:06.920, Speaker B: Bonk is like the example I use in my post. And it's because I was here during the December 2022, like, FTX aftermath, and people were like, shitting on the chain and stuff. And Bonk was like this set of people who just distributed a fun dog token to everybody for no real reason other than to just cheer them up, in a sense. And it turned out that. So I distributed some developers, and now it's worth $700,000, which is. I don't even know how that works. It was worth like $900 at the time, and my CTO instantly sold it.
00:48:06.920 - 00:48:19.222, Speaker B: But what the meme coins do is a few things. One is they help, depending on the meme coin, they do help DFI teams tighten up their integrations.
00:48:19.366 - 00:48:19.770, Speaker C: Right.
00:48:19.840 - 00:48:59.334, Speaker B: Because you have to add these different tokens and different token standards on Salana, there's quite a few of those. They do stress test the network quite a bit. And people like me about this now. But Salana in 2021 was like this wild chain where people were just aping NFTs the whole time, and that broke the chain numerous times. Like, everybody knows the outages. What you might not know is the outages were because of NFTs, because people were just bought the hell out of the network and overwhelmed the block leaders. And so Solana now learned from that, and now is a much better chain for this, right? So obviously, people will speculate, gamble, that's just a market that exists, and you might as well serve it.
00:48:59.334 - 00:49:16.222, Speaker B: But it also has a lot of interesting benefits for the chain and the ecosystem teams within that chain. I think people have this misconception that we're inventing a casino and stuff. It's like, no, the casino already exists, okay? We're not inventing human nature. It already exists. Now they're just doing it here.
00:49:16.356 - 00:49:17.374, Speaker C: And we might as well.
00:49:17.412 - 00:49:37.394, Speaker B: We can use that for good or we can use that for bad, but it's not inherently a good or bad. There's no value judgments to be made there. And then the other part of this that I really don't like is when technical people like CEOs or engineers are like, oh, I spent all my time building this important stuff, but now people are just aping meme coins. Why should I do this?
00:49:37.512 - 00:49:38.466, Speaker C: It's like, if you have to ask.
00:49:38.488 - 00:49:51.834, Speaker B: Yourself why you should do this, you shouldn't do it anyways, okay? Ideally, you have some mission you're trying to accomplish. You're trying to solve a problem, and these meme coins won't affect you. If they do, then maybe your mission wasn't as important as you thought.
00:49:51.952 - 00:49:52.570, Speaker C: Okay?
00:49:52.720 - 00:50:21.602, Speaker B: And people will say, like, oh, well, these people are getting attention. So I can't get like, no, it's not like a physical. Like, people, there's no finite amount of attention. You can get attention if you're solving a useful problem or if you're building something interesting for your users. In fact, you can do what saga did, Solana mobile, and use the meme coins to help start some flywheel and get more attention for your product, sell more of it, and bootstrap some sort of cash for building other stuff.
00:50:21.736 - 00:50:32.966, Speaker D: Anyway, who said Bong is a meme coin? Bong is a deep end token for saga, and it generates revenue. It has a price to earnings ratio. It's a real coin that's correct.
00:50:33.068 - 00:50:48.070, Speaker B: Yes. I don't think helium and high mapper like everything being called deep in, but I do think it does generate revenue and the team behind it, most people don't know them, but they're like competent people. Like, I know them. They're talented.
00:50:48.150 - 00:50:49.798, Speaker A: What are your favorite apps on Ethereum?
00:50:49.894 - 00:51:12.062, Speaker B: This Farcaster count. I use Farcaster quite a bit. Yeah, it is. So the way it works is kind of weird, but it basically doesn't use the blockchain in a sense. I'm not sure if I want to call it an Ethereum app or Solana app or whatever. But, yeah, I think Farcaster is awesome. I did like friendtech when it was kind of in its phase.
00:51:12.062 - 00:51:33.754, Speaker B: I haven't really used it since. Oh, I tried using because I was on it. I was like, what the hell is this? What am I on? And that seems cool. Now, it did ask me to do some verification for verifying for this testnet airdrop, I think. And I was like, just no chance I'm doing this, but it looks cool. So I think there's potential there.
00:51:33.872 - 00:51:40.550, Speaker A: All right, I think we're at time. Mert, great seeing you, talking to you and learning more about how you think about Solana.
00:51:40.710 - 00:52:07.698, Speaker D: Mert, the only thing I would want to add is I think our industry need more people like you because I don't think, especially at this stage of the bull market, a lot of things are getting super absurd and ridiculous, and the percentage of people who are actually mission driven is lower and lower and lower at this stage of the cycle. So it was really refreshing to talk to you.
00:52:07.784 - 00:52:09.530, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for calling out the bullshit.
00:52:09.630 - 00:52:10.210, Speaker C: No worries.
00:52:10.290 - 00:52:14.706, Speaker B: I've been telling more people on Solana, like the tensor founders and just, you guys are smart.
00:52:14.738 - 00:52:15.270, Speaker C: Just talk.
00:52:15.340 - 00:52:16.854, Speaker B: Just put it out there.
00:52:16.972 - 00:52:17.926, Speaker C: People want to hear from you.
00:52:17.948 - 00:52:19.846, Speaker B: So hopefully that starts happening more and more.
00:52:19.948 - 00:52:31.980, Speaker A: And if you want to catch Mert, he has a great podcast called Lightspeed, and I think episodes come out every three days or four days roughly. So really good content. So would urge our listeners to check it out.
00:52:32.430 - 00:52:34.566, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Yep.
00:52:34.598 - 00:52:35.674, Speaker A: Thanks, Mert. Take care.
00:52:35.712 - 00:52:36.498, Speaker C: Thanks, Mert.
