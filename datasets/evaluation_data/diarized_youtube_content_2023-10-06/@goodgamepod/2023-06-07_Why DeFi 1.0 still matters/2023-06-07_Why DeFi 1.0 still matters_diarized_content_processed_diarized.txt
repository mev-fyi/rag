00:00:00.170 - 00:00:26.210, Speaker A: I think DFI 10 is still the most important thing in DFI, not the 20 or 30 or whatever that happened afterwards. The D five 10 was basically stablecoins lending dexes. We mentioned this before. These are the core pieces of the financial stack. They're lower in the stack. I think we talked about this before, but we like things that are lower on the stack, not the stuff that's higher on the stack. And what happened over the last year was a lot of things higher on the stack happened, but they've most been incremental.
00:00:26.210 - 00:00:38.500, Speaker A: D five 1.0 is still interesting. There's going to be interesting development. So with fixed rate landing, with peer to peer landing, with whatever order book or new amms that the incumbents will come out with.
