00:00:00.320 - 00:00:04.074, Speaker A: Welcome to good game. Your no B's insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.934 - 00:00:37.290, Speaker B: For this cycle, kind of, I've said it a while back, like, last year, is that you're gonna have a ton more people come into crypto this cycle. So a lot of the people that saw doge go crazy during COVID Solana go crazy during COVID Every, like, all their friends made a ton of money off crypto. There's a lot of people that saw crypto do that. Then they saw crypto die, thought crypto died, and now it's like, wow. Larry Finks, bitcoin spy, ETF Congress is like, yeah, we're supporting crypto. Like, all these trad five people. Like, yeah, crypto is not going away.
00:00:37.290 - 00:00:43.626, Speaker B: So you have a ton of people who missed last cycle, the cycle before that, the cycle before that, have seen crypto for multiple years now.
00:00:43.690 - 00:00:44.538, Speaker A: Multiple cope cycles.
00:00:44.586 - 00:00:56.842, Speaker B: Multiple cope cycles. Like, the co. You can only cope so much. Cope so much. Like watching all your friends making all this money. Like, bro, it can't be that hard. Yeah, like, so does it.
00:00:56.842 - 00:01:12.026, Speaker B: That, like, core group of people. That's why I think the degeneracy this cycle is gonna be so much more than all the other cycles. Cause there's so much coke from everybody that was not in crypto, and then now there's no reason. Like, you really have no reason to be. Like, I'm not gonna be in crypto because of x.
00:01:12.170 - 00:01:13.498, Speaker A: Is this the final coke cycle?
00:01:13.586 - 00:01:22.986, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. Literally. Cause in my head, like, this is the cycle where tradfi is. Like, they're passively just gonna bid crypto.
00:01:23.050 - 00:01:25.178, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto?
00:01:25.306 - 00:01:26.906, Speaker C: Check out our request for startups list.
00:01:26.930 - 00:01:44.774, Speaker A: And get inspired at Alliance XYZ ideas. But it's like, you know, it's good branding right now. Now everything that I watch on, like, tv or whatever, I just feel like it's a little corny. Like, I just don't really connect with it or vibe with it. Yeah, it's like they don't understand me. Right.
00:01:45.674 - 00:01:50.890, Speaker B: Manufactured stuff that's like, feels like somebody tried too hard to make it.
00:01:51.042 - 00:01:52.734, Speaker C: Like Djen and Normie.
00:01:53.704 - 00:01:57.544, Speaker A: What's up with that? And Herbie or whatever it was. What was the other?
00:01:57.584 - 00:01:58.224, Speaker C: There was a herbie.
00:01:58.264 - 00:02:01.984, Speaker A: Oh, sorry. No, there's another one. Brett. Brett. Sorry, Brett.
00:02:02.024 - 00:02:02.964, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:02:03.464 - 00:02:06.244, Speaker B: All the base ones are down, like, a lot more than I expected.
00:02:06.904 - 00:02:08.816, Speaker C: Djen isn't. DJ's still up a lot.
00:02:08.840 - 00:02:09.856, Speaker A: 200 million, dude.
00:02:09.920 - 00:02:11.204, Speaker C: So he's down from a billion.
00:02:14.424 - 00:02:15.560, Speaker B: It was up a lot.
00:02:15.632 - 00:02:16.952, Speaker C: So it's down 90% already.
00:02:17.048 - 00:02:19.606, Speaker A: It is. Are you recording myself? Yeah.
00:02:19.790 - 00:02:20.446, Speaker C: Oh, nice.
00:02:20.510 - 00:02:21.030, Speaker A: This is great.
00:02:21.062 - 00:02:35.526, Speaker B: This is all right into it. No, DJ's significantly down. I mean, but I sold the bottom of DJ, and so I'm like, you sold the bottom before it went to 2 billion. Like, I bought it so early, so.
00:02:35.550 - 00:02:36.634, Speaker A: By the way, I did too.
00:02:38.734 - 00:02:40.422, Speaker C: No, it's still 800 FTV.
00:02:40.478 - 00:02:42.758, Speaker A: Wait, what?
00:02:42.926 - 00:02:44.222, Speaker C: It's not down that much.
00:02:44.398 - 00:02:46.762, Speaker B: It might be towards 200 circumflex.
00:02:46.918 - 00:02:53.194, Speaker A: Okay. Okay. Yeah, I mean, I did a quick search. I mean, my fucking deck screeners, like, infinite now.
00:02:53.234 - 00:02:56.066, Speaker B: Yeah, my list. I've had a little Dexcreen list.
00:02:56.210 - 00:03:01.522, Speaker A: Yeah, but base is like. It's like their shit coins are not as robust as Solana's.
00:03:01.578 - 00:03:14.224, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like all. There's so much additional base. Like, Coinbase is pushing it hella hard. Like, a lot of the biggest apps on ETH and all the l two s are on base. Like, farcasters there. Frentek is there. But the tokens just, like, don't trade well.
00:03:14.224 - 00:03:17.608, Speaker B: Really. All the token trading is manufactured right now.
00:03:17.696 - 00:03:29.104, Speaker A: It's manufactured. Yeah, yeah, but so somebody put up a stat. I'll remember, like, but it was something in the order of. There's 1.2 million daily active users on Solana or something like that.
00:03:29.144 - 00:03:29.712, Speaker B: There's a lot.
00:03:29.808 - 00:03:40.716, Speaker A: And there's, like, about 300,000 on base. So I think it has to do with that. Right. And then it just really comes down to onboarding. How do you onboard masses to crypto? And it's Phantom. Right. For Solana, at least.
00:03:40.820 - 00:03:52.596, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw the stats the other day. It was like, phantom was top three in utility apps or something, like, by downloads. Yeah, Phantom's doing really well. I think all the nude retail people are definitely going straight to sauna.
00:03:52.660 - 00:04:08.362, Speaker A: Yep. Even in emerging countries like Nigeria, Southeast Asia, Phantom is, like the top five. And Soulflare is too. Like, soulflare and Phantom are, like, in the list. So that tells me that people just want to trade shit coins in Solana.
00:04:08.418 - 00:04:30.938, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, dude, I went. I was in Istanbul, Turkey, for, like, the Solana crossroads, that conference. And I was taking pictures with, like, I had to take over 200 pictures at the event. But people told me, like, they literally were flying from, like, some of those countries in Africa. They flew to Turkey from there to be like, yo, because we know you're coming to. Oh, wow. That was crazy.
00:04:30.938 - 00:04:32.514, Speaker B: A little crazy, for sure.
00:04:32.674 - 00:04:34.746, Speaker C: Did you end up getting the contact info?
00:04:34.770 - 00:04:41.594, Speaker B: That girl at the pool party. Wait, are you talking with the people roasted me for that. So hard.
00:04:41.674 - 00:04:42.882, Speaker A: Is that the moroccan girl?
00:04:43.018 - 00:04:49.410, Speaker B: No, that's a different girl. Come on. That's a different girl. That's the girl that like Michi, bro.
00:04:49.442 - 00:04:49.962, Speaker A: Oh, Dimichi.
00:04:49.978 - 00:05:00.362, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. That's D'amici girl. She's actually mad. Chill. She's actually. When I'm coming back out that way. No, bro, that video, dude, I, like, posted it, not even thinking it was gonna be that big.
00:05:00.362 - 00:05:13.304, Speaker B: I'm like, oh, there's. I know there's some people on crypto Twitter down there at the pool. Wherever she's at, just, like, go up to her and be like, yo, this dude wants your number. Like, real chill. Those girls do that to me all the time in the club. That was handsome. Yo, Z.
00:05:13.304 - 00:05:28.608, Speaker B: Like, who's this tall dude dancing? And they're like, go get his number. But I woke up and I took a nap. I woke up. The, quote, tweets on that shit. I was like, jesus Christ, bro. People were calling me all types of shit. That shit was insane.
00:05:28.776 - 00:05:32.204, Speaker A: One of the guys that quote retweeted and actually found the girl.
00:05:32.344 - 00:05:34.316, Speaker B: And found her. Yeah. And got her Instagram and everything.
00:05:34.380 - 00:05:38.204, Speaker A: Az Flynn. Az Flynn is hacking in our mvp hackathon right now.
00:05:38.244 - 00:05:43.940, Speaker B: Yo, I gotta go talk to him. I gotta go talk to him. Yeah, bring him in here and tell the people that she was cool with it.
00:05:43.972 - 00:05:45.660, Speaker A: Az Flynn as Flynn?
00:05:45.812 - 00:05:46.484, Speaker B: Yeah. Really?
00:05:46.564 - 00:05:47.304, Speaker A: He did.
00:05:48.404 - 00:05:49.292, Speaker B: He got her instagram.
00:05:49.348 - 00:05:49.940, Speaker A: He's here.
00:05:50.052 - 00:05:52.540, Speaker B: Showed her the tweet, and she was like, yeah. She started laughing at it. Yeah.
00:05:52.572 - 00:05:57.984, Speaker A: Partly why I admitted him was cause of that. I mean, this guy's good.
00:05:58.284 - 00:05:59.660, Speaker B: Yeah, he's down for.
00:05:59.732 - 00:06:00.524, Speaker C: He's a real hacker.
00:06:00.564 - 00:06:01.478, Speaker A: He's a real hacker.
00:06:01.596 - 00:06:04.466, Speaker B: That's crazy. Damn. I gotta go talk to bro.
00:06:04.530 - 00:06:10.050, Speaker A: Yeah, okay, but you have all the stuff recorded, right? All right, good, good.
00:06:10.082 - 00:06:18.534, Speaker B: All right. Comedy, whatever. Oh, shit.
00:06:19.554 - 00:06:21.094, Speaker C: What about the boxing match?
00:06:21.954 - 00:06:25.562, Speaker B: Man? I gotta run it back, bro. I gotta hit my second.
00:06:25.618 - 00:06:26.434, Speaker A: Gotta get Barney back.
00:06:26.514 - 00:06:39.634, Speaker B: I know. I gotta get Barney back. He's actually mad cool, though. We turned up for the whole week after. But, yeah, boxing, bro. So I was like. I was drunk one day on Twitter, and I'm really, like, scrolling the timeline, as I usually do, just tweeting out random shit.
00:06:39.634 - 00:06:58.482, Speaker B: And I saw Bonnie, like, yeah, nobody wants to fight me in crypto fight night this year. Like I did the past two years, and nobody wants to be the main card. I'm like, all right, I'll do it. Like, I'll be the main card, not drunk as shit. And I wake up the next day, and we're just like, yo, yo, yo. You really. Are you serious? Like, you really wanna do this, right? What did I do? Like, yeah, yeah, I'll do it.
00:06:58.482 - 00:07:03.930, Speaker B: And so I did it, like, whatever. Got a train or whatever. But, yeah, I was not as trained.
00:07:03.962 - 00:07:08.658, Speaker A: As hard as I should, so the funny. So I do boxing. I've been boxing for, like, three years now.
00:07:08.706 - 00:07:09.442, Speaker B: Okay.
00:07:09.618 - 00:07:15.374, Speaker A: And so I saw a picture of you last, the night before drinking. I'm like, oh, man.
00:07:16.194 - 00:07:19.054, Speaker B: I was like, ah, I landed in Dubai Monday.
00:07:19.354 - 00:07:21.338, Speaker A: You were out. I know that. I don't know if you were drinking or not.
00:07:21.426 - 00:07:27.398, Speaker B: I wasn't drinking the night before. Okay, okay. I landed in Dubai Monday, and I was like, I was out drinking till.
00:07:27.446 - 00:07:29.646, Speaker A: 07:00 a.m. okay, it was the day before. Okay.
00:07:29.670 - 00:07:31.254, Speaker B: And then Tuesday was the flood.
00:07:31.334 - 00:07:31.766, Speaker A: Okay.
00:07:31.830 - 00:07:40.942, Speaker B: We went out again. The flood was, like, fucked up all the roads. I didn't get back until, like, 10:00 a.m. okay. And then Wednesday, I think, was a photo shoot. I was chilling. Thursday I was out at Arthur's party.
00:07:40.942 - 00:07:45.166, Speaker B: Like, I think I got back at, like, five. But I wasn't drinking that day, but Hayes. Huh?
00:07:45.230 - 00:07:46.174, Speaker C: Which Arthur Hayes?
00:07:46.214 - 00:07:46.990, Speaker B: Haze. Yeah, Hayes.
00:07:47.062 - 00:07:49.886, Speaker A: He had it at the party. I forgot what it's called. But you weren't there.
00:07:49.910 - 00:07:50.494, Speaker C: You were in Dubai.
00:07:50.534 - 00:07:51.398, Speaker A: I was in Dubai. I was there.
00:07:51.446 - 00:07:52.182, Speaker B: It was the beach club.
00:07:52.238 - 00:07:52.766, Speaker A: It was the beach club.
00:07:52.790 - 00:07:55.894, Speaker B: I didn't go to the park. It was a sick, it was a sick function. Yeah, it was cool.
00:07:55.934 - 00:08:00.662, Speaker A: Yeah, there was just a lot of traffic that week. It was just hard to get anywhere.
00:08:00.718 - 00:08:03.102, Speaker B: Bro, they should have made the fight on Monday or Tuesday.
00:08:03.198 - 00:08:04.914, Speaker A: Yeah, you would have knocked about.
00:08:05.254 - 00:08:08.190, Speaker B: God damn, bro, I didn't sleep all week.
00:08:08.342 - 00:08:18.750, Speaker A: So you got your computer science. So you went to Georgia Tech. Computer science. Yep. What drew you into crypto? Like, what was the initial draw?
00:08:18.782 - 00:08:43.264, Speaker B: Like, yeah, honestly, I wasn't looking to get into crypto, really. At tech, I was studying computer science. Love computer science. Always have been good at math and science. And actually, I, like, wanted to look more into the finance side of things, so I picked up a minor, which is like, a computing and business minor. It's like one of the tech programs that they have there. And then during that minor, I was taking some classes.
00:08:43.264 - 00:09:09.198, Speaker B: One of the classes was an emerging technology class. And in that class, my professor, like, one of the focuses of that class was bitcoin, and I was 2016. So back in 2016 is when learned about what bitcoin originally was, learned why I was important learned about crypto a little bit. All my boys, none of us bought any back then. Unfortunately, in 2016, there's always a copier. Yeah, it's super copier. And then 2017, that's when I graduated from tech.
00:09:09.198 - 00:09:31.572, Speaker B: And if you guys remember bitcoin that year, it was, like, nonstop up all year. So one of the dudes that I was, like, my mentor, I was working as a software engineer mentor. My job was a big crypto guy. So he was, like, trading on Bittrex nonstop on Bitmex, nonstop. Like, every one of our meetings each week, he would, like, we would talk about coding or whatever, and he would start talking about crypto. He was like, dude, you got to get into crypto. You got into crypto.
00:09:31.572 - 00:09:44.036, Speaker B: You're smart. You got to learn this, too, in addition to doing all the software engineering stuff. And so I was like, I think I bought my first bitcoin around, like, three k or somewhere, probably. I want to say it was, like, June or something.
00:09:44.100 - 00:09:45.332, Speaker A: That year of 2017.
00:09:45.428 - 00:09:48.484, Speaker B: Yeah, that was summer. Summer, June or July.
00:09:48.644 - 00:09:50.904, Speaker C: 3K was when Raoul pal exited.
00:09:51.284 - 00:09:52.348, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, the bottom.
00:09:52.396 - 00:09:55.744, Speaker C: Yeah, he sold. He sold the other three k. The banana zone. Yeah.
00:10:01.604 - 00:10:07.132, Speaker B: That'S why he's talking about the banana zone now. He's like, yeah, I'm not selling a three k again. That's funny.
00:10:07.188 - 00:10:08.468, Speaker A: Basically risk free.
00:10:08.556 - 00:10:29.496, Speaker B: Yeah, that's crazy. But, yeah, so that's. That's how I got into crypto and, yeah, just learned basically self taught from there. Like, I was very active on Twitter and socials before I even did crypto. So my Twitter in college, same way I do now. Like, whenever I go out with my friends, I'm tweeting. I was doing that in college before I even did crypto.
00:10:29.496 - 00:10:43.830, Speaker B: And so it's just like, when I added crypto to that, I'd be doing that. But then when I'm not doing that, I'll be posting charts, talking to all the CT people, figuring out how to learn stuff. And that's basically just, like, I taught myself how to trade from CT and, like, some other books that I read.
00:10:43.862 - 00:10:46.790, Speaker A: Who were your big followers back then? Like, who were some of the crypto?
00:10:46.822 - 00:10:47.854, Speaker C: Twitter were your role models?
00:10:47.934 - 00:11:00.434, Speaker B: My role models back then, yeah. Well, it was, like, trader main. All his stuff was solid. Kobe, of course, like, loomdart. This dude named Conan. Karel was a beast. He was an ICT guy.
00:11:00.434 - 00:11:24.394, Speaker B: And then bitcoin is a monster. He's, like, one of the best at comparing when cycles start, when you go from alts to BTC and laid out a clear map of when you go risk on, risk off. That's how I learned all the rotations and all that. I learned that first cycle. Now it's 2017 to 2020. Then 2020 came around. I was like, well, I know what to do this time.
00:11:24.394 - 00:11:48.014, Speaker B: I'm not going to fuck around this time. I actually know what to do. I actually missed most of defi summer wifi. Yeah. Missed all the farming stuff where people did the 10,000% from zero. Missed a lot of that, but was on uniswap. Like, a lot of my boys I was playing poker with that summer, like, during COVID Cause everybody was just home fucking on their computer and just doing whatever.
00:11:48.014 - 00:12:03.710, Speaker B: And then big home is at, like, ten k or nine k, whatever. It was in, like, september, and it hadn't moved yet. I'm like, bros, everything's gone parabolic. Defi's gone crazy. Everybody's on eth. Bitcoin is still 50% off all time highs. Like, it has to at least go back to all time highs.
00:12:03.710 - 00:12:17.646, Speaker B: And nobody wanted to buy bitcoin. Everybody's like, we don't even know what that is. We own uniswap and eth. Cause they were all new to crypto. They didn't have that prior cycle known to, like, alts bitcoin. Alts bitcoin. You know, they didn't even know what that was, man.
00:12:17.646 - 00:12:22.774, Speaker B: That was, like, my first good trade. And then, like, solana and some other stuff, too, but, yeah. Yeah.
00:12:22.854 - 00:12:27.074, Speaker C: How did you know this cycle, at the beginning of this cycle, that Solana was going to come back?
00:12:29.374 - 00:12:30.142, Speaker A: That was good.
00:12:30.198 - 00:12:50.632, Speaker B: That was a crazy call. Yeah, that was a good call. That was a crazy call. I mean, I was just super confident because I saw Solana from the very, very beginning. Like, the first time I bought it, it was around, like, $1.50, very beginning of 2021. And my whole thesis was, if ETH DeFi is doing really well, people have issues buying and selling on ETH because the fees are so high.
00:12:50.632 - 00:12:59.244, Speaker B: You have congestion issues. There's got to be some other l one where DeFi is also going to pop off and stuff's going to do well. So I was like, then I started researching Solana.
00:13:01.094 - 00:13:04.894, Speaker C: But there were so many high throughput.
00:13:05.014 - 00:13:28.626, Speaker B: There were a lot. Yeah. So Solana and Serum. Actually, Jeremy Jingtao, if you own a Jing tao, he told me the one to look into Solana and serum, like, way back when. And that's when I started researching those two specifically, like, looked into SBF, and, like, oh, this guy knows what he's talking about. Then looked into Anatoly, did listen to all of his podcasts, looked into his background. Nia Solano was one of the early bets that I made.
00:13:28.626 - 00:13:36.346, Speaker B: It's crazy. Cause that thread isn't all on Twitter. Like, I bought it at $1.50 and I'm like, yo, it's going to three, it's going to like five. And then, like, then I.
00:13:36.410 - 00:13:41.418, Speaker C: But this was last cycle. This was before FTX, but this cycle after FTX.
00:13:41.466 - 00:13:51.874, Speaker B: I'm getting there, I'm getting there. So, like, so back then, it was just like an idea. There was nothing on Solana yet. No, no defi. No, nothing. It's like, there could be something here possibly. Let's look at the idea of it.
00:13:51.874 - 00:13:59.258, Speaker B: And then it was like radium popped up. I was using solid. It was like that old wallet before Phantom and backpack were even.
00:13:59.306 - 00:14:00.306, Speaker A: Oh, solid. Yes.
00:14:00.370 - 00:14:01.066, Speaker B: The web wallet.
00:14:01.130 - 00:14:02.930, Speaker A: The private key, you have to actually write it down.
00:14:03.002 - 00:14:06.874, Speaker B: Yeah, the web wallet is horrible. Horrible web wallet. Oh, my God. Where's you at?
00:14:06.914 - 00:14:08.610, Speaker A: Solid. It's the first wallet.
00:14:08.802 - 00:14:27.472, Speaker B: But yeah, I saw, like, Solana Defi and then I saw nfts do really well. I think magic Eden launched, like, close around to the top. I think that cycle. And then all the issues with, like, congestion happened on something. It was like, everybody's spamming these NfT mints. Like, no, it's like free money on every Nft mint. So they're spamming, spamming, spamming.
00:14:27.472 - 00:14:47.392, Speaker B: And Solana didn't have any way to deal with congestion. There was no fee markets or anything, really. And the way that the validators were processing all the transactions was fucking stuff up. So I saw that happen. Saw, that's worst. Then I saw 2022. Throughout all of 2022, I was like, well, last bear market, I kind of checked out a little bit.
00:14:47.392 - 00:15:14.964, Speaker B: This bear market, I'm not going to check out. And basically tapped into all the technical upgrades that the Solana did that year. And I went to breakpoint in 2022 and listened, like, all the talks, talked to a ton of founders, talked to ton of people in the ecosystem. That was when Solana was around, like dollar 40. And it was just like, the sentiment there for everybody at breakpoint was super high, regardless of how far down price was. They were super excited about mostly builders, too, probably. Yeah, mostly builders.
00:15:14.964 - 00:15:29.398, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm like, there's still builders here in Ounsala. The ecosystem is not dead. And then FTX happened, and it literally, like, on the plane back. Oh, my God. From breakpoint, flying back to the US. Everybody's so happy, so hype.
00:15:29.398 - 00:15:34.674, Speaker B: We just left, like, the last party, and then it's like, boom. $40, $8.
00:15:35.014 - 00:15:36.194, Speaker A: I remember that.
00:15:36.494 - 00:15:39.234, Speaker C: That was after you reached 200?
00:15:39.534 - 00:15:49.218, Speaker B: Yes, it was 200. 6242. Hundred, 60, like, peak last cycle. And then it was at $40 during breakpoint. Cause I remember. Cause it hadn't made a. It didn't make a lower low.
00:15:49.218 - 00:16:05.810, Speaker B: And when Terra Luna blew up, right, it was like, may of 2022. I'm like, oh, like, this shit was gotta be the worst. And then June, the three ac shit happened. And like, eth went from. It was like the terra Luna low was like, here. And then eth went boom, like, down another 30, 40%. But Solana didn't make a lower low.
00:16:05.810 - 00:16:14.434, Speaker B: It was like, it didn't make a lower low. And Solana was the only thing that held that, like, that same level. Bitcoin made a lower low, eth made a lower low. And Solana was just chilling there. I'm like, okay, that's.
00:16:14.514 - 00:16:14.874, Speaker A: That's weird.
00:16:14.914 - 00:16:16.770, Speaker B: Weird. That doesn't make sense.
00:16:16.802 - 00:16:17.954, Speaker A: You know, some shit's going wrong.
00:16:18.074 - 00:16:48.744, Speaker B: Somebody's buying this down here. So that whole, like, the rest of the month, of the year is just like, chopping around, accumulating. I thought it was bottom, like, for sure, for sure. And then the FTX shit happened, and it went from forty dollars to eight dollars. And I was like, well, if all the builders that I was just talking to at breakpoint aren't leaving, and the whole people who are already tapped in, aslana, are leaving, they didn't talk about SBF once during breakpoint. He was not mentioned at all. So if he's the only thing gone and he just have to deal with that and then make it through the rest of this bear.
00:16:48.744 - 00:16:49.772, Speaker B: Good.
00:16:49.828 - 00:16:50.132, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:50.188 - 00:17:09.666, Speaker B: So that was the whole thesis. It was just like, I thought eventually was going to bounce back. And whenever, like, bitcoin and ETH bounce back for the next bull market, eventually people are going to bid beta. And I was like, well, it's got to be one of the things that gets bid. So that was a whole dope thesis for it. But it's just because I saw the whole thing happen. Like, if you came into 2022, like, oh, FTX blew up, Solana is at $8.
00:17:09.770 - 00:17:10.574, Speaker A: I'm out.
00:17:10.874 - 00:17:15.666, Speaker B: I'm not touching that. But I saw the whole up and down all the way.
00:17:15.810 - 00:17:22.594, Speaker A: A lot of the investors during that period, remember chow? When that happened, they all left. No one wanted to invest in Solana, I heard.
00:17:22.634 - 00:17:22.930, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:23.002 - 00:17:24.458, Speaker C: Even some builders left.
00:17:24.506 - 00:17:25.138, Speaker A: Builders left.
00:17:25.186 - 00:17:33.014, Speaker C: And that. So you and I both had very strong conviction in Solana. But there was a point where we started seeing some builders started to.
00:17:33.114 - 00:17:34.794, Speaker B: To waiver. Yeah.
00:17:35.454 - 00:17:51.102, Speaker C: So that gave me a little bit of doubt. But over the course of the next, like, three to six months, we realized there's still a core group of builders that stayed. That was what gave me. And that was still Solana. Between ten to $15. That was like generational buy.
00:17:51.158 - 00:17:57.190, Speaker A: Yeah, generational buy. But the people were, like, the founders that stayed. They were incredibly passionate.
00:17:57.262 - 00:17:59.034, Speaker B: They were locked in to the point.
00:17:59.734 - 00:18:04.334, Speaker A: Like, I drew into that. I use that as, like, a source of energy and say, like, yeah, fuck you guys, right?
00:18:04.494 - 00:18:06.118, Speaker B: Yeah. Like the guys, bro.
00:18:06.206 - 00:18:07.798, Speaker A: Cheeto guys. Tensor guys.
00:18:07.886 - 00:18:08.874, Speaker B: Tensor guys.
00:18:10.054 - 00:18:10.886, Speaker A: Matora.
00:18:10.950 - 00:18:11.594, Speaker B: Yep.
00:18:12.294 - 00:18:13.182, Speaker A: You said camino, right?
00:18:13.198 - 00:18:16.590, Speaker C: Yeah, camino. Phantom, soul, flare, magic, Eden.
00:18:16.702 - 00:18:17.518, Speaker A: All those guys.
00:18:17.646 - 00:18:19.358, Speaker B: And then, like, none of them had tokens yet either.
00:18:19.406 - 00:18:23.034, Speaker A: No, I'm like, they make it out of this.
00:18:23.374 - 00:18:38.400, Speaker B: None of them have tokens yet. All that defi stuff happened. Cause I missed that last cycle. I missed, like, the wild, the radium serum, the urine. Like, I missed all those. And then I was like, a lot of the. One of the main issues that Solana had its first cycle was that all Solana alts were scams.
00:18:38.432 - 00:18:41.720, Speaker C: Like, they literally were all the worst high FTV bullshit.
00:18:41.792 - 00:18:52.364, Speaker B: They were terrible. And some of them didn't even release products. Like, release coins and never even release a product. It was that bad. So I was like, I know the sentiment cannot possibly get any worse.
00:18:54.904 - 00:19:02.284, Speaker A: It seems like ethereum. Ethereum first launched, they had the ico boom where everybody scammed everyone. Half the shit didn't work.
00:19:02.894 - 00:19:03.958, Speaker B: And nobody believed me.
00:19:04.006 - 00:19:04.726, Speaker A: Nobody believed in me.
00:19:04.750 - 00:19:07.638, Speaker B: And then Defi came out of nowhere, and everybody who was still there made.
00:19:07.726 - 00:19:09.430, Speaker A: Whatever the other people are coping.
00:19:09.502 - 00:19:12.462, Speaker C: Yeah, like, Solana is behind ethereum by one cycle in many ways.
00:19:12.518 - 00:19:12.686, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:12.710 - 00:19:17.726, Speaker C: Like, the bottom last cycles. Solana was the 2017 cycle. Ethereum.
00:19:17.830 - 00:19:21.342, Speaker A: So the question is, who is the next runner up?
00:19:21.478 - 00:19:22.674, Speaker C: The next lana?
00:19:23.414 - 00:19:26.594, Speaker A: If we're going per cycle, you don't have to say it.
00:19:27.454 - 00:19:29.654, Speaker C: If there is one, what would it be?
00:19:32.034 - 00:19:45.506, Speaker B: Damn, that's a tough question, man. I don't think I do yet. Cause I need to see their first cycle. And we gotta get to the end of this cycle to kind of see what that looks like. And I'll probably know better, but throw a dark. Yeah, I don't know. Thor dart.
00:19:45.506 - 00:19:48.178, Speaker B: Right now. This cycle. Solana.
00:19:48.266 - 00:19:55.894, Speaker A: Yeah, we should all ask. I wanna hear yours. I'll tell you mine.
00:19:56.584 - 00:20:29.664, Speaker B: I mean, I probably guess Monad right now is not even out yet. But it seems like the way sentiment's kind of forming around it, and it seems like it's gonna be something relatively new, where it's gonna be, like, EVM built from the ground up in a way that can perform the same way that Solana does. That'll be like a new entry, I guess, to the market, really. And we'll see, I guess, where it comes out at. But the thing is, when Solana came out, it came out at, like, 400, 500 mil, whatever it was. And it's like, retail had a ton of time to buy it at 400, 500 mil. All these l ones now come out multi billion every single time.
00:20:29.664 - 00:20:32.056, Speaker B: Cause Solana already proved itself. It's like the thesis is proven already.
00:20:32.080 - 00:20:33.184, Speaker A: So they comp against that.
00:20:33.264 - 00:20:43.152, Speaker B: I honestly think, like, this cycle, the equivalent Solana trade, where it's like, you're gonna. Retail's gonna print a lot, is app, like, apps, specific apps, consumer apps. So that's what I think it's gonna be.
00:20:43.168 - 00:20:45.080, Speaker A: Frontec or pump or.
00:20:45.192 - 00:20:46.920, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. It's like, whatever that.
00:20:46.992 - 00:20:49.968, Speaker A: That's where I think, like, hundred percent agreed with that.
00:20:50.056 - 00:20:58.080, Speaker B: Thousand apps. Cause nobody believes in apps. And crypto, everybody's like, oh, I wanna buy infra. I wanna invest in infrastructure apps. You have to, like, do. It's a lot harder to be proven, like, right, alpha?
00:20:58.112 - 00:20:58.724, Speaker A: Guys.
00:20:59.664 - 00:21:02.800, Speaker C: It's actually now harder to build apps than to build infra.
00:21:02.992 - 00:21:03.944, Speaker B: You said it's not.
00:21:04.024 - 00:21:06.312, Speaker C: It's harder to build apps to build infra.
00:21:06.368 - 00:21:08.488, Speaker B: Well, because. Yeah, because nobody, like. It's hard to get.
00:21:08.616 - 00:21:11.568, Speaker A: Nobody hard to get. Nobody wants invest.
00:21:11.696 - 00:21:19.272, Speaker B: Yeah. Everybody's like, that's a dumb idea. Crypto doesn't need that. But I'll buy it. I'll do this next l one infra doesn't make sense.
00:21:19.408 - 00:21:23.074, Speaker C: So what's her pick? What's your next cycle, Solana? This cycle, Solana.
00:21:23.374 - 00:21:24.194, Speaker A: Fuck.
00:21:25.054 - 00:21:25.702, Speaker B: Emmett.
00:21:25.758 - 00:21:27.550, Speaker C: I'll give you my answer questions.
00:21:27.582 - 00:21:28.474, Speaker B: Right. Yeah.
00:21:30.734 - 00:21:32.454, Speaker A: Well, the ones that are live.
00:21:32.574 - 00:21:35.878, Speaker C: Yeah. Or even the ones that are coming up, up and coming.
00:21:36.046 - 00:21:37.238, Speaker A: I'll put three out there.
00:21:37.286 - 00:21:37.914, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:21:39.574 - 00:21:46.162, Speaker A: Sui, Monad, Barachit. I don't know.
00:21:46.178 - 00:21:46.898, Speaker B: I like Barret chain.
00:21:46.946 - 00:21:47.362, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:47.458 - 00:21:48.970, Speaker B: I like Barrett chain, actually. Yeah.
00:21:49.082 - 00:21:59.450, Speaker A: Those three are, like, the ones that I'm seeing. Maybe aptos, if they get the whole RWA thesis. I don't know. Because I think most really pushing for the rwas on there. I don't know where they're at.
00:21:59.522 - 00:22:00.562, Speaker C: They make a lot of noise.
00:22:00.658 - 00:22:11.580, Speaker A: They make a lot of noise. They're on my timeline. More often than all the other. Yeah, but, yeah, it's hard to say. But those are the three four that I'm keeping an eye on. How about you?
00:22:11.682 - 00:22:16.044, Speaker C: I'm thinking it's going to be ethereum L2. That's going to become a layer one.
00:22:16.464 - 00:22:17.440, Speaker B: Oh, a transition.
00:22:17.512 - 00:22:18.912, Speaker C: A transition to layer one.
00:22:19.008 - 00:22:21.168, Speaker A: Oh. They actually defy Ethereum's alignment?
00:22:21.216 - 00:22:21.688, Speaker C: I think so.
00:22:21.736 - 00:22:22.920, Speaker B: Oh, that's spicy.
00:22:22.952 - 00:22:23.704, Speaker A: That's spicy.
00:22:23.864 - 00:22:25.164, Speaker B: That's spicy.
00:22:26.464 - 00:22:38.708, Speaker C: It's really hard to bootstrap a whole new ecosystem from scratch. And so I think one of the incumbent L2s, ethereum L2s like arbitram. Optimism. Blast those. One of those guys.
00:22:38.836 - 00:22:39.164, Speaker A: Oh.
00:22:39.204 - 00:22:40.148, Speaker C: Will become a layer one.
00:22:40.196 - 00:22:43.244, Speaker A: Did you see the hyper liquid announcement, yo?
00:22:43.324 - 00:22:46.780, Speaker B: Yeah, I did see that. I didn't read into it. Yeah.
00:22:46.812 - 00:23:02.060, Speaker A: I think they're doing paralyzed EVM or they're doing EVM of some support as the cosmos SDK they have. What's really cool about hyper liquid is that they change their consensus algo to the point where it matches the performance of trading on chain. So it's very performant.
00:23:02.132 - 00:23:02.620, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:02.732 - 00:23:06.892, Speaker A: So that's what. So now they have the mind share. So they're the number one perp Dex right now.
00:23:06.948 - 00:23:07.316, Speaker B: Yep.
00:23:07.380 - 00:23:08.356, Speaker A: With its own layer one.
00:23:08.420 - 00:23:08.980, Speaker B: Yep.
00:23:09.092 - 00:23:18.356, Speaker A: And now they're focused on building this kind of EVM compatibility parallel. I don't know if it's paralyzed or not, but I just saw a bunch of tweets that says that they're doing, they're going to compete with monads. I'm assuming that's what it is.
00:23:18.420 - 00:23:19.564, Speaker B: Yeah. They're going to do l one. Yeah.
00:23:19.604 - 00:23:22.380, Speaker A: They could manifest themselves into being a competitor.
00:23:22.452 - 00:23:42.696, Speaker B: You know what's interesting? What they kind of did, what a lot of apps kind of like, stumbled into doing where it's like an application does so well that they have to leave the roll up or leave the l one throw on, then build their own app chain. They were like, no, we know this is what we're gonna do from the jump. We're gonna build an app that better than all the other apps and then we're gonna put an l one on top of it. Cause we already have all the users here.
00:23:42.720 - 00:23:43.112, Speaker A: Yep.
00:23:43.208 - 00:23:46.216, Speaker B: Cause that'd be really smart way that go to market that they did it.
00:23:46.240 - 00:23:47.384, Speaker A: That could be the dark horse.
00:23:47.504 - 00:23:52.048, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that is the dark horse, actually. Dark. Yeah. Hyperlink would argue with that. A lot of people like the, I.
00:23:52.056 - 00:23:54.272, Speaker A: Was blown away when I saw that tweet. I'm like, holy shit.
00:23:54.368 - 00:23:56.304, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, wait a minute.
00:23:56.344 - 00:23:57.744, Speaker A: And they already have users.
00:23:57.864 - 00:23:58.072, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:58.088 - 00:24:00.624, Speaker A: They already have users that are on the layer one.
00:24:00.664 - 00:24:09.016, Speaker B: Cause that's the thing with every new l one. The hardest part is getting users because they always have, they start from zero on users. You have all this money, you have all this funding, but you don't have any users.
00:24:09.080 - 00:24:14.896, Speaker A: So blast really well, too. So what blasted was they got the TVL. Yep.
00:24:15.000 - 00:24:17.244, Speaker B: So got the DJ.
00:24:17.664 - 00:24:25.016, Speaker A: And so they, they have the native yield, the TVL and then the D gens. And they kind of bootstrap their ecosystem that way.
00:24:25.080 - 00:24:25.576, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:25.680 - 00:24:37.344, Speaker A: So I think we're gonna see new and unique ways of how layer one, L2 is, are gonna bootstrap their ecosystems such that they'll have some sort of fortified defense system of bringing users or developers onto their platform.
00:24:37.644 - 00:24:38.068, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:38.116 - 00:24:39.340, Speaker A: And so I do think other layer.
00:24:39.372 - 00:24:57.708, Speaker C: Twos are going to start losing, like, so next cycle. I mean, it's starting to look like it's apps turning into chains, liquid blurred into blast. And then there's a bunch of apps that found product market fit that are probably going to launch their own L2s, if not layer ones.
00:24:57.756 - 00:24:58.284, Speaker A: Yep.
00:24:58.404 - 00:25:00.544, Speaker C: So these are the dark horses.
00:25:01.274 - 00:25:04.374, Speaker B: That's a combination of all the theses. Then we just, we just did that.
00:25:06.514 - 00:25:08.374, Speaker A: We should have an investment committee meeting.
00:25:12.714 - 00:25:19.218, Speaker C: And apps are so, so much undervalued compared to infra. They're valued at like one 10th, if not 100th.
00:25:19.266 - 00:25:27.494, Speaker A: It's crazy. Like, I mean, I don't know if we should record, but like, the fantasy guys, they pitched a lot of investors and a lot of people said no. Right. You know, now they come back saying.
00:25:27.534 - 00:25:30.274, Speaker B: Hey, we changed our mind, now let us invest.
00:25:31.894 - 00:25:34.870, Speaker C: Fantasy could easily become a layer too easily.
00:25:34.982 - 00:25:38.154, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I mean, how many users they have right now?
00:25:38.534 - 00:25:41.054, Speaker C: I don't know how many users, but they. Oh, they have dollars.
00:25:41.094 - 00:25:46.310, Speaker A: Last week they have the last tournament they had 7000 people playing.
00:25:46.382 - 00:25:46.766, Speaker B: Okay.
00:25:46.830 - 00:25:49.702, Speaker A: The tournament before that, the first one was 18,000 people.
00:25:49.838 - 00:25:50.398, Speaker B: Okay.
00:25:50.486 - 00:25:57.370, Speaker A: So it's kind of leveling off as far as who's playing and who's actually farming. I mean, I'm playing the shit out of it right now.
00:25:57.482 - 00:25:58.658, Speaker C: I'm playing as a hero.
00:25:58.786 - 00:26:05.146, Speaker B: You're a platinum. I'm a hero. I'm like, top three on there. All I have to do is tweet. Okay, cool.
00:26:05.330 - 00:26:09.174, Speaker A: I wasn't getting paid from Twitter. Now you're getting paid on fantasy.
00:26:09.514 - 00:26:09.970, Speaker B: Great.
00:26:10.042 - 00:26:10.570, Speaker C: How much?
00:26:10.682 - 00:26:13.178, Speaker B: I've actually made a lot off the social fi stuff.
00:26:13.266 - 00:26:13.722, Speaker A: It's insane.
00:26:13.778 - 00:26:20.680, Speaker B: I've made a lot. I made off fantasy alone. I think I made right now I've made ten eth in the first.
00:26:20.712 - 00:26:21.240, Speaker A: And that's one week.
00:26:21.272 - 00:26:21.844, Speaker B: Two.
00:26:22.304 - 00:26:23.148, Speaker A: Okay. Week and a half.
00:26:23.186 - 00:26:35.896, Speaker B: Like, week and a half. Yes. That's ten eth, then off, like, I'm making money off Twitter, which is like three k a month or whatever, and then I'm. But friendsac, I made like 170 eth off the fees. Just off. Taking a cut of all that.
00:26:36.040 - 00:26:38.040, Speaker C: 100 7170 eth.
00:26:38.112 - 00:26:38.560, Speaker A: Yeah, I bought.
00:26:38.592 - 00:26:39.168, Speaker C: Jesus Christ.
00:26:39.216 - 00:27:22.174, Speaker B: Yeah. I can show it to you right now. Yeah. And it's all on Dune. But the only thing I don't like about friendsec is, like, my wallet is so public on there, so everybody knows exactly how much I made on all of my, like, everything. But, yeah, I think, like, the interesting part of apps and crypto is, like, we have users who are so degen that they'll spend a lot more than your average person would spend external to crypto. And so it's like, there's kind of a disconnect where if you're building consumer and crypto, it's like, do you want to build for the DJ's in crypto where, you know, they'll gamble on this and speculate on this? Because people speculate in crypto on everything, or do you want to build an apple that kind of can do both where it's like you're tapping into the users outside of crypto.
00:27:22.174 - 00:27:28.206, Speaker B: They can also use that, but also the DJ's can use that. That's like, the hardest thing, I think, for consumer apps to do in crypto.
00:27:28.270 - 00:27:28.750, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:28.862 - 00:27:47.284, Speaker A: I think the way it could work is the DJ is the first core user base, and then they eventually have to figure out a way to bring the normies or the retail people into crypto. And I was talking to fantasy guy yesterday, and that's kind of what they're thinking next. How do we expand outside even the pump guys, I was talking to him this morning, they're like, yeah, now think of ways to expand the pie.
00:27:47.364 - 00:27:47.844, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:47.964 - 00:27:57.664, Speaker C: Like, even Friendtech. I wish. Instead of building v two, they just expanded v one into the normies, bro. Like, is that what it's saying as well?
00:27:57.964 - 00:28:13.224, Speaker B: There's so much. Friendtech is the one app where it's like, would be so easy to get. Like these celebrities, artists, oh, YouTube, whatever. Like all that. Like, all those people into friendsec. Yeah, I just don't. It wasn't their focus with v one.
00:28:13.224 - 00:28:23.488, Speaker B: I mean, we'll see what their focus is for v two. But, yeah, that's one thing where it's like, bro, all these people already have superfans. They all have superfans by, like, at minimum, they have 100, 200 super fans.
00:28:23.576 - 00:28:28.072, Speaker A: And we have micro influencers, too, like, in different sectors. Crypto, because grown ups are all over the world, right?
00:28:28.128 - 00:28:29.136, Speaker C: I'm a micro influencer.
00:28:29.200 - 00:28:30.084, Speaker A: Yeah, you are.
00:28:31.024 - 00:28:32.244, Speaker C: Micro influencer.
00:28:32.984 - 00:28:41.520, Speaker B: I'll tell people, like, bro, if I made 170 eth on Friendsec, and I'm like, number one on Friendtech, nobody even knows who I am outside of crypto. If you get any of those big.
00:28:41.552 - 00:28:42.642, Speaker A: Well, I think that's changing, though.
00:28:42.768 - 00:29:13.450, Speaker B: Shade a little bit, kind of too fast. But, like, people who are external to crypto, like, any of their favorite musicians, you give them some kind of package where it's like, yo, this is my favorite artist. I know if I buy their friends at key and I wanted the first 100, I get to go to this concert, I get to meet them in person this time. I get this many tickets to this, and I get some merch and whatever else, bro, they're buy for whatever amount. Cause people spend for these, like, vip tickets, they'll be like ten k. I saw Tara swift tickets going for, like, what, twenty k, thirty k receipt.
00:29:13.522 - 00:29:13.778, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:13.826 - 00:29:17.002, Speaker B: And friendtech is like, it's lock in. Once you buy the key, you have forever.
00:29:17.058 - 00:29:17.554, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:17.674 - 00:29:29.894, Speaker B: If you have, like, a lifetime pass to Taylor Swift, whatever your favorite artist is, a lot of people will do that. So that's why I think that's one of the apps where, like, if they really hone in, focus on that and expand out, you could tap a really, really big market.
00:29:30.874 - 00:29:45.612, Speaker A: So. So v one is right now. I mean, the v one's still there. Like, I think that people are just not paying attention to it. People are paying more attention to v two or the v two, which is the group chats. And so some of the group chats. And maybe we could dive into some of the drama that's happening recently.
00:29:45.788 - 00:29:46.544, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:48.124 - 00:29:49.744, Speaker A: Yo, I got dumped on, man.
00:29:50.484 - 00:29:51.684, Speaker B: Hard. Super hard.
00:29:51.724 - 00:30:05.244, Speaker A: I mean, you too, because we're part of this. So Luke. Luke Martin, great guy. Him and, like, this guy named Mo define or something like that, created a chat. I think it was Mo defined.
00:30:05.284 - 00:30:06.156, Speaker B: Mo mind. Yeah, mo mind.
00:30:06.180 - 00:30:10.066, Speaker A: Mo mind created a chat called hog Crankers.
00:30:10.130 - 00:30:11.426, Speaker B: Crank for sin or something.
00:30:11.570 - 00:30:16.442, Speaker A: So I think it was supposed to become the premier, like, kind of meme coin or meme key.
00:30:16.498 - 00:30:17.274, Speaker B: Meme club.
00:30:17.434 - 00:30:18.002, Speaker A: Meme club.
00:30:18.058 - 00:30:18.654, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:19.394 - 00:30:27.170, Speaker A: And so it went from, like, I don't know, like, $100,000 to 6 million yesterday and dollars, 6 million.
00:30:27.202 - 00:30:29.170, Speaker B: I was like, the market cap of the club.
00:30:29.362 - 00:30:46.304, Speaker A: It went from, like, one hundred k to six million. Luke was the moderator. Mo mind, was the president. The president, someone like sent some tweet. I think he got scared and he dumped 250,000 friend front token front tech tokens. So the market went from 6 million to 1.6.
00:30:46.424 - 00:30:49.840, Speaker B: Well, no, he dumped his keys. Dumped his keys first. He dumped all those keys.
00:30:49.872 - 00:30:50.448, Speaker A: Yes, yes, yes.
00:30:50.496 - 00:30:55.824, Speaker B: On everybody's head. All the club keys. So the market cap went down, like, whatever, 50% of what it was cuz he had a ton.
00:30:55.864 - 00:30:56.776, Speaker A: Oh, that's what happened.
00:30:56.800 - 00:31:06.954, Speaker B: And then he got all the friend from that. Then he sold all the friend to eat mother dude, like multi million dollars worth. And then just tweeted like, yeah, oops.
00:31:08.254 - 00:31:09.670, Speaker A: Oh, he's finger slipped.
00:31:09.702 - 00:31:21.394, Speaker B: Finger slipped or something like that. Yeah, dude, that's the, that's like the game theory thing with friends. Like everything is so public. It's like when you sell, everybody knows. It's like that guy who did it and he dumped on everybody.
00:31:22.054 - 00:31:24.154, Speaker C: Yeah, so we use a non account.
00:31:24.854 - 00:31:28.774, Speaker A: Yeah, we have an a non account. So we're farming it pretty hard.
00:31:28.894 - 00:31:29.446, Speaker B: We did.
00:31:29.510 - 00:31:51.000, Speaker A: And now we're just like, you know, playing around. So that happened. So racer, yesterday, a couple days ago, as the market was pumping, or at least hogs were pumping, racer said that there was discussions of, how do you bring tokenize this? Yeah, so someone was trying to create a way to wrap the keys and tokenize it.
00:31:51.072 - 00:31:58.280, Speaker B: I think they're going to. Yeah, I think they have to. I mean, it only makes sense because especially with how much of a focus there is on meme phones this cycle.
00:31:58.312 - 00:31:58.718, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:58.816 - 00:32:28.330, Speaker B: If you have a way that, like, meme coins also have these clubs attached to them, and then it's like you trade them as you would trade meme coins, then it's like the cap on these clubs is not like a million, 5 million. It's like all these meme coins are going 100 million, 200 million, 500 million, then it's like completely different. But right now it's all internal to friendsec. They haven't really expanded outside of friendsec. So it's like the core user bases are the only people really trading there, and it's on base. And all the meme coin volume is on Solana right now. So it's like, yeah, but it's definitely interesting.
00:32:28.362 - 00:32:44.962, Speaker A: I mean, but they're both going the same path, right? Pump and frontec, they're going down the same destined plant path. But they're taking two different approaches. One is taking a closed ecosystem approach with the club keys, whereas with pump they're just allowing people to launch tokens. What was it form the community?
00:32:45.098 - 00:32:50.258, Speaker C: Was it alon that famously said all consumer crypto products are going to converge to pump?
00:32:50.346 - 00:32:51.386, Speaker A: Yes, he said that.
00:32:51.410 - 00:32:52.492, Speaker B: Who said that along?
00:32:52.548 - 00:32:53.744, Speaker C: The. One of the founders.
00:32:54.724 - 00:32:56.652, Speaker B: So if that's a bold claim, then.
00:32:56.708 - 00:32:58.596, Speaker A: That'S a bold claim that those guys are bold.
00:32:58.700 - 00:32:59.260, Speaker B: Yeah, they are.
00:32:59.292 - 00:32:59.628, Speaker A: They're both.
00:32:59.676 - 00:33:02.652, Speaker B: They are. They are. I like them, though.
00:33:02.708 - 00:33:09.028, Speaker A: Yeah. Good product. So I'm curious to hear you have any questions on that or how do.
00:33:09.036 - 00:33:12.664, Speaker C: You spend your day? Like, what do you think? What do you do on a daily basis?
00:33:14.564 - 00:33:26.974, Speaker B: Honestly, it changes day to day, dude. I spend a lot of time on Twitter. Um, so, like, more recently, like, I guess last cycle for me, I was like, my day would be like 12 hours on like, perps and then like, charts majors.
00:33:27.054 - 00:33:28.054, Speaker C: Yeah, majors.
00:33:28.094 - 00:33:51.176, Speaker B: Like alts majors. Yeah. So, like, last cycle I was trying to be like, first ever new all coin rotation first every new narrative. Like all of that, I'm trading on like, leverage, back and forth, whatever. And I was just literally at my screen nonstop doing that and obviously tweeting at the same time. And then kind of this cycle I'm building stuff. Also doing angel investing, still tweeting, of course, and then trading publix as well.
00:33:51.176 - 00:34:11.760, Speaker B: But like, more, more. So swing trading. Like, I'm mostly holding the positions that I've had instead of like, trying to catch every, like, perp, whatever level. Like when soul dips to like, whatever, 120, whatever it was in like April. I caught that. And I haven't taken another trade since. I'm like, dude, I think this is it.
00:34:11.760 - 00:34:16.514, Speaker B: I'm just going to swing this. Um, and I haven't been like, going back and forth with everything.
00:34:18.294 - 00:34:30.694, Speaker A: Okay, so you put a lot of thesis out there, right? So there's a thesis around bitcoin I don't touch on sort of like runes. So pups, wizards. I got dumped on pups, but I'm still holding it.
00:34:30.734 - 00:34:32.114, Speaker B: Yeah, so did I.
00:34:32.774 - 00:35:01.834, Speaker A: So did I. Arthur Hayes. Yahtzee. Fuck. So, okay, so you have bitcoin, you have runes, you have arbitrum, Senko, and maybe, boop, you have Solana, the Solana ecosystem. What are some of the, I guess, macro trends you're following and what are. Yeah, I'm curious on like, maybe diving to some of those thesis.
00:35:01.994 - 00:35:36.810, Speaker B: Yeah. So I mean, my main, let's maybe start with bitcoin. Yeah, so my, I'll say I'll start like, overall my main thesis for this cycle kind of, I've said it a while back, like, last year, is that you're gonna have a ton more people come into crypto the cycle. So a lot of the people that saw doge go crazy during COVID Solana go crazy during COVID Every, like, all their friends made a ton of money off crypto. There's a lot of people that saw crypto do that. Then they saw crypto die, thought crypto died, and now it's like, wow, Larry Finks, bitcoin spy, ETF Congress is like, yeah, we're sporting crypto. Like, all these trad five people.
00:35:36.810 - 00:35:45.166, Speaker B: Like, yeah, crypto is not going away. So you have a ton of people who missed last cycle, the cycle before that, the cycle before that, have seen crypto for multiple years now.
00:35:45.230 - 00:35:46.078, Speaker A: Multiple cope cycles.
00:35:46.126 - 00:36:13.894, Speaker B: Multiple cope cycles. Like, the cope, you can only cope so much. Only cope so much. Like watching all your friends making all this money, like, bro, it can't be that hard. Yeah, like, so there's a that core group of people. That's why I think the degeneracy this cycle is going to be so much more than all the other side, because there's so much coke from everybody that, like, was not in crypto, and then now there's no reason. Like, you really have no reason to be, like, I'm not going to be in crypto because of x.
00:36:13.974 - 00:36:15.558, Speaker A: Like, there's a final code cycle.
00:36:15.646 - 00:36:41.992, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so, literally, because in my head, like, this is the cycle where tradfi is. Like, they're passively just going to bid crypto. Like, we're going to bid bitcoin, eth, ETF, probably going to get approved this year, next. Whatever we're going to pass, we bid that. And then it's just like, stocks just go up into the right. So crypto is going to go up into the right, just how they do. So it's like the volatility is going to die down after this cycle, but you're going to have an influx of people who didn't trade crypto.
00:36:41.992 - 00:37:10.886, Speaker B: All these other cycles are going to trade crypto. And I think that's also one of the reasons that memes are doing so well now is because you have all these people who just want to trade crypto, but they don't care about or know about all the tech yet. They just know that people can make money trading crypto. So they're going to trade crypto. So that's like, the degen ton of retail, I think, isn't coming to crypto. That's part of the thesis. And then the other part of that is like, that's why I was so bullish on Solana also, is because I knew the Solana community really well, thought it was going to be one of the l one's that came back.
00:37:10.886 - 00:37:56.656, Speaker B: And then it's like, if you have a UX where it's 100 x cheaper, 100 x faster than ETh, and all these other alternatives, it's going to be so easy for anybody with $10, $100 to trade memes or whatever alts on Solana. And I think there's a big group of people like that that don't have a ton of money, but they are willing to gamble that small amount of money that they have on chain or whatever else. And then, like, the other part of my main part of my thesis for this cycle is like, this is the one where we're going to have real consumer applications break out in crypto. Because last cycle we had the proof of concept with DeFi. Before that, it was kind of iffy on what the usage of either. All these smart contract platforms used for icos. There weren't really a lot of good apps that came out of that, but DeFi was like, there's millions of dollars on chain.
00:37:56.656 - 00:38:22.604, Speaker B: There's people using these things. Like, this actually has advantages to existing systems, and now it's like, okay, what other applications can we build? We have the infra. We have enough chains to handle this. If you want to build an app chain, you want to build on Solana, you want to build on the roll up. There's enough different avenues where people can build what they want. So now it's like we need the actual applications outside of just defi. And that's been one of my other main thesis for this cycle is that you're going to have those apps.
00:38:22.604 - 00:38:43.020, Speaker B: Bitcoin, I think, is by default just the easiest one because spot ETF is approved. Been around forever. It's like you do the comparison to gold, which is at all time highs right now, breaking out for the first time in like ten years, I want to say. So you kind of have the mapping where, okay, gold's at whatever. 12 trillion bitcoins at like 1.5.
00:38:43.092 - 00:38:44.344, Speaker A: I love the comps.
00:38:46.044 - 00:38:56.620, Speaker B: In their head. Easiest to play, like your gold. 12 trillion bitcoin. 1.5 trillion. Okay, let me allocate 1% to bitcoin or 2% to bitcoin. That's like high level.
00:38:56.620 - 00:38:58.704, Speaker B: I think the three main things.
00:38:59.204 - 00:39:02.584, Speaker C: Do you think BTC will be up only or down only?
00:39:03.964 - 00:39:30.342, Speaker B: Why are you asking me this, bro? I'm super eth BTC bear. I mean, I think it'll mean revert in the short term and, like, the interim, but I still don't see it going to, like, 0.12, like, 0.1 how people think it's going to. And the reason I say that is, like, eth BTC. Back in 2017, it was just eth. Last cycle was Eth and a couple l two s.
00:39:30.342 - 00:40:07.914, Speaker B: Now it's ethan, like, ten l two s, all with multibillion dollar valuations. And all these l two s are also getting bid by people. They all have tokens. You also have competition on, like, the data availability dasi with celestia and other, like, eigen or whatever else. So it's like, before everything was on eth execution da settlement. Now it's like, eth is just settlement. And it's like, how do you reprice that with the entire ethereum ecosystem, instead of just being one coin that you bid against at eth? I think the downtrend of ETH BTC is not really representative of Eth doing bad as an asset.
00:40:07.914 - 00:40:19.626, Speaker B: It's just that ecosystem growing, and people are not adding those coins to the chart. Like, if you added all the l two s to the eth bdz chart, it's at all time highs, easily. At all time highs? Yeah, like, from cycle to cycle.
00:40:19.690 - 00:40:25.026, Speaker C: So you're actually in the camp that the l two s are parasitic to eth itself.
00:40:25.130 - 00:40:55.350, Speaker B: I don't think that. I don't want to say that they're not parasitic per se. They're necessary for eth to scale. But I think before that happens, you need to increase the activity on these l two s. Like, if you have an l two, right? So you have eth, right? And then you have, say you have x amount of activity on eth. You add an l two for the same amount of, like, fee, revenue generation, whatever. On eth, the l one, you need, like, ten x the amount of that activity on these l two s, which is, like, what they're built for, but that's gonna take years to play out.
00:40:55.350 - 00:41:07.068, Speaker B: So there's kind of an interim where you're building out all these l two s on eth, where you're shifting activity over to the l two s. But then you're gonna have to increase that activity by, like, a significant amount before it makes sense. I think that eth.
00:41:07.156 - 00:41:23.804, Speaker C: Do you see a path for eth to eventually? Well, I mean, eth is ahead of Solana now, but Solana is obviously improving at a much faster pace than ethereum but do you see a path for ethereum to catch up to Solana on the technology or ux point of view?
00:41:23.884 - 00:41:55.566, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think if you have l two s that are, like, just as good ux as soul, which I think we will have this cycle probably, then it's like, how do you get, if you can, how do you compete on the user front? So it's like, is an integrated l one just as good of a ux as an l two that has the same ux as Solana? And that's the question. It's like, how do you get users to choose your l two over the l one? Right. But I don't think, like, eth is really competing with Solana. Like, they're trying to be the most secure settlement layer, and Solana is trying to be, like, the fastest integrated l one.
00:41:55.630 - 00:41:56.230, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:41:56.382 - 00:42:16.722, Speaker A: So, you know, nerdist Internet out of nowhere. Right. And so the narrative that I'm starting to see is that Eth layer one could be the RWA layer, you know, because of the eth, all the trad five people are buying ethereum, Sirloin think so. They're trying to push this narrative. I could start to see it already.
00:42:16.818 - 00:42:19.810, Speaker C: Yeah, I pushed it. I helped them. I tried.
00:42:20.002 - 00:42:33.800, Speaker B: You did try to help them. You had a long post, 23. I remember that post. You wrote a long post on east. You were like, guys, stop saying ultrasound money and focus on this. Like, this is what it's good for. Do this.
00:42:33.800 - 00:42:34.760, Speaker B: I remember that tweet.
00:42:34.832 - 00:42:36.016, Speaker A: It's catching on.
00:42:36.200 - 00:42:37.304, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember that.
00:42:37.344 - 00:43:02.782, Speaker A: You have Athena, you have Ando Denari now, and some of the startups that we're incubating, that's coming out of our last batch of El Caso. Yeah, they're all kind of launching Ethereum mainnet because that's where the liquidity is between that and the ETF. Could there be a wedge for EtH layer one to be successful with the RWA thesis? Or is it all just going to eventually just move away to different L2s?
00:43:02.878 - 00:43:09.214, Speaker B: I mean, I think. I think either. I don't want to say either is not going to be successful. I do think either is going to be successful. I just think that the better trade this cycle is Solana.
00:43:09.254 - 00:43:09.670, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:43:09.702 - 00:43:28.908, Speaker B: But, um. But, yeah, I think Rwas make a ton of its own eth because they don't require the, like, a ton of throughput which other apps on Solana might, where it's like, you don't need to be doing a thousand transactions per second. Yeah, put rwas on eth. It's the most secure l one. Like, you just need them to whatever be on chain there. So I do think that thesis makes a lot of sense.
00:43:28.956 - 00:43:30.220, Speaker A: So Larry Fink l one.
00:43:30.372 - 00:43:34.020, Speaker B: Larry Fink l one. Yeah, Larry Fink. Yo, they should change the ticker to fink.
00:43:34.212 - 00:43:35.024, Speaker A: Fink.
00:43:35.444 - 00:43:38.084, Speaker B: Fink. I would buy fink. I would buy Fink.
00:43:38.124 - 00:43:39.564, Speaker A: I would buy a fink meme coin.
00:43:39.684 - 00:43:41.564, Speaker B: Yo, yo, we should make that.
00:43:41.604 - 00:43:42.744, Speaker A: I'll make one right now.
00:43:43.404 - 00:43:46.464, Speaker B: Pump fun. Soon as this goes live, somebody's gonna make a fake.
00:43:47.644 - 00:43:50.034, Speaker A: I'll make it, I'll make it. I'll launch it.
00:43:50.074 - 00:43:50.694, Speaker B: Bink.
00:43:51.514 - 00:43:56.826, Speaker C: But for you, from a user's point of view, is there any L2 today that offers as good of a ux as Solana?
00:43:56.930 - 00:43:57.650, Speaker B: I don't think so.
00:43:57.722 - 00:44:01.174, Speaker C: Okay. No, I don't think even like base blast.
00:44:01.794 - 00:44:19.584, Speaker B: I don't think. I mean, all the current l two s are just evml two s. Like some may have more users or like better go to market. I think base has really strong go to market with all their usually have on Coinbase. But as far as, like user experience. No, I don't think so. Like fees and like speed? I don't think so.
00:44:20.404 - 00:44:27.148, Speaker C: But the base fees are. You're saying that base is actually more expensive than Solana?
00:44:27.236 - 00:44:32.492, Speaker B: I'm saying if you had the same amount of activity on, like, that you have on Solana on base, that it would, yeah.
00:44:32.508 - 00:44:34.004, Speaker A: 300K users, 1.3 million.
00:44:34.084 - 00:44:34.580, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right.
00:44:34.612 - 00:44:35.284, Speaker A: Or something like that.
00:44:35.324 - 00:44:35.852, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:35.988 - 00:44:41.932, Speaker A: So right now they're probably at parity, right? Who the fees is it at parity? Like, what's the, if you were to.
00:44:41.948 - 00:44:54.616, Speaker C: Compare Bayes, is that parity with Solana fees wise? But in terms of TPS, base is two orders magnitude smaller, less than Solana, and all the ethereum L2s combined is one order of magnitude less.
00:44:54.640 - 00:44:55.992, Speaker A: And this is before fire dancer.
00:44:56.128 - 00:44:59.392, Speaker C: Also, this is before finance. And this is after 48 44.
00:44:59.568 - 00:44:59.896, Speaker A: Okay.
00:44:59.920 - 00:45:00.736, Speaker B: Yep, yep.
00:45:00.800 - 00:45:01.568, Speaker A: After 4848.
00:45:01.576 - 00:45:02.404, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:45:03.104 - 00:45:05.124, Speaker C: So the hope is on Monad, huh?
00:45:06.264 - 00:45:12.078, Speaker A: Well, I heard also of mega eth. Mega eth. So they're a paralyzed L2, right?
00:45:12.126 - 00:45:15.430, Speaker B: I heard, I heard of mega Eth the other day. I haven't, I haven't researched it yet.
00:45:15.462 - 00:45:23.758, Speaker C: But I talked to the founder, one of the founders of Mega EtH, and she said Mega eth will do more TPS than Monad. I don't know how, but they all say that.
00:45:23.806 - 00:45:25.966, Speaker A: They all say that. That's marketing, right?
00:45:26.030 - 00:45:42.270, Speaker C: Yeah, but I told him one of our hackathon participants. Yes, he was very, he's very technical. He used to work at, like, he went to Cornell. He's very technical. But he, he told me that building a very fast L2 is actually harder than building Monad.
00:45:42.462 - 00:45:43.614, Speaker B: Like from the ground up.
00:45:43.654 - 00:45:52.374, Speaker C: Yeah, from the ground up, because you have to work with the existing constraints of the EVM and all that stuff. So it's actually easier to build Monad as a layer one.
00:45:52.494 - 00:45:55.334, Speaker A: You don't have any dependencies, right? Ethereum or anything else like that?
00:45:55.374 - 00:46:12.716, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's what I like in my head. It's like, even if you have Eth and all the role I was building on eth, it's like if you have Monad and you have Solana, you can build l two s on Modad and Solana if you really wanted to, like, if you really needed to. So why would you not start at 10,000 DP's instead of starting at ten dbS?
00:46:12.780 - 00:46:29.628, Speaker A: Yeah. So Vitalik tweeted out a couple days ago, or somebody must have, quote, retweeted or something. I don't know how old this tweet was. He said the end game for Ethereum is ZK rollups, and then all the state route would be on a layer one. That was, that's the end game, he said.
00:46:29.756 - 00:46:32.348, Speaker C: But, yeah, this was from like a few years ago.
00:46:32.396 - 00:46:55.794, Speaker A: Okay, so that was a few years ago. Yeah, but somebody, quote, retweeted and talked about it. Okay, so is that still, do you think that's still the end game? Because he did talk about ZK roll ups in a recent article being the end game for Ethereum. So if they were to go ZK roll ups, and if, let's say, this prophecy of his comes true, would that keep Ethereum competitive to Solana?
00:46:55.914 - 00:47:19.284, Speaker B: I just don't know how long it would take. Like the, I feel like a lot of the not issues, but a lot of the things with Ethereum's roadmap is they have a lot of tech that they have to deal with. Whereas if you're building a new l one from the ground up, like hyper liquid or monad or whatever else, they don't have any of that existing type that. So it's like you have to be a lot more careful with whatever you add onto Ethereum. I think it's just a lot more.
00:47:20.304 - 00:47:26.944, Speaker A: And what would happen to the L2s that are like, optimist, optimism, optimistic roll ups. Right. Like, do they convert to ZK roll ups? Like, what does.
00:47:26.984 - 00:47:29.664, Speaker C: I think they'll convert they would convert the underlying.
00:47:29.744 - 00:47:30.382, Speaker A: Okay.
00:47:30.528 - 00:47:33.374, Speaker B: The mechanism. Right. Yeah, yeah.
00:47:34.234 - 00:47:47.626, Speaker A: So it's just an interesting endgame. I'm just curious on how that's going to compete with Solana in the long run. And Anatoly is also really focused on keeping it at layer one. But apparently on Twitter, there's a lot of L2s that are launching on Solana as well.
00:47:47.810 - 00:47:48.650, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:48.842 - 00:47:52.386, Speaker A: So I think the end game for all layer ones, they're going to have L2s whether they like it or not.
00:47:52.490 - 00:47:57.784, Speaker C: But Anatolia thinks that L2 songs on Solana won't make it faster.
00:47:58.244 - 00:48:00.436, Speaker B: I've heard that from him a few times, too. Yeah.
00:48:00.500 - 00:48:05.972, Speaker A: But I don't think it's really about throughput at this point. I think it's about customized customizability. Exactly.
00:48:06.028 - 00:48:07.020, Speaker C: Like full sovereignty.
00:48:07.092 - 00:48:07.916, Speaker A: Full sovereignty.
00:48:08.020 - 00:48:10.424, Speaker C: Owning the fees and pump the price.
00:48:10.804 - 00:48:17.304, Speaker B: But, yeah, I mean, yeah, that's only one coin. It's the l one coin. That's the only coin.
00:48:17.844 - 00:48:20.908, Speaker A: So you tell me this L2 on Solana is the only L2 on Solana.
00:48:21.036 - 00:48:23.184, Speaker C: That's the new meta. The new meta.
00:48:23.924 - 00:48:24.944, Speaker A: 50%.
00:48:26.804 - 00:48:27.892, Speaker B: Oh, man.
00:48:27.988 - 00:48:35.144, Speaker A: Oh, man. Okay, so we talked about. Do we talk about runes? Did we go into runes?
00:48:35.964 - 00:48:37.116, Speaker B: Not really. I don't think so.
00:48:37.180 - 00:48:42.344, Speaker A: Do you anything in runes that's particularly interesting outside of the stuff that's already on Twitter?
00:48:44.444 - 00:48:55.258, Speaker B: I think I've actually heard, like, chatter from feudal people. Like the bitcoin ecosystem. There's kind of, like, a lot of teams working to build something kind of similar or, like, different, but, like, different standards.
00:48:55.306 - 00:48:55.586, Speaker A: Right?
00:48:55.650 - 00:49:15.698, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I'm not sure if ruins is, like, the in end state. I don't really know. But generally, in my head, ordinals makes sense on bitcoin because of how provenance works and how they're stored, like, directly on chain with bitcoin. I think that kind of aligns with bitcoin. Being hard money, I'm, like, being around for a long time. It's like you have this inscription on this block at this time.
00:49:15.698 - 00:49:30.558, Speaker B: If you expect bitcoin to be around for, like, 50 years plus or whatever, that's. I expect that to hold value, like, whatever the most important ordinals are. And that was kind of my thesis for, like, why I thought runes would do well, too. It's like they attach, like, whatever coin to those ordinals.
00:49:30.686 - 00:49:31.526, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:49:31.670 - 00:49:34.878, Speaker B: It's like the BRC twenties or whatever.
00:49:34.926 - 00:49:39.158, Speaker A: Yeah, there's BRC twenties. It's like, I have to go get out of Ethereum and Solana.
00:49:39.206 - 00:49:46.746, Speaker B: I know, I know. There's too much going on this cycle, bro. It's too much. Just too much, dude. It's too much. Yeah.
00:49:46.770 - 00:50:01.494, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's like, coins are colors. Like colored coins, right? So, like, you can inscribe a sat, and the sat is unique in that. That specific set has a uniqueness of property, which makes it a. An ordinal.
00:50:01.874 - 00:50:07.986, Speaker C: Yeah, but are you guys still bullish on wizard pups? Yeah, wizard pups.
00:50:08.130 - 00:50:32.594, Speaker B: I think wizard is, like, the greatest meme ever. Yeah, bro, honestly, like, it's literally. Wizard is literally the meme from, like, 2012 or 2013, whatever. It was the Reddit meme when Bitcoin was at, like, 20, $30, bro. And it's like, that's the meme where the doge founder saw that meme. I was like, oh, I'm gonna make dogecoin inspiration. Yeah, it's like the meme that predated dogecoin is wizard.
00:50:32.594 - 00:50:41.718, Speaker B: It's just not. It wasn't a coin or a chain or whatever until now. So, yeah, I mean, I think both pups and wizard. I think pups is good because it's kind of like the culture.
00:50:41.806 - 00:50:43.638, Speaker A: That community is freaking autistic, man.
00:50:43.686 - 00:50:44.398, Speaker B: They're crazy.
00:50:44.486 - 00:50:50.186, Speaker A: Like, I'll tweet early days, like January, February. I tweeted, like, oh, yeah, node monkeys. Like, this is, like, the one that.
00:50:50.210 - 00:50:51.530, Speaker B: They, like, attacked you, right?
00:50:51.682 - 00:50:54.294, Speaker A: They attacked my timeline. They attacked my DM's.
00:50:55.354 - 00:50:58.346, Speaker B: Like bitcoin. Fucking, fucking January, bro. They're insane.
00:50:58.410 - 00:51:03.466, Speaker C: I have a question. So those two communities are. They're not bitcoin maxis, are they?
00:51:03.570 - 00:51:04.754, Speaker A: They're not Maxi.
00:51:04.794 - 00:51:14.388, Speaker C: They're not Max. By definition, they're not maxis. But are they originally bitcoiners, or are they communities that move from, let's say, ethereum or solana to bitcoin?
00:51:14.556 - 00:51:31.964, Speaker B: I'm not sure. So the bare thesis for or nose and runes or whatever is. Is that, like, you're not tapping into new bitcoin money that hadn't been involved in anything else. You're just tapping into DJ's that are acting like new bitcoin money is tapping into these new things, like DJ's that already exists and all these other ecosystems.
00:51:32.004 - 00:51:32.484, Speaker C: Right, right.
00:51:32.564 - 00:51:34.100, Speaker B: That's like the bear thesis.
00:51:34.172 - 00:51:40.944, Speaker C: That's the mercenary. Yeah, yeah. Barry, are you bullish on the bitcoin ecosystem in general?
00:51:41.424 - 00:52:07.178, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I do think there's just a ton of capital there. I mean, I'm taking the other side. I think there's a ton of capital, like, in bitcoin. They'll just hold it in their whatever hardware wallets. Like long term, they don't really plan on using it and don't really like eth, don't really like these other chains, coins, whatever. And I have seen those people, I know that those people exist for sure. So if you can tap into them and like get them to do DJ and stuff, there's a ton of money because bitcoin is like the largest coin by far.
00:52:07.178 - 00:52:14.318, Speaker B: There's a ton of money there. If you can tap that, that's like a lot of liquidity to unlock. And there's a ton of. A few teams are trying to tap that liquidity.
00:52:14.406 - 00:52:20.566, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I think Udi and Eric are working on Opicat, which is the bridge, that.
00:52:20.590 - 00:52:23.382, Speaker C: Kind of competitor to BiTVM.
00:52:23.478 - 00:52:32.190, Speaker A: Bitvm, yeah. And that should make runes compatible across all L2s, right? I believe that's correct.
00:52:32.262 - 00:52:33.394, Speaker B: I think so, yeah.
00:52:33.974 - 00:52:41.430, Speaker A: A lot of the cool stuff that comes out of it. So I'm bullish. Quantum cats and the team behind it, obviously. Anything else you guys want to shout about?
00:52:41.542 - 00:52:43.514, Speaker C: Anything else you're excited in crypto?
00:52:45.294 - 00:52:49.478, Speaker B: Honestly, I'm excited for the rest of the cycle, man. I think it's going to get really, really crazy.
00:52:49.646 - 00:52:50.486, Speaker A: Where do you think we are?
00:52:50.550 - 00:52:51.366, Speaker B: Really crazy.
00:52:51.430 - 00:52:52.150, Speaker A: Where are we in the cycle?
00:52:52.182 - 00:52:55.326, Speaker B: I think we're inning three.
00:52:55.470 - 00:52:56.014, Speaker A: Get out.
00:52:56.054 - 00:52:58.998, Speaker B: I swear to God, I'm dead serious.
00:52:59.046 - 00:52:59.438, Speaker A: Wow.
00:52:59.526 - 00:53:08.730, Speaker B: I swear. Well, think about it. Like, bitco, bitcoins at all time highs or like floating around all time highs. If you look at all the other altcoins, they're shit.
00:53:08.762 - 00:53:10.314, Speaker A: Yeah, bro.
00:53:10.394 - 00:53:32.910, Speaker B: Everything's down against BT's top. Like, I saw something the other day that said like 60% of the or 70% of the top 50 alts are down against bitcoin. Like over the or the year. If you look at the total three chart, which is like the total all coin market cap, that's still 50% down from its last previous all time high. Um, Solana stillness at all time high by market cap. Eclipse it. Ethereum.
00:53:32.910 - 00:53:38.462, Speaker B: Still not an all time high by market cap. There's only really, the only thing that's ripped is like, memes. Yeah, that's it.
00:53:38.558 - 00:53:38.814, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:53:38.854 - 00:53:49.950, Speaker B: And like, I see my, my account, like my twitter account has gone crazy. So I know there's at least some new retail coming into crypto. I'm up like plus like 300k followers since December. Something insane.
00:53:50.142 - 00:53:50.662, Speaker A: What?
00:53:50.758 - 00:53:56.034, Speaker B: Yeah. No, literally. Yeah. Getting like one hundred k a month. Jeez. No, it's crazy.
00:53:56.334 - 00:54:01.518, Speaker C: When I first follow you in January, you are a sub 100 and now you are like, what, 500,000?
00:54:01.606 - 00:54:04.926, Speaker B: Like, 410, 400, 1014k or something like that. I did.
00:54:04.950 - 00:54:08.766, Speaker A: Followed you around. Bald. Did you get. Did you get rugged on bald?
00:54:08.910 - 00:54:09.806, Speaker B: I missed. Bald.
00:54:09.870 - 00:54:10.514, Speaker A: Okay.
00:54:10.814 - 00:54:17.118, Speaker B: God. Bald, bro. I was like that. I knew base or what base was launching. I was in the Hamptons. I think that was last. That'd be last summer.
00:54:17.118 - 00:54:27.406, Speaker B: I was like, I was in the Hamptons. I'm like, base is launching. I'm like, bros. I know there's gonna be coins on base. 100% going to be coins on base. I don't know what they are, but I know it's gonna be coin on base. I go to sleep, wake up ball.
00:54:27.406 - 00:54:31.886, Speaker B: It's like a trillion percent up, so. That's so annoying. I hate that.
00:54:31.910 - 00:54:45.434, Speaker A: Don't worry, it was good. Chow and I were like. Cause that night, I'm like, yo, I'm going in. So I went in, was up to, like, 30 million, like, showing off or whatever. Got my ass handed to me.
00:54:46.094 - 00:55:08.234, Speaker B: He rugged that hard? You broke that super hard. But, yeah, so, I mean, there's like. I know there's a ton of new retail coming into crypto. I know there's people who weren't in crypto before trading crypto. Cause, like, some of my friends who saw me trade crypto the past few years are starting to trade crypto now. But, like, as far as, like, that big markup, I don't think we've really had that yet. I honestly really don't think we've had it.
00:55:08.694 - 00:55:10.286, Speaker A: Do you feel the same way?
00:55:10.470 - 00:55:13.226, Speaker C: So Don's reign is over.
00:55:13.390 - 00:55:17.774, Speaker B: Don. You hit Don versus Ansel. One, duck, zero.
00:55:20.234 - 00:55:23.498, Speaker C: What do you. What do you think of Don? Like, what happened to him? Like, he used to be a. I.
00:55:23.506 - 00:55:34.258, Speaker B: Like Don a lot. Yeah, Don's great. I mean, Don's super smart. He's a really good trader. I mean, you gotta. You gotta think, like, Don also just had a kid, so he, like, he's, like, public about. That's not, like, hidden information, but he just had a kid.
00:55:34.258 - 00:55:46.224, Speaker B: And, like, when I went through that, like, you just had a kid, and it's like, you're not really paying attention to markets. I know he hasn't been paying attention to markets for a fact. I know he hasn't been. He just saw you can't do it. You literally can't do it in the first few months.
00:55:46.264 - 00:55:48.656, Speaker A: Well, I have two kids, and he has two kids, so, like, we get it.
00:55:48.680 - 00:56:01.724, Speaker B: Yeah, it's crazy. So it's like, if you haven't been tapped in the markets. You look at, you pull up whatever trading view deck, screener. It's 80% meme coins. The only thing that's gone up is meme coins. People are like, meme coins. Super cycle.
00:56:01.724 - 00:56:18.210, Speaker B: It's like, dude, yeah, we're top. So I understand why, like, he has that thesis. Does it make sense? Yeah, yeah. Cause they, like, memes usually go last. I said this the other day. They usually go last after everything else. But now it's like, none of the alts have gone yet.
00:56:18.210 - 00:56:22.202, Speaker B: Nothing has really moved yet, so. Yeah.
00:56:22.378 - 00:56:23.898, Speaker A: All right, two more. You have any more?
00:56:23.946 - 00:56:24.410, Speaker C: No, go ahead.
00:56:24.442 - 00:56:28.594, Speaker A: Two more. There's a mailbag of people that have asked a couple questions that.
00:56:28.634 - 00:56:31.002, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
00:56:31.058 - 00:56:34.574, Speaker A: I want to hear your. With war story because.
00:56:34.654 - 00:56:35.038, Speaker B: Okay.
00:56:35.086 - 00:56:40.414, Speaker A: We went through our own with war story. We bought around. I think I bought once I saw your tweet.
00:56:40.494 - 00:56:40.822, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:40.878 - 00:56:44.854, Speaker A: And this was around. It was yours or block rays or. You retweeted block rays or something.
00:56:44.934 - 00:56:46.390, Speaker C: Yeah, December.
00:56:46.502 - 00:56:56.086, Speaker A: This is early December. And it was. It went from 30 to, like, three or some shit. It, like, it crashed.
00:56:56.270 - 00:56:56.654, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:56.694 - 00:57:12.314, Speaker A: And then you tweeted or something, and I just. Yeah, I went and that shit, like. Like, so here's our war story, right? It went around there. We bought. It went up to, like, a hundred or something, and then. And then it would dropped again.
00:57:12.394 - 00:57:12.674, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:12.714 - 00:57:14.146, Speaker A: Like, fuck. Should I hold it or something?
00:57:14.210 - 00:57:14.826, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:57:14.890 - 00:57:16.346, Speaker A: And we just held it, right? Yeah.
00:57:16.370 - 00:57:16.962, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
00:57:17.018 - 00:57:19.730, Speaker A: And so that was, like, our war story. I want to hear your war story, bro.
00:57:19.762 - 00:57:34.820, Speaker B: The whip story is insane. It's so insane. Like, it was so random. I mean, so I started so one day, I think it was in December. This is like, after bonk went crazy. So bog was kind of like, October. Solana ripped finally out, like, above 30.
00:57:34.820 - 00:57:46.356, Speaker B: I was like, finally, thank God Solana's moving. I'm like, I'm done with these people telling me I'm crazy for however long Solana starts moving. And I'm like, okay, guys, there's only so many alts on Solana. You can buy. Buy. Bonk. Bonk went crazy.
00:57:46.356 - 00:57:52.984, Speaker B: And then it's like, now everybody's trading on Solana. Every group that's like, Solana. Solana. Solana. Solana. Solana. And somebody was like, z, make a telegram.
00:57:52.984 - 00:57:53.964, Speaker B: Okay.
00:57:54.004 - 00:57:55.148, Speaker A: Oh, this is the manlets, right?
00:57:55.196 - 00:57:55.420, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:55.452 - 00:57:57.300, Speaker A: So I was in this day one.
00:57:57.372 - 00:58:09.006, Speaker B: Yeah, dude. So I was like, boom, okay. Made a telegram. And it's like, ton of people just flooded into it. Like, oh, we want to trade on Solana. Solana manlets or whatever. Cause that's when I was like, solana manlets roll call every single week.
00:58:09.006 - 00:58:15.394, Speaker B: Like, every single week, it was like, boom, 10%. Boom, 10%. Boom, 10%. And I would just do it. Solana man's roll call.
00:58:16.294 - 00:58:20.086, Speaker A: I think you had a daily write up or a weekly write up. There's a moderator that did that in your chat.
00:58:20.150 - 00:58:27.272, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, everybody was on, so that I made a chat for it, and, like, everybody's flooded into the chat. So in that chat, there's a micro caps channel.
00:58:27.398 - 00:58:27.660, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:27.692 - 00:58:32.036, Speaker B: And it's, like, millions and millions and millions of messages. It's like, dude, it's the most djing place.
00:58:32.100 - 00:58:32.628, Speaker A: It's insane.
00:58:32.676 - 00:58:47.876, Speaker B: It's insane. They'll post, like, ten k mark cap coins in there. Honeycake markup coins in there. Not SAP trading all day. So in December, 1 of the coins they kept talking about was with, like, with dog with that. Yeah, and they kept spamming with me with it, like, all the time. Like, spamming, spamming, spam.
00:58:47.876 - 00:59:00.800, Speaker B: Z, what do you think about this one? What do you think about this? What do you think about this? And then in the chat, I was, like, watching this before. So I met this girl. I met this girl, like, out in New York. Whatever. I'm talking to her about crypto. She asked me what I do. I'm like, I'm trade crypto.
00:59:00.800 - 00:59:04.792, Speaker B: I'm on crypto Twitter. I'm showing her crypto Twitter, showing her all the memes and stuff.
00:59:04.848 - 00:59:06.256, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:59:06.280 - 00:59:19.980, Speaker B: And I tweet. I'm like, yo, the number one meme that replies to this was, like, as many replies. I'm gonna retweet it. I replies to my friend's post, her Twitter. I just gave her a Twitter. They're like, the best meme. I'm gonna retweet it.
00:59:19.980 - 00:59:32.748, Speaker B: So I get a ton of replies, like, under all of her tweets, whatever. Like, yo, da da da da da da. And wiff edited the hat on her profile picture and posted it. And then I replied to it.
00:59:32.756 - 00:59:33.628, Speaker A: You get that meme?
00:59:33.716 - 00:59:36.220, Speaker B: It's so good. It's so good, it's so good.
00:59:36.252 - 00:59:37.584, Speaker A: The beauty of that meme.
00:59:37.884 - 00:59:46.430, Speaker B: So I reply to that, go back and forth, whatever. This is when it went, like, one hundred k mark cap, and I'm just, like, replying back and forth. I retweeted it, whatever. Nobody really paid attention to it.
00:59:46.492 - 00:59:47.002, Speaker A: I didn't either.
00:59:47.058 - 00:59:58.026, Speaker B: Nobody really paid attention. Somebody saw it. Okay, cool. Z is doing random stuff on Twitter. Cool. That happened. And then I think in the chat, somebody was, like, asking about whiff.
00:59:58.026 - 01:00:05.970, Speaker B: And I was like, yeah, whiff is funny. And they screenshot it. Like, z said, whiff is funny. And like, put it on Twitter, repost it everywhere. Everybody was following my account. Like, z said it was funny. Z said it was funny.
01:00:05.970 - 01:00:31.532, Speaker B: I think it went to, like a million or whatever. So now it's at a million, and then I'm out for, like, santacon, same girl and my boy, a couple other people, and we're just drunk, like, walking down the street, or we're just like, talking whatever. I go live on Twitter, I'm like, yo, I'm going live. What should we talk about? So we started talking about meme coins. And everybody's like, yo, what meme coin? Like, what's your favorite meme coin? Somebody's like, mock. Like, what's your favorite meme coin? Somebody's like, mock. And I asked the girl, like, what's your favorite meme coin? She goes, dog with hat.
01:00:31.532 - 01:00:50.872, Speaker B: And she's like, I was like, what? No way. She just said dog with, like, just random. I didn't ask her to say anything on the hive. She's remembered from the past week, the whiff. And she said it again. She's like, dog with hat. And so when she said that on stream, that was that day when you were saying, like, when it went one, like 1015 or whatever, up to, like, 20.
01:00:50.872 - 01:00:53.728, Speaker B: Yeah, like, it went from one to like, yes, 20.
01:00:53.776 - 01:00:54.696, Speaker A: And that was when I caught it.
01:00:54.720 - 01:00:56.824, Speaker B: Yeah, and I was out. We're just out, like, drinking, chilling, whatever.
01:00:56.864 - 01:00:57.484, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:00:58.024 - 01:01:12.240, Speaker B: So when I see it, I wake up and my mentions are just like, people blowing me up by whiff. Just blow me up. Like, oh, there might, there might be something here. And then that's when I. That's when I tweeted that, yo, guys, like, I think I just found the next, like, $100 million meme coin.
01:01:12.272 - 01:01:12.600, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:12.672 - 01:01:27.504, Speaker B: And the replies are like, what coin is it? What coin is it? What coin is it? And then somebody was like, does the coin have a hat? And I was like, yeah, nothing. I was like, yeah. And I was like, yeah, so that's when. That's when that shit happened. Went from, like, the three mil bottom or whatever.
01:01:27.544 - 01:01:28.504, Speaker A: It was a three mil bottom.
01:01:28.584 - 01:01:47.778, Speaker B: That's when we around there, and then it was gone. From there, it went to 100 mil, and then it chopped around for like three months. Yeah, like, I think it would like, yeah, it was like 200. It was like 200 miles, $0.30. It was 100 mil, $0.20, like 200 ML, like eight cents. And it was just like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
01:01:47.778 - 01:02:04.842, Speaker B: And whole time I'm just like, just memeing the whiff, like going around people. I'm wearing the hat, putting the hat on people, like, just whatever, just memeing with. And then eventually, like, it went from thirty cents to like $3. I was just, just ripped it ncs and I was like three. I think it's like three right now.
01:02:04.898 - 01:02:06.238, Speaker A: It's 3350 or something.
01:02:06.346 - 01:02:07.062, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:02:07.118 - 01:02:09.034, Speaker A: We're still following it very closely, obviously.
01:02:10.854 - 01:02:12.794, Speaker B: Every hour, every hour, every.
01:02:16.014 - 01:02:17.022, Speaker A: Portfolio refresh.
01:02:17.078 - 01:02:24.310, Speaker B: Yeah, literally. Literally. But it's crazy. Cause so many people have, like, been fading it the whole way.
01:02:24.382 - 01:02:24.966, Speaker A: I don't know why.
01:02:25.030 - 01:02:25.430, Speaker B: I don't know.
01:02:25.462 - 01:02:26.342, Speaker A: Dog hasn't fucking hated.
01:02:26.398 - 01:02:45.938, Speaker B: They hate it so much. I'm like, why, bro? It's just a dog with a hat, bro. Like, you don't have to hate the coin. You don't have to buy the coin. But, but the thing was, so many people that hated it, they just kept adding fuel to the fire. And now it's like the most, like, it has the most attention out of any other altcoin. It's been number one trading on Solana for like months.
01:02:45.938 - 01:02:51.738, Speaker B: Like, number one out of all the other alts. Yeah, it's crazy. No, it's crazy.
01:02:51.826 - 01:02:55.202, Speaker C: Don is actually the best thing that happened to wiff in the last couple weeks.
01:02:55.218 - 01:02:56.162, Speaker B: He's like, oh, I'm shorting it.
01:02:56.178 - 01:02:57.254, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm shorting it.
01:02:57.674 - 01:03:02.434, Speaker B: Everybody else is like, finally it's time. It's time. Send everybody else piles it short.
01:03:03.094 - 01:03:04.966, Speaker C: And I think he got liquidated today.
01:03:05.110 - 01:03:09.942, Speaker B: Yeah, I think he closed it short, but it's above where he shorted that. Like, where everybody swings above that.
01:03:09.998 - 01:03:10.954, Speaker C: Like with a don.
01:03:11.254 - 01:03:15.566, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, we need more shorts.
01:03:15.670 - 01:03:19.318, Speaker B: We need more shorts. For sure, for sure, for sure.
01:03:19.486 - 01:03:23.398, Speaker A: All right, I'm going to go through the tweets, some of the tweets, and then we'll end it from here.
01:03:23.446 - 01:03:24.102, Speaker B: All right, cool.
01:03:24.198 - 01:03:26.454, Speaker C: I do want to talk about stuff outside of crypto.
01:03:26.574 - 01:03:28.278, Speaker A: Yeah, we should. Once you start that, I'll pull up.
01:03:28.286 - 01:03:30.406, Speaker C: The, I don't know. What do you want to talk about?
01:03:30.470 - 01:03:30.982, Speaker B: Crypto?
01:03:31.078 - 01:03:31.326, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:31.350 - 01:03:33.954, Speaker C: What's politics? Election.
01:03:34.574 - 01:03:58.214, Speaker B: Your politics is gonna be crazy, bro. I mean, politics is gonna be crazy now. Cause, like, crypto's kind of a part of it. Yeah, it's like, I think at the last, whatever, Trump had his rally, like, for his NFT holders, his first NFT holders in Florida. He had, like, a rally for crypto people there and let basically anybody ask him whatever crypto questions you want. He was like, pretty pro crypto. He's like, yeah, like, whatever.
01:03:58.214 - 01:04:12.850, Speaker B: Like, I'll support anything crypto needs to happen in the US. Like, I'm supportive of it. He's, like, talking shit about Biden. He's like, Biden's not supporting crypto. The Democrats hate crypto. They really messed up. Cause, like, they've been very anti crypto for a lot of these, the past few years or whatever.
01:04:12.850 - 01:04:41.154, Speaker B: Like, Warren's been super against crypto and very outspoken against crypto in Congress and everything. And so Trump's like, okay, I can use this as a trump card against them. And, like, I'm gonna support. Crypto doesn't really, like, right now he realizes that it's, like, the follow through on it doesn't even have to be super strong as long as he's like, I'm in support of this. I'm not, like, anti this like they are. And I think that's good for us just generally because the Democrats don't want to, like, lose votes because they're anti crypto.
01:04:41.934 - 01:04:43.794, Speaker C: Are you a single issue voter?
01:04:44.334 - 01:04:46.342, Speaker B: I don't know, man. I'm trying to figure it out.
01:04:46.518 - 01:05:02.114, Speaker C: So crypto aside, like, assuming both parties are aligned on crypto, who would you vote for? What are, like, basically what I'm asking is, what are some of the other issues you care about? Um, it's okay if you don't want to talk about it.
01:05:02.154 - 01:05:10.194, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't want to get roasted on Twitter for this, but, yeah, I'm not. I'm honestly not really strong on either party, honestly. Um.
01:05:10.354 - 01:05:21.774, Speaker A: All right, there's a lot of good ones. This is from Allen Nation, 428. What are the kinds of apps that you see building on top of Solana once we get that crazy fire dancer throughput? Eyeballs?
01:05:22.314 - 01:05:58.024, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm really excited for, like, consumer focused applications that require a ton of, like, microtransactions in app. On Solana, I think that that's, like, the biggest, biggest unlock, whether it's, like, a minigame where people have to do, like, a ton of things in the app, or if it's, like, a social thing or they're going out and, like, meeting with people in person and doing things in app. I think trading is, like, I give me, like, an obvious one. It's just, obviously trading should be big. But, yeah, I'm really excited about the consumer stuff. I think stuff like helium is cool. Hivemapper I think is cool.
01:05:58.024 - 01:06:02.296, Speaker B: But, yeah, mostly consumer focused stuff. And then real world, deep end, deep end stuff.
01:06:02.480 - 01:06:08.728, Speaker C: Deep end technically has a micropayment component, like when people get paid in the native token. That's a micropayment.
01:06:08.776 - 01:06:16.832, Speaker B: Exactly. That's why a lot of those teams moved either from their own l one or whatever other chain they were on. I think render also moved to Solana, right?
01:06:16.848 - 01:06:17.168, Speaker C: That's right.
01:06:17.216 - 01:06:29.150, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. So a lot of those teams realized that and, like, yeah, this is the only chain we really can, like, be on long term. So I think that's a big advantage. I don't see that talked about enough. Like, the deep end on Solana, I think, is an underrated kind of thesis.
01:06:29.182 - 01:06:35.646, Speaker A: Even the transaction does, like. It does, like, spoofing checks. So it checks to see if someone is spoofing to mine the tokens.
01:06:35.710 - 01:06:35.950, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:06:35.982 - 01:06:51.396, Speaker A: So they run like 100 of these nodes. Right. And they try to, like, spoof it so they can extract value. So they. Every few minutes or something, they do a spoof check to see if it's real and if it's a real transaction. And that happens every day, like every minute. So that's like, I think that's one element of, like, microtransactions.
01:06:51.396 - 01:06:53.716, Speaker A: Data credits. Purchasing data credits for helium.
01:06:53.780 - 01:06:54.284, Speaker B: Yep.
01:06:54.404 - 01:06:55.324, Speaker A: That's also another one.
01:06:55.364 - 01:06:55.988, Speaker B: Yep.
01:06:56.156 - 01:07:01.660, Speaker A: Okay. These guys, man, look, I'm just gonna bring it up because it's just like the. The puppets, they just.
01:07:01.692 - 01:07:02.404, Speaker B: Puppets are on you.
01:07:02.444 - 01:07:06.460, Speaker A: No, no, no. There's another community. These guys spam every one of my tweets.
01:07:06.532 - 01:07:06.924, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:07:07.004 - 01:07:14.060, Speaker A: I'm just gonna bring it up because they have balls, right? So have you heard talk about hybrid Nft and tokens?
01:07:14.092 - 01:07:18.422, Speaker B: Yo, they're crazy too. Yeah, they're crazy too. They're crazy.
01:07:18.508 - 01:07:29.946, Speaker A: They just, I mean, they got really good memes. So I'm just gonna give it to them because I don't have any. I don't have a bag here, so I just. They're good community, so I'm gonna bring it up. What do you think about hybrid Nft tokens?
01:07:30.010 - 01:07:46.206, Speaker B: Yes. I mean, I do think it makes a ton of sense. I think that the. One of the reasons that meme coins have kind of evolved from NFT's last cycle. The issue with NFT's last cycle is it was kind of capped by the 10,000 pictures, whatever. With meme coins. It's not capped by that at all.
01:07:46.206 - 01:08:12.166, Speaker B: It's whatever. So there's many holders as you want. And it's like, meme coins are also kind of NFTs. If you look on Twitter right now, you see people, the wif guys, the meaty guys, their profile picture is literally the meme dressed in a different fit or a different hat or a different version of it. So it's kind of like the NFT on the profile picture side. But it's funny cause literally they're fungible tokens. Like, fungible tokens.
01:08:12.166 - 01:08:16.838, Speaker B: So I think what's gonna happen is, like, you're gonna have a combination of these things.
01:08:16.886 - 01:08:17.246, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:08:17.310 - 01:08:37.046, Speaker B: Where it's like, you can either hold, like, the NFT or you hold some, like, piece of the NFT as a token, but it's still, like a community of where you don't need the actual NFT to, like, make it your PFP or whatever. It's kind of like if you could add hundreds of thousands of people to your base NFT set collection.
01:08:37.110 - 01:08:37.398, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:08:37.446 - 01:08:46.332, Speaker B: But they just don't have enough money to afford the actual NFT. And that was, like, one of the problems last cycle is, like, at some point, bored apes are at $300,000 and.
01:08:46.348 - 01:08:47.044, Speaker A: No one's gonna buy that.
01:08:47.084 - 01:08:50.464, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like, who has 300? Like, regular people don't have 300.
01:08:51.324 - 01:08:53.012, Speaker C: Which. Why did they launch the ape token and then.
01:08:53.028 - 01:08:56.676, Speaker B: Yeah, and then they launched the ape token, but it wasn't like the four. The actual four thing.
01:08:56.740 - 01:08:59.820, Speaker A: Yeah, there's no value. Like, you know, there's no value accrual.
01:08:59.892 - 01:09:00.940, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:09:01.052 - 01:09:10.584, Speaker A: So that was asked by Babush Hodl. And then one of his friends, Bozo Shaman said, ask him about the night in Miami where I sold him on hybrids.
01:09:11.764 - 01:09:12.316, Speaker B: Damn.
01:09:12.380 - 01:09:20.144, Speaker A: I don't know. He sent this. I just saw this.
01:09:21.684 - 01:09:22.220, Speaker B: It's you.
01:09:22.252 - 01:09:23.260, Speaker A: The boxing.
01:09:23.452 - 01:09:27.596, Speaker B: Yeah, bro, that meme has been used.
01:09:27.700 - 01:09:29.904, Speaker A: Yo, it's the best meme ever.
01:09:30.564 - 01:09:32.020, Speaker C: How is there not a meme, bro?
01:09:32.132 - 01:09:32.904, Speaker A: It's like.
01:09:35.164 - 01:09:36.984, Speaker B: That shit is so funny.
01:09:37.523 - 01:09:51.543, Speaker A: All right. I think we couldn't end it with a really good note, right? This is asked by erebos 991. Thoughts around charity and crypto. So much wealth is creating our industry, but very little is given away to those that help in need.
01:09:52.123 - 01:10:14.872, Speaker B: I mean, I tweeted a few months ago, I was like, bro, we're gonna make. If this cycle does what I think it's gonna do, and it goes, like, 10 trillion, all of us who literally have been in from the bottom. We're gonna give away so much money to people this cycle. Like, it's gonna be insane. Cause I was gonna have so much money to spend. And you kind of saw it last cycle, like, when Kobe would do the raids on people's twitch streams. Like, yo, we're gonna rate this guy's twitch stream.
01:10:14.872 - 01:10:31.224, Speaker B: This guy's playing the guitar, chillin, like 100 viewers, and kobe be like, yo, guys, boom, we're gonna rate this guy's stream. And everybody just like, throw ten, throw 100. Like, that could be a product. Yeah, that could be a product. That could be a product. Yeah. I mean, dude, I think charity is gonna be really big.
01:10:31.224 - 01:11:01.868, Speaker B: I mean, it's just like. It's really on the leaders in crypto, the guys with the biggest followings, kind of like, direct people to doing that. Because if you directed people or, like, had your thesis online about whatever, xcoin, whatever x idea, people make money off that. Those are people who are, like, willing to support whatever, like, you're working on whatever you think is good, especially if you don't ask them for anything, especially if you did it for free. So there's a ton of people like that in crypto. Like, the cycle of giving back to people who helped you on crypto, super, super strong. That's why I think charity is going to be big.
01:11:01.868 - 01:11:03.344, Speaker B: No, for sure. At the top.
01:11:04.804 - 01:11:07.132, Speaker C: Hold on. You said this cycle we're going to 10 trillion.
01:11:07.188 - 01:11:08.596, Speaker B: 10 trillion, yeah, for sure.
01:11:08.740 - 01:11:09.904, Speaker C: We're at two now.
01:11:10.254 - 01:11:11.470, Speaker B: Two point something.
01:11:11.582 - 01:11:15.270, Speaker C: So you're saying bitcoin is gonna go to 200, 300?
01:11:15.342 - 01:11:15.686, Speaker A: Let me check.
01:11:15.710 - 01:11:17.302, Speaker C: Two hundred fifty k. Two hundred fifty, really?
01:11:17.358 - 01:11:22.670, Speaker B: Two hundred fifty k? I think 250k. Run it, run it, run it, run it, run it.
01:11:22.862 - 01:11:26.234, Speaker A: I'm down. Cool. Any final question, Shaw?
01:11:28.614 - 01:11:32.118, Speaker C: No, I was trying to think of a time when you got roasted recently.
01:11:32.206 - 01:11:39.174, Speaker B: But I'm getting roasted non stop. We already talked about the pool, bro. We already talked about the pool. We did that already. We did that.
01:11:40.394 - 01:11:42.650, Speaker A: Or the boxing box.
01:11:42.722 - 01:11:44.694, Speaker B: Yeah, boxing. The fool thing.
01:11:45.234 - 01:11:58.602, Speaker A: Yo, you know what's funny? When someone took the. The whiff guy dancing and they put you. That was.
01:11:58.698 - 01:11:59.746, Speaker B: That's his comedy.
01:11:59.850 - 01:12:00.810, Speaker A: That was his comedy.
01:12:00.842 - 01:12:05.886, Speaker B: That shit is comedy, bro. That shit is the best industry, man. It's literally.
01:12:05.910 - 01:12:06.238, Speaker A: I'll never.
01:12:06.286 - 01:12:09.874, Speaker B: There's no sense non stop entertainment. I'll never leave non stop entertainment.
