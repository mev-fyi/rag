00:00:00.090 - 00:00:02.954, Speaker A: The thing that a lot of people don't understand is it's not the narrative.
00:00:03.002 - 00:00:03.898, Speaker B: That creates.
00:00:03.994 - 00:00:05.034, Speaker A: Price action.
00:00:05.162 - 00:00:07.226, Speaker B: It'S price action that creates.
00:00:07.338 - 00:00:08.538, Speaker A: The narrative.
00:00:08.714 - 00:00:11.246, Speaker B: If you actually analyze the historical data.
00:00:11.348 - 00:00:13.034, Speaker A: Pre important events.
00:00:13.162 - 00:00:13.870, Speaker B: Like whether.
00:00:13.940 - 00:00:28.166, Speaker A: It'S 1559 upgrade or bitcoin fork or whatever, there's nothing that says that the pump needs to happen two months before the scheduled event. Like it could easily be a week before, which.
00:00:28.188 - 00:00:31.334, Speaker B: Is what actually happened with 1559, by the way.
00:00:31.452 - 00:00:31.890, Speaker A: Yep.
00:00:31.970 - 00:00:35.622, Speaker B: So why did the price go up? Started going up two months before.
00:00:35.676 - 00:00:37.746, Speaker A: The scheduled event. It's not the narrative.
00:00:37.778 - 00:00:39.666, Speaker B: It's the price action. It's the price action.
00:00:39.698 - 00:00:41.042, Speaker A: That creates the narrative.
00:00:41.186 - 00:00:42.950, Speaker B: Because the price went up, people thought.
00:00:43.020 - 00:00:44.450, Speaker A: Oh, this is because of the merch.
