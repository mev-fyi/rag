00:00:00.320 - 00:00:22.462, Speaker A: Single biggest elephant in the room that we, as an industry somehow ignored was the fact that you have this giant exchange and you have this giant market maker. A really dominant market maker. Yeah. And they had the same route. They were probably run by the same group of people in the same penthouse in trad five. This would not, it would not fly. They would not fly.
00:00:22.462 - 00:00:44.584, Speaker A: There's a reason why there's regulations around, like chinese walls between the market making branch and the banking business at those investment banks. By the way, this regulation, actually, I think it was ruled out during the GFC in 2008. They put a chinese walk between the market making and the banking side of things. But somehow we, as an industry just normalize this. But in hindsight, that was one of the biggest red flags for me.
