00:00:00.320 - 00:00:04.074, Speaker A: Welcome to good game. Your no b's insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.854 - 00:00:10.126, Speaker B: My Twitter feed is very bearish, but.
00:00:10.190 - 00:00:17.598, Speaker A: It was bearish for some reason. Like, I swear to God, like last bull market, it was like insanely bullish.
00:00:17.766 - 00:00:18.494, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:18.654 - 00:00:23.654, Speaker A: And now it seems like everyone's just so bearish all the time. I see bullishness.
00:00:23.774 - 00:00:26.374, Speaker B: I feel like people are over allocated to alts.
00:00:26.534 - 00:00:26.878, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:26.926 - 00:00:55.428, Speaker B: Which is the average person, or leverage, or leveraged, which is the average person on Twitter. But. So I don't know what that consensus is in a broader market, but I think was it web3 quant that launched a poll and I guess his followers where the market is today? And in that poll the consensus was that it's a consolidation, was a bullish consolidation. And I'm personally not far away from that consensus.
00:00:55.556 - 00:00:59.380, Speaker A: So the crowd is actually right for once because usually you counter the crowd. Right.
00:00:59.452 - 00:01:03.664, Speaker B: Well, maybe we're. Maybe we're both wrong. Maybe we're both wrong.
00:01:04.524 - 00:01:06.804, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto?
00:01:06.924 - 00:01:08.556, Speaker B: Check out our request for startups list.
00:01:08.580 - 00:01:21.364, Speaker A: And get inspired at Alliance XYZ ideas. Welcome to good game. Today we're going to be talking about the return of GCR and World War Three.
00:01:22.704 - 00:01:24.072, Speaker B: Are you serious or.
00:01:24.208 - 00:01:25.524, Speaker A: No, I'm not.
00:01:29.504 - 00:01:30.896, Speaker B: Let's talk about it anyway.
00:01:31.080 - 00:02:01.654, Speaker A: I mean, we'll add it, but I think what we should talk about, I mean, there's a lot of stuff happening on bitcoin and ordinals again, so I want to touch on that. There's the markets. How are the markets reacting to this new era that we're probably entering into? I'd love to touch on the Hong Kong ETF's Uniswap recently received a wells notice. Our, I think Alpha, which no one really is talking about outside of some communities in the east, is tan.
00:02:03.634 - 00:02:05.058, Speaker B: 3074.
00:02:05.186 - 00:02:14.092, Speaker A: Yep. I haven't done much research on it. It's on my list of like 100 different things I need to do. So if you've read through it, I'd love to pick your brain on it.
00:02:14.188 - 00:02:14.932, Speaker B: I haven't.
00:02:15.068 - 00:02:34.852, Speaker A: Okay, we'll read through it with the audience here. How about that bowdoin nfts. And then we could talk about the pups wizards fight for number one. We could also talk about pups and nodes fighting to be the collection. Yeah. So let's start with BTC having.
00:02:35.028 - 00:02:35.948, Speaker B: BTC having.
00:02:36.036 - 00:02:57.594, Speaker A: Oh yeah, I totally forgot about that. And the upcoming runes launch. I also want to talk about what Udi said recently, which is, it turns out runes, if you were to trade runes, it's similar to the BRC 20 experience, which is a very shitty experience. But Opcat could fix it and I want to know what op Cat's all about. So we're going to dig deeper into that.
00:02:57.714 - 00:02:58.362, Speaker B: All right.
00:02:58.498 - 00:03:10.872, Speaker A: All right. So let's get started. So it seems to me that the markets has taken a downturn and now people are wondering whether or not the bull market's over.
00:03:11.048 - 00:03:17.352, Speaker B: I don't know what happened there, to be honest, because BTC is still at where it was two months ago. 65k.
00:03:17.488 - 00:03:20.528, Speaker A: Yeah. So it seems like we're consolidating. To me it seems like we're consolidating.
00:03:20.656 - 00:03:24.284, Speaker B: So why is my timeline. Why is my timeline complaining?
00:03:25.464 - 00:03:36.196, Speaker A: It's probably because of the impending world war three drama between Iran and Israel. And so it seems like there's a lot of selling happening due to that.
00:03:36.340 - 00:03:42.812, Speaker B: I'm not a. Okay, full disclaimer. I'm not obviously a geopolitical expert.
00:03:42.908 - 00:03:43.852, Speaker A: I'm not either.
00:03:44.028 - 00:03:49.264, Speaker B: But why would they launch real wars and warn each other before?
00:03:49.604 - 00:04:02.926, Speaker A: To me I think this was more performative. Yeah. As a way to show strength to, you know, their citizens. And I think it's also to hold a certain amount of like respect. Right.
00:04:02.990 - 00:04:03.634, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:04.094 - 00:04:10.934, Speaker A: Outside of that, I feel that this is very performative and they have to continue with the theatrics until. Until it's done.
00:04:11.054 - 00:04:11.734, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:11.894 - 00:04:19.714, Speaker A: I'm hoping this is done very soon because I am flying out to Dubai tomorrow, which is 100 km away.
00:04:21.854 - 00:04:23.198, Speaker B: Right across the river.
00:04:23.366 - 00:04:30.294, Speaker A: Right across the river. And I'm hoping my thesis is true. So this is an investor hat on right now.
00:04:30.674 - 00:04:31.594, Speaker B: Let's see.
00:04:31.754 - 00:04:37.094, Speaker A: Let's see if it actually works or not. I'm dog fooding my own advice. Ciao.
00:04:37.394 - 00:04:56.788, Speaker B: But on a serious note, I tweeted about this, but no one has ever made money trading geopolitics because it's the worst kind of information asymmetry, right. You're at the mercy of one man or a small group of men who can single handedly decide the situation in an entire region.
00:04:56.956 - 00:04:59.260, Speaker A: Same goes for Powell. Like no one can trade Powell.
00:04:59.372 - 00:05:08.664, Speaker B: Exactly. No one can trade Powell. Well, Powell actually, Powell. Yeah, it's hard to trade Powell, but sometimes the market call bullshit on Powell.
00:05:09.564 - 00:05:11.204, Speaker A: I mean, you could just hear what he says.
00:05:11.324 - 00:05:37.328, Speaker B: But Powell is a quote unquote dictator for monetary policy. But his policies are still dictated by market conditions. So you can sort of, if you're really good at it, I mean, I'm sure there are some people who are really good at it. They can forecast what Powell is going to do. But geopolitics, like one politician wakes up on the wrong side of the bed, can decide to push the button and it's over. So it's the worst kind of adverse selection.
00:05:37.456 - 00:06:05.788, Speaker A: So the question is, everyone is talking about this is the latter half of the bull market. It seems like it's consensus now and people are probably taking profits from the last run up. Do you feel as if the market is just digesting the news, consolidating, and then also digesting the price action from the past six months? And do you feel as if that, will there be a continuation? Do you feel that it's over? Where's the heads at?
00:06:05.916 - 00:06:11.664, Speaker B: So I don't actually know what the consensus is. My Twitter feed is very bearish, but.
00:06:11.964 - 00:06:24.916, Speaker A: For some reason, like, I swear to God, like, last bull market, it was like insanely bullish. Yeah. And now it seems like everyone's just so bearish all the time. I see bullishness.
00:06:25.060 - 00:06:56.618, Speaker B: I feel like people are over allocated to alts, which is the average person, or leveraged, which is the average person on Twitter. But. So I don't know what that consensus is in the broader market, but I think was it web3 quan that launched a poll and I guess his followers, where the market is today? And in that poll, the consensus was that it's a consolidation, was a bullish consolidation. And I'm personally not far away from that consensus.
00:06:56.746 - 00:07:00.594, Speaker A: So the crowd is actually right for once, because usually you counter the crowd, right?
00:07:00.674 - 00:07:03.374, Speaker B: Well, maybe we're. Maybe we're both wrong.
00:07:06.414 - 00:07:11.874, Speaker A: Because if you want to counter the crowd, the least is ripped higher.
00:07:12.454 - 00:07:21.870, Speaker B: The most absurd comment was people comparing this flush over the last weekend to the COVID flush. COVID flush from nine k to three.
00:07:21.902 - 00:07:27.350, Speaker A: K. Nothing will ever, will ever compare to that.
00:07:27.462 - 00:07:28.334, Speaker B: That day.
00:07:28.494 - 00:07:32.594, Speaker A: Never. It was insanity. I thought it was over. Yeah.
00:07:33.014 - 00:07:44.830, Speaker B: I thought the whole thing pushed the adoption timeline by at least a couple of years. And it turns out the opposite happened because immediately after COVID, the Fed started printing money, remember?
00:07:44.942 - 00:07:45.278, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:45.326 - 00:07:47.566, Speaker B: And then we went straight back up.
00:07:47.710 - 00:07:56.794, Speaker A: Only for two years, which was incredibly. I mean, it was just like, defi summary was a magical experience. Yeah.
00:07:56.914 - 00:08:11.134, Speaker B: But overall, I feel comfy until the election. Because before the election, the powers that be need to pump the markets, meaning that Bowdoin's camp needs to pump the markets in order to get rid of the market.
00:08:11.674 - 00:08:39.792, Speaker A: Bowdoin needs to stop the war, or at least push the war off until he wins, which is why I think he made the right call by not supporting retaliatory plan of action by Israel. He said, yo, boating out, boating out, boating out. So it seems to me that there's a lot of fun and hopefully this fud gets puts to rest and this is a consolidation. It could be months, but after that, hopefully it's. We're back to where we started.
00:08:39.928 - 00:08:45.240, Speaker B: And you're putting your money where your mouth is. You're putting your life where your mouth is.
00:08:45.392 - 00:08:45.816, Speaker A: Yes.
00:08:45.880 - 00:08:48.552, Speaker B: By going to your token 24 nine. So, yes.
00:08:48.688 - 00:08:53.124, Speaker A: So if I don't make it back in our next pod, you know why I'm doing this for all of you.
00:08:53.824 - 00:08:58.360, Speaker B: But you're not going to be alone because the entire crypto industry is going to 2049.
00:08:58.512 - 00:09:03.324, Speaker A: Yeah. Worst case, a bunch of tokens get burned and everyone.
00:09:07.384 - 00:09:08.560, Speaker B: Always stay positive.
00:09:08.672 - 00:09:34.512, Speaker A: Always stay positive. But yeah, so I think the markets, I think it's. There's definitely overreaction, in my opinion. And hopefully we consolidate and we repair, but we'll see it's not financial advice. Over the past week, there's been a lot of. I feel like I have to put on my add hat on because there's a lot of things happening on all the layer ones and L2s that. That, you know, like it's, I'll be quite frank, chow.
00:09:34.512 - 00:09:37.000, Speaker A: It's very hard to keep up with all of this stuff that's happening.
00:09:37.112 - 00:09:37.920, Speaker B: It's impossible.
00:09:38.032 - 00:09:56.804, Speaker A: It's impossible. But I'm trying my best because obviously, like, if you're able to keep up, then obviously there's, you know, you win a prize. Right. The prize is you're early into something brand new. Two is you get to learn something also about user behavior. And then three is, hey, new products are formed and you get to try them out.
00:09:57.224 - 00:10:04.904, Speaker B: And we got called out by one of our listeners for making a false statement. Was it about runes?
00:10:05.064 - 00:10:29.508, Speaker A: Yeah. So, yeah, I do want to correct this. So it's not false in the sense it's rumors. Which is. The rumor is that Casey is the founder of R six, which as of right now is not true. He is only behind the runes protocol. And so runes and r six are right now different, or they're two different projects.
00:10:29.508 - 00:10:41.602, Speaker A: So what I said in the last podcast was that they're part of one, but it turns out it's just a rumor. Yeah, it's. It's just very. It's very hard to figure out what's right and wrong when you see this on Twitter.
00:10:41.658 - 00:10:49.738, Speaker B: Just goes to show how much is happening in this space and even for people who are in this space full time, it's impossible. To get everything right, by the way.
00:10:49.786 - 00:10:55.454, Speaker A: I try to fact check everything, and so I'll, like, ask Grok. Grok isn't 100%.
00:10:56.434 - 00:10:59.474, Speaker B: I think Grok isn't way less than 100%.
00:10:59.594 - 00:11:02.910, Speaker A: It's like. It's also less than 50%. Right.
00:11:02.982 - 00:11:04.714, Speaker B: Like, too much.
00:11:05.374 - 00:11:27.388, Speaker A: But I try to just fact check it because it's a good way to just, like, see what the trends are. And based on Twitter grok. It's Twitter grok said that Casey is actually the founder of r six. Yeah. Which is what I used on top of the information I read. So it kind of gives you a clue as to, like, how murky this space is. But I did.
00:11:27.388 - 00:11:53.284, Speaker A: We did add it to our show notes, and then we also added it to the tweet that we sent out. Yeah. But speaking about all the cool things that are happening, wizards and pups and rune and node monkeys, those are, like, the top. Obviously, there's quantum cats and others, but it seems to me that right now, node monkeys and pups or bitcoin puppets are vying for the number one spot, which.
00:11:53.364 - 00:11:56.544, Speaker B: There's war, the real war behind them.
00:11:58.044 - 00:11:59.348, Speaker A: Which one do you like?
00:11:59.476 - 00:12:03.028, Speaker B: Um, between pups and, uh, no monkeys.
00:12:03.116 - 00:12:06.380, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like. I mean, I know. Yeah, go ahead.
00:12:06.492 - 00:12:10.556, Speaker B: Okay, look, I think the artist shit, in both cases, I hate the art. I'll be very honest.
00:12:10.620 - 00:12:10.956, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:11.020 - 00:12:14.284, Speaker B: I hate the art in most meme coins and nfts.
00:12:14.364 - 00:12:14.932, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:15.068 - 00:12:31.040, Speaker B: Again, like I said this before, pudgy penguins is the only art that I like, so. So art, art wise, I don't give a shit. It's never about the art, ultimately. It's about the mind share, and it feels like pops is winning right now. Do you feel the same?
00:12:31.192 - 00:12:51.554, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, I'm obviously a little bit back biased, but not too much, because, you know, you own both now, so we have both. Yeah. So I will say that pups is okay. Node monkeys seem like boomers. Not too boomer ish, but, you know, a little. Right.
00:12:51.554 - 00:13:05.090, Speaker A: They're like. They're like more adults. Right. That's the way I classify, at least on Twitter. And then pop six puppets are just, like, crazy autist. Autistic. Like, I don't know.
00:13:05.242 - 00:13:07.010, Speaker B: Djen gen Zen. Yeah.
00:13:07.042 - 00:13:11.582, Speaker A: Yeah. There you go. Yeah. So there's, like, those are two different groups.
00:13:11.678 - 00:13:12.350, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:12.502 - 00:13:15.782, Speaker A: And it seems to me the puppets have more mind share.
00:13:15.918 - 00:13:17.910, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel the same way.
00:13:18.062 - 00:13:31.078, Speaker A: But I think if you compare that to, say, cryptopunks as an example, I mean, really, crypto punks has no vibe or culture, really. I mean, it does, but it's not as obvious what their culture is.
00:13:31.206 - 00:13:34.502, Speaker B: I mean, the cryptopunk culture is they're too good for everyone else.
00:13:34.598 - 00:13:59.670, Speaker A: Exactly. Exactly. So, like, it's not obvious to the average person, right. But they have their own elite circle, and this is, like, where it's at. So I think what node monkeys was trying to emulate was the crypto punks vibe and culture. But thankfully, we got bitcoin puppets, and bitcoin puppets are breaking that down, and they're saying, no, this is not who you are. You must engage with us.
00:13:59.670 - 00:14:28.902, Speaker A: And so now they're kind of drawn into this, like, community battle between the two. So much. So the reason why I think bitcoin puppets is edging out was the fact that they launched a token called pups and pups, and they airdropped it, and it's done so in a way that the token, the ticker, is pups. So pups can also emulate a dog coin. And so it has this.
00:14:29.078 - 00:14:30.630, Speaker B: It's the whiff of bitcoin.
00:14:30.782 - 00:14:34.842, Speaker A: Apparently, it's a whiff of bitcoin. I'm behind that. That thesis.
00:14:34.978 - 00:14:35.538, Speaker B: Okay.
00:14:35.626 - 00:14:45.058, Speaker A: But that doesn't mean that node monkeys is also a great project with the great collection. I think it has just a different caliber of community members as it's attracting.
00:14:45.146 - 00:14:46.254, Speaker B: What about wizards?
00:14:46.794 - 00:14:56.122, Speaker A: Wizards? I'm actually buying it as we speak, because it just. It just dropped to the point where I'm a buyer.
00:14:56.218 - 00:14:57.610, Speaker B: What are you using? Magic unit.
00:14:57.722 - 00:15:09.416, Speaker A: I'm using unisats. Uh, yeah, I'm using Unisats, and, um, I'm using unisats and x verse. Uh, but so what I did this time around was I tried using the magic edens.
00:15:09.520 - 00:15:12.248, Speaker B: Wait, hold on. Wizards is a. Is a BRC 20.
00:15:12.376 - 00:15:13.360, Speaker A: It's a BRC 20.
00:15:13.432 - 00:15:17.536, Speaker B: It's not on. Yeah, pops is on Solana.
00:15:17.680 - 00:15:21.764, Speaker A: Pops. Yeah. So we should talk about how Solana is the largest L2 for bitcoin.
00:15:23.144 - 00:15:28.030, Speaker B: Yeah, let's talk about that. What happened? Like, what's happening with pubs launching on Solana?
00:15:28.182 - 00:15:41.430, Speaker A: I mean, for me, it's. I mean, as a user, like, from a user perspective, it was so much easier to buy. Like, I don't have to go to Unisat and, like, try to buy the inscription or the. Yeah, the BRC twenties.
00:15:41.502 - 00:15:46.094, Speaker B: It's so confusing. The BRC 20 user experience. I still don't understand it.
00:15:46.214 - 00:16:02.952, Speaker A: It's so painful. Chow. I just don't even know where to start. It is so painful. But the experience is like, buying an NFT. So it's semi fungible. I would probably even categorize as an NFT is a way to think about it.
00:16:02.952 - 00:16:19.528, Speaker A: Buying BRC twenties is like buying an NFT, and each NFT has a block of tokens that gets allocated and dependent on how much you sell. That's how much you will transfer to the BRC 20 to the buyer of the BRC 20.
00:16:19.656 - 00:16:35.392, Speaker B: Okay, so. So wizards is a BRC 20. That's the. That's the quote unquote token for taproot wizards. And then there's pups, which is the token for bitcoin puppets. And that is on Solana. Explain that.
00:16:35.392 - 00:16:36.760, Speaker B: Why is it on Solana?
00:16:36.912 - 00:17:25.182, Speaker A: So it's on Solana primarily because there's ample liquidity there, and it's a. An easier way to get access to community in retail, which isn't available on bitcoin and BRC twenties. Today. I think there's a case to be made that Solana is the retail chain and that's where all the liquidity is. And so they built out a way to buy Solana tokens, or, sorry, buy BRC 20 tokens, Bridget to Solana, and then redeem it for Solana tokens. And there's a premium on Solana because it's so easy to get liquidity there. And so there is a fundamental price difference between the price of BRC twenties and the price on SPL tokens on Solana with pups.
00:17:25.182 - 00:17:29.366, Speaker A: And typically the price difference that I've seen is ten to 15%.
00:17:29.510 - 00:17:29.894, Speaker B: Okay.
00:17:29.934 - 00:17:40.286, Speaker A: It's so painful to bridge and to actually go through redemption process that people aren't doing it, and to arb the price difference. So there isn't really an equilibrium on price yet. It's not worth it.
00:17:40.310 - 00:17:47.058, Speaker B: Like, it's just changes 15%/minute what's the point of capturing that 15% premium?
00:17:47.186 - 00:18:06.938, Speaker A: Exactly. So you're better off just buying at a premium, because it's just so much easier than having to go through what I just went through. Because I'll tell you this, I will tell you this. I am, like, going through the process of, like, bridging. In hindsight, I should just use an exchange. But I wanted to feel the pain. Feel the pain and try it out.
00:18:06.938 - 00:18:44.560, Speaker A: And so what I did was I used. Everyone has been talking about magic Eden's swap functionality in its wallet. So what I did was I bought Solana and I sent it to magic Eden's wallet. And then from Magic Eden's wallet, I use its cross chain swaps product and I swapped it into bitcoin and when you're doing size as an example, it takes two to 4 hours for the transaction to settle. All right, I did a swap, let's say yesterday, let's say 24 hours ago, I did a swap. I have yet to receive a part of that swap yet. Okay, so I did it in like five tranches.
00:18:44.560 - 00:19:00.608, Speaker A: Three tranches I was able to access right away. Two tranches. One tranche is available but not received on my wallet, so I can't use it. And the fifth tranche is not even there. So I have to write a support ticket to Magic Eden as an example to figure out what's going on with that.
00:19:00.656 - 00:19:07.498, Speaker B: Wait, you're talking about converting from the Solana to BRC 20? What happens after rune protocol launches?
00:19:07.616 - 00:19:08.634, Speaker A: I have no idea.
00:19:09.814 - 00:19:12.270, Speaker B: Because pops is pre rune pubs is pre runes.
00:19:12.302 - 00:19:27.478, Speaker A: Yeah. So what happens is once runes is available, then you burn your Solana token and then you redeem for whatever the ratio of tokens you would receive for each Solana token. And that's kind of the way it works.
00:19:27.606 - 00:19:30.638, Speaker B: Do you know when rune launches happening.
00:19:30.766 - 00:19:31.790, Speaker A: On the day of.
00:19:31.982 - 00:19:34.586, Speaker B: Let's talk about happening or having.
00:19:34.730 - 00:19:35.414, Speaker A: Having.
00:19:36.474 - 00:19:57.242, Speaker B: Because it's a once in a four year event, and this upcoming having is special because it's going to happen on 420. But more importantly, there's going to be many major protocol launches, including runes and a few L2s.
00:19:57.378 - 00:21:01.070, Speaker A: Yeah. So it seems like not only having is a big experience for the emissions of the bitcoin network, but in fact there's a lot of launches coordinated for that day, one of which is runes, which we've talked a bit about in our last podcast, which is, you could think of this as a ERC standard that will enable new fungible tokens to be traded. And it's supposed to have an ERC 20 like experience, but it turns out because we are building and learning from the edges of crypto, that not true today. And in fact, UDi recently tweeted out that runes trading experience is actually going to be similar to BRC 20. And I was surprised by that because the whole notion of runes was to bring fungibility to bitcoin. But he also put a plot twist which said that op cats will fix this, and apparently op cat has to do something with bundling data. And so I'm not sure exactly what that would mean for Rune's trading experience, but if I had to guess, I think it's a way to batch transactions.
00:21:01.070 - 00:21:18.886, Speaker A: Okay. It's just a wild guess. I'm not sure. Okay. Because if you were able to batch transactions then you could have a pretty similar experience to like ERC twenty s, I think. And then apparently there's some bit vm fud too. What's the fud? The Fud is bit Vm, and this is from Udi.
00:21:18.886 - 00:21:48.862, Speaker A: Again, BitVM cannot support bridging ordinals by definition, because BitVM bridges require fungibility to work. The L2s based on BitVM will never have non fungible ordinal support. Wow, I did not know that. BitVM also won't support runes. While it's hypothetically possible, it's not feasible as a liquidity squeeze issue gets exponentially worse with low cap assets like runes. So BitVM L2 s won't support ordinals and won't support runes. But then he says opcat fixes this.
00:21:48.998 - 00:22:14.204, Speaker B: Okay, well what does he even mean by BitVM? There too is because BitVM, okay, now we're getting to the conversation about L2 s because BitVM is a big piece of that and BitVM is not even production ready yet. We are probably about a year away from BitVM being production ready. Actually, why don't we give a primer to our audience about bitcoin L2 s?
00:22:14.334 - 00:22:20.232, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's, what can you argue? There's three different design concepts maybe.
00:22:20.288 - 00:22:54.288, Speaker B: Okay, so conceptually, okay, so there's many pieces, right? There's data visibility, there's bridging, there's settlement, there's consensus, right? Like all these are different components of a blockchain. But the biggest unknown right now is whether or not we're gonna do a, we're gonna start with the optimistic roll up or ZK roll up. So that's the biggest design space in bitcoin L2 s. And the consensus right now among the bitcoin community is that ZK roll up is very very very difficult.
00:22:54.416 - 00:22:55.084, Speaker A: But.
00:22:56.784 - 00:23:37.122, Speaker B: Because the inherent limitations with the bitcoin layer one, it's not possible to verify the proofs. It probably requires a soft fork to the bitcoin layer one protocol in order to do ZK rollups. Now, optimistic rollups are more realistic, but they're not exactly like the optimistic roll ups on Ethereum. Again, due to the limitations of the bitcoin layer one. So it's a slight variation of it and it's probably, I would say strictly worse variation of it. But basically that is bit vm. So BitVM is a protocol that enables optimistic roll ups and that is work in progress.
00:23:37.122 - 00:24:13.598, Speaker B: And that is probably still a year from going to production. So we're going to invite Alexi from Bob, as well as the Babylon team to talk about BitVM and the technical designs, all that stuff. But this is the high level. Now, the question is, if BiTVM is still a year away, what do we use today? Because there's going to be a few L2s that will launch around the having. Right, which is in like three days from the release of this podcast. The answer is, they're going to be multi sigs.
00:24:13.726 - 00:24:19.302, Speaker A: So. Well, multisigs, are they all going to be multi sigs? They can't be until.
00:24:19.478 - 00:24:20.630, Speaker B: Until bitdm.
00:24:20.742 - 00:24:26.930, Speaker A: Huh. Interesting. And how does that change? How did that change performance over time?
00:24:27.042 - 00:24:50.082, Speaker B: Well, the question, the more interesting question is how does that change the security over time? Like, how does security change over time? Because if BiTVM works, and we think it'll work, at least experts think it'll work. It's more of an engineering problem than a research problem at this point, then a quote unquote optimistic roll up is strictly better than multisig security wise.
00:24:50.218 - 00:24:51.798, Speaker A: So, okay, so it's a.
00:24:51.946 - 00:25:13.126, Speaker B: Because you're then really relying on the security assumptions that bitcoin layer one instead of five people. Anyway, that's the high level. That's the high level of the bitcoin L2 ecosystem. There's probably 2030 projects and a few of which will launch around having. Which is very soon, in a few days. Let's bring on the guests.
00:25:13.270 - 00:25:37.612, Speaker A: All right, let's do it. Today we have Alexi from Baban was building a L2 on bitcoin. Lots of talk around bitcoin and L2s, ordinals, runes and all the other good stuff that's coming out of the bitcoin ecosystem. So I'm really excited about this podcast and Alexi coming on to discuss what L2 is going to look like. What's top of mind for you, chow?
00:25:37.708 - 00:26:01.974, Speaker B: I think a lot of our listeners are in the Ethereum and Solana community. They're very new to this stuff. Yeah. So I would love to just get a broad stroke from Alexei for where the bitcoin renaissance is today and the landscape of the various bitcoin L2 s, bitcoin restaking runes, BRC, twenties, ordinals, everything bitcoin related.
00:26:02.134 - 00:26:21.742, Speaker A: Likewise. Funny enough, I was just. Right before this podcast, I was just buying some wizards. So, yeah, I'm excited. I also want to hear about, you know, maybe the runes protocol. Right, that's going to launch. And how will that affect L2s? Because if you think of what runes is.
00:26:21.742 - 00:26:38.090, Speaker A: It's a protocol to similar to like ERC, right, where you can launch fungible tokens. It's the counterpart to ordinals. So I'm curious on like how that dynamic will fit in with the L2 landscape as well. So Lexi, maybe let's just discuss like what you're working on. Cool. Yeah.
00:26:38.122 - 00:27:03.618, Speaker C: So thanks so much for having me on. So for those of you who don't know me, I'm Alexei. I'm one of the co founders of Bob, short for building bitcoin, and we've been doing this for quite a while. So for me this is year nine. Working on bitcoin. We've always worked on the intersections of bitcoin and other ecosystems, trying to figure out how can we do more with bitcoin than just holding and payments. My background is in research, computer science.
00:27:03.618 - 00:27:48.758, Speaker C: We've been building bitcoin bridges and sidechain models for quite some time. And with Bob we are taking a slightly different approach than I think we've seen before. We're building a L2, but it's not just a bitcoin L2. And we can talk about the different flavors there in a minute. It's a hybrid, and a hybrid means it sits between bitcoin and ethereum, and it might later in the future be expanded to others. But primarily right now the focus is between bitcoin and ethereum, combining these two ecosystems, aiming to inherit security from both, but also import liquidity from both of these large ecosystems. Essentially market leaders today with quite significant margin and the vision that we have specifically for the go to market as well.
00:27:48.758 - 00:29:10.992, Speaker C: And that's also what we're focused on in terms of building infrastructure and products, is one, making bitcoin defi super accessible. So instead of having to reinvent the wheel, use existing DeFi primitives that we see on Ethereum, but allow users to plug in their bitcoin within one transaction, make the on ramp super easy, abstract the whole bridging aspect of it, and on the other hand, enable Ethereum users, web3 users that are really exploring and experimenting with DeFi, NFTs and other protocols to get exposure to runes, ordinals, BRC twenties and other assets that you see on bitcoin, and to allow them to do this in a very accessible manner using similar wallets, similar infrastructure that they're already familiar with. So instead of you having to go buy bitcoin from a centralized exchange or source it from somewhere from your cold storage, and then install a new wallet and figure out how to run a bitcoin node just to buy a roon. Just go do it on Bob. Use your metamask wallet, pay with USDC and you're done, right? So you can really embrace, at least get the first experience with runes, ordinals, BC Twenty s, and then you can still go down the rabbit hole. And that's essentially what hybrid means to us, uniting ideally the best of both worlds. Helping bitcoin get more users, helping Ethereum users to rediscover bitcoin.
00:29:10.992 - 00:29:35.028, Speaker C: Because ultimately I think 90% of people who are working and building NWeb three, most of them, I mean, I'd say 90% probably got into crypto through bitcoin. And our bitcoin is at heart. It's just that the ethos of bitcoin was quite different to what we see in the web3 space or like outside of BTC, and that has now changed. So we hope to embrace everybody and allow them to come back to bitcoin.
00:29:35.116 - 00:29:48.040, Speaker B: So, yeah, so users could use metamask and interact on Bob with ETH, with BTC, with ERC 20, with runes, maybe ordinals as well, is that right?
00:29:48.112 - 00:30:15.764, Speaker C: That will be possible. I'm leaking some alpha here, and our marketing team is going to be very unhappy with me leaking this. But yes, we've built something that makes this very easy. And you'll see first protocols integrating this within the next couple of weeks, and then we expect to see more and more of this happening. I think unifying the wallet experience is going to be a game changer. And of course you'll have ordinals, wallets like experts, which is a very great wallet. I can definitely recommend everyone to experiment with that.
00:30:15.764 - 00:30:51.738, Speaker C: But I know for myself, I know this barrier, this hurdle of I need to install another wallet, I need to figure out, I need to secure my another key. And I would only do this once. I'm 100% certain I want to go down the rabbit hole if I'm just experimenting. I would just want to get, let's say a wizard, or I want to get a rune just to experiment, figure out what that is. I think by lowering the entry barrier, we can get much more people to start actually playing around with bitcoin assets. And that's what this is for ultimately, I think we'll see things emerge that are hybrids, just like Bob. Embracing systems.
00:30:51.866 - 00:31:08.304, Speaker B: The term L2 is a very broad term, sometimes misleading, sometimes misused. So when we talk about bitcoin L2s, both for Bob and also in general, what does that mean? What does a L2 mean?
00:31:08.394 - 00:31:36.202, Speaker C: I've been asked this question, actually today on a panel as well. And I think there is two ways of seeing this. There is the strict academic way, and I'm happy to wear that hat for a few seconds and say, okay, look, academically speaking, the definition of a L2 is pretty clear. It inherits bitcoin security, or ETH security. It settles on Ethereum, and that's what it does. And if you look at the bitcoin landscape today, nothing is a L2 by this definition, except lightning. But by this definition, an optimism is, is not a L2.
00:31:36.202 - 00:32:27.328, Speaker C: And most of the ETH l two s are not L2 s, because ultimately you need to have this. Like, if you go on l two beat and you see something that has green circles all around, that's a L2 by the strict computer science academic definition that we've seen before. Now, of course, and then everything else will be side chains. Now, realistically speaking, in a practice, I think people have started to use the word L2, thinking not necessarily about the underlying settlement mechanism, but imagining it visually. We have bitcoin, and then we have another layer on top that kind of abstracts away the BTC kind of complexity or the ETH side of things and makes it cheaper, makes it faster, adds specialized functionality. And by that definition, yes. Then something that builds on top of bitcoin, plugs into it, maybe inherits security, allows users to use bitcoin functionality, can be considered a layer too.
00:32:27.328 - 00:32:41.648, Speaker C: And that's also, I think, a lesson learned. If you think of people coming into the space right now that are new to l one s, l two s for them, they don't think about the settlement. They think about the layers of how they imagine it when you cut through the stack.
00:32:41.736 - 00:32:51.024, Speaker B: Two follow up questions. One is when will Bob launch? And two, in the first version, what will be the security assumptions?
00:32:51.184 - 00:33:53.304, Speaker C: So Bob is launching. Depending on when this podcast airs very soon, it might already be launched by that time, but it's launching shortly after the bitcoin halving. In terms of the security model, I think the explanation before about lightning being the only real l two on bitcoin. Based on this, we made the decision, if we're launching bitcoin L2 today, ultimately, with the tooling that we have right now, ignoring, not looking at what we might have in the future with BitVM and so on, what we have today is a way to build side chains which will ultimately have some form of multisig component in them, because there is no way to easily inherit. Well, there are some ways, but they're not as practical and we'll come to them in a second. So the majority of bitcoin L2s are multisig today, or they introduce their own proof of stake consensus. But from our perspective, if you're thinking in the long term, we want to actually inherit bitcoin security, so we don't want to reinvent our own consensus mechanism, but we also don't want to run a temporary multisig from day one, which is quite risky.
00:33:53.304 - 00:34:38.508, Speaker C: We want to onboard Ethereum users. So naturally, for us aiming to design a hybrid, we launch as an ETH optimistic roll up, because that allows us to inherit ETH security from day one, which is arguably better than me running a multisig with a few of my friends. But then at the same time, what it gives us, it gives us access to Ethereum assets. So we have native stable coins from day one, USDC, USDT, Dai, Frax, Ethina, USDe, whatever you like. But at the same time, and perhaps even more relevant, it solves a chicken and egg problem that many layer ones and L2s are facing. It gives us access to exchanges and on and off ramps. So of course, as mentioned in our recent releases, Coinbase Ventures invested.
00:34:38.508 - 00:34:48.276, Speaker C: And I'm sure if we become big enough and we're friendly with most exchanges and as we grow and become big enough, they will have interest to integrate us for native withdrawals from stablecoins and other assets.
00:34:48.420 - 00:35:03.724, Speaker B: Let's take a step back. Out of everything that's happening in the bitcoin ecosystem, aside from Bob, what are you most excited about? Whether it's a single project or a set of things or a narrative that you're excited about?
00:35:03.844 - 00:35:41.350, Speaker C: I mean, I think there is, of course there's different protocols and tools and use case ideas, but the one thing I'm most excited about is the cultural change. I've spent a lot of time working on bitcoin. I used to be one of the people that would get uninvited from some bitcoin only maxi conferences, not the technical ones usually, but the ones that are more like retail community driven, where they would say, oh no, you're building a bitcoin bridge. We weren't even like, you know, I'd go and say, hey, you know, there's like $10 billion of WBDC. Well, you know, let's discuss what the risks are and how else we can build bridges. No, no, no, this is not bitcoin only. And then you, and then suddenly we're getting like now people are actually saying, hey, BitVM is cool.
00:35:41.350 - 00:36:19.644, Speaker C: Can we talk about this? And then with ordinals, there are still debates, but it doesn't matter. Like because you now have this big enough community that is outsizing the kind of very, I would maybe say this toxic sub sub group of bitcoiners, because they're very small group of people that are just very loud. The majority of bitcoin is actually not toxic at all. So that culture shift, this change of, hey, it's okay to experiment on bitcoin. Let's talk about experimenting with script, let's try to do things with bitcoin today. Let's play around with different forks, let's see what we can do and then decide what's the best path forward. That excites me most because you can see the innovation heartbeating accelerates.
00:36:19.644 - 00:36:42.604, Speaker C: If you look at BiTVM, the amount of time from idea to v two to kind of new designs. And things are coming out on bitcoin now almost like weekly. Compare that to two years ago. There was nothing, it was academic research, but almost everybody had left to do other things because, well, bitcoin doesn't change. We can't do that much. And now it's back. So that probably excites me the most.
00:36:42.604 - 00:37:17.388, Speaker C: And in terms of use cases, what I'm really excited about, and I think ordinals, runes, BRC, twenties, all these new asset classes are great because we'll see an accelerated cycle of things that we saw on Ethereum. So think of it as bitcoin's cryptokitty moment with ordinals. And now everything coming through, it's going to be very fast. It's going to be a speculative, partially it's not. Everything is going to be good, but we have to go through that cycle at least once to get to the point where, okay, people have played around with it. Ultimately a retail user or an institution or a bigger business won't move into something that hasn't been battle tested before. And that's what we'll see with these L2s.
00:37:17.388 - 00:38:01.834, Speaker C: And what I personally am most looking forward to is actually people being able to use these l two s for payments or getting credit lines against a bitcoin. Boring. Borrowing stable coins. Because one thing that we've learned from the market is they don't want to pay in bitcoin, they want to get access to stablecoins. That's why Tron is dominating and lightning is not. And with bitcoin, L2 is we finally have a way to challenge this dominance of Tron, which ultimately arguably is much less secure and ultimately not necessarily the ideal future for stablecoin transfers than a global ledger to banking them banked, although without doubt they have done more than the majority of other ecosystems to date. And that's what I'm most excited about.
00:38:01.834 - 00:38:22.320, Speaker C: Think of it this way. If you're new to bitcoin and new to crypto, where else would you go? I don't have to tell you that bitcoin is bitcoin, right? Everybody knows what bitcoin is. I don't have to tell you that bitcoin is secure. People know that bitcoin is secure. People might still think bitcoin is preferred worker is not great. But by now with the ETF, you have this again, narrative change. Now people think it's mainstream, it's okay.
00:38:22.320 - 00:39:06.674, Speaker C: The big institutions that hated on bitcoin so much are suddenly buying it. Okay, so bitcoin it is. And one thing I'll say to wrap this rather long answer up, 90% or maybe more of the altcoins out there, their whole value kind of proposition was, hey, we can do something that you cannot do on bitcoin. And now suddenly means sidechains are getting there. With Bitvm it will be like black on white. We can do all these things on bitcoin. So why would I go somewhere else if I can do all of these things on BTC? And I think we're going to see a pretty interesting moment when that happens because then I think you'll see a mass exodus of developers, builders and just you already see, that's why you see so many bitcoin L2.
00:39:06.674 - 00:39:13.458, Speaker C: Some projects that have failed to gain traction as a standalone chain are now trying to come to bitcoin because they can see that once bitcoin.
00:39:13.506 - 00:39:14.746, Speaker B: Wait, what are the templates?
00:39:14.930 - 00:39:30.908, Speaker C: I think one is like elastos. I think I've seen and a few other chains that have kind of rebranded into bitcoin L2s. And you'll see more and it's not necessarily a bad thing. Instead of them all becoming an ethel two, now they'll try to become a bitcoin layer too.
00:39:31.076 - 00:40:08.736, Speaker B: It really feels to me that the developer mind share around bitcoin has been growing since ordinals. Basically a year ago, I feel like ordinals kickstarted everything and then it became a self fulfilling prophecy. It became a virtuous circle, it trapped him more mind cheer and then which attracted more developers. And then people started thinking about BitVM and then holy shit, L2 are possible. And then that in turn attracts even more mind share from users and from developers. So I feel like bitcoin really is in a virtuous circle right now for runes.
00:40:08.800 - 00:40:26.926, Speaker A: Since it runes, the way it works, from what I gather is it's the process of etching, which is similar to like inscriptions or inscribing. Since it's natively on bitcoin, how easy is it to support runes on a L2? Does it have to be wrapped? And I'm putting my ETH hat on here, does it have to be wrapped or how does it work?
00:40:27.030 - 00:40:56.814, Speaker C: So maybe not only for runes, but so for runes there's kind of two ways, yeah, yeah. Well, I think there's like three ways anyway for BRC's inscriptions, or knows runes to interface with the L2 and another chain there's wrapping, which introduces trust assumptions. Right. So someone has custody and BitVM is still on the horizon for bitcoin. How this will work for runes, we'll see. How do MPC based bridges work for runes? We'll see. So right now for runes we have multi sigs which can be made robust, but it's a multisig.
00:40:56.814 - 00:41:25.574, Speaker C: And then the other option is cross chain swaps. So as discussed before, you use a bitcoin like client built as a smart contract that can verify every single bitcoin transaction cryptographically. So the same thing you have on your phone, but as a smart contract. And then that thing will be able to check if you made the bitcoin transaction. So then Imran, you would say, hey, Alexei, I want to buy this rune. I'm going to give you $10 for it. And if I'm happy, I'll send you the rune to the bitcoin address you gave to me.
00:41:25.574 - 00:42:04.256, Speaker C: And then I'll prove to the ETH contract in which you deposited your ten USDC, for example, that I actually made a bitcoin payment and then I automatically can claim the ten USDC and the smart contract can verify that, hey, the payment on bitcoin has actually been made. And that's another way of doing this because now we have trustless swaps. Yes, the settlement. And again, instead of us just posting an order, you can build more complex order books, emms, very sophisticated mechanisms to come to an agreement. And then the settlement is slow. The settlement, think of it, I guess as in physical settlement. In the financial world, cash settlement is if you want to rapid, it's very fast, you get an IOU and it's a cash settled thing.
00:42:04.256 - 00:42:38.330, Speaker C: And then you yourself have to go and physically settle it by withdrawing from the bridge. And then you can directly settle physically and physically, I mean, on bitcoin. And then the last one, the one that I'm actually quite excited about, because I think it's quite unique, is hybrids. Things that exist both as an inscription of bitcoin and as an NFT on Ethereum, or an asset on Ethereum. You already saw first NFT collections burning from ETH going to bitcoin. You'll see first bitcoin collections burning from bitcoin going to bitcoin. Layer two, you'll see things that are hybrids.
00:42:38.330 - 00:43:24.174, Speaker C: So think instead of on Ethan, NFT is a hash, and the data is stored on ipfs, ordinals, inscriptions, store everything on bitcoin, which is very expensive and not really accessible to millions of users. Well, a hybrid would be hash on bitcoin data on a L2 that secured by bitcoin in some form, or things that evolve with time. Because again, if you have a L2 like bob that can read the bitcoin state, you can do more things. You can have evolving nfts, you can have things that react to something happening on bitcoin and then changing the state of the EVM asset, or NFT. So that is a very new and open design space that we're looking into, and we'll start releasing some cool new things over the next couple of weeks. But that's option three, which I think is not just wrapping, not peer to peer settlement. These things are pretty clear how to do this.
00:43:24.174 - 00:43:41.684, Speaker C: Third option is, again, embracing this hybrid nature of, hey, literatures are a thing. They will coexist with bitcoin. They will be things that not only logic on l two, sentiment and bitcoin, but that actually are intertwined. Can I ask you guys a question actually, to wrap up? Of course, because I love to pick your brains as well.
00:43:42.024 - 00:43:42.720, Speaker A: Sure.
00:43:42.872 - 00:44:17.752, Speaker C: I mean, you've spent a lot of time looking at startups and teams, building on different ecosystems. You've experienced with Ethereum, with Solano startups, you've seeded some early bitcoin startups. What do you think from your perspective? And that's, I think, what startups and builders love to hear, and I think the insight could be helpful. And I'm super curious as well. What do you think is the one piece of advice you would give to somebody that's going to build on bitcoin today? So if you're just, I want to build on bitcoin. If you had to give one piece of advice, what would that be?
00:44:17.848 - 00:44:21.488, Speaker B: I don't have any advice specific to bitcoin. Imran, do you have any?
00:44:21.656 - 00:45:11.582, Speaker A: I think the advice is more generalizable, but maybe, and I don't know how important this is in the long run, but maybe short term to medium term, there is a thesis or narrative that is about building as close to bitcoin as possible natively versus additional layers on top. I don't know how true that is. I don't know if I believe it myself, but I've seen that narrative being thrown around, which is why people gravitate towards ordinals. Like, the beauty about ordinals is that the fact that you're inscribing a sat, right. That's like the real, like, outside of, you know. And there's different classifications of sats, right. There's sats from the bitcoin pizza days all the way down to, you know, newly minted sats.
00:45:11.582 - 00:45:35.566, Speaker A: And all this is like, has some sort of time value over time, right. And so there is a meme around building on sats. I'm not sure how prevalent this is going to be for the average person, but maybe short to medium term, there's some sort of, like, bootstrapping mechanism to get people excited about, like ordinals as an example. But I don't know how true this is or generalizable this is for founders that are building bitcoin.
00:45:35.670 - 00:45:39.114, Speaker C: So I guess bet on the trend. Like, don't swim against the trend, I guess.
00:45:39.454 - 00:45:50.184, Speaker A: Yeah, I say, like, if you. If there's a really good beachhead for. For bitcoin as an example, that has a very strong narrative, you know, you could use that to your advantage. How about you, Alexi?
00:45:50.804 - 00:46:22.248, Speaker C: Build products, build what users want. Don't get focused and too obsessed with tech. And what you think is great. I think what you just said kind of translates to more than just narrative. It's ultimately, what do people want? Narrative is what people want. And we got punched in the face really, really, really hard once, like, focusing only on tech and that kind of bulk us up. And I think many teams out there still often focus only on, hey, I'm going to build this super fancy thing that might be practical if bitcoin does a fork.
00:46:22.248 - 00:46:53.400, Speaker C: And I think people are going to love it because it's only because it's on bitcoin. And I think unless it's really hitting the narrative, as you said, and people really want to go there. So if you're building something with runes, okay, that's probably a safe, pretty good bet over the next couple of months. But if you're building something completely new that goes against runes. And you think, oh, this is going to be super cool because it's super fancy tech. BRC one so far, not because it's fancy tech, but because it's easy to use and people want it to something that's easy to use. And I think that applies to more than just assets.
00:46:53.400 - 00:47:10.154, Speaker C: It applies to L2, it applies to wallets, it applies to bridges. And, I mean, that's a doctrine we've embraced in Bob, and it has what I can say, it's like, Bob is not our first venture. And I can say that it's zero to one if you actually listen to what people tell you and do what they ask you.
00:47:10.274 - 00:47:35.690, Speaker A: Yeah, like, look, I think one thing I could say about you, Alexi, I mean, this. I mean, we haven't. I mean, this wasn't our first interaction. We've talked many times over the past seven years or six years, I think this around 2017. And you were always building the bitcoin space. Like bitcoin Polkadot, like that kind of realm. And what I learned from you is that you have resilience, right? And you have focus.
00:47:35.690 - 00:48:10.974, Speaker A: And. And eventually, if you believe in something, and as long as you're listening to customers in a narrative long enough time horizon, there is a chance to be lucky. Quote unquote, people may see you from the outside and say that you were lucky, but in fact, you were building the space for a very, very long time. And so for founders that are listening, if you have a valid narrative that you're following, or an area that you're following that will eventually, that you feel that will grow, stay focused. No matter what the haters say or whatnot, you stay focused. And eventually luck will play to your side.
00:48:11.134 - 00:48:40.828, Speaker B: This is the lesson I learned from bitcoin builders. This is not advice for bitcoin builders. The lesson I learned from them, which is that the bitcoin builders got lucky because they survived long enough. For the first x years, up until recent months, bitcoin had zero mind share. Nothing happened. For example, you suffered many years, experts suffered many years until recent months. And all of a sudden, everyone is working.
00:48:40.828 - 00:48:53.844, Speaker B: Everyone is like, all the products are working, have a lot of traction. They managed to raise a lot of money. Everything is booming. So the lesson really is that I learned from bitcoin builders is to survive long enough to get lucky.
00:48:53.924 - 00:49:03.438, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah. Yeah. So, again, for founders that are looking to build in the space, and if you're looking at bitcoin, definitely reach out.
00:49:03.446 - 00:49:20.230, Speaker C: To Alexia Bob and apply to alliance. Now we never got picked, but we got a chance to work with alliance another way. And yeah, I can from, from teams that we've heard like talk to. I think that's definitely a good way to kind of go from zero to really product market fit.
00:49:20.342 - 00:50:08.574, Speaker A: Awesome. Today we have David from Babylon on to speak about the bitcoin ecosystem. The bitcoin ecosystem has been an interesting journey for us, obviously, given that we've been in this space for over ten years and for the most part we've thought of bitcoin as just a competitor to gold, but in fact it could do a lot more now in the cycle. So given the launch of ordinals by Casey, a lot of new primitives have been built. So we're starting to see the rise of node monkeys and bitcoin puppets. More recently the launch of Roon and the roon token with the arcic miners. And then this new gravitational pull for startup founders that want to build for the bitcoin ecosystem.
00:50:08.574 - 00:50:20.470, Speaker A: Given that it has hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth accumulated, there is a chance for startup founders to attract that wealth. I'm curious to learn more about where this can go. What are you excited about, Joe?
00:50:20.542 - 00:50:26.354, Speaker B: Just in general, David, what makes you excited to work in the bitcoin ecosystem?
00:50:27.214 - 00:51:07.100, Speaker D: We started working in the bitcoin ecosystem about two years ago with Babylon. Before that I've been doing research. I'm a professor at Stanford, so we have a research lab on consensus protocol. How I got started in this research direction five years ago was through reading Nakamoto's white paper in bitcoin. So bitcoin has always been my first love in the crypto space. I've always wanted to leverage off this amazing blockchain, which is the most secure blockchain in the world, og blockchain in the world. And make it more useful for the rest of the blockchain ecosystem.
00:51:07.100 - 00:51:09.296, Speaker D: So that's always our vision.
00:51:09.420 - 00:51:31.528, Speaker B: But for the first, I guess, 1314 years there has not been much going on in the bitcoin ecosystem. Basically since 2014, bitcoin lost its developer mine share to ethereum. But maybe around a year ago it's coming back. What gets you excited? Why are you working bitcoin versus, let's say, ethereum?
00:51:31.656 - 00:52:14.436, Speaker D: Well, everyone is working ethereum, so it's good to have some people working on something else. Okay, so to me, the core thesis of crypto of web3 is security. Security is the foundation of everything. Without security, you cannot build wealth, you cannot build economy on top of that. So that's the fundamentals. And which blockchain is the most secure in the history of blockchain? It is bitcoin. And so to us, the fact that you cannot have limited, you can have limited programmability on blockchain is actually a plus, because one of the reasons why it's so secure is because there's limited way of you can program it.
00:52:14.436 - 00:52:43.944, Speaker D: And so our vision has always been try to leverage all this security, which I think is unique among all blockchains. You know, other blockchains, once in a while they halt. Once in a while they have some attacks. But bitcoin has never been attacked, has never been attacked before, as far as I know. Always running one blog every ten minutes, chucking along for 1415 years. And this is a huge resource that we should leverage off.
00:52:44.064 - 00:52:50.344, Speaker B: Want to talk about Babylon? How does bitcoin restaking work? What are the applications, et cetera?
00:52:50.464 - 00:52:51.096, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:51.240 - 00:53:21.678, Speaker D: So if you think about bitcoin compared to other crypto assets, right, other crypto asset, almost all other crypto asset that is born in the past five years have been proof of stake assets. Proof of stake asset. So a proof of stake asset has one. Every proof of stake asset has at least one use case, and that's staking, because a proof of stake chain needs security. Bitcoin, compared to all these other assets, has no such use case. No such use case. Why? Because bitcoin is a proof of work chain.
00:53:21.678 - 00:54:25.196, Speaker D: So it doesn't have this native use case of staking. So our technology, bitcoin staking, this concept that we came up with is to endow bitcoin with this use case of staking, not to secure its own chain, because on chain is already well secured by the miners, but they use it as a staking asset to secure any other chain in the crypto ecosystem. So that is basically the innovation here, to allow bitcoin to be used as a staking asset for other blockchains. Now, of course, you can think of naive ways of solving this problem. For example, you can bridge bitcoin to another chain, Ethereum, Solana, etcetera, and then use it as a sticking asset on that other chain. In terms of the bridging the wrap asset, however, that is not what we meant. What we want to design is a protocol that doesn't require any bridging, doesn't require any custodial trustlessly to do the staking.
00:54:25.196 - 00:55:03.710, Speaker D: So in other words, the security, from the point of view of the bitcoin holder, the staker, is the same level of security as for example, ETH staker staking on the Ethereum chain, you don't have to give those big Ethereum. When you stake on Ethereum chain, you don't have to give those Ethereum to any centralized custodial to do the staking. It is a trustless way of staking through the smart contract Ethereum. We want to give bitcoin users, bitcoin holders, exactly the same level of security. Yet we can do this without the use of smart contract on bitcoin. So that is the technological breakthrough that we came up with.
00:55:03.782 - 00:55:26.636, Speaker B: Okay, so there's two approaches to bridging. One is the Bitvm op style, and the other one is the ZK style. Right. Zk style people are still working on it, working on reducing the size of the proofs. Now, for the op one, let's take bitvm. Are you able to explain Bitvm like I was five? Explain bitvm to her grandmother, or I.
00:55:26.660 - 00:55:31.064, Speaker D: Assume you're a very smart five euro. I have to make that assumption.
00:55:34.164 - 00:55:34.772, Speaker B: Of course.
00:55:34.828 - 00:55:35.284, Speaker C: Sure.
00:55:35.404 - 00:55:39.688, Speaker B: My understanding is the bitvm is like a proven game. It's like a game.
00:55:39.836 - 00:55:40.764, Speaker A: And you can.
00:55:41.064 - 00:55:43.992, Speaker B: Maybe I'll pass it over to you. Are you able to explain that?
00:55:44.048 - 00:56:29.406, Speaker D: Yeah. So, okay, so there are many versions of Bitvm, but let me explain the most basic version. Okay, so basically, you can express any computation as a tree of computation of simpler gates, okay? Like an and o. You can express complicated functions, okay? In terms of n and or gates, okay, now, the reason why this is important is because actually, bitcoin script has the opcodes to describe all these n and or gates. So, in principle, you can write down the entire computation tree to describe your function and put it on bitvm. Okay, the problem, as I mentioned, is that it's too big. It's too huge, okay.
00:56:29.406 - 00:57:04.880, Speaker D: Too costly, impossible. Okay? So what bitvm does is the concept is the following, okay? This computational tree, instead of putting it on the entire blockchain bitcoin chain, this computation tree is actually put outside, is in the mind of someone who wants to prove a certain computation, and it's also in the mind of someone who wants to challenge this computation. So both the party off chain have this tree in mind. They do the computation, the prover does the computation, reports a result, and put the result on the bitcoin chain.
00:57:04.952 - 00:57:05.608, Speaker A: Okay?
00:57:05.736 - 00:57:14.104, Speaker D: Now, the verifier can run through exactly the same computation off chain, off chain and can come to either the same conclusion, same output, or the different output.
00:57:14.184 - 00:57:14.760, Speaker A: Okay.
00:57:14.872 - 00:57:31.210, Speaker D: If the same output. Good, I agree with the prover, I've no, I have nothing to say. I'll let you go. Okay, so the proof, the result is considered correct. Now you have to verify. The challenger decides that, hey, you know what? My result is different from yours. So you have lied.
00:57:31.362 - 00:57:32.098, Speaker A: Okay?
00:57:32.226 - 00:58:33.946, Speaker D: And now basically what BitVM designed is instead of not forcing the prover to put the entire tree on the bitcoin chain, to force to figure out where the errors were, because, you know, because the result is incorrect, there must be stuff at some gate in which the computation was incorrect. Okay, so basically what the challenger is, instead of forcing the prover to put the whole tree, which is impractical, it asked the prover a bunch of intelligent questions to kind of narrow down through some kind of binary search. All right, so binary search is a concept that I assume a typical five year old would not understand. I understand, but this is the intelligent. That's where the smart five year old comes from. From the binary search would basically very quickly narrow down where the fraud being made by the prover is. And every time the prover has to answer a question, he has to put something on chain.
00:58:33.946 - 00:58:50.404, Speaker D: He has to put something on chain. But now the compute, the mask on the point on chain is kind of exponentially smaller than the size of the tree. And so it makes the cost of challenging and proving practical more practical, I should say. More practical.
00:58:50.484 - 00:58:50.964, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:51.084 - 00:59:29.208, Speaker B: Let me try to summarize to make sure I actually understand it. So between BitVM and existing op roll ups, I think there's conceptually two very big differences. One is in BiTVM, you have to work around the limitations associated with opcode on the bitcoin blockchain. And the way to do that is to convert the functions. Any arbitrary function can convert that into a tree of or and operations. And then you can play these games to, if the challenger, if the verifier disagrees with the prover, then. Sorry, if the challenger disagrees with the function, how do you call it?
00:59:29.216 - 00:59:33.728, Speaker D: The function? Yeah. The prover is making an assertion about the valuable function.
00:59:33.856 - 00:59:46.128, Speaker B: If they disagree, then they can use a binary search to find where the computation, where in the tree does the computation disagree between the two. So that's the first major difference between op roll.
00:59:46.256 - 00:59:58.800, Speaker A: So this is an outside prover verifier, so that you could search and review the tree to find the errors and then prove it against, or bring it out to, or call it out for the prover, right? Yeah.
00:59:58.832 - 01:00:17.228, Speaker D: So you basically have to the tree, the entire tree is huge. The key point here is that because you're doing binary search? Each step of question response have to be interacting with the bitcoin chain, because the bitcoin chain needs to record the correctness of this challenge response, but only.
01:00:17.356 - 01:00:19.544, Speaker A: How'S the time factor?
01:00:20.644 - 01:00:34.028, Speaker D: Okay. That's another dimension. Because bitcoin is a slow chain, and because you have to do multiple rounds of these challenge response, the whole time of this challenge period is right along.
01:00:34.156 - 01:00:35.596, Speaker A: Yes. Like, how long?
01:00:35.740 - 01:00:42.612, Speaker D: Right now, the length we are that Robin is proposing is about six months.
01:00:42.748 - 01:00:43.484, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
01:00:43.604 - 01:00:46.180, Speaker B: Six months to challenge one transaction.
01:00:46.332 - 01:00:48.780, Speaker A: So, versus. Yeah.
01:00:48.812 - 01:01:11.696, Speaker D: So basically, you have 32 in his system. He's building. He has 32 challenges, up to 32 challenges. Each challenge requires, basically, bitcoin to respond. And bitcoin is slow. And just like in Avitrum, each challenge is about seven days. Okay, so each time, seven days, 32 challenges.
01:01:11.696 - 01:01:16.464, Speaker D: 2200, 200 odd days. So it's about half a year. So it's pretty low. Slow.
01:01:16.504 - 01:01:16.912, Speaker B: Wow.
01:01:17.008 - 01:01:42.494, Speaker A: Okay. I mean, for me, for trial night, the reason why we use bitcoin ordinals, it's. We consider it as the. The luxury chain. And so, at least for the crypto natives, we think that the slowness, the clunkiness is a feature. And so it might not be for retail, but we've kind of sold ourselves to think that that's the case and.
01:01:42.534 - 01:01:43.214, Speaker B: We'Re okay with it.
01:01:43.254 - 01:02:14.074, Speaker A: I mean, ordinals actually isn't that bad. Being able to send and receive transactions happens pretty quickly within ordinals, so it's not bad. And so with BitVM and then, you know, with other roll ups or other vms using bitcoin, maybe restaking wise, et cetera, I think we could see some interesting use cases where bitcoin maxis might be more open to using EVM roll ups that anchor to, say, bitcoin as an example. I could see that being a wedge. So, yeah, I think we're at time. Any final thoughts, David?
01:02:14.194 - 01:02:19.414, Speaker D: No, we had a lot of deep thoughts already. Way beyond five year old thoughts, I think.
01:02:23.234 - 01:02:27.274, Speaker A: Great. Well, you know, thank you so much for your time, David. It was great to chat with you.
01:02:27.354 - 01:02:30.514, Speaker D: Nice meeting you guys. Imran and Charles, great conversation.
01:02:30.634 - 01:02:31.378, Speaker A: Likewise.
01:02:31.506 - 01:02:32.534, Speaker B: Nice meeting you guys.
01:02:32.914 - 01:02:53.168, Speaker A: So, what are your thoughts on happening price? Is it the same as before? It seems like everyone that I've come across is asking me about the happening. So it seems like it's a. It's like, I don't know, a federal holiday or a global holiday of some sort, like Mother's Day or something. Everyone is aware of it.
01:02:53.256 - 01:02:56.408, Speaker B: Yeah, it's the FLMC of bitcoin.
01:02:56.536 - 01:02:57.244, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:02:57.624 - 01:03:01.364, Speaker B: Except it happens every four years instead of every month.
01:03:01.864 - 01:03:24.196, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember in 2016 I had the timer on and I was just. I had it on and once it passed, once it. Once the time occurred, you know, I looked around and nothing really happened. I just remember that being my reaction. I think that's going to be the reaction for every happening. Like nothing's really going to happen. People think it's going to be a glorious day, but nothing really happens.
01:03:24.196 - 01:03:24.876, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:24.980 - 01:03:53.688, Speaker B: Well, in the early days, I would argue that the having actually mattered because in the early days, every having had a pretty meaningful impact on the supply itself. But over time, by definition, the having, the havings effect on the reduction of supply diminishes. Diminishes every having, right. So now you could make the argument that in terms of actual supply reduction is not meaningful anymore. You can make the argument either way, to be honest, but certainly less meaningful than it used to be.
01:03:53.776 - 01:04:01.304, Speaker A: I mean, we already had a blackrock announcement. I mean, the ETF announcement is similar to having as it is. Right. The impact of emissions.
01:04:01.424 - 01:04:41.144, Speaker B: My back to the napkin calculation for the ETF, it was many, many different halvings. It was much bigger than the having effect itself. Obviously, these past two weeks, the inflow was a lot weaker. But if you look at the two months in total, the ETF was meaningfully bigger than the hymen itself. But that said, the mind share around bitcoin is what causes, is what leads to a positive impact. Because like, if you look at, if you look at all the launches that's going to happen. Why do they choose the having to launch their protocols? Like rooms and the L2s, they all choose the halving to launch their protocol.
01:04:41.144 - 01:04:52.440, Speaker B: Obviously this is a very big mind share point for everyone, for all the developers. So this thing as a shelling point is meaningful.
01:04:52.592 - 01:05:14.726, Speaker A: I agree. I think it's a giant also, like marketing event. Right. For bitcoin and everyone else. I also want to call out this tweet that based 16 z tweeted out, which I think adds to the thesis around mind share and attention. There are two categories of new launches. No attention, one to 2 billion ftv.
01:05:14.726 - 01:05:25.620, Speaker A: Attention, ten to 20 billion ftv. I think it's fair to say that we live in a time where attention matters most, and launching at peak attention probably makes the most sense.
01:05:25.782 - 01:05:45.400, Speaker B: Unfortunately, every coin is a meme coin. It is what it is. A lot of people will hate what I just said, but it is what it is. A lot of the coins I'm not going to name names, but a lot of the coins in the top 30 that command ridiculous valuations, they have no purpose. They actually have zero purpose. They don't need to exist for the protocol to work. And the token holders don't get anything.
01:05:45.400 - 01:05:52.692, Speaker B: They don't get any cash flow. In many protocols, the cash flow is close to zero. It's all a mind share game.
01:05:52.808 - 01:06:22.794, Speaker A: Okay, so a lot of L2s have tokens too. I mean, a lot of different apps have tokens. Where does it all go from here? I guess, I mean, token is what makes us fundamentally different than all the other sectors that are in the space. It is what gives us the attention. Right? That's the value. And sometimes I feel like apps try to pigeonhole tokens as a way to show that there is some value. And so we've got governance, or what I call decentralized theatrics.
01:06:22.794 - 01:06:51.176, Speaker A: We have staking. We have staking to get more token airdrops. I mean, when we hear about it sounds funny, but when you're in the narrative, it feels good. Right? And you have staking to get yield. I mean, there's so many other like types of kind of, oh, three three was one popular one, if you remember that with olympus.
01:06:51.280 - 01:06:54.696, Speaker B: Don't you think the entire crypto space is a three three?
01:06:54.840 - 01:06:57.016, Speaker A: If you really ask me, the whole world is just three three.
01:06:57.160 - 01:07:03.736, Speaker B: That's true. But especially crypto, because three three is about. Look, we're not going to dump on each other.
01:07:03.880 - 01:07:09.816, Speaker A: I mean, that's the whole point about front tech, too. If you remember when Frontech launched with the whole three three movement within frontech.
01:07:09.840 - 01:07:10.328, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:07:10.456 - 01:07:16.138, Speaker A: Like if you watch our podcast in front tech, I was clearly in the narrative and.
01:07:16.266 - 01:07:19.042, Speaker B: And bitcoin is the best. Three three it is.
01:07:19.218 - 01:07:29.874, Speaker A: Which is bitcoin gold. Yeah. And what is gold? If you really ask me, it's also three three. Oh, shit.
01:07:29.914 - 01:07:34.174, Speaker B: So gold has been. Has been crazy. In the last.
01:07:34.834 - 01:07:35.626, Speaker A: It shot up.
01:07:35.690 - 01:07:50.604, Speaker B: Yeah, in the last. Well, it's not just the world war three thing, but ever since it broke the all time high. Was it a couple months ago? Maybe a few. A few weeks ago, it's been crushing it. Peter Schiff finally had a good time. Having a good time.
01:07:50.724 - 01:07:57.620, Speaker A: He is. All right, so the other area I want to talk about is tan Telegram.
01:07:57.652 - 01:07:58.304, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
01:08:00.604 - 01:08:11.446, Speaker A: Internally, you were very bullish on it. I mean, I was also very bullish on it. But recently you've been exploring the space. I'm curious on what you've seen there that got you excited. Okay.
01:08:11.470 - 01:08:30.276, Speaker B: So the fundamental ideas is the same as Bayes. I think we talked about Bayes maybe a year ago and the thesis was Coinbase was going to bring the users to base and Coinbase has, what, 100 million users? And guess how many users telegram has 300,000,800 monthly active.
01:08:30.390 - 01:08:31.488, Speaker A: Oh my God.
01:08:31.656 - 01:09:01.090, Speaker B: So telegram actually has an order of magnitude more users than Coinbase. Oh, by the way, the 100 million coinbase is like a registered user. It's not even active. So the active is a smaller number than the registered. So Telegram is going to launch. Well, it has launched this blockchain called Tan, and at some point telegram, the app, the messenger, will bring the users to ton of blockchain. That's the thesis, very simple.
01:09:01.090 - 01:09:13.290, Speaker B: And it's proving out with Baze. Right. Baze is now the shelling point for bitcoin L2, for ethereum L2 s despite the fact that it doesn't have a token and we'll probably not launch a token.
01:09:13.402 - 01:09:22.264, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the idea of, I think the notion of not launching token is demand. It's driving more speculation on base.
01:09:22.394 - 01:09:25.860, Speaker B: Because now you want to can speculate on the meme coins.
01:09:26.052 - 01:09:44.852, Speaker A: Exactly. So there's a kind of lever to that, right. Where people are hyper speculating, like say djen layer three as a way to gain exposure. There's front tech, so now people are hyper speculating in front tech as the, as a token for base. But yeah, going back to your point of time.
01:09:44.908 - 01:10:15.752, Speaker B: Okay, back to Tom, I played around with maybe 20 different apps. I found two things. One is the vast majority of apps that are native to. Okay, so when you use taunt, there's several ways you can use it. You can use it through Telegram, the messenger, you can also use it through a traditional browser based extension, but a browser based wallet similar to Metamask. So you can do transactions, you can do swap through that browser. And there's probably some mobile apps as well.
01:10:15.752 - 01:10:31.052, Speaker B: But the two main ways is to interact with from the Telegram messenger and through the browser on the Telegram messenger, the mobile app itself. Native app. Most ton based dapps geo block us users.
01:10:31.188 - 01:10:32.144, Speaker A: Why is that?
01:10:33.084 - 01:10:35.584, Speaker B: I guess they just don't want to fuck with the SEC.
01:10:36.244 - 01:10:37.344, Speaker A: That's annoying.
01:10:39.404 - 01:11:02.568, Speaker B: And it's annoying. It's not. IP geofencing, like most apps, do, offense us users based on their ip. So when you use a VPN, it can still work. The apps can still work with you, for you if you use a VPN. But with the dapps on Telegram, they identify you through your phone number. So even if you use a VPN, it doesn't work because they know you have a us based number.
01:11:02.568 - 01:11:08.512, Speaker B: So in order to use the ton based apps, you need a burner number that's non us.
01:11:08.688 - 01:11:11.124, Speaker A: So you were able to get around it.
01:11:12.224 - 01:11:19.528, Speaker B: I won't comment on that, but generally it feels like the Dapps are very janky. It's very early.
01:11:19.656 - 01:11:20.376, Speaker A: We're very early.
01:11:20.440 - 01:11:29.608, Speaker B: Very early. However early it might be. The top dapps have a ton of users, so one of them is called not coin.
01:11:29.736 - 01:11:30.304, Speaker A: Not coin?
01:11:30.344 - 01:11:35.772, Speaker B: Yeah, not coin. It's a stupid game. You should try it. It's a really, really stupid game.
01:11:35.948 - 01:11:36.984, Speaker A: What's the game?
01:11:38.084 - 01:11:45.308, Speaker B: You click on a thing to collect some tokens. You just keep on clicking to collect tokens.
01:11:45.396 - 01:11:45.892, Speaker A: That's it.
01:11:45.948 - 01:11:47.452, Speaker B: That's the game. And you can level up.
01:11:47.468 - 01:11:48.444, Speaker A: That's a great game.
01:11:48.604 - 01:12:17.644, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. It's very simple, but people love that. And it has, I can't remember how many users it had, but it had more users than any Ethereum or Solana based dapps I've ever seen. Because. Because the users come from Telegram, the app, there's 1 billion, close to 1 billion telegram users. And dapps on Telegram go viral very easily, I guess.
01:12:17.944 - 01:12:38.214, Speaker A: I haven't personally done a lot of my work on messaging apps. The concept of super apps in the US is non existent. And so how do you think. I guess we're. I guess the US isn't the primary target customers here. But do you feel like they have something here with mini apps, mini crypto apps?
01:12:38.334 - 01:12:55.510, Speaker B: Telegram is definitely a super app. It has been a super app even without the tongue blockchain. Yeah, because it has a bunch of bots that you can interact with. I guess the blockchain just enables financial transactions, so it enables financial apps within the ton super app within the Telegram super app.
01:12:55.622 - 01:13:26.002, Speaker A: So I see. Okay. And so the bullish narrative here is the fact that if people can reach, I mean, because you have embedded wallets with Telegram within Telegram, you can reach users much more quickly. And in fact, you could probably do everything natively on Telegram in and itself. So I guess, like, you know, right now I would. I feel crypto is missing. Is mobile distribution for the most part, outside of Coinbase and maybe fantom.
01:13:26.002 - 01:13:58.094, Speaker A: I don't really use anything else day to day for my crypto experiences, mobile via mobile. I think this could be a great way to, because I know Telegram has great security for the most part, from what I've heard and read, you could manage your private keys and you can manage some good amount of money. And start to use telegram as a kind of an app layer. This was the original thesis of backpack, by the way, with XnfT, if you remember. So it's interesting that this is coming down, this to this strategy.
01:13:58.174 - 01:13:59.434, Speaker B: The other thing I found.
01:14:01.254 - 01:14:01.702, Speaker A: About the.
01:14:01.718 - 01:14:27.378, Speaker B: Ton blockchain is that the transactions are pretty expensive and I don't know what's going on. So it costs like maybe $0.05, like during a normal time, cost five cents to send and maybe ten cents to swap something to that effect. And then during rush hour or peak time, it could go up to. So it's more expensive than bitcoin L2s.
01:14:27.466 - 01:14:27.890, Speaker A: Oh, sorry.
01:14:27.922 - 01:14:29.402, Speaker B: Ethereum L2s. And Solana.
01:14:29.538 - 01:14:30.906, Speaker A: Wow. I'm not sure why.
01:14:30.930 - 01:14:38.786, Speaker B: I'm not quite sure why. Maybe they just have a lot of users. But the even more curious thing is that no one on Twitter talks about.
01:14:38.810 - 01:14:41.144, Speaker A: Tan, which is the opportunity. Right?
01:14:41.184 - 01:14:41.592, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:14:41.688 - 01:14:48.168, Speaker A: I mean, there are some traders. Ansem has talked about this, but he just talked about how you missed it.
01:14:48.216 - 01:15:05.706, Speaker B: But they talk about it because the price went up like ten x in the last month and it kicked Cardano out of the top ten. So everyone is celebrating. But I realized why no one is talking about Tan on Twitter. Do you know what the reason is? But what do you think the reason is?
01:15:05.880 - 01:15:23.126, Speaker A: Maybe two reasons. One, lack of us support. Two is Solana and base have a lot of mind share right now. I mean, there's a active. Like, you don't see anybody from the town ecosystem actively talking about tan. Right? Like, they aren't. Like, you don't have the Jesse equivalent.
01:15:23.150 - 01:15:24.034, Speaker B: Well, there is.
01:15:24.334 - 01:15:25.214, Speaker C: Oh, there is.
01:15:25.294 - 01:15:32.914, Speaker B: There is that. Well, not on Twitter. But the Jesse Pollock equivalent of tonight is very active on telegram.
01:15:33.034 - 01:15:39.674, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, he needs to be active on Twitter. Yeah. Okay, so there is someone like Jesse from telegram.
01:15:39.714 - 01:15:43.250, Speaker B: And their public announcements are djen as fuck.
01:15:43.402 - 01:15:43.690, Speaker A: Really?
01:15:43.722 - 01:15:45.734, Speaker B: Like, it's really, really refreshing.
01:15:46.194 - 01:15:48.694, Speaker A: How do I join this announcement group?
01:15:49.434 - 01:15:55.826, Speaker B: Okay, let me see the name. Okay, so it's called the Carol from top.
01:15:55.970 - 01:15:58.780, Speaker A: Okay. We can share. We can link it to our show notes. Right? Yeah.
01:15:58.892 - 01:16:03.004, Speaker B: The open platform. That's the Twitter or the telegram handle.
01:16:03.124 - 01:16:05.436, Speaker A: Oh, by the way. But you're right.
01:16:05.460 - 01:16:20.700, Speaker B: So the reason why no one talks about Tan on Twitter is because Twitter is highly us centric and Tan is originally from eastern Europe. And also Tan is not listed on the tier one exchanges. No one has a bag. No one on Twitter has a bag.
01:16:20.812 - 01:16:32.010, Speaker A: Very interesting. So there's an announcement. Sorry, I'm going to cut you here for a second. Well, let's finish this because they just announced the cat stuff. The op cat. Okay, I want to talk about that too later, but go ahead.
01:16:32.082 - 01:16:32.794, Speaker B: No, I'm done.
01:16:32.874 - 01:16:44.534, Speaker A: All right, so just to end this telegram conversation, when do we think we'll see apps that people can use every day? Like when. When will it hit crypto? Twitters beehive because it seems like it hasn't hit it yet.
01:16:45.594 - 01:16:54.652, Speaker B: I have no idea, but I feel like it's starting because Anson tweeted about it. I tweeted about it and then a few traders tweeted about it. It's starting.
01:16:54.748 - 01:17:23.074, Speaker A: Interesting. So it's starting. Okay, I'm going to quickly talk about which I had originally talked about, which was the op cat they just announced twelve minutes ago. Cat VM is the first permissionless bitcoin bridge, allowing scaling in layers with no liquidity requirements, decentralized trading of ordinals and runes, and much more. Cat VM is powered by op cat and quantum cats. So is this bullish for quantum cats?
01:17:24.654 - 01:17:30.790, Speaker B: So your first question is, is this bullish for quantum cats? My first question is, what the fuck is this?
01:17:30.982 - 01:17:38.114, Speaker A: Well, I mean, obviously I wonder what that is too. But the first thing is how do you get exposure? Then? The second thing is how does it work?
01:17:38.414 - 01:17:46.540, Speaker B: So you're in the ape first research later mode because your first question is, how do I ape? Second question is what the fuck it is.
01:17:46.702 - 01:17:53.696, Speaker A: Yep. Because if you have a good exposure to this, then you can read about it.
01:17:53.800 - 01:17:58.360, Speaker B: Why don't we. Why don't we research this and report back on the next episode?
01:17:58.512 - 01:18:20.902, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'll read through the abstract just so that people have some insight to break out this model. Bitcoin consensus rules need covenants, the ability to restrict the future flow of coins. OpCAT provides covenant functionality and also enables bitcoin script to simulate finite state machine. Cat VM utilizes both of those properties to encumber BTC with arbitrary computation via permissionless optimistic withdrawal path.
01:18:20.998 - 01:18:26.222, Speaker B: Wait, so is it a, is it a competitor to BitVM? Is that what it sounds like?
01:18:26.398 - 01:18:27.694, Speaker A: That's what it sounds like.
01:18:27.814 - 01:18:30.790, Speaker B: Because he was fighting BitVM earlier, right?
01:18:30.902 - 01:18:31.478, Speaker A: Yep.
01:18:31.606 - 01:18:36.686, Speaker B: While shilling op cad. So that's my gut reaction. Could be wrong.
01:18:36.830 - 01:18:45.314, Speaker A: That's what it seems like to me. But we'll have to wait till next episode just so that we can dive deeper into what this means for. For everyone else.
01:18:45.814 - 01:18:46.502, Speaker B: What else do we have?
01:18:46.518 - 01:18:48.822, Speaker A: All right, what else do we have? Let's see.
01:18:48.958 - 01:18:50.158, Speaker B: Hong Kong etf's.
01:18:50.286 - 01:18:55.718, Speaker A: Yeah, let's talk about that. I know you recently tweeted about this. So I'm curious on what you think.
01:18:55.846 - 01:19:34.414, Speaker B: So Hong Kong approved was ethereum, bitcoin and ethereum ETF's. Yeah, and I think there's a lot of misinformation on the english speaking Twitter. People think it's very, very, very bullish. Bitcoin, ethereum, because it enables 1.4 billion chinese people to buy bitcoin and ethereum. The reality is the ETF's are listed on Hong Kong Hong Kong Exchange, and it's very likely that the vast majority of mainlenders won't be able to access those two ETF's.
01:19:35.114 - 01:19:42.578, Speaker A: The mainland China. Chinese citizens can't access those two ETF's. But like the everyday retail people, right?
01:19:42.626 - 01:19:56.778, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe the institutions can, but we don't know yet. But at least tuition can. Yeah, maybe, but retail for sure. Not. At least not initially. So it's a. It's one country, 1.5
01:19:56.778 - 01:19:57.458, Speaker B: system.
01:19:57.586 - 01:20:03.058, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay. So it's not as big of an impact as everyone thought it was going.
01:20:03.066 - 01:20:08.994, Speaker B: To be, at least not from the flow perspective. It is a big symbolic step.
01:20:09.114 - 01:20:09.538, Speaker A: It is.
01:20:09.586 - 01:20:23.050, Speaker B: Because, you know, because there's no way Hong Kong can approve the ETF's without the backing of the central government. Like basically the government saying implicitly that this thing called bitcoin and ethereum is legit.
01:20:23.162 - 01:20:28.850, Speaker A: And so this could be a step in the right direction for crypto adoption in mainland China, for sure, is what you're saying.
01:20:28.962 - 01:20:34.204, Speaker B: Oh, by the way, did you know that you can open. Chinese people can open a binance account.
01:20:34.314 - 01:20:36.288, Speaker A: Do you know that? No, I didn't know that.
01:20:36.416 - 01:20:44.200, Speaker B: Crypto, I mean, crypto was never banned. Was never banned. Banned in China. With a chinese passport, you can open a binance account, you can open an OKX account.
01:20:44.352 - 01:20:48.912, Speaker A: Has this always been the case? Because I remember there was like going back and forth where they could, they couldn't.
01:20:48.968 - 01:21:00.280, Speaker B: There's, there's always fud and there was always some statements, vague statements from the government, but practically speaking, chinese nationals can't open binance accounts.
01:21:00.392 - 01:21:01.376, Speaker A: That's pretty big.
01:21:01.480 - 01:21:02.736, Speaker B: It's always been the case.
01:21:02.880 - 01:21:16.424, Speaker A: Interesting. So I guess we already have asian adoption then. I don't think there's any. I guess the question is, are there any catalysts in the next six months, a year for China and Asia at large that you could think of?
01:21:16.544 - 01:21:30.164, Speaker B: I mean, the whole ordinals thing started or at least had a very strong group of speculators in China. A lot of bitcoin L2 teams are chinese teams based in Singapore.
01:21:30.244 - 01:21:31.344, Speaker A: I've noticed that.
01:21:33.204 - 01:21:43.740, Speaker B: And the chinese stock market has been down only. The real estate has been down only. Economy is not doing well. So where are people going to invest their money?
01:21:43.852 - 01:21:58.158, Speaker A: Crypto. Very interesting. So this is creating an organic community of builders that are going to actually actively support crypto. So this is a great wedge for crypto, I think adoption in the east.
01:21:58.286 - 01:22:00.070, Speaker B: Well, do you mean the ETF?
01:22:00.182 - 01:22:16.794, Speaker A: No, I'm just talking about the Asia landscape, right. Where everything is down only. And with the prices where it's at, it is bringing a lot more attention to the builders community to come and build in the space and invest in the space.
01:22:17.634 - 01:22:30.826, Speaker B: Well, okay. There's some nuance there. It's not all of Asia, it's really just China. China has been down only. The chinese stock market has been down only. Japan has been killing it. India has been killing it stock market wise.
01:22:30.826 - 01:22:34.730, Speaker B: And I think it's just China. It's been down only.
01:22:34.882 - 01:23:06.640, Speaker A: So some fun, some cool things that I saw recently. Blackrock transfers two hundred fifty k to Ondo. Okay, interesting. Bowdoin NFT launched yesterday. Wizards launched not too long ago. There's a mad scientists on osmosis that's going to launch tomorrow, I think, which is another NFT product project. So, yeah, some fun stuff happening in some of those ecosystems.
01:23:06.640 - 01:23:47.658, Speaker A: I do always worry about wonder about Cosmos. Recently Zaki tweeted out that Cosmos atom success could be predicated on the Cosmos SDK adoption, because Cosmos SDK adoption is happening everywhere on ethereum, on bitcoin. So he's saying what he insinuated and there's we need to do a Cosmos podcast. But what he insinuated is that maybe the way forward for Atom and Cosmos is the adoption of Cosmos SDK. And I'm not sure what that means for the token price or anything else, but that's what he insinuated. So it's interesting to read that. And for those listening, thanks for listening.
