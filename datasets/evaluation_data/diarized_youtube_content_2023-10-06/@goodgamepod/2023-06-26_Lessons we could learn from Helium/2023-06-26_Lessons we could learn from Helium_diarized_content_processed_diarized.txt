It's almost like nine years now, and now they're just starting to get the demand side figured out. He reiterates to other founders, this is a very long game. Two is understanding who your contributors are and how do you target them. Obviously, contributors can be those that run infrastructure for you in return for tokens and what their value proposition is going to be within your network.
00:00:31.508 - 00:00:57.644, Speaker A: And so the value proposition could be like, do they get a vote? How active should they be? How should the tokens be designed in a way that could steer more involvement in the community, et cetera. Three is understand, like this is a two sided marketplace at the end of the day, right? Focusing on just the supply side, which Chow mentioned is the user side, is one important element of building out the network. But the demand side is also very important and start to think about how they can get involved in the space.
