00:00:00.160 - 00:00:40.130, Speaker A: So we talked about this during the talk, right? Finding your wedge as a startup who doesn't already have overwhelming market share in your category, you have to find something that is differentiated, that is so different that the incumbents are not doing for us. We've actually encountered this a couple of times on Solana, just with nfts themselves, and those are like new standards or even like inscriptions on Solana. So taking a step back, there was basically a whole movement of taking. The idea of inscriptions and ordinals from bitcoin and copy pasting it to every other chain makes no sense intuitively. Like why someone would do inscriptions on Solana on bitcoin. It's the only way to do nfts on Solana. It's not the only way to do nfts.
00:00:40.130 - 00:00:56.434, Speaker A: You can do it much more efficiently. That being said, people latch onto that narrative. So going back to the idea that people in crypto are trading based on a single narrative or a couple of narratives, we had to jump on inscriptions. Otherwise we might have faced disruption by some other startup who jumped on it quicker than us.
