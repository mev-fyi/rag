00:00:00.480 - 00:00:07.873, Speaker A: Which community will actually try to resist, will try to actually fight and risk in jail time.
00:00:08.009 - 00:00:36.479, Speaker B: Welcome to Good Game, a podcast for crypto insiders. Let's talk about the elephant in the room, which is Tornado Cash. Obviously. I've seen Tornado Cash launch a year and a half, probably like a year and a half ago, and thought it was very interesting dynamic that's going to be added to the crypto defi ecosystem. What were your first thoughts on Tornado Cash when it was first launched?
00:00:36.607 - 00:01:09.275, Speaker A: Oh, when it was first launched. I've always thought if you want real privacy, you need privacy as a base layer, which is the problem that has haunted Bitcoin for many, many years. That said, Tornado was a good addition to the ecosystem. However, if you look at the actual usage, the actual usage never really match the amount of hype and certainly not the token price.
00:01:09.615 - 00:01:10.355, Speaker C: Right.
00:01:12.255 - 00:01:40.091, Speaker A: I've seen some stats that said at least a third of transactions happening on Ternal Cash was actually by criminals rather than law abiding people trying to, for instance, like send their salary or receive their salary in a private matter. They don't want their employer to know what they do with their own money, like that kind of stuff, which is a completely legitimate use case.
00:01:40.123 - 00:01:40.579, Speaker C: Right.
00:01:40.707 - 00:01:46.855, Speaker A: Anyway, that's like my thought before the ban. What do you think?
00:01:47.315 - 00:01:55.273, Speaker B: Obviously there has to be a way for people that are interacting on the Internet to have a way to anonymize what they do.
00:01:55.329 - 00:01:55.545, Speaker D: Right.
00:01:55.585 - 00:02:52.635, Speaker B: I mean, if you think about VPNs, I mean it essentially does some of that for you. I mean, obviously you can. There are still some interesting loopholes, but for the average user, a VPN works just fine. And so to me, like Tornado Cash was a great addition to the defi ecosystem and I would have expected more usage than where it is now. What doesn't help is, you know, is where we are in the crypto ecosystem, which is ultimately like you have bridges that are insecure, you have defi protocols that haven't thought much about security. And you get like economic hackers or, you know, black, black hats that come in and they extract value and the only way they can legitimately take out the capital is by, you know, using these, you know, mixer protocols like Tornado Cash. Yeah, and unfortunately it's partially because where we are and then partially it's because of the protocols that are available for hackers today.
00:02:52.635 - 00:03:17.141, Speaker B: But I see this as a moment that's very similar to if you remember, like, I don't know, like Napster and like limewire. There was this period where like, you know, everybody was just downloading free music and artists were getting, you know, fucked around because they weren't able to like capture the royalties. And. And so the, the government came hard on them.
00:03:17.173 - 00:03:17.485, Speaker D: Right.
00:03:17.565 - 00:03:24.109, Speaker B: And then similarly, like, if you look at like Pirate Bay, you know, same thing.
00:03:24.157 - 00:03:24.365, Speaker D: Right.
00:03:24.405 - 00:03:33.813, Speaker B: I mean, obviously there's some illicit, like, things going on with Pirate Bay, like getting drugs and all that, but you know, overall, you know, it's a black market.
00:03:33.869 - 00:03:34.229, Speaker D: Right.
00:03:34.317 - 00:03:48.727, Speaker B: On the Internet. So I think similarly, we're going through that again and we just have to find a way to defend ourselves to make sure that we have neutral protocols that can facilitate whatever interactions that we're looking for.
00:03:48.871 - 00:03:49.319, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:49.367 - 00:04:04.857, Speaker A: I mean, this OFAC news is certainly a wake up call for our industry because it exposes the most sensible layers of the stack.
00:04:05.001 - 00:04:05.329, Speaker C: Right?
00:04:05.377 - 00:04:05.865, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:05.985 - 00:04:52.675, Speaker A: So immediately within two days after OFAC put Tornado Cash on the sanction list, number one, the front end went down. It was a. Usually it's a combination of an attack on the DNS and. Or the server serving the front end getting attacked as well. We also saw the GitHub repo for tenure cache getting banned by GitHub. Even if Git as a protocol is a decentralized protocol, GitHub as a front end has a massive power against its users.
00:04:52.755 - 00:04:53.375, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:54.095 - 00:05:00.319, Speaker A: And the repo got shut down. What else did we see? The Discord Group was shut down two days after.
00:05:00.447 - 00:05:01.115, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:04.415 - 00:05:08.795, Speaker A: Anything else? I feel like there's one or two more things.
00:05:09.655 - 00:05:16.955, Speaker B: I felt like any software that touched Tornado Cash ultimately was a choke point.
00:05:18.455 - 00:05:39.359, Speaker A: So a bunch of defi protocols, especially the bigger ones. Right. Well, also the stablecoin protocols, usdc, dydx, a bunch of others, they had no choice but to comply and they banned basically the addresses that interacted with Tornado Eth.
00:05:39.527 - 00:05:40.239, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:40.407 - 00:05:55.485, Speaker A: So basically this incident exposed four or five highly sensible layers in our stack. I said this a long time ago. The system that we build is only as censorable as its most censorable layer.
00:05:55.865 - 00:05:56.497, Speaker B: Yep.
00:05:56.601 - 00:06:37.615, Speaker A: And so the entire stack must be decentralized if we want to withstand, you know, attacks like this. By the way, I don't think, you know, this particular incident was an example of a malicious attack by the government. I think it's more ignorance. They actually don't know. I don't think they know that Ternal Cash is a neutral protocol. They don't understand the nuance behind this. They probably literally thought that Ternal Cash was built by North Koreans and the infamous North Korean hacker group and legitimately built for money laundering.
00:06:38.195 - 00:06:38.747, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:38.851 - 00:06:56.595, Speaker A: So I thought it was mostly Instance of ignorance rather than malicious attack. And so if we want to withstand ignorant attacks like this, we need to decentralize the entire stack.
00:06:58.255 - 00:07:05.055, Speaker B: Good point. I mean, like RPC nodes. I mean, that's right.
00:07:05.095 - 00:07:13.117, Speaker A: RPC is the other one that I forgot. Yeah, Infuria, definitely. I forgot if Alchemy also did the same thing.
00:07:13.221 - 00:07:28.373, Speaker B: Did it? Yeah. So it's almost as if we're building fintech software and we should be really focusing our time on decentralized protocols.
00:07:28.429 - 00:07:28.765, Speaker D: Right.
00:07:28.845 - 00:07:33.805, Speaker B: Where it's truly decentralized and there's a personal liability that goes with this.
00:07:33.845 - 00:07:34.069, Speaker D: Right.
00:07:34.117 - 00:07:46.513, Speaker B: So what was most interesting for me was when Pocket Network came out and they said even though we're decentralized or somewhat decentralized, we are a name team out of Florida.
00:07:46.609 - 00:07:47.245, Speaker D: Right.
00:07:47.825 - 00:08:09.915, Speaker B: And it turns out like even if you build decentralized software, if you are a founder with a name and the legal jurisdiction no matter where you live, so as long as it's compliant with, you know, with America, American laws and the UN and all of that, then there is a chance that you could be extradited.
00:08:09.995 - 00:08:10.499, Speaker D: Right.
00:08:10.627 - 00:08:14.739, Speaker B: And so personal liability is actually very important in all of this.
00:08:14.907 - 00:08:17.403, Speaker A: The team is actually the weakest layer of the stack.
00:08:17.539 - 00:08:41.863, Speaker B: That's right. That's right. I guess the question then is like, if you are looking to build decentralized software, do you go out as an Anon or, or do you figure out a way to become decentralized as soon as possible? I mean there, the problem with becoming decentralized as soon as possible is that you can't. I mean like you have to build a company and you have to build a product.
00:08:42.039 - 00:08:42.755, Speaker D: Right.
00:08:43.335 - 00:08:47.951, Speaker B: And so there's this whole trilemma effect there.
00:08:48.023 - 00:08:48.519, Speaker D: Right.
00:08:48.647 - 00:08:55.761, Speaker B: And then you have Anons which also comes with, you know, a lot of issues.
00:08:55.833 - 00:08:56.089, Speaker D: Right.
00:08:56.137 - 00:09:18.525, Speaker B: I mean if you look at all Anon soft startups that raise in the past 12 months, I think I'd say about like almost half ended up failing. And so the question then becomes, if you're a founder in the space and you want to build decentralized software and you're worried about the regulatory overhang that's happening from Tornado Cash, what do you do?
00:09:18.945 - 00:09:32.365, Speaker A: It's a very tough question. I mean, for starters, Anons will have a much harder time to get funded. Right? Like VCs funding anon projects is a bull market thing.
00:09:32.865 - 00:09:33.725, Speaker B: Yep.
00:09:34.465 - 00:09:38.081, Speaker A: It's a symptom of low level of due diligence.
00:09:38.193 - 00:09:38.845, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:40.425 - 00:10:14.725, Speaker A: So what do you do? If you decentralize too quickly, you're not going to be able to move fast enough initially and build a product that people actually want. Like building a product is not easy. You can't, like decision by committee is simply not going to work. You can't decentralize too quickly, too fast. It's a very tough question. I don't have a good answer. I mean there is a possibility that at some point what's going to happen might be that really good public non anon teams build centralized teams.
00:10:14.725 - 00:10:22.275, Speaker A: Centralized public teams build a really good product and they get censored and then they get forked by anon teams.
00:10:22.355 - 00:10:22.915, Speaker B: Yep.
00:10:23.035 - 00:10:25.155, Speaker A: Right, that's one possibility.
00:10:25.315 - 00:10:43.549, Speaker B: Yeah, it's. I think it's going to be an ongoing thought process here because ultimately founders want to build great products, but in parallel to this, you know, they want to make sure that they're not, you know, violating laws where they're personally liable.
00:10:43.717 - 00:10:44.069, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:44.117 - 00:10:48.105, Speaker B: And I think this is going to become a very common theme in the next six months to 12 months, I think.
00:10:48.805 - 00:10:49.665, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:50.685 - 00:11:52.555, Speaker A: I actually ran a thought experiment on Twitter a couple months ago. I've been thinking about this and the tweet went something like this. If one day, 10 years from now, maybe much harder than that, the US government decides that, you know, crypto is, is illegal, basically goes full Executive Order 6102, which they did a century ago. And when a full on ban of cryptocurrencies and crypto networks, which one of the crypto networks, which community will actually try to resist, will try, try to actually fight and risk in jail time. And my followers answers were basically in line with what I had thought in mind, what I had in mind, which is that the only community that will fight is bitcoin. No one else will do.
00:11:52.715 - 00:11:53.179, Speaker C: Right.
00:11:53.267 - 00:12:03.525, Speaker A: Like, I mean it is entirely understandable. Like there, there's no, like the personal liability is just way too much. So tough situation.
00:12:04.745 - 00:12:50.801, Speaker B: So we've talked a lot about this, you and I, you know, about a year and a half ago and we always imagine what a world would be like. What would be the world for crypto defi three years from now? I felt like we always came to a very similar conclusion, which is there probably would be two worlds, right? You'll have a regulated world which will serve traditional finance in let's say US and Europe and et cetera. Then you'll have the wild wild west that'll continue to run in parallel or shadow defi or whatever you want to call it. Does that still hold true today? And do you think where we are with Tornado Cash, it further validated our.
00:12:50.833 - 00:13:14.745, Speaker A: Thesis I think it's even more true today than it was two years ago. And turn of cash certainly validated our thesis. Like by definition, Ethereum now has a set of blacklisted addresses and a set of non blacklisted addresses. Like Ethereum basically already forked into two sets of addresses, one that's regulated and one that's not.
00:13:14.785 - 00:13:15.525, Speaker B: That's right.
00:13:16.625 - 00:13:44.983, Speaker A: And we've seen founders building KYC solutions for at least a year now making some progress, but probably the timing wasn't right yet. But after this turn of cash incident, I think there's going to be even more sense of urgency from major defi protocols to go into this regulated versus non regulated dichotomy.
00:13:45.119 - 00:13:45.795, Speaker C: Right?
00:13:46.095 - 00:14:17.059, Speaker B: I mean it's crazy what's happening. I mean if you look at Makerdao, they just had a recent One of the ex general counsels recently posted something on MakerDAO's forum and it said something like this. He said, I think pegging DAI to a dollar is a huge risk. I've been saying this for a long time. One, two is real world assets should not be introduced into MakerDAO's ecosystem because that's another centralizing risk.
00:14:17.187 - 00:14:37.653, Speaker A: By the way, this is a criticism I had against MakerDAO for like since the beginning. And number three, way for the DAI to differentiate from the incumbent stable coins like USDC and USDT is censorship resistance. And then at some point they introduce real world assets. These are highly censorable.
00:14:37.789 - 00:15:02.959, Speaker B: It relies too much on real world jurisdiction. Right. If you rely on laws outside of the blockchain then that's a centralizing effect. And then number three, in that forum it talked about 20% reliance on USCC, which was very obvious from a very long time ago. I never knew why they did that, but I understood the pros and cons.
00:15:03.007 - 00:15:03.215, Speaker D: Right?
00:15:03.255 - 00:15:09.995, Speaker B: But now more than ever they need to figure out their exit plan for this.
00:15:10.855 - 00:15:38.497, Speaker A: But these types of companies, by the way, the motivation to add real world assets, I mean I totally understand, I get it. They basically think of MakerDAO as a lending platform rather than a credit platform rather than a stable coin, right? So they want to let people collateralize any sort of collateral, any sort of assets, including real world assets, to borrow some credit.
00:15:38.641 - 00:15:39.325, Speaker C: Right?
00:15:40.015 - 00:16:02.143, Speaker A: So I mean I get the motivation, but Ethereum simply doesn't have a functioning decentralized alternative to USDC and USDT yet ever since the DAI added RWAs, there's.
00:16:02.159 - 00:17:11.131, Speaker B: This notion that in order for us to get real world adoption, we need to continue pursuing crypto native products into the Real world, right? Do you think that makes sense or do you think that's just another. Similar to what we just talked about earlier, another centralizing effect that can cause more issues in the long run, in the short term. And I'll give you a couple examples, right? So structured loan products, similar to what MakerDAO is launching. You have like apps that are looking to get retail users that may not be very familiar with crypto generally. And so those are, I guess, two interesting examples and there's so many more that are outside of just those two scopes. And the question then becomes, should we be building for, should we be building crypto native products for crypto native users or should we be building crypto native projects? Just startups project products for real world users that aren't crypto native and those. I feel like that's a conundrum that we always fall into.
00:17:11.283 - 00:18:33.615, Speaker A: I think there is an interesting pattern I've noticed, like whenever I see someone who's new to crypto or new to Defi, and by the way, I was new to DeFi in 2020 when DeFi really started. Everyone was new to Defi, right? When you're new to Defi, you tend to think that, you tend to get fed up with the amount of speculative activities happening in Definer. You're like, I want to build real world utilities, I want to build products for the average user. But then if you think a little bit deeper, you realize that, well, at least from a practical point of view, there's two hurdles to this. One is whenever you deal with the real world, whenever you deal with the traditional legal system, there's just so much more friction. Like getting your startup, getting your first product built has so much more friction. It's so much harder to build real world product, quote, unquote, real world products than building crypto native products, right? But two, more importantly, I think that where crypto is going in the long run, 10 years from now is, you know, these centralized bridges that connected the crypto world to the real world.
00:18:33.615 - 00:19:29.839, Speaker A: Yes, they're going to exist and yes, they're going to be successful, but the vast majority of economic activities are going to move more and more towards the crypto native side. And that's where the opportunity is. That's just the natural trend of, that's just the natural state of things, right? Like more and more people are going to become more crypto native. And if you're new to crypto as a normal user, the first thing you're going to say is, how do I use this thing? And you're going to find your friend who is crypto native and you're going to ask their opinion on how to, how to do this, how to do this crypto thing. And they're going to tell you how they do things. And the way they do things is crypto native. They're going to install, they're going to ask you to install MetaMask and they're going to ask you to install like Phantom and then they're going to ask you to start using Defi in a fully self custodial way.
00:19:29.839 - 00:19:49.041, Speaker A: Right. Like those crypto native users have a lot of influence because they're perceived as being experts to their friends. So I think in general the really big opportunities to build crypto native products, of course this is case by case.
00:19:49.193 - 00:19:57.009, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd agree with that for a couple reasons. One is, you know, product market fit you're going to find from crypto data users generally.
00:19:57.057 - 00:19:57.241, Speaker D: Right.
00:19:57.273 - 00:20:31.155, Speaker B: You're not going to find product market fit from like retail users that has never used, that never opened up a wallet or like manage your own keys. And I think that is the biggest, I mean we may switch topics here a bit, but I think that's the biggest reason why we don't have a billion or a hundred million users in crypto today. It's primarily because of ui, UX and private key management. I still think that is the number one hurdle. It's been a number one hurdle since I got into crypto 2013, let's say 2016, when Ethereum started to take off. Right.
00:20:31.775 - 00:20:33.335, Speaker A: And it still thinks it's the biggest issue.
00:20:33.415 - 00:20:50.777, Speaker B: It hasn't been solved yet. Yeah, I still think it's crazy. I mean, I'll say this, the coolest innovation that came out recently was from Coinbase and I call it the NPC wallet where you split the keys and you give a partial key to the retail user and the rest is custody with Coinbase.
00:20:50.921 - 00:20:52.285, Speaker A: Have you tried the product?
00:20:52.785 - 00:21:18.795, Speaker B: I have not, but I should. But I think that is probably the best wallet experience for retail users. No one's going to buy a, like a cold store or cold wallet, cold storage wallet. And I mean people will, some, I don't say everyone will, but the average user, they just want to log in with their username and password or oauth authentication using like Google or something like that and call it a day.
00:21:18.875 - 00:21:19.427, Speaker D: Right.
00:21:19.571 - 00:21:29.875, Speaker B: They don't want to manage their keys, they don't want to get hacked, they don't want to be, they don't want to get phished, they just Want someone to trust key and then they get a partial key.
00:21:30.455 - 00:21:54.049, Speaker A: And also just, you know, if you're a new user, if you want to use a crypto native app and if you have to install MetaMask that is like, you know, at least five more clicks, like these things might now may not sound like a lot, but like five more clicks in order to get started is a lot of friction to get people onboarded, right?
00:21:54.217 - 00:22:36.019, Speaker B: Yep. I think extensions are the worst go to market strategy in the world. Yeah, like name me another. I mean like, obviously you had a couple that have become very successful and I think it's important, like having extension is important part of the app distribution game, but it shouldn't be the only app distribution game because, you know, like downloading extension, like I have like, I don't know, 25 extensions for every layer one, L2 that's out there or layer one that's out there, right? I don't think that's feasible. Like you need to have some sort of like extension aggregator or a wallet aggregator that aggregates all of this.
00:22:36.107 - 00:23:41.325, Speaker A: The smoke test that people used to talk about mostly as a joke is like, how long does it take for a new user to start using DeFi, for instance, right? Like if you go on the street and ask a random person who is not crypto native and ask them to take whatever steps that they need to get started with DeFi, how long would it take? And the answer is fucking days. Because first you have to open a Coinbase account, you go through all the kyc, all that stuff, right? And then you take like four days to whatever or whatever to get approved. Then you wire money from your bank account to Coinbase, Then you learn how to send crypto from Coinbase to somewhere else. But when you do that, you realize, holy shit, you don't have a MetaMask yet. So you go to Chrome, you search for MetaMask, install it, then you send crypto asset from coinbase to a MetaMask and finally you're ready to use DeFi. This whole process is extremely painful.
00:23:42.185 - 00:24:14.291, Speaker B: So check this out. So last bull market, I have a bunch of retail friends, they know I'm in crypto. I don't really talk to them about crypto because I try to keep it separate. Otherwise you get these random texts about what shitcoin too long and it's not something I like doing. But there was an interesting thing my friend told me. He said, we created a red pill group. So like a telegram chat of like all of my friends and there's like five of them.
00:24:14.323 - 00:24:14.659, Speaker D: Right.
00:24:14.747 - 00:24:38.197, Speaker B: And they teach each other how to use Metamask. I mean, they're creating like self help groups so that they could help each other to get them onboarded on Metamask and then like how to LP on Uniswap or how to like buy a shitcoin on Uniswap. I mean, we shouldn't, I mean that shouldn't happen to begin with.
00:24:38.301 - 00:24:38.733, Speaker D: Right.
00:24:38.829 - 00:24:49.765, Speaker B: This should be so simple and easy that you click a button and you're already interacting with crypto. So that tells you where we are in this kind of like long term user adoption.
00:24:49.845 - 00:24:50.465, Speaker D: Right.
00:24:51.485 - 00:25:08.329, Speaker A: By the way, I want to touch on the Solana Phone a little bit. I know this is from a long time ago, but because we were talking about wallets and npc, I think this, the Solana Phone is probably an alternative to that.
00:25:08.457 - 00:25:30.857, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, if you haven't heard our last podcast, ultimately what I think the key innovation with Solana Phone is the secure enclave that supports private key management. And so the beauty behind this is that for the average user you could log in once and ultimately your signed in with every DAP that's out there.
00:25:30.921 - 00:25:31.217, Speaker D: Right.
00:25:31.281 - 00:26:11.469, Speaker B: So your private key is managed directly by your secure enclave, which is on your phone. And ultimately you can interact like if you're interacting with your apps today on your iPhone, which is really cool. Yeah. The second is, you know, getting your app on the App Store is actually a pain in the ass. Luckily we helped Stepan, or Stepan went through our program and they were able to figure out a way to do it, uh, through our, you know, programming and through some of the key experts that we brought in. But ultimately it's hard for every, every founder and so being able to get listed on the App Store and not having to pay like crazy fees, that's up to 30% is another important reason why I think Solana Phone's there.
00:26:11.597 - 00:26:17.877, Speaker A: Yeah, I, I mean you're spot on with respect to these two main value propositions of the Solana Phone.
00:26:17.941 - 00:26:18.525, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:18.685 - 00:26:27.495, Speaker A: Like the, the w. With respect to key management, I almost think of the Solana Phone as a hardware wallet with phone capabilities.
00:26:27.795 - 00:26:28.535, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:29.235 - 00:26:47.255, Speaker A: So you don't have to go through the, the, you know, 10,000 steps to get started with defi or anything else. Right. Like all you need to do is to buy a phone which you can use for a bunch of other purposes. But as soon as you get the phone, you're able to get started.
00:26:47.555 - 00:27:53.429, Speaker B: During that announcement, I remember, and this kind of touches on, I think mass adoption was the X nft Backdoor release from the, from I think Armani, who used to work at Solana Labs left to start this. I think it's a really cool moonshot bet that if it was to take off, it'll do really, really well. And it solves a lot of the problems that we talked about, which is ultimately creating uniformity across all apps, right? So using the XNFT standard, you can ultimately create the standardization across all apps or on all layer ones. And so really that's like one cool thing about XNFT Backdoor. The other is that it's like a super app wallet model, which is very interesting today. Wallets are really about managing your capital, right? Like how do you send money, how do you receive money, how do you store money, which is important. But the product UI UX shouldn't be built around that use case.
00:27:53.429 - 00:28:39.551, Speaker B: It should really be built around the use case of how do you, how do, how to use an app in crypto. And, and so it really changes the way you look at a wallet, right? When you look at like traditional wallets, it's about managing capital. X nft Backdoor or Backdoor specifically changes that view to how do you use crypto apps today? Easily. And I think that's a big change fundamentally. So what Backdoor does ultimately is it creates uniformity across all apps, across all layer ones and creates this one major distribution channel which is this app. And then number two is it manages your private keys, right? So you don't have to worry about storing your keys anywhere. It obfuscates that key hurdle.
00:28:39.551 - 00:29:03.435, Speaker B: So ultimately you have this like super app looking model similar to like, I don't know, WeChat as an example. I download this once and then I could download apps within Backdoor and I don't have to worry if it's on Solana or Ethereum, it just works. And I think that's really cool. I think that could solve a lot of our hurdles today. I'm curious on your thoughts on that.
00:29:03.865 - 00:29:55.815, Speaker A: I mean I use WeChat so I fully appreciate the super app thesis, which is that this is the only app you need. You can just live your entire life in this app, your entire digital life in this app. You don't have to go to any other app, right? And so that removes a lot of friction from the user to constantly switch from one app to another to install the and from wallets to the app itself. Like this really changes the paradigm. And from the startup's point of view, it's also really massive because if you look at the history of Metamask, basically, for the first three, four years, they did not care about monetization at all. All they did was to build a wallet that people had to use. There was no other like really meaningful alternatives.
00:29:55.815 - 00:30:39.135, Speaker A: And all they focused on was growth, was acquiring users instead of monetization. And at some point in I can't remember if it was 2020 or 2021, they noticed how much money Defi was making, especially Uniswap, right? The trading, the decentralized exchanges were doing extremely well. And so they basically built decentralized dec. Decentralized exchanges within the browser extension. Like as a user, you don't have to sign into MetaMask, go to uniswap.org, click on App, then start trading. All you need to do is to open the browser extension and start trading within it.
00:30:39.675 - 00:30:40.415, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:40.955 - 00:31:10.849, Speaker A: And so a lot of people really just prefer using that functionality instead of using a third party decentralized exchange, even if the price is 10, 20 more basis points, because MetaMask has to charge a little bit of fee to make money. So a lot of people prefer that user experience. And so that year Metamask made something like nine figures just from that one feature.
00:31:10.937 - 00:31:11.761, Speaker B: That's insane.
00:31:11.833 - 00:31:27.645, Speaker A: Absolutely insane. And so I think a lot of wallets are realizing this. I think you brought up this point recently about what was it? Uniswap and some others who wanted to build their own wallets, what was it?
00:31:28.745 - 00:31:55.611, Speaker B: So Uniswap, obviously it's very public on Twitter that Uniswap was trying to actually acquire Rainbow and the founder of Rainbow ended up pushing back and saying no. And so they're setting out to build out their own wallet. Magic Eden recently and didn't announce, but through GitHub, one of the GitHub repositories came up that Magic Eden is also coming up with the wallet.
00:31:55.683 - 00:32:24.865, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, so like this wallet is the epitome of aggregation theory. Like Wallet is the final line, the most direct line of communication between the user and the app. And so they have so much power against everything else that's built behind it. All the other, all the other apps that are built behind it are subject to the will of the wallet.
00:32:26.325 - 00:33:03.477, Speaker B: So it seems like it's inevitable that every wallet is going to become a super app. And that is the end state for crypto. If you look at Uniswap, they, they have probably the most liquid, decentralized exchange on the planet. They just acquired Genie, which essentially allows you to tap into every NFT market. That's out there. I mean you could argue that they could. I'm not saying this could happen technically, but they could acquire a perp exchange.
00:33:03.581 - 00:33:03.989, Speaker D: Right.
00:33:04.077 - 00:33:11.215, Speaker B: And then they could ultimately create. So they have this wallet which is all of customers assets, that's custody.
00:33:11.335 - 00:33:11.995, Speaker D: Right.
00:33:12.775 - 00:33:23.887, Speaker B: And then you could do something like a cross margin that allows you to use that collateral against all of those products and create like a very seamless like capital efficient wallet.
00:33:23.951 - 00:33:24.391, Speaker D: Right.
00:33:24.503 - 00:33:29.031, Speaker B: I'm not saying this could happen, but I feel like that's where it's all going.
00:33:29.183 - 00:33:36.825, Speaker A: Yep, possible. It's certainly one of the, one of the. One of my strongest thesis.
00:33:36.985 - 00:33:37.689, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:37.857 - 00:33:47.925, Speaker A: I want to switch gears a little bit, Imran, and to talk about the elephant in the room, which is the ETH merge.
00:33:48.385 - 00:33:49.525, Speaker B: Oh yeah.
00:33:50.745 - 00:33:54.165, Speaker A: What are your thoughts? Any thoughts?
00:33:55.065 - 00:34:43.157, Speaker B: I mean, there's so many thoughts. I mean, let's start with the basics, right. Eth2 is ultimately a new transition from going from proof of work to proof of stake. Previously when the E2 white paper was written, it was primarily scaling through sharding, which is it would have 64 data shards. And shards are ultimately, you could think of them as like mini databases. And the reason why it's created that way is so that apps could scale exponentially when they're building, so they don't have to compete for block space. But they transitioned to a different model most recently which is scaling through roll ups.
00:34:43.157 - 00:34:58.168, Speaker B: And so they. And so now the white paper has rewritten it's scaling strategy to include like roll ups as a way to primarily scale, which I think is very interesting and probably very smart.
00:34:58.336 - 00:35:05.324, Speaker A: And the proof of stake is a prerequisite for more roll ups, is that right?
00:35:06.024 - 00:35:12.560, Speaker B: That's right. And so that's kind of like the high level there.
00:35:12.592 - 00:35:12.928, Speaker D: Right.
00:35:13.016 - 00:35:50.089, Speaker B: And so a lot of the community members are very excited about the merge because it ultimately solves the biggest problem, at least in the Ethereum community, which is competing for block space. Because right now every app that's out there is competing for block space. Obviously now you have roll ups and roll ups are making it much easier. But what's ultimately happening even with roll ups is that you're still competing with block space. It's just happening in a much more granular way. Right. Versus more generalized on, on a monolithic layer one.
00:35:50.089 - 00:36:05.041, Speaker B: And so that will continue to happen, right. I mean the more developers you get, you're just going to continue to compete with block space just on different roll ups. And so. But I think what's going to end up happening is we're just Going to have so many roll ups.
00:36:05.113 - 00:36:05.537, Speaker D: Right.
00:36:05.641 - 00:36:38.951, Speaker B: And I think we will scale that way. But the merge is. So talk a little bit about the merge. I think about a week ago the Ethereum foundation announced that the merge is confirmed for September 15th and people, you know there's a small community that thinks that it's not going to happen. They think there's a 4% chance that it will fail and which is priced.
00:36:38.983 - 00:36:42.875, Speaker A: By the staked ETH versus a discount to eth.
00:36:43.225 - 00:36:48.537, Speaker B: That's right. So they're like shorting futures, quarterlies Sorry.
00:36:48.641 - 00:37:04.785, Speaker A: It'S priced by the backwardation of futures. That's right because the trade is if you long the ETH spot right now and short the ETH future then after the merge you're going to get eth proof of stake and ETH proof of work, right?
00:37:04.825 - 00:37:05.473, Speaker B: That's right.
00:37:05.609 - 00:37:17.925, Speaker A: And so there's so much demand for this trade that the futures is now trading at a discount to eth spot around 4% or something like that. So that's how they got the number of 4% probability.
00:37:19.345 - 00:38:03.799, Speaker B: That's right. And so there's a community that think I would say necessarily rooting for it but they're challenging people's bull biases which I think should be. It should be right because if we've learned from our mistakes with all the other blow ups that happened in the past the best thing that we can all do is have a very neutral state of how things are going to go. So I think that's important. So there is a chance it could fail and there's nothing wrong with that. It may take another push forward but it'll happen eventually. So right now this whole rally up from now to September 15th or it's from July to September 15th will be primarily based on the proof of work to proof of stake changeover.
00:38:03.927 - 00:38:11.285, Speaker A: What's your prediction on how the market will turn out pre merge and post merge?
00:38:12.065 - 00:38:13.121, Speaker B: In what sense?
00:38:13.273 - 00:38:14.125, Speaker A: Price action.
00:38:14.505 - 00:38:15.657, Speaker B: Oh price action.
00:38:15.761 - 00:38:16.765, Speaker A: Up or down.
00:38:19.265 - 00:38:59.113, Speaker B: You know like up. I mean even though like I could be wrong on this by the way, I'm definitely wrong on this but I mean even though everyone knows that you know like it's publicly known and you could argue like efficient hypothesis, efficient market hypothesis thesis or whatever so that everyone knows so fundamentally it's going to go down or whatever the reverse is going to happen. Yes and no Because I think the argument also is that there's just so much stable coins or dry powder because of the crash that's happened and so most funds haven't allocated or are Starting to allocate now.
00:38:59.209 - 00:39:06.375, Speaker A: Is that true? I think everyone is positioned for the merge. Every single one of them. Everyone.
00:39:07.275 - 00:39:18.083, Speaker B: As long as everyone 100%. Will we have some like fake outs? Probably. But if it goes through, I mean, that has to be bullish. I mean.
00:39:18.179 - 00:39:58.053, Speaker A: Yeah. I'll tell you what I think. I think it's actually going to go down because it's going to go down until the merge. And that makes sense. A few months after the merge, there will be a lot of institutional interest to buy eth and I'll expand on both. So pre merge, I think every single person I've talked to thinks that ETH is going to go up until the merge. I think when you have this consensus of a view, you're going to get punished.
00:39:58.053 - 00:41:07.837, Speaker A: And the reason why I think this consensus view has a good chance to be wrong is because everyone who bought eth, let's say a month ago and are definitely making definitely generate a lot of return up until now thought that the, the rally was because of the ETH merge. In. In actuality, it's not true. The rally was actually because of the S&P 500 going from like 3700 to right now, which is like 4200, like almost 10, 15%. It's actually a rally in the, in the traditional markets that is pushing crypto markets up. Obviously, ETH has gone up a lot more than bitcoin because of the merge, but directionally it's really because of the strength in traditional stock markets. And the thing that a lot of people don't understand is it's not the narrative that creates price action, it's price action that creates the narrative.
00:41:07.837 - 00:41:19.263, Speaker A: If you actually analyze the historical data, pre important events, like whether it's, you know, 1559 upgrade or Bitcoin fork or whatever.
00:41:19.399 - 00:41:19.983, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:20.119 - 00:41:34.743, Speaker A: There's nothing that says that the pump needs to happen two months before the scheduled event. Like it could easily be a week before, which is what actually happened with 1559, by the way.
00:41:34.919 - 00:41:35.455, Speaker B: Yep.
00:41:35.535 - 00:42:03.417, Speaker A: So why did the price go up? Started going up two months before the scheduled event. It's not a narrative. It's the price action. It's the price action that creates the narrative. Because the price went up, people thought, oh, this is because of the merge. So why do I think that the ETH has a good chance to go down from now till the merge? 1, because everyone is positioned for the merge.
00:42:03.481 - 00:42:04.063, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:04.209 - 00:42:59.075, Speaker A: Um, and two, I think that the dead cat balance in traditional stock markets has gone to a point where it's actually shortable now. I think over the next 6-12-12ths and P is going down. Very good chance. And the rally over the last two months or over the last month or so has been the bear market rally and it's shortable now. So I think there is a good chance that ETH is going down. So that was the first half of my argument. The second half, why do I think that ETH are going to go up after the merge is because ETH has three narratives that institutions absolutely love and they're going to pile into ETH after they've gain confidence that the merge has worked.
00:42:59.075 - 00:43:29.879, Speaker A: Okay. And the three narratives are number one, the most basic one, meaning Ethereum is a tech platform, whereas Bitcoin is a borrowing digital gold. Institutions, after 10 years of bull market in tech, they've basically rallied around this new narrative of a tech platform. They love that kind of stuff. That's number one. Number two is the yield. In a world where real interest rate is negative, where do you get the yield?
00:43:30.007 - 00:43:30.631, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:30.783 - 00:43:34.115, Speaker A: You get the yield by staking your eth.
00:43:34.615 - 00:43:35.355, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:35.655 - 00:43:56.095, Speaker A: Basically after the merge, ETH becomes a yield generating asset. Now technically pedantically, whether or not that's true is a different story. But that is the meme, right. People believe in the meme of a yield generating asset. And three, unfortunately is esg. Yeah, proof of work. Unfortunately, people don't like that.
00:43:56.095 - 00:44:21.155, Speaker A: People don't like the climate impact, which by the way is actually really debatable. But I'm not going to get into the debate right now. But proof of stake again as a meme is a lot more climate friendly. So for these three reasons I think there will be a lot more institutional interest after the merge relative to let's say bitcoin or the rest of crypto market.
00:44:22.495 - 00:44:39.063, Speaker B: Yeah, So I would get dumped on. That makes sense, but No, I think it makes a lot of sense. It reminds me of bitcoin and Bitcoin cash fork, if you remember that.
00:44:39.159 - 00:44:39.879, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:44:40.047 - 00:44:52.505, Speaker A: And by the way, the short futures long spot trade is not a new trade. Like this trade has been done every single time there was a fork. Like in 2017 this trade was done with a bitcoin fork, right?
00:44:52.545 - 00:44:53.205, Speaker D: Yep.
00:44:53.945 - 00:45:07.765, Speaker A: And some exchanges mishandled the distribution of and people who put on this trade, a lot of them got fucked by some exchanges. So it will be interesting to see how exchanges handle the Ford this time.
00:45:08.585 - 00:45:26.195, Speaker B: Well, Barry did it right back in 2017 which I was holding GBTC and they ended up distributing proceeds from bitcoin cash in cash distribution, which was great.
00:45:26.535 - 00:45:41.155, Speaker A: The More difficult question is these derivative exchanges, how are they going to mark their price? How are they going to settle their futures price? Is it based on the one of the forks? If so, which fork? Or is it based on the sum of the two prices?
00:45:41.905 - 00:45:42.945, Speaker B: Right, yeah.
00:45:43.065 - 00:45:47.105, Speaker A: And that can really fuck up a lot of, a lot of those.
00:45:47.225 - 00:45:54.765, Speaker B: I almost feel like they have to stop. They have to have some sort of like expiry date or something. I don't know, like they got to stop and restart the market again. Yeah.
00:45:55.785 - 00:46:17.983, Speaker A: By the way, like from, from. I don't want a virtual signal but from a moral point of view, like the, this whole ETH PAL stuff is a huge waste of time. It's a huge distraction, all of it. We don't need this stuff. Look, I get it, like the miners need to make money. They, you know, they've been treated as more or less a second class citizen by, you know, the devs for, for the past two years and they want.
00:46:18.039 - 00:46:19.287, Speaker B: Billions of dollars in revenue.
00:46:19.391 - 00:46:38.875, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Like, I mean they want to create a narrative and so they can juice out the final, you know, bit of money from, from the proof of work network. But from, from an industry point of view, like this is a huge distraction. We don't need this stuff. Just give people ETH proof of stake and be done with it.
00:46:39.245 - 00:46:52.125, Speaker B: No, no, I mean like, I guess let's push this further. You know, there's this narrative where ETC could become the main proof of work chain now for all the miners that want to move over.
00:46:52.205 - 00:46:52.565, Speaker D: Right.
00:46:52.645 - 00:47:04.269, Speaker B: There's a narrative behind that. There's also a narrative of taking the legacy ETH1 and continuing to fork and creating the community that's behind that and hoping that developers will stay back.
00:47:04.357 - 00:47:04.985, Speaker D: Right.
00:47:06.435 - 00:47:19.731, Speaker B: What do you think is going to end up happening? I mean, I think what's going to end up happening is similar to all the other forks. Right. Which is they'll just fork into irrelevance. But yeah, I'm curious, how do you think this is going to play out?
00:47:19.803 - 00:47:56.035, Speaker A: I think ETH proof of work fork will be more irrelevant than ETC in the long run because it's absolutely unnecessary. Back in the day, when the DAO hack happened in 2016 which led to the fork of Ethereum Classic and Ethereum, there was a real community of people who believed in immutability of Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is the immutable chain. Ethereum as we know it today is the chain that sort of reversed the change. Right.
00:47:56.155 - 00:47:57.307, Speaker B: You want to hear a funny story?
00:47:57.411 - 00:47:58.825, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead.
00:47:59.485 - 00:48:39.715, Speaker B: So when that happened I remember when the DAO hack happened because I had money in the DAO and Vitalik. I remember it was like the morning I woke up and Vitalik sent out like in caps lock, get your money out of the DAO now or something. And so I started freaking out and pulled up Cap. I pulled my money out, whatever sold I didn't stake. And Barry came out and he said, you know, we need to fork or the forked ETH is going to become the now immutable chain. And for some reason I thought Barry was signal back then. I mean, bear still signal, just very signal, institutional signal.
00:48:39.715 - 00:48:54.395, Speaker B: Right, But I mean even his signal is very interesting now. But let's just say back then. And so I ended up longing Ethereum Classic because of the whole immutable thesis.
00:48:55.095 - 00:48:57.555, Speaker A: How long did it take you to switch back to eth?
00:48:58.815 - 00:49:13.895, Speaker B: Couple months. I learned pretty quick. No, but even for that few months I ended up longing Ethereum Classic. And the whole immutable thesis makes a lot of sense, right? Yeah, but yeah, it was just a funny story.
00:49:14.055 - 00:49:28.775, Speaker A: Yeah. The way I handled it, if I remember correctly, I didn't touch either forks. I just didn't know what was going to happen. And eventually in 2017, I sold the ETC fork.
00:49:29.835 - 00:49:33.835, Speaker B: Probably the right move. The best thing to do is just don't touch a shit.
00:49:33.915 - 00:49:34.627, Speaker A: Yeah, just don't touch.
00:49:34.691 - 00:49:48.091, Speaker B: Let it go. Just let it go. I just saw a tweet yesterday of some Ethereum whale that bought $1.6 million in the Ethereum ICO that just started to move their wallet around and had like $300 million.
00:49:48.163 - 00:49:48.467, Speaker D: Right.
00:49:48.531 - 00:49:58.455, Speaker B: Like six years later or five years later. Yeah, if you have crypto, just don't touch it. I mean, if it's shitcoin, it's probably going to go down. Just keep it in like high quality blue chip assets. Come back five years from now.
00:49:59.075 - 00:50:36.195, Speaker A: I'll just finish the point about if POW is going to become more irrelevant than etc. The short explanation is that ETC had a real community of people who believed in that immutability. And ETH PAL is absolutely unnecessary. Like, and even, even the hardware that the miners are using, they can be repurposed to something else. Right? Like for machine learning or mining some other, you know, you know, GPU minable shit coins or whatever. Right. Like the ETH pal will probably become more like bitcoin gold or something.
00:50:36.195 - 00:50:38.547, Speaker A: Bitcoin diamond. Like it's.
00:50:38.611 - 00:50:40.207, Speaker B: Oh God. You said diamond.
00:50:40.331 - 00:50:56.199, Speaker A: Bitcoin died. Back in the day there were like 10 different bitcoin forks, but bitcoin are extremely unnecessary bitcoin forks. But bitcoin gold was the biggest example. And bitcoin gold is probably trading still in the top 200 or something if.
00:50:56.207 - 00:50:57.527, Speaker B: I had to get it, man.
00:50:57.711 - 00:51:05.835, Speaker A: So if PAL is probably going to be like that, extremely irrelevant, but trading at a ridiculously high valuation.
00:51:06.425 - 00:52:12.769, Speaker B: I mean it's crazy how many of the forks are still very liquid from bitcoin. And then I guess there's this whole market cyclical issues with proof of work, right? Which is you have, let's look at bitcoin as an example, right? When miners are profitable and there's this just like re, like positive, like, like cyclical action, right? So let's say we're in a like a bull market. You know, miners are profitable. People that are holding bitcoin is profit, they're profitable and everyone is very happy. But obviously in a bear market it, it's a complete reverse effect, right? So the most unprofitable miners end up selling their equipment and like liquidating and calling it a day, right. Where the more powerful miners are going to continue to hold power and double down. I feel like this has to either become very centralizing a certain point or it's just going to turn out to be very bad in the long run.
00:52:12.769 - 00:53:12.489, Speaker B: So I guess I'm curious on what do you think is the long term effects of proof of work and proof of stake? I feel like proof of stake, long term it's very easily manageable. You just got to hold 32E, you stake it and you're contributing to the security of Ethereum too, right? Whereas with proof of work you gotta have, I don't know, billions of dollars, right? You gotta have very cheap energy and it's probably need to get cheaper based on what's happening to the geopolitical issues with gas and all of that today. And so it's gonna be for miners, it's gonna become very political and it's gonna become very hard for them to offer cheap equipment, purchase cheap equipment and continue to operate in the space to contribute to the security for bitcoin. So I guess this is going to probably be addressed someday. What do you think is going to happen? Do you think the bitcoin community is ever going to think about going and transitioning off emir?
00:53:12.537 - 00:53:15.593, Speaker A: I don't want to get into the proof of work versus proof of stake debate.
00:53:15.649 - 00:53:25.651, Speaker B: Yeah, we shouldn't get into that. I mean I see these battles all the time. Um, but, but I'll, I'll share one.
00:53:25.683 - 00:53:36.939, Speaker A: One interesting insight that, that I saw on Twitter Um, I think the insight was it was something like this. So in proof of work or by the way, this touches on the tornado cash event.
00:53:36.987 - 00:53:37.195, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:53:37.235 - 00:53:38.203, Speaker B: Okay, this is perfect.
00:53:38.259 - 00:54:20.701, Speaker A: Uh, so, so when, when, when there's a transaction that the MINER or the staker does not want to include because they want to be OFAC compliant, what happens? The proof of work miner, they can just not include the transaction and still be okay. I mean the network might say, okay, we're going to fork, we're not going to attest to this transaction that's missing, but the miner is okay. But in proof of stake, if you don't include a transaction and the stakers, the rest of the network disagrees with you, you're going to get slashed.
00:54:20.853 - 00:54:21.625, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:22.005 - 00:54:41.125, Speaker A: So it's actually a violation of the network rules. So I don't know how stakers are going to react, are going to act in a world where some transactions cannot be included because of the OFAC sanctions.
00:54:41.245 - 00:54:41.837, Speaker C: Right.
00:54:41.981 - 00:54:44.785, Speaker A: So this is a really interesting scenario to think about.
00:54:45.585 - 00:54:55.165, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. We'll see where the Bitcoin community is a couple years from now because it seems like everyone's left and a lot of thought leaders that were there that was pushing the narrative.
00:54:56.825 - 00:55:32.915, Speaker A: Again, going back to that example, Bitcoin doesn't do much right. As a network, it's a store of value. But a lot of people think of that as a, as a disadvantage of Bitcoin. In actuality, it might be a real advantage. The simplicity of Bitcoin might be an advantage because it does not depend on other stuff like turn out cash or defi all these things that the government may not like. Right.
00:55:34.455 - 00:55:37.925, Speaker B: It's a hedge against Ethereum and all of the innovation that's happening.
00:55:38.015 - 00:55:38.725, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:55:39.025 - 00:55:53.689, Speaker A: So I just think, you know, if you're, if you're a long term holder and you need to store your wealth in a uncensorable network crypto asset, you want to hold both, you want to hold Bitcoin and Ethereum, they're just too different from each other.
00:55:53.857 - 00:56:02.841, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. Well, it's, it's been good chatting. Ciao. Um, thanks everyone.
00:56:02.953 - 00:56:03.845, Speaker A: Thanks everyone.
00:56:04.145 - 00:56:07.865, Speaker B: Thanks for listening to Good Game. Don't forget to subscribe. We'll see you next week.
