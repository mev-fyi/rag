00:00:00.120 - 00:00:17.350, Speaker B: The problem with music nfts is that the audio stuff, unlike the visual stuff, it's very hard to go viral, right? Like when you buy a punk, you hold a punk, you put that as your PFP on your Twitter profile. It goes viral very quickly. Music is much harder to go viral just because of the format of the file.
00:00:17.422 - 00:00:45.174, Speaker A: Yep, I'd agree with that. So it could be special limited edition music where super fans are very excited and will gladly spend $100 for that song. And this gives them a sense of community with other super fans, right? That will then give them maybe special access to events. So if, let's say this singer comes, a rapper comes into your town, you get special access to that person, right? Anyone that's Superman would love to pay for that experience.
00:00:45.294 - 00:00:53.798, Speaker B: So it's almost access token rather than music NfT like you turn the NFT into access token, access to the celebrity itself.
00:00:53.926 - 00:00:54.334, Speaker A: That's right.
