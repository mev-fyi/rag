00:00:00.170 - 00:00:33.970, Speaker A: I find it fascinating because it reminds me of what I think Cosmos will be going in the long run, is that I think on Ethereum, the rollups will specialize over time. That's right. Matter of fact, there could even be roll ups that are dedicated to a single application in the long run, which is the whole idea behind Cosmos. So my mental model is that Ethereum roll in the long run, will be actually competing more closely with Cosmos and the hubs, specifically. And the hubs, yeah, for specialization.
