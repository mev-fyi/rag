00:00:00.320 - 00:00:01.854, Speaker A: Why do wallets matter?
00:00:01.974 - 00:00:02.430, Speaker B: Yep.
00:00:02.502 - 00:00:05.014, Speaker A: What do you think? Why is this such an important topic?
00:00:05.094 - 00:00:38.334, Speaker B: It's the gateway for crypto. It's a great way to using crypto apps. Like for me, when I first started interacting with crypto, I needed to use my hardware wallet, or some paper wallet, or even like a private key that would have written somewhere and I would need it every time I would interact with crypto. And if we want to think about getting a billing users or x amount of users into crypto, we have to fundamentally understand where we are in the landscape. What can founders work on to improve the ecosystem and bring a ten x UI UX experience so that we can get more and more people using crypto apps today?
