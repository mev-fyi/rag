00:00:00.160 - 00:00:18.094, Speaker A: We're starting to see, like, pretty serious players are coming into space now. That remind me very similar of, like, my days at Microsoft, where you had these, like, enterprise software that was very, very, like, enterprise focused that were solving, like, real world commercial use cases. Is that the same for crypto data today, or are we still very early?
00:00:18.174 - 00:00:29.814, Speaker B: I think we're extremely, extremely early. And obviously, there's a lot of enterprise players. But my gut feeling, my hunch is the entire field is wide open. No one has won it yet, including June.
