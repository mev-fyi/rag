00:00:00.250 - 00:00:31.940, Speaker A: Why do I think that the east has a good chance to go down from now till the merge? One, because everyone is positioned for the merge. Yeah. And two, I think that dead cap balance in traditional stock markets has gone to a point where it's actually shortable now. I think over the next six to twelve months S and P is going down. Very good chance it's going down. And the rally over the last two months or over the last month or so has been a bear market rally and it's shortable now. So I think there is a good chance that it's going down.
