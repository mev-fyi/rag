00:00:00.170 - 00:00:12.602, Speaker B: There's something unique about Salana culture. Is it just the tech, or is it also the culture about Salana devs that makes it more likely for meme coins to take off on Salana? Because all the meme coins are taking off on Salana.
00:00:12.666 - 00:00:50.206, Speaker A: It's a very good question. I see it just like this 2020, 2021 punks launched on Ethereum, and that kind of became the canonical NFT chain, right? Similarly, same thing with meme coins, right? Like, whether it's wif or some of the other earlier meme coins on Solana has become the canonical meme coin chain. And I think it's just going to continue to proliferate on Solana just because it had so many big winners already. And there's a lot of liquidity that is stuck on Solana. Obviously. Like, as you mentioned, speed fees for retail is very friendly. Like, all the friends I talked to when I told them to buy, et cetera, when they made the purchase is.
00:00:50.206 - 00:00:59.210, Speaker A: They call me, they're like, yo, why is it so cheap? They asked me why it was so cheap with the gas fees. I'm like, that's Solana, right? It's supposed to be cheap.
