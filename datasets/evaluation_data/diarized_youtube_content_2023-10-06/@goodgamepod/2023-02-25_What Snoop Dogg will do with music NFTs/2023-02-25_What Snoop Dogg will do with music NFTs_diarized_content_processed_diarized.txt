00:00:00.160 - 00:00:29.198, Speaker A: Here's a fun, interesting story. Snoop Dogg bought death Row records. If you know death Row records, it's one of the oldest record companies in rap, and Snoop Dogg recently purchased it and he pulled it from Spotify. He pulled it out of Spotify and he said that he's going to create nfts around it. Interesting is what he said. So I don't know what that means and how he's gonna do it, but he has dropped music on Sound XYZ before. Oh, interesting.
00:00:29.198 - 00:00:44.494, Speaker A: Yeah. So I don't know what he's thinking. I try to, like, do more research, but he was very, like, quiet about what he was thinking about doing with it. So I guess we have to wait and see of what's gonna happen with that. But he did mention, like, money was the biggest reason why he pulled it from Spotify.
