00:01:42.765 - 00:02:27.037, Speaker C: Introducing Minimum Viable Product by Alliance MVP is an IRL hackathon at the alliance headquarters in Soho, NYC. Go from idea to MVP in two weeks. Step 1 Register. Apply solo or with a co founder with a clear product in mind to bring to MVP. Feel free to build anything on any chain. Compete 20 teams will be accepted where they'll receive hands on guidance from the alliance team and other industry leaders. Step 3 Win.
00:02:27.037 - 00:02:40.145, Speaker C: Pitch our judges and the team who comes out on top will win an immediate entry into the next alliance cohort and take home the title of mvp. Sign up today and prove that you're the real mvp.
00:02:41.725 - 00:03:01.259, Speaker A: So we just announced MVP by Alliance which also stands for minimal viable product. And the reason why I think this new product that we're launching is quite interesting compared to typical hackathons is that a lot of the hackathons that I've joined are, you know, just people that are excited about trying new things and.
00:03:01.307 - 00:03:02.779, Speaker B: Make a little bit of money and.
00:03:02.787 - 00:04:07.395, Speaker A: Make a bit of money right from bounties and things like that, maybe some status, prestige for winning the hackathon. But it's very rare that you see companies that come out of there. And I do think this process is a bit broken. Meaning like I think a hackathon should always exist. I think they're an incredible place for developers to come in and try out new things. But what if there was a hackathon that kind of pushed the edge or pushed the developers to build something that could change the world? And that's kind of the concept of minimal viable product or MVP by Alliance, which is a more of a hackathon that's geared towards people that want to become founders, by founders for founders and Our tagline is take an idea to MVP in two weeks. And the fun part about this chow is that you and I get to work with the founders hand in hand over a course of two weeks in real life to help shape the ideas and help founders or would be founders to come up with a product that can really enable new use cases in crypto.
00:04:07.395 - 00:04:09.171, Speaker A: What's exciting about this for you?
00:04:09.243 - 00:04:21.859, Speaker B: I just love working with founders in person. It's just a really magical experience as opposed to chatting on Telegram and then doing zoom. The in person experience just cannot be replaced.
00:04:21.987 - 00:04:56.415, Speaker A: So the program starts May 20th till May 31st and you get to work with us. Within the alliance office, we are only picking 20 to 25 teams or individuals and the goal is to get to product market fit it within those two weeks. And so for those that are excited about this, feel free to hit up MVP alliance xyz. And yeah, we'll see you there. Welcome to Good Game. Today we're going to be talking about if it's over or not, the market. I signed on to Twitter today and it was death.
00:04:56.415 - 00:05:07.151, Speaker A: I signed on to Twitter yesterday, it was death. I signed onto Twitter a week ago was death. And the way the market makes it, at least what the timeline makes it seem like it's over. What do you think, Chao?
00:05:07.223 - 00:05:12.407, Speaker B: I've never seen a cycle end with this much FUD on the timeline. Have you seen any?
00:05:12.551 - 00:05:35.043, Speaker A: No, I actually haven't. So I'm just curious as to why the market, or at least Twitter thinks that it's over. And I think it's maybe partly due to over indexing on the ETF inflows. Partly as soon as it turned zero, the market went to zero. You could just tell there was no excitement for crypto whatsoever.
00:05:35.179 - 00:05:45.851, Speaker B: Yeah, I thought the correction that we're seeing right now on bitcoin right now we corrected what, 25% and that's very typical of the bull market correction, right?
00:05:45.923 - 00:05:47.555, Speaker A: Yeah. It just hit 57,000.
00:05:47.715 - 00:05:48.355, Speaker B: Okay.
00:05:48.475 - 00:05:50.707, Speaker A: Probably. I think you go to 50.
00:05:50.851 - 00:06:12.809, Speaker B: So what I think what happened was bitcoin just overshot. We went straight from like 30k all the way to 73. Right. It was just overextended. And so now we're just correcting. Clearly lost the momentum when the ETF inflow stopped and now we're just correcting.
00:06:12.937 - 00:06:42.327, Speaker A: Well, there's a lot of talks about why it's over. One is, as I mentioned, ETF inflows. Two is no new narratives that are coming there that are emerging yet all the narratives that we've seen have already played out. So if you think about Solana becoming the retail chain, it is now kind of taken that narrative and it's fully formed now. Base. I don't see anything new coming out of base. Ordinals.
00:06:42.327 - 00:07:00.075, Speaker A: Ordinals played out, runes played out. Everyone thought that, including myself, thought runes was going to be a spectacular bang. And I think I know why some of those issues led to where it led to. And we can talk through that. But what else? What else do we have going on?
00:07:00.115 - 00:07:19.305, Speaker B: Maybe all these things that quote unquote played out were a result of the bitcoin consolidating or correcting. If bitcoin stays at around 70k and consolidating, then all these narratives should be doing fine.
00:07:19.425 - 00:07:26.353, Speaker A: Okay, so I guess maybe looking forward, how do we think the market is going to play out in your mind?
00:07:26.449 - 00:07:57.205, Speaker B: I have no idea. What do you think my base case is? We're going to consolidate for a couple of months. Look, so far we're not seeing a 30% correction yet. So even today at 57, at 56, the correction from the top was like 25%. But typically in a bull market, we should see a 30%, even 40% correction. So this is entirely normal. And so I would not be surprised that we just hang out between 50 and 70 for the upcoming months.
00:07:57.205 - 00:08:50.167, Speaker B: Yeah, and I don't see any strong reason why the cycle is over. In the grand scheme of things, the cycle is always driven by liquidity, by global liquidity. So, for example, if you chart Bitcoin with the stock market S&P 500, it's virtually the same chart. Actually, if you chart Bitcoin with the semiconductor etf, which has been the leader of the stock market so far, it's basically the same chart. And all these different markets are actually both driven by the same underlying factor, which is the global liquidity. And as long as the economy is doing fine and the Fed is not hiking rates or doing a ton of quantitative tightening, the liquidity should expand from here. And as a result, all the risk markets, risk assets, should do okay.
00:08:50.167 - 00:08:55.039, Speaker B: And I'm talking about a time horizon of a few months to maybe 12, 18 months.
00:08:55.167 - 00:08:56.775, Speaker A: We do have the upcoming election.
00:08:56.935 - 00:09:01.825, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's the other factor. The left will not let the market crash.
00:09:01.985 - 00:09:19.465, Speaker A: Exactly. So I do think we'll get a curve ball here in the next couple months. I feel that this is typical after maybe being in the market for a while. Now, typically after tax day, markets either chop or go down till summer. And then around summer time, the tax.
00:09:19.505 - 00:09:36.831, Speaker B: Thing is Actually another good factor because last year we've been basically been up only and people probably made a lot of money and they needed to take some money off the table to pay taxes, which is why, in hindsight, the market actually topped around the tax day. That's a good point.
00:09:36.943 - 00:10:16.007, Speaker A: So I think between that and I don't know how much of the institutions really take summers off in crypto. I think between those two, the macro and the overextension, as you mentioned, I think all kind of played a part. All right, well, looking forward, there's some really interesting narratives that are coming around that I'm actually really excited about. One of which. Well, actually, let's talk about this. This is still pertaining to the markets, which is you sent a tweet out to a bunch of our courts that are building the RWA space around BlackRock's on chain fund, which hit 375 million. I'm curious why you shared it.
00:10:16.007 - 00:10:19.309, Speaker A: Also, where do you see this going moving forward?
00:10:19.437 - 00:10:50.235, Speaker B: I mean, I shared it with him because essentially I think there are two things that happened in the last month in the whole RW and stablecoin sector. One is the BlackRock Fund. One hundred million dollars. They started with a hundred million dollars and now they grew very quickly to 375 within a month or so. This basically instantly legitimized the whole RWA space. Like before, it was not, like people tell RWA before, it was not consensus. Especially the crypto purists.
00:10:50.235 - 00:11:16.479, Speaker B: Right? The crypto natives that are very purists, they didn't think RWAs were very interesting because it was not intellectually satisfying for them to put traditional assets on chain. But BlackRock basically legitimized the whole space. So that's one thing that I thought was very interesting. The other thing that happened was Stripe that started adopting stablecoin payments.
00:11:16.647 - 00:11:22.687, Speaker A: That's a big deal. I think the last time they had this was in 2018. Did you watch your video?
00:11:22.871 - 00:11:23.671, Speaker B: The demo?
00:11:23.783 - 00:11:42.971, Speaker A: The demo? He said a couple interesting. Like just a couple things that. That I think would be interesting for our audience. He insinuated that they did try this in 2018. It didn't work because it's too expensive. And he kept calling out how cheap the gas fees were and how quick it took to conduct a transaction. So he called out two things.
00:11:42.971 - 00:11:48.083, Speaker A: Speed, cost. And the demo was done on Solana.
00:11:48.259 - 00:11:57.563, Speaker B: I thought that was the most interesting part. Like, they supported Ethereum, Polygon, Polygon and Solana. And out of the three, he chose Solana to do the demo on.
00:11:57.659 - 00:12:10.869, Speaker A: And so we're starting to see what I call kind of like lightning in the bottom moments where I do think this is going to become more common moving forward. And this is driven by what people want ultimately, which is speed and cost reduction.
00:12:10.957 - 00:12:18.733, Speaker B: So they knew in 2018 that this thing was going to work at some point, but the tech was just not ready. But today they feel the tech is ready.
00:12:18.869 - 00:12:31.561, Speaker A: The tech, the narrative even, especially after, you know, if you look at what Solana has gone through over a period of, you know, congestion over a period of time, all the congestions and things like that, they remain resilient after that.
00:12:31.653 - 00:13:16.367, Speaker B: In hindsight, the fact that Stripe adopted stablecoin is not surprising to me at all because we see a ton of people in emerging markets in Africa and Latin America use Tron USDT for day to day payment, for cross border payment and for hedging as well. To me, the natural next step was for a quote unquote big startup like Stripe to adopt this technology. This is good. It's really good for the space because people have questioned what is the first non speculative use case of crypto. People have questioned this for 15 years and now we have one which is using USDC and USDT for payment. That's great. I think the stripe one not only legitimized stablecoin specifically, but also the whole space.
00:13:16.367 - 00:13:21.031, Speaker B: The non speculative, quote unquote real world use case of crypto. It was a big deal.
00:13:21.143 - 00:13:39.953, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know what the market's crying about. You have blackrock, one of the largest asset managers in the world that is doubling down on chain rwas with this tokenized fund. The other news is that they're hosting bitcoin investor events for.
00:13:40.009 - 00:14:05.593, Speaker B: But here's what's interesting about the public discourse around crypto, which is people don't care about the non speculative stuff. The speculative stuff is what leads to, to the discourse, to the conversations and the debates and the arguments. Like people are naturally driven by highly volatile assets and markets and whenever you like, stablecoin is not interesting to talk about because the price doesn't move well.
00:14:05.609 - 00:14:07.205, Speaker A: There'S no token attached to it.
00:14:07.585 - 00:14:19.325, Speaker B: There is a token, it doesn't move. Right. It's the same thing. It's a real use case. But you earn 5% per year from UST bills. No one talks about it. It doesn't mean it's not important.
00:14:19.325 - 00:14:30.715, Speaker B: Billions of dollars in T bills on chain today and there's trillions of dollars being transferred on chain on stablecoins. But people don't talk about that stuff because it's not volatile.
00:14:30.835 - 00:15:03.585, Speaker A: I do think RWAS and all the stuff that we're seeing with BlackRock, eventually people are one. I think it's just going to grow tremendously. There isn't enough intention to this because people don't realize how big this opportunity is. Everyone's thinking about ETF inflows. I think that's also a big deal. I'm not getting, don't get me wrong, but tokenizing treasuries, tokenizing securities, tokenizing real estate is actually a very big deal. And once we all realize how big the global demand for it is, we're going to start to see that shoot up like a hockey stick.
00:15:03.585 - 00:15:05.557, Speaker A: And I think people will get more bullish.
00:15:05.661 - 00:15:09.525, Speaker B: I actually drew an analogy between Bitcoin ETF and RWAs.
00:15:09.605 - 00:15:11.093, Speaker A: Oh, you did? Okay, go ahead.
00:15:11.149 - 00:15:38.401, Speaker B: So both are actually used for. The main value proposition of both the ETF and RWAs is diversification. The difference is the Bitcoin ETF is used for diversification by TradFi, whereas RWAs are used for diversification by on chain capital. So basically the Bitcoin ETF is to tradify what RWAS is to on chain capital. It's the exact same purpose just for different user segments.
00:15:38.553 - 00:16:01.813, Speaker A: So. All right, let's. Let's play some numbers here. I remember before Defi Summer we were sitting maybe around 250 million, maybe 500 million. My, I don't remember quite frankly, but let's say 500 million total tbo. DeFi Summer happened, yield farming happened and we like went over billions within like six months. Could you say that we're almost where we are with Defi Summer? With our.
00:16:01.909 - 00:16:35.287, Speaker B: I was actually thinking about this earlier today. I feel like that is exactly where we are because the whole meme coin thing actually reminds me of Defi Summer. So right now I feel like we're reaching the end of the defi summer and the speculative bubble sort of collapsed a little bit. And then bitcoin went down about. I think bitcoin at that time went down from 14,000 to 12,000. So it was a small correction. And today bitcoin also experienced a small correction.
00:16:35.287 - 00:17:04.743, Speaker B: In my mind it's pretty small, like from 73 to 56. That's a pretty small correction. Same order of magnitude as the one that happened at the end of Defi Summer. There's a lot of similarities, so I kind of agree with you. And also in terms of timeline, if you think of. I don't necessarily buy the four year cycle anymore, but if you still Believe in the four year cycle, then we're around the same timeline as well. We're year three, year two, year three, into the bull market or into halfway.
00:17:04.799 - 00:17:21.755, Speaker A: Right? I mean, yeah. All right, so let's talk about this. It's, to me, it's consensus now that, and look, you know, I don't know. Everyone is telling. Everyone on Twitter is saying we're halfway through the market. Everyone is saying that like it's consensus to the point where it's annoying. It's annoying me.
00:17:21.755 - 00:17:38.228, Speaker A: It wasn't like this last cycle. No one knew what, what the fuck was going on last cycle, if you ask me. And the cycle before that, I mean, it was just pure euphoria. Do you, like. Obviously you don't subscribe to a thesis that every cycle could become a different cycle moving forward.
00:17:38.356 - 00:17:39.900, Speaker B: No, I subscribe to that thesis.
00:17:39.932 - 00:17:47.060, Speaker A: Oh, you do subscribe to that. So you think that historically we'll still be in a four year, like every four years?
00:17:47.212 - 00:17:49.612, Speaker B: No, I think the four year thing is a coincidence.
00:17:49.748 - 00:17:54.646, Speaker A: It's a coincidence. Okay. Yeah, but is that going to be a coincidence moving forward is the question.
00:17:54.780 - 00:18:05.579, Speaker B: Well, again, the current cycle could very well end at the four year mark, but if it does, it's a coincidence from this point on. Again, like I mentioned before, it's driven by global liquidity.
00:18:05.627 - 00:18:06.955, Speaker A: Global liquidity, yeah.
00:18:07.115 - 00:18:20.009, Speaker B: And it just so happens that global liquidity cycles last around four years, like every time. So I don't buy the four year cycles and I don't buy. What is it called? The left translated cycle, the shorter cycle.
00:18:20.187 - 00:18:32.749, Speaker A: Well, okay, let me, let me add more context. Okay, so crypto is becoming mainstream. Is becoming mainstream. Right. Is it fair to say that crypto could become less volatile than previous cycles?
00:18:32.877 - 00:18:39.629, Speaker B: Of course, with more liquidity, more institutional adoption. Sure. On average, the volatility trends down.
00:18:39.757 - 00:18:46.757, Speaker A: Okay, so I guess with volume trending down, will the cycles be as dramatic as they were before?
00:18:46.821 - 00:18:57.097, Speaker B: Is the question less dramatic? Okay, I mean, possibly four year, but if it ends at the four year mark, then again, it's probably a coincidence.
00:18:57.281 - 00:19:06.929, Speaker A: All right, what assets are you most excited about in crypto? Yeah, let's say that we trend down for a bit.
00:19:07.057 - 00:19:12.193, Speaker B: Yeah. What would you buy? What would you buy at the bottom? If you're able to pick the bottom.
00:19:12.289 - 00:19:21.135, Speaker A: What would you buy? Look, ETH has been historically, like over the past six months, ETH has burned me every time.
00:19:21.435 - 00:19:23.855, Speaker B: There were so many funny tweets around eth.
00:19:25.195 - 00:19:29.011, Speaker A: Oh my God, like, I read so many funny tweets about it.
00:19:29.123 - 00:19:37.055, Speaker B: There's so Much fun. Let me read it out. I love Ethereum so much. I made it to in the toilet this morning.
00:19:43.535 - 00:19:44.679, Speaker A: Oh my God.
00:19:44.807 - 00:20:16.523, Speaker B: But anyway, I'm not here to fud eth, but I do think, I do think. So the ETH ETF will be very important. In fact, the ETH ETF is probably the biggest catalyst I can think of. I know a lot of people were saying, like eigenlayer. We're going to talk about eigenlayer as well. But a lot of people were saying eigenlayer was the biggest catalyst or 48, 44 was the biggest catalyst. Obviously I love the technology, I love the innovation, but when it comes to price impact, the ETH ETF is probably the biggest catalyst for eth.
00:20:16.523 - 00:20:23.699, Speaker B: And I think if the ETF does not get approved, I think ETH will continue to underperform BTC and Seoul.
00:20:23.827 - 00:20:26.467, Speaker A: Oh wait, you're saying ETH is going to outperform?
00:20:26.611 - 00:20:57.069, Speaker B: No, no. If ETH gets the etf, it could outperform. Oh yeah, BTC and sol. But if it doesn't get the etf, it'll probably underperform. Because the problem with ETH is, and someone pointed this out, it's over owned by crypto natives. That's why it's so hard to go up, because there's no net marginal buyers. The only thing that people can do among the crypto natives is to diversify from ETH to SOL and not the other way around.
00:20:57.069 - 00:21:19.545, Speaker B: Because ETH is over owned and SOL is under owned at the same time. BTC actually gets marginal inflow from the etf. So that's the fundamental problem about eth. It's over owned by crypto natives and doesn't have marginal inflow from TradFi. So yeah, we'll see. But I still think my base case is still that this is BTC and Solana Cycle.
00:21:19.665 - 00:21:25.415, Speaker A: Okay, so is the barbell approach, because this is also becoming very common on.
00:21:25.455 - 00:21:30.007, Speaker B: Twitter, but it's not btc. Solid is a short barbell. Barbell.
00:21:30.111 - 00:21:30.795, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:31.455 - 00:21:49.995, Speaker B: The long barbell is BTC and whiff btc. Well, I'm actually really surprised WIF didn't go down as much as BTC did in the last couple of weeks. WIF is actually holding up a lot better than btc. That's really impressive. Not financial advice.
00:21:50.135 - 00:21:52.211, Speaker A: Not financial advice. Don't yolo.
00:21:52.363 - 00:21:52.891, Speaker B: Don't yolo.
00:21:52.923 - 00:22:08.563, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean there's some really good narratives that are picking up for some of these meme coins. Maybe we can transition to memes. Although I do feel like memes have Been overplayed. I kind of put a tweet out that said, I'm done with shit coins.
00:22:08.739 - 00:22:09.739, Speaker B: I'm done too.
00:22:09.867 - 00:22:15.147, Speaker A: I don't think I'm done with. It's fun to talk about, but need a little bit of a break.
00:22:15.251 - 00:22:37.475, Speaker B: I feel like there was a chart of the number of meme coins that are created on pump. Let me find it. Okay, so pump kind of launched, or pump took off in mid March. So now it's been about a month and a half. Do you have a guess for how many tokens have been deployed on pump? What's your best estimate in the last one and a half month?
00:22:37.635 - 00:22:42.187, Speaker A: Okay, so about 6,000 tokens per month on average.
00:22:42.331 - 00:22:45.411, Speaker B: Per month? You are off by two orders of magnitude.
00:22:45.523 - 00:22:46.627, Speaker A: Wait, what? How many?
00:22:46.771 - 00:22:48.475, Speaker B: Close to 400k.
00:22:48.718 - 00:22:53.787, Speaker A: 400,000? Are you serious?
00:22:53.891 - 00:22:56.443, Speaker B: Yeah, it's on Dune analytics.
00:22:56.619 - 00:22:57.375, Speaker A: Wow.
00:22:58.435 - 00:22:59.539, Speaker B: Okay, so 400,000.
00:22:59.587 - 00:23:02.495, Speaker A: I got the numbers from somebody from.
00:23:03.355 - 00:23:07.139, Speaker B: Okay, so close to 10,000 tokens launched per day.
00:23:07.267 - 00:23:14.191, Speaker A: Oh, shit. Okay. I was expecting. Maybe I'm definitely off.
00:23:14.223 - 00:23:17.555, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe the data is wrong. I don't know. But it's on Dune.
00:23:19.655 - 00:23:22.527, Speaker A: No, that's insane if that's true.
00:23:22.671 - 00:23:43.393, Speaker B: But my point being back to earlier point. There's so many tokens that are being deployed on chain, and the attention is fragmented across 400,000 coins or 10,000 coins per day that's being generated. And so it's very hard for these coins to go up when there's so much competition for attention.
00:23:43.529 - 00:23:47.685, Speaker A: I mean, look, I got burned by many coins. I can tell you from experience.
00:23:48.025 - 00:23:56.729, Speaker B: Oh, we should talk about the. Okay, the most interesting thing that happened in the meme coin space is the whistleblower.
00:23:56.857 - 00:24:34.161, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about it. So you may have seen this tweet thread where there's a pedo, and he was doing, you know, weird things, and it was shot on, like, I think it was a news channel. And in the background, he was there doing something weird. And everyone was trying to figure out, including the authorities were trying to figure out who this person was and how do we find them. And this crypto Degen, which, who we think are the pioneers of the space, ended up doing some research, found out who it was. His name was like, Stevano, Stefano, Vici or something, you see Eina.
00:24:34.233 - 00:24:35.737, Speaker B: Is that his pseudonym?
00:24:35.841 - 00:24:58.101, Speaker A: No, no, no, this is the. The pedo's name. Oh, the degen's name was something with. Starting with love. L, U or luv. And he put a tweet out and he said something, something to this Nature, which is I did some research, found out who this person was, and I don't have a very strong following. I only have like a thousand followers.
00:24:58.101 - 00:25:27.759, Speaker A: And so I figured the best way to get attention around this is by launching a token. What's his name on it? To dox the person. And if this goes viral, then I've contributed to helping the authorities find this individual. And it did in fact go viral. And it got to a point where the person that initially called out this person a couple weeks ago, someone that's not in crypto, he tagged the crypto degen and thanking him about calling this person out.
00:25:27.847 - 00:25:29.583, Speaker B: Do you know what market cap he went to?
00:25:29.719 - 00:25:31.695, Speaker A: I followed it. I think it went up to a million.
00:25:31.855 - 00:25:32.495, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
00:25:32.535 - 00:25:40.835, Speaker A: I think it died after that. So this is obviously not buying advice or financial advice, but the ticker is TV pedo. Yeah.
00:25:41.855 - 00:26:03.633, Speaker B: So basically he used a meme coin to get this thing to whistleblow. This. Yeah, this guy. And to help spread the message and get the attention. Because for him, creating the meme coin actually help the thing go viral more than tweeting out from his own account. Because he doesn't have that many followers.
00:26:03.769 - 00:26:04.401, Speaker A: That's right.
00:26:04.513 - 00:26:30.163, Speaker B: And that was the most interesting thing I've seen in the last two weeks in the meme coin space. I don't understand why people dismiss meme coins so early. Like, I'm not saying it's necessarily good or bad for me, it's just. It's not moral or immoral, it's just amoral. But every time you see a new thing that becomes so controversial right off the bat in crypto, it's dangerous, very dangerous to dismiss it too quickly.
00:26:30.339 - 00:26:45.359, Speaker A: I mean, if you think about it, this cycle has happened many times. When bitcoin first came out and everyone was memeing that it's going to be the next gold, everyone dismissed it. Right? No. Same thing with Ethereum, same thing with Defi.
00:26:45.447 - 00:26:47.095, Speaker B: Same thing with NFTs.
00:26:47.215 - 00:26:49.687, Speaker A: Same thing with NFTs. Same Thing with Cardano.
00:26:49.831 - 00:26:51.535, Speaker B: Well, Cardano is kind of a bad example.
00:26:51.615 - 00:27:03.863, Speaker A: It's a joke. I wanted to see if you caught it. There are some legitimate people that believe Cardano is still the future.
00:27:03.959 - 00:27:19.779, Speaker B: That's true. Yeah. Actually, I was talking to a friend of mine who's a crypto native, very smart, and he has normie friends, also very smart, well educated, who thinks Cardano is the real deal. So Cardano actually has a lot of real believers.
00:27:19.907 - 00:27:26.555, Speaker A: Believe me, I know. I talk to retail all the time and I think it has to do with Charles being the ex co founder of Ethereum.
00:27:26.715 - 00:27:33.067, Speaker B: Yeah. Charles is the reason why Cardano is at $10 billion FTV. He's the cult leader.
00:27:33.211 - 00:27:33.837, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:33.971 - 00:28:01.909, Speaker B: Which is, by the way, going back to the meme coin discussion. All these new things that we met, like Bitcoin, Ethereum DeFi NFTs, people dismiss them right off the bat. And meme coins get dismissed because they're silly. But there's always these new emergent behaviors that come out of these new experiments. Like this whistleblower guy using meme coins to spread the message. That is fascinating. And I think we might see even more interesting behaviors coming out of the memecon space.
00:28:02.037 - 00:28:20.781, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think this should be launched by then. But another team that we're working with is called Crate and the way, like. Okay, let's talk about music. Crypto music as an example. Generally crypto music, I always felt like it was skeuomorphic, you know, like we're so used.
00:28:20.853 - 00:28:22.989, Speaker B: NFTs were skeuomorphic.
00:28:23.117 - 00:28:25.877, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, NFTs are skeuomorphic in what?
00:28:26.021 - 00:28:28.077, Speaker B: Like the music NFTs were skewer.
00:28:28.141 - 00:28:28.413, Speaker A: Yes.
00:28:28.469 - 00:28:30.865, Speaker B: Like the one song equals one NFT.
00:28:31.235 - 00:28:40.811, Speaker A: That like an MP3 file. Right. Or an itunes file. Yeah. It reminded me a lot of that. Right. Or catalog, which is on chain streaming.
00:28:40.811 - 00:29:08.105, Speaker A: Right. You have vault, where you buy digital copies with USDC of the album in and itself. These are all like behaviors that we're already accustomed to in the real world. But the real question is, what can crypto enable that hasn't enabled music today? That is like the way you'd want to think about it. The way I've thought about it was as follows. Well, for musicians, they had to compete to get on the right algorithm. Right.
00:29:08.105 - 00:29:36.225, Speaker A: To get the right network effects with the distribution that Spotify and YouTube has, you need to have the right influencers. You need to have the right people that are talking about it. And you have to like, work really hard to get there, but it's much easier than what it was previously. Right. If you look in the web one world, you have to have mixtapes or tapes. You release the mixtapes, you start to build local buzz, maybe then the radio station locally takes your song. Then maybe other radio stations take your song.
00:29:36.225 - 00:29:56.257, Speaker A: And that's kind of the way things used to go viral before you're that old. I'm a boomer, yo. But yeah, that's what. That's how things went viral back in the day. Now it's streaming network. So an example of this is, you know, Justin Bieber, how Did he get recruited? He was recording live on YouTube. Right.
00:29:56.257 - 00:30:00.169, Speaker A: And Usher saw it, picked it up and introduced him to P. Diddy.
00:30:00.257 - 00:30:03.121, Speaker B: Oh, is that how he started? Yeah, started as a YouTube influencer.
00:30:03.193 - 00:30:19.393, Speaker A: Yeah. So YouTube launched around 2004, 2005, something like that. Or maybe 2006, he was discovered. 2008, I think it was 2006. So 2008, he got discovered two years later. And so the question then is. And the way he got discovered was because of Reach, everyone liked the song.
00:30:19.393 - 00:30:34.809, Speaker A: And. And that's became the new meta for the next two decades or decade and a half. Right. That became the deck, the. The meta. Like you go on YouTube, you go on SoundCloud, you drop your stuff, you share it, and hopefully it goes viral. You know, maybe the right algorithm, the right.
00:30:34.809 - 00:30:42.905, Speaker A: You know, you just. You just hit it. Right. But now it's becoming, I think, overpopulated. Right. There's just. Everyone's just trying to become the next musician.
00:30:43.065 - 00:30:44.849, Speaker B: Yeah. And hack the algo.
00:30:44.977 - 00:30:58.329, Speaker A: And hack the algo to get there. So the question is, how can crypto compete against the algo? How can crypto compete against the distribution or the network effects that YouTube and Spotify has? I think we have an answer to.
00:30:58.337 - 00:31:02.713, Speaker B: It now through the free market. Through the free market Meme coins.
00:31:02.849 - 00:31:05.925, Speaker A: Exactly. It's probably very contrarian still today.
00:31:06.305 - 00:31:19.969, Speaker B: No, it makes a lot of sense to me. Like, like this. This is the same story as the. The pedal whistleblower. Like you use coins to spread the message to go viral, to help something to go viral.
00:31:20.097 - 00:31:32.441, Speaker A: That's right. So what I think is going to happen is every medium is going to be tokenized and it's going to create a completely new experience for both sides of the marketplace.
00:31:32.593 - 00:31:33.153, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:33.249 - 00:31:59.033, Speaker A: Those that want to deliver value to customers and customers that want to receive value in return, but it's going to be done in a very different way. So here's like an example. Today we are being mined for data. So because we're being mined for data, we get free products. Right. Number two is we also pay, you know, if we want additional services or whatever. There's also a SaaS model, right.
00:31:59.033 - 00:32:33.115, Speaker A: That typically comes with these products that we receive. And the question is, like, okay, how do you compete with that via crypto? Well, you can't compete with free. You just can't. But we could give them the opportunity to make upside and that will compete with any business model that's out there moving forward. So in return, I think what's going to happen is instead of people being mined for Data or subscribing for services. Everyone's just going to become capitalist. And maybe this is too polarizing and maybe there's somewhere it's happy medium somewhere.
00:32:33.115 - 00:32:34.635, Speaker A: I'm not saying this is all going to be like that.
00:32:34.715 - 00:32:52.895, Speaker B: It's going to be very polarizing. But I can see it work and people will not be happy, at least in the first few years. Like people were not happy with Facebook, people were not happy with Tinder. But now these things become widespread mainstream consensus. So people just live with it. People accept it.
00:32:56.425 - 00:33:05.369, Speaker A: Welcome to FounderStories. Today we have Joey on from Crate. Joey, can you talk a bit about who you are and what you're building?
00:33:05.497 - 00:33:20.475, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm Joey building Crate, which is the song crowdfunding platform, a place where artists can launch their songs on chain with a token as a means to bootstrap funding, and their community can show their patronage with a token that shows they were there first.
00:33:20.625 - 00:33:27.775, Speaker A: Nice. How does Crate's tokenization of music differ from previous NFT music narratives? That fall flat. That fell flat.
00:33:27.935 - 00:34:01.205, Speaker D: I think music NFTs were on the right track, they had the right idea. I think they didn't work because they have no liquidity and no secondary market. So you know you buy NFT for a thousand, $2,000, and you know you're never going to sell it. So I think it's just inaccessible to most people. I think they were trying too hard to be skeuomorphic to physical collectibles when we need something new. So I read a Santiago tweet like right before this, it says tokens are more accessible and fun versions of NFTs. And I think it's exceptionally true for music.
00:34:01.205 - 00:34:08.725, Speaker D: There's no sticker shock, no unit bias, and most importantly, you can buy and sell instantly, like locking in your gains or losses.
00:34:08.845 - 00:34:12.837, Speaker A: What does Crate offer artists and fans that current streaming services don't?
00:34:12.941 - 00:34:47.991, Speaker D: Current streaming platforms are like gatekeepers between fans and artists. They control the economics. You pay your 15 bucks a month and most of that money goes to Taylor Swift and Drake, regardless of if you actually listen to them or not, because they pay out in their pie chart system. So that means if there's like a new upcoming artist and you're their biggest fan and you listen to them every single day, they could be not even getting 1 cent a month out of the 15 bucks you pay, even if they're. They're the only artists you listen to. So obviously it's completely broken. So with Crate, we're bringing the relationship between fan artists closer than before.
00:34:47.991 - 00:35:01.991, Speaker D: You can Directly choose how much money you want to put. Whether you want to listen for free and just not spend any money, you can do that or you can put thousands of dollars into your favorite artist songs. There's basically no middleman controlling that relationship.
00:35:02.103 - 00:35:03.743, Speaker A: Great. Joey, thank you so much for your time.
00:35:03.839 - 00:35:04.595, Speaker D: Of course.
00:35:08.305 - 00:35:13.657, Speaker A: Why can't anyone else become the next Justin Bieber or Usher, is the question. Right?
00:35:13.761 - 00:35:14.089, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:14.137 - 00:35:18.905, Speaker A: Like, you and I, we hear good music all the time. Why can't we just buy a token and support them?
00:35:19.025 - 00:35:24.161, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's okay if I lose a little bit of money? Like if I put in like $10 or something.
00:35:24.273 - 00:35:36.117, Speaker A: I don't care if a dollar put a dollar in. You don't even need to put. So here's the other thing, right. I think, look, as much as we're advocating for meme coins, et cetera, people could lose money here. Right. So that.
00:35:36.181 - 00:35:41.861, Speaker B: I also think that the terminology, the meme coin is. We should change it.
00:35:42.013 - 00:35:42.365, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:42.405 - 00:35:53.785, Speaker B: I think the terminology is what leads people to look down on it. Like it has a silly connotation, a negative connotation with it. I think we should call it intersubjective token or something.
00:35:57.205 - 00:35:59.385, Speaker A: What the fuck was that all about?
00:36:01.535 - 00:36:04.791, Speaker B: I study Yuval Harari.
00:36:04.943 - 00:36:06.635, Speaker A: Ah, Yuval Havar. Yeah.
00:36:07.495 - 00:36:09.959, Speaker B: I actually learned that word from Sapiens.
00:36:10.087 - 00:36:10.839, Speaker A: Sapiens?
00:36:10.967 - 00:36:12.711, Speaker B: Yeah. Did you read the book?
00:36:12.823 - 00:36:15.871, Speaker A: I read half of it. I didn't read the whole thing.
00:36:15.983 - 00:36:16.807, Speaker B: Okay.
00:36:16.991 - 00:36:21.727, Speaker A: But I read enough to get an understanding of what he was talking about.
00:36:21.791 - 00:36:42.457, Speaker B: The intersubjectivity part was actually the most important thing I got out of that book. And what the word means is basically memes. Right. It's a short story. It's a story that a group of people can resonate with. So it could be a religion, it could be a funny Internet meme. It could be a song.
00:36:42.457 - 00:36:45.785, Speaker B: Right. All these things are quote unquote inter subjective.
00:36:45.905 - 00:36:49.685, Speaker A: Humans love storytelling. People love to be told stories. People.
00:36:50.465 - 00:37:10.575, Speaker B: Not only that, people love connecting with each other over a story. That's the most important thing. So people love connecting with each other over a funny dog with a head on the Internet. And people love connecting with each other over a religion or over nationality, ethnicity, or over a song. Right. That's the case of music. Meme coins.
00:37:10.695 - 00:37:36.807, Speaker A: So I guess going back to shitcoins, meme coins, whatever you want to call it, Attention tokens intercept interceptive tokens. Istanbul ist is that each token will create a narrative that can connect people together. And the reward is the financial upside. Yeah, I mean, I think that's pretty simple, right?
00:37:36.951 - 00:37:51.569, Speaker B: I think it could work. I really think it could work. Like basically pump fund, but more specialized. Yeah, like specialized version of pump fund across different verticals. Like music videos, forecaster channels, subreddits.
00:37:51.737 - 00:37:59.993, Speaker A: I can see, by the way, all the verticals that Chow is mentioning, we have founders already building in that space that are part of our next batch.
00:38:00.129 - 00:38:05.881, Speaker B: I'm very excited. I don't know if all of them will work, but I'm very excited to see the experiment play out.
00:38:05.913 - 00:38:22.671, Speaker A: Yeah, it's almost as if, you know, I don't know, maybe I just feel like sometimes we're in the future. I don't know if this thing really was to take off. I mean, the entire world could be reimagined, look very differently.
00:38:22.823 - 00:38:25.279, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's going to be a very polarizing.
00:38:25.327 - 00:38:50.361, Speaker A: In the beginning, it's going to be very polarizing. You know, I was listening to this. Okay, so this is. I'm pretty old now, right? But when Xerox, before it first came out, this was 2016, 2017. And. And what really got him into crypto, like deeper into crypto and tok shit. Coining was division 0x had back then and back then, if you know Xerox, it's a.
00:38:50.361 - 00:39:11.635, Speaker A: Or Matcha. Matcha is an aggregator. Xerox is a liquidity protocol that bridges between different AMMs. And it's supposed to unify the liquidity experience so that Matcha and other users can tap into it and create rich experiences for their end users. He said something to the order of I believe. And this was when Shining wasn't even a thing. He said, I believe there's going to be.
00:39:11.635 - 00:39:13.139, Speaker A: Everything is going to be tokenized.
00:39:13.307 - 00:39:17.451, Speaker B: The whole world. I remember this. Who said that? Was it Will A will? Okay.
00:39:17.563 - 00:39:22.635, Speaker A: He said everything is going to be tokenized. There's going to be an AMM for every vertical that's out there.
00:39:22.795 - 00:39:34.039, Speaker B: I remember Olaf remember this. I remember Olaf said the same thing in 2017. And I didn't buy it. I didn't buy the story. But in hindsight, he was right. Everything's going to be tokenized.
00:39:34.127 - 00:39:35.159, Speaker A: Everything's going to be tokenized.
00:39:35.207 - 00:39:43.315, Speaker B: Like tradfi assets in the form of rwas, music videos, subreddits, forecaster channels. Everything will be tokenized.
00:39:43.735 - 00:40:04.435, Speaker A: So kudos to Olaf and Will from Xerox that called it out. And so if that vision was realized today with the liquidity layer, with all the AMMs and all of the liquidity being bridged to 0x protocol, I think could be very successful. Right yeah, like I think that is going to become a big problem today. But now we have Solana. Just. Just joking.
00:40:05.375 - 00:40:09.975, Speaker B: Oh, by the way, Solana congestion is, is. Has gone away.
00:40:10.135 - 00:40:15.555, Speaker A: Yes, you see that, I did see that. The, the update happened and all the Coopers left.
00:40:16.415 - 00:40:37.271, Speaker B: So it seems to me I ruined this. I didn't pull this from, from my, myself, but I learned this from a few people who are knowledgeable. The patch probably helped, but it was mainly because the ore mining thing stopped, you know, you know the quote unquote proof of work DDoS attack.
00:40:37.423 - 00:40:38.047, Speaker A: Yes.
00:40:38.191 - 00:40:44.111, Speaker B: So the moment that thing went away, Solana was. The congestion was done.
00:40:44.223 - 00:40:48.911, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw that. And Fire Dancer is supposed to come out too soon, right?
00:40:49.023 - 00:40:55.527, Speaker B: Oh well, I just saw a tweet about that. Yeah, what was the original quote?
00:40:55.631 - 00:41:00.063, Speaker A: Final integration of the Salana jump. Fire Dancer client is well underway.
00:41:00.199 - 00:41:11.671, Speaker B: Yeah, but that's pre testnet. So I think the next step is testnet and then Mainnet. So probably still what, six months out. Yeah, something like that.
00:41:11.783 - 00:41:31.649, Speaker A: But I'm really excited about it. Between that, between all the L2s that are coming out on Ethereum, oh, maybe we could talk about Monad and Vera Chain and Tom, because those are the three I think that people are talking about as the next big narrative. You've spent a lot of time within Monad, so maybe we can touch on Monad.
00:41:31.777 - 00:41:46.611, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know if it'll work. I mean, I think the tech will work. The technology is super interesting. I think the core problem it solves is that the EVM sucks, so they rewrite the EVM from scratch to make EVM faster, more scalable.
00:41:46.723 - 00:41:51.015, Speaker A: But it's EVM compatible. Right. So anyone can transfer. Yeah.
00:41:51.595 - 00:42:23.679, Speaker B: So if you have smart contracts on Ethereum, ideally, or at least theoretically, you should be able to deploy the same thing on Monad. The problem is the biggest difference between Monad and some of the recent high throughput Ethereum layer 2s is that with the layer 2 you can basically deploy or migrate your ETH directly to the L2, whereas Monad, you don't have native ETH on monad. So that's the biggest challenge for Monad as a layer one, because you don't have the ETH liquidity.
00:42:23.807 - 00:42:29.835, Speaker A: So by not having ETH liquidity. Yeah, that has always been the problem though, right?
00:42:30.615 - 00:42:31.975, Speaker B: That has always been the problem.
00:42:32.095 - 00:42:36.745, Speaker A: But I mean that can be solved easily by farming, right? Could it not?
00:42:36.785 - 00:42:43.925, Speaker B: But you're still not going to have like $500 billion worth of. How much is ETH worth now?
00:42:44.305 - 00:42:45.033, Speaker A: Let me check.
00:42:45.129 - 00:43:14.219, Speaker B: Yeah. $300 billion worth of eth ready to go. If you launch Monad or any layer one, your native asset will be worth maybe at most like 20 billion, I would say, because SOL right now is 50 billion, 55 billion. So you're just not going to have as much liquidity as you would as L2 on Ethereum, because on Ethereum you can have native ETH and there's $300 billion worth. So that's the biggest challenge.
00:43:14.347 - 00:43:16.803, Speaker A: But I think it's kind of they.
00:43:16.819 - 00:43:27.825, Speaker B: Need to solve this, they need to solve this problem. If they solve this problem, the Lithuania problem, then I think it'll probably work. But there's some newer L2s. Have you heard of Mega Ethnic?
00:43:27.895 - 00:43:30.085, Speaker A: I have not. Oh, I saw it on Twitter. Sorry.
00:43:30.125 - 00:43:40.789, Speaker B: Yeah, you saw on Twitter. Yeah, And I was talking to the founders, one of the founders, and she, she was, she was telling me that Mega ETH should be faster than Monad.
00:43:40.877 - 00:43:41.861, Speaker A: How is that possible?
00:43:42.013 - 00:43:48.185, Speaker B: I don't know what the underlying mechanism is, but I mean as a L2. Yeah.
00:43:48.805 - 00:43:54.001, Speaker A: Okay, so, so you don't know the, how the infrastructure or the infra works, right?
00:43:54.133 - 00:43:54.985, Speaker B: I don't know how it works.
00:43:55.025 - 00:43:55.681, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:43:55.793 - 00:44:00.937, Speaker B: She wasn't actually able to explain to me. Yeah, she's not the technical co founder.
00:44:01.041 - 00:44:01.765, Speaker A: Got it.
00:44:02.265 - 00:44:12.985, Speaker B: If what she says is true, Mona is going to face a lot of competition from the L2s because launching a L2 is easier, is easier and it gets more and more commoditized.
00:44:13.145 - 00:44:36.375, Speaker A: So here's another thought I have from a fee perspective. If the average transaction is a hundred dollars on Ethereum layer 1, layer 1 main net and now you have, what's the. Okay, so if, if, if, if Ethereum mainnet is $100 per transaction, let's say, or maybe even $50, because I will get a lot of DMS about this. So let's just say $50.
00:44:37.315 - 00:44:42.971, Speaker B: Well, right now the average is lower. Actually the average is probably 10, $20.
00:44:43.083 - 00:44:43.775, Speaker A: Okay.
00:44:44.395 - 00:44:47.661, Speaker B: Today, on a day like today, it's probably a lot higher because the market is crashing.
00:44:47.763 - 00:44:53.985, Speaker A: Let's say $25. Okay. What would, in theory the fee would be on L2?
00:44:54.105 - 00:44:57.529, Speaker B: Well, on base right now it's like 2 cents, 3 cents, 2 cents.
00:44:57.577 - 00:44:57.825, Speaker A: Okay.
00:44:57.865 - 00:45:00.305, Speaker B: Yeah. And Solana, same thing.
00:45:00.425 - 00:45:10.121, Speaker A: Okay. The way I see this is going from $10 $20 a transaction to $0.02 is a dramatic user behavior change. Right?
00:45:10.193 - 00:45:10.841, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:10.993 - 00:45:19.627, Speaker A: Now going from 2 cents to a fraction of a penny, I don't know if it makes a, that it doesn't make A dramatic impact as it does from $10 to 2 cents.
00:45:19.731 - 00:45:31.963, Speaker B: You sound just like Eth Maxi right now. Because I know a lot of Eth Maxis say the same thing, but I fundamentally disagree with that. I think every order of magnitude improvement in fees will enable new use cases.
00:45:32.059 - 00:45:33.723, Speaker A: Okay, that I agree with.
00:45:33.779 - 00:45:37.715, Speaker B: So for you as an individual user, you may not make too much difference.
00:45:37.875 - 00:45:39.827, Speaker A: So I agree with, let's say for.
00:45:39.851 - 00:45:42.691, Speaker B: Someone who can barely afford a smartphone.
00:45:42.843 - 00:45:50.379, Speaker A: I think, I don't know, I'll push back on that by saying, okay, I agree, maybe there's some new use cases. Right.
00:45:50.507 - 00:46:27.067, Speaker B: The biggest new use case I think is two things. One is people living in developing countries and two, the bots. And bots have a bad rep. But the fact of the matter is, without bots, order books, central limit order books won't work without bots. So algorithmic trading is one of the things that much lower fees can enable because you're going to do a lot of order book updates. And AI is another one if you want to do inference or whatever on chain with AI also by the way, is technically a bot. Right? Much cheaper fees will enable those use cases.
00:46:27.067 - 00:46:44.323, Speaker B: So whenever ETH mask you say eth is the AI money. I mean like it's bullshit. You cannot pay $100 per transaction. Like I think even Solana is not good enough today for AI. You have to bring the cost down by at least one or more orders of magnitude.
00:46:44.459 - 00:47:09.275, Speaker A: So what is the right fee structure? And the reason why I brought up this thesis or thought is I've given you some emergent behavior. What the Tensor team went through, which is between CNFTs, the launch of CNFTs and the low fees within Solana, a lot of the emerging countries are actually buying CNFTs as an example. So Thailand.
00:47:11.255 - 00:47:12.407, Speaker B: Because it's cheaper.
00:47:12.551 - 00:47:47.621, Speaker A: It's much cheaper. So I subscribe to a thesis that I think 2 cents is good enough to onboard the masses versus Ethereum mainnet. You're also seeing this with Solana or Stripe, using Solana as stablecoin transactions as an example. I think it's good enough to onboard the masses. I think what you're talking about is even a step further, which is, you know, AI algo trading and things that are much more advanced, which I also agree with. And so I would probably bucket this as two different use cases. Yeah.
00:47:47.621 - 00:48:17.605, Speaker A: So for I think the everyday person, like even my brother, who, you know, whoever. Right. Like I think for them like Solana is good enough. Base or blast or other L2s are good enough for them to trade share coins. But for advanced, advanced use cases, I 100% agree with what you're saying. So there is a world, I guess there is a world where every like, like Monat can exist and all these other places can or other L2s can exist. Right, Is what you're making argument for.
00:48:17.685 - 00:48:21.261, Speaker B: I want to share a book that I read recently, which I shared with you actually.
00:48:21.413 - 00:48:21.957, Speaker A: Yep.
00:48:22.061 - 00:48:58.025, Speaker B: It's called the Chip War. That book has nothing to do with crypto. It's a book on semiconductors and basically it's a history book on what happened in the last 70 years. So basically since the Second World War up until today. And the key lesson that we learned over the last 70, 80 years was Moore's law and the profound impact of Moore's Law. So basically every, let's say call it 10 years or so, we get an order of magnitude, one order of magnitude improvement and the speed of semiconductors given the same size and same cost. Right.
00:48:58.025 - 00:49:44.035, Speaker B: Another way to think about it is those chips get cheaper by an order of magnitude every year given the same speed and size. And so what happened was during the second World War and the Cold War, chips were first used for military, for weapons. As the chips got cheaper and cheaper, one decade later in the 1970s, people realized, oh, we can use chips for computers to be used for commercial use cases by companies, basically. And then the next decade we realized, oh, chips now are cheap enough to produce personal computers. So that was the rise of Apple and Microsoft. That was 1980s, and in 1990s people realized, oh, we can now use chips for Internet. So that was the dot com bubble.
00:49:44.035 - 00:50:11.233, Speaker B: Right. And then the decade later it was 2000 and tens people realized, oh, we can actually now produce smartphones because now the chips are as fast as it was a decade ago, but much smaller. So now we can produce equally performant but smaller devices. So that was smartphones, and the decade later it was AI. And that's now. So the compute is now powerful enough to run a very high throughput. Yeah, AI.
00:50:11.233 - 00:50:14.345, Speaker B: And then the next decade it could be quantum computing.
00:50:14.465 - 00:50:14.745, Speaker A: Right.
00:50:14.785 - 00:50:56.007, Speaker B: So as chips get more and more performant every year and every decade, we enable new use cases. So this was the most important lesson from that book. And I think the same thing will happen actually with crypto. So remember going back to the stripe example in 2017, Stripe knew that stable coins were going to be big, but it was not fast and cheap enough to support it for mass adoption. But now it is. Now imagine that with Solana or the Layer twos becoming cheaper and cheaper in the next decade there will be new use cases and it's actually very hard for us to foresee to predict what those use cases will be in the next decade. But there will be new use cases.
00:50:56.007 - 00:50:58.079, Speaker B: I'm very confident of that.
00:50:58.207 - 00:51:21.463, Speaker A: That makes me excited as much as, you know, like you're in the crypto bubble today and all you see is, you know, all people tweet about casinos and shitcoining and all that. Being able to see new use cases like AI and others actually keeps me really excited about the future of crypto. I mean look, I think meme coin trading, all this stuff is fun, but typically new things.
00:51:21.639 - 00:51:24.039, Speaker B: I love trading meme coins, but all.
00:51:24.047 - 00:51:31.003, Speaker A: Of this is usually a precursor to what is really to come. Right. Things often look like toys before they actually become full fledged products.
00:51:31.139 - 00:51:33.411, Speaker B: Do you want to quickly touch on eigenlayer?
00:51:33.523 - 00:51:44.855, Speaker A: I do. I also want to open up this pack. So I have to, I have to bridge base. I had to bridge blast. So. So let me do this while we talk. Okay.
00:51:44.855 - 00:51:56.751, Speaker A: Oh, how much I love bridging. Let's talk about. I mean I really want to talk about tonight.
00:51:56.853 - 00:51:57.627, Speaker B: Yep.
00:51:57.811 - 00:51:58.787, Speaker A: I think there's just.
00:51:58.851 - 00:52:00.355, Speaker B: So let's talk about town.
00:52:00.515 - 00:52:17.187, Speaker A: There's just. There's so many exciting use cases and I'll talk about a few that I'm most excited about. But. But you've been diving deeper into space. I know when we last chatted in our last pod you talked about some of the fee like one onboarding is hard because us, they're not allowed to.
00:52:17.291 - 00:52:19.459, Speaker B: Us phones are geofenced.
00:52:19.587 - 00:52:37.711, Speaker A: They're geofenced. Everyone else able to. The fees are a little bit expensive. I had a chance to play around with it. So let's talk about maybe let's dive deeper into the TON thesis. Some of the things that we're seeing. They just made an announcement with Tether.
00:52:37.711 - 00:52:41.511, Speaker A: So I think there's 2 to $300 million now bridged to ton.
00:52:41.663 - 00:52:42.435, Speaker B: How much?
00:52:39.535 - 00:52:51.635, Speaker A: 2 or 300 million. USCT is bridged to ton now. So yeah, let's maybe talk about that. High level.
00:52:52.095 - 00:53:25.969, Speaker B: The high level thesis is exactly the same as Baze and bsc. So if you think about it, Baze has Coinbase, BSC has Binance and TON has Telegram. All these three are huge products, consumer facing products with huge distribution and they're going to bring the users to the chain from the consumer facing front end to the chain. And we actually saw this a year ago with Base when base was not consensus at all. And we said on this podcast that Baze was going to be really, really big. And that's exactly what happened. And so I think the same thing is going to happen for Ton.
00:53:25.969 - 00:53:57.983, Speaker B: But the problem is people, at least in the US And Western Europe, they're not talking about Ton because Ton's, I guess, home base is Eastern Europe or the countries that were part of the former Soviet Union. And I started talking to some of the founders that are building on Ton. There's a lot of Asian founders, really good Asian founders that are building on Tana as well. So that's what I'm seeing. Try the products. They're still very early. The products I tried are very janky.
00:53:57.983 - 00:54:00.847, Speaker B: That's opportunity for startups. What do you see?
00:54:00.911 - 00:54:28.319, Speaker A: So what I'm seeing is they're becoming more crypto native. Let me. Okay. They're becoming more crypto native. So an example of this is the stickers are becoming tokenized. I don't know how big of a deal people think like this is, but I personally think it's such a. Such a big deal because essentially they're NFTs, right? And being able to share and send NFT stickers is what makes crypto.
00:54:28.319 - 00:54:51.371, Speaker A: Crypto. Like, I think the biggest problem with crypto is the fact that it's very expensive for NFTs. They don't have distribution power, and they're just stuck in your wallet, right? So, like, you change it as your PFP and that's it. And so let's put that to the side, you know? L. Right. The Anon on Twitter, he said something which I 100% agree with, is that stickers are the new white papers.
00:54:51.483 - 00:54:52.535, Speaker B: What does that mean?
00:54:53.475 - 00:55:30.389, Speaker A: They're the new white papers for memecoins. So let's play some fun things here, right? If you want to buy Bowden, you buy Bowden, right? You buy the Bowden token and you tell your friends about it because that's what you want to do, right? Like you, I bought Bowden. I think it's hilarious. But what if you get a pack of stickers about and they're all NFTs, and you just share it with your friends? Right? Like you're extending the meme because stickers are so cheap and free to use. Right. And because Telegram has distribution. Right.
00:55:30.389 - 00:55:35.505, Speaker A: You could create frictionless ways of sharing memes to your friends and family.
00:55:35.665 - 00:55:40.825, Speaker B: But why is that better than just sending the stickers that don't have an NFT?
00:55:40.985 - 00:56:24.361, Speaker A: Whether there's NFTs or not, it doesn't matter. I'm just talking about stickers generally, I think that could be a very powerful behavior. Now, being NFTs, I think there's things that you could do that you cannot do with stickers, right? Such as maybe you could introduce claimable tokens airdrop. So let's say you share stickers and you're like, hey, I'm sending you a sticker and you may receive an airdrop for a token. The way I think about it is that you could create, you could increase the unique users of a token by sending this more freely to others. Like, there's ways where you could really extend the unique user base. You could extend the meme to other friends and family.
00:56:24.361 - 00:56:34.333, Speaker A: And that should, in theory, create more buying power for memes that become more connected to the kind of sticker user base. Do you buy that or no, not really.
00:56:34.469 - 00:56:39.253, Speaker B: Okay. I would have to see it. I would have to see it work and go viral in order to believe it.
00:56:39.309 - 00:56:45.981, Speaker A: On other news, did you see polymarket intern Hugo Martingale his tweets?
00:56:46.093 - 00:56:47.225, Speaker B: What did he say?
00:56:48.725 - 00:57:08.531, Speaker A: I gotta pull it up, but it's too funny. Okay, so polymarket, the Twitter handle and Phantom, the Twitter handle were egging each other on to say the word retardio. And so Phantom said R E T A R D I. So they went through like a series of tweets where it spelled out which.
00:57:08.563 - 00:57:10.731, Speaker B: Phantom, the wallet or the chain?
00:57:10.803 - 00:57:41.545, Speaker A: Okay, the wallet. And then right after that the polymarket intern said that he was called into the HR's office. Her name was like Susan something. This is great. And apparently he got disciplined and he can't say the word retardio. And then they put out a like a one page PR release that talked about how the word of retardio is bad and it's against the Poly markets ethos. But in that letter they said the word like retardio like four times.
00:57:41.545 - 00:58:05.947, Speaker A: And then that he had to. And so he went, he got disciplined and they apparently took his axes away from Polymarket, the handle, whatever. But I thought it was just really funny because polymarket in and itself is a very. It's not a degen product.
00:58:06.051 - 00:58:09.345, Speaker B: It's very serious. It's a very serious prediction market.
00:58:09.515 - 00:58:57.301, Speaker A: But the stories and how it's getting deeper into the degen community and surfacing up ways to use the product. To use like what's really interesting is that now it's for like getting degens to use a product by speculating things that are more degen. Right? Yeah. Like an example of this is like with the boxing event with Ansem that Happened recently with Barney the boy. They brought that as a market on poly market. And to me, the strategy is you and I have been bearish prediction markets, right. In the sense of crypto, I think it will be a thing, but I think the opportunity may be taken by Meme Coins and coins in terms of attention.
00:58:57.301 - 00:59:08.495, Speaker A: There'll always be a place for prediction markets, but because it's capped, I think the excitement around the average user using that may be limited compared to Meme Coins.
00:59:08.575 - 00:59:23.687, Speaker B: So I was actually talking to an executive who come from a Web2 sports betting website, a very famous one. Yeah, very popular one. And he told me that the market share or The Sports Betting Web2 Sports betting websites are losing market share to Meme Coins.
00:59:23.831 - 00:59:25.607, Speaker A: That's a pretty big. That's a pretty big.
00:59:25.671 - 00:59:27.609, Speaker B: That was a huge aha moment for me.
00:59:27.727 - 00:59:29.237, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a pretty good.
00:59:29.341 - 00:59:31.125, Speaker B: Because it all makes sense.
00:59:31.285 - 00:59:32.045, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:59:32.205 - 01:00:04.195, Speaker B: The people who go do sports betting on those web two sports betting websites are the same people that trade Meme Coins. And actually Ansem tweeted about this in December last year. I didn't pay attention last. It didn't click with me when he first tweeted about it. But now it all makes sense because ultimately what sports betting is about ultimately is first and foremost making some money and second, the entertainment. That's exactly what Meme Coins are. And I do think Meme Coins are a strictly better product.
01:00:04.195 - 01:00:10.183, Speaker B: So much because the upside is unlimited. It's unknown and unlimited.
01:00:10.279 - 01:00:25.833, Speaker A: Even if you think about betting, there's financial losses, right? I'm not saying that you don't lose money on meme Coins, but you could in theory limit the risk of how much you lose. Like in theory. Whereas with pure financial betting, you lose your. It's like an option, right?
01:00:25.969 - 01:00:30.825, Speaker B: Well, I mean the downside is 100% in both cases, I mean, goes to zero.
01:00:30.905 - 01:00:51.087, Speaker A: Right? Like at least you have optionality. Like there's a spectrum, right? In betting I've never bet, so I don't know. So I've never made a bet in my life. But from what I've seen, it's either zero or hero Meme Coins. You could say it's heroic, but you could say that there's a spectrum before you go to zero.
01:00:51.231 - 01:00:56.115, Speaker B: Yeah, fair enough. But, but, but let's face it, most, most people are. Are going for the hero zero.
01:00:57.295 - 01:00:58.751, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:00:58.943 - 01:01:00.079, Speaker B: A hundred x or zero.
01:01:00.167 - 01:01:13.479, Speaker A: A hundred x zero. Yeah, a hundred percent. Like if you're going to hold this thing to, to whatever 100% agree. But you Know, you could say that it's a safer, to a certain degree it's a safer bet than, than doing a pure binary trade is the way I see it.
01:01:13.527 - 01:01:18.075, Speaker B: Oh, by the way, Kyle Samani also tweeted about meme Coins yesterday. I thought it was interesting.
01:01:18.195 - 01:01:18.923, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:19.099 - 01:01:24.571, Speaker B: What do you say? Isn't Meme Coins the best way to monetize open source projects?
01:01:24.683 - 01:01:25.547, Speaker A: He's getting it.
01:01:25.651 - 01:01:26.651, Speaker B: Do you agree with that?
01:01:26.763 - 01:01:36.531, Speaker A: I do. I think you could use just tokens as a way to monetize anything and increase the behavior of anything if it's done the right way.
01:01:36.683 - 01:02:07.767, Speaker B: If you really think about it, it's obvious in hindsight because the crypto infra products are essentially open source projects that are being monetized within Meme coin. Like they don't create any value to the coin, at least with the exception of maybe Ethereum, which does have some real yield. The vast majority of infra projects are open source and are not accruing any value to the coin itself. So to me, they're meme coins and they're priced based on the level of attention.
01:02:07.871 - 01:02:27.583, Speaker A: And isn't there like projects that are scraping GitHub repositories and using it for their own advances? From a product perspective, sure. So could this in theory solve that problem where you could scrape data, but then you get airdrop tokens? Thanks for contributing to this network. We're going to use your data and every time we use your data you get tokens.
01:02:27.719 - 01:02:34.817, Speaker B: Sure. Or every time you contribute to the. Or you do a pull request, you got a. Yeah, you got a token.
01:02:34.961 - 01:02:39.081, Speaker A: So I 100% agree. I think there's something bit. There could be something here with that.
01:02:39.193 - 01:02:41.561, Speaker B: Anyway, it's interesting. I can see that happen.
01:02:41.713 - 01:02:50.801, Speaker A: So I think the era that we're running into, that we're going into is the hyper tokenization era, I think.
01:02:50.953 - 01:02:51.713, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:02:51.889 - 01:02:53.849, Speaker A: And I think people are starting to get it.
01:02:53.937 - 01:02:57.965, Speaker B: The hyper universal intersubjective tokenization.
01:02:58.985 - 01:03:00.511, Speaker A: Should we talk about Eigen?
01:03:00.633 - 01:03:04.075, Speaker B: That's how about Eigen layer. Because there is a lot of fud.
01:03:04.195 - 01:03:32.965, Speaker A: There was a lot of fud. You know, like look, there's a mismatch of technical talent and their users. Right. Like obviously, you know, like the Eigenlayer team is incredibly talented, very technical, research heavy and you know, you can see that through the DNA of the products that they're building. Right. I mean even if you look at the tagline intersubjective tokens or a 42 white paper, just about the token. Right.
01:03:32.965 - 01:04:08.393, Speaker A: And then you have farmers that are Very profit oriented that have maybe a hundred different tokens that they're farming at the same time. So the attention that they give to any one project is probably nil or zero. And when you come out and say, hey, by the way guys, here's a 42 white page, white paper, I expect you to read this to figure out when you're getting your token. I mean they're only thing that they think about is one token and how much of it I'm getting. Then you come out and say, oh, by the way, here's a catch. We're going to hold your token. Well, why'd you even give it to us in the first place? Why'd you even tell us about it in the first place? You should have been upfront with us about it.
01:04:08.489 - 01:04:09.161, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:09.313 - 01:04:35.795, Speaker A: And so there's this like invisible social contract between protocols and farmers. They're both playing the dance. No one knows what the outcome is going to be, but the expectation is that it's going to the moon. Yeah, right. And the protocol wants that to happen. But they also know that most farmers are mercenaries and profit oriented and that they're just going to dump the token. And that's kind of the game that happens.
01:04:35.795 - 01:04:47.335, Speaker A: Right? That's what it is. And so every now and then you get someone a protocol, they'll say, no, you know what, we're going to do this. I think Paradex. Was it Paradex or Parasol?
01:04:48.665 - 01:04:49.425, Speaker B: Paraswap.
01:04:49.505 - 01:05:04.161, Speaker A: Paraswap. Sorry, Paraswap. Paraswap, who's also an alliance alum, did something kind of interesting which kind of like upset the community. Starknet did this recently that upset the community and now it's Eigenlayer. So yeah, what are your thoughts on it?
01:05:04.233 - 01:05:47.667, Speaker B: From a pure capitalist point of view? Sure, the farmers have the right to be angry, but they should also know that they knew from the beginning that whether or not they will get the airdrop and how much they will get was uncertain. They don't really have anyone else to blame, by the way. I'm not saying this to. I'm not defending or criticizing either side, but that's just the reality of things. It's the free market. If you want to farm something that has no uncertainty, that has no certainty on the value and the amount, then yeah, you bear the consequences. At the same time, I think what airdrop farmers don't know is that sometimes even the team doesn't know from the beginning how the airdrop will be conducted.
01:05:47.667 - 01:06:42.533, Speaker B: Because as you design the airdrop in the token as the dev, you start to Realize that the whole legal and regulatory landscape is a huge black hole. You learn new things every week, you learn new laws every week, new rules every week, and your legal counsel gives you new recommendations every week. So it's a constant moving target. And so it's true that eigenlayer could have been more upfront about the geofencing and the non transferability of the tokens. It's also entirely possible that when they first launched the program they had no idea that they had to geofence all these countries and had to do non transferability. By the way, for those who don't know, I think the most likely reason why they implemented the non transferability of the tokens is actually legal. It's not the stuff that they put out on their website.
01:06:42.533 - 01:07:08.209, Speaker B: Like what they put out on the website is they wanted, you know, like they want decentralization and blah blah, blah. That's not the real reason. The real reason is legal. And I know this because some of the startups that we work with get legal advice like this from their council to lock the token for a year. So it's a legal thing. And it's entirely possible that eigenlayer team didn't know about this when they first launched the program. So yeah, eigen layer team could have done better.
01:07:08.209 - 01:07:20.121, Speaker B: But ultimately I think the right target to redirect our anger or for the airdrop farmers that redirect their anger towards is the regulatory regime and the three ladder agencies.
01:07:20.233 - 01:07:37.207, Speaker A: I agree, but with the caveat that you should be more upfront with farmers getting $15 billion in TVL. Right. It's a lot. Right. And so I think farmers have many opportunities ahead. Right. So there's an opportunity cost for farmers.
01:07:37.207 - 01:07:44.983, Speaker A: And so I do think that protocols need to be a tad bit more upfront about the way they're thinking about it. That's all.
01:07:45.159 - 01:07:57.527, Speaker B: The airdrop aside, the thing that I really struggle with is are the avss real? How many avss will actually use eigenlayer and how much yield are they going to give to the eigenlayer stakeholders?
01:07:57.551 - 01:08:00.615, Speaker A: Can you talk about AVS for audience? What does it mean?
01:08:00.655 - 01:08:31.815, Speaker B: And yeah, so AVS is basically, it could be new protocols, new DApps that need security to secure their protocol, but they don't have their own token yet. So where would that security come from? It could come from the ETH restakers that use eigenlayer. So you can basically think of eigenlayers as a two sided marketplace. On the one side is those AVSs that need security and then on the other Side is the ethical restakers that provide ETH to secure those AVS's.
01:08:31.935 - 01:08:39.583, Speaker A: So why would AVS need to launch their own tokens if they have, if they're using Ethereum as a way to secure their network?
01:08:39.679 - 01:08:57.925, Speaker B: Well, everyone has an incentive to launch their tokens, of course. So what I found is by talking to some of the ABSEs or potential AVs is that at the beginning of their startup journey, they are considering using eigenlayer because launching a token is very, very difficult.
01:08:58.345 - 01:09:00.097, Speaker A: Oh, so like a bootstrapping mechanism.
01:09:00.161 - 01:09:11.153, Speaker B: Yes, so. So eigenlayer is basically a bootstrapping mechanism for new protocols. But in the long run, every protocol has their incentive to launch their own token.
01:09:11.289 - 01:09:31.251, Speaker A: I think that's a fair proposition in my opinion. Yeah, like why worry? It's almost like, you know what Cosmos was trying to push with validator as a service model. Right. Which I think is, was the right approach, but obviously. And then the return the validators would have is that they would just get tokens of that new network.
01:09:31.403 - 01:09:55.633, Speaker B: But what I struggle with is how many protocols actually need security right off the bat. Because if you think about the L2s, right, like people say, oh, L2s could become absent and then, you know, a bunch of middle layer protocols can become. AVSs can use eigen layer, but if you think about the L2s, they're centralized. Like the way they secure their protocol at the beginning is to be centralized.
01:09:55.729 - 01:09:56.145, Speaker A: Centralized.
01:09:56.185 - 01:10:04.065, Speaker B: Yeah, their token has no reason to exist yet. They don't need AVSs, they don't need Eigen layer.
01:10:04.185 - 01:10:12.007, Speaker A: But okay, so let's say that, well, yeah, what if L2s want to decentralize but now they have their token.
01:10:12.071 - 01:10:13.555, Speaker B: They can use their token.
01:10:13.855 - 01:10:14.439, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right.
01:10:14.487 - 01:10:32.559, Speaker B: Secure their protocol. So I'm sure there will be use cases, there will be good candidates for eigenlayer, but I just struggle with the number of that. So we'll see how it plays out. I think eigenlayer has a good reason to exist, but how big really the market is, we'll have to see.
01:10:32.647 - 01:10:59.275, Speaker A: And then you also have Garak, which is a competitor eigenlayer. Some people have said that the recent speed of movement from eigenlayer has been because Karak and others are starting to compete with them. So I'm unsure of that notion or thesis, but just calling it out for our audience. But overall I think Sriram and team are incredibly strong. I think they will do well. They just have to kind of. I mean this happened with Tensor.
01:10:59.275 - 01:11:41.027, Speaker A: Like people flooded Tensor when the token dropped every Airdrop. Every airdrop, there's always a mismatch of expectations. Most people forget they demand one side with their signs and pitchforks about why they need to get more tokens and yada yada yada. But I do think there is a way. I think public comms is important. If you're a protocol, launch your token, try to be more upfront because as more as front load information and then drop the token versus dropping a token and then trying to fix it afterwards is the only suggestion I would have for protocols.
01:11:41.131 - 01:11:58.815, Speaker B: I agree you want to treat your user as well, but at the same time a lot of the FUD is a little bit misplaced as well. So honestly, I would take the. What's that guy? What's the health guru's name again? The guy who dated the six women at the same time.
01:11:59.315 - 01:12:00.491, Speaker A: Oh, Huberman.
01:12:00.603 - 01:12:34.001, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, I would take that Andrew Huberman approach, which is just not deal with it. Like he just posted through the whole week. Like the week where there was so much fud, he did not address it at all, neither on his podcast or on Twitter. He just posted through like he just posted, kept on posting and talking and doing the podcast as he normally would and the week later everyone forgot. So I think the same thing, you know, with airdrops. I think the airdrop farmers will forget about this whole thing in a week.
01:12:34.153 - 01:12:41.969, Speaker A: Someone famously said that most users have short term memory. So like as long as especially the airdrop farmers.
01:12:42.017 - 01:12:44.409, Speaker B: They're by definition missionary.
01:12:44.537 - 01:13:00.867, Speaker A: Yeah. Speaking of airdrops, Fantasy launched Mainnet today and I'm really excited about this team. They were part of our most recent batch. Maybe talk about how your experience finding the like connecting with the Fantasy team and we could talk a bit about.
01:13:01.051 - 01:13:12.075, Speaker B: Yeah, when they first launched the product, they just tagged me because they have a bunch of cards, right. And every car represented, quote, unquote influencer. And I'm somehow one of the influencers. So they would.
01:13:12.155 - 01:13:14.611, Speaker A: No, no, no, you're not an influencer, you're a kol.
01:13:14.723 - 01:13:17.011, Speaker B: I'm a kol. Key opinion leader.
01:13:17.203 - 01:13:22.035, Speaker A: My opinions are key to leading the future of Defi.
01:13:22.155 - 01:13:45.509, Speaker B: Exactly. But anyway, so they dog fooded their own product and so they play the game, they collect the cards and they collected me and they tagged me on Twitter saying they collected my card of the card of me. So that's how I found out about them and started chatting with them and I really liked the team and then we flew them to New York to work with us for two weeks and they're just the most Hardworking team of the cohort.
01:13:45.637 - 01:14:08.683, Speaker A: These guys are insane. 3:00am they would leave the office. I mean, I would leave at like, I don't know, 9pm every day. Every day. It's insanity. But, you know, I would say that because they stayed so late and worked so hard, they inspired a lot of our other founders to work just as hard. So they have this, like, energy even on Twitter, like, just the energy.
01:14:08.683 - 01:14:11.295, Speaker A: It makes me want to open up a pack every time.
01:14:12.115 - 01:14:20.975, Speaker B: I love their, like, you know when you create a referral call and tweet about it and they have a new message every time.
01:14:21.115 - 01:14:21.455, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:14:21.495 - 01:14:36.631, Speaker B: And the latest is fantasy. Is the most egalitarian, blah, blah, blah. You know, that thing, Right. The most egalitarian. If it really, if it works, we'll really change the fabric of society. Like, they're so good at this stuff. They're so good at making and be funny and making things go viral.
01:14:36.631 - 01:14:38.615, Speaker B: And it's very natural. It's not cringe.
01:14:38.695 - 01:15:25.719, Speaker A: It's very natural, very natural. All right, so I put this tweet out the other day that said consumer crypto founders will have to master the art of incentives along with the art of attention. And those that do it really well can really onboard like a large group of, like, users, like, or core users. And I put right after that tweet, I put in, those that follow the existing playbook will not make it because every, like every art or every launch has to be so unique, so special that people will, like, get rid of all the farming opportunities out of the way because there's a thousand. And they'll give 30% of their attention to this one protocol or this one special project. And that's very hard to do. That's very hard to do.
01:15:25.719 - 01:15:38.497, Speaker A: But these guys have managed to do it. And I think moving forward, consumer crypto founders not only have to compete for attention, but they also have to compete for opportunity cost. Right. For airdrop farmers and just users generally.
01:15:38.631 - 01:15:42.861, Speaker B: So my current mental model for selecting founders, I have a very simple mental model.
01:15:42.973 - 01:15:43.429, Speaker A: Okay.
01:15:43.517 - 01:16:08.075, Speaker B: And there's obviously a lot of exceptions to this, but I love Ivy league kids who build infra and I love degens who build apps. That's it. And I think if you're not a degen, you cannot build great apps. Like, every team that I've seen that build really good apps in crypto are degens themselves. By being diligence, they understand the users 100%.
01:16:08.455 - 01:16:34.735, Speaker A: I mean, it just goes back to this, right? You got a dog food crypto. If you can't Dog food, crypto for two years, then you won't understand the problems that crypto founders or users go through. I mean, like, you and I have talked to many founders that apply to our program and, like, the basic concepts of certain things that may seem so. Like the problems of onboarding into wallets and bridging and all of that. Like, we can tell whether founders actually have gone through this. It's very easy for us to tell. Yeah.
01:16:34.735 - 01:16:54.735, Speaker A: And so for founders are looking to apply to our program, we're very heavy deep into crypto, and we're degenerating everything. We're doing, all of what users are doing today, and we can talk pretty quickly. All right, I'm going to share my screen here. All right, live pack opening, guys, with Top Fantasy. What do you think I'm going to get?
01:16:55.315 - 01:17:01.813, Speaker B: You're going to get me. I think you're going to get me if you get me. Simulation confirmed.
01:17:01.949 - 01:17:12.785, Speaker A: Simulation confirmed. Okay, let's see. All right, let's see what we get. Oh, I have more packs left to open. All right, let's do this.
01:17:14.725 - 01:17:30.265, Speaker B: Music. Who is it? Sex offender.
01:17:30.925 - 01:17:39.309, Speaker A: Sex offender. War Daddy Capital, Mikado, or what's the founder? Rip It Fan?
01:17:39.397 - 01:17:41.717, Speaker B: The other founder, Eric Wall. Nice.
01:17:41.821 - 01:17:49.101, Speaker A: Eric Wall. Mark Chainsaw, Jenka.
01:17:49.133 - 01:17:49.985, Speaker B: Seneca.
