00:00:00.200 - 00:00:48.214, Speaker A: What is the future of bitcoin? Because right now the biggest worry for bitcoin has been, at least for me and I think for you too as well, which is a fee market. It's a fee market exactly like Coinbase when I mean, say Coinbase is like new coins are generated aren't going to be enough for miners to continue to secure the network over time. You know, every four years there's a happening where the incentives are cut in half. And so over time miners have to rely on transactions on the bitcoin network to continue to extract value so it can continue to run its operations. And right now no one really uses bitcoin outside of just sending money back and forth. And that doesn't happen very often because confirmation times are long or et cetera, et cetera. But with this, it's starting to create a fee market and more demand for the block space and this could be a way to secure the network in the long run.
