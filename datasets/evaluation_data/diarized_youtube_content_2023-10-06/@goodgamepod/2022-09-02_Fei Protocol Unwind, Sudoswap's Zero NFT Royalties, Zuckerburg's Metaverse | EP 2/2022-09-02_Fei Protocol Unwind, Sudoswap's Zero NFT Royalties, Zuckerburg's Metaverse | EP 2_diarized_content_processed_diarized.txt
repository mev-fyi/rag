00:00:00.200 - 00:00:36.249, Speaker A: The impact is, as an industry, we can't build real products that people use, because real products that people use do not take only two years to build. They take fucking 10 years. It doesn't matter how permissionless, how Turing complete this blockchain thing is, it takes 10 years to build a really good product. And I think that's why up until now, we haven't seen any real mainstream products in crypto yet. I think it's a big deal. It's a big problem. Neither the investor nor the founder are committed for building a product that can last decades, because both parties can dump their tokens on retail within two years.
00:00:36.417 - 00:01:00.775, Speaker B: Welcome to Good Game, a podcast for crypto insiders with your host, Imran and Chow. All right, ciao. So I talked about going long on ETH last week. You talked about shorting Ethan, and obviously my trade didn't work out well. But let's talk about how you came to that realization and where we're going to go next.
00:01:00.935 - 00:01:44.633, Speaker A: The crux of the. Of the argument for shorting ETH last week, or at least two weeks ago, when ETH was at like 2000, it was twofold. One is macro was complete shit, and S and P was at a point where you went up so high that it was actually shortable. Okay, So S and p went to 4200. So that's one part. The other part is basically everyone was bullish on these. The merge was so overhyped that everyone that I talked to was positioned for a pump pre merge, which, by the way, is something that reoccurred over and over again in the past.
00:01:44.633 - 00:02:20.125, Speaker A: Right. Usually before a major event, the price of that asset that is going through the event should go up. Okay, so that's something that happens over and over again in the past. But the fact that everyone is so bullish makes me think that there's no more room to go up anymore. Right. So that was the crux of the argument for shorting ETH. Right now, ETH is 25, 30% down from our last episode.
00:02:20.125 - 00:02:35.657, Speaker A: I wouldn't shorten out like it. Like, you never. You should never short like the sort of the. The tail end of a. Of a bear market. Okay, but one thing I'm personally doing on my PA is.
00:02:35.841 - 00:02:38.929, Speaker B: Wait, did you just say tail end of the bear market?
00:02:39.097 - 00:02:40.593, Speaker A: I think. I think it's the tail end.
00:02:40.729 - 00:02:48.299, Speaker B: But. But. Well, I mean, the armchair economists on Twitter are telling us year to two year.
00:02:48.427 - 00:02:57.115, Speaker A: Well, by tail end, I mean like something like three, maybe three months until the actual bottom. You don't want to shorten it in this stage.
00:02:57.235 - 00:02:58.011, Speaker B: Okay.
00:02:58.203 - 00:03:33.755, Speaker A: You definitely don't want to short ETH at this stage or any crypto at this stage. You know, in the. In the 2017 cycle, there were several funds that blew up short and near the bottom, and those funds were, like, some of the biggest bulls we've ever seen in this industry. You're so bullish on crypto, and yet you try to short near the bottom of the bear market. It's ridiculous. But one thing I would do right now, maybe to hedge your portfolio, is to short S and P. I got lucky.
00:03:33.755 - 00:03:42.855, Speaker A: I bought some puts when the Vix was below 20. Now the Vix is like, 20. 26. 27. Yeah, 25. Okay.
00:03:43.755 - 00:03:44.579, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:44.747 - 00:03:51.019, Speaker A: So I think S P is still shortable at this stage, and that would be a pretty good hedge.
00:03:51.067 - 00:04:02.587, Speaker B: But, I mean, S P correlates. I mean, crypto correlates with S and P. Right. So you could argue that if there's more downside for S, there's more downside.
00:04:02.651 - 00:04:19.345, Speaker A: That's exactly why I think that we haven't seen the bottom in crypto yet. I mean, I think there's slightly over 50% chance that we haven't seen the bottom in crypto yet. But in terms of relative price level, S and P is probably more attractive to short than eth.
00:04:19.765 - 00:04:30.653, Speaker B: Got it. So you think we have probably a few more months left before we actually bottom, and from then on up, only.
00:04:30.789 - 00:04:32.905, Speaker A: A couple more of the conditions than up only.
00:04:37.045 - 00:05:14.081, Speaker B: Oh, Kyle and Sue. Cool. This is great. I listen to a lot of great podcasts that are out there, great Twitter threads, but I feel like there wasn't enough diligence on Fay Protocol and the unwind. And I think that's really important for our listeners because there's ramifications of just, like, what happened with Fay and how it lost a lot of its community members and it ended up ultimately shutting down. But I believe they also made a lot of governance mistakes that ultimately led to their demise.
00:05:14.153 - 00:05:33.915, Speaker A: So I saw the tweet. Well, I saw one of the tweets about the. You know, the. What's happening with Fei right now, And I thought it was pretty fucked up, but I didn't think that much deeper. But I know you did. So maybe let's start with some facts, and then maybe we can share some opinions as well.
00:05:35.775 - 00:05:44.315, Speaker B: Yeah. So Faye raised about $1.3 billion in ETH, or 640,000 in ETH, which is pretty insane.
00:05:44.735 - 00:05:46.755, Speaker A: From a public sale or something.
00:05:47.815 - 00:06:24.715, Speaker B: From a public sale. It's a way to bootstrap their liquidity or their pcv, which means protocol controlled value. And I'll talk a bit about what that means. But essentially FEI was designed as a protocol value based stablecoin. And so protocol control value means that ultimately the protocol owns the assets. And so whatever it decides to do with its own assets would accrue value to FE the protocol. And the idea for Viv1 was ultimately to use protocol control value as a way to maintain the peg, the stablecoin.
00:06:24.715 - 00:07:06.037, Speaker B: And I'd say six months to eight months down the line, it didn't work out the way it's supposed to. It was very volatile. The, the stablecoin Fay and then V2 was launched, and V2 was ultimately launched as a way to maintain the peg in a much more constructive way, which is ultimately, if I have ETH as a user and I want access to FAY as a stable coin, I would sell my ethnicity for fei. So redeem and mint FEI against the assets. And that turned out to be much better for fei, I think in terms of design. And they were doing decently well. And then I'd say last.
00:07:06.037 - 00:07:21.735, Speaker B: So this was probably like late 2021. Rari came into the picture and proposed a merger. And this merger, I mean, at the time it sounded very interesting, which is one, you know, I think the entire community was excited about DAO to dao.
00:07:21.815 - 00:07:28.035, Speaker A: What was it? If I remember correctly, that might have been the first ever doubt merger.
00:07:29.295 - 00:07:53.277, Speaker B: That's right. And so, and then maybe we could talk about this afterwards. But like, you know, if you look at like traditional M and A, it's done in a very, it's done very differently. Right. Like there's due diligence, there's auditing, there's financial auditing, you know, there's alignment of vision. This was just proposed through a community and people voted on it. And then it went through.
00:07:53.277 - 00:08:30.805, Speaker B: So what was interesting about this was, you know, they proposed this to the community. It made a lot of sense into, at least at that time, why they did it, which was ultimately you have this like liquidity. You have like this enormous amount of liquidity that's sitting on the balance sheet of fei. Why don't we use this as a way to bootstrap RARI and their Fuse pools and Rari Capital. And Fuse is ultimately like a tail end lending protocol. So you could ultimately borrow against tail end assets that you can't find in your traditional lending markets like AVE and Compound. So.
00:08:30.805 - 00:08:59.072, Speaker B: And FEI is looking for demand side, like they're trying to grow the demand side. And so they thought by marrying these two, it would work. The problem is, and the reason why I brought up auditing was the fact that Rari was already hacked before once. So that was an interesting signal for $11 million. And so when this merger happened, Faye had to pay off all of Rari's liabilities before the merger goes through. And they did. There's actually people that pushed back.
00:08:59.072 - 00:09:24.429, Speaker B: So FEI protocol, there's like 10% of the users that tried to vote against it. And instead of, like listening to them and trying to figure out a way to listen to their concerns, they just. The team created a rage quit option. And they just said, you know, if you don't believe in this, just redeem against your faith or dying and get out. And that's what ended up happening. So that went through and they merged.
00:09:24.477 - 00:09:39.707, Speaker A: I mean, on paper, when you acquire or merge within a company, everything on their balance sheet should be on your balance sheet after the merger as well. So the liabilities, in theory, should become your liabilities as well. And so you need to pay those.
00:09:39.851 - 00:10:20.185, Speaker B: And it makes a lot of sense to why they did that. So nothing wrong with that. I think we'll talk a bit more about that. A couple of interesting stats on top is around April 2022, Rory and Fei, which is now called Tribe Dao, because Tribe Dao ultimately manages these two products, was hacked for 80 to 90 million bucks. It was primarily from the Rari fuse pools. And there was a vote out right after that, said, let's pay back using protocol control value to the users that were affected. They could have done it easily and they would have been fine afterwards because the market was up only at that point.
00:10:20.185 - 00:10:55.035, Speaker B: But it ended up going to shit. Everyone said no and no one got paid back. And most recently, there was tip one to one, which was announced, which then told the community, hey, we're just going to shut down Tribe Dao. And what does that mean? Well, our governance token will mean nothing. Two is we're going to repay back our victims, and that's going to be $57 million. 57 million tribe tokens. And finally, what's going to end up happening is the teams are just going to move on to something else.
00:10:55.035 - 00:12:05.625, Speaker B: But if you read between the lines, what really happened was one, Rari essentially caused the downfall for fei. Two is obviously there was huge regulatory risks. And then three, the macro change in terms of market. So all of the protocol control value that was worth 2 billion at the peak is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And so finally you know, if you look at like the way people are getting paid back, hacked victims probably between 3% and 30% of the dollar they put in are getting paid back. So not every investor or not every hacked victim is 100% getting paid back dollar for dollar. And so now the debate is how should Fay or Tribe Dao handle the shutdown of its protocol and how should they handle the community side of things? And it turns out some people are saying that they're advocating more for their investors and allowing their investors to get redeem back 100% of the money they put in versus the community, which is they're getting like pennies on a dollar more or less.
00:12:05.625 - 00:12:07.745, Speaker B: And that's where we are.
00:12:08.165 - 00:12:14.787, Speaker A: What are your thoughts? I have some quick thoughts, but it's not very well informed Jet. So I'm curious what you think.
00:12:14.891 - 00:12:55.433, Speaker B: Well, I think Faye was, I think you know, the founder, Joey Faye. I think they were on an interesting trajectory without Rari Capital to begin with, which is v2 was interesting where you know, like instead of like MakerDAO or AAVE or Compound, where you over collateralize your assets and borrow against it to do whatever you want in defi, you ultimately sell your assets to the protocol and then you redeem fe, which is a stablecoin. I thought that was an interesting model. Their V1 not. I wouldn't say V1 was good, but V2 I thought was interesting and I thought they were on a pretty interesting trajectory.
00:12:55.569 - 00:13:50.551, Speaker A: I thought the current debate of whether to reimburse the community who got hacked versus the investors, I think that debate feels like a tyranny of the majority kind of scenario. And by majority I mean majority of voting power. Because if you obviously all this on chain stuff is not like this done entirely on chain. There's no like no link to the traditional legal framework. But if you draw the analogy between FEI and what happened with three arrows, right. Three hours in Celsius and all the other lending platforms where the users lost money, the users being the creditors, lost money, you could argue that the fake community that got hacked are the creditors.
00:13:50.703 - 00:13:51.555, Speaker B: That's right.
00:13:51.935 - 00:14:18.089, Speaker A: And the token holders are shareholders. And if you know how capital structure works, typically the creditors have greater seniority over the shareholders. So on paper, I think that the people who got hacked should get reimbursed first. They should have priority over the investors. But the investors in this scenario are the majority of token holders.
00:14:18.257 - 00:14:59.363, Speaker B: You're right. I 100% agree with that. Which is the community. The hacked victims should be number one, number two, and the shareholders should be lost. And in fact, you know, I have talked to people and investors that are very close to Fei, and there is a group of people within the Fay shareholders community or percentage shareholders that are advocating to pay off the community first. And some people are very vocal about it. Like Kobe, right? He said it like, I think the tweet came out like a week ago or a couple days ago that said guys like, pay the community off, it's goodwill.
00:14:59.363 - 00:15:59.079, Speaker B: You don't want to pay the investors off. But from others that I've talked to within that community, there are certain shareholders that are advocating for them to get paid back first, and they're not budging. And I think this comes to governance, right? Which is what governance protocol are we following? Are we following, you know, equity shareholders? Are we following token holders? Who has their first right? That's like one, two is you're starting to see a lot of decentralization theater in every protocol. And I worry a little bit about this because ultimately, like, whatever the team decides and maybe the shareholders or the board of directors decide is what they want for the community. It's not about what the community wants for the protocol. It's what the team and the board of directors want for the community. And if you are a protocol that's decentralized, it should be the other way around.
00:15:59.079 - 00:16:04.635, Speaker B: Right? But it hasn't been like that for many protocols that I've been a part of.
00:16:05.175 - 00:16:47.043, Speaker A: I think this is basically a key issue with token governance, right? When everything is going well, when the market is up, only then token governance might be okay. As long as you don't do decision by committee for every single decision out there, token governance might be okay. It might just work out. But when shit hits the fan, you need the traditional legal framework to take care of scenarios like this. And I think this is the issue that people, including myself, have actually brought up many, many years ago about token governance. It does not protect the minority rights. When something like this happens, it's always going to be a tyranny of the majority kind of scenario.
00:16:47.043 - 00:16:57.307, Speaker A: So I think all that to say we're still very early in the token governance, how we're experimenting with various ways to govern the protocol with token holders.
00:16:57.411 - 00:17:36.415, Speaker B: I don't think there's enough guardrails for startups in crypto at all. What do I mean by that? Here's an interesting example. FEI had raised $1.3 billion. There was no rules or parameters set in place of what they're going to do with that capital. I mean, that's a Lot of money. And there was no rules or parameters set in place that would allow like, that would safeguard that those assets were going to be protected or were going to be used for certain types of activities.
00:17:36.415 - 00:17:47.135, Speaker B: It's just we're raising $1.3 billion protocol control value, this new buzzword, and trust us, we will find a way to make sure that we are profitable.
00:17:47.555 - 00:18:17.877, Speaker A: I mean, I mean this happens in past cycles as well. Like 2017 was a bunch of examples like this. Right. I think what's going to happen in the future is we're going to make mistakes as a community, as an industry. We're going to make mistakes like this over and over again. And at some point we're going to learn the lessons and maybe hard code some rules into the protocol, into the token design itself and, you know, things will just get better slowly but surely. Anyway, I think we've talked enough about fate.
00:18:17.877 - 00:18:20.685, Speaker A: Do you want to switch gears a little bit?
00:18:20.845 - 00:19:06.905, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think this has a lot to do with like, not enough guardrails for founders. There's some interesting tweets that I've seen recently that talks more about governance and what are the issues of governance in crypto. One example that I saw recently was, you know, I don't remember the name, but it was an NFT community where one of the CEOs decided that they should get paid seven figure salary. I mean, like, what the fuck? I mean, that tells you a lot, right, about our industry, which is and governance. And I totally agree with you. We are very like, we're on the experimental side and we're learning as we do, as we're doing.
00:19:06.905 - 00:20:09.877, Speaker B: And the people that ultimately are going to get affected are the people that are entrusting their capital to these founders. And the founders, I don't think, have enough guardrails put in by, put on by investors because investors are, I mean, there's so many incredible founders who are coming into the space and I think investors are overwhelmed, capital flushed and aren't really giving the support that founders need. And so the founders have all this capital, they're young and they make mistakes like you know, going, I'm going to go back to the Fay and Rari merger. In theory it sounded really cool, but did they use it M&A infrastructure or protocol to actually diligence the deal and vote in properly how this deal should be engineered versus let's just vote and let's just move on. Right. So I think that we're just very early in how governance is structured. You have a lot of Decentralization theater.
00:20:09.877 - 00:20:16.425, Speaker B: And then you also have NFT or founders that are just going to take this capital and do whatever they want.
00:20:17.695 - 00:20:19.255, Speaker A: Speaking of that NFT story.
00:20:19.375 - 00:20:20.007, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:20.151 - 00:20:32.551, Speaker A: What's the latest in the NFT land? I know some of our founders are pretty fascinated by the Sudoswap experiment. What are the facts and what do you think?
00:20:32.583 - 00:21:00.601, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Sudaswap is very interesting. It's essentially like an AMM like model and they have customizable bonding curves, like linear and exponential curves. So the price based on what it's listed for, you can decide how the price should be moving forward. And interesting. A lot of people were bearish on NFT amms.
00:21:00.713 - 00:21:02.645, Speaker A: Why is that actually?
00:21:02.985 - 00:21:04.817, Speaker B: How do you feel about nftmms?
00:21:04.921 - 00:22:08.369, Speaker A: Well, empirically it works, right? Empirically pseudoswap is gaining traction, by the way. I'm not entirely sure how much of that can be attributed to the AMM versus 0% royalty, which we can talk about in a bit. I think AMMs for NFTs make sense. And it would be pretty similar to the early experiments of AMMs versus central limit order book for Thunderbolt tokens. Right? Like in the early days before 2020, before DeFi summer, there were a bunch of off chain order book, or maybe even some on chain order book decentralized exchanges for foundable tokens. And yet it was Uniswap that was basically the first breakout decentralized exchange with the AMM model. I think there are pros and cons for both AMMs and order books.
00:22:08.369 - 00:22:55.931, Speaker A: The pro for AMM is that it's much easier to bootstrap liquidity with the AMM model. And that can be attributed to, I think, two reasons. One is that basically when you launch a pool, you don't need professional market makers to provide liquidity. Right? All you need is to deposit some money into this algorithm and the algorithm will make markets for you automatically. Recruiting professional market makers is very difficult. Okay, like all these market makers have way too much opportunity cost. They make so much money in other markets, why would they build something bespoke to trade on AMM? Right, that's one problem.
00:22:55.931 - 00:23:43.691, Speaker A: The other reason why AMMs are better for bootstrapping liquidity is that I think they are cheaper computationally. So they're much cheaper to execute on some of the earlier chains or all chains in general. But this was a very big deal because Ethereum up until now has been very expensive to use. I think these two factors contributed to the early traction of Uniswap. Now I still think so. I had this debate with people like back in 2020 and during the defi summer. But I still think that the final destination for decentralized exchanges is order books.
00:23:43.883 - 00:23:44.915, Speaker B: You're a cloud maxi.
00:23:44.995 - 00:24:48.385, Speaker A: I am a cloud maxi. And the problem with that is history is path dependent. So the final destination may happen 10 years from now when professional market makers are more deeply integrated with blockchains and when blockchains are much cheaper to use. But it'll take a long time to get there. And in the meantime, AMMS are the best thing that we have, are the most pragmatic things that we have. And so I think that's why AMMs are still going to be a very meaningful share of the market in terms of trading volume for the coming years. And by the way, I think Uniswap V3, despite being called an AMM, is actually more like an order book because it provides professional market makers with the flexibility to do algorithms that they want to do, rather than using an algorithm that the protocol dictates.
00:24:48.385 - 00:25:30.645, Speaker A: And this flexibility is very important for market makers. That's how they can get an edge over the rest of the market participants. If you give them a market making algorithm that they have to use, they have no edge against the rest of the market. And the result of that is, with a very general purpose amm, there is very little professional market making activity. And without those professional market makers, the spread will be high. But the Uniswap V3 actually attracted a bunch of professional market makers because of the flexibility. So that's one important point to lay out there.
00:25:30.645 - 00:25:55.329, Speaker A: The other point is the dichotomy between AMMs and order books. I think is a false dichotomy. And what I mean by that is in the ideal world, you should have an order book at the base layer, and then you have multiple AMMs built on top of a central limit order book.
00:25:55.497 - 00:25:57.761, Speaker B: So are you saying layer one?
00:25:57.953 - 00:26:12.273, Speaker A: No, I'm not saying layer layer one, amms, I'm saying, Sorry, I shouldn't use the word base layer, but I should have said order books are at a lower abstraction level than amms.
00:26:12.449 - 00:26:13.113, Speaker B: Okay?
00:26:13.249 - 00:26:44.575, Speaker A: Order books are more general purpose, they're more quote, unquote, Turing complete, okay? If you want to think of it from a computer point of view, and the AMMs are more specific, they're less general, they're more specific, and therefore they should, in theory, build on top of something more general purpose, which is the order books. So in the ideal world, you have one pool of order books, and then you have a bunch of AMMs built on top of this one order book.
00:26:44.695 - 00:26:48.875, Speaker B: Why have an AMM to begin with if you have order books?
00:26:49.175 - 00:27:29.519, Speaker A: Because precisely because of the fact that AMMs are better at bootstrapping liquidity. You provide this market making algorithm for everyone to use rather than if you Only in the case of an order book, only the market makers can provide liquidity on the order book. So you sort of increase your initial distribution, you enable more players to participate. I think that's the ideal world. But again, order books are probably a lot more expensive to execute and that's why we haven't really built this yet. We haven't really had this separation of two layers at this point in time yet.
00:27:29.687 - 00:28:00.715, Speaker B: That makes a lot of sense. And in this case AMMs are Sudaswap, right? And then clobbed, which is central order books are OpenSea and Magic Eden in this case. Interesting to see like OpenSea deploy this feature called make a collection offer, which is essentially they're bootstrapping the sell side of the, or sorry, the buy side of the liquidity. Right. So anyone can push this button and they could put a mass offering on any NFT that wants to be sold.
00:28:00.755 - 00:28:04.355, Speaker A: At X price with any NFT within the collection.
00:28:04.475 - 00:28:19.367, Speaker B: That's right. So that's very interesting because before then like I didn't have really a buyer of last resort, right? So I mean I have like, I don't know, a bunch of entities and I can't sell any of them because there's no liquidity for them.
00:28:19.471 - 00:28:23.775, Speaker A: But basically up until now the order book is only sell side. You only have a sell side order book.
00:28:23.855 - 00:28:24.103, Speaker B: That's right.
00:28:24.119 - 00:28:27.487, Speaker A: And with this new feature they're able to bootstrap a buy side order book.
00:28:27.551 - 00:28:59.217, Speaker B: That's right. And so it's interesting. So you're starting to see like opensea become this pseudo club, right? Order like the central order book that will ultimately help both buyers and sellers transact. I still think it's slower compared to sudoswap because sudo swap you have liquidity providers that are ultimately proactively bootstrapping liquidity for both buy and sell. So if I want to dump 10 tokens, I can do that pretty seamlessly.
00:28:59.401 - 00:29:22.115, Speaker A: It almost feels like the value proposition is similar to the sniper in the early days of Gem and Genie. Right. It provides, it just provides a better user experience for people who want to buy and offer a bunch of NFTs at the same time.
00:29:22.235 - 00:30:08.307, Speaker B: Yeah, Sniper floor sweeping. I think those are all like interesting features. They'll make people buy more NFTs selling wise you can still listen, Oliver NFTs to like the sweeper feature that GEM and Genie offers, but ultimately, you know, they're just considered like more or less aggregators that were acquired by both Uniswap and. Who's the other acquisition? Uniswap and, oh, opensea. That's right. We'll talk a little bit more about that because I think that's super interesting too. But going back to Sudaswap, the analogy I'm hearing about pseudoswap is it's like Uniswap and Copper Launch all for JPEGs is like the theme that I'm hearing.
00:30:08.307 - 00:30:24.723, Speaker B: And some of the interesting stats that I started to see as well is so far the total volume since launch of the amm, which was probably like less than a month ago, was $30 million in total trading volume, which is interesting.
00:30:24.779 - 00:30:29.441, Speaker A: How much market share is that? Because the entire market went down in terms of trading volume.
00:30:29.553 - 00:30:48.245, Speaker B: I don't have the exact numbers, but I think it was like 10, 15% of OpenSea's trading volume. Very meaningful. In fact, they've surpassed LooksRare and I believe X2, Y2, which is the other NFT marketplace. This is all without incentives, by the way. Yeah.
00:30:48.705 - 00:30:50.913, Speaker A: And looks rare used incentives.
00:30:50.969 - 00:31:12.921, Speaker B: A shit ton of incentives. Not only that, they had, I don't know, like every NFT influence in the world that backed the project publicly. Right. Whereas with Sudo swap, like this is what I'd say, like, if you want to know you have product market fit in crypto, launch a product without incentives, that's it. And I think pseudoswap did it.
00:31:12.993 - 00:31:53.789, Speaker A: Yeah. By the way, to that point, we have a couple founders who build different types of product, you know, AMMs or NFT marketplaces or whatever, and they basically try to copy an existing product with real product market fit, but with a token. And I just tell them, don't do that. You're never going to know if you have real product market fit if you just do that. And most likely they're not. You're not going to have real product market fit because the product itself is not 10x better without the token. The token at some point will run out of fuel and your product is gonna.
00:31:53.789 - 00:31:54.405, Speaker A: Is gonna be dead.
00:31:54.445 - 00:32:23.175, Speaker B: So I'll name out two protocols that did this really well, DYDX and Arbitrum. I mean, Arbitrum's TVL is skyrocketing and they don't have a token yet. So that's like sticky liquidity, in my opinion. But we'll talk about those later. Too. But the other interesting, I'd say philosophical debate came out of Sudaswap is royalty fees. Should creators get paid royalty fees?
00:32:23.295 - 00:32:36.693, Speaker A: By the way, before getting into the moral philosophical argument, how much of the success of sudo sop do you think can be attributed to the 0% royalty?
00:32:36.776 - 00:32:40.814, Speaker B: Well, it's cheaper for me to buy NFTs and Sudaswap.
00:32:40.897 - 00:32:48.405, Speaker A: Yeah, right. What about compared to like x to y2 and the other marketplaces?
00:32:48.905 - 00:33:27.733, Speaker B: Yeah. So here's some interesting stats, right? So OpenSea charges 2.5% take rate, which is expensive. Right. And then you have gas fees and then you have creator royalty fees and it all adds up. I remember like I sold an NFT and like I had to pay six figures in fees, which really hurts. And so for me, the value proposition is circumventing those features or those fees and then being able to retain more of the value of the nft.
00:33:27.829 - 00:34:11.735, Speaker A: I think we saw something similar in the Solana ecosystem as well with Yah, that's which is like 10, 15% of the market share of Magic Eden. And by the way, it's really interesting that in a poly market, no one cared about. Well, I mean people cared about relative, but it was not a big deal. Right, but when the market is down 80%, all of a sudden if you lose another 5%, I mean, it's just, it hurts and sir me familia. It's funny that features like this are so dependent on the stage of the market.
00:34:12.475 - 00:34:15.043, Speaker B: The true product market fit is finding product and market fit in a bear market.
00:34:15.059 - 00:34:17.175, Speaker A: That's right. You're spot on.
00:34:19.115 - 00:34:58.186, Speaker B: And so pseudoswap launched at the right time, in my opinion. Some interesting things are happening. Okay, so pseudoswap, let's just say they're continuing to find success. I saw some cool things that came out of there. There's some NFT communities that are launching their own token side by side with their NFT collection. Okay, so similar to Uniswap. Okay, so if you remember 2019, 2020, a lot of these new D5 protocols that wanted to bootstrap their liquidity couldn't do so before because they wanted like they needed Coinbase or Binance or a lot of these larger exchanges to list their token.
00:34:58.186 - 00:35:32.175, Speaker B: So they didn't have retail access with Uniswap. The reason, I believe why uniswap v2v1v2 got very successful is the ability to launch tokens quickly and bootstrap liquidity. Right. And I think you could say the same for Sudaswap. Right? Like for NFT communities that want to launch their own token and their own nft, they could just use Sudaswap. Do you think that statement holds true or do you think that Uniswap can do better in launching tokens or any other thoughts behind that?
00:35:32.635 - 00:36:01.206, Speaker A: I'm a little bit skeptical about that view. I don't think OpenSea and Coinbase are in the same category. Like the fact that back in the day a lot of fundable tokens weren't on Coinbase. I don't think that's equivalent to OpenSea. Because you can still list token. You can still list NFTs on OpenSea pretty easily. Right.
00:36:01.206 - 00:36:08.020, Speaker A: Compared to Coinbase, it's a relatively more permissionless marketplace. Yeah.
00:36:08.156 - 00:36:26.997, Speaker B: So OpenSea, you got to have a collection. A collection Approved. Right. By OpenSea. So if I'm, let's say I'm bored apes creator, I have to contact OpenSea to create a verified collections page. Once you have that, then you can upload and sell your.
00:36:27.061 - 00:36:35.389, Speaker A: But what I mean is, like with NFTs, there's less of a security slot issue, which is the case with funded by tokens.
00:36:35.437 - 00:36:36.145, Speaker B: That's right.
00:36:37.205 - 00:36:46.515, Speaker A: Listing on coinbase, listing a fungible token on Coinbase, it's much less permissionless due to the security swap problem.
00:36:46.975 - 00:36:55.455, Speaker B: You're arguing securities and why it's easier for Uniswap to win shares because Coinbase and other exchanges have to go through this regulatory hurdle.
00:36:55.495 - 00:36:56.155, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:36:56.735 - 00:37:03.475, Speaker B: Although Coinbase and Bitbinance went on an interesting tour the past 12 months by listing, they did.
00:37:05.145 - 00:37:15.765, Speaker A: Oh yeah. Back to the philosophical debate, the moral debate about royalty versus no royalty. What do you think? Should creators impose a royalty?
00:37:16.265 - 00:38:02.697, Speaker B: Yes, they should, but it should be aligned with KPIs of the creators and where the creators are taking the community forward. I've seen some NFT communities where the creators dipped and like rugged the users. I've seen some communities that have become zombie communities where you'll see some tweets here and there, but you wouldn't see much expectations from the creator itself. And so I think there should be an alignment of royalty fees, KPIs that are, you know, more or less decided by the community and the creators so that there is, you know, growth for both sides. Otherwise, I think it's just going to be a shitshow.
00:38:02.881 - 00:38:38.829, Speaker A: I think that's exactly right. I don't think this whole argument should be escalated into a moral one. It's not a moral argument. Like this whole royalty thing is just the contract between the buyer and the seller. It's the contract between the NFT buyer and the NFT creator. As long as it's a contract, the outcome will be taken care of by the market. If as a creator you set too high of a royalty fee, then maybe your buyers will not play the game and you're not going to be able to make much money off of it.
00:38:38.829 - 00:39:01.571, Speaker A: And if you set the royalty too low, yeah, there will be players playing the game, but you're not going to be able to make money either. So at the end of the day, the market will try to find an equilibrium. And at the end of the day, the market is just a contract between the buyer and the seller. So it's entirely a pragmatic argument, not a moral argument in my opinion.
00:39:01.763 - 00:39:57.591, Speaker B: So x2 y2, which is the other NFT platform that's doing decently well, they distribute 100% of the revenues to their token holders, which I thought was very interesting. And they just announced a couple days ago that they're going to allow the community to decide whether or not the creators could get royalty fees. And so they left down the community, but they did make like 1 to 1 NFTs royalties mandatory. So if someone creates this very NFT that's just one of one, then that's mandatory royalty fees. So what's happening is, what we're seeing in the X2 Y2 space at least is people are making some collections optional. So if you decide that you want to give creators the fee, you can, you don't have to like a tip. And I think that's an okay approach.
00:39:57.591 - 00:40:02.935, Speaker B: I don't know, I guess for where we are today, but yeah, I don't know how I feel about that.
00:40:03.055 - 00:40:38.885, Speaker A: I think maybe just for our listeners, the cause of all this debate, all this drama around royalty is the fact that NFT creators cannot impose, cannot enforce royalty. Right. Due to the design of the NFT standards. And up until now it's really the marketplaces that sort of impose a royalty. In the ideal world, I think you should be the creator that sets the royalty and then let the market take care of itself. I think that's what should happen in an ideal world.
00:40:39.005 - 00:41:05.643, Speaker B: I agree. I think creators should get the rewards. You have the free writing problem, right? Which is you have these like you have some creators that don't really are there, aren't incentivized or pressured to do anything and they'll just continue to earn money while they sit on the couch. Right. And so I do worry about making sure creators are incentivized and aligned with the community in a way that's going to be long term.
00:41:05.749 - 00:41:06.607, Speaker A: I agree with that.
00:41:06.711 - 00:42:06.879, Speaker B: There are some standards that came out royalty, so there's an NFT standard EIP2981 that ultimately allows people to create NFT royalties. And so in the future you could see people moving to the standard, which I think was created by recur. And so I think we'll start to see a market shift where standards will probably be used in place. But I think more pressure will need to come from the community to make sure that creators are actually doing their job. Going back to Sudaswap one more time. So you have OpenSea, that's very successful Magic En and let's say now Sudoswap. What can you do with sudo swap that you cannot do with OpenSea? Why is this exciting having on chain smart contracts that facilitate NFT trading? Why does this matter? You know, you can draw examples with Uniswap or you could talk about composability with an other NFT or other defi protocols.
00:42:06.879 - 00:42:14.143, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'm curious on why sudo swap and why on chain versus like opensea.
00:42:14.279 - 00:42:27.445, Speaker A: This is a really good question. I haven't thought about this. I've always thought it was the sweeping, the zero reality, but I haven't thought about the composability part. What have you, what do you think?
00:42:27.945 - 00:43:20.715, Speaker B: I've thought a little bit about it. Not enough. But I do think having. I think it'll bring to the market very liquid and more depth to NFT liquidity, which is great in my opinion and that can create much more quicker transactions. So if I want to, I don't know, acquire 20 board apes quickly and then collateralize it on a NFT platform, NFT lending platform, and then borrow against it, I could do that right now. It'll take me, I don't know, a couple days, weeks, I don't know, to get the right pricing for my assets. So I do think once there's more depth in these pools and the liquidity is right for like or the pricing is right for NFTs.
00:43:20.715 - 00:43:29.375, Speaker B: I do think there could be some interesting transactions that you could do in a way that would be very capital efficient.
00:43:29.455 - 00:43:47.839, Speaker A: The counterargument to that is I haven't seen many people use their uniswap position tokens, LP tokens, LP tokens, I don't know, collateral to do something else or as another type of composable position to do something else.
00:43:48.007 - 00:43:49.191, Speaker B: Why do you think that is?
00:43:49.303 - 00:43:50.955, Speaker A: I just don't think it's that Useful.
00:43:51.335 - 00:44:14.081, Speaker B: Do you think it's just bootstrapping the liquidity for the LP side as well? Because I think that's a whole different dilemma as well and it just gets very convoluted. So. Yeah, no, totally agreed. What could be cool is if pseudoswab was to get volume, like incredible. Let's just say it continues the growth factor here. You could probably create an interesting. Like you could create an Oracle.
00:44:14.081 - 00:44:32.633, Speaker B: Right. I think based on the pools that you have. Right. With Sudaswap, I think the only NFT Oracle that's out right now is by Chainlink and I'm not sure how the pricing works on it yet. I haven't looked into it.
00:44:32.689 - 00:44:37.413, Speaker A: That's a good point. It would be like an on chain, fully on chain Oracle.
00:44:37.529 - 00:45:16.795, Speaker B: Yeah. And that could be very interesting to bootstrap other products. So I think we still have a lot, a long way to go before we see all these products come into fruition. But I will say I'm pretty excited about Sudaswap. And then the moral dilemma around, you know, 0% fees I think will get solved over time. You know, it'll have to be aligned in alignment with the community and the creators. So there was this interesting article that was published by Lawrence Stefanian, who is one of the partners at Pantera, and she talked about the optimal token vesting strategies that should be done by founders.
00:45:16.795 - 00:45:21.327, Speaker B: Do you want to talk a bit about that or I can kind of give some background.
00:45:21.351 - 00:45:49.479, Speaker A: I mean, I saw the article. I think the takeaway. Yeah, one of my main takeaways was that the optimal lockup period should be like 6 months or something. And both 0 month lockup and 12 month lockup are less optimal in terms of impact on the token price. I think that's interesting. But what I'm skeptical about is whether or not that study had enough data points to make this statistically significant. I actually don't know how many data points they have.
00:45:49.567 - 00:46:19.285, Speaker B: I think they also put on the. Or Lauren put on the article that this is based on minimal data sources, but let's look through it. Right. So she also said a couple. They also point out a couple of things, right. One is on average 15% of the tokens from the startup's treasury gets allocated to investors. The average lockup period 2x since 2018 and the average lockup now is 2 years.
00:46:19.285 - 00:46:38.508, Speaker B: Wow. So you lived in a world, let's say pre crypto world, where people's lockup periods were four years, 10 years. Well, I mean, yeah, you have four.
00:46:38.566 - 00:46:41.423, Speaker A: Years investing and then 10 years to go. IPO.
00:46:41.519 - 00:47:13.591, Speaker B: Yeah. And so you have long term committed investors. Let's explore this dynamic. So this is pretty exciting because it kind of tells you where the traditional equity spaces or the traditional startup spaces and where we are in crypto. The traditional startup space you had found or you had investors that were heavily committed to these, the success of these founders. So the startup fund sizes were pretty small, like small relative to where we are today. I don't know, let's say $100 million.
00:47:13.591 - 00:47:50.947, Speaker B: And I'm just putting that out there, I think probably $100 million was the average. Right. And they would make, I don't know, let's say 50 investments. And those 50 investments would come into fruition over a period of 10 years. So over the period of 10 years, the founders in this VC firm, the VC firms would have to give it all they got for over the 10 years so that they could bear the fruit of the IPO once they were successful. And mind you, this percentage of startups, that IPO is very, very small in each portfolio. So you may have like three to five big wins and then the rest are marked to zero.
00:47:50.947 - 00:48:20.005, Speaker B: Or there's some like, let's just say they zero out. And now you have startups that are getting, I mean you have everyone that has a billion dollar five hundred million to a billion dollar fund. An example, you have startups that are getting investments quickly and they are bringing liquidity to their tokens quickly. And you have lockup periods that are zero to two years. Explain this dynamic to me, Chow.
00:48:21.065 - 00:48:25.845, Speaker A: There's just no long term commitment from both the founder and the investors.
00:48:26.185 - 00:48:31.785, Speaker B: And what do you like, what's the impact? What impacts are you seeing?
00:48:31.865 - 00:49:09.429, Speaker A: The impact is as an industry, we can't build real products that people use because real products that people use do not take only two years to build. They take fucking 10 years. It doesn't matter how permissionless, how Turing complete this blockchain thing is, it takes 10 years to build a really good product. And I think that's why up until now we haven't seen any real mainstream products in crypto yet. I think it's a big deal. It's a big problem. Neither the investor nor the founder are committed for building a product that can last decades because both parties can dump their tokens on retail within two years.
00:49:09.597 - 00:49:20.061, Speaker B: On the investor side makes a lot of sense, right? Well, where you have ultimately, you know, I'm not saying all investors like this, let's just say a small percentage of.
00:49:20.133 - 00:49:22.345, Speaker A: I think it's A big, I think it's a big percentage.
00:49:23.645 - 00:50:03.617, Speaker B: But yeah, I was trying to be very, very conservative. I'm being nice. Okay, let's say a large part of investors are doing this and they know that they're willingly doing this because now they have liquidity. Are investors just here to make money? Like obviously the name of the game for investors is to be long term capital partners and to help support founders in the success and the hurdles that they go through over a long period of time. Now you have this interesting dynamic where you have liquidity events that are much more quickly. People are making much more money very quickly. Is there enough incentives for investors to support founders? Because now it seems like every investor is just trying to get go after the next.
00:50:03.721 - 00:50:21.033, Speaker A: Basically that turns investors who are supposed to help founders into active portfolio managers, into liquid market traders, into timing the market. It's a huge incentive disalignment.
00:50:21.129 - 00:50:40.277, Speaker B: And that's why we're saying at least this last cycle we saw almost every trading firm started investing in venture capital. So we're seeing a convergence between like VCs that are becoming more or less like trading firms. Right? Because for them not to take the risk, it's, you know, it's bad on.
00:50:40.301 - 00:51:12.689, Speaker A: Their, let's say almost, almost every VC that I know of also trades the public market. Like they actually have like two or at least two portfolios to manage. One is the venture portfolio and the other one is the public tokens portfolio. And the skillset to manage both in the traditional world is very different. But in crypto it's like almost one and the same which is timing the market. When do you dump?
00:51:12.817 - 00:51:45.253, Speaker B: So that's a huge mentality change. Right now you're looking at, you know, you're supposed to invest and believe in the founders for the next 10 years. Instead you're getting short term, heavily incentivized events that ultimately creates this disalignment between the long term future of the project versus long term future of the investors are supposed to support them. And I think that's a problem in the space.
00:51:45.379 - 00:52:26.295, Speaker A: It's not only a problem for the investors, even the founders, like I've talked to like a couple of weeks ago one of our founders told us that they think that their tokens are a liability. They think their tokens are like in the sense that number one it has implications with respect to securities laws and number two, the token price going down is a huge distraction for the team and for their community. Like I. That's only one example. Like this is one founder who told us this precise thing that they think that tokens are liabilities. But I know many other founders are getting distracted all the time by the token price.
00:52:26.635 - 00:53:03.367, Speaker B: The token is the cons, is the feedback loop from the community. Like that's like, it's like a short term feedback loop from the community that gives them the idea of what the sentiment is for their product or for traction and for founders to continue to worry about the token price takes away from the product and the product development which then becomes all about pumpability, like new news, new partnerships, new acquisitions, which then turns founders into like, I don't know, promoters. I mean, I wouldn't call them promoters.
00:53:03.431 - 00:53:17.129, Speaker A: But a lot of these things don't contribute to product building at all. Right? Like they don't make your product better product. Like a lot of the marketing and partnerships are entirely superfluous at the beginning, like in the early stage of a product, you know, startup building.
00:53:17.217 - 00:53:48.573, Speaker B: I worry about that. I worry about that because let's say startup X, startup X raises, I don't know, X amount of money. Then they release their token soon after, six months later in a bull market and their token like 20x's and now they have a billion dollars in their treasury. And so, and let's, let's just say they used, they sold off the treasury and they have like a billion dollars in, in, in, in capital now they could use that capital to continue to grow the product and team. What do you think about that?
00:53:48.669 - 00:54:41.485, Speaker A: You know what, one of the biggest mistakes I've made in the 2017 cycle was to invest in a few big name projects that I raised a shit ton of money. And with way too much money on your balance sheet as a founder, you basically lose all sense of urgency. You just can't ship anymore. I won't name names, but I made several of these mistakes back in the day. So nowadays when I talk to founders, oftentimes if I see that they're trying to raise a lot of money, I will ask them why are they raising that much money? And by the way, this is one of the reasons why when FEI pitched us, we passed like there was no good answer for why they were raising that much money. It's a problem like when the founders is too rich, when the company has too big of a balance sheet, there's no more sense of urgency.
00:54:41.825 - 00:55:35.159, Speaker B: I think this all goes back to governance, supporting, having the right guardrails, how much capital should be raised by founders and is there enough guardrails in place to support these founders as they're growing up and building the product. I think that's all very important. There's another effect with the tokens becoming liquid quickly, which is. You mentioned this earlier, which is not enough incentives for the founders. And so we're starting to see, like, zombie companies, which is the founders got too rich and they don't care. They will tweet every day. You know, and this is the same problem with the NFT side, right, with the creator fees, which is, you know, they're not incentivized to work anymore.
00:55:35.159 - 00:56:13.241, Speaker B: They have money, they're rich, and they're going to go out and do something else. And I think that's also a very big issue. Look at Airbnb. What did Paul Graham call them? Like cockroaches, right? Like they were able to survive through the bear market of 2008 and they sold fucking cereal boxes to keep the lights on at Airbnb. And now if you look at them, you know, they're synonymous with hotels. And if you don't have that grit, like, if you can't build that grit and that resilience early on, then you can't, you can't be a worldwide company.
00:56:13.393 - 00:56:38.645, Speaker A: And by the way, I. When we alliance went out to raise money towards the end of last year, one investor, I think it was Garrett, asked us, why are you raising only this much money? You could have raised an order of magnitude more money. And our answer was, we don't want that much money. We wanted enough sense of urgency.
00:56:38.765 - 00:56:39.189, Speaker B: That's right.
00:56:39.237 - 00:56:45.083, Speaker A: There's absolutely no need to have too much money and have no plan to use that money.
00:56:45.259 - 00:57:52.567, Speaker B: Okay, you bring up another point, which is VC firms that have, I don't know, 500 million to $4 billion in funds, the problem they run into is that as you raise more capital for every investment they make, it has to be meaningful for them. So if they don't invest, I don't know, let's say 10 to 20 million dollars in a startup, then they're not going to get the economics that work well for them. So you have this conundrum, right? Like you have VC firms that are flush with capital, and you have these startup founders that have never raised money in their world or never managed their own money at that scale. They're getting 10 to $20 million. And then you have this whole dislocation of how the founders are going to use that money in a productive way. And then they, you know, and then the whole system is designed so that the tokens become the central part of the product. And I think found crypto founders are losing Focus.
00:57:52.711 - 00:58:05.289, Speaker A: I'm really annoyed when investors that co invest with us, some investors, push our startups to launch tokens ASAP as opposed to building the fucking product. I'm really fucking annoyed.
00:58:05.377 - 00:58:12.113, Speaker B: You know, I think there should be a mandatory four year, no token. Don't even talk about the token for the first four years.
00:58:12.289 - 00:58:48.951, Speaker A: Yeah. By the way, there's obviously exceptions to this just for our listeners. Like there are several cases where if the token is the product, then you absolutely want to focus your time on the token itself. Right. So in the case of played our own games, in the case of stable coins, in the case of even layer ones, where if you don't have a token, there's no way to incentivize early stakers or miners, in these cases, the token is the product and it makes perfect sense to focus your energy on those things. But in the majority of situations, it.
00:58:48.983 - 00:59:26.195, Speaker B: Makes no sense even for gaming and others. As long as you have the right guardrails, then it's fine. Right, but the problem is the industry doesn't have enough standards or guardrails in place that actually protect both the founder investor and the community. We're still using safe agreements from a decade ago that was pioneered by YC and others, and we're still using that with the token warrant. I mean, it works fine for now, but I don't know if those types of agreements will protect crypto investors and crypto founders and the community at large.
00:59:27.695 - 00:59:38.475, Speaker A: Speaking of games, I was trying to enjoy my weekend and you made me watch this three hour podcast between Zach and Joe Rogan.
00:59:39.055 - 00:59:40.535, Speaker B: It was good. Was it not good?
00:59:40.575 - 00:59:41.555, Speaker A: It was very good.
00:59:42.015 - 00:59:55.299, Speaker B: It was great. I've never heard Mark talk as who he was. It's always like, he's sweating, he looks like shit. I mean, and you don't really get his insights. What'd you think of it?
00:59:55.347 - 01:00:04.131, Speaker A: I was pretty impressed by Zuck. Like it was the first time I've ever seen Zuck speak like a human being rather than a robot.
01:00:04.243 - 01:00:06.375, Speaker B: I ordered an Oculus because of that.
01:00:07.315 - 01:00:10.699, Speaker A: Yeah. What do you think? What model did you get?
01:00:10.867 - 01:00:18.501, Speaker B: The quest 2. As I was listening to In Time, I see the future. And so, yeah, it went on Amazon.
01:00:18.533 - 01:00:19.509, Speaker A: It hasn't arrived yet.
01:00:19.637 - 01:00:21.149, Speaker B: No, it hasn't. You should get one.
01:00:21.197 - 01:00:43.981, Speaker A: I got one in 2020. I think it was a rift, by the way, AR VR. I've been bullish for almost a decade. I made a bunch of angel investments, like in 2015, and that was around. That was really a long time ago, but a lot of them didn't pan out. I think it was just too early. Some of them did okay, but they didn't actually build real products.
01:00:43.981 - 01:01:28.967, Speaker A: They made money through acquisition. Like, they were like basically startups getting acquired by giants like Facebook, right? And, you know, 2015, I thought, you know, AR VR was the future. 2020, I actually bought a Oculus, you know, in the middle of COVID you know, for remote work for, you know, connecting with my friends. But I just thought that that device was so heavy, like, there's no way this is the future. And so during that episode between Zuck and Joe Rogan, Zuck actually mentioned that Facebook is working with Ray Ban to build, like, AR VR glasses. That's pretty cool. And that reminds me of Google Glasses back in the day.
01:01:28.967 - 01:02:16.015, Speaker A: I've always thought Google Glasses was going to work because, well, I thought that the concept of AR VR glasses was going to work because it's a lot lighter than a huge ass thing that you put on your head, right? Like an Oculus. And that will just enable a lot of new behavior. Like, I can't work wiring that giant thing. I can't work and keep my head up for like hours. I can't walk around, I can't walk outside. And it's very interesting that Zuck is working with a pretty big fashion brand. So they actually want to turn this glasses thing into something fashionable rather than like some nerdy device that only people like you and I use.
01:02:16.015 - 01:02:22.003, Speaker A: They want to, they want to turn this into something mainstream. So I thought that was, that was pretty interesting. What was your takeaway?
01:02:22.139 - 01:03:18.385, Speaker B: So just touching on Ray Bans was. So he talked about, like, there's two strategies for Facebook, right? One is complete VR, which is immersive experiences versus augmented experiences, where you have glasses where you could see the world, and then you have a hologram that's superimposed onto your glasses, right through your glasses. And they call this like wave guides. And so they're special type of material instead of glasses that you'd use as a way to see through your lens. And so those are the two worlds. He thinks the two worlds are going to converge over the period of next decade. And we're going to live in a world which is like, which I think is called the Metaverse, which is ultimately, you'll see reality, then you'll also see this augmented computing reality that will give you much more data or insights around the world that you live in today.
01:03:18.385 - 01:03:43.035, Speaker B: And he thinks that's the real world. He said this specifically. He said the world that we live in today the reality isn't the real world that we live in today. And we could debate on this if you want. The real world is once computing or augmented reality aligns with us in the physical world. Because right now he argues that we're all staring on our phones all day to get the data that we need to make a decision. And that.
01:03:43.035 - 01:04:21.529, Speaker B: And that's true, right? So like I'll go to, I don't know, Target and I'll look at the price on Amazon to see what's cheaper or I'll read the reviews or I'll see what else is out there that compares to our product. A lot of it is just Internet based searching. Imagine if you wear this glasses that augments the data around me to see, to give me what I think is going to work well. And then if you add like Apple Health, then you could automatically add like data based on my own health, on what I can eat, what I can't eat. Right. So a lot of that makes a lot of sense. One thing that I got of this, which I thought was very interesting, is that he said the next project I'm going to work on is the Metaverse.
01:04:21.529 - 01:04:29.537, Speaker B: He said that throughout the entire podcast and he put a timeline on when he thinks this is going to come into fruition. Do you remember that?
01:04:29.561 - 01:04:30.965, Speaker A: I think it's a decade or something.
01:04:32.385 - 01:04:49.681, Speaker B: That's right. Very interesting because today in the crypto world we talk about the Metaverse if it's already happening or if it's going to happen very soon, but in reality it's going to take a decade or two before this comes into fruition. What are your thoughts on that?
01:04:49.753 - 01:05:45.545, Speaker A: It feels like the timeline is pretty reasonable. Like I said two years ago, I thought the Oculus that I used was nowhere near mass adoption. What I find interesting is Zuck's core argument for the AR VR is that it's the first type of computing device where you can truly feel that you are in the same room as the other person. And it's a device that is designed from first principles for that very reason. All the devices before including your PC and your mobile device are not designed for presence to feel that the other person is present in the same room. You know, PC was invented for like, I don't know, like calculators or something. And mobile was designed for like calling.
01:05:45.545 - 01:06:02.487, Speaker A: Calling people. Neither. Like, if you do, like you and I are on a zoom. Like, let's say you and I are on a zoom right now through our computer. Neither of us feel like we're in the Same room. Right. So PC is not designed for that.
01:06:02.487 - 01:06:51.541, Speaker A: And so that's why Zach is so excited about AR VR. And he's more important. He's excited about it because up until now, all the things that he worked on, whether it's Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram, were things that were going to, that were already going to take off. Like when they acquired Instagram or WhatsApp, the core user group was small, but they were on a really good trajectory and there was a very clear final destination for those apps. Whereas in the case of AR VR, it hasn't hockey stick yet. It's going to take many years of effort to get to that point. So I thought that was pretty interesting.
01:06:51.541 - 01:06:53.945, Speaker A: But it's also in line with my personal experience.
01:06:54.365 - 01:07:28.047, Speaker B: You know, in crypto, we talk a lot about the Metaverse. What is it going to be? How are we going to interact with it? What would give Metaverse? How do we get the Metaverse to the entire globe? How do we get this idea, this concept, this world that we live in? Is it through a computing platform? Is it through the, the attraction of what the Metaverse offers? How do we get the metaverse to 8 billion users all over the world?
01:07:28.151 - 01:08:55.529, Speaker A: I thought about the intersection of Metaverse and crypto during the podcast. And the part of the podcast that led me to think about this was when Zach mentioned that in the their equivalent of App Store for their AR VR device in the early days, the top downloads were gaming, which is also in line with what many crypto people think was the first mass adopted crypto app was going to be. But over time, gaming was slowly replaced by general purpose social apps on their App Store. And that made me think about Web3Social. And the thing that came to mind was I feel like the world of social is going to a place where the amount of computing is going to only get larger and larger. Like we have examples of AR VR, but we also have examples in TikTok for instance. TikTok is a very different product from Twitter in the sense that Twitter is mostly based on social graph, right? Like the content you see in your feed is based on the people that you follow.
01:08:55.529 - 01:10:00.333, Speaker A: But TikTok is not that. TikTok is based on your interest graph, what you're interested in and the way TikTok knows what you're interested in and is using like really large amount of compute to do artificial intelligence and machine learning on your history of views on other information, other kind of activity or behavior that you demonstrate on their on the app. Okay, so TikTok is really machine learning based and machine learning requires a huge amount of computer and it's similar to AR VR, like the amount of graphics to give you the AAA kind of graphical feel. You need a lot of computing power. And crypto is just not there yet. Right now we can barely build a Twitter which is based on social graphs and based on text messages. We can barely build Twitter on crypto.
01:10:00.333 - 01:10:42.785, Speaker A: Right. Like I've used Forecaster, you've used Forecaster. And my personal experience is it's not like the experience there is not as good as Twitter yet. And it's certainly the case that not all the information is stored on chain. So the world is going to a place where more and more successful social apps are going to require more computer. And then it becomes a race between the leading social apps and our development in crypto in terms of scalability. Will the scalability of crypto eventually catch up to the advances in social apps? I'm worried about that.
01:10:43.245 - 01:11:16.715, Speaker B: Yeah, I worry about that too. I mean, you have eth2 that's coming around the corner. You have Solana and, and other great layer ones that are prioritizing on like, you know, both scalability, transactions, throughput, et cetera and, and I'm not sure yet. Right. Because you know, we just battle tested Salon and other layer ones and now they're refactoring it to improve throughput. You have E2 that's coming around the corner that's going to ultimately use L2s as a way to scale. And then you have like starkware, that's.
01:11:16.715 - 01:11:45.925, Speaker B: That started thinking about like layer threes through like recursive. Recursive roll ups. Layer twos. So yeah, recursive roll ups. Thank you. And what's really cool about like that is like, you know, as the project scales, you can continue upscale through roll ups. So there are some interesting, you know, ideas that are out there, but I feel like compared to the real world where traction is like exponential, I don't know if we're seeing the same type of growth in terms of innovation.
01:11:46.705 - 01:12:08.805, Speaker A: Yeah. Which leads to SUI and aptos, which at some point we need to talk about, but not today. But we should probably get the founders of those two projects on our podcast and talk about how they compare to existing to the incumbents, the EVM and the Solana ecosystems.
01:12:09.695 - 01:12:17.135, Speaker B: We're probably going to have them on soon. So for listeners, expect SUI and Aptos.
01:12:17.175 - 01:12:19.151, Speaker A: To talk to us about. Pretty excited about it.
01:12:19.223 - 01:12:47.929, Speaker B: Same, same. Well, I think this was a great convo. I think we touched on a lot of interesting trends that we're starting to see in crypto and just generally some problems that we're going through. Although, like, you know, we're being pretty critical about some of the things that we're talking about. I'm incredibly bullish in the crypto space. I'm excited that all these things are happening now versus later because it gives us the ability to solve it. And that's a lot of things that we're working on within the alliance.
01:12:47.977 - 01:13:02.977, Speaker A: I mean, ultimately just follow the developers and we at alliance, we're seeing record number of really strong developers and builders applying and joining our industry. So very bullish.
01:13:03.121 - 01:13:12.753, Speaker B: Very bullish. Agreed. All right, well, thank you guys for listening. Catch us in a couple weeks with our new podcast. Really appreciate the time. Thanks, everyone.
01:13:12.849 - 01:13:13.565, Speaker A: Take care.
01:13:14.065 - 01:13:17.785, Speaker B: Thanks for listening to Good Game. Don't forget to subscribe. We'll see you next week.
