00:00:00.120 - 00:00:29.716, Speaker A: Defi, there's, let's say, two groups of users. There's the retail users and there's the bots. And as a retail user, chances are your counterpart is the bots. On average, the bots make money and you as a retail user, you lose money, but it's fine because you play the game. For the dopamine rush, most people are fine with playing the game, this defi game, even if they lose money. And so I think something similar could happen with crypto games, which is that you're still gonna have two different game modes. One game mode for bots and one game mode for retail users.
00:00:29.716 - 00:00:40.492, Speaker A: And they have different goals within this game. And then the job of the game developer is to creatively find the two game modes for these two different types of user Personas that they can still play against each other.
00:00:40.588 - 00:00:59.364, Speaker B: Or they can play against other bots, right? And then that comes kind of similar to, like, Dark Forest, where you have just bots against bots, and then it really is based on who designed the bots and how competitive are the bots with each other. This brings an enormous amount of developer resources. Right. And developers into these types of games. And games could become very powerful over time.
