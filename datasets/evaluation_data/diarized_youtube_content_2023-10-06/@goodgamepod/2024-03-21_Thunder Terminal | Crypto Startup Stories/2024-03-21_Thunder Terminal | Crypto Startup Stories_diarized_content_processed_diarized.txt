00:00:04.120 - 00:00:13.198, Speaker A: Today we have Jackson, the founder of Thunder Terminal, to talk to us a bit about what he's learned building a crypto startup. Jackson, what are you building?
00:00:13.286 - 00:00:13.582, Speaker B: Right now?
00:00:13.598 - 00:00:19.478, Speaker C: We're trying to build a trading platform on chain that lends the same user experience as you might have with like.
00:00:19.566 - 00:00:22.326, Speaker D: Coinbase or finance or any of the sort.
00:00:22.470 - 00:00:25.636, Speaker A: What's one thing that you've learned while you were building this product?
00:00:25.750 - 00:00:28.896, Speaker C: One of the main takeaways I had was that crypto index is way too.
00:00:28.920 - 00:00:32.208, Speaker D: Hard on the tech and that's fine to do, but the issue is that.
00:00:32.296 - 00:00:40.488, Speaker C: All of Defi in aggregate has less users than some note taking apps on the App Store. So until there's user adoption, what's the tech good for?
00:00:40.576 - 00:00:41.176, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:00:41.240 - 00:00:43.432, Speaker C: That's one of the main takeaways most definitely.
00:00:43.568 - 00:00:50.512, Speaker A: How do you think about sourcing feedback from customers and users, especially being that it's much harder to reach them versus.
00:00:50.608 - 00:00:53.146, Speaker D: Traditional web two, we have communities on.
00:00:53.170 - 00:00:59.026, Speaker C: Like Telegram and Discord, and I usually get DM's on Twitter or those respective apps as well.
00:00:59.130 - 00:01:00.538, Speaker D: I think like, you know, the community.
00:01:00.586 - 00:01:14.314, Speaker C: Is pretty vocal about stuff they want. But to be frank, a lot of our developers and myself included, also use the application and our traders by trade. So we don't need to source too much user feedback to know sort of what the next thing is to build.
00:01:14.394 - 00:01:15.666, Speaker A: So you dog food your own product?
00:01:15.770 - 00:01:16.994, Speaker B: Yeah, pretty much.
00:01:17.114 - 00:01:21.406, Speaker A: What's one lesson that you've learned that you want to give to future founders or building the space?
00:01:21.570 - 00:01:24.222, Speaker D: Try to build a business as opposed.
00:01:24.278 - 00:01:32.606, Speaker C: To just like a token launchpad. I think incentives are kind of misaligned in crypto, where founders effectively are able to IPo at any point in time.
00:01:32.630 - 00:01:37.150, Speaker D: Whatever they want, like an IPO equivalent, and that's fine, but you should build something sustainable.
00:01:37.222 - 00:01:39.222, Speaker B: I think that's like one of the.
00:01:39.238 - 00:01:42.574, Speaker C: Things I very rarely see in crypto is something that lasts more than a single cycle.
00:01:42.654 - 00:01:43.878, Speaker B: It's very rare.
00:01:44.046 - 00:01:53.970, Speaker A: Obviously, crypto is a very volatile market. Some days you have really good days, some days you have really bad days. Given that you're building a on chain trading terminal, how do you take this?
00:01:54.082 - 00:01:56.418, Speaker D: I'll be frank. A lot of people come to me.
00:01:56.426 - 00:02:08.442, Speaker C: And they're like, oh, you know, x tangentially competitive product has like y feature or does this amount in volume or whatever it is? But the truth is, like, I've been talking to some of the folks that we've been working with recently and I.
00:02:08.458 - 00:02:10.698, Speaker B: Realized that we just are really the.
00:02:10.706 - 00:02:17.078, Speaker C: Only project reinvesting back into itself and not taking money off the table. I have the utmost respect for lifestyle.
00:02:17.126 - 00:02:24.142, Speaker D: Businesses, but they aren't necessarily sustainable in the highest growth stages. They work to a point.
00:02:24.238 - 00:02:26.358, Speaker B: So I would say that back to.
00:02:26.366 - 00:02:36.062, Speaker C: The thing I mentioned regarding sustainability and making it through multiple cycles. I realize that in a bull run, being cash flow positive isn't very useful. So we're pretty much going balls to.
00:02:36.078 - 00:02:39.646, Speaker D: The wall in this just to ensure that we do last multiple cycles as.
00:02:39.750 - 00:02:41.756, Speaker C: A cemented project that people go to.
00:02:41.870 - 00:02:45.352, Speaker D: And are familiarized with and trust. I think, like, right now is the.
00:02:45.368 - 00:02:46.072, Speaker C: Time to scale up.
00:02:46.088 - 00:02:51.960, Speaker D: It's not the time to take cash off the table. And not a single project that's competitive with us is doing that.
00:02:52.072 - 00:02:54.296, Speaker B: None that I'm aware of. You're going all in.
00:02:54.360 - 00:02:57.416, Speaker A: I think that is probably the right move, coming to a bull market.
00:02:57.560 - 00:02:59.216, Speaker D: Yeah, pretty much all in.
00:02:59.280 - 00:03:01.632, Speaker C: All ships on the table. We'll see what the river cards are.
00:03:01.648 - 00:03:03.496, Speaker B: I don't know yet, but, yeah, we're.
00:03:03.520 - 00:03:04.880, Speaker D: Going balls to the wall on this.
00:03:04.992 - 00:03:05.304, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:03:05.344 - 00:03:06.744, Speaker A: Jackson, thank you so much for your time.
00:03:06.824 - 00:03:07.744, Speaker B: For sure. Appreciate it.
