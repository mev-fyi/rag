So the technical part is part of reasons why ordinals are happening now. But I think there's another, softer but social reason, is that at the time of the first attempts at NFTs on bitcoin, NFTs was not really a commonly accepted thing, like people weren't comfortable with the idea of NFTs. 2021 was really the year that the entire world got comfortable with this idea of NFTs digitally stored non fungible tokens. And so there's really a social element there where people are now comfortable with this idea. And people really need this new phenomenon of NFTs to bring developer activity back onto the bitcoin blockchain.
