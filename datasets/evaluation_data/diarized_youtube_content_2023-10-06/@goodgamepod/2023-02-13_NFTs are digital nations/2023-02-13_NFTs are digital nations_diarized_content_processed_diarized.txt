00:00:00.160 - 00:00:02.710, Speaker A: What do you think about genitive art? I don't get art.
00:00:02.862 - 00:00:03.678, Speaker UNK: I don't get art.
00:00:03.726 - 00:00:05.286, Speaker A: As. As nfTs.
00:00:05.350 - 00:00:06.310, Speaker UNK: I don't have the collector.
00:00:06.342 - 00:00:33.912, Speaker A: Gene that you do. A lot of my friends who were in NFT early did have that collector gene. The only NFts I really hold myself is punks and apes. But I don't view punks as generative art. I view punks as really this digital identity, digitally native identity. Sometimes I feel like NFTs are more like Daos than Daos are. Most Daos we know of today are, they have like a fungible token as their core way to share ownership and to distribute power, voting power.
00:00:33.912 - 00:00:56.264, Speaker A: But I view NFTs even more as Daos than the current Daos are because they offer something extra, which is the identity, the NFT. They're unique, right? Unlike fungible tokens, by definition they're not unique. They're fungible with each other. And so this identity creates a sense of belonging to this digital nation. You really feel like you're a part of it, and you can express yourself to the outside world.
