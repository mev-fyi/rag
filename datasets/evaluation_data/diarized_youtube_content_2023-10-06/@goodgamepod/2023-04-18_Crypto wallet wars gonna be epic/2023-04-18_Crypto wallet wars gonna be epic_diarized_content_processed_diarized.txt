00:00:00.160 - 00:00:31.906, Speaker A: So basically, in my mind, two years from now, the wallet war is going to be as dramatic and as epic as the layer one wars in crypto. Basically, there's two things that will matter in two years. The wars between the layer ones and the wars between the wallets. These two layers happen to be the ones that will capture the most value two to five years from now. Basically, the single most consumer facing layer and the most programmable, the most general, the most low level layer. So it's sort of at the two extremes of the same spectrum. The most high level and the most low level.
00:00:31.906 - 00:00:34.714, Speaker A: And everyone in between will get squeezed by these two layers.
