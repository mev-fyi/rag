00:00:00.160 - 00:00:03.830, Speaker A: Did you know that Metamask wanted to do a browser in browser first?
00:00:03.942 - 00:00:04.686, Speaker B: What does that mean?
00:00:04.750 - 00:00:23.502, Speaker A: Like, Internet browser. Right. So they wanted to launch a browser within a browser. That was their first foray into metamask, but they quickly decided that isn't going to work, and it should be some sort of extension that sits on top of chrome. And that's the route they went. They saw, like, there's just different ways you could interact with Ethereum at the time.
00:00:23.598 - 00:00:24.742, Speaker B: Well, there was one other way that.
00:00:24.758 - 00:00:37.424, Speaker A: They were thinking about, which is, like, delegating your private key to adapt. But at that time, dapps could be very malicious, and delegating your private key to adapt could result in, obviously, loss of funds.
