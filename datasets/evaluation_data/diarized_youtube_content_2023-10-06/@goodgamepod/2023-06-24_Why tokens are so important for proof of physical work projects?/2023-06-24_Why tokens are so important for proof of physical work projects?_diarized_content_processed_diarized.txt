00:00:00.160 - 00:00:42.644, Speaker A: We haven't really answered the question of why do we want to use tokens in bootstrapping these networks? Because for the longest time, for the past ten years, most products that did involve a token turn out to be ones that actually never needed a token. Tokens turn out to be just a way for them to monetize their work, but it was never absolutely necessary for the network itself. Why are tokens so important? Because you and I have been critiqued of the use of tokens in the vast majority of early stage crypto products. But my view is that for proof of physical work products, tokens are actually absolutely necessary. They're part of the product itself. They are the product, and it's absolutely paramount to prioritize token design over everything else.
