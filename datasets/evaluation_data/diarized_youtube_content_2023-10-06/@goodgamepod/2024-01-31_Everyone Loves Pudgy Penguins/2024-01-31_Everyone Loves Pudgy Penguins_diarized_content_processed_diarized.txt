00:00:00.200 - 00:00:16.878, Speaker A: This is a perfect example. Pudgy penguins has a general appeal. Everyone loves it. My kids love it. Anyone I share with say it's cute. I recently went to Malaysia, visited family there, and my family has no idea about crypto at all. As soon as I landed, they sent me a gif, and it was a pudgy penguins.
00:00:16.878 - 00:00:32.194, Speaker A: Welcome to Malaysia, Gif. And I asked them, like, do you know what this is? They're like, no, it's just really cute. I'm like, huh, interesting. So it's bleeding into the cultural aspects of different countries, right? It has nothing to do with nfts. It's just building its brand value because of the appeal of the content in itself.
