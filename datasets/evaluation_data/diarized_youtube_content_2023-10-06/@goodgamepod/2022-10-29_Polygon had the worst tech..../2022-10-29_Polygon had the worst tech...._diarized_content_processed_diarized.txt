00:00:00.160 - 00:00:48.824, Speaker A: Polygon is probably the most interesting case study in the competitive landscape of layer one layer twos. Because in my mind, when Polygon first started, arguably they had close to being the worst technology compared to their competitors, and yet they have one of the greatest developer mind shares. That's right. The way I think about this is when Polygon first started, they were the first to be in the market in the ethereum ecosystem when the roll ups were not ready yet, and they solved a specific pain point that Ethereum developers experienced at that point in time one to two years ago, which is the fact that Ethereum was highly congested and there at the right time. And they solved that problem even with a somewhat shitty tech.
