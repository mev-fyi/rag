00:00:00.250 - 00:00:04.190, Speaker A: Welcome to good game. Your no BS Insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.490 - 00:00:14.158, Speaker B: Do you ever see Uniswap become an order book many, many years from now when gas fees go down by a lot?
00:00:14.244 - 00:00:51.558, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say I am not religious at all and have not been for at least a couple years now about amms and being like, oh, Uniswap is an amm. I think Uniswap is a Dex and whatever ever the best implementation of a Dex for the environment, for the Ethereum environment, and on chain trading and noncustodial trading. That's what Uniswap should be. I think that has been an Amm. I think with us off v three, it's much closer to a central limit order book than it was before. And in fact, I would say user v three is about as close to a central limit order book as it is to an Amm that you would describe, like Usop v two. So I think already we're sort of.
00:00:51.584 - 00:01:37.334, Speaker A: There looking for your next startup idea in crypto. Check out our request for startups list and get inspired at Alliance XYz ideas. Welcome to good game. Today we have two guests that we're going to be speaking with in regards to Uniswap before Uniswap X and potentially other products that are coming down the pipeline. And so we have Dan Robinson, who is the head of research at Paradigm. Previously he co wrote the Uniswap v two, v three and v four white paper. He went to Harvard Law, went to a boot camp that ultimately turned himself into a programmer, and from there he got into crypto and slowly worked himself into his current role at Paradigm.
00:01:37.334 - 00:01:54.370, Speaker A: Afgeny Gavoy, who's the other person that we have on as a speaker. He previously came from the traditional market making space in traditional finance. So he worked at optiver and optever. Turns out, as you know, Chow is the top three options market maker in the world.
00:01:54.440 - 00:01:59.250, Speaker B: I know Optimur very well from my past life in tradfi.
00:01:59.590 - 00:02:00.946, Speaker A: You guys were competitors, right?
00:02:01.048 - 00:02:11.750, Speaker B: We're the most fierce competitors in the options space, but Optimur is probably also very active in other asset classes. But they're best known for their options market making business.
00:02:11.900 - 00:02:40.286, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah. So he then started or co founded Winter Mute, which is the, I'd probably say one of the most crypto native market makers in the space. They've launched their own protocols. They've been very active in the Defi space by either trading, providing liquidity, et cetera. So it's a good blend of traditional finance and defi and where Dan comes from is very research focused. Right.
00:02:40.286 - 00:03:10.958, Speaker A: And the idea, and we'll talk more about this, but the idea here is turning uniswap into one of the most efficient order books on Defi rails. And there's always been this controversy or topic of choice where we talk about how amms aren't really order books. And it's really good to get both of these guys on because obviously, if you think about both of their backgrounds, I think they can offer a lot of insight as to why or why not order books are the right model for defi.
00:03:11.074 - 00:03:57.318, Speaker B: Yeah. So to your point, before Uniswap V four was published or the white paper was published, people speculated that Uniswap V four was going to look a lot more like an order book than V three, which already looked very much like an order book compared to the V two. So people speculated that over the long term, Uniswap would evolve into something very close to the order book central limit order book. But when I read the V four white paper, it didn't seem that way. But at the same time, it feels very early. I think there's still a lot of working, it's still work in progress, and they're still gathering feedback from the community. But there are two things that stood out for me in the white paper.
00:03:57.318 - 00:04:51.670, Speaker B: One was the hooks, and the other one was the reduction in fees for deploying strategies. The hooks enable more flexibility or customizability for market makers, at least that's what it seems on paper. And the fee reduction will make it a lot cheaper for market makers to deploy strategies as well. So it seems to me that at a high level, Unisop V four is trying to target market makers, liquidity providers, rather than market takers, the traders, so to speak. And so that's my understanding of V four. And I love to dive deeper with Dan, who obviously co wrote the white paper. But at the same time we have Afgeni, which is, I would say, a user of Uniswap.
00:04:51.670 - 00:05:09.738, Speaker B: So I love to get his feedback as a user, I love talking to users of existing products to get a better sense of how the products work. I think it's the most objective way to get a sense of how good the product is. So it'd be really interesting to get both perspectives agreed.
00:05:09.834 - 00:06:21.558, Speaker A: For me, outside of the two areas you mentioned with hooks and gas fees, which is done through the Singleton flash accounting deployment strategy, I like the idea of some of the examples that they gave of what hooks could enable. And to me, it seems like you're absolutely right that they're focused on market makers, but I think in parallel, there's also a bit of a focus on devs that are building the space as well and to attract them to use Uniswap as a way to build certain types of implementations. And you see this already with the applications that we're getting in within the alliance, right? You get so many different types of variations of amms, and to be quite frank, by allowing hooks, you could build these types of implementations using Uniswap and the hooks it enables and the liquidity that it offers. So to a certain degree, I kind of feel like this is similar to. And I was also surprised, by the way, when I read the Uniso V four paper, I thought it was going to be more like an order book model, but it turns out they're going the developer market maker route, which is to enable more market makers to come into space. It reminds me a lot of the metamask snap zap play.
00:06:21.724 - 00:06:22.440, Speaker B: Yes.
00:06:22.970 - 00:06:43.214, Speaker A: Which I thought metamask was just going to continue building a great wallet, but it turns out they're turning into more of a developer product where you could enable and run sandbox environments within, let's say, metamask. So it's turning more into a Lego. And I feel like Uniswap is taking a page out of that book by going that route as well.
00:06:43.252 - 00:06:43.934, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:44.132 - 00:06:52.698, Speaker B: By the way, we've already heard of several developers building different features for metamask, so I can see the same thing happen on Uniswap.
00:06:52.794 - 00:07:25.274, Speaker A: The question is, and this is a question we're going to ask, Dan, are we going to see billion dollar outcomes out of these hooks similar to Metamask may co create with snap and zaps. Right. And that's yet to be told. I don't know. I don't know how big of a deal this is yet. And that's what I'm curious to find out, yes, you could build like limit order books now, or you could build an oracle using a hook. But the key question here is, can the hooks that are being built enable products that are going to be much bigger than what Uniswap already has to offer? That's the question.
00:07:25.392 - 00:07:29.020, Speaker B: My answer to your question is no, but we'll talk more with.
00:07:29.710 - 00:07:32.640, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel the same, but you never know. Right?
00:07:33.090 - 00:08:22.640, Speaker B: My reasoning is that the developers that will build strategies on top of Uniswap, the independent developers that build strategies on top of Uniswap and offer them as products to consumers, those people will get crushed by the likes of. I mean, trading at this frequency in the short term is basically a zero sum game. It's extremely competitive, extremely cutthroat. And I think the vast majority of people should not engage in this type of activities because they have no edge against the likes of winter mute and jump and others. So I think that as far as V four is concerned, I think the majority of value will accrue to the professional market makers and Unisop itself.
00:08:24.050 - 00:09:05.514, Speaker A: If you look at v three, right, with the liquidity concentration, it was primarily retail focused. Now if retail even tried to participate, they'll just get cut up in the divergence of the price, right. So I do think it's going to become more and more professionalized outside of v four. I also want to talk a bit about Uniswap X. We did talk about intent based architecture maybe three podcasts ago. And the idea of being an RFQ order aggregator that could enable any asset to be found on Uniswapx. And leveraging solvers fillers to go out and chase for that.
00:09:05.514 - 00:09:30.260, Speaker A: Liquidity is a very interesting way to out aggregate cowswap, one inch fusion and others. And so that's going to be an interesting battle as well. It seems like there's three battles going on, right? The battle for wallets, the battle for being in the aggregator, and then obviously battle for being the liquidity source. Liquidity pools via amms. I feel like those are the three big battles that Uniswap is fighting. All three.
00:09:30.950 - 00:10:27.826, Speaker B: So, and this touches on a theme that we spoke about probably during several episodes, which is that DeFi protocols, once they've reached certain critical mass, they will start going horizontal and they will start competing with each other. So Uniswap, by launching Uniswap X, is competing directly with one inch fusion. It's almost identical to one inch fusion, and it's also competing with the likes of Calswap. And on the AMM side, they're competing with like 50 other balancer. Yeah. Incremental improvements of Uniswap V two, by the way. Uniswap found their niche in the AMM vertical and thanks to that, they're able to bootstrap a large user base and really good brand, which allows them to build other products such as the Unisop X, to compete with one inch.
00:10:27.826 - 00:10:35.782, Speaker B: So that's the second one. And then you mentioned the mean you've been using Uniswap wallet for the mobile wallet for a while.
00:10:35.836 - 00:10:40.634, Speaker A: I tried three weeks. Yeah, sorry, go ahead.
00:10:40.832 - 00:11:12.594, Speaker B: Yeah, so I don't really know what to make of it. But it seems like Uniswap manages to get the in app swapping approved by the App Store, which I don't see on many other mobile apps. I don't know if it's a problem with the App Store itself. I don't know if it's because the App Store doesn't allow in app swapping or is it that those other apps haven't built a feature yet, but Uniswap has this thing that no other apps have. But what is your experience?
00:11:12.792 - 00:12:16.066, Speaker A: Yeah, I downloaded every wallet and for some OD reason, as you mentioned, I think Trustwallet offers the swaps feature, but it's not like dead center, right? And what I like about Uniswap is the fact that it's very easy to create private key, and it shards the private key and stores part of it in your iCloud, right? And it has a password that's encrypted. So every time you log in, you pop in your password, it'll automatically decrypt your private key. The cool thing about it is that this is easy for normies to understand, right? The average everyday person, they can just log in like they would normally log in. And so as long as they keep their apple icloud secure, then it's fine. Two is the dead center, like front and center. As soon as you download the Uniswap wallet app, it takes you to the swaps product, which is what I think every wallet should do, because that is the main. We've talked about this as well, which is we should embrace speculation, right? Speculation is a key property of what crypto enables that no other sector enables.
00:12:16.066 - 00:13:00.134, Speaker A: And so they kept the swaps product as dead center in the middle. So as soon as you fund the wallet, you can start trading shitcoins, right? And that is what every speculator is looking for in the space. This reason why we have bull runs is the fact that they're all chasing tokens, right? And I do think that is going to be a killer feature or product that is going to probably be like the top one, two in the App Store, I think in the next coming bull run, because they're the only wallet that I've seen that has focused primarily on swapping. And they make it very easy to find any shitcoin that you want. I've typed in hamster, I've typed in whatever, right? Unibot, et cetera. And it found it. And it was very easy.
00:13:00.134 - 00:13:10.070, Speaker A: I don't have to copy and paste the contract address. I can find it, I can trade it. And for the average retail person, I think that's what they want, right? They just want to be able to trade your coins.
00:13:10.230 - 00:13:42.546, Speaker B: But if they are going after the average retail trader, then I don't know exactly what their strategy is. But if that is the case, they're fighting an uphill battle against Coinbase, which owns the user, the retail on ramp, off ramp, 100%. In any case, the discussion we're having is that every DeFi protocol is trying to fight each other on multiple fronts, including the wallet, the aggregation layer and the Amm layer. So it will be really interesting to see how these things play out.
00:13:42.648 - 00:14:20.350, Speaker A: All right, well with that, let's bring on Afghani and Dan. Welcome to good game. Today we have Dan from paradigm and Afganny from Wintermute. And today's topic is going to be on Uniswap V four and what it can enable one from a user perspective, two founders perspective, and then three, just the community at large. And so that's why we have Afghani from Wintermute joining us. So maybe just to get our audience up to date on Uniswap V four, what are some high level points, Dan, that Uniswap v four enables that users should be thinking about?
00:14:20.420 - 00:15:50.298, Speaker C: Yeah, so the key thing we were trying to do with Uniswap before is moving Uniswap, which already moved from being just a single amm strategy in Uniswap b two into this platform for being able to provide liquidity basically with any static strategy in Uniswap v three. I think the goal is to try to extend that evolution so that it can now be a platform in which you can build any kind of dax or amm that you want, on top of the concentrated liquidity strategy implemented in Uniswap v three. So with v four, I think the two big changes we made to try to enable that one is to introduce these ideas of hooks, which are basically the ability to extend the Amm logic to launch your own pool on the same logic as Uniswap v three, but with extra logic added to the beginning or end of trades or to be at the end of liquidity provision. And that allows you to open up a lot of design space that AMM developers or designers might want to add to Uniswap and let them launch that as Uniswap before pools, rather than as launching a fork or launching their own amm. And then in order to make this all more efficient, to sort of reduce the cost of this multiple city of pools, we jammed all the Uniswap v four pools, which in Uniswap v three are all different contracts, jammed them all into one contract to make it more efficient to route across multiple of them. And both of these are, again, with the idea of trying to make it a platform for others to build on and not just its own. Amm.
00:15:50.298 - 00:15:51.118, Speaker C: Got it.
00:15:51.204 - 00:16:43.822, Speaker A: So it seems like, although on Twitter and others will probably say these are marginal improvements, I kind of see this as a pretty big improvement for what could enable a whole secondary action of builders that could be building around the hook design space, is that the idea is to make uniswap more of a permissionless liquidity and then enable founders to take that liquidity and build interesting products around it. And you kind of saw this element with the onchain oracle that you built out for. I think it was v two, right, where you had the price accumulators per block, and essentially you could allow these pools to become like price feeds. But I think the problem ended up being that it was very gas efficient and swappers were paying for the gas. And so maybe taking a step back and allowing the founders or builders to build on top of pools versus building within the pools. Is that the idea, or how were you thinking about that?
00:16:43.956 - 00:17:22.966, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think with unison upgrades, we took this very deliberate pace. I started working really seriously with them on it, with v two, and at every step you need to choose. We want to add these features, but it comes with some complexity costs if you add these. And so we can't do these other features. And there's trade offs everywhere there. And for a while, I think there was some value in making those choices for users and for the space. You could keep things fairly simple, but we're starting to see there are a lot of different things that people might want from Dexas for different assets or with different strategies, different kinds of liquidity providers.
00:17:22.966 - 00:18:01.414, Speaker C: And, yeah, making every pool pay the gas cost of oracles, when in fact, you don't always want an oracle, may not be the right trade off to make. So the idea here is seeing that, okay, there is some more innovation going on outside of Uniswap, more outside of Uniswap, probably in some that is going on inside, certainly now. And so we want to be able to take advantage of all of that and allow people to build it into Uniswap themselves. That was the goal. And I think absolutely would hope that we see a lot of innovative hooks being built on Uniswap that we either wouldn't have chosen to do. Or wouldn't have made the trade off, made the choice, or wouldn't have come up with ourselves. I'll give you one example, is, I think in Uniswap v.
00:18:01.414 - 00:18:52.582, Speaker C: Three, we added the ability to do multiple fee tiers, and then we actually added the ability for governance to enable more tiers on top of that. So we allowed five bit, 30 bit and 1% pools, but we allowed uni governance to choose more tiers to set and to enable. And I didn't think people would go lower than that. But actually, someone made a proposal on uni governance to enable the one bit pool. And I wasn't opposed to that, but I didn't think it would get used a lot, I think because I was somewhat naive, actually, about market structure. And when the one bit pool got enabled, suddenly it became, for stablecoins, at least just this massively competitive volume hog. And so I think that was an interesting realization where I think people outside of Uniso had a better sense of actually what would be the right feature to do there.
00:18:52.582 - 00:18:55.174, Speaker C: And so I think we'll see something similar with hooks as well.
00:18:55.292 - 00:18:56.914, Speaker A: Avgeni, what are your thoughts?
00:18:57.042 - 00:20:00.166, Speaker D: Yeah, no, it's interesting. I would say initially, look, from the onset, ever since Uniswap launched, I always got the question whether market makers will be replaced by mms. And I always said no, because honestly, I always thought, okay, the MM model, ultimately, it can never replace market makers. It doesn't have enough parameters to simply replace us or anyone else for that matter. And when Unity four was announced, I was thinking, okay, it will be just another step towards just adding more dimensions on top, like how univistry, added more features, maybe it will add a few more things and it will be closer and closer to audible, ultimately. But once I went through what it actually encompasses, when I went through the hooks, like some fee improvements, some guest optimizations or whatever, it became clear to me that I think it's potentially way more than that. It basically opens a whole new design space.
00:20:00.166 - 00:21:35.702, Speaker D: It's definitely much more exciting from builder perspective, what it opens up and it can really go anywhere from here. It can enable whole new design space for dexes, but also it can massively succeed because it just opens so many possibilities, but it can also potentially fail because of that, because it's like one future, for example, is just because you have so many ways to create pools, to create different kinds of different hooks, you can potentially make the market too fragmented. And I think the main challenge that we'll see in next month or maybe year is whether we'll see basically some of those hooks being potentially whitelisted by Uniswap foundation, for example, to be allowed, or whether somebody else emerges to basically say, okay, which hooks are safe or not to use. Because if you have all those hooks that anyone can use, you open yourself. For anyone malicious to actually design a hook, which is not good. And this whole design space would revolve around hooks about how to whitelist or how to ensure which hooks are worse integrating with, for example, as a market maker, which hooks are worse integrating with as a market taker. Because honestly, wintermute, from the onset, we've been much more active on the taker side of things like bringing all kind of, you could say, toxic flow to uniswap potentially.
00:21:35.702 - 00:21:47.006, Speaker D: But now for us, it would be quite interesting to see, okay, if there are thousands of new pools with all kinds of hooks, how do we make a decision who to integrate with and who to not integrate with?
00:21:47.108 - 00:22:34.394, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there's some challenges in hook safety, but one nice thing that the contract architecture does provide is there's this fine grained permissioning for what a hook can do. And so there are some hooks. So think about the before swap and after swap hooks which affect trades, but they don't affect the ability to add or especially remove liquidity. And so, interestingly, if you have one of these hooks, there's a bound on how much you can lose, actually, as a market maker. Basically, you can lose the fees that you have to a pool that has just these hooks turned on. You can lose accrued fees, but you're not going to lose your principal relative to just providing a new soft v three. I mean, I think it allows you to be a little more fearless than you might be if it was just like, oh, this is providing on any pool, this is providing to any arbitrary contract.
00:22:34.394 - 00:22:43.374, Speaker C: And similarly, for a swapper, you may not actually care what pools you trade on as long as you know what assets you get out.
00:22:43.412 - 00:22:43.614, Speaker D: Right?
00:22:43.652 - 00:23:16.326, Speaker C: And so actually, to some extent, the homebuyer dexter on the router can actually enforce for you the property you would care about, which is not losing your money without you actually having to know anything about the logic of the pools that you're trading on. You just revert if the pool doesn't give you out the money that you were expecting. So I think there's something to provide there. But then again, absolutely, you still want to evaluate the logic of any hook that you provided you to see if ride liquidity too, to see if it's worth integrating or worth putting your capital in there, and especially for ones that have other. There are other hearts that could potentially cause loss of capital for liquidity providers.
00:23:16.438 - 00:24:00.770, Speaker B: I have a follow up question for both of you. So, Dan, first question related to something that Afghanistan said about liquidity fragmentation. So my understanding is for every pair, let's say eth USDT, you can have multiple strategies, multiple pools. So that's what theoretically leads to liquidity fragmentation. But from a taker's point of view, does uniswap automatically plays the one inch role, like the liquidity aggregator role, whereby it routes the trade to the best price? Because if that's the case, there is no fragmentation of liquidity. How do you think about that? Is that something that you guys are thinking about?
00:24:00.860 - 00:24:59.990, Speaker C: Well, there's some fragmentation of liquidity, in part because there's a gas cost to drowning across multiple pools. And so if there are many different pools, there's some cost to the swapper in terms of their trade, has to be split across multiple pools, maybe, or has to go to some complicated pool or something to be able to trade. There's a subtler, I think, market structure issue with fragmentation, which is if you have many different pools and you can, for example, have pools that have, like, one bit lower fees than each other. And actually, recently Alexander Nislodan was talking about this concept on Twitter. But there's a potential for one hook to undermine another hook by having slightly lower fees, and then you might actually get a race to the bottom where hooks will compete with each other for the vast majority of uninformed flow by having slightly lower liquidity than others. So there's a bit of a cost of anarchy there if you allow just any hooks to be deployed with any fees. So those are, I think, the two major costs of liquidity fragmentation.
00:24:59.990 - 00:26:03.722, Speaker C: But I think the goal of it is not necessarily that there's tons of strategies and everything is being routed across 50 different pools in every trade. I think the goal is you learn and you discover from what happens in the pool actually where the liquidity wants to go or what the best design is, and then a lot aggregates there. And we saw that with the 30 bit and five bit USDC pools we're going in. I probably would have predicted that the 30 bit pool would have, and ETH USDC on unisoft e three would have been dominant. And in fact, by far, the five bit pool is the dominant pool. I think in hindsight, there's reasons to understand why that was the case, but it's dociling that we would have predicted and I think if we'd said, oh, there must be one fee tier, we would have said it's at least somewhat higher than the five bit pool. And so I think getting that kind of just permissionless innovation on top of it in order hopefully for a lot of liquidity to pool in some surprising pool in some pool that actually really works, that captures leverage, users, or risk, or is really good at setting its fees.
00:26:03.722 - 00:26:04.510, Speaker C: That's the goal.
00:26:04.590 - 00:26:26.454, Speaker B: Just a quick follow up on that. Isn't that what you want though? Like having many different market makers compete and potentially provide the best price to the taker? Don't you want very competitive landscape? Because that's essentially what happens on order books, on centralized exchanges. You have players like winner, mute and jump, and many others compete to give the best price.
00:26:26.572 - 00:26:50.160, Speaker C: Yes, potentially, but possibly that could all be on the same pool. And there may be designs where that might work. And unison in v three. To some sense, sometimes active liquidity fighters are basically competing with each other on that platform. But yeah, and I think it would be great if there are multiple liquidity pools. I don't think there will be a mapping of liquidity providers or each liquidity fighter has their own pool that implements their own strategy. I think it's going to be a little more.
00:26:50.160 - 00:26:57.426, Speaker C: It's going to be more like a mapping of feature of sort of what kind of features in an amm you might want. I don't know if anybody may have more thoughts on that.
00:26:57.528 - 00:27:55.118, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think for more traditional market makers like us, it would kind of depends. The design of different kinds of pools with different hooks enabled would play pretty big role. Like for example, you can have pools with just in time liquidity, sort of like disabled by means of introducing extra fees for the joint liquidity. And you can have pools which basically would not penalize market makers to do that. And so they potentially would work in a kind of like similar way to how cowswap operates. And I think what you will see is the design space where you will have liquidity providers, more like lazy or whatever, very passive, like classic unity between liquidity providers in one set of pools and somebody like us providing liquidity on other type of pools and then uniswap doing the aggregation in the background.
00:27:55.214 - 00:28:31.118, Speaker B: So, follow up question for you, Afghani. So you said earlier that winter mute is currently active on Unisoft v three, but is more active on the taker side than on the maker side. You're the one who contribute some of that toxic flow to the market makers. And anecdotally, I've heard something very similar from other professional market makers is that they're more active as a taker than as a maker. So my question is, does the current design or vision of Uniswap before sound like something that makes you want to provide liquidity more, be more active on the maker side?
00:28:31.204 - 00:29:06.380, Speaker E: Yeah, potentially, because it can enable us, especially if you couple it with all the gas efficiency improvements, which was another pretty big challenge for us because even if we wanted to provide liquidity on university, it's still, sometimes you would want to withdraw it, sometimes you would want to add it, and it's just pretty gas inefficient to do it like continuously like this. But yeah, coupled with gas efficiency improvements, coupled with all these improvements on singleton contract like us, I think it might start to make sense for us to at least experiment more in this space.
00:29:08.430 - 00:29:48.874, Speaker A: I heard one of your talks recently within the, I think it was the Uniswap podcast where you talked about the mcamm. Maybe talk a bit about that, but maybe just a high level. The idea here is loss versus rebalancing. Does it make sense for makers to give a free option to arbitragers by essentially getting being able to arbitrage the price from let's say uniswap to let's say, binance or coinbase? And now there's a concept of potentially paying a fee or like a rent fee to block builders to lps. I'm curious on what your thinking is there, and I obviously want to hear Evgeny's thoughts here as well.
00:29:48.992 - 00:30:57.914, Speaker C: Yeah, so this is one part of the family, a family of possible hooks that we think could help mitigate lever. I think we don't have a full design for this, and I think fully open about that, where part of the idea of opening up this hook design space is to see what people can do in the space. But one interesting line of research in lever has been instead of. So this is a free option, right? That when there's a liquidity at the beginning of a block and the price has changed recently, you're effectively giving away this option to trade against it. And the question is, well, what if instead we charge for this option in one way or another, we charge a premium? And what that requires is for somebody ahead of time, or this particular version of the design is that somebody ahead of time, at least in the previous block, needs to have basically purchased this right to be the first trader in a block. Or there's different variants on this idea, but functionally, somebody pays ahead of time and they get the right to be the first trader or to trade without fees in the beginning of a block. And so yes, the advantage of that is the liquidity writers basically are earning this rent.
00:30:57.914 - 00:31:51.434, Speaker C: And then, yeah, they're still getting traded against, maybe traded against with no fee in that block, but they're being paid ahead of time for the expectation of the profit. The arbitrary will be able to get from there. And so yes, it's a really interesting idea proposed by Alex Herman, and I think there have been a few, some other proposals out there about it. My variant that I think is pretty interesting, although I'm not sure how to get it to work quite yet, would be to have to auction off not just the right to be the first trader, but actually the right to receive all the fees from a pool and also the right to receive the fees that are paid into a pool. And the interesting thing about that is now you've basically found this off chain agent. So someone like, someone who can run all these models and know exactly how best to take advantage of this, right. If they were to pay for it, some off chain agent would be able to do all the calculations.
00:31:51.434 - 00:32:14.418, Speaker C: They go, okay, here's actually the ideal fee that we should set. And this solves this problem of setting the fee and dynamic fee, setting a fee in uniswap that maximizes revenue, and then you have this option agent that's aligned to be able to do that. But I think there's a lot of challenges to that and I think the mechanism doesn't quite work yet. So I hesitate to be too competent about that or any other particular hook design for lever reduction.
00:32:14.514 - 00:32:26.310, Speaker A: Avgeni, would you pay a rent fee to get fees and to set the fees and to be able to get essentially that free option right to trade against the LP providers?
00:32:26.390 - 00:33:13.782, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, it's not the most weird tax design, right. It's like we've seen more strange things, I guess. And it's not that I think it would be interesting to play with. Yes, given the overall complexity in dexes and trading on MMS currently, it doesn't add that much. Any trading firm can sort of estimate how much they are willing to pay for it. And I think it would be quite interesting because especially firms with better understanding of options and current implied volatility in the market, they would be definitely at advantage of trading on those kind of dexes, basically. Yeah, I think it would be funny.
00:33:13.846 - 00:33:30.218, Speaker B: And you mentioned earlier that one of the key value propositions of unison before is the fee reduction. Dan, do you have any early estimate of how much lower fees will be, both for contract deployment as well as swapping.
00:33:30.314 - 00:34:13.150, Speaker C: So, yes, I'm sorry. For contract deployment, I believe the estimate is around 99% cheaper. So it's dramatically cheaper for swapping. I don't have an exact number, in part because the code isn't finalized, and the whole thing depends on an upgrade to the EVM that is scheduled for the cancun hard fork. But until then, it's actually somewhat hard to test in a lot of realistic scenarios what the gas costs will be. But the primary place where savings comes from is from not having to have these intermediate USC 20 transfers on a pool when you trade with multiple across pools, when you trade with multiple pools. So it should save maybe around like pool rounded against.
00:34:13.300 - 00:34:20.810, Speaker B: And what is the current cost of, for v three, the current cost of contract deployment?
00:34:20.970 - 00:34:28.706, Speaker C: Contract deployment, it's somewhere in the millions of gas, I think I'll have to check.
00:34:28.808 - 00:34:34.194, Speaker B: So that should go down to tens of thousands, something like that.
00:34:34.232 - 00:35:06.234, Speaker E: Yeah, I actually have a question to Dan on that as well. To me, it's all exciting. The gas fee improvements, on one hand, it's all exciting and interesting, and there are quite a few like, well, 1150. 311 55. It's all going to be improving it quite significantly. But what kind of future do you see? Basically, one future that a lot of people are promoting is like, all training will move to l two s, all training will be on arbitrum and optimism and what's not polygon.
00:35:06.282 - 00:35:06.880, Speaker C: And.
00:35:08.690 - 00:35:16.066, Speaker E: Are those gas efficiency improvements even relevant in the long run if all trading moves away?
00:35:16.168 - 00:36:04.846, Speaker C: Basically, I think it will be. I think in part because, as you know, in traditional markets, there's basically no end to how much benefit you can get from higher performance and lower latency and more optimization. And so I think regardless of the platform that you're running this on, efficiency is going to be really important. And I do think this, especially with l two s, when you're doing dex trading, it's always competitive. And so I think if you make it cheaper, it's just people are going to do more of it. Basically, there's going to be more arbitrage more frequently, or people are going to route across more pools in order to take advantage of whatever bandwidth you can provide. And so, yeah, I think there's always going to be benefits in reducing gas.
00:36:04.846 - 00:36:30.154, Speaker C: Now, I do think there are ways to get potentially like ten x or almost or maybe 100 x improvement in these gas costs by adopting a different architecture, maybe by not doing something on the EVM. And I think there's just a lot of interesting work in that area, but I think especially for EVM l two s, I'm very happy that we're also optimizing how before we'll work on those.
00:36:30.272 - 00:37:05.758, Speaker B: So speaking of the L2s, I actually looked at the trading volume on uniswap across the various L2s this morning, and I saw that Uniswap on arbitram is trading about half of what's being traded on the Uniswap main net on ethereum layer one. So it's a pretty impressive number. Do you have any plans for Uniswap to go even further on the L2s? For example, are you even thinking about supporting the non EVM L2s, any sorts of those ideas about L2s?
00:37:05.854 - 00:37:54.690, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there's nothing really specific yet, and I think we've kept an eye on l two s. What I will say is, when you look at just the pie chart of where Uniswap users, the system, Uniswap LPs and swappers, where the value is leaking out of that system, quite a lot of it is being paid to eIp 1559 right now. Quite a lot of it is being burned in eth. And that's just sort of purely about just the platform that you're on and gas transaction costs. And then the higher the transaction costs are, the higher lever is as well because you have arbitrage trades happening less frequently, so more valued leaks actually to arbitrage. And so I do think that's going to be a really important, just reducing the gas costs. V four is a step in that direction.
00:37:54.690 - 00:38:09.186, Speaker C: Some other stuff that should be launching, I think today, as we record this podcast, is another step in that direction. But I think l two s and scaling generally are just going to be another huge step for that. So I think it's a big area of focus going forward.
00:38:09.308 - 00:38:35.822, Speaker A: How do you see the landscape moving forward in terms of like, you have startups like conduit, Caldera and others that are offering kind of like app as a service model. And let's play a hypothetical and say that one of these apps becomes like a billion dollar market cap, a lot of value that's being created within that roll up. How do you see Uniswap extend to those environments?
00:38:35.966 - 00:39:35.138, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I think we will always see a synchronous decks on every l two platform. And I think so part of Uniswap's, part of the strategy is let's have a Uniswap basically on every platform and try to get usage for those sort of atomic trades on the platform. But I think another huge part of it is going to be how do we get trades to happen across these platforms if there's multiple conduit or full disclosure paradigms invested in conduit? And here I should say in general, I work at paradigm work address investment firm, but I may are not talking about on behalf of them. These are my own views. We do have investments in the space. If you have multiple conduit chains, I think it's often really important for people to be able to trade directly from one roll up to another, or to have faster exits from an optimistic roll up or even a ck roll up to Mainnet. As we see a lot of these, I think cross chain across roll up trading is going to be increasingly important.
00:39:35.138 - 00:39:43.350, Speaker C: And again, hopefully an announcement that is within maybe hours. As we record this, we'll talk a little more about our plans for that.
00:39:43.420 - 00:39:57.426, Speaker A: And you as a firm, how are you interacting with Uniswap across all the different stack layer ones, L2s, et cetera? Or how do you see the fragmentation of the space from that perspective?
00:39:57.538 - 00:40:54.986, Speaker E: Yeah, I think Mainnet is more, is more complex on our side, because we are not only trading that we need to be involved on, we need to be involved even on a block building side of things as well, just to be competitive. So it's much more complex compared to l two s. But yeah, the way I see it is a lot of this competition will move to l two s ultimately, because it just ultimately will be just cheaper than Mainnet. So if you're talking about mass adoption, that's where we should be building tokens. We should be ready to be competitive on all tools primarily. But that being said, main net is still much easier for people to connect to, to bridge liquidity, to basically just trade on. So we kind of see our strategy being supporting docile twos and the main net and basically all kinds of side chains as well.
00:40:55.088 - 00:41:03.706, Speaker B: Afghani, do you guys see any other interesting dexes outside of Uniswap? It could be SpotX, could be derivatives.
00:41:03.818 - 00:42:02.786, Speaker E: I mean, I'm very curious to how DYDX experiment will play out with this v four, another v four to look out for, because that's going to be like a proper experimentation and basically properly decentralizing derivative decks really properly, with basically validators running the matching engine, potentially even like third parties running the front end. It's going to be very much decentralized. And I'm very curious how throughput will look like, because we're still very much experimentation stage on actually testing the testnet and seeing what will change for us. But it's basically, I think with Duidx, they're opening up a whole new design space as well with a new iteration. And full disclosure, yeah, we are pretty big investor. Well, holder, I guess. Now in the IDX, I saw an.
00:42:02.808 - 00:42:37.150, Speaker A: Interesting startup, Dan, called Oku trade that's built on top of Uniswap v three. And I'm curious to hear your thoughts on what is Uniswap going to look like a few years from now. Right, and we'll dive deeper into the hooks and all what it can enable. But is the idea really for Uniswap to have permissionless liquidity and then you have front ends like Okutrade, that's building advanced trading like Uiux hooks that can enable new parameters that can allow either for dynamic fees or twoms. Oracle designs, where do you see all of this going?
00:42:37.300 - 00:43:36.654, Speaker C: Yeah, so from my perspective, I think what's most important about Uniswap is that it'd be the best place to trade every asset. And I think that requires doing a lot of work at the plumbing layer to make it exactly a good place for permissionless liquidity. I do think it's also very important to have innovation at the UX layer, both at Uniswap Labs where they work, where they have a wallet that supports trading on Uniswap, as well as supporting the interface at app, uniswap.org. But yeah, I think that is now a fraction of the liquidity of the volume that goes on Uniswap. I think if you look around the interface volume, it's around 15% or so of total uniswap volume. And so I think already we're in a case where most of this volume that's going to through Uniswap, the protocol is not being driven by products that Uniswap Labs itself is building. And so I think it already is very important that it be open to being integrated by other platforms.
00:43:36.654 - 00:44:20.654, Speaker C: I think V four makes that even more important because it is a very tough routing problem, for example, to route optimally across Unisoft V four pools. And so I think having one inch and other aggregators be able to aggregate V four pools is very important. And yeah, I think there's a lot of room for products that make a lot of these panes easier and bring on different kinds of users. Yeah, I think I saw the Okura interface, and yeah, I think there's many different kinds of assets out there. There's many different kinds of user experiences that people want, and I think the goal of having Unisopf is to be able to support all of those. And I think there'll be a lot of business to be built on top of really connecting those needs.
00:44:20.772 - 00:45:06.718, Speaker B: So on the topic of long term vision, obviously, this whole debate between amms versus order books since the early days of DeFi summer have been something that's been probably on both of your minds. I think in hindsight, I think I understand amms, why we do amms. I think amms were designed the way they were, largely because of the gas constraints. In my mind, if gas was completely free, I would probably just do an order book, because that gives market makers like Wintermete and others a lot more flexibility. But my question for you, Dan, is do you ever see Uniswap become an order book many years from now when gas fees go down by a lot?
00:45:06.884 - 00:46:11.586, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say I am not religious at all about, and have not been for at least a couple of years now about amms and being like, oh, uniswap is an amm. I think Uniswap is a dex, and it is whatever the best implementation of a Dex for the environment, for the Ethereum environment, and on chain trading and noncustodial trading, that's what Uniswap should be. I think that has been an amm. I think with ESop V three, it's much closer to a central limit order book than it was before. And in fact, I would say user V three is about as close to a central limit order book as it is to an amm that you would describe, like Usop B two. So I think already we're sort of there, and we ended the central limit order book and Amm wars with a marriage and an alliance. But I don't think that's the end state of how these markets are designed either.
00:46:11.586 - 00:47:02.526, Speaker C: I would also say, though, traditional markets also are not as dominated by central limit order books as you might think, especially if you spent your career trading equities or something, if you're trading other kinds of assets. When you think about, obviously, stuff like real estate or whatever, doesn't trade on an order book. But if you think about options, those are typically traded through more volume on that is traded through rfqs than just with limited order books. And I think a lot of it depends on the type of asset or on the type of market participants. There's a lot that goes on in dark pools. There's a lot that goes on to sort of voice rating over the counter, like all kinds of different ways that markets can function. And so this idea that the central limit order book is like the end state of history, I think isn't even true in traditional finance.
00:47:02.526 - 00:47:07.462, Speaker C: And I think it's not going to be true, not literally true in decentralized finance either.
00:47:07.516 - 00:47:32.960, Speaker B: So that's an interesting topic. Then in tradfi there's a bunch of different ways to trade. There's order books, there's dark pools, there's auctions, there's rfqs, there's a bunch of OTC trading as well. Afgeni, like any new design that you want to see in the Dex space that we can potentially borrow from tradfi, that doesn't exist today in defi yet.
00:47:33.330 - 00:48:19.462, Speaker E: I think most of the building blocks or most primitives already do exist. I kind of very much mirror dense words about how threatfi works for us. For example, as a market maker, it doesn't really matter whether DeFi will settle on central Lotter book or because like the way I see us, providing liquidity will be business aggregators mostly. That's been my central thesis for the last two years or so. That ultimately will arrive at some form of Robinshood effectively. Because if you look at Robinhood, Robinshood is effectively an RFQ platform on top of central order books. They do rely on central order books to exist to basically improve the pricing.
00:48:19.462 - 00:48:58.562, Speaker E: But ultimately Citadel and others, they provide liquidity there, like trying to improve that. And they effectively get all this juicy retail flow just by basically existing on top of central order books. And I think where DeFi will go in that regard is my bet is like rfQs, they're basically aggregators, like one inches. And that's why we invested quite a bit on our own aggregated people as well. I think that's where the future is. When you're talking about retail facing apps or dapps or whatever. I think that's actually going to be the most exciting design space for us as a market maker.
00:48:58.626 - 00:49:08.378, Speaker B: I think in general, the more complexity there is in a market, the better it is for market makers, because the more fun the game is, the more interesting strategies it can build.
00:49:08.544 - 00:49:53.020, Speaker E: Well, it's fun, but also like. Well, the more complex the space, the more you can differentiate yourself from your competitors, from less sophisticated competitors by building all kinds of modes. And in threatfi at the moment, unfortunately, I would say it's to a very large degree of speed game. So it's basically investing tens of millions in the infrastructure which is actually part of the reason I left RedFi as well, because it was just like a rat race to the bottom, which was not exciting to me at all. Like shaving off of this nanoseconds, I don't know, doesn't add up anything. And it's just basically creating a lot of costs for no good reason. But ultimately we'll see similar kind of phrase in DeFi eventually as well.
00:49:53.020 - 00:50:11.406, Speaker E: We already see it with block building, for example. You need to be quite sophisticated to actually participate in this market, and you see a very limited number of people actually being very competitive in the space. And so yeah, we'll see similar kind of like arms race based on sophistication, not on things else.
00:50:11.588 - 00:50:36.680, Speaker B: So speaking of that, you're rightly pointed out that there's searchers that are trying to become proposers and validators so that they can basically do the trading and the validating in a colocation in one physical location to reduce latency. Are you guys thinking about that? Is the Wintermere thinking about that? Or maybe you guys are doing it already?
00:50:37.130 - 00:50:40.540, Speaker E: Well, we are thinking about that. That's all I can say.
00:50:42.110 - 00:50:55.690, Speaker A: Looks like Uniswap just launched Uniswap X just saw that and I think this is something that, Dan, you were alluding to earlier. I quickly glanced over it, so I'll probably need your feedback on this, but it seems like an aggregator.
00:50:55.770 - 00:51:49.066, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I would think about it as basically it's a protocol for trading on Uniswap using signed orders rather than transactions. So typically with Uniswap, when you want to trade on Uniswap on chain right now, and you go through the interface, you create a transaction that trades with some specific set of pools. And so Uniswapx is a protocol where instead the user signs a signed order saying, basically here's the trade I want to do, signs their intent, to use the parlance of our times, expressing what they want to trade, and fillers compete to fill those orders. It's not the first protocol with some of these characteristics, but the idea there is trying to unlock more power from these signed orders rather than limiting users in the way that currently the interface forces them basically to submit their orders to a transaction.
00:51:49.178 - 00:52:28.602, Speaker A: Oh, this is cool. Intent based architecture for the users that don't know. We talked about this couple of podcasts ago, but central users can sign what they want, and then there could be solvers that can solve that complexity in terms of what you're looking for within that transaction, within the constraints that you're looking for. And so some people have alluded that aggregators are kind of like intent based architectures, which is kind of true. But what I like about this is that it's cross chain. So essentially the solvers or the fillers are able to source that liquidity and be able to help provide that liquidity for the users that are looking for it, right?
00:52:28.656 - 00:52:39.994, Speaker C: That's right. Yeah. It's true that in addition to this liquidity, the order is expressed as a transaction or signed order rather than transaction. It does mean that fillers can source liquidity from anywhere.
00:52:40.042 - 00:52:40.510, Speaker A: Got it.
00:52:40.580 - 00:52:43.610, Speaker C: Including from other dexes on chain or from off chain sources.
00:52:43.690 - 00:52:48.434, Speaker A: Are you guys using anoma or is this something that's built in? How does the architecture look like?
00:52:48.552 - 00:52:54.498, Speaker C: Yeah, so it's its own architecture and it's a relatively simple protocol, and we released the white paper as well today.
00:52:54.664 - 00:52:55.246, Speaker A: Okay.
00:52:55.368 - 00:53:29.230, Speaker C: But the basic idea is you sign a transaction, you sign a signed order, and when someone submits it, it gets filled. A reactor contract on Ethereum main net. And a couple of the innovations there. One is the features that it uses to help make competitive orders. One is that over time you can set these up, as we call dutch orders, so that over time the price changes in order to make it more attractive for fillers. That's one way to get a competitive fill. I think one inch fusion actually has a similar feature that they launched with as well.
00:53:29.230 - 00:53:46.450, Speaker C: And the other is that it allows the price, the initial price can be set using any method. And Uniswap launched in beta today, a protocol for application that does this using an off chain RfT like system, and find the initial filler.
00:53:46.610 - 00:53:54.598, Speaker A: Very cool. And it's coming out this summer, it seems like. So I'm excited to try it out. Yeah, what is. Oh, it's live today.
00:53:54.684 - 00:53:55.414, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:53:55.612 - 00:53:56.118, Speaker A: Nice.
00:53:56.204 - 00:54:44.182, Speaker C: Yeah. What I'm really excited about in this, and I want to highlight is I mentioned earlier on the call about cross roll up or cross chain trading, and I think this method of signed orders, signed orders with a dutch auction built in is a really, I think, elegant method for doing cross chain trading. And you can do that with just a single cross chain message. Oracle. But if you have just a single bridge that can go from one direction on a chain, you can do it, a dutch auction in the other direction. So what Uniswap X enables is really efficient cross chain trading or fast exits from roll ups or cross roll up trading. And I think that's just a really powerful thing to add to the Uniswap front end.
00:54:44.236 - 00:54:53.606, Speaker B: Just to confirm cross chain trading is trading on Uniswap from one chain to Uniswap from another trading.
00:54:53.798 - 00:55:54.634, Speaker C: A user has assets on one chain, and they want some other asset on some other chain, and they can trade like that, or this is not yet live. So this is something we're hoping to launch later this year. But the basic design for it is in the white cave. The idea is the user wants them assets on some other chain, so they are able to basically sign an order on the first chain, and then a filler will come fill them on the claim that order, then fill them on the destination chain, the chain that they want to trade onto. And then it's the filler's job, basically, to send the message back from the destination chain to the source chain in order to claim the user's assets. But for the user, hopefully, it's basically a seamless experience where they just sign an order on the source chain and then immediately, without having to pay gas on both chains or anything, receive an asset on the destination chain. And the nice thing, because this is all off chain liquidity, they don't actually have to have passive exposure to the bridge risk, nor does the swapper.
00:55:54.634 - 00:56:02.586, Speaker C: Only while the trade is basically in flight does either party have exposure to bridge risk. So we're trying to reduce some of the risk of bridge hacks.
00:56:02.698 - 00:56:10.366, Speaker B: Does any of the trading happens on the Uniswap protocol, the existing Uniswap protocols, or is this a totally separate protocol.
00:56:10.558 - 00:56:24.658, Speaker C: Especially for cross chain swapping? This would generally be a totally separate protocol, though it's possible that one know a filler might be able to trade on Uniswap in order to fill the user on one side or another. Got it. But yes, it would be its own protocol.
00:56:24.754 - 00:56:26.854, Speaker A: How does a messaging protocol work?
00:56:26.972 - 00:56:38.182, Speaker C: So it's not cross bridges the messaging layer. So you could use any bridge. You can use Chainlink or layer zero, or succeed, or any of these other protocols that support cross chain messages.
00:56:38.326 - 00:56:41.050, Speaker B: The filler can't decide what bridge they want to use.
00:56:41.120 - 00:56:50.800, Speaker C: The swapper would decide what bridge they're willing to accept, and the filler then can choose which orders they're willing to fill based on whether they accept the same bridge. Got it.
00:56:51.650 - 00:56:54.990, Speaker A: What are your thoughts? Do you see winter mute becoming a filler?
00:56:55.890 - 00:57:28.730, Speaker E: That's usually what we discussed, like, 1015 minutes ago. For us, that's exactly where I saw the market would go. This is this kind of new model solver model, where effectively we would be on the other side. Like, if somebody wants to swap on main net or somebody wants to swap from Mainnet to polygon or whatever. That's literally where the market should be heading. So, yeah, it's kind of like very much in line with how we see where the market should be heading against. But yeah, it's quite exciting that uniswap actually launches it.
00:57:28.730 - 00:57:34.494, Speaker E: That's that fast. Really looking forward to the cross chain part of it. I think that's the most interesting part.
00:57:34.612 - 00:57:39.258, Speaker A: So any other questions on that chop you want to talk about? Before I switch topics?
00:57:39.354 - 00:58:05.954, Speaker B: I also see mev protection and no cost for failed transactions. I mean, the no cost for failed transactions for me personally is a big deal. Signing a failed transaction pay the fees, which is really annoying. Mev protection is also really interesting. So basically, whenever there is some leftover meV, the protocol would return it back to the end user.
00:58:06.082 - 00:59:02.614, Speaker C: Yeah, I want to be careful about exactly how to explain this because it has some internalization of MEV, basically specific to the design. And then there's also ways that you can use these off chain orders and try to route them who you share them with to try to minimize the MEV that you exposed. But the basic idea is that the way that a sandwich attack works in uniswap, right, is that when you're trading, you're basically depending on what the price on chain on this amm is. And so if somebody trades ahead of you on the amm, they can actually possibly get a worse price on this. And these are basically just limit orders when you're signing this, right, at any given particular time, it's a limit order. And so whether you set the limit order price by off chain doing like an RFQ process, and there you're basically protected from what might happen in uniswap v. Three.
00:59:02.614 - 00:59:47.410, Speaker C: If you sign to title limit order, which is your transaction gets included, but it fails here, it doesn't get included at all. So you're protected in that way. And then the dutch option mechanism, where the price gets better over time, means that basically as soon as your order is actually competitive to fill, it executes. Now, this doesn't mean there's no mev. When you do the dutch auction, for example, as we have to know, a lot of dutch auctions on chain actually create some avv. And a lot of it depends on the parameterization or how this exactly works. But I think zooming out from the particular mechanisms, the key idea here is that you get a lot more flexibility when you're working with intents, when you're working with signed orders, than you do when you have a transaction.
00:59:47.410 - 01:00:04.942, Speaker C: And so I think the idea here is, I think this is the future of MeV. You're able to do things like this, which could be something like a batch auction. It could be something like an RFQ, it could be something more like a dark pool. But now that you're dealing with signed orders, there's a lot more potential for more sophisticated mev prevention. Got it.
01:00:04.996 - 01:00:29.506, Speaker A: I want to go back to hooks and then maybe close it out soon. You know, I think one idea that I want to touch on just, I had a very interesting question was, like, you published a white paper with Dave white on twomps, time weighted average market maker, which is like a volume based twap order over a given period of time. And the idea here is time weighted.
01:00:29.618 - 01:00:31.138, Speaker C: Orders, not volume weighted.
01:00:31.234 - 01:00:49.254, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah, time weighted. And the idea here is instead of, like market buying or market selling, you're able to express that order over a given period of time. Right. And I found this to be very interesting because this liquidity has to be taken by passive liquidity providers.
01:00:49.302 - 01:01:24.566, Speaker C: Right? Yeah. So what I really like about Qam, one of many things I like about QWAM, is that it's a kind of non aggregatable flow. If you really want to execute exactly the twap price over this time, want the guarantee that you get the twap on the amm. This is sort of basically the only way to do it. You could do something more like, you could do it contractually with someone off chain and sort of more of a principal trading model. But in order to really get this execution, you have to build it into the chain. And that is a kind of.
01:01:24.566 - 01:01:48.938, Speaker C: It's a defensible mode, in my view, potentially, for passive liquidity. Why do we have passive liquidity? Are they always just going to be offering these twelve second late offers? And I think one of the reasons is no, because if you really want to execute TWaP liquidity against it or TWAP volume against it, that's non aggregable. That has to actually execute against passive. So it's a real advantage, potentially, for passive liquidity.
01:01:49.034 - 01:02:22.874, Speaker A: I feel like hooks are just generally, there's a series of advantages of being a passive liquidity provider now versus before, which I think is very interesting. As you mentioned, on whether it's dynamic fees or mcamms, there's part of the fees that start to go back to liquidity providers. And with twoms, and let's just say twom start to take flight, I could see a world where it's profitable to be a passive liquidity provider. And that's always been an issue over the past three iterations of Uniswap, which is like the impermanent loss issue. And so I guess the question here.
01:02:22.912 - 01:02:35.200, Speaker B: Is, speaking of that quick question, have you guys analyzed the impermanent loss on Uniswap over the last two years? Since Uniswap v. Three, is it positive or negative? Do market makers make money?
01:02:35.810 - 01:02:56.686, Speaker C: It depends on the pool. But I think a lot of studies have shown that for the highest volume pool for UniswAp, for USDC Reef, on uniswap v. Three, these are number of analyses. I think it a lot depends on how you measure it. Say that most liquidity providers, the average liquidity provider on those loses money, lose.
01:02:56.718 - 01:02:58.040, Speaker B: Money, they lose money.
01:03:01.130 - 01:03:37.200, Speaker C: I don't know why they do it. I think there are a lot of subtleties in there, and I think a lot depends on which liquidity provider you are. And I think a lot depends on what else you're doing and what your goals are with that. But it is an interesting paradox, and if someone has a really good resolution to this paradox, I would be curious to see it, because it is sort of interesting. Like all the studies say it loses money and yet it is the highest volume, highest liquidity pool. I think one sort of resolution to it is we were talking before about this competition for retail volume is basically on Ethereum. Basically.
01:03:37.200 - 01:04:12.806, Speaker C: I don't exactly databases. My guess is more or less all the retail volume basically goes to units that pool. All the retail with USDT volume goes there because it has these really tight spreads. And so the prize if you're a really good liquidity provider on this pool is you basically get this piece of all the retail volume, all the uninformed flow. And so there's just like a really serious competition for it on this pool. And that competition, I think, means that on average, liquidity providers aren't making money, but you have to actually be there to be in the game at all. And so I think that's roughly how I would put it.
01:04:12.806 - 01:04:26.970, Speaker C: I don't have a really formal explanation for how that works or what that means, but I think that's the way that I think about it. It's a very competitive spread given, again, these twelve second quotes.
01:04:27.050 - 01:04:29.298, Speaker A: Avgani, do you provide liquidity on the.
01:04:29.304 - 01:04:31.694, Speaker C: Maker side, not on MX?
01:04:31.742 - 01:04:35.810, Speaker E: No, it just doesn't work for us at the moment.
01:04:35.960 - 01:04:37.538, Speaker A: Yeah, got it.
01:04:37.704 - 01:04:51.930, Speaker C: I also don't know who these people are. I really don't. It is OD, like the people that I know in the industry don't provide liquidity on that pool. So I feel sort of dumb about it because I think maybe I should know, but it's not clear anywhere else liquidity comes from.
01:04:52.000 - 01:05:27.090, Speaker A: I guess just going back to the original question, which is it seems like fees are being paid. There is some focus on hooks being an advantage for passive LP providers. Right. Is that the intent is to provide more value to liquidity providers in the long run or is it just primarily based on what's best for Uniswap and the products that you're building over there? Because I could see like if people start using twom and you have to use native Uniswap, then there's a clear advantage of using Uniswap over, let's say one inch or matcha. Right. And is that the intent is to provide more value to.
01:05:27.160 - 01:06:13.298, Speaker C: Okay, so the way I see is, I think there's three big lines of Dex research and one of them I alluded to, these are about where the value leaks out of the system. And one of them I alluded to earlier is just to transaction cost being burned. And that's where I think scaling and gas cost reduction are really important goals. And both before and Uniswap X, I think to some extent address the gas cost reduction. But I think there's been a long way to go on that. The second one is loss versus rebalancing or generally losses from liquidity providers. And Uniswap before is designed to try to reduce that loss and try to really protect liquidity providers from losses to arbitrage and make it competitive to be able to provide liquidity to this system.
01:06:13.298 - 01:07:07.762, Speaker C: And then the third is losses by traders to, to being slippage, to being sandwiched, to suboptimal execution, generally suboptimal routing. And that's what Uniswapx is trying to address, is trying to get optimal execution for swappers. I think we can't have a solution to any of these problems that is like, well, we'll just screw over the other guy, right? Like oh, passive liquidity. We're going to disable jit liquidity and we're going to just give traders really bad execution all the time because then they're not going to trade on you anymore. You're going to lose that volume. And you can't say we're going to just have lps get screwed and we're only going to optimize for swapper. The swapper is always in every moment getting the best possible price regardless of whether it's informed or informed, because then you're going to screw over potentially the basketball piece and you'll lose your liquidity that's on chain.
01:07:07.762 - 01:07:40.426, Speaker C: So I think you really need to solve both these problems at the same time. That's what we're trying to do with V four and Uniswap X. And you try to do it by taking money from basically who isn't in the room, who isn't in the system. I think, no offense, but it's the winner. It's the informed flow that we're trying to reduce their profit margins. And I think the, you know, that's, that's the hope with V four, is to be able to extract a little more of the optionality they're giving away. A lot of that actually ends up going to maybe anyway, so I think it isn't even going its way in these profit margins.
01:07:40.458 - 01:07:40.702, Speaker A: Right.
01:07:40.756 - 01:08:05.986, Speaker C: A lot of that is ultimately going to Ethereum stakers actually, anyway, because it gets competed away by other, by competition among arbitraries. And then, yeah, then I think with UnisWX, I think it is about trying to just give users the best price regardless of where it comes from. But yeah, TM is one of the ways I think MTAMm is another where I think we're just trying to tilt the balance back in favor of passive liquidity, being able to be competitive.
01:08:06.098 - 01:08:08.374, Speaker A: Got it. Evgeny, any thoughts there?
01:08:08.492 - 01:08:24.974, Speaker E: No, it's just like, it's really interesting, like Uniswap access to me, much more interesting than the whole hoops discussion, because basically, I think what uniswap is trying to do is basically to capture the whole space. Like the whole, well, basically the whole, how do you call it?
01:08:25.092 - 01:08:26.030, Speaker D: Vertical, basically.
01:08:26.100 - 01:08:57.302, Speaker E: Like, yeah, doms do wallet, do everything, basically own the whole thing. And it is quite interesting how, whether they will succeed or not, there is definitely space for intermittent to be involved, finally, I would say on the maker side. So that's definitely going to be interesting. But yeah, it's kind of like uniswap basically fighting the wallet wars, RFQ wars, like NM wars, like all in the same one. Let's see what happens.
01:08:57.436 - 01:09:49.494, Speaker C: I think the way I would put it is I think there's the Dex wars, and the Dex wars are fought on a lot of different fronts. I think if you want to give users the best execution and you want to give passive liquidity providers the best possible returns, you need to actually potentially just think about this as a full system. We have some visions for how this plays out. In different layers of the stack, but in general, some of it comes from not being religious about how it works and just thinking, okay, what's our end goal? And the end goal is how do we get users the best prices? How do we make this the best place to trade? All this and everything else of stems from that. Yeah, wallets are a big place where people trade. I think it improves a lot of the user experience. I think rfqs are just going to be increasingly a place where we're going to have to squeeze out a couple more of those bips of execution for users going to come from there.
01:09:49.494 - 01:10:02.446, Speaker C: But I see it all as and then Mev is just the place where most of this value is leaked out of the system. So how do we try to minimize that? And I think it's all in service of how do we actually get the best prices for users. Cool.
01:10:02.628 - 01:10:30.500, Speaker A: Last question. And then maybe Chow has one more question after that is obviously, we obviously see a lot of startups that are building the space. We've seen many iterations of amms, but obviously no one has come close to what you guys have built. Now it seems like hooks is the next opportunity, hopefully, for founders to build in the space. And so I guess the question is, is the idea, if you think of the analogy of like iPhone and the App Store, is that the same analogy we should be thinking about?
01:10:30.890 - 01:10:32.562, Speaker C: That would be beyond my wildest dreams.
01:10:32.626 - 01:10:33.240, Speaker A: Okay.
01:10:34.010 - 01:11:30.150, Speaker C: But I think that is absolutely the hope is that it can be something where people can build platforms on it. In fact, I would say, I say beyond my wildest dreams, but actually, I think the App Store actually fails on the Bill Gates test of a platform, which is the total value of what's built on top of it greater than the value of the platform itself. And that is true for Windows and not true for the iPhone. And so I would actually say my hope would be even to aspire further and say, could we actually get more value built on top of Uniswap than actually cruise to Uniswap, to the base plate itself? Because I think that's really important. I think we haven't had that to date. I think there's a lot of great stuff built on top of Uniswap to date, but I think we haven't had the ability to really build a huge Dex, for example, on top of it. Right? Like you can build a passive balance, various strategies, but what Unisoft V four allows you to do is build a Dex and building a deck.
01:11:30.150 - 01:11:57.458, Speaker C: If you can make it really work, it's a good business. I think our hope would be that, yeah, then you can absolutely build a competitive and really successful decks on top of Unisoft before. So I would love to see people trying to do that. And I think we're trying to be as supportive, really bend over backward in ways that we haven't always been. And I think I certainly haven't always been encouraging of competition or necessarily the most open. I think really trying to encourage as much as possible people to feel comfortable building on top of us.
01:11:57.544 - 01:12:13.286, Speaker B: One final question. So aside from everything we talked about today, is there anything else in defi that you guys are really excited about? I'll just throw some buzzwords, fixed income, rwas, options, et cetera, anything that you guys are excited about?
01:12:13.388 - 01:13:07.330, Speaker C: Yeah, I think having decentralized perp trading, as we talked about before, is important. And we also invested in Dr. Idx and also is very excited about that. Really like that team and excited about it, but generally and sound think, I think better design. We've done some work in NFT finance with Blur, which is another area that I'm fairly excited about. I think to name another trend, Oracle list protocols I think are very interesting. I think it can be a bit of a misnomer, but the general idea there is you can use these crypto economic mechanisms like we did with blur on blend to try to replace oracles where otherwise it's not just that you get rid of this oracle dependency, it also opens up, I think, the ability to go much longer tail than you would if you were depending on something that only be able to support things that are supported by oracle providers.
01:13:07.330 - 01:13:44.462, Speaker C: So I think that's an interesting trend. And getting really long tail with NFT collateral as a big example. And then one more, I think. I do think it would be nice to have treasury returns on chain. It's pretty funny because you do see these cycles where when interest rates were 0% and DFI rates were like, I'll say 5%, but some people thought they were 20%, but they were never 20%. But when DFI rates were high, you saw all these people trying to take DFI yields off chain, and now we're like, oh, DFI yields are lower than off chain yields. Let's try to get the off chain yields on chain.
01:13:44.462 - 01:14:43.510, Speaker C: But I think treasuries are a really good, just like MVP for real world assets, which it just really makes sense that we should have the risk pre rate on chain. And it abstracts away a lot of the problems we've had with real world assets before, as you basically get with these sketchy assets, whoever's willing to go on chain, and it's like, all right, if we're willing to actually, let's just wrap like the least sketchy asset we can think of. Although I don't know, maybe treasuries are not the least sketchy anymore, least sketchy asset other than ethereum. But if you can wrap these yields on chain, I think you can get a lot out of it, including what would be really nice, would be a permissionless stablecoin. I don't think you can get to permissionless necessarily with treasuries, but be really nice to have a stablecoin design that works on chain, a more decentralized, you're not going to get that with treasuries, but I think that would be another kind of design that'd be very nice to see work.
01:14:43.580 - 01:15:23.502, Speaker E: F kenny well, I mean, I'm easily excitable in general, but I think the thing that would excite me the most, if it can be solved, well, that should be solved eventually, is just general usability of Defi for general populace. Like basically being able to have a wallet and not lose connection to it. I know all the account abstraction stuff, basically making it much easier to onboard. Well, I mean, everyone keeps saying like, let's onboard next billion users. We cannot do it at the moment. It's just too tedious, too scary. We don't even have a million users at the moment, honestly.
01:15:23.502 - 01:16:22.726, Speaker E: So once this design space is getting solved, and once probably it's going to be wallets that are at forefront of that, once they actually fix it, for average person to not be scared to sign transactions, not be scared to send their board ape somewhere. Yeah, I think that would be the most exciting things that will actually happen to our space because then we'll actually see massive, massive adoption finally. Because currently my main challenge with seeing a lot of those exciting protocols, other delays, perps options, like whatever, is we actually have no idea whether there is actual product market fit at all because the number of users is ridiculously low. And it can very well be that all those winners from this cycle, like when the real adoption comes, we'll actually see them losing because they actually did not optimize for average joe from the street, basically.
01:16:22.828 - 01:16:49.278, Speaker B: Yeah, great. I was actually talking about this with Imran the other day about how we think that the vast majority of incumbents today will be dethroned in a few years, because today the actual number of users in crypto is very small compared to the total number of humans, it's basically zero. So when all the humans come into our space, it's not inconceivable that the incumbents get dethroned by a better and newer product.
01:16:49.444 - 01:16:49.918, Speaker C: Great.
01:16:50.004 - 01:16:57.170, Speaker A: Well, we're at time. Dan Evgeni, thanks so much for your time. It was great talking to you guys and learning more about your thoughts on uniswap V four.
01:16:57.320 - 01:16:58.660, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
01:17:01.750 - 01:17:20.226, Speaker A: That was a great chat. Learned a lot about Uniswap V four and what hooks can enable Uniswap X and how Evgenny was thinking about it. Seems like Fgeni is actually interested in participating in uniswap v four. Sorry, in uniswap X, maybe even as a filler.
01:17:20.338 - 01:17:20.950, Speaker B: Both, actually.
01:17:21.020 - 01:17:36.554, Speaker A: Both? Yeah, both. Which I thought was very interesting. I think the one thing he said was being that gas is that low, it's a no brainer in regards to being able to at least participate on the arbitrage. Like, maybe we can summarize all of this for our listeners.
01:17:36.682 - 01:17:37.262, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:17:37.396 - 01:18:05.746, Speaker B: So I can mention a couple of details that Afghanistan said. Well, first of all, Winterme does not participate in v three as a maker. They participate as a taker. And that exactly what we suspected before going into the interview, that the flow is very toxic on v three for makers. Meaning the impermanent loss is positive for the makers. Right. And that has to do with the way the amms are constructed.
01:18:05.746 - 01:18:51.602, Speaker B: It doesn't provide enough flexibility, enough customizability for the market makers to build profitable strategies. But in v four, the hooks might enable that. And Afghania seems pretty excited to try it out. So that's the first detail. Another detail is that, well, actually, to confirm what Fgenia said, Dan said something very interesting about the impermanent loss studies that people have done about v three. It seems that impermanent loss is actually like makers actually lose money over time on v three on aggregate, especially in the big pairs. So by big pairs, we probably mean the likes of ETh USDT, right, rather than the long tail of shitcoins.
01:18:51.602 - 01:19:16.874, Speaker B: So for those big pairs, the makers actually lose money. And even Dan said he's not really sure why people still provide liquidity in unionswap v three. And that is a really important point, because in the long run, people will realize that they don't make money as a maker. And if that persists, the LP liquidity will go down over time.
01:19:16.992 - 01:19:24.082, Speaker A: But, I mean, Uniswap has been launched since, what, three, four years? I mean, people should have came to that realization already.
01:19:24.216 - 01:19:47.990, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's possible that there's so much uninformed money that it keeps getting recycled. So, like you're a retail person, you go into uniswap v three as LP, you provide liquidity for three months, you lose money, you withdraw. But then there's other people who join without knowing this. So there's other people who join. So the liquidity is constantly getting recycled.
01:19:49.210 - 01:20:50.778, Speaker A: But let's play devil's advocate. Well, I wouldn't say devil's advocate, but maybe something that we're seeing with hooks, right, is the idea with hooks to return some of the profits back to the makers. An example that we talked about with Dan was the idea that you could build a hook that enables traders or arbitragers to pay a fee to get access to the arbitrage opportunity per block. Because right now there's a free writers problem. And the free writers problem today is the fact that since the maker side, so far, arbitragers are able to get a free option to be able to arbitrage away the profits against a sex right or a centralized exchange. And because of that, there's that impermanent loss that makers feel every time. And so what he wants to do is create a hook that enables these arbitragers to pay a fee back to the maker in order for them to get that options, free options right.
01:20:50.778 - 01:21:16.562, Speaker A: So that way they can arbitrage that opportunity away. And that rent that is being paid per block would go to the maker side. And the question is, if you think about this specific opportunity, is this like a way to make makers whole again from the impermanent loss side? And if that's the case, could other hooks be enabled, whereby whatever strategy that they create, a part of that fee goes back to the maker side to make them whole.
01:21:16.696 - 01:21:17.380, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:21:17.930 - 01:21:37.962, Speaker B: I don't know how things will play out, but there are many ways, at least on centralized exchanges, to make the maker whole, and the ways to make the make. To enable these ways to make the maker whole, you need enough flexibility and customizability. And that's exactly the advantage of order books compared to amms, for example.
01:21:38.016 - 01:21:38.618, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:21:38.784 - 01:22:32.106, Speaker B: So hopefully, hooks do provide enough flexibility to enable these ways to make makers whole. So here's another detail that Afghani mentioned many times on v three. He wants to pull liquidity, and he can't, either because it's too late or because it's too expensive to withdraw. And I know this from personal experience, because I've done market making in the past, that when to withdraw your liquidity is the single most important. And difficult decision to make as a liquidity provider. And if V three doesn't give you enough flexibility to do that, then it's never going to work for professional market makers. And it feels like, at least according to Afghani, V four is something that can enable you to build sophisticated strategies to withdraw your liquidity at the right time.
01:22:32.106 - 01:22:34.814, Speaker B: So that's the most important thing about market making.
01:22:35.012 - 01:22:42.910, Speaker A: A lot of it just seems like gas improvements that will enable more and more professional market makers to come onto the space. Right.
01:22:42.980 - 01:22:48.126, Speaker B: It's gas improvement and also the flexibility that hosts provide. Yeah, it's combination.
01:22:48.238 - 01:23:34.542, Speaker A: And this is enabled because when you have singleton contracts where all the contracts are on a single or smart contract versus several, and then also they enable flash accounting. So instead of being able to transfer tokens internally, they just have this simple accounting system that's put into place that kind of takes into action where these tokens should go, but then disperse the tokens at the end as if where the token should go between the singleton, between flash accounting and then the hook architecture, which know, before they would have oracles or the price accumulators per block, now they're sourcing that out to hooks. I think between these three, I think there's a huge improvement on the gas side that makes it much more opportunistic for market makers like Wintermew to join and start to become more professionalized.
01:23:34.686 - 01:24:18.426, Speaker B: Yeah, and related to this whole discussion of toxicity for makers. So we actually also talked about Uniswap X, which is actually really related to V four. The two are related. We'll talk about why. But Uniswap X, as we suspected, feels directly competitive to cal swap and very similar in design to one inch fusion, where basically when the taker or trader signs a transaction, a no fee transaction, about their intent to trade, there is what they call fillers. Other people use the word. What's the other word that they use in anoma?
01:24:18.458 - 01:24:18.922, Speaker A: Solvers.
01:24:18.986 - 01:25:19.810, Speaker B: Solvers, that's right. And also one inch used the word resolvers. So I think they all mean the same thing. These are basically professional market makers that take the other side of the trade of the taker off chain and then they decide how they want to internalize the flow. The problem with this architecture is that basically the fillers or the solvers, they have a first look into the trading flow and they can decide whether or not they want to take the flow. And normally a good solver or filler, by good I mean economically rational solver or filler will take the flow only if they think that it's profitable to do so. So they will be on the other side of all the uninformed flow, and that will leave the informed flow passed by them, which ultimately gets settled on chain in the Uniswap amm or v four.
01:25:19.810 - 01:25:54.346, Speaker B: So this is where v four and uniswap X are related. Let me finish. The result of that is that because you have these fillers, like winter mute and others, that are very sophisticated, and they have first look on the trading flow. That means that the flow that ends up getting settled on chain is extremely, extremely toxic for the uniswap lps. They are already very toxic in v three. But imagine v four with uniswap X. It means that the lps in Unisop, the flow that they're getting is extremely toxic.
01:25:54.346 - 01:26:06.542, Speaker B: So I think that Uniswap lps will lose even more money with Uniswap X. And that's the conundrum that uniswap is facing, that Dan and Hayden are facing.
01:26:06.686 - 01:26:13.422, Speaker A: Interesting. I thought it was going to be the other way around where the toxic flow would be outsourced elsewhere.
01:26:13.566 - 01:26:15.700, Speaker B: Well, so where do you think they will be?
01:26:16.970 - 01:26:21.094, Speaker A: Mean, it could be outsourced through other. Right, sure.
01:26:21.212 - 01:26:21.542, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:26:21.596 - 01:26:40.134, Speaker B: Yeah, it could. So the toxic flow, again, the fillers and solvers, they have first look at the flow. So they will get the best flow for them. Whatever that's left over is more toxic than it was. And that flow could end up on centralized exchanges. It could also end up on the uniswap amm.
01:26:40.262 - 01:26:47.802, Speaker A: Yeah, it can. I just don't know how much of it is going to go to the lps of Uniswap versus exchanges.
01:26:47.946 - 01:26:53.760, Speaker B: Correct. But on average, it should be more toxic than it used to be without Uniswap X.
01:26:54.610 - 01:26:55.680, Speaker A: But why?
01:26:56.210 - 01:26:58.818, Speaker B: Because you have the fillers that get the first look.
01:26:58.904 - 01:27:09.334, Speaker A: So the fillers get the first look. Okay. And then they see the disparity in price, let's say, on Uniswap, and then they trade against that because they get a better price arbitrage opportunity on Uniswap. Is that the idea?
01:27:09.452 - 01:27:36.186, Speaker B: Yes. Again, the intuition behind this is that the fillers are very sophisticated. They will only trade against the flow that is dumb and uninformed. So on average, they will make money. And what that means is, on average, whatever flow that they don't trade against is very toxic.
01:27:36.298 - 01:27:47.714, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good point. So this means that if what you're saying is true, this means that lps that are providing liquidity for Uniswap are going to hurt even more.
01:27:47.832 - 01:28:46.310, Speaker B: Yes, there's an analogy from tradfi for those who are familiar with how citadel and others work. So the payment for order flow, basically you as a retail trader. So, imran, let's say you trade on Charles Schwab or fidelity. Well, you're not uninformed flow, but the average retail is uninformed. The average retail loses money, but the likes of Citadel and others, they get the first look into your flow so they can trade against you, the retail, and they will trade against whatever flow where they can make money on, leaving the rest to settle on exchanges like Nasdaq, Nic, et cetera. And the leftover flow is bad for Citadel, would be bad for Citadel, and therefore they would be bad for the market makers on Nasdaq and Nic. But Citadel doesn't want that, and Citadel has the option to not want that because they get the first look.
01:28:46.310 - 01:28:48.406, Speaker B: So it's the exact same analogy here.
01:28:48.508 - 01:29:25.650, Speaker A: Interesting. I'd love to see this play out if you think about. Okay, so that's one. Right. The other element is Dan mentioned is cross chain also, where in theory, by having, you have roll ups as a service. Right, and you have liquidity on all of these roll ups as a service. And the idea here is now it's very easy to just trade on USWAP X by providing what you're looking for, and then you have the fillers that will then source the liquidity between chains to provide the assets for the trade.
01:29:25.650 - 01:29:34.414, Speaker A: I feel like there's a lot of mev that could be captured in that flow as well. Right. And we've never really talked about cross.
01:29:34.462 - 01:29:39.430, Speaker B: Chain mev, but that mev, in my mind, basically goes to the fillers.
01:29:42.330 - 01:29:42.646, Speaker A: And.
01:29:42.668 - 01:29:50.300, Speaker B: They can do arbitrage or whatever other statistical arbitrage that they can build.
01:29:52.110 - 01:29:52.534, Speaker C: Leaving.
01:29:52.582 - 01:29:54.810, Speaker B: The most toxic flow to onchain.
01:29:55.630 - 01:30:33.794, Speaker A: And I also think if you look at, I've done many cross chain trades, and the spreads are horrible. It's just horrible. There's just no way. It's like you're better off just buying the tokens on Coinbase and sending it to the wallet of your choice. Yeah, there's just no way spreads are too high. The best I've seen in terms of spreads is, like Axelr, they've done pretty good, but outside of that, it's very hard to get the right spreads. So I would assume in this case, a lot of the fillers will source liquidity from probably exchanges here, centralized exchanges.
01:30:33.794 - 01:30:46.540, Speaker A: That's right, centralized exchanges. And so maybe there will be some mev that will be captured from that. But even from the spreads perspective, I think it's just going to be much better to trade against that from using.
01:30:46.910 - 01:31:03.962, Speaker B: It'll depend on whether or not uniswap x can attract the best market makers because the spread that you're getting as a retail is basically a function of that. The more professional market makers there is in the whole network, the tighter the spread and the better price you get as a retail.
01:31:04.106 - 01:31:38.694, Speaker A: Okay, so let's talk about this a bit more because right now if you look at Matcha, Matcha has an RFQ system and with this RFQ system they have a whole off chain RFQ system where they have market makers that get the flow and then they provide the liquidity for that flow. Right. That's kind of how it works. And so it is like an intent based architecture, right? To a certain degree, yes. And one inch does this with fusion. So how much competition do you think this is going to put pressure on for both matcha and one inch and cowswap to that degree?
01:31:38.742 - 01:31:41.210, Speaker B: It seems to me that it's directly competitive.
01:31:41.370 - 01:31:55.990, Speaker A: Yeah. And if it's directly competitive, this could mean that matcha and one inch and others will have to do a lot more here to stay competitive. Otherwise their margins are going to get eaten alive.
01:31:56.090 - 01:31:56.978, Speaker C: That's right.
01:31:57.144 - 01:32:25.546, Speaker A: So I guess the question I'm asking here is what is the evolution of the aggregation layer going to look like over the next six to twelve months? And I'm pointing to the wallet, Uniswap wallet that has launched. Then you have the aggregation layer and then now you have the liquidity layer. So it seems like Uniswap is going after every layer and they're doing this purposefully right before, let's say if we do get a bull market right before the bull market.
01:32:25.728 - 01:32:43.390, Speaker B: I think you're exactly right. So Unisop is fighting every single one of their competitors on every single front at the aggregator layer, layer at the wallet layer and at the liquidity layer. And by the way, one inch was only at the aggregation layer.
01:32:44.550 - 01:32:48.450, Speaker A: They tried the Amm layer and I think they failed.
01:32:48.870 - 01:32:50.066, Speaker B: Did they try it?
01:32:50.168 - 01:32:55.122, Speaker A: They did. They launched Amm pools a year and a half ago.
01:32:55.256 - 01:32:55.940, Speaker B: Okay.
01:32:56.310 - 01:33:56.086, Speaker A: And I wouldn't call it failure, but it was very hard to get liquidity on some of the pools that they had. So I still think they have some pools, but it's not nowhere near Uniswap's breadth and depth of liquidity matcha. They're just purely an aggregator layer. That's where they're staying and they're doing gasless swaps and making it. Their focus is primarily on price, and the best execution is their focus. So the question then is what would this evolution look like? Meaning will Uniswap just completely cannibalize one inch? Will Uniswap completely cannibalize matcha being that there's only 40 50 million active users, of which maybe 10% use aggregators, 15% use aggregators, whatever it is. Would this mean with the launch of wallets that all new flow that comes into the crypto space will be owned by Uniswap and therefore matcha and one inch would be left?
01:33:56.188 - 01:34:09.162, Speaker B: The point being, Uniswap is fighting their competitors on multiple fronts with the launch of wallets, but also recently Uniswap X and the AMM V four.
01:34:09.296 - 01:34:31.006, Speaker A: Yeah, so we'll see what happens to Uniswap v four, Uniswap X in the upcoming bull run. But for founders that are looking to build in a space, if you're looking to build hooks around the hook architecture, feel free to dm us would be interested in learning more about the types of implementations you're looking at. Chow, any final thoughts?
01:34:31.118 - 01:34:54.074, Speaker B: Nothing in particular. It just feels really difficult for startups in Defi to try to compete with the incumbents when they don't have the distribution. The incumbents are not only fighting each other, but also stealing, well, not stealing, but taking the innovation from startups and shove it into their existing distribution. So really hard.
01:34:54.192 - 01:35:28.870, Speaker A: It's very hard. But there is some glimmer, right? If you look at like Pendle and tokenized yield, they're making a comeback, which is very exciting to see. And we're seeing some on the liquid staking side. I don't know how much of it's going to grow, but it's also some interesting things. I don't know what could be taken away from them, from Uniswap and like Ave and others, but it's definitely an area that we're watching.
