00:00:00.400 - 00:00:04.085, Speaker A: Welcome to Good game. Your no BS insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.945 - 00:00:43.643, Speaker B: For this cycle, kind of, I've said it a while back, like last year, is that you're gonna have a ton more people come into crypto this cycle. So a lot of the people that saw Doge go crazy during COVID Solana go crazy during COVID Every, like, all their friends made a ton of money off crypto. There's a lot of people that sold saw crypto do that, then they saw crypto die, thought crypto died, and now it's like, wow, Larry Finks, Bitcoin Spot, ETF Congress is like, yeah, we're supporting crypto. Like all these Trad 5 people are like, yeah, crypto is not going away. So you have a ton of people who missed last cycle, the cycle before that, the cycle before that, have seen crypto for multiple years now.
00:00:43.699 - 00:00:44.523, Speaker A: Multiple cope cycles.
00:00:44.579 - 00:00:56.843, Speaker B: Multiple cope cycles. Like the cope. You can only cope so much. You can only cope so much. Like, watching all your friends making all this money, like, bro, it can't be that hard. Yeah. Like, so there's a.
00:00:56.843 - 00:01:11.805, Speaker B: That like core group of people. That's why I think the degeneracy this cycle is going to be so much more than all the other cycles because there's so much cope from everybody that like, was not in crypto and then now there's no reason, like, you really have no reason to be like, I'm not going to be in crypto because of X.
00:01:11.885 - 00:01:13.453, Speaker A: Like, there's a final cycle.
00:01:13.549 - 00:01:14.861, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so.
00:01:14.973 - 00:01:16.205, Speaker C: Finally.
00:01:16.325 - 00:01:22.957, Speaker B: Literally. Because in my head, like, this is the cycle where tradfi is like, they're passively just going to bid crypto.
00:01:23.021 - 00:01:25.179, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto?
00:01:25.317 - 00:01:26.911, Speaker C: Check out our request for startups list.
00:01:26.943 - 00:01:44.755, Speaker A: And get inspired at Alliance XYZ ideas. But it's like, you know, it's good branding. Right? You know, now everything that I watch on like TV or whatever, I just feel like it's a little corny. Like I just don't really connect with it or vibe with it. Yeah, it's like they don't understand me. Right.
00:01:45.735 - 00:01:50.663, Speaker B: Manufactured stuff that's like. Feels like somebody tried too hard to make it.
00:01:50.759 - 00:01:52.715, Speaker C: Like, like Degen and Normie.
00:01:53.725 - 00:01:57.025, Speaker A: What's up with that? And Herbie or whatever it was.
00:01:57.405 - 00:01:58.245, Speaker C: There was a Herbie.
00:01:58.285 - 00:02:01.965, Speaker A: Oh, sorry. No, there's another one. Brett. Brett. Sorry, Brett.
00:02:02.005 - 00:02:03.173, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, for all.
00:02:03.269 - 00:02:06.173, Speaker B: Honestly, all the base coins are down, like a lot more than I expected.
00:02:06.309 - 00:02:06.861, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:06.973 - 00:02:08.805, Speaker C: Djen, isn't duty still up a lot?
00:02:08.845 - 00:02:09.821, Speaker A: 200 million, dude.
00:02:09.893 - 00:02:10.829, Speaker C: So he's down from a billion.
00:02:10.877 - 00:02:11.493, Speaker A: 2 billion.
00:02:11.589 - 00:02:12.397, Speaker B: Yeah. No, it's not.
00:02:12.461 - 00:02:13.625, Speaker C: Wait, so it's down 90.
00:02:14.445 - 00:02:15.541, Speaker B: It was up a lot.
00:02:15.613 - 00:02:16.973, Speaker C: So it's down 90 already.
00:02:17.069 - 00:02:18.687, Speaker A: It is. Are you recording, by the way?
00:02:18.821 - 00:02:19.787, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm recording.
00:02:19.891 - 00:02:20.451, Speaker C: Oh, nice.
00:02:20.523 - 00:02:21.815, Speaker A: This is great. This is all.
00:02:22.435 - 00:02:35.523, Speaker B: This is like, get right into it. No, no. DJs that, like, DJ significantly down. I mean, but I. I sold the bottom of dj, so I'm like. You sold the bottom before it went to 2 billion. Like, I bought it early, so.
00:02:35.539 - 00:02:36.655, Speaker A: By the way, I did too.
00:02:37.995 - 00:02:38.875, Speaker B: So bad on that.
00:02:38.915 - 00:02:40.443, Speaker C: No, it's still 800 FTV.
00:02:40.499 - 00:02:42.291, Speaker A: Wait, what?
00:02:42.323 - 00:02:43.067, Speaker B: Oh, it's not down that much.
00:02:43.091 - 00:02:43.643, Speaker C: It's not down that much.
00:02:43.659 - 00:02:45.107, Speaker B: It might be 200 circuit. It might be 200.
00:02:45.171 - 00:02:51.213, Speaker A: Oh, 200. Okay. Okay. I mean, I did a quick search. I mean, my fucking deck screener is.
00:02:51.229 - 00:02:55.625, Speaker B: Like, I don't know, infinite now. Yeah. My list, I have. Hello, Dex.
00:02:56.125 - 00:03:01.509, Speaker A: Yeah, but base is like. It's like their shit coins are not as robust as Solana's.
00:03:01.557 - 00:03:17.595, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like all. There's so much attention on base. Like, Coinbase is pushing it hella hard. Like, a lot of the biggest apps on ETH and all the L2s are on base. Like forecasters. There friend tech is there, but the tokens just like, don't trade well, really, every. All the token trading is manufactured right now.
00:03:17.675 - 00:03:18.403, Speaker A: It's manufactured.
00:03:18.459 - 00:03:19.095, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:20.035 - 00:03:28.963, Speaker A: So somebody put up a stat. I'll remember. Like, but it was something in the order of there's 1.2 million daily active users on Solana or something like that.
00:03:28.979 - 00:03:29.763, Speaker B: Yes, there's a lot. Yeah.
00:03:29.819 - 00:03:40.703, Speaker A: And there's like, about 300,000 on base, so I think it has to do with that. Right. And then it just really comes down to onboarding. Like, how do you onboard masses to crypto? It's Phantom, right? For. For Salon, at least.
00:03:40.799 - 00:03:52.527, Speaker B: Yeah. I saw the stats the other day. It was like Phantom was top three in utility apps or something, like on by downloads. Yeah, I mean, Phantom is doing really well. I think every. All the new retail people are definitely going straight to Slana.
00:03:52.591 - 00:04:08.333, Speaker A: Yep. Even in emerging countries like Nigeria, Southeast Asia, Phantom is like the top five. And Soul Flare is too. Like, Soul Flare and Phantom are, like, in the list. So that tells me that people just want to trade coins in Solana.
00:04:08.389 - 00:04:26.797, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I mean, dude, I went. I was in Istanbul, Turkey, for, like, the Solana Crossroads, that conference, and I was taking pictures with, like, I had to take over 200 pictures at the. At the. At the event, but people Told me, like, they literally were flying from, like, some of those countries in Africa. They flew to Turkey from there to be like, yo. Because we know your comment is.
00:04:26.797 - 00:04:32.479, Speaker B: Oh, wow. It's crazy. Crazy for sure.
00:04:32.607 - 00:04:34.355, Speaker C: Did you end up getting the.
00:04:37.695 - 00:04:38.895, Speaker A: Wait, are you talking with the bro?
00:04:38.935 - 00:04:41.551, Speaker B: People roasted me for that so hard.
00:04:41.623 - 00:04:42.927, Speaker A: Is that the Moroccan girl?
00:04:43.071 - 00:04:49.351, Speaker B: No, that's a different girl. Come on. That's a different girl. That's the girl. That's the girl that, like, Meechy, bro.
00:04:49.383 - 00:04:50.303, Speaker A: Oh, it's a me. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:04:50.319 - 00:05:00.343, Speaker B: That's the Meechee girl. She's actually mad chill. She's actually. When I'm coming back out that way. But no, that. Bro, that video, dude, I, like, posted it. Not even thinking it was going to be that big.
00:05:00.343 - 00:05:16.775, Speaker B: I'm like, oh, I know there's some people on crypto Twitter down there at the point, wherever she's at. I'm assuming they'll just, like, go up to her and be like, yo, this dude wants your number. Like, real chill. Cause girls do that to me all the time in the club, people. That was handsome. Yo, it's Z. Like, who's this tall dude dancing? And they're like, go get his number.
00:05:16.775 - 00:05:28.585, Speaker B: But I woke up and I took a nap. I woke up, I saw the, quote, tweets on that shit. I was like, jesus Christ, bro. People were calling me all types of shit. That shit was insane.
00:05:28.755 - 00:05:32.573, Speaker A: One of the guys that, quote, retweeted actually found the girl and.
00:05:32.589 - 00:05:34.317, Speaker B: Found her. Yeah. And got her Instagram and everything.
00:05:34.381 - 00:05:38.205, Speaker A: Az Flynn. Az Flynn is hacking at our MVP hackathon right now.
00:05:38.245 - 00:05:43.901, Speaker B: Yo, I gotta go talk to him. I gotta go talk to him. Yeah, bring him in here and tell the people that she was cool with it.
00:05:43.933 - 00:05:45.597, Speaker A: Az Flynn Asflin.
00:05:45.781 - 00:05:46.477, Speaker B: Yeah. Really?

00:05:48.365 - 00:05:49.261, Speaker B: He got her Instagram.
00:05:49.333 - 00:05:49.901, Speaker A: He's here.
00:05:50.013 - 00:05:52.477, Speaker B: Showed her the tweet, and she was like, yeah. She started laughing at it. Yeah.
00:05:52.501 - 00:05:57.985, Speaker A: Partly why I admitted him was because of that. I was like, this guy's good.
00:05:58.285 - 00:05:59.693, Speaker B: Yeah, he's down for the call.
00:05:59.749 - 00:06:00.529, Speaker C: He's a real hacker.

00:07:17.267 - 00:07:18.891, Speaker B: Like, I landed in Dubai Monday, right?
00:07:18.923 - 00:07:21.275, Speaker A: Well, you were out. I know that. I didn't know if you were drinking or not.
00:07:21.355 - 00:07:22.171, Speaker B: I wasn't drinking the night before.
00:07:22.203 - 00:07:22.323, Speaker A: Okay.
00:07:22.339 - 00:07:28.325, Speaker B: Okay. I landed in Dubai Monday and I was like. I was out drinking till 7am okay.
00:07:28.405 - 00:07:29.629, Speaker A: It was the day before. Okay.
00:07:29.677 - 00:07:31.269, Speaker B: And then Tuesday was the flood.
00:07:31.357 - 00:07:31.717, Speaker A: Okay?
00:07:31.781 - 00:07:42.685, Speaker B: We went out again. The flood was, like, fucked up all the roads. I didn't get back until, like, 10:00am okay. And then Wednesday, I think was a photo shoot. I was chilling. Thursday, I was out at Arthur's party. Like, I think I got back at like, five.
00:07:42.685 - 00:07:43.933, Speaker B: But I wasn't drinking that day.
00:07:44.029 - 00:07:44.629, Speaker C: Hayes.
00:07:44.757 - 00:07:45.133, Speaker B: Huh?
00:07:45.189 - 00:07:45.813, Speaker C: Which Arthur?
00:07:45.869 - 00:07:46.149, Speaker A: Hayes.
00:07:46.197 - 00:07:46.981, Speaker B: Hayes, yeah, Hayes.
00:07:47.053 - 00:07:49.861, Speaker A: He had it at the. I forgot what it's called. But you weren't there.
00:07:49.893 - 00:07:50.469, Speaker C: You were in Dubai.
00:07:50.517 - 00:07:51.389, Speaker A: I was in Dubai. I was there.
00:07:51.437 - 00:07:52.149, Speaker B: It was the Beach Club.
00:07:52.197 - 00:07:52.717, Speaker A: It was the Beach Club.
00:07:52.741 - 00:07:55.861, Speaker B: I didn't go to the party. It was a sick. It was a sick function. Yeah, it was cool.
00:07:55.893 - 00:07:59.049, Speaker A: Yeah. It was just. There was just a lot of traffic that. That week.
00:07:59.137 - 00:07:59.361, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:59.393 - 00:08:00.873, Speaker A: Like, it was just hard to get anywhere, bro.
00:08:00.889 - 00:08:03.121, Speaker B: They should have made the fight on Monday or Tuesday.
00:08:03.193 - 00:08:04.445, Speaker A: Yeah, you would have.
00:08:05.345 - 00:08:08.185, Speaker B: God damn, bro. I didn't sleep all week.
00:08:08.345 - 00:08:18.985, Speaker A: So you got your computer science, so you went to Georgia Tech. Computer science, Yep. What drew you into crypto? Like, what was, like, the initial draw, like?
00:08:19.025 - 00:08:39.827, Speaker B: Yeah, honestly, I wasn't looking to get into crypto, really. At tech, I was studying computer science. Love computer science. Always have been good at math and science. And actually, I, like, wanted to look more into the finance side of things. So I picked up a Minor, which was like a computing and business minor. It's like one of the tech programs that they have there.
00:08:39.827 - 00:09:00.047, Speaker B: And then during that minor, I was taking some classes. And one of the classes was an emerging technology class. And in that class, my professor, like one of the focuses of that class was bitcoin, and that was 2016. So back in 2016 is when learned about what bitcoin original was. Yeah, like, learn why I was important. Learned about crypto a little bit. All my boys, none of us bought any back then.
00:09:00.047 - 00:09:23.953, Speaker B: Unfortunately, in 2016, there's always a copier. Yeah, it's super copier. And then 2017, that's when I graduated from tech. And if you guys remember bitcoin that year, it was like nonstop up all year. So one of the dudes that I was like my mentor, I was working as a software engineer. Mentor, my job was a big crypto guy. So he was like trading on bitrix nonstop on Bitmex, nonstop.
00:09:23.953 - 00:09:44.497, Speaker B: Like every one of our meetings each week he would like, we would talk about coding or whatever and he would start talking about crypto. He's like, dude, you got to get into crypto. You got in crypto, you're smart, you got to learn this too. In addition to doing all that, the software engineering stuff. And so I was like, I think I bought my first bitcoin around like 3k or somewhere probably. I want to say it was like June or something that year.
00:09:44.561 - 00:09:45.265, Speaker A: Oh, 2017.
00:09:45.345 - 00:09:48.481, Speaker B: Yeah, it was summer. Summer that year. June or July.
00:09:48.633 - 00:09:50.885, Speaker C: 3K was when Raoul Powell exited.
00:09:51.265 - 00:09:52.329, Speaker B: Oh yeah, he sold the bottom.
00:09:52.377 - 00:09:54.281, Speaker C: Yeah, he sold, he sold the, at the 3K.
00:09:54.393 - 00:09:55.081, Speaker A: The banana zone.
00:09:55.113 - 00:09:55.685, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:01.585 - 00:10:07.145, Speaker B: That'S why he's talking about the Banana Zone now. He's like, yeah, I'm not selling a 3K again. That's funny.
00:10:07.225 - 00:10:08.441, Speaker A: Basically risk free.
00:10:08.513 - 00:10:29.507, Speaker B: Yeah, it's funny. That's crazy. But yeah, so that's, that's how I got into crypto and yeah, just learned basically self taught from there. Like, I was very active on Twitter and socials before I even did crypto. So my Twitter in college, same way I do now. Like whenever I go out with my friends, like I'm tweeting. I was doing that in college before I even did crypto.
00:10:29.507 - 00:10:43.785, Speaker B: And so it's just like when I added crypto to that, I would be doing that. But then when I'm not doing that, I'll be posting charts, like talking to all the CT people, like figuring out how to learn stuff. And that's basically just like I taught myself how to trade from ct, like some other books that I read.
00:10:43.825 - 00:10:47.825, Speaker A: Were your big followers back then? Like, who were some of the crypto Twitter role models?
00:10:47.905 - 00:10:48.993, Speaker B: My role models back then.
00:10:49.049 - 00:10:49.473, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:49.569 - 00:11:12.593, Speaker B: Well, it was like Trader Main. All his stuff was solid. Kobe, of course, like loom dart. This dude named Conan Corral was a beast. He was an ICT guy. And then bitcoin is a monster. He's like one of the best at comparing, like, when cycles start, when you go from alts to BTC and like laid out a clear map of, like, when you go risk on, risk off.
00:11:12.593 - 00:11:31.089, Speaker B: That's how I learned all the rotations and like all that. I learned that first cycle now 2017 to 2020. Then 2020 came around. I was like, well, I know what to do this time. I'm not gonna fuck around this time. I actually know what to do. I actually missed like most of Defi summer.
00:11:31.217 - 00:11:32.073, Speaker A: Wi fi.
00:11:32.209 - 00:11:56.261, Speaker B: Yeah, Missed, like, missed all the farming stuff where people did like the 10,000% from zero. Missed a lot of that. But was on Uniswap with like, a lot of my boys I was playing poker with that summer, like during COVID because everybody was just home fucking on their computer and doing whatever. And then bitcoin was at like 10k or 9k, whatever. It was in like September and it hadn't moved yet. I'm like, bros. Everything's gone parabolic.
00:11:56.261 - 00:12:05.231, Speaker B: Defi's gone crazy. ETH is. Everybody's on ETH. Bitcoin is still 50% off. All time highs. Like, it has to at least go back to all time highs. And nobody wanted to buy bitcoin.
00:12:05.231 - 00:12:22.751, Speaker B: Everybody's like, we don't even know what that is. We want Uniswap and ETH because they were all new, new to crypto. They didn't have that prior cycle knowing like, alts, bitcoin, alts bitcoin, you know, they didn't even know what that was. Man, that was like my first good trade. And then like Solana and some other stuff too. But yeah, yeah.
00:12:22.823 - 00:12:27.075, Speaker C: How did you know this cycle, at the beginning of this cycle that Solana was going to come back?
00:12:28.455 - 00:12:30.103, Speaker A: That was. That was good.
00:12:30.159 - 00:12:51.949, Speaker B: That was a crazy call. Yeah, that was a crazy call. I mean, I was just super confident because I saw Solana from the very, very beginning. Like, the first time I bought it, it was around like $1.50, very beginning of 2021. And my whole thesis was, if Eth Defi is doing really well, people have issues buying and selling on ETH because the fees are so high. If it's congestion issues.
00:12:51.949 - 00:12:59.265, Speaker B: There's got to be some other L1 where DeFi is also going to pop off and stuff's going to do well. So I was like, that's our research in Solana.
00:13:01.105 - 00:13:02.329, Speaker C: But there were so many.
00:13:02.417 - 00:13:02.769, Speaker B: There were so many.
00:13:02.777 - 00:13:04.865, Speaker C: There was so many, quote unquote high throughput.
00:13:04.985 - 00:13:28.637, Speaker B: There were a lot. So I see. Like, yeah, so Solana and Serum. Actually Jeremy Jing Tao, if you all know Jing Tao, he told me the one to look into Solana and Serum like way back when. And that's when I started researching those two specifically, like looked into SBF and like, oh, this guy knows what he's talking. Then looked into Anatoly, did like listen to all of his podcasts, looked into his background. Nia Slano is one of the early bets that I made.
00:13:28.637 - 00:13:36.301, Speaker B: It's crazy because that thread is all on Twitter. Like I bought it at $1.50 and I'm like, yo, it's going to three, it's going to like five. And then like, then I.
00:13:36.373 - 00:13:41.373, Speaker C: But this was last cycle. This was before ftx, but this cycle after ftx.
00:13:41.429 - 00:13:54.545, Speaker B: I'm getting there, I'm getting there, I'm getting there. So like, so back then it was just like an idea. There was nothing on Solana yet. No defi, no nothing. It's like there could be something here possibly. Let's look at the idea of it. And then it was like radium popped up.
00:13:54.545 - 00:13:59.221, Speaker B: I was using solid. It was like that old wallet before fandom and backpack were even.
00:13:59.293 - 00:14:00.301, Speaker A: Oh, solid. Yes.
00:14:00.373 - 00:14:01.637, Speaker B: The web wallet with the private key.
00:14:01.661 - 00:14:02.861, Speaker A: You have to actually write it down.
00:14:02.933 - 00:14:06.837, Speaker B: Yeah, the web wallet. It was horrible. Horrible web wallet. Oh my God. Worst ux.
00:14:06.901 - 00:14:08.581, Speaker A: Solid. It was the first wallet.
00:14:08.773 - 00:14:21.251, Speaker B: But yeah, I saw like Solan Defi and then like I saw NFTs do really well. I think Magic Eden launched like close round to the top, I think that cycle. And then all the issues with like congestion happened on Salana.
00:14:21.283 - 00:14:21.499, Speaker A: Yes.
00:14:21.547 - 00:14:47.393, Speaker B: It's like everybody spamming these NFT mints, they know it's like free money on every NFT mint. So they're spamming, spamming, spamming. And Solana didn't have any way to deal with like congestion. There was no like fee markets or anything really. And the way that the validators were processing all the transactions was fucking stuff up. So I saw that happen, saw that worst like then I saw 2022. Throughout all of 2022 I was like, well, last bear market, I kind of checked out a little bit.
00:14:47.393 - 00:15:12.105, Speaker B: This bear market, I'm not going to Check out and basically tapped into all the technical upgrades that Solana did that year. And then with the break point in 2022. And listen, like all the talks, talk to a ton of founders, talked ton of people in the ecosystem. And that was when Solana was around, like, $40. And it was just like the sentiment there for everybody at breakfast was super high, regardless of how far down price was. They were like, super excited about.
00:15:12.445 - 00:15:13.589, Speaker A: Mostly builders, too, probably.
00:15:13.637 - 00:15:28.001, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, mostly builders. Yeah. I'm like, yeah, I'm like, there's still builders here. Like, the ecosystem is not dead. And then FTX happened and it literally, like, on the plane back. Oh, my God. From break point flying back to the U.S.
00:15:28.001 - 00:15:34.725, Speaker B: everybody's so happy, so hyped. We just left like the last party and then it's like, boom, $40, $8.
00:15:35.065 - 00:15:35.785, Speaker A: I remember that.
00:15:35.825 - 00:15:39.205, Speaker C: And that was after it reached 200.
00:15:39.505 - 00:15:49.209, Speaker B: Yeah. So it was 260. 240, 260, like peak last cycle. And then it was at $40 during Break Point. Cause I remember. Cause it hadn't made a. It didn't make a lower low.
00:15:49.209 - 00:16:04.217, Speaker B: And when Terra Luna blew up, right, it was like May. May of 2022. I'm like, oh, like, this shit was gotta be the worst. And then June, the 3ac shit happened. And like, Eth went from. It was like the Terra Luna low was like, here. And then Eth went boom, like, down another 30, 40%.
00:16:04.217 - 00:16:14.401, Speaker B: But Solana didn't make a lower low. It was like, it didn't make a lower low. And Solana was the only thing that held that, like, that same level. Bitcoin made a lower low. ETH made a lower low. And Solana was just chilling there. I'm like, okay, that's.
00:16:14.473 - 00:16:14.865, Speaker A: That's weird.
00:16:14.905 - 00:16:16.721, Speaker B: Weird. That doesn't make sense.
00:16:16.753 - 00:16:17.969, Speaker A: You know, some shit's going wrong.
00:16:18.097 - 00:16:48.775, Speaker B: Somebody's buying this down here. So that whole, like the rest of the month of the year is just like chopping around, accumulating. I thought it was bottom, like, for sure, for sure. And then the FTX shit happened, and it went from $40 to $8. And I was like, well, if all the builders that I was just talking to at Breakpoint aren't leaving, and the whole people who are already tapped in as Lana are leaving, they didn't talk about SBF once during Breakpoint. He was not mentioned at all. So if he's the only thing gone and he just have to deal with that and then make it through the rest of his bear.
00:16:48.775 - 00:16:49.779, Speaker B: Good.
00:16:49.827 - 00:16:50.099, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:50.147 - 00:17:08.407, Speaker B: So that was the whole whole Thesis. It was just like, I thought eventually was going to bounce back. And whenever, like bitcoin and eth bounce back for a nice bull market, eventually people are going to bid beta. And I was like, well, it's got to be one of the things that gets bid. So that was a whole thesis for it. But it's just because I saw the whole thing happen. Like, if you came into 2022, like, oh, FTX blew up.
00:17:08.407 - 00:17:09.679, Speaker B: Salon is at $8.
00:17:09.767 - 00:17:10.555, Speaker A: I'm out.
00:17:10.855 - 00:17:15.591, Speaker B: I'm not touching that. Yeah, but I saw the whole up and down all the way.
00:17:15.743 - 00:17:22.167, Speaker A: A lot of the investors during that period remember Chow when that happened, they all left. Like, no one wanted to invest in Solana.
00:17:22.231 - 00:17:22.887, Speaker B: I heard. Yeah.
00:17:22.951 - 00:17:24.487, Speaker C: Even some builders left.
00:17:24.551 - 00:17:25.943, Speaker A: Builders left and that.
00:17:26.079 - 00:17:33.983, Speaker C: So you and I both had very strong conviction in Solana, but there was a point where we started seeing some builders started to the waiver.
00:17:34.079 - 00:17:34.755, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:35.455 - 00:17:43.511, Speaker C: So that gave me a little bit of doubt. But over the course of the next, like three to six months, we realized there's still a core group of builders that stayed.
00:17:43.583 - 00:17:43.815, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:43.855 - 00:17:51.079, Speaker C: But that was what gave me. And that was still Solana between 10 to 15. That was like generational buy.
00:17:51.127 - 00:17:57.135, Speaker A: Yeah, generational buy. But the people were like the founders that stayed. They were incredibly passionate.
00:17:57.215 - 00:17:58.111, Speaker B: They were locked in.
00:17:58.183 - 00:18:04.271, Speaker A: To the point was Drew. Like, I drew into that. I use that as like a source of energy to say like, yeah, fuck you guys, right?
00:18:04.423 - 00:18:06.131, Speaker B: Yeah, like, guys, bro.
00:18:06.203 - 00:18:07.627, Speaker A: Judo guy. Tensor. Guys.
00:18:07.651 - 00:18:08.815, Speaker B: Yeah, Tensor guys.
00:18:10.035 - 00:18:10.907, Speaker A: Matora.
00:18:10.971 - 00:18:11.655, Speaker B: Yep.
00:18:12.235 - 00:18:13.307, Speaker A: You said Kamino, right? Yeah.
00:18:13.331 - 00:18:17.523, Speaker C: Camino, Phantom, Soul Flare, Magic, Eden, all those guys.
00:18:17.659 - 00:18:19.387, Speaker B: And then like, none of them had tokens yet either.
00:18:19.451 - 00:18:19.699, Speaker A: No.
00:18:19.747 - 00:18:21.379, Speaker B: Yeah, I was like, well, bro, I'm.
00:18:21.387 - 00:18:23.015, Speaker A: Like, they make it out of this.
00:18:23.315 - 00:18:29.179, Speaker B: None of them have tokens yet. All that Eth Defi stuff happened because I missed that last cycle. I missed like, the WI Fi, the.
00:18:29.187 - 00:18:30.131, Speaker A: Radium serum, the urine.
00:18:30.163 - 00:18:38.429, Speaker B: Like, I missed all those. And then I was like, a lot of the. One of the main issues that Solana had its first cycle was that all Solana Alter were scams.
00:18:38.477 - 00:18:41.709, Speaker C: Like, they literally were all the worst high FDV bullshit.
00:18:41.797 - 00:18:52.385, Speaker B: They were terrible. And some of them didn't even release products, like release coins and never even release a product. It was that bad. So I was like, I know the sentiment cannot possibly get any worse.
00:18:54.365 - 00:19:02.305, Speaker A: You know, it seems like Ethereum. Ethereum first launched. They had the ICO boom where everybody scammed everyone, half the shit didn't work.
00:19:02.905 - 00:19:08.217, Speaker B: And nobody believed in E. Nobody believed in E. And then Defi came out of nowhere and everybody who was still there, made whatever.
00:19:08.321 - 00:19:09.417, Speaker A: All the other people were coping.
00:19:09.481 - 00:19:09.705, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:09.745 - 00:19:12.433, Speaker C: Like, Solana is behind Ethereum by one cycle in many ways.
00:19:12.489 - 00:19:12.681, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:12.713 - 00:19:17.721, Speaker C: Like, the bottom that cycles Solana was the 2017 cycle, Ethereum.
00:19:17.833 - 00:19:19.657, Speaker A: So the question is, who is the.
00:19:19.681 - 00:19:22.485, Speaker C: Next runner up, the next Solana?
00:19:23.425 - 00:19:26.725, Speaker A: If we're going. You don't have to say it. Whatever.
00:19:27.425 - 00:19:29.665, Speaker C: If there is one, what would it be?
00:19:32.045 - 00:19:41.749, Speaker B: Damn, that's a tough question, man. I don't think I do yet. Because I need to see, like, their first cycle, and we got to get to the end of this cycle to kind of see what that looks like.
00:19:41.797 - 00:19:42.117, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:42.181 - 00:19:48.165, Speaker B: And I'll probably know better, but throw a dark. I don't know, throw a dart right now, this cycle, Solana.
00:19:48.245 - 00:19:55.525, Speaker A: Yeah, we should all ask us. Like, I want to hear yours. I'll tell you mine.
00:19:55.565 - 00:20:30.819, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I probably guess Monad right now is not even out yet, but it seems like the way sentiment's kind of forming around it, and it seems like it's gonna be something relatively new where it's gonna be like EVM built from the ground up in a way that can perform the same way that Solana does. That'll be like a new entry, I guess, to the market, really. And we'll see, I guess, where it comes out at. But the thing is, when Solana came out, it came out at like 400, 500 mil, whatever it was. And it's like retail had a ton of time to buy the 400, 500 mil. All these L1s now come out multibillion every single time. Because Salon already proved itself.
00:20:30.819 - 00:20:32.027, Speaker B: It's like the thesis is proven already.
00:20:32.051 - 00:20:33.131, Speaker A: So they comp against that.
00:20:33.203 - 00:20:42.739, Speaker B: I honestly think, like, this cycle, the equivalent Solana trade, where it's like, you're going to retail is going to print a lot. Is app, like, apps specific, like applications, consumer apps. So that's what I think.
00:20:42.787 - 00:20:45.067, Speaker A: It's going to frontech or pump or.
00:20:45.171 - 00:20:54.673, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. It's like, whatever that. That's where I think, like, 100% agreed with that thousand X. Because nobody believes in apps and crypto. Everybody's like, oh, I want to buy infrastructure. I want to invest in infra apps.
00:20:54.673 - 00:20:56.945, Speaker B: You have to, like, do it. It's a lot harder to be proven.
00:20:57.065 - 00:20:58.765, Speaker A: Like, right, Alpha guys.
00:20:59.665 - 00:21:02.761, Speaker C: It's actually now harder to build apps than to build infra.
00:21:02.953 - 00:21:03.945, Speaker B: You said what Not.
00:21:04.025 - 00:21:05.409, Speaker C: It's harder to build apps.
00:21:05.457 - 00:21:05.705, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:05.745 - 00:21:06.297, Speaker C: Build infra.
00:21:06.361 - 00:21:09.285, Speaker B: Well, because. Yeah, because nobody, like, it's hard to get Nobody.
00:21:10.425 - 00:21:11.521, Speaker A: Nobody wants to invest.
00:21:11.633 - 00:21:19.249, Speaker B: Yeah. Everybody's like, that's A dumb idea. Crypto doesn't need that, but I'll buy it. I'll do this next L1 infra. Like, doesn't make sense.
00:21:19.377 - 00:21:23.065, Speaker C: So what's her pick? What's her next cycle? Solana. This cycle. Solana.
00:21:25.045 - 00:21:25.653, Speaker B: Damn it.
00:21:25.709 - 00:21:26.625, Speaker C: I'll give you my.
00:21:30.805 - 00:21:32.445, Speaker A: What, the ones that are live.
00:21:32.565 - 00:21:35.885, Speaker C: Yeah. Or even the ones that are coming up, up and coming.
00:21:36.045 - 00:21:37.253, Speaker A: I'll put three out there.
00:21:37.309 - 00:21:37.945, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:21:39.525 - 00:21:46.093, Speaker A: Swee, Monad, Bearachin. I don't know.
00:21:46.109 - 00:21:48.975, Speaker B: I like Bear Chain. Yeah, I like Bear Chain, actually. Yeah.
00:21:49.095 - 00:21:59.271, Speaker A: Those three are like the ones that I'm seeing. Maybe Aptos, if they get the whole RWA thesis. I don't know. Because I think Mo is really pushing for the RWAs on there. I don't know if where they're at.
00:21:59.303 - 00:22:00.543, Speaker C: But they make a lot of noise.
00:22:00.639 - 00:22:04.855, Speaker A: They make a lot of noise. They're on my timeline more often than all. All the rest.
00:22:04.935 - 00:22:06.447, Speaker B: Yeah, but.
00:22:06.471 - 00:22:10.327, Speaker A: Yeah, it's hard to say, but Those are the 34 that I'm keeping an eye on.
00:22:10.431 - 00:22:10.807, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:10.871 - 00:22:11.567, Speaker A: How about you?
00:22:11.671 - 00:22:16.065, Speaker C: I'm thinking it's gonna be a Ethereum L2 that's going to become a layer one.
00:22:16.445 - 00:22:17.421, Speaker B: Oh, like transition.
00:22:17.493 - 00:22:18.893, Speaker C: A transition to layer one.
00:22:18.989 - 00:22:19.413, Speaker B: Oh.
00:22:19.509 - 00:22:21.173, Speaker A: Actually defy Ethereum's alignment?
00:22:21.229 - 00:22:21.733, Speaker C: I think so.
00:22:21.789 - 00:22:22.901, Speaker B: Oh, that's spicy.
00:22:22.933 - 00:22:23.705, Speaker A: That's spicy.
00:22:24.085 - 00:22:25.225, Speaker B: Spicy.
00:22:26.445 - 00:22:40.133, Speaker C: It's really hard to bootstrap a whole new ecosystem from scratch. And so I think one of the incumbent L2s, Ethereum L2s, like Arbitrom Optimism. Blast those. One of those guys will become a layer one.
00:22:40.189 - 00:22:43.217, Speaker A: Did you see the hyperliquid announcement, Yo?
00:22:43.281 - 00:22:44.593, Speaker B: Yeah, I did see that.
00:22:44.729 - 00:22:45.521, Speaker A: I didn't read into it.
00:22:45.553 - 00:22:46.673, Speaker B: That's a sneak one. Yeah.
00:22:46.769 - 00:23:02.025, Speaker A: I think they're doing parallelized evm or they're doing EVM of some support as the Cosmos SDK. What's really cool about hyperliquid is that they change their consensus algo to the point where it matches the performance of trading on chain. So it's very performant.
00:23:02.105 - 00:23:02.765, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:03.145 - 00:23:18.321, Speaker A: So now they have the mindshare. So they're the number one perp decks right now with its own layer one. And now they're focused on building this kind of EVM compatibility parallel. I don't know if it's paralyzed or not, but I just saw a bunch of tweets that says that they're doing. They're going to compete with monads. I'm assuming that's what it is.
00:23:18.393 - 00:23:19.545, Speaker B: Yeah. They're going to do L1. Yeah.
00:23:19.585 - 00:23:22.337, Speaker A: They could manifest themselves into being a competitor.
00:23:22.401 - 00:23:46.191, Speaker B: You Know what's interesting? What they kind of did what a lot of apps kind of like stumbled into doing, where it's like an application does so well that they have to leave the roll up or leave the L1 they're on, then build their own app chain. They were like, no, we know. This is what we're going to do from the jump. We're going to build an app that better than all the other apps and then we're going to put an L1 on top of it because we already have all the users here. That's a really smart way that go to market that they did it.
00:23:46.223 - 00:23:47.351, Speaker A: That could be the dark horse.
00:23:47.463 - 00:23:51.775, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that is the dark horse, actually. Dark. Yeah, Hyperlink would. I agree with that. A lot of people like the.
00:23:51.855 - 00:23:54.223, Speaker A: I was blown away when I saw that tweet. I'm like, holy shit.
00:23:54.319 - 00:23:56.255, Speaker B: Yeah. Wait a minute.
00:23:56.295 - 00:23:57.695, Speaker A: And they already have users?
00:23:57.815 - 00:23:58.567, Speaker B: Yeah, they already have users.
00:23:58.591 - 00:24:00.063, Speaker A: There's ton of users that are on.
00:24:00.079 - 00:24:08.981, Speaker B: The layer one because that's the thing with every new L1, the hardest part is getting users because they always have. They start from zero on users. You have all this money, you have all this funding, but you don't have any users.
00:24:09.053 - 00:24:14.869, Speaker A: So Blast did this really well too. So what blasted was they got the tvl. Yep.
00:24:14.957 - 00:24:16.237, Speaker B: So got the DJ on there.
00:24:16.261 - 00:24:25.037, Speaker A: They got the DJ and so they have the native yield the TVL and then the degens and they kind of bootstrap their ecosystem that way.
00:24:25.101 - 00:24:25.581, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:25.693 - 00:24:40.795, Speaker A: So I think we're going to see new and unique ways of how layer one, Layer twos are going to bootstrap their ecosystems such that they'll have some sort of fortified defense system of bringing users or developers onto their platform. And so I do think other L2s are going to start losing.
00:24:42.855 - 00:25:00.515, Speaker C: So next cycle it's starting to look like it's apps turning into chains, hyperliquid, blur into blast. And then there's a bunch of apps that found product market fit that are probably going to launch their own L2s, if not layer ones. So these are the dark horses.
00:25:01.245 - 00:25:04.305, Speaker B: That's a combination of all the theses. Then we just, we just did that.
00:25:06.445 - 00:25:08.345, Speaker A: We should have an investment committee meeting.
00:25:12.685 - 00:25:19.173, Speaker C: And apps are so much undervalued compared to infra. They're valued at like 1 10th, if not 100th.
00:25:19.229 - 00:25:27.503, Speaker A: It's crazy. I don't know if we should record, but the fantasy guys, they pitched a lot of investors and a lot of people said no. Right. You know, now they come back saying.
00:25:27.559 - 00:25:30.235, Speaker B: Hey, we changed our Mind now, let us invest.
00:25:31.855 - 00:25:34.143, Speaker C: Fantasy could easily become a layer too.
00:25:34.279 - 00:25:35.607, Speaker A: Easily. Yeah.
00:25:35.751 - 00:25:38.155, Speaker B: No, for sure. I mean, how many users they have right now?
00:25:38.495 - 00:25:41.835, Speaker C: I don't know how many users, but they have dollars. Last week.
00:25:43.895 - 00:25:46.311, Speaker A: The last tournament, they had 7,000 people playing.
00:25:46.383 - 00:25:46.775, Speaker B: Okay.
00:25:46.855 - 00:25:49.743, Speaker A: The tournament before that, the first one was 18,000 people.
00:25:49.879 - 00:25:50.407, Speaker B: Okay.
00:25:50.511 - 00:25:57.343, Speaker A: So it's kind of leveling off as far as who's playing and who's actually farming. I mean, I'm playing the shit out of it right now.
00:25:57.439 - 00:25:58.631, Speaker C: I'm playing as a hero.
00:25:58.743 - 00:26:05.103, Speaker B: You're playing as I'm a hero. I'm like top three on there. You're acting all the time. All I have to do is tweet. Okay, cool.
00:26:05.279 - 00:26:09.515, Speaker A: Not only are you getting paid from Twitter, now you're getting paid on fantasy, right?
00:26:09.855 - 00:26:10.535, Speaker C: How much?
00:26:10.655 - 00:26:13.143, Speaker B: I've actually made a lot off the social fi stuff.
00:26:13.239 - 00:26:13.655, Speaker A: It's insane.
00:26:13.695 - 00:26:22.309, Speaker B: Like, I've made a lot. I've made like off fantasy alone. I think I made right now. I've made 10 Ethan in the first. And that's one week and a half.
00:26:22.397 - 00:26:23.125, Speaker A: Okay, week and a half.
00:26:23.165 - 00:26:35.885, Speaker B: Like week and a half. Yes. That's 10 ETH. Then off. Like I'm making money off Twitter, which is like 3k a month or whatever. And then I'm. But friendsec, I made like 170 ETH off the fees, just off taking a cut of all that.
00:26:36.045 - 00:26:36.747, Speaker C: 170?
00:26:36.903 - 00:26:38.021, Speaker B: 170 ETH.
00:26:38.093 - 00:26:38.549, Speaker A: Yeah, I bought.
00:26:38.597 - 00:26:39.149, Speaker C: Jesus Christ.
00:26:39.197 - 00:27:28.193, Speaker B: Yeah, I can show it to you right now. Yeah, and it's all on Dune, bro. The only thing I don't like about friend tech is like, my wallet is so public on there, so everybody knows exactly how much I made on all of my, like, everything. But yeah, I think, like, the interesting part of apps and crypto is like, we have users who are so degen that they'll spend a lot more than your average person would spend external to crypto. And so it's like there's kind of a, like, disconnect where if you're building consumer and crypto, it's like, do you want to build for the DJ in crypto where, you know, they'll gamble on this and speculate on this? Because people speculate in crypto on everything. Or do you want to build an app that kind of can do both, where it's like you're tapping into the users outside of crypto, they can also use the app, but also the degens can use that. That's like the hardest thing, I think, for consumer apps to do in crypto.
00:27:28.249 - 00:27:31.929, Speaker A: Yeah, I Think the way it could work is the degen is the first core user base.
00:27:31.977 - 00:27:32.249, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:32.297 - 00:27:47.311, Speaker A: And then they eventually have to figure out a way to bring the normies or the retail people into crypto. And I was talking to a fantasy guy yesterday and that's kind of what they're thinking next. How do we expand outside even the pump guys, I was talking to them this morning. They're like, yeah, we're now think of ways to expand the pie.
00:27:47.383 - 00:27:47.855, Speaker B: Right?
00:27:47.975 - 00:27:57.399, Speaker C: Like even friend tech. I wish. Instead of building v2, they just expanded v1 into the normies, bro. Like, is that what you're thinking as well?
00:27:57.487 - 00:28:13.193, Speaker B: There's. There's so much. Friend tech is the one app where it's like, would be so easy to get like these celebrities, artists, whatever. Like all that, like all those people into FriendSec. Yeah. I just don't. It wasn't their focus with V1.
00:28:13.193 - 00:28:23.425, Speaker B: I mean, we'll see what their focus is for V2. But. But yeah, that's one thing where it's like, bro, all these people already have super fans. Yeah, they all have super fans. By like, at minimum, they have 100, 200 super fans.
00:28:23.505 - 00:28:27.713, Speaker A: And we have micro influencers too, like in different sectors. Crypto because burn ups are all over the world.
00:28:27.769 - 00:28:29.113, Speaker C: Right? I'm a micro influencer.
00:28:29.169 - 00:28:29.929, Speaker A: Yeah, you are.
00:28:30.057 - 00:28:30.729, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:28:30.857 - 00:28:32.205, Speaker C: You're a micro influencer.
00:28:32.945 - 00:29:09.101, Speaker B: I'll tell people like, bro, If I made 170 ETH on forensic and I'm like number one on forensic, nobody even knows who I am outside of crypto. If you get any of those big, it's a little bit kind of too fast. But like people are external to crypto. Like any of their favorite musicians, you give them some kind of package where it's like, yo, if this, this is my favorite artist. I know if I buy their friends at key and I wanted the first 100, I get to go to this concert, I get to meet them in person this time. I get this many tickets to this and I get some merch and whatever else. Bro, they're buy for whatever amount because people spend for these like VIP tickets, they'll be like 10k.
00:29:09.101 - 00:29:13.447, Speaker B: I saw Tara Swift tickets going for like what, 20k, 30k for like receipt.
00:29:13.511 - 00:29:13.783, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:13.839 - 00:29:16.999, Speaker B: And friend tech is like, it's lock in. Once you buy the key, you have forever.
00:29:17.047 - 00:29:17.535, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:17.655 - 00:29:29.915, Speaker B: If you have like a lifetime pass that Taylor Swift, whatever your favorite artist is, a lot of people will do that. So that's why I think that's one of the apps where like, if they really hone in focus on that and expand out. You could tap a really, really big market.
00:29:30.935 - 00:29:45.561, Speaker A: So. So V1 is right now. I mean the V1's still there. Like I think that people are just not paying attention to it. People are paying more attention to V2 or the V2, which is the group chats. And so some of the group chats and maybe we could dive into some of the drama that's happening recently.
00:29:45.713 - 00:29:46.485, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:48.065 - 00:29:49.725, Speaker A: Yo, I got dumped on, man.
00:29:50.985 - 00:29:51.641, Speaker B: Super hard.
00:29:51.673 - 00:29:53.393, Speaker A: I mean you too? Because we're part of.
00:29:53.489 - 00:29:54.193, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:29:54.249 - 00:30:05.625, Speaker A: So. So Luke. Luke Martin, great guy. Him and like this guy named Mode Define or something like that. Created a chat. I think Mode defined mind.
00:30:05.665 - 00:30:05.913, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:05.969 - 00:30:09.527, Speaker A: Mine, Mo. Mine created a chat called Hog Crankers.
00:30:09.591 - 00:30:11.623, Speaker B: Crankers Crank for sin or something. Yeah.
00:30:11.679 - 00:30:15.287, Speaker A: So I think it was supposed to become the premier, like kind of meme coin.
00:30:15.351 - 00:30:15.599, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:15.647 - 00:30:16.423, Speaker A: Or meme key.
00:30:16.479 - 00:30:17.271, Speaker B: Mean club.
00:30:17.423 - 00:30:17.983, Speaker A: Meme club.
00:30:18.039 - 00:30:18.675, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:19.415 - 00:30:27.119, Speaker A: And so it went from like, I don't know, like $100,000 to 6 million yesterday and dollars. 6 million.
00:30:27.167 - 00:30:28.635, Speaker B: I was like the market cap of.
00:30:29.415 - 00:30:30.751, Speaker A: One from like 100k to 6 million.
00:30:30.823 - 00:30:31.475, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:32.015 - 00:30:46.291, Speaker A: Luke was the moderator. Mo mine was the president. The president. Someone like sent some tweet. I think he got scared and he dumped 250,000 front tech tokens. So the market went from 6 million to 1.6.
00:30:46.403 - 00:30:49.835, Speaker B: Well, no, he dumped his keys. He dumped his keys first. He dumped all his club keys.
00:30:49.875 - 00:30:50.395, Speaker A: Yes, yes, yes.
00:30:50.435 - 00:30:55.827, Speaker B: On everybody's head. All the club keys. So the market cap went down like whatever 50% of it was because he had a ton.
00:30:55.891 - 00:30:56.739, Speaker A: Oh, that's what happened.
00:30:56.787 - 00:31:06.935, Speaker B: And then he got all the friend from that. Then he sold all the friend to eat mother dude, like multimillion dollars worth. And then just tweeted like. Yeah. Oops.
00:31:08.235 - 00:31:09.627, Speaker A: Oh, he's finger slipped.
00:31:09.651 - 00:31:22.443, Speaker B: Finger slipped or something like that. Yeah, dude, that's the. That's like the game theory thing with the friends. Like, like everything is so public. It's like when you sell, everybody knows. It's like that guy who did it and he dumped on everybody. Yeah.
00:31:22.499 - 00:31:24.135, Speaker C: So we use a non account.
00:31:24.795 - 00:31:28.771, Speaker A: Yeah. We have an 89 account. So we're farming it pretty hard.
00:31:28.883 - 00:31:29.427, Speaker B: We did.
00:31:29.491 - 00:31:46.621, Speaker A: And now we're just like, you know, playing around. So that happened. So Racer. Yes. A couple of days ago, as the market was pumping, or at least hogs were pumping, Racer said that there was discussions of how do you bring tokenize this.
00:31:46.733 - 00:31:47.261, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:47.373 - 00:31:50.981, Speaker A: So someone was trying to create a way to wrap the keys and tokenize it.
00:31:51.053 - 00:32:05.495, Speaker B: I think they're going to. Yeah, I think they have to I mean, it only makes sense because especially with how much of a focus there is on Meme thorns this cycle. If you have a way that, like, meme coins also have these clubs attached to them and then it's like you trade them as you would trade meme coins.
00:32:05.535 - 00:32:06.015, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:06.135 - 00:32:24.767, Speaker B: Then it's like the cap on these clubs is not like a million, 5 million. It's like all these meme coins are going 100 million, 200 million, 500 million. Then it's like completely different. But right now it's all internal to fintech. They haven't really expanded outside of friend tech. So it's like the core user bases are the only people really trading there. And it's on base and all the meme coin volume is on Solana right now.
00:32:24.767 - 00:32:28.469, Speaker B: So it's like. Yeah, but it's definitely interesting.
00:32:28.557 - 00:32:44.981, Speaker A: But they're both going the same path, right? Pump and frontech, they're going down the same destined path, but they're taking two different approaches. One is taking similar, a closed ecosystem approach with the club keys, whereas with Pump, they're just allowing people to launch tokens and form the community.
00:32:45.093 - 00:32:50.293, Speaker C: Was it Alon that famously said all consumer crypto products are going to converge to Pump?
00:32:50.389 - 00:32:51.357, Speaker A: Yes, he said that.
00:32:51.381 - 00:32:52.049, Speaker B: Who said that?
00:32:52.157 - 00:32:53.925, Speaker C: Along the. One of the founders of.
00:32:54.705 - 00:32:57.537, Speaker B: So if that's a bold claim. Damn, that's a bowl claim.
00:32:57.641 - 00:32:58.577, Speaker A: Those guys are bold.
00:32:58.681 - 00:32:59.225, Speaker B: Yeah, they are.
00:32:59.265 - 00:32:59.585, Speaker A: They're bold.
00:32:59.625 - 00:33:02.649, Speaker B: They are. They are. I like them, though.
00:33:02.697 - 00:33:07.513, Speaker A: Yeah. Good product. So I'm curious to hear you have.
00:33:07.529 - 00:33:14.633, Speaker C: Any questions on that or how do you spend your day? Like, what do you think? What do you do on a daily basis? How much time do you spend on Twitter?
00:33:14.689 - 00:33:26.921, Speaker B: Honestly, it changes day to day, dude. I spend a lot of time on Twitter. Um, so, like, more recently, like, I guess last cycle for me, I was like, my day would be like 12 hours on, like, perps and like charts Majors.
00:33:26.993 - 00:33:28.049, Speaker C: Yeah, majors.
00:33:28.097 - 00:33:52.339, Speaker B: Like alts majors. Yeah. So like last cycle I was trying to be like, first every new altcoin rotation, first every new narrative, like, all of that, I'm trading on, like, leverage, back and forth, whatever. And I was just literally at my screen nonstop doing that and obviously tweeting at the same time. And then kind of this cycle I'm building stuff. Also doing angel investing, still tweeting, of course, and then trading Publix as well. But like, more.
00:33:52.339 - 00:34:16.534, Speaker B: More so swing trading. Like, I'm mostly holding the positions that I've had instead of like, trying to catch every like, like perp, whatever level long, like I like when. When Seoul dipped to like whatever, 120, whatever it was in like April, I caught that. And I haven't taken another like really trades. And so I'm like, dude, I think this is it. I'm just going to swing this. And I haven't been like going back and forth with everything.
00:34:18.274 - 00:34:30.658, Speaker A: Okay, so you put a lot of thesis out there, right? So there's a thesis around bitcoin I want to touch on sort of like runes. So pups wizards. I got dumped on pups, but I'm still holding it.
00:34:30.706 - 00:34:32.094, Speaker B: Yeah, so did I.
00:34:32.834 - 00:34:52.934, Speaker A: So did I. Arthur Hayes. Yahtzee. Fuck. So, okay, so you have bitcoin, you have runes, you have arbitrum senko, and maybe boop. You have Solana. The Solana ecosystem.
00:34:52.934 - 00:35:01.810, Speaker A: What are some of the, I guess macro trends you're following? And I'm curious on maybe diving into some of those thesis.
00:35:01.962 - 00:35:45.153, Speaker B: Yeah, let's maybe start with bitcoin. Yeah, I'll start. Overall, my main thesis for this cycle, kind of, I've said it a while back, like last year, is that you're gonna have a ton more people come into crypto the cycle. So a lot of the people that saw Doge go crazy during COVID Solana go crazy during COVID Every, like, all their friends made a ton of money off crypto. There's a lot of people that saw crypto do that, then they saw crypto die, thought crypto died, and now it's like, wow, Larry Fink's bitcoin spot ETF Congress is like, yeah, we're supporting crypto. Like all these Trad 5 people are like, yeah, crypto is not going away. So you have a ton of people who missed last cycle, the cycle before that, the cycle before that, have seen crypto for multiple years now.
00:35:45.209 - 00:35:46.033, Speaker A: Multiple cope cycles.
00:35:46.089 - 00:36:00.233, Speaker B: Multiple cope cycles. Like the cop. You can only cope so much. Cope so much. Like watching all your friends making all this money, like, bro, it can't be that hard. Yeah, like, so there's a. That core group of people.
00:36:00.233 - 00:36:13.875, Speaker B: That's why I think the degeneracy this cycle is going to be so much more than all the other coping because there's so much coke from everybody. Like, was not in crypto. And then now there's no reason, like, you really have no reason to be like, I. I'm not going to be in crypto because of X.
00:36:13.955 - 00:36:15.175, Speaker A: Like, is this the final.
00:36:15.515 - 00:36:34.941, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. Literally. Literally. Because in my head, like, this is the cycle where tradfi is like, they're passively just going to bid crypto. Like we're going to bid bitcoin, eth, etf, probably going to get approved this year, next, whatever, we're going to pass. We bid that and then it's just like stocks just go up into the right. So crypto's gonna go up into the right.
00:36:34.941 - 00:36:59.867, Speaker B: Just how they do. So it's like the volatility is gonna die down after this cycle, but you're gonna have an influx of people who didn't trade crypto. All these other cycles are gonna trade crypto. And I think that's also one of the reasons that memes are doing so well now is cause you have all these people who just wanna trade crypto, but they don't care about or know about all the tech yet. They just know that people can make money trading crypto. So they're gonna trade crypto. So that's like the degen ton of retail I think is going to come into crypto.
00:36:59.867 - 00:37:51.131, Speaker B: That's part of the thesis. And then the other part of that is like, that's why I was so bullish on Salana also is because I knew the Salana community really well, thought it was going to be one of the L1s that came back. And then it's like if you have a ux where it's 100x cheaper, 100x faster than ETH and all these other alternatives, it's going to be so easy for anybody with $10, $100 to trade memes or whatever alts on Solana. And I think there's a big group of people like that that don't have a ton of money, but they are willing to gamble that small amount of money that they have on chain or whatever else. And then like the other part of my main part of my thesis for this cycle is like, this is the one where we're going to have real consumer applications break out in crypto. Because last cycle we had the proof concept with Defi. Before that it was kind of iffy on what like the usage of either all these smart contract platforms used for ICOs.
00:37:51.131 - 00:38:12.503, Speaker B: There weren't really a lot of good apps that came out of that. But Defi was like, there's millions of dollars on chain. There's people using these things. This actually has advantages to existing systems. And now it's like, okay, what other applications can we build? We have the infra. We have enough chains to handle this. If you want to build an app chain, you want to build on Solana, you want to build on the roll up.
00:38:12.503 - 00:38:40.909, Speaker B: There's enough different avenues where people can build what they want. So now it's like we need actual applications outside of just defi. And that's been one of my other main thesis for this cycle is that you're going to have those apps. Bitcoin I think is by default just the easiest one because spot ETF is approved. It's been around forever. It's like you do the comparison to gold which is at all time highs right now, breaking out for the first time in like 10 years, I want to say. So you kind of have the mapping where okay, gold's at whatever 12 trillion.
00:38:40.909 - 00:38:43.021, Speaker B: Bitcoin's at like 1.5.
00:38:43.093 - 00:38:44.345, Speaker A: I love the comps.
00:38:44.925 - 00:38:58.715, Speaker B: All I do is comps in their head. Easiest to play like your gold. 12 trillion, Bitcoin 1.5 trillion. Okay, let me allocate 1% to Bitcoin or 2% to Bitcoin. That's like, I love, I think the three, three main things.
00:38:59.175 - 00:39:02.595, Speaker C: Do you think BTC will be up only or down only?
00:39:03.935 - 00:39:35.121, Speaker B: Why are you asking me this, bro? I'm super eth BTC bear. I mean I think it'll mean revert in the short term and like the interim, but I still don't see it going to like 0.12, like 0.1 how people think it's going to. And the reason I say that is like ETH BTC back in 2017 it was just ETH. Last cycle was ETH and a couple L2s. Now it's Ethan like 10 L2s all with multibillion dollar valuations.
00:39:35.121 - 00:40:07.901, Speaker B: And all these L2s are also getting bid by people. They all have tokens. You also have competition on like the data availability da side with Celestia and other like Igen or whatever else. Yeah. So it's like before it was everything was on eth execution da settlement. Now it's like eth is just settlement. And it's like how do you reprice that with the entire ethereum ecosystem instead of just being one coin that you bid against at eth? I think the downtrend of eth BTC is not really representative of eth doing bad as an asset.
00:40:07.901 - 00:40:19.573, Speaker B: It's just the eth ecosystem growing and people are not adding those coins to the chart. Like if you added all the L2s right to the ETH BDZ chart, it's at all time highs easily at all time eyes. Yeah, like from cycle to cycle.
00:40:19.629 - 00:40:25.037, Speaker C: So you're actually in the camp that the L2s are parasitic to ETH itself.
00:40:25.141 - 00:40:36.053, Speaker B: I don't think that. I don't. I don't want to say that they're not parasitic per se, they're necessary for ETH to scale. But I think before that happens, you need, you need to increase activity on these L2s.
00:40:36.109 - 00:40:36.325, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:36.365 - 00:40:51.719, Speaker B: Like, if you have an L2. Right. So you have eth. Right. And then you have, say you have X amount of activity on ETH, you add an L2 for the same amount of like, fee, revenue generation, whatever. On ETH, the L1, you need like 10x the amount of that activity on these L2s.
00:40:51.767 - 00:40:51.991, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:52.023 - 00:41:07.113, Speaker B: Which is like what they're built for. But that's going to take years to play out. So there's kind of an interim where you're building out all these L2s on ETH, where you're shifting activity over to the L2s, but then you're going to have to increase that activity by like a significant amount before it makes sense. I think that ETH requires.
00:41:07.169 - 00:41:23.761, Speaker C: Do you see a path for ETH to eventually. Well, I mean, ETH is ahead of Solana now, but Solana is obviously improving at a much faster pace than Ethereum. But do you see a path for Ethereum to catch up to Solana on the technology or UX point of view?
00:41:23.833 - 00:41:35.729, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think if you have L2s that are like, just as good UX as Sol, which I think we will have this cycle, probably, then it's like, how do you get, if you can, how do you compete on the user front?
00:41:35.817 - 00:41:36.065, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:41:36.105 - 00:41:55.521, Speaker B: So it's like, is an integrated L1 just as good of a UX as an L2 that has the same UX as Solana? And that's the question is like, how do you get users to choose your L2 over the L1? Right. But I don't think, like, ETH is really competing with Solana. Like, they're trying to be the most secure settlement layer and Solana is trying to be like the fastest integrated L1.
00:41:55.593 - 00:41:56.289, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:41:56.457 - 00:42:16.723, Speaker A: So, you know, Nerdist Internet out of nowhere. Right. And so the narrative that I'm starting to see is that eth layer 1 could be the RWA layer because of the eth ETF, all the tradfi people are buying Ethereum, so they're trying to push this narrative. I could start to see it already.
00:42:16.819 - 00:42:19.695, Speaker C: Yeah, I pushed it. I helped them. I tried.
00:42:19.995 - 00:42:33.137, Speaker B: You did try to help them. You had a long post. I remember that post. You wrote a long. You were like, guys, stop saying ultrasound. Money and focus on this. Like this is what it's good for.
00:42:33.137 - 00:42:34.729, Speaker B: Do this. I remember that tweet.
00:42:34.817 - 00:42:35.445, Speaker A: It's.
00:42:36.145 - 00:42:37.249, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember that.
00:42:37.297 - 00:42:40.369, Speaker A: You have Athena, you have Ando.
00:42:40.417 - 00:42:41.125, Speaker B: Yep.
00:42:41.745 - 00:42:50.689, Speaker A: Denari now and some of the startups that we're incubating, that's coming out of our last batch of Ocaso. Yeah, they're all kind of launching Ethereum Mainnet because that's where the liquidity is.
00:42:50.777 - 00:42:51.385, Speaker B: Right.
00:42:51.545 - 00:43:02.789, Speaker A: Between that and the etf, could there be a wedge for ETH layer one to be successful with the RWA thesis, or is it all just going to eventually just move away to different L2s?
00:43:02.877 - 00:43:24.495, Speaker B: I mean, I think, I think either. I don't want to say ETH is not going to be successful. I do think ETH is going to be successful. I just think that the better trade the cycle of Solana. But. But Yeah, I think RWAs make a ton of its own ETH because they don't require the like a ton of throughput which other apps on Solana might where it's like you don't need to be doing a thousand transactions per second to put RWAs on ETH. It's the most secure L1.
00:43:24.495 - 00:43:28.879, Speaker B: Like you just need them to whatever be on chain there. So I do think that thesis makes a lot of sense.
00:43:28.927 - 00:43:30.207, Speaker A: So Larry Fink. L1.
00:43:30.351 - 00:43:38.039, Speaker B: Larry Fink. Yeah, Larry Fink. Yo, they should change the ticker to Fink. I would buy fink. I would buy fink.
00:43:38.087 - 00:43:39.599, Speaker A: I would buy a fink meme Coin.
00:43:39.727 - 00:43:41.535, Speaker B: Yo. Yo, we should make that.
00:43:41.575 - 00:43:42.755, Speaker A: I'll make one right now.
00:43:43.375 - 00:43:48.537, Speaker B: Pump Fun. As soon as this goes live, somebody's gonna make a. I'll make it.
00:43:48.671 - 00:43:50.013, Speaker A: I'll make it. I'll launch it.
00:43:50.069 - 00:43:50.705, Speaker B: Bink.
00:43:51.485 - 00:43:56.797, Speaker C: But for you, from a user's point of view, is there any L2 today that offers as good of a UX as Solana?
00:43:56.901 - 00:43:57.637, Speaker B: I don't think so.
00:43:57.701 - 00:44:01.145, Speaker C: Okay. No, I don't think even like base blast.
00:44:01.805 - 00:44:17.449, Speaker B: I don't think. I mean all the current L2s are just EVM L2s. Like some may have more users or like better go to market. I think base has really strong go to market with all their users they have on Coinbase. But. But as far as like user experience. No, I don't think so.
00:44:17.449 - 00:44:19.605, Speaker B: Like fees and like speed. I don't think so.
00:44:20.385 - 00:44:27.105, Speaker C: But base fees are. You're saying that base is actually more expensive than Solana?
00:44:27.185 - 00:44:32.321, Speaker B: I'm sorry. If you had the same amount of activity on like that you have on Solana on base, then it would.
00:44:32.353 - 00:44:34.001, Speaker A: Yeah. 300k users, 1.3 million.
00:44:34.073 - 00:44:34.545, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right.
00:44:34.585 - 00:44:35.249, Speaker A: Or something like that.
00:44:35.297 - 00:44:35.833, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:35.969 - 00:44:41.289, Speaker A: So right now they're probably at parity, right? Who the fees. Is it at parity? Like what's the.
00:44:41.417 - 00:44:54.571, Speaker C: If you were to compare base is at parity with Solana, fees wise, but in terms of tps, base is two orders magnitude smaller than Lana and all the Ethereum L2s combined is one order of magnitude less.
00:44:54.603 - 00:44:55.979, Speaker A: And this is before Fire Dancer.
00:44:56.107 - 00:44:59.651, Speaker C: Also this is before Finance. And this is after 48, 44 and 48, 44.
00:44:59.683 - 00:44:59.867, Speaker A: Okay.
00:44:59.891 - 00:45:00.699, Speaker B: Yep, yep.
00:45:00.747 - 00:45:01.483, Speaker A: After four. Eight, four.
00:45:01.539 - 00:45:02.415, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:45:03.075 - 00:45:04.827, Speaker C: So the hope is on the one end, huh?
00:45:04.891 - 00:45:05.435, Speaker B: So the.
00:45:05.555 - 00:45:12.059, Speaker A: So the bet is. But I heard that also of Mega Eth. Mega E. So they're a paralyzed L2, right?
00:45:12.107 - 00:45:15.403, Speaker B: I heard, I heard of Mega Eth the other day. I haven't, I haven't researched it yet.
00:45:15.419 - 00:45:23.715, Speaker C: But I talked to the founder, one of the founders of Mega Youth, and she said Mega Youth will do more TPS than Monad. I don't know how, but they all say that.
00:45:23.755 - 00:45:25.939, Speaker A: They all say that. That's marketing, right?
00:45:25.987 - 00:45:26.731, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:26.923 - 00:45:52.345, Speaker C: But I told one of our hackathon participants, yes, he was very, he's very technical. He used to work at like, he went to Cornell. He's very technical. But he, he told me that building a very fast L2 is actually harder than building Monad from the ground up. From the ground up, because you have to work with the existing constraints of the EVM and all that stuff. So it's actually easier to build Monad as a layer one.
00:45:52.465 - 00:45:55.313, Speaker A: You don't have any dependencies. Right. Ethereum or anything else like that.
00:45:55.369 - 00:46:12.701, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what I like in my head. It's like, even if you have ETH and all the rollouts building on Eth, it's like if you have Monad and you have Solana, you can build L2s on Modad and Solana if you really wanted to. Like, if you really needed to. So why would you not start at 10,000 TPS instead of starting at 10 TBS?
00:46:12.773 - 00:46:29.605, Speaker A: Yeah. So Vitalik tweeted out a couple days ago, or somebody must have, quote retweeted or something. I don't know how old this tweet was. He said the end game for Ethereum is ZK rollups and then all the state route would be on a layer one. That was. That's the end game, he said.
00:46:29.725 - 00:46:32.325, Speaker C: But, but yeah, this was from like a few years ago.
00:46:32.365 - 00:46:55.735, Speaker A: Okay, so that was a few years ago. Yeah, but somebody quote retweeted and talked about it. Okay, so is that still. Do you think that's still the end game? Because he did talk about ZK rollups in a recent article being the end game for Ethereum. So if they were to go ZK roll ups and if, let's say this prophecy of his comes true, would that keep Ethereum competitive to Solana?
00:46:55.855 - 00:46:57.263, Speaker B: I just don't know how long it would take.
00:46:57.319 - 00:46:57.575, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:57.615 - 00:47:19.255, Speaker B: Like the. I feel like a lot of the not issues, but a lot of the things with Ethereum's roadmap is they have a lot of tech debt that they have to deal with. Whereas if you're building a new L1 from the ground up, like Hyperliquid or Monad or whatever else, they don't have any of that existing tech debt. So it's like you have to be a lot more careful with whatever you add onto Ethereum. I think it's just a lot more.
00:47:20.275 - 00:47:26.787, Speaker A: And what would happen to the L2s that are optimistic roll ups? Right. Do they convert to ZK roll ups?
00:47:26.891 - 00:47:27.747, Speaker C: I think they'll convert.
00:47:27.811 - 00:47:28.323, Speaker A: They would convert.
00:47:28.379 - 00:47:29.619, Speaker C: They'll just swap the underlying.
00:47:29.707 - 00:47:30.337, Speaker A: Okay.
00:47:30.491 - 00:47:33.385, Speaker B: The mechanism. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
00:47:34.165 - 00:47:47.637, Speaker A: So it's just an interesting endgame. I'm just curious on how that's going to compete with Solana in the long run. And Anatoly is also really focused on keeping it a layer one, but apparently on Twitter, there's a lot of L2s that are launching on Solana as well.
00:47:47.821 - 00:47:48.661, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:48.853 - 00:47:52.357, Speaker A: So I think the end game for all layer ones, they're gonna have L2s whether they like it or not.
00:47:52.461 - 00:47:57.825, Speaker C: But Anatoly thinks that L2 song Solana won't make it faster.
00:47:58.205 - 00:48:00.413, Speaker B: I've heard that from him a few times too. Yeah.
00:48:00.469 - 00:48:02.645, Speaker A: But I don't think it's really about throughput at this point.
00:48:02.685 - 00:48:05.365, Speaker C: I think it's about customized customizability.
00:48:05.485 - 00:48:05.981, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:48:06.053 - 00:48:06.989, Speaker C: Like full sovereignty.
00:48:07.077 - 00:48:07.877, Speaker A: Full sovereignty.
00:48:07.981 - 00:48:10.425, Speaker C: Owning the fees and pump the price.
00:48:10.765 - 00:48:17.265, Speaker B: But yeah, I mean, yeah, there's only one coin. The L1 coin. That's the only coin.
00:48:17.765 - 00:48:20.885, Speaker A: So you tell me this L2 on Salon is the only L2 on Solana.
00:48:21.005 - 00:48:23.185, Speaker C: That's the new meta. The new meta.
00:48:23.975 - 00:48:24.915, Speaker A: 50%.
00:48:26.935 - 00:48:27.887, Speaker B: Oh, man.
00:48:27.991 - 00:48:35.115, Speaker A: Oh, man. Okay, so we talked about. Did we talk about runes? Did we go into runes?
00:48:35.975 - 00:48:37.055, Speaker B: Oh, really? I don't think so.
00:48:37.135 - 00:48:42.355, Speaker A: Do you anything in runes that's particularly interesting outside of the stuff that's already on Twitter?
00:48:44.415 - 00:49:11.799, Speaker B: I think I've actually heard, like, chatter from Feuder and people like the bitcoin ecosystem. There's Kind of like a lot of teams working to build something kind of similar or, like, different, but, like, different standards, right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure if runes is, like, the end state. I don't really know. But generally in my head, ordinals make sense on bitcoin because of how provenance works and how they're stored directly on chain. With bitcoin, I think that kind of aligns with bitcoin being hard money, like, being around for a long time.
00:49:11.799 - 00:49:30.555, Speaker B: It's like you have this inscription on this block at this time. If you expect bitcoin to be around for, like, 50 years plus or whatever, that's. I expect that to hold value, like, whatever the most important ordinals are. And that was kind of my thesis for, like, why I thought runes would do well, too. It's like they attach, like, whatever coin to those ordinals.
00:49:30.675 - 00:49:31.531, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:49:31.683 - 00:49:34.835, Speaker B: It's like the BRC 20s or whatever.
00:49:34.875 - 00:49:39.059, Speaker A: Yeah, there's BRC 20s. It's like, I have to go get out. Out of Ethereum and Salon.
00:49:39.107 - 00:49:46.479, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. There's too much going on. It's like, bro, it's too much. Just too much, dude. It's too much.
00:49:46.527 - 00:50:02.263, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's like coins are. It's like colored coins, right? So, like, you can inscribe a sat, and the SAT is unique in that. That. That specific SAT has a uniqueness of property, which makes it a. An ordinal. Yeah.
00:50:02.319 - 00:50:07.983, Speaker C: But are you guys still bullish on Wizard Pups? Yeah, Wizard Pups.
00:50:08.119 - 00:50:28.889, Speaker B: I think wizard is, like, the greatest meme ever, bro. Honestly, like, it's literally. Wizard is literally the meme from, like, 2012 or 2013, whatever. It was the Reddit meme when bitcoin was at, like, 20, $30, bro. And it's like, that's the meme where the Doge founder saw that meme. I was like, oh, I'm gonna make Dogecoin the original inspiration. Yeah.
00:50:28.889 - 00:50:41.257, Speaker B: It's like the meme that predated Dogecoin is Wizard. It's just not. It wasn't a coin or a chain or whatever until now. So, yeah, I mean, I think both Pups and Wizard, I think Pups is good because it's kind of like the.
00:50:41.281 - 00:50:43.617, Speaker A: Culture, that community is freaking autistic, man.
00:50:43.681 - 00:50:44.417, Speaker B: They're crazy.
00:50:44.521 - 00:50:50.135, Speaker A: Like, I'll tweet early days, like, January, February. I tweeted like, oh, yeah, Node Monkeys. This is like the one that.
00:50:50.175 - 00:50:51.511, Speaker B: They attacked you, right?
00:50:51.663 - 00:50:54.115, Speaker A: They attacked my timeline. They attacked my dms.
00:50:55.375 - 00:50:58.327, Speaker B: Like, Bitcoin fucking January Bro, they're insane.
00:50:58.391 - 00:51:03.535, Speaker C: Have a question. So those two communities are. They're not bitcoin maxis, are they?
00:51:03.655 - 00:51:04.735, Speaker A: They're not maxi.
00:51:04.775 - 00:51:14.383, Speaker C: They're not Max. By definition, they're not maxis. But are they originally bitcoiners or are they communities that move from, let's say, Ethereum or Solana to bitcoin?
00:51:14.559 - 00:51:31.935, Speaker B: I'm not sure. So the bare thesis for ordinals and runes or whatever is, is that like you're not tapping into new bitcoin money that hadn't been involved in anything else. You're just tapping into djens that are acting like new bitcoin money. It's tapping into these new things like djens that already exist in all these other ecosystems.
00:51:31.975 - 00:51:32.415, Speaker C: Right.
00:51:32.535 - 00:51:34.095, Speaker B: That's like the bear thesis.
00:51:34.175 - 00:51:40.995, Speaker C: That's the mercenary. Yeah. Are you bullish on the bitcoin ecosystem in general?
00:51:41.395 - 00:52:00.455, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I do think there's just a ton of capital there. I'm taking the other side. I think there's a ton of capital, like in bitcoin, they'll just hold in their whatever, hardware, wallets, like long term. They don't really plan on using it and don't really like eth. Don't really like these other chain coins, whatever. And I have seen those people. I know that those people exist for sure.
00:52:00.455 - 00:52:14.329, Speaker B: So if you can tap into them and get them to do DJN stuff, there's a ton of money. Because bitcoin is like the largest coin by far. There's a ton of money there. If you can tap that, that's like a lot of liquidity to unlock. There's a ton of like a few teams are trying to tap that liquidity.
00:52:14.417 - 00:52:20.537, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I think Udi and Eric are working on Opicat, which is the bridge, that.
00:52:20.561 - 00:52:23.361, Speaker C: Kind of competitor to bitvm.
00:52:23.433 - 00:52:32.209, Speaker A: Bitvm, yeah. And that should make runes compatible across all L2s, right? I believe that's correct.
00:52:32.297 - 00:52:33.365, Speaker B: I think so, yeah.
00:52:33.915 - 00:52:41.379, Speaker A: And a lot of other cool stuff that comes out of it. So I'm bullish. Quantum cats and the team behind it, obviously. Anything else you guys want to chat about?
00:52:41.507 - 00:52:43.455, Speaker C: Anything else you're excited in crypto.
00:52:45.275 - 00:52:49.443, Speaker B: Honestly? I'm excited for the rest of the cycle, man. I think it's going to get really, really crazy.
00:52:49.619 - 00:52:50.435, Speaker A: Where do you think we are?
00:52:50.515 - 00:52:51.307, Speaker B: Really, really crazy.
00:52:51.371 - 00:52:52.115, Speaker A: Where are we in the cycle?
00:52:52.155 - 00:52:55.363, Speaker B: I think we're like, like inning three.
00:52:55.499 - 00:52:55.979, Speaker A: Get out.
00:52:56.027 - 00:52:59.043, Speaker B: I swear to God, I'm dead serious.
00:52:59.099 - 00:52:59.475, Speaker A: Wow.
00:52:59.555 - 00:53:30.427, Speaker B: I swear. Well, think about it like bitco bitcoin's at all time highs or like floating around all time highs. If you look at all the other altcoins, they're shit. Yeah, bro, everything's down against BT's top. Like, I saw something the other day that said like 60% of the or 70% of the top 50 alts are down against bitcoin like over the year. If you look at the total 3 chart, which is like the total altcoin market cap, that's still 50% down from its last previous all time high. Um, Solana still at all time.
00:53:30.427 - 00:53:38.459, Speaker B: I by market cap clipped it. Ethereum. Still not an all time high by market cap. There's only. Really, the only thing that's ripped is like memes. Yeah, that's it.
00:53:38.547 - 00:53:38.795, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:53:38.835 - 00:53:54.361, Speaker B: And like, I see my. My account, like my Twitter account has gone crazy, so I know there's at least some new retail coming into crypto. I'm up like plus like 300k followers since December. Something insane. What? Yeah. No, literally, yeah. I'm getting like 100k a month.
00:53:54.361 - 00:53:56.005, Speaker B: Jeez. No, it's crazy.
00:53:56.345 - 00:54:01.513, Speaker C: When I first follow you in January, you are a sub 100. And now you are like what, 500,000?
00:54:01.609 - 00:54:04.569, Speaker B: Like 410, 410.14k or something like that.
00:54:04.617 - 00:54:08.777, Speaker A: I followed you around bald. Did you get. Did you get rugged on bald?
00:54:08.921 - 00:54:09.777, Speaker B: I missed bald.
00:54:09.841 - 00:54:10.445, Speaker A: Okay.
00:54:10.785 - 00:54:18.377, Speaker B: God. Bald, bro. I was like that I knew bass or what Base was launching. I was in the Hamptons. I think that was last. That had to be last summer. I was like, I was in the Hamptons.
00:54:18.377 - 00:54:31.841, Speaker B: I'm like, base is launching. I'm like, bros, I know there's going to be coins on base. 100% going to be coins on base. I don't know what they are, but I know it's going to be a coin on base. I go to sleep, wake up, balls like a trillion percent up. So that's so annoying. I hate that.
00:54:31.873 - 00:54:45.009, Speaker A: Don't worry, it was good. Chow and I were like. Because that night I'm like, yo, I'm going in. So I went in was up to like 30 million, like, showing off or whatever. Got my ass handed to me.
00:54:45.057 - 00:55:08.225, Speaker B: Yeah, bro, he rugged that hard. That's super hard. But yeah, so, I mean, there's like. I know there's a ton of new retail coming into crypto. I know there's people who weren't encrypted before trading crypto because like, some of my friends who saw me trade crypto the past few years are starting to trade crypto now. But like, as far as like that big markup, I don't think we've really had that yet. I honestly really don't think we've had it.
00:55:08.685 - 00:55:10.269, Speaker A: Do you feel the same way?
00:55:10.437 - 00:55:13.205, Speaker C: So. So Don. Don's reign is over.
00:55:13.365 - 00:55:17.745, Speaker B: Don. Yeah. Don versus Anselm, one, Doug, zero.
00:55:20.205 - 00:55:23.469, Speaker C: What do you. What do you think of Don? Like, what happened to him? Like, he used to be a. I.
00:55:23.477 - 00:55:24.757, Speaker B: Like Don a lot. Yeah, Don's great.
00:55:24.781 - 00:55:24.917, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:24.941 - 00:55:34.261, Speaker B: I mean, Don's super smart. He's a really good trader. I mean, you gotta. You gotta think, like, Don also just had a kid. Yeah. So he, like, he's, like, public about that. It's not like, hidden information, but he just had a kid.
00:55:34.261 - 00:55:46.193, Speaker B: And, like, when I went through that, like, you just had a kid, and it's like, you're not really paying attention to markets. I know he hasn't been paying attention to markets for a fact. I know he hasn't been. He just. You can't do it. You literally can't do it in the first few months.
00:55:46.249 - 00:55:48.617, Speaker A: Well, I have two kids and he has two kids, so, like, we get it.
00:55:48.641 - 00:56:03.849, Speaker B: Yeah. It's crazy. So it's like, if you haven't been tapped in the markets, you look at, you pull up whatever TradingView deck screener. It's 80% meme coins. The only thing that's gone up is meme coins. People are like, meme coins, super cycle. It's like, dude.
00:56:03.849 - 00:56:07.879, Speaker B: Yeah, we're top. So I understand why. Why, like, he has that thief. It makes sense.
00:56:07.927 - 00:56:08.595, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:56:09.175 - 00:56:20.435, Speaker B: Yeah. Because they, like, memes usually go last. I said this the other day. They usually go last after everything else. But now it's like, none of the alts have gone yet. Nothing has really moved yet. Yeah.
00:56:20.435 - 00:56:22.159, Speaker B: So. Yeah.
00:56:22.327 - 00:56:23.903, Speaker A: All right, two more. You have any more?
00:56:23.959 - 00:56:24.375, Speaker C: No, go ahead.
00:56:24.415 - 00:56:28.487, Speaker A: Two more. One. I want to. There's a mailbag of people that have asked a couple questions.
00:56:28.591 - 00:56:29.455, Speaker B: Okay. Okay.
00:56:29.535 - 00:56:30.383, Speaker A: Go through that.
00:56:30.559 - 00:56:30.967, Speaker B: Cool.
00:56:31.031 - 00:56:40.433, Speaker A: I want to hear your with war story. Because we went through our own with war story. We bought around. I think I bought once I saw your tweet.

00:56:46.481 - 00:56:56.073, Speaker A: This is early December. And it was. It went from 30 to like three or some shit. It was like. It crashed.
00:56:56.249 - 00:56:56.633, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:56.689 - 00:57:10.799, Speaker A: And then you tweeted it or something. And I just. Yeah, I went. And that shit. Like, it went like. So here's our war story, right? It went around there. We bought it went up to like a hundred or something, and then.
00:57:10.799 - 00:57:12.327, Speaker A: And then it dropped again.
00:57:12.391 - 00:57:12.679, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:12.727 - 00:57:14.167, Speaker A: Like Fuck. Should I hold it or sell it?
00:57:14.191 - 00:57:14.831, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:57:14.903 - 00:57:16.351, Speaker A: And we just held it, right? Yeah.
00:57:16.383 - 00:57:16.919, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
00:57:16.967 - 00:57:19.703, Speaker A: And so that was like our war story. I want to hear your war story, bro.
00:57:19.719 - 00:57:34.775, Speaker B: The whip story is insane. It's so insane. Like, it was so random. I mean, so I started. So one day, I think it was in December, just like after Bonk went crazy. So Bonk was kind of like October. Solana ripped finally out, like above 30.
00:57:34.775 - 00:57:46.327, Speaker B: I was like, finally. Thank God, Solana's moving. I'm like, I'm done with these people telling me I'm crazy for however long. Solana starts moving. Then I'm like, okay, guys, there's only so many alts on Solana. You can buy, buy Bonk. Bonk went crazy.
00:57:46.327 - 00:57:53.943, Speaker B: And then it's like, now everybody's trading on Solana. Every group that's like, solana, Solana, Solana, Solana, Solana. And somebody was like, z, make a telegram. Okay.
00:57:53.999 - 00:57:55.135, Speaker A: Oh, this is the manlets, right?

00:58:16.235 - 00:58:20.067, Speaker A: I think you had a daily write up or a weekly write up. There's a moderator that did that in your chat.
00:58:20.131 - 00:58:27.263, Speaker B: Yeah, like everybody was on. So then I made a chat for it and like everybody's flooded into the chat. So in that chat there's a microcaps channel.
00:58:27.379 - 00:58:27.655, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:27.695 - 00:58:29.703, Speaker B: And it's like millions and millions and millions of messages.
00:58:29.759 - 00:58:30.815, Speaker A: It's so DJ, dude.
00:58:30.855 - 00:58:32.063, Speaker B: It's the most DJing place.
00:58:32.119 - 00:58:32.623, Speaker A: It's insane.
00:58:32.679 - 00:58:43.103, Speaker B: It's insane. They'll post like 10k mark cap coins in there. Honey, K mark cap coins in there. Not SAP trading all day. So in December, one of the coins they kept talking about was whiff. Like with dog. With that.
00:58:43.159 - 00:58:43.583, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:43.679 - 00:58:59.633, Speaker B: And they kept spamming me with it, like all the time. Like, spamming, Spamming, Spam. Z, what do you think about this one? What do you think about this? What do you think about this? And then in the chat, I was like watching this is before. So I met this girl. I met this girl, like out in New York, whatever. I'm talking to her about crypto. She asked me what I do.
00:58:59.633 - 00:59:04.777, Speaker B: I'm Like, I'm trade crypto. I'm on crypto Twitter. I'm showing her crypto Twitter, showing her, like, all the memes and stuff.
00:59:04.841 - 00:59:06.257, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:59:06.281 - 00:59:23.879, Speaker B: And I tweet. I'm like, yo, the number one meme that replies to this was, like, as many replies. I'm gonna retweet it. I replied to my friend's post her Twitter. Like, I just gave her a Twitter. And, like, the best meme, I'm gonna retweet it. So I get a ton of replies, like, under all of her, like, tweets, whatever.
00:59:23.879 - 00:59:36.199, Speaker B: Like, yo, da da da, da, da da. And Whiff edited the hat on her profile picture and, like, posted it. And then I replied, you get that meme? It's so good. It's so good. It's so good.
00:59:36.247 - 00:59:37.555, Speaker A: The beauty of that meme.
00:59:37.855 - 00:59:46.391, Speaker B: So I reply to that, like, go back and forth, whatever. This is when it was at, like, 100k mark, cap, and I'm just, like, replying back and forth. I retweeted it, whatever. Nobody really paid attention to it.
00:59:46.463 - 00:59:46.943, Speaker A: I didn't either.
00:59:46.999 - 00:59:57.991, Speaker B: Nobody really paid attention. Somebody saw it. Okay, cool. Z's just doing random stuff on Twitter. Cool. That happened. And then I think in the chat, somebody was like, asking about Whiff.
00:59:57.991 - 01:00:07.887, Speaker B: And I was like, yeah, whiff is funny. And they screenshot it. Like, Z said, whiff is funny, and, like, put it on Twitter. Reposted everywhere. Everybody was following my account was like, z said it was funny. Z said it was funny. I think it went to, like, a million or whatever.
01:00:07.887 - 01:00:26.007, Speaker B: So now it's at a million. And then I'm out for, like, Santa Con. Same girl and my boy, a couple other people, and we're just drunk, like, walking down the street or just, like, talking, whatever. I go live on Twitter. I'm like, yo, I'm going live. Like, what should we talk about? So we started talking about meme coins. And everybody's like, yo, what meme coin? Like, what's your favorite meme coin? Somebody's like, mock.
01:00:26.007 - 01:00:38.159, Speaker B: Like, what's your favorite meme coin? Somebody's like, mock. And I asked the girl, like, what's your favorite meme coin? She goes, dog with hat. And she's like. I was like, what? No way. She just said, dog with, like, this is random. I didn't ask her to say anything. All live.
01:00:38.159 - 01:00:49.889, Speaker B: She remembered from the past week the whiff. And she said it again. She's like, dog with hat. And so when she said that on stream, that was that day when you were saying, like, when it went from 1 to, like, 10, 15 or whatever.
01:00:49.937 - 01:00:50.913, Speaker A: It went up to, like, 20.
01:00:51.009 - 01:00:56.809, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, it went from 1 to, like, yeah, 20. And that was like. Yeah. And I was out. We're just out, like, drinking, chilling, whatever.
01:00:56.857 - 01:00:57.485, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:00:57.985 - 01:01:12.261, Speaker B: So when I see it, I wake up and my mentions are just like, people blowing me up about whiff. Just blow me up, like, oh, there might be something. There might be something here. And then that's when I. That's when I tweeted that. Yo, guys, like, I think I just found the next, like, 100 million million dollar meme. Coin.
01:01:12.293 - 01:01:12.597, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:12.661 - 01:01:27.789, Speaker B: And the replies are like, what coin is it? What coin is it? What coin is it? And then somebody was like, does the. Does the coin have a hat? And I was like, yeah. I was like, yeah. And I was like, yeah. So that's when. That's when that shit happened. Went from, like, the three mil bottom or whatever.
01:01:27.957 - 01:01:28.413, Speaker A: Bottom?
01:01:28.469 - 01:01:29.821, Speaker B: Yeah. Around there?
01:01:29.933 - 01:01:30.509, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:30.637 - 01:01:35.509, Speaker B: And then it was gone from there. It went to 100 mil and then it chopped around for, like, three months.
01:01:35.597 - 01:01:35.917, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:35.981 - 01:01:47.735, Speaker B: Like, I think it would, like. Yeah, it was like. It was like 200. It was like 200 miles, 30 cents. It was 100 mil, 20 cents. Like 200, like, 8 cents. And it was just like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
01:01:47.735 - 01:02:00.943, Speaker B: And whole time, I'm just like, just memeing the whiff, like, going around people. I'm wearing the hat, putting a hat on people. Like, just whatever. Just memeing whiff. And then eventually, like, it went from 30 cents to, like, $3. And I was just. Just ripped it.
01:02:00.943 - 01:02:02.035, Speaker B: Nice. Yes.
01:02:02.855 - 01:02:03.263, Speaker A: Love it.
01:02:03.279 - 01:02:04.815, Speaker B: And I was like, three. I think it's like, three right now.
01:02:04.855 - 01:02:06.197, Speaker A: It's 3350 or something.
01:02:06.311 - 01:02:07.017, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:02:07.081 - 01:02:12.113, Speaker A: We're still following it very closely, obviously, every hour. Every hour.
01:02:12.169 - 01:02:12.765, Speaker B: Every.
01:02:15.985 - 01:02:16.993, Speaker A: Portfolio refresh.
01:02:17.049 - 01:02:24.281, Speaker B: Yeah, literally. Literally. But it's crazy because so many people have, like, been fading it the whole way.
01:02:24.353 - 01:02:24.953, Speaker A: I don't know why.
01:02:25.009 - 01:02:25.369, Speaker B: I don't know.
01:02:25.417 - 01:02:26.353, Speaker A: Dog has fucking hats.
01:02:26.409 - 01:02:39.807, Speaker B: They hate it so much. I'm like, why, bro? It's just a dog with a hat, bro. Like, you don't have to hate the coin. You don't have to buy the coin. But. But the thing was, so many people like, that hated it. They just kept adding fuel to the fire, and now it's like, the most.
01:02:39.807 - 01:02:48.775, Speaker B: Like, it has the most attention out of any other altcoin. It's been number one trading on Solana for, like, months. Like, number one out of all the other alts.
01:02:48.935 - 01:02:49.535, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:02:49.655 - 01:02:51.743, Speaker B: It's crazy. No, it's crazy.
01:02:51.839 - 01:02:55.167, Speaker C: Don is actually the best thing that happened to Whiff in the last couple weeks.
01:02:55.191 - 01:02:56.087, Speaker B: He's like, oh, I'm shorting it.
01:02:56.111 - 01:02:57.235, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm shorting it.

01:03:03.619 - 01:03:04.963, Speaker C: It got liquidated today.
01:03:05.099 - 01:03:11.067, Speaker B: Yeah, he closed. I think he closed it short, but it's above where he shorted that, like where everybody shrinks above that liquid on.
01:03:11.251 - 01:03:13.735, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, we need more.
01:03:15.875 - 01:03:19.315, Speaker B: More shorts. For sure, for sure, for sure.

01:03:23.427 - 01:03:24.059, Speaker B: All right, cool.
01:03:24.147 - 01:03:26.435, Speaker C: I do want to talk about stuff outside of crypto.

01:03:28.851 - 01:03:30.957, Speaker C: I don't know. What do you want to talk about? Crypto?
01:03:31.051 - 01:03:31.321, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:31.353 - 01:03:33.965, Speaker C: What's politics? Election.
01:03:34.545 - 01:04:01.741, Speaker B: Yo, politics is going to be crazy, bro. I mean, politics is going to be crazy now because, like, crypto is kind of a part of it. Yeah, it's like, I think at the last, whatever, Trump had his rally, like, for his NFT holders, his first NFT holders in Florida. He had like a rally for crypto people there and let basically anybody ask him whatever crypto questions you want. He was like, pretty pro crypto. He's like, yeah, like, whatever. Like, I'll support anything crypto needs to happen in the US Like, I'm supportive of it.
01:04:01.741 - 01:04:24.189, Speaker B: He's like talking shit about Biden. He's like, biden's not supporting crypto. The Democrats hate crypto. They really messed up because, like, they've been very anti crypto for a lot of these the past few years or whatever. Like, Warren's been super against crypto and very outspoken against crypto in Congress and everything. And so Trump's like, okay, I can use this as a trump card against them. And, like, I'm gonna support crypto.
01:04:24.189 - 01:04:41.145, Speaker B: That's a really, like, right now he realizes that it's like the follow through on. It doesn't even have to be super strong as long as he's like, I'm in support of this. I'm not like, anti this. Like, they are. And I think that that's good for us just generally because the Democrats don't want to, like, lose votes because they're anti crypto.
01:04:41.885 - 01:04:43.745, Speaker C: Are you a single issue voter?
01:04:44.285 - 01:04:46.265, Speaker B: I don't know, man. I'm trying to figure it out.
01:04:46.645 - 01:05:02.085, Speaker C: Crypto aside, like, assuming both parties are aligned on crypto, who would you vote for? What are like, basically what I'm asking is what are some of the other issues you care about? It's okay if you don't want to talk about it.
01:05:02.125 - 01:05:09.665, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't want to get roasted on Twitter for this, but yeah, I'm honestly not really strong on either party, honestly.
01:05:10.325 - 01:05:21.745, Speaker A: All right, There's a lot of good ones. This is from Alanation428. What are the kinds of apps that you see building on top of Solana once we get that crazy fire dancer throughput eyeballs.
01:05:22.325 - 01:05:56.151, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm really excited for like consumer focused applications that require a ton of like microtransactions in app. On Solana, I think that that's like the biggest, biggest unlock. Whether it's like a mini game where people have to do like a ton of things in the app or if it's like a social thing or they're going out and like meeting with people in person and doing things in app. I think trading's like a gimme, like an obvious one. It's just obviously trading should be big. But yeah, I'm really excited about the consumer stuff. I think stuff like helium is cool.
01:05:56.151 - 01:06:01.791, Speaker B: Hivemapper I think is cool. But yeah, mostly consumer focused stuff. And then real world deep end stuff.
01:06:01.823 - 01:06:02.479, Speaker A: Deepen stuff.
01:06:02.567 - 01:06:08.719, Speaker C: Deepen technically has a micropayment component, right? Yeah, like when people get paid in the native token, that's a micropayment.
01:06:08.767 - 01:06:16.823, Speaker B: Exactly. I mean, and that's why a lot of those teams moved either from like their own L1 or whatever other chain they were on. I think Render also moved to Solana. Right?
01:06:16.839 - 01:06:17.135, Speaker C: That's right.
01:06:17.175 - 01:06:17.375, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:06:17.415 - 01:06:17.591, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:06:17.623 - 01:06:29.115, Speaker B: So a lot of those teams realize that and like. Yeah, well, this is the only chain we really can be on long term, so I think that's a big advantage. I actually don't see that talked about enough. Like, the depend on Solana, I think is an underrated kind of thesis.
01:06:29.155 - 01:06:44.931, Speaker A: Even the transaction does. It does spoofing checks. So it checks to see if someone is spoofing to mine the tokens. So they run like 100 of these nodes. Right. And they try to spoof it so they can extract value. So every few minutes or something, they do a spoof check to see if it's real and if it's a real transaction.
01:06:44.931 - 01:06:53.711, Speaker A: And that happens every day, every minute. So that's like. I think that's one element of microtransactions. Data credits. Purchasing data credits for helium.
01:06:53.783 - 01:06:54.311, Speaker B: Yep.
01:06:54.423 - 01:06:55.279, Speaker A: That's also another one.
01:06:55.327 - 01:06:55.975, Speaker B: Yep.
01:06:56.135 - 01:07:01.583, Speaker A: Okay. These guys, man, like, I'm just Gonna bring it up because it's just like the puppets. They just.
01:07:01.599 - 01:07:02.383, Speaker B: The puppets are on you.
01:07:02.439 - 01:07:14.031, Speaker A: No, no, no. It's another community. These guys spam every one of my tweets. Yeah, I'm just gonna bring it up because they have balls. Right? So have you heard talk about hybrid NFT and tokens?
01:07:14.063 - 01:07:17.727, Speaker B: Yo, they're crazy too. Yeah, yeah, they're crazy too.
01:07:17.751 - 01:07:29.931, Speaker A: They' they just. I mean, they got really good memes. So I'm just going to give it to them because I don't have any. I don't have a bag here, so I just. They're good community. So I'm going to bring it up. What do you think about hybrid NFT tokens?
01:07:30.003 - 01:07:47.297, Speaker B: Yes. I mean, I do think that makes a ton of sense. I think that one of the reasons that meme coins have kind of evolved from NFTs last cycle. The issue with NFTs last cycle is, was kind of capped by the 10,000 pictures. Whatever. With meme coins, it's not capped by that at all. Like, it's whatever.
01:07:47.297 - 01:08:12.045, Speaker B: So there's many holders as you want. And it's like meme coins are also kind of NFTs. If you look on Twitter right now, you see people, the Whiff guys, the Meechee guys. Like, their profile picture is literally the meme dressed in a different fit or like a different hat or like a different version of it. So it's kind of like the NFT on the profile picture side. But it's funny cause literally they're fungible tokens. Yeah, they're like fungible tokens.
01:08:12.045 - 01:08:51.287, Speaker B: So I think what's gonna happen is you're going to have a combination of these things where it's like you can either hold the NFT or you hold some piece of the NFT as a token, but it's still a community of where you don't need the actual NFT to make it your PFP or whatever. It's kind of like if you could add hundreds of thousands of people to your base NFT set collection, but they just don't have enough money to afford the actual nft. And that was one of the problems last cycle. At some point, bored apes are at $300,000 and no one's gonna buy that. Yeah, it's like, who has 300? Like, regular people don't have $300 if you want some view.
01:08:51.391 - 01:08:52.983, Speaker C: Which is why they launched the Ape token and then.
01:08:52.999 - 01:08:57.143, Speaker B: Yeah, and then they launched the Ape Token. But it wasn't like the four. The actual four separate thing. Yeah.
01:08:57.239 - 01:08:58.351, Speaker A: There's no value, like, you know.
01:08:58.383 - 01:08:59.807, Speaker C: Yeah, there's no value accrual.
01:08:59.871 - 01:09:00.927, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
01:09:01.031 - 01:09:13.715, Speaker A: So that was asked by Babush Hodl, and then one of his friends, Bozo Sharman, said, ask him about the night in Miami where I sold him on hybrids. I don't know. He sent this.
01:09:17.855 - 01:09:18.215, Speaker B: Oh.
01:09:18.255 - 01:09:23.247, Speaker A: Oh, I just saw this. It's you at the boxing.
01:09:23.431 - 01:09:28.111, Speaker B: Yeah, bro, that meme has been used, yo.
01:09:28.183 - 01:09:29.875, Speaker A: It's the best meme ever.
01:09:30.535 - 01:09:31.895, Speaker C: How is there not a meme?
01:09:32.055 - 01:09:32.915, Speaker A: It's like.
01:09:35.135 - 01:09:36.955, Speaker B: That is so funny.
01:09:37.525 - 01:09:51.545, Speaker A: All right, I think we could end it with a really good note, right? This is asked by erebos991 thoughts around charity in crypto. So much wealth is created in our industry, but very little is given away to those that help in need.
01:09:52.125 - 01:10:20.667, Speaker B: I mean, I tweeted a few months ago, I was like, bro, we're gonna make. If this cycle does what I think it's gonna do, and it goes like 10 trillion. All of us who literally have been in from the bottom, we're gonna give away so much money to people this cycle, like, it's gonna be insane because everyone's gonna have so much money to spend. And you kind of saw it last cycle, like, when Kobe would do the raids on people's twitch streams. Like, yo, we're gonna raid this guy's twitch stream, right? These guys playing the guitar. He's chilling like, 100 viewers. And Kobe would be like, yo, those guys, boom.
01:10:20.667 - 01:10:35.539, Speaker B: We're gonna raid this guy's stream and everybody just like, throw 10, throw 100. Like, that could be a product. Yeah, that could be a product. That could be a product. Yeah. I mean, dude, I think charity is gonna be really big. I mean, it's just like, it's really on the leaders in crypto.
01:10:35.539 - 01:11:02.511, Speaker B: The guys with the biggest followers kind of like, direct people to doing that. Because if you directed people or, like, had your thesis online about whatever X coin, whatever X idea, people make money off that. There's our people who are, like, willing to support whatever. Like, you're working on whatever you think is good, especially if you don't ask them for anything, especially if you did it for free. So there's a ton of people like that in crypto. Like, the cycle of giving back to people who helped you on crypto is super, super strong. That's why I think charity is going to be big now for sure.
01:11:02.511 - 01:11:03.355, Speaker B: At the top.
01:11:04.775 - 01:11:07.127, Speaker C: Hold on, you said this cycle, we're going to 10 trillion.
01:11:07.191 - 01:11:11.487, Speaker B: 10 trillion. Yeah, for sure. We're what? We're at 2 now 2 point something.
01:11:11.591 - 01:11:15.247, Speaker C: So you're saying bitcoin is going to go to 200? 300.
01:11:15.311 - 01:11:15.607, Speaker A: Let me check.
01:11:15.631 - 01:11:16.243, Speaker B: 250K.
01:11:16.379 - 01:11:17.295, Speaker C: 250. Really?
01:11:17.335 - 01:11:22.671, Speaker B: 250K? I think 250. Run it, run it, run it, run it.
01:11:22.863 - 01:11:26.155, Speaker A: I'm down. Cool. Any final questions, Sean?
01:11:28.625 - 01:11:33.753, Speaker C: No. Trying to think of a time when you got roasted recently, but again, roasted non stop.
01:11:33.809 - 01:11:39.205, Speaker B: We already talked about the pool, bro. We already talked about the pool. We did that already. We did that.
01:11:40.385 - 01:11:42.601, Speaker A: Or the boxing box.
01:11:42.673 - 01:11:44.685, Speaker B: Yeah, boxing the full thing.
01:11:46.185 - 01:12:00.795, Speaker A: When someone took the whiff guy dancing and they put you. That was just comedy.
01:12:00.835 - 01:12:05.827, Speaker B: That is comedy, bro. That is the best industry, man. It's literally.
01:12:05.851 - 01:12:06.219, Speaker A: I'll never.
01:12:06.267 - 01:12:09.815, Speaker B: There is no non stop entertainment. I'll never leave non stop entertainment.
01:12:10.235 - 01:12:14.695, Speaker A: All right, guys, any. Any final comments, thoughts, anything that you want to leave the audience with?
01:12:15.555 - 01:12:19.323, Speaker B: Don't sell too early. Yeah, that's all I got to say.
01:12:19.379 - 01:12:22.117, Speaker A: All right, we'll catch you guys next week. Thanks. Thanks for tuning in.
01:12:22.221 - 01:12:22.901, Speaker B: Cool.
