00:00:00.120 - 00:00:40.584, Speaker A: The factors that contribute to this core idea that the next decade will be a secular inflationary decade. There are basically two strong forces. The first force by the way is something that you mentioned earlier which is that the government needs inflation to inflate away the debt. They have so much debt, like back to the napkin calculation shows that if the interest rate is kept at like four or 5% then the interest in expense is on the same order of magnitude as military, health care and Social Security, which is ridiculous. So they need inflation to inflate away the debt. There's almost no other way. The only other way is if you get a really big increase in productivity.
00:00:40.584 - 00:00:56.344, Speaker A: But that's not something you can really hope for. You can't really engineer that. You can only hope that that will happen. The most proactive thing that the government can do is to inflate away the debt. Sometimes I feel like we're talking about like Ponzis. The whole market is a ponzi.
