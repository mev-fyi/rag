00:00:00.120 - 00:00:04.878, Speaker UNK: Imran, what are you excited about? What is a new pre physical work network that you want to see?
00:00:04.966 - 00:00:49.164, Speaker A: I think health data was like my number one. Number two is energy, obviously energy. It's a very tough problem to solve. There are a few founders that we're talking to today, but primarily if you think about how we consume energy, it's done in a very traditional fashion, right? You have like these large energy providers like comed and et cetera that either mine coal mine, they use coal or other types of energy resources, nuclear, etcetera. And what they do is they distribute that energy through like a power grid and they have houses that are connected to this power grid and then they essentially sell energy directly to end consumers. And it's very pricey because really there aren't many energy providers are out there and it's primarily a monopoly. It's one of two.
00:00:49.244 - 00:00:51.116, Speaker UNK: In many countries it's nationalized.
00:00:51.260 - 00:00:52.484, Speaker A: It's nationalized exactly.
