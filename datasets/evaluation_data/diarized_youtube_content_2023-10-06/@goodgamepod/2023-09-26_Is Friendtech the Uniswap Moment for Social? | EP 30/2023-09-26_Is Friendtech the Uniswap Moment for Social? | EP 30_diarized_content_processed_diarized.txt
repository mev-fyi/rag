00:00:00.400 - 00:00:17.385, Speaker A: Welcome to Goodgame. Your no BS insights for crypto founders. Why is Friendtech so exciting? I mean we talked a bit about it. Why do we think this is the uniswap moment for Defi but for social?
00:00:17.505 - 00:00:29.635, Speaker B: By the way, true point. This room is actually the contrarian because everywhere I go, like in real life, when I talk to people in those crypto conferences and ask them, what do you think of friend type? They're all bearish.
00:00:30.015 - 00:00:32.119, Speaker A: We're still early as Obi's word.
00:00:32.247 - 00:00:37.503, Speaker B: Everyone talks about friend type but no one is bullish. So this room is actually the bullish room.
00:00:37.559 - 00:00:58.575, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto? Check out our request for startups list and get inspired at Alliance XYZ Ideas. Welcome to goodgame. Today we're going to be talking about frontech and we have two guests with us and they're from Manifold, if you're deep into frontech. So why don't you guys give a quick intro?
00:00:58.735 - 00:01:28.385, Speaker C: Yeah, sounds good. So my name is Eric Chang. I'm one of the GPS at Manifold Ventures. First got into crypto more along the lines of the regulatory route. Was advising a lot of crypto asset managers and VCs about SEC and state regulations. Worked with a lot of regulators and kind of describing to them what crypto is and why my clients deserve to get RIA registrations. Over time I actually switched on over to the investing side, working alongside certain accelerators and also VCs.
00:01:28.385 - 00:01:35.265, Speaker C: Prior to joining Manifold, I was also VP at Wave Digital Assets where I was helping to oversee their early stage venture practice.
00:01:35.725 - 00:02:16.989, Speaker D: Cool. I'm Jay. I got into crypto in around 2017, mostly on the white hat hacking side. Crypto was a great playground because you could go to each protocol and a lot of them copied each other's code. So you could basically find a vulnerability in one thing and then use it everywhere else. During the heat of like 2018 and EOS, when EOS was the third biggest market, CAP also managed to find a vulnerability there and I was paid, you know, to not exploit these types of protocols and then I ran validators for a bit. So kind of like, you know, mining altcoins essentially was thankfully earning passive income through that during the bear market.
00:02:16.989 - 00:03:12.797, Speaker D: So I could get pretty aggressive trading and investing into a lot of projects and majors and just accumulate and then yeah, just right place, right time. During the bull Caught DeFi caught NFTs, started a fund manifold early 2021. We ran liquid trading, so mostly market neutral, pure art market making strategies which has now become a prop Trading fund. So we run our own balance sheet on our own money and then recently started a venture fund under manifold as well, specifically to invest into pre seed seed early stage companies in crypto. And we see a lot more investable companies now where founders who are currently in the space during the deep bear really believe in the tech, believe in what they're building and have resilience and you know, there's a lot more noise during a bull market and I think right now is a great time to invest in these types of projects.
00:03:12.941 - 00:04:00.855, Speaker A: 100% agreed. So front tech has been on my mind probably 85% of the time now for the past three past month now. And I'm assuming there is a core group of people that are also experiencing what I'm experiencing. And typically when this happens, we know that there is something special similar to Defi and Chow. I'm going to quote you when I say this, but you said this where when you use aave, it was like a magical experience. Right. And I feel like what we're going through with frenetech is also a magical experience because there's so many different layers that we can unpack and so I guess let's talk about our feedback or just like what we thought of FriendTech when it first launched.
00:04:00.855 - 00:04:15.835, Speaker A: I think that's like a good place to start. When it first launched, how did you feel about it and like, why did you like when did you sign up? What was your thesis? By signing up and then we can all go around the room and just kind of talk about what happened there.
00:04:16.335 - 00:04:44.735, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean for me, I was in a group chat. Well, I'm in a group chat with, you know, one of the CT type group chats where there's a ton of people and Kobe was like, have you guys heard about friend tech? And I responded, no. And he's like, wow, we're so early. Interesting. So that's how I first heard about it. And then some guys dropped invite code on that telegram group chat. So I copied it and then I got on the platform.
00:04:44.735 - 00:04:56.387, Speaker D: Back then all these guys were trading very low. Right. And I loaded up like 2 ETH or something to just play around with it. Back then you would have to bridge to base for.
00:04:56.451 - 00:04:57.643, Speaker A: And was this on the first day?
00:04:57.739 - 00:05:07.645, Speaker D: This wasn't on the first day. It might have been like couple days. Yeah, first week for sure. Yeah. So I get on and I bought some stuff. I bought Suzuki.
00:05:08.175 - 00:05:09.287, Speaker A: Good contrarian bet.
00:05:09.351 - 00:05:11.175, Speaker D: Yeah. It's just, you know.
00:05:11.255 - 00:05:14.071, Speaker A: Oh, is it consensus now? Yeah, that's why he's going down. Okay.
00:05:14.143 - 00:05:23.135, Speaker D: It was like a meme bet. Plus like I think I bought Kobe and then I just like afk because back then there wasn't that much activity.
00:05:23.215 - 00:05:23.567, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:23.631 - 00:05:34.037, Speaker D: And then it picked up a bit and so like I chatted a little bit and then we actually looked into the arbitrage side of things. Right. Wow, look at that sniping.
00:05:34.191 - 00:05:34.577, Speaker A: Nice.
00:05:34.641 - 00:05:42.605, Speaker D: Looked at arbitrage with what? Well, I mean sniping is somewhat of an arb. If you're sniping.
00:05:43.185 - 00:05:43.777, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:43.881 - 00:06:08.251, Speaker D: And you just sell. Yeah, sell into the bonding curve. And then there was other things. Like people were building the fractions. So fractionalized keys through velocimeter and we do a lot of pure R cross venue on C5 to DeFi. So we're tapped into all types of AMMs, like Uniswap, solidly curve balancer forks, everything. Right.
00:06:08.251 - 00:06:23.055, Speaker D: So we could quickly integrate that and be able to run fractions first key arb only issue is that the keys, the trading fees are too high. So it's like you need to wait for a massive dislocation to ever hit an arb.
00:06:23.595 - 00:06:25.331, Speaker A: This was when Sisyphus launched his token.
00:06:25.363 - 00:07:04.005, Speaker D: Right, Right, exactly. So we were looking at all those opportunities and just playing around with it really like testing. Using my account as a test actually to do a lot of stuff. So a lot of people sometimes like my doc's main personal account, people ask like, why does it say you have like 900 holding right. Keys? Like it was literally because like sniping. There was one day where like I just like tried a bunch of stuff like random scripts that we were running just to play around and yeah, so that's sort of how we got into Friend Tech. But for like two weeks we were very inactive afterwards because, you know, the activity kind of died for a bit.
00:07:04.305 - 00:07:05.337, Speaker A: There's a lot of scares.
00:07:05.401 - 00:07:05.625, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:07:05.665 - 00:07:07.817, Speaker A: This was before Paradigm announced their raise.
00:07:07.961 - 00:07:32.621, Speaker D: Yeah, I remember this dip and yeah, didn't have that much conviction in front tech specifically. I thought that it was really interesting. Social fi was something that like I was fascinated by but wasn't fully convinced that FriendTech was going to be that thing. So I put in a lot of work into launching CL's account. Right. But after launching it.
00:07:32.653 - 00:07:33.285, Speaker A: Oh, I remember that.
00:07:33.325 - 00:07:39.145, Speaker D: Yeah, CL deleted it and then we both afk from Friend Tech after that for like over a week or two.
00:07:39.725 - 00:07:53.605, Speaker A: I didn't snipe CL because he deleted the app. Rest in peace. Now it's like four Ethan, Ciao. Yeah, what about you?
00:07:54.425 - 00:08:00.405, Speaker B: First week I just mid curved. I was like, this is just Big Cloud 2.0.
00:08:01.185 - 00:08:05.289, Speaker A: But funny enough, you were one of the first ones to use Big Cloud.
00:08:05.417 - 00:08:07.857, Speaker B: Yes, but that's why I have ptsd.
00:08:07.961 - 00:08:09.153, Speaker A: Exactly, exactly.
00:08:09.209 - 00:08:37.735, Speaker B: I can explain the difference between. So later on I realized some of the key differences between big Cloud and FriendTech. But we can dive into that later. But first week I mid curved and then. But I still played around with it. Then Paradigm, they announced the Paradigm investment and then that was another run up. So I just aped in FOMO'd and then did well, that was the second wave and then that again died for maybe a week.
00:08:37.735 - 00:09:14.387, Speaker B: But that week I started thinking about some of the ways to view FriendTech. So you can view Friend tech as. For example, I don't know if you guys have heard of glg, this company called glg. What they do is it's like an information network where people share alphas with each other. So the typical users are corporate espionage, so they just phish information from each other. So I viewed FriendTech as sort of information network back then. But later on I just realized the top groups on Frantek, they were all bullshit.
00:09:14.387 - 00:09:33.603, Speaker B: The content in those groups was total garbage. There's no way people are paying 6 ETH for that kind of alpha. The alpha is worthless. So it's not really a information network. Front tag can't evolve into that. But it is not that yet. And I started thinking about some other ways to view Frontag.
00:09:33.603 - 00:09:59.019, Speaker B: Started viewing Friendag as more of a game because all the 33 stuff happening, right? For those who don't know, Roof Free is like three three is like, you know, if you own my key, I'm going to buy your key and so that everyone has a bunch of keys so we can farm the airdrops together, et cetera, et cetera. And there's a bunch of other games that happen later on. We can talk about them as well. So I started viewing Frantic as a game. What else is there? There's some.
00:09:59.187 - 00:10:04.155, Speaker A: There's Pepe. We can talk about Pepe as well. There's that I giga aped Pepe.
00:10:04.275 - 00:10:46.099, Speaker B: You did. So FriendTech is a game. But importantly FriendTech is also one of the most successful attempts at bootstrapping on chain identity. It's not the first time we've managed to do this, but it's one of the most successful ways in which we as an industry attached real world identity, meaning the Twitter identity, to the on chain address. So from there I don't know what it's going to be, but there's going to be a lot of different games built on top of this identity network. So that's another way to view FriendTech, but very interesting. That week where Frantech died, I started thinking about these things and then the third wave.
00:10:46.099 - 00:10:54.523, Speaker B: The third wave was when they started announcing the airdrop. That was another huge wave, but sort of the history.
00:10:54.659 - 00:11:30.761, Speaker A: Yeah, for me, I giga ape the first day and my thesis was pretty simple. It's the social layer for crypto. And primarily I bought. It was obviously very risky, but I just bought 0x racer. And my thesis was if you look at Tom from MySpace, if you remember those days, he was the most followed person and he was one of the founders of MySpace. If you look at Mark Zuckerberg, he's one of the most top five followed individuals on Facebook. And my thesis was like, if this Elon on Twitter and Elon and Twitter.
00:11:30.793 - 00:11:35.073, Speaker B: Dan Romero on Forecaster, it's always the founder that's the number, 100% followers.
00:11:35.169 - 00:12:15.759, Speaker A: So ended up betting big on Xeroxracer and a little bit on Shrimp and a couple others and then just started to use a product. And what was interesting about it was the fact that the product itself, it just like hooked me, meaning that I started talking to other people. I started to get some alpha from some of these chat groups, not all. There was one or two chats where I started to get real insights and then I started to look for opportunities. I'm like, well, wow, this is pretty cool. And I started to go deeper into the front tech ecosystem and I came across the 33 network. And I'll talk a bit more about this later on, but it's led by many people.
00:12:15.759 - 00:12:43.177, Speaker A: But some people that come to mind are like Luke0x, Breadman, Makesy Future and Cyi are like the four or five people that are kind of like top of the funnel. And the idea is pretty simple. It's like, you buy me, I buy you. Right? But I think goes deeper than that. And I would call this the phase 2 of 3.3 from the original Ohm 3.3, where it kind of first launched.
00:12:43.177 - 00:13:10.130, Speaker A: And the primary idea is, hey, you know, if I buy you, you buy me. We're going to, you know, farm the points that come within the ecosystem. You help my key price, I help your key price. It keeps it elevated. But you also join, you're joining this community and we'll talk a bit more about this. But you know, I feel like this is an emerging, emerging cult that's being built on frontech. So I agree with your thesis chow, which is, you know, I think there's gonna be many different metas and one of the emerging metas is like this 3.
00:13:10.130 - 00:13:18.771, Speaker A: 3. Then there's gonna be different games being built and then social layer and et cetera. How about you? What are some things that, like, maybe your first reaction?
00:13:18.963 - 00:13:51.845, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. Like, when I first downloaded my Friend Tech account and kind of eased into it, I was really interested in just kind of looking at what the onboarding process was like. What are the kind of mechanics that are built into the app as well? Got a manifold key started my own. Got some of my own keys as well. And what I was really interested in is just how sticky and effective the app was in terms of like, value creation. There's still a lot of, you know, debate right now versus, you know, the speculative versus the true utility value of a platform such as Friend Tech. Right.
00:13:51.845 - 00:14:42.575, Speaker C: But whether you like it or not, you can't dispute the fact that it's a very effective, you know, form of value creation right now. Within a month in, there's like millions of tvl, you know, millions of like, protocol inflows in terms of capital, and a lot of that is being redistributed over to the creators. And despite the value add that some creators might be able to actually have, you know, interacting with people, you know, talking about my own chat room or looking at the people talking in manifold chat rooms, there are people that are actually genuinely interested in, you know, the stuff that we're working on. People actually genuinely interested in sharing Alpha as well. So it's just I see Friend Tech in the future, you know, perhaps as like a very effective, like, template, perhaps like a really good, like, building block for other applications to kind of build upon, for them to iterate upon, for them to see what are other great ways for facilitating value creation for creators.
00:14:43.635 - 00:14:59.901, Speaker A: Maybe this is a good segue into why is Friend Tech so exciting? I mean, we talked a bit about it. Why do we think this is the uniswap moment for Defi, but for social, why is that, by the way, true?
00:14:59.933 - 00:15:10.625, Speaker B: Point. This room is actually the contrarian. Because everywhere I go, like in real life, when I talk to people in those crypto conferences and ask them, what do you think of Frantic? They're all bearish.
00:15:11.005 - 00:15:12.025, Speaker A: We're still early.
00:15:13.125 - 00:15:18.637, Speaker B: Everyone talks about Frantic, but no one is bullish. So this room is actually the bullish room.
00:15:18.741 - 00:16:17.893, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things, I think, that come into play. There's the game component and then there's the real value creation component, I'm not fully convinced if there's going to be long term value created unless, you know, I see hard evidence of that, you know, in the coming months. Right now there's this whole incentive of the future speculation on those incentives that's causing certain behavioral aspects of the platform, which is in part driving growth, which could go away if the incentives were not there. And so like true PMF is, if the incentives weaken, will people still continue to, you know, behave and use the platform like they do now? But I think one really big aspect that I saw when onboarding people, right, because as manifold we've been doing snipe prevention and the first couple of times we did it, we went on video call with each person and helped them launch it live, right? And it's really funny because can you.
00:16:17.909 - 00:16:19.349, Speaker A: Name a few folks that you helped launch?
00:16:19.437 - 00:16:59.645, Speaker D: Yeah, so we helped cl. We helped shill Ivy Danny Beanstalk, we helped base Jackers Yatsu, the CEO of Animoca. So a lot of like large accounts, right? And these are all like fully grown adults. And you know, you see them on the video call, we run the bot and then boom, like it hits, you know, they launch night prevented and then immediately like normal users start buying into them, right? And they see their account, you know, move up in the trading fees, like they refresh it and it's like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. People are going on their chat going like, hey, welcome to friend tech, asking them questions and you see this like, big smile on their face like a baby. Literally like a baby. And like, you know, the.
00:16:59.745 - 00:17:00.685, Speaker A: The magic experience.
00:17:00.805 - 00:17:10.501, Speaker D: Yeah, it's the magic experience. Like the dopamine hit is immediate and keeps coming, right? If your key price is going down, it's maybe the other way cortisol, right?
00:17:10.533 - 00:17:12.985, Speaker A: But I take it very personally.
00:17:13.685 - 00:17:36.177, Speaker D: But yeah, people care. And it's like some of these guys maybe have nine fig net worth, maybe more, right? But someone dumping their keys for a couple grand on the high end is very tilting for them. And it's like, it's crazy, right? Technically they could just buy it up themselves, but that's also kind of against your ego because, like, you know, you don't want to be that guy.
00:17:36.241 - 00:17:37.545, Speaker A: Like, you're repeating yourself.
00:17:37.625 - 00:17:53.057, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly, right? So, yeah, that's like a bit of the magic moment that I saw, like when I saw these guys, like immediately as the app loads, they're like, whoa. And it's like, okay, there's something here, there's something here that makes me excited.
00:17:53.121 - 00:18:50.823, Speaker A: So touching on that when there is an active price that's attached to your reputation, they're fully invested in it, right? I feel like that's what happens and that's all they care about and think about. And so there was a funny video, this guy named K Money, he comes up with like funny videos and he made a 30 second skit and in 30 second skit he went like, he, he was talking about how he had friend, friend tag, he had a key and he went to sleep for two hours. And while he was sleeping, everyone dumped his token because he was in like engaging. Then he woke up and started trying to engage with his audience, right? And something special there is happening, right, which is like now people are worried of going to sleep or not engaging as much with their audience. And I consider this similar to like a comedian, right, or an actor that's acting or giving jokes in front of a live audience. If you're not giving a joke, a good joke, or if you're not engaging your audience, you're going to get a red tomato interface, right? And that's essentially what's happening on the Internet, right?
00:18:50.879 - 00:20:15.803, Speaker C: I think what's interesting is that financial incentive, right, or just wanting to hold value within your own key is also just like a good mechanism for, you know, spurring just value adds from creators themselves, right? Like it's always a two sided market. We're always talking about engagement from like the fans and like the users, but the creators themselves also have to, you know, put out like a certain number of amount of effort, right. In order to engage their audience, right? And that financial incentive is quite interesting, right? I can kind of see this in the future. Something perhaps friend tech, perhaps something like friend tech supplementing a lot of the traditional social media platforms that we use today, right? Like I think a lot of the chat room phenomenon, like the magic that Jay mentioned, it's very similar for example to like, you know, Reddit amas, right? Like for some, like young thug, like you know, hosted like an AMA room or something, people are asking questions or like, I don't know, Bernie Sanders or whoever, right? Like this is like one of those rare moments where you're actually able to kind of interact with people that you are perhaps fascinated by or admire in the crypto space and actually speak to them in a room. And then that financial incentive also kind of pushes the creator to kind of talk to, right, People that are engaging with them and perhaps in the future, right? It's a lot different from like a more casual, you know, format like, compared to like Twitter or Like X, for example. Like, I can kind of see how, you know, FriendTech will always kind of be that kind of more monetizable kind of supplement to like a more casual, like, underlying social media layer.
00:20:15.949 - 00:20:29.235, Speaker A: Agreed. I see as like the top 1%. Right. Like, I think all of the, you know, social networks will still continue to thrive, but there will be like that 1% where you can actually connect with the creator themselves.
00:20:29.735 - 00:20:36.835, Speaker B: Is friend tech really a social network? Is it fundamentally a social network or is this something else?
00:20:37.775 - 00:20:39.155, Speaker A: Define social network.
00:20:40.295 - 00:20:43.465, Speaker B: A network where people socialize with each other.
00:20:44.005 - 00:20:47.965, Speaker A: And in this case it has elements of. It has elements of that for sure.
00:20:48.005 - 00:20:56.985, Speaker B: But is it fundamentally that what it is today? I think it's fundamentally a meme coin exchange. It's a shitcoin exchange.
00:20:57.605 - 00:21:02.037, Speaker A: Well, I mean, anything that first starts will start off looking clunky.
00:21:02.101 - 00:21:09.345, Speaker D: I disagree with that though. A shitcoin exchange, when you hold a shitcoin, it's really easy to dump it. Right?
00:21:09.425 - 00:21:09.745, Speaker B: Okay.
00:21:09.785 - 00:21:36.341, Speaker D: It's not linked to your identity. Like, there are very different connotations, I think, between buying and selling something on front tech versus buying and selling a shitcoin. Like there's one trading is purely about, you know, profiting off of a trade. Right. Versus I think on friend tech, it's a little different. Like during this week, you meet someone and they're on friend tech and you go, yo, like, let's buy each other's keys. Right? And like, you don't do that with shitcoins.
00:21:36.373 - 00:21:39.853, Speaker B: Like, you buy people's keys because you want to meet them.
00:21:39.949 - 00:21:44.597, Speaker D: No, like, we were like, we just hang out, you meet someone and they're.
00:21:44.621 - 00:21:46.117, Speaker B: Like, oh, let's buy each other's keys.
00:21:46.181 - 00:22:10.725, Speaker D: Yeah, stuff like that. Right. There's real life social elements even that come out of this. Is friend tech going to succeed solely on the social network side? Probably not. It's a pretty shitty platform if that's the main value proposition, in my opinion. But I think it's inherently different from shitcoin casinos. And I actually did want to talk more about the 33 component of it.
00:22:10.725 - 00:22:16.445, Speaker D: So Ohm. Right. Which all of us know very well and dearly.
00:22:17.225 - 00:22:17.913, Speaker A: Rest in peace.
00:22:17.969 - 00:23:00.993, Speaker D: Yeah, rest in peace. Ohm was a token. And sure, there was this whole community aspect where everyone was putting Three3 on their Twitter and all of that, which honestly did help a lot in terms of know, getting more people involved and the Ponzi going longer and longer. But I think like one massive element to OM is that it is at the end of the day, a Shitcoin where it's not really linked to your identity, so you don't feel bad dumping and you know, the Prisoner's Dilemma, like the defector will win. Right. So in front tech scenario, like if you just viewed it as a simple Prisoner's Dilemma game, um, you know, this ends up crashing and burning to death. Right.
00:23:00.993 - 00:23:27.865, Speaker D: Um, three. Three will not work long term. But I thought about it more and I was like, is it really just a pure Prisoner's dilemma? Like, I don't know if it is, because one, your identity is linked to what you're holding. Right. And if you care about your reputation, if you care about your identity and the fact that everybody can see the decisions you're making live. Yeah, Right. If you're to sell, even though your monetary gain.
00:23:27.865 - 00:23:57.469, Speaker D: So like, let's say you're. If your utility is purely monetary, it's still Prisoner's Dilemma, but the whole social aspect actually kind of changes. The utility graphs a little bit where the punishment you get is not only monetary, it's actually social where all your friends get angry at you or, you know, people on Twitter start talking shit about you and that's a backlash that actually, you know, plays into this graph a lot and like makes you think, is it actually Prisoner's Dilemma now?
00:23:57.517 - 00:23:57.853, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:57.909 - 00:23:58.333, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:23:58.429 - 00:24:04.685, Speaker B: I think I know why we have different experiences. Because you use your real name account. I use my ainon.
00:24:04.725 - 00:24:05.037, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
00:24:05.061 - 00:24:07.333, Speaker B: So for me, my only incentive is to make money.
00:24:07.389 - 00:24:07.621, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:24:07.653 - 00:24:10.317, Speaker B: I don't care about social stuff. But you do because you use your real name.
00:24:10.381 - 00:24:11.025, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:24:11.365 - 00:24:36.393, Speaker A: So early on I started doing. With my docs account, I did 33 and then I ended up like dumping a few folks that are well known and turns out in other counts I run. They're all talking about me like Imran Iran, just. But, but, but something important, and I mean something special is happening here, right? Which is. I'm like, shit. Now people think I'm a defector.
00:24:36.449 - 00:24:37.805, Speaker D: Did you. Did you feel bad?
00:24:38.265 - 00:24:43.121, Speaker A: Not really, but I. Not. No, not well, I mean, a little bit. Right?
00:24:43.153 - 00:24:43.585, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:24:43.705 - 00:25:08.959, Speaker A: But that's just because of the power of the network. It is today, now, let's say a year from now, two years from now. The power of the network is such that there's other services that's a part of it, right. Let's just say it becomes a very strong community, like the NFT communities, right? Where they do events, they provide each other help or support reputation, all of that. Right. If the network becomes stronger, then yes, absolutely. I would feel like crap.
00:25:08.959 - 00:25:24.155, Speaker A: I would never. Would Want. I would never want to leave that community. Right. But right now that community doesn't offer me any value. So I just dumped it. Right? But now they're talking about me and now I feel bad, and that's the type of conversation I'm having versus, like, just dumping Dogecoin or Harry Potter.
00:25:25.055 - 00:25:29.791, Speaker B: So you would feel bad if you dump NFT that you don't.
00:25:29.863 - 00:25:30.823, Speaker A: I don't feel bad.
00:25:30.959 - 00:25:32.315, Speaker B: Do you guys feel bad if.
00:25:32.775 - 00:25:33.831, Speaker D: No, not at all.
00:25:33.943 - 00:25:34.831, Speaker C: Not really. No.
00:25:34.903 - 00:25:40.311, Speaker A: Because it's because you're not tied to the creator. Right. And no one really knows who you are. Right.
00:25:40.383 - 00:25:41.111, Speaker B: Okay.
00:25:41.303 - 00:25:45.447, Speaker A: And so you just dump it. Blurbids probably Maki brother.
00:25:45.511 - 00:25:55.951, Speaker D: But like, right now, like, after, you know, hanging out with you guys and let's say I own his key, right. I would feel bad if I ever wanted to dump it. It would be one of the last things I would dump.
00:25:56.023 - 00:25:56.635, Speaker A: Right?
00:25:57.415 - 00:26:02.615, Speaker D: So there is, like, the social element to it. Like, you don't want to dump your friends. You're just going to hold it, you know?
00:26:02.695 - 00:26:19.667, Speaker A: So I ended up, like, part of me. I'm OCD with my chats. So with my docs account, I ended up all of all of our alliance crew. We bought each other's chats. Right. Or keys. I ended up dumping everyone because I wanted a clean chat.
00:26:19.667 - 00:26:34.075, Speaker A: And then they all dumped me and I felt bad. I'm like, so then I bought them back because you work with them and I don't want to disrespect them. So I bought them back. So I get what you mean by that. So there is a personal attachment with people that you built the relationship.
00:26:34.195 - 00:26:44.325, Speaker B: This is really important. This is a fundamentally new behavior. I didn't realize until just now because I've always used my docs on docs. So this is a fundamentally new behavior. That's very interesting.
00:26:44.745 - 00:27:19.981, Speaker A: Should we dive deeper into 3:3? Because I feel like there's a lot of things to unpack there, I guess, maybe starting with why do we think this 33 that's coming can actually be a guarded Ponzi? Is that the right term? Because it's kind of like a Ponzi. Right? Like you're buying each other, but. But there's now reputation attached and identity attached. So I feel like there's a kind of, like, guardrails in place that prevents it from, like, exploding. Right. It can still happen. Meaning, like, mass defections have happened.
00:27:19.981 - 00:27:29.827, Speaker A: Right. But I feel like the impact will be lower than the impact that let's say Ohm had. So let's Talk a bit more about, like, the 33 movement here.
00:27:29.941 - 00:27:51.055, Speaker D: Yeah, so, like, going off of what I talked about earlier where, like, you know, this might not be a pure prisoner's dilemma type of game setup anymore due to different utilities and different incentives coming into play. But another thing is, CL actually wrote about this in his blog post on E Girl Capital, like, a couple months ago.
00:27:51.095 - 00:27:52.115, Speaker A: Retardfy.
00:27:52.455 - 00:27:53.799, Speaker D: Yes, I read that.
00:27:53.847 - 00:27:55.335, Speaker A: It's a good article. We talked about it.
00:27:55.375 - 00:27:55.647, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:55.711 - 00:28:05.159, Speaker D: And, yeah, long scams and whatnot. But, you know, there's a graph at the bottom of that blog which talks about, like, a bit more about society and behavior.
00:28:05.207 - 00:28:06.127, Speaker A: Yes, right. Yes.
00:28:06.191 - 00:28:33.715, Speaker D: So, you know, when you have a small group of like, size 7 or less, you can have an anarchy and it's fine, you know, people will not defect and do bad things to each other. Right. Now if your group size starts going from seven to even nine, 13 and forward, you see, like, a massive spike in the rate of people that defect or do bad things or unlawful things that we would think are unlawful. Right.
00:28:34.375 - 00:28:37.583, Speaker A: Just because of network effects, like just so many people, there's more people.
00:28:37.639 - 00:29:16.975, Speaker D: And basically it's kind of like tragedy of the commons, where if you do a bad thing, there's no backlash to you, there's no punishment to you, but your utility increases. Right. And so society controls this by putting in punishments for people that you know are bad actors. Right. In order to incentivize good behavior. But, you know, this graph, the study basically showed that if you only punish the actual defectors, you know, the rate of cooperation of society still is not that high. It's like, you know, it still diminishes massively as n increases the number of people in the society.
00:29:16.975 - 00:29:35.233, Speaker D: But if you start punishing defectors as well as the bystanders that don't do anything about the defectors, then your rate of cooperation massively increases. Right. Within this society. And I think maybe friend tech could have something like that of a society where you've got groups, right.
00:29:35.289 - 00:29:35.793, Speaker A: Police.
00:29:35.929 - 00:29:54.577, Speaker D: And the whole group goes, wow, this guy jeeted his keys. Right. When we were all trying to three, three. They all want to punish him by everyone selling on him. Right. And that's the punishment. And then you might actually get this type of effect where you have a society where the bystanders also get punished.
00:29:54.577 - 00:30:03.695, Speaker D: If they don't, you know, do something about the defectors, the defectors get punished, and then the rate of cooperation starts increasing further. Right. Even if they don't want to be pushed as exponentially.
00:30:03.775 - 00:30:05.555, Speaker A: Yeah, interesting.
00:30:05.855 - 00:30:47.037, Speaker C: I'VE been kind of thinking about like these social dynamics a lot recently too. It's just not to get like too philosophical, but like Nietzsche talked a lot about like you know, human relationships and how like the core of that is actually the relationship between like the creditor and debtor. Right. It's a very like financial driven relationship that kind of like drives a lot of the hierarchical structures that like we live in today. And FriendTech is just kind of a really interesting kind of like social experiment. That concept of three, three which is like I'm going into this type of like financial commitment with you as my friend or someone that I have like faith in to kind of generate value. So if one of us kind of teaches others keys, then it's like kind of like almost kind of like a loss of faith in like your counterpart.
00:30:47.037 - 00:31:11.809, Speaker C: Right. And then you're kind of breaking that kind of trust, right. And then from there it'll be interesting to kind of see what kinds of like socially constructed kind of like rules or like games are going to be kind of created on top. Right. Like I even saw on like on, on ct, like people coming out with like, you know, infographics, like front tech commandments, you know, it's just like, oh, like we won't judge someone if you cheat your friend or whatever. You know that kind of like copium.
00:31:11.937 - 00:31:12.225, Speaker D: Right.
00:31:12.265 - 00:31:20.121, Speaker C: But like there's, there's just going to start to be like a lot of that kind of like people are already building commandments right off of such a like a month long, month old app.
00:31:20.193 - 00:32:03.495, Speaker A: Right. So yeah, I see this as like a reputation layer, right. I mean there's obviously the end state of how communities are going to self organize and police each other in a certain way. But I also think that this is a starting of a reputation system that's on chain and it's directly attached to your identity. And it's going to be primarily, it may start with just defecting, but it can start to add other layers based on what your on chain activity is. And so I was talking to CL about this and I was talking to him about this reputation system. He goes, yeah, right now if somebody asked me to borrow money, I'm not going to.
00:32:03.495 - 00:32:22.949, Speaker A: I don't know this person, so I'm not going to let him borrow any money. But maybe if somebody had a defection score had a history of no defections, four years, let's say on chain, I might let them borrow some money then. That got me thinking like, I wonder if this could be a start to something new.
00:32:22.997 - 00:32:23.205, Speaker D: Right.
00:32:23.245 - 00:32:33.731, Speaker A: Maybe some sort of like we're always talking about a credit like system on chain but we can never build it because everything requires collateral and there's no other way to.
00:32:33.813 - 00:32:35.663, Speaker D: There has to be a financial component to it.
00:32:35.759 - 00:32:41.715, Speaker A: Absolutely. So could this be a start to an on chain reputation system that could interact with defi?
00:32:42.175 - 00:33:36.029, Speaker D: No, I actually think that's really interesting. I think already like it is kind of doing that right. Where like scammer accounts or well like like new people that enter CT don't actually know who is good and who is bad. Why? Because follower count is a such a horrible signal to, you know, if you're a good actor or a bad actor. Right now if you look on FriendTech though, if you look at the key prices and the type of people that are holding it, you can see the scam or non legitimate accounts that have tens of thousands or even a hundred thousand followers on Twitter have no traction. The people know who's good to bet on and who's not. And it's actually a good signal in terms of a person's reputation and how they handle some handled themselves in this market over the last several years.
00:33:36.029 - 00:34:13.445, Speaker D: Right. The one thing that I would be concerned about is like if you, if people in defi or a lot of protocols started using, you know, friend tech as a way to judge reputation one like how could it be gamed but also to how does value accrue back to FriendTech at all? Right. Can friend tech put in ways where there are easier plugins that they can create in order to make this more of a possibility, but also make the UX better and then also get some value back to this ecosystem. Right. I think there's a ton of things that could be built on top of fronttech which we're very involved in right now.
00:34:13.485 - 00:34:22.605, Speaker A: Yeah. So I want to go back to the game like the different metas, but let's go to what could be built on fronttech.
00:34:22.765 - 00:34:25.955, Speaker D: Yeah. Nine. Nine, nine.
00:34:26.335 - 00:34:28.695, Speaker A: So maybe talk about what you released recently.
00:34:28.775 - 00:34:29.215, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:34:29.295 - 00:34:32.023, Speaker A: And then talk about 99 and all the other good stuff.
00:34:32.119 - 00:35:19.069, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. So what we released recently is sort of like a skeleton or template smart contract. So we implemented a proxy contract that allows you to essentially buy frontec keys into a proxy contract which then maps, you know, your holdings within it and then it allows you to transfer free of charge the keys to anyone. It allows the receiver then to sell it directly to the friend tech contract receiving eth or transfer it back to another person. So like gifting works. Now you can approve for transfers which is what you do in defi when you approve a protocol to take your ERC 20s. So you can now build protocols on top of friend tech, like lending and borrowing, for example, which is what we meant by nine.
00:35:19.069 - 00:36:03.653, Speaker D: Nine. And then there's also like a pre sale mechanism that allows people to basically launching I think is one of the hardest parts of friend tech and one of the big problems, right? Because sure, it gives you the dopamine hit, but then you quickly realize, wait, the guy that bought up all my keys is a bot? It's not really a person who immediately extracts all of that value away from the ecosystem and exits. Now we've been doing self sniping, but self sniping is an issue because the creator, you know, puts in ethics, can't really sell the shares that they sniped. And then the snipe bots just come in right after because they know that the creator is probably not going to dump on them. And then people buy in higher now, right? And then they get dumped on by the bots. So it's still an issue. Now we tried some things like sell back in immediately.
00:36:03.653 - 00:36:39.327, Speaker D: What we realized is there's so many bots. So even the bot that immediately had an unrealized loss in terms of PNL got saved by another bot that had limited basically to just like pump it up again. Right? And it's like, oh God. Right. So sandwiching doesn't really work on a, on a bonding curve mechanism because people will just buy in after. So essentially what we thought about was how do we fix this? Let's try a pre sale mechanism where actually you can give users a fixed price. Creators can then distribute to the users the keys at the lowest possible price below any bot entries.
00:36:39.327 - 00:37:27.965, Speaker D: Right? So now bots are taking extreme risk to be coming into this trade because, you know, after 20% fees you also need a lot of people that can't sell, right? I mean you have a bunch of people that now can sell at the cheapest price because their entry is much lower through the pre sale. So you really need a lot more people to come in and the bots are just now trading, then they're taking risk like everybody else, right? So yeah, like we think that's one of the most fair mechanisms to launch. We've got a lot of accounts that want to use this and try it out. We've had projects basically contact us saying they're going to build a front end for it, they're going to build a launch pad on frontech. Now we've got two projects that said that they want to build the lend and borrow on top of it. And we can see so many possible things coming out of this.
00:37:28.005 - 00:37:34.383, Speaker B: Essentially do peer to peer trading. So instead of buying and selling to the bonding curve, we sell, buy and sell to each other.
00:37:34.479 - 00:38:11.935, Speaker D: Yes, you can. So if you were to buy keys into the proxy contract, then they become transferable. So you could technically swap and trade keys with no fees. But we've not mentioned that as much because then the whole value of FriendTech going back to the creators sort of goes away. And then I feel like, you know, the friend tech team would also not be very happy with that. So yeah, I do think, like, it's good for this ecosystem to bring value back to the creators, otherwise the cycle sort of breaks down.
00:38:12.055 - 00:38:14.695, Speaker B: Would that also support fractionalized shares?
00:38:14.735 - 00:38:15.315, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:38:15.775 - 00:38:19.551, Speaker B: So if you have all of these things, you have all the ingredients for defi summer.
00:38:19.703 - 00:38:23.423, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, so it's not copium.
00:38:23.519 - 00:38:24.223, Speaker B: It's not copium.
00:38:24.279 - 00:38:31.729, Speaker D: We basically turned each key into its like owner C20 token essentially, and just built the skeleton contract interface for it, essentially.
00:38:31.777 - 00:38:32.569, Speaker B: Okay, Yeah.
00:38:32.657 - 00:38:34.125, Speaker A: I mean, are you all in?
00:38:34.785 - 00:38:38.377, Speaker B: I mean, we, we still need Jerome to, to start to turn the printer on.
00:38:38.441 - 00:39:13.745, Speaker A: But Jerome, if you're watching this, I just want to dive deeper into this because this is so interesting. So I bought Dan Robinson's key before I ended up selling it. Great Alpha, by the way, so highly recommend buying Dan Robinson. I'm going to buy it again soon. But a lot of people were worried about the Biden curve. They're like, well, you know, can we change a binding curve? He goes, no, like, you know, there's only a certain amount of buys, you know, until it gets just too expensive for someone to like, they get priced out. Right, because of the binding curve.
00:39:13.745 - 00:40:03.669, Speaker A: And he said something very interesting. He said, you know, there is an element of building out read only access keys, right? And read only access keys could be, you know, on top of the key holders, right? And the idea here is like someone buys this and they can just read the content, but they can't interact with the creator. And then the person is like, well, how is that value going to accrue to keyholders? That's not fair. It's just going to create more of an imbalance in terms of where values in accrue. He goes, well, technically price could be split between the key holders and the creators. And so thinking about what fronttech would do to cannibalize some of the startups that are building on tech, because if you think about it fronttech is going to be, they're going to try to take share.
00:40:03.757 - 00:40:04.125, Speaker D: Right.
00:40:04.205 - 00:40:35.503, Speaker A: Because this is their ecosystem. Similar to Uniswap. Right. Uniswap built out Uniswap the protocol, then it's front end, then Uniswap X, the intent aggregator, its own wallet and so kind of own the entire value chain. Is that how we're thinking here too? Or like how are we thinking about this? I know maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but do we see a flourishing defi ecosystem or do we see like, you know, some cannibalization happening? Like what do you see? I guess the question I'm asking is like what is fronttech going to build natively and what do you think is going to be left open to DeFi?
00:40:35.559 - 00:41:34.685, Speaker D: Yeah. The one issue with Frontech's main contract is that it's immutable. So other than I think the fee switch, switching the fee rate, they can't change the bonding curve at all, which Dan's already mentioned, and basically the core mechanism can't be changed. That's why creating a separate contract that handles read only keys is one option they can go with, but the core structure can't change. Now the reason why I like lend and borrow, although there's a massive risk that comes to the ecosystem with it, is one, it's an oracle free lend and borrow protocol. Why? Because you know, the prices are fixed on a bonding curve, so it's deterministic and you don't need to rely on any oracles. That's amazing because liquidators can now fully atomically handle liquidations and they're very incentivized to do so easily by just giving them like a 5% cut.
00:41:34.685 - 00:42:08.989, Speaker D: Um, and now you've got a lend and borrow protocol that has no oracle and basically has very low risk of bad debt. Right. AKA this London borrower protocol becomes as safe as like almost aave, for example. So how does value accrue back to front tech in this case? I thought about it. It's like the liquidations themselves. In order to liquidate, you go from the proxy contract, call sell shares in order to sell the collateral. The sell shares function function then calls the main friend tech contract which then pays 10% back to the creator and Friendtech.
00:42:08.989 - 00:42:38.357, Speaker D: Right. So London borrow protocol, I think, you know there will be some value accrual back to friend tech because all of the liquidations basically means you're trading the keys through the bonding curve, which has the liquidity and therefore you're going to end up basically getting something back to FriendTech. Now, OTC swaps is a, it's a bit different, right? If someone builds an OTC market on top of the proxy contract, essentially you're taking away a lot of the value that would go back to the creators in front tech.
00:42:38.421 - 00:42:39.985, Speaker A: And I'm sure they're thinking about this.
00:42:40.845 - 00:43:49.047, Speaker C: Yeah, I do think about like, you know, these are like more potential kind of use cases and like things that we can do with keys if we were to kind of turn them effectively into like ERC 20s. But at the same time, at what point does that kind of break the social dynamics on which like friendtech is built? Right? If people are just going to be able to kind of like PvP like trade keys with one another, you know, does that kind of like lessen the value and like, you know, lessen the type of like initial commitment that I feel into like buying a key? Right. Because if I just buy a razor key, maybe I can just swap it for a couple other keys of someone else, you know, later on or something like that, versus me saying, all right, if I'm buying this racer key, I'm going to, I'm going to hold this because it's a large financial commitment, right? But I can also kind of see other functionalities such as like borrow lending, kind of even intensifying some of those, you know, social obligations that we're kind of forming in front tech, right. Like let's say, you know, if someone buys a ton of my keys and they collateralize it to take out like a huge loan, right? I'm going to start feeling the pressure, like, oh man, I need to like make sure that I keep bringing value because if people dump like someone out there is going to get liquidated because of me, right?
00:43:49.231 - 00:44:24.087, Speaker B: So the immutability of the contract, how big of a problem is it really? In other words, specifically the bonding curve. So like there's a lot of talks on Twitter about why the bounding curve is not ideal. For example, it goes up like exponentially. It scales exponentially as N goes up, which means probably the number of people per group is going to be limited because people can pay for that much money to join the group. So there's limitations to the bounding curve like that and the fact that this bonding curve is immutable how big of a problem it is.
00:44:24.231 - 00:45:05.555, Speaker D: So security wise, it's amazing, if it were to be able to be modified, would be really concerned about the security of front tech, especially on the smart contract side. So that's good. Now is it a solvable Problem, it is solvable by building in new features that allows more people to access, but gates them on, you know, specific features. For example, actually talking and interacting in these groups with read only access. Right. I do think that, you know, the concerns are a bit like overheated on the bonding curve. I think it's because there's a lot of people that get priced out of these keys and then they're voicing their opinions and it's a bit of like group think happening.
00:45:05.555 - 00:45:54.465, Speaker D: But really like, don't you want exclusivity into your rooms? Right. As a creator, you don't want a thousand plus people in your room chatting to you because at one point it becomes way too much and you know, the utility actually goes away because it's like I can never get their attention because there's too many people in this room. Right. So actually I think it's very good for it to become virtually like impossible to enter a room after a certain number of people unless you're really paying because you're buying in because of the utility. No longer for the financial sort of aspect of the key price going up just because like, you know, you want to talk to them and that actually like keeps the, like maintains the utility because there's value in that and there's exclusivity basically. Yeah.
00:45:54.505 - 00:46:30.375, Speaker C: And that's kind of why I mentioned that FriendTech is very much like a template for potential other apps in the future. Right. Thinking about the addressable market of something like FriendTech, right. It seems like it's still very much limited to perhaps like people with a lot of capital or just people within CT or people within the crypto space that you know, are, that can be degens. Right. And to Jay's point, it seems like Frantic itself. Like this model, you know, perhaps with like its current bonding curve would be a good supplement as kind of like an exclusivity platform on top of like someone else's, you know, more traditional social media following.
00:46:30.375 - 00:46:58.389, Speaker C: Right. Like if you like my Twitter content, that's great. Like if you want to see more exclusive content, you know, then purchase my keys and then like we can, we can talk on there. Right. But I do think it's kind of interesting to think about how the social dynamics that the template of Friend Tech creates can be used for, you know, other use cases in the future. Like we've talked a lot about like, you know, proof of identity and scoring people based upon like their defections or just like their on chain activity. Right.
00:46:58.389 - 00:47:23.489, Speaker C: This is something that, you know, crypto has been trying to solve for a long time in terms of, you know, financialization of like the world's unbanked. Right. I'm not saying that, you know, people in emerging markets and all over the world are going to start purchasing keys, but it's an interesting way to kind of think about like, how is this like a potential way for people to start building some kind of like on chain identity that could lead to some kind of like financialization in the future.
00:47:23.617 - 00:47:27.965, Speaker A: So question for you, how do you see this against WorldCoin?
00:47:28.785 - 00:47:46.665, Speaker C: Right. Yes. We mentioned a little bit yesterday too. I feel like FriendTech was kind of able to kind of bootstrap and kind of proof of humanity kind of a lot faster than worldcoin. Right. And I don't have to scan my eyes or my cornea in order to start having some kind of on chain identity that's actually tied to me.
00:47:46.745 - 00:47:51.615, Speaker B: Is it actually faster than worldcoin in terms of number of people who scan their eyeballs?
00:47:52.195 - 00:48:05.763, Speaker C: I'm not too sure about the actual figures, but it just does seem a lot more convenient versus just scanning my eyeballs and having to line up. Right. I'm hearing worldcoin has a lot of operational logistical issues right now kind of onboarding a lot of users.
00:48:05.859 - 00:48:11.187, Speaker B: For the non crypto natives, I feel like Frentech onboarding is a very painful.
00:48:11.251 - 00:48:13.625, Speaker A: Process, but it's a solvable problem.
00:48:13.675 - 00:48:22.181, Speaker B: It's a solid problem. I'm just saying that the status quo, I think for non crypto natives work one is easier to onboard. For crypto natives like us, of course.
00:48:22.213 - 00:48:44.205, Speaker D: The thing is like that one is very easily solvable. It's not an immutable contract type of thing. It's literally three lines of code in their front end and they could actually fix it pretty quickly where you just give access to the app without having to deposit or buy your first share. Right. Let people look at what's going on, see how the app works before they have to commit eth, figure out how to get it there and buy their first share.
00:48:45.185 - 00:49:16.359, Speaker A: Before this, we were talking a bit about the metas. I'm starting to see. I don't know if this is the end of the meta, but aggregators, right? There's aggregators that are acting as if an index where they'll buy a bunch of keys and then they'll share the alpha. There was something called friendbook, I think that got shut down recently from Salience, was it? And there's a couple other aggregators that I see, Levy and others. So I mean, I feel like they don't have a moat. Right. And eventually they'll be cut off access if they continue to do this.
00:49:16.359 - 00:49:53.177, Speaker A: But how do you see these products are being built around these. Around the frontech ecosystem, like aggregators as an example. What other things are you seeing? I also saw something called friend games and Stumble upon you or something. And these are games that are being built on top of the friend tech ecosystem where you use your identity as a way to authenticate and then you could see your avatar and you could see your username in these games. So it's kind of crazy. So I just want to kind of touch on like things that could be built using your identity and similar to like, you know, Google OAuth. Right.
00:49:53.177 - 00:50:02.097, Speaker A: You OAuth into new accounts that you create, I guess. Like where is this? Like do you see this going that way as well? Or like how do you see that?
00:50:02.201 - 00:50:06.673, Speaker D: So Stumble upon that game? Actually we helped launch on tech. Yeah.
00:50:06.729 - 00:50:07.845, Speaker A: Okay. I didn't know that.
00:50:08.345 - 00:50:13.873, Speaker D: I actually didn't realize that they were doing that much with friend tech. I just thought it was a random.
00:50:13.929 - 00:50:19.665, Speaker A: No, I think Friend games was. And then Stumble upon is using their keys as a way to do something. I forgot what it was.
00:50:19.745 - 00:50:46.981, Speaker D: Yeah. But yeah, we did help them. It's really good to see things like that being built and new utilities being found versus there's already 50 competitors on aggregators tooling analytics, which is great. It's bullish that so many developers are for free or just because they're incentivized to get their key price up. Which doesn't actually mean that they make that much money. Right. It's just reputation almost.
00:50:46.981 - 00:51:44.805, Speaker D: They're spending that much time to release these types of products right now there's a ton of these analytics tools and whatnot. But what we're more interested in are these new utilities that people are going to try to find or real projects, full projects that are getting built on top of it. But it's kind of similar to early days of Defi, right. We had like Defi Pulse and then Coingecko trying to like integrate some of like the liquidity depth into their pages. And then you had Defi Llama. And then with these analytics tools though, at the end of the day like maybe one survives and becomes like the fully featured one that everyone uses, which Defi Llama is now. But with Rentec like it'll be interesting to see who actually wins out of that massive red ocean of analytics tooling competition versus there's going to be a couple projects that come On, I think that become very big and the major friend tech plays that are built on top of it.
00:51:45.185 - 00:52:16.855, Speaker B: So you said the onboarding was a fairly easy fix, a few lines of code. Let's talk about downboarding, because when I first got onboarded it was really painful. You have to sign in with your Apple or Google, you have to sign in with Twitter, you have to bridge some money, deposit some money, then you can get started. It's at least three steps. Oh, and also you have to enter the invite code. It's four steps, really painful. Has that changed and how do you think we can improve the onboarding even further?
00:52:17.395 - 00:53:10.257, Speaker D: So it hasn't really changed. The main thing that FriendTech changed was basically allowing users instead of having to bridge to base themselves, wait until that bridge is done to deposit into the wallet. Now they give you a link to go to and then from there you can just deposit to a wallet address on mainnet where most people hold their eth. And so that did make it slightly easier. But the initial Web2 login auth and then linking the Twitter, the invite code stuff hasn't changed. Now for very large accounts, there's actually a lot of like non crypto native artists that I know who actually have like tens of thousands of followers or even more on Twitter. And what happened with them? And even with like Yatsu, the CEO of atomoca who we were onboarding, he goes, wait, there's no step to deposit Ethan to an address.
00:53:10.257 - 00:53:48.269, Speaker D: And I was like, what do you mean? Like, yeah, there is. And he's like, no, it just like skipped that step. And I'm like, huh, that like FriendTech like changed the onboarding mechanism and then it clicked to me. The bots, the sniper bots who don't want to spam for like, you know, hours waiting for the guy to fund the wallet, they actually send dust to the ETH wallet on base that's connected to their FriendTech account because they can query the API so they can pull it and make sure, oh, this Twitter account owns this wallet. They throw in dust so that it skips that deposit step and then boom, like they're getting baited. They're getting baited to buy the first key so that they can immediately snipe it.
00:53:48.337 - 00:53:49.045, Speaker B: Oh my God.
00:53:49.125 - 00:53:54.365, Speaker A: Yeah, the level of like sophistication, it's mind boggling.
00:53:54.405 - 00:53:55.373, Speaker D: I mean it's so beautiful.
00:53:55.469 - 00:53:56.557, Speaker A: Psychology, right?
00:53:56.701 - 00:54:02.145, Speaker D: Markets are beautifully efficient, like quite efficient. Yeah. It's hard to find inefficiencies.
00:54:02.965 - 00:54:16.925, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, speaking of that, like the first two weeks were it was Very easy for us to buy like good people at cheap prices. But week three, like the moment you see them, they're priced at one ethical. It's crazy. Like the market is so efficient now.
00:54:16.965 - 00:54:17.589, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:54:17.757 - 00:54:28.517, Speaker A: Speaking of onboarding, also, like, I'm curious, like, we're like hovering around 30 to 35 million TVL and I think, you know, we'll slowly grow, but we won't grow exponentially.
00:54:28.621 - 00:54:30.145, Speaker B: And I love how you say we.
00:54:31.485 - 00:55:04.357, Speaker A: It is a part of my platform. We own this token. There's a lot of concerns about, you know, security. I feel like we're hovering around 30, 35 million TVL and I don't think we're going to grow as fast as Defi summer unless we solve security. And Privy is like one element and then there's also front tech. And the question, you know, any legal compliance team will ask is like, what's the security framework in place? Is it trustworthy? Are there like attack vectors?
00:55:04.541 - 00:55:06.421, Speaker B: Is that a cold storage? Which is not.
00:55:06.493 - 00:55:11.269, Speaker A: Yeah, because everyone uses Ledger or they use Fireblocks and others.
00:55:11.357 - 00:55:40.305, Speaker B: All the funds. By the way, one of the key alphas in crypto since the beginning of Bitcoin is operational risks and custody risks. The reason why the retail front ran all the institutions was precisely because of that. And we're seeing the same thing with Frantic. All the individuals, all the retail are front running the VCs because of security and custody. So how do you feel about custody?
00:55:40.465 - 00:55:47.313, Speaker D: Yeah, so embedded wallets, right. That's what Privy provides. I mean they provide the whole signup onboarding flow as well.
00:55:47.449 - 00:55:55.041, Speaker B: But it is definitely by embedded wallet you mean not having to sign transactions with like a MetaMask app that plus.
00:55:55.073 - 00:55:57.833, Speaker D: You don't have to create your own wallet, they create it for you.
00:55:57.969 - 00:55:59.905, Speaker A: Talk a bit about what that is. Wallet as a service.
00:56:00.025 - 00:56:25.621, Speaker D: Yep. So embedded wallets, basically when you create an account on FriendTech or any consumer app that's using Privy on the backend, for example Blackbird. Yeah. Or Xerox Pass. So these, the app infra layer, essentially what happens is on a normal, you know, account creation, you could use Google Loss even to create an account on the back end. A wallet address is generated for you along with its private mnemonic. Right.
00:56:25.621 - 00:57:05.625, Speaker D: Now that secret key, the private key is split into three shares. One goes into the user's local storage device, which the app, neither the app nor Privy can see. The other one goes into a database where the user can use an API call with their API key in order to get it. And then the last one is A recovery share that gets encrypted by the user using a password. Now, fronttech didn't actually enable that option to encrypt that third key. So the recovery key is actually unencrypted. So there's three shares.
00:57:05.625 - 00:57:35.685, Speaker D: You need two of those three in order to get the private key. And so when you click Export Wallet, what happens is it actually combines two of the three shares, one from your local and then one API request to get the second share. And then boom, it generates your private key so that you can export the wallet. Right. So that's how Privy works at the moment. FriendTech unfortunately did not add the password encryption in order to get rid of one extra step on the ombre onboarding. So your keys are actually like.
00:57:35.685 - 00:57:49.913, Speaker D: Technically, if FriendTech changed a couple lines of their code, they would be able to snoop their users on onboarding and be able to actually reconstruct your private key without your consent, technically. So that is.
00:57:50.049 - 00:57:52.681, Speaker B: But you would have to. The user needs to update the app.
00:57:52.753 - 00:57:53.057, Speaker A: Right.
00:57:53.121 - 00:57:55.209, Speaker B: In order for Frantic to.
00:57:55.377 - 00:58:00.017, Speaker D: No, no, users don't need to update the app because it's a browser home screen app.
00:58:00.081 - 00:58:04.935, Speaker B: Oh, that's right, yeah, totally, yeah. Pwa. That's right.
00:58:04.975 - 00:58:05.663, Speaker A: We should talk about pwa.
00:58:05.679 - 00:58:07.223, Speaker B: Yeah, we should talk about that as well.
00:58:07.359 - 00:58:45.321, Speaker D: So it is concerning, like, you're putting a lot of trust. So there's already almost 40 million TVL technically, like Friendtech could, if they were to turn into a malicious actor, you're putting a lot of trust in them. Now, if the user encryption, so the password encryption were there. And also Privy itself is adding 2fa on top to add more security to the whole embedded wallet design. It's actually quite secure and apps have the option to enable it. But FriendTech didn't. But privy will be recommending apps basically, to make sure that they do that.
00:58:45.473 - 00:58:55.227, Speaker B: Essentially, if you lose your phone and you want to access your account again, you would sign in with the same Google or Apple ID that you sign up first.
00:58:55.321 - 00:58:55.647, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:58:55.711 - 00:59:02.871, Speaker B: And then Privy will generate the other shard. So then you have the two of the two to access your account.
00:59:02.943 - 00:59:49.155, Speaker D: Yeah, correct, correct. Now, I think one other thing that I forgot to mention is, you know, like when you're actually logging into Friend Tech or signing up, like, it's much safer to use like Google or Apple, because with your phone number, the whole sim swapping thing, because there's no 2fa with friend tech specifically, when you're logging in, you could be giving someone all access to your keys and your shares and the eth on your wallet within fronttech if you get SIM swapped. Right. Which is not impossible to do or it's quite easy to do now. So I would say, given that fronttech hasn't enabled two fa, new people signing on should definitely use Google or Apple.
00:59:49.505 - 00:59:51.685, Speaker A: When will they enable 2fa?
00:59:52.705 - 01:00:20.951, Speaker D: So the issue is that they can't enable Friendtech, can't like retroactively enable 2fa for the users because the 2fa is part of the encryption of the recovery key, potentially is what Privy is trying to do. But new wallets, they could basically enforce it. And even now, like, they could enforce the user generated password to additionally encrypt the recovery share so that they can never have control of the user private keys.
01:00:20.983 - 01:00:24.047, Speaker A: So they can enable user generated password today. Today.
01:00:24.111 - 01:00:26.471, Speaker D: Okay, but for future users only.
01:00:26.583 - 01:00:30.479, Speaker A: Oh, so what do Retro users do? Do they have to shut their account down and restart?
01:00:30.567 - 01:00:40.675, Speaker D: No. So Retro users would have to authenticate it. Like each and every one of them would have to authenticate this change and they would have to migrate their wallet, basically.
01:00:41.105 - 01:00:42.505, Speaker A: Oh, what a painful process.
01:00:42.585 - 01:00:42.937, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:00:43.001 - 01:00:46.793, Speaker A: So they would have to sell all the keys and transfer. Or can they reassign the keys?
01:00:46.849 - 01:01:21.735, Speaker D: Yeah, that's why it's like probably, like based on my technical knowledge of how the encryption and decryption works, is that's probably what's going to have to happen, Rip. Yeah, I mean, or they could basically get the user's private key during the wallet phase and then automatically just re encrypt and then erase the existing shares that are on the local storage and the database and the recovery share and then regenerate those shares with like the new encryption mechanism essentially. So like might not have to actually migrate all the shares.
01:01:21.855 - 01:01:34.377, Speaker B: Okay, what does it take for funds that have LPs money, not prop money to get onboarded? What kind of security model is required of them?
01:01:34.481 - 01:02:03.351, Speaker C: That's definitely a tough one. Right. Like with all the security kind of vulnerabilities that Jay just mentioned does kind of put a lot of issues into funds feeling safe enough to, you know, custody, you know, LP capital into, you know, friend tech. Right. The only reason that Manifold is able to do it is because we manage proprietary capital. But for funds, in order to actually manage, put external LP capital onto the platform, that's going to be a much larger hurdle. Right.
01:02:03.351 - 01:02:31.585, Speaker C: There's the security vulnerabilities, but at the same time, Frantic itself would have to be either using a qualified custodian in the back end for some kind of like, institutional version, or they themselves would have to have Qualified custodian licensure. Right. And as we kind of see with regulators right now, like you know, even holding assets on like an exchange, you know, could potentially be some kind of violation of like custody, you know, fiduciary duty that a fund would have to for its investors.
01:02:31.705 - 01:02:36.745, Speaker D: I mean most institutions can't even touch Defi yet, so they're so early.
01:02:36.905 - 01:02:38.245, Speaker A: Yeah, we're so early.
01:02:38.585 - 01:02:47.105, Speaker B: Even, even crypto VCs crypto natives could frantic build a desktop app.
01:02:47.145 - 01:02:47.425, Speaker C: They did.
01:02:47.465 - 01:02:50.745, Speaker A: I think they did. Yeah. It was just announced a day ago.
01:02:50.825 - 01:02:51.569, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, it was.
01:02:51.617 - 01:02:52.937, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
01:02:53.041 - 01:02:55.889, Speaker D: Spamming racers chat. Can you just like support desktop?
01:02:55.977 - 01:03:00.203, Speaker B: Desktop plus hardware wallet. Would that be enough for VCs?
01:03:00.379 - 01:03:17.055, Speaker D: Hardware wallets would definitely help a lot of things, but it's just like the UX versus security. Right. Are you going to give up the UX of better onboarding through Privy to now cater towards institutions?
01:03:17.475 - 01:03:29.421, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the risk return profile is still misaligned right now for true onslaught of funds to come in and start actually risking out external LP capital on the platform.
01:03:29.533 - 01:03:31.345, Speaker B: I'm just thinking about the top signal.
01:03:32.125 - 01:03:33.077, Speaker A: We're so early.
01:03:33.181 - 01:03:33.945, Speaker B: I know.
01:03:35.405 - 01:03:37.613, Speaker A: Let's wait for the VC thesis articles.
01:03:37.669 - 01:03:39.981, Speaker B: That's exactly, exactly what I'm looking for.
01:03:40.133 - 01:03:42.293, Speaker D: When they're releasing a thesis soon.
01:03:42.429 - 01:03:43.905, Speaker B: All right, but you guys are not.
01:03:45.205 - 01:03:46.585, Speaker C: Top signal right here.
01:03:50.015 - 01:04:15.027, Speaker A: There's a 0x Ngmi, who's the founder of DeFi Llama, recently tweeted that there's also another attack vector by attacking the front end or the iframe. Yeah, correct. Can you talk a little bit more about that? Yeah, because that's also worried because the technical arguments make sense. And the thing that scares me the most is that all I have to do is open the app and that's it, it's over.
01:04:15.151 - 01:04:51.415, Speaker D: So it's classic attack vectors. Right. On the user side it's like trying to avoid phishing scams. But on the app side there's a lot of things you can do to prevent a lot of those simple attack vectors. Hopefully FriendTech is doing a lot of those best practices and also trying to defend against it. Privy. According to Henry, the CEO works with the apps themselves on the front end to make sure they are implementing a lot of those things that like prevent those attack vectors from actually occurring.
01:04:51.415 - 01:04:55.247, Speaker D: So I think that's like less of a concern. It's like pretty easily preventable.
01:04:55.311 - 01:04:55.623, Speaker A: Okay.
01:04:55.679 - 01:04:56.791, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:04:56.823 - 01:04:58.855, Speaker A: I mean I. When I saw that my heart sunk.
01:04:58.895 - 01:04:59.143, Speaker D: Right.
01:04:59.199 - 01:05:00.287, Speaker A: So I'm like.
01:05:00.471 - 01:05:00.959, Speaker D: And it.
01:05:01.007 - 01:05:08.295, Speaker A: But then it also reminded me of early Defi Summer, like yam and others. And I got. We got rugged with Pickle a few times, if you remember that.
01:05:08.375 - 01:05:10.575, Speaker B: But those were not. Like, they weren't custody.
01:05:10.655 - 01:05:13.331, Speaker A: Yeah, but they were just like different attack vectors. Right?
01:05:13.383 - 01:05:13.643, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:05:13.699 - 01:05:17.171, Speaker A: And so you know this smart contract, I had PTSD from DeFi.
01:05:17.243 - 01:05:17.643, Speaker B: Exactly.
01:05:17.699 - 01:05:21.507, Speaker D: The cool thing about friend tech is the smart contract risk is actually very low.
01:05:21.571 - 01:05:22.051, Speaker A: Okay.
01:05:22.163 - 01:05:24.731, Speaker D: It's like 50 lines of code and immutable. Right.
01:05:24.763 - 01:05:29.475, Speaker A: So it's the base stuff. Like building on your proxy contract is an example. There's still risk involved with that, right?
01:05:29.515 - 01:05:47.411, Speaker D: Yeah. Yeah. So actually, like, compared to Defi, smart contract risk is low. Bridge risk is not very bad with base. Right. I think the actual bigger security risk is on the SEC security. Well, that plus just the whole.
01:05:47.411 - 01:06:04.067, Speaker D: I mean, that's going to take a while to play out. Right. But I think the bigger security issue is what you're talking about with like the app side. How are they managing everything? Because they're, you know, we're all okay with the compromise for better ux, but at the same time, the risk definitely increases the more centralized it becomes. Right.
01:06:04.171 - 01:06:07.883, Speaker B: They could get compromised internally even if the founders didn't want to.
01:06:08.019 - 01:06:16.547, Speaker D: Correct. So one developer at FriendTech who knows their shit could technically rogue a rogue. I mean, that's the same thing with MetaMask, though.
01:06:16.691 - 01:06:17.107, Speaker B: Yes.
01:06:17.171 - 01:06:19.603, Speaker D: Yeah. And we can all get very, very fucked.
01:06:19.659 - 01:06:19.963, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:06:20.019 - 01:06:20.531, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:06:20.643 - 01:06:24.235, Speaker B: I mean, that reminds me of the Axie hack, the Ronin Bridge hack.
01:06:24.275 - 01:06:24.523, Speaker A: Yes.
01:06:24.579 - 01:06:25.803, Speaker B: It was an internal compromise.
01:06:25.859 - 01:06:30.735, Speaker A: Yeah, that was scary too. Yeah. Today's points day.
01:06:31.155 - 01:06:31.707, Speaker B: Oh, yeah?
01:06:31.771 - 01:06:55.779, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'm going to hit refresh every few minutes after in probably another 30 minutes. I'm assuming everyone else does that. It's great because all the chats start to liven up and they're like, did you get your points yet? Send me a screenshot. And I guess this from a meta perspective. Do you think this is just. I mean, obviously it's speculative driven.
01:06:55.779 - 01:07:18.255, Speaker A: Right. People are farming the points. I've seen some crazy numbers out there, from 0.50 or 50 cents to cl says, I don't know, like 100 bucks. I don't know. But do you think this is primarily speculative driven and this won't be. Would this turn into a habit? Is this, like, habit for me? Like, is there a reason why they did six months? Right.
01:07:18.255 - 01:07:24.443, Speaker A: Is it to form this habit so that people become stickier? Like, what's. Like, how are you guys assessing this?
01:07:24.539 - 01:07:30.171, Speaker D: I mean, first of all, like, self buying will not really be a thing anymore if there's no point points associated to it. Right.
01:07:30.203 - 01:07:31.603, Speaker A: They got to Nerf that though.
01:07:31.779 - 01:07:43.475, Speaker D: You won't have guys like Vombatis. Like there's no point. Right. He's just doing a trade. Right. His trade is the fees I'm paying is going to be lower than the airdrop I'm getting. And I mean obviously, right.
01:07:43.475 - 01:07:59.963, Speaker D: It's going to be more than like 10% returns on the airdrop. So like, because if you're self buying and self selling, your round trip is 10%. The trade is a no brainer. Right. So yeah, things like that is pretty interesting. Like that's going to go away as soon as the airdrop happens. Boom, he's out.
01:07:59.963 - 01:08:17.381, Speaker D: Right. Um, you know what other things like habit building is the same thing I think as like pmf. It's like what features and like what actual use cases does friend tech bring that has PMF versus what's activity just purely to farm the airdrop.
01:08:17.573 - 01:09:03.022, Speaker C: Yeah, like that, that's what I feel like is the true deciding factor for both friend tech and also other kind of blockchain enabled consumer applications going forward. It's just how do you shift your, the value of your platform from solely being speculative to actually having some kind of true utility? And that's kind of hard to really imagine concretely for these apps and for stuff like friend tech. Right. I think as we've mentioned, right, Like a lot of people are trying to. There's people that are actually interacting with the application and trying to like earn points like organically actually participating. There's people who are, you know, looking at it as a trade or people who are just gaming the process, like going through like hundreds of chats and just saying GM every day just to try to like, you know, rack up those points. Right, right, right, exactly.
01:09:03.158 - 01:09:03.830, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:09:03.982 - 01:09:32.525, Speaker C: I mean that, that's, that's gaming system. But I also think that some of that is still effective in terms of, you know, getting over that cold start problem for applications. Right. Like there's, there's a healthy amount of gaming just so people can just interact with the application as well. Right. But I feel like blockchain is always really good at getting over the cold start problem. But the actual sustained sustenance of value over time is what we have an issue with in this space.
01:09:32.525 - 01:09:54.625, Speaker C: Which is why I keep going back to the point where I think applications like this as an end all be all might not be very effective in the long term, but it's very great for you know, initially bootstrapping that crowd base. Right, Bootstrapping Your fans and having that supplement, like a much more like, you know, sustainable, you know, platform underneath.
01:09:54.745 - 01:10:14.753, Speaker B: Come to think of it, six months is a really good number. It's a great number. It's a sweet spot because if it's too long, people will be like, I was just, this is going to last too long. I'm not going to play this game. But if it's just one month. Okay, so one month might be enough to form the habit of. Because you got hooked like I got the first day.
01:10:14.753 - 01:10:16.305, Speaker B: One day. One day was enough for you?
01:10:16.345 - 01:10:16.833, Speaker A: Yeah, it's.
01:10:16.889 - 01:10:30.023, Speaker B: But. But one month is not enough for people to build all these like, games. And the proxy contract, that stuff will take around a few months. That's why the six months. Such a.
01:10:30.079 - 01:10:30.919, Speaker A: It's a genius idea.
01:10:30.967 - 01:10:32.271, Speaker B: Such a beautiful number.
01:10:32.463 - 01:10:46.625, Speaker D: You can actually build an ecosystem at that time. Yeah, yeah. A tangent that I wanted to talk about actually is just, you know, incentives won't go away completely even after the airdrop. Right. They'll still incentivize, but there's a market value to the incentivization.
01:10:46.705 - 01:10:47.153, Speaker A: Yes.
01:10:47.249 - 01:11:04.617, Speaker D: So it'll clearly be lower in our heads. Right. In our imagination. The thing is, like, there are a lot of sustainable ecosystems out there where incentives are so low, but people still play the game. Right. And an example is gaming. Right.
01:11:04.617 - 01:11:19.357, Speaker D: Crypto likes to think that they invented play to earn, but there were play to earn games way before crypto even existed. Right. Maplestory is like a big one. Right. I grew up with Maplestory. There are adults that play their friends. Yeah, they're adults that play this game.
01:11:19.357 - 01:11:20.693, Speaker D: What, like you don't want to know what it is?
01:11:20.749 - 01:11:21.205, Speaker A: I don't.
01:11:21.285 - 01:11:21.945, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:11:22.525 - 01:11:26.477, Speaker A: I'm laughing, like, awkwardly. Wait, what's Maplestory?
01:11:26.581 - 01:11:34.805, Speaker D: Yeah, so Maplestory is a game where you have a character, you buy like equipment, weapons and whatnot, and you like kill monsters, do quests and you get rewarded for it. Right.
01:11:34.885 - 01:11:35.865, Speaker A: In what though?
01:11:36.235 - 01:11:42.651, Speaker D: And so there's an in game currency called meso. And then there's also like these items. Right. With different stats.
01:11:42.683 - 01:11:44.443, Speaker A: But I mean. But other games have this too though.
01:11:44.539 - 01:12:02.635, Speaker D: Right? Right. But the thing is, you know, it's actually a really interesting economy because these monsters spawn. So there's an inflation rate too. Like because when the monsters get killed, you get gold or like Mesa. Right. And so there's an inflation rate because there's constant supply of this, like dropping new items and. And new currency.
01:12:02.635 - 01:12:34.735, Speaker D: But at the same time people keep trading with each other to get the best stats and you have this economy. But real full grown adults play this game 14, 16 hours a day sometimes to just farm, hunt and earn this currency. And they can cash it out, they can cash out the items, they can cash out the in game currency, but for 10 bucks, 20 bucks a day with all those hours blood, sweat and tears put into it and they're like, wow, I made real money. And they're happy and they're incentivized to keep playing. Right.
01:12:34.775 - 01:12:36.111, Speaker A: Wait, how does it turn into real money?
01:12:36.223 - 01:12:39.263, Speaker D: There's a market for it. Oh, not crypto.
01:12:39.399 - 01:12:51.303, Speaker A: So this is where it's fundamental because I mean there's other games that offer this type of in game currency. But the difference here is that. Okay, that's cool. Roblox do that with skins.
01:12:51.399 - 01:13:23.205, Speaker D: Yeah. This has existed for a long time. This is true play to earn, right. And even without crazy incentives, people keep playing it and coming back. And that really shows like real PMF and real human demand to keep playing this thing. And I think like you know, apps and crypto consumer apps and like friend tech as well need to find, you know, something like that where even when the incentives are tiny, where your trading fees are generating you close to nothing, you'll still want to keep building relationships, doing stuff because like you're just happy to be. Yeah, yeah.
01:13:23.705 - 01:13:30.617, Speaker A: How do you view shares in the long run? Or keys. Sorry, how do you view it?
01:13:30.641 - 01:13:31.401, Speaker B: Gary, Let me try.
01:13:31.433 - 01:13:32.105, Speaker A: Gary Gaston.
01:13:32.185 - 01:13:33.765, Speaker B: How do you view Gary Gaston?
01:13:34.625 - 01:13:53.485, Speaker A: No, specifically around keys. Like yes, it's a, you know, fixed supply. You get 100 keys, right. And, or whatever. Right, Whatever the binding curve allows one user to do. But what's the evolution behind this? Like what does it become? I mean I'll tell you. My, my edge case, My edge case is that these are like, this is like equity, right.
01:13:53.485 - 01:13:57.189, Speaker A: You're buying into, you're buying into a user, right?
01:13:57.277 - 01:13:58.745, Speaker B: You're doing this on purpose.
01:14:03.485 - 01:14:48.067, Speaker A: Well, I want to play the dynamics here, right? And you have access to this person, right? And this person is going to give you content and whatever, alpha or whatever. And eventually like others want access to this, this individual. And like you see these other products are being built and the creator has to like monetize other ways. Right. And so like I feel like, you know, holding keys could become a yield bearing asset in the long run. Is that true or false? What, where do you see this going? Like where do you like. I guess where I'm trying to get at is like where is fronttech going next? And like do you see division that I see like to this because there's no way you can scale this to 10,000 people because the rooms have to stay small.
01:14:48.131 - 01:14:48.735, Speaker D: Right.
01:14:49.195 - 01:15:01.147, Speaker A: And so there has to be a level of exclusivity. But like if you're talking scale, you know you could see the products that are being built on top and all the fees have, they have to go to key holders. There's no, there's, it's not fair.
01:15:01.291 - 01:15:01.571, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:15:01.603 - 01:15:03.603, Speaker A: Is that, is that the edge case that. What do you think?
01:15:03.739 - 01:15:19.955, Speaker D: I mean I don't think friend tech themselves will be able to fee switch in order to give a cut to the key holders. One regulatory, but two that would require edits to the smart contract. So with existing keys I don't think they can do that.
01:15:19.995 - 01:15:20.615, Speaker A: Okay.
01:15:21.755 - 01:16:06.385, Speaker D: I do think like what direction do keys go and like what additional utilities can they have is actually something that like we can decide as a community and developers like keys becoming a yield bearing asset. What can we do to make that happen? Right. It's actually not that hard. You create a staking contract, right. Using the proxy contract that we built and let you know, the account creator, the room owner to basically put rewards directly into that staking contract so that people earn rewards for staking into this contract. Right. So there are a lot of things you can do to build on top of this ecosystem and I do feel like there will be a lot more projects being built and developers continuing to iterate with stuff over the next couple of months.
01:16:07.525 - 01:16:08.213, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool.
01:16:08.269 - 01:16:33.347, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely a lot of interesting use cases. Right. This is not even considering just the off chain actions that one can do just based off of looking at all their top key holders or whoever buys as many keys or who defects the least will get some kind of exclusive access or surprise or some alpha that I can share or come to a meetup. And these are all just off chain actions. Right. So really the possibilities are really endless in terms of that type of utility.
01:16:33.531 - 01:17:05.175, Speaker A: Yeah. This professional or this pro NFT collector dingaling, he gives a, he gives out an NFT every day and we're talking like legitimate NFTs like Azuki and Mutants and et cetera. So it's interesting to see how they crazy like creating that engagement every single day to make sure that the keys stay up or above the price. But that's another value prop for holding a key. Cool. Any final questions?
01:17:05.635 - 01:17:10.315, Speaker B: I mean let's talk about Gary Gensler, the legal and king.
01:17:10.395 - 01:17:10.779, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:17:10.867 - 01:17:17.419, Speaker B: The securities risk is our frantic keys. Securities, that's.
01:17:17.467 - 01:17:19.587, Speaker C: That's hard to say for sure. Right.
01:17:19.731 - 01:17:20.915, Speaker A: Not to put the pressure on you.
01:17:20.995 - 01:18:34.107, Speaker C: Yeah. I Think I can see like arguments made in both ways, right? Like the very hawkish view, right, Is like, you know, Howie tests, right? I'm buying keys of someone else and then that person is also holding their own keys. And then the work that that person is putting into, you know, engaging in their chat or sharing good alpha and value, right? Leads to the speculation of others to kind of buy keys, which, you know, in turn, you know, is supposed to kind of lead to the financial appreciation of like that key. That is like a very hawkish view, right? I think perhaps like a more pragmatic view is just saying this is not very different from a lot of the monetized platforms that we see in web two, like Patreon or OnlyFans or something like that. You're just purchasing access to view some kind of content. That's what I'm personally hoping is the direction that we're going towards. Although it does get a little murky too when individual creators start, you know, saying certain, you know, promises or guarantees based upon the purchase of like their keys, right? Like, hey, purchase my keys and, you know, I'll share the fees that I trading fees that I generated or like the alpha that I'm.
01:18:34.107 - 01:19:20.695, Speaker C: Or the profit that I'm taking with like the top five holders, right? And that's, that's kind of pretty clearly a sense of like market manipulation of some kind or some kind of like securities violation, right? So it just depends on a case by case basis as to what these creators, how they're actually gamifying this platform and then as to how the SEC actually will go about with enforcement if they do choose. Gets a little complicated too. Are they going to start looking at every single creator and are they going to go after those that made certain promises on Twitter or made certain promises in chats, or are they just going to go tell frontech to just take the whole platform down? Right. These are all types of regulatory risks that we just don't really know how to fully navigate at this moment.
01:19:21.155 - 01:19:28.683, Speaker A: Yeah, the public chats are kind of scary, right? I mean like, I mean, anyone can just buy a key and just read your chat log, right?
01:19:28.739 - 01:19:29.587, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
01:19:29.651 - 01:19:32.651, Speaker A: So you got to be a little bit careful on what you say in the chats.
01:19:32.763 - 01:20:02.225, Speaker D: Yeah. Another issue is that if friend tech gets shut down, unlike Defi protocols, where even if one front end gets shut down, someone else can just spin up a separate, separate front end as an anonymous person with front tech, that's not as possible because you've got the whole centralized layer of not only the key management, but also the API holding, the Twitter link to the address. All these things are not recreatable because everything is very off chain.
01:20:02.645 - 01:20:09.993, Speaker B: I remember bitcloud actually went through several legal actions.
01:20:10.129 - 01:20:10.689, Speaker A: Did they?
01:20:10.777 - 01:20:11.361, Speaker B: Do you remember?
01:20:11.433 - 01:20:14.241, Speaker A: I completely erased BitCloud after the first.
01:20:14.273 - 01:20:15.633, Speaker B: Month after the PTSD.
01:20:15.729 - 01:20:19.777, Speaker A: Yeah. I have no recollection of what happened.
01:20:19.881 - 01:20:28.017, Speaker B: I'm trying to remember what happened, but there was something. So one was BitCloud hit with Cease and desist.
01:20:28.201 - 01:20:30.033, Speaker A: By who? Oh, by individual folks.
01:20:30.089 - 01:20:30.849, Speaker B: By individual folks.
01:20:30.897 - 01:20:32.445, Speaker A: But that's on them, though.
01:20:32.795 - 01:20:40.899, Speaker B: That's on them. But there was something else. I can't remember. Anyway, I don't know if there's any lesson we can learn for friend hug.
01:20:40.947 - 01:21:13.677, Speaker A: But the last topic is forks. We're seeing a ton of forks. Most of them, I think they're all rugged. I think the most recent one that I got like 100 messages to use post tech or whatever. But we've been in the game long enough with the forks and outside of Sushisa being actually a viable competitor at one point, I haven't seen any other forks ever do well. And now it seems like there's a bunch of forks that are coming after friend tech. Bullish.
01:21:13.677 - 01:21:24.229, Speaker A: Bearish Thoughts. Like, Post tech was interesting just because it copied the entire Twitter UI right on Arbitrum.
01:21:24.397 - 01:21:26.265, Speaker B: And is it private or public groups?
01:21:27.885 - 01:21:30.237, Speaker A: I think it's public because it's Twitter.
01:21:30.301 - 01:21:31.149, Speaker B: So it's like big cloud.
01:21:31.197 - 01:21:39.865, Speaker A: It's like big cloud. Yeah, yeah, I think that's what it is. But you could buy and sell people and you could buy and sell posts.
01:21:40.565 - 01:21:42.621, Speaker B: So that's like lens, like.
01:21:42.693 - 01:21:59.367, Speaker A: It's like. It's like a mashup of lens and bit cloud. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, they. I think they did like a million dollars in TVL at one point. And then somebody tweeted out yesterday that the guy just forked someone's GitHub. Yeah.
01:21:59.367 - 01:22:10.835, Speaker A: Open source rehab. And just added a token and said we're going to make a million dollars or something. And the TiVo went down to 350k yesterday.
01:22:11.815 - 01:22:12.167, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:22:12.191 - 01:22:14.047, Speaker A: So forks. Bullish, Bearish.
01:22:14.111 - 01:22:15.999, Speaker B: That is reminiscent of Defi Summer.
01:22:16.047 - 01:22:22.195, Speaker A: Yes, it's happening, but it's happening at a much slower pace. Much slower pace.
01:22:22.275 - 01:22:23.667, Speaker D: Yeah. It's exciting though.
01:22:23.771 - 01:22:26.027, Speaker A: It's exciting because no one's on this meta yet.
01:22:26.131 - 01:23:07.031, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd say I'm quite bullish on forks. Right. I wouldn't want FriendTech to be the last iteration of whatever type of app that it's representing. Whether there's going to be long Lasting utilitarian value. We can't dispute the fact that this is a very effective form of bootstrapping liquidity, bootstrapping creator fan engagements, at least in the beginning. And I think over time as other applications perhaps improve upon bonding curves, perhaps making it easier for people to purchase. It doesn't have to even be keys in the future.
01:23:07.031 - 01:23:52.919, Speaker C: It could be just any other form of asset. I guess for a future application, you know, these can have, you know, lots of different widespread use cases. Right. Or it doesn't even, I guess like it doesn't even necessarily need to have like some kind of financial aspect. Right. Like perhaps in the future if I'm just like a content creator and I want to create my own little private, you know, friend tech like platform and say, hey, those who interact with my community the most, you know, can rack up like, I don't know, like Eric points and then later on, like, you know, you get exclusive access to something else that I'm coming out with. Or as I mentioned earlier, some kind of derivatives of this structure can be used for the building of on chain identity for other use cases in the future as well.
01:23:53.047 - 01:24:00.835, Speaker B: You said earlier that FriendTech smart contract is only 50 lines of code, which means it's super simple. I assume it's just some bundling curve.
01:24:01.335 - 01:24:01.959, Speaker D: That's it.
01:24:02.047 - 01:24:10.573, Speaker B: And if that's the case, why would you need to fork the smart contracts? You can just build new front ends. You can build, you can build a Twitter with gamified.
01:24:10.669 - 01:24:53.281, Speaker D: Yeah, I think maybe fork's not the right word, but more like creating new social web3 social primitives would be the right way to put it. I would love to see more of those and see who has a really cool design or comes up with something completely different on top of this. And we'd be interested in backing it. Right? Straight forks I don't think would be as interesting, but in on teams. Yeah, the derivatives that were created recently were literally just trying to copy and paste it onto other chains. And like, I just don't see how that makes any sense because with social networks, if you've ever used one, the network effect is what literally gives it the value it has. And the switching costs are so high because you can't copy and paste the whole network.
01:24:53.393 - 01:25:11.153, Speaker A: Let me counter that thought right there. So El tweeted the other day that social fi is going to be like amms on every chain. They're all going to have their own. Right. We can whatever. Right. But you're starting to see like, you know, if you look at Solana, right.
01:25:11.153 - 01:25:51.323, Speaker A: Anatoly is a big proponent of tiplink and frenzy.com well, he doesn't really care for Frenzy, but it's Frenzy is like a solana version of FrontTech. And these communities are cults already. The layer ones and L2s are cults themselves. So why would they want to use someone else's on another layer one if they're cults themselves? So I guess to counter that, I mean, I agree with the network effects, but if inherently layer ones, L2s are cult like systems, then could you see this spreading to other layer one? Could you see other users from other chains? They're huge proponents of those chains using something like Frontex.
01:25:51.419 - 01:26:35.957, Speaker D: So I understand what you mean by the L1 L2 cults, but I think there's. When l mentioned and it's like AMMs and all that, I just don't see that happening. Because Defi's design is inherently different from social fi, where you've got these AMMs, you're fighting for liquidity. Protocols are all fighting for liquidity because liquidity gives you the lowest price, which means everything gets routed to you and you get more fees. How do you fight for liquidity? You would have a token and people would farm it and throw LP tokens in there and all of that. But as soon as someone gives you even 1% more APR with similar risk, you have zero loyalty to the platform. All you have to do is click a button to transfer your LP token somewhere else.
01:26:35.957 - 01:27:23.477, Speaker D: Right? It's very easy because these LP tokens, the liquidity that everyone's fighting for, is so fungible and easy to move. But when you have all of this ETH liquidity trapped into a bonding curve and then all the social connections that you've already formed on a, on a social fi platform like FriendTech, how do you fork that over or migrate that over? Right. Sushi made it really simple with migrating your liquidity from Uniswap. You just click a button and boom, you're done. Right? But if someone creates a friend tech derivative and tries to migrate that liquidity over or the user base over, there's no easy way to do that one. There's an immutable contract with Rentech where that ETH can't be extracted out of the bonding curve. Everybody has to click sell and take that ethnicity after paying the fees and move it over.
01:27:23.541 - 01:27:24.213, Speaker A: High switching cost.
01:27:24.269 - 01:27:51.315, Speaker D: Yeah, massively high switching cost, I think. You know, Defi, I mentioned to you before is like, you know, a big pie and I think has true utility, but it's just going to be continuously on the back end. The value and the liquidity will be split across thousands and thousands of players as like the ocean becomes more and more populated. Meanwhile, I think with social fi, you're going to have a couple big players taking big chunks of the pie.
01:27:52.215 - 01:28:11.911, Speaker A: Let's go to what do we want to see built on like if. Because founders are watching this, right? What are 10 different. Maybe five, 10, five times so much. Three to five ideas. And we talked about lending already. What other ideas would you like to see built?
01:28:12.023 - 01:28:13.875, Speaker C: Could you expand on that question a bit more?
01:28:14.015 - 01:28:24.175, Speaker A: So you released a base proxy contract, right, where people can transfer keys, do their pre sales lending. What other utility can you see for that contract?
01:28:25.035 - 01:29:05.369, Speaker D: It's hard to imagine, like if I had something that I was really excited about, like I had an idea, I would have started building it already. But I'm also like brainstorming right now like what more could be there. I think staking is pretty interesting. You could actually build, you know, pools where people put it in to like a ETF or someone creates like a, like a manager. Right. Like maybe like why I've heard of this idea, right. And you know, you're, you can actually permissionlessly pay them a cut and they could, you know, spray it into different places and you never have to manage it yourself.
01:29:05.369 - 01:29:17.519, Speaker D: You're, you're, you're only just coming in for the financial gain of the keys, right? Could be interesting. Um, I don't know. There, there, there's a lot more things that you could just take ideas from Defi and then.
01:29:17.607 - 01:29:17.871, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:29:17.903 - 01:29:28.503, Speaker D: You know, reapply it. Um, you know, maybe don't reapply the mistakes we made in Defi, but you know, the things that really worked that could really be translatable into this.
01:29:28.639 - 01:30:03.845, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, it, it'll be interesting seeing like how keys kind of interact like you said with like Defi or like other on chain assets or even NFTs, right. Like you know, eventually having people being able to transact in keys in order to you know, swap for a certain NFT or you know, collateralize your key for taking out certain loan or getting a certain amount of tokens. Right. This, right now it's still operating very much as like an isolated platform in which we're just all transacting keys with one another, but eventually having that be composable with other types of on chain assets could be, could be interesting as well.
01:30:04.005 - 01:30:14.405, Speaker A: Interesting. I see it as a DAO because you have a bunch of folks that are in for a certain reason.
01:30:14.445 - 01:30:14.621, Speaker D: Right.
01:30:14.653 - 01:31:01.935, Speaker A: Whether it's the creator, maybe it's the idea, et cetera. And you could build a wrapper on top that allows people to vote on a certain aspect, whether it's to sell a key, whether it's to redirect trading fees and invest into something else. I mean, I could see this as a dao. I could also see this as an NFT community also because NFT communities, although releasing jpegs out there, it's great, but there isn't a lot of control and systems in place that allows people to do what they want. So I could see this as a. And I think black noise Ansem mentioned this as well as like I could see these communities airdropping NFTs for people that buy into these accounts as well. So there's some really interesting elements that can come out of this.
01:31:01.935 - 01:31:13.975, Speaker A: So I feel like. Yeah, I think we're just getting started. It seems like I'm super excited about this space. Any final questions, Chao? Any final thoughts, guys?
01:31:14.475 - 01:31:15.323, Speaker D: Nope.
01:31:15.499 - 01:31:20.163, Speaker A: Well, thanks so much for joining Good Game and we'll chat with you soon.
