00:00:00.170 - 00:00:06.298, Speaker A: With FTX gone, there's a void for non KyC perps. In your opinion, who is the frontrunner in that category?
00:00:06.394 - 00:00:11.994, Speaker B: Right now? By the numbers, it's GMX. And yeah, DyDx is doing KyC.
00:00:12.042 - 00:00:12.254, Speaker A: Right.
00:00:12.292 - 00:00:16.154, Speaker B: So DyDx is out of the question. I mean, by the numbers, it's GMX.
00:00:16.202 - 00:00:18.094, Speaker A: Wait, why is Dydx out of the.
00:00:18.212 - 00:00:19.550, Speaker B: Don't they do KyC?
00:00:20.050 - 00:00:41.220, Speaker A: What they do is it's a IP block, right? So if your IP is originated from us, you can't trade on the platform. And they will do like random id verification check, which I think they stopped, from what I remember, because people found that to be annoying. And so I think they stopped it. But I think DydX, you can still trade technically, outside of the US.
