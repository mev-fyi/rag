00:00:00.090 - 00:00:36.100, Speaker A: If you're a developer, right? Like any transaction you have, there's some minimum amount of intent that you have to convey. The system can't magically figure out what you're trying to do. And so what we've done in Sui is try to set it up so that the intent that you have to convey saying which NFT am I using in this transaction? Which decks am I interacting with? The things you'd have to specify in any platform, sort of the minimum information is also the dependency information that helps the parallelization scheme. And so basically that's how it works. Like if you're interacting with a dex, you have to specify dependencies. But the dependencies you specify are what two coin types am I swapping and what's the ID of the decks I'm interacting with. This is the same information you'd have to give on Sui, on optos, basically on any kind of platform.
