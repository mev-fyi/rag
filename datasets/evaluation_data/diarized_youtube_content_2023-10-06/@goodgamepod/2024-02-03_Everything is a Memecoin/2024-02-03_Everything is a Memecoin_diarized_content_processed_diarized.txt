00:00:00.120 - 00:00:13.822, Speaker A: I mean, everything, at the end of the day is a meme coin. I don't care what you say, but everything is a meme coin. And that includes the personal tokens. That includes the dog with a hat, that includes BTC. BTC, for me, is a meme coin. Most other coins in the top 100 are meme coins.
00:00:13.878 - 00:00:15.634, Speaker B: I mean, bitcoin's a meme. It's gold.
00:00:16.534 - 00:00:24.894, Speaker A: Exactly. Bitcoin is a meme. For the boomers Ethereum, arguably is no longer a meme coin because there's a yield now, but for the first six years, it was a meme coin.
00:00:24.974 - 00:00:26.474, Speaker B: It's like an on chain bond, right?
00:00:26.574 - 00:00:30.134, Speaker A: Yeah. The Internet bond, as they call it. I hate that shit. But.
00:00:30.674 - 00:00:32.538, Speaker B: So boomer. But people like it.
00:00:32.586 - 00:00:46.978, Speaker A: But, yeah, everything is a meme coin. Everything is a meme. The sooner you realize this, I'm not saying this is the right way to look at things, but it's a helpful way to look at things. And if you view things through this lens, I think a lot of things, a lot of evaluation, et cetera, will make sense to you.
00:00:47.026 - 00:00:55.134, Speaker B: What you just said reminded me of a meme, of the spaceman looking at the earth, and there's another spaceman behind him with a gun. Is it all a meme?
00:00:55.214 - 00:00:55.998, Speaker A: Yeah, it.
00:00:56.046 - 00:00:59.254, Speaker B: Always has been. The whole world is a meme.
