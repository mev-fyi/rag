00:00:00.160 - 00:00:40.134, Speaker A: So this idea of decentralized AI is probably the one thing I'm personally most excited about, because I think it's going to actually do real good to the world instead of, you know, there's a lot of people who worry about AI becoming or driving the world into a dystopian vision, and decentralized AI is the thing that will prevent that from happening. Obviously, this is extremely, extremely technically challenging, and it's probably more of an AI problem than a crypto problem, even though it has the word decentralized. It's more about finding new ways to fine tune data locally to prune data, or to prune models locally to compress data locally. So it's more of a math problem, computer science problem than crypto.
