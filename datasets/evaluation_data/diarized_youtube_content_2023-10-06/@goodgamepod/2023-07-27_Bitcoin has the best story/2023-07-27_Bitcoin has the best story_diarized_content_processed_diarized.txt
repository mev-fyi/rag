00:00:00.160 - 00:00:37.884, Speaker A: So we talked about our alliance applications during several episodes, notably in the wars between the layer ones. We talked about how we saw the rise of Solana before anyone else did. Just looking at the number of developers applying to our program. And about a year and a half ago, we saw something similar, not to the same extent, of course, but something similar with stacks. So we saw some really strong developers, builders, building on top of stacks. So that was the thing that got me thinking, okay, there's probably something really interesting going on with bitcoin, and it's probably something worth looking at because everyone else has written it off. And Bitcoin has the best story.
00:00:37.884 - 00:00:45.284, Speaker A: Bitcoin has the best story. Well, even today, it has half a trillion dollars worth of value that are stored in bitcoin. Yeah.
