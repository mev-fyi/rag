00:00:00.320 - 00:00:30.274, Speaker A: I don't think it makes sense to just keep jumping to the hottest chain of the month. You sort of just lose your community every time. And I think your brand and sort of your whole message gets really diluted if you just keep jumping around. Or you just deploy in like, 100 different places. Yeah. So I think as a founder, you need to just choose, like, where you want to be built, who's your sort of core community, which sort of tech you want to align yourself with. I mean, crypto is very tribal, so I think being part of no tribe is worse than being part of one tribe.
00:00:30.274 - 00:00:46.434, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think we have chosen to be sort of ethereum aligned. I like Ethereum. I think we have the community from Ethereum since day one. All our TVL is sort of from the Ethereum ecosystem. So, yeah, we are sort of like doubling down on the ecosystem.
